Donald Olson is a novelist, playwright, and travel writer. His newest
novel, Memoirs Are Made of This, was published in the U.K. by Hodder-
Headline in 2007 under the pen name Swan Adamson. Two earlier Swan
Adamson novels, My Three Husbands and Confessions of a Pregnant
Princess, were published in the U.S. and translated into French. Donald
Olson’s novel, The Confessions of Aubrey Beardsley, was published in the
United Kingdom by Bantam Press, and his play, Beardsley, was produced
in London. His travel stories have appeared in the New York Times,

lications. His additional guidebooks England For Dummies, Best Day Trips

Donald’s favorite cities, and England is one of his favorite countries.
England For Dummies won a 2002 Lowell Thomas Travel Writing Award
for best guidebook.

This book is dedicated to all those Americans who love London as

Introduction
F
or all its historic panache, time-honored traditions, quaint corners,
and associations with royal pomp and ceremony, London is very
much a modern European city. London is a rich blend of the very old
and the very new, with attractions ranging from the Tower of London,
begun in 1066, to the Tate Modern gallery, which opened in 2000. It’s big,
too, both in size and population; more than 9 million people reside in the
1,611-square-kilometer (622-sq.-mile) megalopolis known as Greater
London.
For first-time visitors, London can be a bit of a challenge. But with some
advance planning and useful information under your belt, making the
trip will be easier and even more enjoyable than you thought. London
may be far from where you live, but for many people, a trip to England is
like going home.
About This Book
London For Dummies, 5th Edition, is meant to be used as a reference.
You can start at the first page and read all the way through. If you do,
you’ll end up with an unusually complete knowledge of London essen-
tials. On the other hand, you may not need parts of this book because
you’ve already been to London or know the basics of international
travel. You’re after quick, easy-to-find specifics. In that case, you can
easily flip to the part that you need or home in on a specific chapter. The
philosophy behind this book is quite simple: I wanted to create the kind
of guide that I wished I’d had on my first trips to London — informative,
practical, down-to-earth, and fun.
When you travel, unexpected surprises create the most memorable
moments and provide the stories that you take back with you. But the
other side of travel is details and planning. Questions about where to eat
and sleep aren’t small issues when you’re away from home. They can
make or break a trip — I know that. So what I offer here is based on my
own experience in traveling, living, and working in London.
You should know, however, that travel information is subject to change
at any time — especially prices. Therefore, I suggest that you write or
call ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. 

The authors, editors, and publisher cannot be held responsible for the
experiences of readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us,
however, so we encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your sur-
roundings. Keep a close eye on cameras, purses, and wallets — all
favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
I recently tried to extract some information from a guidebook and found
so many symbols that I needed training in hieroglyphics to interpret
them all. I’m happy to report that the user-friendly London For Dummies,
5th Edition, travel guide isn’t like that. I keep the use of symbols and
abbreviations to a minimum. Here are the conventions you need to be
aware of while using this book:
 The credit card abbreviations are AE (American Express), DC
(Diners Club), MC (MasterCard), and V (Visa).
 I include the London postal area (SW7, for example) in all street
addresses, in case you want to look up the street in a London A–Z
or other London street reference map.
 I give the nearest Tube/Underground (subway) stop for all destina-
tions (for example, Tube: Piccadilly Circus).
 I list all prices first in British pounds sterling (£), and then in U.S.
dollars ($) rounded to the nearest dollar (when prices are under
$10, I round them to the nearest nickel). Although the exchange
rate fluctuates daily, in this book, I use the rate £1 = $2.
 The London city code, 020, precedes all London telephone num-
bers in this book (a different toll-free or charge-for-call code applies
in a few cases, which I note). The local London number follows the
city code. If you’re calling London from outside the United Kingdom,
you must dial the U.K. country code (44), followed by 20 and the
local number. If you’re calling London from elsewhere within the
United Kingdom, dial 020 before the number. If you’re calling
London from within London, just dial the local number.
I also apply a few conventions to the listings of hotels, restaurants, and
attractions, as follows:
 I list the hotels, restaurants, and top attractions in alphabetical
order, so you can easily move among the maps and descriptions.
 For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that you can find on a
map in this book, I include a page reference in the listing informa-
tion. If a hotel, restaurant, or attraction is outside the city limits or
in an out-of-the-way area, it may not be mapped.
 I give exact prices for every hotel, restaurant, and attraction.
Please note, however, that prices are subject to change. Also, an
London For Dummies, 5th Edition 
2

additional 17.5 percent VAT (value-added tax) is added to restau-
rant meals and may be added to hotel bills. (I note in the individual
hotel listings if the price does not include VAT.)
 I use a system of dollar signs ($) to show a range of costs for hotels
or restaurants. The dollar signs for hotels correspond to rack rates
(nondiscounted standard rates) and reflect a hotel’s low to high
rates for a double room. For restaurants, the dollar signs denote
the average cost of dinner for one person, including appetizer, main
course, dessert, a nonalcoholic drink, tax, and a tip. Check out the
following table to decipher the dollar signs:
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
£100/$200 or under
£13/$25 or under
$$
£101–£150/$201–$300
£13–£25/$26–$50
$$$
£151–£200/$301–$400
£26–£38/$51–$75
$$$$
£201–£250/$401–$500
£39/$76 and up
$$$$$
£251/$501 and up
 I divide the hotels into two categories — my personal favorites and
those that don’t quite make my preferred list but still get my hearty
seal of approval. Don’t be shy about considering these “runner-up”
hotels if you can’t get a room at one of my favorites or if your pref-
erences differ from mine — the amenities that the runners-up offer
and the services that each provides make all these accommoda-
tions good choices to consider as you determine where to rest your
head at night.
Foolish Assumptions
As I wrote this book, I made some assumptions about you and what your
needs may be as a traveler:
 You may be an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance 
when determining whether to take a trip to London and how to
plan for it.
 You may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t have a lot of
time to devote to trip planning, or you don’t have a lot of time to
spend in London after you get there — you want expert advice on
how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
 You may be looking for a carefully selective guidebook, one that
focuses only on the places that will give you the best or most
unique experiences in London.
If you fit any of these criteria, then London For Dummies, 5th Edition, has
all the information you’re looking for!
Introduction 3

How This Book Is Organized
This book has six parts, plus an appendix. You can read all the parts
independently — so if you want to zero in on restaurants or hotels, you
can turn right to that part. Or you can read the book sequentially to find
out all that you need to know about planning and visiting the City by the
Thames. The parts include the following:
Part I: Introducing London
This part introduces London and gives you some excellent reasons for
going there. I give you a rundown of the best London has to offer, from
hotels to historic sights, and then take you deeper into the city’s culture,
providing information to help you appreciate London’s history, architec-
ture, and cuisine. You can use this part to help you decide on the best
time of year for your visit, and I recommend some books and movies
that may whet your appetite and enhance your enjoyment of London.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London
This part helps take some of the wrinkles out of trip planning. First, you
can get some tips on managing your money and planning a realistic
budget. You can also find information on getting to London by air or by
crossing over (or under) the English Channel from Europe. Included here
are all the options for airlines, tips on how to get the best fare, plus the
lowdown on package tours and whether they can really save you money.
I provide special tips for families, travelers with disabilities, seniors, and
gays and lesbians. This part also covers the details that you need to take
care of or consider before your trip begins — from passports to health
insurance.
Part III: Settling into London
This part tells you what you need to know after you arrive. A bit of orien-
tation is in order, including detailed information on the ways, means, and
costs of getting from the airport into the city. The thumbnail sketches of
London neighborhoods can help you decide where you want to stay and
what areas you may want to explore. You can find everything that you
need to know about getting around town — whether you travel on foot,
by public transit, or in a taxi. I explain what kind of accommodations you
can expect for your money and describe London’s best hotels and B&Bs.
After that, I talk about the city’s dining scene, provide you with an appe-
tizing survey of London’s best restaurants, and provide a list of places
for quick, casual meals; down-to-earth fish-and-chips joints; simple or
glamorous teas; and picnic possibilities.
Part IV: Exploring London
This part is dedicated to seeing the sights — from the absolute must-
sees to lesser-known haunts and fascinating places that are only a 
quick train or Tube ride away. You can find all kinds of guided tours 
London For Dummies, 5th Edition 
4

and shopping coverage that steers you to a whole range of big stores
(yes, including Harrods) and small specialty shops. I also provide four
sample itineraries that maximize your sightseeing but won’t leave you
gasping for breath. And if you want to explore beyond London, check
out my six great day trips — to Bath, Stonehenge, and more.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife
This part introduces you to the performing arts, with an emphasis on
London’s fabulous theater scene, and all manner of after-dark entertain-
ment possibilities. I clue you in to the best sources for finding out what’s
going on around town and tell you how to get tickets. I also fill you in on
some of the city’s best pubs, clubs, bars, and discos.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
This part allows me to squeeze in some extra people, places, and things
that you may want to know about but that don’t really fit in elsewhere 
in the book. My lists include ten famous London statues, ten special
London churches, ten historic pubs, and ten important royals — past
and present.
Quick Concierge
This appendix includes an A-to-Z directory of fast facts that you need to
know, such as how the telephone system works, what numbers to call in
an emergency, and what taxes you must pay. I also provide a list of toll-
free telephone numbers and Web sites for airlines and hotel chains 
serving London, and tell you where to go to find more information on
London.
Icons Used in This Book
These six icons appear in the margins throughout this book:
Bargain Alert is my favorite icon — and I suspect it may be yours, too.
I’m not cheap, but I love to save money and find out about special deals.
Every time I tell you about something that can save you money, I include
the Bargain Alert icon.
The Best of the Best icon highlights the best London has to offer in all
categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, shopping, and nightlife.
I’m not an alarmist, so you won’t find too many Heads Up icons in this
book. If you see one, it means that I want you to be aware of something,
such as ticket agencies claiming to sell “reduced-price tickets” or the
double-tipping scam that you may encounter in a restaurant. London,
you’ll be pleased to know, isn’t the kind of city that requires too many
warning labels.
Introduction 5

Traveling with children? Keep your eyes peeled for the Kid Friendly icon.
If the icon is in front of a hotel name, the hotel welcomes families with
children and may even provide extras for kids. If it’s in front of a restau-
rant name, the kids will enjoy the food or the atmosphere, and the staff
will be welcoming to youngsters. And if the icon is in front of an attrac-
tion name, kids will (probably) enjoy something about the place.
When was the last time you read a travel book that filled you in on local
gossip, as well as all the mundane facts? For the London Tattler icon
(named after the famous London newspaper, The Tatler, published from
1709 to 1711), I include only the most newsworthy scandals — I mean
stories — to report on. I throw in these tidbits about well-known
Londoners and curious bits of London lore just for the fun of it.
The Tip icon highlights useful bits of information that can save you time
or enhance your London experience. A Tip alerts you to something (like
a special guided tour or a way to avoid standing in long lines) that you
may not otherwise consider or even know about.
Where to Go from Here
To London, of course! This book gives you the tools you need to make
the most of your trip, making it a very good place to start your journey.
Because the book covers all the basics, it’s an excellent guide to help
you plan, anticipate, and understand exactly what you want to see and
do in London. Whatever your plan, I hope that you think of me as your
guide or companion on the journey. I love London. My goal is to help
you have a great time while you’re there.

Part I
Introducing London

In this part . . .
A
re you a stranger to London? Well, now’s the time to be
properly introduced. This part helps you put a face to
the place. In Chapter 1, I give a general overview of the best
this great city has to offer, sketching in some details so you
know what you can ﬁnd there — including the newest attrac-
tions. Chapter 2 helps you understand London from a histori-
cal, architectural, and gastronomical perspective and gives
you a few suggestions for books and movies that may add to
your London knowledge. If you haven’t decided when to go,
turn to Chapter 3, where I ﬁll you in on what London offers
during each season and why you may ﬁnd some times better
than others for a visit.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of London
In This Chapter
 Discovering London’s greatest historic landmarks
 Exploring London’s world-famous museums
 Tasting the best of British cuisine
 Enjoying London’s performing arts and nightlife
 Experiencing the urban charms of London
S
o, you’re going to London. Gives you a thrill just thinking about it,
right? The capital of the United Kingdom is one of the world’s top
destinations, visited year-round by millions from all corners of the globe.
In fact, international travel surveys consistently rank London as one of
the most popular holiday destinations in the world. After you arrive,
you’ll be making your way through one of the most historic, cultured,
and exciting cities on Earth. You have every reason to feel a tingle of
anticipation.
This chapter gives you an at-a-glance reference to the absolute best —
the best of the best — that London has to offer. In the categories that I
outline, you’ll find some of the things that make visiting London so much
fun and so endlessly fascinating. I discuss each of these places in detail
later in this book; you can find them in their indicated chapters, marked
with a Best of the Best icon.
The Best Places to Soak Up London’s History
The great historic landmarks in London never fail to stir the imagination:
They’ve been witness to so much — from glorious triumphs to bloody
tragedies — that it’s almost impossible to remain unmoved when visiting
them. In Chapter 11, you’ll find more details on London’s top attractions;
here are my picks for the best of the best:
 An almost perceptible aura of legend pervades the Tower of
London, which was built over 900 years ago. When visiting the
Tower, you tread the ground where the great dramas and terrors of

a turbulent kingdom were played out, where Elizabeth I was held
captive while still a princess, and where Sir Thomas More and 
Anne Boleyn (second wife of Henry VIII and mother of the future
Elizabeth I) were beheaded.
 No less venerable is Westminster Abbey, a magnificent Gothic
church that ranks as the most historically significant religious
structure in England. Stepping into Westminster Abbey, you enter
the place where England’s kings and queens have been crowned
since William the Conqueror claimed the throne in 1066 and where
some of England’s greatest figures are buried or memorialized.
 Many of London’s most historic sites are or were royal domains,
and royal watching is a sport almost as popular as horse racing.
Okay, so you’re probably not going to get invited to the queen’s
garden party, but you can see where those famous parties take
place — and stroll through the royal staterooms — by visiting
Buckingham Palace, the queen’s London residence and a seat of
today’s royal power and intrigue.
 If you missed the Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace or
want another dose of that royal pomp and pageantry, Windsor
Castle is less than an hour away. Reputedly the queen’s favorite
castle, Windsor has a 900-year history that stretches back to the
time of William the Conqueror. Many of the rooms that you visit
today were remodeled in the time of Queen Victoria.
 Hampton Court Palace is one of the most magnificent of former
royal palaces, and you can easily get there in 30 minutes by train
from Central London (or, more romantically, by taking a boat on the
Thames). In addition to visiting dozens of staterooms in this 16th-
century Tudor palace where Henry VIII once resided, you can enjoy
the splendid gardens with their famous maze.
 Although you can’t see the rooms where the late Princess Diana
actually lived, you can get into her former home, Kensington
Palace, situated at the western side of Kensington Gardens. In addi-
tion to the vast, visitable staterooms, this mostly 18th-century
palace, where Victoria was born in 1819, houses a remarkable cos-
tume exhibit that includes royal raiment through the ages.
 Occupying a spot right on the River Thames, the Houses of
Parliament and their landmark clock tower containing Big Ben
have been a familiar sight to Londoners for over 150 years. In the
summer, fascinating tours of this seat of power let you see the
House of Commons and the House of Lords. Or you can just admire
the buildings from the outside and wait for the hourly boom of 
Big Ben.
 St. Paul’s Cathedral, with its landmark dome, is dear to the hearts
of Londoners and is used for events of national significance. A master-
piece by the architect Sir Christopher Wren, the cathedral was built
following the Great Fire that swept through London in 1666.

The Best Museums
If you’re a dedicated museum maven, London’s selection will keep you
going for days, weeks, months, even years. This city is loaded with every
conceivable kind of treasure from all over the world. And, amazingly
enough, entrance to all the great national museums is free. You can read
more about all of London’s top museums in Chapter 11; the following are
the best of the best:
 The venerable British Museum, with its unparalleled collection of
antiquities, comes out on top — the magnificent Parthenon sculp-
tures (formerly called the Elgin Marbles) understandably hold
pride of place there, but you’ll be amazed by the superlative
Egyptian and Roman collections, as well as the ancient treasures
found in England.
 The National Gallery houses the nation’s greatest collection of
British and European paintings from the 13th to the 20th centuries.
Here, you find works by Italian masters, such as Leonardo da Vinci
and Raphael; canvases by every great French Impressionist; a stun-
ning Rembrandt collection; and paintings by great British artists,
such as Turner and Constable.
 If you tire of the great Western European masterworks hanging in
the National Gallery, you can walk next door to see images of pop
icons like Elton John and Princess Di in the National Portrait
Gallery. Here, you’ll find a visual who’s who of every famous Brit in
history, captured in paint, stone, bronze, and photographs.
 Keen on decorative and applied arts? Then head over to the
Victoria & Albert Museum, a linchpin in the cluster of great South
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 11
Pomp, ceremony, and scandal: The royals
In London, the royals are spied on the way movie stars are in the United States. The
paparazzi furor lessened a bit after Princess Diana’s death, but it still exists.
I never gave much thought to royalty, except as a footnote to history, until one day,
years ago, when I was passing St. James’s Palace and saw Princess Diana and
Princess Anne being hustled into a waiting limo. There they were, two princesses,
going about the mysterious routines of royalty. I saw them for maybe three seconds
and stood there like a slack-jawed yokel as the limo pulled away.
From the queen on down, the monarchy is a huge business (they actually call them-
selves “The Firm”), and you can’t avoid it. Buy a London paper any day in London, and
you can find some juicy tidbit about Prince Charles, his new wife Camilla Parker-
Bowles (the Duchess of Cornwall), Prince William, Prince Andrew, Prince Harry,
Princess Anne, or some other member of The Firm. (I provide a few juicy items of my
own in this book with my London Tattler asides.)

Kensington museums. The V&A, as it’s called, houses wonderfully
decorated period rooms, a comprehensive fashion collection,
Italian Renaissance sculpture, and acres more.
 The other two outstanding museums in South Kensington are the
Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. Animatronic
dinosaurs, including a hungry T. rex, are the cold-blooded stars in
the Natural History Museum’s famed dinosaur exhibit, but while
you’re there, check out the mind-boggling collection of gems. In the
Science Museum, you come face to face with legends from the
world of science and technology.
 London’s South Bank is buzzing with the addition of the stunning
Tate Modern. Housed in a former power station on the river, the
museum exhibits an international roster of contemporary greats.
 Tate Britain holds the world’s greatest collection of British art.
Wander through rooms filled with works by William Blake, 
Turner, Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Constable, and all the 
pre-Raphaelites.
 London lovers will love the Museum of London, probably the
world’s most comprehensive city museum, which features an amaz-
ing collection of Roman antiquities (the museum incorporates part
of a 2,000-year-old Roman wall) and tells the fascinating story of
London through the ages.
 You can also enjoy masterpieces in museums that were built as pri-
vate palaces, such as Spencer House, former home of Princess
Diana’s family; Apsley House, home of the first Duke of Wellington;
and Hertford House, home of the Wallace Collection, a national
museum.
The Best of British Cuisine
Once upon a time, you could always count on getting lousy meals in
London. The nation’s dull, insular, uninspired cooking was the joke of
Europe. That reputation began to change in the 1980s, with the influx of
new cooking trends that favored foods from France and Italy. Since then,
London has become a food capital (allegedly with more Michelin-starred
restaurants than Paris). For a handy reference guide to English cuisine,
see the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book. You can find all of my top
London restaurants in Chapter 10; here are my picks for the best the
London dining scene has to offer:
 London is the best place to find restaurants serving inventive
Modern British cuisine. Reserve a table at Rules, The Ivy, Langan’s
Bistro, Veronica’s, The Oratory, or Boxwood Café — to name just
a few — and let your taste buds do the talking.
 Traditionalists need not despair: All those wonderful old English
faves are still around — eggs, kippers, beans, and fried tomatoes
Part I: Introducing London 
12

for breakfast; bubble and squeak; roast beef and Yorkshire pudding;
meat pies; fish and chips; toad in the hole; cottage pie; sticky toffee
pudding; and trifle. You’ll find the old English comfort foods at
pubs and restaurants such as The Stockpot, Founders Arms,
Simpson’s-in-the-Strand, Porter’s English Restaurant, and many
others.
 Some would say that Indian cooking is the new national cuisine of
England. Well, it’s certainly one of multiethnic London’s faves, and
Indian restaurants are often far more affordable than your other
options. Like other cuisines, Indian cooking in England has been
undergoing many transformations. Veeraswamy is the oldest Indian
restaurant in London, but the interior is cool and contemporary.
You can also find great Indian cooking at Mela and Noor Jahan.
 If French cooking is your idea of heaven, you won’t lack for dining
options in London. Both traditional and nouvelle French restau-
rants remain alive and well. You may want to try the classiest of
them all, Aubergine; other choices include Oxo Tower Brasserie,
with its stunning river views, Criterion Bar & Grill, and Brasserie
St. Quentin.
 And don’t forget that London boasts more ethnic restaurants than
anywhere else in the United Kingdom, so almost any kind of cuisine
can be on the tip of your tongue. For delectable tapas and Spanish/
Moroccan food, go to Moro. For slurpy and superlative Japanese
noodles, head for Wagamama. At Ken Lo’s Memories of China, you
can feast on food inspired by a Chinese master chef. For fresh New
Zealand mussels and the most delicious New Zealand dessert,
known as Pavlova, Suze in Mayfair is your best bet.
The Best Places to Shop in London
It’s not just my credit cards talking: I’m here to tell you that London is
one of the world’s great shopping cities — possibly the greatest. Why?
The sheer variety of what’s available.
Trend-setting London is to the United Kingdom what New York City is to
the United States: the place where it happens first (or ultimately ends
up). London is where you can eyeball what’s hot, British style. You see
the latest hard-core street fashions side by side with the quintessentially
traditional.
Not into new? In London, you can hunt for an old engraving, try on a
cocktail dress from the ’50s, paw through bric-a-brac at an outdoor
market stall, or wander through the London silver vaults in your quest
for a Georgian soup ladle.
For my complete rundown of London shopping, see Chapter 12; below
are some hints on finding London’s best stores and shopping districts:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 13

 Is Harrods the most famous department store in the world? Quite
possibly so. See for yourself if it deserves all the hype. And be sure
to visit the Food Halls.
 Fortnum & Mason is the queen’s London grocer, and it’s probably
the only store in the world where you’ll see cans of soup displayed
on wooden shelves along carpeted aisles. Other departments
include china, crystal, leather, antiques, and stationery — plus, 
you can dine at the store’s famous restaurants.
 Shopaholics hold Oxford Street in very high regard. Lined with
major department stores like Selfridges and Marks & Spencer, and
chockablock with dozens upon dozens of moderate to upscale
shops, it’s a rendezvous point for shoppers of all ages from all over
the world. Motto: Big Names, Reasonable Prices.
 Knightsbridge is a flash-and-cash point of the highest order, home
of the aforementioned Harrods, the smaller Harvey Nichols, and a
lot of luxurious designer boutiques where real and wannabe aristo-
crats shop for “the season.”
 Time and money just fly when you visit the super-chic boutiques of
Covent Garden, Bond Street, and King’s Road in Chelsea. In these
certified shopping zones, you can find everything a true fashionista
could ever want.
 Hidden away from the hoi polloi, the 200-year-old shops on Jermyn
Street cater to traditionalists who want the finest goods available.
Many of the shops on Jermyn Street have Royal Warrants — that is,
they’re allowed to advertise that they sell to the royal family. Look
for custom-made shirts and suits, hand-tooled leather shoes, and
fabulous toiletry shops, such as Floris and Taylors of Old Bond
Street.
 What reader wouldn’t be tempted by the wonderland of bookstores
on Charing Cross Road? It’s a reader’s feast and a browser’s para-
dise, with major U.K. independent bookstores like W & G Foyle,
major U.K. chains like Waterstone’s, and smaller specialized book-
stores like Murder One all represented.
The Best of London’s Performing Arts
London is a world capital, and that includes being a world capital of the
performing arts. When the sun goes down, the curtain comes up. For a
description of London’s major performing arts venues and companies,
see Chapter 15; here are my recommendations for the very best:
 For many visitors, going to the theater is reason enough to go to
London. When actors of the highest caliber are on the boards — as
they always are in London — you don’t need to think twice about
going to the theater; you just go. The London theater scene is phe-
nomenal, and prices are lower than in New York. Take your pick:

long-running international-hit musicals, light comedies, hard-hitting
dramas, new works in “fringe” venues, everything from William
Shakespeare to Oscar Wilde to Neil LaBute and beyond.
 Opera buffs appreciate the fact that London has two major opera
companies. International stars appear at the historic Royal Opera
in Covent Garden, where operas are performed in their original lan-
guages. A few blocks away is the English National Opera, where
every opera is sung in English by mostly British performers and the
productions tend to be more adventuresome.
 Every night, lovers of classical music have an embarrassment of
riches to choose from. London is home to several world-class sym-
phony orchestras. The London Symphony Orchestra plays at the
Barbican Center, where good seats cost as little as £15 ($30). The
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performs at Cadogan Hall and the
Royal Albert Hall. The newly refurbished Royal Festival Hall is
home to four resident orchestras: the London Philharmonic, the
Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta, and the
Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. Other renowned U.K. and
European orchestras perform regularly in the city, as do interna-
tionally known chamber music ensembles. A summer highlight is
the Proms concerts at Royal Albert Hall, featuring an international
roster of the best orchestras and soloists in the world.
 Dance aficionados can enjoy an evening at the Royal Ballet and/or
the English National Ballet, both of which have regular London
seasons. Smaller dance companies, from traditional to cutting edge,
are at home in venues throughout the city.
The Best Urban Charms
London is one great city that has actually gotten better over the years.
In deference to the millennium year 2000, the city dusted itself off and
spruced itself up in ways that have benefited residents and visitors alike.
Old museums, such as the Great Court in the British Museum, have been
revamped with stunning results, and new museums, such as Tate Modern,
have opened (see “The Best Museums,” earlier in this chapter). Sleek,
new bridges now span the Thames, and riverside areas have seen a
flurry of development. Trafalgar Square has been joined to the National
Gallery, making pedestrian access a breeze rather than a chore. All in all,
London has shaken off its old mantle of hidebound traditionalism, has
embraced multiculturalism, and is now high tech and cutting edge.
But the old fabric of London still remains and invites exploration.
Despite all the improvements in public transit, London remains a city
where walking is a joy that reveals no end of simple urban pleasures; the
following are the best among them:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of London 15

 London is blessed with marvelous parks. You may have heard of
them: Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, St. James’s Park, Green
Park, and Regent’s Park (all described in Chapter 11). These care-
fully groomed havens, where you can stroll beneath stately trees,
lounge on the grass, watch ducks in a pond, or admire the color of
the springtime daffodils, were former royals-only hunting grounds.
Now they’re part of every Londoner’s life and life’s blood, the green
lungs of an otherwise congested city.
 What could be more fun than just wandering around London’s
streets? Try it. Pick a neighborhood — the City, Soho, Chelsea —
then just stroll at will, taking note of the wealth of architectural
styles, the curious reminders of days gone by, and the array of local
sights, such as the blue, “famous-person-lived-here” plaques on
house fronts. On some streets, you can almost hear the horses’
hooves clopping on the cobblestones as they did up until about
1915.
 The South Bank and Southwark areas on the “other” side of the
river have been opened for pedestrians and show off an ancient
area of London that’s been completely revitalized. You can enjoy a
waterside walk with city views from Westminster Bridge to Tower
Bridge.
 The variety of architectural styles adds to the beauty of the city.
Because the Great Fire of 1666 burned down most of medieval
London, the building and house styles that you see tend to range
from the sober neoclassical of the early 18th century, to the more
elegantly light-hearted Regency style of the early 19th century, to
the heavier and less graceful Victorian period of the mid- to late
19th century. The human scale of London streets, with their long
terraces of attached brick, stone, and stucco homes built around
leafy squares, gives the city a charm and character that intrigues
and delights the eye. London grew from a series of villages, and you
can still find that villagelike character in many London neighbor-
hoods. (For a list of those neighborhoods, see Chapter 8, and for
more on London architecture, see Chapter 2.)

T
his chapter helps you find out more about London and deepens your
experience of England. I distill the essence of London’s complicated
and tumultuous past so you can get a clear, quick sense of the major
epochs. Then I highlight the main architectural trends, whet your
appetite with a primer on English food and drink, and recommend some
excellent books and movies about the capital of the United Kingdom.
The Main Events: A Brief History of London
London’s history is inextricably intertwined with the larger history of
England. Endless tomes have been written on individual monarchs, col-
orful personalities, architectural styles, and historical epochs in English
history. But I’m going to be as brief as a bikini and give you a history
that covers only the bare essentials in the following sections.
Prehistory and the arrival of the Romans
Over 2,500 years ago, a Celtic tribe was living beside the River Thames
in the region that would later become London.
When the Romans conquered England in A.D. 43, they suppressed or sub-
dued the local Celts. The legendary Queen Boudicca (or Boadicea) was a
Celtic warrior queen who fought back the invading Romans. (You can
see a statue of her on Westminster Bridge in London.) The Romans
brought their building and engineering skills to England and erected a
2.6-square kilometer (1-sq.-mile) fort they called Londinium. This small
settlement eventually became the City of London, the earliest area to be
developed. In the City, you can still see the remains of Roman walls and
a temple where Roman soldiers worshipped a Persian god called Mithras
(see Chapter 18).

Northern invaders
With the Roman Empire’s breakup in A.D. 410, Jutes, Angles, and Saxons
from northern Europe invaded England and formed small kingdoms. For
the next 600 years or so, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fought off Viking
raiders. The capital of England at the time was in Winchester, in the
Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Wessex. Because of its strategic position on 
the Thames, London grew as an important center of trade.
William the Conqueror
The next major transitional period in England — and London — started
in 1066, when William of Normandy (1028–1087) fought and killed Harold,
the Anglo-Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. William and
his French nobles took over the land, moved their power base to London,
and built fortified castles — including Windsor Castle and the Tower 
of London (both described in Chapter 11) — that still stand today. 
Every monarch up to the present day claims descent from William the
Conqueror and, like him, has been crowned at Westminster Cathedral
(see Chapter 11) in London.
Magna Carta
King John, a Plantagenet, signed the Magna Carta in 1215, granting more
rights to the nobles. What about the common man and woman? As serfs
and vassals in a closed, hierarchical, class-ridden society, their lot wasn’t
an easy one. Geoffrey Chaucer (1342–1400), who lived and worked in
London, was the first writer to give us some recognizable portraits of
folks who lived during the medieval period, in The Canterbury Tales.
Hundred Years’ War
At home and abroad, war and bloodshed tore England apart for more
than 300 years. The Hundred Years’ War between France and England
began in 1337. The War of the Roses, fought between the Houses of York
and Lancaster, raged from 1455 to 1487.
Tudor and Elizabethan England
Henry VIII, the Tudor king famous for taking six wives, brought about the
next great shift in what had been Catholic England. In 1534, he dissolved
all the monasteries and became head of the Church of England. He
nabbed Hampton Court Palace (see Chapter 11) from Cardinal Wolsey
and made it one of his royal residences. Henry’s second wife, Anne
Boleyn, was beheaded at the Tower of London in 1536. Henry and Anne
Boleyn’s daughter, Elizabeth I, ruled during a period of relative peace,
power, and prosperity. The Elizabethan period was England’s Golden
Age, the time when Shakespeare’s plays were being performed at the
Globe Theatre (see Chapter 15) in London.

18

Civil War
In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King James I (1566–1625) of
England, uniting the crowns of England and Scotland. But conflicts
between monarchs and nobles were endless. Charles I (1600–1649), seek-
ing absolute power, dissolved Parliament in 1629. He was beheaded in
London after Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658) led a bitter civil war between
Royalists and Parliamentarians. Cromwell’s armies destroyed churches
and Royalist strongholds throughout the country. Cromwell was ele-
vated to Lord Protectorate of the Realm, but by 1660 a new king, 
Charles II (1630–1685), was on the throne. This time, however, his
powers were limited.
Fire, plague, and rebuilding
London, which had been growing steadily, was devastated by two back-
to-back catastrophes, the Great Plague of 1665 and the Great Fire of
1666.
Under the brilliant architect Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723), a new
London emerged from the ashes of the Great Fire. Brick and stone
replaced timber as the primary building material. Wren’s masterpiece,
St. Paul’s Cathedral (see Chapter 11), was built on the site of the old
cathedral, and dozens of Wren churches were erected in the City of
London. England’s steadily growing naval might was centered at
Greenwich (see Chapter 11), where Wren designed the Royal Naval
College, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
New lines of succession
When James II (1633–1701) tried to reinstate Catholicism in England, he
was deposed in 1688 and succeeded by his daughter Mary (1662–1694)
and William of Orange (1650–1702), thus ensuring a Protestant line of
succession. William and Mary renovated and lived in Kensington Palace
(see Chapter 11). The children of Queen Anne (1665–1714), the next
monarch, predeceased her, leaving the kingdom without an heir when
Anne died. George of Hanover (1660–1727) was chosen to be the next
king of England, thus ushering in the reign of the Hanoverians who pre-
ceded Victoria.
The Victorian Empire
England reached its zenith of power and prestige during the reign of
Victoria (1837–1901), who ruled over an empire so vast that “the sun
never set” on it. Victoria was born at Kensington Palace and moved to
the grander Buckingham Palace (see Chapter 11) when she was crowned
in 1837. Following the death of her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-
Coburg, the queen had the Albert Memorial (see Chapter 11) erected in
Kensington Gardens, where it still stands.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 19

The Industrial Revolution spawned major societal changes during this
period, moving England away from its agrarian past and into a mecha-
nized future. Charles Dickens (1812–1870) and other social reformers
exposed the wretched working and living conditions in Victorian London
and throughout England. After a fire, the Houses of Parliament were
rebuilt and reopened in 1857. The late Victorian Age was the time of
Sherlock Holmes, a fictional London detective created by Sir Arthur
Conan Doyle, and Jack the Ripper, a real-life serial killer who terrorized
London’s East End.
England in the world wars
England suffered terrible losses during World War I (1914–1918) but
emerged victorious. During World War II, from the fall of France in 1940
until the United States entered the war in 1941, England stood alone
against Hitler. Winston Churchill (1874–1965), the country’s prime minis-
ter during the war years, frequently held cabinet meetings in a secret
warren of underground rooms called the Cabinet War Rooms (see
Chapter 11), which are preserved just as they were during his tenure.
With strictly rationed food, mandatory blackouts, and terrible bombing
raids that destroyed whole sections of London and killed tens of thou-
sands of civilians, life in wartime London had a profound effect on its 
citizens. Shortages continued for many years afterward.
The welfare state
A major societal shift occurred in 1945 when the Labour Party began 
to dismantle the empire and introduced the welfare state. Under the
National Health System, every citizen in the United Kingdom can receive
free healthcare. It wasn’t until Margaret Thatcher and the Tory Party
came into power during the 1980s that England began privatizing for-
merly state-run agencies, such as the railroad (with what some say are
disastrous results).
Queen Elizabeth II
Queen Elizabeth II ascended the throne in 1952. The fairy-tale wedding of
her son Prince Charles to Lady Diana Spencer at St. Paul’s Cathedral in
1981 was the last high point for the House of Windsor (which changed
its name from the German Saxe-Coburg during World War II). Charles 
and Diana’s subsequent divorce seemed to unleash a floodgate of royal
scandals, with the result that the popularity of the British monarchy is
at an all-time low. Following her divorce, Diana (1961–1997) lived at
Kensington Palace (see Chapter 11), where grieving Londoners left a 
sea of floral tributes following her death in a car crash.
In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II celebrated her 50th anniversary on the
throne.

London at the millennium
In anticipation of the year 2000, London went on an all-out public-
relations blitz to show the world that “Rule, Britannia” had become
“Cool Britannia.” The giant Millennium Dome was a giant fiasco, but the
British Airways London Eye (see Chapter 11), an enormous observation
wheel, remains one of London’s most popular attractions.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 21
Recent royal events
In 2005, Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, finally married his long-time mis-
tress, Camilla Parker-Bowles, in a ceremony that his mother, Queen Elizabeth, did not
attend. The wedding was somewhat anticlimactic because Charles had been involved
with Camilla throughout his marriage to Princess Diana. On the first anniversary of his
marriage to Camilla, Charlie read a poll in the Times indicating that 56 percent of
Britons did not wish to see his new wife become queen. She will, though, unless the
governments of England and 15 Commonwealth nations change the law. In the mean-
time, the pre-queen is addressed as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall.
As the ever-popular Elizabeth enters her twilight years (she turned 81 in 2007), some
Britons wonder if the 1,000-year-old British monarchy should end with her — espe-
cially with the unpopular Charles next in line for the throne. Just 37 percent of Britons
think that Charles should succeed his mother, according to a 2007 poll. In fact, the poll
found that 39 percent would prefer that Charles’s elder son, Prince William, leapfrog
his father for the crown. Poor Charles just can’t seem to do anything to win him the
respect enjoyed by his mother.
In 2007, Prince Charles was accused by some members of Parliament of overstepping
the traditional bounds imposed on the royal family of not interfering in political matters.
Soon after, Charles had to read about his second son, Prince Harry, partying with lap
dancers as he and his class at Sandhurst military academy finished training. In com-
parison, Prince William, tall and blond like his late mother, Diana, stays out of trouble
and is, by all accounts, quiet and well-mannered. The only semi-bad press William
received in 2007 was when he broke off his four-year relationship with Kate Middleton,
presumably because her blood wasn’t blue enough. Though her parents are self-made
millionaires, Kate’s mother had once worked as a flight attendant. According to the
tabloids, William started to pine for Kate almost as soon as he dumped her, and the
two were seen together just two months after their breakup.
William and Harry co-hosted the hugely successful Concert for Diana at Wembley
Stadium in London on July 1, 2007 (what would have been Diana’s 47th birthday), an
event Prince Charles did not attend. The queen, meanwhile, was involved in a PR scuf-
fle when the BBC showed a film clip of her purportedly storming out of a sitting with
photographer Annie Leibovitz after Leibovitz asked Her Maj to remove her crown. It
turned out that the BBC had manipulated the film footage to suit its story and it was
forced to apologize. Soon after, Prince Phillip, the queen’s husband, denied reports
that he had ever called Diana a “harlot” and a “trollop.” Stay tuned. . . .

Mayor Ken
In 2000, Ken Livingstone, former Labour member of Parliament, was
elected to the newly created post of mayor of London (not to be con-
fused with the lord mayor of London, an ancient ceremonial position in
the City of London). During his controversial tenure — he was elected
for a second term in 2004 — Mayor Ken has instituted major changes in
the public transportation system, including the introduction of London’s
congestion charge, a fee that any driver entering Central London during
specific hours of the day must pay.
New Labour
In 2001, Tony Blair was elected to a second term as prime minister, and
New Labour, with its centrist approach, was firmly in control of the gov-
ernment. But in the 2005 elections, the party lost one-third of its seats as
voters expressed their discontent with Blair’s continuing support of the
U.S.-led war in Iraq. Blair stepped down as prime minister in 2007 and
was succeeded by Gordon Brown.
Terrorist bombings
In July 2005, one day after exultant Londoners learned that their city 
had been chosen to host the 2012 Olympic Games, terrorists detonated
bombs in the London Underground and on a double-decker bus, killing
56 people and wounding hundreds more. Londoners stood together and
carried on, showing the world that they would not be cowed by acts of
violence. A second bombing attempt a week later failed but had tragic
consequences when police shot and killed an innocent man suspected of
terrorism. In July 2007, police foiled another terrorist plot when they
defused bombs in two cars parked in Central London.
Building Blocks: An Overview 
of English Architecture
The period in which a building was constructed (or reconstructed), is
found in its architectural and decorative details. In a country like
England, where the age of buildings can span a thousand-year period 
(a few Anglo-Saxon churches are even older than that), many different
styles evolved. The architectural periods are often named for the
monarch or royal family reigning at the time. Knowing a few things about
the key features of the different styles of London’s abundance of historic
buildings will add a whole new perspective to your trip. Keep in mind
that little remains from before the Great Fire of 1666, which destroyed
most of London — Westminster Abbey and the Tower of London are the
two most notable exceptions.
The following list gives you a brief primer in English architectural his-
tory from Norman to Victorian times:
Part I: Introducing London 
22

 Norman (1066–1189): Round arches, barrel vaults, and highly deco-
rated archways characterize this period’s Romanesque style.
 Early English Gothic (1189–1272): The squat, bulky buildings of
the Norman period gave way to the taller, lighter buildings con-
structed in this style.
 Decorated Gothic (1272–1377): Buildings in this style have large
windows, tracery (ornamental work with branching lines), and
heavily decorated gables and arches.
 Perpendicular Gothic (1377–1483): Large buttresses (exterior side
supports) allowed churches to have larger windows than ever
before. Tracery was more elaborate than in previous Gothic build-
ings, the four-centered arch appeared, and fan vaulting (a decora-
tive form of vaulting in which the structural ribs spread upward
and outward along the ceiling like the rays of a fan) was perfected.
 Tudor (1485–1553): During this period, buildings evolved from
Gothic to Renaissance styles. Large houses and palaces were built
with a new material: brick. England has many half-timbered Tudor
and Elizabethan domestic and commercial buildings. This method
of construction used brick and plaster between visible wooden 
timbers.
 Elizabethan (1553–1603): The Renaissance brought a revival of
classical features, such as columns, cornices (prominent rooflines
with brackets and other details), and pediments (decorative tri-
angular features over doorways and windows). The many large
houses and palaces of this period were built in an E or H shape and
contained long galleries, grand staircases, and carved chimneys.
 Jacobean (1603–1625): In England, Inigo Jones used the symmetri-
cal, classically inspired Palladian style that arrived from Italy.
Buildings in this style incorporate elements from ancient Greece
and Rome.
 Stuart (1625–1688): Elegant classical features, such as columns,
cornices, and pediments, are typical of this period, in which Sir
Christopher Wren was the preeminent architect.
 Queen Anne (1689–1714): Buildings from the English baroque
period mix heavy ornamentation with classical simplicity.
 Georgian and Regency (1714–1830): During these periods, elegant
terraced houses were built; many examples survive in Brighton and
Bath. Form and proportion were important elements; interior deco-
ration inspired by Chinese motifs became fashionable.
 Victorian (1830–1901): A whole range of antique styles emerged —
everything from Gothic and Greek Revival to pseudo-Egyptian and 
-Elizabethan. Hundreds of English churches were renovated during
the Victorian era.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 23

 Modern, postmodern, and contemporary (1946 to present):
Massive destruction in World War II bombing raids meant rebuild-
ing whole sections of London. International modernism, adapted
from European models, resulted in sleeker and simpler facades.
The most iconic building from the modernist era is Royal Festival
Hall, built on the South Bank for the Festival of Britain in 1951.
Gargantuan and ungainly postmodern office buildings went up in
the City (London’s financial center) in the 1980s, borrowing archi-
tectural styles and elements from earlier and more gracefully
coherent epochs. In the past decade, buildings by designer archi-
tects have popped up on the London skyline, most notably the
Gherkin, a pickle-shaped City office tower, and the new London City
Hall, a rounded glass building on the South Bank near Tower
Bridge, both designed by Lord Norman Foster.
Dining English Style, from 
Traditional to Modern
London’s dining scene can satisfy any taste and budget, and it is the best
place to find restaurants serving inventive modern British and ethnic
cuisines of every sort. In fact, spicy Indian cooking is England’s second
“national” cuisine. Scores of Indian and other ethnic restaurants
throughout the city mean there is always something new to try.
But traditionalists in search of all those wonderful old English faves
won’t be at a loss. It’s true that many Londoners now opt for a latte and
a muffin at Starbucks for their breakfast, but you can still find places
that serve a good greasy fry-up with eggs, kippers, beans, and fried
tomatoes. And old comfort foods like bubble and squeak (mashed pota-
toes mixed with cabbage) and bangers and mash (sausages with mashed
potatoes) are still around, too. The great traditional “roasts” are served
at places like Simpson’s-in-the-Strand, where a server at your table will
slice your roast beef or roast lamb and dish up your Yorkshire pudding.
When traditional, non-fancy English dishes are done well, they’re super-
satisfying and delicious.
Other traditional dishes loved by Londoners include meat and fish pies,
shepherd’s pie (ground beef topped with mashed potatoes and baked),
and fish and chips. And for dessert? At restaurants like Porter’s English
Restaurant, you can still find sticky toffee pudding (sponge cake smoth-
ered in warm butterscotch sauce), spotted dick (steamed, raisin-filled
sponge cake covered with custard), and trifle (sherry-soaked sponge
cake layered with raspberry preserves, covered with custard sauce, 
and topped with whipped cream).
While you’re in London, you can also look forward to the world of after-
noon tea. Teas can be as simple or as fancy as you want — nothing more
than a cup of tea and a pastry in a patisserie, or an elaborate affair with
scones, clotted or whipped cream, preserves, cakes, and sandwiches.

spots for tea, and check out the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for
a glossary of English food terms.
Visiting the Local Pub
The pub (short for public house) is an English institution. London is
awash with historic pubs where you can sit all evening with a pint of ale,
bitter, stout, or cider, and soak up the local color. You can even do a pub
crawl, walking (upright) from pub to pub and sampling the diverse
brews on tap. Although you can get a hard drink at both bars and pubs,
when you’re in a pub, you’re better off confining yourself to beer.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 25
A beer primer: Are you bitter or stout?
Most of the pubs in London and throughout the United Kingdom are tied to a particu-
lar brewery and sell only that brewery’s beers. (You see the name of the brewery on
the sign outside.) Independent pubs can sell more brands than a tied pub. Either way,
you still have to choose from what may seem like a bewildering variety. The colorful
names of individual brews don’t provide much help — you can only wonder what
Pigswill, Dogs Bollocks, Hobgoblin, Old Thumper, Pommies Revenge, or Boondoggle
taste like. Depending on all sorts of factors — the water, the hops, the fermentation
technique, and so on — the brewery crafts the taste of any beer, whether on draught
or in a bottle. You can get a few U.S. and international brands, but imports are more
expensive than the home-brew.
When ordering beer in a pub, specify the type, the brand, and the amount (pint or half-
pint) you want. Asking the bartender to recommend something based on your taste
preferences is perfectly okay. Just remember that most English beer is served at room
temperature. The following brief descriptions of the most common types of beer will
come in handy in a pub:
 Bitter is what most locals drink. It’s a clear, yellowish, traditional beer with a strong
flavor of hops. Real ale is a bitter that’s still fermenting (“alive”) when it arrives
from the brewery; it’s pumped and served immediately.
 Ale isn’t as strong as bitter and has a slightly sweeter taste. You can order light
or pale ale in a bottle; export ale is a stronger variety.
 Lager, when chilled, is probably the closest you can come to an American-style
beer. Lager is available in bottles or on draught.
 Shandy is equal parts bitter and lemonade (sometimes limeade or ginger beer);
it’s for those who like a sweet beverage that’s only partially beerlike in taste.
 Stout is a dark, rich, creamy version of ale. Guinness is the most popular brand. A
black and tan is half lager and half stout.

Parliament has instituted the strict hours that most pubs adhere to:
Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon
to 10:30 p.m. Americans, take note: You never tip the bartender in a pub;
the best you can do is offer to buy him or her a drink — an acceptable
practice in England. Ten minutes before closing, a bell rings, signaling
that the time has come to order your last round.
Background Check: Finding London 
on Page and Screen
Has any country produced as many great and enduring writers as
England has? In a brief survey, it’s impossible to even scratch the 
surface. The wonderful thing about London — at least, if you love 
literature — is that it figures in so many great works. All over the city,
you encounter blue plaques on the fronts of buildings identifying what
famous person lived there and when. Many of those famous residents
were writers. Here are a few of my recommendations:
 A History of Britain, by Simon Schama: This highly readable
three-volume history of Britain by the noted historian accompanied
a program of the same name on the BBC History Channel.
 The Cazalet Chronicles, by Elizabeth Jane Howard: The four
novels (The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off) in
this compulsively readable series chronicle the life of a middle-
class family in London and on the south coast of England between
the two world wars.
 The Diana Chronicles, by Tina Brown: This biography of 
Diana, Princess of Wales, is highly readable and opinionated — 
you wouldn’t expect less from the former editor of Tatler, Vanity
Fair, and the New Yorker.
 The Line of Beauty, by Alan Hollinghurst: A Booker Prize winner,
Hollinghurst’s brilliantly realized novel sketches a portrait of
London during the Thatcher years.
 London, by Edward Rutherfurd: London is the main character in
this fascinating historical novel that follows the fates of families
and fortunes over 2,000 years.
 London: A Biography, by Peter Ackroyd: When you get Peter
Ackroyd going, you can’t shut him up — so it’s a good thing he 
has such fascinating material to so endlessly talk about.
 Mrs. Dalloway, by Virginia Woolf: One of Woolf’s most accessible
and popular books, this novel, written in 1925, takes place during
one day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, an exemplary London host-
ess, as she prepares for a big party.
Part I: Introducing London 
26

 Oliver Twist, by Charles Dickens: Dickens set many of his novels
in London; one of the most enduring is this story of a boy in
Victorian London who survives an almost comically nightmarish
world of orphanages and crime.
 Saturday, by Ian McEwan: One of McEwan’s latest novels,
Saturday evokes the life of an upper-middle-class family in London
today.
 Watching the English, by Kate Fox: An entertaining pop-psych
book, Watching the English deals humorously with the “hidden
rules” of English behavior as they relate to class and “Englishness.”
 White Teeth, by Zadie Smith: This novel is the profoundly hilari-
ous story of two immigrant families in North London.
The Brits are great filmmakers and beat Hollywood cold when it comes
to honesty in acting, re-creation of period detail, and human-scale cine-
matic storytelling. If you’ve ever watched British television, you know
how completely it differs from American TV. The characters actually
look like human beings and inhabit recognizable worlds.
Over the past 30 years or so, television imports from the BBC and other
U.K. television producers have gained international popularity on
Masterpiece Theatre, Mystery!, and cable channels, winning legions of
fans. Many of these popular series are set in London. They’re available
on video and DVD:
 Absolutely Fabulous: A hilarious, over-the-top sitcom about two
over-the-top women in 1990s London
 Cazalet Chronicles: The fortunes of a middle-class London family
between the world wars
 The Forsythe Saga: An Edwardian tale of family intrigue
 Upstairs, Downstairs: Rich London family above, servants below,
and stories from both sides at the turn of the 20th century
For a cinematic look at London, you may want to check out the following
films:
 About a Boy: You can see a lot of London shots in this well-told
story of a narcissistic Londoner (Hugh Grant) who becomes surro-
gate father to an awkward boy.
 Closer: A chic anomie pervades the lives of four rather unlikable
characters whose lives intersect in London today.
 Darling: In this John Schlesinger film from the 1960s, a young Julie
Christie stars as a fashionable victim of fashion.
 Georgy Girl: The setting is London in the swingin’ ’60s, and a
young, overweight Lynn Redgrave plays a good-hearted oaf living
with a cold-hearted bitch (Charlotte Rampling).
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into London 27

 Love Actually: Londoners deal with contemporary life and
romance in this film starring Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin
Firth, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, and others.
 The Madness of King George: Playwright Alan Bennett wrote 
the brilliant screenplay for this film about King George III and his
bouts with insanity. It features wonderful performances by Nigel
Hawthorne, Helen Mirren, and Rupert Everett.
 Midnight Lace: Doris Day is menaced in London circa 1960 by a
mysterious caller; you can see many shots of the city.
 Notes on a Scandal: Judi Dench is brilliant as an uptight London
teacher who falls in with another teacher, the lovely Cate Blanchett,
only to discover that her new friend is having an affair with one of
her students.
 Notting Hill: In this romantic comedy, Hugh Grant stars as the
owner of a London bookstore and Julia Roberts is an American
movie star (quite a stretch).
 The Queen: Helen Mirren won the Best Actress Oscar in 2007 for
her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II and the crisis following Princess
Diana’s death in 1997.
 Sunday Bloody Sunday: In this adult drama from the early ’70s,
Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch star as Londoners in love with the
same guy.

In This Chapter
 Going in season or out
 Knowing how rainy it really is
 Checking a calendar of special events
L
ondon is one of those cities that’s popular year-round. So popular, 
in fact, that according to VisitBritain (formerly the British Tourist
Authority), more than 15 million tourists from around the globe visited
London in 2005 (the last year for which figures are available).
Arriving in London at any time of year without advance hotel reserva-
tions is not a wise idea. If you plan to visit between April and mid-
October, making hotel reservations in advance is essential. Although you
can find agencies in London that can help you find a hotel or a B&B in
peak season (see Chapter 9), you never know quite what you’re getting
or where it will be, and you will lose some of your precious travel time
making arrangements. In Chapter 9, you can find descriptions of my rec-
ommended London hotels.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
London weather is what you might call “changeable.” Predicting what
the weather will be like in any given season is difficult. England is an
island, after all, and the seas surrounding it, as well as its northerly loca-
tion, determine its weather patterns. In general, however, the climate is
fairly mild year-round, rarely dipping below freezing or rising above 27°C
(80°F), at least for extended periods.
Table 3-1 gives you an idea of London’s temperature and rainfall varia-
tions. But don’t rely on these figures too much: In 2001, London and the
rest of England experienced the coldest and wettest winter and spring
since written records originated in 1659; and in 2007, London and south-
ern England experienced the warmest spring on record. And every
August from 2003 to 2007, the mercury has soared above normal for sev-
eral days and even reached 32°C (100°F).

London can be drizzly, muggy, dry and hot, or clammy. It can also be glo-
rious, with clear skies and gentle breezes, or bone-chillingly cold. Some
days you get a bit of everything: rain, spots of sun, drizzle, clear skies,
and more rain. But whatever the weather, whatever the season, London
is well worth seeing. The following sections let you know what’s happen-
ing in London, season by season, so that you can pick the best time to
go for you.
Abloom in the spring
London is at its green, blooming best in April and May. Highlights of the
season include the following:
 The great London parks and gardens and the surrounding country-
side are at their peak of lushness. The Chelsea Flower Show is the
quintessential spring event.
 Airfares are lower than in summer.
 The sky stays light well into the evening.
Part I: Introducing London 
30

But keep in mind these springtime pitfalls:
 During the half-term school holidays in late February and for three
weeks around Easter, visitors pour into London. As a result, the
major attractions have longer lines (queues in Britspeak), and you
may have a harder time finding a hotel room.
 The weather is always unpredictable.
 Public transportation is reduced during holiday periods.
 Many museums, stores, and restaurants close on Good Friday,
Easter, and Easter Monday (the day after Easter).
Summer fun in the sun
Notoriously chilly London becomes irresistible under the sun. Many
tourists flock to London throughout the summer to enjoy the fine
weather, but that same weather can turn into rain or a fine, gray drizzle
in July and August. The crowds descend in summer for several reasons:
 Everyone moves outdoors at the slightest hint of good weather,
and London buzzes with alfresco theaters, concerts, and festivals
(see Chapter 15).
 The evenings are deliciously long and often cool, even if the day
has been hot.
 The evening stays light until 10 p.m. or even later.
But keep in mind:
 If you believe the weather statistics, July and August are the
months of highest rainfall in London, so skies can stay gray and
cloudy.
 Occasional summer heat waves can drive the mercury toward 30°C,
35°C, and 40°C (the 80s, 90s, and 100s in Fahrenheit), making July
and August hot and muggy. Many businesses and budget-class
hotels don’t have air-conditioning.
 Aggravated by London’s soot, plus gas and diesel fumes, a hot spell
can lead to excessive air pollution.
 Most overseas visitors (30 percent of travelers) converge on the
city from July to September. Lines for major attractions can be
interminably long.
 Airfare sales are rare and tickets are the most expensive during the
summer peak.
 Centrally located hotels are more difficult to come by, and their
high-season rates apply.
 Booking your hotel in advance is essential during this time of year
(see Chapter 9).
Chapter 3: Deciding When to Go 31

Chock-full of culture in the fall
The golden glow of autumn casts a lovely spell over London. The air is
crisp, and the sun gives old stone buildings and church spires a mellow
patina. Fall is my favorite time of year to be in London, and I can think 
of only one disadvantage to counteract the many advantages, which
include the following:
 After mid-September, fewer tourists are around, so the city feels
less crowded and you encounter more Londoners than visitors.
 With the drop in tourism, hotel rates and airfares may go down as
well.
 London’s cultural calendar springs to life.
 Although you may experience rain at this time of year, you’re just
as likely to encounter what Americans call an “Indian summer,” a
late stretch of warm weather and clear skies.
One thing to look out for: Like every season in England, autumn can
bring rain.
Wonderful in winter
Londoners love to be cozy, and there’s no better time for coziness than
winter. Although most overseas visitors to London arrive during the
warmer months, the number of visitors from within the United Kingdom
is highest between January and March. What do they know that you
should know? Consider the points that make winter wonderful:
 London in winter is a bargain. London’s off-season is November 1 to
December 12 and December 25 to March 14. Winter off-season rates
for airfares and hotels can sometimes be astonishingly low — air-
line package deals don’t get any cheaper (see Chapter 5). At these
times, hotel prices can drop by as much as 20 percent. If you arrive
after the Christmas holidays, you can also take advantage of
London’s famous post-Christmas sales (more on these sales in
Chapter 12).
 Although the winter winds may blow, nothing in London stops — in
fact, everything gets busier. The arts — theater, opera, concerts,
and gallery shows — are in full swing.
 London develops a lovely buzz during the Christmas season: The
stores are decorated, lights are lit, carols are sung, special holiday
pantomimes are performed, and the giant Norwegian spruce goes
up in Trafalgar Square.
Naturally, visiting London in the winter has its downside. Consider these
points:
Part I: Introducing London 
32

 Although the Yuletide holidays are always jolly, they also add up to
another peak tourist season from mid-December to Christmas. You
know what that means: bigger crowds and higher prices. The city is
virtually shut down on December 25 and 26 and January 1. Stores,
museums, and other attractions close, and public transportation is
severely curtailed. On December 26 (Boxing Day), you may have
problems finding any kind of open restaurant.
 Wintertime London may be gray and wet for weeks on end; by mid-
winter, the skies get dark by about 3:30 p.m. The English usually
keep their thermostats set quite low, and rather than turn up the
heat, they don their woollies (long underwear). You should do the
same — or be prepared for a chronic case of goose pimples.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
London hums with festivals and special events of all kinds, some harking
back to centuries past. Before you leave for London, write or call Visit-
Britain (see the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book, for addresses
and phone numbers) and request a copy of its monthly London Planner,
which lists major events, including theater and the performing arts.

Part II
Planning Your 
Trip to London

In this part . . .
T
his part is all about the nitty-gritty of trip planning.
Chapter 4 helps you manage the money side of your 
trip — that means planning a workable budget based on real
prices in London and converting your money into English
pounds and pence when you get there; in this chapter, you
can ﬁnd everything you need to know about using ATMs and
credit cards in London, as well as how to save money by fol-
lowing a few cost-cutting tips. Chapter 5 covers your options
for getting to London by plane, train, or boat, and it gives you
some tips on escorted tours and money-saving package tours.
Chapter 6 is full of special trip-planning advice for London-
bound families, seniors, travelers with disabilities, and gays
and lesbians. Chapter 7 goes through some last-minute details,
such as getting a passport, dealing with travel and medical
insurance, staying healthy while you travel, and more.

Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Planning a realistic budget for your trip
 Pricing things in London
 Uncovering hidden expenses
 Using credit cards, traveler’s checks, and ATMs
 Considering money-saving tips
O
kay, you want to go to London. You’re excited and eager to pack,
but can you really afford it? At this point, a financial reality check is
in order. London is an expensive city, no two ways about it. But adding
everything up, a trip to London can cost about the same as (if not more
than) a trip to New York, San Francisco, or Los Angeles.
Planning Your Budget
You can easily budget for your London trip, but holding down costs
while you’re there may be another matter. (The city’s shopping and
dining is so enticing — and expensive.) Table 4-1 gives you an idea of
some basic costs. The sample hotel rates are undiscounted rack rates,
the highest rate you would pay.

Note: As a general rule, except for tips in restaurants and for cab drivers
(10 percent to 15 percent for both), you don’t have to tip excessively in
London. But if you stay in an expensive hotel, give the porters who carry
your bags £1 ($2) per bag and doormen who hail you cabs £1 ($2) per cab.
Transportation
You may think a trip to London is prohibitively expensive because of the
transatlantic flight, but you can often find bargain airfares to this popu-
lar spot that are cheaper than what you’d pay when flying to the farthest
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
42

reaches of your own country. For more specific information on airlines
and airfares, see Chapter 5.
I have some other good news that can save you a bundle: You don’t need
to rent a car in London. (If you want to rent a car to explore the areas
surrounding London, see Chapter 14.) The London Underground (called
the Tube) is fast, convenient, and easy to use. Special reduced-price
transportation passes, called London Travelcards, make getting around
the city relatively inexpensive; see Chapter 8 for more information.
Lodging
The cost of accommodations takes the biggest bite from your budget.
Fortunately, because you have to book your rooms well in advance,
you’ll know this expense before you leave on vacation.
Chapter 8 gives you an idea of London neighborhoods and their suitabil-
ity as your home base. Chapter 9 tells you what you can expect for 
your money, shows you how to get the best rate, and gives you my 
recommended list of top-notch B&Bs and hotels in all price ranges and
locations.
Rates vary considerably according to location and type of hotel or B&B,
so I can’t really give you a reliable average. For the recommendations in
this book, however, the rates are generally £100 and under ($200 and
under) for an inexpensive property, £101 to £150 ($202–$300) for a mod-
erately priced one, £151 to £200 ($302–$400) for an expensive one, and
£201 to £250 ($402–$500) for a very expensive one. After that, you hit the
stratosphere of £251-plus ($502-plus) for a luxury B&B or hotel. Keep in
mind that many midrange London hotels and all B&Bs include at least a
continental breakfast as part of the room rate, so you can save a few
pounds there.
The rack rates that I list are not the lowest, special-deal rates that you’ll
probably be able to find on the hotels’ Web sites. You may be surprised
at how much you can save off the “official” price of a room.
Britain’s version of a sales tax is called the value-added tax (VAT). Brace
yourself: The tax amounts to 17.5 percent. The VAT is part of the reason
that prices in London are so high (that and the strength of the British
pound against the U.S. dollar). The tax is added to the total price of con-
sumer goods (the price on the tag already includes it) and to hotel and
restaurant bills. The VAT is not a hidden expense, but not all quoted
room rates, especially in the luxury tier, include the tax. Be sure to ask
whether your quoted room rate includes the VAT. (In the hotel listings in
Chapter 9, I tell you if the rate doesn’t include the VAT.)
Dining
In recent years, London has emerged as one of the great food capitals of
the world, known for the variety of its restaurants and the overall quality
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 43

of the cooking. With the current exchange rate, I can’t fudge the fact that
eating at the top restaurants costs you more than a pretty penny, but
countless pubs, local restaurants, cafes, and sandwich shops also exist
where you can dine cheaply and well. In addition, many of the best
London restaurants offer two- and three-course fixed-price meals that
can be real bargains. And if your budget is really tight, you can buy take-
out meals at supermarkets for a fraction of what it costs to dine out any-
where in London.
If you eat lunch and dinner at the moderately priced restaurants that I
recommend in Chapter 10, expect to pay £25 to £50 ($50–$100) per
person per day for meals, not including alcoholic drinks (and assuming
that breakfast is included in your hotel rate). If you have breakfast at a
cafe rather than your hotel and are content with coffee and a roll, expect
to pay about £4 to £6 ($8–$12). Depending on the restaurant, an old-
fashioned English breakfast with eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and tea
or coffee can run anywhere from £6 to £12 ($12–$24). Likewise, a simple
afternoon tea at a cafe sets you back about £5 to £7 ($10–$14), but a
lavish high tea at one of the great London hotels will run £25 ($50) or
more. For specifics on restaurants, inexpensive cafes and sandwich
shops, and places for afternoon tea, see Chapter 10.
On top of the VAT, a few restaurants add a service charge of 12.5 percent
to 15 percent to your bill. If they do, the menu and the bill have to state
this policy. This charge amounts to mandatory tipping, so if your credit
card receipt comes back with a space for you to add a tip, put a line
through it.
Sightseeing
Your budget for admission fees depends, of course, on what you want to
see. Some of London’s top attractions are pricey indeed: an adult ticket
to the Tower of London costs £16 ($32). But many other outstanding
attractions in London — the British Museum, National Gallery, National
Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain, and Tate Modern — are completely free.
So are the Natural History Museum, the Science Museum, and the
Victoria & Albert Museum. Strolling through London’s great parks or
viewing Buckingham Palace (okay, from the outside) and the Changing
of the Guard won’t cost you a penny. From my suggestions in Chapter
11, you can weed out the must-see sights from the maybes.
Keep in mind that if you’re a senior or a student, you can often get a
reduced-price admission, and most attractions offer reduced family
rates that are good for two adults and two children. Be sure to bring
some form of photo identification to prove your senior or student status.
Shopping and nightlife
Shopping and entertainment are the most flexible parts of your budget.
You don’t have to buy anything at all, and you can hit the sack right after
dinner instead of seeing a play or dancing at a club. You know what you
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
44

want. Flip through the shopping options in Chapter 12 and the entertain-
ment and nightlife venues in Chapters 15 and 16. If anything strikes you as
something you can’t do without, budget accordingly. (Keep in mind that a
pint in a pub sets you back about £2.50/$5, whereas a theater, opera, or
concert ticket can cost anywhere from £5/$10 to over £50/$100.)
If you’re not a resident of the European Union, you can get a VAT refund
on purchases made in the United Kingdom. (This refund doesn’t include
hotels, restaurants, or entertainment.) See Chapter 12 for details.
Cutting Costs — But Not the Fun
Throughout this book, Bargain Alert icons highlight money-saving tips
and/or great deals. Check out some additional cost-cutting strategies:
 Go in the off-season. If you can travel at non-peak times (Oct to
mid-Dec or Jan to Mar), you’ll find hotel prices can be as much as
20 percent less than during peak months.
 Travel on off days of the week. Airfares vary, depending on the
day of the week. If you can travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or
Thursday, you may find cheaper flights to London. See if you can
get a cheaper rate by flying on a different day.
 Try a package tour. For popular destinations like London, you can
make just one call to a travel agent or packager to book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing. You pay
much less than if you tried to put the trip together yourself (see
Chapter 5).
 Reserve a hotel room with a kitchen. In London, these rooms are
called self-catering units. With your own kitchen, you can do at least
some of your own cooking. You’ll save money by not eating in
restaurants two or three times a day. Parents traveling with small
children may find this strategy particularly useful.
 Always ask for discount rates. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
programs, trade unions, AARP, or other groups may qualify you for
discounts on plane tickets, hotel rooms, or even meals.
 Always ask if any special room rates are in effect. Hotels are
eager to fill their rooms and now offer many different rates, includ-
ing “promotional” rates and lower weekend rates. In most cases,
you’ll find these special rates on the hotel’s Web site.
 Ask if your kids can stay in your room with you. A room with two
double beds usually doesn’t cost any more than one with a queen-
size bed. And many hotels won’t charge you the additional-person
rate if that person is pint-size and related to you. Even if you have
to pay a few pounds extra for a rollaway bed, you save hundreds by
not taking two rooms.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 45

 Use pay phones rather than the phone in your hotel room. You
may find the telephone in your hotel room convenient, but avoid
using it if you’re on a budget. A local call that costs 40p (80¢) at a
phone booth may cost you £1 ($2) or more from your hotel room. If
you plan to make a number of calls during your trip, get a phone
card (see the details about using phones in the Quick Concierge, at
the end of this book) and use pay phones.
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch rather than dinner. At most
top restaurants, prices at lunch are considerably lower than those
at dinner, and the menu often includes many of the dinnertime spe-
cialties. Also, look for the fixed-price menus.
 Buy takeout meals at supermarkets and sandwich shops. If you’re
on a tight budget, skip restaurants and head instead to a nearby
supermarket or sandwich shop. Supermarkets in London and
throughout England sell sandwiches and all manner of “take-away”
meals, so you can create your own picnic.
 Walk a lot. London is large but completely walkable. A good pair of
walking shoes can save you money on taxis and other local trans-
portation. As a bonus, you get to know the city and its inhabitants
more intimately, and you can explore at a slower pace.

Ways to save in London and beyond
With a single, one-way fare on the London Underground currently priced at £4 ($8),
you’ll save lots of money by purchasing a one-day or multi-day Travelcard, good for
unlimited travel on the Underground and buses. In the United States and Canada, you
can buy a London Travelcard before you leave home by contacting a travel agent; by
calling Rail Europe at % 877/272-RAIL in the U.S. or 800/361-7245 in Canada; or by
going to www.raileurope.com. Two kinds of cards are available in U.S. dollars:
the All Zone and the Central Zone, which is good for everything in Central London. Both
cards are available in one-, three-, or seven-day increments. Prices for the Central
Zone card are $15 for adults and $8 for children for one day; $37 for adults and $19 for
children for three days; and $52 for adults and $26 for children for seven days. You can
also buy various money-saving Travelcards at any London Underground station or
ticket machine. These options actually work out to be a bit cheaper. For more infor-
mation on London Travelcards, see Chapter 8.
If you plan to travel around England by train, consider getting a BritRail pass. These
passes offer considerable savings over individual fares, but you must buy them before
you arrive (they aren’t sold in England). You have many options: a choice of either first
or standard class, senior passes for those over 60, travel-time periods from four con-
secutive days to one month, and Flexipasses allowing you to travel a certain number of
days within a set time period. You can also get a London Plus Pass that’s great for day
trips around London. You can find information on the various rail passes in Chapter 14.

 Skip the souvenirs. Your photographs and your memories should
be the best mementos of your trip. If you’re worried about your
budget, do without the T-shirts, key chains, and other trinkets.
Handling Money
Money makes the world go around, but dealing with an unfamiliar cur-
rency can make your head spin. In London, you pay for things in pounds
and pence, meaning you have to convert your own currency into British
pounds sterling. When it comes to carrying money in London, should
you bring traveler’s checks or use ATMs? What about paying with credit
cards? In the following sections, I tell you what you need to know about
each option.
Making sense of pounds and pence
Britain’s unit of currency is the pound sterling (£). Every pound is
divided into 100 pence (p). Coins come in denominations of 1p, 2p, 5p,
10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and £2. Notes are available in £5, £10, £20, and £50
denominations. As with any unfamiliar currency, British pounds and
pence take a bit of getting used to. The coins have different sizes,
shapes, and weights according to value. Each bank note denomination
has its own color and bears a likeness of the queen. All currency is
drawn on the Bank of England.
Exchanging your currency
The exchange rate, which fluctuates every day, is the rate that you get
when you use your own currency to buy pounds sterling (see Table 4-2).
In general, $1 = 50p (or £1 = $2). These are approximate figures, but
they’re what I use for all prices in this guide (rounded to the nearest
dollar if the amount is over $10, and to the nearest nickel of the amount
is under $10). When you’re about to leave on your trip, check with your
bank or look in the newspaper to find out the current rate.

Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 47

Changing money (either cash or traveler’s checks) into a foreign cur-
rency makes many people nervous, especially if they’re changing money
for the first time. You needn’t fear. Changing money is a simple opera-
tion. Just remember that every time you exchange money, you need to
show your passport.
If you want some pounds in hand when you arrive at the airport in
London, you can exchange currency before you leave home at many
banks and at foreign exchange services at international airports.
Otherwise, you can easily change cash or traveler’s checks in London by
using a currency-exchange service called a bureau de change. These
services are available at major London airports, any branch of a major
bank, all major rail and Underground stations in Central London, post
offices, and American Express or Thomas Cook offices. Unless located 
in a bank or travel agency, most bureaux de change are open daily from 
8 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Every major bank in Central London has a foreign currency window
where you can exchange traveler’s checks or cash. Weekday hours for
banks are generally 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., but a few open earlier. Some
banks (usually based in busy shopping areas) are open all day Saturday.
All banks are closed on public holidays, but many branches have 24-
hour banking lobbies with ATMs or ATMs on the street outside. Banks in
London and throughout the United Kingdom include Barclays Bank
(% 020/7441-3200; www.barclays.co.uk), HSBC (% 0845/743-4445;
www.hsbc.com), Midland Bank (% 020/7599-3232; www.midlandnb.
com), and NatWest (% 020/7395-5500; www.natwest.com). These bank-
ing companies all have branches throughout the city.
Reputable London banks and bureaux de change exchange money at a
competitive rate but charge a commission (typically 1 percent to 3 
percent of the total transaction) and a small additional fee (usually
£3/$6). Some currency-exchange services now guarantee you the 
same exchange rate when you return pounds for dollars.
All U.K. bureaux de change and other money-changing establishments
are required to display exchange rates and full details of any fees and
rates of commission with clarity and equal prominence. Rates must be
displayed at or near the entrance to the premises. Rates fluctuate from
place to place, and so do fees, so shopping around sometimes pays.
Steer clear of bureaux de change that offer good exchange rates but
charge a heavy commission (up to 8 percent). You find them in major
tourist sections of London (some are open 24 hours). Some hotels also
cash traveler’s checks, but their commission is often considerably
higher than at a bank or bureau de change. Before exchanging your
money, always check to see the exchange rate, how much commission
you’ll have to pay, and whether additional fees apply.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
48

You can avoid paying a second commission fee by using American
Express traveler’s checks and cashing them at the American Express
office in London at 6 Haymarket, SW1 (% 020/7930-4411; Tube: Picca-
dilly). Its foreign-exchange bureau is open Monday through Friday from
9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Saturday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday from 
10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM.
You’ll find ATMs, or cashpoints as they’re sometimes called in England,
all over London. The Cirrus (% 800/424-7787; www.mastercard.com)
and PLUS (% 800/843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe;
look on the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then
call or check online for ATM locations in London. Be sure that you know
your personal identification number (PIN) before you leave home and
find out your daily withdrawal limit before you depart. Some banks will
allow you to withdraw cash only from your checking account, not from
your savings.
Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time you use
your card at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee may cost more for inter-
national transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones (where
it rarely goes over $1.50). On top of this fee from your bank, the bank
from which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. For international
withdrawal fees, ask your bank.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money. They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days to arrive by mail, though some banks will pro-
vide the number over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden
name or some other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, most banks
assess a 2 percent fee above the 1 percent fee that Visa, MasterCard, and
American Express charge for currency conversion on credit charges. But
credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you factor in things
like exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check exchange rates (and
service fees).
Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
impending trip abroad so that they don’t become suspicious when you
use the card numerous times in a foreign destination and block your
charges. Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance, you
can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 49

refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card may not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary because most cities,
including London, have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash
as needed, with less hassle and with comparable or even cheaper serv-
ice charges. You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. American
Express offers denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and (for cardhold-
ers only) $1,000. You pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4
percent. You can also get American Express traveler’s checks over the
phone by calling % 800/221-7282; Amex gold and platinum cardholders
who use this number are exempt from the 1 percent fee.
Visa offers traveler’s checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as
at several other banks. The service charge ranges between 1.5 percent
and 2 percent; checks come in denominations of $20, $50, $100, $500,
and $1,000. Call % 800/732-1322 or go to www.visa.com for informa-
tion. AAA members can obtain Visa checks without a fee at most AAA
offices, by calling % 866/339-3378. MasterCard also offers traveler’s
checks. Call % 800/223-9920 for a location near you.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks. If the checks are lost or
stolen, you’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Never pay for hotels, meals, or purchases with traveler’s checks denomi-
nated in any currency other than British pounds. You get a bad exchange
rate if you try to use them as cash.
Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report with the
police. In London, call % 192 for directory assistance, free from public
pay phones, to find out the precinct nearest you. Your credit card com-
pany or insurer may require a police report number or record of the
loss. Most credit card companies have an emergency toll-free number to
call if your card is lost or stolen; the company may be able to wire you a
cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency credit card in a day
or two. Call the following emergency numbers in the United Kingdom:
 American Express: % 01273/696-933
 MasterCard: % 01702/362-988
 Visa: % 01604/230-230
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
50

If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 0800/833-833 in the U.K.; www.westernunion.
co.uk).
If you follow four basic rules, you can minimize the risk of a crime hap-
pening to you:
 Don’t keep your wallet in your back pocket or in your backpack,
but do keep it out of sight.
 Don’t leave your purse, briefcase, backpack, or coat unattended in
any public place. This isn’t only to protect you from thieves. In
London, with its stepped-up security, unattended items can be 
confiscated by the police.
 Ladies: Don’t hang your purse over the back of your chair in
crowded or outdoor cafes or restaurants.
 Don’t flash your money or credit cards around.
Chapter 4: Managing Your Money 51
Earning their keep: Royal expenses
Buckingham Palace’s accounts revealed that the overall cost to taxpayers of keeping
the monarchy rose 4.7 percent in 2006 to £37.4 million ($74.8 million), or about 62p ($1.24)
per U.K. resident. Travel expenses accounted for a significant part of the rise. One trip
to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and India by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall,
cost £304,000 ($608,000). Prince Andrew spent more than £355,000 ($710,000) on a series
of visits to destinations including Bermuda, Thailand, and Egypt. He spent £33,405
($66,810) to charter a plane for two days to travel between Bangkok and the resorts of
Hua Hin and Phuket, a two-hour flight with scheduled economy-class seats available
for about £80 ($160) round-trip, and he also spent £11,555 ($23,110) to fly from the Isle
of Man to St. Andrews for a meeting of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club.
British taxpayers paid £400,000 ($800,000) for wine and spirits for the queen’s cellars,
while £300,000 ($600,000) was spent on a new kitchen for Windsor Castle. The cost of
new security measures at Buckingham Palace came to about £150,000 ($300,000).
Utilities for the royal properties totaled £2 million ($4 million), with about £1 million ($2
million) spent on catering and hospitality, including £600,000 ($1,200,000) for garden
parties.
Alan Reid, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, was quoted as saying, “Our key aim is not to
try and achieve a low-cost monarchy. What we’re really after is trying to achieve a
high-quality and very efficient monarchy.” Buckingham Palace pointed out that the
royal family had about 2,700 official engagements across the United Kingdom and over-
seas in 2006.

N
ow that you’ve decided to visit London, you’ll need to find a way
to get there. In this chapter, I discuss your options for direct, non-
stop flights and give you some ideas on how you can save money on
your flight (and your hotel). I’ve also got all the information on reaching

Flying to London
London’s airports are among the busiest in the world, with direct or con-
necting flights from all over the globe. Finding a flight won’t be difficult,
but choosing one from the many that are offered may require some
research and comparison shopping for the lowest fare.
Finding out which airlines fly to London
Most regularly scheduled international flights from the United States,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand arrive at London’s Heathrow and
Gatwick airports. Flights from the Continent land at Heathrow, Gatwick,
Stansted, or London City. Luton, the smallest of London’s five airports, is
a destination for charter flights from the Continent.
Here’s a brief description of each of the London airports and who flies to
them (see the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book, for the contact
information of the airlines in this list):

 Heathrow, the main international airport, is 24km (15 miles) west
of Central London. It’s served by Air Canada (Canadian flights from
Calgary, Montreal, Ottawa, St. John’s, Toronto, and Vancouver); Air
New Zealand (Australian flights from Sydney; New Zealand flights
from Auckland); American (U.S. flights from Boston, Chicago, Los
Angeles, Miami, and New York JFK); British Airways (U.S. flights
from Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Newark, New
York JFK, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington
Dulles; Australian flights from Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and
Sydney; New Zealand flights from Auckland); Continental (U.S.
flights from Los Angeles, Newark, New York JFK, San Francisco, and
Washington Dulles); Icelandair (U.S. flights from Baltimore, Boston,
Minneapolis/St. Paul, and New York JFK); Qantas (Australian flights
from Melbourne, Perth, and Sydney; New Zealand flights from
Auckland); United (U.S. flights from Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles,
Newark, New York JFK, San Francisco, and Washington Dulles); and
Virgin Atlantic (U.S. flights from Chicago, Newark, New York JFK,
San Francisco, and Washington Dulles). For information on getting
into London from Heathrow, see Chapter 8.
 Gatwick is a smaller airport about 40km (25 miles) south of
London. It’s served by American (U.S. flights from Boston, Dallas/
Ft. Worth, and Raleigh/Durham); British Airways (U.S. flights from
Atlanta, Baltimore, Charlotte, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Denver, Houston,
Miami, New York JFK, Orlando, Phoenix, and Tampa); Continental
(U.S. flights from Boston, Cleveland, Houston, Miami, Newark, and
Orlando); Delta (U.S. flights from Atlanta and Cincinnati); North-
west (U.S. flights from Detroit and Minneapolis/St. Paul); Qantas
(Australian flights from Sydney); and Virgin Atlantic (U.S. flights
from Boston, Las Vegas, Miami, Newark, Orlando, and San Fran-
cisco). For information on getting into London from Gatwick, see
Chapter 8.
 Stansted, 80km (50 miles) northeast of London, handles national
and European flights. The Stansted Express train to Liverpool
Street Station takes 45 minutes and costs £15.50 ($31).
 London City, only 10km (6 miles) east of Central London, services
European destinations. A new extension of the Docklands Light
Railway travels from the airport to Bank Street in Central London,
in 22 minutes for £4 ($8); if you’re traveling beyond Bank Street by
Underground, you’ll have to pay an additional fare.
 Luton, 45km (28 miles) northwest of London, services mostly 
charter flights. You can travel by free shuttle bus to Luton Airport
Parkway station, then take a Capital Connection train to King’s
Cross Station in central London for £11 ($22); the trip takes 30 to 
45 minutes.
Chapter 5: Getting to London 53

Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay the premium rate, known
as the full fare. But if you can book your ticket far in advance, stay over
Saturday night, and travel midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qual-
ify for the least expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. The
airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices on
their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase require-
ments and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the prices. As
you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales, which tend
to take place in seasons of low travel volume — in England, that’s basi-
cally October through March. You almost never see a sale around the
peak summer vacation months of July and August, or around Thanks-
giving or Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare they
have to pay.
Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Bucket-shop tickets are usually nonrefundable or rigged with stiff cancel-
lation penalties, often as high as 50 percent to 75 percent of the ticket
price, and some put you on charter airlines with questionable safety
records.
Several reliable consolidators are worldwide and available online, and
most of them offer flights to London. STA Travel (% 800/781-4040;
www.statravel.com), the world’s leader in student travel, offers good
fares for travelers of all ages. ELTExpress (% 800/872-8800; www.
flights.com) started in Europe and has excellent fares worldwide.
Flights.com also has “local” Web sites in 12 countries. FlyCheap (% 800/
FLY-CHEAP; www.1800flycheap.com) is owned by package-holiday
megalith MyTravel and has especially good access to fares for interna-
tional destinations. Air Tickets Direct (% 800/778-3447; www.air
ticketsdirect.com) is based in Montreal.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
54

can visit www.expedia.co.uk and www.opodo.co.uk; Australians and
New Zealanders should try www.expedia.com.au.) Each agency has dif-
ferent business deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on
the same flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity
will also send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes
available to your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web
sites, SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users.
It’s a browser add-on that purports to search over 100 sites at once.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some can be booked weeks or months
in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at airline Web sites or check
mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists of last-minute specials,
such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com). For last-minute
trips, www.lastminute.com often has better deals than the major-label
sites.
If you’re willing to give up some control over your flight details, use an
opaque fare service like Priceline (www.priceline.com) or Hotwire
(www.hotwire.com). Both services offer rock-bottom prices in exchange
for travel on a “mystery airline” at a mysterious time of day, often with a
mysterious change of planes en route. The mystery airlines are all major,
well-known carriers — and the possibility of being sent from Philadel-
phia to Chicago via Salt Lake City is remote. But your chances of getting
a 6 a.m. or 11 p.m. flight are pretty high. Hotwire tells you flight prices
before you buy; Priceline usually has better deals than Hotwire, but you
have to play their “name our price” game. Note: Priceline does have a
non-opaque service in its roster. You have the option to pick exact flights,
times, and airlines from a list of offers — or opt to bid on opaque fares.
Arriving by Other Means
If you’re traveling to London from another destination in Europe, you
don’t have to fly to get there. Train and car ferries and high-speed hover-
crafts cross the English Channel throughout the year from ports in
France, Holland, and Belgium. And the Eurostar high-speed train zips
beneath the channel through the Chunnel, a tunnel beneath the English
Channel.
Taking the train
London has several train stations, and the one you arrive at depends on
your point of departure from the Continent. The three-hour Eurostar
service connecting Paris and Brussels to London via the Chunnel arrives
at King’s Cross/St. Pancras Station. Trains from Amsterdam arrive at
Liverpool Street Station. Other London train stations include Euston,
Waterloo, Paddington, and Victoria stations.
Chapter 5: Getting to London 55

Several types of Eurostar fares are available. Senior fares for those over
60 and youth fares for those under 26 can cut the price of a first-class
fare by 20 percent or more. The same reductions apply for passengers
traveling with validated Eurail and BritRail passes. To check out current
and special promotional fares for Eurostar, visit RailEurope’s Web site at
www.raileurope.com.
The trains in England and the rest of the United Kingdom are separate
from those in continental Europe, so a Eurail pass isn’t valid in the U.K. If
you’re going to travel within England or the rest of the United Kingdom,
check out the various BritRail passes available (see Chapter 14 for more
information).
For more information on train schedules, routes, and fares throughout
England, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk or call % 0845/484-950.
Riding a ferry or hovercraft
Crossing times for the car, train, and passenger ferries that regularly
crisscross the English Channel can be anywhere from 90 minutes to 5
hours, depending on the point of departure. Various hovercrafts (high-
speed ferries with propellers that lift them off the surface of the water)
skim over the water in as little as half an hour. Frequent train service to
London is available from all the channel ports. The following is a list of
the major ferry and hovercraft companies:
 Norfolk Line (% 0870/870-1020 in the U.K.; www.norfolkline-
ferries.com) accepts motorists only — no foot passengers — on
its ferries between Dover, England, and Dunkerque, France (cross-
ing time in 13⁄4 hours).
 P&O Ferries (% 0870/598-0333 in the U.K.; www.poferries.com)
offers daily ferry/car crossings between Cherbourg and Ports-
mouth (crossing time is 5 hours) and Le Havre and Portsmouth 
(51⁄2 hours) and between Calais and Dover (11⁄4 hours).
 Sea France Limited (% 0871/663-2546 in the U.K.; www.sea
france.co.uk) runs ferries between Dover and Calais (crossing
time is 11⁄2 hours).
Joining an Escorted Tour
Some people love escorted tours. The tour company takes care of all the
details and tells you what to expect at each leg of your journey. You
know your costs upfront and don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours
can take you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount
of time with the least amount of hassle.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
56

If you decide to go with an escorted tour, I strongly recommend purchas-
ing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour oper-
ator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obliga-
tions either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. 
(You can find out more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in
Chapter 7.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if they don’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the tour
operator cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not returning to your
hotel until 7 or 8 p.m. sounds like a grind, certain escorted tours
may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size, and the tour operator may cancel the tour if it doesn’t
book enough people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how
close the operator is to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be
evasive in their answers, but the information may help you select a
tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have 
to pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included, but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Here are two companies that offer escorted tours to London and the rest
of England (with prices per person, based on double occupancy):
 Globus and Cosmos (www.globusandcosmos.com) are well-known
budget tour companies working in partnership. Current offerings
include a four-day/three-night tour of London starting at $499 and
an eight-day/seven-night tour starting at $799, airfare not included.
Chapter 5: Getting to London 57

 Trafalgar Tours (www.trafalgartours.com) provides tours to
London and the rest of the United Kingdom. Prices for the Week in
London tour start at $1,055, airfare not included. The company also
offers an eight-day London, Stratford & Bath tour starting at $1,060,
airfare not included.
Choosing a package tour
For a lot of destinations, including London, package tours can be a smart
way to go. In many cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and
transportation to and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on
a tour that you book yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk
to tour operators, who resell them to the public.
Package tours vary greatly in what they provide. Some offer a better
class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for lower
prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In
some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days may be
limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and independ-
ent vacations; others allow you to add on a few excursions or escorted
day trips (also at discounted prices).
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines, such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (% 888/271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of
the biggest packagers in the northeastern United States and usually
boasts a full-page ad in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. 
Most major airlines offer air/land packages. Several big online travel
agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, and Lastminute.com — also 
do a brisk business in packages.
Locating package tours
Information about package tours is available from a variety of sources.
Here are a few companies that offer packages to England:
 British Travel International (% 727/653-5710; www.british
travel.com) is a good source for discount packages.
 Liberty Travel (% 888/271-1584; www.libertytravel.com), one
of the biggest packagers in the northeastern United States, offers
reasonably priced packages.
 Trailfinders (www.trailfinders.com), another good source 
for discount packages, has several offices in Australia: Brisbane 
(% 07/3229-0887), Cairns (% 07/4041-1199), Melbourne (% 03/
9600-3022), Perth (% 08/9226-1222), and Sydney (% 02/9247-7666).

Checking out airline and hotel packages
Airlines are good sources for package tours because they package their
flights together with accommodations. The following airlines offer pack-
ages to London:
 American Airlines Vacations (% 800/321-2121; www.aa
vacations.com)
 British Airways Holidays (% 800/247-9297; www.baholidays.

Catering to Special 
Needs or Interests
In This Chapter
 Visiting London with children
 Getting discounts and special tours for seniors
 Locating wheelchair-accessible attractions
 Finding lesbian- and gay-friendly communities and special events
M
any of today’s travelers have special needs or interests. Parents
may want to take their children along on trips. Seniors may be
looking for special discounts or tours designed especially for them.
People with disabilities want to ensure that sites on their itineraries
offer wheelchair access. And gays and lesbians may want to know about
welcoming places and events. In response to these needs, this chapter
offers advice and resources.
Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Traveling with children, from toddlers to teens, is a challenge — no
doubt about it. Bringing the brood can put a strain on the budget and
influence your choices of activities and hotels. But in the end, isn’t shar-
ing your experiences as a family great?
Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. I use it to
highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are particularly family
friendly. Zeroing in on these places can help you plan your trip more
quickly and easily.
In addition, the following resources can help you plan your trip:
 About Family Travel (3555 S. Pacific Hwy., Medford, OR 97501; 
% 541/778-2022; www.about-family-travel.com) can tailor 
a tour specifically for families traveling to London. Its services
include arranging airfares, hotel rooms, transportation, and theater
tickets, as well as providing tips on sights and destinations. Don’t

rely on its free online London information, however, because it
hasn’t been updated in years.
 Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com) is a com-
prehensive site that offers customized trip planning.
 Kids Love London (http://kids.visitlondon.com), by the
London Tourist Board, is a site created to give kids the lowdown 
on kid-friendly attractions, events, restaurants, and more.
 TravelWithYourKids.com (www.travelwithyourkids.com) is
another comprehensive site full of sound advice for long-distance
and international travel with children.
Admission prices for most London attractions are generally reduced for
children 5 to 16 years old. Children under 5 almost always get in for free.
If you’re traveling with one or two children, always check to see whether
the attraction offers a money-saving family ticket, which considerably
reduces the admission price for a group of two adults and two children.
Locating family-friendly accommodations 
and restaurants
Most hotels will happily accommodate your family if you reserve your
rooms in advance and make the staff aware that you’re traveling with
kids. The establishment may bring in an extra cot or let you share a
larger room; these types of arrangements are common. Smaller bed-and-
breakfasts (B&Bs) may present problems, such as cramped rooms and
shared toilet facilities, and some places don’t accept children at all. Ask
questions before you reserve.
To keep costs down, you can rent a hotel room with a kitchen (in England
these rooms are called self-catering units) and prepare your own meals.
Another option, when the weather cooperates, is to take the family on a
picnic. Kensington Gardens or Hyde Park may be just the ticket for an
enjoyable afternoon (see Chapter 10 for more suggestions). You can also
take advantage of pre-theater, fixed-price menus (usually 5:30–7 p.m.),
which usually give you a good deal.
London has plenty of American-style fast food places, including Burger
King, KFC, McDonald’s, and Pizza Hut. Teens may want to check out 
the Hard Rock Cafe in Mayfair or the scene at the Pepsi Trocadero
in Piccadilly Circus, which offers theme restaurants such as Planet
Hollywood and the Rainforest Café (see Chapter 10). London is also a
good place to introduce more adventurous kids to Chinese or Indian cui-
sine, or to the communal dining experience offered by Wagamama
Japanese noodle restaurants.
Expensive restaurants are sometimes less welcoming toward young chil-
dren. The menus aren’t geared to the tastes of youngsters, the prices
can be high, and the staff may be less than accommodating.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 61

Planning your trip together
Letting your younger children read Peter Pan or Peter Pan in Kensington
Gardens, and telling them about his statue there, can generate excite-
ment about the trip. Slightly older children may want to read the Harry
Potter series, which takes place in real and fictional settings in London
and around the country. (If your kids have already read the Harry Potter
series, they know that Harry lives just south of London — in fact, he
leaves from King’s Cross Station to go off to sorcerer’s school.) With the
information in this book and some online investigating, you can also
incite your kids’ curiosity about historic sites such as the Tower of
London and the Prime Meridian line at Greenwich. And most young
people enjoy the prospect of a meal at the Hard Rock Cafe or a trip to
Madame Tussaud’s wax museum.
Some kid and adult activities can easily overlap. You may want to spend
one afternoon in Kensington Gardens. After the entire family visits Ken-
sington Palace, the kids can blow off steam in the new Princess Diana
Memorial Playground. Many kid-oriented activities in London are just
as interesting for parents. From the fantastic dinosaur exhibit in the
Natural History Museum to the animatronic robots re-creating historic
scenes at Madame Tussaud’s, you and your kids have plenty to experi-
ence and enjoy together.
Preparing for a long trip
The shortest trip from the United States to London (from New York) is
about 6 hours; airtime from Australia may be 25 hours, which is a lot of
time for kids to sit still and be quiet. Although children can spend some
of the journey time watching a movie (or two) on the plane, come pre-
pared with extra diversions: games, puzzles, books — whatever you
know will keep your kids entertained. If your child needs baby food,
bring your own and ask a flight attendant to warm it. Dealing with jet lag
can be hard on adults but even harder on small children. Don’t schedule
too much for your first day in London. Get everyone comfortably settled
and then take it from there.
Hiring a baby sitter while on your trip
What you really need is a relaxing evening at the opera and a romantic
late dinner. But you can’t take Junior along. What are your options? Ask
your hotel staff if they can recommend a local babysitting service. Most
of the hotels marked with a Kid Friendly icon in Chapter 9 can arrange
for babysitting. London also has several respected and trustworthy
babysitting agencies that provide registered nurses and carefully
screened mothers, as well as trained nannies, to watch children. One 
old and trustworthy babysitting service is Universal Aunts (% 020/
7386-8937; www.universalaunts.co.uk), which charges £11 ($22) per
daytime hour, £9 ($18) from 6 p.m. to midnight (three-hour minimum),
plus a £19 ($38) agency fee.

A fully licensed 24-hour childcare facility, Pippa Pop-ins (430 Fulham
Rd., SW6 1DU; % 020/7731-1445; www.pippapopins.com), in Chelsea,
provides a lovely toy-filled nursery staffed by experienced caregivers
where you can safely park the little ones. Call for rates. Another branch
is located in Fulham at 165 New Kings Rd., SW6 (same phone number).
Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
London won’t present any problems for you if you’re a senior who gets
around easily. If you do have mobility issues, be aware when you plan
your trip that not all hotels — particularly less expensive B&Bs — have
elevators. The steep staircases in some places are a test for anyone with
luggage. When you reserve a hotel, ask whether you’ll have access to a
lift (an elevator in Britspeak).
In most cities, including London, being a senior often entitles you to
some terrific travel bargains, such as reduced admissions at theaters,
museums, and other attractions. Carrying ID with proof of age can pay
off in all these situations. Note: In London and throughout the United
Kingdom, you may find that some senior discounts are available only to
U.K. residents. But always ask, even if the reduction isn’t posted.
The following sources can provide information on discounts and other
benefits for seniors:
 AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons; 601
E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049; % 800/424-3410; www.aarp.org)
offers member discounts on car rentals and hotels. AARP offers $13
yearly memberships that include discounts on flights to London
when booked through the AARP Web site.
 Elderhostel (11 Ave. de Lafayette, Boston, MA 02110-1746; % 877/
426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) offers people 55 and older a
variety of university-based educational programs in London and
throughout England. These courses are value-packed, hassle-free
ways to learn while traveling. The price includes airfare, accommo-
dations, meals, tuition, tips, and insurance. And you’ll be glad to
know that you don’t receive any grades. Popular London offerings
have included “Inside the Parliament,” “Legal London,” “Classical
Music and Opera in London,” and “Treasures of London Galleries.”
 Grand Circle/Overseas Adventure Travel (347 Congress St.,
Boston, MA 02210; % 800/959-0405; www.gct.com) is another
agency that offers mature travelers tours to England.
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 63

Accessing London: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
More options and resources are available for disabled travelers than
ever before. In London, most hotels and restaurants happily accom-
modate people with disabilities. London’s top sights are wheelchair
accessible. Theaters and performing arts venues are usually wheelchair
accessible as well (always call first to make arrangements and get direc-
tions to special entrances and elevators).
Persons with disabilities are often entitled to special discounts at sight-
seeing and entertainment venues in Britain. These discounts are called
concessions (often shortened to concs).
Before departing on your trip, contact VisitBritain (see the Quick
Concierge, at the end of this book, for addresses and phone numbers) 
to request a copy of its “Disabled Traveler Fact Sheet,” which contains
some helpful general information. Access in London is the best and most
comprehensive London guide for people with disabilities and anyone
with a mobility problem. The book provides full access information for
all the major sites, hotels, and modes of transportation. You can order it
at www.accessinlondon.org or from major online booksellers.
The United Kingdom has several information resources for disabled trav-
elers. The best of these resources include the following:
 Artsline (% 020/7388-2227; www.artsline.org.uk) provides
advice on the accessibility of London arts and entertainment
events.
 The Society of London Theatres (32 Rose St., London WC2E 9ET;
www.officiallondontheatre.co.uk) offers a free guide called
Access Guide to London’s West End Theatres.
 Holiday Care/Tourism for All Holidays Ltd. (7th Floor, Sunley
House, 4 Bedford Park, Croyden, Surrey CR0 2AP; % 0845/124-
9971 in the U.K. or 020/8760-0072 outside the U.K.; www.holiday
care.org.uk) offers information and advice on suitable accommo-
dations, transportation, and other facilities in England.
 The National Trust (% 020/7447-6742; www.nationaltrust.org.
uk) is a British organization that owns and operates hundreds of
historic properties (castles, gardens, and more) throughout
England. For details on accessibility at each site, download the
“National Trust Access Guide” from its Web site. Although not all
National Trust sites are accessible, the organization provides pow-
ered four-wheeled vehicles free of charge at more than 50 proper-
ties; you can drive yourself or have a companion or volunteer drive
for you.

64

 Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR; 12
City Forum, 250 City Rd., London EC14 8AF; % 020/7250-3222;
www.radar.org.uk) publishes information for disabled travelers
in Britain.
Some other helpful resources in the United States include the following:
 American Foundation for the Blind (11 Penn Plaza, Suite 300, New
York, NY 10001; % 800/232-5463; www.afb.org) offers information
on traveling with Seeing Eye dogs; the foundation also issues ID
cards to the legally blind.
 The Society for Accessible Travel & Hospitality (347 Fifth Ave.,
Suite 610, New York, NY 10016; % 212/447-7284; www.sath.org) is
a membership organization with names and addresses of tour oper-
ators specializing in travel for the disabled. You can call to sub-
scribe to its magazine, Open World.
 Travel Information Service (www.mossresourcenet.org) pro-
vides general information and resources for the disabled traveler.
Joining escorted tours
You can find tours designed to meet the needs of travelers with disa-
bilities. One of the best operators is Flying Wheels Travel (143 West
Bridge, P.O. Box 382, Owatonna, MN 55060; % 507/451-5005; www.
flyingwheelstravel.com), which offers various escorted tours and
cruises, as well as private tours in minivans with lifts.
Here are some other tour operators for London-bound travelers with 
disabilities:
 Accessible Journeys (% 800/846-4537; www.disabilitytravel.
com) offers tours of Britain and London in minibuses or motor
coaches.
 The Guided Tour (% 800/783-5841; e-mail: gtour400@aol.com)
has one- and two-week guided tours for individuals, with one staff
member for every three travelers.
 Undiscovered Britain (11978 Audubon Place, Philadelphia, PA
19116; % 215/969-0542; www.undiscoveredbritain.com) pro-
vides specialty travel and tours for individuals, small groups, or
families traveling with a wheelchair user.
Dealing with access issues
In October 2004, Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act — which
requires anyone offering a service to remove physical barriers that pre-
vent disabled people from accessing it — went into effect throughout
the U.K. What this means is that more and more businesses have
become accessible, and access in general is easier than ever before.
Don’t assume, however, that all hotels and restaurants in London 
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 65

provide wheelchair ramps. Most of the less expensive B&Bs and older
hotels don’t have elevators, or the elevators are too small for a wheel-
chair. Ask about this when you reserve your room or table.
All the top sights and many of the attractions in Chapter 11 are wheel-
chair accessible, but in some cases you must use a different entrance.
Call the attraction to find out about special entrances, ramps, elevator
locations, and general directions. Theaters and performing arts venues
are often wheelchair accessible, as well (again, call first).
Trains throughout the United Kingdom now have wide doors, grab 
rails, and provisions for wheelchairs. The National Rail Web site (www.
nationalrail.co.uk) has a section on disabled travel and contact
information for the various train operating companies.
Disabled travelers will want to keep the following in mind when traveling
around London:
 Although London’s streets and sidewalks are generally kept in good
repair, the city is old and not all streets have modern curb cuts.
 Not all the city’s Underground (subway) stations have elevators
and ramps.
 Low-floor wheelchair-accessible buses serve most stations in
London.
 The city’s black cabs are roomy enough for wheelchairs.
 Victoria Coach Station in Central London has Braille maps.
The following organizations provide access information and services for
disabled travelers in London:
 Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk) pub-
lishes a free brochure called “Tube Access,” which helps travelers
with disabilities plan a Tube journey, avoiding stairs and escala-
tors. You can obtain this brochure at Underground stations in
London.
 Wheelchair Travel (1 Johnston Green, Guildford, Surrey GU2 6XS;
% 1483/233-640 within the U.K. or 1483/237-668 from outside the
U.K.; www.wheelchair-travel.co.uk) is an independent trans-
port service for the disabled traveler arriving in London. The
organization offers self-drive cars and minibuses (although I
strongly discourage anyone, disabled or not, from driving in
London) and can provide wheelchairs. Drivers who also act as
guides are also available on request. Bring your own disabled 
stickers and permits from home if you’re going to rent a self-drive
vehicle.

Taking health precautions
Before you leave on your trip, talk to your physician about your general
physical condition and your prescriptions for the time you’re traveling,
the medical equipment that you need to take, and how to get medical
assistance when you’re away. Carry all prescription medicines in their
original bottles with the contents clearly marked, along with a letter
from your doctor.
Make a list of the generic names of your prescription drugs, in case you
need to replace or refill them during your visit. Pack medications in your
hand luggage. If you use a wheelchair, have a maintenance check before
your trip.
Following the Rainbow: Gay 
and Lesbian Travelers
London has always been a popular destination for gays and lesbians,
even in the days (prior to 1967) when homosexuality was a criminal
offense in Britain. Today, with a more tolerant government at the helm
and civil partnerships offering same-sex couples the same rights as het-
erosexual couples, gay pride is prominent. The city government actually
spends money to promote gay tourism. You can find gay theaters, gay
shops, more than 100 gay pubs, famous gay discos, and gay community
groups of all sorts. The official Visit London Web site (www.visit
london.com) has information on gay venues and events in London.
Old Compton Street in Soho is the heart of London’s Gay Village, 
filled with dozens of gay pubs, restaurants, and upscale bars/cafes. The
Earl’s Court area, long a gay bastion, is home to many gay pubs and
restaurants.
Lesbigay events in London include the London Lesbian and Gay Film
Festival in March, the Pride Parade and celebrations in June, and the
big outdoor bash known as Summer Rites in August. You can obtain
information and exact dates from the London Lesbian and Gay
Switchboard at % 020/7837-7324 or online at www.llgs.org.uk.
Brighton (which I describe in Chapter 14) is one of the gayest seaside
resort towns in Europe. From London, you can get to Brighton on the
train in under an hour.
You may want to check out the following Web sites as you plan your trip.
All are specifically geared to gay and lesbian travelers to London and the
United Kingdom:
 Gay Britain Network: www.gaybritain.co.uk
 Gay London: www.gaylondon.co.uk
Chapter 6: Catering to Special Needs or Interests 67

 Pink Passport: www.pinkpassport.co.uk
 UK Gay Guide: www.gayguide.co.uk
In addition, several gay magazines, useful for their listings and news cov-
erage, are available in gay pubs, clubs, bars, and cafes. The most popu-
lar are Pink Paper (www.pinkpaper.com), Boyz (www.boyz.co.uk), and
QX (Queer Xtra; www.qxmagazine.com). Gay Times (www.gaytimes.
co.uk), a high-quality, monthly, news-oriented mag, is available at most
news agents. Indispensable for its citywide listings (including gay list-
ings), Time Out (www.timeout.com), with gay and lesbian listings,
appears at newsstands on Wednesdays.
Gay’s the Word (66 Marchmont St., WC1; % 020/7278-7654; www.gays
theword.co.uk; Tube: Russell Square), the city’s only all-around gay
and lesbian bookstore, was still open as of press time — but it was
“under threat” and in danger of closing. The store stocks a fine selection
of new and used books and current periodicals.

 Taking care of your health: Medications and emergencies
 Using cellphones and e-mail in London
 Getting through airport security
B
efore you depart for London to take that boat ride on the River
Thames or visit the Tower of London, you need to take care of
some final details. Do you have an up-to-date passport? Have you taken
steps to meet your health needs while you’re on your trip? Are you won-
dering how to use a cellphone or access e-mail while in London? Do you
think you need to rent a car? This chapter gives you the information you
need to answer those lingering questions.
Getting a Passport
A valid passport is the only legal form of identification accepted around
the world. You can’t cross an international border without one. Getting a
passport is easy, but the process takes some time.
The U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Consular Affairs maintains
http://travel.state.gov, a Web site that provides everything you
ever wanted to know about passports (including a downloadable appli-
cation), Customs, and other government-regulated aspects of travel.
Applying for a U.S. passport
If you’re applying for a first-time passport, follow these steps:
1. Complete a passport application in person at a U.S. passport 
office; a federal, state, or probate court; or a major post office. 
To find your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State
Department Web site (http://travel.state.gov) or call the

National Passport Information Center (% 877/487-2778) for auto-
mated information.
2. Present a certified birth certificate as proof of citizenship.
(Bringing along your driver’s license, state or military ID, or Social
Security card is also a good idea.) If you’re a naturalized citizen of
the United States, you’ll have to provide your Naturalization
Certificate or Certificate of Citizenship as proof.
3. Submit two identical passport-size photos, measuring 2 x 2 inches
in size. You often find businesses that take these photos near a
passport office. Note: You can’t use a strip from a photo vending
machine because the pictures aren’t identical.
4. Pay a fee. For people 16 and over, a passport is valid for ten years
and costs $97. For children 15 and under, a passport is valid for five
years and costs $82.
Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; standard
processing in 2007 took 10 to 12 weeks. Expedited service, which
requires an additional fee, takes 2 to 3 weeks. If you use the expedited
service, it’s also a good idea to arrange overnight delivery (for an extra
charge) to send your passport application and receive your passport.
If you have a passport in your current name that was issued within the
past 15 years (and you were over age 15 when it was issued), you can
renew the passport by mail for $67. Whether you’re applying in person
or by mail, you can download passport applications from the U.S. State
Department Web site at http://travel.state.gov. For general infor-
mation, call the National Passport Agency (% 202/647-0518). To find
your regional passport office, either check the U.S. State Department
Web site or call the National Passport Information Center (% 877/
487-2778) for automated information.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers information for citizens of Australia, Canada,
and New Zealand:
 Australians can visit a local post office or passport office, call the
Australia Passport Information Service (% 131-232 toll-free from
Australia), or log on to www.passports.gov.au for details on how
and where to apply.
 Canadians can pick up applications at passport offices throughout
Canada; at post offices; or from the central Passport Office (Depart-
ment of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A
0G3; % 800/567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Applications must be
accompanied by two identical passport-size photographs and proof
of Canadian citizenship. Processing takes five to ten days if you
apply in person or about three weeks if you apply by mail.

 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any New
Zealand Passports Office or download it from the office’s Web site.

04/474-8100, or log on to www.passports.govt.nz.
Entering England with your passport
If you’re a citizen of the United States, Canada, Australia, or New Zealand,
you must have a passport with at least six months remaining until its
expiration to enter the United Kingdom. You need to show your passport
at the Customs and immigration area when you arrive at a U.K. airport.
After your passport is stamped, you can remain in the United Kingdom
as a tourist for up to three months. No visa is required if you’re going to
stay in England or the rest of the United Kingdom for less than three
months.
Keep your passport with you at all times. You need to show it only when
you’re converting traveler’s checks or foreign currency at a bank or cur-
rency exchange. However, you may be asked to present your passport 
to the hotel clerk when you check in; after examining it, the clerk will
return the passport to you. If you’re not going to need your passport for
currency exchanges, ask whether the hotel has a safe where you can
keep it locked up; there may be a safe in your room.
Dealing with a (gulp!) lost passport
Don’t worry; if you lose your passport in England, you won’t be sent to
the Tower of London, but you need to take steps to replace it immedi-
ately. First, notify the police. Then go to your consulate or high commis-
sion office (they’re all located in London — you’ll find addresses and
phone numbers in the Quick Concierge, at the end of this book). Bring
all available forms of identification, and the staff can get started on gen-
erating your new passport. Always call first to verify the hours.
Before leaving on your trip, make a few photocopies of your passport
photo page. Leave one copy with someone staying at home, and keep
another copy with you on your trip, separate from your actual passport.
If you do lose your passport, bring the copy to your consulate. It may
help speed up the process of getting a new passport.
Renting a Car in London — Not!
Having a car in London is more trouble than it’s worth for the following
reasons:
 Maneuvering through London’s congested and complicated maze of
streets can be an endurance test even for Londoners.
 Finding your way through the city in heavy traffic while driving on
the left-hand side of the road when you’re used to driving on the
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 71

right-hand side can turn even the best driver into a gibbering nut
case.
 Parking is difficult to find and expensive (street meters cost £1/$2
for 20 minutes).
 Congestion pricing (road tolls) makes driving in and out of Central
London pricey.
 Gas (petrol in Britspeak) costs about £1 per liter (or approximately
$8 a gallon).
 Public transportation — especially the Tube — will get you every-
where you want to go at a fraction of the cost.
Do yourself a favor: Forget about renting a car. If you want to be with
Londoners on their own turf (or in their own tunnels), the Tube (Under-
ground) is a great way to do it. Even if you’re planning excursions out-
side London, the trains are a better option. (However, see Chapter 14 for
details on renting a car for day-tripping.)
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of travel insur-
ance varies widely, depending on the cost and length of your trip, your
age and health, and the type of trip that you’re taking, but expect to pay
between 5 percent and 8 percent of the vacation itself. Here’s my advice
on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowed reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel.
 For travel overseas, most health plans (including Medicare and
Medicaid) do not provide coverage. Even if your plan does cover
overseas treatment, most out-of-country hospitals, including those
in England, make you pay your bills upfront and send you a refund
only after you’ve returned home and filed the necessary paperwork
with your insurance company. As a safety net, you may want to 
buy travel medical insurance. If you require additional medical
insurance, try MEDEX Assistance (% 410/453-6300; www.medex
assist.com) or Travel Assistance International (% 800/821-
2828; www.travelassistance.com).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
72

 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up
to approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items
more valuable than the standard liability, see if your valuables 
are covered by your homeowner’s policy, get baggage insurance 
as part of your comprehensive travel insurance package, or 
buy Travel Guard’s BagTrak product. Don’t buy insurance at the 
airport — it’s usually overpriced. Be sure to take any valuables or
irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage, because
many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended
insurers: Access America (% 866/807-3982; www.accessamerica.
com); Travel Guard International (% 800/826-4919; www.travel
guard.com); Travel Insured International (% 800/243-3174; www.
travelinsured.com); or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888/
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).

Coping with jet lag
Jet lag is a pitfall of traveling across time zones. If you’re flying north–south and you
feel sluggish when you touch down, your symptoms will be the result of dehydration
and the general stress of air travel. When you travel east–west or vice versa, how-
ever, your body becomes thoroughly confused about what time it is, and everything
from your digestive system to your brain is knocked for a loop. Traveling east — say,
from Chicago to London — is more difficult on your internal clock than traveling 
west — say, from London to Atlanta — because your body is likely more inclined to
stay up late than fall asleep early.
Here are some tips for combating jet lag:
 Reset your watch to your destination time before you board the plane.
 Drink lots of water before, during, and after your flight, and avoid alcohol on the
plane.
 Exercise and sleep well for a few days before your trip.
 If you have trouble sleeping on planes, fly eastward on morning flights.
Daylight is the key to resetting your body clock. At the Web site for Outside In (www.
bodyclock.com), you can get a customized plan of when to seek and avoid light.

Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so I strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time I checked, the bugs weren’t listening to me any more
than they probably listen to you.)
For travel abroad, you may have to pay all medical costs upfront and be
reimbursed later. For information on purchasing additional medical
insurance for your trip, see the preceding section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart prob-
lems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888/633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour
hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical Assistance 
to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716/754-4883 in the U.S. or 416/652-0137 in
Canada; www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in the
countries that you’re visiting.
Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-Mail
The three letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities
are GSM (Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that
makes for easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and
dozens of other countries worldwide. In the United States, T-Mobile and
AT&T Wireless use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell and
some Rogers customers are GSM; and all Europeans and most Australians
use GSM.

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s known in the world of flying, “economy-class syn-
drome,” is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition
that can be caused by sitting in cramped conditions — such as an airplane cabin —
for too long. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include leg pain or swelling, or even
shortness of breath.
During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and stretch your
legs every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventive measures
include frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and avoiding
alcohol and sleeping pills.
If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart disease, or another condition that
puts you at high risk, some experts recommend wearing compression stockings or
taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask your physician about the best course
for you.

If your cellphone is on a GSM system, and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across developed areas through-
out much of the world, from Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless
operator and ask for international roaming to be activated on your
account. Unfortunately, per-minute charges can be high — usually $1 to
$1.50 in England and Western Europe.
That’s why it’s important to buy an unlocked world phone from the get-
go. Many cellphone operators sell locked phones that restrict you from
using any removable computer memory phone chip (called a SIM card)
other than the ones they supply. Having an unlocked phone allows you
to install a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in England.
(Show your phone to the salesperson; not all phones work on all net-
works.) You’ll get a local phone number — and much, much lower call-
ing rates. If you’re staying in England for an extended period of time,
buying a prepaid British SIM card may be your best bet. Getting an
already locked phone unlocked can be a complicated process, but it can
be done; just call your cellular operator and say you’ll be going abroad
for several months and want to use the phone with a local provider.
For many people, renting a phone is a good idea. Although you can rent
a phone from any number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports
and at car rental agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you leave
home. That way, you can give loved ones and business associates your
new number, make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever
you go — especially helpful for overseas trips through several countries,
where local phone rental agencies often bill in local currency and may
not let you take the phone to another country.
However, phone rental isn’t cheap. You’ll usually pay $40 to $50 per
week, plus airtime fees of at least $1 a minute. If you’re traveling to
England, though, local rental companies often offer free incoming calls
within their home country, which can save you big bucks. The bottom
line: Shop around.

Rent-a-phone (% 800/400-7221 in the U.S. or 0800/317-540 in the U.K.) 
is an international cellphone rental company with offices in the United
States and United Kingdom; per-minute charges from England are gener-
ally about $1.99 per minute to the United States and Europe, and the
phones can be delivered to your door in the U.S. before you leave.
In Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 at Heathrow Airport, you can buy a range
of mobile phones and services, including SIM cards, at Primus (% 020/
8607-5960).
Two good wireless rental companies are InTouch USA (% 800/872-
7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888/290-1606 or
905/272-5665; www.roadpost.com). Give them your itinerary, and they’ll
tell you what wireless products you need. InTouch will also, for free,
advise you on whether your existing phone will work overseas; simply
call % 703/222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern standard time or
go to www.intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, 
you can still access your e-mail and even your office computer from
cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city in England that doesn’t have a few
cybercafes, though you won’t find any in smaller towns and villages. No

Surfing at Internet cafes in London
The easyInternetCafe chain has several giant Internet cafes in London — but cafe is
really a misnomer, because the hundreds of screens in the largest locations make
them look like telemarketing sweatshops, and you don’t hear any conversation, just
the clicking of keyboards.
The charging system is radical because surfers buy credit, not minutes. The minimum
you’ll spend is £2 ($4), and the amount of time you get for that is in inverse proportion
to how busy the branch is. The rate is adjusted every five minutes and posted on video
screens, a bit like a stock exchange. Your ticket has a user ID, which notes the cur-
rent rate when you first log on. That becomes your rate. You’ll never pay more, but if
things quiet down, your credit will buy more time — a pound could be worth up to six
hours, or so they claim. easyInternet never closes, so avoid afternoons and early
evenings, and surf with the creatures of the night and early morning.
Turn to the appendix for a list of convenient branches. Otherwise, check www.easy
everything.com for a complete list. As befitting a large chain, the telephone
number for all locations is % 020/7241-9000.

definitive directory of cybercafes exists — these are independent busi-
nesses, after all — but two places to start looking are at www.cyber
captive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most youth hostels nowadays have at
least one computer on which you can access the Internet. And most
public libraries offer Internet access free or for a small charge. If you
want to save money, avoid hotel business centers unless you can use
the service for free. Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scat-
tered throughout their gates. These kiosks, which you also see in shop-
ping malls, hotel lobbies, and tourist information offices around the
world, give you basic Web access for a per-minute fee that’s usually
higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks’ clunkiness and high prices
mean that you probably want to avoid them whenever possible.
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP) if it has
a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail account. If your ISP
doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the free mail2web service
(www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your home e-mail. For more
flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-based e-mail account with
Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com) or Google (www.gmail.com). 
If you have AOL, you can access your e-mail online at www.aol.com.
(Microsoft’s Hotmail is another popular option, but Hotmail has severe
spam problems.) You may be able to get your home ISP to forward your
e-mail to the Web-based account automatically.
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from 
anywhere — even a cybercafe — provided that your “target” PC is on
and has an always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road
Runner cable). The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re wor-
ried about hackers, use your own laptop rather than a cybercafe com-
puter to access the GoToMyPC system.
If you’re bringing your own computer with Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), you’ll
be happy to know that more and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are
signing on as wireless Internet hotspots. You can get a Wi-Fi connection
one of several ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in 
Wi-Fi capability. Mac owners have their own networking technology,
Apple AirPort. If you have an older computer, you can plug a Wi-Fi
card (around $50) into your laptop.
You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cellphone serv-
ice, through a plan offered by one of several commercial companies that
have made wireless service available in airports, hotel lobbies, and
coffee shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the U.K. and
Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/hotspot) serves up
wireless connections at Starbucks coffee shops throughout England.
Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. iPass providers
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 77

also give you access to a few hundred wireless hotel-lobby setups. Best
of all, you don’t need to be staying at the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s
network; just set yourself up on a nice couch in the lobby. The compa-
nies’ pricing policies can be byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-
connection, and per-minute plans, but in general, you pay around $30 a
month for limited access — and as more and more companies jump on
the wireless bandwagon, prices are likely to get even more competitive.
Some places in cities around the world also provide free wireless net-
works. To locate these free hotspots, go to www.personaltelco.net/
index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
If Wi-Fi is not available at your destination, most business-class hotels
throughout England and the rest of the United Kingdom offer dataports
for laptop modems, and many offer free high-speed Internet access using
an Ethernet network cable. You can bring your own cables, but most
hotels rent them for around $10. Call your hotel in advance to see what
your options are.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your 
ISP’s Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your
current account away from home, and how much it will cost. If you’re
traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up
numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an
iPass provider, who will then tell you how to set up your computer for
your destination. For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and
click “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866/811-
6209 or 920/235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
North American current runs 110V, 60 cycles; the standard voltage
throughout Britain is 240V AC, 50 cycles. You need a current converter
or transformer to bring the voltage down and the cycles up. Two-
pronged North American plugs won’t fit into the three-pronged square
British wall sockets, so you also need a three-pronged square adapter
and converter if you use North American laptops or appliances while in
England. Australian and New Zealand plugs won’t fit, although the elec-
trical current is the same as England. Plug adapters and converters are
available at most travel, luggage, electronics, and hardware stores. Some
plug adapters are also current converters. Most contemporary laptop
computers automatically sense the current and adapt accordingly.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
Part II: Planning Your Trip to London 
78

fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she can probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) phased out
gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And E-tickets have made paper tickets
nearly obsolete. If you have an E-ticket, you can beat the ticket counter
lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even online check-in from
your home computer (electronic check-in is not available for most inter-
national flights, however). Online check-in involves logging on to your
airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and printing out your
boarding pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus miles to do
so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card that you
used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your board-
ing pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security checkpoint
with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking to snag
an exit-row seat for the domestic portion of your flight to London, you’ll
be able to do so using most airline kiosks. Even the smaller airlines are
employing the kiosk system, but always call your airline to make sure
these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is also a good way to
avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in; call
before you go. If your trip requires you to fly to another U.S. airport to
get your flight to London, chances are that you must check in at the air-
line counter, showing your passport, for your international flight.
Security checkpoint lines in U.S. airports are generally shorter and faster
than they were immediately after September 11, 2001, but when you’re
returning from London via Heathrow or Gatwick airports, be prepared
for long lines and multiple security checks. If you have trouble standing
for long periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide
a wheelchair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as
big belt buckles. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your
doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind
that only ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks
escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. The general rule is that sharp things are out, nail clippers are
okay. Any liquids or gels must be in 3-ounce or smaller containers and
placed in a see-through 1-quart plastic bag, which is put separately
through the scanner. (After you’ve passed through security, you can buy
bottled water and bring it on the plane.) Bring food in your carryon
rather than checking it, because explosive-detection machines used on
checked luggage have been known to mistake food (especially choco-
late, for some reason) for bombs. Travelers in the United States are
Chapter 7: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 79

allowed one carry-on bag, plus a personal item (such as a purse, brief-
case, or laptop bag). Carry-on hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a
laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal
item. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has issued a list
of restricted items; you can find the list at www.tsa.gov (click “For
Travelers” and then “Air Travel”).
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow
screeners to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is neces-
sary. Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops
and Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.
com). These locks, approved by the TSA, can be opened by luggage
inspectors with a special code or key. For more information on the locks,
visit www.travelsentry.org. If you use something other than TSA-
approved locks, your lock will be cut off your suitcase if a TSA agent
needs to hand-search your luggage.

 Traveling around the city
A
lthough London is among the world’s largest cities, both in size and
population, its neighborhoods were once small, separate villages.
With urban roots (and routes) that hark back to Roman times, London
isn’t always the easiest city to navigate. Streets aren’t organized in a
grid, and although most have been paved and modernized, a few old
lanes here and there still have cobblestones. This quaint, villagelike
quality is one reason for London’s enduring charm, but charm is little
comfort when you’re trying to find your way around in a strange city.
This chapter helps you get your bearings. Neighborhood boundaries
come later in this chapter, too. First, you need to get from the airport or
train station into Central London.
Getting through Passport Control and Customs
Have your passport ready because your first stop after deplaning is
passport control (for details on getting a passport, see Chapter 7). The
procedure is fairly routine. On the plane you fill out a landing card that
asks for your name, home address, passport number, and the address
where you’ll be staying in London. Present the completed card with your
passport to the official at Passport Control. The official may ask for the
following information:
 How long you’ll be staying (you can only stay up to three months if
you don’t have a visa)
 Where you plan to stay

 Whether the trip is for business or pleasure
 What your next destination will be
 How much money you have with you
Although you may think that the question about your finances is snoopy
impertinence, officials have good reason to ask. They want to verify that
people entering England won’t apply for some kind of welfare or national
health-insurance benefits and become a burden on the country.
Officials may stamp your passport without asking a thing. After your
passport is stamped, proceed to pick up your luggage. From there, you
wind your way out through the Customs Hall.
At the Customs area, you get two choices: “Nothing to Declare” and
“Goods to Declare.” Chances are you won’t be declaring anything, in
which case you’ll walk right through. Limits on imports for visitors 
age 17 and older entering England include the following:
 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams (8.8 oz.) of loose tobacco
 2 liters (2.1 qt.) of still table wine
 1 liter (1 qt.) of liquor over 22 percent alcohol content or 2 liters
(2.1 qt.) of liquor under 22 percent
 2 fluid ounces of perfume
If you fall within these limits, go through the “Nothing to Declare” area at
Customs. You may, however, be stopped for a random luggage search.
Don’t take it personally if this happens. Unless you’re smuggling in con-
traband, you have nothing to worry about.
For details on duty-free shopping and limits on what you can bring back
home, see Chapter 12.
Making Your Way to Your Hotel
You’re in London! Well, almost. First, you have to get from the airport or
train station to your hotel. I fill you in on all your options from each air-
port in the following sections.
Arriving at Heathrow
About 24km (15 miles) west of Central London, Heathrow (% 0870/000-
0123; www.baa.co.uk) is the largest of London’s airports, as well as one
of the world’s busiest, with four passenger terminals (and an additional
fifth under construction) serving flights from around the globe. Sign-
posts mark just about everything and moving walkways make the trek
through the long corridors easy. You’ll probably arrive at Terminal 3 or
Terminal 4:
Part III: Settling into London 
84

 Terminal 3 is for non-British, long-haul flights.
 Terminal 4 is for British Airways intercontinental flights.
After clearing Customs (see the section “Getting through Passport
Control and Customs,” earlier in this chapter), you enter the main con-
course of your terminal. You can pick up a free map and general info
from the Tourist Information Centre in the Underground concourse of
Terminals 1, 2, and 3 (open Oct–May daily 8 a.m.–6 p.m. and June–Sept
Mon–Sat 8 a.m.–7 p.m.). You can also find ATMs, hotel booking agencies
(see Chapter 9), theater booking services, and several banks and
bureaux de change where you can swap your dollars or traveler’s checks
for pounds and pence (see Chapter 4 for details on changing money).
You have several options for getting into the city. The London Under-
ground (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk/tube), called the Under-
ground or the Tube, is the London subway system and the cheapest
mode of public transportation for most Central London destinations
(see the inside back cover of this book for a map of the Underground
system). All terminals at Heathrow link up with the Tube system. Follow
the Underground signs to the ticket booth. The Piccadilly Line gets you
into Central London in about 45 minutes for a fare of £4 ($8). Under-
ground trains run from all four Heathrow terminals every five to nine
minutes Monday through Saturday 5:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and Sunday 
6 a.m. to 11 p.m.
The one potential hassle with the Underground is that the Tube trains
don’t have luggage racks. Stash your bags as best you can — behind
your legs, on your lap, or near the center doors where there’s more
space. Keep in mind that, during rush hour, the trains become increas-
ingly packed as you get closer to London. To reach your hotel on the
Underground, you may have to change trains or take a cab from the
Underground station closest to your destination.
If the Underground is closed, you can ride the N97 night bus from
Heathrow to Central London. Buses (located in front of the terminals)
run every 30 minutes Monday through Saturday midnight to 5 a.m. and
Sunday 11 p.m. to 5:30 a.m. The trip takes about an hour; a one-way fare
costs £2 ($4).
The buses operated by National Express (% 08705/808-080; www.
nationalexpress.com) may be a better alternative to the Underground
if you have lots of heavy luggage. The trip from the airport to Victoria
Coach Station takes about 75 minutes, and costs £4 ($8; payable on the
bus). Up to three buses per hour depart daily from 4 a.m. to 11:23 p.m.
from the coach station in front of Heathrow’s Terminals 3 and 4.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 85

The Heathrow Express (% 0845/600-1515; www.heathrowexpress.
co.uk) is a dedicated train line running from all four Heathrow terminals
to London’s Paddington Station in only 15 minutes. The trains have air-
conditioning, ergonomically designed seating, and plenty of luggage
space. The Express (standard) class fare costs £16 ($32). You can buy
tickets at the airport or onboard the train (for an additional £2/$4
charge). Service runs daily every 15 minutes from 5 a.m. to 11:48 p.m.
If you’re travel-weary, you may want the luxury of taking a taxi directly
to your hotel. Taxis are especially cost effective if four or five people are
traveling together. You can order one at the Taxi Information booths in
Terminal 3 (% 020/8745-4655) or Terminal 4 (% 020/8745-7302).
Expect to pay about £45 to £50 ($90 to $100), plus tip (15 percent of the
total fare), for a trip of about 45 minutes. Cabs are available 24 hours a
day. Wheelchair facilities are available at all times for the disabled.
Arriving at calmer Gatwick
Gatwick (% 0870/000-2468; www.baa.co.uk) is considerably smaller
than Heathrow but basically provides the same services, except that
there’s no tourist information office here. Gatwick is about 45km (28
miles) south of Central London and handles national and international
flights from some U.S. airlines; international flights come in at the South
Terminal. Gatwick also has a North Terminal.
Part III: Settling into London 
86
It’s about time! Heathrow’s 
new Terminal 5
Heathrow Airport was initially built to serve about 45 million passengers a year, but
for a decade now its four terminals have been processing upwards of 70 million. The
overcrowding was so bad that passengers voted Heathrow their least favorite airport
worldwide in a 2006 poll by TripAdvisor. Some of that passenger crush should be alle-
viated in March 2008, when Heathrow opens its new Terminal 5.
The new terminal, which serves British Airways, is a radical departure from the other
four. Designed by architect Richard Rodgers, it features light stone floors (instead of
much-tramped carpeting) and glass facades (instead of windowless corridors) that
provide views of Windsor Castle and Wembley Stadium. With some 112 retail outlets,
including upscale stores like Prada and Harrods, shopping is a major component of
the new terminal, as are eating and drinking — the terminal is set to include bars,
cafes, and a restaurant from celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay featuring a one-hour menu.
When Terminal 5 is up and running, Terminal 2 will be demolished and a new Heathrow
East Terminal will be built on its site. When the East Terminal is open, Terminal 1 will
be closed and Terminal 3 will be expanded. By that time — a decade or more away —
Heathrow will be back to its original four terminals. But what’s really needed, say many,
is another runway.

If you land at Gatwick rather than Heathrow, you have fewer transporta-
tion options into Central London. The highway system from Gatwick into
London is far less efficient than from Heathrow, so buses, minivans, or
cabs can end up taking two or three hours in heavy traffic.
Your quickest way of getting into Central London from Gatwick is the
convenient Gatwick Express train (% 0845/850-1530; www.gatwick
express.co.uk). You can board the train right in the South Terminal,
and in about 30 minutes, you’ll be at Victoria Station. The trip costs 
£16 ($32) for Express class; First class, which has reclining chairs and
refreshment service, costs £24 ($48). Trains run daily every 15 minutes
from 5:50 a.m. to 1:35 a.m.
Southern Train (% 08451/272-920; www.southernrailway.com), a
local passenger train, runs to Victoria Station in 30 minutes and costs
£8.90 ($18). Four trains an hour run during the day; they run hourly from
midnight to 5 a.m.
National Express buses (% 08705/808-080; www.nationalexpress.
com) provide service from the airport to Victoria Coach Station in
Central London, departing from both the North and South Terminal. 
The fare is £6.60 ($13), payable on the bus.
Hotelink (% 01293/552-251; www.hotelink.co.uk) runs a minibus
service from Gatwick directly to your hotel for £20 ($40).
For 24-hour taxi service between Gatwick and Central London, call
 Gatwick Airport Cars (% 01293/562-291)
 Gatwick Goldlines Cars (% 01293/568-368)
You can order a taxi at the Taxi Information booth when you arrive at
Gatwick Airport. Fares for both companies are the same: £65 ($130), plus
tip, for the journey that takes about 90 minutes.
Touching down at another airport
If you fly into London from elsewhere in Europe, you may arrive at an
airport other than Heathrow or Gatwick. The following sections help you
navigate from these less-used facilities.
Stansted: For national and European flights
Stansted (% 0870/000-0303; www.stanstedairport.com) is a single-
terminal airport used for national and European flights. The airport is
about 80km (50 miles) northeast of Central London. The Stansted
Express train (% 0845/600-7245) to Liverpool Street Station takes 45
minutes and costs £16 ($32). Trains run every 15 minutes daily 5:30 a.m.
to 11:59 p.m. Taxi fare into the city averages about £60 ($120), plus tip.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 87

London City Airport: European destinations only
London City Airport (% 020/7646-000; www.londoncityairport.com)
is a mere 10km (6 miles) east of the city center, and it services only
European destinations. A new extension of the Docklands Light Railway
(DLR) travels from the airport to Bank Street, in Central London, in 22
minutes for £4 ($8); the Underground requires an additional fare if you’re
traveling beyond Bank Street. A taxi to the vicinity of Marble Arch costs
about £25 ($50), plus tip.
Luton: Serving European charters
Luton (% 01582/405-100; www.london-luton.co.uk) services
European charter flights. This small, independent airport is about 45km
(28 miles) northwest of the city. Travel by free shuttle bus to Luton
Airport Parkway station, then take a Capital Connection train to King’s
Cross Station in central London for £11 ($22); the trip takes 30 to 45 min-
utes. Taxis into the city cost about £50 ($100), plus tip.
Arriving by train
If you’re coming from the Continent, you cross the English Channel and
disembark at one of the United Kingdom’s Channel ports. The ports 
closest to London are Dover, Folkestone, and Ramsgate to the east and
Newhaven, Portsmouth, and Southampton to the south. The QE II cruise
ship also docks at Southampton.
Trains connecting with ferries on the U.K. side of the Channel generally
go to Liverpool Street Station, Victoria Station, or Waterloo International.
Train passage to London is included in the ferry fee. The newly reopened
(in 2007) King’s Cross/St. Pancras Station is where the Eurostar Chunnel
trains arrive from Paris and Brussels. On the Eurostar, you don’t have to
make any train-to-boat-to-train transfers along the way. (For more on the
Eurostar, see Chapter 5.)
All London stations link to the Underground system. Just look for the
Underground symbol (a circle with a line through it). The stations con-
nect to the Underground as follows:
 Liverpool Street is on the Circle, East London, Metropolitan, and
Central Lines.
 Victoria is on the District, Circle, and Victoria lines.
 Waterloo is linked to the Northern and Bakerloo lines.
 King’s Cross/St. Pancras is on the Piccadilly and Northern lines.
Taxis wait outside all train stations. See the “Getting Around London”
section, later in this chapter, for more information on the London
Underground and taxis.
Part III: Settling into London 
88

London’s train stations are swarming with activity. You find bookstores,
bureaux de change, restaurants, newsstands, hotel reservation agencies,
and many of the services that airports traditionally offer.
Keep in mind that the United Kingdom, like the rest of Europe, uses the
24-hour clock for rail and other timetables, which means that 0530 is
5:30 a.m., 1200 is noon, and 1830 is 6:30 p.m. Just continue counting up
from noon: 1300 = 1 p.m., 1400 = 2 p.m., 1500 = 3 p.m., and so on up to
2400 (midnight). In this book, I stick to the American a.m. and p.m.
system. Like most of the rest of the world, London goes on daylight
saving time from April through October.
Figuring Out the Neighborhoods
Londoners orient themselves by neighborhood (see the “London’s
Neighborhoods” map on p. 90). Sounds simple enough, but with
London’s confusing and sometimes oddly named streets and its seem-
ingly endless plethora of neighborhoods, you may have a hard time
telling where one neighborhood begins and another leaves off. For orien-
tation purposes, I give you major streets as boundary markers. But be
aware that the neighborhoods frequently bleed beyond these principal
arteries.
To help you find your way around, I strongly suggest that you buy a
copy of London A–Z. (Americans take note: ask for London A–Zed,
because z is pronounced zed in the U.K.) You can pick up this indexed
London street map at just about any bookstore or newsstand (you may
want to get it while you’re at the airport).
Although Greater London encompasses a whopping 1,610 sq. km (622
sq. miles), the main tourist portion covers only a fraction (65 sq. km/
25 sq. miles, at the most) of that distance. Most sites within this 65km
(25-mile) range are convenient to the Underground system (the Tube).
You may have a short (ten-minute or less) walk from the Tube stop to
your destination, but London is flat, and for walkers it’s a dream.
London is divided into postal districts. All London street addresses
include a designation such as SW1 or EC3. (In London, the postal dis-
tricts are related to where they lie geographically from the original post
office, which was at St. Martin-le-Grand in the City.) Addresses in the
City of London, the easternmost portion of Central London, have desig-
nations such as EC2, EC3, or EC4. As you move west, the codes change
accordingly to W, WC, SW, NW, and so on.
You don’t need to bother yourself with postal districts except when
you’re mailing something to London or looking up streets in London A–Z
(many streets in different parts of London have the same name). When
you actually hit the streets, the postal district designations aren’t as
important as the nearest Tube stop.

Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 91

London grew up along the north and south banks of the Thames River,
which snakes through the city in a long, loose S-curve. This great tidal
river played a fundamental role in London’s growth, development, and
prosperity. London’s major tourist sights, hotels, and restaurants are on
the river’s north bank, and many of the city’s famous performing arts
venues are along the south bank.
Central London, on the north bank of the Thames, is considered the 
city center — the area covered by the Circle Line Underground route.
Paddington Station anchors the northwestern corner, Earl’s Court marks
the southwestern corner, Tower Hill sits at the southeast corner, and
Liverpool Street Station anchors the northeastern corner. Central
London is divided into three areas: the City, the West End, and West
London. In the descriptions that follow, I start at the City and move west
from there.
The City of London: The heart of it all
A self-governing entity that extends south from Chiswell Street to the
River Thames, the City of London is bounded on the west by Chancery
Lane and to the east by the Tower of London, the City’s most important
historic monument.
Fleet Street, associated with printing and publishing since the 1500s but
now a little forlorn since the departure of most of its newspaper offices,
cuts through the center of the district to Ludgate Circus, where it
becomes Ludgate. Follow that road and you get to St. Paul’s Cathedral,
its massive dome beautifully illuminated at night. St. Paul’s is just one of
the buildings built atop the ancient area known as the City.
Covering the original 2.6 sq. km (1 sq. mile) that the Romans called
Londinium, the City encompasses the territory between Moorfields to
the north and the Thames to the south and from Aldgate to the east 
and Temple Bar to the west. Today, this area is the Wall Street of
England, home to the Bank of England, the Royal Exchange, and the
Stock Exchange, as well as the new Lloyds of London building and 
the NatWest Tower, London’s second tallest building. You also find the
Museum of London, the remains of the Roman Temple of Mithras,
the church of St. Stephen Walbrook (designed by Sir Christopher Wren),
the Wren-designed Monument that commemorates the Great Fire of
London in 1666, and the Barbican Centre, a mega-arts complex of 
theaters and concert halls.
Liverpool Street Station is the main rail terminus in this area. The major
Tube stops are Bank, Barbican, Blackfriars, Liverpool Street Station,
Moorgate, St. Paul’s, and Tower Hill.
The West End: Downtown London
The West End (that is, west of the City) is “downtown” London. The
West End is known for the theater, entertainment, and shopping areas
Part III: Settling into London 
92

around Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square. But a host of neighbor-
hoods make up the West End. I describe them briefly in the sections that
follow.
Holborn
Abutting the City of London to the west is the old borough of Holborn,
the legal heart of London and home to the Inns of Court, Lincoln’s Inn
Fields, Old Bailey, and Royal Courts of Justice.
This “in-between” district is bounded roughly by Theobald’s Road to 
the north, Farringdon Road to the east, the Thames to the south, and
Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster Place to the west. The major Tube
stops are Aldwych, Blackfriars, Holborn, and Temple.
The Strand and Covent Garden
The northern section of the Strand, the area west of Holborn, is Covent
Garden, with Shaftesbury Avenue as its northern boundary. Covent
Garden has many theaters, eateries, and shops and is home to the Royal
Opera House and Covent Garden Market, one of the busiest shopping
areas in London. Covent Garden is an area for strolling, shopping, and
stopping for tea or a meal.
Formerly one of the premier streets in England, the Strand (the same
name as the neighborhood) runs from Trafalgar Square to Fleet Street;
the Strand is the principal thoroughfare along the southern edge, with
Charing Cross Road to the west and Kingsway, Aldwych, and Lancaster
Place to the east. Cleopatra’s Needle, an Egyptian obelisk dating from
about 1475 B.C. and moved to England in 1878, is located in the Victoria
Embankment on the north side of the Hungerford Bridge. The major
Tube stops are Charing Cross, Covent Garden, and Leicester Square.
Bloomsbury
Just north of Covent Garden, New Oxford Street and Bloomsbury Way
mark the beginnings of the Bloomsbury district, home of the British
Museum and several colleges and universities, as well as the only surviv-
ing London home of novelist Charles Dickens.
This intellectual pocket of Central London was home to the famed
Bloomsbury Group, whose members included novelist Virginia Woolf
and historian Lytton Strachey. Bloomsbury is bounded to the east by
Woburn Place and Southampton Row, to the north by Euston Road, and
to the west by Tottenham Court Road. The major Tube stops are Euston
Square, Goodge Street, Russell Square, and Tottenham Court Road.
Soho
This lively area is full of restaurants, cafes, bars, pubs, and nightclubs
and is popular with the gay community. London’s Gay Village centers
around Old Compton Street. Gerrard Street is one of the main streets of
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 93

Chinatown. Much of Soho used to be a down-to-earth Italian neighbor-
hood, but the area later became known for its strip joints and porn
palaces. You still see remnants of the sex ’n’ sleaze era, but most of it is
now gone, and things are going upscale.
The Soho neighborhood occupies the maze of densely packed streets
north of Shaftesbury Avenue, west of Charing Cross Road, east of Regent
Street, and south of Oxford Street. The major Tube stops are Covent
Garden, Leicester Square, and Tottenham Court Road.
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Charing Cross
This area, just west of the Strand, is “downtown” London or Theatre-
land. Piccadilly Circus, with its landmark statue of Eros, is the area’s
major traffic hub and best-known tourist destination, feeding into Regent
Street and Piccadilly. The Royal Academy of Arts is just west of Picca-
dilly Circus. A few minutes’ walk to the east puts you at Leicester Square
and Shaftesbury Avenue, where you find most of the West End theaters.
From Leicester Square, Charing Cross Road runs south to Trafalgar
Square, with its delightful fountains and four immense bronze lions
guarding its corners. Around the square, you see the National Gallery
and the National Portrait Gallery. Charing Cross Road is well known
for its bookshops. The Tube stops are Charing Cross, Leicester Square,
and Piccadilly Circus.
Mayfair
Elegant and exclusive, Mayfair is luxury-hotel and luxury-shopping land.
The area is nestled among Regent Street on the east, Oxford Street on
the north, Piccadilly on the south, and Hyde Park on the west. The major
Tube stops are Bond Street, Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, and Picca-
dilly Circus.
Marylebone
In a sense, Marylebone (pronounced mar-lee-bone) is “Medical London”
because the area has several hospitals and the famous Harley Street
Clinic. But perhaps the most famous street is Baker Street, home of the
fictional Sherlock Holmes. Madame Tussaud’s wax museum is on
Marylebone Road.
Marylebone is the neighborhood north of Mayfair and Bloomsbury and
is capped to the north by giant Regent’s Park (Marylebone Road runs
south of the park). Great Portland Street is the area’s eastern boundary
and Edgware Road the western. The major Tube stops are Baker Street,
Marylebone, and Regent’s Park.
St. James’s
St. James’s is “royal London,” a posh green haven beginning at Piccadilly
and moving southwest to include Green Park and St. James’s Park, with
Buckingham Palace between them and St. James’s Palace across from
St. James’s Park.
Part III: Settling into London 
94

Pall Mall (pronounced pell mell), lined with exclusive “gentlemen’s
clubs,” runs roughly east–west into the area and meets the north–south
St. James’s Street. Regent Street is the eastern boundary. The Tube stops
are Green Park and St. James’s Park.
Westminster
East and south of St. James’s, Westminster draws visitors to West-
minster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament, the seat of British 
government.
Westminster extends from Northumberland Avenue just south of
Charing Cross to Vauxhall Bridge Road, with the Thames to the east 
and St. James’s Park to the west. Victoria Station, on the northwestern
perimeter, is a kind of axis for Belgravia, Pimlico, and Westminster. The
Tube stops are St. James’s Park, Victoria, and Westminster.
Pimlico
The pie-shaped wedge extending west from Vauxhall Bridge Road to
Buckingham Palace Road is Pimlico. Crowning the area to the north is
Victoria Station. Near the Vauxhall Bridge is the Tate Britain gallery. The
Tube stops are Pimlico and Victoria.
Belgravia
A posh quarter long favored by aristocrats, Belgravia is where many for-
eign embassies are located. Beginning west of Victoria Station and Green
Park, Belgravia extends south to the river and west to Sloane Street;
Hyde Park is its northern boundary. The Tube stops are Hyde Park,
Sloane Square, and Victoria.
Central London: Parks, museums, and more
West of the West End, you find Central London’s residential, cultural,
and shopping attractions, including beautiful gardens and popular 
museums.
Knightsbridge
West of Belgravia is the fashionable residential and shopping district of
Knightsbridge, bounded to the north by Hyde Park and to the west by
Brompton Road. Here you find Harrods, the famed department store
that has been a London shopping staple for a century and a half.
Running through the neighborhood is pretty Beauchamp (pronounced
beech-um) Place with its expensive boutiques. The Tube stops are
Knightsbridge and Sloane Square.
Chelsea
South of Knightsbridge and west of Belgravia, artsy, trendy Chelsea
begins at Sloane Square and runs south to Cheyne Walk and Chelsea
Embankment along the Thames. The famous King’s Road acts as its
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 95

northern boundary and Chelsea Bridge Road its eastern border. To the
west, the area extends as far as Earl’s Court Road, Redcliffe Gardens, and
Edith Grove. In Chelsea, you find Carlyle’s House and the lovely and his-
toric Chelsea Physic Garden. The annual Chelsea Flower Show is held
on the grounds of Chelsea Royal Hospital. The Tube stop is Sloane
Square.
South Kensington
Forming the green northern boundary of South Kensington are
Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. South Ken is London’s museum
capital, including the Natural History Museum, Science Museum, and
Victoria & Albert Museum, and is packed with hotels and restaurants. 
South Kensington is bounded to the south by Brompton Road, to the
west by Gloucester (pronounced gloss-ter) Road, and to the east by
Fulham Road. The Tube stops are Gloucester Road and South
Kensington.
Kensington
The residential neighborhood of Kensington fills in the gap between
Kensington Gardens and Holland Park, with Notting Hill Gate and
Bayswater Road marking the northern boundary. Kensington Church
Street runs north–south between Notting Hill Gate and Kensington 
High Street. The Tube stop is High Street Kensington.
Earl’s Court
This down-to-earth neighborhood has long been a haven for budget trav-
elers (particularly Australians — hence its nickname, Kangaroo Court)
and for gays and lesbians. Earl’s Court is gradually being renovated, but
some streets still look a bit down at the heels. This area offers no major
tourist attractions, but it does have some good hotels and B&Bs.
The area begins south of West Cromwell Road and extends south to Lillie
Road and Brompton Road. Its western boundary is North End Road, and
its eastern boundary is Earl’s Court Road. The Tube stop is Earl’s Court.
Notting Hill
Beginning north of Holland Park, Kensington Gardens, and Hyde Park
(Holland Park Avenue and Bayswater Road run along the northern
perimeter of the parks), you find the antiques shops of Notting Hill and
the rising sub-neighborhood of Notting Hill Gate.
The area is bounded by Clarendon Road to the west, Queensway to 
the east, and Wesbourne Grove to the north. The most famous street,
Portobello Road, runs north–south through the center. The neighbor-
hood served as a backdrop for the 1999 movie Notting Hill, starring Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant. The Tube stops are Bayswater, Notting Hill
Gate, and Queensway.
Part III: Settling into London 
96

Bayswater and Paddington
Picking up where Notting Hill ends, Bayswater runs east to meet
Marylebone at Edgware Road. The roaring A40 (Westway) highway acts
as its northern boundary. Paddington Station is in the northwestern
corner of Bayswater.
This commercial area isn’t much to look at. The neighborhood offers no
major tourist attractions, but it does have many budget B&Bs. The Tube
stops are Edgware Road, Lancaster Gate, Marble Arch, and Paddington.
Shoreditch
London’s East End has no exact boundaries but basically extends east of
the City to Canary Wharf. Historically, this part of London has always
been home to working-class and immigrant communities. Today, the
area known as Shoreditch is one of London’s hot new trend zones, espe-
cially the area around Hoxton Square. The primary tourist attraction in
Shoreditch is the Geffrye Museum.
The South Bank
You most likely won’t be staying on the South Bank, but you may go
there for a play, an exhibition, or a concert at one of its internationally
known arts and performance venues or museums. The Tube stops are
London Bridge, Southwark, and Waterloo.
The Hayward Gallery, the National Film Theatre, the Royal National
Theatre, and the South Bank Centre (which contains Royal Festival
Hall and two smaller concert halls) are all clustered beside the river
within easy walking distance of Waterloo Station. Closer to Westminster
Bridge is the city’s newest high-rise attraction: the British Airways
London Eye observation wheel.
For a scenic route to the South Bank, take the Tube to Embankment, on
the north bank, and walk across the Thames on the new Hungerford
pedestrian bridge. The Jubilee Walkway, a breezy riverside path,
extends south from the arts complexes to the London Aquarium and
north to the new Tate Modern, the Globe Theatre (a re-creation of the
Elizabethan outdoor theater used by William Shakespeare), Southwark
Cathedral, and Tower Bridge. The new pedestrian-only Millennium
Bridge spans the Thames from the Tate Modern to St. Paul’s.

and Underground maps and can help with basic directions or ques-
tions; it’s open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m., Saturday
and Sunday 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Getting Around London
You can choose many ways to get around London. If you travel for any
distance, the fastest mode of transportation in this enormous city is the
Tube (the subway system). Many of the slower but more scenic buses
are double-deckers but you’ll also see new, energy-efficient buses. Most
convenient (unless you’re stuck in a traffic jam) is to go by taxi. But
walking is the most fun of all. When you’re on foot, you see more and
can explore some of the leafy squares and cobbled lanes that contribute
to London’s enduring charm.
For general London travel information, call Transport for London at 
% 020/7222-1234 or visit its Web site (www.tfl.gov.uk). You can get
free bus and Underground maps and buy Travelcards and bus passes at
any major Underground station (at the windows or from the machines)
or at the London Travel Information Centres in the stations at King’s
Cross; Liverpool Street; Oxford Circus; Piccadilly Circus; St. James’s
Park; Victoria; and Heathrow Terminals 1, 2, and 3.
Taking the Underground (subway)
London has the oldest and most comprehensive subway system in the
world. The Tube is fast and convenient, and just about everyone but the
royals uses it. Everywhere you’ll want to go is near a Tube stop, each of
which is clearly marked by a red circle with a horizontal line through it.
For an Underground map, see the inside back cover of this book.
Using the Underground
Thirteen Underground lines crisscross the city and intersect at various
stations where you can change from one train to another. On Under-
ground maps, every line is color-coded (Bakerloo is brown, Piccadilly is
Part III: Settling into London 
98

dark blue, and so on), which makes planning your route easy. All you
need to know is the name of your stop and the direction you’re heading.
After you figure out which line you need to take, look on the map for the
name of the last stop in the direction you need to go. The name of the
last stop on the line appears on the front of the train and also on elec-
tronic signboards that display the name of the arriving train. (The one
exception to this rule is the Circle Line, which runs in a loop around
Central London.) Inside the trains, electronic signs, recorded voices, or
both, announce the name of each approaching stop.
Traveling to your destination by Underground may require transferring
from one Underground line to another. All Underground maps clearly
show where various lines converge. Signs in the stations direct you from
one line to another. To get from one line to another, you go through tun-
nels (which the Brits call subways), and you may have to go up or down
a level or two.
Most of the Underground system operates with automated entry and
exit gates. If you have a regular paper ticket or Travelcard, you feed it
into the slot; the ticket disappears and pops up again, the gate bangs
open; you remove your ticket and pass through. Be sure to keep your
ticket during your ride because you’ll need it to get out. At the other
end, you put your ticket through as you did upon entry, but this time the
machine keeps the ticket (unless you have a multiuse Travelcard ticket,
which the machine returns to you). A new kind of electronic Tube ticket
called the Oyster recently went into effect. The Oyster is like a debit
card, and a breeze to use: You simply touch the card to the electronic
keypad on the turnstile and the gate opens. You won’t need an Oyster
card unless you’re planning to be in London for several days. For stays
of one to three days, you’ll save considerably by purchasing a
Travelcard (see the following section).
Underground service stops around midnight (a little earlier on less-used
lines). Keep this in mind when you’re out painting the town red. If you
miss the last train, you must take a taxi or one of the night buses.
Buying tickets
You can purchase Underground tickets at the ticket window or from one
of the automated machines that you can find in most stations. Machines
can change £5, £10, and £20 notes. Tickets are valid for use on the day of
issue only.
For fare purposes, the city is divided into zones. Zone 1 covers all
Central London. Zone 6 extends as far as Heathrow to the west and
Upminster to the east. Make sure that your ticket covers all the zones
that you’re traveling through (no problem if you’re staying in Central
London), or you may have to pay a £10 ($20) penalty fare.
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 99

New pricing guidelines have raised the price of a one-way single cash
fare within Zone 1 to a whopping £4 ($8) for adults and £2 ($4) for chil-
dren 5 to 15. If you’re making more than one trip by Underground, you
can save lots of money by purchasing a Travelcard or an Oyster card.
Saving with Travelcards
To make the most of London’s public transportation system, consider
buying a Travelcard, which allows unlimited travel by Underground 
and bus. You can purchase these cards at any Tube station window or
machine in the following increments:
 A Day Travelcard, good for one day in zones 1 and 2 (everything in
Central London), costs £6.60 ($13) for an adult and £3.30 ($6.60) for
children 5 to 15. If you travel off-peak (after 9:30 a.m.), the price of
an adult Day Travelcard drops to £5.10 ($10).
 The 3-Day Travelcard for zones 1 and 2 and valid at peak travel
times (before 9:30 a.m.) costs £16 ($32) for an adult and £8.20 ($16)
for a child.
 A 7-Day Travelcard, valid at peak travel times (before 9:30 a.m.) for
zones 1 and 2 (all of Central London) costs £23 ($46) for an adult
and £12 ($24) for a child.
Another great way to save money on London transportation is the
London Travelcard, which you can buy in the United States and Canada
before leaving home. Keep in mind, though, that it’s actually a bit cheaper
to buy Travelcards (including the London Travelcard) when you’re in
London. (For details, see Chapter 4.)
Riding a bus
Distinctive red double-decker buses are very much a part of London’s
snarled traffic scene, but not all London buses are double-deckers, and
some aren’t red. The one drawback to bus travel, especially for first-
timers, is that you need to know the streets of London so you can get off
at the correct stop. Get a free bus map at one of the Travel Information
Centres (see “Finding Information after You Arrive,” earlier in this chap-
ter), or you may overshoot your destination. On the plus side, riding the
bus is cheaper than taking the Tube; you don’t have to contend with
escalators, elevators, or tunnels; and you get to see the sights as you
travel.
A concrete post with a red or white sign on top reading LONDON
TRANSPORT BUS SERVICE clearly marks each bus stop. Another sign shows
the routes of the buses that stop there. If the sign on top is red, the stop
is a request stop, meaning you must hail the approaching bus as you
would a taxi (don’t whistle — just put up your hand). If the sign is white,
the bus stops automatically. Be sure to check the destination sign on the
front of the bus to make certain that the bus travels the entire route.
Have some coins with you, because the driver won’t change banknotes.
Part III: Settling into London 
100

The bus network is divided into two fare zones to simplify cash transac-
tions. Zone 1 covers all Central London, including all the main tourist
sites. The bus fare for adults is £2 ($4). Children 16 and under ride free if
traveling with an adult with a valid ticket.
Bus passes, available at most Underground stations, selected news
agents, and the Travel Information Centres, can be used all day but
aren’t valid on N-prefixed night buses (see the next paragraph). For
adults, a 1-day bus pass for all Central London costs £3.50 ($7); a 7-day
bus pass for Central London costs £14 ($28). Note: Children under 16
travel free with an adult after 9:30 a.m.
At the witching hour of midnight, buses become night buses (N), and
their routes change. Nearly all night buses pass through Trafalgar
Square, Central London’s late-night magnet for insomniacs.
Hailing a taxi
Taking a taxi is a safe and comfortable way to get around the city. Riding
in the old-fashioned, roomy black taxis is a pleasure. Today, many
smaller and newer-model taxis also run. London cabs of any size or
color aren’t cheap, however. Fares change depending on the time of day,
speed, and distance traveled. Fares and any extra charges are also dis-
played on the meter next to the driver. The basic fare begins at £2.20
($4.40) and rises in increments of 20p (40¢) every 160 meters or 34.5 sec-
onds. Tip your cabbie 10 percent to 15 percent of the total fare.
You can hail a cab on the street. If a cab is available, the yellow or 
white FOR HIRE sign on the roof is lit. You can order a radio cab by calling
% 020/7272-0272 or 020/7253-5000. Be aware that if you call for a cab,
you have to pay an additional £2 ($4) service charge.
London is one city where you don’t have to worry about whether the
cab driver knows where he’s going. When it comes to finding a street
address, London cabbies are among the most knowledgeable in the
world. Their rigorous training, which includes an exhaustive street test
called “The Knowledge,” gives them an encyclopedic grasp of the 
terrain.
Walking on your own two feet
If you really want to get acquainted with the charming hodgepodge and
monumental grandeur of London, bring along a good pair of walking
shoes and explore on foot. Everywhere you turn, you see enticing side
streets, countrylike lanes, little mews houses (former stables converted
into homes), and picturesque garden squares. London’s great parks are
as safe to walk in as its streets. (In fact, crime is less prevalent in London
than in many other major cities, and all the neighborhoods included in
this book are safe.)
Chapter 8: Arriving and Getting Oriented 101

If you want to follow a detailed stroll or two around the city, perhaps of
Dickens’s London or of Westminster and Whitehall, check out the 11
tours in Frommer’s Memorable Walks in London (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
A 11.25km (7-mile) walk commemorating the life of Princess Diana
passes through four of London’s royal parks — St. James’s Park, Green
Park, Hyde Park, and Kensington Gardens. Along the way are 90 plaques
that point out sites associated with Diana, including Kensington Palace
(her home for 15 years), Buckingham Palace, St. James’s Palace (where
she shared an office with Prince Charles), and Spencer House (her
family’s mansion, now a museum). A good place to start is at Kensington
Palace, Hyde Park Gate, or Horse Guards Parade (for the Green Park/St.
James’s section).
When you walk in London (or anywhere in England), remember:
 For North Americans, traffic moves on the opposite side of the
street from what you’re accustomed to. This sounds simple
enough on paper, but in practice, you need to keep reminding 
yourself to look in the “wrong” direction when crossing a street.
Throughout London, you see LOOK RIGHT or LOOK LEFT painted on
street crossings.
 Pedestrian crossings are marked by striped lines (called zebra
crossings) on the road. Flashing lights near the curb indicate that
drivers must stop and yield the right of way when a pedestrian
steps out into the zebra to cross the street.

Checking In at London’s
Best Hotels and B&Bs
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on London’s accommodations types
 Knowing what to expect from a hotel in your price range
 Finding the best room for the best rate
 Reviewing a list of London favorites
L
ondon hotel rooms run the gamut from a basic tiny bedroom with 
a shared bathroom down the hall to elegant, sumptuous suites.
Many travelers don’t care where they stay, as long as they can stay there
cheaply. The reasoning is, “I’m only going to be in a hotel room to sleep.”
That assumption may be true, but I also know that a cheap-at-all-costs
hotel room can color your mood and potentially turn a memorable vaca-
tion into something unnecessarily dreary.
This chapter is devoted to London hotels and B&Bs. You can find details
about what to expect for your money, get the lowdown on how to get the
best rooms at the best rates, and check out a list of specific hotels and
B&Bs that I heartily recommend.
Getting to Know Your Options
Accommodations in London are available in varying price ranges and
degrees of luxury. Places to stay generally fit into one of two categories:
hotels and bed-and-breakfast inns (B&Bs). The following sections pro-
vide a rundown on the quirks and perks of each.
Understanding the pros and cons of B&Bs
B&Bs are small, family-run hotels with differing degrees of comfort and
service. Because B&Bs are often private homes (or what were once pri-
vate homes), amenities vary widely, especially in the bathroom facilities.
Nearly all B&B rooms contain wash basins, but you may have to share a
bathroom down the hall. The facilities are usually kept scrupulously
clean. Keep in mind that en-suite (in the room) baths are generally so

small that you feel as if you haven’t left the airplane, and the super-small
showers can be a trial. In terms of décor, B&Bs tend to be fairly basic —
everything you need but without a lot of fuss or froufrou.
Licensed B&Bs, like hotels, are inspected regularly, and the quality of
London B&Bs has improved tremendously over the years. I recommend
them for people who don’t require many extras, although the most suc-
cessful B&Bs continually upgrade their services or offer some enticing
amenities. For example, many B&Bs now provide cable TVs and direct-
dial phones in the rooms. Many travelers prefer B&Bs over large hotels
because they want friendly service and a personal touch. It’s easier to
meet people in a small B&B than in a large hotel.
What about the breakfast part of the B&B? Well, gone are the days when
the staff of every B&B cooked you up a full English breakfast of eggs,
sausages, bacon, fried tomatoes, and beans. Some B&Bs still do serve 
an English breakfast, but others put out a continental buffet, which is a
breakfast of cereals, fruits, and breads. The B&B descriptions in this
book say either “English breakfast included” or “continental breakfast
included,” so you know what to expect.
If you want to do some additional B&B research, the following three
agencies have useful Web sites:
 London Bed and Breakfast: www.londonbandb.com (% 800/872-
2632 in the U.S. or 020/7351-3445 in London)
 London Bed and Breakfast Agency Ltd.: www.londonbb.com
(% 020/7586-2768 in London)
 Uptown Reservations: www.uptownres.co.uk (% 020/7937-2001
in London)
If you’re physically disabled in any way, B&Bs may not be the choice for
you. B&Bs usually don’t have elevators, so you may have to carry your
luggage up steep, narrow stairs. Be sure to check how accessible the B&B
is before you make your reservations.
Exploring hotel choices
You find a wide choice of hotels in London. Most of the moderately
priced hotels provide breakfast with a room rental. At a 4- or 5-star
hotel, you pay a hefty price to eat breakfast on the premises. The rooms
in a self-catering hotel are equipped with small kitchens, so you can
make your own meals in your room, if you prefer.
Boutique and deluxe hotels
London offers a few boutique hotels. These hotels are midrange in size
but not price; sumptuously furnished, they offer state-of-the-art ameni-
ties and full service. I’ve included a few in my reviews later in this chap-
ter. The Montague in Bloomsbury and 41 in Victoria/Westminster are
two of the best.
Part III: Settling into London 
104

A more traditional choice is one of London’s older deluxe hotels. The
Cadogan Hotel in Chelsea, The Gore in South Kensington, and Hazlitt’s
in Soho have all been around for a century or more. These hotels offer a
distinctly English kind of style, full of charm and character.
The older deluxe hotels are offset by the hippest-of-the-hip: the St.
Martin’s Lane, an Ian Schrager concoction in a converted office block.
Chain properties
But maybe you always stay at one of the chain hotels — a Crowne Plaza,
a Hyatt, a Radisson, or a Marriott — places that are basically the same no
matter where they are. Chains rely on their brand name and a no-
surprise approach to win customers. London is chock-full of chain hotels,
if that’s what you fancy. Most of them cater to large groups, and you may
feel rather anonymous in them. On the other hand, these hotels are usu-
ally well equipped for people with disabilities and families with children.
Landmark hotels
At the top of the hotel spectrum, in both price and prestige, are the land-
mark hotels: Claridge’s, the Dorchester, the Park Lane Sheraton, and The
Savoy (although The Savoy is currently closed for remodeling, so it’s not
included in this edition). The Langham Hotel on Regent Street is London’s
newest landmark hotel. These famous hotels are among the best in the
world. In each of them, you can expect glamorous public salons, a gener-
ously proportioned and well-decorated room with a large private bath, an
on-site health club or access to one nearby, and top-of-the-line service.
I’ve reviewed all the preceding hotels later in this chapter.
Self-catering options
You can also consider staying at a self-catering hotel, where you do the
cooking in the kitchen in your own hotel room. For short stays and for one
or two people, self-catering hotels don’t always beat the competition’s
price. But for families and travelers who can’t afford or don’t want to eat
every meal out, self-catering hotels can be a budget-saver. For comfort and
convenience, Astons Apartments in South Kensington is among the best,
and it’s the only self-catering hotel I include. If you’re interested in finding
other self-catering options in London, visit the Web site www.refresh
accommodation.com.
One of the most economical ways to stay in London is to rent a self-
catering flat. The owners register their flats with rental agencies; minimum
rental time is usually one week. You can find a small studio flat in Central
London that sleeps two and is fully equipped for under £500 ($1,000) per
week. One of the best agencies to help you find a flat is the Independent
Traveller (% 01392/860-807; www.gowithit.co.uk).
Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 105

Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The maximum rate that a hotel charges for a type of room is the rack
rate. If you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night, the
hotel may charge you this top rate. Hotel rates, like airline fares, change
all the time, and it’s impossible to list the most current “specials” a hotel
is offering on its Web site. So the rack rate is what I use as a hotel price
guide in this book.
Be aware that you don’t have to pay the rack rate — hardly anybody
does.Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. The result is often favor-
able when savvy travelers make this request. Hotels in London are eager
to fill their beds, and most of them are willing to negotiate a room rate.
Read on for more strategies on getting a good rate.
Finding the best rate
The rate you pay for a room depends on many factors, and the way you
make your reservation is the most important. The following strategies
can help you get the best rate available:
 Call around. If the hotel you’re interested in has a toll-free number,
call that, but also call the hotel’s local London number. The quoted
rates can vary so widely that you may save a bundle.
 Ask about discounts. If you make your reservation with a large
chain hotel, be sure to mention membership in AARP, frequent-flier
programs, and any other corporate rewards program. Budget
hotels and small B&Bs rarely offer these organization discounts,
but with larger hotels, you never know when the mention may be
worth a few pounds off your room rate.
 Travel off-season and on weekends. Room rates change with the
season and as occupancy rates rise and fall. You’re less likely to
receive discount rates if a hotel is close to full, but if it’s nearly
empty, you may be able to negotiate a significant discount. Expen-
sive hotels catering to business travelers are most crowded on
weekdays and usually offer big discounts for weekend stays.
You may be able to save 20 percent or more by traveling off-season,
which is mid-October to mid-December and January to March.
 Choose a package tour. The best rates of all will probably be with
an air/hotel package (see Chapter 5). With these packages, which
are sometimes astonishingly cheap, you have to choose a hotel
that’s part of the package. Airline package hotels tend to be larger
chains. So what? The money you save may amount to hundreds 
of dollars over what you’d pay by booking the hotel and flight 
separately.
 Use a travel agent. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better
room rate than you could get by yourself. The hotel gives the agent
a discount in exchange for steering his business toward that hotel.

106

Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Another great source for finding hotel deals is the Internet. Nowadays,
almost all hotels, even those in the budget range, have Web sites. (I list
each hotel’s Web site with the other hotel information.) Special promo-
tional offers are often available only on the hotel’s Web site, so it pays to
do some checking.
You can also use search engines to help you locate a London hotel.
Although the major travel-booking Web sites (Travelocity, Expedia,
Yahoo!, and Smarter Living) offer hotel booking, you may be better off
using a Web site devoted to lodging because more-general sites don’t list
all types of properties. Some lodging sites specialize in a particular type
of accommodations, such as bed-and-breakfast inns, which aren’t on the
more mainstream booking services. Other services, such as TravelWeb
(see the following list), offer weekend deals on major chain properties
that cater to business travelers and have more empty rooms on the
weekends.
Some good all-purpose Web sites that you can use to track down and
make online reservations at hotels in London include the following:
 All Hotels on the Web (www.all-hotels.com) doesn’t actually
include all the hotels on the Web, but it does have tens of thou-
sands of listings throughout the world, including London. Bear in
mind that each hotel in the list has paid a fee ($25 and up) for
placement, so the list is not objective, but more like online
brochures.
 British Hotel Reservation Centre (www.bhrc.co.uk) lists current
and seasonal specials at selected London hotels.
 HotelDiscount.com (www.hoteldiscount.com) lists bargain rates
at hotels in U.S. and international cities, including London. If you
click “London” and input your travel dates, the site provides a list of
the best prices for a selection of hotels in various neighborhoods.
 Independent Traveller (www.gowithit.co.uk) lists hundreds of
self-catering accommodations in London. These are private flats,
not hotels, and are available for a one-week minimum period; they
can be a fantastic bargain.
 London Bed & Breakfast (www.londonbandb.com) can provide
inexpensive accommodations in select private homes.
 London Bed and Breakfast Agency Ltd. (www.londonbb.com) is
another reliable B&B-finder in London.
 Londontown (www.londontown.com) has a long list of hotels to
choose from, including some with special offers.
 Refresh Accommodation (www.refreshaccommodation.com) acts
as the booking agent for self-catering flats and hotel rooms
throughout London and offers all-inclusive (tax included) prices.
Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 107

 Seniors Travel Guide (http://seniorstravelguide.com) is a
site for seniors looking for special hotels and other forms of accom-
modations, including home and apartment exchanges.
 TravelWeb (www.travelweb.com) lists more than 16,000 hotels
worldwide, focusing on chains, such as Hyatt and Hilton. You can
book almost 90 percent of the properties online. Its Click-It Week-
ends, updated each Monday, offers weekend deals at many leading
chains.
 Uptown Reservations (www.uptownres.co.uk) provides listings
for dozens of B&Bs in private homes in London.
Reserving the best room
After you know where you’re staying, asking a few more questions can help
you land the best possible room. For example:
 Ask about staying in a corner room. They’re usually larger, 
quieter, and brighter, but they may cost a bit more.
 Ask about staying in a room in the back of the building. In
London, traffic noise can be loud and annoying. In the back, you
may get a room that overlooks a quiet garden.
 If your London hotel is a high-rise, request a room on a high
floor. Being farther away from the street means your room may be
quieter. Plus, a higher room may give you the added bonus of a
better view.
 Ask whether the hotel is renovating. If the answer is yes, request a
room away from the renovation work, and make sure you ask again
when you check in.
 If you have any physical impairments, be sure to ask whether the
hotel has a lift (elevator). Many small and older hotels in London
do not have elevators. If the hotel lacks a lift, ask whether a ground-
floor (first floor) room is available.
 Inquire about the location of restaurants, bars, and meeting facil-
ities, which can be noisy.
 If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, return to
the front desk right away. If another room is available, the staff
should be able to accommodate you, within reason.
Arriving without a Reservation
Whatever your hotel choice in London, I want to remind you again:
Booking ahead is a good idea. Why waste precious vacation time search-
ing for a hotel? If you do arrive without a reservation, your first option is
to start calling the hotels directly. Keep in mind that smaller B&Bs may
not accept reservations late in the evening. You can also book rooms
Part III: Settling into London 
108

through the trustworthy agencies in the following list, but the first one
doesn’t have phone service so you must show up in person.
 The Britain & London Visitor Centre (1 Lower Regent St.; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus) is open weekdays 9 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. (from 
9:30 a.m. on Mon) and on Saturday and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
(Sat June–Sept 9 a.m.–5 p.m.). You have to show up in person to 
get help reserving a room.
 British Hotel Reservation Centre (% 020/7340-1616; www.bhrc.
co.uk) offers a 24-hour phone line. The center provides free reser-
vations and discounted rates at all the leading hotel groups and the
major independents. This agency operates a reservations desk
(open daily 6 a.m. to midnight) at the Underground station of
Heathrow Airport.
 First Option Hotel Reservations (% 020/7808-3861) is another
hotel booking service. This hotel booking agency operates 
kiosks at the following Central London rail stations: Charing Cross
(% 020/7976-1171); Euston (% 020/7388-7435); Kings Cross, by
Platform 8 (% 020/7837-5681); Paddington (% 020/7723-0184);
and Victoria, by Platform 9 (% 020/7828-4646).
London’s Top Hotels
Every recommended hotel in this chapter has a $ symbol to help you
home in on your price limit. These symbols reflect a hotel’s high- and
low-end rack rates for a double room. Table 9-1 shows what you can

upper end of the price scale). Be sure to ask, though, so you won’t get an
unpleasant surprise when you’re checking out. Unless I note otherwise,
the VAT is included in the rates for my recommended hotels.
Part III: Settling into London 
110

The Abbey Court
$$–$$$$
Notting Hill
This small, graceful hotel, with a flower-filled front patio and a rear con-
servatory where breakfast is served, is located in a renovated mid-
Victorian townhouse near Kensington Gardens. The 22 charming guest
rooms feature 18th- and 19th-century country antiques and marble bath-
rooms equipped with Jacuzzi tubs, showers, and heated towel racks. You
can enjoy 24-hour room service and take advantage of the services of the
concierge, who can help arrange for babysitting.
See map p. 120. 20 Pembridge Gardens, W2 4DU. % 020/7221-7518. Fax: 020/7792-
0858. www.abbeycourthotel.co.uk. Tube: Notting Hill Gate (then a 5-minute
walk north on Pembridge Gardens Road). Rack rates: £110–£170 ($220–$340) double.

Aster House
$$$–$$$$
South Kensington
Found at the end of an early Victorian terrace, this beautifully renovated
charmer is a former two-time winner of the London Tourism Bed and
Breakfast of the Year Award. Each of the 12 guest rooms is individually dec-
orated in English country-house style, some with four-poster, half-
canopied beds and silk wallpaper. The new bathrooms come with power
showers. The breakfasts, served in the glassed-in garden conservatory,
are more health-conscious than those served in most English B&Bs.
See map p. 118. 3 Sumner Place (near Onslow Square), SW7 3EE. % 020/7581-5888.
Fax: 020/7584-4925. www.asterhouse.com. Tube: South Kensington (then a 5-
minute walk west on Old Brompton Road and south on Sumner Place). Rack rates:
£165–£220 ($330–$440) double. Continental breakfast included. MC, V.
Astons Apartments
$–$$
South Kensington
In three carefully restored Victorian redbrick town houses, Astons offers
value-packed self-catering accommodations, some ideal for families. Each
studio has a compact kitchenette; a small bathroom; and bright, functional
furnishings. The more expensive executive studios feature larger bath-
rooms, more living space, and extra pizzazz in the décor. If you like the
idea of having your own cozy London apartment (with daily maid service),
you can’t do better. Cots and cribs are available for kids.
See map p. 118. 31 Rosary Gardens (off Hereford Square), SW7 4NQ. % 800/525-2810
in the U.S. or 020/7590-6000. Fax: 020/7590-6060. www.astons-apartments.com.
Tube: Gloucester Road (then a 5-minute walk south on Gloucester Road and west on
Hereford Square; Rosary Gardens is 1 block farther west). Rack rates: £99–£130
($198–$260) double. Rates don’t include 17.5 percent VAT. AE, MC, V.

Chapter 9: Checking In at London’s Best Hotels and B&Bs 113

Avonmore Hotel
$
Kensington
This small hotel is in a quiet neighborhood easily accessible to West End
theaters and shops. You’d be hard-pressed to find more for your money:
Each of the nine guest rooms offers a tasteful décor and an array of ameni-
ties not usually found in this price range. A few years ago, this establish-
ment was voted London’s best private hotel by the Automobile Association
(AA), and the high standards that earned that honor are still maintained. An
English breakfast is served in a cheerful breakfast room; a bar and limited
room service are also available, and the hotel can arrange for babysitting.
See map p. 118. 66 Avonmore Rd. (northwest of Earl’s Court), W14 8RS. % 020/7603-
4296. Fax: 020/7603-4035. www.avonmorehotel.co.uk. Tube: West Kensington
(then a 5-minute walk north on North End Road and Mattheson Road to Avonmore
Road). Rack rates: £60–£90 ($111–$167) double without bathroom, £80–£100
($160–$200) double with bathroom. English breakfast included. AE, MC, V.
B+B Belgravia
$$
Belgravia
Close to Victoria Station, this small, comfortable, contemporary B&B
favors simple, modern design over the old-fashioned chintzes and furni-
ture of so many London B&Bs. Rooms have a spare, cool look and come
with a bath or shower. The lobby is a nice little gathering spot where you
can relax and get fresh tea and coffee 24/7. Breakfast is either continental
or English, cooked up right in front of your eyes in the open kitchen. Free
Wi-Fi and Internet access are among the amenities.
See map p. 115. 64–66 Ebury St., SW1W 9QD. % 020/7259-8570. Fax: 020/7259-8591.
www.bb-belgravia.com. Tube: Victoria (then a 10-minute walk south on Bucking-
ham Palace Road, west on Eccleston Street, and south on Ebury Street). Rack rates:
£107–£117 ($214–$234). English breakfast included. MC, V.
Bryanston Court Hotel
$$
Marylebone
Located in a neighborhood with many attractive squares, this 200-year-old
hotel is one of Central London’s finest in the moderate price range. The
refurbished hotel has 54 small guest rooms (with equally small bathrooms)
that are comfortably furnished and well maintained. You find a welcoming
bar with a fireplace in the back of the lounge.
See map p. 120. 56–60 Great Cumberland Place (near Marble Arch), W1H 7FD. 
% 020/7262-3141. Fax: 020/7262-7248. www.bryanstonhotel.com. Tube: Marble
Arch (then a 5-minute walk north on Great Cumberland Place to Bryanston Place).
Rack rates: £120 ($240) double. Continental breakfast included. AE, DC, MC, V.

Byron Hotel
$$
Bayswater
The 45-room Byron occupies a Victorian house that’s been thoroughly
modernized but hasn’t lost its traditional atmosphere. The guest rooms
have ample closets, tile baths, and good lighting. Breakfast is served in a
cheery dining room. The staff members are pleasant and helpful, and the
hotel can provide child cots and help with special requirements for chil-
dren’s meals. Considering the amenities offered, this establishment offers
an especially good value.

Queensway (then a 5-minute walk east on Bayswater Road and north on Queens-
borough Terrace). Rack rates: £120 ($240) double. English or continental breakfast
included. AE, DC, MC, V.
Cadogan Hotel
$$$$$
Chelsea
You feel transported back to the Victorian era at this beautiful 69-room
hotel, with a small wood-paneled lobby and sumptuous drawing room
(good for afternoon tea), close to all the exclusive Knightsbridge shops.
The Cadogan (pronounced cah-dug-en) is the hotel where poet, playwright,
and novelist Oscar Wilde was staying when he was arrested (Room 118 is
the Oscar Wilde Room). The large guest rooms, many overlooking the
Cadogan Place gardens, are quietly tasteful and splendidly comfortable,
with large bathrooms. The sedate Edwardian restaurant is known for its
excellent cuisine.

Square (then a 5-minute walk north on Sloane Street). Rack rates: £255–£355
($510–$710) double. Rates don’t include 17.5 percent VAT. AE, MC, V.
Cartref House
$
Westminster and Victoria
Cartref House is among the top budget B&Bs in London. Each guest room
is individually designed and comfortably furnished; some of the larger
ones contain bunk beds, which makes them suitable for families. All have
small private bathrooms. The English breakfast is hearty (but ends at 8:30
a.m.), and the place is remarkably well kept. There’s no elevator, but guests
don’t seem to mind. Friendly, personal service makes this a winner.
See map p. 115. 108 and 129 Ebury St. (near Victoria Station), SW1W 9QD. % 020/
7730-6176. Fax: 020/7730-7338. www.jamesandcartref.co.uk. Tube: Victoria
Station (then a 10-minute walk south on Buckingham Palace Road, west on Eccleston
Street, and south on Ebury Street). Rack rates: £90 ($180) double. English breakfast

Part III: Settling into London 
122

Claverley Hotel
$$–$$$$
Knightsbridge
On a quiet Knightsbridge cul-de-sac a few blocks from Harrods, this cozy
place is considered one of London’s best B&Bs. The public rooms feature
Georgian-era accessories, 19th-century oil portraits, elegant antiques, and
leather-covered sofas. The 29 guest rooms are smart and cozy, with marble
bathrooms with tubs and power showers. The price includes an excellent
English breakfast.
See map p. 118. 13–14 Beaufort Gardens (off Brompton Road), SW3 1PS. % 800/747-
0398 in the U.S. or 020/7589-8541. Fax: 020/7584-3410. www.claverleyhotel.

fast included. AE, DC, MC, V.
Comfort Inn Notting Hill
$$
Notting Hill
You’ll get a lower room rate at this chain-hotel franchise if you book
directly with the hotel instead of through central reservations. Located on
a quiet, pretty street off Notting Hill Gate, the Comfort Inn stretches across

Covent Garden Hotel

Covent Garden
Created from an 1850s French hospital and dispensary, this boutique hotel
surrounds guests in luxury. No two of the 50 guest rooms are alike. Many
rooms have large windows with rooftop views. The décor is a lush mix of
antiques and fine contemporary furniture, and the granite-tiled bathrooms
with glass-walled showers and heated towel racks are among the best in
London. The wood-paneled public rooms are just as impressive. On-site
Brasserie Max serves up eclectic bistro food and is a chic place to lunch.
If you don’t get enough exercise touring London, you can keep in shape at
the small gym on the premises.

On a quiet street near South Kensington’s museums, the Cranley occupies
a quartet of restored 1875 town houses. Luxuriously appointed public
rooms and 39 high-ceilinged, air-conditioned guest rooms — with original

Marylebone
This sophisticated, 38-room, luxury boutique hotel occupies a beautifully

Fairways Hotel

Paddington
This large, late-Georgian house from the 1820s is a real bargain. Stephen
Adams, who took over the management from his parents (they ran the
hotel for 25 years), made several improvements in 2002, laying new car-
peting and redoing all the shared toilets and showers. All 17 rooms are dif-
ferent, the ones in back much quieter. Some of the private bathrooms are
much smaller than others. Coffeemakers and hair dryers are in the rooms,
but the phone is in the hallway and, to keep prices low, breakfast is not
included in the room rate.

Fielding Hotel

Covent Garden
Named for author Henry Fielding (famous for The History of Tom Jones),
the Fielding is on a beautiful, old street (now pedestrian-only) lit by 19th-
century gaslights and across from the Royal Opera House. The stairways
are steep and narrow (the hotel has no elevator), and the 24 rather
cramped guest rooms are undistinguished in décor, but they do have
showers and toilets. Those quibbles aside, this quirky hotel is an excel-
lent value. A small bar is on the premises, and the area is loaded with cafes,
restaurants, and fabulous shopping.

South Kensington
This relatively unknown 36-room hotel, located near the cultural and retail
attractions in South Kensington and Knightsbridge, occupies two com-
pletely restored and converted Georgian residences. The elegant guest
rooms are individually designed and include half-canopied beds and
marble-tiled bathrooms. The lounge, with its rich mahogany paneling and
moldings and deep colors, has the ambience of a private club. The over-
all décor is wonderfully Victorian, but every modern convenience is avail-
able, including Wi-Fi. Two of the suites have their own roof terraces.

Notting Hill
This tiny, three-story building dates from the 1820s (when people were evi-
dently much smaller), so the six color-coordinated guest rooms are
cramped but atmospheric, and the stairs are steep. The Gate is one of only
two hotels along the length of Portobello Road, famous for its antiques
shops and Saturday bric-a-brac stalls. Kensington Gardens is a five-minute

If you dream of the days of Queen Victoria, you’ll definitely appreciate the
Victorian-era charm of the Gore, which has been in more or less continu-

the Royal Albert Hall, the Gore is loaded with historic charm: walnut-and-
mahogany paneling, oriental rugs, and 19th-century prints. Each of the 54
guest rooms is unique, filled with high-quality antiques and elegant fur-
nishings, including old commodes that conceal the toilets.

Grange Strathmore Hotel
$$–$$$
South Kensington
Formerly the residence of the 14th earl of Strathmore, the late Queen
Mum’s father, this hotel overlooks a private garden square just minutes
from the South Ken museums. Some of the guest rooms feature a high-
ceilinged spaciousness rare in London hotels, and bathrooms with tubs
and showers. Plenty of hand-carved rosewood furniture and well-chosen
fabrics decorate the rooms. One drawback is that, on weekends, no gen-
eral manager is on duty; also, service can sometimes be rather impersonal.

In the heart of Bloomsbury, this wonderfully personable and immaculately

staircases (no elevators) and hallways. The 44 guest rooms are pleasantly
comfy, some graced with floral prints and double-glazed windows to cut
down on noise; the best rooms are on the second and third levels. The
bathrooms are very small, however. The hotel has family rooms and can
provide cots for children. Guests have use of the tennis courts in

Recent restoration exposed original wood paneling and other features
hidden for years, but the hotel still lacks an elevator. The charming
Georgian-era guest rooms feature mahogany and pine furnishings and
antiques, as well as lovely bathrooms, many with claw-foot tubs. The back
rooms are quieter; the front rooms are lighter, but without the quieting

The Montague
$$$$–$$$$$
Bloomsbury
For service and sheer sumptuousness, you won’t find a better hotel any-
where in the vicinity of the British Museum — which happens to be right
across the street from the Montague. Every room in this immaculately kept
property has been individually decorated and features every amenity you
can think of, from twice-daily maid service with evening turndown to lux-
uriously equipped bathrooms. The airy gardenside conservatory is a
delightful spot for afternoon tea or a cocktail, and the Chef’s Table restau-
rant is an enjoyable spot for lunch or dinner.

Number Sixteen
$$$–$$$$
South Kensington
Gardeners will appreciate the award-winning gardens at this luxuriously
appointed B&B in four early-Victorian town houses. The 40 guest rooms
feature an eclectic mix of English antiques and modern paintings, and the
bathrooms are large by London standards. The rooms look out over the
private gardens of Sumner Place. On chilly days, you find a fire crackling
in the drawing-room fireplace. Breakfast is served in the rooms, but if the
weather’s fine, you can have it in the garden and enjoy the fish pond and
the bubbling fountain.

Park Lane Sheraton Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Mayfair
Sometimes called the “Iron Lady of Piccadilly” because it’s so well built,
this landmark hotel opened in 1927. Executive rooms and suites are dec-
orated with a warm mix of classic English furnishings and have beautiful
marble bathrooms. The price goes up according to location (particularly
if it’s a suite overlooking Green Park), size, and décor. Every conceivable
amenity is available. The Palm Court Lounge (see Chapter 10) is a swank
place for afternoon tea, and two restaurants are on the premises.

Regency Hotel
$–$$$
South Kensington
This hotel occupies six refitted Victorian terrace houses. A Chippendale
fireplace graces the lobby, and five Empire chandeliers suspended verti-
cally, one on top of the other, hang in one of the stairwells. The 210 modern
guest rooms are subdued and attractive, with good-size bathrooms. The
one downside is that the air-conditioning system on the west side of the
building can be pretty loud on hot summer nights. Guests can use the
health club with steam rooms and saunas.

Rhodes Hotel
$
Paddington
The personable owner of the Rhodes recently spruced up the entire hotel,
adding hand-painted, Greek-inspired murals to the public areas. Other
improvements include air-conditioning in the main part of the hotel
(though not in the annex, which is why rooms are cheaper there) and data-
ports for Internet access in all 18 guest rooms. The room décor is quite
simple and comfortable; bathrooms are small but well kept. Room 220 has
its own little private roof terrace, complete with table and chairs.

Royal Lancaster
$–$$$$$
Bayswater
I happen to like big old hotels that keep themselves in good condition and
retain a sense of friendly courtesy. The Royal Lancaster has been around
for ages, and it’s one of those hotels that have a loyal clientele. The hotel
sits directly across from Hyde Park, and the airy city and park views from
the upper floors are among the best in London. The rooms are decorated
with a modern flair and have marble bathrooms, air-conditioning, 
and double-glazing to cut down on the traffic noise. You can usually find a
room in every price range, but go for the higher floors with a park view if
you can.

St. Margaret’s Hotel
$
Bloomsbury
The welcome that you get here inspires devoted loyalty. Mrs. Marazzi is
the second generation of her family to run this nonsmoking B&B, which
rambles over four houses. The 64 rooms are simple and immaculate, and
no two are alike. Only about 10 rooms have private bathrooms, but the
Marazzis recently created some extra public bathrooms, so it’s easy to sur-
vive the sharing experience. Some rooms look out onto the quiet commu-
nal garden that all the guests can use. Babysitting can be arranged.

Stylotel
$
Paddington
Stylotel and B+B Belgravia (reviewed earlier in this chapter) prove that
budget hotels don’t have to be dull and conventional when it comes to
interior design. Housed in two 19th-century town houses, this B&B fea-
tures a small, modern lobby and small, modern guest rooms fitted out with
aluminum wallcoverings, big mirrors, upholstered headboards, and one-
piece prefabricated bathrooms with shower.

Twenty Nevern Square
$$$
Earl’s Court
This sumptuously refurbished boutique hotel in a Victorian town house
overlooking Nevern Square shows off the gentrified side of Earl’s Court.
The look throughout is plush and glamorous, with great attention paid to
detail. The 20 bedrooms are all individually designed with an emphasis on
natural materials, such as linen, cotton, silk, and wood. The bathrooms
are just as lovely. The hotel has its own bar and restaurant, Café Twenty.

22 Jermyn Street
$$$$
St. James’s
This chic 18-room boutique hotel near Piccadilly Circus is an Edwardian
town house on an exclusive street where almost every shop has a Royal
Warrant (the sign of official royal patronage). In the richly appointed guest
rooms, contemporary décor and fabrics mix with antique furnishings to
create a stylish and comfortable ambience. The granite bathrooms are just
as nice. Many amenities and 24-hour room service are available.

The Vicarage Hotel
$–$$
Kensington
The family-run Vicarage offers old-world English charm, hospitality, and a
good value. The hotel is on a residential garden square close to High Street
Kensington and Kensington Palace. The 18 guest rooms, individually fur-
nished in Victorian style, can accommodate up to four; Room 19 on the
top floor is particularly charming. Some of the double and twin rooms have
small bathrooms. The hotel welcomes children and will arrange for
babysitting; however, the hotel isn’t really equipped to deal with the needs
of the under-3 set. Many guests return here year after year.

Westminster and Victoria
One of the best choices along Belgrave Road, this 18-room hotel is owned
and managed by Jimmy McGoldrick, who goes out of his way to make his
customers happy. Guests have been returning for 20 years, and if you stay
here you’ll understand why. Jimmy’s staff maintains an extremely high
level of service and cleanliness. The recently refurbished guest rooms are
comfortable and well decorated. Each room has a small private bathroom
with a good shower. Guests are served a big English breakfast in a lovely
and inviting room. A sleek modernity is displayed throughout — rare in
small London hotels.

Dining and Snacking 
in London
In This Chapter
 Discovering what’s new and what’s hot
 Locating the best dining neighborhoods
 Reviewing my favorite restaurants in London
 Listing restaurants by neighborhood, cuisine, and price
L
ondon’s dining scene now offers a vast array of culinary choices;
more than 5,700 restaurants prepare the cuisines of more than 60
countries. But you can still find traditional English dishes in London:
Yorkshire pudding, fish and chips, or bangers and mash (sausages and
mashed potatoes). So if you want to sample the old cuisine, you won’t
be disappointed. This chapter explains what you need to know about
new trends; traditional, modern, and ethnic cuisines; spots favored by
locals; and finding a bargain. I list my favorite London dining spots, too.
For a glossary of English food terms, see the Cheat Sheet at the begin-
ning of this book.
Getting the Dish on the Local Scene
London is now considered one of the food capitals of the world, and its
restaurant scene is a volatile one. To be trendy and talked about, a London
restaurant must have a celebrity owner, a celebrity chef, a solid reputation,
a great view, a chic location, and/or an unmistakable ambience — and, of
course, memorable food helps, too. But two trends are worth noting: The
days of Sir Terence Conran’s mega-eateries — places that held hundreds of
diners — are pretty much over; and, in a city where even an ordinary meal
can easily cost £25 ($50), Londoners are looking more and more toward
ethnic foods and restaurants that don’t charge exorbitant prices.
Multicultural London is always in the midst of culinary evolution. The
local food horizon expanded as the postwar generation began to travel
and experience new cuisines outside England, and as “exotic” foods and
spices became more readily available in the English markets.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 143
“Plain English cooking” —hearty, old-fashioned, and sometimes consid-
ered dull — is certainly still prevalent in London, and the style is even
enjoying renewed interest and respect. The best traditional dishes —
game, lamb, meat and fish pies, and roast beef with Yorkshire pudding —
are readily available. Modern British cuisine takes old standards and
deliciously reinvents them with foreign influences and ingredients,
mostly from France (sauces), the Mediterranean (olive oil, oregano, 
and garlic), and northern Italy (pasta, polenta, and risotto). Besides
Modern British, London foodies continue to favor classic French and
Italian cuisines. (For more on English cooking, see Chapter 2.)
Indian cooking has been a favorite ethnic food for some time. In fact,
curry is now considered a “national” dish. London is filled with Indian
restaurants (about 1,500 of them) serving curries and dishes cooked in
clay tandoori pots. Balti, a thick curry from Pakistan, is one of the more
recent ethnic must-try dishes in London. Other new influences making
their way into Modern British cooking come from Thailand and
Morocco.
If you want to dine in a restaurant, reserving a table is always a good
idea. At all but the smartest London restaurants, you can usually get a
table on fairly short notice during the week, especially if you’re willing 
to dine before 7 p.m. or after 9 p.m.
With the passage of the new nonsmoking ordinances of 2007, you can
now be assured that your meal in any London restaurant and pub will 
be smoke-free.
Discovering the top dining areas
London offers a mouth-watering mix of restaurants; you can enjoy 
a wide variety of foods throughout the city. Soho and neighboring
Covent Garden offer the most choices in the West End, with African,
British, Caribbean, Eastern European, French, Italian, Japanese, Korean,
Middle Eastern, Modern European, Mongolian, North American, South
American, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and vegetarian all represented. South
Kensington makes up another eclectic grab bag of culinary choices.
Unlike some other large cities, ethnic restaurants aren’t grouped
together within specific areas of Central London. However, several
Chinese restaurants are clustered along Lisle, Wardour, and Gerrard
streets in Soho’s Chinatown. And Notting Hill has long been a standby
for low-price Indian and Caribbean restaurants.
Eating with the locals
Londoners, like the residents in any large city, have their favorite neigh-
borhood eateries. Pubs, cafes, and wine bars are places where locals go
for casual meals that aren’t as expensive as restaurants.

144
Ordering up pub grub
If you’re not into ethnic dining, then pubs are your best bet for getting a
good meal for a low price. Until fairly recently, pub food was generally
traditional and down to earth: meat pies and mash (mashed potatoes),
fish and chips, mixed grills (sausages and a chop or cutlet), salads, 
sandwiches, and the famous ploughman’s lunch (bread and cheese, 
or pâté). But lately, a multi-ethnic variety of current food faves has
changed the cooking in many a pub kitchen, and you’re now just as
likely to encounter curries and kebabs as fish and chips. Pub food may
be prepackaged and frozen and then microwaved. However, more and
more pubs resemble casual restaurants. A new genre of pub restaurants
exists called gastropubs, where the cooking is fresher, more adventurous,
and better prepared than at traditional pubs.
Pubs are drop-in places, and finding a table at lunchtime isn’t always
easy. Pubs don’t accept reservations. Usually, you order your food from
the serving counter and your drinks from the bar, and then seat yourself.
Sometimes you get table service. Pub grub is generally washed down
with beer, the British national drink. Draft beer in Britain is served at
room temperature, as are most soft drinks. Bottled imported beer,
served cold, is generally available but more expensive.
Unless a pub has a special children’s certificate, kids under 14 are
allowed only into the gardens and separate family rooms. The legal
drinking age in the United Kingdom is 18, although restaurants can 
serve beer or cider to kids over 16 who order a meal.
Wining and dining at wine bars
Londoners may love to knock back a pint of beer at their local pub, but
when it comes to restaurant dining, wine is the favored accompaniment.
You can get wine in a pub, but the choices will be limited. Wine bars, on
the other hand, are dedicated to good food and good grape, most of it
imported from France, Australia, and South America. Wine bars are more
upscale than pubs. Like pubs, wine bars don’t permit children under 14,
except in gardens or family rooms. Be aware that a meal in a wine bar
costs more than a similar meal in a pub.
Kicking back at cafes
London’s cafes generally serve light, inexpensive food and offer limited
menus. Most people enjoy a cup of coffee or pot of tea and a sandwich,
but you’ll also find pastas, salads, and burgers. The cakes and other
sweets may tempt you, too.
Gays and lesbians on the lookout for low-priced meals in groovy gay-
friendly environments flock to Soho’s gay cafes and bars. These trendy
hangouts serve good, reasonably priced meals and pay serious attention
to décor.

Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 145
Trimming the Fat from Your Budget
If the thought of paying $50 for dinner tabs gives you heartburn, you can
visit pubs, cafes, sandwich bars, and pizza places to get good, economi-
cal food. And, of course, you can find fast-food chains throughout the
city. Another alternative: supermarkets, where you can buy take-away
meals and dine in your hotel room or outdoors in one of London’s beauti-
ful parks. In addition, many of London’s top restaurants offer fixed-price
meals (also called set-price or prix-fixe meals), which allow you to order
two to three courses from a limited menu for a set price that is cheaper
than ordering the courses individually. Sometimes these bargains are
called pre- or post-theater menus, and they’re served only from about 5:30
to 7 p.m. and after 9:30 p.m. Wine is expensive, so forgo that if price is an
issue. And try your splurge-dining at lunch, when prices are often one-
third less than those at dinner and the food is the same. Remember that
tap water (never iced) will be brought to your table only if you request it,
and your glass will not be automatically refilled. If you order water, and
don’t specify tap water, you’ll get bottled water (either still or “fizzy”).
Restaurants automatically add that annoying 17.5 percent value-added
tax (VAT) to your tab. They may tack on a moderate cover charge for
bread (even if you don’t eat it), as well.
Plenty of unwary tourists double-tip without realizing it. Some restau-
rants add a service charge to your bill and also have a tip area on the
credit card receipt that you sign. Be aware that the words service charge
included on a menu mean that a gratuity will automatically be added to
your bill. When the bill arrives, you’re not expected to leave any addi-
tional tip. If the menu says service not included, however, leave a tip of 10
percent to 15 percent for acceptable service.
At the end of a meal, Americans ask for a “check,” whereas Brits ask for
the “bill.”
London’s Best Restaurants
As London is home to more than 5,700 restaurants, deciding which estab-
lishments to include in this chapter of my favorites was a monumental
task. I try to cover as much of Central London as possible. If you want to
Roast beef or royalty?
In a 2006 poll, adults in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland were asked to
come up with an icon that summed up “traditional England.” The monarchy was the
most popular choice at 48 percent. The runner-up was roast beef at 42 percent.

Part III: Settling into London 
146
get the flavor of merry old England, I include some of the oldest and 
most respected London restaurants serving traditional English food. For
the more chic and trendy, I include restaurants that serve the best of
Modern British cuisine, as well as hybrids of British/French and British/
Continental. For people on a budget — or those who just want to eat in 
a down-to-earth, amiable environment — I also review some of the best
London pubs. All the establishments are easy to get to, and you can reach
all of them by taking the Underground (Tube) system and perhaps walking
a bit. For indexes of the restaurants by neighborhood, cuisine, and price,
see the end of this chapter. For locations, refer to the maps in this chapter.
Each restaurant I review is given one to four dollar signs ($). The dollar
signs indicate the average price of a meal, including an appetizer, entree,
and nonalcoholic beverage. Table 10-1 lists the dollar amounts used for
each dollar sign. Please bear in mind that if you order the most expen-
sive entree and a bottle of wine, a $$ restaurant will become a $$$$
restaurant. On the other hand, if you order from a set-price menu, a $$$$
restaurant tab may dip down to $$.

The Kid Friendly icon in front of a restaurant name indicates that the
place is suitable for families with children. These restaurants welcome
families and may offer a children’s menu.
Note that restaurant prices in this chapter do not include the 17.5 per-
cent value-added tax (VAT). Unfortunately, you can’t avoid paying this
extra expense.
The skinny on the beef
Sirloin, so the story goes, got its name from James I when he was a guest at Houghton
Tower in Lancashire. When a succulent leg of beef was placed before him, he knighted
it with his dagger, crying, “Arise, Sir Loin!”

Aubergine
$$$$
Chelsea
FRENCH
You compete with celebrities, royalty, and commoners for the privilege of
dining at this top-name restaurant, and you have to give your credit card
number when booking and be prepared to pay £50 ($100) if you don’t
show. Every dish, from the fish and lighter Mediterranean-style choices to
assiette of veal with watercress and artichokes, is a culinary achievement
of the highest order, winning chef William Drabble a Michelin star. The cel-
ebrated cappuccino of white beans with grated truffle makes a perfect
ending to a superb dining experience. Service is polished and efficient.

Boxwood Café
$$$
Knightsbridge
MODERN BRITISH
This may be the most stylish kid-friendly restaurant in London, but grown-
ups will find plenty of comforting delights on the menu, too. Created by
culinary superstar Gordon Ramsay, Boxwood Café is chic without being
fussy, and the same goes for the food, which emphasizes fresh and healthy
dishes ranging from fresh steamed fish to glazed pea-and-leek tart, roast
chicken salad, wine-braised veal, and steaks.

Brasserie St. Quentin
$$
South Kensington
FRENCH
London’s most authentic-looking French brasserie, St. Quentin attracts
many people in the city’s French community (a positive sign for a French
restaurant outside of France). Mirrors and crystal chandeliers add a touch
of elegance. The brasserie has excellent-value fixed-price meals, two or
three courses, both at lunch and pre-theater. These menus offer a blend of
classic and updated French fare, from shoulder of lamb with root vegeta-
bles to poached halibut, chicken breast with lemon and thyme, and fish
soup. Vegetarian options include artichoke fondant with seasonal vegeta-
bles, spinach ravioli, and warm leek salad.

Cafe in the Crypt
$
Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square
BRITISH
Eating in a crypt may not be everyone’s idea of fun, but eating in this 
crypt — below St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields church on Trafalgar Square — is
an inexpensive London dining experience that you won’t forget. The food
is basic but good, served cafeteria-style. Choose from a big salad bar; tra-
ditional main courses, such as shepherd’s pie; filled rolls; and hearty
soups. One fixture is that most traditional of British desserts, bread-and-
butter pudding (bread soaked in eggs and milk with currants or sultanas
and then oven-baked). The cavernous, candlelit room with its stone pil-
lars and gravestones is wonderfully atmospheric. This is also a good place
to come for afternoon tea.

Tube: Charing Cross (then a 3-minute walk west to Trafalgar Square). Main courses:
£5.95–£7.50 ($12–$15); fixed-price meal £5.25 ($11), afternoon tea £4.95 ($10). No credit
cards. Open: Mon–Sat 11:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m., Thurs–Sat 11:30 a.m.–10:15 p.m., Sun
noon to 5 p.m.
Canteen
$–$$
Spitalfields
TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Canteen looks so hip and modern you might expect some kind of flashy,
faddy cuisine to be on the menu. Wrong. This is classic English cooking,
almost like you would have gotten in a cafeteria 20 years ago. All-day
breakfasts (including toasted crumpets), light dishes (like a leek-and-
cheese tart), and sturdier main courses (rib-eye steak and chips) are avail-
able. You can even get a glass of Horlick’s malted milk. This is great stop-in
spot if you’re prowling around the new Spitalfields Market in the East End.
See map p. 148. 2 Crispin Place (off Brushfield Street), E1. % 0845/686-1122. www.
canteen.co.uk. Tube: Aldgate East (then a 10-minute walk north on Commercial

Chelsea Kitchen
$
Chelsea
INTERNATIONAL
A London institution, Chelsea Kitchen has been serving locals and drop-
ins since 1961 and hasn’t changed much since — except that now it’s sur-
rounded by a sea of trendy, expensive eateries. At this simple place with
a dinerlike atmosphere, both the plates and the crowds move fast. Menu
staples include leek-and-potato soup, chicken parmigiana, spaghetti
Bolognese, omelets, burgers, goulash, and lamb chops. Kids enjoy the
casual atmosphere and simple foods. Far from fancy, but still good.
See map p. 152. 98 King’s Rd. (off Sloane Square), SW3. % 020/7589-1330. Reservations
recommended. Tube: Sloane Square (the restaurant is at the beginning of King’s Road

Cigala
$$
Bloomsbury
SPANISH
This hip, clean-lined, Spanish-inspired restaurant serves great tapas. Order
two or three tapas per person and then share. Some possibilities include
chorizo (sausage with hot paprika sauce), oak-smoked cured beef, mari-
nated sardines, wind-dried tuna, olives, and scrambled eggs with arti-
chokes. At lunch or dinner, you may prefer to begin with something like
grilled razor clams, and follow up with an entree of pork belly with beans.
The vegetarian stew is bland and not particularly memorable, but the
paella, which requires 30 minutes of preparation, is delectable.
See map p. 150. 54 Lamb’s Conduit St., WC1N 3LW. % 020/7405-1717. www.cigala.

£19 ($32–$38), fixed-price lunch Sun £11 ($22). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 
10:45 p.m., Sat 12:30–10:45 p.m., Sun noon to 9:45 p.m.
Clarke’s
$$$
Notting Hill
MODERN EUROPEAN
This bright modern restaurant, owned by chef Sally Clarke, has had a loyal
following since opening in the 1980s. The menu changes daily but always
emphasizes British produce and California-style charcoal-grilled foods
with herbs and organically grown vegetables. A typical meal may include
an appetizer of grilled goat cheese crostini with fresh tomato chutney; an
entree of wild sea bass roasted with tarragon and lemon hollandaise; fol-
lowed by an assortment of cheeses with oatmeal biscuits and celery, plus
warm bitter chocolate pudding with whipped cream and raspberries.
There’s a fixed-price dinner menu.

Criterion Bar & Grill
$$–$$$
Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square
BRITISH/FRENCH
It’s almost worth coming to the Criterion just to see its Byzantine palace
interior with gold-vaulted ceiling. The food — a mixture of modern French
and British standards — doesn’t quite match the grandeur of the décor,
but it’s generally quite good. You can order Brit faves like haddock or
sausages, or French faves like slow-roast duck with applesauce or steak
au poivre. This place is smack-dab on Piccadilly Circus, so it’s wonderfully
convenient. The fixed-price lunches and dinners are a great deal.
See map p. 150. 224 Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7930-0488. Reservations recommended.
Tube: Piccadilly Circus (the restaurant is right on Piccadilly Circus). Main courses:
£11–£23 ($22–$46); fixed-price lunch and pre-theater dinner 5:30–7 p.m. £15–£18

Dickens Inn by the Tower
$–$$
The City
TRADITIONAL/MODERN BRITISH
This former spice warehouse is now a three-story restaurant with sweep-
ing Thames and Tower Bridge views. The ground-floor Tavern Bar serves
a variety of snacks, sandwiches, and traditional pub food. Pizza on the
Dock, a floor above and a good spot for families, offers four sizes of pizza.
Grill on the Dock, on the top floor, is a relatively formal dining room serv-
ing Modern British cuisine; specials include steaks and a variety of char-
coal-grilled dishes.

Ebury Wine Bar & Restaurant
$$
Westminster and Victoria
MODERN BRITISH/INTERNATIONAL
This popular wine bar offers a surprisingly good and varied menu and excel-
lent wines. The narrow, woodsy, attractive interior is reminiscent of a Paris
bistro. In addition to steaks, the oft-changing menu features traditional
dishes and specials such as pork mignon with roasted sweet potato mash,
and ostrich steak with balsamic cream sauce. It has added a bar menu, so
you can also stop in for a lamb kebab, a club sandwich, or a burger.

Ed’s Easy Diner
$
Soho
NORTH AMERICAN
This replica of an old American diner, where customers perch on stools at
a wraparound counter and listen to oldies blaring from the jukebox, is a
safe bet for the kids. A bit more authentic than the version at the Pepsi
Trocadero in Piccadilly Circus, this Ed’s still attracts a fair share of teens.
If you’ve a yen for cholesterol-laden food, chow down on Ed’s big burgers
with fries or onion rings, or giant kosher weenies slathered with cheddar
cheese. On the lighter side, you can get a veggie burger, tuna salad, or a
chicken Caesar salad.

Covent Garden
VEGETARIAN
Covent Garden offers a plethora of expensive restaurants for meat-eaters,
so this old-fashioned basement hole-in-the-wall with cafeteria-style serv-
ice is a pleasant and welcome alternative. The menu changes constantly,
but the daily soup (such as carrot and fresh coriander) is always a treat,
and the main courses can include a sweet and tangy Jamaican curry, Italian
bean casserole, and cannelloni ripieni (stuffed with eggplant), as well as
daily quiche and salad specials. The desserts — think apple-and-rhubarb
crumble and fruit with yogurt — are simple and satisfying.
See map p. 150. 31 Neal St., WC2. % 020/7836-0239. Reservations not accepted.

Fortnum & Mason
$$
St. James’s
TRADITIONAL BRITISH
Fortnum & Mason, a posh, legendary London store that’s a “purveyor to
the queen” and famous for its food section (see Chapter 12), also has three
restaurants. The mezzanine-level Patio is a good lunch spot, with a menu
that offers an assortment of pricey sandwiches and main courses, includ-
ing hot and cold pies (steak and kidney, curried fish and banana, chicken,
and game) and Welsh rarebit (thick melted cheese poured over toast) pre-
pared with Guinness stout. The lower-level Fountain offers breakfast and
lunch, and the fourth-floor St. James’s serves lunch and afternoon tea. The
more well-heeled dine at St. James’s, where the menu is traditionally
British: For starters, try the kipper (smoked herring) mousse or potato and
Stilton brûlée; main courses include pies and roast rib of Scottish beef.
Although crowded with tourists, these three establishments remain pleas-
ant places where you can get a good meal and a glimpse of the fading
Empire. The Fountain and Patio are good places to dine with a family; ice-
cream sundaes are a specialty.

MODERN BRITISH
This modern pub/restaurant sits right on the Thames, a few minutes’ walk
east from the South Bank Centre or west from the new Tate Modern and
Shakespeare’s Globe. You can sit inside or out by the water. Although some
British pub favorites such as bangers and mash (sausages and mashed
potatoes), game pie, and fish and chips are available, other dishes are

more ambitious. Pasta, fresh fish, and other daily specials are listed on a

HUNGARIAN
The Gay Hussar is considered to be one of the best Hungarian restaurants
outside Hungary. The restaurant serves undeniably authentic Hungarian
comfort food: chilled wild-cherry soup, caraway potatoes, cabbage stuffed
with minced veal and rice, tender chicken served in mild paprika sauce
with cucumber salad and noodles, and, of course, veal goulash with egg
dumplings. The portions are large, but try to save room for the poppyseed
strudel or the walnut pancakes for dessert.

Gourmet Pizza Company

Southwark
PIZZA/PASTA
This large, family-friendly restaurant on the Thames inhabits what looks like
a temporary building, but the location is great and it provides an economi-
cal meal if you’re exploring the South Bank. You can choose from 20 varieties
of pizza — everything from a B.L.T. to one with Cajun chicken and prawns.
About half the choices are vegetarian. The crusts are light and crispy, and
the toppings are fresh and flavorful. Pasta dishes are also available.

fairly outrageous prices for the experience.

always fresh; you can also get dishes like seared beef with a sweet dipping

dients, with such popular dishes as white asparagus with sea kale and truf-
fle butter, roast chicken and stuffing, and roast beef and potatoes. You can
also enjoy lamb sweetbreads with broad beans and peas in gravy, cod on
saffron risotto, and traditional English desserts, such as sticky toffee and
caramelized bread-and-butter pudding. You need to book as far in advance
as possible for this top dining spot.

Joe Allen
$$
Covent Garden
NORTH AMERICAN
Joe Allen is a low-profile place on a back street in Covent Garden. Its
crowded dining room with checkered tablecloths is the sort of place where
actors like to come after a performance to scarf down chili con carne or
gnaw on barbecued ribs. The dependable food includes American classics
with some international twists, and the set menu is a real value: After a
starter (maybe smoked haddock vichyssoise, a cold soup with fish), you
can choose main courses such as pan-fried pork loin, Cajun chicken breast,
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 161

and grilled lamb cutlets. If you’re a tad homesick, try a burger, a brownie,
and a Coke for consolation. Come before the show for the best prices;
come after the show for potential star-gazing.

Ken Lo’s Memories of China

Westminster and Victoria
CHINESE
Founded by the late Ken Lo, author of more than 30 cookbooks and once
the host of a TV cooking show, this restaurant is one of the better (and cer-
tainly one of the more expensive) pan-Chinese restaurants in London. The
interior décor is appealingly minimalist, and the service is impeccable.
Spanning broadly divergent regions of China, the ambitious menu features
Cantonese quick-fried beef in oyster sauce, lobster with Szechuan pepper
sauce, and “bang-bang chicken” (a Szechuan dish), among many others.

get a light lunch. Dining in this vast, minimally decorated room where flow-
ers grace the tables and a magnificent selection of desserts is on call, is
quite pleasant. The meals are simple: a hearty ploughman’s lunch of bread
and cheese or fresh salads. But it’s mostly afternoon tea that brings the
crowds, and your tea can be as simple or extravagant as you wish. A kid’s
menu is available, too.

Here’s a fine little Italian restaurant that most tourists never find. Locals in
Holborn flock to it, especially at lunchtime, because the food is so good

including deliciously sauced spaghetti, linguine, tortellini, ravioli, tagli-
atelle, and risotto. Veal scaloppini, grilled chicken, and steak are available,

dessert, try the bread-and-butter pudding. The cooking is reliable, but

Covent Garden
INDIAN
Mela claims to take its inspiration from a food stall favored by workers in
Delhi, and lunch here is a fantastic deal: curry or dahl of the day, with
bread, pickle, and chutney for under £3 ($6). Pay a little more, and you can
build your own version of the meal with different breads and toppings.
This is a great, inexpensive way for curry novices to give it a try — and
see it being made in the open kitchen. But do come back in the evening
for a proper go at the innovative Indian country cuisine. Early birds get
three courses. Fixed-price sharers have ten dishes and accompaniments
between them. The word mela means “fair,” and Mela the restaurant does
its best to create a festive atmosphere.

robustly flavored offerings such as organic lentil casserole with roasted
pumpkin and squash or sundried tomato, bean and tarragon sausages. Try
the sweet potato fries as a side, and don’t forget dessert.

Clerkenwell, on the fringes of the City, has become a very hip neighbor-

tentious area’s best haute spot. The décor is modern and minimalist, and
the North African cuisine is earthy and powerful. The kitchen uses only
the best ingredients, organic whenever possible, in its daily-changing
menu. Highly recommended are the grilled asparagus with pine nut, egg
and dill sauce (a seasonal spring dish); the charcoal-grilled lamb with cau-
liflower, chickpea, and coriander salad; and the wood-roasted pork with
chard. For dessert, try one of the yummy house-specialty desserts: yogurt

Noor Jahan is a small, unpretentious neighborhood favorite in South Ken.
The reliably good food includes moist and flavorful marinated chicken and
lamb dishes cooked tandoori-style in a clay oven. If you want to try one of
their tasty specialties, consider chicken tikka, a staple of northern India,

basmati rice, fried in ghee (thick, clarified butter), and served with a mixed
vegetable curry. If you’re unfamiliar with Indian food, the waiters will

SEAFOOD
When they go to London, many people want to experience real fish and
chips — not the generic frozen stuff that often passes for this traditional
dish. Definitely try this unassuming chippie where the fish is always fresh.
This restaurant, with its sepia prints and red velvet seats, is pleasant, com-
fortable, and popular with adults and kids. You may want to start with
grilled fresh sardines or a fish cake before digging into a main course of
cod or haddock. The fish is most often served battered and deep-fried, but
you can also order it grilled. The chips are almost as good as the fish.

shopping, this funky bistro serves some of the best and least expensive
food in posh South Ken. The high-ceilinged room is decorated in what I
call Modern Rococo, with enormous glass chandeliers, patterned walls and

cials on the chalkboard, especially any pasta dishes. The homemade fish
cakes, roasted field mushroom risotto, and grilled calf’s liver with bacon

dine on tablecloths. The superlative river-and-city views are just as sub-
lime, so book in advance and insist on a window table. Recently the food
has taken on more fusion elements but remains as good as ever. Order
such tasty dishes as duck breast with pistachio and five-spice or turbot

When a pub upgrades its food to restaurant standards, it becomes known

game, go for it because that’s what Rules is famous for. On the menu, you
may find roast loin of Wiltshire rabbit, Irish sirloin steak with béarnaise
sauce, or Gloucestershire pork chops with crackling and chutney. The food
is delicious — traditional yet innovative, until you get to the puddings

thread noodles served in soups with various toppings, and the fat, white
noodles called udon. You can also order various rice dishes, vegetarian
dishes, dumplings, vegetable and chicken skewers, and tempura. Your
order is sent via radio signal to the kitchen and arrives the moment it’s
ready, which means that not everyone in a group is served at the same
time. You may have to stand in line to get in, but it’s worth the wait. Teens
especially love the loud, hip, casual atmosphere. Several branches of

try the pear and almond tart with mascarpone ice cream.

Dining and Snacking on the Go
Londoners have a somewhat traditional outlook on food and meals. You
won’t see many adults in London eating on the street or having a bite
while traveling the Tube. It’s mostly tourists carrying those Starbucks
cups. And you don’t find street vendors peddling hot dogs and other
foods from carts (although you may see a fast-food van or two near
major attractions). Even the most frenetic Londoner likes to eat a
proper, civilized “sit-down” meal. So what’s a too-rushed tourist to do?
To help you enjoy snacks and light meals the London way, I offer some
interesting alternatives to fast-food restaurants.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 171

Sandwich bars
Sandwiches are an English invention (supposedly of the Earl of Sandwich),
and sandwich bars are a faster and cheaper alternative to sit-down restau-
rants and pubs. Most open early for breakfast and close in the afternoon.
You can usually eat at a counter or in booths, or you can take your sand-
wich and go to the nearest park for an alfresco lunch. The bars sell coffee,
tea, and nonalcoholic beverages.
American visitors are sometimes confused by the way the English name
their sandwiches. In general, the Brits use the word mayonnaise the way
that Americans use salad. Tuna mayonnaise or egg mayonnaise simply
means “tuna salad” or “egg salad.” The word salad is used in Britain to
denote that lettuce and tomato have been added to a sandwich, as in
“chicken with salad.”
The following sandwich bars are worth a bite:
 Near Victoria Station, Capri Sandwich Bar (see map p. 149; 16
Lower Belgrave Rd., NW1; % 020/7834-1989; Tube: Victoria)
serves an imaginative variety of sandwiches. The bar is open
Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
 If you’re in the vicinity of Euston Station, try the unpretentious 
but cheerful Giovanni’s Sandwich Bar (see map p. 150; 152 North
Gower St., at Euston Road; % 020/7383-0531; Tube: Euston), open
Monday through Friday 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
The best sandwich shops in Central London are the Pret à Manger chain
stores, which offer fresh, inventive, healthy sandwiches and fast counter
service. A convenient West End branch is located at 77–78 St. Martin’s
Lane, WC2 (see map p. 150; % 020/7379-5335; Tube: Leicester Square).
It’s open Monday through Thursday 7:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday 7:30 a.m.
to 11 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. You’ll
find Pret à Manger all over the city.
Fish and chips
The English call a fish and chips place a chippie. At some chippies, the
food is wonderful; at others, it’s hideous. At the good places (the only
ones that I recommend), the fish (usually cod, haddock, or plaice) is
fresh, the batter crisp, and the fries (chips) hand-cut. You can get tartar
sauce, but the British also like to splash their fish and chips with malt
vinegar. Prices for fish have gone up considerably, so fish and chips are
no longer the bargain they used to be.
The following restaurants all have sit-down and takeaway (takeout) 
service and welcome families with kids. Also see the North Sea Fish
Restaurant in the section “London’s Best Restaurants,” earlier in this
chapter.
Part III: Settling into London 
172

 Costas Fish Restaurant (see map p. 154; 18 Hillgate St., W8; % 020/
7727-4310; Tube: Notting Hill Gate) is open Tuesday through
Saturday noon to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30 p.m.
 Fryer’s Delight (see map p. 150; 19 Theobald’s Rd., WC1; % 020/
7405-4114; Tube: Chancery Lane or Holborn) is across from 
the Holborn Police Station. A plate of cod and chips costs £4.95
($9.90); takeaway is also available. The Formica-clad chippie is
open Monday through Saturday noon to 10 p.m. The fish is fried 
in beef fat here; other options include pastries and pies.
 Geales (see map p. 154; 2 Farmer St., W8; % 020/7727-7969; Tube:
Notting Hill Gate) is open Tuesday through Saturday noon to 3 p.m.
and 6 to 10:30 p.m.
 Golden Hind (see map p. 150; 73 Marylebone Lane, W1; %
020/7486-3644; Tube: Baker Street or Bond Street) is a few blocks
south of Madame Tussaud’s. This bargain chippie has an average
meal cost of £6 ($12); hours are Monday through Friday noon to 3
p.m. and Monday through Saturday 6 to 10 p.m.
 Rock & Sole Plaice (see map p. 150; 47 Endell St., WC2; % 020/
7836-3785; Tube: Covent Garden) offers all-day takeaway service, 
as well as a place to sit down and eat amid the bustle of the Covent
Garden Piazza (you can get a table on the lower level). Because of
its location, this chippie crowds with theatergoers in the evening.
You pay at least £8 ($16) for a meal. It’s open Monday through
Saturday 11:30 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10 p.m.
 Seafresh Fish Restaurant (see map p. 149; 80–81 Wilton Rd., SW1;
% 020/7828-0747; Tube: Victoria) offers a good cod fillet and great
chips for about £8.50 ($17). It’s open Monday through Friday noon
to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10:30 p.m.
 Sea-Shell (see map p. 154; 49–51 Lisson Grove, NW1; % 020/7723-
8703; Tube: Marylebone) is within easy walking distance west of
Madame Tussaud’s and is considered one of the best chippies in
London. Main courses range from £7 ($14) to £16 ($32); average cost
for fish and chips is about £9 ($18). It’s open Monday through Friday
noon to 2:30 p.m. and 5 to 10:30 p.m., Saturday noon to 10:30 p.m.
Costas Fish Restaurant and Geales are both good choices if you’ve been
poking around the antiques and whatnot stands along Portobello Road.
Department store restaurants
If you’re in the midst of a shopping spree and don’t want to be distracted,
you can easily grab a bite at one of the many department store restau-
rants. These eateries are convenient, but they aren’t necessarily cheap;
see the restaurant entry for Fortnum & Mason in the section “London’s
Best Restaurants,” earlier in this chapter. A new trend among high-end
boutiques is to have a fancy little cafe or coffee bar right on the premises.
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 173

Here are some more department-store possibilities:
 Harrods (see map p. 152; 87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1; % 020/7730-
1234; Tube: Knightsbridge), in addition to its ice cream parlor and
awe-inspiring Food Hall, offers its Famous Deli Counter, where you
can perch on stools (no reservations) and pay too much for what’s
called “traditional Jewish food” but often isn’t. It’s open Monday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Harvey Nichols (109–125 Knightsbridge, SW7; % 020/7235-5250;
Tube: Knightsbridge) is another Knightsbridge emporium with a
restaurant, the Fifth Floor at Harvey Nichols (see map p. 152). It’s
open Monday through Friday noon to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m.,
but eating here is pretty expensive. A better bet is the cafe, also on
the fifth floor, where you can get a cup of tea and a salad or light
meal; it’s open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Like Harrods, Harvey Nichols has a fabu-
lous food emporium where you can buy now and eat later.
Treating Yourself to Tea
The stereotype is true: Brits do drink tea, though consumption is drop-
ping because of the new emphasis on coffee. Teatime is traditionally
from about 3:30 to 5 p.m. Your afternoon tea can be a lavish affair served
by a black-coated waiter in a posh hotel lobby, or a quick cup with a
slice of cake or a sandwich at a corner tea shop or patisserie (a bakery
where you can sit down or get pastries to take away). Tea may be served
fast-food-style in paper cups, home-style in mugs, or more elegantly on
bone china.
So what exactly, you ask, is the difference between afternoon tea and
high tea?
 Afternoon tea is tea with cakes, scones, sandwiches, or all of them,
served between 3 and 5 p.m. It’s a pre-dinner ritual.
 High tea, served from about 5 to 6 p.m., is a more of a light supper
followed by dessert and tea.

Never too latte: London’s coffee bars
It had to happen sooner or later, and frankly I’m glad it did because finding a good cup
of coffee in London wasn’t always the easiest thing to do. But now Starbucks has
opened branches all over the city, offering nice places to sit down and have a latte,
cappuccino, or “regular” cup of joe. Starbucks also sells pastries and sandwiches.

Casual tea rooms and patisseries
In the following comfortable neighborhood tearooms and patisseries,
you can get a good cup of tea, along with a scone or other pastry or a
plate of tea sandwiches, for about £4 to £10 ($8–$20):
 Café Parlour at Sketch (see map p. 150; 9 Conduit St., W1; % 0870/
777-4488; www.sketch.uk.com; Tube: Oxford Circus) offers superb
pastries and cakes in a room that makes up the patisserie compo-
nent of the ultrahip Sketch, a gastro-empire founded by Pierre
Gagnaire. You can also get breakfast and lunch. Worth a visit just to
see the loos. Hours are Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.,
Saturday 10 a.m. to 11 p.m.
 Muffinski’s (see map p. 150; 5 King St., WC2; % 020/7379-1525;
Tube: Leicester Square) offers great homemade muffins, including
low-fat, organic, and vegetarian. Hours are Monday through Friday 8
a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Pâtisserie Cappucetto (see map p. 150; 8 Moor St., W1; % 020/
7437-9472; Tube: Leicester Square) serves breakfast, sandwiches,
soups, and superb desserts Monday through Thursday 8 a.m. to
11:30 p.m. and Friday and Saturday 8 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
 Pâtisserie Deux Amis (see map p. 150; 63 Judd St., WC1; % 020/
7383-7029; Tube: Russell Square) is a good choice for a quick bite.
Hours are Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Sunday
9 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
 Pâtisserie Valerie (see map p. 150; 44 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/
7437-3466; www.patisserie-valerie.co.uk; Tube: Leicester
Square or Tottenham Court Road) has been around since 1926 and
serves a mouthwatering array of pastries, but expect to stand in
line night or day. Hours are Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. to 8
p.m., Saturday 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Pâtisserie Valerie also has other branches throughout London. One is
at 105 Marylebone High St., W1 (see map p. 154; % 020/7935-6240;
Tube: Bond Street or Baker Street); another is right on Piccadilly at
162 Piccadilly, W1 (see map p. 150; % 020/7491-1717; Tube: Green
Park). The Marylebone branch is open Monday through Saturday 
7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Piccadilly branch
is open Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., Saturdays from
8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Richoux has three old-fashioned tearooms in choice London 
locations. They serve food all day long, and they’re kind to your
budget. The locations are Richoux-Knightsbridge (see map p. 152;
215 Brompton Rd., SW3; % 020/7823-9971; Tube: Knightsbridge),
Richoux-Mayfair (see map p. 154; 41a South Audley St., W1; % 020/
7629-5228; Tube: Bond St. or Green Park), and Richoux-Piccadilly
(see map p. 150; 172 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7493-2204; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus). All locations keep basically the same hours:
Chapter 10: Dining and Snacking in London 175

Monday through Saturday 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. (the Mayfair branch is
open until 9 p.m.), Sunday 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. (the Mayfair branch 
is open until 9 p.m.). The Web site for all locations is www.richoux.
co.uk.
Elegant spots for high tea
A traditional afternoon English tea has cakes, sandwiches, and scones
with clotted cream and jam, and is taken in a posh hotel or restaurant.
These rather lavish affairs are ridiculously expensive but memorable. At
any one of the following places, you can get a proper traditional afternoon
or high tea, sometimes with strawberries and champagne. Also check 
out the less expensive and atmospheric Café in the Crypt beneath St.
Martin-in-the-Fields church, the Kensington Palace Orangery, and the R.S.
Hispaniola docked on the Thames (all are reviewed earlier in this chap-
ter). Note: When you take tea at any of the following tony spots, a smart-
casual dress code is in effect — tennis shoes and jeans are inappropriate.
 Brown’s Hotel (see map p. 151; Albemarle Street, W1; % 020/
7493-6020; www.brownshotel.com; Tube: Green Park): This 
hotel’s English Tea Room serves a superlative and very pricey tea
from 3 to 6 p.m. (Sat–Sun from 2 p.m.) for £33 to £45 ($66–$90).
Reservations are highly recommended.
 Claridge’s (see map p. 150; Brook St., W1; % 020/7629-8860; www.
claridges.co.uk; Tube: Bond Street): Claridge’s serves a glam-
orous and expensive tea daily from 3 to 5:30 p.m. for £31 to £38
($62–$76). Reservations are a good idea.
 Fortnum & Mason (see map p. 150; 181 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/
7734-8040; Tube: Piccadilly Circus): Fortnum & Mason serves after-
noon and high tea in the St. James’s Restaurant Monday through
Saturday from 3 to 5:30 p.m. for £24 to £34 ($48–$68). Reservations
aren’t necessary.
 Georgian Restaurant (see map p. 152; 87–135 Brompton Rd., SW1;
% 02/07225-6800; Tube: Knightsbridge): On the fourth floor of
Harrods, the Georgian Restaurant serves afternoon and high tea
Monday through Saturday from 3:45 to 5:30 p.m. Afternoon tea
costs £20 ($40) per person, and you don’t need reservations.
 The Lanesborough Hotel (see map p. 152; Hyde Park Corner, SW1;
% 020/7259-5599; Tube: Hyde Park Corner) requires reservations
for high tea daily 3:30 to 6 p.m. and costs £31 to £39 ($62–$78).
Planning a Picnic
London may not be the perfect city for picnics. Rain can quickly put a
damper on a picnic hamper, and nothing is quite as unappetizing as a
wet sandwich. But on days when the weather cooperates, nothing is
more enjoyable than packing up some sandwiches and heading to a 
special spot to eat outdoors.
Part III: Settling into London 
176

Glean your picnic pickings from supermarkets, delis, and sandwich
shops (see “Sandwich bars,” earlier in this chapter), or drop in at the
legendary and far more expensive food halls at Fortnum & Mason or
Harrods. Marks & Spencer also has a food hall. In neighborhoods out-
side the West End (South Kensington or Marylebone, for example), you
can go into any supermarket and find packaged sandwiches, crisps
(potato chips), fresh fruit, and drinks.
In the West End, the Embankment Gardens is a pretty picnic spot, 
looking out on the Thames. This flower-filled strip of green is next to 
the Embankment Tube station, below the Savoy hotel. You have to 
sit on benches instead of the grass, and the traffic noise along the
Embankment can be annoying, but it’s still a nice place to know about.
Sandwich shops and takeaway food shops are clustered around the
Embankment Tube station.
Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 11) offers vast green lawns, frolic-
some fountains, Kensington Palace, and the famous statue of Peter Pan.
This spot is a favorite with children of all ages. The park is close to all
the great museums in South Ken. Adjacent Hyde Park is another lovely
picnic site, particularly along the shores of Serpentine Lake. You can buy
sandwiches and snacks at the Dell Restaurant (see Chapter 11) at the
east end of the lake. In summer, bandstand concerts are given in the
park.
The royal parks — Green Park and St. James’s Park — are more sedate.
You can choose to picnic on a lovely knoll and gaze upon Buckingham
Palace.
Looking for an urban space that’s good for people-watching and has
great views across the river? Picnic on the South Bank of the Thames,
along the riverside promenade close to Royal Festival Hall and the
National Theatre.

Part IV
Exploring London

In this part . . .
R
eady to hit the streets? Raring to go? Turn to Chapter 11
for descriptions of London’s top sights — along with
directions, opening hours, and admission prices; you can 
also ﬁnd my rundown of additional sights to see, all of them
intriguing and worth exploring. In Chapter 11, I also tell you
about the best options for guided tours of London by bus, by
boat, and on foot.
Check out Chapter 12 for some great tips on how to make 
the most of your shopping in London, as well as speciﬁc
stores to visit. Chapter 13 gives you four suggested London
itineraries — sightseeing strategies to help you enjoy the city
on a realistic schedule. Finally, in Chapter 14, I send you on
your way to six fascinating places that you can explore on
day trips. I think you’ll love each and every one of them.

Chapter 11
Discovering London’s 
Top Attractions
In This Chapter
 Reviewing London’s top attractions
 Finding sights and activities for history buffs, art lovers, bookworms, kids,
gardeners, and others
 Visiting royal palaces and castles
 Focusing on Greenwich, home of the prime meridian
 Listing London’s sights by neighborhood and type
H
ere’s the big question: What do you want to see and enjoy while
you’re in London? The possibilities are endless: fabulous muse-
ums, royal palaces, important historic sites, beautiful parks and gardens,
and grand churches. In this chapter, I give you the information that you
need to make your itinerary fit your interests, time, and energy level.
To help you find your way around London, you may want to go beyond
my directions in this chapter and get yourself a London A–Z map. Even
Londoners use this comprehensive street gazette, which comes in many
different formats and can be found at just about every bookstore and
news kiosk in London.
I arrange the top sights in this chapter alphabetically. For locations, see
the “London’s Top Sights” map on p. 186. Following the must-see list are
more top attractions grouped together by type. For the locations of
these sights, turn to the “More London Sights” map on p. 210. To help
you pull together your itinerary, see the end of this chapter, where I
index all the top attractions by neighborhood and type. (For useful infor-
mation about planning workable itineraries based on the length of your
trip, turn to Chapter 13.)
London’s top museums are spectacular treasure-troves — and they’re all
absolutely free. To save money on transportation costs, buy one of the
single-day or multiday Travelcards I describe in Chapter 8.

The Top Attractions from A to Z
British Airways London Eye
South Bank
As a piece of fast-track engineering, the 400-foot-high London Eye obser-
vation wheel is impressive. Each glass-sided elliptical module holds about
25 passengers, with enough space so you can move about freely. Although
most people stand the entire time, you can sit on the available bench if
you prefer. Lasting about 30 minutes (equivalent to one rotation), the ride
(or flight, as they call it) is remarkably smooth — even on windy days
riders don’t feel any nerve-twittering shakes. As long as the weather is
good, the wheel provides unrivaled views of London.
For the London Eye, you may want to reserve your place (with a specific
entry time) before you arrive; if you’re ticketless, you can line up for a
ticket at the office right behind the wheel, but you may have to wait an
hour or more before you can get on the wheel.
See map p. 186. Bridge Road, SE1 (beside Westminster Bridge). % 0870/500-0600.
www.londoneye.com. Tube: Westminster (then a 5-minute walk south across
Westminster Bridge) or Waterloo (then a 3-minute walk west along the riverside
promenade). Admission: £15 ($30) adults, £11 ($22) seniors, £7.50 ($15) children under
16; advance credit card booking fee 50p ($1). Open: June–Sept daily from 9 a.m.;
Oct–May daily from 10 a.m.; last admission varies seasonally.
British Museum
Bloomsbury
The British Museum ranks as the most visited attraction in London, with
a splendid, wide-ranging collection of treasures from around the world.
Wandering through the museum’s 94 galleries (see the “British Museum”
map on p. 189), you can’t help but be struck by humanity’s enduring cre-
ative spirit. Permanent displays of antiquities from Egypt, Western Asia,
Greece, and Rome are on view, as well as prehistoric and Romano-British,
Medieval, Renaissance, Modern, and Oriental collections.
In November 2000, the museum’s Great Court reopened with a glass-and-
steel roof designed by Lord Norman Foster. Inaccessible to the general
public for 150 years, the Great Court is now the museum’s new central axis.
In the center, you find a circular building completed in 1857 that once
served as the museum’s famous Reading Room. Completely restored, it
now houses computer terminals where visitors can access images and
information about the museum’s vast collections.
The most famous of the museum’s countless treasures are the superb
Parthenon Sculptures brought to England in 1801 by the seventh Lord
Elgin. These marble sculptures once adorned the Parthenon in Athens,
and Greece wants them returned.

Information

To enhance your enjoyment and understanding of the Parthenon Sculp-
tures, pick up one of the sound guides available right outside Room 18 on
the first floor, where the sculptures are exhibited; the guide costs £3.50
($7).
Other famous treasures in the museum include the Rosetta Stone, which
enabled archaeologists to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphics; the Sutton
Hoo Treasure, an Anglo-Saxon burial ship, believed to be the tomb of a
7th-century East Anglian king; and Lindow Man, a well-preserved ancient
corpse found in a bog. The museum’s ethnography collections are filled
with marvelous curiosities: everything from a pair of polar-bear slacks
worn by Eskimos to a Hawaiian god with a mohawk haircut, found by
Captain Cook and shipped back to London.
Give yourself at least three unhurried hours in the museum. You can avoid
big crowds by going on a weekday morning. If you have only limited time
for the British Museum, consider taking one of the 90-minute highlight
tours offered daily at 10:30 a.m., 1 p.m., and 3 p.m.; these tours cost £8
($16). You can rent audio tours, which also cover museum highlights, for
£3.50 ($7). You can get tickets and information for guided tours and audio
tours at the information desk in the Great Court.
See map p. 186. Great Russell Street, WC1, between Bloomsbury Street and
Montgomery Street. % 020/7323-8000. www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk. Tube:
Russell Square (then a 5-minute walk south on Montgomery Street, along the west
side of Russell Square, to the museum entrance on Great Russell Street). Admission:
Free. Open: Sat–Wed 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Thurs–Fri 10 a.m.–8:30 p.m.; closed Jan 1,
Good Friday (Fri before Easter), and Dec 24–26. Most of the museum has wheelchair
access via elevators; call for entrance information.
Buckingham Palace
St. James’s
Since 1837, when Victoria ascended the throne, all the majesty, scandal,
intrigue, triumph, tragedy, power, wealth, and tradition associated with
the British monarchy has been hidden behind the monumental facade of
Buckingham Palace, the reigning monarch’s London residence.
An impressive early-18th-century pile, the palace was rebuilt in 1825 and
further modified in 1913. From August through September, when the royal
family isn’t in residence, you can buy a ticket to get a glimpse of the
impressive staterooms used by Elizabeth II and the other royals. You don’t
get a guided palace tour; instead, you can wander at your own pace
through 19 rooms (including the Throne Room and the vast ballroom built
by Queen Victoria), most of them baroque, filled with some fine artwork.
In these rooms, the queen receives guests on official occasions. You leave
through the gardens where the queen holds her famous garden parties
each summer. Budget about two hours for your visit.
Throughout the year, you can visit the Royal Mews, one of the finest work-
ing stables in existence, where the magnificent Gold State Coach, used in
every coronation since 1831, and other royal conveyances are housed (and
Part IV: Exploring London 
190

horses stabled). The Queen’s Gallery, which features changing exhibits
of works from the Royal Collection, went through a refurbishment and
reopened for the queen’s Golden Jubilee in June 2002. The palace lies
between Green Park and St. James’s Park, described later in this chapter.
You can buy admission tickets for Buckingham Palace by calling % 020/
7766-7303. Green Park also houses a ticket office, open daily July 29 to
October 1; the office opens at 9 a.m. and closes at 4 p.m. or when the last
ticket has been sold. Keep in mind that every visitor gets a specific time
for entry into the palace, which is why phoning ahead for tickets is smart.
All phone-charged tickets cost an additional £1 ($2); at the ticket booth,
special rates are available for seniors, kids under 17, and families.
See map p. 186. Buckingham Palace Road, SW1. Palace Visitor Office, Royal Mews,
and Queen’s Gallery % 020/7839-1377 (9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.) or 020/7799-2331 (24-hour
recorded info). www.royal.gov.uk. Tube: St. James’s Park (then a 10-minute walk
north on Queen Anne’s Gate and west on Birdcage Walk to Buckingham Gate) or
Green Park (walk directly south through the park). Admission (includes audio guide):
Palace £15 ($30) adults, £14 ($28) seniors, £8.50 ($17) children under 17, £39 ($78) fam-
ilies (2 adults and 3 children under 17); Royal Mews £7 ($14) adults, £6 ($12) seniors,
£4.50 ($9) children, £19 ($38) families; Queen’s Gallery £8 ($16) adults, £7 ($14) sen-
iors, £4 ($8) children. Discounted tickets good for all attractions available on some
days. Open: Palace late Aug–late Sept daily 9:45 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admittance 5:30
p.m.); Royal Mews Mar–Oct Sat–Thurs 11 a.m.–4 p.m. (last admission 3:15 p.m.),
Aug–Sept daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission 4:15 p.m.); Queen’s Gallery daily 10
a.m.–5:30 p.m. (last admittance 4:30 p.m.). Royal Mews and Queen’s Gallery closed
Dec 25–26. Visitors with disabilities must prebook for palace visits; Royal Mews and
Queen’s Gallery are wheelchair accessible.
Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace
St. James’s
Free of charge, you can stand outside Buckingham Palace and watch the
Foot Guards of the Household Division of the Army, the queen’s personal
guard, carry out the Changing of the Guard. The Old Guard forms in the
palace forecourt before going off duty and handing everything over to the
New Guard, which leaves Wellington Barracks at precisely 11:27 a.m. and
marches to the palace via Birdcage Walk, usually accompanied by a band.
The guard consists of 3 officers and 40 men, but this number decreases
when the queen is away. The entire ceremony takes around 40 minutes. If
you can’t find a spot at the front of the railings of Buckingham Palace, you
can see pretty well from the Victoria Memorial in front of the palace.
The pageantry of the Changing of the Guard is no longer a daily occur-
rence. The event takes place at 11:30 a.m. daily May to July but only on
alternate days at other times of the year. To avoid disappointment, make
sure to call ahead or check the Web site.
Buckingham Palace Road, SW1. % 020/7321-2233. www.royal.gov.uk. Tube: St.
James’s Park (then a 10-minute walk north on Queen Anne’s Gate and west on
Birdcage Walk to Buckingham Gate) or Green Park (then walk directly south through
the park). Admission: Free.
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 191

Covent Garden Market and Piazza
Covent Garden
In 1970, the old, noisy, bustling public market where vendors hawked
everything under the sun moved out of Covent Garden and the area
became the site of London’s earliest and most successful urban recycling
effort. The market buildings now house dozens of enticing shops and
eating and drinking places. The wrought-iron stalls in the former Flower
Market are loaded with vendors. The piazza in front may be the most pop-
ular public gathering place outside of Trafalgar Square; the space is always
“heaving,” as the Brits say. Covent Garden is also the home of the Royal
Opera House (see Chapter 15) and the excellent Transport Museum (see
the “Places that please kids” section, later in this chapter).
See map p. 186. Tube: Covent Garden (when you come out of the Tube stop, you’re in
Covent Garden; the market and piazza are a 1-minute walk south in a pedestrian-only
zone).
Houses of Parliament and Big Ben
Westminster
The Houses of Parliament, situated along the Thames, house the land-
mark clock tower containing Big Ben, the biggest bell in the booming
hourly chime that Londoners have been hearing for nearly 150 years.
Designed by Sir Charles Barry and A. W. N. Pugin, the Parliament’s impres-
sive Victorian buildings were completed in 1857. Covering approximately
8 acres, they occupy the site of an 11th-century palace of Edward the
Confessor.
At one end (Old Palace Yard) you find the Jewel House, built in 1366 and
once the treasury house of Edward III, who reigned from 1327 to 1377. The
best overall view of the Houses of Parliament is from Westminster Bridge,
but if you prefer, you can sit in the Stranger’s Gallery to hear a
Parliamentary debate.
Part IV: Exploring London 
192
More guard changing
If you miss the Changing of the Guard or the event doesn’t take place on the day of
your visit, you can still get an eyeful of London pageantry by attending the Mounted
Guard Changing Ceremony at the Horse Guards Building in Whitehall. These are the
same guards as the ones at Buckingham Palace, only on horseback. The ceremony
takes place daily Monday through Saturday at 11 a.m. and Sunday at 10 a.m. You don’t
need a ticket, but arrive early for a good view. To get there, take the Tube to Charing
Cross and walk south from Trafalgar Square along Whitehall (about a five-minute
walk); the Horse Guards Building will be on your right.

Previously, overseas visitors had to go through an elaborate procedure
weeks in advance of their trip in order to tour the Houses of Parliament.
Now, however, 75-minute guided tours are available in August and Septem-
ber. The tours cost £7 ($14) for adults, and you probably want to book 
your ticket in advance. You can reserve by phone at % 0870/906-3773
or order tickets online at www.firstcalltickets.com. You can also 
buy tickets at the kiosk in Westminster Hall (at the Houses of Parliament).
For the rest of the year, the procedure for getting a tour is much more 
difficult. If you’re interested, you can find details on the Web at www.
parliament.uk.

Hyde Park
Westminster
Once the private hunting domain of Henry VIII, Hyde Park is one of the
largest urban parks in the world. With adjoining Kensington Gardens, it
offers 630 acres of lushly landscaped lawns, magnificent flower beds,
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 193
Big Ben tolls for thee
“Big Ben” isn’t the name of the clock tower or its clock. It’s the name of the largest bell
that you hear booming in that famous hourly chime. Some people believe that the bell
was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, the commissioner of works when the bell was
hung in 1859. Others maintain that Big Ben was named for a champion prizefighter of
the time, Ben Gaunt.
The 5-ton clock mechanism housed in the 316-foot tower kept ticking until 1976, when
it succumbed to “metal fatigue” and had to be repaired. At night, new energy-efficient
lighting now gives the illuminated clock faces a greenish tinge. The light at the very top
is lit when Parliament is in session.
Trivia buffs will be interested to know that the minute hands on each of the tower’s
four clocks are as large as a double-decker bus. For information on touring the tower
holding Big Ben, which you can do only if you write for tickets three months in
advance, go to www.parliament.uk.

avenues of trees, and a 41-acre lake known as the Serpentine, where you
can row and sail model boats. Rotten Row, the park’s famous 300-year-old
riding track, was the country’s first public road to be lit at night. At the
northeastern tip, near Marble Arch, Speakers’ Corner is a famous Sunday-
morning venting spot for anyone who wants to climb up on a soapbox.
Free band concerts are held in the park’s band shell on Sundays and Bank
Holidays May to August, and the Dell Restaurant (% 020/7706-0464), at
the east end of the Serpentine, offers cafeteria-style food and drinks
Monday through Friday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in winter (to 5 p.m. on weekends)
and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in summer (to 7 p.m. on weekends). The park is a
pleasant place for an hour’s stroll, but staying longer is always tempting.

Kensington Gardens
Kensington
Kensington Gardens adjoins Hyde Park west of the lake known as the
Serpentine. Children especially love the famous bronze statue of Peter
Pan, located north of the Serpentine Bridge. Commissioned in 1912 by
Peter Pan’s creator, J. M. Barrie, the statue marks the spot where Peter Pan
in the book Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens entered the gardens to get to
his home on Serpentine Island.
The park is also home to the Albert Memorial, an ornate neo-Gothic
memorial honoring Queen Victoria’s husband, Prince Albert; the lovely
Italian Gardens; and the free Serpentine Gallery (% 020/7298-1515),
which has a reputation for showing cutting-edge art and is open daily
(except Dec 24–27 and Jan 1) 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Princess Diana
Part IV: Exploring London 
194
Fountain for Diana
The Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain is Hyde Park’s newest attraction.
Made of Cornish granite, the fountain aims to reflect Diana’s life through its design.
From its highest point, water flows in two directions, falling in cascades, swirls, and
bubbles before meeting in a calm pool at the bottom. Three bridges where you can
cross the water and go right to the heart of the fountain are meant to reflect Diana’s
openness.
Ironically, the fountain was plagued with problems after it was opened by the queen
in 2004. Visitors slipped on the granite and at one point the fountain malfunctioned and
flooded Hyde Park. It is now functioning properly and open daily from 10 a.m.
Knightsbridge is the nearest Tube stop. Diana fans will also want to visit the new Diana:
A Princess Remembered exhibit at Kensington Palace.

Memorial Playground is in the northwest corner of the park. If the
weather is fine, give yourself enough time for a leisurely stroll — at least
a couple of hours.
See map p. 186. Bounded by Kensington Palace Gardens and Palace Green on 
the west, Bayswater Road on the north, Kensington Road and Kensington Gore on 
the south. % 020/7298-2100. www.royalparks.org.uk. Tube: High Street
Kensington (then a 10-minute walk east on Kensington High Street) or Queensway
(which is directly across from the northwest corner of the park). Open: Daily dawn
to midnight.
Kensington Palace
Kensington Gardens
Kensington Palace was used as a royal residence until 1760. Victoria was
born in this palace, and it was here, in 1837 when she was 18 years old,
that she was awakened from her slumbers and informed that she was the
new queen of England (and could move to the grander Buckingham
Palace). One wing of Kensington Palace (not open to visitors) was Princess
Diana’s London home after her divorce from Prince Charles. The palace
was also home to Princess Margaret, who died in 2002, and remains the
home of other “grace and favor” royals and dependents (the Crown pro-
vides them with free housing). Visitors can visit the State Apartments, sev-
eral interesting exhibits relating to the history of the palace, and see some
of Diana’s dresses in the new Diana: A Princess Remembered exhibit. The
freshly restored King’s Apartment features a magnificent collection of Old
Masters. Give yourself about 11⁄2 hours to view the palace.
For a pleasant and not-too-expensive tea or snack after visiting Kensington
Palace, stop in at The Orangery (% 020/7376-0239) in the gardens adja-
cent to the palace. (For more information, see Chapter 10.)
See map p. 186. The Broad Walk, Kensington Gardens, W8. % 0870/751-5170.
www.hrp.org.uk. Tube: Queensway on the north side (then a 10-minute walk
south through the park) or High Street Kensington on the southwest side (then a 10-
minute walk through the park). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5 p.m.).
Admission: £12 ($24) adults, £10 ($20) seniors and students, £6 ($12) children 5–15,
£33 ($66) families (2 adults and 2 children). Wheelchair accessible, despite some
stairs; call first.
Leicester Square
Leicester Square
Leicester (pronounced les-ter) Square is a crowded place with a big-city
buzz. Mimes, singers, and street entertainers of all kinds vie for attention.
Once a dueling ground, the square is now a pedestrian zone and the heart
of West End entertainment. You can find a half-price ticket booth (no
phone) for theater, opera, and dance at the south end of the square (see
Chapter 15). In the square’s center, surrounded by movie theaters and
restaurants, is Leicester Square Gardens, a small grassy park with four
corner gates named for William Hogarth, Sir Joshua Reynolds, John Hunter,
and Sir Isaac Newton, all of whom once lived or worked in the area. You
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 195

also find statues of William Shakespeare and Charlie Chaplin, a bow to the-
ater and cinema. You probably won’t want to linger long, but just walking
through the square can be fun. If you’re traveling with kids, keep in mind
this area is one place with a restroom (coin-operated).
See map p. 186. Tube: Leicester Square (take the Leicester Square exit and you’re in
the pedestrian-only zone that leads to the square).
London Zoo
Marylebone
The 36-acre London Zoo is Britain’s largest, and has recently created a
series of new habitats and exhibits. The best attractions are B.U.G.S.
(insects of every description), Gorilla Kingdom (with a colony of Western
lowland gorillas), the Clore Rainforest Lookout (South American mon-
keys, birds, and vertebrates), Komodo Dragons, and Into Africa (zebras,
giraffes, okapi, red river hogs). The Children’s Zoo, with interactive
exhibits placed at low height, is designed for 4- to 8-year-olds. Many fami-
lies budget almost an entire day for the zoo; I recommend that you give it
at least three hours.
A fun way to arrive at the London Zoo is by water. The London Waterbus
Co. (% 020/7482-2660; www.londonwaterbus.com) operates single and
return trips in snug, converted canal boats along the Regent’s Canal from
Warwick Crescent in Little Venice to Camden Lock Market. Take the Tube
to Warwick Avenue and walk south across Regent’s Canal, and then you
can see the moorings. Trips from both locks depart daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The round-trip fare costs £8.40 ($11) for adults, £5.40 ($11) for seniors and
children.

Madame Tussaud’s
Marylebone
Madame Tussaud’s wax museum is a world-famous tourist attraction and
a fun spot for older kids. The question is: Do you want to pay the exorbi-
tant admission and devote time to see a collection of lifelike figures? (If
you do go in, you need at least 2 hours to see everything.) The original
moldings of members of the French court, to whom Madame Tussaud had
direct access (literally, because she made molds of their heads after they
were guillotined during the French Revolution), are undeniably fascinat-
ing. And animatronic gadgetry makes the Spirit of London theme ride fun.
But Chamber Live (formerly called the Chamber of Horrors) is definitely
Part IV: Exploring London 
196

for the ghoulish and unsuitable for kids under 12. The Blush exhibit fea-
tures screen faves like Brad Pitt, Samuel L. Jackson, and Daniel Radcliffe of
the Harry Potter series. Next door, the former London Planetarium has
been remade into the Stardome, and now features a special-effects show
about the stars on earth rather than those in the heavens.
Go early to beat the crowds; better still, reserve tickets one day in
advance, and go straight to the head of the line. You can order tickets 
by phone or online.

National Gallery
St. James’s
If you’re passionate about great art, you’ll think that the National Gallery
is paradise. This museum houses one of the world’s most comprehensive
collections of British and European paintings. All the major schools from
the 13th century to the 20th century are represented, but the Italians get
the lion’s share of wall space, with works by artists such as Botticelli,
Leonardo da Vinci, and Raphael. The French Impressionist and post-
Impressionist works by Cézanne, Degas, Manet, Monet, Seurat, and van
Gogh are splendid. And because you’re on English soil, check out at least
a few of Turner’s stunning seascapes, Constable’s landscapes, and
Reynolds’s society portraits. And you won’t want to miss the Rembrandts.
Budget at least two hours to enjoy the gallery. The second floor has a good
restaurant for lunch, tea, or snacks.
To make the most of your time at the gallery, pick up a portable audio-tour
guide. The guides are free but a security deposit is required.

National Portrait Gallery
St. James’s
What do these people all have in common: Sir Walter Raleigh, Shakespeare
(wearing a gold earring), Queen Elizabeth I, the Brontë sisters, Winston
Churchill, Oscar Wilde, Noël Coward, Mick Jagger, and Princess Di? 
You can find portraits of them, as well as nearly every other famous
English face, at the National Portrait Gallery. The portraits are arranged in
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 197

chronological order. The earliest portraits are in the Tudor Gallery; the
latest (such as Dame Helen Mirren) are on the first floor. Plan on spending
at least two hours, but getting sidetracked here is easy, so you may want
more time. On the top floor, the Portrait Restaurant & Bar looks out over
the rooftops of the West End.

Natural History Museum
South Kensington
Filled with magnificent specimens and exciting displays relating to natural
history, this museum houses the national collections of living and fos-
silized plants, animals, and minerals. The most popular attraction in this
enormous Victorian Era museum is the huge Dinosaurs exhibit, with 14
complete skeletons, two creepy animatronic raptors, and a full-size,
robotic T. rex guarding a fresh kill. Kids also love the bug-filled Creepy
Crawlies. The sparkling gems and crystals in the Mineral Gallery literally
dazzle, and in the Meteorite Pavilion, you can see fragments of rock that
crashed into the earth from the farthest reaches of the galaxy. The intrigu-
ing Darwin Centre showcases the private collection of Charles Darwin,
father of evolutionary theory, and houses the museum’s huge collection of
preserved specimens. The museum offers enough to keep you occupied
for at least two hours.

Queen Mum memorials
In 2000, the National Portrait Gallery commissioned a royal family portrait to celebrate
the Queen Mother’s 100th birthday. Artist John Wonnacott painted a canvas that por-
trays Queen Elizabeth, Prince Phillip, Prince Charles, Prince William, and Prince Harry
in conversation with the Queen Mother in the White Drawing Room in Buckingham
Palace. (Interestingly, Prince William — Charles’s firstborn and, thus, the second in
line to the throne — dominates the picture.) The much-loved Queen Mum died in 2002,
and plans are now afoot to erect a bronze statue of her to stand beneath a sculpture
of her husband, King George VI, off the Mall. Artist Philip Jackson’s representation of
the royal matriarch as a younger woman is scheduled to be unveiled in mid-2008.

Piccadilly Circus
Piccadilly Circus
Nearly everyone who visits London wants to see Piccadilly Circus, which
marks the beginning of the West End. Piccadilly Circus, along with neigh-
boring Leicester Square, is London’s equivalent to New York’s Times
Square. Around the landmark statue of Eros, jostling crowds pack the pave-
ments and an international group of teens heads for the Pepsi Trocadero,
the area’s mega-entertainment center (see “Activities for teens,” later in
this chapter). Regent Street at the west side of the circus and Piccadilly at
the south end are major shopping streets (see Chapter 12). Piccadilly, tra-
ditionally the western road out of London, was named for the picadil, a ruf-
fled collar created by a 17th-century tailor named Robert Baker.
See map p. 186. Tube: Piccadilly Circus.
Science Museum
South Kensington
The Science Museum is a popular tourist attraction that showcases the
history and development of science, medicine, and technology. The fasci-
nating displays include the Apollo 10 space module, an 1813 steam loco-
motive, Fox Talbot’s first camera, and Edison’s original phonograph. The
Wellcome Wing is devoted to contemporary science and has an IMAX 3-
D theater. Interactive displays tickle the brains of 7- to 12-year-olds, and
the Garden Galleries provide construction areas, sound-and-light shows,
and games for younger kids. Give yourself at least two hours.
See map p. 186. Exhibition Road, London SW7. % 020/7942-4454. www.science

station goes directly to the museum). Admission: Museum free; IMAX £8 ($16) adults,
£6 ($12) seniors and children 5–15. To book IMAX tickets in advance, call % 0870/
870-4868. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; closed Dec 24–26. All galleries are wheelchair
accessible.
St. James’s Park and Green Park
St. James’s
Henry VIII acquired these two adjoining royal parks in the early 16th cen-
tury and today they flank Buckingham Palace. St James’s Park, the pret-
tier of the two, was landscaped in 1827 by John Nash in a picturesque
English style with an ornamental lake and promenades. Major ceremonial
occasions are held in the Mall, a processional route between the palace
and Whitehall and Horse Guards Parade. St. James’s Palace, the former
London abode of Prince Charles and his two sons, and adjacent Clarence
House, residence of the Queen Mum until her death in 2002 and now the
London home of Prince Charles, are between the Mall and Pall Mall (pro-
nounced pell mell), a broad avenue running from Trafalgar Square to St.
James’s Palace. Clarence House is now open to visitors in August and
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 199

September, daily from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Admission is £7.50 ($15) for
adults and seniors, and £4 ($8) for children 5 to 15.
See map p. 186. Bounded by Piccadilly to the north, Regent Street to the east,
Birdcage Walk and Buckingham Palace Road to the south, and Grosvenor Place to
the west. % 020/7930-1793. www.royalparks.org.uk. Tube: Green Park (the
Tube station is right at the northeast corner of Green Park) or St. James’s Park (then
a 5-minute walk north on Queen Anne’s Gate to Birdcage Walk, the southern perime-
ter of St. James’s Park). Open: Daily dawn to dusk.
St. Paul’s Cathedral
The City
After the Great Fire of 1666 destroyed the city’s old cathedral, the great
architect Christopher Wren was called upon to design St. Paul’s, a huge
and harmonious Renaissance-leaning-toward-baroque building (see the
“St. Paul’s Cathedral” map on p. 202). During World War II, Nazi bombing
raids wiped out the surrounding area but spared the cathedral, so Wren’s
masterpiece, capped by the most-famous dome in London, rises majesti-
cally above a crowded sea of undistinguished office buildings. Grinling
Gibbons carved the exceptionally beautiful choir stalls, the only impres-
sive artwork inside.
Christopher Wren is buried in the crypt, and his epitaph, on the floor
below the dome, reads LECTOR, SI MONUMENTUM REQUIRIS, CIRCUMSPICE
(“Reader, if you seek his monument, look around you”). His companions in
the crypt include two of Britain’s famed national heroes: the duke of
Wellington, who defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, and Admiral Lord Nelson,
who took down the French at Trafalgar during the same war. But many
people want to see St. Paul’s simply because Lady Diana Spencer wed
Prince Charles here in what was billed as “the fairy-tale wedding of the
century.”
You can climb up to the Whispering Gallery for a bit of acoustical fun or
gasp your way up to the very top for a breathtaking view of London. You
can see the entire cathedral in an hour or less.

Green with envy
Green Park is called Green Park because it’s the only royal park without any flower
beds. Why? A popular story has it that one day, as Charles II was walking through the
park with his entourage, he announced that he was going to pick a flower and give it
to the most beautiful lady present. This lady happened to be a milkmaid and not Queen
Catherine, his wife. The queen was livid and ordered that all flowers be removed from
the park (a horticultural version of “Off with their heads!”).

St. Paul’s is now linked to the Tate Modern on the South Bank by the pedes-
trian-only Millennium Bridge, designed by Lord Norman Foster.
See map p. 186. St. Paul’s Churchyard, Ludgate Hill, EC4. % 020/7246-8348. www.

ices only). The cathedral is wheelchair accessible by the service entrance near the
North Transept; ring the bell for assistance.
Tate Britain
Pimlico
The Tate Gallery took this new name to distinguish it from its new coun-
terpart, Tate Modern, which opened in May 2000 and is devoted to
International Modernism. Tate Britain retains the older (pre-20th-century)
collections of exclusively British art plus works by major British stars like
David Hockney and experimental works by Brits and foreigners living in
Britain. Among the masterpieces on display in a host of newly refurbished
galleries are dreamy works by the British pre-Raphaelites, the celestial
visions of William Blake, bawdy satirical works by William Hogarth, genteel
portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, pastoral landscapes by John Constable,
and the shimmering seascapes of J. M. W. Turner. The collection is hung
thematically rather than chronologically. Plan on spending at least two
hours here. The gallery has a well-regarded restaurant and a cafe on the
lower level.
See map p. 186. Millbank, Pimlico SW1. % 020/7887-8888. www.tate.org.uk.
Tube: Pimlico (then a 10-minute walk south on Vauxhall Bridge Road to the river and
north on Millbank to the museum entrance). Bus: For a more scenic route, take bus
77A, which runs south along The Strand and Whitehall to the museum entrance on
Millbank. Admission: Free; varying admission fees for special exhibits. Tours: Audio
tours £3 ($6). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m. Most of the galleries are wheelchair
accessible, but call first for details on entry.

Inter-Tate travel
From Millbank Pier, on the river just outside Tate Britain, a ferry service links the Tate
Britain and the Tate Modern. Vessels operated by Thames Clippers make the run
between Millbank Pier and Bankside Pier, with one additional stop at Waterloo Pier,
in case you want to take a spin on the British Airways London Eye. A one-way fare
costs £4.30 ($8.60) for adults, free for children under 16 with an adult; if you have a
Travelcard, you get one-third off the price. For more information, contact Transport for
London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk).

Tate Modern
South Bank
The former Bankside Power Station is the setting for the fabulous Tate
Modern, which opened in May 2000. Considered one of the top modern art
museums in the world, it houses the Tate’s collection of international 20th-
century art, displaying major works by some of the most influential artists
of this century: Frances Bacon, Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, Henri
Matisse, Henry Moore, and Pablo Picasso among them. A gallery for the
21st-century collection exhibits contemporary art. Fans of contemporary
art and architecture shouldn’t miss this new star on the London art scene.
Plan on spending at least two hours. The museum is now linked to St.
Paul’s Cathedral by the pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge, designed by
Lord Norman Foster.

Tower of London
The City
The Tower of London offers enough to keep you captivated for a good
three to four hours, but make sure that you save time for the Crown
Jewels, which include the largest diamond in the world (the 530-carat Star
of Africa) and other breathtaking gems set into royal robes, swords,
scepters, and crowns.
The Tower of London (see the “Tower of London” map on p. 204) is the
city’s best-known and oldest historic site. In 1066, William the Conqueror
built the tower, which served as his fortress and later as a prison, holding
famous captives, such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Princess Elizabeth I. Anne
Boleyn and Catherine Howard (two of the eight wives of Henry VIII), the
nine-day queen Lady Jane Grey, and Sir Thomas More were among those
unlucky souls who got their heads chopped off on Tower Green.
According to Shakespeare, the two little princes (the sons of Edward IV)
were murdered in the Bloody Tower by henchmen of Richard III — but the
story is controversial among modern historians.
You can attend the nightly Ceremony of the Keys, the ceremonial locking-
up of the Tower by the Yeoman Warders. For free tickets, write to the
Ceremony of the Keys, Queen’s House, HM Tower of London, London EC3N
4AB, and request a specific date, but also list three alternate dates. At least
six weeks’ notice is required. You must enclose an International Reply
Coupon and a self-addressed stamped envelope (British stamps only), or
two International Reply Coupons with all requests and list the names and
addresses of all visitors. If you have a ticket, a Yeoman Warder will admit
you at 9:35 p.m.
In the bad old days, important prisoners often arrived at the tower 
by boat. You can, too. Catamaran Cruisers (% 020/7925-2215; www.
catamarancruisers.co.uk) provides daily ferry service between
Embankment Pier (Tube: Embankment) and Tower Pier. A one-way ticket
for the 30-minute trip is £5.50 ($11) adults and £2.75 ($5.50) children under
16. City Cruises (% 020/7740-0400; www.citycruises.com) makes the
journey to the Tower of London from Westminster Pier approx-
imately every 40 minutes from 10:10 a.m. to 5:50 p.m. for £5.60 ($11).
See map p. 186. Tower Hill, EC3. % 020/7709-0765. www.hrp.org.uk. Tube: Tower
Hill (then a 5-minute walk west and south on Tower Hill). Bus: You can take the east-
bound bus 25 from Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, or St. Paul’s; it stops at Tower Hill,
north of the entrance. Admission: £16 ($32) adults, £12 ($24) seniors and students, £10
($20) children 5–15, £45 ($90) families (2 adults and 3 children). Tours: The Yeoman
Warders (also known as Beefeaters) give free 1-hour guided tours of the entire com-
pound every half-hour, starting at 9:30 a.m. (Sun 10 a.m.) from the Middle Tower near
the main entrance. The last guided walk starts about 3:30 p.m. in summer or 2:30 p.m.
in winter; weather permitting. Open: Mar–Oct Tues–Sat 9 a.m.–6 p.m., Sun–Mon

St. Martin-in-the-Fields church and the National Gallery. Then, after a major
urban redesign, it reopened in 2003 with one side attached to the steps of
the National Gallery, so visitors can easily get to the square without cross-
ing any streets at all. Besides being a major tourist attraction, Trafalgar
Square is the site of many large gatherings, such as political demonstra-
tions and holiday celebrations. The square honors military hero Horatio
Viscount Nelson (1758–1805), who lost his life at the 1805 Battle of
Trafalgar against the French. Nelson’s Column, with fountains and four
bronze lions at its base, rises 145 feet above the square. At the top, a 14-
foot-high statue of Nelson (5'4" tall in real life) looks commandingly toward
Admiralty Arch, passed through by state and royal processions between
Buckingham Palace and St. Paul’s Cathedral. You don’t need more than a
few minutes to take in the square.
The neoclassical church on the northeast corner of Trafalgar Square was
the precursor for dozens of similar-looking churches throughout colonial
New England. Designed by James Gibbs, a disciple of Christopher Wren,
St. Martin-in-the-Fields (see map on p. ###; % 020/7930-0089) was com-
pleted in 1726; the 185-foot spire was added about 100 years later. The
Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields, a famous music ensemble, frequently
performs here. Lunchtime concerts are held on Monday, Tuesday, and
Friday at 1 p.m., and evening concerts are held Thursday through Saturday
at 7:30 p.m. Concert tickets cost £6 to £15 ($12–$30). For reservations 
by credit card, call % 020/7839-8362. The church is open Monday 
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.; admission
is free.
Café-in-the-Crypt (% 020/7839-4342), one of the West End’s most pleas-
ant restaurants, is in the crypt of St. Martin-in-the-Fields (see Chapter 10
for the restaurant review). The busy crypt also contains the London Brass
Rubbing Centre (% 020/7437-6023), which provides paper, metallic
waxes, and instructions on how to rub your own replica of historic
brasses. Prices range from £3 to £15 ($6–$30). This activity is a great diver-
sion for kids 10 and up. The center is open Monday through Saturday 10
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday noon to 6 p.m.
See map p. 186. Bounded on the north by Trafalgar, on the west by Cockspur Street,
and on the east by Whitehall. Tube: Charing Cross (the Underground station has an
exit to the square).

Birds and Beefeaters
Huge black ravens hop around the grounds of the Tower of London. An old legend says
that the British Commonwealth will end when the ravens leave the tower. Their wings
have been clipped as a precaution, and in 2006, during the avian flu scare, the Tower
ravens were put in quarantine. The ancient, all-male order of Yeomen Warders, more
familiarly known as the Beefeaters, installed its first woman member in 2006.

Victoria & Albert Museum
South Kensington
The Victoria & Albert (known as the V&A) is the national museum of art
and design. In the 145 galleries, filled with fine and decorative arts from
around the world, you find superbly decorated period rooms, a fashion
collection spanning 400 years of European designs, Raphael’s designs for
tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, the Silver Galleries, and the largest assem-
blages of Renaissance sculpture outside Italy and of Indian art outside
India. The Canon Photography Gallery shows works by celebrated pho-
tographers. In November 2001, the museum opened its spectacular new
British Galleries. Allow at least two hours just to cover the basics.

South Kensington (the museum is across from the Underground station). Admission:
Free. Open: Thurs–Tues 10 a.m.–5:45 p.m., Wed 10 a.m.–10 p.m.; closed Dec 24–26. The
museum is wheelchair accessible (only about 5 percent of the exhibits include steps).
Westminster Abbey
Westminster
The Gothic and grand Westminster Abbey (see the “Westminster Abbey”
map on p. 207) is one of London’s most important historic sites. The pres-
ent abbey dates mostly from the 13th and 14th centuries, but a church has
been on this site for more than a thousand years. Since 1066, when William
the Conqueror became the first English monarch to be crowned here,
every successive British sovereign except for two (Edward V and Edward
VIII) has sat on the Coronation Chair to receive the crown and scepter. In
the Royal Chapels, you can see the chapel of Henry VII, with its delicate
fan vaulting, and the tomb of Queen Elizabeth I, who was buried in the
same vault as her Catholic half-sister, Mary I, and not far from her rival,
Mary Queen of Scots. In Poets’ Corner, some of England’s greatest writers
(including Geoffrey Chaucer, Charles Dickens, and Thomas Hardy) are
interred or memorialized. Other points of interest include the College
Garden, cloisters, chapter house, and the Undercroft Museum, which con-
tains the Pyx Chamber with its display of church plate (the silver owned
by the church). In September 1997, the abbey served as the site of Princess
Diana’s funeral, and in 2002, the funeral service for the Queen Mother was
held here. The abbey is within walking distance of the Houses of
Parliament.

Finding More Cool Things to See and Do
If you think you’ve “done” London because you’ve marveled at
Westminster Abbey, seen where the queen lives, toured the Tower of
London, and feasted your eyes on the masterpieces in the British Museum,
think again. London is teeming with more sightseeing possibilities: glori-
ous gardens, magnificent mansions, singular museums, ancient corners,
historic churches, and many themed attractions that fill you in on the
history and flavor of majestic London Town. In the following sections,

I highlight a few more of the many activities that may tickle your fancy
and organize them by categories of interest. (For locations, see the
“More London Sights” map on p. 210.)
In the following sections, I also cover four major attractions just outside
Central London and easily accessible by Tube or train — Hampstead
Heath, Hampton Court Palace, the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, and
Windsor Castle. You can spend the better part of a day visiting any one
of these sights — all are well worth your time — before returning to
Central London in time for a play or concert in the evening.
The following sights are fully or partially wheelchair accessible; visitors
with disabilities should call the attraction to find out about special
entrances, ramps, and elevator locations:
 Bank of England Museum
 British Library Exhibition Galleries
 Chelsea Physic Garden
 Courtauld Gallery
 Design Museum
 Hampton Court
 Imperial War Museum
 London Aquarium
 London Dungeon
 London Transport Museum
 Museum of Childhood
 Museum of London
 Regent’s Park
 Royal Academy of Arts

A window on Oscar Wilde’s window
In 1995, 100 years after Oscar Wilde was tried for “gross indecency” and sentenced
to two years’ hard labor in Reading Gaol, the Church of England finally recognized his
immortal genius with a memorial window at Westminster Abbey. But because his
name is nowhere to be seen in the abbey, the blue window with its abstract design 
is the kind of dubious honor that would no doubt provoke a witty quip from the great
playwright. Maybe something like, “Clear glass wasn’t good enough for me; it had to
be stained.”

 Royal Botanic Gardens (Kew Gardens)
 Tower Bridge Experience
 Wallace Collection
Sights for history buffs
You can’t escape history in London. The past is woven into the very
fabric of the city, and it’s why many visitors want to come here. The 
“history” contained in the sights in this section is as old as Rome, as
new as the current prime minister, and as dramatic as the events of
World War II.
Churchill Museum and Cabinet War Rooms
Westminster
You can almost hear the air-raid sirens. In this 21-room underground
bunker, Prime Minister Winston Churchill and his War Cabinet planned out
the military campaigns of World War II. The site has been meticulously pre-
served, right down to the nightshirt and cigar waiting by Churchill’s bed.
The Churchill Museum, dedicated to the life of Sir Winston Churchill, is a
permanent exhibition within the Cabinet War Rooms. Give yourself at least
an hour to explore the site.
See map p. 210. Clive Steps, King Charles Street, SW1. % 020/7930-6961. http://
cwr.iwm.org.uk. Tube: Westminster (then a 10-minute walk west, staying on the
north side of the street, to Parliament Street; turn right to reach King Charles Street).
Admission: £11 ($22) adults, £9 ($18) seniors and students, free for children under 16;
a free self-guided audio tour comes with your ticket. Open: Daily 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
(last admission 5 p.m.). Closed Dec 24–26.
Imperial War Museum
Lambeth
The former insane asylum known as Bedlam is now devoted to the insan-
ity of war. You can see a wide range of weapons and historic equipment,
including a Battle of Britain Spitfire, a German one-man submarine, a Mark
V tank, and a rifle once carried by Lawrence of Arabia. Other exhibits
include coded messages, forged documents, espionage equipment from
World War I to the present, and multimedia presentations about the Blitz
and trench warfare. The Holocaust Gallery documents one of history’s
darkest episodes through film, photos, and artifacts, many shown for the
first time. Enough history is on display to keep you occupied for a couple
of hours.
See map p. 210. Lambeth Road, SE1. % 020/7416-5320. www.iwm.org.uk. Tube:
Lambeth North (then a 10-minute walk south on Kennington, south of Westminster
Bridge Road, and east on Lambeth Road). Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Closed Dec 24–26.

Museum of London
The City
The Museum of London is the most comprehensive city museum any-
where in the world. Located in the original square-mile Londinium of the
Romans and overlooking the city’s Roman and medieval walls, the
museum includes archaeological finds; paintings and prints; social, indus-
trial, and historical artifacts; and costumes, maps, and models to recount
the city’s history from prehistoric times to today. Of special interest is the
gilt-and-scarlet Lord Mayor’s Coach, built in 1757 and weighing 3 tons. A
major new expansion of the ground floor galleries (which span the cen-
turies from the Great Fire of 1666 to modern multicultural London) got
under way in 2007. Give yourself at least an hour to skim through the
engaging collections.
See map p. 210. 150 London Wall (in the Barbican district near St. Paul’s Cathedral),
EC2. % 0870/444-3853. www.museumoflondon.org.uk. Tube: St. Paul’s (then a
10-minute walk north on St. Martin Le Grand and Aldersgate). Admission: Free. Open:
Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5:50 p.m., Sun noon to 5:50 p.m. Closed Dec 24–26 and Jan 1.
10 Downing Street
St. James’s
The prime minister’s residence is a place on many visitors’ “must-see”
lists, so I’m sorry to tell you that there’s nothing to see except a heavily
guarded gate. By peering through the gate, you can get a glimpse, on the
right side, of No. 10, the official residence of the British PM since 1732. In
2007, the sizeable Blair family (Tony, Cherie, and four kids) moved out and
the new prime minister, Gordon Brown, moved in. The chancellor of the
exchequer resides at No. 11, and No. 12 serves as the office of the chief
government whip, responsible for maintaining discipline and cooperation
in the vociferous House of Commons. These three small brick terrace
houses, built on a cul-de-sac in 1680, stand in sharp contrast to the enor-
mous 19th-century offices lining Whitehall, the government quarter
around Downing Street.
See map p. 210. 10 Downing St., SW1. Tube: Westminster (then a 5-minute walk north
on Parliament Street and Whitehall).
Attractions for art lovers
In addition to visiting the great art museums described in “London’s Top
Sights,” earlier in this chapter, you may want to check out some of the
city’s smaller galleries.
Royal Academy of Arts
St. James’s
Housed in 18th-century Burlington House, the site of Britain’s first art
school, the Royal Academy presents major exhibits throughout the year
and mounts a renowned (and usually jam-packed) Summer Exhibition 
Part IV: Exploring London 
212

of juried works from around the United Kingdom. Give yourself about 
an hour.
See map p. 210. Burlington House, Piccadilly, W1. % 020/7300-8000. www.royal
academy.org.uk. Tube: Piccadilly Circus (then a 5-minute walk down Piccadilly;
the Academy is on the north side of the street just before the Burlington Arcade).
Admission: Varies according to exhibit but usually £10 ($20) adults, £8 ($16) seniors, £3
($6) children. Open: Sat–Thurs 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 5:30 p.m.), Fri 10 a.m.–10 p.m.
Saatchi Gallery
Chelsea
Ex-adman Charles Saatchi has amassed one of the world’s largest inde-
pendent collections of contemporary British and international art. His
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 213
From Blair to Brown: A new prime 
minister takes the reins
Of course, London gossip swirls around 10 Downing Street, just as it does around
Buckingham Palace. After Tony Blair’s position on the Iraq War cost his New Labour
Party one-third of their seats in 2005, he announced that he would not run for a fourth
term, and in 2007 he stepped down and handed over the reins of power to Gordon
Brown, a Scotsman who had served as Blair’s chancellor of the exchequer.
Unlike the voluble Blair, Brown is something of an enigma to the British public. Born
in 1951 in Glasgow, he earned a PhD in history at the University of Edinburgh (and is
only one of four prime ministers not to attend Oxford University or Cambridge
University). During a school rugby match he was kicked in the head and suffered a
detached retina that left him blind in his left eye. Later, the same symptoms threatened
the vision in his right eye, but several surgeries saved his sight. After working as a lec-
turer in politics and a journalist, Brown was elected to Parliament in 1983. After the
sudden death of Labour leader John Smith in 1994, Brown was regarded as a poten-
tial party leader, but he did not contest the leadership when Tony Blair became the
favorite.
It has long been rumored that a deal was struck between Blair and Brown in which
Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not stand-
ing against him in the leadership election. In public, the two remained mostly united
but there have been many reports of serious rifts between them.
The new resident of 10 Downing Street has been careful not to suggest that there will
be any changes in the key areas of Blair’s social policy or any radical changes in New
Labour itself. Since taking office, he has promoted the idea of creating several “eco-
towns” with affordable, environmentally friendly housing, and proposed tighter coastal
security controls after the thwarted terrorist attacks of 2007. The new prime minister
is married to Sarah Macauley, a public relations executive, and has two sons, one of
whom was diagnosed in 2006 with cystic fibrosis.

gallery shows pieces from the permanent collection, as well as changing
international exhibits. Regardless of what you think of the sometimes 
controversial works on display — many of them vapid, self-serving, and
silly — the gallery remains a showcase for the art trends of the second. At
press time, the gallery was moving to a new location in Chelsea and was
due to reopen in 2008. Phone number and hours of operation may change.
See map p. 210. Duke of York’s HQ, Sloane Sq. % 020/7825-2363. www.saatchi-
gallery.co.uk. Tube: Sloane Square (then a 3-minute walk down King’s Road 
to Duke of York’s HQ). Admission: Free. Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m.–8 p.m., Fri–Sat 
10 a.m.–10 p.m.
Somerset House
The Strand
The late Queen Mother once remarked how sad it was that the courtyard
at Somerset House had become an Inland Revenue car park. It was just the
spur that the long-running campaign needed to open up the 1,000-room
civil service palace, designed by Sir William Chambers (1724–1796), to the
public. The government moved its workers out and the Heritage Lottery
Fund coughed up the millions needed to restore the buildings, the court-
yard with its dancing fountains, and the river terrace (open daily 8 a.m. to
10 p.m., weather permitting) that’s now the home of a great summer cafe.
A heady mix of high culture and street entertainment, the “new” Somerset
House is home to three noteworthy art collections. Each gallery charges
an admission fee of £5 ($10) for adults, £4 ($8) for seniors; children under
18 enter free. The three galleries are all open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
The Courtauld Gallery (% 020/7848-2526) has been in Somerset House
since 1989. Impressionist and post-Impressionist paintings are still the
gallery’s main strength. Major works include Manet’s Bar at the Folies
Bergères; Monet’s Banks of the Seine at Argenteuil; Lady with Parasol by
Degas; La Loge by Renoir; Van Gogh’s Self-Portrait with Bandaged Ear; and
several Cézannes, including The Card Players. But you’ll find work by most
great names (many by Rubens), right up to modern greats Ben Nicholson,
Graham Sutherland, and Larry Rivers. Free admission on Mondays, 10 a.m.
to 2 p.m.
The Gilbert Collection (% 020/7420-9400), in the South Building, show-
cases the glittering gold, silver, and mosaics that were valued at £75 mil-
lion when Arthur Gilbert donated the 800-piece collection to the nation in
1996. Some objects came from Princess Diana’s old home, Althorp.
The last and perhaps most extraordinary of the treasures of Somerset
House are the Hermitage Rooms (% 020/7845-4630). This offshoot of the
State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg exhibits pieces from the Russian
Imperial collections in changing shows.
See map p. 210. Strand, WC2. % 020/7845-4600. www.somerset-house.org.uk.

Admission: Somerset House free; separate admissions for the galleries. Open:
Courtyard 7:30 a.m.–11 p.m. (until 7 p.m. in winter); galleries daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last
admittance 45 minutes to 1 hour earlier). Closed Jan 1 and Dec 24–26.

Wallace Collection
Marylebone
The palatial town house of the late Lady Wallace is the setting for a spec-
tacular collection of art, ornaments, and armaments. You can enjoy out-
standing French works by the likes of Watteau and Fragonard, as well as
masterpieces from the Dutch (Frans Hals and Rembrandt), English,
Spanish, and Italian schools. Decorative art from 18th-century France and
European and Asian weapons are also on display. Give yourself at least 
an hour. The courtyard, with its new glass roof, is a pleasant spot for lunch
or tea.

Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Literary landmarks
Writers have been drawn to London for centuries and have left their lit-
erary imprints all over this vast metropolis. Listed in this section are
some of the unique places associated with writers who lived in London,
as well as one of the world’s great storehouses of literary treasures.
British Library Exhibition Centre
Marylebone
The venerable British Library moved to this new building in 1998 and dis-
plays some of the world’s most famous books, maps, manuscripts, and
documents in a series of special galleries. This is where you can see a copy
of the Magna Carta, Shakespeare’s first folio, and handwritten manuscripts
by authors such as Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, and Thomas Hardy. Just
as fascinating are the audio recordings that let you hear the voices of
Virginia Woolf and William Butler Yeats among others reading from their
own works. Give this sight at least an hour; allow more time if you love lit-
erature or literary history.
See map p. 210. Euston Road, NW1. % 020/7412-7332. www.bl.uk. Tube: King’s
Cross/St. Pancras (then a 5-minute walk west on Euston; the museum entrance is
just beyond Midland Road). Admission: Free. Tours: Mon, Wed, Fri 3 p.m., Sat 10:30
a.m. and 3 p.m., Sun 11:30 a.m. and 3 p.m.; £6 ($12) adults, £4.50 ($9) seniors, students,
and children. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m. (Tues until 8 p.m.), Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
Carlyle’s House
Chelsea
Thomas Carlyle (author of The French Revolution and many other rarely
read books) and his witty wife, Jane (a noted letter writer), lived in this
pretty 1708 Queen Anne terrace house from 1834 to 1881. Furnished as it
was during their residence, the house is an accurate representation of
middle-class Victorian domestic life. Carlyle’s “soundproof” study in the
skylit attic is filled with memorabilia — his books, a letter from Benjamin
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 215

Disraeli, personal effects, a writing chair, and even his death mask. You
can browse through the house in about a half-hour.
See map p. 210. 24 Cheyne Row, SW3. % 020/7352-7087. Tube: Sloane Square (then
a 20-minute walk south on Lower Sloane Street and Hospital Road to Cheyne Walk
and north on Cheyne Row; or from Sloane Square, take bus 11, 19, or 22). Admission:
£4.50 ($9) adults, £2.30 ($4.60) children. Open: Mid-Mar–late Oct Wed–Fri 2–5 p.m.,
Sat–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
The Charles Dickens Museum
Bloomsbury
Charles Dickens lived in many places, but he and his family called this
Bloomsbury house home from 1837 to 1839. Here, the great author penned
The Pickwick Papers, Oliver Twist, and Nicholas Nickleby, the poignant and
famous portrayals of Victorian England. The museum contains the world’s
most comprehensive Dickens library, portraits, illustrations, and rooms
furnished exactly as they were in Dickens’s time. You can see everything
in a half-hour, but allow more time if you’re a Dickens fanatic.
See map p. 210. 48 Doughty St., WC1. % 020/7405-2127. www.dickensmuseum.

on Doughty Street; the museum is on the east side of the street). Admission: £5 
($10) adults, £4 ($8) seniors, £3 ($6) children. Open: Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 
11 a.m.–5 p.m.
Dr. Johnson’s House
Holborn
Hidden away in a tiny square north of Fleet Street is the Queen Anne house
where Dr. Samuel Johnson, best known as the lexicographer who compiled
one of the first dictionaries of the English language, lived (quite humbly)
from 1748 to 1759. A copy of the original dictionary is on display, along
with Johnson memorabilia. The restored 17th-century house is close to Ye
Olde Cheshire Cheese pub (see Chapter 10), a favorite haunt of the good
doctor, who was celebrated as a storyteller of the first order. You can see
everything on view here in less than half an hour.
See map p. 210. 17 Gough Square, EC4. % 020/7353-3745. www.drjohnsons

Street and east on Fleet Street to Dunstan’s Court; Gough Square is to one side of
Dunstan’s Court). Admission: £4.50 ($9) adults, £3.50 ($7) seniors and students. Open:
Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (Oct–Apr until 5 p.m.).
All manner of intriguing museums
London’s museums are surprisingly varied in their scope and substance.
In addition to all the great art museums that you can read about in the
“Attractions for art lovers” section, earlier in this chapter, the city has
museums dedicated to architecture, design, transportation, medicine,
and money.

Bank of England Museum
The City
Devoted capitalists enjoy the Bank of England Museum, housed in the
enormous Bank of England building. The museum chronicles changes in
the banking industry since the Bank of England’s beginnings in 1694, 
when funds were needed to finance the war against France’s Louis XIV. 
On display are documents from famous customers (including George
Washington), gold bullion, bank notes (forged and real), and coins.
Interactive video displays present information about today’s high-tech
world of finance and a reconstructed 18th-century Banking Hall. You can
see it all in less than an hour.

Design Museum
South Bank
If you’re a design enthusiast — or want to see how commercial design
affects our everyday lives — check out this museum in the hot “new”
Butler’s Wharf area east of Tower Bridge. You can find classical, kitsch,
modern, surreal, and innovative — from Corbusier chairs to the Coke
bottle — all chronicled here. Plus, you get to see some great river views.
Plan to spend at least an hour.

Benjamin Franklin’s London abode
A signer of the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin (1706–1790) was as
American as they come. As a writer, he coined such famous aphorisms as “A penny
saved is a penny earned.” Franklin was also an inventor, and St. Paul’s Cathedral in
London was the first public building in the world to get one of his new lightning rods.
As a statesman, Franklin resided in London between 1757 and 1775, and his “genteel
lodgings,” on Craven Street near Charing Cross Station, served as the first de facto
American embassy after Independence. The Benjamin Franklin House (see map on 
p. 210; 36 Craven St., WC2N; % 020/7930-9121), the only Franklin house remaining in
the world today, opened to the public in 2006 (the 300th anniversary of Franklin’s birth).
Visitors can now enjoy a 45-minute tour led by a costumed guide. Tours take place
Wednesday through Sunday at noon, 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 3:15 p.m., and 4:15 p.m. and cost
£7 ($14) for adults (free for children under 16). You can find more information and book

Geffrye Museum
Shoreditch
The Geffrye is one of London’s most interesting and charming small muse-
ums, but it’s off the beaten tourist track in East London and consequently
overlooked by many visitors. In a chronological sequence of meticulously
recreated period rooms, the museum displays the furniture and domestic
interiors of the urban middle classes in London from Tudor times up to
the present day. Each room has an audio component that allows you to
hear extracts of books, newspapers, or letters written during the period.
Set in beautiful 18th-century buildings that were once the almshouses of
the Ironmongers’ Company, the museum has a nice cafe for lunch or tea.
Allow about an hour to see everything.

Old Operating Theatre Museum & Herb Garret
South Bank
The Old Operating Theatre isn’t for the faint of heart. The roof garret of
the church of St. Thomas, once attached to St. Thomas’s Hospital, con-
tains Britain’s oldest operating theater (from 1822), where students could
witness surgical procedures on poor (literally and figuratively) patients.
You’ll shudder over the collection of mid-19th-century “state-of-the-art”
medical instruments, including amputation saws. The theater was in use
long before the advent of anesthesia in 1846. Prior to that time, if a patient
had a limb amputated, only a blindfold and a bottle of liquor were pro-
vided (and you thought your healthcare was bad). The herb garret was
used for the storage and curing of medicinal herbs.

Sir John Soane’s Museum
Holborn
The house of Sir John Soane (1753–1837), architect of the Bank of England,
is an eccentric cache of ancient sculpture, artifacts, and art mixed in with
odd architectural perspectives, fool-the-eye mirrors, flying arches, and
domes. This captivating Holborn attraction is rarely crowded, which
makes spending an hour even more of a treat. The oldest piece in the
house is the 3,300-year-old sarcophagus of Pharaoh Seti I. Top prize in the
picture gallery goes to William Hogarth’s satirical and sometimes bawdy

a.m.–5 p.m., first Tues of every month 6–9 p.m.
Activities for teens
If you have teens in tow, you may wonder where to take them so that
they won’t feel as though their interests are being completely ignored.
The choices in this section — all places where local London teens hang
out — provide a few screams, a wonderland of games, and some really
loud music.
London Dungeon
South Bank
Don’t bring young children here unless you want to pay for therapy, but
teens seem to love the grisly re-creations of medieval torture and executions
presented at this house of horrors. You find a scream (literally) around every
corner. Amid the tolling bells, dripping water, and caged rats, you can face
Jack the Ripper or witness a simulated burning at the stake. It’s ghoulishly
expensive, but some think it’s more fun than Madame Tussaud’s. Prices vary
according to date and time of entry; you’ll save by booking online.
See map p. 210. 28–34 Tooley St., SE1. % 020/7403-7221. www.thedungeons.com.
Tube: London Bridge (the exhibit is across from the station). Admission: £10–£20
($20–$40) adults, £10–£16 ($20–$32) seniors, students, and children under 15; chil-
dren 14 and under must be accompanied by an adult (not recommended for young
children). Open: Apr–Sept daily 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m. (last admission 5:30 p.m.); Oct–Mar
daily 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (last admission 4:30 p.m.). Closed Dec 25.
Pepsi Trocadero
Piccadilly Circus
This “total entertainment complex” is right on Piccadilly Circus. The lead
attraction is Segaworld, which offers various rides, including Max Drop,
the world’s first indoor freefall ride (don’t eat for at least an hour before),
and 400 ear-splitting, eye-popping video games and simulators. Theme
restaurants include the ersatz Rainforest Cafe (which doesn’t pretend its
proceeds go to support the rain forests and has what may be the worst
food in London) and the 1950s-style Ed’s Easy Diner (see my review in
Chapter 10). Plan to spend some time, because the Pepsi Trocadero is
designed and packaged in such a way that after you’re in, finding your way
out again seems to take forever.
See map p. 210. Piccadilly Circus. www.londontrocadero.com. Tube: Piccadilly
Circus (then a 1-minute walk to the northeast side). Admission: Segaworld is free, but
games and rides cost £2–£5 ($4–$10). Open: Sun–Thurs 10 a.m. to midnight, Fri–Sat 
10 a.m.–1 a.m.

Places that please kids
The little(r) ones probably won’t have much interest in London’s art
museums and historic buildings. But the city offers all kinds of diver-
sions for preteens, including a museum crammed with antique toys and
attractions related to the sea, the stars, and the subway (Tube).
London Aquarium
South Bank
London’s subterranean aquarium, located right beside the British Airways
London Eye, may be a bit disappointing if you’ve been to any of the great
aquariums in North America, and the admission prices have shot up so
much that you may want to think twice about visiting. That said, children
enjoy observing its more than 350 species of fish and aquatic inverte-
brates, including sharks, graceful stingrays, man-eating piranhas, and sea
scorpions. Exhibits, some in floor-to-ceiling tanks, re-create marine habi-
tats from around the world. Plan on spending at least an hour here — more
if you can’t pull the kids away, or you want to get your money’s worth.
See map p. 210. Bridge Road (beside Westminster Bridge), SE1. % 020/7967-8000.
www.londonaquarium.co.uk. Tube: Waterloo (then a 5-minute walk west along
the river). Admission: £13 ($26) adults, £11 ($22) seniors and students, £10 ($20) chil-
dren 3–16, £29 ($58) families (2 adults and 2 children). Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (last
admission 5 p.m.). Closed Dec 25.
London Transport Museum
Covent Garden
Housed in a splendid Victorian building (once the Flower Market at Covent
Garden) that recently received a complete interior overhaul, this museum
chronicles the development of the city’s famous Underground and double-
decker red bus system. A fabulous collection of historic vehicles, including
a horse-drawn bus, and London’s first trolley bus, are on display. Several
KidZones offer interactive exhibits that enable younger visitors to operate
the controls of a Tube train, get their tickets punched, and play with touch-
screen technology. After two hours, you may have to drag them away.

Covent Garden (then a 2-minute walk west to the Piazza; the museum is in the south-
east corner). Admission: £8 ($16) adults, £6.50 ($7) seniors, free for children under 16.
Open: Daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.(last admission at 5:15 p.m.).
Museum of Childhood
Bethnal Green
A branch of the Victoria & Albert Museum, this museum specializes in 
toys from the past and present. You can find a staggering collection of
dolls, many with elaborate period costumes, and fully furnished doll-
houses ranging from simple cottages to miniature mansions. Optical toys,
marionettes, puppets, tin soldiers, war toys, toy trains and aircraft, and a
display of clothing and furniture relating to the social history of childhood
Part IV: Exploring London

make this museum an enchanting place to invest a couple of hours. Oh,
how times — and toys — have changed.

To see or not to see: Shakespearean sights
If you don’t have time to visit Stratford-upon-Avon (see Chapter 14), where
the great poet and dramatist William Shakespeare was born and died, you
can visit two Shakespeare-associated sights on London’s South Bank.
Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre
South Bank
A guided tour of this full-size replica of Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre and
its workshops, all located just east of the original site, will transport you
to the days of Shakespeare and Elizabethan theater: what audiences were
like, the rivalry among the theaters, the cruel bear-baiting shows, and the
notorious Southwark Stews (a nearby area where prostitutes plied their
trade). Watching a Shakespeare play from one of the benches in this roof-
less “wooden O” is a memorable experience, though the hard benches can
be rough on the backside. See Chapter 15 for details on obtaining tickets
for one of the performances, presented mid-April through early October.
If you plan to see a Shakespeare play at the Globe, you can have a snack,
tea, or a full meal in the theater itself. You don’t need to make reservations
at The Globe Café; it’s open daily mid-April through early October 10 a.m.
to 11 p.m. and mid-October through mid-April 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Make reser-
vations ahead for lunch or dinner at The Globe Restaurant (%
020/7928-9444), open daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 11 p.m.
See map p. 210. New Globe Walk (just west of Southwark Bridge), SE1. % 020/
7902-1500. www.shakespeares-globe.org. Tube: Mansion House (then a 10-
minute walk across Southwark Bridge; the theater is visible on the west side along
the river). Tours: £9 ($18) adults, £7.50 ($15) seniors and students, £6.50 ($13) children,
£20 ($40) families (2 adults and 3 children). Open: Mid-Oct–mid-Apr daily 10 a.m.–5
p.m., mid-Apr–mid-Oct (performance season) daily 9 a.m. to noon.
Southwark Cathedral
South Bank
Chaucer and Shakespeare both worshiped at Southwark Cathedral.
London’s second-oldest church after Westminster Abbey, Southwark (pro-
nounced suth-ick) Cathedral is in what was London’s first theater district
(as well as a church-sanctioned center of prostitution). Although the cathe-
dral was partially rebuilt in 1890, a great deal of history is associated with
this 15th-century church. In under 30 minutes, you can see the entire site,
including the Shakespeare memorial window and a 13th-century wooden
effigy of a knight. Lunchtime concerts are regularly given on Monday and
Tuesday; call for exact times and schedules.

See map p. 210. Montague Close (just west of London Bridge), SE1. % 020/7367-6700.
Tube: London Bridge (then a 5-minute walk across London Bridge Road to Cathedral
Street). Admission: Free, but a £3 ($6) donation is suggested. Open: Mon–Fri 7:30
a.m.–6 p.m., Sat–Sun 8:30 a.m.–6 p.m.
Ships ahoy! Nautical London
The River Thames, London’s watery artery to the English Channel, is full
of all kinds of watercraft. This section details two intriguing ships that
you can visit. I also tell you about touring the Thames by boat in the
“Seeing London by Guided Tour” section, later in this chapter.
Golden Hinde
South Bank
A full-scale reconstruction of Sir Francis Drake’s 16th-century flagship,
complete with a crew dressed in Tudor costumes, the Golden Hinde was
built in Devon but launched in San Francisco in 1973 to commemorate
Drake’s claiming of California for Queen Elizabeth I. Like the original, this
ship circumnavigated the globe, sailing more than 140,000 miles before
becoming a permanent floating museum in 1996. A self-guided tour of the
fully rigged ship, once the home to 20 officers and gentlemen and between
40 to 60 crew members, takes about a half-hour.
See map p. 210. St. Mary Overie Dock, Cathedral Street (west of London Bridge), SE1.
% 08700/118-700. www.goldenhinde.org. Tube: London Bridge (then a 5-minute
walk west on Bedale and Cathedral streets). Admission: £4.50 ($9) adults, £3.50 ($7)
seniors, £2.50 ($5) children, £15 ($30) families (2 adults and 2 children). Open: Mon–Fri
11 a.m.–5:30 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; may be closed for educational events.
H.M.S. Belfast
South Bank
The Belfast, a huge Royal Navy cruiser built in 1938 and used in World War
II, is now moored in the Thames near London Bridge, opposite the Tower
of London. Tours of this floating 10,500-ton museum allow visitors to see
all seven decks. On-ship exhibits are devoted to the history of the ship and
the Royal Navy. You and your kids can witness a re-created surface battle.
Plan to spend about 90 minutes.
See map p. 210. Morgan’s Lane, Tooley Street (between Tower Bridge and London
Bridge), SE1. % 020/7940-6300. http://hmsbelfast.iwm.org.uk. Tube:
London Bridge (then a 10-minute walk north across Tooley Street and north on Hays
Lane toward the entrance on the river). Admission: £10 ($20) adults, £6.15 ($12) sen-
iors and students, free for children under 16. Open: Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.;
Nov–Feb daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (last admission 45 minutes before closing).
Architectural highlights and stately homes
Stepping into one of London’s great mansions, you can see what life
lived on a grand scale was really like. The capital is also full of intriguing
Part IV: Exploring London 
222

monuments, including one called, simply, The Monument, and famous
bridges, such as Tower Bridge, which you can visit high above the Thames.
Apsley House
St. James’s
Once known as Number One London because it was the first house past
the tollgate into London, this magnificent neoclassical mansion, designed
by Robert Adam and built between 1771 and 1778, was the London resi-
dence of the first duke of Wellington. The last great London town house,
Apsley contains original collections that are mostly intact. After his phe-
nomenal military career, which included defeating Napoleon at Waterloo
in 1815, the duke was one of the most popular men in England. Apsley
House, with its sumptuous interiors and treasure-trove of paintings, china,
swords, and military honors, reflects the first duke’s position as the most
powerful commander in Europe. A free audio guide explains it all on a self-
guided tour that lasts about an hour. The family is still in residence,
although you never see them.
See map p. 210. Hyde Park Corner, W1. % 020/7499-5676. Tube: Hyde Park Corner
(Exit 3 brings you up next to the house). Admission: £5.30 ($11) adults, £4 ($8) seniors,
£2.70 ($5.40) children. Open: Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m. (Nov–Mar until 4 p.m.). Closed
Dec 24–26, Jan 1, Good Friday (Fri before Easter), and May 1.
The Monument
The City
This 202-foot-high Doric column was designed by Sir Christopher Wren
and commemorates the Great Fire of 1662, which allegedly began in nearby
Pudding Lane and swept through London. The Monument is the tallest iso-
lated stone column in the world — you’ll know just how tall if you climb
the 311 steps to the viewing platform at the top. Note: The Monument is
closed for repair and not scheduled to reopen until late 2008.
See map p. 210. Monument Street (just north of London Bridge), EC3. % 020/
7626-2717. www.themonument.info. Tube: Monument (you get out right across
the street). Admission: £6 ($12) adults, £4.50 ($9) seniors and students, £3 ($6) children.
Open: Daily Apr–Sept 10 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Oct–Mar 9:30 a.m.–6 p.m. (last admission 45
minutes before closing).
Spencer House
St. James’s
The late Princess Diana is probably the most famous member of the
Spencer family, but she never lived in her family’s ancestral London home,
built for the first Earl Spencer in 1766. The house, one of London’s most
beautiful private palaces, hasn’t been a private residence since 1927.
Brilliantly restored and opened as a museum in 1990, its rooms are filled
with period furniture and art loans from Queen Elizabeth, the Tate Britain,
and the Victoria & Albert Museum. Guided tours (the only way to see the
place) take about an hour and are limited to groups of 20.

Tower Bridge Exhibition
South Bank
Step inside Tower Bridge and find out why, how, and when this famous
drawbridge with its pinnacled towers was built and how the mechanism
for raising the bridge for ship traffic actually works. The spectacular views
up and down the Thames from the bridge’s glass-enclosed walkways
double the value of this attraction.

Parks and gardens
Part of London’s charm comes from its giant green parks, small neigh-
borhood squares, and special gardens. You never have to feel oppressed
by too much brick and concrete in this city. If the mood strikes, you may
want to visit one of the lovely spots in this section.
Chelsea Physic Garden
Chelsea
Hidden behind high brick walls, the Chelsea Physic Garden is the second-
oldest surviving botanical garden in England and one of London’s most
beautiful places. The garden, containing more than 7,000 exotic herbs,
shrubs, trees, and flowers, plus England’s earliest rock garden, was

For fans of Princess Di
If you’re a true Princess Diana fan, note that she’s buried on a picturesque island on
the Oval Lake at Althorp, the Spencer family estate in Northamptonshire. The grounds
are open for a limited time each year from July through September, but you can view
the island from across the lake only. Admission costs £12 ($24) adults, £10 ($20) sen-
iors, £6 ($12) children, and £30 ($60) families (two adults and two children). The charge
includes admission to the Diana Museum set up by her brother, Earl Spencer. The
museum contains an exhibit celebrating Diana’s childhood, her royal wedding (includ-
ing her famous wedding gown), and her charitable works. You can book your tickets
in advance by calling % 0870/167-9000. You can also buy day-of tickets at the Gate
House or online at www.althorp.com.

founded in 1673 by the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries to develop
medicinal and commercial plant species. Cotton seeds from this garden
launched an industry in the new colony of Georgia. The garden is small
enough (31⁄2 acres) to wander through in less than an hour, but budget
some more time if you love plants. Drop by the nice teahouse on the prem-
ises for a spot of tea.

Regent’s Park
Marylebone
Regent’s Park spans 400 acres of green, mostly open parkland fringed by
imposing Regency terraces. The park is the home of the London Zoo
(described under “London’s Top Sights,” earlier in this chapter). People
come here to play soccer, cricket, tennis, and softball; boat on the lake;
visit Queen Mary’s Rose Garden (which includes an outdoor theater —
see Chapter 15); and let their kids have fun at the many playgrounds. The
park offers summer lunch and evening bandstand concerts, as well as
puppet shows and other children’s activities on weekdays throughout
August. The northernmost section of the park rises to the summit of
Primrose Hill, which provides fine views of Westminster and the City. The
restrooms by Chester Gate, on the east side of the park, offer facilities for
persons with disabilities.
See map p. 210. Just north of Marylebone Road and surrounded by the Outer Circle
road. % 020/7486-7905, or 020/7486-2431 for advance booking for Open Air Theatre

airtheatre.org. Tube: Regent’s Park or Baker Street (then a 5-minute walk north
to the south end of the park). Open: Daily 5 a.m. to dusk.
Royal Botanic Gardens
Kew
Located 9 miles southwest of Central London, the Royal Botanic Gardens
at Kew — more familiarly known as Kew Gardens — are a gift to garden
lovers. A trip to Kew takes the better part of a day to allow for travel time
and garden strolling, but the enjoyment of the experience is well worth the
time investment. On display in the 300-acre gardens is a marvelous array
of specimens first planted in the 17th and 18th centuries. Orchids and
palms are nurtured in the Victorian glass pavilion hothouse. The site con-
tains a lake, aquatic gardens, a Chinese pagoda, and even a royal palace.
Kew Palace, smallest and loveliest of the former royal compounds, where
King George III went insane and where Queen Charlotte died in 1818, is
open from April through September. Queen Charlotte’s Cottage (not open
to the public) served as the mad king’s summer retreat. A sightseeing bus
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 225

called Kew Explorer makes a complete circuit of the gardens (with hop-on/
hop-off service) and costs £3.50 ($7) for adults, and £1 ($2) for children.
Tired of the Tube? Why not take a boat to Kew Gardens? April to late Sep-
tember, vessels operated by the Westminster Passenger Service Associ-
ation (% 020/7930-2062; www.wpsa.co.uk) leave from Westminster Pier
daily at 10:30 a.m., 11 a.m., and 2 p.m. Round-trip fare for the 90-minute
journey costs £17 ($34) adults, £11 ($22) seniors, £8.25 ($17) children, and
£41 ($82) families (two adults and two children). The last boat from Kew
usually departs around 5.30 p.m. (depending on the tide).

A quaint village just a Tube ride away
The London that you see today was once a series of separate villages.
The nearby village of Hampstead, with its adjacent heath land, still
retains its rural charm and makes for an excellent mini day trip.
Hampstead and Hampstead Heath
Although only 15 minutes by Tube from Central London, Hampstead main-
tains its old-world charm. It’s filled with Regency and Georgian houses
(many set in lovely gardens) favored by artists and writers, from Keats to
John le Carré. Flask Walk, the village’s pedestrian mall, provides an eclec-
tic assemblage of historic pubs, shops, and chic boutiques. The village itself
has a lot of old alleys, steps, courts, and groves just begging to be explored.
Adjacent Hampstead Heath is 800 acres of high parkland offering an
opportunity for picnicking, swimming, and fishing. On a clear day, you can
see St. Paul’s Cathedral and even the hills of Kent. An excursion here takes
up at least a half-day or more.
See map p. 227. Tube: Hampstead (the Tube stop is 1 minute from Flask Walk) or
Hampstead Heath (Parliament Hill, right behind the Tube stop, leads up into the park itself).
Kenwood House
This lovely neoclassical villa sits on the shore of Kenwood Lake in the
northern section of Hampstead Heath. The villa was remodeled in the
1760s by Robert Adam. Inside, you find a small but impressive collection
of paintings (with works by Gainsborough, Rembrandt, Reynolds, Turner,
and Vermeer) and jewelry. You can get something to eat in the cafeteria in
the former coach house. For an enjoyable summer outdoor concert expe-
rience, visit the Kenwood Lakeside concert (see Chapter 15).
Hampstead Lane (Hampstead), NW3. % 020/8348-1286. Tube: Archway (then bus 210

Royal castles and palaces
Everyone wants to see Buckingham Palace, the queen’s London residence.
But another royal residence, accessible year-round, awaits in nearby
Windsor. Just as memorable is Hampton Court, another great royal com-
pound from the time of Henry VIII.

In 1514, Cardinal Wolsey began building the splendid Tudor Hampton
Court in East Moseley, Surrey, 13 miles west of London on the north side

of the Thames. Henry VIII nabbed Hampton Court for himself and made it
a royal residence, which it remained until 1760. The Anne Boleyn Gate,
with its 16th-century astronomical clock, and the Great Hall, with its
hammer-beam ceiling, are remnants from Hampton Court’s Tudor days.
Later, the palace was much altered by Sir Christopher Wren for William
and Mary. Wren also designed the famous Maze, where visitors can wander
in dizzy confusion. Inside the enormous palace are various state apart-
ments and private rooms, including the King’s Dressing Room and Tudor
kitchens, and containing wooden carvings by Grinling Gibbons, Italian
paintings, and guides dressed in period costumes. The manicured Thames-
side gardens are lovely. You find a cafe and restaurant on the grounds. You
need a full day for this excursion.

Windsor Castle
Windsor is one of the queen’s official residences. The castle, with its
imposing skyline of towers and battlements rising from the center of the
4,800-acre Great Park, is located in Windsor, Berkshire, 20 miles from the
center of London. Royals have used the castle as a residence since its con-
struction by William the Conqueror approximately 900 years ago. The
State Apartments that are open to visitors range from the intimate cham-
bers of Charles II to the enormous Waterloo Chamber, built to commemo-
rate the victory over Napoleon in 1815. All apartments are furnished with
important works of art from the Royal Collection. Queen Mary’s
Dollhouse, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens as a present for Queen Mary in
1921, is a marvelous palace in miniature. St. George’s Chapel, a Gothic
masterpiece of the 14th century, is the burial place of ten monarchs and
the home of the Order of the Garter.
April through June, the Changing of the Guard takes place Monday
through Saturday at 11 a.m. (on alternate days the rest of the year). From

Ghost palace
So many people, from staff to visitors, have reported encounters with Catherine
Howard’s ghost in the “haunted gallery” at Hampton Court that psychologists from the
University of Hertfordshire conducted an investigation to see if they could find a sci-
entific explanation for the phenomenon. Not surprisingly, the results were inconclusive.
Catherine, the fifth wife of King Henry VIII, was locked up in Hampton Court prior to her
beheading for adultery in 1542. One day, she supposedly escaped and in desperation
ran along the 40-foot gallery to pound on the King’s door and beg for mercy. Sightings
in this gallery of a running, screaming apparition have been reported for centuries.

the ramparts of Windsor, you can look down on the playing fields of Eton
College, where aristocrats have been sending their boys for generations.
All the royals attend the famous school in the charming town of Eton
across the Thames Bridge. Give yourself a full day for this excursion.

Greenwich: The center of time and space
Time is of the essence in Greenwich, a town and borough of Greater
London, about 4 miles east of the City. The world’s clocks are set accord-
ing to Greenwich mean time, and visitors from around the globe flock
here to stand on the prime meridian, the line from which the world’s
longitude is measured. The historic buildings in Greenwich are impor-
tant enough that UNESCO has listed them as a World Heritage Site.
Greenwich offers enough to keep you fully occupied for a full day, and it
makes a great outing for kids.
The most interesting route to get to Greenwich is by Docklands Light
Rail from Tower Hill Gateway, which takes you past Canary Wharf and all
the new Docklands development. The one-way fare costs £4 ($8). Take
the train to Island Gardens, the last stop, and then walk through the foot
tunnel beneath the Thames to Greenwich. You come out next to the Cutty
Sark. You can also take the Jubilee Underground line to Greenwich North
and then bus 188 to the Cutty Sark. Thames River Services (% 020/
7930-4097) runs a year-round fleet of boats from Westminster Pier to
Greenwich Pier. A round-trip ticket costs £10 ($20) adults, £26 ($52) for
families (two adults and two children).
All the attractions in Greenwich are clearly signposted, and you can reach
them on foot. The Greenwich Tourist Information Centre (Pepys House,
Cutty Sark Gardens; % 0870/608-2000) is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The
center offers 11⁄2- to 2-hour walking tours (at 12:15 p.m. and 2:15 p.m.) of
the town’s major sights for £4 ($8). Reservations aren’t necessary, but
you may want to call first to make sure that the schedule hasn’t changed.
Cutty Sark
The majestic Cutty Sark, berthed on the river Thames, is the last of the tea-
clipper sailing ships. It was launched in 1869 and first used for the lucra-
tive China Sea tea trade. Later, the ship carried wool from Australia and
after that (up until the end of World War II) served as a training ship. The
ship had been closed for restoration when a fire struck on May 21, 2007,
causing major damage. It is scheduled to reopen in late 2008. Until that
time, you can visit an adjacent exhibition that details the history of the
Cutty Sark and the work that’s being done to save it.

National Maritime Museum
The paintings of ships are boring, but the National Maritime Museum also
displays sailing crafts and models and an extensive exhibit on Lord Nelson,
which includes hundreds of his personal artifacts (including the coat that
he was wearing when he was shot at the Battle of Trafalgar). New galleries
with interactive technology explore modern maritime issues. You can sail
through in about a half-hour. There’s a nice cafe for lunch or a snack.

Queen’s House
Adjacent to the National Maritime Museum, you can find the splendidly
restored Queen’s House, designed by Inigo Jones in 1616 and later used as
a model for the White House. The house, the first classical building in
England, was commissioned by Anne of Denmark, the wife of James I, and
completed in 1635 (with later modifications). You can visit the royal apart-
ments on a self-guided tour that takes about a half-hour. You may catch a
special exhibit being held here.

Royal Naval College
Near the Cutty Sark, the Royal Naval College occupies the site of Greenwich
Palace, which stood here from 1422 to 1620 and was the birthplace of Henry
VIII, Mary I, and Elizabeth I. Badly damaged by Cromwell’s troops during
the English Civil War, the palace was later torn down, and in 1696 a naval
hospital for retired seamen was erected in its place. The Thames-side build-
ings, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, became the Naval College in 1873
and are today a UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site. The only rooms
open to visitors are the chapel and the imposing Great Hall with its daz-
zling painted ceiling. The body of Lord Nelson lay in state here in 1805.

Royal Observatory Greenwich
Huff your way up the hill from Queen’s House (see listing above) in
Greenwich Great Park to explore the Royal Observatory, where you can
straddle the prime meridian (longitude 0 degrees), the center of time and
space. The Observatory reopened in 2007 after a spectacular £15 million
($30 million) redevelopment. Interactive exhibits in the new Weller

Astronomy Galleries explain how stars and planets are born and help
unravel the mysteries of the universe. The Star Life planetarium show in
the new, state-of-the-art Peter Harrison Planetarium explores the night sky
and how stars are born, grow up, grow old, and die. Shows are hosted by
real astronomers, who are available to answer questions after the main
program (children must be 7 years or older). Also look for the collection
of original 18th-century chronometers (marked H1, H2, H3, and H4), beau-
tiful instruments that were developed to help mariners chart longitude by
time instead of by the stars.

(June–Sept until 6 p.m.); planetarium shows Mon–Fri 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m., 4 p.m.,
Sat–Sun additional shows at 11 a.m. and noon.
Seeing London by Guided Tour
When it comes to London sightseeing tours, you’re limited only by your
imagination, stamina, and budget. You can tour London with an experi-
enced guide by bus, by boat, or on foot.
Bus tours
Original London Sightseeing Tours (% 020/8877-1722; www.theoriginal
tour.com) maintains a fleet of double-decker buses (many of them open
on top) and offers hop-on/hop-off service at more than 90 boarding points
around the city and includes a 50-minute river cruise. You can choose
from four tour routes. The Original London Sightseeing Tour lasts 90
minutes and passes every major sight in Central London and the South
Bank; the tour starts from Piccadilly Circus (Tube: Piccadilly Circus) out-
side the Planet Hollywood restaurant on Coventry Street and departs
every few minutes daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 9 p.m. in summer). You
don’t have to book any of the sightseeing tours in advance; you can pay
on the bus. A ticket good for 24 hours on all routes costs £19 ($38) for
adults and £12 ($24) for children under 16. For more information or to
book discounted tickets online, check out the Web site.
The Big Bus Company (% 020/7233-9533; www.bigbus.co.uk) leaves
from Green Park, Victoria, and Marble Arch daily, from 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m.
(4:30 p.m. in winter) on three different routes that take anywhere from
11⁄2 to 21⁄2 hours. Tickets include a river cruise and walking tours, and cost
£20 ($40) for adults and £10 ($20) for children ages 5 to 15. Valid for 24
hours, they let you hop on and off at 54 locations. Big Bus often has spe-
cial offers, too, throwing in cheap theater tickets, fast-entry to popular
attractions, and so on.
Another tour company with many guided excursions is Golden Tours
(4 Fountain Square, 123–151 Buckingham Palace Rd.; % 800/456-6303 in
Chapter 11: Discovering London’s Top Attractions 231

the U.S. or 020/7233-7030; www.goldentours.co.uk). Its buses are comfy
and have restrooms, and the certified guides have a certifiable sense of
humor. The daily Historic & Modern London tour is a full-day outing
that includes the West End, Westminster Abbey, the Changing of the
Guard (at Buckingham Palace or Horse Guards Parade), the City of
London, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and a cruise from the
Tower down to Charing Cross Pier; the price includes a pub lunch and
all admissions. This tour costs £72 ($144) for adults, £69 ($138) for sen-
iors and students, and £62 ($124) for kids under 16. Tours depart from
the office at Buckingham Palace Road (Tube: Victoria) and other points
in Central London. You can book your tickets directly or online, or you
can ask your hotel concierge to do it two days in advance.
Boat tours
A cruise down the majestic Thames is a marvelous way to take in the
city’s sights. Sightseeing boats regularly ply the river between Westminster
and the Tower of London; some continue downstream to Greenwich
(site of the prime meridian, Cutty Sark, and Old Royal Observatory) and
upstream to Kew Gardens and Hampton Court. The main departure
points along the Thames are at Westminster Pier (Tube: Westminster),
Waterloo Pier (Tube: Waterloo), Embankment Pier (Tube: Embankment),
Tower Pier (Tube: Tower Hill), and Greenwich Pier (Tube: Greenwich).
Transport for London (% 020/7222-1234; www.tfl.gov.uk) runs a fleet
of commuter and sightseeing boats on the Thames from Westminster Pier
to Greenwich. An all-day hop-on/hop-off River Rover ticket costs £11
($22) adults, £27 ($54) for families (two adults and two children). You
can buy tickets at Westminster, Waterloo, Tower, or City piers.
Daily from March through November and on weekends the rest of the
year, Bateaux London/Catamaran Cruisers (% 020/7695-1800; www.
catamarancruisers.co.uk) offers a one-hour circular cruise from
Westminster Pier (Tube: Westminster) that passes most of London’s
major monuments and stops at Festival Pier, Bankside Pier, London
Bridge City Pier, and St. Katharine’s Pier (hop-on/hop-off service). All the
boats provide live commentary and have a fully licensed bar. The cruise
costs £10 ($20) for adults, £4.75 ($9.50) for children, and £23 ($46) for
families (two adults and three children).
The same company offers a daily lunch cruise departing at 12:30 p.m.
that costs £24 ($48) for adults, £13 ($26) for children. A nightly dinner
cruise leaves at 7:15 p.m. and returns at 9:45 p.m. The cruise, which
includes a two- to four-course dinner with live music and after-dinner
dancing, costs £69 to £105 ($138–$210) per person, depending on 
the various add-ons that you choose. A two-hour Sunday jazz lunch
cruise departs at 12:30 p.m. and costs £40 to £55 ($80–$110) per person.
Advance reservations are required for all tours, and a smart-casual dress
code applies (no sweatpants or running shoes). All cruises depart from
Embankment Pier.

An amphibious tour
London Duck Tours (% 020/7928-3132; www.londonducktours.co.uk)
has adapted several World War II amphibious troop carriers, known as
DUKWs, to civilian comfort levels and painted them bright yellow. It runs
80-minute road-and-river trips. Tours start behind County Hall (site of
the British Airways London Eye giant observation wheel). It picks up
passengers on Chicheley Street (Tube: Westminster, then walk across
Westminster Bridge), then rumbles through Westminster and up to
Piccadilly, gathering bemused stares as it passes many of London’s major
tourist sites. Then the vehicle splashes into the Thames at Vauxhall for a
30-minute cruise as far as the Houses of Parliament. The tours cost £18
($36) for adults, £14 ($28) for seniors, and £12 ($24) for children.
Walking tours
A walking tour is an affordable way to see London from street level in
the company of a knowledgeable guide. This type of tour is great for his-
tory, literature, and architecture buffs, and older kids generally have a
good time, as well. The weekly events listings in Time Out magazine,
available at every news agent in London, include dozens of intriguing
walks; a walk happens every day.
The Original London Walks, P.O. Box 1708, London NW6 4LW (% 020/
7624-3978; www.walks.com), offers a terrific array of tours, including
Jack the Ripper’s London, Christopher Wren’s London, Oscar Wilde’s
London, and The Beatles’ Magical Mystery Tour. Guides lead different
walks every day of the week, rain or shine; tours last about two hours
and begin and end near Underground stations. You don’t need to make
advance reservations. Call for schedules and departure points. A London
Walk costs £6 ($12) for adults and £5 ($10) for seniors and students with
ID; kids under 15 can tour for free if accompanied by a parent.

Shopping the Local Stores
In This Chapter
 Getting your VAT refund
 Taking your purchases through Customs
 Visiting the big department stores
 Shopping Knightsbridge and the West End
L
ondon is one of the world’s great shopping meccas. If shopping is on
your agenda, you can find any item that you’re looking for. But you
won’t find many bargains, except during the department stores’ big sales
in January and July.
Surveying the Shopping Scene
You get the best values on goods that are manufactured in England.
Items from the Body Shop, Filofax, or Dr. Martens cost less than they do
abroad, though with the current strength of the pound they might not be
such a bargain. Other potentially good values include woolens and cash-
meres, English brands of bone china, English toiletries, antiques, used
silver, old maps and engravings, and rare books. You can also do well
with French products.
You may be surprised — and perhaps disappointed — at the number of
big U.S. chains (called multiples in the U.K.) that have opened stores in
London. But in addition to the familiar chains and mega-stores, London
is still the home of hundreds of small, unique specialty shops and bou-
tiques to delight the eye and empty the wallet.
Normal shopping hours are Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m., with a late closing (7 p.m. or 8 p.m.) on Wednesday or Thursday.
The law allows stores to be open for six hours on Sunday, usually 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m.
If you’re a truly dedicated shopper, check out Suzy Gershman’s Born to
Shop London (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). This comprehensive guide intro-
duces you to just about every worthwhile shop and shopping experi-
ence in London.

Getting the VAT back
You have to pay a 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) in London and
throughout the United Kingdom on every retail item except books and
children’s clothing. Anyone who isn’t a resident of the European Union
can get a VAT refund, but every store requires a minimum purchase to
qualify. The exact amount varies from store to store, but the minimum
amount is never less than £50 ($100) and may be as high as £100 ($200)
at a store like Harrods. But qualifying for a tax refund is far easier in
Britain than in almost any other country in the European Union.
VAT isn’t charged on goods shipped out of the country, no matter how
much you spend, although books are exempt. You can avoid VAT and the
hassle of lugging large packages back with you by having London stores
ship your purchases for you; many are happy to do so. However, ship-
ping charges can double the cost of your purchase, and you may also
have to pay U.S. duties when the goods arrive. Instead of using this
costly strategy, consider paying for excess baggage (rates vary with the
airlines) when you fly home.
Part IV: Exploring London 
238

To get a VAT refund, you must get a VAT refund form from the retailer,
and the retailer must complete the form at the time of purchase. Don’t
leave the store without a completed refund form. Don’t let any merchant
tell you that you can get refund forms at the airport.
You can get back about 15 percent of the 17.5 percent VAT that you pay
on your purchases. (You can’t get back the entire amount.) To obtain
your refund, follow these steps:
1. Ask the store whether it does VAT refunds and how much the
minimum purchase is.
2. If you’ve spent the minimum amount, ask for the VAT refund
paperwork.
The retailer must fill out a portion.
3. Fill out your portion of the form (name and address).
4. Present the form — along with the goods — at the Cash VAT
Refund counter at the airport.
You may be required to show the goods at your time of departure, so
don’t pack them in your checked luggage; put them in your carryon
instead.
After the paperwork is stamped, you have two choices:
 You can mail in the papers and receive your refund in a British
check (no!) or a credit card refund (yes!).
 You can go directly to the Cash VAT Refund counter at the airport
and get your refund in cash.
If you’re traveling from London to other countries in the European
Union, don’t apply for your VAT refund at the London airport. Apply for
all your VAT refunds at one time at your final destination, prior to depar-
ture from the European Union.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 239
Saving on the London sales
Traditionally, London stores hold sales in January and July. In recent times, the July
sales have begun in June or earlier. The January sale is the main event, and it gener-
ally starts after the first week (when round-trip airfares are low).
The January sale at Harrods is the most famous, but nearly every other store has a
big sale at the same time. Discounts usually range from 25 percent to 50 percent at
the major stores, such as Harrods and Selfridges. At Harrods, you can find the best
buys on the store’s logo souvenirs, English china, and English designer brands, such
as Jaeger.

Getting your goodies through Customs
The U.S. Customs authority doesn’t impose limits on how much loot U.S.
citizens can bring home from a trip abroad, but it does put limits on how
much they can bring back for free. You may bring home $800 worth of
goods duty-free if you’ve been out of the country at least 48 hours and
haven’t used the exemption in the past 30 days. Here’s some additional
information about the limit and Customs law:
 You can bring back not more than 1 liter of an alcoholic beverage
(you must be over 21 to carry any alcohol).
 You can carry up to 200 cigarettes and 100 cigars.
 Antiques more than 100 years old and works of art are exempt from
the $800 limit, as is anything that you mail home from abroad.
 You may mail up to $200 worth of goods to yourself (marked “For
Personal Use”) and up to $100 worth to others (marked
“Unsolicited Gift”) once each day, as long as the package doesn’t
include alcohol or tobacco products.
 You have to pay an import duty on anything over these limits — a
flat rate of 10 percent duty on the next $1,000 worth of purchases.
Be sure to have your receipts with you. For more specific guidance, 
contact the U.S. Customs Service (P.O. Box 7407, Washington, DC 20044;
% 202-927-6724; www.cbp.gov) and request the free pamphlet “Know
Before You Go.” Or check out the details and order online at the
Customs Department Web site.
Returning Canadian citizens are allowed a C$300 exemption and can
bring back, free of duty, 200 cigarettes, 2.2 pounds of tobacco, 40 impe-
rial ounces (1.2 quarts) of liquor, and 50 cigars. Declare all valuables that
you’re taking with you to the United Kingdom, such as expensive cam-
eras, on the Y-38 Form before you leave Canada. For a clear summary of
Canadian rules, write for the booklet “I Declare,” issued by Revenue
Canada (2265 St. Laurent Blvd., Ottawa K1G 4KE; % 800-461-9999 or
613-993-0534; www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca).
Returning Australian citizens have a duty-free allowance of A$400 (A$200
for children under 18). Citizens can bring home, free of duty, 250 cigarettes
or 250 grams of loose tobacco, and 1.125 liters of alcohol. Australian 
citizens who plan to return home with valuable goods that they already
own (for example, foreign-made cameras) need to file Form B263 before
leaving Australia. For more information, contact Australian Customs Serv-
ices (GPO Box 8, Sydney NSW 2001; % 1300/363-263; www.customs.
gov.au).
The duty-free allowance for New Zealand citizens is NZ$700. Citizens
over 17 can bring in up to 200 cigarettes, 50 cigars, or 250 grams of
tobacco, or a mix of all three if the combined weight doesn’t exceed 250
Part IV: Exploring London 
240

grams; plus 4.5 liters of beer and wine, or 1.125 liters of liquor. To avoid
paying duty on goods that you already own (cameras and the like), fill
out a certificate of export before you leave New Zealand, listing the valu-
ables that you’re taking out of the country. For more information, contact
New Zealand Customs (The Customhouse, 17–21 Whitmore St., Box 2218,
Wellington; % 04/473-6099 or 0800/428-786; www.customs.govt.nz).
Checking Out the Big Names
London is full of department stores. Some, like world-famous Harrods,
may be familiar to you. Others, like Harvey Nichols, may be pleasant sur-
prises. Each of these established department stores has its own style
and personality. 
Fenwick of Bond Street
Mayfair
Fenwick of Bond Street is a high-style women’s fashion store. Fenwick (pro-
nounced fen-ick) was founded in 1891 and offers an impressive collection
of designer women’s wear, ranging from moderately priced ready-to-wear
items to more expensive designer fashions. Fenwick also sells an array of

Fortnum & Mason
St. James’s
Fortnum & Mason holds two Royal Warrants (a form of official patronage
that the store can use in its advertising) and serves as the queen’s London
grocer. Amid a setting of deep-red carpets and crystal chandeliers, you can
find everything from pâté de foie gras to Campbell’s soup. The grocery
department carries the finest foods from around the world, and on the
other floors, you can find bone china, crystal, leather, antiques, and sta-
tionery departments. Dining choices include Patio, St. James’s, and The
Fountain (see Chapter 10).

Harrods
Knightsbridge
Harrods may be the most famous department store in the world, but I’ve
always found its merchandise to be pretty dull stuff. Carrying one of the
coveted green plastic Harrods bags that you get with your purchase can
provide you with a sense of accomplishment, though. The store’s 300
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 241

departments offer an enormous range and variety of merchandise. Best of
all are the Food Halls, stocked with a huge variety of foods and several
cafes. Believe it or not, you may not be admitted if you’re wearing inap-
propriate clothing or your belly button is showing.

Harvey Nichols
Knightsbridge
Harvey Nichols, the late Princess Diana’s favorite store, has its own gour-
met food hall and fancy restaurant, the Fifth Floor, and is crammed with
designer home furnishings, gifts, and fashions. Women’s clothing is the
largest segment of its business, a familiar fact to those fans of the 1990s
British TV series Absolutely Fabulous. Harvey Nicks, as it’s called, doesn’t
compete with Harrods because the former features a much more upmar-
ket, fashionable image.

Liberty
Mayfair
Liberty provides six floors of fashion, china, home furnishings, upholstery
fabrics, scarves, ties, luggage, and gifts. The store is best known for its
Liberty Prints — fine quality fabrics, typically in floral patterns. These dis-
tinctive fabrics are highly sought after by interior decorators because they
add an unmistakable touch of England to any room décor. A Liberty tie
makes a great gift for your guy back home.

Harrods loses Royal Warrants
The London gossip columns were ablaze early in 2000 when Prince Philip withdrew his
Royal Warrant (a sign of official royal patronage) from Harrods, claiming that the royal
household just didn’t use the store as much as it used to. Harrods just happens to be
owned by Mohamed Al Fayed, father of Dodi Al Fayed, who was killed with Princess
Diana in that famous car crash. The elder Mr. Al Fayed, an Egyptian who’s been denied
U.K. citizenship, has made some startling allegations against the House of Windsor,
claiming that the deaths of Diana and his son were not accidental. Could that be the
real reason that Harrods is now warrant-less?

Marks & Spencer
Mayfair
Marks & Spencer is a private-label department store that offers basics of
all kinds. The merchandise at both locations is high quality and has in
recent years moved way beyond the store’s trademark conservative
image.
See map p. 250. 458 Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7935-7954; Tube: Marble Arch) and 
173 Oxford St., W1 (% 020/7437-7722; Tube: Oxford Circus). www.marksand

6 p.m.
Selfridges
Mayfair
Selfridges is one of the largest department stores in Europe. The store has
been redone to attract upscale customers, but its vast size provides room
for less-expensive, mass-marketed lines as well. More than 500 divisions
sell everything, from artificial flowers to groceries. The Miss Selfridge bou-
tique, on one side of the store near the cosmetics department, features
teen fashions, hotshot clothes, accessories, makeup, and moderately
priced, cutting-edge fashions. While on this side of the store, you can visit
the cafe.

Shopping the Street Markets
Markets make for fun shopping because you never know what you may
find. Adventurous shoppers who like to browse and dawdle can really
enjoy themselves at the places listed in this section.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 243
Finding a drugstore
The English refer to a drugstore as a chemist’s shop. All over London, you can find
Boots the Chemist stores. In terms of size and convenience, the best one is just across
from Harrods (72 Brompton Rd., SW3; % 020/7589-6557; Tube: Knightsbridge). In addi-
tion to medicine, Boots sells film, pantyhose (called tights), sandwiches, and all of life’s
little necessities. The store is open Monday through Friday 8:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. and
Saturday 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. One of the most centrally located chemists is Bliss the
Chemist (5 Marble Arch, W1; % 020/7723-6116; Tube: Marble Arch), open daily 9 a.m.
to midnight. Zafash Pharmacy (233–235 Old Brompton Rd., SW5 % 020/7373-2798;
Tube: Earl’s Court) is London’s only 24-hour pharmacy.

Brick Lane and Spitalfields Markets
On Sundays between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., Brick Lane Market (Cheshire
Street and Sclater Street, E1; % 020/7377-8963; Tube: Liverpool Street)
is lined with hundreds of stalls, with clothing, fabrics, bric-a-brac,
leather goods, antiques, and furniture all being traded. You may
encounter some worthwhile bargains here, and you can check out the
great Bangladeshi restaurants along the Lane.
Nearby Spitalfields Market (Commercial Street, E1; no phone; www.
visitspitalfields.com; Tube: Liverpool Street), housed in a late-
19th-century market building, has undergone a complete transformation
and is now a trendy new gathering spot where you’ll find great Italian/
French breads, German cheesecakes and organic food, together with
gifts, clothing, crafts and knickknacks. The food court, where most world
cuisines are represented (including Chinese, West Indian, and Hungarian)
is among the best of any London market. The market is open Monday
through Friday 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., and Sunday 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Camden Market
Vying with Portobello Road for the title of London’s most popular
market, Camden actually boasts a number of distinct markets, which
combine to give the visitor a great day out and bargains galore. Some
areas are open Thursday to Saturday; others operate weekends only.
The best of the many markets in Camden is the Stables Market (no
phone; Tube: Camden Town), housed in a historic horse stable dating
back to 1854 and offering an impressive array of fashion ranging from
Goth, fetish, and cyberpunk to vintage, retro, and secondhand, plus
stalls selling everything from secondhand records to leather goods,
antiques, and other accessories. In addition to the markets, Camden
High Street has some of the trendiest fashion boutiques in London.
Chelsea Antiques Market and Antiquarius
In a rambling old building, the Chelsea Antiques Market (253 King’s Rd.,
SW3; % 020/7352-5689; Tube: Sloane Square) offers endless bric-a-brac
browsing possibilities. You can search out old or rare books at this
market. You’ll probably run across Staffordshire dogs, shaving mugs,
Edwardian buckles and clasps, ivory-handled razors, old velours, lace
gowns, and wooden tea caddies — and that’s just the beginning. The
market is closed on Sunday.
Another good market is Antiquarius (131–141 King’s Rd., SW3; % 020/
7351-5353; Tube: Sloane Square), where more than 120 dealers offer spe-
cialized merchandise — usually of the small, domestic variety, such as
antique and period jewelry, porcelain, silver, first-edition books, boxes,
clocks, prints, and paintings. The shops and booths are generally open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Part IV: Exploring London 
244

Covent Garden Market
The Covent Garden Market (% 020/7836-9136; www.coventgarden
market.co.uk; Tube: Covent Garden) includes retail stores and two dif-
ferent markets (the kind with open-air stalls), open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.:
 Traders sell all kinds of goods at the busy Apple Market (no
phone). Much of the merchandise is what the English call collectible
nostalgia, which includes glassware and ceramics, leather goods,
toys, clothes, hats, and jewelry. Antiques dealers predominate on
Mondays.
 Jubilee Market (% 020/7836-2139), at the backside of Covent
Garden, is a bit more downscale, where you can find cheap clothes
and books. Some of London’s best shopping can be found at the
restored hall on The Piazza and at specialty shops in the area.
Petticoat Lane Market
Over 400 years old and still going strong, Petticoat Lane (% 020/7377-
8963; Tube: Liverpool Street) is one of the East End’s biggest and most
famous markets, with over a thousand stalls. Taking up an area in and
around Middlesex Street and Wentworth Street, E1, it’s open Monday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.
Sunday is the best day for bargains on fashions, Asian fabrics, textiles,
and jewelry. Haggling is a prerequisite.
Portobello Market
Kensington Church Street dead-ends at the Notting Hill Gate Tube sta-
tion, which is the jumping-off point for Portobello Market (no phone;
www.portobelloroad.co.uk; Tube: Notting Hill Gate), the famous
London street market along Portobello Road. Portobello (market and
road) is a magnet for collectors of virtually anything from precious 
junk to precious antiques. The market is generally open Saturday 6 a.m.
to 5 p.m. You may find that perfect Regency commode that you’ve
always wanted or a piece of Art Deco jewelry. But mixed in with the
good stuff is an abundance of overpriced junk. Now that everything’s
been discovered and designated “collectible,” the prices are often 
too high.
The Portobello Market on a busy Saturday is prime pickpocketing terri-
tory. Keep an eye or a hand on your wallet or purse.
If you want to check out the shops along Portobello Road, you may want
to visit during the week, when approximately 90 antiques and art shops
are open and the street market is closed. Weekdays are a better time for
serious collectors to shop, because they get more attention from dealers
who aren’t distracted by the throngs of shoppers.
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 245

Discovering the Best Shopping Neighborhoods
London’s two major shopping areas are Knightsbridge and the West End.
You can find some of London’s most famous and most impressive stores
along several key streets in these two areas. You also can find all the
department stores listed in the “Checking Out the Big Names” section,
earlier in this chapter.
Knightsbridge: Home of Harrods
The home of department stores Harrods and Harvey Nichols,
Knightsbridge is the second most famous of London’s retail districts.
(See the “Shopping in Knightsbridge and Chelsea” map on p. 247.)
Brompton Road (home to Harrods) runs southwest from the
Knightsbridge Tube stop. Beauchamp Place (pronounced beech-um),
one of the streets running south from Brompton Road, is only 1 block
long, but it’s full of the kinds of trendy, upscale shops where young
British aristocrats buy their clothing for “the season.” In the 1980s, the
future Princess Diana and other young bluebloods and yuppies were
dubbed “the Sloane Rangers” because this area near Sloane Square was
their favorite shopping grounds (and Range Rovers were their favorite
cars). Cheval Place, running parallel to Brompton Road to the north, is
lined with designer resale shops. Sloane Street, where you can find
plenty of fashion boutiques, runs south from the Knightsbridge Tube
stop to Sloane Square and the beginning of Chelsea.
The Map House of London (54 Beauchamp Place, SW3; % 020/7589-
4325; www.themaphouse.com; Tube: Knightsbridge) is an ideal place to
find a sophisticated souvenir, maybe an antique map, an engraving, or
an old print of London; a century-old original engraving can cost as little
as £15 ($30).
Chelsea: The young and the antique
Chelsea is famous for King’s Road (Tube: Sloane Square). This is the
area’s main street and, along with Carnaby Street, is branded in Londoner’s
minds (those over 50, that is) as the street of the Swinging Sixties. It’s
still swinging today, especially on a Saturday, when you can hardly find
room to walk. About one-third of King’s Road is devoted to antiques mar-
kets and multi-stores (large or small groups of indoor stands, stalls, and
booths within one enclosure); another third houses design trade show-
rooms and stores of household wares; and the remaining third stays
faithful to the area’s teenybopper roots. King’s Road begins on the west
side of the Sloane Square Tube stop.
A Chelsea emporium founded in 1877, Peter Jones (Sloane Square, SW1;
% 020/7730-3434; www.peterjones.co.uk; Tube: Sloane Square) is
known for household goods, household fabrics and trims, china, glass,
soft furnishings, and linens. The linen department is one of the best in
London. Lush (123 King’s Rd., SW3; www.lush.com; Tube: Sloane Square)

Shopping in Knightsbridge and Chelsea

is an aromatherapy bath and body shop where handmade soaps are cut
from blocks, like cheese, and potential gifts include fizzing bath bombs.
The other branches are in Covent Garden, Oxford Street, Kensington
High Street, and Carnaby Street. You may also want to check out the
Chelsea Antiques Market and Antiquarius. (See the “Shopping the
Street Markets” section, earlier in this chapter.)
Kensington: Street chic
You can reach Kensington, west of Knightsbridge, by taking the Tube to
High Street Kensington, the area’s preeminent shopping street. Many of
this neighborhood’s retail shops cater to street-chic teens. Several chain
stores are here as well.
Kensington Church Street, running north to Notting Hill, is one of the
city’s main shopping avenues for antiques, selling everything from
antique furniture to Impressionist paintings.
The Children’s Book Centre (237 Kensington High St., W8; % 020/
7937-7497; Tube: High Street Kensington) is the best place in London to
go for children’s books. Fiction is arranged according to age, up to 16.
The center also sells videos and toys for kids.
Holborn: Heigh-ho, Silver!
Don’t let the slightly out-of-the-way Holborn location, or the facade’s
lack of charm, put you off visiting the London Silver Vaults (Chancery
House, 53–63 Chancery Lane, WC2; % 020/7242-3844; www.thesilver
vaults.com; Tube: Chancery Lane). Downstairs are the real vaults — 
40 in all — filled with a staggering collection of old and new silver and
silver plate, plus a collection of jewelry.
The West End: More famous 
shopping streets and stores
See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250 for locations of the
West End stores that I describe in the following sections. The key shop-
ping areas in the West End are
 Piccadilly for older, established department stores
 Jermyn Street for traditional English luxury goods
 Regent Street for fancier shops and more upscale department
stores and specialty dealers
 Oxford Street for affordable shopping
 Bond Street for chic, upscale fashion boutiques
 St. Martin’s Court (between Charing Cross Road and St. Martin’s
Lane) for prints, posters, and books
 Covent Garden for all-purpose shopping, often with a hipper edge
Part IV: Exploring London 
248

Around Piccadilly Circus: A bit of everything
Many consider Piccadilly Circus the center of London. For the best shop-
ping in this area, head south from the Piccadilly Tube stop along Piccadilly
(the street) or northwest along Regent Street. The following list gives
you some of the most renowned stores around Piccadilly Circus:
 Burberry (18–22 Haymarket, SW1; % 020/7930-3343; www.
burberry.com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) sells those famous raincoats,
plus top-quality men’s shirts, sportswear, knitwear, and accessories.
 Hatchards (187 Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7439-9921; www.hatchards.
co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) was established in 1797 and is
London’s most historic and atmospheric bookstore.
 Virgin Megastore (1 Piccadilly Circus, W1; % 020/7439-2500;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is one of the largest music outlets in
Europe. This store is practically a tourist attraction in its own right.
Jermyn Street: Traditional luxury
Two-block-long Jermyn Street lies a block south of Piccadilly between
St. James’s Street and Duke Street. Many of the posh men’s haberdashers
and toiletry shops along this street have been doing business for cen-
turies and cater to the royals. They include the following shops:
 Farlows (9 Pall Mall, SW1; % 020/7839-2423; www.farlows.co.uk;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is famous for fishing and shooting equip-
ment and classic country clothing.
 Floris (89 Jermyn St., SW1; % 020/7930-2885; www.florislondon.
com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is a small, mahogany-clad store that’s
been selling its own line of soaps and perfumes since 1851.
 Hilditch & Key (73 Jermyn St., SW1; % 020/7930-5336; www.
hilditchandkey.co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) has been selling
perhaps the finest men’s shirts in the world for more than a cen-
tury. These quality goods are 100 percent cotton, cut by hand, and
sport buttons fashioned from real shell.
 Taylor of Old Bond Street (74 Jermyn St., SW1; % 020/7930-5544;
www.tayloroldbondst.co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) was estab-
lished in 1954 and is devoted to the shaving and personal hygiene
needs of men. The store offers the world’s finest collection of shav-
ing brushes, razors, and combs, plus soaps and hair lotions.
Regent Street: Upscale specialties
Regent Street begins in a grand, sweeping curve on the west side of
Piccadilly Circus and heads north to intersect with Oxford Street. This
majestic thoroughfare is lined with upscale department stores and spe-
cialty boutiques. The Burlington Arcade is a must-see if you’re in this
area. This famous glass-roofed Regency passage, running from Piccadilly
to Burlington Gardens, is lit by wrought-iron lamps and decorated with

clusters of ferns and flowers. The arcade is lined with intriguing shops
and boutiques. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250 for
locations of all the stores that I describe in this section.)
Savile Row, synonymous with hand-tailored men’s suits, lies a block
west of Regent Street. Its once-countercultural counterpart — in the
early Beatles years — is Carnaby Street, now making a comeback after
years as a depressing street of souvenir shops; Carnaby Street is a block
east of Regent Street. Royal Doulton Regent Street (154 Regent St., W1;
% 020/7734-3184; Tube: Piccadilly Circus or Oxford Circus) carries
English bone china, including Minton, Royal Crown Derby, and Royal
Doulton. (The Jan and July sales are excellent.) Scotch House (84–86
Regent St., W1; % 020/7734-0203; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is known
globally for its selection of cashmere and wool knitwear for men,
women, and children; the store also sells tartan garments and acces-
sories, as well as Scottish tweed classics.
If you’re left-handed, you’re in luck at Anything Left-Handed (57 Brewer
St., off Regent Street, W1; % 020/7437-3910; www.anythingleft-handed.
co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus). This unique store sells practical items —
everything from scissors to corkscrews — for the southpaws in the world.
Hamleys (188–196 Regent St., W1; % 020/7494-2000; www.hamleys.com;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus), the finest toy shop in the world, stocks more
than 35,000 toys and games on seven floors of fun and magic. You can
get everything, from cuddly stuffed animals and dolls to radio-controlled
cars, train sets, model kits, board games, outdoor toys, and computer
games.
Oxford Street: Affordable big names
You may want to begin your shopping adventure on Oxford Street, get-
ting out at the Oxford Circus, Bond Street, or Tottenham Court Road
Tube stop. Oxford Street is more affordable than Regent Street (which
you can read about in the preceding section) — not as grand, but offer-
ing a good variety and quantity of stylish merchandise. (See the
“Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250 for the locations of all the
stores that I describe in this section.)
If you’re a chronic organizer who can’t live without your Filofax, head
immediately for The Filofax Centre (21 Conduit St., W1; % 020/7499-
0457; www.filofax.com; Tube: Oxford Circus). At this store on Conduit
Street, which leads west from Regency Street, you can find the entire
range of inserts and books at prices that are lower than they are outside
of the United Kingdom.
The Body Shop stores are based in the United Kingdom but are now all
over the world; however, prices at the London branches are much lower.
You can stock up on their politically and environmentally correct beauty,
bath, and aromatherapy products (375 Oxford St., W1; % 020/7409-7868;
www.thebodyshop.com; Tube: Bond Street). You can find other branches
in every shopping zone in London.

252

Bond Street: Designer chic
Bond Street, running parallel to Regent Street on the west and connect-
ing Piccadilly with Oxford Street, is home to all the hot international
designers and is London’s answer to New York’s Fifth Avenue. Bond
Street is divided into New (the northern section) and Old (the southern
section). Very expensive fashion boutiques line Bond Street and the
adjacent streets. Davies Street, running south from outside the Bond
Street Tube station, is just one of the area’s choicer streets; Davies
Mews is an upscale shopping zone noted for its antiques dealers. You
can access the area from the north by the Bond Street Tube stop and
from the south by Green Park. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map
on p. 250 for the locations of the stores that I describe in this section.)
Vivienne Westwood (6 Davies St., W1; % 020/7629-3757; www.vivienne
westwood.co.uk; Tube: Bond Street) is one of the hottest British design-
ers for women. This flagship store carries a full range of jackets, skirts,
trousers, blouses, dresses, and evening dresses. Church’s (133 New Bond
St., W1; % 020/7493-1474; Tube: Bond Street) sells classy shoes easily
recognized by the fashion elite. Chocolate connoisseurs should visit
Charbonnel et Walker (1 The Royal Arcade, 28 Old Bond St., W1; % 020/
7491-0939; www.charbonnel.co.uk; Tube: Green Park), famous for its hot
chocolate (buy it by the tin) and strawberries-and-cream chocolates.
Around Leicester Square: Music and memorabilia
Leicester Square itself boasts only giant movie palaces and touristy restau-
rants (and a reduced-price ticket booth). But the streets around Leicester
Square are filled with shops selling rare books, prints, and posters, some
relating to the performing arts. (See the “Shopping in the West End” map
on p. 250 for the locations of the stores that I describe in this section.)
The Leicester Square shops include the following:
 Dress Circle (57–59 Monmouth St., WC2; % 020/7240-2227; www.
dresscircle.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square) specializes in show-
business memorabilia for all West End and Broadway shows.
 MDC Classic Music (31–32 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2; % 020/7240-
0270; www.mdcmusic.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square), sitting right
next to the English National Opera, specializes in opera recordings;
you receive expert knowledge and personal service from the staff.
 Stanfords (12–14 Long Acre, WC2; % 020/7836-1321; www.
stanfords.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square) was established in
1852, and is the world’s largest map shop (many of its maps, which
include worldwide touring and survey maps, are unavailable else-
where). Stanfords is also London’s best travel bookstore.
Charing Cross Road: A book lover’s delight
Charing Cross Road is a book lover’s paradise because of its vast
number of bookstores, selling both new and old volumes. Many of these
Chapter 12: Shopping the Local Stores 253

places sell maps and guides, too, including the tourist’s necessity,
London A–Z. Remember: no added 17.5 percent VAT charge on books.
Some of the most fascinating bookstores include the following (for loca-
tions, see the “Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250):
 Murder One (76–78 Charing Cross Rd., WC2; % 020/7734-3483;
www.murderone.co.uk; Tube: Leicester Square) specializes in
crime, romance, science fiction, and horror books. Crime and sci-
ence fiction magazines, some obscure, are also available.
 W & G Foyle, Ltd. (113–119 Charing Cross Rd., WC2; % 020/7440-
3225; www.foyles.co.uk; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) claims to
be the world’s largest bookstore, with an impressive array of hard-
covers and paperbacks, as well as travel maps, records, video-
tapes, and sheet music. Silver Moon (% 020/7440-1562), London’s
preeminent women’s dealer, operates a boutique in Foyles.
 Waterstone’s (121 Charing Cross Rd.; % 020/7434-4291;
www.waterstones.com; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) is a U.K.
chain with branches all over London. You can find the latest
releases and well-stocked sections of books currently in print.
Covent Garden: Something for everyone
Try to save some of your shopping energy for Covent Garden, home of
what may be the most famous “market” in all of England: the Covent
Garden Market. (See the “Shopping the Street Markets” section, earlier
in this chapter.)
Excellent English soaps, toiletries, and aromatherapy goods, as well as
herbal goods, are available throughout the market and surrounding
streets, including at the following shops (for locations, see the
“Shopping in the West End” map on p. 250):
 Culpeper the Herbalist (8 The Market, Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/
7379-6698; www.culpeper.co.uk; Tube: Covent Garden) sells
food, bath, and aromatherapy products, as well as dream pillows,
candles, sachets, and that popular favorite: the battery-operated
aromatherapy fan.
 Neal’s Yard Remedies (15 Neal’s Yard, off Shorts Garden, WC2; 
% 020/7379-7222; http://remedies.nealsyardremedies.com;
Tube: Covent Garden) is noted the world over for its all-natural,
herbal-based bath, beauty, and aromatherapy products in cobalt-
blue bottles.
 Penhaligon’s (41 Wellington St., WC2; % 020/7836-2150; www.
penhaligons.co.uk; Tube: Covent Garden) is an exclusive-line of
Victorian perfumery dedicated to good grooming. Choose from a
large selection of perfumes, after-shaves, soaps, candles, and bath
oils for women and men.
Part IV: Exploring London 
254

Also in Covent Garden, you can find Dr. Martens Department Store (1–4
King St., WC2; % 020/7497-1460; www.drmartens.com; Tube: Covent
Garden), the flagship for internationally famous “Doc Marts” shoes.
Prices are better here than they are in the States.
Farther along, at 14 King St., is The Irish Shop (% 020/7379-3625; Tube:
Covent Garden), which sells a wide variety of articles shipped directly
from Ireland, including colorful knitwear, traditional Irish linens, hand-
knitted Aran fisherman’s sweaters, and Celtic jewelry.
And you can finish off at The Tea House (15A Neal St., WC2; % 020/
7240-7539; Tube: Covent Garden), which sells everything associated
with tea, tea drinking, and teatime.

Chapter 13
Following an Itinerary: 
Four Great Options
In This Chapter
 Seeing London on a reasonable schedule
 Planning fun itineraries for trips lasting three to seven days
 Visiting London with kids
E
very London visitor has to face one problem: how to see as much 
as possible in a limited amount of time. You’re lucky if you have an
entire week or more. But what if you have only three or five days at your
disposal? What if you’re bringing the family along? These questions are
what this chapter is all about. If you budget your time wisely and choose
your sights carefully, you can make the most of a limited schedule or a
trip with the kids.
This chapter offers four easy-to-do suggested daily itineraries. The first
itinerary covers the big sights. The next two are a little more adventur-
ous. The itinerary for families first addresses the top spots and then
heads to family-friendly destinations just outside the city.
For complete descriptions of the sights, plus exact street addresses,
open hours, and admission prices, see Chapter 11, unless I give you a
different chapter to check out.
London in Three Days
Three days doesn’t seem like a very long time. But in that short period,
you can hit most of the key sights in London for a memorable trip.
Start Day 1 with a visit to majestic Westminster Abbey, visiting the
Royal Tombs and Poets’ Corner. Afterward, because they’re right next
door, stroll around the Houses of Parliament. Unless you queue up to
hear a debate or take one of the guided tours, available from August
through September, you won’t be able to get inside, but you can enjoy
a great riverside view from Westminster Bridge. On the opposite side
of the Thames is the British Airways London Eye, a 450-foot-high

observation wheel. Reserve in advance for the trip up and over London;
otherwise, you may spend at least a half-hour in line for a ticket and
another hour before your scheduled “flight.” You’re not far from Tate
Britain, so if you’re in the mood to look at great English art, head over to
Pimlico. Renting a self-guided audio tour is a great way to enhance your
appreciation of the museum. Later in the afternoon, explore Piccadilly
Circus, the teeming epicenter of London’s West End. You find great shop-
ping on Regent Street, Piccadilly, and Jermyn Street (see Chapter 12 for
shopping). If you haven’t already reserved a seat for a West End show,
you may want to stop by the half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square
to see what’s available (see Chapter 15 for info on theaters). Have dinner 
in Soho before the show (see Chapter 10 for restaurants).
Greet Day 2 with a walk through Green Park. You’re on your way to
Buckingham Palace to witness the pageantry of the Changing of the
Guard (check beforehand to make sure that it’s taking place that day). 
If you’re visiting during August or September, you can tour the State
Rooms of Buckingham Palace. Reserve tickets in advance, so you know
your specific entry time; otherwise, you may have to wait in line for an
hour or more to get in. If you’re not touring the palace itself, visit the
Royal Mews. From Buckingham Palace, you can stroll down the Mall,
through St. James’s Park, passing Clarence House, where the Queen
Mother lived until her death in 2002, and St. James’s Palace, once the
London home of Prince Charles and his two sons, William and Harry.
Trafalgar Square, London’s grandest and certainly most famous plaza,
is your next stop. You can have lunch or tea at the National Gallery’s
restaurant or at Café-in-the-Crypt in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church on
the east side of the square (see Chapter 10 for more on these restau-
rants). Spend your afternoon viewing the treasures of the National
Gallery. Renting one of the self-guided audio tours will help you to home
in on the most important paintings in the collection. After dinner in the
Covent Garden area or on a Thames River cruise, head to one of the
bars, pubs, or clubs that I describe in Chapter 16.
On Day 3, arrive as early as you can at the Tower of London and imme-
diately join one of the one-hour guided tours led by the Beefeaters.
Later, you can explore the precincts on your own, making certain you
allot enough time to see the Crown Jewels. From the Tower, head over
to nearby St. Paul’s Cathedral, which you can see in about a half-hour.
The British Museum, your next stop, has enough to keep you occupied
for several days; if you want to see only the highlights, allow yourself 
a minimum of two hours. Finish off your afternoon in Knightsbridge at
Harrods (see Chapter 12), the most famous department store in London
and, perhaps, the world. Knightsbridge and adjacent South Kensington
offer innumerable dining options (see Chapter 10).
Part IV: Exploring London 
258

London in Five Days
This section assumes that you’ve already followed the suggested itiner-
aries for your first three days (see the preceding section).
Day 4 begins at the National Portrait Gallery, where you can find the
likeness of just about every famous British person you’ve ever heard 
of. Renting one of the self-guided audio tours is a good idea. From the
portrait gallery, you can easily walk to Covent Garden Market (see
Chapter 12). Scores of interesting shops are in and around the market,
and Covent Garden Piazza, a lively hub filled with restaurants, makes 
a perfect spot for lunch. Spend your afternoon strolling in Kensington
Gardens and visiting Kensington Palace, once the London home of
Princess Diana. Then go for a traditional English dinner at Rules,
London’s oldest restaurant, or Simpson’s-in-the-Strand (see Chapter 10).
Are you up for a play or a concert tonight? If so, check your theater
options in Chapter 15.
Day 5 begins with a morning at the museum of your choice. Choosing
among the three major South Kensington museums — the Natural
History Museum, the Science Museum, and the Victoria & Albert
Museum — is entirely a matter of taste. If you like modern art, the new
Tate Modern on the South Bank is the place to spend your morning. In
the afternoon, expand your horizon with a short trip outside the city.
The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, Hampton Court, Windsor Palace,
Hampstead Heath, and Greenwich aren’t terribly far away; the trips to
reach them take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. You can be back
in London in time for dinner.
London in Seven Days
How time flies! By now, if you follow the suggested itineraries for the last
five days (see the preceding two sections), you’ve seen most of the
major sights in London.
On Day 6, you’re ready for a day trip. Riding in one of Britain’s sleek new
trains is terrific fun. The only problem is that you have to decide where
you want to go. In Chapter 14, I give you the lowdown on six places, each
remarkable in its own way. Do you want to see Shakespeare’s birthplace
in Stratford-upon-Avon or the famous prehistoric stone circle called
Stonehenge? Do you want to spend a day by the seaside in Brighton or
strolling around ancient Canterbury with its mighty cathedral? Perhaps
you want to head to Bath to discover its splendid Georgian crescents, or
York to explore the venerable York Minster. You can reach most of these
places in 90 minutes or less.
Day 7 is your last day in London, and you’ll want it to be special. In the
morning, visit Madame Tussaud’s wax museum or one of the museums
that you haven’t yet seen. Afterward, stroll through Hyde Park and stop
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 259

at Apsley House, the London home of the first duke of Wellington. This
house gives you a glimpse of what life was like inside one of London’s
great private palaces. If it’s Sunday, you may instead want to visit
Spencer House, the family home of the late Princess Diana. You can also
do some last-minute shopping, if you prefer. Check out London’s various
shopping neighborhoods in Chapter 12, and then make your way to the
major shopping arteries: Knightsbridge, Oxford Street, Bond Street,
King’s Road in Chelsea, or Regent Street. A traditional afternoon tea at
one of London’s great hotels (see Chapter 10) makes a delightful end to
the afternoon. After that? You’ve booked theater tickets, haven’t you?
London with Kids
So you want to spend five days in London and bring along your kids? No
problem. I have a few suggestions to keep you and your kids excited and
entertained. (For tips on traveling with kids, see Chapter 6.)
Don’t schedule too much on Day 1. Exercise helps ward off jet lag. 
After sitting in a plane for several hours, the best option may be to take
smaller children to one of London’s great parks, so they can run and let
off steam. Depending on where your hotel is located, your destination
may be Hyde Park, Kensington Gardens, Green Park, St. James’s Park,
or Regent’s Park. If you’re traveling with teens, you may want to intro-
duce them to the city by taking a stroll through London’s four royal
parks, following the Princess Diana Commemorative Walk (see p. 102).
You can begin more focused sightseeing on Day 2. Consider a guided
bus tour that helps orient everyone and gives you at least a glimpse 
of all the major sights. Several outfits provide tours on double-decker
buses — always a treat for kids — and one company offers a wonderful
road and river trip on amphibious vehicles. After the tour, make the
British Airways London Eye your first stop. Reserve your ticket before-
hand to avoid waiting in a long line. Afterward, cross Westminster Bridge
and stroll over to view the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben (if you’re
lucky, the clock will strike the hour while you’re in the vicinity). And
because it’s close at hand, use this opportunity to visit Westminster
Abbey. Younger children may not get much out of the place, but you
will. Later in the afternoon, take a boat ride down the Thames to the
Tower of London; you can board the boat at Westminster Pier near 
the Houses of Parliament. When you’re inside the Tower, hook up with
one of the Beefeater tours. If you’re with a kid ages 10 to 17, you may
want to have dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe in Mayfair (see Chapter 10).
Begin Day 3 at the Natural History Museum in South Kensington, 
where the dinosaur exhibit with a ferocious animatronic T. rex captures
the imaginations of both young and old(er). If your child’s a budding
Einstein, the Science Museum with its many hands-on, interactive
exhibits may be a better choice. Afterward, if you have small children in
tow, stroll over to Kensington Gardens for a look at the famous statue of
Part IV: Exploring London 
260

Peter Pan. The new Princess Diana Memorial Playground in the north-
west corner of Kensington Gardens enchants little ones. You can have
lunch in The Orangery of adjacent Kensington Palace or make your way
to Café-in-the-Crypt (see Chapter 10) in St. Martin-in-the-Fields church in
Trafalgar Square; you find a brass-rubbing center in the church, too. If
you’re with a teen, you may want to spend the morning or afternoon in
Madame Tussaud’s wax museum or the London Dungeon; just keep in
mind that young children may find some of the gorier exhibits frighten-
ing. In the evening, older kids and teens may also enjoy one of the West
End’s razzmatazz musicals. If dinner and a play for just the grown-ups
sounds good, you can get a baby sitter for the little ones (see the Quick
Concierge, at the end of this book, for a reputable service).
Chapter 13: Following an Itinerary: Four Great Options 261
Organizing your time
You can make the most of your visit to London if you organize your days efficiently and
with common sense. Disorganized travelers waste a lot of time, show up at the
museum on the day it’s closed, and end up in the nether regions of Tooting Bec
because they hopped on the wrong Underground line. Don’t assume that every
museum or site is open every day, all day. Take a moment to look at the details that I
provide for each attraction in Chapter 11. And carry a copy of London A–Z.
An average top sight takes about two hours to visit, after you’re actually inside. Some
(Buckingham Palace and the Royal Mews) take more; others (Westminster Abbey and
St. Paul’s) take less. But other variables enter in: whether you’re taking a guided tour
(usually about an hour to an hour and a half, no matter where), whether you have kids
in tow, or whether lines move slowly due to the crowds of visitors. Predicting how
much time you’ll spend at a major attraction, such as the British Museum and the
National Gallery, is difficult. But as a general rule, you can do about three or four sights
in a day if you’re pushing yourself, fewer if you’re not.
Many of London’s major sights are concentrated in specific areas, so walking is the
best way to see several sights in a short period of time. To cover larger areas, I rec-
ommend that you take the fast and convenient Underground.
Try to hit the very top sights on your list early in the day, preferably when they open,
or late in the afternoon. Visit the places that are really important to you when you’re
feeling fresh and when they’re less crowded. I mean, in particular, Buckingham Palace
(when it’s open to the public during Aug and Sept), the Tower of London, Westminster
Abbey, and Madame Tussaud’s. Westminster Abbey, to cite just one example, can
receive upwards of 15,000 visitors per day!
Unless you have adrenaline to spare, try to unwind a little before you begin your round
of after-dark diversions. You may need some downtime between the end of your sight-
seeing day and the beginning of your evening activities. I suggest that you head back
to your hotel to take a shower or bath, to curl up with a novel or the evening paper for
an hour, or maybe to catch a quick snooze to recharge your batteries. Then it’s back
to those perennially fascinating London streets.

Make Day 4 a day trip to Brighton on the Sussex coast (see Chapter 14).
The quick trip takes less than an hour. After you arrive, you can visit the
Royal Pavilion and take the kids over to Palace Pier, a spot filled with
games and souvenir stands. If the weather’s warm, you can rent a deck
chair and sit on the beach. Brighton is a fun place just to stroll around,
with plenty to keep you and the family entertained.
On Day 5, head out to Hampton Court Palace, another quick train ride of
less than an hour. Hampton Court offers much to explore, so give your-
self at least four hours. Small children may not get much out of the visit,
but they’ll probably be intrigued by the staff wearing period costumes.
You can eat on the premises. Save the best part for last: The famous maze
in the gardens brings out the kid in everyone. Finally, return to London
for a good night’s rest before flying out the next morning.

Chapter 14
Going Beyond London: 
Six Great Day Trips
In This Chapter
 Taking the best day trips from London
 Getting there and back
 Deciding what to see and do after you arrive
 Choosing where to eat and where to stay
E
ngland is a relatively small country. You can visit countless places
on one-day side trips from London.
In Chapter 11, I describe the easiest side trips from London: Kew
Gardens, Hampton Court Palace, Windsor Palace, and Greenwich.
In this chapter, I venture out to some of England’s most popular, 
impressive, and famous places: Bath, Brighton, Canterbury, Stratford-
upon-Avon, Stonehenge, and York. By train, you can get to all these sites
in two hours or less from London (see the “Day Trips from London” map
on p. 264).
By Train or by Car: Weighing the Options
Because of England’s small size and easy-access train and road net-
works, this country is a joy to explore.
For all the trips in this chapter, I’d recommend that you take the train
instead of renting and driving a car. From London, you can reach Bath,
Brighton, and Canterbury in 90 minutes or less by train. The train trip 
to Stratford-upon-Avon or to Salisbury (the closest large town to
Stonehenge) takes about two hours. A trip to York will take about 
two hours. At each of these places, the attractions are within walking
distance of the train station. The one exception is Stonehenge, which
you can reach by public bus from Salisbury. If you get an early start, 
you can explore any one of these places, have lunch, and still get back 
to London in time for dinner.

Day Trips from London
Part IV: Exploring London 
264

The following sections help you decide whether train travel or auto-
motion is for you.
Taking the train
If you plan to travel around England by train, get a BritRail pass before
you arrive (they’re not available in the U.K.) from Rail Europe (% 877/
272-7245 in the U.S. or 800/361-7245 in Canada; www.raileurope.com).
Rail Europe only sells to North Americans and quotes prices in U.S. dol-
lars. You cannot buy Rail Europe passes outside of North America. The
London Plus Pass gets you to three of the towns in this chapter —
Brighton, Canterbury, and Salisbury (plus Windsor, which you can read
about in Chapter 11) — but not to Bath, Stratford-upon-Avon, or York.
Trains offer first-class and standard-class seating — first-class cars are
less crowded, and the seats are roomier and more comfy. Because the
train trips to the destinations in this chapter aren’t very long, standard-
class may be fine for most travelers. For 2 days of travel in an 8-day
period, the pass costs $113 first class, $74 standard class; for 4 days in
an 8-day period, it costs $187 first class, $140 standard class; and for 7
days of travel in a 15-day period, it costs $249 first class, $187 standard
class. See Rail Europe’s Web site for more information on the London
Plus and other BritRail passes.
National train schedules, routes, and fares can be found online at www.
nationalrail.co.uk, or by calling % 0845/484-950.
Taking a car: Driving on the left, passing on the right
I always suggest that people visiting London travel by train instead of
driving. Much of your car trip will be on motorways without much
scenery, so what’s the point? Then, when you arrive, you have to find
parking (generally outside the historic city center); if you arrive by train,
however, you can easily walk to the center of town from the train station
(or take a cab if you have mobility issues). The historic towns of England
are compact and centralized — you won’t necessarily need a car to get
from point A to point B.
Before you even consider renting a car, ask yourself whether you’re 
comfortable driving with a steering wheel on the right-hand side of the
vehicle while shifting with your left hand (you can get an automatic, but
it costs considerably more). Remember: You must drive on the left and
pass on the right.
Although the car rental market in Britain is highly competitive, renting 
a car here costs more than back home — unless you can find a special
promotional offer from an airline or a car rental agency. Most U.K. car
rental agencies accept valid foreign driver’s licenses. In most cases, you
must be 23 years old (21 in some instances), no older than 70, and have
had your driver’s license for more than a year.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 265

You can often get a discount on car rental rates if you reserve 48 hours
in advance through the toll-free reservations offices. Weekly rentals are
almost always less expensive than daily rates. And the rate, of course,
depends on the size of the vehicle.
When you make your reservation, ask whether the quoted price includes
the 17.5 percent VAT and unlimited mileage. Then find out whether 
personal accident insurance (PAI), collision-damage waiver (CDW), 
and any other insurance options are included. If they aren’t a part of 
the deal, which they usually aren’t, be sure to ask how much they cost.
When you drive in any foreign country (or anywhere, for that matter),
arrange for as much coverage as possible.
Some credit card companies offer the collision-damage waiver and other
types of insurance for free if you use that card to pay for the rental. If
you’re planning to rent a car, check with your credit card company 
to see what’s covered, or you may end up paying for coverage you
already have.
Bath: Hot Mineral Springs and 
Cool Georgian Magnificence
Bath, 185km (115 miles) west of London, is a beautiful spa town on 
the Avon River (see the “Bath” map on p. 267). Since the days of the
ancient Celts — and later the Romans — Bath has been famous for its
hot mineral springs. In 1702, Queen Anne frequented the soothing, sul-
furous waters and transformed Bath into a spa for the elite. Aristocrats,
socialites, social climbers, and flamboyant dandies, such as Beau Nash,
have added to the spa’s fashionable and fascinating history. The great
author Jane Austen used Bath as an upwardly genteel setting for her
class-conscious plots.
Today, the spa is a grand legacy from the Georgian era, graced with
beautiful curving crescents (a row of houses built in a long curving line)
and classically inspired buildings of honey-colored stone. Must-sees are
the Roman Baths Museum and adjoining Pump Room (where visitors
can continue the long tradition of sipping water while listening to
music), the adjacent Abbey, and the Assembly Rooms (once used for
balls and gaming).
Getting there
Trains for Bath leave from London’s Paddington Station every hour; 
the trip takes about 90 minutes. The standard return (round-trip) fare
costs £35 ($70). For schedules, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk, or call
% 0845/484-950. By car, take the M4 to Junction 18 and then drive a few
miles south on A46.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 267

Finding information and taking a tour
Bath’s Tourist Information Centre (% 01225/477-761; www.visitbath.
co.uk), located in the center of town on the square in front of Bath
Abbey, is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m.
in the summer) and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The Centre provides free
guided walks that leave from outside the Pump Room Sunday through
Friday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. and Saturday at 10:30 a.m. Additional
walks are offered at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday from May
through September.
One-hour, open-top bus tours with audio commentary are presented by
City Sightseeing (% 01871/666-0000) at a cost of £10 ($20) for adults,
£8 ($16) for seniors and students, and £4.50 ($9) for children. Tours
depart from the bus station every 15 minutes in summer; otherwise,
they leave hourly. Tickets are valid all day, and you can get off and on to
explore places along the route.
Seeing the sights
The Romans — who arrived in A.D. 75 — built the huge bath-and-temple
complex at the center of the Roman Baths Museum (% 01225/477-785;
www.romanbaths.co.uk) beside Bath Abbey. When visitors enter, they
receive a portable self-guided audio tour keyed to everything on display,
including the original Roman baths and heating system; the audio tour is
fun, informative, and very well done. Admission costs £11 ($22) for adults,
with discounts for seniors, students, children, and families. The museum
is open daily March through June, September, and October 9 a.m. to 
5 p.m.; July and August 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; January through February and
November through December 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (closed Dec 25–26).
Overlooking the Roman baths is the late-18th-century Pump Room 
(% 01225/477-7785), where the fashionable assembled to sip the reput-
edly health-promoting water. You’re welcome to taste it for yourself (your
ticket to the Roman Baths Museum entitles you to one free glass of mineral
water in the Pump Room). Admission is free. In the Pump Room, you can
enjoy elevenses (morning tea), lunch, or afternoon tea to a background of
live music. Main courses cost £11 to £15 ($22–$30); afternoon tea goes for
£16 ($32). The Pump Room is open Monday through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m. (until 10 p.m. July–Aug) and Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Step inside Bath Abbey (% 01225/422-462; www.bathabbey.org) and
view the graceful fan vaulting, the great East Window, and the ironically
simple memorial to Beau Nash, the most flamboyant of the dandies who
frequented Bath in its heyday. Admission is by a suggested donation of
£2.50 ($5). April through October, the abbey is open Monday through
Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (to 4:30 p.m. Nov–Mar); year-round, it’s open
Sunday 1 to 2:30 p.m. and 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.
Another classic building worth visiting is the Assembly Rooms (Bennett
Street; % 01225/477-789), the site of all the grand balls and social climb-
ing in 18th-century Bath. Entrance is free unless you want to visit the
Part IV: Exploring London 
268

excellent Fashion Museum (% 01225/477-173; www.fashionmuseum.
co.uk) that is part of the complex. Admission for the museum costs
£6.75 ($14) adults; £5.75 ($12) seniors, students, and children 6 to 18. The
museum is open daily 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. (to 5 p.m. Mar–Oct); the Assembly
Rooms are open when not in use.
Bath’s newest attraction, the Jane Austen Centre (40 Gay St.; % 01225/
443-000; www.janeausten.co.uk), is located in a Georgian town house
on an elegant street where Austen once lived. Exhibits and a video
convey a sense of what life in Bath was like during the Regency period;
all in all, though, this museum is a bit of a bore to all but the most avid
Austen fans. Admission costs £6.50 ($13). The center is open daily 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.). Afternoon tea is served in the
Regency tearooms for £6.95 ($14).
Bath is a wonderful walking town, filled with beautiful squares and sweep-
ing residential crescents. Stroll along the North Parade and the South
Parade, Queen Square, and The Circus and be sure to have a look at the
Royal Crescent, a magnificent, curving row of 30 town houses designed 
in 1767 by John Wood the Younger. Regarded as the epitome of England’s
Palladian style (a classical style incorporating elements from ancient
Greek and Roman buildings), the Royal Crescent is now designated a
UNESCO World Heritage site. No. 1 Royal Crescent (% 01225/428-126) 
is a gorgeously restored 18th-century house with period furnishings.
Admission costs £5 ($10). The house is open mid-February through
October, Tuesday through Sunday 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (to 4 p.m. in Nov).
Pulteney Bridge, built in 1770, spans the River Avon a few blocks south
of the Assembly Rooms. The bridge is one of the few in Europe lined
with shops and restaurants.
Dining locally
A popular French eatery in Bath’s city center is No. 5 Bistro (5 Argyle
St.; % 01225/444-499). The chef at this pleasant restaurant produces
mouth-watering dishes that may include baked ricotta with olive,
spinach, and sun-dried tomato soufflé; Provençal fish soup; pan-fried
pepper steak; or vegetarian dishes, such as roasted stuffed peppers and
vegetable gratin. Main courses cost £14 to £17 ($28–$34). The bistro,
open daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6:30 to 10:30 p.m., accepts American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa.
Spending the night
If you want to spend the night in Bath, try the Kennard Hotel
(11 Henrietta St.; % 01225/310-472; fax: 01225/460-054; www.kennard.
co.uk). On the east side of Pulteney Bridge, within walking distance of
everything in Bath, this elegant hotel with 13 guest rooms occupies a
beautifully restored 1794 Georgian town house. The rates are £98 to £118
($196–$236) for a double, breakfast included. The hotel accepts
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 269

Brighton: Fun beside the Seaside
On the Sussex coast, a mere 80km (50 miles) south of London, Brighton
is England’s most famous, and probably most popular, seaside town 
(see the “Brighton” map on p. 271). Brighton was a small fishing village
until the Prince Regent, who would become George IV, became enam-
ored with the place and had the incredible Royal Pavilion built. Where
royalty moves, fashion follows, and Brighton eventually became one of
Europe’s most fashionable towns. The lovely Georgian terraces that you
see everywhere date from this period. Later in the 19th century, when
breathing sea air was prescribed as a cure-all for everything from
depression to tuberculosis, the Victorians descended in hordes. Today,
Brighton is a commuter suburb of London and a popular place for con-
ventions and romantic weekend getaways. Gays and lesbians are very
much a part of the local and visitor scene.
Brighton is a compact town, and the easiest way to get around is on foot.
Forget about that frantic need for sightseeing and relax. Relaxation is what
Brighton is all about. This place is for leisurely strolling, either in the town
or along the seaside promenades. The town is small enough so you won’t
get lost and large enough to offer some good cultural diversions.
Getting there
More than 40 trains a day leave from London’s Victoria Station for
Brighton. The trip takes about an hour. If you travel off-peak (after 9:30
a.m.), a cheap day-return (round-trip) ticket costs about £18 ($36). For
schedules, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk, or call % 0845/484-950.
If you’re driving, the M23 from Central London leads to Brighton. The
drive typically takes about an hour, but if roads are clogged, it may take
twice as long.
Finding information
Brighton’s Visitor Information Centre (Royal Pavilion Shop, 4–5 Pavilion
Buildings; % 0906/711-2255; www.visitbrighton.com), in the Royal
Pavilion, is about a ten-minute walk south from the train station. The
center is a good place to pick up info on current events and a Gay
Information Sheet listing gay guesthouses, pubs, and clubs. If you fall in
love with Brighton and decide to stay overnight, you can reserve a room
through this office. The center is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Seeing the sights
Brighton’s one must-see attraction is the Royal Pavilion (% 01273/
290-900; www.royalpavilion.org.uk), set in a small landscaped park
bounded by North Street, Church Street, Olde Steine, and New Road. The
pavilion is one of the most extraordinary palaces in Europe. John Nash
redesigned the original farmhouse and villa on this site for George IV
(when the king was still Prince Regent), who lived here with his mis-
tress, Lady Conyngham, until 1827.

Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 271
The exterior, as crazily wonderful as anything King Ludwig of Bavaria
dreamed up, is an Indian fantasy of turrets and minarets. The interior,
decorated in a Chinese style, is fantastically extravagant. The king’s
brother, William IV, and Queen Victoria later used the pavilion.
Admission, which includes an audio guide, costs £7.70 ($15) adults,
£5.10 ($10) seniors and students, £5.90 ($12) children under 16, and £21
($42) for families (two adults and two children). The pavilion is open
daily October through May 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and June through
September 9:30 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.
Before you leave the pavilion, consider having lunch or a cream tea (tea
and scones served with clotted cream and strawberry preserves) in the
restored Queen Adelaide Tea Room (% 01723/292-736), open daily
10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. (to 5 p.m. in summer). Queen Adelaide, who used
this suite in 1830, didn’t appreciate the epicurean tastes of her husband,
George IV. Dismissing his renowned French chefs, she reverted back to

British cuisine so dreary that Lord Dudley complained “you now get
cold pâté and hot champagne.” The lunch selections and cream teas
range from £7 to £13 ($14–$26).
Close to the Royal Pavilion, on Church Street, you find the small
Brighton Museum & Art Gallery (% 01273/292-882), with some inter-
esting collections of Art Nouveau and Art Deco furniture, glass, and
ceramics, plus a Fashion Gallery. Reopened in 2002 after a major refur-
bishment, it’s a good place to wile away an hour. Admission is free, and
it’s open Tuesday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., Wednesday through Saturday from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday 2 to 5 p.m. (closed Dec 24–26 and Jan 1).
The town’s famous amusement area, Palace Pier, jutting out into the sea
just south of the Royal Pavilion, was built in the late 19th century. Today
the pier is rather tacky but worth visiting nonetheless. At night, all lit up
with twinkling lights, this place is almost irresistible. Spend half an hour,
but don’t expect to find much more than junk food, kiddie rides, and
arcade games. The more famous West Pier, now over 130 years old and
gradually sinking into the sea, isn’t open to the public.
Brighton and neighboring Hove stretch out along the English Channel.
The entire seafront is a pebbly public beach used for swimming and 
sunning. Promenades for strolling are all along the seafront. If you’re 
into sunbathing au naturel, Brighton has the only nude beach in England,
about a mile west of Brighton Pier. You’ll recognize it when you get there.
Dining locally
One of the hippest (and friendliest) places for dining is the bow-fronted
Strand Restaurant (6 Little East St.; % 01273/747-096; www.thestrand
brighton.co.uk), which serves Modern British cuisine with an empha-
sis on fish. The ever-changing menu may include herby homemade 
vegetable soup, followed by chicken breast with creamy mushrooms;
homemade fish cakes; or basil, leek, and parmesan risotto. Main courses
cost £8 to £10 ($16–$20). The restaurant is open Monday and Tuesday 6
p.m. to midnight, Wednesday through Saturday noon to midnight. It
accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
For a new outlook on vegetarian food, try Terre à Terre (71 East St.; 
% 01273/729-051; www.terreaterre.co.uk). Considered the best veg-
etarian restaurant in England, perhaps in all Europe, this place elevates
meatless cuisine to an art form. The food is impeccably fresh and beauti-
fully presented. You can eat your way through the menu with the Terre à
Tapas, a superb selection of all their best dishes, big enough for two.
Main courses cost £13 to £15 ($26–$30). The restaurant is open Tuesday
6:30 to 10:30 p.m., and Wednesday through Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m.
Reservations are essential on weekends. The restaurant accepts Diners
Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
Part IV: Exploring London 
272

Spending the night
A sophisticated new addition to Brighton’s hotel scene, the ultrastylish
Hotel du Vin & Bistro (Ship Street; % 01273/718-588; fax: 01273/
718-599; www.hotelduvin.com) occupies a set of Mock Tudor and
Gothic Revival buildings a stone’s throw from the seafront. This is
Brighton’s most unique contemporary hotel, with an impressive three-
story lobby, a signature French bistro, and 37 cool, uncluttered, and very
comfortable bedrooms featuring marvelous beds with fine Egyptian
linens, deep soaker tubs, and power showers. Rack rates for a double
room with breakfast range from £145 to £250 ($290–$500). The hotel
accepts all major credit cards.
Canterbury: Tales from the Great Cathedral
Magnificent Canterbury Cathedral is one of the glories of England. For
nearly 400 years, the devout, in search of miracles, salvation, and a bit 
of adventure, trekked to the cathedral’s shrine of Thomas à Becket,
Archbishop of Canterbury, who was murdered in 1170 by henchmen 
of Henry II. Along the way, they spun the yarns found in Chaucer’s The
Canterbury Tales. (The pilgrims didn’t stop coming until Henry VIII had 
the shrine destroyed in 1538.) Modern pilgrims, today called day-trippers,
continue to pour into the Kentish city of Canterbury on the River Stour,
100km (62 miles) east of London (see “Canterbury” map on p. 274). They
come to see the cathedral, of course, but also to visit the host of small
museums and to enjoy the picturesque town surrounding it.
Getting there
Canterbury has two train stations, Canterbury East and Canterbury West,
and you can easily walk to the city center from either one. From London’s
Victoria Station, trains run about every half-hour to Canterbury East.
Hourly trains from London’s Charing Cross stop at Canterbury West. The
journey takes 90 minutes and costs about £18 ($36) for a cheap day-return
(round-trip) ticket. For schedules, go to www.nationalrail.co.uk, or
call % 0845/484-950. To drive from London, take the A2 and then the
M2; Canterbury is signposted all the way. The city center is closed to
cars, but several parking areas are close to the cathedral.
Finding information and taking a tour
The Visitors Information Centre (12–13 Sun St.; % 01227/378100;
www.canterbury.co.uk), opposite Christchurch Gate at the entrance to
the cathedral precincts, is open Easter through October, Monday through
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; the rest of the
year, the center is open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. At the
Centre, you can buy tickets for daily guided-tour walks of the city and
cathedral at 2 p.m. (additional walks in July and Aug, Mon–Sat 11:30 a.m.).
The tour costs £4.50 ($9) adults, £4 ($8) seniors and students, £3 ($6) for
children under 12, and £15 ($30) families (two adults and two children).

Canterbury Historic River Tours (Weavers House, 1 St. Peter’s St.; 
% 07790/534-744; www.canterburyrivertours.co.uk) offers half-
hour boat trips on the Stour River with a commentary on the history of
the buildings that you pass. April through September, river conditions
permitting, boats depart daily every 15 to 20 minutes from 10 a.m. to 
5 p.m. Tickets cost £6 ($12) adults, £5 ($10) seniors and students, £4 
($8) children, and £17 ($34) for families (two adults and two children).
Umbrellas are available in case of rain. The boats leave from behind the
15th-century Weavers House (access via the Weavers restaurant garden).
Seeing the sights
Make your first stop the imposing Canterbury Cathedral (11 The
Precincts; % 01227/762-862; www.canterbury-cathedral.org), a
magnificent structure that was the first major expression of the Gothic
style in England. The crypt dates from about 1100, and the cathedral
itself (rebuilt after a fire) dates from the 13th century, with a bell tower
added in the 15th century.

Although Henry VIII destroyed Becket’s shrine, its site is still marked in
the Trinity Chapel near the high altar. Noteworthy features of the cathe-
dral include a number of panels of rare stained glass and the medieval
royal tombs of Henry IV and Edward the Black Prince. Admission costs
£6.50 ($13) adults; £5 ($10) seniors, students, and children. The cathe-
dral is open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in
summer), and Sunday 12:30 to 4:30 p.m.; closed to sightseeing during
services.
As you stroll the cathedral grounds, you may encounter flocks of well-
behaved boys and girls wearing blazers and ties: They attend King’s
School, the oldest public school in England, housed in several fine
medieval buildings north of the cathedral.
Off High Street, near the cathedral, is the entertaining exhibition known
as The Canterbury Tales (23 St. Margaret’s St.; % 01227/454-888; www.
canterburytales.org.uk), where the pilgrimages of Chaucerian
England are re-created in tableaux. On audio headsets, you can hear five
of Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales and the story of the murder of St. Thomas
à Becket. Give yourself 45 minutes to an hour to see and hear the entire
show. Admission costs £7.50 ($15) adults, £6.50 ($13) seniors and stu-
dents, £5.50 ($11) children 5 to 15. The attraction is open daily 10 a.m. 
to 4:30 p.m. (9:30 a.m.–5 p.m. in summer).
Two millennia ago, the conquering Romans were living in Canterbury,
which they called Cantuaria. Their daily lives are chronicled in the small
but fascinating Roman Museum (% 01227/785-575), in the excavated
Roman levels of the city between the cathedral and High Street on
Butchery Lane. Admission costs £3.10 ($6.20) adults; £1.90 ($3.80) sen-
iors, students, and children. The museum is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (also Sun 1:30–5 p.m. June–Oct).
Although the cathedral gets the lion’s share of attention in Canterbury,
another Christian site predates it by about 600 years. Set in a spacious
park, about a ten-minute walk east from the center of town, you find 
the atmospheric ruins of St. Augustine’s Abbey (Longport; % 01227/
767-345), founded in A.D. 598 and one of the oldest Anglo-Saxon monastic
sites in the country. This UNESCO World Heritage site offers interactive
audio tours. Admission costs £4 ($8) adults, £3 ($6) seniors and 
students, and £2 ($4) children. The site is open April through June
Wednesday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; July and August daily 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; September through March Sundays 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Trek another five minutes east from St. Augustine’s Abbey to visit the
oldest parish church in England. St. Martin’s Church (North Holmes
Road; % 01227/459-482), founded by Queen Bertha (the French wife of
Saxon King Ethelbert), was already in existence when Augustine arrived
from Rome to convert the natives in A.D. 597. Admission is free, and the
church is open daily 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 275

Dining locally
One of the best dining spots in Canterbury is Michael Caines Restaurant,
located in the newly refurbished Abode (High Street; % 01227/766-266).
You can choose from a selection of simple but imaginatively conceived
dishes and seasonal specialties. Reservations are recommended. Main
courses go for £14 to £20 ($28–$40). You can dine on more traditional pub
fare in the Tavern, where prices run from £8 to £15 ($16–$30).The restau-
rant accepts American Express, Diners Club, MasterCard, and Visa. It’s
open daily for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Spending the night
If you’re planning an overnight stay in Canterbury and want, like the pil-
grims of yore, to stay near the cathedral, you can’t get any closer than the
Cathedral Gate Hotel (36 Burgate; % 01227/464-381; fax: 01227/462-800;
www.cathgate.co.uk). Dating from 1438, the 27-room hotel adjoins
Christchurch Gate and overlooks the Buttermarket. The guest rooms are
comfortable and modestly furnished, with sloping floors, massive oak
beams, and winding corridors — what else would you expect from a hotel
built more than 500 years ago? With the cheapest rooms, you’ll be sharing
a bathroom. Rates are £40 to £98 ($80–$196) for a double, continental
breakfast included. The hotel accepts American Express, Diners Club,
MasterCard, and Visa.
Stratford-upon-Avon: In the 
Footsteps of the Bard
Stratford-upon-Avon (see the “Stratford-upon-Avon” map on p. 277) is 
a shrine to the world’s greatest playwright, William Shakespeare, who
was born, lived much of his life, and is buried in this market town on the
Avon River, 146km (91 miles) northwest of London. In summer, crowds
of international tourists overrun Stratford, which aggressively hustles its
Shakespeare connection.
Stratford is comprised of many Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings, but
it’s not really a quaint village anymore. If you’re arriving by train, your
first glimpse will be of a vast parking lot across from the station. Don’t
let this sight put you off. The charms of Stratford haven’t been com-
pletely lost — it still has lots of lovely corners to discover. Besides the
literary pilgrimage sights, the top draw in Stratford is the Royal
Shakespeare Theatre, where Britain’s foremost actors perform.
Getting there
Direct trains leave frequently from London’s Paddington Station; the
journey takes two hours and costs £25 ($50) for a standard-class off-peak
(after 9:30 a.m.) round-trip ticket. For schedules, go to www.national
rail.co.uk, or call % 0845/484-950. To drive from London, take the
M40 toward Oxford and continue to Stratford-upon-Avon on the A34.

Finding information and taking a tour
Stratford’s Tourist Information Centre (Bridgefoot; % 0870/160-7930;
www.shakespeare-country.co.uk) provides information and maps of
the town and its major sites. Easter through October, the center is open
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 5 p.m. in winter) and
Sunday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. (10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. in winter).
Bus tours of Stratford, provided by City Sightseeing (%
01708/866-000), leave from outside the tourist office. Open-top, double-
decker buses depart every 15 minutes daily 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in
summer (until 3:30 p.m. the rest of the year). You can take the one-
hour ride without stops or get off and on at any or all of the town’s five
Shakespeare properties, including Mary Arden’s House in Wilmcote (see
the following section). The tour ticket is valid all day but doesn’t include
admission into any of the houses. The tours cost £9 ($18) adults, £7
($14) seniors and students, and £4 ($8) children under 12. You can buy
your ticket on the bus.
Seeing the sights
You can buy a combination ticket at your first stop that gets you 
into the five sites administered by the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust:
Shakespeare’s Birthplace, Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, New Place/
Nash’s House, Mary Arden’s House, and Hall’s Croft. The ticket costs
£14 ($28) adults, £12 ($24) seniors and students, £6.50 ($13) children,
and £29 ($58) families (two adults and three children). Purchase a
reduced-price ticket if you only want to visit the three sites in town.
A logical place to begin your tour is Shakespeare’s Birthplace (Henley
Street; % 01789/204-016; www.shakespeare.org.uk), where the bard,
son of a glover and wool merchant, first saw the light of day on April 23,
1564. You enter through the modern Shakespeare Centre, where you
can spend a few minutes browsing the exhibits that illustrate his life and
times. The house, filled with Shakespeare memorabilia, is actually two
16th-century half-timbered houses joined together. His father’s shop was
on one side, and the family residence was on the other. After visiting the
bedroom where wee Willie was (probably) born, the Elizabethan kitchen,
and other rooms, you can walk through the garden. Admission costs £7
($14) adults, £6 ($12) seniors and students, £2.60 ($5.20) children, and
£17 ($34) families (two adults and three children). Shakespeare’s
Birthplace is open daily April through May and September through
October 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.); June through August 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 9:30 a.m.); and November through March 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.). It’s closed December 24 to 26.
To visit Anne Hathaway’s Cottage (Cottage Lane, Shottery [about a mile
south of Stratford]; % 01789/292-100), take a bus from Bridge Street 
or, better still, walk there along the well-marked country path from
Evesham Place. Anne Hathaway, who came from a family of yeomen
farmers, lived in this lovely thatched cottage before she married 
Part IV: Exploring London 
278

18-year-old Shakespeare (a May-December marriage, as Anne was 25).
Many original 16th-century furnishings, including the courting settle (a
type of bench that courting couples often sat on), are preserved inside
the house, which was occupied by Anne’s ancestors until 1892. Before
leaving, be sure to stroll through the beautiful garden and orchard.
Admission costs £5.50 ($11) adults, £4.50 ($9) seniors and students, 
£2 ($4) children, and £13 ($26) families (two adults and three children).
The cottage is open daily April through May and September through
October 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10 a.m.); June through August 9
a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 9:30 a.m.); and November through March 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.). The cottage is closed January 1,
Good Friday (the Friday before Easter), and December 24 to 26.
Shakespeare retired in 1610 to New Place (Chapel Street; % 01789/
204-016). By that time, he was a relatively prosperous man whose plays
had been seen by Queen Elizabeth. New Place was a Stratford house that
he’d purchased a few years earlier and where he would die in 1616. The
house was later torn down and, today, only the gardens remain. To reach
the site from his birthplace, walk east on Henley Street and south on
High Street, which becomes Chapel Street. Visitors enter through Nash’s
House, which belonged to Thomas Nash, husband of Shakespeare’s
granddaughter. The house contains 16th-century period rooms and an
exhibit illustrating the history of Stratford. Adjoining the house is a knot
garden landscaped in an Elizabethan style. Admission costs £3.75 ($7.50)
adults, £3 ($6) seniors and students, £1.75 ($3.50) children, and £10
($20) families (two adults and three children). Hours are daily April
through May and September through October 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; June
through August 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun from 10 a.m.); and November
through March 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Shakespeare’s daughter, Susanna, probably lived with her husband, Dr.
John Hall, in Hall’s Croft (Old Town; % 01789/292-107), a magnificent
Tudor house with a walled garden. From New Place, continue south on
Chapel and Church streets and turn east on Old Town to reach Hall’s
Croft. The house is furnished in the style of a middle-class 17th-century
home. On view are exhibits illustrating the theory and practice of medi-
cine in Dr. Hall’s time. Hours and admission are the same as for Nash’s
House (see the preceding paragraph).
Shakespeare died on his birthday, at age 52, and was buried in Holy
Trinity Church (Old Town; % 01789/266-316; www.stratford-upon-
avon.org), a beautiful parish church beside the Avon River. His wife,
Anne, his daughter Susanna, and Susanna’s husband, John Hall, lie
beside him in front of the altar. A bust of the immortal bard looks down
upon the gravesite. I find it a bit odd that the inscription on the tomb 
of the man who wrote some of the world’s most enduring lines is little
more than doggerel, ending with “and curst be he who moves my
bones.” Obviously William Shakespeare didn’t want to leave Stratford —
ever. Admission to the church is free, but a small donation (£1.50/$3) is
requested to see Shakespeare’s tomb. March and October, you can visit
the church Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., April through
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 279

September from 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., November through February 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m.; year-round, the church is open Sunday 12:30 to 5 p.m. It’s
closed December 24 to 26, January 1, and Easter.
About 5km (3 1⁄2 miles) north of Stratford on the A34 (Birmingham) 
road is Mary Arden’s House & Shakespeare Countryside Museum
(Wilmcote; % 01789/204-016), the last of the five Shakespeare shrines.
For more than 200 years, Palmers Farm, a Tudor farmstead with an old
stone dovecote and outbuildings, was identified as the girlhood home of
Mary Arden, Shakespeare’s mother. Recent evidence revealed, however,
that Mary Arden actually lived in the house next door, at Glebe Farm. In
2000, the house at Glebe Farm was officially re-designated as the Mary
Arden House. Dating from 1514, the house contains country furniture
and domestic utensils; in the barns, stable, cowshed, and farmyard, you
find an extensive collection of farming implements illustrating life and
work in the local countryside from Shakespeare’s time to the present.
Admission costs £6 ($12) adults, £5 ($10) seniors and students, £2.50
($5) children, and £15 ($30) families (two adults and three children).
Hours are November through March and September through October 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.); April through May 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
(Sun from 10:30 a.m.); and June through August 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. (Sun
from 10 a.m.).
Seeing a play at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre
The Royal Shakespeare Theatre (Waterside; % 01789/295-623; www.
rsc.org.uk) is the home of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC),
which typically stages five Shakespeare plays during a season, running
from November through September (for current offerings, and to book
tickets online, visit its Web site). A few tickets are always held for sale 
on the day of a performance, but if you wait until you arrive in Stratford,
you may not be able to get a good seat. The box office is open Monday
through Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. but closes at 6 p.m. on days when no
performances are on the schedule. Tickets cost £8 to £46 ($16–$92). Note:
The main RSC theatre is closed for restoration from 2007 to 2010; in the
meantime, performances will be held at the Swan and Courtyard theatres.
Stratford’s newest attraction, Shakespearience (Waterside Theatre,
Waterside; % 01789/290-111; www.shakespearience.co.uk), presents
the life and works of Shakespeare in a unique way, using show technol-
ogy and special effects. The show includes information about the Bard 
of Stratford and dramatic highlights from nine of his best-loved plays.
Tickets cost £7.25 ($15) adults; £6.25 ($13) seniors, students, and chil-
dren under 12; and £24 ($48) families (two adults and two children).
Shows begin daily at 10:30 a.m. and end at 5 p.m. (4 p.m. in winter).
Dining locally
If you want to have lunch or afternoon tea in enjoyably old-fashioned
surroundings, try Hathaway Tea Rooms & Bakery (19 High St.; 
% 01789/292-404; www.hathawaytearooms.co.uk). The tearooms 
Part IV: Exploring London 
280

are on the second floor of a building that dates from 1610. Cream tea
comes with homemade fruit scones, clotted cream, and jam, and high
tea includes a variety of sandwiches. You can also get an English break-
fast and light meals throughout the day. Main courses run from £6 to 
£8 ($12–$16); cream teas cost £5.20 ($10); and high teas cost £7 ($14).
There’s a kids’ menu for £5 ($10). Credit cards are not accepted. The 
tearooms are open daily 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
The Oppo (13 Sheep St.; % 01789/269-980; www.theoppo.co.uk),
housed in a 16th-century building in the heart of Stratford, offers a 
historic setting and a mix of traditional and Modern British cuisine.
Reservations are recommended. Main courses run from £9 to £18
($18–$36). The restaurant accepts MasterCard and Visa, and it’s open
daily noon to 2 p.m. and 5 to 11 p.m.
Spending the night
During the long theater season, reserve in advance if you’re planning 
to sleep, perchance to dream, in Stratford. However, the Tourist
Information Centre (Bridgefoot; % 0870/160-7930) can help you find
accommodations.
Mercure Shakespeare Hotel Stratford (Chapel Street; % 01789/294-499;
fax: 01789/415-411; www.mercure.com) successfully blends old and new.
Parts of this centrally located hotel date from 1635 and preserve the
original Tudor Era beams and stone floor, but all 74 rooms were com-
pletely refurbished in 2005 in a comfortably elegant and traditional style.
The rooms come with a host of modern amenities, and all the bathrooms
have bathtubs with showers. Rack rates for a double with English break-
fast range from £90 to £190 ($180–$380). The hotel accepts all major
credit cards.
The Payton (6 St. John St.; %/fax 01789/266-442; www.payton.co.uk), 
a Georgian-era town house B&B, is located on a quiet side street that’s
just a three-minute walk from the town center. The five en-suite guest
rooms are clean, comfortable, and charming. A double room with private
shower and English breakfast costs £70 to £75 ($140–$150). The Payton
accepts MasterCard and Visa.
Salisbury and Stonehenge: Steeples 
and Standing Stones
The tall, slender spire of Salisbury Cathedral rises up from the plains of
Wiltshire like a finger pointing toward the heavens. Salisbury (see the
“Salisbury” map on p. 282), or New Sarum as it was once called, lies in
the valley of the Avon River, 145km (90 miles) southwest of London.
Filled with Tudor inns and tearooms and dominated by its beautiful
cathedral, this old market town is often overlooked by visitors eager 
to see Stonehenge, about 15km (9 miles) away.

Part IV: Exploring London 
282
Getting there
From London’s Waterloo Station, trains run hourly to Salisbury; the 
journey takes about 90 minutes and costs about £25 ($50) for an off-
peak (after 9:30 a.m.) round-trip ticket. For schedules, go to www.
nationalrail.co.uk, or call % 0845/484-950. If you’re driving 
from London, head west on the M3 to the end of the run, continuing 
the rest of the way on the A30.
Finding information
Salisbury’s Tourist Information Centre is on Fish Row (% 01722/
334-956; www.visitsalisbury.com) and is open Monday through
Saturday 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (June–Sept until 6 p.m.; Sun May–Sept
10:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.).

Seeing the sights
Visitors eager to see Stonehenge often overlook the lovely old market
town of Salisbury, but I suggest that you try to spend a bit of time wan-
dering through Salisbury Cathedral.
Salisbury
Despite an ill-conceived renovation in the 18th century, the 13th-century
structure of Salisbury Cathedral (The Close; % 01722/555-120; www.
salisburycathedral.org.uk) remains the best example in England of
Early English and Perpendicular Gothic style. The 123-meter (404-foot)
spire is the tallest in the country. The beautiful 13th-century, octagonal
chapter house possesses one of the four surviving original texts of the
Magna Carta. Adding to the serene beauty of the cathedral are the clois-
ters and an exceptionally large close, comprising about 75 buildings.
The suggested donation for admission is £5 ($10) for adults, £4.25
($8.50) seniors and students, £3 ($6) for children, and £12 ($24) for fami-
lies. The cathedral is open daily from 7:15 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. (June–Aug
until 7:15 p.m).
Wilton House (% 01722/746-720; www.wiltonhouse.co.uk), in the
town of Wilton, 5km (3 miles) west of Salisbury on the A30, is one of
England’s great country estates. The home of the earls of Pembroke, 
the house is noted for its 17th-century staterooms by the celebrated
architect Inigo Jones. Shakespeare’s troupe is believed to have enter-
tained here. Several centuries later in this house, General Eisenhower
and his advisers made preparations for the D-day landings at Normandy.
Beautifully maintained furnishings and paintings by Brueghel, Reynolds,
Rubens, and Van Dyck fill the house. You can visit a reconstructed Tudor
kitchen and Victorian laundry, plus the Wareham Bears, a collection of
some 200 miniature dressed teddy bears. The 21-acre grounds include
rose and water gardens, riverside and woodland walks, and a huge
adventure playground for children. Admission costs £12 ($24) adults,
£9.75 ($20) seniors, £6.50 ($13) children 5 to 15, and £30 ($60) families
(two adults and two children). Mid-April through October, the house and
grounds are open daily April through September from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. (last admission 4:30 p.m.; occasional closings). If you don’t have a
car, you can take the bus that stops on New Canal, a ten-minute walk
north of Salisbury train station; check with the tourist office for sched-
ules and to be certain that the house is open that day.
Stonehenge
About 15km (9 miles) north of Salisbury, at the junction of the A303 
and the A344/A360, you find one of the world’s most renowned prehis-
toric sites and one of England’s most popular attractions, the prehis-
toric stone circle known as Stonehenge (% 01980/624-715; www.
stonehenge.co.uk). If you’re not driving, hop on one of the Wilts &
Dorset (% 01202/673-555; www.wdbus.co.uk) buses that depart from
the Salisbury train station daily between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.; the trip
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 283

takes about 40 minutes, and the round-trip fare costs about £7 ($14). The
crowds can be overwhelming as the day wears on, so arrive as early as
possible.
Stonehenge is a stone circle of megalithic pillars and lintels built on the
flat Salisbury Plain. Archaeological dating has shown that the site was
built in stages from 5,000 to 3,500 years ago. Many visitors to Stonehenge
are disappointed to find that the standing stones aren’t as enormous as
they envisioned and are now surrounded by a barrier that keeps sight-
seers 15m (50 feet) from the stones. Keep in mind, however, that many 
of the stones, which weigh several tons, were mined and moved from 
distant quarries in a time before forklifts, trucks, and dynamite.
Stonehenge was a shrine and/or ceremonial gathering place of some
kind. The old belief that Stonehenge was built by the Druids has been
discredited (it’s probably older than the Celtic Druids). A popular theory
is that the site was an astronomical observatory, because it’s aligned to
the summer solstice and can accurately predict eclipses based on the
placement of the stones. But in an age when experts think they know
everything, Stonehenge still keeps its tantalizing mysteries to itself.
Recent archaeological evidence has uncovered another ceremonial
avenue and leads experts to speculate that Stonehenge was an impor-
tant burial place. Admission costs £6.30 ($13) adults, £4.70 ($9.40) sen-
iors and students, and £3.10 ($6.20) children. The site is open daily from
March 16 through May, and September through October 15 9:30 a.m. to 6
p.m.; June through August 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.; and October 16 to March 15
9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Dining locally
Looking for simple, healthy, homemade food? Go to Harper’s Restaurant
(7–9 Ox Row, Market Square; % 01722/333-118). You can order from two
menus, one featuring cost-conscious, bistro-style platters and the other
a longer menu with all-vegetarian pasta dishes. Main courses cost £7.50
to £14 ($15–$28), and fixed-price meals are £8.50 ($17) at lunch and £11
($22) at dinner. The restaurant accepts American Express, MasterCard,
and Visa. It’s open Monday through Saturday noon to 2 p.m. and 6:30 to
9:30 p.m., plus Sundays in summer from 6 to 9 p.m.
One Minster Street (1 Minster St.; % 01722/322-024) is the new name
for a creaky-timbered, wonderfully atmospheric, 1320 chophouse and
pub that used to be called the Haunch of Venison. The menu at the third-
floor restaurant features some good dishes, including many traditional
favorites. Main courses go for £7.50 to £15 ($15–$30).It accepts American
Express, MasterCard, and Visa. Do check out the ancient pub rooms
(still called the Haunch of Venison), even if you don’t dine here. The pub
is open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sunday noon to
10:30 p.m.
Part IV: Exploring London 
284

Spending the night
A Salisbury landmark since Georgian times, the Mercure White Hart
Hotel (1 St. John St.; % 01722/327478; www.mercure-uk.com) was
totally renovated in 2007. The hotel offers accommodations in the older
section of the building or in a new motel-like section in the rear. A good
restaurant is on-site. Rates start at £90 to £160 ($180–$320) for a double.
The hotel accepts American Express, MasterCard, and Visa.
Atmosphere fills every nook and cranny of the Red Lion Hotel (Milford
Street; % 01722/323-334; www.the-redlion.co.uk), founded more
than 750 years ago. The cozy lounge is a popular spot for tea, and, in
good weather, the vine-covered courtyard is a pleasant place for drinks.
Although now part of the Best Western chain, the hotel has maintained
its own venerable identity. Each guest room is uniquely furnished, some
with fireplaces and four-poster beds. Double rooms with breakfast cost
£90 to £110 ($180–$220). The hotel accepts American Express, Diners
Club, MasterCard, and Visa.
York: Ancient Walls and Snickelways
York is only 314km (195 miles) north of London, close enough for a day
trip but worlds apart in character. York (see the “York” map on p. 286) 
is the capital of the North and one of England’s most historic cities.
Under the Romans, who built a major fort here, the city was known as
Eboracum. For hundreds of years after that, York was a thriving Viking
settlement called Jorvik. And finally, after the Norman Conquest, it
became York, queen of the North. Interesting museums, historic build-
ings of all kinds, good hotels, excellent shops, and fine restaurants make
York a popular tourist city, and rightly so. Enormous York Minster, the
largest Gothic structure north of the Alps, dominates the city. And,
amazingly, the old town’s 800-year-old walls and fortified gateways still
girdle the old town center. Soak up the city’s history while exploring its
maze of ancient streets and snickelways (hidden alleyways); you can get
everywhere on foot and see many attractions in just a day.
Getting there
To make York work as a day trip, you need to take one of the fast, direct
trains from London’s King’s Cross Station that will get you there in two
hours. The round-trip fare costs £75 ($150), but much lower fares are
usually available. For train schedules and information, call National Rail
Enquiries at % 08457/484-950 or visit www.nationalrail.com. The
train station is a five-minute walk from York’s historic center.
If you need a taxi, contact Station Taxis (% 01904/623-332).

Finding information and taking a tour
At both of the following places, you can get an inexpensive guidebook
with a map, book a room, and obtain information on guided tours:
 A convenient branch of the Tourist Information Centre (no phone)
is right in the train station. The office is open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (until 6 p.m. in summer) and Sunday
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (until 5 p.m. in summer).

 The main Tourist Information Centre, De Grey Rooms, Exhibition
Square (% 01904/550-099; www.visityork.org), near York
Minster, has the same open hours as the train station branch.
More guided tours are offered in York than in just about any other city 
in England, excluding London. You can explore the city by foot, bus, or
boat. If you’re staying overnight, see my list of evening Ghost Walks at
the end of the chapter. Here are some of your daytime options:
 The York Association of Voluntary Guides (% 01904/640-780;
www.york.touristguides.btinternet.co.uk) presents free
two-hour guided tours of the city. The tours depart daily at 
10:15 a.m. year-round from Exhibition Square in the city center.
Additional tours start at 2:15 p.m. and 6:45 p.m. in summer. You
don’t need to make a reservation; just show up.
 During the summer, you can hire a horse-drawn carriage in front of
the Dean Court Hotel near York Minster. A 15-minute ride around
the cathedral close (the walled precinct surrounding the cathedral)
costs £3.50 ($7) for adults and £2.50 ($5) for children.
 Departing from the pier below Lendal Bridge, York Boat (% 01904/
647-204; www.yorkboat.co.uk) provides a 45-minute tour with
live commentary that nicely complements a walking tour. From
mid-February through November, at least four boats depart each
day; you can buy your ticket onboard. The tour costs £7 ($14) for
adults, £6 ($12) for seniors, £3.50 ($7) for children 5 to 15, and £20
($40) for families (two adults, three children).
 City Sightseeing (% 01904/625-618) runs open-top, double-decker
tour buses on a circuit of all the main sights in York (one hour
total). The ticket, valid all day so you can hop on and off as you
want, costs £9 ($18) for adults, £7 ($14) for seniors and students,
£4 ($8) for children 5 to 15, and £20 ($40) for families (two adults,
two children). The buses run year-round from about 9:30 a.m. to 
5 p.m.; you can get on at the train station and buy your ticket from
the driver.
Seeing the sights
York is a delightful city to explore, with its old streets, lanes, snickel-
ways, and many tourist attractions. You’ll find more to do here than you
could ever fit into a one-day excursion, so be selective and keep a map
with you, because you can easily get lost on the city’s medieval streets.
(Note: I list the attractions in order of their overall interest.)
Awesome York Minster (Minster Yard; % 01904/557-216; www.
yorkminster.org), the largest Gothic cathedral in northern Europe,
was built between 1220 and 1472. Architecturally, it spans the entire
range of Gothic style: Early English (1220–1260), Decorated (1280–1350),
and Perpendicular (1361–1472).

Part IV: Exploring London 
288
The chief cathedral in the north of England, York Minster (see the “York
Minster” map above) contains half of all the medieval stained glass in the
country. The Five Sisters’ Window from 1260 is the oldest complete
window in the Minster. (Minster, by the way, means a church, usually with
cathedral status, attached to a monastery.) The Great West Window,
painted in 1338 and set in heart-shaped tracery, is known as the “Heart 
of Yorkshire.” Above the south door, a magnificent Rose Window (1500)
commemorates the union of the royal houses of Lancaster and York.
Painted in 1310, the Jesse Window in the south nave depicts Jesus’s
family tree. The Minster’s Decorated Gothic nave (the main central 
space in the interior), begun in 1291 and finished in the 1350s, is one 
of Europe’s widest. A 15th-century Choir Screen decorated with statues
of 15 kings of England separates the nave from the choir. In the south
transept, you can descend into the Undercroft, where excavations have
revealed the Roman basilica (an assembly hall, not a Christian church)
that stood here nearly 2,000 years ago. You can take a well-designed
“time walk” to see Roman, Anglo-Saxon, and Norman remains. The walk
leads to the 12th-century Crypt and the Treasury, where silver plate 

and other church treasures are on display. From the nave, a separate
entrance leads to the 13th-century Chapter House, filled with fine stone
carvings and medieval glass. You can also ascend the minster’s soaring
tower for a bird’s-eye view of York and the surrounding region. Give 
yourself at least an hour to see everything in the cathedral. Admission 
to the Minster, undercroft, treasury, crypt, and tower is £9 ($18) for
adults, £7.50 ($15) for seniors and students, and £3 ($6) for children. 
The Minster is open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
from noon to 3:45 p.m.
In Minster Yard you’ll find the Treasurer’s House (% 01904/624-247),
an elegant town house that was originally the home of the treasurer of
York Minster. Built in 1620, the house was extensively remodeled during
the Victorian Era by an eccentric Yorkshireman who cared so passion-
ately about interior décor that he threatened to return to haunt the
place if anyone ever moved any of his furniture. As the furniture hasn’t
been moved, the house features beautiful period rooms with collections
of 17th- and 18th-century furniture, glass, clocks, and china. You can see
the entire collection in about 30 minutes. Stroll through the pretty
walled garden, even if you don’t visit the house. The tearoom downstairs
is a good place for lunch or tea. Admission to the house is £5 ($10) for
adults and £2.50 ($5) children 5 to 15. The house is open mid-March to
October Saturday through Thursday from 11 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. (Nov
1–11 until 3 p.m.); it’s closed December to mid-March.
Almost 5km (3 miles) of medieval city walls enclose York, and walking
along them is one of the best ways to enjoy the historic ambience of this
ancient city. Fortified gateways (or bars) still serve as entrances to the
old part of town. A path (open daily 8 a.m. to dusk) runs along the top of
the walls, with plenty of great views along the way. You find stairways up
to the top of the walls at the four gates. Micklegate, the southern entry
used by royalty, is a good place to start your wall walk.
Until 150 years ago, The Shambles (www.yorkshambles.com) was a
street where butchers displayed their finest cuts in open windows on
wide shelves called shammels. Today, this narrow, winding lane, with
buildings so close that they shut out the light, is England’s most famous
medieval street. Gift shops have replaced the butcher shops, so you 
can get in a bit of retail therapy as you stroll. No. 35 The Shambles is 
a shrine to St. Margaret Clitheroe, a butcher’s wife executed during the
Reformation for hiding Catholic priests in her attic; she was canonized 
in 1970.
If you want to revisit the Viking Age, hop into one of the time cars at
Jorvik Viking Centre (Coppergate; % 01904/643-211; www.jorvik-
viking-centre.co.uk) to be transported back to A.D. 948, when Eric
Bloodaxe was king and York was Jorvik, a thriving Viking port and trad-
ing town. The scenes you see — of village life, market stalls, crowded
houses, and the wharf — are meticulous re-creations based on archaeo-
logical finds in this area; even the heads and faces of the animatronic
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 289

characters were modeled on Viking skulls. Artifacts unearthed on this
site are also on display. Give yourself about an hour. Admission is £8
($16) adults, £7 ($14) seniors and students, and £5.50 ($11) for children
5 to 15. Jorvik is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; in winter until 4 p.m.
Allow about 30 minutes.
In the Medieval Era, guilds ran English towns. The 14th-century stone
and half-timbered Merchant Adventurers Hall (Fossgate; % 0194/
654-818; www.theyorkcompany.co.uk) belonged to York’s most power-
ful guild (the Merchant Adventurers controlled trade into and out of the
city). This building, one of the largest and best-preserved guildhalls in
the country, has a great hall for business, a hospital for charitable work,
and a chapel for worship. Allow 30 minutes for a tour with an audio
guide. Admission is £2.50 ($5) adults, £2 ($4) seniors and students, £1
($2) children 5 to 15. The guildhall is open April through September
Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Friday through Saturday 9
a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Sunday noon to 4 p.m.; October through March
Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
The great exhibits at the National Railway Museum (Leeman Road; 
% 08448/153-139; www.nrm.org.uk) appeal to both adults and chil-
dren. The earliest train cars on display in this museum devoted to
England’s railroad system date from the 1840s and look like stage-
coaches on tracks. You can peek into the windows of private royal
coaches, from Queen Victoria’s of 1869, with its bulky furniture (the 
engineer had to stop when the queen wanted to move from one car to
the next), to Queen Elizabeth II’s streamlined, functional carriage, used
until 1977. You see a replica of the first steam locomotive (1830) and a
display of the new Eurostar high-speed train. You need at least an hour
for a thorough visit of this fascinating museum. On some trains, kids 
can climb up into the engineer’s area. Admission is free. The museum 
is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; it’s closed December 24 to 26.
England’s most popular folk museum, the York Castle Museum
(% 01904/653-611; www.yorkshiremuseum.org.uk) is located in the
area called Eye of York, near Clifford’s Tower. Using a treasure-trove of
now-vanished everyday objects, the exhibitions re-create slices of life
from past historical eras. The museum took over York’s 200-year-old
prison buildings, with graffiti still on the walls of the dingy cells. You can
walk down a reconstruction of Kirkgate, a cobbled Victorian shopping
street; see a Jacobean dining room; visit a moorland cottage and a gypsy
caravan; call in at a Victorian police station and an Edwardian pub; and
check out the Jane Austen Costume Collection’s fashion and fabrics.
Kids love the giant dollhouses. Allow at least an hour. Admission is £5
($10) for adults, £3.50 ($7) for children 5 to 15, and £12 ($24) for families
(two adults, one child). It’s open daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and is
closed January 2 and December 24 to 26.

The Yorkshire Museum (Museum Gardens; % 01904/551-800; www.
yorkshiremuseum.org.uk) is somewhat old-fashioned and heavy 
on the text panels, but if you start in the Roman section and walk
through to the end, you get a sound presentation of Yorkshire’s history
from two millennia ago through the 16th century. You can view elegant
Roman jewelry, mosaics, and Anglo-Saxon silver. Viking treasures
include swords and battleaxes. The Middleham Jewel, a 15th-century
pendant decorated with a large sapphire, was found in 1985 in North
Yorkshire. The museum lies in 10 acres of landscaped gardens amid 
the ruins of St. Mary’s Abbey, once the wealthiest abbey in the north. 
On the grounds, you can see a 15th-century timber-framed building
known as The Hospitium. Give this museum about an hour. Admission 
is £5 ($10) for adults, £3.50 ($7) for children 5 to 15, and £12 ($24) for
families (two adults, one child). You can purchase a joint ticket that
allows admission to the Yorkshire Museum and the York Castle 
Museum. These tickets are £9.50 ($19) adults, £6 ($12) for children 5 
to 15, and £24 ($48) for families (two adults, one child). The museum 
is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and is closed January 1 and
December 25 to 26.
The York Art Gallery (Exhibition Square; % 01904/687-687; www.
yorkshiremuseum.org.uk), with freshly refurbished galleries 
and a new cafe, is in an Italian Renaissance–style building completed 
in 1879. The collections on view span seven centuries of Western
European painting and include pictures by Parmigianino, Bellotto, 
Lely, and Reynolds, and a small collection of 20th-century studio 
pottery. You can see the entire collection in less than an hour; if 
your time is limited, don’t make this a priority. Admission is free. The
museum is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and is closed January 1 
and December 25 to 26.
Chapter 14: Going Beyond London: Six Great Day Trips 291
Ghostly legions
In 1953, apprentice heating engineer Harry Martindale was working in the basement
of the Treasurer’s House when he heard what sounded like marching feet. As he
watched in amazement, a battalion of ghostly Roman soldiers marched right through
the cellar. As it turns out, the Treasurer’s House was built over the main Roman road.
You can check out the haunted cellar of Treasurer’s House yourself on one of the daily
cellar tours, which cost £2 ($4).

Dining locally
Founded in 1919, Betty’s (6–8 St. Helen’s Sq.; % 01904/659-142; www.
bettys.co.uk) is a wonderfully old-fashioned Art Nouveau tearoom,
patisserie, and restaurant. Sandwiches, salads, and a dozen or so hot
dishes (both fish and meat) are available. Specialties include smoked
salmon muffins, Yorkshire rarebit, locally made sausages, and haddock
and prawns in white-wine cream sauce. The pastries, all made according
to secret recipes, are superb. At the shop in front, you can buy special-
ties, such as Yorkshire fat rascals: warm scones with citrus peels,
almonds, and cherries. Main courses go for £6.50 to £10 ($13–$20);
cream tea costs £7 to £15 ($14 to $30). American Express, MasterCard,
and Visa are accepted. The restaurant is open daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
If you’re looking for atmosphere and good Modern British cooking, try The
Blue Bicycle (34 Fossgate; % 01904/673-990; www.thebluebicycle.
com), an appealing restaurant overlooking the canal-like Ouse River. It has
a brasserie-style menu with a few standard menu items, daily specials,
and a grill for meat and fish dishes. The dinner menu usually features 
several varieties of fish cooked various ways, plus chicken, beef, and a
vegetarian offering. Reservations recommended for dinner. Main courses
run from £11 to £20 ($22–$40). American Express, MasterCard, and Visa
are accepted. The restaurant is open daily from noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to
9 p.m. The Blue Bicycle also rents out two self-contained luxury rooms in
the center of York for £150 ($300) per room per night.
If you’re looking for simple pub grub, stop in at Harkers (St. Helen’s
Square; % 01904/672-795), in the former Yorkshire Insurance Company
building dating from 1824. The menu features traditional dishes, such 
as chicken-and-onion pie, fish and chips, ploughman’s lunch (bread,
cheese, and salad), and Cumberland sausages. The place can become
something of a mob scene after work. Main courses cost £5.50 to £9.95
($11 to $20). MasterCard and Visa are accepted. Food is served daily
from noon to 7 p.m.; the pub is open Monday through Saturday from 11
a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 10:30 p.m.

York’s big wheel
York’s newest attraction is a giant Ferris wheel located at the National Railway
Museum. Rising 54m (114 feet), the Yorkshire Wheel (www.nrm.org.uk) offers great
views of the city center, York Minister, and the River Ouse from enclosed, air-condi-
tioned pods similar to those of the British Airways London Eye (see Chapter 11). The
wheel operates daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (until 8 p.m. in summer). Cost is £6 ($12) for
adults, £4 ($8) for children.

Spending the night
The Bar Convent (17 Blossom St.; % 01904/264-902; www.bar-convent.
org.uk), a hotel in a former convent building, is an inexpensive, unusual,
and convenient place to stay. The accommodations are in a Georgian
building on the corner of Nunnery Lane and Blossom Street, a five-minute
walk from the train station. The seven rooms, refurbished in 2005, are
comfortable but nothing fancy; only one has a private bathroom. The con-
vent, which houses a neoclassical chapel and a museum, was founded in
1686 and was active as a school until 1985. The on-site cafe serves inex-
pensive meals. A double room with shared bathroom costs £57 ($114); the
double room with private bathroom costs £70 ($140). Rates include conti-
nental breakfast. The hotel accepts MasterCard and Visa.
Created from a classical Regency brick town house, The Grange (1
Clifton; % 01904/644-744; www.grangehotel.co.uk) is a small, elegant
hotel close to the city walls and a few minutes’ walk from York Minster.
The 30 individually designed rooms use antique furniture and convey a
comfortable English charm. Bathrooms are nicely done. The hotel offers
room service and two good restaurants: The Ivy, serving classic French
and Modern British cuisine, is considered one of the best restaurants in
York; the Brasserie offers informal dining in the old brick vaulted cellars.
A double room with English breakfast costs £125 to £220 ($250 to $440).
American Express, MasterCard, and Visa are accepted.

Ghouls and ghosties galore: 
York’s ghost walks
If you’re spending the night in York, check out the city’s array of Ghost Walks.
Apparently, plenty of supernatural activity takes place in York, which some claim is
England’s most haunted city. Evening ghost walks, with entertaining commentary and
sometimes a bit of spookery thrown in, are a regular year-round industry. You have
several tours to choose from and you can buy your tickets on the spot. Tours cost £4
to £5 ($8–$10) for adults, £2 to £3 ($4–$6) for seniors, students, and children 5 to 15.
 The Ghost Hunt of York (% 01904/608-700; www.ghosthunt.co.uk): “Andy
Dextrous,” ghost hunter, leads this fun, one-hour walk and performance. Walks
leave nightly at 7:30 from The Shambles, York’s medieval street.
 The Ghost Trail (% 01904/633-276; www.ghosttrail.co.uk): You get more
traditional ghost-storytelling on this walk, which leaves nightly at 7:30 from the
front entrance of York Minster.
 Original Ghost Walk of York (% 01759/373-090; www.theoriginal
ghostwalkofyork.co.uk): This tour started in 1973 and features great sto-
rytelling that explores the area’s folklore, legend, and dreams. Walks leave nightly
at 8 from The King’s Arms Pub, Ouse Bridge.

Living It Up after
Dark: London
Nightlife

In this part . . .
L
ondon, for some people, is synonymous with the perform-
ing arts. Planning a night out here isn’t the problem —
choosing among all the possibilities is where the difﬁculty
lies. So, in Chapter 15, I give you the scoop on London’s
world-class performing arts scene, tell you how to ﬁnd out
what’s going on and how to get tickets, and provide informa-
tion on the main venues for theater, music — including opera
and symphony concerts — and dance. The performing arts
are only part of London’s pulsing nightlife, so, in Chapter 16, I
introduce you to some of the many places where you can 
rub elbows with Londoners and have a pint or two — pubs,
bars, clubs, discos, and jazz spots.

Chapter 15
Applauding the 
Performing Arts
In This Chapter
 Getting the inside scoop on London’s theater and performing arts scene
 Going to the symphony, listening to chamber music, and hitting rock
concerts
 Seeing opera and dance performances
 Finding out what’s on and getting tickets
L
ondon is a mecca of the performing arts, offering world-class the-
ater, several symphony orchestras, rock concerts, operas, modern
dance, and classical ballets. In a city renowned for its theater scene, you
can enjoy every kind of play or musical. Or take your pick from the city’s
own Royal Opera, Royal Ballet, English National Opera, or London
Symphony Orchestra. This chapter gives you the information that you
need to plan a trip that includes the performing arts.
Getting the Inside Scoop
From a global perspective, London may hold the title of world perform-
ing arts capital, based on the number of offerings and the quality of the
performances. Of course, London didn’t attain this stature overnight.
The city has been building its theatrical reputation since the Elizabethan
Era, when Shakespeare, Marlowe, and others were staging their plays in
a South Bank theater district. A strong musical tradition has been in
place since the 18th century.
The performing arts scene, in general, gives London a buzz for residents
and visitors alike. Major British stars with international screen reputa-
tions regularly perform in the West End, although you’re just as likely to
see a show starring someone that you’ve never heard of but who’s well
known in England. You can also expect to find a few American plays and
musicals, because the crossover between London and New York is
increasing.

And here’s some more good news: Tickets are still cheaper here than in
New York. In London theaters, you rarely pay more than £50 ($100) for
the best seats in the house. The price is dramatically less for symphony
concerts, too: £5 to £20 ($10–$40) for excellent seats at the Barbican, for
example. The same goes for that priciest of art forms, opera — you can
get special day-of-performance seats for as little as £10 ($20).
Plays and performances in London have varying curtain times. Evening
performances may begin at 7:30 p.m., 8 p.m., or 8:30 p.m., and matinees
at 1:30 p.m., 2 p.m., or 2:30 p.m. Check your ticket to be certain, because
if you’re late, you won’t be admitted until the second act or a suitable
pause in the action occurs. If you come laden with packages, you can
check them in the coatroom. Talking and noisily unwrapping pieces of
candy during the performance will be frowned upon — especially if I’m
in the audience.
Wondering what to wear to the theater? London theater audiences are,
generally speaking, pretty well dressed. Although no hard and fast rules
apply, if you arrive in a sweat suit and running shoes, you’ll be conspicu-
ous. A “smart casual” approach is best.
Finding Out What’s Playing 
and Getting Tickets
For the most comprehensive listings of London performances, buy a
copy of the weekly magazine Time Out, available at London newsstands
on Wednesdays. You can find details for all London shows, concerts, 
and other performances in the daily London newspapers: the Daily
Telegraph, the Evening Standard, the Guardian, the Independent, and the
Times. Another good source is the free booklet London Planner, available
at the British & London Visitor Centre (1 Lower Regent St., SW1), or from
a VisitBritain travel office (see the Quick Concierge, at the end of this
book, for contact info).
To find out the performance schedule for an entire season, check out 
the Web sites that I list for specific opera, symphony, and ballet groups
throughout this chapter. Many venues let you book online.
The Web is one of the best places to search in advance for information
on plays and performances currently running in London. You may find
the following sites useful:

Getting tickets
If you are in London and decide that you want to see a show, you’ll proba-
bly be able to get a seat. Even if an announcement has been made that a
show is sold out, you can usually buy a ticket from the theater’s box office,
most of which open at 10 a.m. Ticket cancellations occur, and last-minute
house seats go on sale the day of the performance or an hour before.
If you don’t have time to go to the box office and you have a major credit
card handy, call the theater directly. Box office phone numbers are listed
in the papers and in Time Out. Many London theaters accept telephone
credit card bookings at regular prices (plus a minimal fee of about
£1.50/$3). They’ll hold your tickets at the box office, where you pick
them up any time up to a half-hour before the curtain. By buying directly
from the box office, you don’t have to pay the commission fee (up to 30
percent) that ticket agencies charge.
Buying a ticket in the “stalls” doesn’t mean that you’ll be seated in the
ladies’ powder room. It means that you may have one of the best seats 
in the house. Stalls is the British term for first-floor orchestra. Most of the
West End theaters are fairly old, which means that they may have boxes for
sale as well; these box seats are on the sides of the second or third tiers.
Using ticket agencies
Ticket agencies are used for commercial West End plays and musicals,
not for opera, ballet, or other performing arts. All over the West End,
and particularly around Leicester Square, ticket agencies boldly adver-
tise that they have tickets to the sold-out hit shows. Most of these
places are legitimate, but their commission fees vary.
If you choose to use the services of a ticket agency instead of booking
directly with the box office (see the preceding section), I recommend
that you call, stop in, or book online at one of the following trustworthy
agencies:
 Albemarle of London (74 Mortimer St., W1; % 020/7637-9041;
www.albemarle-london.com; Tube: Oxford Circus or Goodge
Street) is a long-established agency, open Monday through Friday
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Albemarle main-
tains dedicated theater desks at several of London’s ritzier hotels,
including the Savoy, the Park Lane the Dorchester, and Claridge’s
(see Chapter 9). Its commission fee of 25 percent on top of the
ticket price is what you can expect to pay for just about any theater
booking made through a hotel concierge.
 Keith Prowse maintains a counter at the Britain & London 
Visitor Centre (1 Lower Regent St., SW1; % 020/7808-3871; www.
keithprowse.com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus). The counter is open
Monday through Friday 10:15 a.m. to 6:15 p.m. and Saturday and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. You pay a variable commission on top of
the ticket price.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 299

Before you buy any ticket from any agency, the agent must tell you the
face value of the tickets (you can ask to see them). Before you sign
the charge receipt, be sure to check the seat numbers, the face value
of the tickets, and the agent’s booking fee. If you’re making a telephone
booking, the agent must disclose the face value of the tickets, their loca-
tions, and whether you have a restricted view.
Beware of unlicensed ticket agencies that charge far more than the face
value of the ticket plus a very hefty commission fee. A commission fee
should never be more than 30 percent of the regular ticket price.
Reputable ticket agencies belong to the Society of Ticket Agents and
Retailers (STAR) and always advertise this fact.
The Society of London Theatres (% 020/7836-0971; www.solt.co.uk)
operates the tkts half-price ticket booth in the clock tower building by
the gardens in Leicester Square (Tube: Leicester Square). The booth has
no telephone info line, so you have to show up in person to see what’s
on sale that day. One of the notice boards at tkts lists available theater
tickets for matinee performances (which may be on Wed, Thurs, Sat, or
Sun); the other notice board lists tickets available for evening perform-
ances. Check the signs above each of the ticket windows and make sure
you join the correct line, because tickets for matinee and evening shows
are sold from different windows. The booth is open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday noon to 3 p.m. Tickets are sold
the day of the performance only; you can pay with cash or by
MasterCard or Visa. You pay exactly half the price plus a nominal fee
(usually about £3/$6). The most popular shows usually won’t be avail-
able, but you may luck out. Tickets for the English National Opera and
other events are sometimes available as well. You may want to stop by,
in any case, to pick up a free copy of The Official London Theatre Guide,
which lists every show with addresses and phone numbers and includes
a map of the West End theater district.
Ticket agencies advertising half-price or reduced-price tickets are
located around Leicester Square. Keep in mind that the Society of
London Theatres operates the only official half-price ticket booth 
(tkts), and wave away those pesky scalpers who hang out in front of
megahits. They may, indeed, be selling (for an astronomical price) a
valid ticket. But some of these touts, as they’re called, also forge tickets,
which means that you’ll be out of cash and out of a show. By law, any
tout must disclose the face value of the ticket, so you know exactly 
what the markup is. The best advice: Don’t deal with them.
Raising the Curtain on the Performing Arts
London is famous for the scope and excellence of its theater scene, but
this world capital offers visitors a wealth of possibilities for enjoying all
the performing arts.
Part V: Living It Up after Dark: London Nightlife

Theater
Plays and musicals are staged all over the city in approximately 100 
theaters, but the commercial hits are centered in the West End theater
district — also called Theatreland — concentrated in the area around
Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square, and Covent Garden. The theaters at
the Barbican and the South Bank Centre (see the following section) also
provide major theater venues. Just like New York, London is the home of
many fringe venues (the equivalent of off- or off-off-Broadway theaters).
London’s theater offerings always include new plays and musicals, long-
run favorites, and revivals of the classics, as well as Shakespeare. Some
of the shows in the West End — such as Agatha Christie’s Mousetrap
and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Phantom of the Opera — have been running
for years and show no sign of winding down. The newest long-running
musicals are Mary Poppins, Wicked, The Sound of Music, and Billy Elliot.
In general, evening performances are Monday through Saturday, and,
depending on the show, matinees are on Wednesday or Thursday, and
Saturday. Some shows have added Sunday performances, too. Matinees
are a couple of pounds cheaper than evening performances.
In London, theaters don’t hand out play programs free of charge to
every patron. If you want a program, you must buy it. They usually 
cost £3 to £5 ($6–$10).
Major stages beyond the West End
I can’t list all the theaters in Theatreland, but I can highlight three stand-
out venues. They’re geographically outside London’s West End, but
they’re still considered part of the West End theater community.
 The Old Vic (The Cut, Waterloo, SE1; % 020/7928-7616; www.
oldvictheatre.com; Tube: Waterloo), on the South Bank near
Waterloo Station, has long been known as “the actors’ theatre.”
Many of England’s greatest performers have played on its stage,
including Laurence Olivier, Maggie Smith, and Judi Dench. The
American actor Kevin Spacey is the artistic director and appears 
in some of the shows. Its adjunct theater, the Young Vic (% 020/
7928-6363; www.youngvic.org), hosts productions of the Royal
Shakespeare Company. The box office for both venues is open
Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
 Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre (New Globe Walk, Bankside, SE1; 
% 020/7401-9919; www.shakespeares-globe.org; Tube: Cannon
Street or London Bridge) is the newest addition to the South Bank
theater scene. The Globe presents a May-through-early-October
season of the bard’s plays (and, now, contemporary works as well) 
in a reconstructed oak-and-thatch, open-air, Elizabethan theater.
(Performances may be cancelled because of rain.) You can stand 
(700 £5/$10 seats are available for every performance) or sit on
benches; any discomfort is worth the opportunity to see Shakespeare
performed not far from the original theater and right beside the
Thames. Check out the Web site for current performances.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 301

 The South Bank Arts Centre (South Bank, SE1; Tube: Waterloo) is
home to the Royal National Theatre (% 020/7452-3000; www.
nationaltheatre.org.uk), which performs in three theaters —
the Olivier (1,160 seats), Lyttelton (890 seats), and Cottesloe
(a smaller theater-in-the-round). The Royal National performs
Shakespeare, but it also offers revivals of big Broadway musicals
and new plays. Tickets cost slightly less than at the commercial
theaters on the other side of the river, generally £10 to £40
($20–$80) for evening performances and £9 to £35 ($18–$70) for
matinees. You can get unsold seats at even lower prices two hours
before curtain. The facility also houses cafes, bars, and a good
bookstore. The box office is open Monday through Saturday from
9:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. You can find all performances and an online
booking form on its Web site.
The fringe
In many ways, fringe theater is London’s real theatrical heartbeat. The
fringe, London’s equivalent to New York’s off- or off-off-Broadway, is now
commonly called Off West End. (When my own play, Beardsley, was pro-
duced in London, it was on the fringe.) Groups performing on the fringe
don’t have the big bucks to mount lavish West End productions.
With the overabundance of acting talent in London, the fringe is where
you may see tomorrow’s stars acting today and next season’s hit in its
original, bare-bones form. The plays performed on the fringe are some-
times controversial or experimental, but for true theater lovers, they 
can provide a stimulating alternative to the tradition and glamour of 
the West End.
The performance spaces for fringe productions are usually smaller than
for West End shows (sometimes tiny, sometimes above a pub), and the
ticket prices are usually much lower (rarely more than £12/$24). Fringe
theaters and spaces adapted to fringe productions are scattered far and
wide, so consult a London A–Z or Time Out to find out what’s on and call
the theaters directly for directions on how to find them.

Royal Shakespeare shake-up
The prestigious Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC; % 01789/403-444; www.rsc.
org.uk), headquartered in Stratford-upon-Avon (see Chapter 14), dropped a theatri-
cal bombshell when it announced that it was leaving its long-time London home, the
Barbican Centre, and would mount its London productions in West End theaters. The
RSC now mounts productions in the Gielgud Theatre (Shaftesbury Avenue, W1; 
% 020/7494-5085; www.gielgud-theatre.com; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) and the
Theatre Royal Haymarket (Haymarket, SW1; % 0870/901-3356; www.trh.co.uk;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus).

Outdoor theater
What could be more fun than watching a good play performed under the
stars? The Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre (Inner Circle, Regent’s Park,
NW1; % 020/7486-2431; www.openairtheatre.org; Tube: Baker
Street), located on the north side of Queen Mary’s Rose Garden, has a
May-to-August season. This large venue offers theater seats but no roof,
so rain may cancel the show. Ticket prices range from £10 to £33
($20–$66); you can check out the program on the theater’s Web site.
Shakespeare’s Globe (see the “Major stages beyond the West End” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter) is another venue that’s open to the heavens.
Opera
Two major opera companies call London home. The Royal Opera enjoys
international prestige, performs operas in the original languages, and
boasts the most famous international singers. Its home is the Royal
Opera House (Covent Garden, WC2E; % 020/7304-4000; Tube: Covent
Garden), which recently reopened after a state-of-the-art refurbishment
that added two smaller venues — the Linbury Studio Theatre and the
Glore Studio Theatre. Ticket prices for the grand opera run £10 to £150
($20–$300); 200 tickets in all price ranges are always available on the day
of performance, starting at 10 a.m. For a summary of the opera (and
ballet) season, check the Web site www.royalopera.org. If you have
your heart set on seeing an opera at the Royal Opera, book as far ahead
as you possibly can — I’m talking weeks, not days. The season runs
September through July.
The English National Opera (usually referred to as the ENO) offers more
inventive productions than the Royal Opera. It performs at the freshly
refurbished London Coliseum (St. Martin’s Lane, WC2N; % 0870/145-
0200; Tube: Leicester Square). All the operas are sung in English. Seats
sell for £10 to £79 ($20–$158). The opera season runs September through
July. You can see the ENO program and book online by going to its Web
site at www.eno.org.
The following two venues also offer you the opportunity to see opera
during your time in London:
 The D’Oyly Carte Opera Company (% 020/7793-7100; www.
doylycarte.org.uk): For nearly 150 years, this company has 
been performing the comic operas of Gilbert & Sullivan. Venues
change, and the schedule is irregular; it’s best to check out the
company’s Web site for current information.
 The Holland Park Theatre (Holland Park, W8; % 0845/230-9769;
www.operahollandpark.com; Tube: Holland Park): London’s most
charming stage uses the ruins of a Jacobean mansion in Holland
Park as a backdrop for a mid-June-to-August season of opera and
ballet. Tickets run £10 to £46 ($20–$92). You can view the perform-
ance schedule and book tickets online.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 303

Symphony
London offers some of the world’s finest classical and chamber music.
The home base for the London Symphony Orchestra (www.lso.co.uk)
is the Barbican Hall at the Barbican Centre (Silk Street, EC2Y; % 020/
7638-8891; Tube: Barbican), the concert hall portion of a giant perform-
ing arts complex in the City. They also perform at St. Luke’s, 16 Old St.
(Tube: Old Street). Seats in these acoustically fabulous halls sell for £6 to
£30 ($12–$60). At the Barbican you may also catch a performance by the
Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (www.rpo.co.uk), which plays concerts
here and at the Royal Albert Hall, another all-purpose venue for classical
music.
The Royal Albert Hall (Kensington Gore, SW7; % 020/7589-8212; Tube:
High Street Kensington) is an enormous, circular, domed concert hall
that has been a landmark in South Kensington since 1871. The box office
is open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; ticket prices vary by event.
Wigmore Hall (36 Wigmore St., W1; % 020/7935-2141; Tube: Bond
Street) is a beautifully renovated, century-old concert hall used for
chamber music and solo concerts and recitals. You can find perform-
ance information on the Web at www.wigmore-hall.org.uk.
Concerts by candlelight
Evening candlelit concerts of baroque music are performed weekly 
(usually on Thurs–Sat nights) at 7:30 p.m. in the lovely church of 
St. Martin-in-the-Fields (Trafalgar Square, W1; % 020/7839-8362; www.
stmartins-in-the-fields.org; Tube: Charing Cross; see Chapter 11).
Lunchtime concerts are usually held on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at
1 p.m. Tickets are generally £15 ($30).

Four orchestras, one hall
The biggest and most exciting cultural news in London in 2007 was the reopening of
the newly refurbished Royal Festival Hall, the major concert venue in the South Bank
Centre (Tube: Waterloo). Royal Festival Hall, which first opened in 1951 as part of the
Festival of Britain, is now home to four resident orchestras: the London Philharmonic,
the Philharmonia Orchestra, the London Sinfonietta and the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment. The South Bank Centre is also the home of Queen Elizabeth Hall, a
smaller venue that offers chamber music concerts and dance programs, and the
Purcell Room, an intimate setting used for recitals. You can get tickets and informa-
tion on all three venues at the box office (Foyer, Queen Elizabeth Hall), open daily 10
a.m. to 8 p.m., or online at www.sbc.org.uk; prices vary for each event. For credit
card bookings, call % 0871/663-2500.

Music under the stars
Kenwood House (Hampstead Lane, NW3; % 0870/890-0146; Tube: East
Finchley), a picturesque lakeside estate on Hampstead Heath, is the set-
ting for Kenwood Lakeside Concerts, a series of outdoor concerts held
at 7:30 p.m. on Saturdays in July and August. A free shuttle bus runs
between the East Finchley Tube station and the concert bowl. From
Central London, you need at least 20 minutes to get to the Tube stop and
another 15 minutes for the ride on the shuttle bus. Tickets cost £15 to
£20 ($30–$40). You can find more information online under “Kenwood
House” at www.english-heritage.org.uk. Note: This venue closed in
2007 but was expected to reopen in 2008.
Dance
The Royal Ballet performs at the Royal Opera House, and the English
National Ballet and other visiting companies perform at the London
Coliseum (see the “Opera” section, earlier in this chapter, for details).
Sadler’s Wells (Rosebery Avenue, Islington EC1R; % 020/7863-6000;
Tube: Angel) is well known for its contemporary dance, theater, and
music productions and as a venue for solo performers. Sadler’s Wells 
also manages the Peacock Theatre (Portugal Street, WC2; % 020/7863-
8222; Tube: Covent Garden), a home for dance in the West End, and the
Lillian Baylis Theatre (Arlington Way, EC1; % 020/7713-6000; Tube:
Farringdon), a smaller venue for dance and performance. Programs for 
all three theaters are listed on the Web at www.sadlerswells.com.
The Place Theatre (17 Duke’s Rd., WC1; % 020/7387-0161; www.
theplace.org.uk; Tube: Euston) is the main venue for contemporary
dance in the United Kingdom. Riverside Studios (Crisp Road, W6; % 020/
8237-1111; www.riversidestudios.co.uk; Tube: Hammersmith) is an
arts center that showcases theater, cinema, and dance.
Chapter 15: Applauding the Performing Arts 305
Summer Proms
From mid-July through mid-September, fans of classical and pops concerts attend the
wildly popular concert series called the Proms. Featuring musicians from all over
Europe, Proms concerts are held at the Royal Albert Hall (see the “Symphony” sec-
tion, earlier in this chapter), where they began in 1895. For Proms concerts, all seats
are removed from the orchestra and gallery levels. Reserved seats are available, but
devotees stand for a close look at the orchestras. Starting in July, you can book seats
through the Royal Albert Hall box office at % 020/7589-8212. To get one of the 1,000
standing-room places (£6–£13/$12–$26), you have to queue up on the day of the per-
formance (Door 12, 9 a.m.–9 p.m.). You can check out the Proms schedule on the Web
at www.bbc.co.uk/proms.

Rock concerts
When the rock and pop stars play London, they need a huge arena to
hold their shrieking fans. The two biggest venues are Wembley Stadium
(Empire Way, Wembley, Middlesex; Tube: Wembley Park) and the Earl’s
Court Exhibition Centre (Warwick Road, SW5; Tube: Earl’s Court).
Tickets for large-scale events in these venues are sold through ticket
agencies.
A much smaller (by that I mean less than 70,000 seats) rock and pop
venue is the Carling Academy Brixton (211 Stockwell Rd., SW9; %
020/7771-3000; Tube: Brixton; www.brixton-academy.co.uk).
Another big-event hall is Shepherd’s Bush Empire (Shepherd’s Bush
Green, W12; % 020/7711-3000; www.shepherds-bush-empire.co.uk;
Tube: Shepherd’s Bush). And sometimes the old Royal Albert Hall (see
the “Symphony” section, earlier in this chapter) rocks, too.

Dining before or after the performance
Will you eat dinner before or after going to the theater? Many of the restaurants in the
West End that I review in Chapter 10 serve pre-theater meals. These places are geared
for the theater crowd, so they know your time is limited. Restaurants usually serve
their pre-theater menus from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. The restaurant limits your choices to
a set menu, but you can be done with your meal and out of the restaurant by 7:30 p.m.
or earlier. You find post-theater menus less often; they go into effect around 9:30 p.m.
You can usually find a good value in pre- and post-theater fixed-price menus.
The following restaurants (all of which you can read more about in Chapter 10) are
close to West End theaters and have pre-theater or post-theater menus:
 The Ivy: 1–5 West St., Soho, WC2; % 020/7836-4751; Tube: Leicester Square
 Joe Allen: 13 Exeter St., Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/7836-0651; Tube: Covent
Garden
 Rules: 35 Maiden Lane, Covent Garden, WC2; % 020/7836-5314; Tube: Covent
Garden
 Simpson’s-in-the-Strand: 100 The Strand (next to the Savoy Hotel), WC2; 
% 020/7836-9112; Tube: Charing Cross
Just be certain to book a table beforehand. If you’re dining outside the West End, allot
extra time to order, eat, pay the bill, get your coats, and then hop on the Tube or hail a
taxi to make the curtain.
If you’re not fussy about what you eat and just want to keep your stomach from growl-
ing during the performance, fast food joints are plentiful in Leicester Square and
Piccadilly Circus. And if you’re going farther afield — to the Barbican or South Bank
Centre — you can ward off impending hunger pangs with a light meal or a sandwich
at one of the cafes or restaurants on the premises.

Chapter 16
London’s Best Pubs, 
Clubs, and Bars
In This Chapter
 Getting the lowdown on London pubs
 Searching out your kind of music and dancing
 Getting a dose of British humor
 Unwinding over cocktails
 Staying up late: The real late-night spots
 Finding gay and lesbian nightclubs and bars
M
aybe your idea of a perfect evening is going to an elegant hotel
bar for a cocktail or sitting back in a historic pub and quaffing a
pint of ale. In this chapter, I help you find a fun and fitting nightspot. And
if you need music to make you happy, this chapter can point you in the
direction of your kind of beat. For locations, see the “London Pubs,
Clubs, and Bars” map on p. 308.
Enjoying a Pint: London Pubs
A great way to experience real-life London is to do a pub crawl — that is,
walk from pub to pub and sample the different brews. If you’re accus-
tomed to ordering one particular type of beer with a rather conventional
name, you may be bowled over by the colorful names and vast assort-
ment of British beers on tap in a pub. You can find Brakspears, Courage
Best, Friary Meux, Ind Coope Burton, Old Speckled Hen, and Wadworths
6X, to name just a few. Although you can get a hard drink at both bars
and pubs, when you’re in a pub you’re better off confining yourself to
beer because pubs don’t generally carry all the ingredients necessary
for a fancy cocktail. Of course, if you find just the right pub, you can
order a pint, get comfortable, and even order a good meal (see Chapter
10 for restaurants that serve pub grub).
Opening hours are regulated by Parliament. You can count on most pubs
being open Monday through Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Sunday
noon to 10:30 p.m. Last call is ten minutes before closing, signaled by a bell.

A movement is afoot to abolish the strict pub hours throughout the United
Kingdom. The laws restricting pub hours were passed during World War I
so that munitions workers and others involved in the war effort couldn’t
spend too much time drinking at their “local.” The change requires an Act
of Parliament to deregulate pub hours, but the drinkers who want pubs to
remain open till the wee hours have a great deal of public support.
Remember: Never tip your bartender. Instead, you can offer to buy him
or her a drink.
When you’re in the City, try these pubs (all of which you can see on the
“London Pubs, Clubs, and Bars” map on p. 308):
 Black Friar (174 Queen Victoria St., EC4; % 020/7236-5474; Tube:
Blackfriars) is an Edwardian wonder made of marble and bronze
Art Nouveau. The interior features bas-reliefs of mad monks, a low-
vaulted mosaic ceiling, and seating carved out of gold marble
recesses.
 Olde Mitre (Ely Court, Hatton Garden, EC1; % 020/7405-4751;
Tube: Chancery Lane), named after an inn built on this site in 1547,
is a small pub with an eccentric assortment of customers.
When you’re in West London, check out these pubs (which appear on
the “London Pubs, Clubs, and Bars” map on p. 308):
 Cittie of Yorke (22 High Holborn, WC1; % 020/7242-7670; Tube:
Holborn or Chancery Lane) has the longest bar in Britain and looks
like a great medieval hall — an appropriate look because a pub has
existed at this location since 1430.
 Churchill Arms (119 Kensington Church St., W8; % 020/7727-
4242; Tube: Notting Hill Gate or High Street Kensington) is loaded
with Churchill memorabilia. The pub hosts an entire week of cele-
bration leading up to Sir Winston’s birthday on November 30.
Visitors are often welcomed like regulars here, and you’ll find the
overall ambience to be down-to-earth and homey.
 Ladbroke Arms (54 Ladbroke Rd., W11; % 020/7727-6648; Tube:
Holland Park) strays a bit from a traditional pub environment with
its jazz in the background and rotating art prints, but it makes for a
pleasant stop and a good meal. The pub’s changing menu may
include such items as chicken breast stuffed with avocado and
garlic steak in pink peppercorn sauce.
 Seven Stars (53 Carey St., WC2; % 020/7242-8521; Tube: Holborn)
is a tiny and modest pub with a collection of Toby mugs and law-
related art. You can find the pub at the back of the law courts, so a
lot of barristers drink here — you can pick up some British legal
jargon while having a pint.
For more information on pubs and British beer, see Chapter 2. If you
want to try a truly historic pub, check out my suggestions in Chapter 19.

Focusing on the Music: The Best Jazz 
and Blues Clubs
Small, smoky jazz clubs are common in London. In Soho, Ronnie Scott’s
(47 Frith St., W1; % 020/7439-0747; www.ronniescotts.co.uk; Tube:
Tottenham Court Road) has been London’s preeminent jazz club for
years, with dependably high-caliber performances and some big-name
stars. Bring a full wallet because you have to order food (meals or
snacks) on top of the £15 to £75 ($30–$150) admission.
In Earl’s Court, the 606 Club (90 Lots Rd., SW10; % 020/7352-5953;
www.606club.co.uk; Tube: Earl’s Court or Fulham Broadway) is a base-
ment club where young British jazz musicians play. You have to order
food if you want to drink; to pay the musicians, the establishment adds
to your bill an additional charge of £8 to £12 ($16–$24). You can find
good food and diverse music (Afro-Latin jazz to rap) at the Jazz Café
(5 Parkway, NW1; % 020/7916-6060; Tube: Camden Town). Admission
runs £15 to £20 ($30–$40).
In Soho, try the Pizza Express Jazz Club (10 Dean St., W1; % 020/7439-
8722; www.pizzaexpresslive.co.uk; Tube: Tottenham Court Road).
Big names from the American jazz scene regularly perform in this inti-
mate venue, and you can enjoy pizza, too. The club is open daily 7:45 p.m.
to midnight, and the admission is £15 to £20 ($30–$40). In Knightsbridge,
you can hear mainstream jazz performed in the basement Jazz Room of
Pizza on the Park (11 Knightsbridge, SW1; % 020/7235-5273; Tube:
Hyde Park Corner). The club is open daily from 7:30 p.m., with sets at
9:15 p.m. and 11:15 p.m.; admission is £16 to £20 ($32–$40). Neither
club’s cover charge includes food.
London’s only authentic blues venue is the Ain’t Nothing But Blues Bar
(20 Kingly St., W1; % 020/7287-0514; www.aintnothinbut.co.uk;
Tube: Oxford Circus). The club features local acts and touring American
bands. Expect long lines on weekends. Hours are Monday through
Thursday 6 p.m. to 1 a.m., Friday and Saturday 6 p.m. to 3 a.m., and
Sunday 7:30 p.m. to midnight. Free every night except Friday and
Saturday after 8:30 p.m.; cover charge varies from £5 to £10 ($10–$20).
Laughing the Night Away: Comedy Clubs
The Comedy Store (1A Oxendon St., off Piccadilly Circus, SW1; % 0870/
060-2340 to reserve by phone; www.thecomedystore.co.uk; Tube:
Piccadilly Circus) is London’s best showcase for established and rising
comic talent. Visitors must be 18 or older. Doors open at 6:30 p.m., and
shows start at 8 p.m.; cover charge is £12 to £20 ($24–$40). You can’t
reserve seats, so arrive early to get a good spot. 
Chapter 16: London’s Best Pubs, Clubs, and Bars 311

You can also sample standup, London-style, at the Comedy Cafe (66
Rivington St., EC2; % 020/7739-5706; www.comedycafe.co.uk; Tube:
Old Street). Doors open at 7 p.m., and shows start at 8:30 p.m.; the cover
is £3 to £15 ($6 to $30).
Shaking Your Groove Thing: 
The Best Dance Clubs
London is a large, multicultural city, and its music scene reflects its
diversity. In the London clubs, you can listen to drum ’n’ bass, indie,
Asian underground (or tabla ’n’ bass, as it’s called), chemical beats
(don’t ask), break beats, techno, trance, psychedelic, and many others.
Cover charges vary according to the day of the week and what band is
playing. For more options, check out the music and club listings in Time
Out, a weekly entertainment magazine.
The Complex, in Islington (1–5 Parkfield St., N1; % 020/7288-1986;
Tube: Angel), frequently books live bands. The club has four floors with
different dance vibes on each. Hours are Friday and Saturday 10 p.m. to
7 a.m.; admission is £10 to £12 ($20–$24).
The Equinox (Leicester Square, WC2; % 020/7437-1446; Tube: Leicester
Square) boasts London’s largest dance floor and one of the largest light-
ing rigs in Europe. A diverse crowd dances to equally diverse music,
including dance hall, pop, rock, and Latin. The hours are Monday
through Saturday 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., and the cover is £7 to £12 ($14–$24).
Venom Club/The Zoo Bar (13–17 Bear St., WC2; % 020/7839-4188;
Tube: Leicester Square) features a trendy Euro-androgynous crowd 
and music so loud that you have to use sign language. The club boasts
the slickest, flashiest, most psychedelic decor in London, and even 
35-year-olds come here. The hours are daily 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., and the
cover (charged only after 10 p.m.) is £3 to £5 ($6–$10).
Bar Rumba (36 Shaftesbury Ave., W1; % 020/7287-2715; www.barrumba.
co.uk; Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is all over the map, musically. Every
night, this club features a different type of music, including jazz fusion,
phat funk, hip hop, drum ’n’ bass, soul, R&B, and swing. The minimum
age for admittance is 21 on Saturday and Sunday and 18 Monday through
Friday. Hours are Monday through Thursday 10 p.m. to 3 a.m., Friday 
10 p.m. to 4 a.m., Saturday 9 p.m. to 6 a.m., and Sunday 8 p.m. to 1 a.m.
The cover is £3 to £12 ($6–$24).
The Hanover Grand (6 Hanover St., W1; % 020/7499-7977; Tube:
Oxford Circus) is funky and down and dirty on Thursday, but otherwise,
it’s cutting edge and always crowded. Age and gender are not always
easy to distinguish here. Hours are Monday through Saturday 10 p.m. to
4 a.m., and the cover is £10 to £12 ($20–$24).

312

Housed in a former theater, Koko (1A Camden High St., NW1; no phone;

Unwinding in Elegance: Posh Hotel Bars
Maybe you just want a quiet, romantic spot where you and your sig-
nificant other can enjoy a cocktail and actually talk to one another. Or
perhaps you’re looking for a sophisticated place to enjoy a pre- or post-
theater drink. The following establishments are just the ticket. They’re
located in grand hotels and offer a bit of privacy from the crowds. A
“smart casual” dress code is in effect at these establishments, so leave
your jeans and sneakers in the hotel room.
Bracewells Bar (in the Park Lane Hotel, Piccadilly, W1; % 020/7499-
6321; Tube: Green Park or Hyde Park) is chic and nostalgic, with a plush
décor of Chinese lacquer, comfortable sofas, and soft lighting.
Looking for high ceilings, leather chesterfields, oil paintings, grand win-
dows, and old-world charm? Visit The Library (in the Lanesborough
Hotel, 1 Lanesborough Place, SW1; % 020/7259-5599; Tube: Hyde Park
Corner), one of London’s poshest drinking retreats, known for its collec-
tion of ancient cognacs.
At the Lillie Langtry Bar (in the Cadogan Hotel, Sloane Street, SW1; 
% 020/7235-7141; Tube: Sloane Square or Knightsbridge), you can 
go back in time to the charm and elegance of the Edwardian Era, when
Lillie Langtry, an actress and a society beauty (and a mistress of Edward
VII), lived at the Cadogan (see Chapter 9 for a description of the hotel).
Writer Oscar Wilde — often a guest in Lillie’s home and in this hotel — 
is honored on the drinks menu by his favorite libation, the Hock and
Seltzer.
Seeking Spots for Night Owls
Except for the die-hards in the all-night discos, Londoners retire to bed
fairly early. Restaurants and bars routinely close before midnight. But a
few places in restless, nightclub-heavy Soho stay open late to accommo-
date night owls (you can see these places on the “London Pubs, Clubs,
and Bars” map on p. 308):
 Atlantic Bar & Grill (20 Glasshouse St., W1; % 020/7734-4888;
Tube: Piccadilly Circus) is open for drinks Monday through Saturday
until 3 a.m. You may have to wait in line for a place to sit.
Chapter 16: London’s Best Pubs, Clubs, and Bars 313

 Bar Italia (22 Frith St., W1; % 020/7437-4520; Tube: Tottenham
Court Road) is open 24 hours for coffee and serves a limited snack
menu.
 Café Boheme (13–17 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/7734-0623;
Tube: Tottenham Court Road or Leicester Square) offers a chance
to get a drink Monday through Wednesday until 3 a.m., Sunday until
11:30 p.m., and Thursday through Saturday 24 hours.
Stepping Out: Gay Clubs and Discos
Check the gay listings in Time Out for nightclubs that have dedicated gay
nights. Gay bars and pubs frequently have fliers for reduced-price admis-
sion to big dance venues like G.A.Y.
To be where it’s happenin’, stroll along Old Compton Street in Soho (Tube:
Leicester Square). You may want to duck into Admiral Duncan’s (54 Old
Compton St., W1; % 020/7437-5300) or the two-floor Compton’s of Soho
(53–55 Old Compton St., W1; % 020/7479-7961; www.comptons-of-soho.
co.uk). Both of these gay bars/pubs are Soho institutions, open Monday
through Saturday noon to 11 p.m. and Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m.
The city’s largest women-only bar is the bilevel Glass Bar (West Lodge,
Euston Square Gardens, 190 Euston Rd., NW10; % 020/7387-6184; Tube:
Euston). The bar has a “smart casual” dress code and is open Tuesday
through Friday 5 p.m. until “late,” Saturday 6 p.m. until “late,” and Sunday
2 to 7 p.m.; you can’t get in after 11:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday.
In terms of size, central location, and continued popularity, the best 
gay (and everyone else) disco in London is Heaven (Under the Arches,
Craven Street, WC2; % 020/7930-2020; www.heaven-london.com; 
Tube: Charing Cross or Embankment). The place is open Monday and
Wednesday 10:30 p.m. to 3 a.m., Friday 10:30 p.m. to 6 a.m., and Saturday
10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m. Admission varies from £3 to £10 ($6–$20).

100-016; Tube: Tottenham Court Road) is the biggest gay dance venue 
in Europe. Hours are Saturday 10:30 p.m. to 5 a.m., and admission is 
£10 ($20).

fun and delving deeper into the fascinating city of
London. You can have a wonderful time in London without
reading a word of this part, or you can use this part to

already and you’re ready to expand your explorations, turn to
these chapters for a few super ideas.
I unveil the stories behind ten famous London statues in
Chapter 17. In Chapter 18, I describe ten historic London
churches. In Chapter 19, you get the goods on ten extra-
special London pubs. And in Chapter 20, I introduce you to
ten notable royals.

Striking a Pose: Ten (Or So)
Famous London Statues

Queen Boudicca
U
nlike pigeons, people don’t really pay too much attention to stat-
ues of public figures anymore. The whole idea of casting a bronze
of an important public figure just doesn’t fit with the modern worldview.
Who’d qualify for such an honor in this day and age? In London, the only
person today who may be considered deserving of such a monument is
the late Princess Diana (at least in the general public’s opinion), but it’s
the late Queen Mother who will get the official royal tribute, in the form
of a statue placed off the Mall (Diana got a fountain named after her in
Hyde Park). The city is filled with all sorts of other bronze statues com-
memorating all sorts of individuals from the past. This chapter offers 
ten (or so) statues that you may find interesting or that you may run
into at some point during your London stay and think “Who is that?”
(For the location of each statue, see the “More London Sights” map in
Chapter 11.)
Admiral Lord Nelson
In Trafalgar Square (Tube: Charing Cross), perched atop the 145-foot
Nelson’s Column, one of London’s most famous monuments, is a statue
of (you guessed it) Admiral Lord Nelson. Horatio Viscount Nelson
defeated the French and Spanish at the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar and 
is Britain’s best-known naval hero. On the column, he’s 17 feet high 
(and had to be hoisted up in three sections), but in real life, he was all 
of 5'4" tall. (Also in Trafalgar Square, you can see an equestrian statue of
George IV, who considered himself a gentleman but was nobody’s idea
of a hero.)

Charles I
In 1633, French sculptor Hubert Le Sueur completed the equestrian
statue of Charles I that stands (or rather sits) at the north end of
Whitehall, just south of Trafalgar Square (Tube: Charing Cross). For no
discernable reason, royals seem to have elevated egos and think of
themselves as larger than life. So Charlie, who came in at just 5 feet tall,
had the sculptor tack another foot onto his frame. In real life, alas, the
monarch lost whatever symbolic stature the extra foot gave him when
Cromwell chopped off his head in 1649.
However, history has many strange twists and turns: This statue was
sold to a scrap dealer who was supposed to destroy it but instead
shrewdly buried the piece in his garden. In 1660, when the monarchy
was restored and Charles II ascended the throne, the scrap dealer was
able to sell the new king the undamaged statue. The figure didn’t go up
in its present spot on Whitehall — with a pedestal by great architect Sir
Christopher Wren — until 1765.
Duke of York and Edward VII
Just north of St. James’s Park, at the midpoint of Carlton House Terrace
(Tube: Charing Cross), you can find the Duke of York Monument. Why did
the Duke of York (not Prince Andrew) warrant this massive 7-ton statue?
That’s a very good question that I’m completely unable to answer. He was
the second son of George III (who was on the throne when America gained
its independence from Britain), and when he died, he was massively in
debt. Sir Richard Westmacott’s 1834 sculpture, which rests on a column of
pink granite, was funded by withholding a day’s pay from every soldier in
the Empire. I ask you, was that fair? Some wags have speculated that the
duke’s statue was placed high up so his creditors couldn’t reach him.
The monument looms over Waterloo Place, an enclave of aristocratic ele-
gance and one of London’s greatest examples of urban planning. At the
entrance of Waterloo Place, you find a statue of Edward VII, chiseled by
Sir Bertram Mackennal in 1921 to honor the king who gave his name to the
Edwardian Era. The son of Queen Victoria, “Eddie” had to wait until he
was 60 before he could ascend the throne, and he died nine years later.
But not all is royal in Waterloo Place: You also find a statue dedicated to
the victims of the Crimean War.
Henry VIII
Wouldn’t you say that Henry VIII is England’s best-known king? You may
have “seen” him in plays, movies (such as Anne of the Thousand Days and
A Man for All Seasons), and that great Masterpiece Theatre TV series, The
Six Wives of Henry VIII. Henry VIII was a huge man, with huge appetites,
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
318

and he wouldn’t take no for an answer. (He didn’t have to — he was king.)
The much-married monarch has never been considered anyone’s idea of
a role model, so maybe that explains why London has only one statue of
him. You can see it atop the Henry VIII Gateway on West Smithfield (Tube:
Barbican). In 1702, the stonemasons who built St. Paul’s Cathedral built the
gateway, which commemorates Henry’s giving of St. Bartholomew Hospital
to the city — a gift made possible by his dissolution of the monasteries.
James II and George Washington
Two notable statues flank the main entrance of the National Gallery,
across from Trafalgar Square (Tube: Charing Cross). On the left, you can
see British sculptor Grinling Gibbons’s fine statue of James II, from 1636,
a year after James ascended the throne. Because he immediately levied
new taxes and sought to restore Catholicism to England, this monarch
never caught on in the public popularity polls. In fact, he was ousted
from the throne and spent the rest of his life in exile in France.
The George Washington statue on the right is a Jean Antoine Houdon
replica of a statue in the capitol building in Richmond, Virginia. A gift from
that state, the statue arrived in London with boxes of earth for the base,
so the first American president would always stand on American soil.
Oliver Cromwell
The small garden in front of the Houses of Parliament (Tube: Westminster)
contains a statue of Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of England from 1653
to 1658. This fanatical Puritan led the Parliamentary armies during the Civil
War that dethroned Charles I. Under Cromwell’s “protectorate,” at least
30,000 Irish men, women, and children were massacred, and vast tracts
of Ireland were handed over to the English. Small wonder that Irish mem-
bers of Parliament were outraged when Cromwell’s statue, by Hamo
Thorneycroft, was unveiled in 1899. In fact, Parliament ultimately refused
to pay for it, and Lord Rosebery, the prime minister, shelled out the money
himself. Cromwell, a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other, appears
to be averting his eyes from the bust of Charles I (the king whom he had
beheaded — see “Charles I,” earlier in this chapter), which you can see
across the street above the doorway of St. Margaret’s Westminster church.
Peter Pan
Children love the famous statue of Peter Pan, north of the Serpentine
Bridge in Kensington Gardens (Tube: High Street Kensington). Commis-
sioned in 1912 by Peter Pan’s creator, J. M. Barrie, the bronze sculpture
by George Frampton marks the spot where Peter Pan touched down in
the gardens. Of course, this kid could fly — he didn’t have to take the
Tube like the rest of us.
Chapter 17: Striking a Pose: Ten (Or So) Famous London Statues 319

Peter Pan was an adored fantasy hero long before he became a psycho-
logical syndrome for men who refuse to grow up. He was to children of
earlier generations what Harry Potter is to the kids of today. Maybe
someday there’ll be a Harry Potter statue in King’s Cross Station.
Prince Albert
Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (a name that the royals changed to
Windsor at the onset of World War I) was the handsome German consort
of Queen Victoria. When he died at age 42 in 1861, the grief-stricken
queen donned the black widow’s weeds she wore for the rest of her long
life. London has two statues of Prince Albert. You can find one at the
rejuvenated Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens (see Chapter 11).
The other stands in the center of Holborn Circus (Tube: Holborn). The
latter has been dubbed “the politest statue in London” because the
prince is raising his hat.
Queen Boudicca
Who, you may wonder, is the superwoman in the horse-drawn chariot at
the north end of Westminster Bridge (Tube: Westminster)? She’s Queen
Boudicca (or Boadicea), that’s who, with her fearless warrior-daughters.
“Bo” was a fierce Celtic queen who fought back the invading Romans and
died in A.D. 60. Thomas Hornicraft created the sculpture in the 1850s; the
figure was placed at its current site in 1902. For more on Queen
Boudicca, turn to Chapter 20.
Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln
Parliament Square (Tube: Westminster) boasts more outdoor sculptures
than any other place in London. Unless you’re a student of British his-
tory, most of the bronze gentlemen (Sir Robert Peel, Benjamin Disraeli,
the 14th Earl of Derby, and General Jan Smuts) ranged around the
square won’t mean anything to you.
But you may recognize two of them. Sir Winston Churchill, the prime
minister during World War II (you can find info on the Cabinet War
Rooms, which Churchill used during the war, in Chapter 11), is at his
most bulldoggish in Ivor Roberts-Jones’s 1975 sculpture, standing in the
square’s northeast corner.
A statue of Abraham Lincoln, by Augustus Saint-Gaudens, stands across
the street on the west side of the square. The statue of America’s 16th
president was a gift from the city of Chicago, which has the 1887 original
in Lincoln Park.

Ten Noteworthy 
London Churches

 Finding the Dickens link
 Checking out a Roman ruin
W
estminster Abbey and St. Paul’s Cathedral (both of which you
can read about in Chapter 11) are giant repositories of English
history and get the lion’s share of visitor attention in London. But the
city boasts scores of smaller churches also worth visiting. The area
known as the City of London is especially rich in neoclassical churches
designed by Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723) after the disastrous Great
Fire of 1666. One of England’s greatest architects, and certainly its most
prolific, Wren designed St. Paul’s.
This chapter explores ten London churches that you may want to check
out on your ramblings around town. (For their locations, see the “More
London Sights” map in Chapter 11.)
Church of St. Bartholomew the Great
On the east side of Smithfield Square, EC1 (Tube: Barbican), you can see
a rare 16th-century gatehouse, and perched atop the gatehouse sits an
even rarer late-16th-century timber-frame house predating the Great Fire.
The gatehouse opens onto the grounds of the Church of St. Bartholomew
the Great, a little-visited gem that just happens to be the oldest parish
church in London. The church was part of an Augustinian priory founded
in 1123. Over the centuries, the building has somewhat miraculously
escaped major damage — despite being used at various times as stables
and a printing office (where Benjamin Franklin worked in 1725). The

15th-century cloisters are to your right as you enter. Inside the church is
a “weeping” 17th-century statue of Edward Cooke (the marble condenses
moisture from the air); the tomb of Rahere, the priory’s founder; and a
lovely oriel (projecting bay) window.
If you leave the churchyard by using the gate in the far-right corner, you
come out on Cloth Fair, a street with gabled houses from 1604. Like St.
Bartholomew’s, they’re among the very few surviving buildings predat-
ing the disastrous Great Fire that leveled much of London in 1666.
Church of St. Stephen Walbrook
Walbrook, EC4 (Tube: Cannon Street), a lane in the heart of the City, was
the site of a brook that was paved over in medieval times. Today, the
lane houses the Church of St. Stephen Walbrook, one of Sir Christopher
Wren’s finest works. By the 18th century, the fame of this church had
spread throughout Europe, and many still consider it the most beautiful
church in London. Its splendid dome served as a model for the one at St.
Paul’s Cathedral. The travertine altar beneath the dome was sculpted in
1956 by British sculptor Henry Moore, who had reservations about tack-
ling the job because he was an agnostic. “Henry, I’m not asking you to
take the service,” said the rector who offered Moore the commission. “I
understand that you’re a bit of a chiseler; just do your job.”
St. Botolph’s
I think it’s appropriate to include in this chapter a church dedicated to
England’s patron saint of travelers: St. Botolph’s on Aldersgate Street,
EC1 (Tube: Barbican), close to the Museum of London (see Chapter 11).
The church interior has a fine barrel-vaulted roof. Actually, three city
churches are dedicated to St. Botolph, and all are located beside now-
vanished gates into the city. At one time, instead of being greeted by
ATMs and currency-exchange windows, travelers could pause and give
thanks to Botolph for their safe journey to London.
St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West
The octagonal St. Dunstan’s-in-the-West, on Fleet Street, EC4 (Tube:
Temple), is a fine early example of Gothic Revival architecture. That style
was in fashion when an earlier church that survived the Great Fire of
1666 was replaced between 1829 and 1833. The large clock on the tower
is something of a historical curiosity: The clock dates from 1671 and was
installed by the congregation as an offering of thanks because the church
hadn’t burned down. Every 15 minutes, two giant clubs strike a bell that
has been tolling for more than 330 years. People take clocks, watches,
and timepieces for granted nowadays, but this clock was the first in
London to have a double face and to have minutes marked on the dial.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
322

St. George the Martyr Church
In Southwark, next to the remains of Marshalsea Prison on Borough High
Street, SE1 (Tube: Borough), you can find St. George the Martyr Church.
The church is probably more famous for its literary associations than
for any beauty of the structure itself. This church is where Dickens’s fic-
tional heroine Little Dorrit is baptized and, at one point, is forced to
spend the night when she’s locked out of the Marshalsea debtors’ prison;
later she’s married in this church. A stained-glass window in the east
wall shows her at prayer.
St. Margaret’s Westminster
St. Margaret’s Westminster, the parish church of the House of Commons
since 1614, is on St. Margaret Street, SW1 (Tube: Westminster), and is
often mistaken for Westminster Abbey next door. St. Margaret’s is notable
for its glorious above-the-altar East Window, the stained glass of which
was presented by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain to com-
memorate the marriage of their daughter, Catherine of Aragon, to Arthur,
the son of Henry VII. By the time the glass arrived, Arthur had died and
Henry VIII, his younger brother, had wed Catherine, the first of his eight
wives. (He divorced her to marry Anne Boleyn.) The weddings of poet
John Milton (1656) and statesman (and future prime minister) Winston
Churchill (1908) were held in this church.
St. Martin-in-the-Fields
St. Martin-in-the-Fields, on Trafalgar Square, WC2 (Tube: Charing Cross),
was a stylistic prototype for hundreds of churches constructed in 18th-
century New England. James Gibbs, who was influenced by the churches
of Sir Christopher Wren, designed the church in 1726. Furniture designer
Thomas Chippendale, painters Sir Joshua Reynolds and William Hogarth,
and Nell Gwynn, mistress of Charles II, are buried within. For details about
the concerts held here, see the description of St. Martin in Chapter 11.
St. Mary-le-Bow
Established in the 11th century, St. Mary-le-Bow, on Bow Lane, EC4 (Tube:
Mansion House), is one of London’s most venerable churches. The struc-
ture that originally stood here was a casualty of the Great Fire of 1666;
the steepled church that you see today is a work by Sir Christopher Wren,
who modeled it after Rome’s Church of the Basilica of Maxentius. Accord-
ing to tradition, a true Cockney (a native of the East End of London) is
someone born within hearing distance of the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow. 
In the churchyard’s garden is a statue of Captain John Smith, a one-
time parishioner who left London to become one of the first settlers of
Jamestown, Virginia. (He’s the one who was saved by Pocahontas.)
Chapter 18: Making Amens: Ten Noteworthy London Churches 323

Southwark Cathedral
Southwark Cathedral, on Montague Close, SE1 (Tube: London Bridge),
is one of the oldest buildings in Southwark and also one of the most
beautiful (see Chapter 11). A church has occupied this site for at least 
a thousand years; before that, a Roman villa stood here.
London’s second-oldest church, after Westminster Abbey, Southwark
Cathedral, in the 12th century, was the first Gothic church to be erected
in London. Today, you can see the 15th-century cathedral (with Victorian
restorations) that once served London’s rowdy South Bank theater dis-
trict. Chaucer and Shakespeare both worshiped here, and Shakespeare’s
brother Edmund was buried here in 1607.
Besides a memorial to the immortal bard, the church contains a 13th-
century wooden effigy of a knight, one of the oldest surviving wooden
effigies in England. John Harvard, founder of Harvard University, was
baptized in this church.
Temple of Mithras
Not far from St. Stephen Walbrook (see “Church of St. Stephen Walbrook,”
earlier in this chapter), at the entrance to Temple Court on Queen Victoria
Street (Tube: Mansion House), you can find the remains of what’s proba-
bly London’s oldest church site. This church isn’t a Christian church,
however, but a 3rd-century Roman temple. Unearthed during 1954 exca-
vations and raised to its present level, the Temple of Mithras is shaped
like a tiny Christian basilica with a central nave and two aisles.
The Mithraic cult, which had its origins in Persia and was brought to
London by Roman soldiers in the 2nd century, used this temple. At one
time, when the Roman Empire still ruled the Western world, Mithraism
was as popular as Christianity. Archaeologists speculate that the pagan
temple was destroyed in the 4th century, when Christianity became the
official religion of the Empire. Some of the sculptures that were found in
the temple are displayed in the Museum of London (see Chapter 11).

Ale’s Well That Ends Well:
Ten Historic London Pubs
In This Chapter
 Enjoying some pub history
 Finding a pub with character
P
ublic houses, better known as pubs, have been a way of life in
London and throughout the United Kingdom for centuries. Chapters
2, 10, and 16 offer information about London pubs. But I could write an
entire book just on the pubs of London — the city has hundreds of them.
Not all these pubs are old, of course, and not all have the kind of charac-
ter that accumulates over centuries of drinking, talking, smoking, and
eating. But dozens upon dozens of these pubs date back anywhere from
a century to more than 400 years.
This chapter offers descriptions of ten more pubs. Each of these places
has some special story, history, or association attached to it. (For their
locations, see the “London Pubs, Clubs, and Bars” map in Chapter 16.)
All these pubs are open regular pub hours (Mon–Sat 11 a.m.–11:30 p.m.);
some are open Sunday noon to 10:30 p.m. And as of 2007, smoking is no
longer permitted in any of them.
Anchor Inn
Eighteenth-century figures, such as Samuel Johnson, who produced the
first Dictionary of the English Language, playwright Oliver Goldsmith,
whose most famous work is She Stoops to Conquer, and painter Sir Joshua
Reynolds, the first president of the Royal Academy, frequented the
Anchor Inn (34 Park Street, SE1; % 020/7407-1577; Tube: Southwark). It
has a nice riverside terrace.
Coal Hole
Opened in the early 19th century, the Coal Hole (91 The Strand, WC2; 
% 020/7379-9883; Tube: Covent Garden) got its name from the coal

haulers who unloaded their cargo on the Thames nearby. One of Central
London’s larger pubs, the Coal Hole has many theatrical connections
because of its West End location. Famous mid-19th-century Shakespearean
actor Edmund Kean used to hire rowdies, get them drunk here, and then
send them off to heckle his rivals in other theaters.
George Inn
You can find one of the city’s most historically important pubs in the
George Inn (in George Inn Yard off Borough High Street, SE1; % 020/
7407-2056; Tube: Borough). It’s the last remaining example in London of
an old-style coaching inn, with balconies (called galleries) around the
inner court. The George was doing business during the reign of Henry
VIII, and some claim it actually dates back to Chaucer’s era.
King’s Head and Eight Bells
Chelsea’s intimate, clublike King’s Head and Eight Bells (50 Cheyne
Walk, SW3; % 020/7352-1820; Tube: Sloane Square) opened more than
400 years ago, around 1580. Back then, of course, the area was rural;
Henry VIII’s country house stood nearby. Later, celebrated artists and
writers, such as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Thomas Carlyle (whose house 
is now a museum; see Chapter 11), Oscar Wilde, Laurence Olivier, and
Vivien Leigh made their homes in Chelsea, one of the prettiest (and now
one of the most expensive) parts of London. The neighborhood’s still
filled with literary and other luminaries, so keep your eyes open if you
stop in here. You never know who may pop in.
Lamb and Flag
The Lamb and Flag (33 Rose St., WC2; % 020/7497-9504; Tube: Leicester
Square) was once known by the grisly name “Bucket of Blood” because
prizefighters battered one another into a bloody pulp during matches
held for betting customers. The pub, a rare survivor of the Great Fire of
1666, has a couple of literary associations to offset its unsavory past. In
the 19th century, this place was one of Charles Dickens’s favorite tav-
erns. A couple of centuries earlier, poet John Dryden was attacked and
beaten just outside, probably because of a lampoon that he directed at
the earl of Rochester. Every year on December 16, the pub commemo-
rates the anniversary of the attack with a Dryden Night.
Red Lion Public House
Civil servants and members of Parliament (MPs) frequent the Red 
Lion Public House (48 Parliament St., SW1; % 020/7930-5826; Tube:
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
326

Westminster). So many MPs stop in here that the pub rings a special 
bell before a vote is taken, allowing the lawmakers to get back in time.
Charles Dickens stopped in once for a pint of beer — he was 11 years
old at the time. (Life was different back then.)
Salisbury
I’m partial to the Salisbury (90 St. Martin’s Lane, WC2; % 020/7836-5863;
Tube: Leicester Square) because I used to hang out there. The pub sits
right in the heart of the West End theater district, dates from 1852, and
has a beautifully preserved Art Nouveau interior with marble fittings,
cut-glass mirrors, and brass statuettes. Like the Lamb and Flag noted
earlier, the Salisbury was once famous for bare-knuckle prizefights —
but that was long before my time.
Williamson’s Tavern
Williamson’s Tavern (in Groveland Court, off Bow Lane, EC4; % 020/
7248-6280; Tube: St. Paul’s) was the residence of the lord mayor of the
City of London before the nearby Mansion House was built. The tavern
stands behind a 17th-century gate presented to the lord mayor by
William and Mary. The building later served as an inn. Inside, you can
have a drink and one of its famous steak sandwiches.
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese
Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese (Wine Office Court, 145 Fleet St., EC4; % 020/
7353-6170; Tube: Blackfriars) was established in 1667, but a tavern stood
on this site as early as 1590 (see Chapter 11). The earlier tavern burned
down in the Great Fire of 1666 and was quickly rebuilt — in fact, Ye Old
Cheshire Cheese was the first pub to reopen after the fire. Downstairs,
you can see charred wooden beams bearing witness to the massive fire
that destroyed a large portion of London. This pub was one of Charles
Dickens’s favorite hangouts, and he usually sat at a table to the right of
the fireplace on the first floor.
Ye Olde Watling
Ye Olde Watling (29 Watling St., EC4; % 020/7653-6252; Tube: Mansion
House) is a 17th-century pub that the great architect Sir Christopher
Wren used as an office when St. Paul’s Cathedral was being constructed.
The pub was built from timber taken from dismantled sailing ships.

Ten Important Royals —
Past and Present
In This Chapter
 Meeting a few notable royals
 Noting changes in rulers and ruling over two millennia
I
am not a royalist, but the kings and queens of England fascinate me.
These are people whose lives encapsulated ultimate power and
humiliating defeat, people who killed to stay on the throne and were
killed by others who wanted it, people who inspired their subjects and
treated them like dirt, people who sometimes changed the course of his-
tory and sometimes disgraced the nation they ruled.
I had a hard time choosing just ten, but in the thumbnail sketches that
follow, you can get at least a glimpse of how the rulers of England — and
the rule of England — have changed over the past 2,000 years.
Queen Boudicca (A.D. 30?– A.D. 60):
Braveheart of the Britons
I’ve always thought Boudicca’s story would make a fantastic film, but
who would play this fierce Celtic queen who painted her face blue and
led 100,000 British troops against the invading Romans in A.D. 60?
Angelina Jolie?
Boudicca’s story harks back to the earliest period of Britain’s recorded
history. Historians think that she was born about A.D. 30. In A.D. 48, she
married Prasutagus, king of the Iceni, and bore him two daughters. The
Iceni were a Celtic tribe that had been made a Roman client-state in A.D.
43. When Prasutagus died, he left his kingdom — as required by Roman
law — to the Roman emperor. But hoping to provide for his two daugh-
ters, he left a portion of his personal estate to them. For the Romans, that
inheritance gave them a perfect excuse to confiscate all of Prasutagus’s
belongings and punish the Iceni for “disobeying” Roman law. Just days

after her husband’s death, Boudicca was stripped and publicly whipped,
her teenaged daughters raped by Roman soldiers.
The outrages committed by the invading foreigners changed Boudicca’s
life forever. As more Roman troops arrived to begin the job of conquer-
ing all the native Britons, Boudicca managed to raise an army among for-
merly warring local tribes. The Celts were much feared by the Romans
because Celtic women fought alongside the men, painting their faces
blue to frighten the enemy and uttering terrifying shrieks as they attacked
with swords, axes, and clubs. Boudicca and her army marched to Roman
forts and settlements, laid waste to them, and killed their inhabitants.
Finally, at a site that was probably somewhere in the West Midlands,
Boudicca faced the army of Suetonus Paulinus, the Roman governor of
Britannia. She had more troops, but Suetonius and his legionnaires had the
discipline that helped Rome conquer the Western world. The Celts under
Boudicca were slaughtered. No one knows what happened to Boudicca
herself. Some accounts say that she took poison. The alternative, had she
lived, would have been worse. She would have been paraded in chains at a
public triumph in Rome and then publicly tortured in the Coliseum.
Next time you’re crossing Westminster Bridge in London, look up and you
can see a bronze statue of Boudicca on the north side. A mid-19th-century
work by Thomas Hornicraft, it shows a wild-haired superwoman in a
horse-drawn chariot with her two daughters.
Alfred the Great (849–899): 
A Warrior and a Scholar
If you make a trip to Winchester, the capital of the old Anglo-Saxon king-
dom of Wessex, you can see a statue of Alfred the Great on Bridge Street.
Alfred is the only English monarch to carry the title “the Great,” and that
alone makes him an intriguing character. His story goes back to the 9th
century A.D. when the Danes, more commonly known as the Vikings,
were relentlessly attacking and terrorizing England.
Youngest son of King Æthelwulf, Alfred became king of Wessex in 871.
Wessex was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom patched together in southern and
southwestern England after the departure of the Romans in A.D. 410.
Following a series of attacks led by the Dane Guthorm, Alfred finally
defeated the Danes decisively at the Battle of Eddington. As a condition
of the peace treaty, Guthorm withdrew his forces from Wessex and
Alfred recognized Danish control over East Anglia and parts of Mercia.
This partition of England was called the Danelaw, and though the
English kings soon brought the Danelaw back under their rule, they did
not attempt to interfere with the laws and customs of the area, many of
which survived until after the Norman Conquest in 1066.
Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 329

Alfred created a series of fortifications to surround his kingdom and 
provide security from invasion. You can still find traces of burh, the
Anglo-Saxon word for these forts, in the common English place-name
suffix –bury. The reign of Alfred was known for more than military suc-
cess, however. He promoted better education and helped make learning
important in an age when education had gone into a decline because of
Danish looting of monasteries and churches, traditional centers of learn-
ing. Alfred was also a codifier of law and a patron of the arts. A warrior
and a scholar, he translated Latin books into the Anglo-Saxon tongue.
With the kind of leadership that he provided, it’s no wonder he was pro-
claimed “the Great.”
William the Conqueror (1028–1087): 
Winner Takes All
The illegitimate son of the Duke of Normandy, William received the
duchy of Normandy upon his father’s death in 1035. He spent the next
several years consolidating his strength on the Continent through mar-
riage, diplomacy, war, and savage intimidation. By 1066, Normandy was
in a position of virtual independence from William’s feudal lord, Henry I
of France, and the disputed succession in England offered William an
opportunity for invasion.
When Edward the Confessor died childless, the English crown was
offered to Harold Godwinson (an Anglo-Saxon), even though Edward had
purportedly promised the throne to William, his second cousin. Insisting
that Harold had sworn allegiance to him in 1064, William prepared for
battle. But as the new King Harold anxiously awaited William’s arrival on
England’s south shores, Harold Hardrada, the king of Norway, invaded
England from the north. Harold’s forces marched north to defeat the
Norse at Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066. Two days after the
battle, William landed unopposed at Pevensey, forcing Harold to move
south to a new battle. What has come to be known as the Battle of
Hastings took place on October 14, 1066. Harold and his brothers died
fighting, thus removing any further organized Anglo-Saxon resistance to
the Normans. The Anglo-Saxon earls and bishops soon submitted and
crowned him William I on Christmas Day, 1066.
William’s acquisitive nature never left him. His forces ruthlessly crushed
uprisings until, by 1072, the whole of England was conquered and united.
William confiscated lands and reallocated them to the Normans. In 1085,
William commissioned the Domesday Book to survey land ownership,
assess property, and establish a tax base. Although he began his inva-
sion with papal support, William refused to let the Church dictate policy
within English and Norman borders. Ruthless and cruel, the Conqueror
exacted a high toll from his subjects, but he also laid the foundation for
the economic and political success of England. Buildings from his reign
include Windsor Castle and the Tower of London (both of which you can
read about in Chapter 11), but you can find perhaps the most atmospheric

reminder of William the Conqueror in Battle, a town in Sussex, where
you can visit the battlefield that was William’s first conquest in England.
Henry II (1133–1189): Family Plots
Henry II, the first Plantagenet king, was one of the most effective of
England’s monarchs, refining Norman government and creating a self-
standing bureaucracy that could keep the country running even if it 
had a weak or incompetent monarch. But Henry’s personal life was one
unending soap opera, with more plots and counterplots than I can possi-
bly detail here.
A grandson of Henry I, Henry was raised in the French province of
Anjou. His vast continental possessions more than doubled when he
married Eleanor of Aquitane, the ex-wife of King Louis VII of France.
Eleanor was 11 years older than Henry and was rumored to have slept
with his father. Crowned King of England in October 1154, Henry was
technically a feudal vassal of the king of France but, in reality, owned
more territory and was more powerful than his French lord.
Throughout his reign, Henry instituted reforms meant to weaken 
traditional feudal ties and strengthen his position, but in the process 
of strengthening the royal courts, he became involved in the murder 
of his best friend, Thomas Beckett. The church courts instituted by
William the Conqueror had become a safe haven for criminals, and
Henry wanted to transfer sentencing in such cases to the royal courts.
Thomas Beckett, named archbishop of Canterbury in 1162, vehemently
opposed the weakening of church courts. He also angered Henry by
opposing the coronation of Henry’s eldest son. When an exasperated
Henry publicly conveyed his desire to be rid of the contentious arch-
bishop, four thuggish knights took the king at his word and murdered
Beckett in his own cathedral on December 29, 1170. (You can see the
exact spot if you visit Canterbury Cathedral; see Chapter 14.)
Henry’s plans for dividing his myriad lands and titles evoked treachery
from his sons, who, with the encouragement of their mother, repeatedly
rebelled against their father. Eleanor, equally ruthless and scheming, was
kept a virtual prisoner for 16 years. Henry died in 1189, two days after
being attacked and defeated by his son Richard, with the assistance of
Philip II Augustus of France, forcing Henry to accept a humiliating peace.
Henry VIII (1491–1547): 
Take My Wife — Please!
The significance of Henry’s reign is generally overshadowed by his six
marriages, a record topped only by Elizabeth Taylor. Something is scar-
ily pathological about Henry’s many marriages, even if they were in pur-
suit of an elusive male heir.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
332
His first wife was Catherine of Aragon (widow of his brother, Arthur),
whom he married in 1509 and divorced in 1533; the union produced one
daughter, Mary. Henry married the pregnant Anne Boleyn in 1533; she
gave him another daughter, Elizabeth, but was executed in 1536 on
trumped-up charges of infidelity, a treasonous charge in the king’s con-
sort but never for the king. The same month that Anne was beheaded,
the monarch married Jane Seymour, who died giving birth to Henry’s
lone male heir, Edward, in October 1536. After viewing Hans Holbein’s
beautiful portrait of the German princess Anne of Cleves, Henry arranged
a marriage with her early in 1540. When Anne arrived, however, Henry
found her so homely that he never consummated the marriage. In 1540,
with Anne scratched off the list, he married Catherine Howard, who was
executed for infidelity two years later and reputedly haunts Hampton
Court Palace to this day. Catherine Parr became Henry’s sixth and last
wife in 1543, and she provided for the needs of both Henry and his chil-
dren until his death in 1547.
So what did Henry do besides bed and wed? Most notably, he altered
England and the whole of Western Christendom by separating the Church
of England from Roman Catholicism. The separation actually happened
because of Henry’s obsession with producing a male heir. When Catherine
of Aragon failed to produce a male, Henry sought an annulment from the
pope in order to marry Anne Boleyn. When Cardinal Wolsey failed to
secure a legal annulment, Henry summoned the Reformation Parliament,
which passed 137 statutes in seven years, influencing political and eccle-
siastical affairs in a way previously unknown. By 1536, all ecclesiastical
and government officials were required to publicly approve of the break
with Rome and take an oath of loyalty. Henry’s dissolution of the monas-
teries filled royal coffers, as revenues from the sale of monastic lands
went either to the crown or to the nobility. The break with Rome, cou-
pled with an increase in governmental bureaucracy, led to the royal
supremacy that lasted until the execution of Charles I and the establish-
ment of the Commonwealth a century after Henry’s death.
Elizabeth I (1533–1603): Heart 
and Stomach of a King
In contrast to her much-married father, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I never wed
and was known as the Virgin Queen. When she ascended the throne in
1558, dissension between Catholics and Protestants tore at the very
foundation of society, and the royal treasury had been bled dry by Mary,
Elizabeth’s Catholic half-sister, and Mary’s advisors.
Instead of being a fanatic like Mary, Elizabeth was strong-willed, tolerant,
and intelligent. In religious matters, she devised a compromise that 
basically reinstated her father’s Protestant reforms. Another potentially
volatile problem was her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots, who gained the
loyalty of Catholic factions and instituted several plots to assassinate or

overthrow Elizabeth. After irrefutable evidence of Mary’s involvement in
such plots came to light, Elizabeth sadly succumbed to the pressure
from her advisors and had the Scottish princess executed in 1587.
The persecution of continental Protestants forced Elizabeth into war, a
situation which she desperately tried to avoid. She sent an army to aid
French Huguenots (Calvinists who had settled in France) after a 1572
massacre in which over 3,000 Huguenots lost their lives, and she
assisted Belgium in its bid to gain independence from Spain. After
Elizabeth rejected a marriage proposal from Philip II of Spain, the indig-
nant Spanish monarch, incensed by English piracy and forays in the New
World, sent his much-feared Armada to raid England. “I know I have but
the body of a weak and feeble woman,” Elizabeth told her troops, “but I
have the heart and stomach of a king.” England won the naval battle and
emerged as the world’s strongest naval power.
In many ways, Elizabeth’s reign has come to be regarded as a Golden
Age. Literature bloomed through the works of Spenser, Marlowe, and
Shakespeare. Francis Drake and Walter Raleigh expanded English influence
in the New World. Elizabeth’s religious compromise laid many fears to rest
and sought to avoid murderous strife. Fashion and education came to the
fore because of Elizabeth’s penchant for knowledge, courtly behavior, and
extravagant dress. Good Queen Bess, as she came to be called, maintained
a regal air until the day she died, at 70 years of age and after a very suc-
cessful 44-year reign. Few English monarchs enjoyed such political power
while still maintaining the devotion of the whole of English society.
George III (1738–1820): “My Lords 
and Peacocks . . . ”
George III was in no way an exemplary ruler, but I’ve long been fascinated
by him because he was king at the time of the American Revolution and
because he went mad. The only thing he really excelled at was procre-
ation. He married Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1761, and the pro-
lific couple produced 15 children.
George was descended from the Hanoverian (German) line of succession
that first came to the English throne in 1714. Determined to recover
royal prerogatives lost to the Whig Party by George I and George II,
George III methodically weakened the Whigs through bribery, coercion,
and patronage, hand-picking yes-men of mediocre talent and servile
minds to serve as cabinet members.
George’s commitment to taxing the American colonies to pay for military
protection led to hostilities in 1775. The colonists proclaimed independ-
ence in 1776, but George obstinately continued the war until the final
American victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Treaty of Paris, signed in
1783, ensured British acknowledgment of the United States of America.
Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 333

Bouts with madness (attributed to a disease called porphyria) and the
way he handled the American Revolution eroded his support.
Other major events and people marked George III’s reign. The British
Army under the Duke of Wellington (whose London residence, Apsley
House, you can visit; see Chapter 11) and the British Navy under Lord
Horatio Nelson (honored by Nelson’s Column in London’s Trafalgar
Square; see Chapter 11) defeated French forces under Napoleon. England
also went to war again with the United States between 1812 and 1814,
this time over the British practice of pressing American seamen into
service in the British Navy.
It’s safe to say that by the time he began an address with “My Lords and
Peacocks,” it was time for George to step down. Personal rule was given
to his son George, the prince regent, in 1811. George III died blind, deaf,
and mad at Windsor Castle (see Chapter 11) on January 29, 1820. You
can see Kew Palace, his favorite residence, on a visit to the Royal
Botanic Gardens (also known as Kew Gardens; see Chapter 11).
George IV (1762–1830): A Dandy King 
for the Regency
George IV, eldest son of George III and Charlotte, was the antithesis of his
father (are you starting to see a pattern here?): conservative in his infre-
quent political involvement and licentious in affairs of the heart. As
prince regent, he had many mistresses until he secretly married the
Catholic widow Maria Fitzherbert in 1785. When George III found out
about it, he had the marriage declared illegal because his son would
have been ineligible to reign with a Catholic wife. In 1795, George IV mar-
ried again, this time to his cousin Caroline of Brunswick, who was some-
thing of a slob and whom he detested. Caroline took their only child and
moved to Italy, returning to England to claim the rights of queen when
George succeeded his father in 1820. George created one of the greatest
scandals of his reign when he had Caroline barred from his coronation.
Bright, witty, and able on the one hand, indolent, spoiled, and lazy on
the other, George was in some ways the psychological forerunner of
many modern royals. Although he was scandalous with his mistresses
and extravagant in his spending, he was also a patron of the arts and
donated his father’s immense book collection as the foundation of the
British Museum Library. His penchant for building projects inspired the
Regency style of architecture, at its most fanciful in the Royal Pavilion in
Brighton (see Chapter 14). But his extravagances came at a time of
social distress and general misery, following the Napoleonic Wars and
the tremendous changes brought forth by the Industrial Revolution. He
was basically a party boy who couldn’t transcend his sense of royal enti-
tlement to provide true leadership.

Chapter 20: Ten Important Royals — Past and Present 335
Queen Victoria (1819–1901): 
Mother of Monarchs
Victoria, who gave her name to an era, was the daughter of Edward,
Duke of Kent and Strathearn, and Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld. Her
father died when she was an infant, and her mother enacted a strict regi-
men that turned its back on the scandal-ridden courts of Victoria’s
uncles, George IV and William IV. Popular respect for the Crown was at a
low point at her coronation in 1837, but the modest and straightforward
young queen, just 18 years old, eventually won the hearts of her sub-
jects. She refused any further influence from her domineering mother,
and though she had no direct input in policy decisions, she wanted to be
informed of political matters. (After the Reform Act of 1832, legislative
authority resided in the House of Lords, with executive authority resting
within a cabinet formed by members of the House of Commons; the
monarch was essentially powerless.)
Victoria married Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg in 1840, a marriage that
was apparently happy and certainly fecund: She bore nine children. The
public, however, was not fond of Victoria’s German prince, and Albert
was excluded from holding any official political position, was never
granted a title, and was named prince consort only after 17 years of mar-
riage. Victoria did nothing without her husband’s approval. His interests
in art, science, and industry spurred him to organize the Crystal Palace
Exhibition in 1851, a highly profitable industrial convention whose pro-
ceeds were used to purchase lands in Kensington for the establishment
of several museums (one of which is the Victoria & Albert Museum; see
Chapter 11). Following his death from typhoid in 1861, Victoria went into
seclusion for more than 25 years, not emerging until the Golden Jubilee
of 1887. An entire generation had never seen the face of their queen. In
that period, she had the Albert Memorial erected in Kensington Gardens
(see Chapter 11).
During her reign, the British Empire doubled in size, encompassing
Australia, Canada, India, and various locales in Africa and the South
Pacific. Victoria was named Empress of India in 1878. England’s success
in avoiding European conflicts for almost a century (1815–1914, the
Crimean War of 1853–1856 being the major exception) was due, in large
part, to the marriages Victoria arranged for her children. Either directly
or by marriage, she was related to the royal houses of Belgium, Denmark,
Germany, Greece, Norway, Romania, Russia, and Sweden. Nicholas II of
Russia married Victoria’s granddaughter Alexandra, and the dreaded
emperor of Germany, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was her grandson “Willy.”
The era we now call Victorian England was one in which the queen’s
rigid ethics and uninspired personal tastes generally reflected those 
of the middle class. When she died of old age, an entire era died 
with her.

Queen Elizabeth II (1926–): 
Monarchy Amidst Media
Elizabeth II, who became queen in 1952, is the best known of the seven
remaining monarchs in Europe. The eldest daughter of George VI and
Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, she married a distant cousin, Philip Mountbatten,
in 1947 and had four children: Charles, Prince of Wales; Anne; Andrew;
and Edward. (For an account of some recent royal scandals involving
Elizabeth’s kids and grandkids, see Chapter 2.)
In the modern world, where wealth and celebrity have taken the place 
of actual accomplishment, monarchs are basically privileged show dogs
whose pedigrees allow them to amass enormous fortunes, live in a rari-
fied world, and be regarded as newsworthy for no reason other than that
they’re royal. Seen in the unflattering light of her children, Elizabeth
shines like an old-fashioned beacon of virtue and traditional values. She
has never embarrassed her nation, and she is a hard and disciplined
worker, the most widely traveled head of state in the world. She cele-
brated her Golden Jubilee in 2002 and appears determined to remain on
the throne for quite some time — perhaps as long as Victoria.
And yet, overall, the popularity of the English monarchy is in sharp
decline. In large part, this is because the disliked and derided Windsor
children have tarnished the royal name. (Princess Diana was the only
recent royal to reach the hearts of the public.) But it also has to do with
a growing sense that the monarchy is simply irrelevant. The monarchy
provides an enormous boost to tourism and sells a lot of books and
newspapers, but in a world of democratic models and historical amne-
sia, how can an elitist monarchy achieve any meaningful relationship to
the public it is expected to serve?
It’s hard to imagine England without a king or a queen and the traditions
associated with royalty. And perhaps the monarchy is worth preserving
for that reason alone.
One of my favorite stories about Elizabeth II appeared in a book by Paul
Burrell (the queen’s butler), A Royal Duty. One night, the queen asked if
he would like to accompany her as she viewed the latest likeness of her-
self sent from Madame Tussaud’s for her approval. The queen and her
butler walked through the hallways and corridors of Buckingham Palace
until they came to an enormous, dark drawing room. When the lights
were switched on, they saw a lifelike effigy of the queen standing in the
center of the room. Elizabeth slowly circled her wax twin, carefully scru-
tinizing her image, then pronounced herself satisfied, turned off the
lights, and left her twin in the dark.

are reduced. The same holds true for other
major British holidays: New Year’s Day,
Good Friday, Easter Monday (the day after
Easter), May Day (first Mon in May),

days: mid-July to early September, three
weeks at Christmas and at Easter, a week
in mid-October, and a week in mid-February.

Legal Aid
In every case where legal aid is required
by a foreign national within Britain, the
British Tourist Authority advises visitors to
contact their embassy.
Liquor Laws
No one under 18 can be served alcohol
legally. Children under 16 aren’t allowed in
pubs, except in dining rooms, and then
only when accompanied by a parent or
guardian. Restaurants are allowed to 
serve liquor during the same hours as pubs
(see “Business Hours,” earlier in this
appendix, for these hours); however, only
people who have a meal on the premises
can be served a drink. In hotels, liquor may
be served between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. to
both guests and non-guests; after 11 p.m.,
only guests can get a drink.
Mail
A postcard or airmail letter to North
America, Australia, and New Zealand
costs 54p ($1.10) for 10 grams. You can
send mail within the United Kingdom first
or second class. See “Post Offices,” later
in this appendix.
Maps
You can get the best all-around street direc-
tory, London A–Z, at most newsstands and
bookstores. You can obtain a bus and Under-
ground map at any Underground station.
Newspapers and Magazines
The Times, Telegraph, Daily Mail, and
Evening Standard are all dailies carrying
the latest news. You can get copies of the
International Herald Tribune, published in
Paris, and an international edition of USA
Today daily. You can also buy copies of
Newsweek and Time at most newsstands.
Magazines such as City Limits, Time Out,
and Where contain useful information
about the latest happenings in London. 
You can pick up a copy of Gay Times, a

London For Dummies, 5th Edition 
340
high-quality, news-oriented magazine cov-
ering the gay and lesbian communities, at
most newsstands and news agents. See
“Where to Get More Information,” later in
this appendix, for more info.
Pharmacies
They’re called chemists in the United
Kingdom. The chain Boots (www.boots.
com) has outlets all over London. Bliss the
Chemist, 5 Marble Arch, W1 (% 020/7723-
6116; Tube: Marble Arch), is open daily 
9 a.m. to midnight. Zafash Pharmacy, 233–
235 Old Brompton Rd., SW5 (% 020/7373-
2798; Tube: Earl’s Court), is London’s only
24-hour pharmacy.
Police
In an emergency, dial % 999.
Post Offices
The Main Post Office, 24 William IV St.,
WC2 (% 020/7930-9580; Tube: Charing
Cross), is open Monday through Saturday
8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Other post offices and
sub-post offices (windows in the backs of
news agents) are open Monday through
Friday 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 
9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. For general post office
information, go to www.royalmail.com.
Look for red POST OFFICE signs outside.
Restrooms
The English often call toilets loos. Loos are
marked by PUBLIC TOILETS signs on streets,
in parks, and in a few Tube stations. You
can also find well-maintained lavatories
that anybody can use in all larger public
buildings, such as museums and art gal-
leries, large department stores, and rail
stations. You can usually use public lavato-
ries for free, but you may need a 20p coin
to get in or to use a proper washroom. In
some places (like Leicester Square), you
can find coin-operated “Super Loos” that
are sterilized after each use. If all else
fails, duck into the nearest pub.
Safety
Security in the London Underground was
dramatically increased following the 2005
terrorist attacks. In general, London is a
safe city. As in any large metropolis, use
common sense and normal caution when
you’re in a crowded public area or walking
alone at night. The area around Euston
Station has more purse snatchings than
anywhere else in London.
Smoking
As of July 2007, smoking was prohibited 
in all public areas throughout the United
Kingdom, including restaurants and pubs.
Nonsmoking rooms are available in more
and more hotels, and many B&Bs are now
entirely smoke-free.
Taxes
The 17.5 percent value-added tax (VAT) 
is added to all hotel and restaurant bills
and is included in the price of many items
that you purchase. You can get this tax
refunded if you shop at stores that partici-
pate in the Retail Export Scheme (signs are
posted in the windows of participating
stores). See Chapter 12 for more informa-
tion on receiving a VAT refund.
Taxis
You can hail a cab from the street; if the
FOR HIRE light is lit, the cab is available. You
can phone for a cab at % 020/7272-0272.
Telephone
The country code for the United Kingdom
is 44. London’s telephone area code is 020
within the United Kingdom or 20 outside
the United Kingdom. If you’re calling a

Appendix: Quick Concierge 341
London number from outside the city, use
020 followed by the eight-digit number. If
you’re calling within London, leave off the
020 and dial only the eight-digit number.
For directory assistance in London and the
rest of Britain, dial % 192.
To call England from the United States,
Canada, and Australia dial 011-44, then the
city code (20 for London), and the eight-
digit phone number. For calls from New
Zealand, dial 00-44, then the city code and
the eight-digit phone number.
If you’re dialing a London number within
London, drop the 020 city code.
You can find three types of public pay
phones: those that take only coins (increas-
ingly rare); those that accept only phone
cards; and those that take phone cards,
credit cards, and coins. You can get phone
cards in various values — from £3 ($6) up
to £20 ($40) — and you can reuse them
until you use up the total value of the card.
You can buy the cards from newsstands
and post offices. At coin-operated phones,
insert your coins before dialing. The mini-
mum charge is 40p (80¢). The credit card
pay phone operates on credit cards —
Access (MasterCard), American Express,
Diners Club, and Visa.
To make an international call from London,
dial the international access code (00), the
country code, the area code, and the local
number. Or call through one of the follow-
ing long-distance access codes: AT&T USA
Direct (% 0800/890-011), Canada Direct
(% 0800/890-016), Australia (% 0800/
890-061), or New Zealand (% 0800/
890-064). Common country codes are:
United States and Canada, 1; Australia, 61;
New Zealand, 64.
Time Zone
England follows Greenwich mean time
(five hours ahead of United States eastern
standard time). Most of the year, including
summer, Britain is five hours ahead of the
time observed on the East Coast of the
United States. Because the United States
and Britain observe daylight saving time at
slightly different times of year, for a brief
period (about a week) in autumn, London is
only four hours ahead of New York, and for
a brief period in spring, London is six hours
ahead of New York.
Tipping
In restaurants, service charges of 15 per-
cent to 20 percent are often added to the
bill. Sometimes, this tip is clearly marked;
other times, it isn’t. When in doubt, ask. 
If service isn’t included, adding 10 percent
to 15 percent to the bill is customary.
Sommeliers get about £1 ($2) per bottle of
wine served. Tipping in pubs isn’t done, but
in cocktail bars, the server usually gets
about £1 ($2) per round of drinks. Tipping
taxi drivers 10 percent to 15 percent of the
fare is standard. Barbers and hairdressers
expect 10 percent to 15 percent. Tour
guides expect £2 ($4), although this tip isn’t
mandatory. Theater ushers are not tipped.
Transit Info
For 24-hour information on London’s Under-
ground, buses, and ferries, call % 020/7222-
1234 or go online to www.tfl.gov.uk.
Water
London’s water is safe to drink. Tap water
is free in restaurants, so be sure to ask for
it if you don’t want to pay for bottled water.

you go, check the Visit London Web site at
