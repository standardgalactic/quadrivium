About the Author
Hagop Panosian Educated as an architect, Hagop understands the impact 
new technologies can have on an industry. He believes that the more 
advanced aspects of new technologies should be made accessible to  
non-tech professionals, especially given the changes technological 
advances are bringing to every aspect of life and the workplace.
To drive his vision, Hagop made a career shift from architecture to 
technology authorship and education. He currently advises app startups on 
topics such as pitching, fundraising and managing growth. He lives with his 
wife and two children in Yerevan, Armenia. Hagop can be contacted on his

Acknowledgments
This book is the product of effort on my part combined with inspiration and 
support from family and professional guidance and editing from the team at 
Apress.
I owe a debt of gratitude to my parents, who dedicated their lives to giving 
their kids a childhood that was better than theirs had been. They succeeded. 
In the mid-eighties, they invested in a computer for my brother and me  
when no one else where we lived thought it was important, which made  
self-driven, tech-savvy self-learners out of us. My brother contributed greatly 
to this book by making sure I didn’t get into financial hot water while I took 
the time to write it, and also served as the main reader persona. I wrote this 
book with him in mind as my audience.
This book is also a product of the love and patience of my wife and kids, 
who are the force that drives everything I do every moment of the day.  
It’s easy to believe in yourself when your family believes in you so much!
Finally, a big thank you to Aaron Black, Jessica Vakili, and everyone else at 
Apress who contributed to making a quality product out of my efforts. I’m 
inspired and humbled by their professionalism and look forward to working 
with them on new projects!

Introduction
Welcome to one of the most incredible technological innovations of the past 
decade.
The app industry was born on July 10, 2008, when Apple first “opened the 
doors” to its App Store to allow iPhone users to download apps onto their 
devices. According to rewrite (www.ca.com/us/rewrite.html), an online 
journal by CA Technologies and Wired magazine, within a space of just 
seven years, by 2015, the app economy
 grew into an industry worth an estimated $143 billion;
 created at least 627,000 jobs (just through the iOS  
App Store);
 created 54 percent job growth for iOS developers 
between 2012 and 2014;

Introduction
xxviii
 generated app downloads that are expected to grow to 
just under 300 billion by 2020; and
 generated annual app revenue that is expected to grow 
to $77 billion in 2017 and over $100 billion by 2020 
through the iOS App Store alone.
The app revolution has created whole new sectors of the U.S. and global 
economies, with new markets, marketing channels, and professions that did 
not even exist just a few years ago. It has opened up new ways for vendors 
to reach and interact with customers and empowered and entertained 
billions of smartphone users. Most important, it has created a way for 
resourceful and ingenious entrepreneurs and people-next-door to make 
millions with their creativity and inventiveness by giving them access to a 
huge market. Without a doubt, there have been very few times in history 
when access to markets and wealth has been as easy as it is today for 
anyone with a good idea and marketing smarts.
The immensely transformative power of the app industry in its infancy was 
the reason I became interested in apps several years ago, when a friend 
suggested I put aside what I was working on and shift to developing apps. 
As a self-learner, I spent many months trying to learn how the app business 
works and how apps are built, combining tidbits of actionable information 
wherever I could find them.
Eventually, it became obvious that what was available out there to help 
self-driven outsiders like me learn app development could be grouped into 
two broad categories: tech books by techies for techies, and the “make 
millions overnight with no money down, no coding, and no effort” books 
that sold a dream with little actionable information. At the same time, there 
were countless bits of expert advice, tips and tricks, best practices, and 
insights spread across countless books, e-books, blog entries, and articles 
written by authors whose expertise was evolving alongside the industry 
itself. Clearly, there was a need for a book that combined the fundamentals 
and best practices of app design, development, and distribution to produce 
a one-stop shop for both insiders and outsiders that was more than just an 
introduction to the business—a book that would contain everything about 
the app-publishing industry a newcomer would need to know. That was the 
inspiration behind this book.
Who This Book Is For
There are, of course, many excellent books on app development, app 
design, the app business, and everything in between, but there was one 
thing that struck me: they were unlikely to appeal to, or meet the needs 
of, a very specific and quite large group of people who are very much

interested in apps as an investment opportunity but (wrongly) believe it takes 
a great deal of tech savvy to succeed in the app business. They may also 
be frustrated by not having one place in which to find easily absorbable, 
straight-to-the-point, actionable information and guidance about how to 
navigate through the app jungle and be in a position to understand the 
market they will be competing in. They want to know how to make informed 
decisions about whether or not to invest in apps, how to pick the right 
type of app. They also want to know how to set a budget and create an 
investment plan, and how to measure the success of a project and get a 
return on their investment.
Eventually, the research for this book grew to represent value not just for 
investors pursuing returns, but for other groups of readers as well. While 
writing it, I’ve had a very specific list of potential readers in mind, as you 
will see later. Despite the differences between them, these reader personas 
share a common characteristic in that they have little interest in coding, 
either because they already are accomplished coders or because they plan 
to get others to code their apps. As a result, there is not a single line of code 
in this book. There are many great books on coding for apps already out 
there. This book is about everything else.
The reader categories that follow care most of all about understanding every 
aspect of the industry and knowing enough to make informed decisions 
instead of simply blindly trusting the experts. Some of them, like coders and 
digital marketers, care mostly about complementing what they already know 
and keeping up with the evolution of this amazing industry.
The Whiz Kid is a master of code. He knows everything about how to code 
iOS apps and has already coded a few basic games. He wants to be an 
app-distribution pro.
The Newbie knows next to nothing about the app business, except for the 
apps she uses, some of which she likes so much she’s curious about how 
they’re made. Plus, she’s thinking about getting into app design.

Introduction

The Investor is interested in apps as an investment opportunity and wants 
to know what returns he can expect from apps as compared to other 
investments. He also wants to decide whether to establish an app design 
company or work with one to create a portfolio of apps.
The Pro Coder is interested in improving his career prospects by going 
beyond the code to learn about app design and marketing, possibly as a 
prelude to becoming an independent app professional.
The Educator teaches students about the app industry from a design, 
coding, or marketing perspective and is looking for a book that contains 
both the basics and the latest in the industry.
The Researcher wants a book he can refer to for useful data and additional 
sources and information for his work, and as a way to keep up with the 
industry.
The Student is studying apps as part of a course on business, coding, 
or marketing and wants a book that succinctly explains the fundamental 
concepts and processes of each of these aspects of the business.
There is something for all of these groups in Learn iOS App Distribution, 
and despite their different viewpoints on the same subject, there is 
something common to all of them: the coding aspects matter less to them 
than everything else does. They either already know how to code or plan 
to outsource the coding part for their apps, or have other, great books on 
coding and don’t feel the need for another one.
As the author, I felt that what was needed was a book about the big picture 
that is thorough enough to allow readers to go beyond the basics and make 
informed decisions about navigating their way to success.
Assumptions
This book assumes the following:
1.	
You know next to nothing about the app business 
or industry (so, we’ll look at everything from the 
beginning).
2.	
You want straight-to-the-point knowledge that is 
condensed but easy on the brain and actionable.
3.	
You want to feel like an expert after you read this 
book, or at least earn respect from the experts when 
you talk to them.
These three elements have informed the content and tone of Learn iOS App 
Distribution.

Introduction

What Is App Distribution?
What is app distribution exactly, and how does it differ from app 
development or app publishing?
For the purposes of this book, app publishing is the complete process of 
creating apps and releasing them onto the market. App development is the 
process that combines ideation, design, and coding. App distribution, as 
Apple defines it, is a very specific phase in the app publishing process that 
combines testing, submission, and release.
This is how Apple defines app distribution on its own online App Distribution 
Guide (https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/
IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html):
Although iOS app distribution is the main focus of this book, we will be 
looking at the whole app publishing process in detail, including what 
happens after app release.
What This Book Is
This book combines information from three main sources: my own 
knowledge, Apple’s own guidelines, and best practices and content from 
respected developers and companies. Each of these sources contributes a 
very specific kind of knowledge that, when combined with the others, forms 
the best and most actionable information you can find anywhere.
I have put in this book everything that I wished was there for me to learn 
when I first started exploring the app business. I want this book to make 
you an expert literally overnight by giving you all the information you need to 
make informed decisions and make your mark in the app business.

Introduction

What This Book Is Not
This is not a coding book. Coding is beyond its scope, and it is not a 
coincidence that there is not a single line of code in this book. Learn iOS 
App Distribution is designed to meet a different need.
This book is also not a “fast track to riches” guide designed to foster false 
hopes as a selling point. As far as I am concerned there is no fast track to 
riches in this or any other business. Only determination and commitment 
can produce an opportunity for wealth.
This book is structured to introduce readers to the app industry, allow them 
to talk comfortably with the experts overnight, and choose which corner of 
the industry works best for them. Learn iOS App Distribution is intended for 
readers who have an interest in app development but have no interest in 
code-heavy books or books that wander beyond the basics.
What’s in This Book
Learn iOS App Distribution consists of 15 chapters that are sequenced 
logically, starting from an introduction to the app industry through the complete 
process of app distribution to app marketing and performance evaluation.
Each chapter is a complete introduction to the fundamental principles, 
activities, and processes of different aspects of the app development 
process. These chapters make sense when read in sequence, but the reader 
can also return to each of these chapters separately later on.
Chapter 1, “The Smartphone Landscape,” is an introduction to the devices 
that host the apps we use. We’ll look at how smartphones and iOS devices 
have evolved and how they are distributed worldwide. We’ll take a closer 
look at what types of iOS devices are available and how many people use 
them all over the world.
In Chapter 2, “The App Landscape,” we look at apps as entities: what they 
are, where they begin and end, and what the top apps in the app stores are.
Chapter 3, “The App Ecosystem,” looks at who does what in the app 
industry, dividing them into three fundamental groups: those who influence 
an app before release, those who influence it after release, and appreneurs 
(app entrepreneurs) who develop and publish apps as a business.
Chapter 4, “App Economics,” is about how apps make money, what the 
available and popular monetization models for apps are, and how return on 
investment is measured in the app world.
In Chapter 5, “Imagine Your App,” we’ll look at how app ideas are generated, 
what the most effective processes are, and where to find inspiration.

Introduction
xxxiii
In Chapter 6, “Design Your App,” we’ll look at how apps evolve from 
concept to design. We’ll also look at everything that affects the design of an 
app and at the basics of building a team to develop the concept.
Chapter 7, “Building Your App,” is about turning a concept and design into 
a prototype, from the software you will need to creating storyboards and 
wireframes to building a team. We’ll also look at how apps are assembled, 
their components, the platforms on which they are hosted, and everything 
that goes into a full-fledged app.
In Chapter 8, “Configuring Your App,” we’ll look at everything that needs to 
be done on Apple iTunes to configure an app for distribution.
In Chapter 9, “Testing Your App,” we’ll look at how iOS apps are tested on 
Testflight before they are submitted for approval.
Chapter 10, “Submitting Your App,” elaborates on the submission process 
and looks at all the reasons why an app might get rejected and how to avoid 
them.
In Chapter 11, “Distributing Your App,” we’ll see how app distribution is 
managed after an app is approved and released on the App Store.
Chapter 12, “Marketing Your App,” is all about how apps can be marketed, 
what channels are used to market apps, and the best practices that lead to 
successful marketing.
Chapter 13, “App Marketing Concepts,” looks at the latest concepts and 
techniques marketers are using to give their products and value propositions 
an edge and make their campaigns as efficient and effective as possible.
Chapter 14, “Prepare for Success,” will help you prepare for unexpected 
success in every fundamental way. The conclusion of the book looks at the 
biggest trends in the app world today and at the future of apps.
Appendix, “Online Resources,” is a collection of available resources to help 
you access more information and improve your skills.
How to Use This Book
As you will have noticed, the chapters of this book are written in a logical 
sequence that optimizes the learning process for the newcomer to the 
industry, but each chapter can also be read separately should the reader 
want to focus on one aspect.
I wrote this book from the perspective of what I wished someone would 
have written when I was trying to learn app publishing as a total newcomer.  
I hope you’ll enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

The Smartphone 
Landscape

CHAPTER 1: The Smartphone Landscape
2
To understand the evolution of the app industry, we need to first look at the 
evolution of the devices that host them: smartphones.
Smartphones, as well all know, are taking over the world, or have already 
done so. There are currently two billion smartphone users worldwide, each 
of whom has an average of 27 apps on their device and checks some of 
them between 35 and 75 times a day.
Apps are intricately tied to the capabilities and features of the devices that 
host them, and understanding the distribution of smartphones, tablets, and 
their platforms across the globe is crucial to knowing how to plan your app 
development project and your marketing campaign.
So, what insights can you extract from information about the global 
shipments and geographic distribution of smartphones? Shipment statistics 
will help you identify the markets on which you should focus—those 
countries that have the most smartphone users and widest smartphone use.
The languages spoken in these countries will help you decide how to 
localize your app. Should you release your app in English alone, or should 
you release a Chinese or Russian version as well?
In addition, the demographics of smartphone users in each country or 
market—age distribution, gender distribution, and profession, as well as 
information about their preferences and habits—will be very useful in helping 
you develop app ideas.
So, the starting point of your app development journey is the smartphone 
user. Let’s take a look at how smartphones have evolved over time and how 
their use is distributed worldwide.
From Phones to Smartphones
There was a time not too many years ago when a mobile phone was a big, 
cumbersome device that could do little more than allow you to make phone 
calls on the go. It was equipped with a huge battery that lasted no more 
than a couple of hours and needed to be charged for many hours. The first 
screens could only support two colors, and the only “apps” on the first 
“smartphones”—meaning phones that could do more than make phone 
calls—were a simple calendar, a calculator, and a few primitive games.
The “Brick” and Simon
The first mobile phone was the Motorola DynaTAC 8000X (such a 1980s 
name, right?). It was first released in 1983, weighed around 2.5 pounds, 
and sold for an incredible $3,995—plus monthly fees. It was affectionately 
known as “the brick.”

CHAPTER 1: The Smartphone Landscape
3
The very first “smartphone” was the IBM Simon, which turned 20 years old 
in 2014. It cost $899, and IBM sold around 50,000 units over six months. 
Besides making and receiving telephone calls, it could send and receive 
faxes and emails.
Competition
In the early years of the mobile phone, manufacturers were highly secretive 
about the inner workings of their devices, and all software development for 
them was done in-house as a very closely guarded trade secret. It was only 
in 2007 that Apple made the software for its devices open to all developers 
everywhere, setting off a boom in development. Today, open-sourcing 
is a very common strategy for improving software quality and creating a 
community around a product.
The Smartphone Market Today
In just a decade, the number of smartphones in use worldwide has grown to 
more than two billion devices. Many of these devices are built by pioneers 
like Apple, but a growing number are being built by companies that did not 
exist even a couple of years ago (Figure 1-1). Apple’s operating system, 
iOS, runs only on Apple’s devices, like the iPhone and iPad, but Google’s 
operating system, Android, can run on any device designed to host it. As 
a result, there is a multitude of smartphone models that are designed for 
Android being built by more than one company, which has allowed Google 
to raise its share of the smartphone market to more than 80 percent today.

Today, Android runs on the vast majority of smartphones in the market, 
including Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi, and other brands. According to 
Gartner, Android had an 86.2 percent market share of the total number  
of phones sold in Q2 of 2016, with some 296.913 million phones, 
followed by iOS with a 12.9 percent market share and 44.395 million 
phones, Windows with 0.6 percent market share and 1.97 million phones, 
Blackberry with 0.1 percent market share and 400,400 phones, and other 
manufacturers with 0.2 percent market share and 680,600 phones.
Several Chinese smartphone manufacturers, like Huawei and Xiaomi, have 
emerged over the past several years to meet the fast-growing Chinese 
consumer demand for smartphones, while Apple devices remain popular 
in North America. According to expandedramblings.com, in 2016 the iPhone 
had a 41.9 percent share of the U.S. and Canada smartphone market but 
only an 8.2 percent share of the Chinese market.
Again according to Gartner, in Q2 of 2016 Samsung sold around  
76.75 million phones for a 22.3 percent market share, followed by Apple  
with around 44.39 million for a 12.9 percent market share, Huawei with 
30.67 million for a 8.9 percent market share, Oppo with around 18.49 million 
for a 5.4 percent market share, and Xiaomi with 15.53 million for a  
4.5 percent market share. Other manufacturers sold a total of 158.53 million 
phones in Q2 of 2016 for a 46 percent market share.
Samsung is the world’s top-selling smartphone maker with a 22.8 percent 
market share in Q2 2016 and 7.7 percent year-over-year (YoY) growth, 
driven mainly by the success of the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge 
smartphones. In Q2 2016, Apple registered a 15 percent YoY decline from 
Q2 2015, selling 40.4 million units. Apple’s best-selling device worldwide is 
the iPhone 6s.

CHAPTER 1: The Smartphone Landscape

Smartphone Use Worldwide
China, India, and the United States are the three biggest consumers of 
smartphones and the only three that currently have more than 100 million 
smartphone users each. China is emerging as the big behemoth among the 
three, and not just in terms of numbers of smartphones in use. In late 2016, 
China overtook the United States in terms of iOS App Store revenue.
Figure 1-2, based on data from Gartner and eMarketer dated December 
2014, shows the three countries and their projected numbers of smartphone 
users for 2015 and 2016.

Using the same data from Gartner and eMarketer, Figure 1-3 lists the world's 
top 25 countries ranked by the projected number of smartphone users in

Smartphone User Growth
Smartphone markets can also be ranked according to fastest user growth. 
Using Gartner’s data from December 2014, Figure 1-4 ranks the world’s top

Top Markets
Looking at the country rankings in terms of both size and growth rate, you 
can identify the countries with the biggest potential for your app projects. 
India, for example, was third in terms of size but first in terms of user growth. 
Indonesia is clearly a top market, ranking sixth in terms of size but tying with 
first-place India in terms of growth rate. So is Brazil, which ranks seventh in 
terms of size and third in terms of growth.
What about China? Although China ranked only twenty-fifth in terms of 
smartphone user growth in 2015, with 10.5 percent, this still represents a 
very large number of users given China’s population size and initial number 
of smartphone users.
Smartphone Penetration
The percentage of a country’s population that owns a smartphone is another 
measure of the market’s potential in that country. The higher the smartphone 
saturation, the lower the available room for user growth.
Figure 1-5 ranks the world’s top countries in terms of smartphone penetration 
using data sourced from market intelligence providers SMSGlobal  
(https://www.smsglobal.com/), DIGIECO (www.digieco.co.kr/), comscore

Apple Devices: The iPhone
Apple changed the world on June 29, 2007, when it introduced us all to the 
iPhone, setting off the smartphone revolution that has put these devices 
into the hands of more than two billion people so far. Apple has sold over 
a billion smartphones to date and has over 100 million people using its 
devices in the United States alone.
The iPhone has evolved significantly since its release in 2007. Figure 1-6 
compares the specifications of the very first iPhone model to those of the 
iPhone 7 Plus, released in 2016.
Apple had a lead over other smartphone makers in the first couple of years 
following the release of the first iPhone, but its market share has shrunk 
as Chinese smartphone manufacturers like Huawei and Xiaomi, which use 
Google’s Android operating system, have emerged to grab a big share of the 
Chinese market and its insatiable demand for new tech. In Q2 2016, Apple 
had a 12.9 percent market share of smartphone sales worldwide compared 
to Android’s 86.2 percent (source: www.gartner.com/).
Apple’s smartphone operating system, iOS, has evolved alongside its 
devices. Figure 1-7 shows the compatibility of each iPhone release  
with different iOS versions.

Apple Devices: The iPad
Apple first released the iPad in January 2010, and by January 2015 it had 
sold more than 250 million of these devices. Some 300,000 were sold on 
the first day, and over one million were sold by May 2010. The iPad Mini 
was first released in 2012, the iPad Air in 2013, and the iPad Pro in 2015. 
Figure 1-8 shows the specifications of the various models.

The Apple Tribe
Apple, as a software and hardware manufacturer, was the first to build 
devices, create software and operating systems that run on those devices, 
and also operate the marketplace through which the apps created for those 
devices are sold.
Apple also imposes strict standards and quality controls on the design, 
aesthetics, and functionality of iOS apps. All this allows the company to 
offer its customers a user experience that’s consistent with the company’s 
intended image.
Apple customers were known for their brand loyalty long before the advent 
of the iPhone and iPad, and the company has extended this relationship 
of trust to its smartphone and tablet customers as well (Figure 1-9). This is 
reflected in the willingness of iPhone and iPad users to spend money on 
apps and games through their devices. Despite Apple’s overall smartphone 
market share of around 20 to 25 percent, its customers still outspend the 
users of smartphones running other operating systems.

Summary
Knowing how the smartphone market is evolving over time is the foundation 
of a good app development and marketing strategy. Reliable and up-to-date 
information about smartphone use, growth, and market penetration will tell 
you which countries are the best bets, which languages should be on your 
localization list, and where your app is most likely to reach sustainability 
quickest. Later on in this book, you will combine this information with data 
about app usage, user behavior, and spending habits to determine how to 
design a competitive product for your target audience.

Chapter 2
The App Landscape
Software programs are also known as applications, or apps. Those that are 
run on desktop computers are known as desktop apps, while those that are 
run on mobile devices are referred to as mobile apps.
A mobile app is just a program, but one that was specifically designed to 
run on your smartphone. Apps have transformed the way we interact with 
software and how we use it to do the things we want to do. Supported by 
the smartphones that host them, apps have created incredible possibilities 

CHAPTER 2: The App Landscape

for communication. They have also made the creation of software for profit 
accessible to many people who were once far removed from programming 
and software development.
The Evolution of Apps
Apps have evolved alongside the devices that host them: the smartphone 
and the tablet. The first apps were primitive versions of what is built into 
new smartphones today: a calendar, contacts list, and a few basic games. 
Because the fundamental innovation of the first mobile phones was mobility 
itself, and since the technology was still in its infancy, all the software was 
built in. The concept of browsing the Internet, not to mention the idea of 
downloading apps, was still far away because the bandwidths that we are 
used to today were simply not there.
At a technology conference in Aspen in June 1983, Steve Jobs predicted 
that in the future software would be able to be bought over phone lines from 
a distribution center. As mobile phones became more and more ubiquitous 
in the 1990s, demand grew sharply for more and more features, and the 
mobile phone evolved into today’s smartphone.
Laying the Foundation
Phones have evolved to meet demand for various features and capabilities, 
while phone manufacturers have retained only a limited number of built-in 
apps and allowed third-party developers to build the apps that users crave. 
This required that they grant developers access to the inner workings of the 
smartphones. In June 2007, Apple released the first iPhone, selling 270,000 
units in 30 hours, and allowed developers to build Web 2.0 apps that were 
based on Apple’s standards and could use its services.
The idea of open access is the foundation of today’s app stores and app 
industry. When Apple first opened the App Store for the iPhone in July 
2008, there were just 500 apps available for download. Ten million were 
downloaded in the first week. Just 60 days later, in September, there were 
more than 3,000 apps, and they had been downloaded more than 100 
million times. Now, there are between 1.8 million and 2 million apps on the 
Apple and Google app stores available for the over two billion smartphones 
worldwide. Some 25 billion iOS apps and 50 billion Android apps were 
downloaded onto smartphones in 2015.
The first apps on the Apple and Google app stores were simply extensions 
of the mobile phone features that had come before them. Matthew 
Panzarino, co-editor of TechCrunch (https://techcrunch.com/) calls the first 
phase of smartphone apps the “information appliance” phase—apps that 

CHAPTER 2: The App Landscape
17
turned the phone into a device performing a single function, like a calculator 
or calendar. The next phase, according to Panzarino, was the “home screen” 
era, when every app fought to become the user’s main app for everything.
The Boundaries of an App
An app is more than just the bit of software that is sitting in your 
smartphone’s memory. Depending on what type of app it is and what 
features it has, it can communicate with a backend server over the Internet, 
talk to all the other instances of the same app on other smartphones, and 
benefit from an endless array of services related to its purpose. Generally, 
a fully developed app would have the following components:
 Icon – This is the “button” that you press to run the app 
on your smartphone.
 Splash Screen – This is the non-interactive screen that 
tells you the app is loading. It’s usually just an image 
and a message telling you to wait.
 Key Features – Besides performing its main function, 
be it entertainment or utility or something else, a fully 
developed app will have features related to security, 
offline functionality, user support, update capability, 
ways to contact the app publisher to offer feedback 
or submit inquiries, personalization, device-responsive 
design, internal search, and integration with social 
media for sharing purposes.
 Analytics – Analytics are snippets of code that are 
inserted into an app to monitor, analyze, and predict 
user behavior inside an app.
 Backend – A mobile backend is software hosted on 
a server that the publisher of an app uses to keep in 
touch with all of its users, store relevant information, 
update the app’s content, and supplement the app in 
different ways. The backend for an app can be hosted 
on a custom-made server; cloud servers like Amazon 
AWS, Google App Engine, or Windows Azure; or MBaaS 
(Mobile Backend as a Service) startups like Stackmob, 
Kinvey, Appcelerator, and Parse.

Apple’s App Store
Apple opened the App Store on July 10, 2008, and hit the one billion 
download mark on April 23, 2009, hitting 1.4 billion in June of the same year. 
By November, there were 100,000 apps available on the App Store, and 
Apple hit the three billion download mark in December. In April 2010, there 
were 225,000 apps, and by June, those apps had been downloaded a total 
of five billion times. By November 2010, there were 300,000 apps.
In May of 2011, the number of apps on the App Store hit the half-million 
mark. As of May 2017, there were around 2.2 million apps available for 
download, which had been downloaded a total of 180 billion times  
by June 2017.
According to research by Appboy (https://www.appboy.com/) published in 
April 2016 (https://www.appboy.com/blog/mobile-customer-99-stats/), 
more than 50 percent of smartphone owners today have between 40 and 
70 apps installed on their device, while 80 percent engage with their apps at 
least 15 times a day. Just 8 percent use more than ten apps per day, while 
63 percent use between four and ten.
App Types and Categories
Every app falls into a certain category that describes its main function. Each 
app-publishing platform, like the Apple App Store or Google Play, has its 
own list of app categories that publishers use to classify their app to make it 
easy to find.
As of October 2016, the list of app categories on the Apple App Store was as 
follows: Books, Business, Catalogs, Education, Entertainment, Finance, Food 
& Drink, Games, Health & Fitness, Lifestyle, Kids, Magazines & Newspapers, 
Medical, Music, Navigation, News, Photo & Video, Productivity, Reference, 
Shopping, Social Networking, Sports, Travel, and Utilities.
Each category has its own subcategories. The Games category, for 
example, has the following subcategories: Action, Adventure, Arcade, 
Board, Family, Music, Puzzle, Racing, Role Playing, Simulation, Shopping, 
Sports, and Strategy.
For purposes of comparison, as of October 2016, Google Play has the 
following categories of apps: Android Wear, Art & Design, Auto & Vehicles, 
Beauty, Books & Reference, Business, Comics, Communication, Dating, 
Education, Entertainment, Events, Finance, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, 
House & Home, Libraries & Demo, Lifestyle, Maps & Navigation, Medical, 
Music & Audio, News & Magazines, Parenting, Personalization, Photography, 
Productivity, Shopping, Social, Sports, Tools, Travel & Local, Video Players & 
Editors, and Weather.

The Most Popular App Categories
Some apps and app categories are more popular than others in terms of 
available apps and user engagement. According to statista.com, as of July 
2017 the most popular Apple App Store categories by share of available 
apps were Games (25.08 percent), Business (9.83 percent), Education (8.47 
percent), Lifestyle (8.33 percent), Lifestyle (8.33 percent), Entertainment (6.1

(1.86 percent), and Shopping (1.29 percent).
Top Apps
According to digital marketing company Smart Insights (http://www.
smartinsights.com/), as of 2013, adults in the United States have spent 
more time per day on mobile devices than on their desktop or laptop 
computers, and, in 2015, the average adult spent 2.8 hours (51 percent of 
the total time spent) on mobile per day. What kinds of apps did they spend 
their time on?
According to media analytics company comScore (https://www.comscore.
com/), the app category users spent the most time on in 2015 was Social 
Networking (29 percent), followed by Radio (15 percent), Games  
(11 percent), Multimedia (6 percent), and Messaging (6 percent).
Apple App Store Top Apps
This is reflected in the Top App rankings on the Apple and Google app

CHAPTER 2: The App Landscape
21
Developer Payouts
Developers of all types of apps have made a great deal of money through 
the Apple App Store. According to statista.com, by January 2014, Apple 
had paid developers a total of $15 billion. By January 2015, the number 
was $25 billion, while as of June 2016 the App Store had paid mobile app 
developers a cumulative total of $50 billion.
Top App Developers and Revenue
As of February 2016, there are around 400,000 developers registered on the 
Apple App Store, releasing around 1,000 apps a day. The best-performing 
companies are normally the game developers, with several registering sales 
of $1 billion or more.
According to Pocketgamer (www.pocketgamer.biz), the following companies 
made at least $1 billion in sales in 2015: Blizzard (U.S., $4.7 billion), NetEase 
(China, $3.5 billion), Tencent (China, $3 billion), Supercell (Finland, $2.3 billion), 
Mixi (Japan, $2 billion), King (U.K., $2 billion), Ubisoft (France, $1.5 billion), 
GungHo (Japan, $1.3 billion), Dena (Japan, $1.2 billion), and Machine Zone 
(U.S., $1 billion estimated).
The following companies made between $100 million and $1 billion in sales 
in 2015: CyberAgent (Japan), Netmarble (South Korea), Zynga (U.S.),  
GREE (Japan), Colopi (Japan), EA Mobile (U.S.), Elex Technology (China), 
Nexon (Japan), Square Enix (Japan), Kabam (U.S.), Com2uS (South Korea), 
Jam City (U.S.), Wargaming (Belarus), Gameloft (France), Disney Mobile (U.S.), 
Sega Networks (Japan), Glu Mobile (U.S.), IGG (Singapore), Scopely (U.S.), 
Rovio (Finland), Pocket Games (U.S.), Miniclip (U.K.), Gamevil (South Korea), 
and Etermax (Argentina).
The following companies made between $1 million and $100 million in sales in 
2015: ZeptoLab (Russia), Seriously (Finland), TinyCo (U.S.), Wooga (Germany), 
Kiloo (Denmark), Space Ape Games (U.K.), IUGO Mobile (Canada), Bethesda 
Studios (U.S.), Hister Whale (Australia), Next (Finland), KetchApp (France), 
Super Evil (U.S.), Gram Games (Turkey), Everywear Games (Finland), and 
Mediocre (Sweden).
Apps have made a lot of developers and companies a great deal of money, 
but the latest trends suggest the early “Gold Rush” days of the app industry 
are nearing an end, and the “middle class” of app development is slowly 
giving way to a bipolar system consisting of a small number of companies 
raking in the profits and a large number of small developers scoring modest 
earnings, with a wide gap in the middle.

CHAPTER 2: The App Landscape
22
The big companies invest a great deal of money in developing top-notch 
games and apps. They use big marketing budgets and user-engagement 
skills and experience to get the users and keep them, making it impossible 
for smaller companies to find a gap they can exploit to thrive in. With user 
acquisition costs at around $3.50 per user and growing, developers need 
big budgets just to get the users they need to survive, and this makes for a 
strong barrier to entry.
This is not to say that there no room for newcomers. It just means that 
newcomers need to be well prepared before entering the business, with 
good, well-developed ideas, strong planning and budgeting, and a good 
understanding of what works and how to go about it.
Summary
Monitoring the popularity and financial performance of app categories and 
top apps will help you glean crucial insights during the design phase of your 
app, when your focus will be on positioning your product against competing 
apps in its category and creating a unique value proposition to differentiate 
that product from the rest. It can also help you identify niches where a 
product with a specific set of features can do well so you can design a 
product around those features.
Monitoring the app stores is something you will be doing constantly as 
an app developer, so finding multiple sources of accurate, up-to-date 
information you can rely on and use should be a top priority.
Next, we’ll be looking at the app industry’s ecosystem—who does what and 
who works with whom to produce the apps and games you love.

Chapter 3
The App Ecosystem
What happens in the space between the birth of an app as an idea and 
its evolution into an appealing, fully functional product ready for you to 
download from the app stores? And who influences that app as it evolves 
from a concept into a product?

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
24
There are several stages an app goes through as it evolves into a finished 
product. Each stage defines the app’s function, look, and feel in more and 
more detail, after which the first prototype is created and thoroughly tested 
before producing the final version for release.
As you become increasingly familiar with the app industry, you will notice 
that there are literally thousands of companies out there—many of which 
began as startups like yours—that supply services, resources, or products 
related to app publishing rather than publishing apps themselves, or that 
regulate the app publishing process or the industry or market in some way. 
More and more companies are founded every day, each targeting a specific 
part of the industry or a specific aspect of the app publishing process. You 
and the apps you publish will either benefit from their products and services 
or have to conform to the rules and regulations they set. They are the 
intermediaries between your startup’s founding team and your app users.
Device Manufacturers
Device manufacturers are the companies that build the hardware—the 
smartphones, tablets, iPods, and other devices and accessories that 
host your apps and enhance their capabilities. This group also includes 
companies that build other devices and accessories, such as 3D cameras, 
2D and 3D printers, and credit card readers that attach to your device and 
are managed by apps.
As we saw in the previous chapter, the main device manufacturers related 
to the app industry are Samsung and Apple, followed by Huawei, Xiaomi, 
Lenovo, and newcomers like Oppo. According to statista.com, Samsung 
had the highest smartphone market share in Q2 of 2016 with 22.4 percent, 
followed by Apple with 11.8 percent, Huawei with 9.4 percent, Oppo with 
6.6 percent, and Vivo with 4.5 percent, while other manufacturers together 
had a 45.1 percent market share. Other companies that manufacture 
smartphones or have done so in the past include LG, RIM, Blackberry, HTC, 
Nokia, Motorola, ZTE, Sony, and Microsoft.
Any app that you design will have to take into account the specifications, 
features, and components of these devices, like the screen resolution, pixel 
density, available cameras (one or two) and their resolution and capabilities, 
GPS, accelerometer, processor speed, storage capabilities, and so on.
Many apps are built around using data from one specific component of 
these devices, like apps or games that use accelerometer data to function, 
location-based apps that use GPS data, or filter apps that use pictures 
taken with the camera. Your app will also use these components to gather 
information about your users, like using GPS data to segment your users by 
location.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
25
Operating System Developers
Operating system developers like Apple and Google build the operating 
systems that help you manage your devices and run apps on them. In 
the case of Apple, the manufacturer of the devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod) 
and the developer of the operating system that runs on them (iOS) are the 
same company. Android, on the other hand, is an operating system built 
by Google that runs on a very long list of devices sold by a very long list 
of manufacturers that includes Google with its Nexus smartphone series 
as well as the vast majority of other manufacturers, especially Samsung, 
Huawei, and Xiaomi.
Operating system builders also set strict guidelines for the design of apps 
and their user interfaces. Apple and Google have strict design guidelines 
for apps’ design and functionality and publish these guidelines on their 
websites for developers to follow.
App Distribution Platforms
As a rule, app distribution platforms are native to the mobile operating 
systems, as dictated by the integration of technologies. The biggest as of 
May 2017 are Google Play, with 2.8 million apps and Apple’s App Store, 
with 2 million apps. Besides these two most popular platforms, there is the 
Windows Store with 669,000 apps, the Amazon Appstore with 600,000 apps, 
and Blackberry World with 234,000 apps. Just in 2017, apps have been 
downloaded over 180 billion times through these app stores.
App Marketing and Analytics Platforms
App marketing platforms are digital marketing facilitators that will support 
your marketing campaigns in several ways, as follows:
 They will provide market research and data to support 
decision-making.
 They will organize and standardize your marketing 
materials.
 They will help you test your designs and prototypes.
 They will automate your marketing campaigns and help 
you improve their effectiveness.
 They will supply feedback and analytics data about user 
response.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
26
You can find a long list of app marketing platforms in the “Resources” 
section at the end of this book.
Regulators
Regulators set the laws that govern the manufacture, sale, and use of 
apps and the devices than run them. Regulators deal with issues like 
device safety and usability, data security, user privacy, standardization, 
fair competition, prevention of fraud and abuse, licensing for app stores, 
combating malicious software, enforcing real-name registration, and 
disclosing to users any in-app payments and information gathering, 
especially unauthorized charges made by children. They also resolve legal 
disputes resulting from the use of apps in a specific context, such as the 
conflict between the taxi service app Uber and local taxi drivers in countries 
where it is used.
Sometimes the design of an app is not affected by the regulation of its own 
industry, but by that of the industry for which it is intended. For example, 
apps for the medical industry have to adhere to strict regulations, mainly 
regarding the security of patient information gathered through apps and 
stored in records, the reliability of medical information disseminated through 
apps, and data-breach notifications.
Financiers
Financiers invest in promising apps at different phases of the lifecycles of 
app-based tech startups. An app startup’s first sources of financing are 
likely to be personal savings, family, and friends. To grow beyond the first 
stage, they normally search for other sources of cash, either through loans 
or equity or from mentors, startup incubators, angel investors, venture 
capitalists, and banks, starting with what is known as seed capital. Another 
way an app startup can raise funds is crowdfunding through platforms like 
Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
Developers
Developers, as individuals or companies, are the people who will take an 
app concept and turn it into a working app. Developers can be part of your 
own startup, working full-time or part-time, or can be hired or outsourced 
based on your project needs and budget. They include coders, user 
interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designers, game designers, and web 
designers.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
27
Developers will start with a concept and develop a project plan based on 
your specifications and intentions, the operating system, platform, and 
market for which you want to build the app, and your budget. Developers 
design the user experience and the user interface for a multitude of devices, 
screens, and user groups, optimizing the app’s technical, experiential, and 
commercial performance. They will also test the app extensively before 
publishing it on the app stores. There are currently more than 13 million 
registered Apple developers worldwide.
Asset Producers
Assets are digital products that are used extensively in app design and 
promotion, such as images, sounds, game characters, or even bits of code 
that can be inserted into apps and games. Asset producers design and sell 
or share products like the following:
 Images – device and screen mockups for app 
promotion, backgrounds for games, standard screen 
layout types (like login screens, registration screens)
 Wireframes – pre-designed skeletal illustrations of 
various screens (or pages) common to apps
 Templates – user interface (UI) and graphical user 
interface (GUI, pronounced gooey) kits and templates 
that speed up the developer’s design, iteration, and 
wireframing work
 Game assets - levels, characters, and objects such as 
weapons
 Code – pre-written bits of code that perform specific 
functions and save programmers time
Marketing and Advertising Companies
Marketers will help you maximize the exposure of your app and its chances 
of success through a variety of channels. Services range from simple e-mail 
marketing services to automate and manage communication with large 
numbers of subscribers, to full-range marketing planning and execution by 
professional app marketing agencies.
If you want to work with a professional marketing and advertising agency, 
it’s wise to do so while your app is still in the development stage, or perhaps 
even before then. In the early stages of your app’s lifecycle, before your app 
reaches the market, app marketing agencies will, among other things, do the 

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
28
following for you: analyze your competitive landscape, create a unique value 
proposition, identify markets and segments suitable for your app, make 
user response and revenue forecasts, test your app before release, launch 
early marketing campaigns to create interest around your app, design and 
produce optimized promotion materials, like app descriptions, screenshots, 
and videos for the app stores, and manage the app submission and 
approval process for you. Marketing agencies will also develop a focused 
post-release marketing and promotion plan and implement and manage it 
on your behalf.
Educators
These days, technology enables easy and affordable access to vast learning 
resources about every aspect of app development, from blogs, websites, 
articles, and forums to YouTube videos, where the curious can get all the 
help they need.
If you are committed to learning app development, there are online 
courses available on websites like Udemy, Udacity, Lynda, Coursera, Team 
Treehouse, Code.org, Code Academy, iTunes U, Khan Academy, Pluralsight, 
Skillcrush, Tuts Plus, Skillshare, and Sitepoint. There are also MOOCs 
(Massive Online Open Courses) offered by respected universities, like 
Harvard, MIT, Yale, Berkeley, Carnegie Mellon, the University of Texas, and 
other institutions.
Online tutors can teach you programming skills and can also advise you 
on any app development issues you may be facing. Search for mentors on 
CodeTutor, Chegg, Presto Experts, Tutor Universe, Wyzant, Tutors Live, 
eTutoring, and other sites. Tutoring companies also organize workshops 
on both broad and narrow themes related to app development. In these 
workshops, learning is done in groups. They can usually be found with 
a simple search. The most popular subjects are programming and app 
marketing.
If you are a passionate and motivated self-learner, there are books available 
in print or online on almost any subject related to app development. All 
the major technology book publishers, like Apress, McGraw Hill, New 
Riders, Wrox, and Wiley have hundreds of books on all aspects of app 
development, from programming to UI/UX design to marketing.
Online Job Marketplaces
One important aspect of the app publishing process you will need to 
manage is deciding which tasks to handle in-house and which to outsource 
or hire out as a service.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
29
As an app publisher, you may decide to outsource part of the app development 
process, fundamentally to save money, and to avoid having to hire in-house for 
any reason, such as space restrictions or the small size of a project.
As the “gig economy” grows, hiring online has become very popular, 
especially for technology-related work. You will need to hire primarily for two 
types of work: design and programming. Designers will present you with app 
branding ideas and UI/UX designs, while programmers will code your apps.
The most popular online job marketplaces are Upwork.com, Freelancer.com,  
Guru.com, Elance.com, Toptal.com, 99designs.com, Fiverr.com, 
MatchList.com, Gun.io, Crew.co, LocalSolo.com, Onsite.io, Folyo.me, 
Crowdsite.com, GetaCoder, and PeoplePerHour.com.
This brings us to the most important player in the app publishing industry—
the appreneur (app entrepreneur). That’s you!
Appreneurs
If you are getting into the app industry with the intention of publishing 
one or more apps and building a business around them, you are an app 
entrepreneur, or appreneur. As we will see later, with few exceptions, going 
through the whole process of conceiving, designing, coding, and publishing 
an app on your own is not a smart way to go about app publishing for 
several reasons, the most important of which is that this strategy fails to 
maximize the app’s potential for success.
You are unlikely to have honed all the skills that are needed to steer your 
app to success, not to mention the time constraints and the amount of work 
involved, so you are much better off creating a team that combines all the 
needed skills and distributes the tasks efficiently.
Why is building a team wiser than working on your own? The following 
sections identify the reasons.
Combination of Skills
As smart as you may be, you are unlikely to have mastered all the skills that 
are needed to make your app a success. Publishing an app requires the 
following skills: visual design, UI/UX design, coding, project management, 
accounting, financial management, business law and intellectual 
property protection, time management, marketing, customer relationship 
management (CRM), and so on. The members of a well-built team will 
bring together all the key skills that are needed for an app project and 
complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
30
Time Management
Simply put, there are just not enough hours in a day for you to do everything 
on your own for a serious app project unless you’re planning to take years to 
bring it to market, by which time the competition will probably have already 
saturated the market. Doing everything on your own will also force you to 
micromanage and possibly lose sight of the broader vision for your project.
Feedback
When you’re working on your own, you are missing out on the opportunity 
for constant feedback from your teammates, which is so important to the 
efficiency and success of a project. It’s not that you can’t do it on your 
own—many do—but with a team, your potential and capability are so much 
greater.
Contacts
Besides their own personal contribution to a project, each member of a 
team will bring their own circle of friends, colleagues, and other contacts to 
a project, multiplying the project’s visibility and likelihood of strong mentor 
support, especially at the beginning.
Credibility
Investors will rarely take a single-person team seriously. “I can do it all on 
my own; I don’t need anyone else” is a sure way to kill your credibility and 
drive away investors. It suggests that 1) you don’t understand the work 
involved and the separate tasks relevant to app publishing well enough; 2) 
you may be paranoid and may be obsessed or emotionally attached to your 
project, and thus do not want to share your idea with anyone else; and 3) 
you may be greedy and do not like the idea of surrendering equity to finance 
your project. All of these impressions about you send very bad signals 
that undermine your credibility as a founder and paint a picture of you as 
someone who is not mature enough to treat the project as a future business. 
Any serious app project will be built around a team, and a well-built team 
that combines the right skills, the right people, and the right networking 
potential becomes much more than the sum of its parts.
Let’s take a look at the different members of a founding team.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
31
The Founding Team
The founding team consists of three subgroups: the founder, the co-founder 
or co-founders, and the mentor or mentors (Figure 3-1). Each plays an 
important role in the launch and evolution of a company.
Figure 3-1.  The founding team

Every project or business begins with the founder. Besides being “the 
one with the original concept” and the carrier of the vision, the founder is 
the driving force who keeps the project on track and moving in the right 
direction, especially if he or she is also acting as the CEO.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
32
The Co-founder(s)
Co-founders contribute their skills, experience, and social networks to a 
startup and help send a positive signal to investors about how the founders 
are approaching their project.
Building the team begins with the founder. As a smart founder, you will first 
make a realistic and accurate assessment of what you can accomplish and 
the skills you have, identify the key skills that are lacking, and complement 
those skills by bringing in reliable and committed co-founders who understand 
and share your vision. People who would be indispensable for an app startup 
from the beginning are the best candidates for the founding team.
When building the founding team, however, you as a founder also need to 
make sure the founding team does not become too large, as having too 
many members would dilute ownership over the project or startup and 
raise the likelihood of conflict. The members of the founding team need to 
share your vision, and the likelihood of this shrinks as the size of the team 
grows. A small founding team that combines vision with management skills, 
financial skills, and technical skills will send the right signal to investors and 
raise your chances of success as you grow.
The Mentor(s)
Mentors are highly valuable contributors to an app project or startup. They 
may or may not be part of the original founding team, but the right mentors 
will contribute their experience, knowledge, and social networks, raising 
the credibility and visibility of your startup. They will offer guidance when 
the managing team sails into uncharted waters, and if you are new to app 
publishing, you will be doing that a lot.
Users
By far the largest group that keeps the app industry evolving is the users. 
There are more than two billion of them across the globe, armed with 
smartphones they check around 15 times a day on average. They will 
download your app, engage with it, review it, share their experience with it, 
and hopefully spend money on it.
Your relationship with your users is vital to the success of your app. 
Understanding who your users are, what they want, what they like, and what 
they expect from your app is the key to creating a successful app that is a 
perfect product-market fit and leads to money in the bank for you.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
33
The most important thing to know about your users is that they are all 
different from each other. Ignore this fact at your peril. As you will see, users 
can be divided into different groups based on the characteristics they share, 
but each expects you to treat them as an individual, and each responds 
much more positively to anything that is marketed to them personally than to 
anything that is marketed generically. You will be automating your marketing 
efforts as you scale, but the closer you can get to what makes your users 
different from one another, the better you will understand what inspires 
them and makes them want to buy and, as a result, the more effective your 
marketing efforts will be.
So, how will you be interacting with your users through your app and your 
marketing campaigns? Your relationship with users has three aspects: 
gathering information, segmenting users, and relating/responding. Let’s 
review them now.
Gather Information
Analytics software used in your app will gather all the information about 
your users they are willing to share. Analytics will gather three categories of 
information: user attributes, user preferences, and user behavior.
User attributes are what describes your user: location (city and country, and 
GPS data for location-based apps), age, gender, birth date, native language, 
number and types of devices used, and their operating systems.
User preferences are what the user likes and how they want you to relate 
to them. Depending on the type of app, analytics will tell you what social 
media they use, what their favorite types of content are, where they like to 
hang out, what they like to eat, how often they travel, and where they like to 
go on vacation. Your users will also tell you how they want you to relate to 
them—whether they like to be contacted through push notifications, their 
subscription to in-app services and content, the device settings they have 
enabled, and their social media connection status.
User behavior monitoring tells you what your users are doing and gathers 
statistics about their behavior to create a profile you can use to develop the 
next version of the app, as well as for marketing purposes to target them 
with the right offer.
User behavior information includes frequency and interval of app usage, 
duration of app visits, depth of app engagement, and financial information, 
such as average and total values of in-app purchases, frequency of 
purchases, last e-mail or push notification opened, which campaign they 
were converted from, and last action taken inside the app.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
34
Segment Your Users
The first step to marketing to your users effectively is segmentation. 
Segmentation is the process of dividing a user group into smaller segments 
based on different characteristics, such as a age, gender, location, behavior 
patterns and preferences. However, segmentation is based first of all on 
your marketing goals. You may be trying to convert non-paying users to 
paying users, and would therefore segment users based on their financial 
data. You would isolate the non-paying users and try to make them an offer, 
possibly of new features you have designed for the most deeply engaged 
user group. You may want to strengthen retention by rewarding your most 
loyal users, those who use your app the most, and by marketing the rewards 
for loyalty to users who are active but not loyal to encourage them to be 
more engaged.
You may be trying to re-target users who have your app installed on their 
devices but rarely use it, if at all. They are known as lapsing or inactive 
users. In this case, you would isolate users who are the least engaged with 
your app and nudge them into returning to it. It’s all a matter of what you 
want to achieve, but the more detailed your analytics data is, the more 
effective you will be in achieving your marketing goals.
One example worth noting is hyper-local marketing, which segments users 
depending on their proximity to a specific location that is relevant to a 
marketing campaign. For example, an automated marketing platform would 
display an ad for a restaurant, shop, or other establishment to all users 
located within one kilometer from that establishment using GPS data.
Relate and Respond
Once you collect and structure all the data you are gathering through 
analytics about your users, you can use that valuable knowledge to 
personalize your marketing in the following ways:
 Through content. You can design your marketing 
content to match a user’s preferred subject.
 Through design. The history of their responses to 
marketing messages could provide information about 
the type of message and design they respond to best.
 Through timing. A user may respond positively if you 
catch them at a certain time of day, say, after working 
hours, while a message in the middle of the day will be 
ignored.
 Through the right offer. Tailor your offers to your target 
segment’s profile, and you will be successful.

CHAPTER 3: The App Ecosystem
35
Summary
This chapter is all about the different people who determine how an 
app functions, its look and feel, and, ultimately, its fate. Amateur app 
publishers are likely to be deeply attached to their projects and see them 
as expressions of their own ideas and intentions, but more professional 
publishers understand that, like all products, apps are shaped by different 
people and are designed to meet the very specific needs of their users, with 
their success dependent on how well they perform in that respect.
An app is like a living entity that grows with its users. Through their response 
to your product, users will tell you what they want from you, and your 
mission as a publisher is to keep up with your users’ evolving needs and 
expectations.

Chapter 4
App Economics
This chapter is all about money. It is the chapter where we ask (and answer) 
the five big questions that everyone interested in apps as an investment or a 
business wants an answer to:
1.	
How much does it cost to create an app?
2.	
How do apps make money?
3.	
How much money do apps make?
4.	
How can I measure the performance of an app?
5.	
How can I measure the ROI (return on investment) of an app?

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
38
Making an app profitable is a tricky affair and an evolving science. It is as 
much a matter of good design, marketing, and interaction with the customer 
through the mobile interface as it is of financial savvy, and therefore it relies 
on both rational thinking and intuition.
So, how should we look at apps from a financial perspective?
The revenue cycle of an app is illustrated in Figure 4-1.
Figure 4-1.  The app revenue cycle
Although it may seem that the first phase, Investment, needs to be 
implemented just once to create the first version of an app, it’s important to 
understand that each of these phases is constant once the app is online. 
You as a publisher will be constantly investing, constantly marketing, 
constantly acquiring users, and (hopefully) constantly generating more 
and more revenue. If you stop investing in your app once it’s online, you’ll 
eventually stop generating revenue as well.
It’s also important to note that besides going to salaries and other 
operational costs, a part of the revenue your app generates will be invested 
in creating new versions, adding features, creating new in-app purchases 
(and levels, if your app is a game), and generally thinking up new ways to 
keep your existing users engaged and willing to pay.
Big Question 1: How Much Does It Cost to 
Create an App?
This question does not have a clear-cut answer, because the cost varies 
greatly depending on a number of factors. The cost of creating an app can 
range from close to nothing if you are a pro coder building a very simple 

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
39
game on your own to millions of dollars for the mobile version of a popular 
game with millions of users playing at the same time.
A simple standalone app can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars  
(if you’re designing and coding it yourself) to tens of thousands, depending 
on its size, complexity, and platform. Estimating the cost of an app also 
depends on how you are calculating the cost of the hardware and software 
you will need for the task, as well as the developer subscription costs 
involved. If you are developing multiple apps, such costs will be distributed 
among the total number of apps you have published. Location is an 
additional important factor: coding and testing and debugging for an app 
can cost from $10 to $20 per hour in East Asia to over $200 per hour in 
Europe and North America. A backend database can cost anywhere from 
several thousand to tens of thousands to create.
Social media integration for a medium-complexity app can also set you back 
several thousand, and so can an in-app purchasing system. An enterprise 
app can cost tens of thousands of dollars, while a complex game with great 
design, many levels, and in-app purchases can cost hundreds of thousands 
of dollars, or even millions.
The following sections will review the main factors that affect the cost 
of developing and publishing an app. Answering the questions in these 
sections will give you a good estimate of what it will cost to create the app 
you have designed.
App Type
What type of app do you want to create? Is it a simple standalone app 
or game that does not need a backend and can be downloaded and run 
entirely on a user’s device without needing Internet access, like a flashlight 
app, for example? Is it a complex game with many levels, characters, and 
players? Is it a social media app, an enterprise app with a closed group of 
users, or something else?
App Platform
Which platform(s) are you developing for? Your app can be a native app, 
meaning it is designed exclusively for Android or iOS or another platform; 
it can be a cross-platform app, which means it will be built once to run on 
many platforms; or it can be a hybrid app, which means it’s a web app (like 
a mobile website) inside a code “wrapper” that allows it to be downloaded 
and run like a native app.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
40
Cross-platform or hybrid apps cost significantly less than native apps do, 
which have to be developed separately for each platform, but they also have 
their drawbacks, especially with regard to which services they can access. 
Native apps are designed specifically for the operating system that runs 
them, like iOS apps for Apple devices, and can therefore make full use of the 
capabilities of the device on which they are hosted.
As part of your strategy, you might decide to build native apps for each 
platform you have chosen, but you will want to start by building for just 
one platform first in order to test user response, and then build the second 
version for several platforms. This will have a major impact on your cost, as 
building for one platform at the beginning will cost much less than building 
for two or more.
Coding
Who will code the app? Do you plan to code the app yourself, hire an in-house 
coder, or hire online? How much testing and debugging will the app require?
Outsourcing coding on websites like Upwork.com or Freelancer.com can 
save you a lot of money compared to hiring in-house, and coding done in 
an East Asian or Far Eastern country may cost a fraction of what coding 
done in Europe or North America will cost, but there is a downside to it 
as well. Working with coders who are far away will have an impact on 
development speed, as it may have a negative effect on how fast changes 
and improvements are made and errors are fixed. You may find yourself 
getting exhausted with all the back-and-forth and frustrated by the difficulty 
of explaining what you want accurately over Skype or e-mail. There may 
or may not be language-related problems as well. All these things must be 
taken into account when you make your decisions.
Features
What features will the app have? Does it have a backend database or 
social media integration? Does it include separate accounts for users with 
login and content-sharing capabilities, which would require additional data 
privacy and security provisions? Does it have in-app purchases?
App features are individual components that your app may require, such 
as live chat, news feeds, content management features, code readers, and 
delivery or order tracking, depending on what kind of app it is.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
41
UI Design
What kind of UI (user interface) will the app have? Is it a simple, standard, 
pre-designed UI bought over the Internet or a custom-designed UI with 
unique design elements created exclusively for you? Will you require a 
logo design, and, if you will, who will design it? Will you hire a professional 
designer to brand your app, or do you plan to hold a quick design 
competition on Freelancer.com?
Graphics
How graphics-heavy is the app? Will it require extensive and continuous 
design work, like levels and characters for a game, or many priced images, 
like a news app? Three-dimensional worlds and game characters can cost a 
lot to create and maintain, but so can constantly buying images or creating 
your own as content for your app.
Marketing
Are marketing costs included in your cost estimate? How do you plan 
to promote and market your app? What budget have you set aside for 
marketing purposes, and do you have a well-thought-out and budgeted 
marketing strategy?
For example, if you plan to market your app so it reaches the top ranks of 
its category, you will have to take into account that finding and attracting 
paying users is an expensive investment. One of the most important 
calculations you will make is determining how much money on average you 
will spend for every user you acquire compared to how much money you 
expect to make on average from that user over their lifetime as a user. We 
will look at this in more detail later on in this chapter.
Content
Does your app have unique content? What type of content is it? Is 
it information, music, news, movies, or images? Who creates it—the 
employees of the app, paid writers, or the users themselves? How much 
does it cost to create the content?
Updating
How often will the content of your app be updated after launch? Is it 
unchanging, like the content of an e-book app, or updated constantly, like 
the content of a news app?

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
42
Operational Costs
What operational costs are involved in managing the app? Do you have 
salaries to pay, office space to rent, taxes to pay, and content that needs to 
be hosted on servers?
The answers to these questions will also help answer another important 
question: how long does it take to build an app? A basic standalone app 
may take around two months to complete. An app that requires a backend 
server and database may require another two months. App development 
times vary from one platform to another. Android apps take longer to build 
than iOS apps do. Graphics-heavy apps like games will take up to a year or 
more to design, code, and debug before release.
Big Question 2: How Do Apps Make Money?
Apps generate revenue through business models that are based on the 
combination of four different components, as shown in Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-2.  App business model components
Let’s look at each of these components closely.
Upfront Fee
Deciding whether or not to charge a fee upfront is essentially a marketing 
and growth decision. In general, you should have a good reason for charging 
a fee upfront, because the vast majority of apps are free to download, and if 
there’s a free app competing with yours, you don’t stand a chance.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
43
Normally, in the period immediately after your app’s release, you will likely 
be focusing on growth and on building a large-enough user base. A large 
user base is essential to the sustainability of an app as a business, even if 
the vast majority of those users will never pay you a dime, because in that 
base of users there’s the group of potential paying users you are looking for. 
This means giving your app away and looking for other ways to generate 
revenue.
There are four options in this component of your business model:
1.	
You can give away your app for free. This is by far 
the most popular model, and is usually combined 
with revenue-generating options like ads and in-app 
purchases. These will also be an essential part of 
your strategy if you are focused on growth at the 
beginning of your app’s lifecycle.
If your strategy is focused on growth first and revenue 
later, giving your app away for free is the right way to go. 
Later on, once your user base is large enough and you 
shift to revenue generation, charging an upfront fee will 
be irrelevant, as you will be using other ways to generate 
revenue, like in-app purchases.
2.	
Give your app away and charge for a full version. 
This method allows users to try out the app before 
committing to the paid version. This model is known 
as the freemium (free + premium) model.
3.	
Give your app away and charge for the ad-free 
version. This is also known as freemium. In this 
option, you give away the full app with all its features 
for free, but free users get the ad-laden version and 
have to pay for the ad-free version. In this way, you 
can make money from all your users—ad revenue 
from free users and a fee from paying users.
4.	
You can charge a fee upfront. It’s usually very difficult 
to convince users to pay any money upfront in the 
app business because users will only pay for certain 
apps, like popular games or professional utility apps. 
When you charge a fee upfront, you are essentially 
asking people to commit to your app, even if the fee 
is small, and users don’t like to commit to an app 
before trying it out.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
44
Some apps combine an upfront fee with in-app purchases for certain 
features, but this is probably the most difficult to implement without losing 
users. Apply this option only for specific types of apps.
Subscription
One alternative to the upfront fee is the subscription-based app, which 
creates a revenue stream that can support the future growth of your app and 
development costs for updates and new versions.
This revenue-generation method is becoming increasingly popular, as it 
creates a revenue stream and generates more revenue than other models. 
Why only charge $1 upfront when you can charge $1 every month? 
However, to convince users to sign up, you must either have the right type 
of app with renewable content, like a music service or magazine app, or 
provide a consistently great user experience, like a game with new levels or 
challenges every month.
Advertising
Mobile ads come in different sizes and formats and use different methods to 
reach the user. The five basic types are shown in Figure 4-3.
Figure 4-3.  Mobile ad types
Banner Ads
Banner ads are the most popular and common ad format. A banner is 
a narrow horizontal strip at the top or bottom of a screen that displays 
different ads. As there is little space in a banner, such ads contain very short, 
simple messages and rely on visual impact to influence the user.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
45
Interstitial Ads
Interstitial ads take up the entire screen, giving the user a choice of either 
clicking on the ad or closing it to return to the current app screen. Interstitial 
ads need to be used carefully because they tend to disrupt the user 
experience and could irritate and alienate users instead of generating revenue.
Interstitial ads appear at times and on events set by the publisher, such as 
on app launch or exit, or when a specific screen is visited for the first time, 
or at specific intervals, like every third launch.
Native Ads
Native ads are embedded in app content and are designed to be as 
unobtrusive as possible. They work well with specific types of apps that 
display content, like news apps.
One big perceived advantage of native ads is that they are not affected 
by ad blockers, which can block all other types of ads. This is not true, 
however, as ad blockers can block native ads as well.
Rich Media Ads
Rich media ads come in different sizes and combine text and all image and 
video formats.
Video Ads
Video ads display clickable full-screen videos. Video ads are an expensive 
but compelling way to draw user attention and increase engagement.
Ad Blockers
Ad blockers do exactly that—block ads. The most popular means of 
blocking ads are ad-blocking mobile web browsers and downloadable 
content-blocking apps. If an app user has ad blockers installed on their 
smartphone, your app will not be able to display ads, and your ads will not 
produce revenue.
Ad blocking has spread like wildfire among smartphone users since 2015. 
According to a study by PageFair and Priori Data, more than 419 million 
smartphone users in the spring of 2016 had ad blockers installed on their 
smartphones, and 22 percent of smartphone users worldwide were blocking 
ads while surfing the mobile web.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
46
In-App Purchases
The list of what you can market to users from inside your app is endless 
and will change radically depending on the type of app it is and your own 
revenue goals. Here’s a short list of sample in-app purchases you can offer 
your users:
 games market power-ups
 boosters
 weapons
 new levels
 virtual currency
 new characters
Other types of apps market special features or ad-free versions or other 
offers unique to the app.
In-app purchases can also be added or removed depending on your 
revenue goals. You can, for example, create special offers for the holiday 
season or bundle several offerings together with a discount. The only limit is 
your imagination and strategy.
Studies suggest that among the monetization models available to app 
publishers, subscriptions produce significantly more ARPU, or Average 
Revenue per User, over other options like in-app advertising, paid 
downloads, in-app purchases, and the freemium model. This model, 
however, may not be suitable for your app. Choosing the right monetization 
model, or combination of models, for your app depends on both the kind of 
user experience you are offering and how you plan to charge for the value 
you are offering your users.
Creating a Solid Monetization Strategy
The four sources of app revenue we just looked at—the upfront fee, 
subscriptions, advertising, and in-app purchases—will be the main options 
available to you as you develop a monetization strategy for your app. A solid 
monetization strategy is built above all on a thorough understanding of your 
user and your app’s value proposition.
What can your app do for your user? What part of that value proposition 
will you offer for free to capture the user’s attention and loyalty, and which 
features will you offer at a price? Will your user be willing to pay the price for 
in-app purchases?

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
47
The truth is, app publishers that have excellent marketing, engagement, 
and monetization strategies make a great deal of money, especially game 
makers. We’ll look at app revenues next.
Big Question 3: How Much Money Do Apps 
Make?
The immediate answer to this question is “a lot.” Successful apps make 
lots of money, especially games. Apps made a total of $25 billion in 2014, 
and will make an estimated $46 billion in 2016. Much of that revenue 
originates from games. For example, according to statista.com, the top-
grossing iPhone game in the United States as of October 2016 in terms of 
daily revenue is Clash Royale, with $1,969,094, followed by Pokémon GO, 
with $1,562,029, Game of War: Fire Age, with $1,226,442, Mobile Strike, 
with $690,275, Candy Crush Saga, with $478,159, Clash of Clans, with 
$402,001, Candy Crush Soda Saga, with $337,727, Madden NFL Mobile, 
with $281,295, Toy Blast, with $213,516, and Slotomania Free Slots, with 
$186,724.
Also according to statista.com, total mobile gaming revenue in the United 
States has grown from $2.03 billion in 2013 to $2.61 billion in 2016. Total 
mobile gaming revenue worldwide has grown from $9.1 billion in 2012 to 
$24.4 billion in 2014 and $35.6 billion in 2016, and it is projected to grow to 
$44.6 billion in 2018.
Mobile Gaming Spend per Player
Here’s a look at game revenue from another angle: according to a study by 
Slice Intelligence, spend per player in 2015 on the top 25 mobile games 
ranged between $549.99 (yes, $549.99 per player) for Game of War: Fire 
Age and $6.50 for Minecraft. In between were $272.41 for Summoners 
War, $232.67 for Big Fish Casino: Free Slots, $202.26 for Castle Clash, 
$156.20 for Brave Frontier, $127.77 for Marvel: Contest of Champions, 
$126.82 for DoubleDown Casino: Free Slots, $117.91 for Boom Beach, 
$116.25 for Covet Fashion, $112.99 for Clash of Clans, $100.15 for 
Gummy Drop, $83.93 for Family Guy: The Quest for Stuff, $80.81 for Hay 
Day, $80.15 for Kim Kardashian Hollywood, $72.14 for The Simpsons: 
Tapped Out, $70.19 for FarmVille 2 Country Escape, $67.52 for Cookie 
Jam, $66.24 for Candy Crush Soda Saga, $65.76 for Hearthstone: Heroes 
of Warcraft, $61.49 for Candy Crush Saga, $57.08 for Madden NFL Mobile, 
$55.67 for SimCity BuildIt, $55.21 for Farm Heroes Saga, and $38.55 for 
The Sims FreePlay.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
48
Developer Revenue
It’s estimated that over 37,000 developers made more than $10,000 in 2015. 
In the same year, 17,024 developers are estimated to have made more than 
$50,000, and 11,273 developers are estimated to have made more than 
$100,000.
In that year, 6,000 developers are estimated to have made more than 
$250,000, and 3,525 developers are estimated to have made more than 
$500,000.
Still in 2015, 1,887 app developers are estimated to have made more than 
$1 million, either in iOS or in Android, and 132 who developed on both iOS 
and Android are estimated to have made more than $1 million.
Forty-five percent of app store revenues will go to developers outside the 
top 100, who made $2.3 billion in Q2 of 2015 alone. Seventy-eight percent 
of millionaire developers will have made their money in games.
Mobile Payments
It’s not all about games, though. Financial transactions over mobile are 
growing very fast year on year, which is an indication of growing user 
confidence in the reliability and security of mobile transactions. App users 
are increasingly willing to make payments over mobile. The challenge for 
you is coming up with ways to develop a product that can capture some of 
those paying users. The effort, however, is worth it. According to statista.
com, annual mobile payment transaction value has literally exploded over the 
past several years and looks set to continue to do so, having grown from 
$4.93 billion in 2014 to $22.74 billion in 2015 and $74.29 billion in 2016, and 
it is projected to grow to $163.47 billion in 2017 and $745.12 billion in 2020.
Unicorns
Apps can be successful not just in terms of daily revenue, but in terms of 
value as well. There are startups built fundamentally around mobile that 
have valuations larger than the Gross Domestic Product of small countries. 
Some produce significant revenue, but others don’t, and their valuation is 
based on other factors, such as their domination of their niche, ability to 
create disruptive innovation in their sector, and expected future monetization 
potential.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
49
Below is a list of app-based startups that had investment valuations of more 
than $1 billion in 2015. Such startups are known as unicorns, and you are 
likely to have their apps on your smartphone:
Uber (U.S., $41 billion)
Snapchat (U.S., $15 billion)
Pinterest (U.S., $11 billion)
Dropbox (U.S., $10 billion)
Airbnb (U.S., $10 billion)
Spotify (SE, $8.4 billion)
Square (U.S., $6 billion)
Lyft (U.S., $2.5 billion)
Ola Cabs (IN, $2.4 billion)

Big Question 4: How Can I Measure the 
Performance of an App?
How do you measure anything related to how your app is doing? The performance 
of an app can be measured from a technical, financial, or user-engagement 
perspective, and the data is provided by what is known as analytics.
Analytics information is produced by software that is inserted into the code 
of your app and constantly monitors everything that is happening in the app 
and how individual users are interacting with it. Performance measurements 
are known as metrics and KPIs, or key performance indicators.
App Metrics and KPIs
Metrics and KPIs related to the performance and success of an app can be 
grouped into five broad categories:
1.	
Performance Analytics
2.	
User Analytics
3.	
User-Engagement Analytics
4.	
Financial Analytics
5.	
Marketing Analytics

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
50
The first four categories produce measurements made from inside the app 
and are tied directly to the app itself. The fifth category, marketing analytics, 
is produced partly from inside the app (from in-app advertising) and 
partly from outside (your own campaigns in print, social media, and other 
channels) and measures the effectiveness of your own marketing efforts.
Although these analytics look at app performance from five perspectives, 
they all measure how well your app is doing and are closely interconnected.
There are literally thousands of metrics and KPIs you can use to measure 
the performance of an app from these different perspectives, and analytics 
software allows you to customize your analytics reports depending on 
what questions about your app’s performance or your users’ behavior and 
preferences you want to answer.
Metrics and KPIs also differ based on the type of app involved. Games, 
enterprise apps, and commercial apps will set their own benchmarks for 
user engagement, profitability, and virality on social media, will use very 
different metrics to measure success, and will monitor user behavior from 
very different angles. Metrics and KPIs also differ within a single app based 
on your own evolving strategy goals. When you are focused on rapid 
growth, the metrics you will be using to measure how well you are doing 
will be different from the metrics you will be using if you are focused on 
maximizing revenue.
Basic App Metrics
These app metrics are the most fundamental and most common. The 
following form the basis for creating more detailed metrics and will give you 
a quick assessment of how your app is doing:
 Average Download Rate – This metric tells you how 
many times your app is being downloaded over a set 
period of time, like 500 downloads a week, or 150,000 
downloads a month.
 Retention Rate – The number of users an app is 
keeping over a set period of time. Retention is the 
difference between the number of new users an app 
creates within a set period and how many users have 
interacted with the app after another set period. For 
example, if an app gets 500 new users in June, and 
75 of them have used the app in July, the app has a 
retention rate of 75/500, or 15 percent, for this user 
segment.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
51
 Churn Rate – The number of users an app is losing over 
a set period of time. The churn rate is the opposite of 
the retention rate, and the relationship between them is 
as follows:
 Churn rate = (100 - Retention Rate). For example, 
if the app just mentioned has a retention rate of 
15 percent, its churn rate is 85 percent. That’s the 
percentage of the app’s users who are “churning.”
 It’s difficult to measure the number of users you are 
losing over a set period of time, because users may 
have lost interest in an app but kept it on their device. 
What counts as a “lost” customer depends on you: is 
a user who hasn’t opened your app for a month but 
is still keeping it on their device a “lost” user? Some 
users like to keep certain apps on hand in case they 
need them, but may not use them regularly.
 As a result, for some publishers a more accurate 
basis for creating metrics would be to focus on 
active users who interact with an app frequently, 
especially if they are looking to measure 
engagement and financial performance.
 DAU—Daily Active Users – This metric is closer to the 
actual number of users who are actively using your app. 
DAU is the number of users who launch your app at 
least once a day. They may be using your app a dozen 
times a day, but they count only once because you are 
counting them as an individual, not as the number of 
sessions they spend interacting with your app, which is 
another metric.
 Daily Sessions per DAU – This metric will tell you 
how many times a day your app is being used by your 
daily active users. To get this number, you will divide 
the average number of daily sessions by the number of 
DAUs. If your app is being used an average of 150 times 
a day by a DAU of 75, your daily sessions per DAU is 
two, or, in other words, your users are each interacting 
with your app twice a day.
 MAU—Monthly Active Users – This metric is similar to 
DAU, except it measures the number of users who used 
your app at least once in a given month. Note that MAU 
would include someone who used your app just once in 
a month.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
52
 Stickiness – This is how consistently users are 
interacting with your app, or how deeply users are 
engaged with your app.
 
On its Relate blog, app marketing firm Appboy 
calculates stickiness as DAU divided by MAU. The 
higher this percentage is, the “stickier” your app is.
 
Another app marketing firm, Localytics, defines app 
stickiness differently, as the average of an app’s 
Power Users and Loyal Users, Power Users being “the 
percentage of users who launch an app at least 10 
times a month,” and Loyal Users being “the percentage 
of users who return to an app within 3 months of their 
first session.” Power Users represent engagement, and 
Loyal Users represent retention.
 
Localytics publishes an App Stickiness Index every 
quarter, according to which app stickiness hit an all-time 
high of 26 percent in Q1 2015.
 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) – This is the cost of 
acquiring a customer, also known as CPA, or cost per 
acquisition.
 
To measure CAC or CPA, divide your marketing 
campaign costs over a set period of time by the number 
of new users your marketing campaigns produced 
within that period. You can also use the same method 
to measure the effectiveness of a specific marketing 
campaign, like your holiday season campaign, or a 
specific channel, like social media or print ads.
 
The rising cost of customer acquisition is a big issue 
these days, especially given that the money spent 
to acquire a user will be wasted if that user does not 
stick around for very long. In Q4 2015, it stood around 
$2.80. It is generally accepted that an app will retain 
just 10 to 20 percent of its users over time, so the 
cost of acquiring users is partly a recurring one, and 
maintaining a steady and high-enough number of users 
will cost a lot more than $2.80 per user.
 
Conclusion: Strong user engagement will have a very 
big impact on your customer acquisition costs and your 
app’s profitability, as you will spending less on replacing 
lost customers with new ones and more on building a 
truly large customer base. User engagement and loyalty 
are key to achieving success in the app world.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
53
 Average Revenue per User (ARPU) – This is the 
average revenue generated by active users within a 
specific period of time. If your app had 1,000 active 
users in the month of March, and they generated $1,000 
of revenue in the same month, your ARPU for March 
is $1. ARPU helps publishers monitor how revenue is 
changing and take action accordingly.
 Average Revenue per Paying User (ARPPU) – This 
is the average revenue generated within a specific 
period of time by paying users. As the number of paying 
users is much smaller than the number of active users, 
ARPPU is naturally significantly higher than ARPU.
 Customer Lifetime – This is the average amount of time 
your app users will retain your app before abandoning 
it. A customer’s lifetime is inversely proportional to the 
churn rate. For example, if your churn rate is 20 percent, 
then your average customer lifetime is 1/0.2 = 5 months.
 Lifetime Value (LTV) – This is the amount of money an 
average customer will spend on your app throughout 
the time they use it. It’s also known as CLTV, or 
Customer Lifetime Value.
One way to measure LTV is by multiplying the average 
value of a financial transaction generated by your app by 
the number of transactions within a set period, then by the 
duration of an average customer’s lifetime. For example, if 
your gross margin on an average transaction is $2, and the 
average customer makes four transactions a month, and 
the average lifetime of a user is three months, then your 
LTV is 2 × 4 × 3 = $24.
The tricky part, of course, is accurately measuring the 
customer’s lifetime, especially if your app is new and 
you have no past experience you can apply. The way to 
measure a customer’s lifetime is to use the inverse of 
churn, or the number of customers your app loses in a set 
period of time.
The formula for measuring monthly churn is as follows: 
Divide the number of customers lost over a given month 
by the number of customers you had at the start of that 
month. The inverse of the churn rate will be the expected 
customer lifespan. If you are losing 50 percent of your 
users every month (which is quite normal, by the way), your 
churn rate will be 50 percent, and your customer lifetime 

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
54
will 1/0.5 = 2 months. You can then multiply that number 
by the value of the average transaction and the number of 
transactions an average customer will make in your app, and 
you will have the LTV.
LTV is usually compared to CAC as a measure of the 
financial sustainability of an app. If an average user spends 
more on your app over their lifetime than it costs you 
to acquire that user (i.e., LTV is higher than CAC), that’s 
usually a sign your app is doing well and can scale.
Again, like in the case of CAC, user loyalty will greatly 
affect the value of LTV, because as a multiplier, a longer 
lifetime will push your LTV value very high. In the preceding 
example, increasing the lifetime duration from three to four 
months will increase LTV by 33.3 percent, from (2 × 4 × 3) = 
$24 to (2 × 4 × 4) = $32.
 Payback Period (PBP) – This is the time it takes for 
total ARPU to match CAC, meaning the money spent 
on acquiring a customer is recovered from revenue 
produced by that customer.
Figure 4-4 below depicts the relationship between key financial metrics.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
55
Performance Analytics
Performance analytics measure the technical performance of your app, such 
as how long it takes to load and how often it crashes.
The loading time of your app may seem relatively unimportant, but it will 
affect how much users enjoy using it and how many of them will abandon it 
in frustration.
Fast, efficient, and reliable performance is a key component of strong user 
engagement.
Types of Performance Metrics and KPIs
App performance metrics and KPIs include the following:
 App Throughput – the number of requests an app can 
handle over a set period of time
 Application Latency – the time it takes for an app to 
respond to a request
 API Latency – the response time of an API to a request
 App Load per Period – the time it takes for different 
types of requests to load in the app
 App Crash Rate – how often an app will crash for a set 
number of activations
 App Load Time – how long it will take an app to load 
after the icon is pressed
 End-to-End Application Latency – the time it takes 
between the moment a button is pressed in an app and 
the moment the results of that request reach the user
User Analytics
User analytics provide information about the users who are interacting with 
your app. It will tell you in which countries and cities your users live, how old 
they are, what their native language is, what devices they are using, how often 
they are using your app, and how much time they spend on it on average.
Types of user metrics include OS Version Distribution, Geographic Location 
Distribution, Age Group Distribution, Gender Distribution, Device Type 
Distribution, and User Native Language Distribution.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
56
User-Engagement Analytics
User-engagement analytics supply information about how users are 
interacting with your app. It can tell you how many people have downloaded 
your app and how many have kept it (retention rate) or deleted it after a day, 
week, or month (churn rate). User-engagement analytics also create what 
are known as session recordings. As you interact with an app, everything 
you do in your “session” is “recorded” and aggregated with everyone else’s 
session recordings to produce actionable information for the app publisher.
User-engagement analytics can also tell you which parts of your app’s 
content users like the most and which they ignore, which icons or buttons 
they are clicking on the most, what they are sharing, and how often they are 
sharing. Detailed information about users helps you tailor your app to their 
tastes and improve their engagement with the app.
Event Tracking
Event tracking is an aspect of user engagement analytics that monitors 
specific actions users are taking inside an app rather than what they are 
looking at. Event tracking is used to count how many users, for example, 
are answering a question or clicking on a specific button, and it can be 
used to test how well specific app features are working. Event tracking is 
implemented over a set period and changes depending on your design, 
interaction, and marketing goals.
Touch Heatmaps, Cohort Analysis, and Session Playbacks
Tools like touch heatmaps, user journey recordings, session playbacks, and 
real-time reporting can help you understand how your users are interacting 
with your app, which buttons or icons they are pressing, and which parts or 
features of your app they are ignoring.
By supplying accurate real-time information about whether your users are 
interacting with the app the way you want them to, touch heatmaps will help 
you identify and correct UI problems that are frustrating users, optimize the 
user experience, and maximize your app’s revenue potential.
Cohort analysis classifies users into various groups based on different 
factors to monitor user behavior and measure the effectiveness of features 
and offerings.
Session playbacks supply “recordings” of what a specific user did inside an 
app to create a picture of how users are navigating the app and identify pain 
points that need to be fixed.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
57
Types of User Engagement Metrics and KPIs
User engagement metrics and KPIs include the following:
 Daily Sessions per DAU – the number of times a day a 
Daily Active User launches an app
 Average Visit Time – the average time a user spends in 
an app per visit
 Screen Views per Visit – the average number of 
screens viewed in a session
 App Session Intervals – the average time gap between 
a user’s sessions
 Download Count – the total number of times an app 
has been downloaded
 Number of Active Users – the number of users who are 
considered to be active users
 Goal Completion Rate – the number of app users who 
have completed a specific goal you have set
 Number of Sessions in First Week – the number of sessions 
a new user launches in the first week after download
 Peak Usage Times of Day – the times of day when the 
number of users who are using the app is at its highest
 Session Frequency – the timespan between a user’s 
first session and the next one
 Depth of Visit – the number of pages a user visits 
during an app session
 Organic User Growth Rate – how fast the number of 
app users is growing without active marketing
 Number of New Users per Month – the number of new 
users who are downloading the app in a given month
 Permissions Granted – the average number of 
permissions an app user is giving the app
 User Lifecycle Duration – the timespan between the 
moment a new user discovers and downloads an app to 
the moment they abandon it

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
58
 Customer Support Response Times – how long it 
takes for Customer Support to respond to inquiries
 Net Promoter Score – the likelihood that a given user 
will be willing to refer others to your app
 Opt-In and Opt-Out Rates – the percentage of app 
users who opt in for, or opt out of, a given offer related 
to an app
Financial Analytics
Financial analytics provide information about your app’s commercial 
performance and will tell you how much money your users are spending on 
your app, who is spending the most money, and which channels are your 
best sources of revenue.
The types of financial metrics and KPIs are as follows:
 Total Revenue per Period (Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year)
 Total Revenue per Period per Source (Ads, In-App 
Purchases, etc.)
 Revenue Distribution per Period (Day of Week, Day of 
Month)
 Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate
 Brand Awareness Rate
 Total Revenue from Acquired Users
 Average Revenue per Transaction
 Peak Transaction Times
 Number of Items in Shopping Cart
 Transactions per Second, Hour, or Day
 Days from Signup to First Payment
Marketing Analytics
Marketing and advertising analytics show how effective the money you 
spend on marketing really is. Marketing analytics tell you how well your 
marketing dollars are being spent, how efficient your advertising strategies 
are, and which marketing channels are bringing in the most users. It’s very 

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
59
easy in the app business to spend a lot of money and get next to nothing 
in return because of a bad strategy that targets the wrong users, has badly 
written ad copy, or involves expensive campaigns that fail to attract new 
users. Campaign analytics measure the effectiveness of a specific marketing 
campaign, or a specific ad type, over a set period of time.
Marketing metrics and KPIs include the following:
 Pay per Click (PPC)
 Cost per Click (CPC)
 Cost per Loyal User (CPLU)
 Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM)
 Cost per Install (CPI)
 Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
 Average Revenue per User (ARPU)
 Cost per Install (CPI)
 Effective Cost per Install (eCPI)
 Fill Rate
 Click-through Rate (CTR)
 Viral Coefficient (K)
 Number of Shares
 Number of Product Likes
 Conversion Rate
 Number of Subscriptions/Registrations
 Number of User Likes
 Percentage of Mobile Influenced Customers
 Paid Conversion Rate
 Percentage of New Leads
 Organic User Growth Rate
 Push Notification Open Rate

Understanding what your app analytics data is telling you is not easy for a 
newcomer, but over time your investment in information about your users 
will pay off. As a skilled reader of analytics, you will save yourself a great 
deal of money and effort by making wiser marketing decisions.
Big Question 5: How Can I Measure the 
Return on Investment of an App?
Once you understand metrics and KPIs, monitoring the financial performance 
of your app is not very hard. Improving the financial performance of your 
app is a mix between an art and a science, a combination of design and 
good planning.
If you own an app publishing business or have published more than one 
app, each of your individual apps will produce its own return on investment. 
Using the income projections for each app, you can also calculate the 
Internal Rate of Return (the interest rate at which the net present value of 
all the cash flow in an investment is equal to zero) and Net Present Value 
(the present value of a future cash flow) for your investments and your app 
business as a whole.
ROI calculations differ depending on the type of app you are developing 
and the goals associated with it. The goal of a mobile game will be easily 
measurable as revenue from ads and/or in-app purchases, while the goal 
for an enterprise app will also include measuring the financial impact of 
increased workplace efficiency and the benefits of replacing an outdated 
technology with a mobile solution. The benefits of a mobile enterprise app 
can include reducing the duration of business cycles, cutting communication 
costs, improving customer satisfaction and customer service, automating 
business processes, and reducing human resource requirements. All of the 
net benefits and impact of an enterprise mobile solution have to be taken 
into account when calculating the value and return of the investment.
Basic ROI
The ROI for an activity or product is a function of money invested and 
revenue produced. The metrics that go into the calculation of ROI for an app 
are shown in Figure 4-5.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
62
Figure 4-5.  Measuring app ROI
Net Present Value
Net Present Value is a function of projected future cash flows, both positive 
and negative, and a discount rate, usually the cost of capital or another rate 
acceptable for the investor. The metrics that go into the calculation of NPV 
for an app are shown in Figure 4-6.
Figure 4-6.  Measuring NPV
Internal Rate of Return
The IRR of an investment in an app can easily be calculated using the same 
metrics as an extension of NPV. The metrics that go into the calculation of 
IRR for an app are shown in Figure 4-7.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
63
Figure 4-7.  Calculating IRR
Measuring the ROI of an app accurately is a tricky affair and depends on the 
goals behind the release of the app. For example, measuring the profitability 
of a standalone game with in-app purchases will be done differently than 
measuring the financial impact an enterprise app has on a company.
In general, however, the return on investment for a mobile app is the 
result of the relationship between how much money is spent as an initial 
investment and the ongoing cost of acquiring users, compared to the 
revenue those acquired users generate for the developer over their lifetime 
as customers.
What Can I Do to Keep an App Profitable?
Once you are tracking user behavior and producing analytics, you are in a 
position to identify weak points in your app’s design or in your marketing 
strategy that are undermining your profit potential. Many of the resources 
listed at the end of this book will help you compare the performance of your 
app to industry benchmarks so that you know where you stand. So, what 
are your goals for key metrics? See Figure 4-8.
Figure 4-8.  What to do to make an app more profitable

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
64
As a rule, you always want to keep your customer lifetime value, LTV, higher 
than CAC, which essentially means you expect to make more money from 
your users than what you pay to acquire them. Experts recommend keeping 
LTV at least three times higher than CAC in order to keep your project in the 
black.
So, your monetization goals are to reduce CAC, reduce PBP, increase ARPU 
and ARPPU, and raise LTV.
Reducing CAC
The lower your CAC, the higher the ROI. How do you minimize CAC?
Acquiring users will inevitably cost money, but there are ways to maximize 
the acquisition capability of your app. As in the case of increasing ARPU, the 
secret is in the design of the app. Give your users every opportunity to share 
what they are doing in your app with their friends, and your users will act like 
free marketing machines for you. Sharing is the most powerful channel for 
user acquisition, and it’s free!
Increasing ARPU
The higher the ARPU, the greater the ROI. So, how can ARPU be 
maximized?
The first secret to high ARPU is creating a great user experience. Use the 
best practices in app design and interaction to enhance user engagement. 
A highly engaged user will keep your app and use it regularly. The second 
secret to high ARPU is having a highly effective monetization plan. Different 
types of apps and games monetize differently; determine which methods 
work best for your app and integrate them effectively into your design. Users 
who love your app and trust you as a developer will be prepared to pay for 
good features or other in-app purchases. Make it worth their while to pay, 
and they will reward you. See Figure 4-9.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
65
Figure 4-9.  The positive impact of higher user engagement and retention 
This brings us to the Golden Rule of App Publishing Success:
If you want your app to be enormously successful and profitable, master 
user engagement and app marketing.
In short, Great User Experience + Smart Marketing = Money in the Bank
What is the value of strong user engagement?
 Strong user engagement means higher retention and 
lower churn. This means your customers are keeping 
your app longer than average. A low churn rate means a 
higher customer lifetime, and this produces a higher LTV.
 Strong user engagement means lower customer-
acquisition costs. With users sticking with your app 
longer, you will be spending less on retaining existing 
customers and more on acquiring new ones.
 Strong user engagement means greater virality 
rates. Strong user engagement increases the virality of 
an app, or the likelihood that a user will recommend it to 
others or share information about it on their networks. 
If each user convinces one other person to download 
your app, your customer acquisition cost will shrink by 
50 percent.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
66
What is the value of smart marketing?
 Smart marketing leads to more downloads. A strong 
marketing strategy will create solid momentum in the 
number of downloads, out of which you will identify the 
paying customers and capture revenue.
 Smart marketing leads to more paying customers.  
A very small portion of everyone who downloads your 
app will ever pay you any money. The higher that 
number, the higher your profits.
 Smart marketing leads to more revenue. Once you 
have a solid number of paying customers, the marketing 
goal will be to generate as much revenue from them as 
you can.
 Smart marketing leads to greater retention. If you 
don’t know how to keep your customers once they 
are using your app, they will eventually abandon it, 
especially if a competing app captures their attention. 
Keeping your existing users is a marketing domain of its 
own, especially given that keeping an existing customer 
is much cheaper than replacing a lost customer with a 
new one.
The Most Important Question for an App Business
When preparing to publish an app and developing your marketing strategy, 
the most important question you have to answer is the following:
How many paying customers do I need in order to make my app business 
sustainable?
To answer this question, you need to know the following:
 Your operational expenses. How much money will you 
spend on your app business every month, including 
marketing costs and CAC? This will vary greatly 
depending on the type and size of app you have, and 
it will also vary over time as your app draws more and 
more users.
 Your projected ARPU and ARPPU.
 The projected percentage of your users who will be 
paying customers.

CHAPTER 4: App Economics
67
Let’s make a very basic calculation based on the following assumptions:
 You plan to spend $10,000 per month on your app 
business, including salaries, marketing, and other 
operational expenses.
 5 percent (1 out of 20) of your users will be paying 
customers, and they will generate an average of $2 
ARPPU (average revenue per paying user) each and 
every month.
This means you will need 5,000 paying users (10,000 divided by 2) to 
generate the $10,000 per month needed to sustain your business. If 1 out 
of 20 users are paying users, you will need to have at least 100,000 (5,000 
multiplied by 20) users, paying and non-paying, in total to generate the same 
revenue. In this situation, your ARPU would be $0.10 (10,000 divided by 
100,000). If the market benchmark for CAC is $3, you would need to invest 
$300,000 to grow your users to 100,000.
Now, if you were to raise user engagement and retention, say through 
improved marketing and a redesigned UI, and the portion of paying 
customers grew from 5 percent to 10 percent, and the ARPPU grew from $2 
to $4, how would that change your app’s financial performance?
First, you would now need only 2,500 paying users (10,000 divided by 4) 
to generate the $10,000 per month you need to sustain your business. 
Second, now that 1 in 10 of your users are paying users, you would need far 
fewer paying and non-paying users, just 25,000 (2,500 multiplied by 10), to 
generate the same revenue, and your ARPU would be $0.4 (10,000 divided 
by 25,000). With CAC at $3 per user, you would need to spend much less, 
$75,000 (compared to $300,000) to grow your user base to a sustainable 
level for your business.
These figures clearly show the impact that improved user engagement and 
retention can have on an app’s financial performance. Raising the number of 
paying users from 5 percent to 10 percent, and raising ARPPU from $2 to $4, 
may not sound like much at first glance, but it shrunk the minimum sustainable 
level for your app business from 100,000 users to 25,000 and shrunk your 
marketing budget from $300,000 to $75,000, a 75 percent reduction.
Summary
In this chapter and the preceding three chapters, we looked at the app 
publishing industry worldwide, including its evolution, scale, and basic 
economic structure.
In the coming chapters, we will look at how app ideas are generated and 
turned into full-fledged apps.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
70
Welcome to the business of app development.
By now you should know much more about the app development industry 
than you did before you picked up this book. Having absorbed the 
information in the preceding chapters, you are now in a position to launch 
your app publishing career by making informed decisions about everything 
related to your app, from its name, size, color-coding, and content to the 
marketing strategy you will use to promote it.
The app world is full of stories about accidental millionaires who built an 
app just for the fun of it only to see it turn into an overnight sensation that 
generated a fortune. These stories are largely responsible for the fascination 
people have with the app industry and the “Gold Rush” aura that surrounds 
it, especially among complete outsiders. A quick online search can produce 
hundreds of links to books, courses, videos, blogs, and other resources 
that exploit this “Gold Rush” aura and claim to show you how to build and 
publish an app in minutes that can make you rich overnight with little effort 
on your part.
However, as the market matures, taking the app stores by storm and 
making a quick fortune has become an increasingly thin possibility. Today, 
those who have a real chance of succeeding in the app stores are those 
with the most thorough understanding of what makes an app successful: 
great design, high user engagement and retention, and solid and skillful 
marketing. Furthermore, as users become increasingly picky about what 
they expect apps to do for them and abandon apps at the slightest glitch, 
grabbing the attention of users and keeping it long enough for them to 
commit to the app and spend money on it is becoming a challenge that 
demands a professional approach.
Before you take your first step as an app publisher, what you need to do is 
get into the professional app publisher frame of mind. This involves putting 
aside myths and misconceptions that create unreasonable expectations 
and making a conscious choice to rely on solid knowledge and skills. In 
this frame of mind, you will never be in the dark about where your app is 
headed, where your money is going, and what returns you should expect on 
your time and effort. You will not waste your time on irrational expectations 
or your money on misguided marketing campaigns, and you will never waste 
your time by neglecting important steps only to realize you should have 
done certain things much earlier.
Let’s look at what it means to be in the professional app publisher’s frame  
of mind.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
71
The Right Frame of Mind
The professional app publisher's frame of mind combines the mindsets 
of the inventor and the investor. As an inventor, an app publisher directs 
his creativity toward generating solid app ideas with good prospects for 
success, as well as toward solving design, development, and marketing 
problems in unexpected ways that give him an edge over the competition. 
He keeps himself open to new ideas and stays flexible in order to adjust to 
new concepts and approaches to app design, development, and marketing. 
This allows him to stay on top of the market as it matures and evolves.
As an investor, an app publisher realizes that he is putting a great deal of 
time, effort, and money into turning an idea into a profitable business. He 
realizes that a great idea is worth little without effective implementation 
and is a waste of time without strong returns, and as a result he focuses 
on making good use of resources like time and money, on managing a 
development team well, and on marketing his product well.
By combining the creativity and intuitiveness of the inventor mindset with 
the methods, knowledge, and managerial skills of the investor mindset, you 
will start off on the right foot, apply your assets and resources wisely, and 
maximize your chances of creating a big hit in the app stores. You will also 
resist getting distracted by the get-rich-quick mentality and the four big 
myths of app development that are propagated to support that mentality, 
which we will look at next.
The Four Big Myths of App Development
There are four big myths about app development that are quite popular 
among people who see app publishing as a means of getting rich quickly 
without investing time, money, or effort. This perception is also supported by 
actual cases of amateurs who did become unexpectedly successful beyond 
their wildest expectations, but if you take a closer look at how success 
happened for them, you will see that none became successful by sitting 
back and doing nothing. No one has ever just sat back to count the money 
as it rolled in. On the contrary, these successful app publishers reacted 
quickly to the strong user response to their app or game, changed their 
outlook and lifestyle very quickly, hired the right people to complement the 
skills they lacked, and built real businesses around their successful ideas. 
You must be prepared to do the same should it happen to you.
There are four popular myths attached to app development that create 
incorrect expectations and can lead you in the wrong direction.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
72
Myth 1: You Need a Big Idea
We already looked at this earlier. This is the biggest misconception 
among app enthusiasts who want to get into app publishing. Why is this a 
misconception?
Well, for one thing, almost anything you can think of has probably already 
been done, many times over. With millions of apps and games available in 
the app stores, the likelihood of coming up with something completely new 
or something no one’s seen before is close to nil. There are exceptions, of 
course, but the vast majority of games, for example, are built around already 
existing game concepts or physics simulation principles.
The vast majority of games are not original in their concept, but this does 
not mean that there is no originality or inventiveness in app design. It just 
means that this originality and inventiveness usually lies elsewhere. For 
example, successful apps can easily stand out and attract users by offering 
a new take on an already popular app or game. Candy Crush and Angry 
Birds are perfect examples of hugely successful games that are not original 
in their concepts but are highly addictive and successful because of the 
quality of the experiences they provide and the clever ways they retain 
users. Other apps build their success by offering new features or combining 
features from several apps to create a new value proposition.
Myth 2: Making Apps Is Very Easy
Making an app may be easy or hard depending on its function, size, 
and complexity, as well as the skills of the person producing it. An 
experienced programmer who buys an existing simple game that is fully 
functional without a backend and is small enough to be downloaded onto 
a smartphone, changes the game’s look and feel, and releases it under 
a different name in a matter of days will tell you that yes, making apps is 
easy. On the other hand, a professional app development company that is 
working on a personal banking app that allows users to check their bank 
account balances, move money from one bank account to another, and 
perform other personal banking functions will tell you that developing an app 
of this kind is far from easy, as it requires an advanced backend of the right 
size and complexity, very strict security systems, a customer relationship 
management (CRM) system to keep the bank’s customers happy, a user 
experience design that is consistent with the bank’s image and goals, and a 
team of programmers on hand to manage the app and respond very quickly 
to problems that can occur.
The purpose of the “easy” myth is that it helps amateurs overcome their 
fears and the feeling of intimidation inspired by the seemingly daunting 
aspects of app development, especially programming. The important point 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
73
here is this: an app that is worth your time will take some effort. What’s 
the point of making an “easy” app that goes nowhere? Why should app 
development be any easier than any other profession? Would it be a good 
thing if app development were so easy that absolutely anyone could do it, 
and everyone did?
Myth 3: You Can Do It for Free
This is another myth told to amateurs that exploits the “Gold Rush” image 
of the app industry, but this time it takes advantage of the fear of financial 
risk. It is indeed possible to use a basic app template posted on a website, 
populate it with your own content, and publish it. It is possible to do this 
when creating an e-book app, your personal wedding app, or other simple 
app projects that rely on ready-built templates. However, because these 
templates are generic and are not customized for your app’s particular 
needs, the apps you can publish with these templates will have extreme 
limitations and will lack many of the features standard in full-fledged 
apps, like a backend for updates and content management. They will also 
advertise the creator of the free app template, which means you lose out 
on much of the profit opportunities, and the producer of the template will 
promote themselves and their paid services through your app.
The truth behind this myth is this: in the long run, what you will get for free 
will be worth exactly what you paid for it.
Myth 4: You Can Make Apps Without Writing Code
This is the last of the four myths that offer to give you a taste of the app 
publishing universe without any real commitment or effort on your part. 
Again, the myth involves ready-made app templates you can fill in with your 
content and publish on the app stores without writing a single line of code.
Yes, it is possible to publish an app, probably on your own, by getting a hold 
of a template online and filling it with your own content, but this is relevant in 
only a small number of cases where the app has limited use and its content 
cannot be changed after publishing.
If you want to build a full-fledged app, you will need programmers to build 
a backend to allow you to update and manage your content. You will need 
code that integrates social media APIs so your users can share content, 
code for analytics inserted into your app to track user behavior, and code 
to manage the advertising space in your app. These are just some of the 
basic features of apps that cannot be made available to users without 
programmers’ writing custom code.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
74
Furthermore, if your app is not single-use, like a wedding app, for example, 
you will inevitably want to update your app and release a new version of it, 
and inevitably you will need programming skills to do it.
Get Serious
These four popular myths are propagated to create the impression that 
success in the app stores is possible without risk. The truth, however, is 
that anything worth investing in entails some degree of risk, and the only 
real way of mitigating risk is by being committed to a professional approach 
that relies on thorough knowledge and best practices in order to produce 
something users will love.
If you want to approach the app business like a professional, do not rely on 
the “free, quick, and easy” approach, because it will lead nowhere. Instead, 
rely on great design, skillful marketing, and an excellent value proposition to 
propel the adoption of your app forward.
The Most Important Principle of App 
Publishing
If there is one principle that must always be on your mind as you design, 
develop, and distribute apps, it's this:
Marketing is everything, and everything is about marketing.
Let’s look at the first part of this sentence: marketing is everything. This 
suggests, first of all, that in the pre-development phase, relying on your idea 
alone to sell itself to investors will never lead anywhere. No idea is good 
enough to sell itself, and investors will care little about your idea if they do not 
feel you can carry it through to completion. Similarly, no matter how well it is 
designed, no published app will succeed on its own without help from you.
Whatever app you may be distributing, you will have to work very hard and 
be very smart, and have a solid understanding of the market and your users, 
to steer it to success. Marketing is everything when it comes to an app’s 
success, and without solid marketing it will linger forever at the bottom 
ranks of the app store. So, be ready to commit to the marketing effort and 
learn what you need to learn to do that job well.
Marketing begins long before the launch of your app. This is because the 
first days and weeks that follow the launch of your app are crucial to its 
success, and there can be no traction without a community of fans waiting 
for the release, without magazines waiting to publish reports about it, and 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
75
so on. This means you have to start building your community of fans long 
before you actually release the app itself. If you begin marketing the moment 
you release the app, it’s probably already too late.
The second part of the sentence, everything is about marketing, means 
everything that is happening in the app development process, and every 
part of your app, is designed for marketing purposes. Besides the obvious, 
like the design of the app icon, the App Store page, and your own marketing 
campaign, the speed at which your app loads, the level structure, the 
content, the color coding, the sharing capabilities for social media, the levels 
structure (if it’s a game), the services it uses, and the functions it performs—
every single aspect of your app—all revolve around making sure your users 
love it, use it obsessively, and help you market it.
Internal and External Marketing Tools
Let’s face it—app users are highly fickle consumers. They will abandon your 
app at the slightest glitch or pesky ad or delayed response. This brings us 
to another important point: the best marketers for your app are your users. 
No one will promote your app like happy users sharing their views. This 
means you have to be ready at launch time to keep your users happy after 
they have downloaded your app. This includes forums where they can ask 
questions and get user support. For example, if your app analytics identifies 
a point in the app where many of your users are abandoning the app or 
failing to complete their customer journey, you can start a discussion to find 
out what’s wrong. Is it a technical glitch, a design problem, or something 
else? This feedback loop will be invaluable in helping you fix problems fast 
so as to keep your users happy.
This also means giving your users every chance you can for them to share 
their experience of your app with their social circle. Remember, users are 
like advertisers who promote your app for free. Incorporate functions like 
posting on Facebook, Google Plus, and so forth into key points in your app, 
like when a game user breaks his or her own record, for example, or passes 
a difficult level. This is a powerful marketing system that you should not make 
the mistake of ignoring. Asking users to rate your app is another strategy.
In general, keep in mind that there are two main marketing mechanisms at 
work in any app. There is the internal promotion mechanism, like sharing 
functions, posting, content sharing, and app ratings and reviews. Then, 
there is the external marketing mechanism, which involves your own 
marketing activities, like promotions, Google AdWords, magazine ads, online 
advertising, and so on.
So, what does this all mean? It means that you have to incorporate the items 
covered in the next few sections when you start designing and building your 
app, and not just think about translating your idea into an app.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
76
Feedback Support, Internal Promotion, and Revenue-
Generation Strategy
If you start thinking about all these things only after you’ve completed your 
app design, you’ve wasted your time, because you’re only going to have 
to go back and incorporate them. If you understand and incorporate these 
principles into your mindset and design approach from the beginning, you’re 
already on your way to building a well-designed app that has the ingredients 
for success.
Determine Your Marketing and Revenue Strategy Early On
You have to have a good idea about your marketing strategy from the 
beginning, as soon as you conceive your app. In fact, the very nature of your 
app (such as what kind of game it is or what kind of content it produces) 
will to a great extent determine the marketing, advertising, and monetization 
strategies you use because these strategies have already been optimized for 
each type of app.
A game app, for example, will rely a great deal on in-app purchases for 
revenue, but will also combine interstitial ads, banner ads, and video ads 
and sell an ad-free version of itself for a fee.
A magazine app, on the other hand, will publish some of its content for 
free, and will focus on convincing users to subscribe to the full version for a 
monthly fee, with limited or no in-app ads.
Why is all this important? Because these factors will affect the layout of your 
app, level hierarchies if it’s a game, the type and price of in-app purchases, 
the content structure of a content-based app, and nearly every design or 
technical detail.
How to Generate App Ideas
Everything starts with an amazing idea.—or does it? If you are just getting 
started in app development, you are likely to believe that to be successful 
in this business you need to start off with an incredible idea no one else 
has thought of before that will change the world and make you very rich 
overnight. Or, at least, this is more or less what you’re hoping will happen, 
because it has already happened to others more than once.
However, so that no time is wasted chasing fantasies, it would be wiser 
to put aside this Internet “Gold Rush” fantasy and get accustomed to the 
notion that the difference between success and failure has little to do with 
how great your idea sounds when you’re talking about it over lunch with 
your friends, and everything to do with determination and smart decisions.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
77
It’s very much realistic to enter the app publishing industry without that 
amazing idea and expect to do very well. Success is less about changing 
your life overnight and more about understanding the app industry and 
market well, understanding users and their behavior very well, finding the 
right niche for a product, creating a well-designed value proposition and an 
app to deliver it, and tracking the performance of the app while tweaking 
your marketing strategy to build up momentum until it sustains itself 
financially and brings in profit.
In other words, lots of hard work and smart decisions.
This is what will make the difference between success and failure: 
commitment, “sweat equity,” and smarts. As you begin your app publishing 
journey, you need to start thinking less and less like a magician and more and 
more like an investor. You will be investing a great deal of time, effort, and 
money into your projects, so it pays to approach things like a professional.
In that sense, the app business is like any other business. The app industry 
does indeed offer incredible potential to create a product and make it 
available to the whole world with little investment compared to other, more 
traditional industries, but there is no guarantee of success, and you are likely 
to be wasting your time if you believe otherwise. If this is not what you had 
in mind, you might as well keep your day job, because an app built only 
around what you think is a great idea will not survive the brutal competition 
for people’s attention. This brings us to an important point:
Don’t become obsessed with your app idea.
Resist becoming enamored with your app idea. It’s a waste of time, and it’s 
dangerous. It’s dangerous because when you’re deeply attached to your 
idea, you will refuse to abandon it even when it fails. You will keep pouring 
resources into it because you “just know it’ll work,” and will drive yourself 
into the ground.
The app world does indeed have its charm, and just the idea of becoming 
an app publisher may be giving you stars in your eyes, but an app is just an 
app, and an idea is just an idea. It’s just a product for a market, and it will 
need a product-market fit to work, so treat it as such and focus on making 
that work. If it’s not working for any reason, or does not have a unique 
feature or value proposition that sets it apart, it has little chance of grabbing 
user attention or surviving the competition.
So, Where Do I Start?
Is it even possible to “generate” app ideas? Don’t they just pop into your 
head on their own at random? Well, sometimes, but most of the time, they 
don’t. There are highly rational, objective, and reliable ways to generate 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
78
ideas for apps, and rational, objective, and reliable ways for you to test how 
sustainable they are and how likely they are to succeed rather than relying 
on “I just know it’ll work.”
There are two main starting points for the process of generating app ideas 
through the rational method: 1) start with the user and 2) start with the app 
store. First, though, let’s take a look at the intuitive method.
Method 1: Brainstorm
Brainstorming is an activity during which you create a chance for the “bolt 
of lightning” effect to help you. The objective is to bring creative minds 
together so as to benefit from their imagination and experience in the hope 
of generating unexpected ideas through spontaneous insights. You can 
brainstorm on your own, of course, but doing so with a group is more likely 
to generate interesting ideas through the opportunity for interaction.
If you decided to create a brainstorming group, don’t make the group too 
big or too small. Brainstorming in small groups misses the point and lacks 
variety, and groups that are too big tend to move off subject and become 
chaotic. Groups of five to seven people are usually recommended as optimal.
A group brainstorming session can easily sway off track without guidance, 
so make the conversation productive by maintaining focus on your 
objective. The key is to find a balance between facilitation and control. Too 
much guidance kills creativity, and too little leads to chaos, and both will 
make your brainstorming session a waste of time. Keep your group on track 
but create room for the spontaneous and unexpected in order to make the 
most of your session.
Brainstorming can also be done individually, but it lacks the variety of 
insights created by the group. In a group, the flow of creative energy is 
primarily through conversation, but when you’re alone it is not there. How 
can you create a positive flow of creative energy when no one else is 
around? The trick is in finding ways to stimulate the imagination by 
surrounding yourself with objects, text, images, audio, and other material 
relevant to the problem you are trying to solve. Naturally, it’s good to have 
pens and lots of paper around for sketching or writing down anything that 
pops into your head.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
79
Brainstorming is a means of generating app ideas through intuition and 
informal interaction. The other means of generating app ideas is the rational 
path that relies on analysis.
The rational path has two main starting points. You can start with your intended 
users, analyzing their professions, habits, preferences, and daily rituals, or 
you can start with the app stores, analyzing trends, finding niches you can 
dominate, and exploiting the weaknesses or strengths of other apps. Let’s start 
by taking a look at the user-centered method of generating app ideas.
Method 2: Start with the User
One good way to start generating ideas is by targeting a specific group of 
users. The more clearly that user group is defined, the easier it will be to 
deliver a positive user experience to them through your app.
Building an app for everyone is like trying to make everyone happy. It can 
only fail. Targeting a specific group of users who have a very specific need 
that your app fulfills efficiently is much more likely to meet with a positive 
user response.
Personas and Scenarios
A great way to start the process of generating ideas is to pick a user group 
for which you want to build an app. Your target user group can be broad 
(like creating a simple game, which targets as many people as possible) or 
narrow (like an education app for children, a magazine app for women, a 
productivity app for doctors, and so on).
Tip  The value of sketching or writing down your ideas cannot be overstated. 
Do it liberally. Think of the flow of creativity as water flowing through a pipe 
and out from a tap. Trying to hold onto an idea in your head without putting it 
down on paper is like closing the tap, and the creative flow slows down or stops 
completely. By putting what pops into your head on paper, you free your mind 
from the burden of accurate recall and keep the creative flow going.
Note  With brainstorming, you can generate a large number of ideas, but not 
all will be worth pursuing. Follow the brainstorming sessions with a thorough 
assessment of each idea’s potential, and then narrow the list of truly good ideas 
until you decide which one is a worthwhile investment.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
80
Once you have picked the user group you want to target, create as detailed 
a profile as you can of members of that user group. Create a portrait of a 
typical member of the group. Gather as much information about them as 
possible. Ask relevant questions, such as the following:
 Who are they?
 Where do they live?
 What age group do they belong to?
 What do they do for a living?
 What are their shared habits?
 What is their education level?
 What is their gender profile (what percentage is male, 
what percentage is female)?
 What are their core values?
 What do they like to do in their free time?
 What do they like to do for entertainment?
 How do they get information (Internet, television,  
app, etc.)?
 What are their eating habits?
 Where do they go on vacation?
 What are their favorite pastimes?
 What is their predominant relationship status (single, 
married, etc.)?
 What is their income profile?
 What are their general character traits?
Then, ask questions about how your app will deliver value to these users, 
such as the following:
 How will these personas use your app?
 What is their goal or purpose for using your app?
 What are the problems they are trying to solve with your 
app? 
 How will your app solve these problems?
 What would cause these users to reject your app?

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
81
Next, ask yourself questions about how you would market your app to these 
users, such as the following:
 How will these users find you? Which channels are they 
likely to use?
 How will you pitch your app to them? What benefits will 
you advertise?
 How will you defeat the competition to reach your 
users?
 How much will your users be willing to pay for your app?
Combine all the answers to these questions into a typical profile, or user 
persona, of your intended user. The more detailed your knowledge of your 
target user group is, the better your value proposition will match the needs 
of that group or fix a problem for them. Users want apps to do exactly what 
they need them to do, and that’s usually something very specific (watch 
videos, play music, get a taxi, order food, etc). Matching the design of 
your app to a very detailed definition of what your users need the most is a 
guarantee that your app will be quickly accepted.
The pricing strategy of your app is something that will also benefit greatly 
from a detailed understanding of your users, especially their income levels 
and likelihood of spending money inside an app, which is a metric that 
varies greatly among user groups and platforms.
Equally important, the better you know your user group, the more effective 
and personalized your advertising or push messaging or marketing 
campaigns will be. For example, if you want to design an automated 
advertising campaign (called programmatic advertising) using push 
notifications sent to your app users, you want to know what time of day and 
what day of the week are the best to send those notifications out so that 
your users will be likely to read them and respond. Not knowing the optimal 
times to reach your users will lead to lots of money and time wasted on 
failed advertising campaigns.
Creating a User Persona
Creating a detailed user persona is key to your app’s success. It involves 
analyzing human behavior and talking to your future users.
Analyze Human Behavior
After choosing a user group you want to target, start observing the behavior 
of members of that user group as they go about their day. Focus on 
identifying patterns and pain points. Ask yourself what problem you could 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
82
solve or process you could facilitate through an app that would save them 
time or money or effort, or allow them to do something with your app they 
could not do before that improves their lives in some fundamental way.
Talk to Your Future Users
Go from passive observation to active interaction. Interview members of 
your intended user group so that they can tell you what they need in an app. 
Maybe they already use a particular app for a specific purpose, but wish it 
had additional features that are important for them. Talking to your users is 
invaluable for generating ideas, as they will save you a great deal of time by 
telling you what to build for them instead of your having to spend so much 
time and effort trying to find out on your own.
A user persona is a description of the intended user of your app, and that 
description needs to be shared with everyone on the design, development, 
and marketing teams so that everyone works in the same direction and for 
the same target user (Figure 5-1).
Figure 5-1.  Typical user persona characteristics
In many cases, you will have several user personas because your product 
might work for several categories of users. If that is the case, then the whole 
team must again have all of these personas in mind when developing the 
app. Negative personas are also useful, namely who will not be interested in 
your product, so that the team knows which design and marketing methods 
to leave out of the development strategy.
Your app development team will apply this knowledge about the user 
persona everywhere, from design to marketing. You will identify keywords 
that appeal to the persona as well as design and layout styles, color codes, 
marketing approaches, and a unique selling proposition intended specifically 
for that persona. 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
83
Creating a User Scenario
While a user persona is a description of who your user is, a user scenario 
is a description of how your typical user behaves while pursuing a specific 
goal, and how they carry out a specific task as a sequence of steps. Again, 
observing your users and talking to them is the right method for developing 
user scenarios.
Building user personas and scenarios with these methods should be giving 
you not just abstract ideas for apps, but also a detailed understanding of 
how your app can offer them value as well.
Apply the user personas. They will help you design the app and its content 
for your users much better and will help you tailor your advertising and 
marketing strategies to their demographic characteristics and habits.
Optimization Through Localization
Localizing an app begins with internationalization, which allows the app to 
display different screens and different languages depending on the user’s 
location and spoken language. A localized app has content in several 
languages and displays the appropriate language for the user. This is a very 
important aspect of app development that raises adoption rates significantly. 
An English-language app, no matter how well designed, will not do as well in 
a country like China, for example, as a Chinese version would do. There are 
more than 150 countries on the Apple Store, and English is spoken widely in 
only about half of them.
When it comes targeting a specific user group, the importance of localization 
cannot be overstated. Localization is generally about publishing your app 
in different languages, but cultural factors also play a role, or should play a 
role, in adapting an app to different markets. Even if your target user base 
is very broad, effectively targeting a group in one country or culture will 
differ radically from targeting the same group in another country or culture. 
Teenagers in the United States think and behave differently than teenagers 
in India or Japan do, and a small business startup in an African country will 
have different concerns than a startup in Germany.
Another aspect of localization is marketing. If you want to target your app 
users with push notifications when they are off work, in Spain you can do 
it in the early evening. During summer months in the United Arab Emirates, 
sending push notifications late at night, when most people are out enjoying 
themselves and escaping the daytime heat, is a good strategy.
Finally, localization is also useful as an App Store Optimization strategy. 
Translating your app name, description, keywords, images, and videos, 
publishing it as a separate app, and creating a custom App Store page 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App

in the target user’s own language in a local App Store can help your app 
climb the charts fast, especially if the local store has fewer competing 
apps. Having a top-ranking localized app in another country, no matter how 
small, will give your original app a powerful marketing boost. How many 
times have you seen an app advertised as “Number one in Croatia!” or “Top 
App in its Category in Vietnam!”? This is achieved through localization. 
The following parts of an app can be localized for different countries and 
languages to help propel your app upward: the app’s name, content, date 
and time formats, keyboard, units, App Store description, keywords, images, 
text on screenshots, and videos.
Localization costs money, and the scale and complexity of localization 
should be taken into consideration when you are generating app ideas and 
developing your marketing strategy. Localization is part of the game no 
matter what you are designing or for whom. It applies to all types of apps 
and to all user groups, so give it the attention it deserves.
Now, let’s take a look at two other interesting user-centered methods for 
generating ideas: improving a profession and improving a process.
Improve a Profession
This is another good starting point for generating app ideas. Pick a 
profession, possibly your own, that you want to improve through an app. 
Analyze in detail the tasks and procedures that form the practice of that 
profession. Identify processes that suffer from bottlenecks, delays, or 
complications that an app could fix or eliminate. Design an app to deliver 
this solution as efficiently and effectively as possible. Think of your app not 
just as a tool to make a profession more efficient, but also as a potential 
game changer that could totally overhaul the profession you are targeting.
Improve a Process
Outside our professional lives, our personal and working lives also consist 
of different processes and rituals of varying lengths and complexity. Each 
of them is open to analysis and rethinking: ordering a pizza, paying a 
bill, buying a plane ticket, getting a plumber, monitoring a patient’s vital 
signs, finding the closest drugstore, checking your bank account balance, 
changing money from one currency to another, sending someone a photo 
from your camera, learning a new language, and so on.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
85
Method 3: Start with the App Store
The third main source of app ideas is the app stores themselves, where all 
the competition and some of the marketing are happening. Apple has one 
main App Store, as well as local app stores for more than 150 countries. 
Apps are constantly moving up and down the popularity charts, fighting for 
position and the attention of users.
Each app has its own individual path in the various app store charts, and 
there are short-term and long-term overall app store trends. Watching these 
trends and closely following the performance of apps can produce countless 
app ideas if you know how and where to look.
A good starting point is the iTunes app charts, where at any point in time 
you can see the top free apps, the top paid apps, and the top-grossing 
apps. You can view the most popular apps in different categories, like 
Games, Social Networking, Lifestyle, Utilities, Education, Photo & Video, 
Productivity, and Travel. You can also narrow down your search further, like 
App Store ➤ Games ➤ Puzzle.
However, it’s crucial to remember that the app charts display results based 
on the country in which you are located, so it’s impossible to use it to follow 
global trends. For global trends, which are probably more important, one 
great source of information is App Trace (www.apptrace.com), which gathers 
and displays statistics about how iOS and Android apps are doing around 
the world. You can see the top 300 apps overall on iTunes or Google Play, or 
the top 300 apps in a particular category, and even search by specific dates, 
which can help you identify trends over time or follow an specific app’s path.
For example, if you are targeting the Education category, it’s interesting to 
discover that the median price for education apps on iTunes on September 
21, 2016, was $2.99, and that just 16.2 percent of apps in that category on 
that date were free apps, compared to 64.7 percent overall. As you can see, 
with just a simple scan App Trace can help you make key decisions about 
your app, in this case its pricing strategy.
App Annie (www.appannie.com) publishes detailed information about nearly 
every aspect of app store monitoring, including app rankings and app store 
trends, which allow you to monitor which apps are doing best, follow a 
single app’s rankings and downloads over time, or find out how individual 
keywords are trending using the Keyword Explorer tool. It even has a video 
that introduces subscribers to the basics of monitoring app store trends.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
86
Identify a Profitable Keyword Niche
Finding a profitable keyword niche is a good approach to generating app 
ideas that have a higher chance of success, because of the high demand–
low supply relationship. It involves locating an area of the app business that 
gets a lot of attention from users but where the available offerings are less 
than the demand. To do this, you will need to use keyword tools to find what 
are known as long-tail keywords (Figure 5-2).
Figure 5-2.  The parts of the search demand curve
A long-tail keyword is a longer and more focused keyword that web and app 
users use to search for the products they want. For example, the keyword 
“car” is a short keyword, while “used car parts stores for Ford Mustangs in 
Alabama” is a long-tail keyword.
The term “long tail” originates from the shape of the distribution graph 
of search terms. Short, general keywords form the “head” of the dragon. 
However, despite the fact that there are a very large number of searches 
using short keywords, the overwhelming majority of searches are made 
using long-tail keywords; in other words, the long tail is very long indeed. 
According to Wordstream (www.wordstream.com), head keyword searches 
account for just 10 to 15 percent of the total number of searches over any 

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
87
period of time. Medium-length keywords account for another 15 to 20 
percent, and long-tail keywords account for at least 70 percent of searches 
over any period of time. That’s a very large number.
Long-tail keywords are important because they give you an opportunity to 
rank very high in a specific area, rather than struggling to attract attention in 
a very broad niche with far too much competition. By focusing on long-tail 
keywords, you narrow the niche for which you are targeting users, which 
may seem counterintuitive, but you also create a big opportunity for yourself 
to dominate that narrow niche.
Furthermore, focusing on a narrow niche has the added advantage of 
targeting those users who are looking for precisely what you want to offer, 
which means they are far more likely to be paying customers if you make 
them the right offer. So, the difference between short, broad keywords and 
long-tail keywords is the difference between quantity and quality: is it better 
to reach a thousand customers who are unsure about what they want or to 
reach ten who want precisely what you have to offer?
Another advantage of long-tail keywords is that online advertising costs are 
lower because competition in a narrow category is much lower as well.
Not all long-tail keywords, however, are profitable niches. There are long-tail 
keywords for which a market of users does not exist. The secret to success 
with a keyword niche is to find a very specific area where there is significant 
demand but limited supply. In other words, there are many searches with a 
certain long-tail keyword (proof of demand), but very few good products that 
cater to it (proof of market). When you find such a keyword, the next step is 
to build an app around it.
How Can I Find a Good Long-Tail Keyword?
Start with a short term in the subject you are considering, such as “recipe” 
or “car.” Use a keyword tool to generate the top long-tail keywords in that 
category. There are a number of online keyword generators, including free, 
freemium, and subscription-based ones, that can do it for you. Keyword tools 
will generate keyword niches, or groups of related keywords that can be used to 
build apps and promote them. Good keyword tools will also publish information 
about the level of competition and the total number of searches related to 
a long-tail keyword, which you can use to identify the low competition–high 
demand niche you can target. Here’s a short list of some options:
 Google Keyword Planner
 Google Trends
 Wordstream's Free Keyword Tool
 Yoast Suggests

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
88
The same keywords that you used to build your app will also be used for 
ASO, or App Store Optimization, to maximize the chances of an app’s 
standing out and being found by its targeted users.
Compare, Improve, or Flip Apps
This approach to developing app concepts focuses on existing apps and 
uses their features, strengths, weaknesses, and position in the app store 
rankings as a starting point to developing improved versions that benefit 
from existing and proven demand.
When looking at different apps, you may come across one that’s doing 
relatively well but lacks an important feature that would give it a bigger edge 
over the competition. This can be the basis for a new app concept, as the 
success of the original app suggests there is strong demand for it, and an 
improved or enhanced app could draw many of the original app’s users.
In fact, one great strategy for developing an app concept is to group all 
the successful apps in a specific category, analyze their key features and 
weaknesses, and develop a new app that combines all the great features 
and eliminates the weaknesses. This a surefire way to end up with an app 
concept that has a strong prospect of success.
To apply this approach, you need to become an obsessive app downloader 
and tester. Pick an app category, find the best performers in that category, 
and download as many of them as you need in order to make thorough 
comparisons between them. Use a highly analytical process to identify what 
makes each of these apps successful. If there are more than a few apps 
in a category that are successful, this suggests that each of them has a 
specific feature that users love and don’t want to do without. This screams 
opportunity. Identify these features, combine them into a new app with great 
UI/UX design, and you have a winner.
An alternative approach to benefiting from the strengths of popular apps 
is to benefit from the weaknesses of apps that are doing badly. The 
bottom ranks of the app store are full of apps that are built around good 
concepts but are unsuccessful because of specific weaknesses in design 
or gameplay, or a missing feature or two, or a bad marketing strategy. 
This is a good playground on which to find a potential winner by taking an 
unsuccessful app that has a good concept or set of features and building a 
new app that eliminates the weaknesses that are holding the original back.
App flipping, or app reskinning, is quite fun and is a quick way to enter the 
app business and make your first buck. It is based on the same principle 
as house flipping and doesn’t require an original or any other kind of overall 
idea at all.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
89
To flip an app, you first buy the source code of the original app, normally a 
game, modify the look and feel (colors, content, images, characters, levels), 
maximize the advertising space, and release it under a different name. 
One popular app-flipping tactic is to pick a game that is already relatively 
popular, find the source code for a similar game, change the look and feel, 
and release the app under a name similar to that of the more successful 
game. This allows you to not just publish an app at a relatively low cost, but 
also to capitalize on the success of the other app.
Other Sources of Inspiration
Finally, a third domain from which you can extract app ideas is that of 
external sources, which are sources other than your potential users and the 
app stores. This domain is limitless, as anything can be an inspiration for an 
app idea.
As an app publisher, focus on becoming a keen observer of everything 
happening around you, from global events to your immediate environment, 
and look at things from an app publisher’s perspective. You will find that 
inspiration is not far away. Social media—for example, Facebook, Twitter, 
Pinterest, and so forth—are a great source of information about upwardly 
mobile trends because the reaction to events on social media is very quick.
The secret to doing this successfully is responding quickly so as to exploit 
any global or local trend in the form of an app, and also picking a trend that 
is not likely to fizzle quickly and looks set to be relevant long enough for you 
to exploit it. This means having a team around you that is ready to get to 
work quickly, to grab market share from the competition and maximize the 
gains from a trend before it fizzles. Here are a few examples of events and 
trends that can serve as the source for app ideas:
 The growing popularity of a tourist destination
 Sudden media frenzy around an app (like the Flappy 
Bird craze)
 New government regulations that change the way an 
industry functions
 New technologies that are set to give birth to a whole 
new generation of apps (like robotics, drones, and self-
driving cars)
 Political events like elections and sports events like the 
Super Bowl or the Olympics

How to Assess and Validate App Ideas
The app concepts you have developed based on the strategies we have 
looked at are still just concepts, and they have to go through a thorough 
evaluation to determine how strong their prospects for success really are 
before you invest in them. At the very least, especially if you are new to the 
app business and are not ready to develop several apps in parallel, it’s wise 
to narrow your list down to the best concepts, prioritize them in the order in 
which they will be developed, and start with the best.
To find the winner on your list, ask the following set of questions and assess 
the answers:
	1.	 Does your app fulfill a need, a want, or both? 
A “need” differs from a “want” in that a need is 
something your user feels they cannot do without, 
while a want is something that is non-essential but 
highly desirable. How well does it fulfill that need or 
want on a regular basis for the user?
	2.	 Does your app offer a feature, service, or experience 
that sets it apart from other apps in its category, 
especially the most popular ones? Is this feature, 
service, or experience enough to attract large 
numbers of users and keep them engaged?
	3.	 How will you structure the user experience to keep 
your users engaged? Are you prepared to invest more 
time and money after the app is published to keep 
your users engaged and retain them in the long run?
	4.	 What is the niche that this app will target? How 
broad or narrow is it? Have you accurately estimated 
market size for your app?
This is an important question, and the answer will 
determine many things about the final product. For 
example, an app that targets a broad niche, like teenagers, 
for example, will focus on driving large numbers of 
downloads with a free version and then sell extra features 
in the app to make a profit. An app that targets a narrow 
niche, like doctors, for example, is more likely to be a 
paid app with a very specific purpose and set of features 
tailored to a user base willing to pay for them.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
91
Knowing the size of your target market is also important 
if you are seeking external financing. It’s also important to 
make sure that the market you are targeting is a growing 
market, or at least a stable one. You don’t want to be 
climbing onto a sinking ship.
One important point worth mentioning here is that many 
successful apps have not targeted an existing market, but 
rather have themselves created completely new markets 
and dominated them. Apple essentially created the 
smartphone market, and Uber created the taxi app market.
	5.	 Can your app concept be successfully monetized? Is 
this niche prepared to pay for your app or its in-app 
purchases, or will you rely on ad revenue? How likely 
are you to make a profit, how many users do you 
need to do so, and how should you structure your 
offering to maximize your revenue?
In short, to make, say, $10,000 (before the app store takes 
its cut), will you get one million users to pay one cent, or 
get 10,000 users to pay $1? What income group do your 
users fall into, and how easily do your users part with their 
cash for apps and in-app purchases?
	6.	 What is your break-even point? How much will 
you be investing in your app, and what will be your 
operating costs? Do you anticipate enough revenue 
to recover your original investment and cover your 
operating costs?
	7.	 If your app develops traction and grows a strong 
user base, are you prepared to invest more money 
and build a business around it?
The answers to these questions will produce a great deal of information about 
how your app should be designed and how it needs to function in order to 
make your users happy and make you a profit. If the answers are thorough 
enough, it’s safe you say you’re halfway to publishing your app, because from 
this point on you will be very clear about what you want, what works or doesn’t 
work, and where to start. You will do what you need to do from the beginning 
of the design process to make sure you get the final product you want.
The conclusions you reach from the answers to these questions will help 
you design your app around the feature or experience that sets it apart, 
identify the pricing strategy that will maximize your user base and your 
revenue, and efficiently market your app to its target niche.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
92
Validation
When you are assessing app ideas in terms of their prospects for success, 
it’s very helpful to have some way of knowing that there is demand for 
your app before you commit to it. Validation is a way of confirming your 
projections and expectations before investing in your app concept. By 
validating your app concept, you ensure that there is enough demand 
for your app to make it successful and that you are not wasting time and 
resources on a dead-end project people are no longer interested in.
Validation, of course, is not an exact science, and no matter how good you 
are, there are never any guarantees that your app will be adopted in large 
numbers. Accurately forecasting adoption is very difficult, if not impossible, 
but there are ways to at least make sure that your app is likely to be 
positively received and that there are enough people who want the product 
you are planning to build.
All the methods listed next are accepted ways of validating an app idea. 
Ideally, you would use all, or at least most, of them to generate as much 
useful information about your intended user group’s response to the 
upcoming app release.
Method 1: Create a Basic “Coming Soon” Website and/or 
Social Media Page for Your App
Create a basic website landing page about your upcoming app, with 
analytics built into it. The purpose of this website is not to advertise the 
app, but to gather information about your prospective users’ reactions to it. 
Describe your app and why you think it will be a success, and include some 
form of call to action that will gauge visitors’ reactions, such as asking them 
to sign up for a newsletter or sign up to be notified when the app is about 
to be released, asking them to share the page, or asking them to offer some 
feedback. You can also ask them questions like “Would you download this 
app if it were available?” For users who answer they wouldn’t, ask them to 
tell you why not. It may be because there is already some stiff competition 
and they see no need for another app in that category, or it may be because 
they see a flaw in your design, or something else entirely.
You can also build a Facebook page and use Facebook ads to test your 
concept with the public and build an audience for your product.
A landing page is not useful just for you. It is also very useful as proof of 
concept if you are planning to raise money for your app or your startup. 
The number of likes on your page and the analytical data will go a long 
way toward proving that demand for your concept is big enough to justify 
investment.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
93
Now, start promoting the app website. Advertise in ways that allow you to 
target those users who form your desired market. Analytics embedded in 
your website will supply you with a wealth of information about your users. 
Combine this information with the responses to the call to action and you 
will generate a great deal of useful information about how your future users 
are likely to respond to your app and how likely they are to download it.
According to Apptentive (www.apptentive.com), getting a positive response 
on your app idea is a good thing, but is not worth that much in terms of 
validation. The key to effective validation is to determine whether your 
visitors are prepared to pay for your app, and this is the key to determining 
how financially sustainable or profitable your app is likely to be.
If you want to use your website to build up buzz about the app’s release, 
include a blog and/or newsletter and ask people to sign up to receive the 
newsletter or notifications about the latest blog entries. That way, when it’s 
publishing time for your app, your audience will be waiting.
Method 2: Find Out How Many People Are Searching for 
Apps Like Yours
Using keywords related to your app idea, use a keyword tool to determine 
how many searches are done for these keywords. Apply both broad 
keywords and specific keywords. If the number of searches for your chosen 
keywords is high compared to the number of available offerings on the app 
stores, this is a clear sign that there will be a market for your app if it’s built 
around that specific keyword.
Method 3: Find Out How Apps Similar to Yours Are Doing
This comparison process has two aspects. One involves looking at how 
apps in your category are doing on the app stores, how many downloads 
they have, how fast they are climbing or falling, and how overall demand for 
them is changing over time. This will tell you whether you are in a growing 
market, a stable market, or a shrinking market. It will also tell you how many 
downloads you should reasonably anticipate over time.
The second aspect involves looking more closely at the main competitors 
in your market, especially user reviews, feedback, and conversations about 
these apps on forums and blogs. Use this information to determine where 
your competitors are making mistakes or what users say these apps are 
lacking so as to determine how your app should adapt to attract as broad a 
user base as possible.

CHAPTER 5: Imagine Your App
94
Method 4: Check Demand for Keywords Related to an  
App Topic
If you have an idea for an app that is based on an external trend, topic, or 
event, like the Olympics, an election, Black Friday, the Christmas shopping 
season, Mardi Gras, and so on, use keyword tools to check how terms 
related to that idea are doing in search, how many apps are trying to 
respond to demand in that search area, and how well these apps are doing. 
If your app cannot differentiate itself from other apps enough to stand out, 
and these competing apps are not doing well, your app is also unlikely to do 
well unless you modify it sufficiently.
For the Serious Appreneur: MVP Publishing for 
Beta Testing
If you are committed to your app idea, one good way to test it and generate 
a great deal of useful information is to release an MVP, or Minimum Viable 
Product, to a small group of testers and get their feedback. As an app, an 
MVP will contain the core functions of your intended final product without any 
of the frills. The point is to determine how the beta testers are using the app, 
where they are having problems, and what they dislike about it. This will also 
keep you from wasting your time on features users do not care about.
By building an MVP, you are already halfway there as an app publisher, and 
you have a product your target market (or at least part of it) is already using. 
There is really no other way to see in real-time how your intended users 
are interacting with the app. You might even find out that your users are 
interacting with your app in innovative and unexpected ways! Releasing an 
MVP is an app-validation information gold mine!
Summary
Get it right! Approach the process of generating app ideas rationally and 
methodically. Use the method you like most or, better yet, use all the methods 
listed in this chapter to generate a reasonably large first set of app ideas.
Use keyword searches and other methods to paint a fairly accurate picture 
of demand and supply and anticipated profits. Narrow your list to the 
idea that has the best chances of success. Next, validate your app idea. 
Commit to it.

Chapter 6
Design Your App
Every app has a lifecycle, a journey that begins with an idea and matures 
into a fully functional app available for download in the app stores.
But what happens in between? What process does an app go through as it 
becomes more than just an idea?
There are several stages to an app’s evolution into a finished product. Each 
stage defines the app’s functions, look, and feel in more detail, after which 
the first prototype is created and tested thoroughly and the final version is 
produced for release.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
96
Getting to launch day, however, is only half the story. There is a great deal of 
work to be done after launch, including marketing, performance monitoring, 
and making adjustments. In fact, as your app picks up momentum and 
downloads increase, your involvement with it will inevitably grow as you 
seek ways to improve it, overtake competitors, and monetize it.
Apps are much more than just code. In this chapter, we will look at how 
apps are assembled, what their important parts are, what standards are 
used to design and code them, and what principles app designers must 
adhere to if they want to have a great product that will be successful in the 
app stores.
At this stage, you are defining what is known as the user experience, or how 
a user will interact with your app.
Before Launching the Design Process: Know 
What You’re Doing
Now that we have looked at popular myths about app development (see 
previous chapter), let’s take a peek at what apps are really made of and what 
we have to keep in mind while developing them. A realistic and thorough 
understanding of what goes into building an app will help you ensure your 
apps are professionally built from the start.
Choosing a Platform
Before you begin developing an app, choose the platform you want to 
develop for first, most likely iOS or Android. Each has its upsides and its 
downsides.
The upsides of developing for iOS first are the relatively small number of 
devices, the faster time to a product, higher levels of user loyalty, and a 
system that is kept safer from malware.
The downsides are stricter standards and the longer time for app approval. 
In terms of monetization, Apple has a smaller number of customers than 
Android has, but these customers are known to pay more on average.
The upside of developing for Android first is the much larger market of 
potential users (around 80 percent of devices worldwide). Other key 
advantages of Android include fast app approval and ease of distribution.
A downside is the very large number of devices, screen sizes, and 
resolutions your app needs to cater to. Developing for Android is also known 
to take longer than developing for iOS.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
97
iOS Native Apps: 13.9 Percent of Smartphones  
(in 2015 Q2)
iOS native apps run on Apple devices and are developed with the 
Objective-C or Swift programming languages using Xcode software, which 
is free to download and use on Apple computers for registered developers 
who have paid the annual fee.
Android Native Apps: 82.8 Percent of Smartphones  
(in 2015 Q2)
Android native apps run on all devices that use the Android operating 
system. Hundreds of different smartphone brands run on the Android 
system, including Samsung, Huawei, Lenovo, Xiaomi, and HTC. Android 
apps are developed with the Java programming language using free 
software like Google’s Android Studio, Eclipse, NetBeans, JEdit, and other 
Java programming tools.
Windows Native Apps: 2.6 Percent of Smartphones  
(in 2015 Q2)
Windows native apps run on devices that use the Windows Phone Operating 
System. Windows apps are developed with the C++ and C# programming 
languages and the .NET framework using free software like Microsoft Visual 
Basic.
Hybrid Apps
Hybrid apps, also known as cross-platform apps or universal apps, are apps 
that are developed once using web development languages like HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript and are then given a “shell” that allows them to be 
deployed on the Android, iOS, or Windows operating systems.
The upsides of developing a hybrid app instead of several native apps 
are the significantly lower cost, the faster time to release, and their much 
easier maintenance needs. The downsides are that hybrid apps can lack the 
sophistication of native apps and make more limited use of the capabilities 
of the various devices than native apps do.
Hybrid apps are developed with services like PhoneGap, Appcelerator 
Titanium, and Telerik. Most sites that allow users to build apps for free or 
without coding skills build hybrid apps.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
98
Optimal Strategy
The first version of any app almost always needs improvement. If you want 
to develop native apps, develop on one platform first to keep costs down 
and your learning curve short, then publish the new version on all platforms. 
Or, if cost is the biggest challenge, start by developing a hybrid app.
Clarify the Concept
This stage in your app’s lifecycle is the first step your idea will take toward 
becoming a full-fledged app. The key activity in this stage is to narrow your 
focus, put together the information you gathered and decisions you made 
in the previous chapter, and describe your idea in terms that can be used to 
build a prototype for a product.
Your idea will now go through a clarification process with regard to the 
following:
Type – What kind of app are you building? Is it a game, 
socialization app, utility app, or another kind? What 
category would it fall under in the app store?
Purpose – What is the app’s main function? What are users 
supposed to do with it?
Features – What other things can it do? Do these 
capabilities support the main function, or are they 
secondary functions a minimum viable product can do 
without, but that are good to have because they bring 
added value?
Market – Who is it for? Who are its main users? Are you 
targeting a narrow niche or a broad audience of users?
The answers to these questions will guide you as you design the structure of 
your app, its look and feel, and its details.
Clarify the Scale and Cost
There are also a number of related questions that will define how big and 
complex your app will be, and therefore how long it will take to build. 
To further develop the app concept, you need to answer the following 
questions:
Size – What is the size of your app? Is it a small standalone 
app that can be fully downloaded and run on a smartphone 
even without an Internet connection, or a larger app that 
will require a mobile backend to manage it?

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
99
Content – What will the app’s content be? If it is a game, 
that content would be game characters, levels, images, 
sounds, and so on. If it is a news app, then the content 
would have to be constantly updated, and in some cases 
automated or user-generated.
Will you be creating the content, or will your users be 
sharing it between themselves? Will it be curated, or will it 
have to be sourced from different places at a cost to you?
Data Gathering – Will you gather information about 
your users through analytics? This question may not 
seem important at this early stage, but it’s highly relevant 
because your approach to gathering information about 
your users will inform your app’s design, especially the 
responses that you will solicit from your users at different 
points in the user experience.
Monetization Model – How will your app make money? 
This question is closely related to the design of your app 
and is not something unrelated that you simply apply to 
your design later on.
Many apps are designed around a specific monetization 
method. For example, small games that look like copies 
of other games are copied precisely to benefit from the 
success of the original game and are offered for free to 
maximize downloads. They are stuffed full of different types 
of ads to benefit from clicks. These apps use interstitial 
(full-page) ads each time you open or close the app, every 
time you switch from one level to another, and every other 
chance they get. They are designed purely for the purpose 
of making money without effort.
Other apps, like more sophisticated games, have a fully-
functioning free version and charge for in-app purchases 
and additional functions or levels. This model is known as 
freemium.
Certain types of apps are subscription-based. This 
monetization model is suitable for magazine or video 
apps, which can logically charge a certain fee every 
month for their content, and is growing in popularity 
because of its ability to produce a steady stream of 
income for publishers.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
100
What type of monetization model do you want to use for 
your app? An ad-based monetization model will not have 
a profound effect on design except to occupy permanent 
screen space (and possibly irritate your users), but a model 
based on in-app purchases will affect the very core of how 
your app will function and engage and retain its users.
Graphics – How design-heavy is your app, and how 
much design work will it need to function? A simple game 
will not require much in terms of visuals, but some apps, 
especially sophisticated games, will require constant work 
on graphics. You will have to decide whether you will have 
to produce visuals on a regular basis.
The Parts of an App
When designing an app, keep in mind that what you’re designing is not a 
finite bit of software with a fixed user interface confined to a mobile phone 
(although it might be, if the app is a tiny game). It’s a lively entity that 
extends beyond the mobile phones that host it, and, depending on what 
type of app it is, it will regularly change its content and feel while constantly 
gathering data about its users and their behavior. There will be database 
administrators and content managers working together somewhere to 
maintain the app and keep users engaged with their product, as well as a 
customer relationship management team responding to user inquiries and 
feedback. As Figure 6-1 shows, an app has several groups of standard 
components, each of which must be managed separately to make for a 
successful app. Each of these will be discussed.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
101
Figure 6-1.  Standard app components

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
102
The User Interface
This is the part of the app that interacts with the user, receiving commands 
and displaying content. It normally defines the user experience using the 
following elements:
Assets are files that an app uses, like images, sounds, 
game characters or textures, and icons.
Informational Components are visual elements that 
communicate information to the user, like tooltips, icons, 
progress bars, notifications, message boxes, and pop-up 
windows.
Navigational Components help the user find their way 
through the app, like sliders, scrollers, search fields, tags, 
buttons, and navigational icons.
Input Controls allow an app to receive input from the user 
through user interface elements like checkboxes, radio 
buttons, dropdown lists, list boxes, buttons, toggles, text 
fields, date and time fields, dialogs, and pickers.
The Backend
This is where the app publisher hosts and manages the content an app 
displays and the data it gathers. The backend normally consists of the 
content of the app, which is modified or updated at relevant intervals by the 
publisher, the user database, which contains demographic and behavioral 
information about the app’s users, and the analytics component, which 
delivers that information and creates reports for the publisher.
Code
The code that runs an app has different components depending on 
programming language and platform, but all relatively complex apps have 
the following parts: the main program of the app, code snippets for analytics 
inserted into the main program, code snippets for social media sharing of 
app content, code snippets for ads to be displayed in the app, and APIs 
(Application Programming Interfaces) that allow an app to deliver content to 
the user.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
103
Commercial Package
The commercial package of an app contains everything that will be used 
to market the app on the app store and online: images of the app icon, 
screenshots, images of videos for ad content and marketing purposes, and 
text, like the app description for the app store, keywords that will be used 
for SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and ASO (App Store Optimization), 
and marketing copy.
The Goals of App Design
Design, as Steve Jobs said, is not about what it looks and feels like, but how 
it works. Beyond looking nice and performing well, however, design also 
serves different purposes at different levels of user involvement.
Your app will be competing with millions of other apps for attention, with 
users spending no more than a few microseconds deciding whether an app 
icon and short description are worth a closer look. So, your design strategy 
and quality better be good, or your app will flop.
As shown in Figure 6-2, your app will have to steer users through four levels 
of interaction: discovery, engagement, retention, and monetization.
Figure 6-2.  Goals of app design

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
104
At each of these levels, design is crucial to maximizing your app’s potential. 
Ultimately, a very small percentage of users who see your app will download 
it, and a tiny percentage of those who download it will ever spend any 
money. Design goes a long way toward maximizing that number, which 
means good design leads to strong revenue and a solid return on your 
investment.
Discovery: Getting Users to Find an App
App discovery is mostly about effective marketing, but does design also 
play a role in app discovery?
Yes, it does! With so many competing apps, your app’s name, icon, 
screenshots, videos, and description page on the app store need to be 
designed to catch the eye and to create the right kind of visual impact so as 
to convince the user to try out your app.
Users take no more than a couple of seconds to decide whether an app is 
worth downloading, so use them well.
Engagement: Getting Users to Like an App
Users also take no more than a few seconds to decide whether they like an 
app, so time is of the essence here as well.
Give your users a quick taste of what they expect the app to do. Near-
instant gratification is the best way to get users to keep exploring and 
“engaging” with your app.
Maximize user engagement by creating an experience built around 
gratification and achievement. Your app should do what it promises quickly 
and effectively so users decide it’s worth keeping.
Retention: Getting Users to Keep an App
Retention is all about creating long-term value for your users.
The vast majority of apps are abandoned after about a week. To avoid this 
fate, keep your users involved by making your app an indispensable part of 
their lives.
Depending on what type of app you have, keep your users involved with 
well-timed notifications, updates, and new features, levels, content, and 
offers.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
105
Monetization: Getting Users to Spend Money
The ultimate goal, of course, is creating value and profit. Money will be 
made by offering additional value to users who are the most highly engaged 
with your app and are prepared to pay for that additional value.
This extra value is normally sold in the form of in-app purchases, like new 
features, a pro or full version of a free app, or new levels, characters, or 
weapons, in the case of games.
In-app purchases can be offered as single transactions or as a monthly or 
annual subscription.
Transition Points
Once your app is up and running, many of your additional design and 
marketing ideas will revolve around the three transition points between the 
phases of a user’s relationship with your app. You will be modifying your 
app’s design and your marketing content to push users from discovery 
to engagement, from engagement to retention, and from retention to 
monetization. Each transition is different in its nature and will require 
different approaches and techniques.
Mobile App Optimization
Mobile app optimization is the process of making small, incremental 
changes to your app to gauge user reaction until you arrive at the optimal 
design that brings in the maximum amount of profit.
The first version of an app is highly unlikely to be a perfect match for its 
users’ desires when it’s released. It’s likely to have “teething problems.” At 
the same time, it’s very difficult to tell exactly where the problems are. How 
can you solve this problem?
This is where incremental changes come in. Start by identifying the actions 
that a user is expected to take at specific points in your app—open a file, 
send a message, share their experience, create content, and so on. Then, 
look at the paths that a user will take to get to that action. These paths are 
known as funnels (Figure 6-3).

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
106
Time to Value
One measurement of an app’s power to engage users is known as Time 
to Value. This is a business term that measures the time between when a 
request is made for something that’s defined as a value (a business goal) 
and when that value is delivered to the customer.
In an app, this would be the measure of how long it takes a user to reach the 
point where the app serves its primary function. If the app is a messaging 
app, for example, Time to Value is a measure of how quickly a user can 
actually compose a message, identify a recipient, and send it.
Users like apps to be an extension of their intentions. If you want to send 
a message, you don’t want to go through too many steps before getting to 
the point of pressing “Send.” If Time to Value is too long, then the user is 
likely to see the app as too cumbersome or complex. Time to Value is not 
the same for all apps. As a process, it differs from app to app depending on 
what the app’s primary function is.
It pays to recall, however, that Time to Value is not the single aspect of your 
app’s design that will determine its value to a user.
Start with a Great App Design
Great app designs consist of several constituent aspects, each with its own 
essential components (Figure 6-4).
Figure 6-3.  Funnel for app optimization

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
107
Specifically, there are four fundamental aspects that combine to increase the 
likelihood of a positive response from users:
Information Design – The content of your app needs to be 
useful, relevant, accurate, and properly structured so users 
can easily find what they want. Also, make sure to update 
your content regularly so users will keep coming back.
Software Design – The software that runs your app needs 
to work efficiently so that it does not crash and can handle 
new functions and a fast-growing number of users.
User Interface (UI) Design – A well-designed UI is key to 
user approval and takes into account ergonomics (can the 
app be used with one hand or just the thumb?), navigation 
(is it intuitive and quick?), and consistency (are icons and 
navigation buttons consistent and coded by color, shape, 
and sound throughout?).
Figure 6-4.  Components of a great app design

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
108
User Experience (UX) Design – Creating a positive 
experience for users is the guarantee of your app’s 
success. A positive experience consists of engagement 
(how long do users interact with the app?), enjoyment (is 
the app fun to use?), and achievement (does the app help 
them do something useful?).
Apps are coded differently depending on which platform, like iOS or 
Android, will host them. They also have a reach that extends far beyond 
your smartphone. They connect to a database to download content and 
record user data, while some apps that use geo-location communicate with 
every other user of the app to link users together. Most will help you post 
something you want to share on social media and know much more about 
you than you would expect.
Let’s look at these four components in more detail.
Information Design
Information design encompasses how the content of your app is structured 
and the different levels of information users will have access to in different 
parts of the app (Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-5.  Information design
The structure of the information contained inside your app depends on two 
main considerations. One, the nature of your content: is it about images, 
video, text, or a combination of all three? Two, your user engagement 

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
109
considerations: how much of your content do you want to reveal at first 
glance, and how much do you want to keep deeper inside; how much do 
you want to concentrate on a single page, and how do you want to point to 
deeper content from that page (Figure 6-6)?
Figure 6-6.  Information design
For an information design to be successful, the information you use needs 
to have three characteristics: accuracy, hierarchy, and relevance.
Accuracy
This is the most fundamental characteristic of all the information you will 
ever publish in your app, and it is particularly important if you intend to 
update your content regularly. Always make sure any information published 
in your app is accurate.
This is especially true of apps like news apps or magazine apps that 
publish a great deal of regularly updated content. Checking the accuracy 
of published information, or making sure the information you use is from 
respectable and reliable sources, is something that needs to be part and 
parcel of your content-creation system.
Hierarchy
The hierarchy of information in your app decides how much users get to 
see at first glance, and how deep they need to travel to access the rest. 
This structuring of information is determined by the need for consistency of 
navigation and your monetization strategy as well. For example, users can 
read short summaries of articles for free, but need to subscribe to access 
the full articles.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
110
Organize the information you plan to publish logically and create a hierarchy that 
suits your needs. If you want to draw users into your app, you have to decide 
what to publish on the home screen or another key screen, like “All our blog 
posts,” for example, to get the user to explore further and read your blog posts.
Relevance
All the information you make available to your users needs to relevant to 
their needs. Relevance is about consistency of content across your whole 
app and consistency of the image you are projecting to your users. For 
example, if your app is a health-related app, all the content needs to be 
about the user’s health and enhance the feeling that the user is getting 
useful information for improving their health.
Software Design
Software design (Figure 6-7) may not seem to have a direct connection to 
the design of the app itself, but the connection is there, and it’s an important 
one: if your software fails to deliver, your app doesn’t stand a chance.
Figure 6-7.  Software design
In terms of how it’s designed, the software for your app needs to adhere to 
three principles: functionality, efficiency, and flexibility.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
111
Functionality
Your code should work, period. No crashes, no bugs, no dead-end 
navigation. It should deliver what it’s supposed to deliver to the user without 
fail. It’s your responsibility as the publisher to thoroughly test your app, 
eliminate crashes, and fix bugs before release.
Note: The term “functional” in this context means “working” and is unrelated 
to the term “functional programming,” which represents a different concept 
altogether.
Efficiency
Having efficient code means delivering value to the user with the least 
possible effort. Inefficient code, even if functional, will make an app feel 
burdensome and slow. A good example is your app’s load time. If your app 
takes longer than an instant, 1 to 2 seconds, to load its primary interface or 
at least a splash screen, you’ve already got yourself a frustrated user.
Flexibility
Flexible software is designed from the outset for scaling. It takes into 
account any projections of how your app is likely to grow in the future and is 
already structured to make that evolution process as smooth and quick as 
possible.
User Interface Design
The user interface is the user’s space of interaction with the app (Figure 6-8).

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
112
To function properly and deliver a positive experience, the user interface 
should be built around three principles: ergonomics, consistency, and 
navigation.
Ergonomics
Ergonomics takes into account human factors in the layout of a user 
interface, like the size of the human hand and the thumb’s circular motion. 
Can your app be used with one hand without frustrating the user? Can 
both adults and children use it with one hand? Are you avoiding placing 
buttons in uncomfortable-to-use locations on the screen? These are signs of 
carefully considered ergonomic design.
Consistency
Consistency means meeting a user’s expectations of where everything 
should be. If you place a navigation button in a corner on one screen, it 
should stay in the same corner on every other screen on which it’s used, as 
the user will expect it to be there.
Consistency also applies to your app’s responses to hand gestures on the 
screen. A press, long press, small swipe, or large swipe should produce 
identical results every time.
Figure 6-8.  User interface design

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
113
It creates familiarity, and familiarity enhances the user experience by 
maximizing the user’s comfort and confidence when using your app. 
When the user is not confused, they use the app much faster, their finger 
movements speed up, and the app becomes much more of an extension 
of their intent and a tool to do something efficiently, thus building the user’s 
attachment to the app and the likelihood of long-term adoption.
Navigation
Clear communication of navigation means the user is always intuitively 
aware of where they are, how to get back, and how to return to the 
starting point if they decide to. Clear navigation supports the positive user 
experience by never allowing the user to feel lost in the app.
User Experience Design
Giving your users a positive experience is one of the most effective methods 
of marketing your app (Figure 6-9).
Figure 6-9.  User experience design

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
114
A crowd of users raving about how great your app is is an unbeatable 
marketing tool, and building that crowd depends on your ability to deliver 
the following levels of interaction and sentiment: engagement, enjoyment, 
and achievement.
Engagement
A positive user experience has three levels. The first is engagement. An 
engaged user has already responded positively to their first impression of 
your app. They like it and want to explore it further. They are curious about 
its features and capabilities.
Enjoyment
Once your users have become familiar with your app, they will move to 
Enjoyment. They are having fun with the app, and the feeling of enjoyment is 
stronger and deeper than the feeling of engagement.
Achievement
When your users are able to implement the app’s intended function, they will 
get a positive but short-lived sensation of achievement. As they repeat that 
function over time, perhaps the first week or two, they will get a deeper and 
stronger feeling of achievement related to what your app can do for them, 
or to what new elements it brings into their life. They can now do things they 
could not do before—they can take photos in a new way, track their finances 
on the go, hold meetings with several colleagues, and so on. That deeper 
sense of achievement is what will bind users to your app.
Additional Aspects of Great Design
Great design allows a user to understand how everything in your app 
functions and achieve their purpose without any experience of undue 
effort. Any experience of effort frustrates and alienates, and to avoid it user 
experience designers apply the following principles.
Clarity (Directive Design)
Clarity involves the consistent use of colors, shapes, and text to quickly 
inform the user about what the app does and the options that are available 
at any point inside the app.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
115
The point of directive design is to make sure the user is never confused 
about where they are, where they need to go, or what they need to do to get 
what they want.
The Value of Intuitive Design
To make your app appealing to users, the visual design and navigation 
need to be as intuitive as possible. This means that the user should find 
everything they are looking for precisely where they expect it to be. In other 
words, an intuitive design is a precise match between a user’s expectations 
and their experience. Intuitive suggests that there is little or no rational 
thinking; a user does not ask himself “What do I do now?” when interacting 
with your app. Rather, whatever they decide to do, the buttons they need to 
press to get it done are right in front of them. This makes a user comfortable 
with your app and helps them seek a deeper user experience. Problems with 
navigation will always prevent your user from engaging deeply with your app 
and will do everything to drive them away.
To make an app design intuitive, you need the following:
 Core path – The path a user takes to use the app’s 
core functions should always be directly visible and 
accessible.
 Directives – A directive is a “command” from you that 
asks the user to do specific things at different points 
in your app. Icons that say “open,” “send,” “copy,” or 
anything else are essentially giving the user directives to 
do what you want them to do or asking them to choose 
from a set of options you are creating.
 Anchoring – Any icon that performs a key navigation 
function across the app should always be in the same 
place and should not be moved around depending on 
how your content changes or at random. If you create an 
expectation at the launch of your app that a specific button 
is in a certain place, the user will always expect to find it 
there when they need it. The Home button on an iPhone is 
not just visually anchored, but physically anchored as well. 
As a result, the user always knows how to get back to the 
home screen whenever they want. Anchoring is particularly 
useful for key functions like returning to the home screen, 
leaving an app, and so on (Figure 6-10).

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
116
 Familiarity – App publishers are always looking for 
ways to make their app designs stand out and differ 
from everyone else’s. While pursuing originality and 
uniqueness is generally a good idea, there is one thing 
you should never mess with, and that is the symbolic 
power and familiarity of the icons you will use. There 
are many styles available for the same icon—square, 
round, shadow, no shadow, color, black and white, and 
so forth—but the meaning of an icon remains the same, 
and you should never mess with it, because you will risk 
losing its symbolic meaning.
 Simplicity – Always resist the temptation to complicate 
your designs. This is truer for smartphone screens than 
for anywhere else. Smartphone screens keep getting 
bigger, but they still represent very limited visual real 
estate for you to use.
Cramming more and more functions onto a screen is a 
sure sign that you don’t understand your app, what its core 
function is, or what needs to be directly accessible and 
what can be placed on the side.
Figure 6-10.  Anchoring: Consistency of icon placement

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
117
Simplicity, however, is something that needs to be 
achieved, and with some effort. That effort usually involves 
understanding your user and how your app is structured 
to meet that user’s needs. As Steve Jobs once said, 
“Simplicity can be harder than complex. You have to work 
had to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it’s 
worth it in the end because once you get there, you can 
move mountains.”
In your search for the simplest solutions to the design problems at hand, 
you will be getting a lot of help from design guidelines, which are created to 
ensure the minimum required levels of ergonomics and functionality.
App Design Standards and Guidelines
App design standards and guidelines are created by the companies that 
build the platforms on which apps are run. These standards and guidelines 
are based on an understanding of human ergonomics and best design 
practices. They are designed to ensure apps function properly, to give users 
the necessary quality of experience, and to create a consistent aesthetic 
that is harmonious with the image platform manufacturers like Apple and 
Google want to create.
By complying with these guidelines in the design and layout of your apps, 
you ensure that the app is much more likely to be approved for publishing 
and that users will find the app appealing and easy to understand, navigate, 
and use. You can also save a great deal of time by downloading and using 
UI kits and templates that are built using these guidelines.
Platform Guidelines
Platform guidelines are design guidelines set by the companies that build 
the platforms on which apps are run.
Apple human interface guidelines can be found at:
https://developer.apple.com/design/
Android human interface guidelines can be found at:
http://developer.android.com/design/index.html
Windows human interface guidelines can be found at:
https://dev.windows.com/en-us/design

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
118
Apple
For companies like Apple, the application of its human interface guidelines 
in app design is essential to an app’s being approved for release. The 
company has detailed human interface guidelines for iOS, macOS, 
watchOS, and tvOS.
Tools and Resources
The following sections discuss some tools and resources you may find 
helpful in designing an app.
Patterns
Design patterns are standardized solutions to user-interaction issues that can 
be used over and over again. There are collections of thousands of patterns 
available online and in print that can solve almost any interaction design 
issue you might have. For example, design patterns for iOS, Android, and 
other platforms suggest the best ways to design dialogs, tips, invitations, 
demos, transparencies, popovers, sidebars, notifications, photos, tab bars, 
signups, walkthroughs, videos, charts, widgets, shopping carts, comments, 
posts, events, filters, empty states, grids, home screens, and much more.
For iOS design pattern inspiration, visit iOS Pat terns (http://ios-patterns.com/) 
or Pttrns (http://pttrns.com/ios-patterns/).
From a Sketch to an App
Now turn your ideas into sketches, sketches into designs, and designs into 
a coded app.
Turning a concept into a design involves looking at it from different 
perspectives. You can draw a flowchart to illustrate your concept as a 
sequence of steps, or do some layout sketches to illustrate your concept 
as a collection of app screens. The following sections discuss different 
approaches and tools.
Pen and Paper
Nothing brings ideas forth like doodling on paper. On a clean sheet of paper, 
you can draw anything, from icon designs to screen layouts to flowcharts 
or anything else that comes to mind, and this freedom to doodle and move 
between ideas and options before moving on to digital tools is important for 
the creative process.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
119
User Flow Charts
User flow diagrams look at the app design from the user’s point of view. 
They illustrate the user’s journey through an app and the decisions they have 
to make and input they have to submit at key points of interaction.
With the flow charts and decision tree in hand, the next step is usually to 
design the screens for each part of the flow chart.
App Design Templates
To make your screen designs more accurate, use templates to set the icons, 
buttons and other visual assets in proportion. You can also use special 
app-design sketchpads with smartphone templates and dot grids for a very 
quick and accurate visualization of your designs. The templates suggested 
here are available to download for free in .pdf and .png formats.
Free and premium design templates and sketchbooks are available on 
interfacesketch.com, sneakpeekit.com, ideatoappbook.com, dotgrid.co, 
appsketchbook.com, popapp.in, uistencils.com, and smashingmagazine.com.
Stencils
Stencils work great with templates to produce accurate layouts. They 
contain the most common buttons and visual elements that are used in 
app design. Free and premium stencils are available on uistencils.com, 
mobilestencil.com, and elsewhere. Stencils are also available in digital 
formats, like Basiliq (https://castle.co/design/basiliq).
Wireframes and UI Kits
Wireframes are detailed designs of screen layouts in your app. They show 
the layout of different elements on the screen and the connections between 
different screens. They tell you that pressing a button on one screen will take 
you to another screen or activate a certain function. They also show you the 
total number of screens your app has and how each of them looks.
Given that many app features are similar and are governed by design 
standards and guidelines, collections of standardized screen layouts, known 
as wireframe kits, can be downloaded from various graphic design websites 
in different formats, such as for Photoshop, Illustrator, and Sketch.
UI kits and templates are fully designed user interface collections used to 
speed up the design process. They come with their own sets of elements 
like icons, buttons, sliders, fonts, backgrounds, and textures, as well as  
pre-designed layouts for activities like e-commerce or chat.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
120
Many kits have names, like Helium UI Kit, Flat UI Kit, and Universe UI Kit, 
and come in various formats suitable for graphic design software like Adobe 
Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Sketch. They can easily be found online 
on speckyboy.com, sketchappsources.com, wireframes.tumblr.com, and 
elsewhere.
App development companies also create their own UI kits to create a 
consistent aesthetic and visual language for their own products, while digital 
artists create and sell UI kits that can be downloaded and used in the layout 
and wireframing phase of an app project.
The following sections present some popular app wireframing and design 
tools.
Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Experience Design  
(www.adobe.com)
Adobe has a suite of design tools that are applicable to app design, including 
Photoshop for image manipulation and app layouts, Illustrator for vector-
based graphics, and InDesign for layouts. Adobe also has other Creative 
Cloud tools for HTML-based apps, like Edge CC and PhoneGap Build.
Adobe Experience Design is what Adobe calls its all-in-one tool for 
designing websites and mobile apps, while Adobe Digital Publishing is a 
content management system that works with Experience Design to deliver 
content over mobile.
Omnigraffle (https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
Omnigraffle is part of a suite of digital design tools for user-experience 
design geared for Apple devices.

Build an App on Your Own
Before answering this question, you need to answer another one: do you 
know how to code for iOS or Android, the main app platforms?
If you have the needed coding skills, building an app on your own will be 
much easier. If you lack coding skills but plan to build an app on your own 
anyway, there are platforms that can help you do that (see the list in the 
“Resources” section at the end of the book).
If you plan to build an app on your own, in order to expect a reasonable 
measure of success you will need the following skills:
 Coding in the Swift and Java programming languages 
for iOS and Android apps, respectively.
 Web design and graphics. You will need to make icons 
for your apps, visuals like screenshots for your app’s 
page on the App Store and on Google Play, and ads of 
different sizes and formats to promote your apps. You 
may also need video production skills (and software) 
if you plan to promote your app on YouTube or Vimeo. 
Finally, you will need web design skills for your app’s 
website.
 Marketing skills. You will need skills like knowing how to 
identify the best keywords for App Store Optimization, 
how to write keyword-rich advertising copy, and how to 
design and write marketing emails and online ads.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
122
The Time Factor
Building an app on your own will naturally take much longer than it would if you 
were working as part of a team or outsourcing the work. The time it will take to 
produce a finished app must be taken into account when working alone.
The Cost Factor
Developing an app on your own naturally costs much less than it would 
if you were to work with professionals. However, the opportunity cost of 
developing the app on your own must also be taken into account: can you 
afford the time?
The Quality Factor
If you want to develop an app on your own, you need to make sure you 
are able to insert key components like social media sharing capabilities 
or analytics code that are crucial to the success of your app. Can you 
realistically develop a high-quality app with no help from the pros?
The Next Step
Once you have a complete wireframe, you just need the following to build 
your app:
 The app design wireframe, with the screen layouts, 
active and interactive elements like buttons and forms, 
and connections between screens.
 The app content, namely anything in text form that will 
be a permanent part of the app (as opposed to regularly 
updated content like news), from button names to game 
instructions, disclaimers, and app documentation. This 
also includes updatable content that will be part of the 
app when it’s first downloaded.
 All the assets, like icons, images, videos, sounds, 
backgrounds, and game characters that the app will 
reference.
 All necessary access information. For example, if 
you are registered on an analytics platform, but your 
programmers are in another location, you will have to give 
them your username and password so that they can set 
up analytics for your app based on your requirements.

CHAPTER 6: Design Your App
123
You can then hand over this package to the programmers who will be 
coding the app. The more thorough and detailed the wireframe is, the 
quicker and cheaper the coding process will be. Getting stuck in coding 
glitches because of bad design is a highly frustrating situation for everyone 
concerned and is very time-consuming to fix. It can also push your 
development costs up, so investing the time and effort to create a thorough 
and well-thought-out design and wireframe will pay off several times over in 
the coding phase.
The Apple Way
If you’re developing for iOS, Apple provides a complete app design and 
development environment that you can use to both design and code your 
app at the same time. The development environment, Xcode, is also fully 
integrated with iTunes Connect, Apple’s content management system. You 
will use iTunes Connect to submit the app for review and, if approved, to 
publish it on the App Store. In the next chapter, we will look at how to do all 
this.
Summary
The design phase of an app is when your concept will gradually take shape 
as a unique product with its own value proposition. This is when you will 
make all the key decisions about how your app will look and function. What 
you are pursuing in this phase is a well-thought-out design that is built on a 
thorough understanding of the user, is capable is scaling easily as its user 
base grows, and has a smart monetization strategy that will make the most 
of attracting your users’ dollars.
Good design is about more than just coming up with a good-looking 
product. Your app will probably go through several design iterations before 
you achieve a good product-market fit. More than anything else, good 
design is about adaptability without the loss of core identity, as it takes into 
consideration the future success of your app from the start so that you’ll be 
ready and able to adapt quickly when it happens.

Chapter 7
Building Your App
Once you have a complete design for your app, you can proceed to the 
building phase. Before building an app for iOS, you must first register as a 
developer with Apple and build a development team. Each member of your 
team will have their own status and levels of access, depending on their 
role. Once the team is ready and roles have been assigned, you can start to 
shape your design as a storyboard or wireframe. But first, let’s look at what 
makes the Apple system unique.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
126
Develop with Apple for Apple: A Complete 
System
From the hardware to the software, from the programming language 
and operating system to the online marketplace, Apple has a complete 
proprietary system in place for developers to design, develop, and publish 
apps for Apple devices (Figure 7-1).
This is fundamentally different from Google’s system, where the operating 
system, Android, is hosted on literally hundreds of device models built 
by almost as many manufacturers and uses a very popular programming 
language, Java, which means apps can be built with any Java-based tools. 
Google also manufactures its own devices, like the Nexus and Pixel, and 
has its own app-buildings software, Android Studio, but in no way does it 
exercise exclusive control over how the apps that are hosted on Google Play 
are designed and built.
Let’s look at the components of Apple’s app development and publishing 
system.
iOS (http://www.apple.com/ios/ios-10/)
iOS is an operating system developed by Apple to power its mobile devices, 
including the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. All apps that are hosted on 
Apple mobile devices are iOS apps.
The latest version of the operating system is iOS 10. As of November 2016, 
92 percent of all apps available on the App Store are designed for either iOS 
9 or iOS 10.
Figure 7-1.  Develop with Apple for Apple

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
127
Swift (https://developer.apple.com/swift/)
Swift is a programming language developed by Apple specifically for its 
operating systems, namely iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and Linux. Version 
1.0 was first released in September 2014, and the latest stable release 
as of April 2017 is Swift 3.1.1. Before Swift, Apple’s operating systems 
were written in Objective-C, which is itself based on the C programming 
language. Swift retains many Objective-C concepts but is designed to be 
safer, more concise, and simpler to use. In 2016, Apple introduced Swift 
Playgrounds, an iPad app that teaches Swift programming through an 
interactive, game-like interface.
Xcode (https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
Xcode is Apple’s IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, designed 
for storyboarding, wireframing, and prototyping apps for the iOS system, 
including macOS, iOS, WatchOS and tvOS. In other words, developers can 
design and code their iOS apps with Xcode and then directly submit their 
completed app through Xcode to Apple for review and approval.
The App Development and Distribution 
Process
Before you begin, get the right equipment. You will need one or more iMacs, 
Mac Pros, or MacBook computers on which to develop. Then, to build apps 
for Apple devices, follow the steps outlined here and illustrated in Figure 7-2.
1.	
Enroll in the Apple Developer Program.
2.	
Build a development team. Everyone on the team 
is given a relevant status, with proper IDs and 
appropriate certificates.
3.	
The development team designs and develops apps 
on Xcode, from storyboarding and wireframing to 
prototyping, using Xcode’s parallel visual design and 
code interface.
4.	
When the beta version of the app is ready, upload it 
onto iTunes Connect, then build a team of internal 
and/or external testers.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
128
5.	
Use your testers’ feedback to debug the app and 
improve the design.
6.	
When the app is ready for release, submit it to Apple 
for review.
7.	
When the app has passed review and is approved for 
release, publish the app on iTunes Connect.
In this chapter and Chapter 8, we will look at the first three steps. In Chapter 9, 
we will look at the testing phase; in Chapter 10, at the submission process; 
and in Chapter 11, at the distribution process. The complete process is 
shown in Figure 7-2.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
130
Enroll in the Apple Developer Program
You can develop and distribute apps on the Apple system only after you 
register on the Apple Developer Program. Registering as a developer 
requires the following steps:
1.	
Create an Apple ID on the Apple website (https://
developer.apple.com/). Make sure to verify your 
e-mail.
2.	
Agree to the Apple Developer Agreement.
3.	
Enroll in the Apple Developer Program (press the 
Enroll button at the top right corner of the “How 
the Program Works” page of the Apple Developer 
Program.
If you enroll as an individual, you will need to provide basic 
personal information like your legal name and address. If 
you are enrolling as an organization, you will need to provide 
a D-U-N-S number, which is a nine-digit number issued 
for free by Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) and required for all 
commercial entities that need to register with the U.S. Federal 
Government in order to sign contracts with Apple. You also 
need to provide information about your organization’s legal 
entity status, as well as proof that you are authorized by your 
organization to register with Apple on its behalf.
Enrolling in the Apple Developer Program costs $99.00 per 
year.
Once you are enrolled in the Apple Developer Program, you
a)	 have access to app services depending on platform and 
membership level;
b)	 have access to tools like your developer account and iTunes 
Connect, through which you can manage your teams and 
your apps; and
c)	 Have the right to distribute apps through the App Store, the 
Mac App Store, and the Apple TV Store.
4.	
Download and install Xcode.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
131
Adding Your Apple ID to Xcode
As you may remember from the previous chapter, Xcode is a complete 
software package for designing, building, testing, and publishing apps on 
the Apple system. If you have wireframed your app design using a different 
software tool, your design will have to be transferred to Xcode. One great 
feature of Xcode is that you can start your project from scratch with Xcode, 
do your layouts, wireframes, and storyboards directly within it, and translate 
them into code as you assemble your app.
To download Xcode, press the Download button at the top-right corner of 
the Xcode page on the Apple Developer website (https://developer.apple.
com/xcode/). The latest version as of April 2017 is Xcode 8.3.2.
Follow the instructions. Once you have Xcode running, add your Apple ID to 
it so that you can start building apps as a registered Apple developer. You 
can add your ID to Xcode by pressing the + button at the bottom right of 
the Accounts interface in Xcode, choosing “Add Apple ID,” and signing in to 
iCloud with your Apple ID. Follow the steps in Figure 7-3 to add your Apple 
ID to Xcode.
Figure 7-3.  Adding your Apple ID to Xcode
Build an App Development Team
As a developer, you may be part of more than one team, either as a leader or 
a member, with different roles and levels of access. You can view your teams 
under your Apple ID information.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
132
As the creator of a team, you are known as the team agent. You can invite 
new members to your team and assign different roles to them. You can also 
make one member the team admin, a role that shares the same privileges 
as the team agent except the right to sign legal documents.
Each of your team members, including yourself, has an Apple ID, the 
certificates issued to them by Apple depending on their role and privileges, 
their signing identity, which they use to sign apps, and their iTunes Connect 
account, if they are given one by the team agent. Certificates allow Apple to 
know who signed an app that was submitted for review or released, and the 
best way to get the certificates is to request one directly through Xcode.
Identifiers
With any app that you build, each team member will have an individual ID 
and certificates that allow them to sign the code for an app and develop, 
submit, and distribute apps depending on their level of access. Every device 
connected to Xcode for app testing will also have a separate ID.
Signing identities are unique IDs that are used by developers to code-sign 
apps, which is a security-related step that certifies who created the code 
for an app and confirms that the code has not been modified since the 
developer code-signed it.
Apple describes provisioning as “the process of preparing and configuring 
an app to launch on devices and to use app services." This involves 
choosing the devices on which your app will run and the services it will use. 
You will download a development provisioning profile for the app from 
your account and embed it in the app bundle.
A team provisioning profile in the Apple system “allows all your apps to be 
signed and run by all team members on all your team’s devices.” To create 
a team provisioning profile, you need to connect the devices that you want 
to use for testing the app and then choose the members of your team. After 
the team provisioning profile is created, you need to export all your signing 
identities and provisioning profiles to a single file that can be moved if you 
want to continue developing on another computer.
Design and Develop Apps
Now you can start building your app by choosing File ➤ New ➤ Project, 
or by clicking on “Create a new Xcode project” in the Welcome to Xcode 
window. When you do, you will be asked to choose what type of app 
you want to create. There are a number of templates available for you to 
choose from: a Master-Detail Application, a Game Application, a Page-
Based Application, a Single View Application, a Tabbed Application, a Utility 
Application, or an Empty Application.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
133
These templates have pre-designed features to help you set up and 
structure your app quickly, and you or your developer will choose the 
appropriate template for your app.
After choosing the template, you will be asked to fill in some basic 
information, which we looked at earlier. You will also be asked whether you 
want to use storyboards (you should), whether you want to use automatic 
reference counting (you should), and whether you want to include unit tests 
(also recommended).
Apple then creates the needed signing identities and provisioning profiles 
for the app. Xcode also creates an App ID for your app, which can be 
explicit for a single app or a wildcard for multiple apps.
You will also be asked to identify yourself or your organization, the 
programming language you want to use to build the app, and the devices 
for which the app is intended. You will then choose where you want to save 
your project. You can then create a team and develop apps.
The Xcode IDE
When building an app, a developer needs access to three things: the 
code, the overall layout of the app that shows the screen layout and the 
connections between screens, and the final result on a set device. The 
Xcode IDE combines these views into one main interface: the code editor, 
the interface builder, and the simulator.
The Code Editor
As its name suggests, the Code Editor window in Xcode is where developers 
write and edit the code for iOS apps. What is present in the coding pane 
is reflected in the associated screen in the Interface Builder, and any 
modification of, addition to, or removal from the code is immediately 
reflected on the associated screen.
The Interface Builder
The Interface Builder allows developers to design the screens for an app 
using visual resources without writing the code. Xcode automatically 
translates any layout into its corresponding code in Swift, which can be 
edited in the coding pane, also known as the Assistant Editor.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
134
The iOS Simulator
At any point in the development process, Xcode allows developers to see 
how an app will look and work on actual devices using an iOS simulator. The 
simulator can be activated by pressing the Play button at the top-left corner 
of the Xcode interface.
Frameworks
Frameworks are shared resources that developers can access through 
Xcode so that different teams working on different products don’t have to 
reinvent the wheel every time and can save a great deal of time by accessing 
resources and solutions for basic tasks and functions. Frameworks are used 
to code apps to perform tasks like displaying user interfaces, playing media, 
saving passwords, and other standard functions that are common to the 
vast majority of apps.
Storyboards
A storyboard in Xcode displays all the screens of an app together in 
different ways. Xcode has storyboard controllers for Table View Controller, 
Collection View Controller, Navigation Controller, Tab Bar Controller, Page 
View Controller, and GLKit View Controller. These storyboards organize the 
screens of an app in different ways, depending on how they want to view 
the screens and the connections and transitions between them (Figure 7-4). 
Developers also have the option to build their own storyboards.

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
135
Figure 7-4.  A sample app storyboard

CHAPTER 7: Building Your App
136
Prototyping
Using Xcode, the development team builds an app prototype, which is 
an interactive representation of the complete app that can be viewed and 
tested on the devices for which it’s intended. This prototype is essentially 
the beta version of the app that will next be debugged and tested.
Summary
Apple has created a complete system that has its own interconnected 
hardware, software, and distribution platform for app development and 
distribution. This allows the company to have complete control over the 
quality of the apps published on the Apple App Store.
In the next chapter, we will look at how apps are configured for distribution.

Chapter 8
Configuring Your App
Configuring an app for distribution involves defining important settings 
related to the frameworks and services your app will use and the capabilities 
it will have as a result, as well as submitting key identity information about 
your app to iTunes Connect through Xcode.
In this chapter, we will look in detail at app frameworks, which are shared 
resources common to most apps; app services, which allow an app to 
perform specific functions using those resources; and capabilities, which 
define what an app can do for its users by combining its frameworks and 
services.

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
138
Configuring a Project
Before choosing the frameworks and services that will support your app, 
the app’s identity and basic information need to be created in iTunes. The 
following sections lay out the sequence of steps required to create your 
app’s identity.
Create a Bundle ID
In the Identity section of the General category of your app project, you 
will enter a bundle identifier. A bundle identifier, or bundle ID, is a unique 
name for an app. It can contain alphanumeric characters (A–Z, a–z, 0–9), 
hyphens (-), and periods (.), and is written in reverse DNS order (e.g., “com.
Company.ProductName”). A bundle ID is used at different times during the 
development process in Xcode, as well as during distribution by iTunes 
Connect, iCloud, and Apple services, to identify the app when necessary. You 
will also be asked to submit the version number of the app and the build.
Identify Your Team
After you identify the team responsible for developing the app, Xcode will 
create a team provisioning profile to allow all team members to code-sign and 
run the app. It will also create either an explicit app ID matching the bundle 
ID or a wildcard app ID for multiple apps, and will then enable app services. 
Here, you can also enter the version and build numbers of the app.
Input Product Information
You will be asked to input product information, including the product name, 
the organization name, the organization identifier, the language of the app, 
and the devices for which it’s intended.
Input Deployment Info
In this section, the developer inputs the following information: the 
deployment target, which is the lowest version of iOS that the app 
will run on; the target devices for which the app is intended (iPhone, 
iPad, Universal); the desired device orientations (portrait, upside-down, 
landscape right, landscape left); and the style of the status bar (light, dark or 
translucent, and either fixed or hidden).

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
139
Submit Visuals
The visuals that must be uploaded as assets into the app bundle include 
the app icon and a launch-screen file, or splash screen. All visuals that are 
referenced by iOS are stored in the app build, and visuals that are used by 
iTunes or the Apple App Store are stored in iTunes Connect. Xcode will store 
groups of images, such as the app icon in various sizes or resolutions, in an 
asset catalog.
Set Architecture, Base SDK, and Debug Information
In this section, the developer defines the iOS device architectures for which the 
app is intended, including armv7 and arm64. The Base SDK setting is the base 
software level for the app, which is recommended to be the highest possible—
namely, the “Latest iOS” setting—so that Xcode can implement debugging 
on the device on which the app is being debugged. Finally, the appropriate 
settings that will allow the symbolication (the backtracing of an event to the 
source code) of crash reporting are chosen.
App Record
The app record contains all the information about an app that must be 
submitted to Apple before the app can be uploaded onto iTunes Connect for 
distribution. An app record contains the information that will be published 
on the app’s App Store page and the information that is necessary for 
managing the app while it is in distribution.
Only a team agent or a team member with Admin, Technical, or App 
Manager status are authorized to upload apps into iTunes Connect.
App Information
When you create a new app under the My Apps section in iTunes Connect, 
you will be asked to fill in the relevant fields with identity information that 
was created in Xcode, like the bundle ID, the app name, and the default 
language. This information is displayed in the App Information window of the 
App Store section.
Configurable fields also include restrictions on user access, settings for 
storing data in iCloud Display Sets, localization information, like additional 
supported languages, and Pricing and Availability settings, which identify the 
territories in which the app will be made available and whether the app will 
be sold with no discount or at a volume discount, or be released privately.

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
140
App Frameworks
As we saw in the previous chapter, frameworks are shared resources that 
developers can access through Xcode to save time and effort when coding. 
These frameworks implement standard functions that are common to the 
vast majority of apps. Each framework can be added to an app to allow that 
app’s users to benefit from the framework’s capabilities. Adding frameworks 
to an app is done in the coding phase via code. The following sections 
discuss the app frameworks relevant to iOS devices.
3D Touch
3D Touch allows an app to react to a user’s behavior beyond just 
recognizing when the user presses the display; it implements different 
actions depending on how strongly the user is pressing the display. This 
3D Touch responsiveness allows users to complete tasks faster, preview 
content before accessing it, and generally do more with their apps.
App Extensions
As its name suggests, App Extensions allows an app to extend its functions 
and content throughout the operating system of the device that hosts it 
instead of simply being an icon-activated separate entity. App extensions, 
for example, can enable an app to share content on social networks, apply 
effects to photos from a device’s camera, post updates, and provide custom 
keyboards.
Bonjour
Bonjour is a framework that enables apps to automatically find and connect 
to devices and services on local networks without any configuration 
requirements.
CarPlay
CarPlay connects the user’s devices to a vehicle’s own built-in display, thus 
making an iPhone’s functions, such as playing music, using maps, using 
messaging, and making calls, available inside the vehicle.

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
141
Handoff
Handoff is a framework that enables continuity for a function or activity across 
different devices, allowing a user to begin an activity on an iOS device, for 
example, and continue it on a macOS device like a Macbook. It allows users 
who own multiple devices to use them together to carry out an activity.
Notifications
The Notifications framework enables the delivery of local and push 
notifications to users on iOS devices. Local notifications alert a user to a 
change related to an app while that app is in the background, and sometimes 
they solicit a response. Local notifications include alert dialogs, badges, 
banner messages, and lock screens. They can also be interactive, presenting 
the user with a number of options for actions related to the app that can be 
implemented without fully activating the app. Local notifications are scheduled 
by the app itself and target the specific user who has downloaded that app. 
For example, a calendar reminder that pops up on a user's screen is an 
example of a local notification.
Push notifications or remote notifications, on the other hand, are not 
scheduled by apps, but are sent by a server to many user devices. Push 
notifications are created by app publishers to communicate with all or some 
of the users of their app at the same time. A publisher who wants to use 
push notifications needs to register for the Apple Push Notifications (APN) 
service and generate a related certificate.
App Services
Apple provides app developers with a number of services, which are built 
around frameworks, to enhance their app’s capabilities and enable functions 
that individual apps cannot fully implement on their own, such as payments.
An app’s services and capabilities are enabled and configured in the 
Capabilities window of the project editor in Xcode.
Apple Pay
Apple Pay enables app users to make easy and safe payments and 
donations from inside the apps they use.

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
142
CallKit
CallKit enables apps to make and receive telephone calls using a phone’s 
native user interface.
CareKit, HealthKit, ResearchKit
CareKit is oriented toward health-related apps and enables apps that use it 
to gather information about a user’s health. It then allows that user to access 
that information and share it with their doctors. Apps that use HealthKit are 
also able to monitor a user’s health and activity metrics and generate health-
related information as part of the app’s functions. ResearchKit is designed 
to give data-gathering capabilities to apps designed for medical research; it 
works with HealthKit to support sophisticated health-related apps.
HomeKit
HomeKit enables apps to connect with and control devices in a user’s home, 
including lights, doors, windows, blinds, cameras, and doorbells.
iBeacon
iBeacon is designed to support apps that use location-based information. 
These apps connect to devices, or beacons, with iBeacon technology enabled 
in order to communicate location-related information to the app’s users.
iCloud and CloudKit
CloudKit enables apps to access Apple’s cloud-based data-storage service, 
iCloud, and includes authentication, a public database, a private database, 
and asset storage services.
iMessage
iMessage enables apps to reach users while they are chatting and interact 
with them without forcing them to end their conversations. iMessage apps 
allow users to do things like make payments and share content without 
having to exit Messages.

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
143
MapKit
The MapKit framework enables apps to display interactive maps and 
location information.
SiriKit
SiriKit enables apps to work with Siri, Apple’s voice-activated virtual 
assistant.
StoreKit
StoreKit enables apps to offer in-app purchases of all kinds to app users, 
including content, products, virtual goods, and subscriptions.
Wallet and PassKit
Wallet and PassKit allow app users to manage and use rewards cards, 
tickets, boarding passes, and gift cards.
Capabilities
The combination of frameworks and services used by your app defines its 
capabilities, or what your app can do. As a security measure, Apple allows 
developers to specify and enable only those services and capabilities that 
an app needs so as to minimize the likelihood of unauthorized malicious 
access to and manipulation of apps and their data.
Once developers choose the frameworks and services they want to use, 
Xcode uses the code-signing and provisioning assets of the development 
team to grant entitlements to the relevant app based on the app ID. The 
capabilities associated with each app are switched off by default and can be 
switched on if they are to be used by your app. The supported capabilities 
for iOS are App Groups, Apple Pay, Associated Domains, Background 
Modes, Data Protection, Game Center, HealthKit, HomeKit, CloudKit, iCloud 
Documents, iCloud: Key-Value Storage, In-App Purchase, Interapp Audio, 
Keychain Sharing, Personal VPN, Push Notifications, Wallet, and Wireless 
Accessory Configuration. Let’s look at each of these a bit more closely.
App Groups allows apps that are grouped together to share data. Apple Pay 
was looked at earlier. Associated Domains allows the app to connect to a 
website (mainly used for deep linking). Enabling Background Modes allows 
the app to perform very specific tasks in the background if you specify those 
tasks, including playing media, updating the app’s location, handling VoIP 

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
144
calls, downloading content from Newsstand, keeping content up to date 
with Background Fetch, and communicating with external accessories. Data 
Protection enables the app to encrypt the data it stores as an extra layer of 
protection against unauthorized access. Game Center is the social gaming 
network created by Apple to help players track scores, invite others to join, 
and play multi-player games.
HealthKit, HomeKit, and CloudKit were looked at earlier. iCloud Documents 
and iCloud: Key-Value Storage are part of the iCloud entitlements and allow 
your app to store documents and key values in the cloud. As its name 
suggests, enabling In-App Purchases allows the publisher to sell features, 
digital content, and products from inside the app. Interapp Audio allows 
audio produced by one app to be used by other apps. Keychain Sharing 
allows an app to share passwords, credit card numbers, and other bits of 
information with other apps. Personal VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows 
an app to provide a VPN service on the device on which it’s installed. Push 
Notifications allows apps to send push notifications containing information 
about updates or new content to the owner of the device. Wallet was 
looked at earlier. Finally, Wireless Accessory Configuration allows an app to 
communicate with accessories.
Additional Configurations
If your app is using Apple services, additional configurations may be 
required, such as for In-App Purchases, which need to be created; defined 
in terms of type, characteristics, visuals, price, and availability; and 
submitted to Apple for review before they can be made available to your 
app’s users. This is likely to be an ongoing process throughout your app’s 
lifecycle and is tied to your marketing, growth, and retention strategies.
Game Center is another service that may require additional configuration 
information. If your app is a game, you will need to connect it to the Game 
Center so that your players can submit scores, see the leaderboards, and 
exchange game information.
App Thinning, App Slicing, and On-Demand 
Resources
Depending on the device they are using, customers who download your 
app may not be able to use all of your app’s features and capabilities. The 
App Store and iOS download only those features that the device doing the 
downloading can use, thus reducing the app’s footprint and optimizing the 
user experience. This is known as app thinning.

CHAPTER 8: Configuring Your App
145
The App Store will also create variants of your app depending on the device 
groups your app supports. For example, it will use the target devices you 
identified in Xcode and the asset catalog you built to create a variant for 
iPads using images with the appropriate sizes and resolutions for iPads, 
leaving out resources intended for iPhones. This is known as app slicing.
Finally, to further optimize the user experience through small app sizes and 
fast downloads, apps can be designed to download resources only when 
they anticipate the user will access them, such as additional levels for a 
game or other types of content that do not need to be available until the 
user requests it. This is known as on-demand resources.
Summary
Configuring your app is about capabilities and efficiency—defining what 
your app will be able to do, making sure it functions as efficiently as 
possible, and ensuring access to the services it will need and excluding 
those it will not. A well-configured app is a sure sign of a professional 
approach to app development.

Chapter 9
Testing Your App
As part of its complete app development and distribution system, Apple 
allows publishers to te	  before submitting them for review. Although testing 
is not a requirement for submission, it’s always a good idea to test an app 
thoroughly before submission or release.
Why is it wise to thoroughly test an app? No matter how good the 
development team is, there’s always a possibility that there will be one or 
more design or programming flaws somewhere in the app. It’s essential 
that finding those flaws and fixing or removing them is done before Apple 
reviews the app or your users get their hands on it.

CHAPTER 9: Testing Your App
148
After you submit an app for review, it will be thoroughly checked out by 
Apple anyway, and if flaws are discovered, the app will be rejected. You will 
have to go back and fix the flaws before resubmitting the app, with all the 
disappointment and loss of precious time and resources this would entail.
If your app passes review but flaws remain (which is unlikely, especially 
for major flaws), they will inevitably be discovered by frustrated and angry 
users, who will then punish you with bad reviews and bad publicity. After 
having put so much effort into creating a positive and engaging user 
experience in your app, why would you risk destroying everything by 
ignoring the opportunity to perfect your app before you release it?
In short, testing is too important to ignore. Testing an app on TestFlight 
involves the following stages:
1.	
Upload a test build onto iTunes Connect.
2.	
Create iTunes Record for beta testing.
3.	
Submit the app for beta review.
4.	
Create a testing team, invite testers.
5.	
Testers use test app and offer feedback.
6.	
Gather the feedback to fix and improve your app.
7.	
Develop final build for release.
8.	
Submit final build for review before release.  
Uploading the Test Build
The first step in the testing phase is to upload a beta version, or test build, 
of the app onto iTunes Connect. This can be done directly from Xcode or 
through the Application Loader tool, which can be accessed via the Open 
Developer Tool button inside Xcode.
Uploading an app build through the Application Loader tool is relevant if 
your app contains in-app purchases, as it allows the developer to create and 
configure in detail all the app’s available in-app purchases, including their 
display names, descriptions, prices, and start and end dates between which 
they will be available.
Once the test build is uploaded, it can be seen in the Activity section of the 
developer’s iTunes Connect account.

CHAPTER 9: Testing Your App
149
Creating an iTunes Record for Beta Testing
Like all apps, this app will require an iTunes Record, but the metadata 
required for app builds intended for beta testing is much less than that 
needed for final builds, and the process is therefore simpler and quicker. 
However, if external testers are involved in the testing process, the iTunes 
Record will have to include the following: information about what to test, the 
description of the app, an e-mail address for feedback, URLs for marketing, 
support, and the app’s privacy policy, and the developer’s contact 
information.
Submitting an App for Beta App Review
If an app is to be made available for testing by external testers, the beta 
version will have to undergo a Beta App Review. To pass that review, it 
will have to comply with the App Store Review Guidelines, just like a final 
version. So, even as a beta version, an app must be in very good shape in 
terms of design and programming before it enters the testing phase.
Creating a Testing Team
The next step is to invite internal and external testers to test the beta 
version.
To invite an internal tester to your testing team, just insert their e-mail 
address in TestFlight. For external testers, an e-mail and a full name suffice. 
These testers then receive an e-mail inviting them to join the testing team 
and download TestFlight, the iOS app they will use to test your app and 
submit their responses. Up to 2,000 external testers can be invited to create 
a testing team, and, unlike internal testers, they don’t need to have an Apple 
ID to participate.
TestFlight Beta Testing
iOS apps are tested using Apple’s TestFlight beta-testing utility. TestFlight 
allows app publishers to test up to 100 iOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps at 
the same time among up to 25 internal and up to 10,000 testers. Internal 
and external testers are allowed to test up to 100 apps at any time, for over 
90 days per test app.

CHAPTER 9: Testing Your App
150
Internal testers can join a testing team if they have Developer or Admin 
status, and each can test up to 30 apps at any one time, while external 
testers who are not part of the development team can be invited to join the 
testing process through just an e-mail invitation.
Using the TestFlight App to Test a Beta App
Before testing a beta version of an app, each member of the testing team, 
internal or external, must download the free TestFlight app for iOS from the 
App Store for each of the devices on which they want to test the beta app. 
When a tester receives and accepts an invitation to test an app, they can 
download the beta version onto their devices.
The TestFlight app allows testers to work on a number of apps at the same 
time. For each app, TestFlight displays the app description and the “What to 
Test” guidance provided by the publisher.
Testers are expected to provide feedback to the developer about their 
user experience and any flaws they may have discovered. This is done 
by pressing the Provide Feedback button on the App Details view, which 
opens an e-mail window for that purpose. Testers can also use the App 
Details view in TestFlight to unsubscribe as a tester and opt out from a 
testing group.
Using Feedback to Develop the Final Build
Feedback from your team of testers will be used to identify the flaws and 
bugs in your app and to inform the design and coding of the app’s final 
build.
Feedback from testers is sent in e-mail form to the address specified in the 
Feedback E-mail field of the relevant test information.
Developers use feedback from testers to improve the app, fix bugs and 
flaws, and upload new builds. They invite testers to test these new versions 
until the final build is ready to be submitted for review.

CHAPTER 9: Testing Your App
151
Summary
Testing is an important phase in the development process that should 
be given the attention it deserves. Bugs, errors, and crashes will have a 
disastrous effect on app adoption and user retention after release, so the 
testing phase is the time to eliminate them.
The final step, of course, is to submit the final build of the app for review. 
We’ll look at the submission process in the next chapter.

Chapter 10
Submitting Your App
Once your app is ready for release, it needs to be approved by Apple before 
it can hit the App Store, and to get Apple’s approval, it needs to pass an 
app review. Before you submit, it pays to know that Apple is very strict 
about approving apps for release; the review process takes at least two 
weeks. Apple will go through your app thoroughly and can reject an app for 
a number of reasons. A rejection is a very painful and costly experience in 
terms of both money and the time wasted trying to find the flaw that sunk 
your release—not to mention the impact on your team’s morale. In short, an 
app should work perfectly and meet all of Apple’s requirements when you 
submit it, so test it thoroughly and make sure it does before you click the 
Submit for Review button.

CHAPTER 10: Submitting Your App
154
Avoiding App Rejection
The most common reasons for app rejection, according to Apple, are the 
following:
 Crashes. Your app keeps crashing and has bugs (no 
surprise there). If your app has a tendency to crash, it 
will never be made available to users. An app needs 
to be tested and tested until all bugs are fixed before 
submission.
 Dead Links. You have links that lead nowhere. Ensure 
continuity for all links inside the app, and make sure 
there are links to user support with accurate contact 
information, as well as ones leading to your app’s 
privacy policy and all disclaimers.
 Placeholders. If your app has placeholder text or 
images in it, it is not final. Make sure all your app 
content is finalized and available.
 Bad Info. Information is incomplete, misleading, or 
inaccurate. This includes all the information Apple will 
need to thoroughly review your app, like your contact 
information, special access usernames and passwords 
(such as for a demo account that illustrates a sign-in 
process), and settings required for a feature to work 
properly.
 Misleading Description. The description of your app 
and all the visuals associated with it need to accurately 
convey the functions and features of the app; otherwise, 
they will be seen to be misleading and will cause your 
app to be rejected.
 Design Issues. Apple provides design standards and 
guidelines to developers and designers to make sure 
all apps on the App Store have consistently good user 
interface designs. You must follow these guidelines to 
be approved.
 Unformatted Web Content. When an app accesses 
web content that is not formatted for iOS, this 
undermines the quality of the user experience.
 Similar Apps. Apps that are very similar to each other 
and could easily be combined into a single app are likely 
to be rejected.

CHAPTER 10: Submitting Your App
155
 Lack of Ad Functionality. Your app will need an 
Advertising Identifier (IDFA) to display ads. If you submit 
an IDFA, but your app lacks the proper functionality to 
display ads as it should, it will be rejected.
 Lack of Lasting Value. Apple will reject an app that 
does not offer much use value for its users compared to 
similar apps in its category.
App Submission Checklist
Before you submit your app for review, go through the following checklist 
and make sure you answer all the questions in the affirmative.
 Testing. Has the app been tested thoroughly enough to 
eliminate all crashes and bugs?
 Accuracy. Is all information in the app up-to-date and 
accurate, including your contact information?
 Backend Server. Are backend services ready and 
available for access during the review process?
 Support Information. Does the submission include all 
support information for available features?
 Conformity. Does the app abide by all of Apple’s design 
and technical guidelines?
 Configurations. Have you set up all the configurations 
the app needs?
 App Size. Does the size of the app fall within Apple’s 
set limits?
 App Record. Have you verified all app properties for the 
Game Center (if your app is a game) and iCloud Display 
sets (which allow multiple apps to access the same data 
files) and completed the app record, with categories, 
keywords, the bundle ID, and the App Store version 
number filled in? These properties cannot be changed 
after the app is submitted for review.
 App Sandbox. Have you configured your app for App 
Sandbox? App Sandbox provides access control for 
app security purposes. It restricts an app’s access to 
only the data and system resources and services that it 
needs in order to function properly. It does not provide 
foolproof security, but it does limit damage significantly 
in case of compromise. See Figure 10-1.

CHAPTER 10: Submitting Your App
156
 Services. Have you configured the services your app 
will use? Make sure all the services your app will use 
from the list of Apple App Services are configured and 
are functioning properly: Apple Pay, CallKit, CareKit, 
CloudKit JS, HealthKit, HomeKit, iBeacon, iCloud 
and CloudKit, iMessage, In-App Purchase, Maps and 
Location, ResearchKit, SiriKit, Wallet, and PassKit.
Submit Now!
When you are ready to submit your app, go through the following process:
1.	
Specify the App’s Build. An app can have any 
number of builds uploaded onto the App Store, but 
only one can be associated with the app at any time, 
and that will be the build you will submit for review. 
So, you have to upload the build and choose it from 
among the available builds for your app. This is 
known as the current build.
2.	
Meet Export Compliance Regulations and Specify 
Encryption Features. Your app will be hosted on 
Apple servers located in the United States, which 
means it will be subject to U.S. export legislation. 
iTunes Connect asks app publishers questions 
regarding the level of encryption your app will 
require, and where relevant it asks publishers to 
submit related documents.
Figure 10-1.  The App Sandbox

CHAPTER 10: Submitting Your App
157
If you are not using encryption, you can submit export 
compliance and encryption-related information while 
developing your app so that you won’t have to go through 
this process at submission time. You can submit the related 
documentation through Xcode, have it approved, and 
receive a key that you can submit with your build.
3.	
Confirm Permission to Use Third-Party Content. 
If your app will be hosting content from third parties, 
you will have to confirm that you have the right to 
use that content wherever the app will available for 
download.
4.	
Confirm Use of Advertising Identifier. An 
Advertising Identifier is a unique ID created for each 
iOS device and is used for two purposes: displaying 
advertisements inside your app and for the attribution 
of installation and actions inside the app to that device.
5.	
Specify Timing of Release. If for any reason 
as a publisher you don’t want to release an app 
automatically as soon as it’s approved and prefer to 
wait for a specific time, you can specify a “no earlier 
than” date for release after approval. You can also 
opt to manually release the app whenever it suits you 
(for example, at a specific moment coordinated with 
your marketing campaign).
6.	
Click Submit for Review (under App Store on the App 
Details page of your app, at the top right of the page). 
The app status will change to “Waiting for Review.”
7.	
Follow the Status of Your Review. The status 
of your app version is grouped into three broad 
categories, defined by the color of the associated 
status indicator: red, yellow, or green.
A red status indicator means either the app has been 
rejected for a specific reason or the publisher needs to 
change something before the app can be approved for 
the App Store. The following statuses are indicated in 
red: Rejected (app has been rejected for failing to meet 
acceptance criteria, Metadata Rejected, Removed from 
Sale, Invalid Binary, Developer Rejected (developer 
removed build from review), Developer Removed from Sale 
(developer removed app from review).

CHAPTER 10: Submitting Your App
158
A yellow status indicator means the app is in the middle of 
an ongoing process that is being implemented by Apple 
or the app publisher. The following statuses are indicated 
in yellow: Prepare for Submission, Waiting for Review, In 
Review, Pending Contract, Waiting for Export Compliance, 
Pending Developer Release, Processing for the App Store, 
and Pending Apple Release.
A green status indicator means your app has been fully 
approved and is available for distribution.
8.	
Wait. If your app is rejected, you as the publisher 
will be notified of the reason for the rejection. Apple 
has a Resolution Center you can contact for more 
information and additional guidance.
In the next chapter, we will look at how to monitor your app’s progress and 
gather data about how users are interacting with your app.
Summary
App submission requires diligence and patience. Get everything right 
before you submit, and passing app reviews will be a breeze. Then, you can 
focus on post-publishing activities like monitoring your app’s progress and 
gathering data about how users are interacting with your app, which we will 
look at in the next chapter.

Chapter 11
Distributing Your App
App Distribution Methods
App distribution is the process of making an app available for download. 
There are three distribution methods available to publishers of iOS apps: 
App Store, Enterprise, and Ad Hoc.

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
160
App Store
This method involves posting your app on the App Store and making 
it available to anyone for download onto their devices. This is the most 
popular method among the vast majority of app publishers. It is the 
appropriate method if you are developing for profit, like most publishers are. 
The App Store has a marketing and financial transaction system in place to 
facilitate the process of marketing and selling your apps.
Enterprise
As its name suggests, enterprise app distribution is the process whereby 
a company distributes apps internally to its employees. This method is 
popular with companies that want to use apps to improve workflow; for 
example, by creating a sales reporting app for a marketing team. There is no 
limit on the number of devices that can download an enterprise app.
This method of distribution costs $299 a year per enterprise, and requires 
a special distribution channel of its own, like a website. A subscriber to 
the Enteprise Program will have to provide proof of their legal right to sign 
binding agreements on behalf of their company.
Ad Hoc
Ad hoc distribution is used primarily in the development phase for testing 
purposes, as it makes the app available for a limited number of devices and 
only to users with a developer account. A single ad hoc distribution license 
is valid for 90 days and can be used for a maximum of 100 devices. Like the 
enterprise method, this method requires its own distribution channel.
Archiving and Uploading an App
The distribution process begins with the uploading of the app to iTunes 
Connect, where it goes into the app archive. Before users get to download 
and use it, however, the app needs to be validated; in other words, it needs 
to be checked to see whether it’s properly configured for distribution on the 
App Store. Let’s look at this process in more detail.
Creating an Archive
Before you upload an app to iTunes Connect, you need to create an archive 
where it will be stored and validated before being made available in the App 
Store. This is true irrespective of the distribution method you choose. To do 
this, the archive scheme settings must first be checked in the Product ➤ 

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
161
Scheme ➤ Edit Scheme pane in the project editor in Xcode. These settings 
vary depending on the nature of the app. Then, choose Product ➤ Archive 
to create an archive for your project.
Validating Your App on iTunes Connect
Validating a project on iTunes Connect involves making sure the app is 
properly configured for the App Store. Validation tests are implemented 
when an app is uploaded onto iTunes Connect, and afterward as well.
To validate an archive, choose it from the archives listed in the Archives 
organizer in Xcode and press the Validate button on the right-side pane.  
A pop-up window appears that displays the app’s binary, entitlements, and 
provisioning profile. Press the Validate button at the bottom right of the pop-up 
window. Xcode uploads the archive to iTunes Connect to run validation tests.
Uploading Your App to the App Store
When your archive has passed the validation tests, you can upload the 
archive by pressing the Upload to App Store button on the right-side pane in 
the Xcode window. In the pop-up window that appears, check the “Include 
app symbols for your application” option so that your app will be able to 
send you crash reports. If you want to be able to update your app in the App 
Store without having to submit new versions for review every time, check 
the “Include bitcode” option.
When you press the Upload button at the bottom right of the pop-up 
window, Xcode will upload the archive onto iTunes Connect and run 
validation tests again.
Your App’s Product Page
Your app’s product page in the App Store is the first real contact point 
between the app and its users, and all your marketing channels will probably 
drive potential users to it. It’s therefore very important that the page is well 
designed so as to maximize your app’s discoverability in search, as well as 
its appeal to visitors.
This is where visitors get all the information they need in order to decide 
whether to download your app, and they will make that decision in a matter 
of seconds. It’s your job as a publisher to make sure that visitors are not put 
off by bad design, incorrect spelling, or other errors. You want them to hang 
on beyond those first few seconds and decide to give your app a try.

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
162
Your app’s product page in the App Store will display all the key visual and 
textual information that will interest visitors. It’s your first thorough marketing 
“pitch,” one aimed at convincing visitors to download the app. On the App 
Store page, visitors will see your app’s name, icon, price, age rating, review 
rating, preview video and poster frame (the still from the video that appears 
in search results), screenshots, description, and information about what’s 
new, as well as the name of the publishing company or individual, the app 
category, the date of the last update, the app version, and the app size.
When creating your App Store page, you will also be asked to submit 
keywords, which are words relevant to your app that help make it 
discoverable and determine its ranking in App Store searches. Apple 
imposes a 100-character limit on keywords and reviews them to make sure 
they do not violate regulations.
More information on keywords can be found in Chapter 12, “Marketing Your 
App.” 
Managing Your App and Team
As an app publisher, you will be managing your app and all financial activity 
attached to it through iTunes Connect. As we have already seen, via iTunes 
Connect you can validate archives, upload apps and distribute them for 
testing, market and distribute apps on the App Store, create development 
teams, and assign roles to each member.
After your app has been released, you will be using iTunes Connect to replace 
your app with new versions, change your app’s App Store metadata based 
on your marketing strategy, create and sell in-app purchases, and conduct 
business activity, like signing business contracts, conducting financial 
transactions, and generating financial information. You will also be managing 
your team, inviting members, assigning roles to them, and signing contracts.
As your app evolves into a business, the developers will be involved mostly 
with Xcode, and only the people who are involved in the business aspects 
of the app will need to access iTunes Connect. Therefore, it’s very important 
to control who in your team has access to what on iTunes Connect. For 
example, if you have a marketing manager, it’s logical that he or she is able 
to modify the app metadata or access analytics or financial reports.
By assigning privileges and roles to different teams and members, the team 
agent controls different levels of access to iTunes Connect. Some team 
members have very specific titles and related privileges. For example, a 
member with the Admin role is given all privileges except the right to sign 
contracts. An App Manager is given the privileges associated with just that: 
managing apps, including creating and updating apps and managing the 
testing process. A team member who has the Developer role assigned is 

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
163
given privileges related to the technical aspects of app development, like 
handling app builds and testers.
Managing Your Account
Apple requires all apps to be code-signed, which confirms that all code 
submitted to Apple was created by a registered developer and does not 
contain anything malicious. Apple requires that all people and devices using 
its system, as well as any code created on it, have a unique signature in the 
form of either an ID or an attached certificate or signature. This requirement 
has two purposes: security and quality.
When creating apps on the Apple system, you will have to create signing 
identities, certificates, keychains, identifiers, and profiles either during 
registration or during the development process. You will also have to attach 
the devices that will be used for testing by adding the Device IDs of test 
devices to your account.
Signing Identities
A developer who creates code on the Apple system attaches his signing identity 
to that code, or code-signs the app, certifying that he or she was the last 
person to edit that code and that the code has not been modified since then.
A signing identity is a combination of a public key and a private key that 
is stored on a team member’s keychain through the Keychain Services 
API. Authorized team members code-sign an app using both their signing 
identity, which is created in Xcode, and an intermediate certificate, which is 
stored in their account.
Certificates
Certificates qualify team members and define their status within the team. A 
team includes an agent as well as members who have Admin, Developer, or 
Member status.
A team member who has Developer status is issued a development 
certificate by a team member with Agent or Admin status, which allows that 
developer to deploy to devices any apps they have code-signed. A team 
member with a distribution certificate has the right to submit apps to the 
App Store. Distribution certificates are also created by team members who 
have Agent or Admin status.
An intermediate certificate in a team member’s keychain confirms that a 
certificate issued to that member was issued by a certificate authority.

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
164
Keychain
A keychain is the collection of keys and identities that belong to a member 
of an app development team. These keys define the team member’s status, 
their privileges, and the levels of access they have to different aspects of an 
app project.
Identifiers
Identifiers are unique number–letter–symbol combinations that, besides 
identifying you and all your team members, also uniquely identify the apps 
you create and the devices you use for testing on the Apple system. For 
example, every app you develop has an app ID attached to it. If that app 
ID is explicit, it will perfectly match the name of the app bundle. If it is a 
wildcard ID, it will identify one or more apps.
After creating an app ID, the developer is asked to choose which services 
should be enabled for that app. The available services include App Groups, 
Associated Domains, Data Protection, Game Center, HealthKit, HomeKit, 
Wireless Accessory Configuration, Apple Pay, iCloud, In-App Purchases, 
Inter-App Audio, Wallet, Push Notifications, and VPN Configuration & 
Control. These services can be viewed in detail in Chapter 8, “Configure 
Your App.”
Provisioning Profiles
Provisioning profiles are normally created by the developer to identify the 
members of a team and the devices that are attached to a specific app 
project or phase in an app’s lifecycle. They are of two types: development 
provisioning profiles and distribution provisioning profiles. Distribution 
includes ad hoc provisioning profiles and store provisioning profiles.
Development provisioning profiles group team members and devices during 
the development phase. For the distribution phase, ad hoc provisioning 
profiles are created by Xcode upon request when an app bundle is uploaded 
for testing, while store provisioning profiles identify the authorized team 
members when an app is uploaded to the App Store.
Devices
App publishers can attach devices to their account, primarily for testing 
purposes. Each device that is registered to an account for testing or 
other purposes has a unique ID attached to it, known as a Unique Device 
Identifier, or UDID.

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
165
App Performance and Analytics
After your app is released on the App Store, you will focus your efforts 
on managing and optimizing the app’s performance, both technically and 
financially.
Crash Reports
The first concern for an app publisher is making sure the app doesn’t 
crash—and to fix the code if it does. To do that, you will need to know when, 
how, and why instances of your app are crashing and on what devices. For 
that, you will need crash reports.
Crash reports for iOS apps are created by Apple’s crash service, which 
generates crash logs that record all the necessary details about app crashes 
based on data that app users agree to share with Apple.
Crash reports will tell you the location in your app’s code where the crash 
occurred, as well as the number of devices on which it occurred over a 
specific period of time. Crash reports are very useful in helping you, as the 
publisher, identify bugs and problems in your app before release so you can 
fix them in time and release a reliable, bug-free app to the market.
The crash service will begin generating crash reports no earlier than three 
days after the release of the app in the App Store. To understand a crash, 
the developer will need to see the source code associated with it, which can 
be done by opening the crash log in the project. Clicking the Open in Project 
button will display in the debug navigator the source code and the specific 
line of code associated with the crash.
Analytics and Financial Reports
Apple will generate highly detailed analytics for your app regarding both 
usage and monetization once it’s in the App Store. App analytics are 
available on the iTunes Connect home page for team members who have 
Admin, Finance, or Sales status.
The app analytics interface on iTunes Connect provides detailed app usage 
and sales data and allows you to apply filters to that data based on your 
campaign goals.
In the Sales arena, you can view revenue data for app sales, in-app 
purchases, sales, and paying users. Regarding Usage, you can see how 
many instances of your app are installed on devices, how many sessions of 
your app users have launched, how many active devices your app has been 
installed on over time, including over the past month, and why and how often 
your app is crashing. This data can give you insight into app engagement.

CHAPTER 11: Distributing Your App
166
App analytics will also generate retention reports. These reports will tell you 
how the usage of your app is changing over time through detailed visuals.
Financial Reports
iTunes Connect also uses analytics data to generate different types of 
financial reports that you can download. These reports are grouped under 
two broad categories: Sales and Trends and Payments and Financial 
Reports. In each category, select the fiscal month and the regions for which 
you want the report, then click Create Reports. A download link will allow 
you to download the report you have requested.
Summary
Publishing an app to the market is a very exciting but also very sensitive 
moment in an app’s lifecycle, as the smallest misstep can derail the whole 
process. Diligence helps you avoid heartbreak, and, as this chapter shows, 
there’s much more to successfully publishing an app than just pressing 
a Publish button somewhere. The period immediately after publishing is 
important from a performance-monitoring point of view because you’re 
anxious to see how your app is being received and what problems, technical 
or otherwise, may be holding you back.

Chapter 12
Marketing Your App
This chapter is a big milestone on your app’s path to success. This is 
because in all the previous chapters of this book, apps were discussed 
as ideas, as products in development, or as products awaiting review 
and approval. As of right now, we will generally be treating apps as fully 
developed products available for download or purchase.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
168
As you will see, however, marketing actually begins before launch and is 
very much a part of the app design and planning phase. For the experts, 
an app’s concept is somewhat validated by taking into account how 
effectively it can be marketed to its audience. The pre-launch marketing 
phase to build interest is also key to an app’s successful launch, but, for the 
most part, marketing will naturally be a post-launch activity as you create 
momentum and build your audience. You will be constantly searching for 
new users, managing your existing users, and bringing back users who have 
abandoned your app by finding out who they are, what they want from your 
app, how and where to reach them, and what offer will most entice them.
Marketing Refresher
Once your app is published in the app stores, you have to support and 
promote it, drive its downloads, and generate revenue. As we saw at the 
beginning of this book, marketing is everything, and everything is about 
marketing. Let’s look at these two principles again.
Marketing Is Everything
In short, this means that marketing is the factor that will decide how 
successful your app is. Even a well-designed app built around a good idea 
will not go far without your help. Skillful marketing is key to helping your app 
shine in the app stores and to driving downloads.
Everything Is About Marketing
This essentially means that everything related to your app—from the design 
of the app icon, the App Store page, and your own marketing campaign; the 
speed at which your app loads; the level structure (for games); the content; 
the color coding; the sharing capabilities for social media; the services it 
uses; and the functions it performs—literally every single aspect of your app 
revolves around making sure your users love it and will help you market it, 
and in this you’ve got stiff competition indeed, as Figure 12-1 shows.
Figure 12-1.  App use stats

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
169
This is the basis of how you should treat marketing: it’s everything, and 
you will do it all the time and in every way you can. Now that you intend to 
promote your app every way you can, let us look at all the options that are 
available—all the marketing channels. The success of your app depends on 
two things: how good the app really is and how well you market it. Again, 
even a great app won’t go very far without marketing, but great marketing 
can’t do much to rescue a badly designed app.
Success in any business depends a lot on good marketing, and nowhere is 
this truer than in the app business (Figure 12-2). Apps are marketed through 
online and offline channels, and each channel is used either at a specific 
moment, like a press release or official launch; at specific intervals, like 
weekly newsletters mailed to a mailing list; or continuously throughout the 
lifetime of the app, like AdWords or Facebook ad campaigns.
Figure 12-2.  App engagement stats
Effective marketing is a fine art, and the effectiveness of your marketing 
campaign will be one of the two key factors determining the profitability and 
commercial success of your app (the other is revenue). App marketing is 
constantly evolving, with new principles, strategies, and methods appearing 
all the time, so keeping up is important. Fortunately, there are a number of 
great app development and marketing companies, like Marketo, Appsee, 
Buzinga, and Localytics, that constantly produce a wealth of free resources 
you can use to hone your marketing skills to professional levels. You can 
find links to these resources at the end of this book.
App Marketing: Key Principles
Now that your app is in the app store, you have to look at how to support it, 
nurture it, and promote it every way you can. Your app needs more attention 
now than it ever did.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
170
Marketing Begins Long Before Launch
If you think about marketing as something that begins the moment after you 
launch your app, think again. If your marketing strategy is not in place and 
fully operational by launch time, and even before it, you’ve lost valuable time 
and opportunity. A marketing campaign takes time to produce its intended 
results, so if you have to launch an app at zero momentum and wait for that 
momentum to build up, you’ve probably lost the game already.
Traction is something an app needs to already have at launch time, not 
build up after launch. It’s your responsibility as the publisher to make 
sure your app launches with a big bang, lots of media attention, a social 
media frenzy—everything that is part of your campaign—and gets tons of 
downloads from day one. How can you do that? By timing the start of your 
marketing campaign with specific moments in the design and development 
phase so that you already have an army of eager customers aching to try 
out your app and tell you what they think.
In the design and development phase of your app, you are likely to validate 
the app concept by building a microsite or social media page and using an 
advertising campaign to test user response and solicit feedback. This is an 
excellent way to start moving from validation to active marketing.
Social media is a great place to start your pre-launch marketing activities. 
Create a social media identity for your app. Tell people how the app is 
progressing, and allow people to share their views and offer feedback. 
Create short surveys asking people what features they would like to see 
on an app like yours. Ask those who are interested to test the beta version. 
Create a blog or video log to allow people to follow the app’s progress. If 
your pre-launch marketing has been effective, by the time your app nears 
launch, you will have an army of Facebook friends or Twitter followers who 
will give you the precious momentum you need to make your app a success.
Every App Has Self-Marketing Mechanisms
Your app has internal marketing mechanisms that you can exploit to maximize 
its virality and drive downloads. One is giving users the opportunity to share their 
experience of your app with their friends on social media. This is an excellent 
marketing channel that should not be wasted, especially as it’s free. Free 
marketing will go a long way toward reducing your Customer Acquisition Cost 
(CAC), a very important metric that affects your app’s financial sustainability.
Another internal marketing mechanism is cross-promotion, which involves 
using push notifications and interstitial ads in one app to promote another 
app. This applies to publishers who have more than one app in the market 
and is a very useful free marketing mechanism that will also reduce your 
overall marketing costs.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
171
If you are a smart marketer, you won’t do all your marketing on your own, 
but rather will get your users to market your app for you. The best marketing 
team is an army of happy users raving about your app to their friends on 
social media, encouraging their friends and colleagues to download it, and 
giving you five-star reviews. Best of all, they will do all of this for free! In this 
sense, creating a strong user support system and feedback loop, updating 
your app regularly based on user feedback, and generally going out of your 
way to keep users happy are the most important marketing tactics you will 
ever employ.
Automate and Personalize Your Marketing Campaign
Approach your marketing campaign as a system that functions on four 
pillars: information, segmentation, personalization, and automation. First, use 
your app to gather information about your users. Two, use that information 
to segment your users based on their characteristics (location, language, 
gender, etc.) or behavior (frequency and duration of app use, etc.). Three, 
create personalized messages based on these segments. Four, automate the 
process (how often you target each segment, which channels you use, what 
content works best, etc.). All of this can have a major impact on conversions 
and profit, as the statistics from Appboy in Figure 12-3 suggest.
Figure 12-3.  App conversion stats
Developing a Marketing Strategy
A marketing strategy is something that you will be looking at early on in your 
project, as early as the idea-validation phase, because the success of your 
app will depend on growth and revenue, not just on how good your idea is.
A thorough marketing strategy for an app combines a number of key 
components that can change over time as your app gets adopted by users and 
the goals of your marketing campaign adjust to user behavior and feedback.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
172
Your marketing campaign will be based on the goals you have set, the 
budget you have set for your campaign, the user segment you want to 
target, the channel or channels you will use to reach that user segment, the 
content of your marketing message, and your offer, or value proposition. Two 
vital elements of any marketing strategy are attribution and segmentation.
Attribution
Your marketing strategy can only be effective if you are able to measure 
what you are doing and how your users are responding. Given that there are 
so many channels through which you can reach potential customers, one of 
the most basic measurements that needs to be made is finding out which 
channel is the most cost-effective and which is the most profitable so you 
know where to focus your efforts and which marketing content is working 
best. Are Facebook ads or YouTube videos the most effective for you? Are 
you making more money through ads or affiliate programs? Which e-mail 
style is getting the best response?
To measure all this, you need attribution. Attribution involves measuring the 
instances and frequency of specific events (such as when a user downloads 
an app, launches the app, re-launches the app, views ads in it, clicks on an 
ad, etc.). By recording these events and “attributing” to them to users or 
devices, you can derive a great deal of useful information about customer 
behavior and draw conclusions about which channels are working the best 
for you.
Segmentation
Segmentation means dividing your target users into different subgroups so 
that you can tailor your marketing strategy to their needs and interests. Your 
users will include different age groups, different professions, and a variety 
of preferred hangouts. Some of your users may be female teenagers who 
spend a lot of time on Facebook, while others may be male mid-career 
professionals who spend less time on social media but use e-mail a great 
deal. You won’t get very far by trying to market the same content to them 
in the same way. Each will respond positively to different marketing content 
on different channels. The first group is likely to respond well to content 
marketing and ads on Facebook, while the second group can be reached 
through e-mail ads. The way the first group will spend its money, and what 
they will spend it on, will differ from the spending habits of the second 
group, and you will have to employ different tactics to get them to part with 
that money. Segmentation helps you do that.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
173
Marketing Strategy Components
A marketing strategy comprises several components (Figure 12-4): the Goal, 
the Budget, the Segment, the Channel, the Content, and the Offer. Each of 
these components will differ for the various campaigns you develop designed 
to target different user groups on different occasions for differing objectives.
Figure 12-4.  The components of an app marketing strategy

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
174
Marketing Strategy Component 1: The Goal
What is the driving principle behind your marketing strategy? You are going 
after both growth and revenue, and in the app world it’s tough to get both at 
the same time, especially early on. So, which will you prioritize?
Experience suggests that the focus at the beginning should be on growth for 
several reasons.
Adoption
The adoption of your app will increase much faster with a pricing strategy 
that focuses on growth. In other words, your app is likely to do much better 
if it is free, because users are used to free apps and have to have a serious 
reason to pay for one. Users are highly unlikely to pay upfront for a new app, 
and your adoption rates and downloads will remain very low.
Remember, you will be competing with many other apps, more than 93 
percent of which are available for free download, so you are much more 
likely to maximize download rates with a free version of your app.
Monetization can be part of the app from the beginning—for example, in the 
form of in-app purchases—but the core functions should be made available 
for free at the beginning.
Information
When your app is new to the market, no matter how well designed it is, it 
will be some time before you achieve a strong product-market fit, or, in other 
words, before you establish a strong relationship between your product and 
its users. You will need to tweak the app, eliminate its flaws, and release more 
than one new version or update, possibly with new features you hadn’t planned 
on in the beginning, before you start to build a strong and loyal user base.
To do this, you will need information about your users as well as feedback 
and reviews from them. For this information and feedback to be useful, you 
will need a large number of users whose habits and app-use patterns you 
will track through analytics and whose feedback, opinions, and reviews you 
will solicit through push notifications. The larger your user base, the more 
relevant and useful the information you gather will be, and the better the 
quality of your product and its relevance to the user will be.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
175
Financing
Are you planning to take your app into startup territory with seed funding, 
venture capital, and so forth? An app with a large user base that has not yet 
reached positive cash flow is a much better candidate for attracting venture 
capital than is a monetized app with low revenue and a tiny user base. 
Market share is more important than revenue in the early stages. When you 
have market share, revenue is a much easier goal to pursue.
Furthermore, heavy monetization can seriously harm your momentum in the 
early stages of an app and can keep away your potential user base.
It’s true that as an appreneur your goal is likely to be to reach positive cash 
flow as soon as you can, but focusing on monetization from the outset will 
not help you do that. Delaying the focus on revenue until you have built a 
large-enough user base and then targeting users with a well-thought-out 
monetization strategy at a specific point in time is much more likely to lead 
to positive cash flow.
At different points in your app’s lifecycle, you will be interested in one or 
more of the following goals: finding more users and driving more downloads, 
strengthening engagement and retention among your existing users, 
bringing back users who downloaded your app but have lost interest, 
turning engaged but non-paying users into paying users, and getting 
already-paying users to pay more.
You can also see your users as being at different points in the user lifecycle: 
discovery, engagement, retention, loyalty, and abandonment. You can 
segment users based on this approach and set marketing goals accordingly. 
These marketing goals are very different from each other and will therefore 
require completely different marketing strategies with different marketing 
content and value propositions.
Marketing Campaign Types
Marketing campaigns differ immensely depending largely on their intended 
purpose and have names that correspond to that purpose. The most 
common campaign types are the following:
Onboarding – Onboarding is the process of welcoming a 
new user or customer who has taken the first step. In the 
app world, it would be someone who has just launched 
your app for the first time after downloading it. The 
purpose of onboarding is to welcome new users and offer 
guidance on how they can make the most of your app. The 
effectiveness of onboarding shows in Figure 12-5 below.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
176
Drip Campaign – A drip campaign is an automated 
marketing campaign with e-mails sent on a set schedule.
Shopping Cart Abandonment Campaign – Relevant to 
the online web and e-commerce apps, and targets users or 
customers who abandon a shopping cart halfway through 
the purchasing process. The purpose of such a campaign 
would be to find out why the shopping cart was abandoned 
and convince shoppers to return. A customer willing to 
spend money through your app is too precious to lose and 
should be enticed to return.
Re-subscription Campaign – These campaigns target 
users or customers who have canceled their subscription 
to a newsletter or other form of content marketing tool.
Churn Management Campaign – These types of 
campaigns target users who have abandoned an app and 
try to bring them back with enticing offers, like an alert 
about a new version with new features or features that have 
gone from paid to free.
Product Recommendation Campaign – As its name 
suggests, this type of campaign promotes products that 
may appeal to users. You could be promoting products 
related to your app, including digital products like in-app 
purchases or paid features, or be promoting someone 
else’s products to your users as part of an affiliate program.
List Growth Campaign – This type of campaign targets 
new users with the aim of driving downloads and growing 
an app’s user base.
Lead Qualifying Campaign – A lead qualifying campaign is 
designed to identify those users in your user base who are 
good prospects for monetization. They are those leads who 
have a specific need that your app meets and are prepared 
to pay money to fulfill that need through your app.
Figure 12-5.  E-mail marketing stats

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
177
Lead Nurturing – Lead nurturing is the process of building 
a relationship with your user base segments at different 
stages of the customer journey and helping users move 
from one stage to the next.
Marketing Strategy Component 2: The Budget
The size of your budget will inevitably determine the reach of your marketing 
campaign. The secret to marketing budgets is knowing how much to 
allocate to each of the channels you plan to use and how to make the most 
of your marketing dollars. It’s also important to compare channels to see 
which is more effective in helping you reach your target segment and goals.
To do that, what you need is a system to measure the ROI of your  
marketing campaign. You can measure the ROI, or return on investment, 
of a multi-channel campaign to see how well you did overall, or select a 
specific channel and measure the ROI to see how productive your marketing 
campaign is on that particular channel.
Marketing Strategy Component 3: The Segment
Marketing campaigns are much more effective when they target a specific 
segment than when they are generic in content and try to target everyone 
with the same message at the same time.
Analytics in your app will generate detailed information about your users 
and their behavior, which you can use to segment users depending on your 
goals. There are two fundamental ways to segment users:
Segment by User Characteristics – Separate your users 
into groups depending on characteristics such as location, 
age, gender, country of residence, spoken language, and 
profession.
Segment by Behavior – Divide users into groups based 
on how they are interacting with your app and where they 
are on the customer journey: new user, “light” users, deeply 
engaged users (based on frequency and duration of sessions 
and session intervals), lapsed users, and users who have 
abandoned the app. By looking closely at each segment you 
decide to target, you can determine which channel to use to 
target that segment and how to approach that segment to 
get a positive response to your value proposition.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
178
Figure 12-6.  Messaging stats
Personalization and Timing
The purpose of segmenting your target market or user group is to create the 
opportunity to personalize your marketing. Personalization can be based on any 
aspect of the user’s or group’s characteristics or behavior. For example, you can 
use location data to target users based on an event in their town, or target users 
in a specific country in their language. You can also time marketing messages to 
maximize the likelihood of a positive response, like targeting busy professionals 
at off-work hours or weekends, or building up a Christmas-related campaign 
in late November to early December. See Figure 12-6.
Personalizing your app to your users goes through the following process:
Segmentation – First, segment your users or target market 
in a relevant way, depending on the purpose of the ad 
campaign involved and on how much information about 
users is available.
Personalization – Second, create unique content for 
each segment. The content of a message—the layout, 
color coding, call to action—is all designed to appeal to 
the target segment and to produce useful information 
about which designs work best. As a further refinement, 
messages are addressed directly to the user.
Timing – Third, time a messaging campaign to the habits of 
each specific user to maximize the likelihood of a high open 
rate and a positive response to your message.
Marketing Strategy Component 4: The Channel
Where are your customers, and what’s the best way, the best medium, to reach 
them with your offer? This is what “channel” means. If you determine that 
segments consisting of younger users are highly active on social media, then 
focusing on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and other social media sites 
is the right channel in terms of both content and paid advertising. If your target 

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
179
segment consists of professionals in the 30 to 44 age group, then LinkedIn ads 
and an e-mail campaign might be the more productive channel combination.
It’s important to remember to use every relevant and effective channel to 
promote and market your app, and to learn the secrets of each channel. 
There are literally dozens of channels through which you can reach your 
desired user segment, the most important of which are listed in Figure 12-7. 
They include digital and non-digital channels, free and paid, traditional and 
unconventional. All can be highly productive if you match the segment with 
the right channel or channels.
Figure 12-7.  App marketing channels

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
180
As the following big list of marketing channels shows, it’s possible to divide 
these channels into two broad categories, digital and non-digital, and divide 
each into further subcategories. For example, digital marketing consists 
of social media, online branding, online advertising, e-mail, and in-app 
marketing. Non-digital channels are divided into broadcasting and telephone 
channels, store-related channels, event-based marketing, print, field 
marketing, and wearables and accessories. Each channel has its methods, 
characteristics, and use value in bringing you the customers you want.  
As you market your app, you will find not all are suitable for you, so make 
the effort to identify which channels are the most productive for you and 
allocate the bulk of your efforts and resources to them.
Digital Marketing: Social Media
Ignore this channel at your peril. Social media is one of the most effective, if 
not the most effective, channel by which to promote your app. Social media 
has grown to become probably the most important channel for advertising 
and promotion.
Social media presents you with a huge audience for your app, so as a 
channel it’s one of the biggest (Figure 12-8). Social media networks like 
Facebook and YouTube have more than one billion active monthly users, 
while others like Google+, Twitter, and Instagram have monthly users in the 
hundreds of millions.
Figure 12-8.  Social media stats
There are two ways to market on social media. One is the paid channel, like 
Facebook ads, and the other is the “free” channel, like posts, uploads, and 
content marketing.
Marketing on Facebook
The first step when marketing on social media is to have a specific goal 
and then organize your strategy and content around it. What stage is your 
app in right now? If your app is in the concept-development stage, you will 
probably want to validate the concept and test for audience response to 

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
181
see how people are reacting to your idea and to make projections about 
downloads. Your goal will be to get people to tell you what they think. If your 
app is in the development stage, then you will want to build up buzz around 
the upcoming launch of your app, so your primary goal will be sharing. If 
you’ve already published your app, you will be using social media to drive 
downloads, so your primary goal will be to lead the crowd to your App Store 
download page.
In each of these pre-launch and post-launch stages, Facebook will provide 
you with a number of ways to promote your app. One way is via Groups. 
Create a group for people who are excited about your product, regularly 
post news about your app as it goes through pre-launch, solicit opinions 
and feedback from your group members, and encourage the members to 
share their views with their circle of friends.
Another way to promote your app involves paid options that will help you 
get more likes and extend your reach, as well as Facebooks Ads, which will 
advertise the app to a target audience defined by you.
Directives
Once you know what you want from your audience, tell them. Make sure 
your social media funnel effectively directs visitors to where you want them 
to go and tells them via the right call to action exactly what you want them 
to do, such as “Share,” “Like this page,” or “Download Now.”
Marketing on Twitter
The key to effective marketing on Twitter is creating the right kind of short, 
re-tweetable content and making smart use of relevant hashtags, connecting 
them to current events to benefit from the public’s shifting interest. Following 
influencers and getting influencers to follow you is another key strategy 
for raising the exposure of your app across Twitter. Influencers are people 
whose opinion on their subject of expertise matters; they can give your app 
a boost simply by tweeting about it to their followers, or by following you 
and sharing your news with everyone on their list.
Marketing on Instagram
As a photo-sharing social media website and app, Instagram is a great 
channel for sharing photos related to your app, including screenshots and 
mockups. Using relevant hashtags—more than one, as opposed to  
Twitter—will help raise the online exposure of your photos.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
182
Taking Action Early
Marketing on social media is most effective when you have a large following, 
but this takes time. Ideally, to give your app the maximum amount of 
momentum, you should have a significantly large audience waiting for you 
when you publish your app. This means building your audience early on. Trying 
to build an audience after your app is already published will do very little for 
your app, so start early. As soon as your app enters the concept-design phase, 
develop a social media marketing strategy and use it to gauge audience 
reaction, build a core group of evangelists, and find a broader audience of 
eager customers.
Your focus when marketing on social media should be on gradually building 
a loyal and interested audience, which is achieved with a consistent 
presence, regular posts, and active interaction.
Smart Marketing
When implementing your marketing strategy, it pays to apply the following 
underlying guiding principles and tactics so as to maximize the positive 
response from your audience:
Appreciation – Reward your loyal audience with special 
offers and free stuff related to your app. If you are building 
buzz around your upcoming release, you might consider 
giving users an “early-bird” peek at the app. Or, if there 
are in-app purchases involved, you could offer your social 
media audience discounts on those purchases.
Interaction – Focus on human interaction, not direct 
marketing. Your social media audience will grow only if 
you directly interact with people, and will do so rarely if 
you approach them with direct marketing content. Share 
actively, but do not overwhelm your audience will repetitive 
material.
Attitude – Develop a positive attitude and respond 
positively to audience feedback. If your users are giving 
you feedback about your app’s weaknesses, the worst 
thing you can do is be defensive about it and criticize your 
users. Instead, be positive and thank everyone who gives 
you feedback, take action to fix those weaknesses, and 
let your audience know what you are doing about their 
feedback. Your users will appreciate your efforts, and you 
will be rewarded with more-loyal users, plus you’ll have a 
strong feedback channel that will help you develop the next 
version of your app.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
183
Involvement – Let your audience feel they are a part of 
your project. Ask them for feedback and opinions. Get 
some of your most loyal followers to test new versions of 
the app and tell you what they think.
Integration – Make social media a key part of the app 
itself. Allow and encourage users to share their experience, 
achievements, and opinions on social media, and they 
will act like marketers working for you for free. Incentivize 
sharing through the app with free stuff, and you will raise 
your marketing momentum significantly.
According to Openxcell (www.openxcell.com), social media marketing is 
second only to mobile search in the app discovery process and “trumps 
cross-selling, ad networks, incentivized ads and app discovery platforms in a 
number of areas, including conversion rate, user quality, and install volume.” 
So, it’s easy to see the value the social media marketing channel can have 
for your app and how useful it is to harness the secrets of this channel.
Is there a complete list of social media platforms that you can use for your 
social media campaigns? We are all familiar with Facebook, Google+, 
Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, and the other networks that have become 
household names, but there are dozens, if not hundreds, of social networks 
and social and professional spaces of interaction you can join to connect to 
people who may be interested in your product. The social media networks 
listed here are some of the biggest and most popular for networking, 
product promotion, and sharing of information:
Facebook (http://www.facebook.com), with 1.6 billion monthly active users
YouTube (https://www.youtube.com), with 1 billion monthly active users
Google+ (https://plus.google.com), with 440 million monthly active users
Instagram (http://www.instagram.com), with 430 million monthly active users
LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com), with 429 million monthly active users
Twitter (http://www.twitter.com), with 325 million monthly active users
Pinterest (http://pinterest.com), with 110 million monthly active users
Profile Visuals Cheat Sheet
For each of these social media networks, you will have to create marketing-
related visuals, like cover photos, banners, profile photos, headers, and 
backgrounds. The sizes of the visuals differ for each network. Use the cheat 
sheet in Figure 12-9 to speed up your work.

Digital Marketing: Online Branding and Identity
The majority of the channels you use to market your app will guide 
target users to a specific location, where they will respond to a CTA, or 
call to action, like downloading your app or subscribing to a newsletter. 
The inbound funnel, or people who come across your app on their own 
without your direct efforts, like by searching on the web or through 
recommendations from friends, will also arrive at one of these online 
locations. Such locations include your website or microsite and your App 
Store page or online store.
These locations will be components of your online brand, or the identity of 
your app, which means they will have to be consistent in terms of design, 
layout, color coding, and content in order to present a consistent image to 
your visitors.
Your customers will likely first discover your app at three key locations: your 
social media page (especially your Facebook profile), your website (which 
can be a simple search-enabled microsite), and your App Store page. Your 
social media profile pages and website should lead to the final destination, 
which is the App Store page where your app can be downloaded.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
185
Once your app is published, it will make sense to have channels ready to 
accept feedback and offer user support on your website and within your 
app. Once you have a significantly large user base, you can also create a 
forum so that users can help each other and share their experiences. These 
channels will be an invaluable source of information to help you identify pain 
points and gaps that should be fixed before you release the next version of 
your app. Blogs are also very useful tools for building an audience before 
the release of your app and for improving retention rates after release by 
offering relevant content.
App Store Optimization
The top way people search for apps to download is through the App Store. 
App Store Optimization (ASO) is the set of techniques publishers use to 
draw the maximum amount of attention to their app and “optimize” their 
app’s presence and ability to compete with other apps.
ASO begins with a clear understanding of what your target audience is 
searching for. The quality of your user research determines how effective 
your ASO efforts will be, because your research will produce a set of 
keywords that are likely to generate the highest traffic and downloads for 
your app. The keywords you have chosen may change from time to time 
depending on how they rank and how you are performing compared to your 
competitors.
In ASO, the following are optimized: the app’s title, icon, category, 
description, and screenshots. Other factors that affect ASO include the total 
number of downloads and app reviews, as they result in higher rankings. 
App reviews are difficult to optimize, however, because the publisher has 
little control over them.
Here’s how to optimize your app’s title, icon, description, and screenshots:
Title – Based on your user research, choose a title for your 
app that has the maximum appeal for your target user, 
using the main keyword from among the keywords you 
have chosen for your app. According to MobileDevHQ and 
Apptentive, app titles with keywords in them rank at least 
10 percent higher on average than titles without keywords.
It’s preferable that your app’s title be short, up to 25 
characters, so that it won’t get cut off on a smartphone 
screen. It should also be original so that it will be easily 
remembered and won’t get lost among apps with similar 
generic names.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
186
Icon – Design a visually appealing icon that best 
communicates what your app does and indicates the main 
function that it performs for its users. Ideally, the icon 
should be designed by a professional, as the difference 
in quality will significantly improve the impression the app 
makes on users.
Description – An app’s description affects ASO beyond 
just being what visitors to your App Store page read. 
The natural incorporation of your app’s keywords in the 
description influences how the App Store algorithms 
classify and rank the apps. Populate the app description 
with the keywords you have selected to maximize the 
chances of your app showing up high in search rankings.
Depending on the screen that’s displaying your App Store 
page, the description will be truncated, and visitors will be 
asked to press the More button to read further. Make sure 
your app’s function and benefits are “above the fold” of the 
description so that you’ll reach all your visitors.
Ratings and Reviews
App ratings and reviews are most useful at a very specific point in the 
customer journey—when the customer has already arrived at your App Store 
page and wants to assess how popular the app is and what other users 
think about it.
When visitors arrive at your App Store page, it means your marketing efforts 
have been successful and they are interested in your app. You already have 
a potential customer. Your app’s ratings and reviews are probably the last 
hurdle you need to cross to convince the visitor to download the app, and 
because of this, ratings and reviews are crucial for your app’s success.
The difference between the number of people who visit your App Store page 
and the number who actually download the app will give you a sense of the 
impact your page is having on visitors (Figure 12-10).

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
187
For the customer, however, there is a risk because reviews are not exactly 
reliable. Given the importance of reviews on download or purchase 
decisions, faking app reviews has become a big trend. App publishers 
pay money to get positive reviews for their app and negative reviews for 
competing apps.
Digital Marketing: Affiliate Marketing
Affiliate marketing is seen as a potentially lucrative alternative to the most 
popular monetization models for apps; namely, in-app purchases (payments 
from users) and freemium (ads-supported).
Affiliate marketing is a form of advertising whereby a merchant selling a 
product will use advertising space in your app to sell something, and if they 
close a sale with a customer they got through your app, you receive either 
a pre-set figure or a percentage of the value of the sale. Affiliate marketing 
can work for you in two ways—you can use your app to market other apps 
as a source of revenue, or you can recruit affiliates to market your app as a 
means of driving downloads.
Affiliate programs also involve rewarding users for referring people they 
know to your app. Affiliate marketing can be cost-effective because people 
are more likely to download an app if it's been recommended by someone 
they know.
Referrals are tracked through software known as affiliate platforms. These 
platforms follow and report on how affiliate programs are working by 
measuring specific events for which you can get paid, such as downloading 
an app, subscribing to an e-mail list, making an in-app purchase, and 
viewing or tapping on an ad.
It is also possible to develop apps intended primarily for revenue through 
affiliate marketing. For example, a publisher might develop an app related 
to food with the intention of referring users to nearby specialty food stores 
based on their location, building a business model around affiliate marketing 
revenue from these stores.
Figure 12-10.  App download stats

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
188
While affiliate marketing can be lucrative compared to other advertising 
methods, there are two key obstacles to consider: difficulties related to 
thoroughly tracking user behavior, especially knowing which marketing 
platform a certain ad was displayed on, and those related to using links 
within the content of the app, which is highly relevant in affiliate marketing. 
Another obstacle that could undermine your affiliate marketing campaign, 
especially if you are directing users to products on a merchant’s website, is 
the possibility that the merchant’s website is not adapted properly for mobile 
or does not provide a smooth checkout process, in which case the purchase 
will be abandoned and your revenues will suffer because of someone else.
Digital Marketing: E-mail Marketing
E-mail is one of the oldest online marketing channels, of course. It’s been 
around more or less since the invention of the Internet, and it remains a 
major marketing channel with a higher click-through rate than many other 
channels (Figure 12-11).
Figure 12-11.  E-mail marketing stats
There are many companies that can help you automate your e-mail 
marketing campaigns with mailing lists, e-mail templates designed with best 
practices, and many other useful features.
Digital Marketing: Push Notifications and In-App Messages
Push notifications and in-app messages are messages from an app that 
appear on a mobile screen. A push notification is a message from your app 
that appears on a mobile screen while a customer is using another app 
(Figure 12-12), while an in-app message is a message that appears when a 
customer is using your app, or, in other words, a message that is delivered 
from inside your app. Both can contain text, images, and calls to action.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
189
Push Notifications
Push notifications are a type of message. They pop up on a mobile screen 
at specific times or intervals without any intervention by the user. An app 
that is not being used can still send a push notification even if the user is not 
actually using his device. The timing of the push notification is chosen by the 
advertiser, but an app user can decide whether or not they want to receive 
them at all.
Push notifications on an app screen can be used to advertise the app 
publisher’s other products. They can also be used for remarketing, such as 
encouraging users who haven’t used their app for a while to return; to notify 
an app user when they receive an e-mail or post; and generally to deliver 
tailored information requested by the user directly to their lock screen. They 
can also be used to solicit feedback and information from the user.
Push notifications help you extend your reach to customers who have 
downloaded your app even when they are not actually using it. Such 
messages can be used to deliver information to customers, request 
information for a survey, solicit feedback to improve the user experience, 
deliver a call to action, or advertise a product or service. Many app 
publishers with multiple apps in the app stores use push notifications to 
Figure 12-12.  Push notifications

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
190
market each of their apps across all the others. Figure 12-13 reveals some 
interesting statistics.
Figure 12-13.  Push notification stats
Social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest rely heavily 
on push notifications to keep customers involved. They supply long lists of 
options for push notifications, such as those that notify you when someone 
uploads a photo, makes a comment, sends you an invite, accepts your own 
invite, decides to follow you, re-tweets your tweet, likes or dislikes your 
post, or invites you to join a group or attend an event. Some apps have all 
push notification types turned on by default, and you have to turn off the 
ones you don’t want to receive.
Online push-notification vendors can help you automate the process of 
sending push notifications and gathering data about your users through 
them to help you market to your users more effectively. Many allow you to 
combine location information and behavioral data to personalize your push 
notifications so as to increase positive response rates.
The effectiveness of push notifications depends on when the user receives 
the message (timing of notification), what the message says (subject), and 
how often the user is receiving the same message or different messages 
(notification schedule). Sending users too many notifications can be irritating 
and drive them away.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
191
In-App Messages
In-app messages are messages that show up on the mobile screen when a 
user is actually inside your app (Figure 12-14).
Figure 12-14.  In-app messages
These messages vary a great deal depending on where the user is  
inside the app, what they are doing, and what you want them to do. Many 
in-app messages are triggered by user actions. According to app design 
firm Localytics, “in-app messaging should feel like a natural part of the 
app, not additional marketing, and can be used by marketers to fine-tune 
app content or promotional strategy.” Seamless integration with the user 
experience through fine-tuned design, timing, and content is the key.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
192
Push notifications and in-app messages are highly effective for
 maintaining user retention rates and keeping your users 
engaged with your app through new offers and free stuff;
 increasing conversion rates for a specific action, like 
buying, viewing, or sharing something specific;
 informing users about updates, upgrades, offers, or 
anything new;
 asking users for their opinion and communicating with 
users in general; and
 improving your app’s ratings and reviews.
Digital Marketing: Splash Screens
A splash screen is a full-screen still image that shows up when you press an 
app icon to launch an app. It fills the space between the pressing of the icon 
and the actual start of the app, usually no more than a few seconds.
A splash screen is a good opportunity to reinforce your brand by placing 
your logo on a single-color or relevant and interesting background. Another 
option is to use the splash screen to put the user in the right mood, 
especially if the app is a game. As it lasts only a few seconds, there’s little 
else that a splash screen can do.
Make sure your users know the app is loading while they are looking at the 
splash screen, because a splash screen is just an image, and users can 
easily think the app is being unresponsive.
Also, make sure you have splash screens for different device resolutions. 
In the case of Android, as there are so many different devices and screen 
resolutions, making sure your splash screen looks right is an important 
issue. It’s impossible to design one splash screen for each screen resolution, 
so the best tactic is to design three screens, for small, midsize, and large 
screens.
Paid Advertising
Paid advertising applies to online channels, like ads on websites, blogs, and 
social media networks, as well as ads in other apps. Paid advertising also 
includes offline channels, like newspapers, magazines, radio, and television. 
There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there depending 
on your target market and the best ways to reach it. Marketers, however, 
usually group their marketing campaigns into paid and free, or inbound, to 
more clearly determine the productivity of their marketing spend. Relevant 
app monetization statistics can be seen below in Figure 12-15.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
193
Whether you have a big budget or a small one, it’s very easy to overspend 
on marketing and get little in return, so spending wisely on the right 
channels is very important in order to produce the results you want. 
Although it varies greatly across countries and types of apps and fluctuates 
over time, the average cost of getting a user to install your app, or CAC 
(Customer Acquisition Cost), is estimated to be between $2.50 and $3.50. 
This means that if you have set a goal of getting at least 100,000 installs 
in order to generate the revenue you need to be sustainable, you should 
expect to spend between $250,000 and $350,000 on marketing.
Digital Marketing: Review Site Submissions
Once your app is online, submit it to as many app review sites as you can. 
Most are free; some are paid. They’re great for free (or paid) exposure for 
your app.
Visit the following links for lists of the top 200+ app review websites:

Non-Digital Marketing: Print and Press—Ads, Articles,  
and Interviews
Print and press are not channels you will be using constantly; you will not be 
publishing articles or buying newspaper ads once a week. Advertising in print 
is something you will be doing at very specific points that are carefully timed 
to coincide with events like the launch of your app. For example, you can 
use a full-page newspaper ad to build up interest in your app launch or solicit 
an article or interview about your startup in a magazine. The most important 
aspect is timing: you should be prepared to use the interest that ads or 
articles can generate to promote the app or the event you have planned.
Figure 12-15.  App monetization stats

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
194
Word of Mouth
Don’t underestimate the most traditional of channels: word of mouth. Talk 
publicly about your app at every opportunity. Create buzz around it before 
and after release by giving interviews on radio and television and building 
a highly talkative social media following. Introduce and discuss your app in 
one or more videos and post them on video-sharing sites.
Don’t be the only one talking! After release, get your users to talk about the 
app by creating a forum where they can share their opinions, offer feedback, 
and get answers to questions they might have!
Marketing Strategy Component 5: The Content
You will be generating marketing content that will vary depending on the 
channel and the format, from AdWords ads to articles or social media posts. 
The content of your marketing campaign needs to be carefully designed to 
appeal to your target audience, and to do that it should take into account 
the following:
Make content keyword-rich. Your content not only needs 
to be read, but also needs to be found easily in search. To 
do that, it has to contain keywords that match the search 
terms your audience will use.
Use power words. Power words for marketing, like 
“discover,” “easy,” “guaranteed,” “free,” “instant,” and 
“real,” inspire, motivate, and convert. Use them intelligently 
in marketing copy to get readers to press the Download 
Now button.
Make smart use of calls to action. CTAs are assertive 
statements instructing readers to do something, like 
“Download Now!” or “Join Now!” CTAs that are positioned 
correctly in a message, with the right color coding and 
wording, will have a huge impact on the effectiveness 
of your marketing campaign. The best way to develop a 
library of effective messages and CTAs is to test a number 
of variations to see which one works best, a method known 
as multi-variate testing, or A/B testing.
Marketing Strategy Component 6: The Offer
The final component of your marketing strategy is the offer, or the value 
proposition. Again, what you offer your target audience depends on the 
characteristics of that segment, where they are on the customer journey, 

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
195
and your own growth and customer acquisition goals. Are you trying to get 
a new visitor to download your app, rewarding a loyal user with free stuff to 
increase user engagement and retention, or urging a lapsed user to return 
to the app? Each segment will respond positively to a relevant offer, and 
segmentation, as always, is the key to strong ROI on your campaign.
Extend Your Reach with Smart Tactics
In your effort to make the most of your marketing spend, apply the tactics 
outlined in the following sections to give your campaign an edge.
Deep Linking
Deep linking in the app world occurs when content inside one app 
connects to content inside another app. Deep linking is a way for an app to 
exponentially increase its exposure to users through ways other than direct 
marketing, and therefore increase user acquisition and (hopefully) retention 
through organic channels.
For example, say you are browsing through a fashion magazine app A, and 
you come across an ad for a set of beauty products sold through another 
app, an e-commerce app B. When you press the link in app A, you will be 
directed to the product’s page inside app B, where your shopping cart will 
be filled with that particular product, ready for checkout. If you don’t have 
the e-commerce app B installed, you will be directed to the App Store. After 
you download and launch the app, you will be directed to the product’s 
page inside app B. This is how deep linking works—directing you from deep 
inside one app to deep inside another app.
However, while it’s easy to navigate in this way from one website to another, 
doing it from one app to another is much more complex because you may 
be navigating across platforms, apps, and devices. Effective deep linking is 
valued as a means of decreasing the cost-per-install of mobile apps. Social 
media ads in particular that contain deep links to content inside your app are 
a highly effective app marketing tool.
Desktop-to-Mobile Marketing
Desktop-to-mobile app marketing allows you to target users who are using 
desktops instead of mobile phones to browse. Users submit their phone 
number on a site, like the Groupon website, and receive a link via SMS that 
downloads the app to their mobile phone when pressed.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
196
Internal Marketing Channels
Internal marketing channels, for the purposes of this book, are those 
channels that function from within your app, effectively turning your users 
into app promoters working for you for free. By sharing their experience or 
the content they create and giving your app their review or feedback, your 
users also help you promote your app at no cost to you, and their word as 
users goes a long way. Thus, from a marketing perspective, your users have 
very high value.
You can turn your users into promoters by using the following technique.
Ask for Reviews
By asking for reviews, you create an opportunity for users to rave about how 
great your app is and how much they love it.
The gamble, of course, is that they could provide negative reviews, which 
will have the opposite effect. A bad review, however, can be very useful for 
you because it can tell you where you may be making mistakes and turning 
off users. The value of a good review is for promotion, while the value of a 
bad review is for feedback to support the design of the next release of your 
app. However, you want to avoid bad reviews as much as possible.
This means good reviews should be treated differently than bad reviews. 
Good reviews should be directed to your App Store page, while bad reviews 
should be directed to you. But how can you tell how your user intends to 
review your app?
Don’t directly ask your users to review your app. First, ask your users in 
a push notification whether or not they love your app. If they say they do, 
direct them to your App Store page. If they say they don’t, ask them to tell 
you why and launch an e-mail dialog to help them do so. This way, bad 
reviews will be directed to you instead of showing up on the App Store 
page, thus raising your app’s average rating.
Good marketing requires that you prompt users to offer their opinion in one 
way or another. It’s up to you to decide how, when, and how often you will 
prompt users to do so. You can use push notifications to prompt users at 
regular intervals, like every fourth time they launch the app, or every third 
time they close it, on exit. It’s up to you.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
197
Measuring App Performance
Now that you are marketing your app, you are going to use analytics, KPIs 
(key performance indicators), and benchmarks to measure how well you are 
doing and how effective your marketing is. Your decisions will be effective 
when they are informed and supported by accurate information. There are 
four main categories of analytics: User Analytics provide information about 
your users and their behavior; Performance Analytics measure how your 
app itself is performing; Financial Analytics will tell you how well your app 
is performing financially; and Visual Analytics measure the effectiveness of 
an app in visually communicating the right information to users.
These different groups of metrics combine to create a picture of how well 
your app is doing and how effective it is in terms of design, content, and 
monetization. Most important, analytics will help you identify where the 
biggest problems are in your app and what to change to fully optimize it.
User Analytics
User analytics provide information about who your users are, how they are 
interacting with your app, what devices they are using, how often they are 
using your app, and how much time they spend on it on average. Detailed 
information about users helps you tailor your app to their tastes and improve 
their engagement with the app.
Performance Analytics
Performance analytics measure the technical performance of your app, such 
as how long it takes to load and how often it crashes. The loading time of 
your app may seem relatively unimportant, but it will affect how much users 
enjoy using it and how many of them will abandon it in frustration.
Fast, efficient, and reliable performance is a key component of strong user 
engagement and is the result of skilled programming and extensive testing 
before release, as well as close monitoring and constant improvement after 
release. As Figure 12-16 below shows, users value instant responsiveness, 
and punish apps that don’t have it.

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
198
Financial Analytics
Financial analytics provide information about your app’s commercial 
performance and consist of two parts: revenue analytics and marketing and 
advertising analytics.
Revenue analytics will tell you how much money your users are spending on 
your app, who is spending the most money, and which channels are your 
best sources of revenue. Marketing and advertising analytics will tell you 
which marketing channels are bringing in the most users and how effective 
your spending on marketing really is. Campaign analytics, meanwhile, is 
a focused part of your overall marketing analytics, and will measure the 
effectiveness of a specific marketing campaign, or a specific ad type, over a 
set period of time.
Visual Analytics
Visual analytics involve the use of tools like touch heatmaps, user journey 
recordings, session playbacks, and real-time reporting to understand how 
your users are interacting with your app, which buttons or icons they are 
pressing, and which parts they are ignoring.
By supplying accurate real-time information about whether your users are 
interacting with the app the way you want them to, visual analytics will help 
you identify and correct UI problems that are frustrating users, optimize the 
user experience, and maximize your app’s revenue potential.
Metrics
There are literally thousands of metrics and KPIs you can use to measure the 
performance of an app from different perspectives. Analytics software allows 
you to customize your analytics reports depending on what questions about 
your app’s performance or your users’ behavior and preferences you want to 
answer.
Figure 12-16.  User behavior stats

CHAPTER 12: Marketing Your App
199
Metrics and KPIs also differ based on the type of app involved, such 
as games, enterprise apps, or commercial apps. Each will set its own 
benchmarks for user engagement, profitability, and virality on social media, 
use very different metrics to measure success, and monitor user behavior 
from very different angles.
Key Analytics KPIs
The following analytics KPIs are among the most important ones that 
markerters use to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.
Depth of Visit – the number of screens a user views during a single session
Session Interval – the time it takes for a user to launch the app again after 
closing it
Organic User Growth Rate – the number of new users who do not originate 
from marketing campaigns but “organically”
Lifetime Value (LTV) – the total revenue a user will generate over their 
lifetime using an app
Other KPIs like Churn Rate and Retention Rate have been discussed in 
previous chapters.
Examples of User Engagement and Financial Metrics
User engagement and financial metrics include User Native Language 
Distribution, Goal Completion Rate, Number of Sessions in First Week, 
Peak Usage Times of Day, Abandonment Rate, Session Interval, Number 
of Active Users, Brand Awareness, Behavior Flow, Retention Rate, Number 
of Screens Visited, Number of Content Uploads, Number of Shares, Depth 
of Visit, Churn Rate, Conversion Rate, Session Frequency, OS Version 
Distribution, Device Type Distribution, Geographic User Distribution, Session 
Duration, Organic User Growth Rate, Download Count, Permissions Granted, 
User Lifecycle Duration, Number of Product Likes, Average Revenue per 
Transaction, Pay per Click (PPC), Total Revenue from Acquired Users, Cost 
per Click (CPC), Number of New Customers per Month, Cost per Install (CPI), 
Cost per Thousand Impressions (CPM), Paid Conversion Rate, Shopping 
Cart Abandonment Rate, Peak Transaction Times, Customer Acquisition 
Cost (CAC), Percent of New Leads, Average Revenue per User (ARPU), 
Number of User Likes, Transactions per Second, Hour, or Day, Application 
Latency, Number of Items in Shopping Cart, Network Error Rate, Number of 
Subscriptions/Registrations, API Latency, Customer Lifetime Value (LTV), App 
Load per Period, Percent of Mobile Influenced Customers, App Crash Rate, 
App User Review Frequency, Throughput, and App Load Time.

How Do I Use Analytics in My App?
Apple will automatically produce analytics reports for you after launch, but 
you may also want to use other analytics providers as well. Using external 
analytics suppliers in your app is easy. First, register with an analytics 
provider (see our list in Chapter 15). Second, create a unique tracking ID that 
will be part of your app’s code. The analytics supplier will create that ID for 
you once you fill in the necessary information about your app. Third, insert a 
snippet of code with this ID in your app’s code before release.
That's it! Your app will start creating reports.
Summary
Marketing is a science and an art whose efficiency increases with user 
data. The more information you have about your users, the better you will 
get at marketing to them. Therefore, the very first step toward successful 
marketing is to get as much information about your audience as you can, 
and then to get your app users to share as much as possible about what 
they like or don’t like about your product.

App Marketing Concepts
The evolution of digital marketing has spawned and keeps spawning new 
concepts, strategies, techniques, and methods that marketers employ 
to target, reach and convert potential customers. The following are some 
fundamental assumptions and observations that underlie the majority of 
these concepts:
 App users behave in different ways and use the app 
they have downloaded differently than other users do.

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
202
 Users at different stages in their engagement with 
an app, a brand, or a product respond differently to 
marketing content, and therefore marketing campaigns 
need to segment users based on different factors and 
tailor marketing content to the habits and preferences of 
these segments.
 New technologies allow a great deal of marketing-
related activities, like buying ad content (programmatic 
marketing), to be automated. Companies that automate 
their marketing processes can create higher levels of 
efficiency and increase marketing ROI.
Let’s look at the most popular marketing concepts that are employed in app 
marketing.
Predictive Marketing
Predictive marketing involves using data science that is based on customer 
behavior and habits to make smarter marketing decisions (Figure 13-1). By 
gathering and analyzing data about user behavior and identifying patterns, 
marketers are able to make forecasts about user behavior and make 
informed decisions about the likelihood of the success of their marketing 
content and offerings.
Marketers can get better returns on their marketing spend by targeting the 
right user at the right time with the right offer. Predictive marketing is usually 
optimized in combination with personalization.
A/B Testing
A/B testing (also known as split testing or multi-variate testing) involves the 
use of several versions of the same ad, distributed to different groups, with 
different designs, color coding, calls to action, and message content, to 
determine which version produces the highest conversion rate. Normally, 
predicting which ad design will work best is impossible, so A/B testing fills in 
the gap as users themselves tell the marketer which is most convincing.
Figure 13-1.  Predictive marketing

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
203
Remarketing/Retargeting
A very small percentage of people who come across an app will respond 
positively to a call to action and download the app. Among customers who 
engage with the app, another significant number will quickly abandon it, or 
will keep it but use it very rarely. In general, over 90 percent of visitors to a 
website leave without converting, and 70 percent abandon shopping carts.
Remarketing targets everyone who has come into contact with your product 
but hasn’t converted, or who converted but later abandoned the app. It 
allows marketers to reconnect with these categories of users and “bring 
them back,” or increase the time they spend engaging with the app.
Customers who are on your remarketing list are more valuable than an 
average customer because they have already expressed some form of 
interest simply by downloading your app or visiting your website or app 
page. This means that a campaign designed to convert them is likely to be 
more effective than one targeting new customers.
Personalization
Personalization, also known as customer-centered marketing or one-to-
one marketing, involves customizing the timing and content of marketing 
messages to the target user based on their preferences, habits, and 
behavior patterns. Personalized messages refer to every user by name 
and entice the user to become more engaged with an app with the right 
kind of incentive based on their characteristics, like age, gender, location, 
profession, and financial segment. The aim of personalization is to raise the 
effectiveness of marketing campaigns by approaching users with the offer 
that is most likely to appeal to them.
Personalization is a very powerful tool for converting customers. Over 
40 percent of consumers say they value companies that remember past 
shopping behavior, and just under 70 percent say they prefer personalized 
shopping.
Marketing Funnel
A marketing funnel is a visual representation of the different phases in a 
customer’s journey toward conversion and their relationship with a product 
(Figure 13-2).

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
204
One way of segmenting users is by their location on the marketing funnel, or 
their location on the customer journey. Are they new users, or are they users 
who downloaded the app some time ago and are now not as engaged with 
it as they used to be? By segmenting customers based on where they are 
located in the funnel, marketers target these groups much more effectively, 
sending the offer that is most likely to move them to the next level. For 
example, turning unaware visitors into brand-aware potential customers 
requires a different approach through a different channel than what would 
be used when trying to turn leads interacting with your brand into converted 
customers.
Funnels are usually divided into three broad sections—TOFU (Top of Funnel), 
MOFU (Middle of Funnel), and BOFU (Bottom of Funnel)—and separate 
marketing strategies are assigned to each.
Incentivization
The incentivized model (also known as the sponsored, reward-based, or 
value-exchange ad model) is the strategy of making a product, program, 
or other offering more attractive to customers by offering an incentive in 
exchange for buying or participating.
In the app business, incentivization is normally used to quickly amass app 
installs. For example, a retail company may offer its customers discounts 
and/or loyalty rewards if they make purchases through its app. A content 
publisher could offer exclusive content available only on its app, or a game 
may offer first-time downloaders a certain amount of virtual currency they 
can use in the game. Publishers and marketers use incentivized installs 
to generate installs more quickly and cheaply than if they used non-
incentivized methods, as the incentive offered makes it much more likely 
Figure 13-2.  Marketing funnel

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
205
that a potential customer will install the app on their device. However, since 
customers who download an app because of the attached incentive are 
less likely to keep the app, they should be targeted with a focused retention 
strategy to prevent churn.
Thought- Leadership Marketing
Thought-leadership marketing is the process of positioning a company 
as a leader in a specific domain by supplying customers with top-quality 
information. This is usually done by creating a special section on a company 
website that offers free e-books, infographics, and other downloads; 
launching a blog and populating it with content from top-notch authors; 
organizing webinars; and launching a video content channel on YouTube or 
Vimeo that offers customers quality content, like how-to’s, guides, and other 
information that the company’s existing customers and new visitors are 
likely to find very useful.
The idea behind thought-leadership marketing is to build a company’s 
reputation to the point where that company is the first thing that comes to a 
customer’s mind whenever they want to fix a problem or answer a question.
Programmatic Marketing
Programmatic marketing is the automated, algorithm-based, real-time 
buying and selling of advertising space through a bidding system, with the 
aim of reaching the right customers at the right time.
According to iab.com, programmatic marketing involves “four main types of 
transactions—open auctions, invitation-only/private auctions, unreserved 
fixed rate/preferred deals, and automated guaranteed/programmatic 
guaranteed deals.”
Programmatic marketing greatly increases the level of personalization of the 
ad content and its timing, and greatly increases the efficiency of marketing 
campaigns and spending.
Programmatic ad buying grew from around $10 billion in 2014 to just under 
$15 billion in 2015, out of the total $58.6 billion spent on digital advertising.
Identity Resolution
Identity resolution is a process through which large amounts of data in 
separate databases are analyzed to find identity matches and “resolve” 
identities. In the app business, identity resolution is used primarily to prevent 
a customer from engaging with a brand or an app through multiple devices 

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
206
or through several identities being counted as different people. It is also 
used to avoid having different people with the same name get counted 
as the same person. Another important use for identity resolution is the 
prevention of fraud and identity theft.
Single-Channel, Multi-Channel, Omni-Channel 
Marketing
Single-channel, multi-channel, and omni-channel marketing refers to 
the number of channels that are used to reach customers in a marketing 
campaign. A single-channel marketing campaign involves reaching users 
through a single channel, like Facebook ads, for example. A multi-channel 
campaign uses more than one channel, while an omni-channel marketing 
campaign attempts to reach users through all available channels.
The main purpose of an omni-channel campaign is to ensure that customers 
are offered a consistent, seamless experience across all the channels or 
devices through which they are interacting with a brand. An omni-channel 
strategy employs search, social media, SEO, a corporate website, print, 
apps, forums, online ads, and all other available channels to acquire 
customers.
Mobile App Attribution
Mobile app attribution is the process of recording and measuring the actions 
of app users, such as installs, level completions, in-app purchases, and 
other milestones.
Mobile app attribution differs from traditional online attribution, which 
uses cookies and pixel tags. These methods do not work in mobile app 
attribution, and mobile marketers and platform developers like Apple and 
Google have come up with new methods of attribution. The most universal 
methods are the following:
 Device Fingerprinting – An ad that is displayed on a 
device gathers information about that device to create 
a unique identity and submit that information to the 
marketer.
 Unique Identifier Matching – A mobile attribution tool 
automatically compares unique identifiers in real-time, 
matching these identifiers to each other, from ad clicks 
to installs and other actions.

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
207
Mobile app attribution is essential to app marketing because it helps 
produce the data that is gathered and analyzed to measure how well 
marketing campaigns are working. It supports higher-level performance 
tracking, as well as marketing strategies like personalization and predictive 
marketing.
Content Marketing
Content marketing is a marketing strategy that involves producing content 
that potential customers find useful, valuable, and relevant. Content 
marketing has grown in popularity and relevance alongside the evolution 
of social media, which is now the primary medium for the dissemination of 
content to users.
One big advantage of content marketing is that ads or links embedded 
in that content survive ad-blockers and are more reliably delivered to 
customers. For example, an ad embedded in an article as a link to the 
advertiser will not be removed by ad blockers.
Content marketing is highly effective at building a loyal user base and 
converting leads into customers. It’s also useful for helping a company 
build up its reputation as a leader in its field, and in that respect it’s part 
of thought-leadership marketing. Game developers who post walkthrough 
videos of levels in their game on YouTube are employing content marketing. 
One example of great content marketing is used for the Clash of Clans 
game, as fans of the game are allowed to post their own game art on the 
Clash of Clans Facebook page.
Loyalty Marketing
Loyalty marketing is a marketing strategy that focuses on nurturing existing 
customers rather than acquiring new ones. Loyalty marketing sets goals 
like raising the average revenue from existing customers, turning loyal 
customers into evangelists by asking them to share content about your 
product or brand, and increasing an existing customer’s level of engagement 
with a brand by offering them incentives.
Behavioral Marketing
Behavioral marketing involves segmenting your app’s user base based on 
user behavior with the aim of refining your marketing strategy and more 
effectively targeting users. For example, a user who downloads a clothing 
manufacturer’s app and searches for offers on leather jackets is sent 
notifications about discounts on leather jackets or a new collection that has 

CHAPTER 13: App Marketing Concepts
208
just arrived. Another example is a “Well done!” message sent to a language 
app user who has just completed a basic level; the message also contains 
discounts or special offers for the paid higher levels for that language.
Behavioral marketing helps marketers understand the different subgroups 
that make up their customer base, and therefore helps them create targeted 
content and ads customized for those groups based on their choices.
Summary
Marketing is a field that is evolving very fast as new technologies create new 
ways to amplify the effectiveness and efficiency of marketing campaigns. 
Keeping up with marketing methods as they become available is key to 
maintaining your edge over other competing apps and maximizing the return 
on your marketing budget.

Prepare for Success

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
210
What any appreneur fears most is, of course, failure. But, as we’ll see in this 
chapter, there’s something worse than failure—success for which you are 
unprepared. It’s worse because the aftertaste is more bitter when you know 
you almost succeeded than when you never had a chance. It’s therefore 
imperative to be prepared to adapt very fast and grow with your app when it 
becomes a hit.
Sudden Success
It’s every app publisher’s dream: you design and release an app to the 
world, and all of a sudden it’s an overnight super-hit, with fast-growing 
downloads, special attention from investors and the media, and maybe even 
talk about an award or two. You, in the meantime, are ecstatically trying to 
absorb your success.
Not so fast. This dream could very easily turn into a nightmare if you are 
unprepared for sudden success and rapid growth. If you fail to adapt very 
fast, the popularity of your app will deflate just as fast as it grew, and your 
app will be dead in the water.
This does not mean you have to invest large amounts of money beforehand, 
when there is no indication that your app is a surefire super-hit. This would be 
unrealistic and foolish. However, the whole team involved in your app project 
needs to know and understand the components of rapid growth should it 
be necessary and be prepared as much as is possible to adapt to the new 
situation. If you think about these components only after you have achieved 
sudden success, it will probably be too late, and that would be a real shame, 
wouldn’t it? An app that “could have been and almost was” is even worse 
than one that “never had a chance,” so don’t let it happen to you.
Let’s start by taking a closer look at what can happen in a worst-case 
scenario, when your app unexpectedly becomes an overnight success but 
you are completely unprepared and unable to adapt.
First, you start to see a snowball effect in the number of app downloads and 
active users. People are using your app heavily, sharing their experience 
with others, and giving it rave reviews, while you and your team are 
celebrating your success, convinced you’ve hit a home run and that your 
success is permanent (Figure 14-1).

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
211
After a number of positive reviews by top app industry blogs, the media 
are banging on your door. This draws the attention of investors and venture 
capitalists, who are interested in your app’s potential. Meanwhile, you and 
your friends are still busy celebrating.
Then, things start to go wrong. Your servers and backend cannot handle 
the traffic from so many users. You need bandwidth to maintain your app’s 
response time for content delivery and space to store all the data you are 
gathering and processing.
Your users are starting to get unhappy. Many have come across bugs in your 
design and pointed them out to you, but there seems to be no response, 
or your response is not quick enough. You simply can’t respond to user 
complaints with your small team, and you probably don’t have a Customer 
Relationship Management unit yet. The crash rate is rising along with the 
number of users. No one is working on a new version. As the bugs remain 
unfixed, people are starting to complain, and five-star and four-star reviews 
are turning into one-star and two-star reviews. Eventually, your users start to 
abandon the app because there’s a better-designed alternative by another 
publisher available.
In the meantime, the app industry media have already moved on to the next 
superstar, and investors who were originally interested have also moved on 
to other projects because you simply did not have a detailed vision for the 
future of your project or a detailed business plan to prove you know how to 
get there.
Finally, your team members are jumping ship to start other projects on their 
own or are getting hired by the competition. You are left alone in your empty 
office, wondering how and why this happened.
Figure 14-1.  The worst-case scenario for an app startup

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
212
A somewhat dramatic depiction, yes, but one that could easily become a 
reality for the unprepared. In this situation, failure has nothing to do with 
your original idea or the design of the app. In fact, the early success of 
your app proves you did many things right and found the success you were 
seeking. The failure of your app is the result of your failure to manage that 
success. You had a great concept but terrible implementation. A concept, 
no matter how good, is worthless without great implementation.
Startup Pitfalls: Why up to 90 Percent Fail
You have to be careful not to make the mistakes many startups make 
that lead to failure. So, before we look at the fate that awaits a successful 
startup, let’s look at the most common reasons why startups fail.
Estimates of the percentage of tech startups that fail vary between 75 percent 
and over 90 percent. It is also an open secret that venture capitalists expect 
four out of ten of the tech startups they invest in to fail, and only one out of 
ten to be a big success. With the odds stacked so highly against you even 
before you start, it pays to know the traps that await you.
The causes of failure for tech startups fall into four main categories: 
technical, financial, strategic, and behavioral. All can undermine a startup 
to the point that it falls apart before reaching the milestone of financial 
sustainability. Some startups still fail after they reach that milestone, having 
consumed millions of dollars in investor money.
 Technical
 Choosing the wrong platform, or trying to develop for all 
platforms at the same time
 Launching the app too early
 Launching the app too late, after it’s been overtaken by 
competition
 Failing to test for bugs before release
 Launching a badly designed app
 Failing to include promotion methods (social media sharing, 
push notifications) in the design of the app
 Failing to include analytics
 Financial
 Not raising enough money
 Raising too much money

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
213
 Spending too much (especially by paying hourly rates and 
spending highly on paid promotion channels)
 Spending too little
 Using the wrong monetization strategy for your app (like 
charging users upfront without offering a free version and 
failing to include attractive in-app purchases)
 Strategic
 Failing to combine the necessary skills in the startup’s 
founding team
 Targeting a niche that is too narrow
 Choosing an unfavorable location with no access to the 
support environment suitable for fast-growing startups.
 Investing in an idea for which there is little demand
 Failing to target a clearly defined user category
 Behavioral
 Insisting on pursuing a bad idea
 Not wanting to get involved in the day-to-day management  
of the startup
 Conflicts in the founding team
 Conflicts with investors
 Hiring the wrong people
Changing Your Mindset
As part of an app development team, the very first and most important step 
you have to take to prepare for success is to change your frame of mind and 
your understanding of what your project needs. You have to shift from the 
inventor mindset to the investor mindset.
If you haven’t noticed by now, you already are an investor. You’ve invested 
a great deal of time, money, and effort to create “sweat equity,” and you 
probably already own a large part, if not all, of an app that’s hopefully on 
its way to becoming a full-fledged business. So, start treating your app like 
an investor treats a prized asset and give it the attention and planning it 
deserves so it can become a success.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
214
If you are committed to steering your app to success, you don’t need to wait 
until your app is actually a success to change your frame of mind. Do it as soon 
as you can. The benefits will be tremendous for you, your team, and your app.
At this point, your energy is probably focused on preventing failure rather 
than chasing success. You’re most likely trying to keep your app afloat, 
especially in the crucial few weeks after release, and to build up momentum. 
However, success can hit you unexpectedly, and the bottom line is that you 
and your team need to know exactly what needs to be done to best exploit 
the opportunities created by that success.
What a Successful Startup Needs
What does an app startup need in order to have a good chance of success? 
It needs a great idea, a team to turn that idea into a product and a business, 
a market to consume that product, and money to make it all happen. Each 
of these components functions well when it has the right characteristics or 
features, as Figure 14-2 shows.
Figure 14-2.  The four components of a successful startup

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
215
The Idea
The idea is where everything begins, right? However, not all ideas are 
created equal, and even a great idea in your head is of little tangible value if 
others don’t get a chance to qualify it. To do that, an appreneur needs to go 
two steps further: one, to validate the idea, and two, to create what is known 
as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
 Validated Idea – There is a big difference between an 
idea and a validated idea, and that difference can be 
worth millions. For venture capitalists and other people 
who can influence the fate of your app, an idea that 
has not been validated is nothing more than a curiosity, 
because the burden of validation falls on you, and 
presenting an unvalidated idea is unwise.
 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) – According to Eric 
Ries, entrepreneur and author of The Lean Startup, 
a Minimum Viable Product is “the version of a new 
product which allows a team to collect the maximum 
amount of validated learning about customers with 
the least effort.” Another way of describing a Minimum 
Viable Product is “the bundle of features that helps you 
avoid building a product that customers do not want.”
 
An MVP allows you to save time and money by leaving 
out the features of a product that are unrelated to its 
main function while also gauging customer response 
to its core function. If the response is positive, then 
the additional features that were initially left out are 
gradually added with each iteration of the product.
 Protection – Protecting your ideas is expensive but 
necessary. Without it, no investor or venture capitalist will 
take you seriously, because no one wants to put money 
into a product only to see it being copied left and right by 
competitors and be unable to do anything about it.
 
Getting full protection of your idea at the beginning 
is a heavy financial burden if you want to register 
trademarks and copyrights internationally. There are 
other means of protecting your idea that are just as 
important.
 
One method involves asking anyone to whom you 
formally present your project to sign a non-disclosure 
agreement. This is a simple way to stop people from 
sharing your idea with others. One way to prove you 

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
216
were the first to think of an idea is to put everything 
about your app concept in a document, like a PDF 
or Word document, and e-mail it to yourself without 
opening it. Do this before sharing your idea with anyone 
else. That way, no one can claim they thought of your 
app before you did.
 
One counterintuitive way to protect your idea is to go in 
the opposite direction and share your idea formally with 
the world, especially in tech meets or competitions. When 
everyone has seen your idea and associates it with you, 
it’s difficult for anyone to copy it and present it as their 
own. An important advantage of this is that it helps build 
up buzz around the coming release of your app, which 
you are going to do in the development phase anyway.
The Team
The purpose of an app startup’s founding team is to perform the core 
tasks that drive growth and to steer the app to success and an eventual 
exit. For this to happen, the members of the team need to have (or create) 
synergy between themselves and bring the complete set of skills needed to 
implement the core tasks of the business. These are tasks that cannot be 
outsourced at the early stage because of cost or privacy concerns.
When the startup has to scale very rapidly, the relationship between the 
founders will need to evolve to meet the demands of that growth. Let us say, 
for example, that an app startup founding team has three members, one 
of whom is responsible for programming, the second for financial issues, 
and the third for marketing. This is a pretty good combination of skills, by 
the way. Ideally, a founding team should be large enough to combine all the 
skills needed to get a startup going, but small enough to keep the likelihood 
of conflict low and to avoid diluting ownership.
When the startup has to scale rapidly, each of these members will take their 
tasks to the next level, creating a department and hiring new employees. 
To do this, the members will have to make an assessment of the human 
resources they are likely to need in the coming 18 to 24 months to grow 
effectively. Each will have to learn new skills fast so that jobs get done, 
especially managing teams and creating the right accountability hierarchies.
Care must also be taken to gradually establish the right corporate culture, 
one that is consistent with the app’s image and encourages maximum 
employee productivity. The right company culture is also important because 
it’s a key component of a company’s image as a workplace and will help 
draw the new talent the company needs to grow.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
217
The Market
To sustain your app, you will be looking for a market for it. For the app to 
be worth the investment, that market will need to be large enough and still 
be growing. To keep up with your market, you will need a way to know who 
your users are and what they want from you, or, in other words, a feedback 
cycle.
 Market Size – Needless to say, if your app is to have 
any chance of success, it needs a market large enough 
to support it. This does not mean targeting as many 
people as you can without caring who they are. It means 
targeting enough intended users who are willing to pay 
to use your app to make your business sustainable. This 
will help you quickly achieve one of the most important 
milestones in your business—positive cash flow. Having 
1,000 users who pay you $10 each month to use the 
premium version of your app is better than having 
100,000 users who pay you a total of $1,000 a month on 
the ad-supported version. Each of these groups is in a 
different category. You will probably start by advertising 
to a million potential users, out of whom 100,000 will 
download the freemium version and 1,000 will get the 
premium version. The important point here is to get to 
the core group of paying users who can sustain your 
app business.
 Positive Growth – Are you headed in the right 
direction? Are there more paying users downloading 
your app every month than users who are abandoning 
your app? There are a number of metrics that tell you 
whether your app is building up momentum and moving 
in the right direction, like your churn rate, but the most 
important measurement you need to make in terms of 
your market is whether the profitability of your app is 
improving.
 Feedback Cycle – Establishing a feedback cycle with 
your users is fundamental to your relationship with both 
your market and your users. If you give your users the right 
tools, they will tell you almost everything you need to know 
to improve your app and make sure it meets their needs. 
They will tell you what you’re doing right, what you’re 
doing wrong, and what your app is missing. They may use 
your app in unexpected ways (depending on what type of 
app it is) and open up new opportunities for you.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
218
The Money
Money is the most important factor that will decide the future of your 
app startup. How much of it you can get, when you can get it, and how 
you spend it will determine whether your app succeeds or fails. Scaling 
successfully requires that you have access to funding when you need it, 
which means you have to take steps to make sure it’s available before you 
anticipate you will need it. If you start looking for money after the problem 
appears, you are too late, because by the time you get the money to do 
what you want, the opportunity to grow with your user base will be lost.
The best strategy to ensure you have money when you need it is to gather 
pledges. Build your business plan, make forecasts about key milestones for 
your app, and talk to investors who are likely to be interested. Ask them for 
information about how much they would be prepared to invest should your 
app hit a specific growth milestone or benchmark. Have a large-enough 
group of investors ready to make sure your app will have the money it needs 
when it needs it.
Investors will put their money in your app if they see you have a well-
thought-out business plan that shows you understand the key elements that 
drive growth, are committed to steering your project to success, and can 
produce the returns they expect.
Managing Rapid Growth
To successfully scale a startup, you have to be ready for success when it 
happens. As Figure 14-3 shows, you have to scale your company in several 
directions at the same time to accommodate the changes success will bring, 
and you have to be ready for it when it happens.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
219
Scale Effectively: Hardware and Software
If your app is a sudden success, you will need to grow quickly to keep 
up. There are several aspects to this, and one of the most fundamental 
is infrastructure and hardware. You will need bigger servers to handle the 
increased traffic, and you will need a sophisticated backend to manage your 
users and regularly update the content of your app.
Scale Effectively: People & Space
To scale your app effectively, build and manage a new backend, serve 
your users, market your app, and implement all the activities related to 
scaling, you will also need to launch a big recruitment round. You will need 
programmers, UI/UX designers, marketers, accountants, lawyers, and 
managers to manage different departments.
Figure 14-3.  Aspects of app startup scaling

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
220
Develop a corporate hierarchy or matrix of roles that is in alignment with 
your company’s goals.
Make an initial and ongoing assessment of the employees you need. Create 
their job descriptions, position them in the company matrix, and create 
compensation and benefit scales for all your employees.
Develop a recruitment system that will help you find the right people 
fast. You can use job websites, recruitment agencies, social media, your 
company website, and local and international contacts to find and recruit 
the best candidates.
When recruiting, you will have to decide whether to employ people in-house 
or outsource work to remote, contract-based freelancers hired through job 
websites like Upwork. Hiring freelancers can significantly reduce your costs, 
but keep in mind that the distance, time zone difference, and back-and-
forth movement of work between people who are not working face to face 
will have an impact, slowing down your project and your feedback loop and 
perhaps affecting quality as well. In addition, hiring people on a temporary 
basis who have no real commitment to your project may also introduce 
security and intellectual property risks.
Managing cost, speed, quality, and security requires that a balance be found 
between hiring people for in-house positions and using freelancers. In all 
cases, however, it’s good practice to keep your core employees in-house 
and outsource only that part of your project that will be easy to manage 
remotely and will not entail security and IP risks.
Your new team, of course, will also need office space. An office that is 
perfect for your needs should be strategically located but affordable, and 
should be larger than your current needs require so that you will not have 
to relocate again as you expand. It’s wise to plan at least a year ahead in 
terms of your human resources and office space needs and find an office 
accordingly.
Protect Your Brand
A successful app will need a rethink of its image. The app or MVP that you 
originally built is unlikely to have a logo and image that are of the needed 
quality. Thus, you will need to rethink the app’s marketing visuals, including 
the logo, advertising and App Store images and screenshots, website 
design, and video content for promotions. To do this, you can contract a 
professional marketing agency if your budget allows, or, if not, you can hold 
an online competition on a jobs website like Upwork or eLance.

Intellectual Property Protection
Take action to protect your brand. If your concept is worth the investment, 
it needs to be protected in every possible way. That protection will come in 
three forms—copyrights, trademarks, and patents—that apply to different 
types of assets you feel are worth protecting.
 Copyright – Copyright is the way to protect any original 
authored or artistic work. In the case of your app, it 
would protect your app’s content in the form of text, 
images, sounds, icons, and so on.
 Trademark – A trademark protects a company’s logo, 
name, and anything directly related to its identity. 
It prevents competitors from using your company’s 
identity and from using very similar but not identical 
logos and names to benefit from your success.
 Patent – A patent normally applies to devices and 
inventions. If your app involves a new device or 
combination of devices to perform a function, it’s 
wise to patent it to prevent others from copying the 
technology.
Incorporation: When, Where, and Why
Incorporating an app startup is not absolutely necessary for publishing 
apps, because you can do it under an individual’s identity. However, the 
value of incorporating is in formalizing your identity, which is very helpful, if 
not essential, if you plan to raise funds for your startup.
The process of registering a company differs depending on your location 
and country. You may want to register in your own country as a natural 
choice if you plan to expand your business there, but there are numerous 
other alternatives as well. One is to register a company in the U.S .State of 
Delaware.
Registering a company in Delaware through a quick online process is a 
popular option for many tech companies because of the speed and low 
cost of registration and the favorable tax laws. If you are outside the United 
States, the downside of registering in a foreign location consists mainly of 
legal issues and unexpected fees and charges related to operating as a 
foreign company in your own country.
If you are interested in the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region,  
one option is to register a company in one of the Dubai Free Zones in the 
United Arab Emirates, like the Dubai Silicon Oasis or Dubai Internet City.  

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
222
In this case as well, there are advantages, like no taxes, 100 percent 
ownership (which does not apply outside the free zones in the UAE), and 
direct access to markets and human resources.
Incorporate Early: The Advantages
Incorporating your startup early has a number of advantages, one of which 
is that it clarifies ownership—who owns how much of the company, and who 
is just an employee.
Ownership
If your company suddenly becomes a success and you have to look at 
incorporating it, there is a risk that everyone who has ever worked there for a 
short time or even delivered fast food once or twice will feel they are entitled 
to a percentage of the company, and there will be little you can do to avoid 
the legal nightmare.
Stock Value and Profit
A second advantage is that as a founder or co-founder you will own stock 
in your company. Early on, it is very easy to set a very low nominal price to 
buy the stock as opposed to much later, when the product has registered 
its intellectual property and has a large number of users. The value of the 
company’s stock at a later point will be much higher and not nominal. This 
also means the profit potential of incorporating a startup is highest for the 
founders the earlier it is done.
Financing
Incorporating early is also advantageous if you plan to finance growth 
through venture capital, loans, or other forms of external financing later 
on. A startup that has corporate status will attract funds much more easily 
than would a motley group of developers who plan to incorporate after they 
secure financing.
An important point here is to know which types of companies are allowed 
in your country and which are most attractive to investors. Limited Liability 
Companies (LLCs), for example, are known to be unattractive for investors 
in the United States for a number of reasons related to laws that regulate 
their financing and operation. For example, they are known as pass-through 
entities, which means they do not pay income tax. Instead, the owners of an 
LLC pay income tax depending on their share of the company’s profits.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
223
Intellectual Property
Incorporating early allows startups to maintain a maximum degree of control 
over all the intellectual property related to their app, as all assets will have 
been developed after incorporation by employees or outside contractors 
who cannot claim ownership over any of these assets.
Protection for the Founders
Incorporating allows the founders of a startup to protect themselves from 
any personal liability with regard to their project, as all legal and financial 
liability toward creditors will belong to the company.
Scaling Well: Tips on What to Do
The following sections provide some insight into how to build a successful 
app project.
Keep Users Happy
Probably the worst thing that can happen to an app startup that meets 
with unexpected success is to have thousands upon thousands of people 
download the app, but then see users abandon the app in growing numbers 
because of dissatisfaction with the product or user support. Users might 
complain about crashes or glitches in the design of the app but realize they 
are being ignored and abandon the app.
This kind of situation is even worse than not attracting any users at all, and 
to avoid it you need to build a system to cater to your users, use them for 
valuable feedback about how to improve the app, and get them to leave 
positive reviews of your app on the app stores, your website, or on social 
media and forums.
In short, without users you have nothing, so make them happy and keep 
them happy. Build a strong relationship with your users, responding to their 
complaints and encouraging them to share their reaction to your app. They 
are your free marketers, and their word goes a long way.
Monitor negative reviews. They will tell you a lot about where your weak 
points are. Respond fast and fix what needs fixing quickly. Make it easy for 
your users to reach you with their complaints, and make them feel you are 
listening. Be prepared to listen to them, incorporate their feedback into your 
iteration process, and release the new version of your app quickly.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
224
Market Effectively
Building on the success of your app requires a whole new level of thinking 
about positioning your app as a product and marketing it. The early 
success of your app will attract a lot of attention your way, and your task 
in this situation is not to stand out (you’ve already done that), but rather to 
establish your product in the market and in the minds of your users, building 
the critical mass to become stratospheric.
To do this, your marketing strategy will pursue three goals: getting more 
users, keeping your existing users, and getting your existing users to bring 
in more users. Each of these goals requires a different strategy with different 
approaches, message content, and CTAs (calls to action).
Build Knowledge Pipelines
Your startup’s marketing and product-design efforts will only be as good as 
the information that supports them. To get the information you need, you 
will have to build knowledge pipelines that supply you with data to help 
you monitor and understand your users’ behavior and design products that 
match their expectations. Otherwise, everything you do will miss its target 
and will be a waste of time and money.
Use analytics everywhere you can to monitor your users and gather 
information about them—their patterns, preferences, and habits. Use 
this knowledge to segment your user base in different ways, then design 
marketing campaigns tailored to them.
As your startup scales into a larger company, your knowledge pipelines will 
become more and more elaborate. The more automation you introduce into 
this process of gathering and analysis, the more efficient and affordable it 
will be. You will need to develop internal knowledge pipelines as well, like 
performance dashboards, to keep the company running efficiently as it grows.
Having information about your company and your users is also crucial when 
you have to attract investment. Much will depend on performance metrics, 
including the valuation of your company by investors or venture capitalists 
interested in betting their money on you. Therefore, the more accurate and 
rich the data is, the better the accuracy and quality of the conclusions drawn 
from it will be.
Keep the Money Flowing
Creating and maintaining a stable flow of financing will allow you to scale 
your startup at the necessary pace to achieve your goals. As we saw earlier 
in this chapter, building that flow needs to begin before you scale, not after, 

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
225
or scaling will deflate and collapse at the worst possible time. As you scale 
your startup, update your business plan regularly using the data you have, 
and have that business plan ready for presentation at any moment.
Upgrade Your Technical Infrastructure
A fast-growing app will need more and more computing power and storage 
space to handle its fast-growing customer base, and you have to make sure 
the infrastructure you are using can be expanded to keep up. Stay ahead of 
the curve in terms of what you expect to need so that you will have time to 
switch service providers or relocate if you need to do so.
Build a Bigger Team
Another fast-growing aspect of a successful app project is the size of your 
team. Rapidly growing a company to keep up with success is no easy task, 
as finding and attracting a talented team will not only take time, but will also 
be costly. It also requires that you accurately forecast your human resources 
needs. How many designers will you need to create graphics, digital 
products, and game levels? How many programmers will you need to add 
to your team, and when will you need them? Too few will keep you lagging 
behind your audience, and too many will eat up your finances, so accurate 
forecasting is key here.
Design the Next Version of Your App
Research suggests that apps that are updated frequently do better in the 
apps stores than apps that are not. The first version of the app you publish 
is unlikely to be perfect, nor is it likely to be the last version you publish. 
Why is this so?
First, despite all the pre-release testing, your app is bound to run into a 
glitch or two after release.
Second, your users could use the app in unexpected ways, or like or dislike 
a very specific part of the app or something specific that it does. This will 
suggest to you that there are aspects of your app that are worth keeping 
and parts that you need to remove to make your app leaner and more 
attractive.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
226
How will you know which parts of your app should stay and which should 
go? The design of the update will be affected by information from a number 
of sources:
 Your own analysis
 User feedback in the form of reviews, ratings, and e-mail
 Crash reports, which tell you at which point in the app 
there may be a coding problem that is causing the app 
to crash
 Analytics about user behavior, which will tell you if there 
are “pages” in your app, or parts of it, that users like 
and spend a lot of time on, or parts that they do not like 
and are largely ignoring.
All this information, when combined, will tell you a great deal about how to 
design the next version of your app. In general, the more information you 
gather, especially about what your users like or dislike, the more informed 
and effective your next design iteration will be.
What Next?
Your app is doing well. What do you do next?
Capitalize on a Skill
By the time you’ve released an app and monitored its progress for a few 
months, you’ve likely picked up some new skills you did not have a few 
months ago. In fact, if you’ve applied the advice in this book, you’ve 
become quite an expert on one or two aspects of app publishing. One way 
to grow in the app industry is to capitalize on one of the skills in which you 
excel and build a business around it. Maybe you have become adept at app 
marketing or have discovered you’re an app design genius!
Coding, app design, UI/UX design, ASO (App Store Optimization), app 
marketing, and analytics are all fast-growing industries in their own right, 
and experts in these fields are always in demand.
Sell Your App
This is probably the quickest possible exit from an app project if you decide 
your app is not as successful as you’d hoped and you want to move on to other 
things. Should you opt to sell your app, there are online exchanges where you 
can buy or sell apps and games, like chupamobile.com and flippa.com.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
227
Launch a Startup
This is the way to go if your app is a surprise hit and you choose to 
capitalize on its success. You will need to grow fast to keep up with 
your growing number of users—hiring new employees, investing in new 
technology, and planning the next version of your app. To do all this, you 
will need infusions of cash. To get that cash, you will need to build a strong 
team, write a well-thought-out business plan, and create a legal entity that 
will grow into a business that revolves around your app.
Exit Strategies
An exit does not necessarily mean the original team of founders has to 
leave. Many stay on after the exit to manage what has become a full-fledged 
company. It simply means the way a startup’s investor will get the return on 
their original investment.
A well-thought-out exit strategy is something that you have to present to 
investors and venture capitalists before they even invest in your startup, 
rather than something you figure out after your app startup succeeds.
The exit is a major milestone in your app’s journey. It is the defining event for 
your app, the culmination of all the effort you have put in from the moment 
the idea was born.
The four most likely types of successful exits are a merger, an IPO (Initial 
Public Offering), a buyout, and a cash cow.
Let’s look at each of them in detail.
Merger
A merger is a combination of two companies whereby one company is fully 
absorbed by another. The two companies in the merger may see each other 
as equals, in which case the merger is friendly, or one side in the merger 
may be aggressively trying to merge with the other, in which case the event 
is known as an acquisition, or in some cases a hostile takeover.
The main reasons why two companies might merge are to increase market 
share, eliminate competition, and achieve economies of scale.
IPO
An IPO, or Initial Public Offering, is the sale of a percentage of a company’s 
shares on a securities exchange, whereby the company is known to go from 
private to public.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
228
Buyout
A buyout is the process by which the majority of shares or ownership equity 
in a company is acquired by another company or an individual. In effect, the 
acquirer “buys out” the company’s current owners. A buyout also involves 
the purchase of the target company’s outstanding debt.
The main reasons for a buyout are 1) profit through the sale of the target 
company’s assets; 2) entry into new markets; 3) acquiring a new customer 
base; and 4) eliminating competition.
Cash Cow
A cash cow is a company that has simply become highly profitable, 
producing significant revenue from its activities. The owners decide to keep 
the company as it is, protect it from aggressive takeovers, and refuse to 
surrender ownership in a merger, buyout, or IPO.
App Industry Trends
Things change quickly and all the time in the app world. App design, 
marketing, and distribution are all affected by trends that are set off by 
user behavior and preferences, new regulations set by app stores, and the 
capabilities of new devices built by smartphone and tablet manufacturers.
Breaking Down the Man–Machine Barrier Further
AI (Artificial Intelligence), machine learning, big data, and growing 
interconnectivity are helping devices respond better to user requests and giving 
users a higher-quality experience. Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana are early 
examples of this, and the coming advent of bots will push this trend further.
Greater Device Capability
The ever-increasing capabilities of devices are placing more and more power 
in the hands of designers, who are investing in subtle and sophisticated 
interactions. Such increased capability also allows advertisers to use ad 
types like video ads in the hope of improving user engagement.
New Tricks to Keep Users Engaged
App designers are constantly coming up with new ways to keep users 
engaged with an app and prevent them from abandoning it. One of the most 

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
229
talked about trends for 2017 is called hapnotic feedback, which combines 
the words “haptic” and “hypnotic.” Haptic technology simulates the sense 
of touch in user interaction. Hapnotic feedback involves using subtle haptic 
cues to point users to the desired action, like a pulsing button to direct a 
user to a desired activity, or a pleasant texture or image to prevent a user 
from abandoning an app.
Improving the User Experience
Sometimes, users do not engage with a product the way they are expected 
to. Failure mapping is an aspect of UX design that involves mapping 
non-ideal scenarios that show the unanticipated ways in which users have 
interacted or could interact with apps, allowing these designers to better 
manage unpredictable usage patterns and improve user experience. Another 
user experience trend is known as user offboarding—improving the user 
experience after the desired actions have been completed, when the user 
has completed their interaction with the app, or wants to abandon or delete 
the app. Good user offboarding practices include letting users know whether 
or not their personal data will be kept after they delete your app, and asking 
them to tell you why they are deleting it.
More Personalization
A new trend in personalization is age-responsive design, which involves 
segmenting users by age and providing different user experiences for each 
segment for the same product.
Availability of New Technologies
The advent of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) is creating 
a new market for AR and VR apps and video advertising. Video is a fast-
growing advertising medium supported by growing device capabilities 
and increased available bandwidth. According to the Digital Marketing 
Association, wearables is also a medium that is growing fast, with at least 
one in four Americans expected to carry a wearable by the end of 2016, thus 
creating a new channel for advertisers to target.
Big Data
Extensive knowledge about user habits and preferences is supporting the 
greater personalization of ads and content based on location and age, 
as well as leading to more predictive advertising based on what a user is 
likely to do in a given situation or at a given location.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
230
Power to the User
Ad blocking allows users to disable advertising on their mobile device, and 
as a result it is forcing advertisers to find less-intrusive ways to reach app 
users.
Buy Now
The integration of e-commerce and social media, like the Buy Now 
Facebook button, allows users to buy directly through social media without 
visiting an e-commerce website.
New Types of Apps
As the advent of the Internet of Things, or IoT, continues, millions of new 
apps designed to help users interact with various devices will flood the app 
stores. Partly encouraged by IoT and the integration of sensors and other 
devices into the Internet, the use of apps is also spreading to industries that 
have so far been slow to adopt them, like the construction and agriculture 
sectors.
The Future of Apps
Apps are about empowerment. Each of us now has the power of a 
supercomputer in our palm, combined with access to colossal amounts of 
data, to entertain us, keep us informed, and support our decisions.
Apps allow us to do things no one would have thought possible just a few 
years ago. Every day, app creators are coming up with new things we can 
do and new and better ways we can do what we’ve always done.
What about future trends? Apps today are currently evolving from entities 
running in the foreground to services running in the background, analyzing 
the user’s history and making predictions about where they will be and what 
they will do. This is made possible by the evolutionary leap created by apps.
The Evolutionary Leap Created by Apps: Big Data
The very first games that were made available on smartphones were Snake, 
Pong, Tetris, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Each was in monochrome and was a few 
kilobytes in size. Snake first appeared on the Nokia 6110 in 1997. Today’s 
apps are a world away from these now archaic apps, but the differences are 
not just about size, color, resolution, or engagement capability; the biggest 

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
231
technological leap that apps and games have made is the way they generate 
colossal amounts of information about their users. Apps and games have 
gone from programs that perform a function to programs that watch 
everything you do and generate big data, which is used by developers and 
marketers to create better products and market them more effectively by 
personalizing them for their users, making these products an integral part of 
their user’s lives.
Where is the app revolution headed? Is the app bonanza dead?
App industry trends suggest the app revolution is indeed slowing down and 
that it’s time to think about the next big thing. Why is this so? It’s because 
smartphone shipments and smartphone use growth are slowing down, and 
because app users are simply not downloading that many apps anymore.
It is true that the opportunities to make a big hit in the app stores have 
shrunk. All this, however, is not a sign that the app boom is dead, but rather 
is a sign that the industry is maturing and the capabilities of apps and what 
you can do with them, which were once a magical curiosity, have now 
become familiar. It’s much more difficult these days to impress people with 
something that hasn’t already been done.
The app industry, however, is not going to disappear, just like the Internet, 
which was a wonder in its infancy, has also not disappeared. All these waves 
of new technologies that spring up once every few years are simply layers of 
the technological revolution we are currently going through, the foundation 
of the society of the future. The new layers of that revolution, like robotics, 
the Internet of Things, drones, and 3D printing, will open up new frontiers for 
tech-savvy designers and inventors, who will come up with new ideas for 
how these technologies can be applied to making our lives better.
Apps are just software, and nothing can be done without software. Software 
used to come in the form of a program you would download or buy. Now, 
it’s in your hand. Tomorrow, it may be accessible in a different form through 
hardware other than a smartphone. It’s only the form of the hardware and 
the form of the software that are changing to serve users’ needs better, but 
the opportunities never dwindle.
The revolution is only just beginning, and there will be no lack of opportunity 
to change the world and become obscenely successful and rich in the 
process.
So, what are the key directions in which apps are evolving now? In which 
direction are we headed?

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
232
More Empowerment
As much as apps have helped us do what we could not do before, they 
will help us do much more in the future. This wave of empowerment will be 
further supported as more and more devices, like household appliances, 
cars, and homes, become accessible via the web and through apps.
Who would have thought a few years ago that technology would put very 
powerful software programs and machines (like robots and 3D printers) at 
our disposal, allowing us to control them through apps?
Personalization
Supported by the constant supply of information provided by analytics 
about your location, preferences, habits, and responses to different kinds of 
content and ads, apps will increasingly tailor their content, notifications, and 
even design and color to you.
The Nature of the App
According to some, the very nature of apps is changing, from an app as a 
program sitting behind an icon on your screen to a system that is constantly 
operating in the background, bringing you the information you need in the 
form of notifications, to which you can respond by issuing commands.
This means that apps no longer offer a browsing experience, but rather 
talk to the user only when necessary, using sensors and user-generated 
data like history of use to make forecasts and communicate accordingly. A 
user would not launch an app every time they need it, instead downloading 
and running it just once. The app would then combine a set of automated 
functions to run in the background and deliver the desired content to the 
user at regular intervals. In this context, the purpose of apps will change 
from performing tasks on request to providing services in the background.
Single All-Platform Apps
Apps are headed toward a single design for all platforms for desktop, mobile 
web, iOS, Android, and any other online platform or device at the same time.
The Influence of AI
AI is a fast-evolving sector that is improving every aspect of computing and 
user–computer interaction. More than wowing users with human-like robot 
behavior, AI is being used to improve the quality of services and content 
supplied to consumers through apps.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
233
According to an article in TechCrunch, “rather than introducing a layer of AI 
to help users make use of a given app, these AI programs are operating in 
the background, making the apps better.”
Bots
Bots are intelligent bits of software that function from inside bigger 
programs, helping you solve problems and get what you want. Bots are 
a new trend that some say could potentially spell the end of many types 
of apps, replacing them with text-based services, booking airline tickets, 
making restaurant reservations, or reserving hotel rooms for you through 
chat. Will bots replace apps, or, as some say, will apps “be replaced only by 
better apps”? Time will tell.
Deep Linking
Deep linking involves building closer and closer links between apps and 
blurring the gap between mobile apps and web apps.
Deep linking is designed to merge the lightweight and browsable nature of 
the web with the high user engagement and personalization of mobile apps, 
while eliminating problems like very low app discoverability for the vast 
majority of apps on app stores.
Ubiquity and the Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IOT) is a vision of the Internet in which everything 
in the environment is connected to and communicating with everything 
else, including devices (like cars, home appliances, smartphones, and 
computers), materials (like “smart” or “self-healing” concrete), and spaces 
(like our homes and offices). Some 26 billion devices are expected to be 
connected to each other through the IoT by 2020.
The Internet of Things requires an exponential growth in the amount of 
accessible information, and that information is generated by equipping 
devices, materials, and the environment with sensors that constantly 
measure numerous parameters and supply the information to analytics 
programs that derive useful conclusions from the data.
Our own interaction with these programs will be through apps, and these 
apps will give us access to and control over a vast new array of parameters 
in our environment. Armed with new knowledge and awareness capabilities, 
apps will also allow us to automate many aspects of our environment and 
our daily rituals, such as automating our grocery shopping or monitoring our 
health.

CHAPTER 14: Prepare for Success
234
We can easily conclude from the factors mentioned earlier that the industry is 
looking at very strong growth and multiple directions of evolution. Developers 
who are capable of imagining new things that can be done by merging new 
technologies with the capabilities of apps will be the most successful.
Closing Thoughts
The advent of new technologies is continuing at an ever-increasing pace, 
and it’s now clear for even the completely uninitiated that the world is riding 
a wave of innovation that will transform every aspect of our lives, for better 
or for worse. The robot revolution that’s just round the corner will wipe out 
many jobs, but will also open up possibilities we cannot even imagine today. 
The power technology gives us to monitor, understand, and transform our 
environment is tremendous and is inspiring the boldest among us to dream 
up things that were inconceivable just a short while ago.
Apps are nothing more than programs, just like the programs we were used 
to before apps came along. What makes them magical is their ability to 
put so much computing power, communication capability, and access to 
information in the palm of our hand through another technological “marvel,” 
the smartphone, which more than two billion people currently carry around 
with them everywhere they go.
Summary
The app industry is a young and fast-evolving piece of a much bigger 
revolution in information technology and computing. Its future is closely 
tied to all the other pieces of that revolution, like robotics and AI, which are 
creating new potential and possibilities on a literally daily basis. Developers 
searching for the next phase in the evolution of the app industry need to 
keep up with the momentum of this revolution in order to predict what these 
new technologies will help us achieve next and be among the first to explore 
new frontiers as they emerge.
What’s next? As we discussed earlier, current trends point to the next wave 
that will be built on this one, but it is safe to say that much of what is to 
come hasn’t even been imagined yet.
Apps and smartphones have not just put tremendous capabilities into your 
hands; they have made it possible for you to be a part of the revolution they 
are bringing about, and that was the main reason why I wrote this book. 
Technology is more accessible to the uninitiated today than it has ever been, 
and it’s inviting you to be a part of it every time to look at your smartphone 
screen. The purpose behind this book was to give you, the reader, every 
reason to dive into the world of technology and app publishing and to 
eliminate any reason that could hold you back. I trust I have succeeded.
