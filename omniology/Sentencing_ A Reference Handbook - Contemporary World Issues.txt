Preface
S
entencing: A Reference Handbook examines the sentencing
process in detail. Chapter 1 defines sentencing and its goals.
Sentencing is the application of one or more punishments/
sanctions following a criminal conviction. These punishments in-
clude fines and/or incarceration, or placement under the super-
vision of probation officers. The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984
restated a number of sentencing objectives that have guided sen-
tencing judges in their leniency or harshness toward convicted
defendants. Some of those objectives have been made explicit by
various states and local jurisdictions in past years, while others
have been implicitly incorporated into prevailing sentencing
guidelines. Some of the more important functions and goals of
sentencing are (1) to promote respect for the law, (2) to reflect the
seriousness of the offense, (3) to provide just punishment for the
offense, (4) to deter the defendant from future criminal conduct,
(5) to protect the public from the convicted offender, and (6) to
provide the convicted defendant with education and/or voca-
tional training or other rehabilitative relief. The purposes of sen-
tencing include punishment or retribution, deterrence, custodial
monitoring or incapacitation, and rehabilitation. Four different
types of sentencing schemes will be described: indeterminate, de-
terminate, presumptive or guidelines-based, and mandatory. The
differences between state and federal sentencing policies will be
examined. A history of sentencing in the United States is pre-
sented as well.
Accused persons have established, constitutional rights
under the law, which are examined here. The sentencing process
often involves a formal sentencing hearing in which both con-
victed offenders and victims have the opportunity to influence
the sentencing decision. This process is examined in detail. Both
xi

xii
Preface
victim and offender input are crucial during sentencing hearings.
Convicted offenders may choose to accept responsibility for their
actions and thus attempt to minimize their sentences, while vic-
tims can explain to the court how their lives have been harmed
by the offender’s actions, in an effort to enhance punishment.
Judges must weigh these factors and give them proper acknowl-
edgment. Consideration is given to both aggravating and miti-
gating circumstances to enhance or minimize the punishments
contemplated by judges when imposing sentences. Once sen-
tences have been imposed, however, they may be appealed. Thus
the appeals process is examined. Both legal and extralegal factors
emerge as key considerations in the sentencing process. Some
critics of the U.S. sentencing system say that it is racist and de-
prives certain persons of their full entitlement to legal rights ac-
cording to socioeconomic factors. These factors will be discussed.
Chapter 2 is a discussion of some of the problems, contro-
versies, and solutions to sentencing problems. Judicial decision-
making about the types of sentences to be imposed is not always
clear-cut. Every trial is different from the next, and sentencing of-
fenders is not as easy as it appears at first glance. Sentencing is a
major concern for those advocating justice reforms. The federal
government and most states have passed new sentencing legisla-
tion in response to criticisms that present sentencing practices are
discriminatory according to gender, race or ethnic background,
and socioeconomic status. Over the years citizen discontent with
existing sentencing laws and particular sensationalized crimes
have caused state and federal legislators to change sentencing
laws. It is believed that such changes will correct existing legal
defects associated with sentencing practices and create a sen-
tencing pattern based more upon just deserts. Thus proportion-
ality of sentencing is a desired long-term objective of most
sentencing schemes. Those who commit more serious offenses
should receive harsher sentences.
But what is ideally visualized as the right sentencing sce-
nario seldom materializes. There are continuing and pervasive
problems with all sentencing schemes in virtually all jurisdic-
tions. Many persons are wrongfully convicted, and many are
overpenalized. Some guilty persons escape punishment. Al-
though the exact figures of how many such persons pass through
the legal system annually are unknown, there are sufficient doc-
umented occurrences of these cases that serious questions con-

Preface
xiii
tinue to be raised about our existing sentencing laws and the ad-
equacy of our legal system.
Several key issues relating to sentencing policies at the state
and federal levels will be examined. Should convicted persons
receive probation or incarceration? Jail and prison overcrowding
exists at unprecedented levels, and overcrowding problems are
increasing rather than diminishing. It is strategically impossible
to lock up everyone, and thus, some attention needs to be given
to which offenders deserve incarceration the most. That is where
selective incapacitation has been proposed. But the matter of
false positives and false negatives arises. Some persons are pre-
dicted to be dangerous but in fact will not be dangerous if re-
leased to probation. Other offenders are predicted not to be
dangerous, but once they are released on probation they commit
heinous crimes or harm others. Clearly our prediction schemes
are imperfect and are in need of revision and improvement.
The public blames judges and parole boards for abuses of
discretion and faulty decision-making. But there are pressures
upon these key figures and boards to minimize or abbreviate in-
carceration. Furthermore, offenders believe that they are entitled
to some type of rehabilitation so that they may eventually be able
to reintegrate themselves back into society. To what extent are jails
and prisons providing effective rehabilitation and treatment for
such persons? Only about 20 percent of all inmates in U.S. prisons
and jails have vocational and educational opportunities. Contrary
to popular belief, most prisoners do not perform prison labor.
Thus many of these offenders are simply warehoused without
any meaningful rehabilitation or improvement occurring. Recidi-
vism and program effectiveness are closely intertwined, therefore,
and various issues related to recidivism rates will be considered.
Chapter 3 examines the sentencing systems in fifteen other
countries. This international perspective exposes many of the
similarities and differences among the many industrialized coun-
tries of the world. While this chapter is not comprehensive, it is
nevertheless representative of the sentencing schemes of most
other world countries. It provides readers with a clearer idea of
how the U.S. sentencing system and justice process work and
how it compares with justice schemes used by other countries in
punishing their criminals.
Chapter 4 is a chronology of key events in U.S. sentencing
history. It is worth noting that many sentencing schemes have

been appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where their constitu-
tionality has been questioned. Each era of a U.S. Supreme Court
is frequently cited by a reference to the presiding chief justice,
such as the “Warren Court” or the “Burger Court.” Particular
landmark cases in sentencing issues are often defined by the jus-
tices who decide these cases, either for or against defendants.
Chapter 5 presents biographical sketches of key persons who
have influenced the sentencing process in the United States. Some
of these key figures are from Ireland and England, inasmuch as
their innovations were presented at an international conference in
Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1870 at the first meeting of the National
Prison Association, which later became the widely known Amer-
ican Correctional Association; in 2006 it had a membership in ex-
cess of 33,000. These key figures, who have shaped our sentencing
schemes over time, also include various chief justices of the U.S.
Supreme Court, where final decisions about the constitutionality
of various sentencing practices have been determined.
Chapter 6 is an examination of facts and data pertaining to
sentenced persons in the United States. Profiles of those presently
sentenced in U.S. prisons and jails are described. What are their
ethnic/racial and gender characteristics? What types of crimes
have they committed? Offenders on probation and parole are also
profiled. These profiles give readers a good idea of the types of
persons who are among us in our neighborhoods and cities. In ad-
dition, average sentence lengths give us an appreciation for how
much justice is employed in the punishment process. State and
federal sentencing patterns are compared, and sentencing trends
are examined and discussed. This chapter also identifies and
briefs approximately thirty leading U.S. Supreme Court cases per-
taining to sentencing, including the constitutionality of the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines, sex offender sentencing laws, reconvic-
tions and resentencing, acceptance of responsibility during sen-
tencing hearings, and the presentation of aggravating and
mitigating circumstances that weigh heavily in sentencing deci-
sions by judges. These cases are presented chronologically and
contain precise citations so that students may locate complete
cases in legal volumes for further reading and study.
Chapter 7 is an annotated directory of organizations, associa-
tions, and agencies that relate to the sentencing process. Every at-
tempt has been made to include relevant organizations that have a
vested interest in sentencing, both from the prosecution side and
the defense perspective. All indigent defendants are entitled to rep-

resentation by competent counsel. Therefore organizations such as
public defender agencies are presented. Based on our previous ex-
amination of world sentencing schemes, the United Nations has
become involved in U.S. sentencing issues repeatedly, especially
in issues relating to the death penalty and its administration.
Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union
have also been involved in a concerted effort to ensure and protect
the rights of both accused and convicted persons
Chapter 8 lists both print and nonprint resources pertaining
to sentencing. These include bibliographical materials dealing
with various sentencing issues and problems, annotated print re-
sources pertaining to factual sentencing information, and non-
print resources such as films and documentaries that would
enhance our understanding of the sentencing process.
Finally, a glossary of key terms used in sentencing offenders
is presented. Terms used in the sentencing process are clearly de-
fined. The glossary is reasonably comprehensive, although more
extensive compendiums of terms exist and are cited for further
student reading.

Background and History
Introduction
Judicial decision-making about the types of sentences to impose
is not always a clear-cut matter. Every trial is different from every
other, and the sentencing of offenders is not as easy as it appears
at first glance. This chapter defines sentencing and describes the
sentencing process. Sentencing is a major concern of those who
advocate for judicial reform. The federal government and most
states have passed new sentencing legislation in response to crit-
icisms that present sentencing practices are discriminatory ac-
cording to gender, race, or ethnic background, or according to
socioeconomic status (Delone and Wilmot 2004). Four different
types of sentencing schemes will be described: indeterminate, de-
terminate, presumptive or guidelines-based, and mandatory. A
brief history of sentencing in the United States is also presented.
Most major felony cases and some minor misdemeanor
cases require probation officers to prepare presentence investiga-
tion reports (PSIs) about convicted offenders who are about to be
sentenced. Such reports include information about the offender,
the nature of the crime(s), the offender’s employment history and
prior criminal record (if any), the offender’s family, the of-
fender’s educational background, and a statement from victims
about how they were affected by the offender’s actions. That in-
formation is eventually delivered to judges in a succinct report
that is useful in determining the most appropriate sentence.
An important part of the sentencing process is the sentenc-
ing hearing, which is the opportunity for judges to weigh any ag-
gravating or mitigating circumstances that might influence the
1

severity of the sentence. Both the offender and the offender’s
supporters speak out in his or her behalf, and victims also con-
tribute information about how they were affected. After hearing
from those parties, the judge pronounces the sentence prescribed
by law. Sentencing options available to judges differ among ju-
risdictions. At the judge’s discretion, in most cases, sentences
may involve either probation with conditions or incarceration in
a prison or a jail for a period of months or years, or both.
Sentencing Defined
Sentencing is the imposition of a punishment on an offender fol-
lowing conviction for a criminal offense. Judges impose sentences,
which may involve incarceration in a prison or jail, or they may in-
volve placement in community corrections facilities. Those allowed
to remain free in the community are called probationers (Beyer,
Grisso, and Young 1997). The U.S. district courts and state criminal
courts vary in the amount of probation used. Approximately 70
percent of all sentenced offenders nationally are placed on proba-
tion. Federal probationers are supervised by the U.S. Probation Of-
fice, while state probationers are supervised by state probation
officers, who often work out of county probation offices. There are
many types of sentencing schemes, which are described below.
Goals of Sentencing
Some of the more important goals of sentencing are the follow-
ing: (1) to promote respect for the law, (2) to reflect the serious-
ness of the offense, (3) to provide just punishment for the offense,
(4) to deter the defendant from future criminal conduct, (5) to
protect the public from the convicted offender, and (6) to provide
the convicted offender with educational or vocational training, or
other rehabilitative assistance. The purposes of sentencing in-
clude punishment or retribution, deterrence, custodial monitor-
ing or incapacitation, and rehabilitation.
Promote Respect for the Law
When offenders are sentenced, judges send a message to the
criminal community. If the sentence is too lenient, the message is
2
Background and History

that offenders will not be punished harshly. Many offenders may
therefore engage in further criminal conduct, believing that even
if they are subsequently apprehended the punishment will be
mild. Judges attempt to promote respect for the law by imposing
appropriate sentences that are proportional to the crime(s) com-
mitted. Their intended message is that if the law is violated, vio-
lators will be sanctioned. Ideally, such a view promotes respect
for the law and functions as a deterrent to would-be criminals
(Weidner, Frase, and Pardoe 2004).
Reflect the Seriousness of the Offense
One objective of sentencing is to match the sentence with the se-
riousness of the offense. More serious crimes deserve harsher
punishments. Violent criminals are usually punished more se-
verely than property offenders, because violent crimes often re-
sult in serious bodily injury or death. Property can be replaced,
whereas life cannot. Thus punishments should be proportional to
the seriousness of the crime.
Provide Just Punishment for the Offense
Sentencing policies in most jurisdictions in the United States
have shifted in recent years to reflect the justice model, which is
a legitimization of the power of the state to administer sanctions.
The justice model emphasizes punishment as a primary objective
of sentencing, the abolition of parole, the abandonment of the re-
habilitative ideal, and determinate sentencing (Aas 2004).
Deter the Defendant from 
Future Criminal Conduct
Not only is sentencing designed as a punishment fitting to the
crime, but it is also designed to function as a deterrent to future
criminal activity. At least two major provisions have been de-
signed to equate offense seriousness with the harshness of the
penalty. One is esclated santions. As offenders reoffend, their
penalties or sentence lengths increase, even if the same offenses
are repeated in later, separate crimes. The most significant legisla-
tion has been the establishment of habitual offender or repeat of-
fender laws, whereby those convicted of three or more felonies
Goals of Sentencing
3

are sentenced to life imprisonment. California has a “Three
Strikes and You’re Out!” law, enacted in 1994, under which repeat
offenders are sentenced to life without parole. That get-tough ac-
tion was designed to deter violent recidivists, such as robbers and
murderers. The thinking was that if repeat violent offenders have
not learned their lesson by the time they are convicted of their
third violent offense, they should be locked up permanently
(Bruce et al. 1928).
Protect the Public from 
the Convicted Offender
Incarcerating convicted offenders is the most direct way of pro-
tecting the public from them. If they are locked up, they cannot
commit crimes against fellow citizens. Longer sentences generally
mean longer periods during which criminals cannot victimize so-
ciety. Some persons believe that all criminals should be locked up
for some period of time, in order to insulate a vulnerable public
from their criminal activities (Ulmer and Johnson 2004).
Provide the Convicted Offender with
Educational or Vocational Training, or 
Other Rehabilitative Assistance
This is the rehabilitative function of sentencing. Rehabilitation has
always been a fundamental goal of sentencing. Aprevailing belief is
that some attempt should be made to reform criminals while they
are incarcerated. We should not merely warehouse offenders;
rather, educational and vocational programs should be offered to
help those who are interested in helping themselves. It is better to
provide some services for those who will use them than to withhold
rehabilitative services because of those who will not (Klug 2001).
Purposes of Sentencing
The purposes of sentencing are: (1) retribution, (2) deterrence and
prevention, (3) just deserts and justice, (4) incapacitation and
control, and (5) rehabilitation and reintegration.
4
Background and History

Retribution
Any sentence imposed for a criminal offense is designed to exact
retribution for crimes committed. Perpetrators must be punished
in some way in order to comply with criminal law. Punishments
include jail or prison time, fines, or both. Proportionality is sought
so that the greater the offense, the greater the punishment.
Deterrence and Prevention
When offenders see other offenders punished for their crimes
and given harsh sentences, an element of deterrence is intro-
duced wherein potential criminals are deterred from committing
crimes because of the penalties they may suffer if caught. To
some extent, at least, some crime is prevented and some crimi-
nals are deterred because of the sentences that others receive. If
potential offenders refrain from committing crimes because of
the painfulness of prospective punishments, then some deter-
rence and prevention has been accomplished.
Just Desserts and Justice
The judiciary attempt to match sentences imposed to the nature
and seriousness of conviction offenses. Citizens are satisfied
whenever criminals are punished in ways that equate with the
seriousness of their crime. The public is dissatisfied whenever
criminals receive lenient sentences that do not seem justified in
view of the crime. Prosecutors seek penalties that satisfy the law,
both technically and morally.
Incapacitation and Control
Whether criminals are sexual predators, embezzlers, murderers,
or petty thieves, citizens wish to be protected from them. Thus,
placing criminals in some type of confinement facility such as a
jail or prison effectively removes them from society. But, because
of chronic jail and prison overcrowding, not all convicted of-
fenders can be incarcerated. Therefore alternative methods, such
as probation, are used to supervise and control these criminals.
Probation is a sentence in lieu of incarceration. For particularly
low-risk offenders, probation permits offenders to remain in their
Purposes of Sentencing
5

communities, hold jobs, and support their families. They are su-
pervised by probation officers and must comply with various
program conditions. For offenders already serving prison terms,
their terms of incarceration may be abbreviated through the use
of parole. Parole is similar to probation in that parolees are su-
pervised by parole officers and must comply with various pro-
gram conditions for a fixed period of time.
Rehabilitation and Reintegration
Corrections programs are supposed to correct the behavior of of-
fenders and make them into law-abiding citizens, respectful of the
rights of others. However, two-thirds or more of all convicted of-
fenders commit new offenses. The offending rate varies according
to the type of offense and other variables. There is sufficient recidi-
vism among criminals, however, to indicate that true rehabilitation
does not occur in a majority of cases. Much effort is expended at
the local, state, and federal levels to ensure that offenders receive
vocational and educational training to maximize their chances for
rehabilitation and reintegration. There are many reintegrative pro-
grams available to criminals of all types, including vocational-edu-
cational curricula, individual and group counseling, and a variety
of social services. Offenders are encouraged to participate in these
programs, whether they are offered in jails, prisons, or in the com-
munity. One indicator that rehabilitation does occur is the amount
of remorse expressed by convicted offenders and their acceptance
of responsibility for their criminal acts.
Types of Sentencing Schemes
During the last several decades, sentencing practices in most
states have undergone transformation. There is disagreement,
however, about the number and types of sentencing systems cur-
rently used by the states. Furthermore, new sentencing schemes
continue to be proposed. The following types of sentencing
schemes are used in most jurisdictions: (1) indeterminate sen-
tencing, (2) determinate sentencing, (3) presumptive sentencing,
and (4) mandatory sentencing. Beyond those four categories,
other hybrid sentencing schemes have been devised.
6
Background and History

Indeterminate Sentencing
For many decades the most frequently used form of sentencing
was indeterminate sentencing. Indeterminate sentencing involves
setting explicit upper and lower limits on the amount of time to
be served by the offender, with one’s early-release date (from ei-
ther prison or jail) determined by a parole board. The judge may
sentence an offender to “one to ten years,” or “not more than five
years,” and a parole board determines when the offender may be
released within the limits of those time intervals. In the “one- to
ten-year” sentence, an inmate may be released early by a parole
board after serving at least one year of the sentence. Alternatively,
the parole board may release the inmate after two or three years.
Early release is often based upon an inmate’s institutional behav-
ior. Good behavior is rewarded with early release, while bad con-
duct may result in an inmate’s having to serve the full ten-year
sentence. At the end of the sentence, however, the jurisdiction
must release the inmate, as all of the sentence will have been
served (U.S. Sentencing Commission 2006).
Determinate Sentencing
Determinate sentencing denotes a fixed term of incarceration that
must be served in full, less any “good time” earned while in
prison. Good time is a reduction in the time served, amounting
to a certain number of days per month for each month served. If
inmates obey the rules and stay out of trouble, they accumulate
good-time credit that accelerates their release. In states using de-
terminate sentencing, parole boards have no discretion in deter-
mining an inmate’s early release. In 2005 there were twenty-six
states that used determinate sentencing. There were thirty-five
states using both indeterminate and determinate sentencing in
2005 (ibid. 2003).
Three types of good-time credit may be accumulated by in-
mates: (1) statutory good time, whereby inmates acquire good
time by serving time without problems or incidents, (2) earned
good time, in which inmates acquire good time by good behavior,
or participation in education or self-improvement programs and
work programs, and (3) meritorious good time, wherein good-
time credit is earned by exceptional acts or services. Inmates may
earn all three types of good time during their imprisonment. For
Types of Sentencing Schemes
7

example, Nebraska authorizes statutory good time of 7.5 days per
month, up to half of the maximum term reduction, in addition to
earned days of 7.5 days per month served, totaling 15 days per
month per 30 days served. In North Dakota, 5 days of statutory
good time are permitted per month; up to 2 additional days per
month may be granted for extraordinary acts by inmates, and 5
days per month of earned good time (given for performance at
work, school, and in treatment programs). All must comply to earn
good time. For example, if an inmate chooses to enroll in a GED
program, he/she may earn good-time credit, but it cannot be
earned simply by serving time in prison. The inmate must enroll
or comply with the rules for earned good-time credit accumula-
tions; thus, all inmates must comply with the work, school, or
treatment program requirements, if they want to earn good-time
credit. All inmates are given the highest possible amount of good
time to be earned upon entrance; if they become noncompliant,
however, they receive an “incident report” (write-up), and the Ad-
justment Committee sanctions loss of good time (Champion 2008).
There are several variations on good-time accumulation.
New Hampshire adds 150 days to one’s minimum sentence;
those days are reduced by earning 12.5 days per month for ex-
emplary conduct; failure to earn this good time means that the in-
mate must serve additional time beyond the minimum sentence.
In Ohio, 1 day of statutory good time per month up to a total sen-
tence reduction of 3 percent may be accumulated, while 1 day per
month of earned good time can be accumulated. The Federal Bu-
reau of Prisons permits up to 54 days per year of statutory good
time. Fifty-four days a year constitute approximately 15 percent
of one’s total sentence, and that fits the federal sentencing model
in which offenders are expected to serve at least 85 percent of
their sentence before becoming eligible for parole. The federal
government has encouraged individual states to adopt truth-in-
sentencing provisions whereby incarcerated offenders must
serve most of their original sentences before being considered el-
igible for parole. Various states have adopted these truth-in-sen-
tencing provisions in their sentencing schemes in exchange for
federal grant money for correctional improvements.
Presumptive Sentencing
Presumptive or guidelines-based sentencing is a specific sen-
tence, usually expressed as a range of months, for each and every

Background and History

offense or offense class. The sentence must be imposed in all un-
exceptional cases, but when there are mitigating or aggravating
circumstances, judges are permitted some latitude in shortening
or lengthening sentences within specific boundaries.
Aggravating circumstances are those factors that may in-
crease the severity of punishment. Some of the factors considered
by judges to be aggravating include the following: (1) whether the
crime involved death or serious bodily injury to one or more vic-
tims, (2) whether the crime was committed while the offender was
out on bail facing other criminal charges, (3) whether the offender
was on probation, parole, or work release at the time that the crime
was committed, (4) whether the offender was a recidivist who had
been punished for several previous offenses, (5) whether the of-
fender was the leader in the commission of the offense involving
two or more offenders, (6) whether the offense involved more than
one victim or was a violent crime, (7) whether the offender treated
the victim(s) with extreme cruelty during the commission of the
offense, and (8) whether the offender used a dangerous weapon in
the commission of the crime and the risk to human life was high.
Whenever PSI reports or sentencing hearings disclose one or
more aggravating circumstances about the offender or crime
committed, judges are likely to intensify the punishment im-
posed. That might mean a longer sentence, incarceration instead
of probation, or a sentence served in a maximum-security prison
rather than a minimum- or medium-security institution. Mitigat-
ing circumstances may influence judges to be lenient with of-
fenders and place them on probation rather than in jail or prison.
For example, a sentence of a year or less may be imposed rather
than a five-year term.
Mitigating circumstances are those factors considered by the
sentencing judge to reduce the crime’s severity. Some of the more
frequently cited mitigating factors in the commission of crimes
might be the following: (1) the offender did not cause serious bod-
ily injury during the commission of the crime, (2) the convicted de-
fendant did not contemplate that the crime would inflict serious
bodily injury, (3) the offender acted under duress or extreme
provocation, (4) the offender’s conduct was possibly justified
under the circumstances, (5) the offender was suffering from men-
tal incapacitation or some physical condition that significantly di-
minished culpability, (6) the offender cooperated with authorities
in apprehending other participants in the crime or in making resti-
tution to the victims for losses suffered, (7) the offender committed

the crime out of the need to secure basic necessities, and (8) the of-
fender did not have a previous criminal record.
Judges weigh the mitigating and aggravating circumstances
involved in an offender’s conviction offense. If the aggravating
circumstances outweigh the mitigating ones, the judge is justified
in intensifying the severity of the sentence. However, if the miti-
gating circumstances predominate, the judge may exhibit greater
leniency. Judges have considerable discretionary power when
sentencing offenders. How particular circumstances may be eval-
uated, however, is highly individual. Some judges may impose
especially harsh sentences even though there may be extensive
mitigating circumstances, simply because they don’t like, say,
child sexual abusers. In addition, judges also consider the risk or
danger posed by particular offenders.
If judges contemplate placing convicted offenders on proba-
tion and permitting them the freedom to move about within the
community, they may want to have some objective criteria to as-
sist them in their probation decision. One example of sentencing
guidelines would be those created by the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission that went into effect in October 1987. Table 1.1 is the U.S.

crimes, the chronicity of offending, age, and mental state (Pi-
quero and Davis 2004).
Down the left-hand side of the grid are offense levels, ranging
from 1 to 43. These represent a crime’s seriousness. All crimes are
scored, and the more serious the crime, the higher the score. No-
tice that the higher the score, the longer the recommended time
served. The point where a criminal’s offense level and criminal his-
tory intersect defines the range of months that judges will use for
sentencing. In a 30- to 40-month scenario, for instance, 35 months
would be the presumptive sentence, or the middle-range sentence
imposed, absent any mitigating or aggravating circumstances. An
upward departure from 35 to 40 months would occur, for example,
if someone showed extreme cruelty in the commission of an of-
fense, or was a gang leader. A downward departure from 35 to 30
months, say, might occur if the offender cooperated with police
and helped them to capture others involved in the crime.
In Table 1.1 four zones are shown, Zones A through D. These
zones represent a sentenced offender’s eligibility for probation or
some other type of punishment. For instance, Zone A sentencing
ranges include “0” months, which means that, at the judge’s dis-
cretion, probation might be imposed. Thus, probation-eligible of-
fenders sentenced in U.S. district courts would be eligible for
probation if their sentence falls within Zone A. Zones B through
D suggest other sentencing options. Zone B, for instance, may
also include probation, but with home confinement or electronic
monitoring. Persons whose sentences fall in Zone C must serve
at least half of their sentence in prison. Those in Zone D must
serve their maximum sentence in prison within the range of the
guidelines. Under present federal law, federal prisoners may ac-
crue 54 days per year against their maximum sentences as good-
time credit, the equivalent of a 15 percent sentence reduction for
every year served.
Presumptive sentencing has the following aims: (1) to estab-
lish penalties commensurate with the harm caused by the criminal
activity, (2) to produce a fairer system of justice, (3) to reduce the
typical severity of penalties, (4) to incarcerate only the most serious
offenders, (5) to reduce the discretionary power of judges and pa-
role authorities, (6) to allow special sentences for offenders when
circumstances are clearly exceptional, (7) to eliminate early-release
procedures for inmates, and (8) to make participation in treatment
or rehabilitative programs completely voluntary by inmates, with
no effect on their terms of incarceration (Champion 2008).
12
Background and History

By 2005, 95 percent of the states had reformed their sentenc-
ing laws so that an offender’s parole eligibility had been either
eliminated or made more difficult. Accompanying those reforms
were changes modifying the amount of good time that inmates
can earn and how good time should be calculated. Therefore,
while the certainty of incarceration has increased under determi-
nate sentencing, the sentences served are often shorter than those
resulting from indeterminate sentencing (U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission 2003).
Mandatory Sentencing
Mandatory sentencing is the imposition of an incarcerative sen-
tence of a specified length, for certain crimes or certain categories
of offenders, in which no option of probation, suspended sen-
tence, or immediate parole eligibility exists. California, Hawaii,
Illinois, Kentucky, and Michigan are a few of the many states that
have enacted mandatory sentencing provisions for certain of-
fenses (Van Zyl Smit and Ashworth 2004). For instance, Michigan
imposes a two-year additional sentence of flat time, whereby of-
fenders must serve two full additional years, without relief from
parole, if they use a dangerous weapon during the commission of
a felony. In Kentucky, those convicted of being habitual offenders
are sentenced to life without parole in prison for violating the
state’s Habitual Offender Statute. Usually, mandatory sentences
including life imprisonment are prescribed for those who use
dangerous weapons during the commission of a crime, habitual
offenders with three or more prior felony convictions, and major
drug dealers. But some critics question whether any significant
deterrent value results from mandatory sentencing laws, inas-
much as attorneys and judges find numerous ways to circumvent
them to suit their own purposes (Crow 2004).
The History of Sentencing 
in the United States
U.S. sentencing practices have been derived mostly from the sen-
tencing practices of other countries. The system of punishments
used during the American colonial period was patterned after En-
glish penal methods, largely because most colonists had emigrated
The History of Sentencing in the United States
13

from England. However, there were several important differences.
England continued to execute large numbers of misfits and politi-
cal and religious nonconformists because of their labor supply ex-
cesses, while the American colonies reserved execution for only
the most serious offenders. However, the colonists continued
using the pillory, flogging, mutilation, branding, and even banish-
ment as corporal solutions to crime and as deterrents to criminal
conduct (Roy 2004).
One colonial punishment was the ducking stool: offenders
were placed in a chair at the end of a long lever and dunked in a
nearby pond until they almost drowned. These offenders were
often town gossips or wife beaters. Branding irons were also
used on both serious criminals and petty offenders. Thieves were
branded with a “T,” drunkards with a “D.”
Such punishments continued to be used in the colonies until
William Penn, the Quaker founder of Pennsylvania, commenced
correctional reforms in 1682. Under the Great Law of Pennsylva-
nia, Penn abolished corporal punishment and gradually intro-
duced fines and incarceration in facilities known as jails, named
after their British counterpart, the jail (pronounced the same).
Penn commissioned each county in Pennsylvania to establish
jails to accommodate offenders. Local constables or sheriffs were
appointed to administer these county jails.
The sheriff concept emerged in the aftermath of the Norman
Conquest of 1066. William the Conqueror introduced the feudal
system, which lasted for several centuries. During that time, En-
glish counties known as shires were administered by reeves or
political appointees. Reeves collected the taxes, kept the peace,
and operated gaols on behalf of the king. Thus every shire had a
reeve or peace officer, and eventually those terms were combined
into the word sheriff (shire-reeve). Today sheriffs are the chief law
enforcement officers of U.S. counties in most states.
Penn’s ideas about correctional reform were unpopular with
Pennsylvania citizens, and when Penn died in 1718 his colony
quickly reverted to the use of corporal punishment. Pillories
were re-established, and floggings and lashings were reinsti-
tuted. Every colony practiced such punishment methods for
many decades preceding the Revolutionary War.
Many early jails and prisons in the United States were de-
signed to exploit prisoners through forced labor. Profits from
prison labor were frequently diverted to wealthy interests in the
14
Background and History

private sector. Prisoners were given only sufficient food to sur-
vive and to work (Ribeaud and Manzoni 2004).
Historians and penologists have devised date categories to
correspond with and emphasize notable reforms or penal devel-
opments. For example, Frank Schmalleger and John Smykla
(2001) have identified nine stages of penal development:
Penitentiary Era (1790–1825): Construction of at least thirty
state prisons, as well as large jails in Philadelphia and
other large cities
Mass Prison Era (1825–1876): At least thirty-five more prisons
were constructed, mainly as warehouses for criminals; lit-
tle thought was given to rehabilitation or reintegration
Reformatory Era (1876–1890): Invention of reformatories in
various jurisdictions; emphasis was placed on rehabili-
tating prisoners and teaching them marketable skills
Industrial Era (1890–1935): Characterized by the use of
prison labor to manufacture cheap goods for public con-
sumption
Punitive Era (1935–1945): Emphasis on maximum-security
prisons with a focus upon inmate isolation and control
Treatment Era (1945–1967): Greater differentiation among
prisoners according to their needs; attention given to
different types of prisoners who could be treated
through individual or group therapy, counseling, or vo-
cational and educational training
Community-Based Era (1967–1980): Emphasis on community
corrections and the use of community resources to meet
the social, economic, and psychological needs of less se-
rious offenders; focus upon community reintegration
Warehousing Era (1980–1995): Focus of prisons upon con-
tainment and control of large numbers of inmates; over-
crowded conditions and limited access to programs and
services for rehabilitation
Just Desserts Era (1995–present): Due process is emphasized,
as well as deserved punishment, as states and the fed-
eral government seek to equate the punishment with the
seriousness of the crime
Sentences for offenders in early U.S. district courts were
served in their entirety. Early release from prison was unknown;
The History of Sentencing in the United States

however, between 1790 and 1815, the federal inmate population
grew appreciably, and prison officials were faced with serious
prison overcrowding. Soon federal district judges were permit-
ting prison administrators to grant prisoners early release
through parole, a European innovation. Parole was used simply
to make room in prisons for new and more dangerous prisoners.
Sometimes prison administrators made those decisions on their
own without court approval. State prisons and local jails were
both experiencing overcrowding problems during this period,
despite the fact that by 1840 the national inmate population was
only 4,000. Thirty years later, in 1870, the national inmate popu-
lation had grown to 33,000, which meant that there were about 83
inmates for every 100,000 persons in the United States. Prison
and jail construction had not kept pace with the growing inmate
population (Rappaport 2003).
The National Prison Association was founded in 1870, with
Rutherford B. Hayes (later U.S. president) its first president. Its
name was subsequently changed to the American Prison Associa-
tion. By 1954, as its membership increased, it had been renamed
the American Correctional Association (ACA). By 2006 the ACA
had a membership of more than 35,000, more than triple the 10,000
members enrolled in 1992. Members represent a cross-section of
many corrections-related professions, including correctional offi-
cers, teachers, prison and jail administrators, probation/parole of-
ficers, and court personnel. When originally formulated, the goals
of the ACA were: (1) to provide technical assistance to correctional
institutions, (2) to provide training and publications to any inter-
ested agency, (3) to work toward establishing a national correc-
tional philosophy, and (4) to design and implement high
correctional standards and services (American Correctional Asso-
ciation 2006).
Probation and parole were established as nonincarcerative
strategies for managing offenders during the early 1800s. Evi-
dence of the early use of parole is found in the 1820s, while pro-
bation was used informally during the 1830s in selected
jurisdictions. By 1944, all states had parole. Parole is the early re-
lease of inmates from incarcerative sentences originally imposed
by judges. The parole decision is usually, though not always,
made by parole boards consisting of prison administrators, other
correctional personnel, and prison psychiatrists or group coun-
selors. Probation is a sentence in lieu of incarceration. Offenders
are assigned to probation officers or to community programs in
16
Background and History

which they must comply with several stringent conditions. Pro-
bationers are responsible to judges for their conduct during their
probation period, while parolees are accountable to the parole
board (Aos, Roman, and Beckman 2006).
During the late 1700s and early 1800s, English judges increas-
ingly exercised their discretion in numerous criminal cases by
granting convicted offenders judicial reprieves. Under English
common law, judicial reprieves suspend the incarcerative sen-
tences of convicted offenders. These reprieves were demonstra-
tions of judicial leniency, especially in cases in which offenders had
no prior criminal record and had committed only minor offenses,
and in which punishments were deemed excessive by the courts.
Judges believed that, in certain cases, incarceration would serve no
useful purpose. Although no accurate records are available about
how many convicted offenders actually received judicial reprieves
in English courts during this period, the practice of granting such
reprieves was adopted by some judges in the United States.
Judges in Massachusetts courts during the early 1800s typi-
cally used their discretionary powers to suspend the incarcerative
sentences of some offenders. Jail and prison overcrowding no
doubt spurred their interest in devising options to incarceration.
One of the more innovative judges of that period was Boston mu-
nicipal judge Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher. Judge Thatcher used ju-
dicial leniency when sentencing offenders. He also sentenced
some offenders to be released on their own recognizance (ROR),
either before or after their criminal charges had been adjudicated.
Thatcher’s ROR decisions amounted to an indefinite suspension
of their incarcerative sentences. Thatcher believed that such sen-
tences would encourage convicted offenders to practice good be-
havior and refrain from committing new crimes.
Although judicial reprieves and suspensions of incarcerative
sentences for indefinite periods continued throughout the nine-
teenth century, the U.S. Supreme Court declared the practice un-
constitutional in 1916. The Supreme Court at the time believed
that such discretion among judges infringed upon the “separa-
tion of powers” principle by contravening the powers of the leg-
islative and executive branches to write laws and ensure their
enforcement. However, during the 1830s, when releases on an of-
fender’s own recognizance and judicial reprieves flourished, the
stage was set for the work of another Boston correctional pioneer.
The sentence of probation in the United States was probably
conceived in 1841 by the successful cobbler and philanthropist
The History of Sentencing in the United States
17

John Augustus, although historical references to the phenome-
non may be found in writings as early as 437–422 BC. Of course,
the actions of Judge Thatcher have been regarded by some schol-
ars as probation, inasmuch as he sentenced convicted offenders
to release on their own recognizance rather than jail. However,
John Augustus is most often credited with pioneering probation
in the United States, although no statutes existed at the time to
label it or prescribe how it should be used.
The Temperance Movement against alcohol provided the
right climate for the use of probation. Augustus attempted to re-
habilitate alcoholics and to assist those arrested for alcohol-re-
lated offenses. Appearing in a Boston municipal court one
morning to observe offenders charged and sentenced for various
crimes, Augustus intervened on behalf of a man charged with
being a “common drunkard” (Augustus 1852). Instead of seeing
the convicted offender placed in the Boston House of Correc-
tions, Augustus volunteered to supervise the man for a three-
week period and personally guaranteed his reappearance later.
Knowing Augustus’s reputation for philanthropy and trusting
his motives, the judge agreed with the proposal. When Augustus
returned three weeks later with the drunkard, the judge was so
impressed with the man’s improved behavior that he fined him
only one cent plus court costs, which were less than $4.00. The
judge also suspended the six-month jail term. Between 1841 and
1859, the year in which Augustus died, nearly 2,000 men and
women were spared incarceration because of Augustus’s inter-
vention and supervision (Champion 1989).
Augustus attracted several other philanthropic volunteers to
perform similar probation services. These volunteers worked
with juvenile offenders as well as with adults. However, few
records were kept about the dispositions of juveniles. Thus, the
precise number of those who benefited from the work of Augus-
tus and his volunteers is unknown. In all likelihood, several
thousand youths were probably supervised effectively as infor-
mal probationers.
A new era of correctional reform was introduced with the es-
tablishment of the American Correctional Association (originally
known as the National Prison Association) in 1870. Subsequently, in
1876, Elmira State Reformatory in Elmira, New York, was estab-
lished. Elmira Reformatory was innovative in that it experimented
with certain new rehabilitative philosophies espoused by various
penologists, including its first superintendent, Zebulon Reed Brock-
18
Background and History

way (1827–1920). Brockway began his correctional career as a clerk
and guard at the Wethersheld, Connecticut, Prison in 1848. Later he
moved to New York to become superintendent of the Albany Mu-
nicipal and County Almshouse, the first county hospital for the
mentally ill and insane. His experience included superintendencies
of prisons and houses of correction at various sites in New York and
Michigan. Brockway was critical of the harsh methods employed by
the establishments he headed, and he envisioned better and more
effective treatments for prisoners. He had his chance in 1876, when
he was selected to head the Elmira Reformatory.
Elmira was touted as the new penology, employing the lat-
est, state-of-the-art scientific advances in correctional methods.
Penologists from Scotland and Ireland—Captain Alexander Ma-
conochie and Sir Walter Crofton—were instrumental in bringing
about changes in European correctional methods during the pe-
riod when Elmira was established in the early 1870s. These men
influenced American corrections by introducing the mark sys-
tem, whereby prisoners could accumulate good-time credits to
be applied against their original sentences. Thus, through hard
work and industry, prisoners could shorten their original sen-
tences, which earlier had to be served in their entirety.
Elmira was truly a reformatory. Concurrent with penal de-
velopments in Great Britain and other UK countries, prisoners
were channeled into productive activities of an educational or
vocational nature, in which their good behavior and productivity
could earn them time off for good behavior. Thus, parole and in-
determinate sentences became distinguishing features of Elmira.
Brockway established a board of managers to oversee the parole
or early-release process. He employed a three-grade system
wherein all new inmates were placed in the middle grade. If in-
mates earned perfect marks in school, work, and deportment for
six straight months, they were advanced to the first grade, which
gave them extra privileges. Another six months of good marks
would earn them parole at the discretion of the board of man-
agers. However, if they received unsatisfactory marks, they
would be demoted to the third grade, being outfitted with a red
suit and required to march in lockstep, with a loss of privileges
relating to correspondence and visitation.
Individualized treatment was also practiced. Actually, Zebu-
lon Brockway attempted to classify and segregate prisoners in
meaningful ways in order to improve the quality of their individ-
ualized assistance. In fact, Brockway is credited with establishing
The History of Sentencing in the United States
19

the first modern classification process for inmates. As a part of the
classification procedure, Brockway interviewed each new inmate.
Questions were asked about each inmate’s social, economic, psy-
chological, biological, and moral makeup. On the basis of the in-
terviews, Brockway would determine each inmate’s subjective
defect or limitation, whatever that might be. The defect would
then be used as the means of individualizing offender program-
ming. Also, Brockway would place each inmate in a particular
grade, with specific work and school assignments. He also took
cranial measurements and conducted research into criminal types.
Special programs were devised for what he termed mental defec-
tives. Inmate progress was monitored constantly, and Brockway
continued to reclassify offenders as they progressed in their re-
spective programs. The long-range impact of such classification is
illustrated by the creation of a special training class for mental de-
fectives that commenced in 1913. About 37 percent of all Elmira in-
mates were considered mental defectives and placed in menial
jobs, such as janitorial duties, mending clothes, and shelling peas.
A few years later, in 1917, inmates were administered IQ tests and
other psychological measures in an attempt to improve work and
educational programs for them.
Brockway also hired several teachers and used some of his
more literate inmates to teach other prisoners to read. Elemen-
tary classes were conducted six nights a week. For advanced stu-
dents, courses in bookkeeping, geography, physiology, and other
disciplines were taught by professors from nearby schools, such
as the Elmira Women’s College. An instructor from the Michigan
State Normal School was hired as the moral director in 1878, and
he began teaching courses in psychology and ethics. Subse-
quently, history and literature were added to the Elmira curricu-
lum. Elmira Reformatory actually began a summer school
program in 1882, and in 1883, Elmira installed a printing press
and began to publish The Summary, an eight-page weekly digest
of world and local news. This digest became the world’s first
prison newspaper. Brockway used the paper as a propaganda de-
vice to promote Elmira and its diverse programs. Subsequently,
Brockway routinely printed 3,000 copies of his annual reports
and 1,500 copies of The Summary weekly. These were distributed
to various influential persons around the state.
Use of the military model at Elmira was prevalent, as prison-
ers were trained in close-order drill, wore military uniforms, and
paraded about with wooden rifles. This was regarded as one
20
Background and History

means of instilling discipline in inmates and reforming them. His-
torians view Elmira Reformatory as introducing the first individ-
ualization of prisoner treatment and the large-scale use of
indeterminate sentencing. The influence of Maconochie and espe-
cially Crofton is apparent here. Crofton invented indeterminate
sentencing by establishing various work stages whereby prison-
ers could progress, thus shortening their original sentences.
Brockway, who left Elmira in 1900, was suspected of mis-
conduct in his administration, although little evidence was dis-
covered to substantiate those accusations. Two investigations of
Brockway’s methods yielded contradictory findings. The second
investigation exonerated Brockway, although the first resulted in
formal charges of cruel and inhuman punishment of inmates.
Brockway dismissed the allegations as meaningless, claiming
that his harmless parental discipline of inmates had been grossly
misrepresented.
Inmate overcrowding was a major problem contributing to
ineffective programming at Elmira. When Elmira was originally
constructed, 504 cells were created. However, more inmates were
sent to Elmira than were being paroled. By 1886, and again in
1892, substantial additions were made to Elmira’s facilities to en-
able it to house 1,296 inmates, although by the late 1890s there
were approximately 1,500 prisoners being accommodated there.
No prison administrator, regardless of how well intentioned,
could operate a rehabilitative program successfully under such
overcrowded conditions.
Subsequently the New York legislature approved a second
reformatory, the Eastern New York Reformatory at Napanoch,
which was opened in 1900. The first inmates at Eastern were
transferred from Elmira. These were the older and stronger in-
mates. Thus Eastern became known as a repository for hard-core
recidivists, parole violators, troublemakers, and incorrigibles,
while Elmira accepted and concentrated on younger criminals
with better prospects for reform. Over the next century Elmira
underwent numerous structural and operational changes. Re-
named the Elmira Correctional and Reception Center in 1970, the
facility continues to offer industrial, vocational, academic, and
other diverse programming for inmates, who average thirty-five
years of age. Subsequently services to treat substance abusers
were established, together with a shock incarceration program
for new offenders. (Shock incarceration occurs whenever a judge
sentences an offender to a lengthy jail or prison term of one year
The History of Sentencing in the United States
21

or longer, but within 30, 60, 90, or 120 days of being confined, the
offender is brought back from jail or prison before the judge and
is resentenced or placed on probation.)
Rehabilitation was not a poor concept theoretically. In fact, it
remains one of correction’s continuing goals as a part of general
prison reform. But prison overcrowding results in significant
changes in prison operating policies, and criminal justice proce-
dures must change to accommodate growing numbers of in-
mates. Of course, forces external to prison have always been at
work to shape prison policies. For example, economic fluctua-
tions over time have worked to modify the growth and develop-
ment of prison industries. And prison industries, including the
labor generated by inmates, provide training and development
opportunities for prisoners that are closely connected with and
facilitate rehabilitation.
Many prisons have reported greater inmate idleness and vi-
olence as a result of overcrowding in recent years. Furthermore,
many prisons are experiencing declining staff-to-prisoner ratios.
Accordingly, the quality of programs offered to inmates suffers as
prison capacities are exceeded through higher conviction rates
and changes in sentencing and parole policies. Although the link
between prison population growth and program quality is un-
clear, overcrowding does seem to adversely influence prison
practices and policies.
There was no federal prison system until 1891, when Con-
gress passed the Three Prisons Act. That act authorized the con-
struction of a prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, opened in
1895; a prison in Atlanta, Georgia, opened in 1902; and a prison
at McNeil Island, Washington, opened in 1909. When the prison
at Fort Leavenworth was constructed, it was intended for mili-
tary prisoners. Under another act of Congress in 1895, a U.S. Pen-
itentiary (USP) was authorized for construction about 2 miles
from the military prison at Fort Leavenworth. The labor of mili-
tary prisoners from Fort Leavenworth was used to construct
what is now USP Leavenworth. When a portion of this new
prison was completed in 1903, 418 federal prisoners were housed
at the new prison site in a large facility that now serves as the
laundry building. USP Leavenworth was eventually opened in
1906. All of the other federal prisoners from Fort Leavenworth
were housed in the new USP Leavenworth, and the military
prison there was returned to the War Department. The first war-
den at USP Leavenworth was James W. French.
22
Background and History

These and subsequent federal prisons were originally under
the supervision of the superintendent of prisons and prisoners,
whose title was subsequently changed to superintendent of pris-
ons. The first superintendent of prisons was R. V. LaDow, who
served from 1908 to 1915. Successively, the next superintendents
included Francis H. Duehay (1915–1920), Denver S. Dickerson
(1920–1921), Heber H. Votaw (1921–1925), Luther C. White (1925–
1926), Albert H. Conner (1927–1929), and, finally, Sanford Bates
(1929–1930).
No central authority existed to administer these facilities
until Congress created the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 1930.
Under the direction of the attorney general of the United States,
the Bureau of Prisons was established to manage and regulate all
federal penal and correctional institutions, to provide suitable
quarters, subsistence, and discipline for all persons charged with
or convicted of federal crimes, and to provide technical assis-
tance to state and local governments in the improvement of their
own correctional facilities. The first director of the new Federal
Bureau of Prisons was Sanford Bates (1884–1972), who retained
that post from 1930 to 1937. When the Federal Bureau of Prisons
was established, there were eleven federal prisons in existence.
At present a director oversees each of five U.S. regions, in
which all federal correctional institutions are located. These re-
gional directors are headquartered in Atlanta, Dallas, Kansas City,
Philadelphia, and San Francisco. Harley G. Lappin has been the
director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons since 2003.
Because of prison overcrowding and other factors, the federal
prison system has not always been able to accommodate ade-
quately all prisoners in its charge. Thus, contractual arrangements
are frequently made between the federal government and state
and local corrections departments to house a portion of the federal
prisoner overflow. Early challenges by prisoners to the constitu-
tionality of such contracting have upheld the right of the federal
government to make such arrangements with the states. In 1876
the U.S. Supreme Court declared that, as long as a state permits a
federal prisoner to remain in its prison and does not object to his
detention, he is rightfully detained in custody under a sentence
lawfully passed (Ex parte Karstendick 1876). States also have the
right to deny the use of their jails and prisons for housing of those
convicted of federal crimes if they so desire (Ex parte Shores 1912).
In 2006 there were 145 federal correctional institutions, ranging
from penitentiaries and prison camps to detention centers, medical

23

centers, and low-security facilities (U.S. Department of Justice
2006).
The Sentencing Process
Almost every serious felony conviction is followed by a sentenc-
ing hearing. This hearing is usually scheduled six to eight weeks
following conviction. A sentencing hearing is a formal proceed-
ing in which the sentencing judge hears pleadings and argu-
ments from both the prosecution and defense either to impose
the maximum sentence under law or to show leniency. The sen-
tencing hearing is arguably the most critical stage in the criminal
justice process. Sentencing hearings may be conducted exclu-
sively by the judge or with a jury. In murder cases in which the
death penalty may be imposed, juries find defendants guilty in a
first phase, deliberating at the conclusion of the trial. Then the
same juries must convene again, in a second phase, the sentenc-
ing hearing, to determine whether the death penalty should be
imposed.
Sentencing hearings are usually held in the same courtroom
in which the convicted offender’s trial was conducted. Defense
counsel may present friends and relatives of the offender who
can testify about the offender’s past, his good qualities, and his
likelihood of behaving in a law-abiding fashion in the future. The
defense attempts to influence the judge to hand down a light sen-
tence, and friends and family members may be called in to offer
favorable remarks about the offender. However, the prosecution
may call the victims as witnesses against the offender, as well as
relatives and friends who can give testimony about why the
judge should impose a heavy sentence.
Besides hearing orally from the defense and prosecution, let-
ters and other documents may be introduced. Additionally, psy-
chiatrists may provide testimony, either favorable or adverse to
offenders. However, their information is not always accurate. It
has been found, for instance, that mental health professionals
have erred in various ways when giving testimony in sentencing
hearings. These errors have included: (1) inadequate reliance on
base rates, (2) failure to consider context, (3) susceptibility to il-
lusory correlation, (4) failure to define the severity of violence, (5)
overreliance on clinical interviews, (6) misapplication of psycho-
logical testing, (7) exaggerated implications of antisocial person-
24
Background and History

ality disorder, (8) ignorance of the effects of aging, (9) misuse of
behavior patterns, (10) neglect of preventive measures, (11) in-
sufficient data, and (12) failure to express the risk estimate in
probabilistic terms (Cunningham and Reidy 1999). Unfortu-
nately, we have no way of estimating the incidence of such errors
in testimony given by such experts. Despite the possibility of er-
rors, however, sentencing hearings do permit ample opportunity
for both sides to present inculpatory and exculpatory informa-
tion to the judge from a variety of sources.
Judges also request a presentence investigation. A presen-
tence investigation is a thorough background check of a con-
victed offender by a probation officer, usually at the direction of
the sentencing judge. This background check includes a descrip-
tion of the offense; the educational, familial, and social back-
ground of the offender; an indication of any prior record; a report
of any prior juvenile offending; and other relevant information.
Presentence investigations almost always involve the prepara-
tion of presentence investigation reports (PSIs). Those docu-
ments, usually prepared by probation officers at court request or
order, are submitted to the judge during the interval between the
conviction and sentencing hearing. Thus an additional written
statement, evaluation, and recommendation are parts of the doc-
umentation that judges consider when imposing sentences.
The presentence investigation report is an informational
document prepared by a probation officer containing the follow-
ing personal data about convicted offenders, the conviction of-
fense(s), and other relevant data:
1. Name
2. Address
3. Prior record, including offenses and dates
4. Date and place of birth
5. Crime(s) or conviction offense and date of offense
6. Offender’s version of conviction offense
7. Offender’s employment history
8. Offender’s known addiction to or dependency on
drugs or alcohol or controlled substances of any kind
9. Statutory penalties for the conviction offense
10. Marital status
11. Personal and family data
12. Name of spouse and children, if any
13. Educational history
The Sentencing Process
25

14. Any special vocational training or specialized work ex-
perience
15. Mental or emotional stability
16. Military service, if any, and disposition
17. Financial condition, including assets and liabilities
18. Probation officer’s personal evaluation of the offender
19. Sentencing data
20. Alternative plans made by the defendant if placed on
probation
21. Physical description
22. Prosecution version of conviction offense
23. Victim impact statement prepared by victim, if any
24. Codefendant information, if codefendant is involved
25. Recommendation about sentencing from probation 
officer
26. Name of prosecutor
27. Name of defense attorney
28. Presiding judge
29. Jurisdiction in which offense occurred
30. Case docket number and other identifying numbers
(e.g., Social Security, driver’s license)
31. Plea
32. Disposition or sentence
33. Location of probation or custody
Presentence investigation reports are written summaries of
information obtained by the probation officer through interviews
with the defendant and an investigation of the defendant’s back-
ground. An alternative definition is that PSI reports are narrative
summaries of an offender’s criminal and noncriminal history,
used to aid the judge in determining the most appropriate sen-
tence. These documents are often partially structured, in that they
require probation officers to fill in standard information about de-
fendants. PSIs also contain summaries or accounts in narrative
form highlighting certain information about defendants and con-
taining sentencing recommendations from probation officers. In
some instances, space is available for the defendant’s personal ac-
count of the crime and why it was committed.
Regardless of whether convictions are obtained through plea
bargaining or trial, a presentence investigation (PSI) is often con-
ducted upon instructions from the court. This investigation is
sometimes waived, however, in the case of negotiated guilty
26
Background and History

pleas, because an agreement has already been reached between
the prosecution and defense concerning the case disposition and
nature of the sentence to be imposed.
No standard format exists among the states for PSI report
preparation. The PSI report was adopted formally by the Admin-
istrative Office of the U.S. Courts in 1943. Since then, the PSI has
been revised several times. The 1984 version reflects changes in
correctional law that have occurred in recent decades. Prior to
1943, informal reports about offenders were often prepared for
judges by court personnel. Although the U.S. Probation Office
represents federal interests and not necessarily those of particular
states, their PSI report functions are very similar to the general
functions of PSI reports in most states. The PSI report for the U.S.
district courts and the U.S. Probation Office serves at least five im-
portant functions: (1) to aid the court in determining the appro-
priate sentence for offenders, (2) to aid probation officers in their
supervisory efforts during probation or parole, (3) to assist the
Federal Bureau of Prisons and any state prison facility in the clas-
sification, institutional programming, and release planning for in-
mates, (4) to furnish the U.S. Parole Commission and other parole
agencies with information about the offender pertinent to a parole
decision, and (5) to serve as a source of information for research.
Providing information for offender sentencing is the primary
function of a PSI. It continues to be an important tool, inasmuch
as judges want to be fair and impose sentences fitting the crime.
If there are mitigating or aggravating circumstances that should
be considered, those factors appear in the report submitted to the
judge. Aiding probation officers in their supervisory efforts is an-
other important report objective, because rehabilitative programs
can thereby be individualized for offenders. If vocational training
or medical help is needed, the report may suggest that. If the of-
fender has a history of mental illness, psychological counseling or
medical treatment may be recommended. This information is also
helpful to ancillary personnel who work in community-based
probation programs and supervise offenders with special prob-
lems, such as drug or alcohol dependencies. PSIs assist prisons
and other detention facilities in their efforts to classify inmates ap-
propriately. Inmates with special problems or who are handi-
capped physically or mentally may be diverted to special prison
facilities or to housing in which their needs can be addressed by
professionals. Inmates with contagious diseases or viruses such as
AIDS can be isolated from others for health purposes.
The Sentencing Process
27

The fourth function of federal PSIs regards parole. In juris-
dictions in which parole boards determine an inmate’s early re-
lease potential, PSIs are often consulted as background data.
Decisions about early release are often contingent upon the rec-
ommendation of the probation officer contained in the report.
For instance, if the prospective parolee is a sex offender, it is im-
portant for the parole board to understand the likelihood that the
parolee may reoffend. Finally, criminologists and others are in-
terested in studying those sentenced to various terms of incar-
ceration or probation. Background characteristics, socioeconomic
information, and other relevant data assist researchers in devel-
oping explanations for criminal conduct. Also, the research ef-
forts of criminologists and those interested in criminal justice
may be helpful in influencing the future design of prisons or jails.
Special needs areas can be identified and programs devised that
will assist offenders in dealing with their problems. Because most
inmates will eventually be paroled, research through an exami-
nation of PSIs may help corrections professionals to devise more
effective adaptation and reintegration mechanisms, permitting
inmates to make a smoother transition back into the community.
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts uses standard-
ized PSIs that include five core categories which must be ad-
dressed in the body of the report: (1) the offense, including the
prosecution version, the defendant’s version, statements of wit-
nesses, codefendant information, and a victim impact statement,
(2) prior record, including juvenile adjudications and adult of-
fenses, (3) personal and family data, including parents and sib-
lings, marital status, education, health, physical and mental
condition, and financial assets and liabilities, (4) evaluation, in-
cluding the probation officer’s assessment, parole guideline data,
sentencing data, and any special sentencing provisions, and (5)
recommendation, including the rationale for the recommendation
and voluntary surrender or whether the offender should be trans-
ported to the correctional institution on his own or should be
transported by U.S. marshals.
When requested by federal district judges, PSIs are usually
prepared within a sixty-day period from the time of the request.
Although there is no standard PSI format among states, most
PSIs contain similar information. Presentence investigation re-
ports are usually prepared by probation officers. Although his
was much more informally prepared than modern PSIs, John Au-
gustus has been credited with drafting the first one in 1841. It is
28
Background and History

now estimated that more than a million PSI reports are prepared
by probation officers annually in the United States (Norman and
Wadman 2000).
The specific duties of probation officers relating directly to
PSI report preparation include the following: (1) probation offi-
cers prepare presentence investigation reports at the request of
judges, (2) probation officers classify and categorize offenders,
(3) probation officers recommend sentences for convicted offend-
ers, (4) probation officers work closely with the courts to deter-
mine the best supervisory arrangement for probationer-clients,
and (5) probation officers are a resource for information about
any extralegal factors that might affect the sentencing decision.
There are at least three legal approaches to PSI report prepa-
ration. In forty-three states, PSI report preparation is mandatory
for all felony offense convictions. Other factors may initiate PSI
report preparation in those jurisdictions, such as when incarcer-
ation of a year or longer is a possible sentence; when the offender
is under twenty-one; and when the defendant is a first-time of-
fender. In nine states, statutes provide for mandatory PSI report
preparation in any felony case in which probation is a possible
consideration. When probation is not a consideration, PSI report
preparation is optional or discretionary with particular judges.
Finally, in seventeen states a PSI report is totally discretionary
with the presiding judge.
The offender sentencing memorandum is an essential com-
ponent of PSI reports. Sentencing memorandums are a written
account of how and why the crime occurred, including the of-
fender’s explanation and apology. This memorandum is espe-
cially crucial in most sentencing decisions, since the offender
uses the occasion to accept responsibility for the crime. That is an
obligatory component and must be written convincingly. If
judges believe that offenders have honestly taken upon them-
selves the responsibility for their actions and are ready to accept
the consequences, they may impose a more lenient sentence.
Many U.S. jurisdictions today request that victims of crimes
submit their own versions of the offense as a victim impact state-
ment. The victim impact statement is a statement made by the
victim and addressed to the judge for consideration in sentenc-
ing. It includes a description of the financial, social, psychologi-
cal, and physical harm inflicted upon the victim. It also includes
a statement concerning the victim’s feelings about the crime, 
the offender, and a proposed sentence. Victim participation in 
The Sentencing Process
29

sentencing is increasingly encouraged, and a victim impact state-
ment is given similar weight to the offender’s version of events.
While victim participation in sentencing raises certain ethical,
moral, and legal questions, indications are that victim impact
statements are used with increasing frequency and appended to
PSI reports in various jurisdictions. In capital punishment cases
in which the death penalty may be imposed, for example, victim
impact evidence has increased the use of the death penalty for
some crimes.
Victim impact statements may be in the form of a written at-
tachment to a PSI report. Victims may also make a speech or ver-
bal declaration during the offender’s sentencing hearing. That is
ordinarily a prepared document read by one or more victims at
the time that offenders are sentenced. The admission of the vic-
tim impact statements is controversial. Defense attorneys may
feel that such statements are inflammatory and detract from ob-
jective sentencing considerations. Victim impact statements may
also intensify sentencing disparities in certain jurisdictions with
sentencing schemes that rely more heavily upon subjective judi-
cial impressions, as opposed to those jurisdictions in which more
objective sentencing criteria are used—such as mandatory sen-
tencing procedures or guidelines-based sentencing schemes. Pro-
ponents of victim impact statements believe that such statements
personalize the sentencing process by showing that real people
were harmed by the criminal. Also, victim’s rights advocates con-
tend that victims have a moral right to influence the punishment
decision. In recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that
victim impact statements are constitutional in Payne v. Tennessee
(1991).
PSI reports have an impact on judicial sentencing decisions,
and the contents of PSI reports furnish judges with a detailed ac-
count of an offender’s prior record. Socioeconomic, gender, and
racial or ethnic differences may, to varying degrees, have a per-
vasive effect on judicial attitudes and sentencing, although many
judges believe themselves to be fair and impartial. Most will
weigh one’s prior record heavily, however, when imposing a
prison term or nonincarcerative alternative. Good predictors of
sentence type and sentence length include case facts; offender
characteristics such as age, educational level, and employment
history; and prior record of other criminal activity. Crime seri-
ousness and victim injury also figure prominently when judges
calculate the most appropriate sentence.
30
Background and History

Judges have considerable discretion under most sentencing
schemes. Mandatory sentences must be imposed on offenders for
specific conviction offenses, although prosecutors decide in ad-
vance which crimes will or will not be prosecuted. Judges see only
the conviction offense rather than other charges that have been
dropped. The fairest state of affairs for convicted offenders is for
judges to have a knowledge of both the bad and the good infor-
mation about offenders and their crimes. Information unfavorable
to offenders is often expressed as aggravating circumstances,
while favorable information consists of mitigating circumstances.
All of these circumstances are detailed in the PSI report.
Today, all states and the federal government continue to ex-
periment with different variations of sentencing schemes. Missis-
sippi, for instance, changed its sentencing scheme at least ten
times between 1990 and 2006. Each time a sentencing change is
made, offenders sentenced under the new version are bound by
the sentencing policies of that version. Subsequent sentencing
changes in Mississippi leave previously sentenced offenders un-
affected under most circumstances. Almost every state and the
federal government are prompted to change the present sentenc-
ing scheme, however, largely because of high recidivism rates
among probationers and parolees. But it seems that no matter
what new sentencing scheme is adopted, the recidivism rate re-
mains at 65 to 70 percent—meaning that at least 65 to 70 percent
of offenders placed on probation or parole will commit new of-
fenses. Despite those discouraging statistics, each jurisdiction is
intent on revising sentencing policies in an effort to find the right
solution to the recidivism problem.
Summary
Sentencing is the imposition of a punishment on an offender re-
sulting from a conviction for a criminal offense. The sentence
may involve incarceration, a fine, or both. The severity of the sen-
tence is dependent upon the nature of the offense and other fac-
tors. The purposes of sentencing include deterrence and crime
prevention, revenge or retribution, rehabilitation and reintegra-
tion, just deserts, due process, justice, and crime control.
Several popular sentencing schemes have been and continue
to be used in the United States. These include indeterminate sen-
tencing, in which offenders are sentenced to a range of years with
Summary
31

a stipulated minimum and maximum sentence. A parole board
determines possible early release. Determinate sentencing has re-
placed indeterminate sentencing in many jurisdictions, however,
whereby early release can be obtained through an accumulation
of good-time credits. These are credits applied toward the maxi-
mum sentence, divided into statutory, earned, and meritorious
good time.
Presumptive or guidelines-based sentencing is now increas-
ingly used, inasmuch as it places various restrictions or limits on
judicial sentencing discretion. Another sentencing variation is
mandatory sentencing. Mandatory sentences are prescribed for
those who use dangerous weapons during the commission of a
crime. They also are applied to chronic or repeat offenders, or re-
cidivists. Some states have enacted habitual offender laws—three-
strikes-and-you’re-out provisions—to impose life imprisonment
on those with three or more felony convictions. Today most states
have hybrid sentencing schemes, including sentencing provisions
different from all of the schemes described in this chapter. It is
even not uncommon for states to change their sentencing schemes
back to earlier versions in the quest to reduce recidivism.

Background and History

Problems, Controversies, 
and Solutions
Introduction
This chapter examines several sentencing issues. Whenever a de-
fendant is convicted of a crime, a judge determines the sentence.
The sentence may involve incarceration, probation in lieu of in-
carceration, a fine, or several other types of sentences, sometimes
known as hybrid sentences. A hybrid sentence may be intermit-
tent jail confinement, such as serving one’s time on weekends in
order to permit convicted offenders to support their families by
working during the workweek. Or sometimes a judge will im-
pose jail as a condition of probation, in which case an offender
must spend a certain number of days or months in jail, followed
by a probationary term.
The first part of this chapter questions whether incarceration
is the best sentencing option for particular offenders. While get-
tough policies toward crime suggest that much of the general
public feels that all persons who commit crimes should be locked
up, incarceration is not necessarily the best option for all law-
breakers. Furthermore, there is simply insufficient jail and prison
space to confine all persons who deserve confinement. Therefore,
judicial discretion is necessary to discern which offenders should
be incarcerated and which should receive alternative sentences.
Jail and prison overcrowding is pervasive, and the problem is
growing worse. Jail and prison construction simply cannot keep
pace with the growing numbers of offenders. Increasingly, com-
munity corrections are being relied upon to supervise offenders in
35

their communities. That option, however, raises safety issues
among the general public. A delicate balance must be attained,
therefore, between the public’s need for safety and an offender’s
potential to be rehabilitated. It is difficult for most offenders to be-
come rehabilitated or reintegrated into their communities if they
are locked up. Supervised freedom in the community maximizes
rehabilitation opportunities and augments the reintegrative ef-
forts of probation and parole departments, loosely grouped under
the umbrella term community corrections. There is a constant ten-
sion, however, between public safety and offender freedom of ac-
cess to community services and rehabilitation.
If offenders have been confined in a jail or prison for a more
or less lengthy period, they are eventually paroled or freed in
some way. Estimates suggest that some 99 percent of all impris-
oned persons will eventually be released from confinement to re-
enter their communities. Parole boards in many jurisdictions
function like judges, in that early-release decisions are made ac-
cording to varying criteria. Both judges and parole boards attempt
to ascertain which offenders pose the least risk to public safety
and ought to be freed into the community. Various forms of pre-
diction are used, therefore, to make behavioral forecasts of which
offenders will be most likely to remain law-abiding if released.
Unfortunately, the perfect prediction instrument for such
forecasts has not yet been created. There are pervasive flaws with
most judicial and parole board decision-making. Despite inten-
sive efforts to develop objective parole criteria or behavioral indi-
cators for judges to use, some 65–70 percent of all released
offenders will commit new offenses within three years of release.
It is for this reason alone that sentencing schemes have been
changed in every jurisdiction, to limit judicial and parole board
discretion. A disgruntled public holds these persons accountable
for offender/client failures. However, judges and parole boards
may have little to do with determining who succeeds on proba-
tion or parole because so many interventions have been at-
tempted. No matter what is done, recidivism rates have remained
fairly constant at the 65 percent mark for many decades. It is lit-
tle wonder, therefore, that some jurisdictions experiment with
different sentencing schemes and good-time credits in an effort to
reduce recidivism. But no matter what is done, recidivism rates
remain high.
In the case of offenders deemed dangerous, or who may
pose societal risks, judges and parole boards may decide that
36

they should remain confined. Many of those persons will never
reoffend and would be law-abiding if released into society. Be-
cause of the imprecision of our instruments that forecast one’s
dangerousness, we simply lack the ability to make accurate be-
havioral forecasts. We don’t have the ability to know who those
persons are, but they are referred to as “false positives,” or per-
sons believed to pose risks to society who in fact do not. Then, of
course, there are those who are freed by judges into probation
programs or community corrections and inmates who are
granted early release, who go on to engage in new criminal con-
duct. Such persons are known as “false negatives.” The goal is to
minimize both false positives and false negatives, but at present
there are no means to make perfect behavioral predictions. Thus,
some persons are placed in prisons or jails for more or less
lengthy periods under a condition known as selective incapacita-
tion. That is an important issue, which will be addressed here.
Some offenders are convicted wrongfully. For whatever rea-
son, each year some innocent persons are convicted of crimes
they have not committed, and occasionally the criminal justice
system realizes its mistake and sets them free. But many such
persons are not identified and serve their sentences despite their
innocence. Various civil rights organizations, such as the Ameri-
can Civil Liberties Union, attempt to identify such persons and
assist them in gaining their freedom.
The judiciary and parole boards have been targeted here for
examination, inasmuch as they seemingly abuse their discre-
tionary authority. A brief glimpse at discretionary abuse on the
part of judges and parole boards will be provided, as well as a
look at preconviction programs such as pretrial diversion and al-
ternative dispute resolution. These are controversial measures
because they assume defendant guilt without benefit of a trial.
But their use in the criminal justice system alleviates crowded
court dockets and frequently results in civil resolution of other-
wise criminal matters. Accompanying such programs are at-
tempts by various agencies to predict offender risk. Risk
instrumentation has been developed and continuously refined,
but, as has been stated, serious problems persist.
Another dimension of sentencing is dealing with those with
mental illnesses, serious diseases, drug or alcohol dependencies,
and other addictions. Such special-needs offenders pose prob-
lems for judges and parole boards. Various categories of offend-
ers will be briefly examined, as will the types of problems they

pose for decision-makers and the issue of recidivism. How is re-
cidivism conceptualized or measured? How is it used to measure
program effectiveness? This chapter concludes with a discussion
of the appeals process. Once offenders have been sentenced,
what are their options to challenge their sentences? Most offend-
ers have little success in contesting their convictions. But, never-
theless, they may exercise their right to appeal.
Sentencing Issues
The following sentencing issues will be examined here: (1)
whether to grant probation or to incarcerate offenders, (2) the
growing problem of jail and prison overcrowding, (3) the tension
between the need for public safety and offender rehabilitative and
reintegrative needs, (4) selective incapacitation and the matter of
false positives and false negatives, (5) wrongful convictions, (6)
judicial and parole board discretionary abuses, (7) punishments
without convictions, and (8) predicting offender risk.
Probation or Incarceration?
Whether offenders should be placed on probation or incarcerated
is often a difficult judicial decision. Probation officers might rec-
ommend probation to judges when filing a PSI report for some
convicted offender, although the court may disregard the recom-
mendation. The just desserts philosophy is a dominant theme in
U.S. corrections today, and judges appear to be influenced by that
philosophy, as is reflected in the sentences they impose. Gener-
ally, their interest is in imposing sentences that suit the serious-
ness of the offense (Shane-Dubow et al., 1998).
Jail and Prison Overcrowding
Overcrowded jail and prison conditions affect judicial sentenc-
ing decisions. Judges have many sentencing options, including
incarceration or non–jail/prison penalties such as fines, proba-
tion, community service, restitution to victims, halfway houses,
treatment, or some combination of the above. It is precisely this
broad range of discretionary options associated with the judicial
role, as well as the independence of other actors in the criminal
justice system, that has led to jail and prison overcrowding be-
38
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

coming the most pressing problem facing the criminal justice
system today.
There have been drastic changes in the sentencing policies of
most states and the federal government (Grimes and Rogers
1999). As increasing numbers of jurisdictions adopt tougher sen-
tencing policies and implement sentencing schemes that keep of-
fenders behind bars for longer periods, overcrowding worsens.
In many instances, judges have no choice but to impose incarcer-
ation for specified durations because of mandatory terms for cer-
tain offenses; often they have little latitude in such cases. For
example, the discretion of federal court judges to impose proba-
tion as an alternative to incarceration was drastically curtailed
when the U.S. sentencing guidelines were implemented in 1987
(Conaboy 1997). The preguidelines use of probation applied to
more than 60 percent of all convicted federal offenders. In the
postguidelines aftermath, fewer than 15 percent of all convicted
federal offenders are granted probation at the discretion of fed-
eral judges, leading to still greater overcrowding. An emerging
dilemma is that proportionately larger numbers of nonviolent
federal offenders are now being incarcerated, when it is quite
likely that they might do well in community programs (Irwin,
Schiraldi, and Ziedenberg 1999).
The failure of incarceration—or the various nonincarcerative
alternatives—to rehabilitate offenders successfully may not nec-
essarily be the fault of those particular programs, but rather the
nature of the clients served by those programs. While most pris-
ons and some jails have programs to assist inmates to develop
new vocational skills and to counsel them, the effectiveness of
such programs is questionable. Understaffing is a chronic prob-
lem often attributed to lack of funding. and the equipment used
in prison technical education programs is often outdated. Fur-
thermore, if inmates earn an educational certificate it often bears
the name of the prison facility, and employers may be deterred
from hiring persons with prison records. Many of these institu-
tions, in fact, are principally concerned with the custody and con-
trol of their inmate populations, and rehabilitation is a somewhat
remote consideration.
One important reason that rehabilitation is less effective in
prison and jail settings is the chronic overcrowding. In some in-
stances the overcrowding in prisons approaches the level of
“cruel and unusual punishment,” at which point court interven-
tion is required (Welsh 1995). Thus there may be an extensive
Sentencing Issues
39

array of vocational and educational programs within various
prison settings, but overcrowding means that not all inmates can
take advantage of them. Furthermore, having too many inmates
in classes makes both teaching and learning more difficult (Call
and Cole 1996).
Offender Needs or Public Safety?
As courts move toward the greater use of felony probation, judi-
cial concern is increasingly focused upon determining which of-
fenders should be incarcerated and which should not. Therefore,
in recent years several investigators have attempted to devise
schemes that would permit judges and other officials to predict a
convicted defendant’s dangerousness, or level of danger, to soci-
ety. Obviously, this concern is directed toward preserving public
safety and minimizing public risk.
Most states have laws permitting officials to detain criminal
defendants on the basis of the defendant’s perceived dangerous-
ness. The legal test used is called the dangerous-tendency test,
which is the propensity of a person to inflict injury (Frazier v.
Stone 1974). Dangerousness is interpreted differently depending
upon the jurisdiction. In twenty-one states, for example, danger-
ousness is defined as a history of prior criminal involvement. That
history may include a prior conviction, probation or parole status
at the time of arrest, or a pending charge when the defendant was
arrested. In seven states the type of crime with which the of-
fender is charged defines dangerousness, and in twenty-three
states judicial discretion determines dangerousness. However,
many offenders, even those convicted of numerous offenses, are
nonviolent and not dangerous. Some persons believe that we
tend to overincarcerate those types of offenders, even though
they can function normally within their own communities, under
close supervision, as an alternative to confinement (Vitiello 1997).
Selective Incapacitation: 
False Positives and False Negatives
Selective incapacitation means incarcerating only those offend-
ers deemed to be high risks to public safety. The term is applied
to certain high-risk offenders and is designed to reduce the
crime rate by incapacitating only those most likely to recidivate.
40
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

Obviously, selective incapacitation is discriminatory in its appli-
cation, and the ethics and fairness of predictive sentencing are
frequently called into question. Professionals who deal with vi-
olent persons on a regular basis, mental health professionals and
psychiatrists, also question the accuracy of dangerousness in-
dices, especially when such devices are used for justifying pre-
ventive detention. There are simply too many variables that can
interfere with accurate prediction of individual behavior. If we
factor in drug abuse, substance abuse, or some other chemical
dependency, prediction attempts become increasingly unreliable
(Auerbahn 2002).
In Washington, for instance, specific types of offenders have
been targeted for special punishment following their sentences.
Washington State’s legislature passed the Sexual Predatory Act in
1990, which allows for the civil commitment of sex offenders in a
mental health facility if they are deemed to pose a future danger
to others. Identifying a specific offender aggregate for more ex-
tensive punishment when those persons have served their full
terms raises questions about the fairness of those extended terms,
even though they are served in mental hospitals and not prisons.
Similarities have been drawn between the treatment of habitual
sex offenders and habitual drunken drivers: one view is that we
have created a special category of offender from which there is no
escape. The only real predictor to be inferred based on current
knowledge, however, is that patients with a history of sexually vi-
olent behavior are at a high risk of committing future acts of that
nature (McGrath, Cumming, and Holt 2002). In many cases, un-
fortunately, the law selects inappropriate candidates for more ex-
tensive treatment in mental hospitals. Inappropriate candidates
for treatment include a majority of sex offenders who do not need
treatment or hospitalization because they are very unlikely to
commit new sex offenses in the future. Often, they are first-time
sex offenders without any history of prior sexual misconduct.
Their offense was more situational rather than arising from some
deep-seated disposition to commit a sex crime that should be
dealt with through extensive counseling, hospitalization, or other
aggressive treatment. The use of preventive detention for these
types of offenders raises both moral and legal questions.
In the case of false positives and false negatives, similar
moral and legal questions arise. When a false positive is denied
parole, the issue raised is the continuing confinement of an oth-
erwise harmless person. When a false negative is granted parole

and commits a new, serious offense, the public is outraged, the
parole board is embarrassed, and the integrity of test developers
and the validity of prediction instruments are called into ques-
tion. Judges who impose probation instead of incarceration, or
incarceration instead of probation, may be subjected to similar at-
tacks on similar grounds. Numerical scales therefore are often
used as more objective criteria for probation or parole decision-
making. It is not necessarily the case that these scales are superior
to personal judgments by judges or parole boards, but reference
to numbers seems to objectify an early-release or probation-
granting decision, in comparison to the use of visual appraisals
of offenders and subjective interpretations of their backgrounds.
Wrongful Convictions
The U.S. criminal justice system is not perfect. While no conclu-
sive data are available, it is clear that more than a few innocent
persons are convicted of serious crimes. This same problem holds
true in other countries as well, such as Canada, France, England,
and Australia. There are many reasons for a wrongful conviction.
Sometimes there is extensive circumstantial evidence implicating
the accused: a defendant may have had the motive, means, and
opportunity to commit the crime and may not have a reasonable
alibi. Sometimes not being able to explain where one was at a
particular time, coupled with other seemingly incriminating fac-
tors, may make a defendant appear guilty in the eyes of jurors.
Some aggressive prosecutors may threaten or intimidate cer-
tain defendants, using the possibility of charging them with crimes
that carry stringent penalties, such as long sentences of incarcera-
tion or the death penalty. Although it is wrong and unethical to en-
gage in such prosecutorial misconduct, some prosecutors threaten
and overwhelm certain defendants with extremely serious charges
that have little or no basis in fact. A gray area exists within which
prosecutors have great latitude in their charging decisions. Most
skillful prosecutors can present only incriminating or inculpatory
information to grand juries about criminal suspects, withholding
exculpatory information. And it is well known that indictments
against virtually anyone can be obtained, depending upon the
prosecutor’s wishes.
Cases against many suspects never come to trial. This is be-
cause the plea bargaining process today circumvents trials in
42
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

more than 90 percent of all criminal cases. After being initially
overwhelmed by very serious charges, defendants and their at-
torneys may be approached by “generous” prosecutors who wish
to save the government the time and expense of a protracted trial.
A compromise is thus offered, such as a lesser charge. If the de-
fendant pleads guilty to the lesser charge, probation may be of-
fered instead of the jail or prison time that might be imposed if a
jury trial were held and the suspect convicted. Many defense at-
torneys urge their clients to accept these “generous” offers from
prosecutors, especially if the client has a prior criminal record or
appears guilty on the basis of circumstantial evidence. Thus many
defendants relinquish their right to a jury trial, as well as other
important constitutional rights, in an effort to avoid the possibil-
ity of potentially serious punishment.
Then there are the cases in which innocent defendants do go
to trial and are convicted simply because they look guilty to the
jury, which the state has overwhelmed with extensive circum-
stantial evidence. These innocent convicted persons may spend a
great deal of time seeking appeals of their cases by higher courts,
but they must face the powerful presumption that the original
trial court verdict was correct. That is an extremely difficult pre-
sumption to overcome, especially if there is little or no hard evi-
dence to substantiate one’s claim of innocence.
In recent years there has been greater news media attention
focused upon very serious cases, particularly death penalty cases,
in which modern technology has been used to determine inno-
cence (Davis 2005). Evidence in most serious criminal cases is
carefully preserved for many years following the crime, in antici-
pation of the appeals that will follow. During the 1990s DNA typ-
ing was increasingly used as evidence against suspects, but its use
has also led authorities to rule out certain persons as suspects. By
2005 many of those serving lengthy prison sentences or on death
row throughout the United States were demanding re-examina-
tion of the blood evidence originally used to convict them (Bur-
nett 2005). In the case of a 1975 convicted black rapist with Type
A negative blood, it may turn out that there is no DNA match for
that offender. In fact, increasing numbers of law enforcement
agencies and correctional institutions are collecting blood speci-
mens from suspects or convicted offenders and typing those spec-
imens according to unique DNA patterns. On re-examination, it
may turn out that, not only was the black defendant wrongfully
Sentencing Issues
43

convicted in 1975, but that another convicted rapist, presently
serving time for another crime, is a perfect DNA match for the
crime in question. Often a confrontation of the actual perpetrator
with DNA evidence may elicit a confession. While prosecutors are
reluctant to admit their mistakes, appellate courts have been per-
suaded by such DNA evidence, and wrongful convictions have
been overturned (Boller 2005).
In 2005, only 37 percent of all wrongfully convicted persons
received state compensation for the months or years they had
spent in prison. Only twenty states had mechanisms in place and
institutional pathways for seeking compensation for wrongful im-
prisonment or conviction (Scheck and Neufeld 2002), and not all of
those states had uniform reimbursement provisions. For instance,
in 2005, Ohio capped awards to wrongfully convicted offenders at
$25,000 per year of incarceration, while the federal government
capped such awards at $100,000 per year. Also by 2005, 119 per-
sons had been set free from death rows throughout the United
States and classified as not guilty. They were granted full pardons
on the basis of evidence conclusively showing their innocence;
they had all charges against them dropped by the prosecution, or
they were acquitted of the charges that had originally placed them
on death row (Death Penalty Information Center 2005).
Judicial and Parole Board Abuse of Discretion
Judicial discretion in sentencing is often criticized, in that judges
make decisions primarily on extralegal factors rather than on
legal ones. Legal factors include prior record, the seriousness of
the current offense, age, and acceptance of responsibility. Ex-
tralegal factors refer to race or ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic
status, and attitude. Sentencing disparities attributable to race,
gender, socioeconomic status, and other extralegal factors have
plagued judges for years. Attempts have been made by commis-
sions and state legislatures to create greater sentencing consis-
tency and to bind judges to nonarbitrary standards. Sentencing
guidelines have been created in most jurisdictions to standardize
the punishments for various offenses. However, it has been ques-
tioned whether structured sentencing guidelines will eliminate
disparities in judicial decision-making. Experiments with various
types of sentencing reforms have evidenced some success in im-
proving judicial fairness (Irwin 2005).
44
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

Early release from prison, under appropriate supervision,
implies an agreement of trust between the state and the offender.
In many instances, this trust instills a degree of self-confidence in
the offender that yields the desired law-abiding results. Then
again, it is claimed that parole is a failure, although critics cannot
say for certain whether the problem rests with parole itself or
with the abuse of discretion on the part of parole-granting bod-
ies. Deterrence and crime control actually extend beyond parole
board decision-making. Probation officer supervisory practices
within the community play an important part in controlling of-
fender behavior. Furthermore, probation officers can be of assis-
tance in linking their clients with necessary community services,
such as psychological counseling and programming, voca-
tional/technical and educational programs, and other services.
Punishments without Conviction: Alternative
Dispute Resolution and Pretrial Diversion
In cases involving minor criminal offenses, one option used in-
creasingly by the prosecution is alternative dispute resolution
(ADR). ADR is a community-based, informal dispute settlement
between offenders and their victims. Most often targeted for par-
ticipation in these programs are misdemeanants. A growing
number of ADR programs are being implemented throughout
the nation. With their early roots in the Midwest, victim-offender
reconciliation or ADR programs now exist in more than a hun-
dred U.S. jurisdictions; also, there are 54 in Norway, 40 in France,
25 in Canada, 25 in Germany, 18 in England, 20 in Finland, and 8
in Belgium (Griffiths and Bazemore 1999).
ADR is also known as restorative justice. ADR involves the di-
rect participation of the victim and offender, with the aim of mutual
accommodation for both parties. The emphasis of ADR is upon
restitution rather than punishment. There are lower costs associ-
ated with it than with trials, and criminal stigmatization is avoided.
However, it is sometimes difficult to decide which cases are best ar-
bitrated through ADR and which should be formally resolved
through trial. This should not be interpreted as meaning that juve-
niles are excluded from ADR. In a growing number of jurisdictions,
many criminal cases are being diverted from the criminal justice
system through ADR. ADR is a relatively new phenomenon, but it
Sentencing Issues
45

is increasingly recognized as a means whereby differences between
criminals and their victims may be resolved through a conciliation,
mediation, or arbitration process. Restitution or victim compensa-
tion also makes such programs easier for victims to accept.
Another version of alternative dispute resolution is the vic-
tim-offender reconciliation program (VORP). Victim-offender
reconciliation is a specific form of conflict resolution between the
victim and the offender. Face-to-face encounter is the essence of
this process. The primary aims of VORPs are (1) to make offend-
ers accountable for their wrongs against victims, (2) to reduce re-
cidivism among participating offenders, and (3) to heighten the
responsibility of offenders through victim compensation and re-
payment for damages (Roy and Brown 1992).
Officially, VORP was established in Kitchener, Ontario, in
1974, and it was subsequently replicated as PACT, or Prisoner
and Community Together, in northern Indiana near Elkhart. Sub-
sequent replications in various jurisdictions have created differ-
ent varieties of ADR, each spawning embellishments, additions,
or program deletions deemed more or less important by the par-
ticular jurisdiction. The Genessee County (Batavia), New York,
Sheriff’s Department, for example, established a VORP in 1983,
followed by programs in Valparaiso, Indiana; Quincy, Massachu-
setts; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 1985. In Quincy the pro-
gram was named EARN-IT, and it was operated through the
Probation Department. More than twenty-five states have one
version of VORP or another (Umbreit, Coates, and Vos 2002).
Both juvenile and adult offenders have been involved in this
project over the years.
Pretrial diversion is a procedure whereby criminal defen-
dants are either diverted to a community-based agency for treat-
ment or assigned to a counselor for social or psychiatric
assistance. Pretrial diversion may involve education, job training,
counseling, or some type of psychological or physical therapy.
Diversion is the official halting or suspension of legal proceed-
ings against a criminal defendant or juvenile after a recorded jus-
tice system entry, and possible referral of that person to a
treatment or care program administered by a nonjustice agency
or private agency. Technically diversion is not true probation, in
that the alleged offender has not been convicted of a crime. The
thrust of diversion is toward an informal administrative effort to
determine (1) whether nonjudicial processing is warranted, (2)
46
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

whether treatment is warranted, (3) if treatment is warranted,
which treatment to use, and (4) whether charges against the de-
fendant should be dropped or reinstated (National Association of
Pretrial Services Agencies 1995).
Diversion is intended for first offenders who have not com-
mitted serious crimes. It is similar to probation because offenders
must comply with specific conditions established by the court.
Successful completion of those conditions usually leads to a dis-
missal of charges against the defendant. A totality of circum-
stances assessment of each offender’s crime is made by the
prosecutor and the court, and a decision about diversion is made.
Each case is considered on its own merits. Those charged with
driving while intoxicated, for example, may be diverted to attend
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings or special classes for drunken
drivers as a part of their diversion. Often diverted defendants
must pay monthly fees or user fees during the diversion period
to help defray expenses incurred by the public or private agen-
cies who monitor them.
Diversion originated in the United States through the early
juvenile courts in Chicago and New York in the late 1800s. There
were determined efforts by religious groups and reformers to
keep children from imprisonment of any kind, since at the time
children over eight years of age were considered eligible for adult
court processing. Cook County, Illinois, implemented a diversion
program for youthful offenders in 1899 (Doeren and Hageman
1982).The underlying philosophy of diversion is community rein-
tegration and rehabilitation, whereby offenders avoid the stigma
of incarceration and the public notoriety accompanying appear-
ances and trials. In most state courts in which diversion is con-
doned, diversion does not entirely remove offenders from court
processing, since the court usually must approve prosecutorial
recommendations for diversion. Because these approvals are
often conducted in less publicized hearings, a divertee’s crimes
are less likely to be scrutinized publicly. When an offender com-
pletes a diversion program successfully, one of two things hap-
pens. First, the offender’s arrest record pertaining to that offense
is erased through an expungement and the prosecution is termi-
nated. If that should not occur, however, the second, optional re-
sult is a downgrading of the original criminal charge to a lesser
offense and a resulting conviction. For instance, a first offender
charged with felony theft may have the offense downgraded to
Sentencing Issues
47

misdemeanor theft following successful completion of the diver-
sion program. Either way, though, for offenders who are granted
diversion, such programs are win-win situations.
Predicting Offender Dangerousness or Risk
Three basic categories of risk classifications have been identified
(Morris and Miller 1985):
1. Anamnestic prediction. This is a prediction of offender be-
havior based on past circumstances. If circumstances are
similar in the future, it is thought likely that the of-
fender will behave in the same way. For example, a pre-
sentence investigation report may show that an offender
was alcohol and drug dependent, unemployed, inclined
toward violence because of previous assault incidents,
and poorly educated. Recidivists convicted of new
crimes may exhibit present circumstances similar to
those that prevailed when they were convicted of their
earlier offense. Thus judges and others might rely heav-
ily upon the situational similarity of past and present
circumstances to measure offender risk. However, if
some offenders have made a significant effort between
convictions to obtain additional education or training,
or if they are no longer alcohol or drug dependent,
other types of behavioral forecasts will have to be made,
because circumstances have changed.
2. Actuarial prediction. This type of prediction is based
upon the characteristics of offenders as a class, similar to
others being considered for probation, parole, or inmate
classification. It is believed, for example, that those per-
sons who exhibit characteristics similar to those of their
general class of offenders will behave in ways similar to
the other members of that particular class. In effect, this
is an aggregate predictive tool.
3. Clinical prediction. This type of prediction is based upon
the predictor’s professional training and experience
working directly with the offender. The belief is that the
offender will behave in a particular way, based upon ex-
tensive diagnostic examinations conducted by psychia-
trists and psychologists. The subjectivity inherent in
clinical predictions is apparent, and the skills of the as-
48
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

sessor are paramount. However, such predictions are
more expensive, since each clinical prediction is individ-
ualized. Both anamnestic and actuarial prediction make
use of situational factors and the general characteristics
of offenders in forecasting their future risk. Interestingly,
the highest degrees of validity are associated with actu-
arial and anamnestic predictions, and they are consid-
ered very reliable. Predictors in clinical predictions are
usually psychiatrists or psychologists with extensive
clinical training and experience with deviant conduct
and criminal behavior.
Judges and especially probation officers are also interested in
behavioral prediction. A presentence investigation report pre-
pared for an offender sometimes contains a recommendation for
some form of probation or incarceration. That recommendation is
based on the probation officer’s belief concerning how good a can-
didate the offender will be for probation. This is behavioral pre-
diction. Prediction means an assessment of some expected future
behavior, including criminal acts, arrests, or convictions. Predic-
tions of future criminal behavior date back to biblical times, al-
though our concern here is with contemporary developments and
current prediction and assessment devices. Assessments of of-
fender risk have been devised by most departments of corrections
throughout the United States. Iowa, Kansas, and Massachusetts
are only a few of the states that have devised such instruments.
Several important and desirable characteristics of these instru-
ments have been outlined. They include the following:
1. The model should be predictively valid.
2. The model should reflect reality.
3. The model should be designed for a dynamic system
and not remain fixed over time.
4. The model should serve practical purposes.
5. The model should not be a substitute for good thinking
or responsible judgment.
6. The model should be both qualitative and quantitative
(Rans 1984).
In theory, parole boards apply a consistent set of standards to
prisoners who have committed similar offenses. When the board
departs from those standards—especially when parole is possible
Sentencing Issues
49

for an offender but denied—a written rationale is provided for
both the prisoner and appellate authorities. And an inmate has
the right to appeal the decision of the parole board to a higher au-
thority, such as the National Appeals Board (U.S. Code 2007).
Consistency is highly desirable in the application of any parole
criteria. Many inmate lawsuits involve allegations of inconsistent
application of parole eligibility guidelines. Present efforts to de-
velop classification schemes for predicting offender behavior re-
main at best an unstable business. This criticism applies to both
adult and juvenile risk assessment measures as currently applied.
Risk assessment devices developed and used in one state are
often not applicable to offenders in other states.
There are two important questions in designing any instru-
ment for predicting future criminal conduct: (1) what factors are
most relevant in such predictions and (2) what weight should be
given to each of those factors? We don’t know the answers for
certain. In fact, one recurring criticism of prediction studies and
the development of risk assessment instruments is that much
work is needed on the definition and measurement of criteria.
This does not mean that all of the current instruments are worth-
less as predictors of success on probation or parole. But it does
suggest that the measures are imperfect. Therefore, it may be pre-
mature to rely exclusively on instrument scores to decide who
goes to prison and who receives probation. In many jurisdictions,
however, risk assessment scores are used precisely for that pur-
pose (Robinson 2002).
Special Types of Offenders
Special needs offenders include physically, mentally, psychologi-
cally, or socially impaired offenders who require extraordinary
care and supervision. Sometimes elderly offenders are classified
as special-needs offenders to the extent that they might require
special diets, medicines, or environments. Mental retardation, il-
literacy, and physical disabilities are some of the many kinds of
problems associated with special needs offenders. Regarding the
provisions necessary for special needs offenders, several major
problems have been identified, including lack of access to ade-
quate mental health services, inadequate information and train-
ing among court and corrections personnel, and insufficient
interagency coordination and cooperation.
50
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

Special needs offenders may require (1) mental health coun-
seling, (2) substance abuse treatment, (3) parenting and family ser-
vices, (4) employment planning, education, and vocational
counseling, and (5) health screenings, treatment, and referrals.
Such services seem offender-relevant, since a lack of education and
drug abuse are two of the major obstacles to finding employment
(Dennehy 2006).
Special-needs offenders who have a mental illness or some
other type of mental condition are of particular concern. No one
knows how many mentally ill inmates there are in prisons and
jails throughout the United States. Mentally ill or retarded in-
mates present correctional officials with problems similar to those
resulting from drug and alcohol dependency. Frequently, inade-
quate staffing makes diagnoses of inmates and their problems dif-
ficult. Because jails are designed for short-term confinement, they
cannot adequately treat inmates with serious mental disturbances
or deficiencies. Suicides in jails and prisons have frequently been
linked to the mental condition of inmates unable to cope with
confinement. Mentally ill inmates also exhibit a high degree of so-
cially disruptive behavior. This behavior occurs not only during
confinement but also later, when the inmates are discharged. Of-
fenders who are mentally ill are incarcerated in greater numbers
than other offenders. Also, mentally ill inmates tend to mask their
limitations and are highly susceptible to prison culture and in-
mate manipulation. These offenders are often unresponsive to the
rehabilitation programs traditionally available to inmates. They
present correctional officers with unusual discipline problems
(Carr, Collins, and Leary 2006).
Another category of special-needs offenders is sex offenders,
including child sexual abusers. Sometimes these offenders are
grouped with criminals who are mentally ill and receiving spe-
cial services, while some feel that they should receive no unusual
consideration. Since many sex offenses are committed against
victims known by the offender as a friend or family member, a
large number of such incidents are never reported to the police.
Thus no one really knows how many sex offenders there are in
the United States at any given time.
Sex offenders are persons who commit a sexual act prohib-
ited by law. Fairly common types of sex offenders include rapists
and prostitutes, although sex offenses may include voyeurism,
exhibitionism, child sexual molestation, incest, date rape, and
marital rape. The list is not exhaustive. Child sexual abusers are
Special Types of Offenders
51

adults who involve minors in virtually any kind of sexual activ-
ity, ranging from sexual intercourse with children to pho-
tographing them in lewd poses. Although the precise figure is
unknown, it is believed that some 2 million children are sexually
victimized annually. It is also estimated that 90 percent of all
child sexual abuse cases are never prosecuted, although that sit-
uation appears to be changing (Kruttschnitt, Uggen, and Shelton
2000). Public interest in and awareness of sex offenders is based
on the belief that most convicted sex offenders will commit new
sex offenses when released. Regardless of the diverse motives of
sex offenders, there is general agreement among professionals
that these offenders need some form of counseling or therapy.
Many jurisdictions currently operate sex therapy programs de-
signed to rehabilitate sex offenders, depending upon the nature
of their crime.
Drug and alcohol abuse are highly correlated with criminal
conduct (Deschenes, Turner, and Clear 1992). Large numbers of
pretrial detainees are characterized as having drug or alcohol de-
pendencies. Offenders with such dependencies present several
problems for correctional personnel. Often, for example, jails are
not equipped to handle their withdrawal symptoms, especially if
they are confined for long periods. Also, the symptoms them-
selves are frequently dealt with, rather than the social and psy-
chological causes for the dependency. Thus when offenders go
through alcohol detoxification programs or are treated for drug
addiction, they leave those programs and are placed back into
the same circumstances that caused the drug or alcohol depen-
dency originally.
A growing problem in corrections is AIDS/HIV, or acquired
immune deficiency syndrome/human immunodeficiency virus.
Estimates are that by 1997 there were more than 3 million AIDS/
HIV cases in the United States, and that the number of AIDS
cases was doubling about every 8 to 10 months (Office of Justice
Programs 2001). AIDS is particularly prevalent among jail and
prison inmates. Prisoners living in close quarters are highly 
susceptible to the AIDS virus because of the likelihood of anal-
genital or oral-genital contact. Although there has been much im-
provement in creating greater AIDS awareness among inmates
through educational programs, the fact is that AIDS education in
incarcerative settings has not slowed the spread of the disease
appreciably. Interestingly, female inmates in state and federal
52
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

prisons have a higher infection rate than men. Some 2.2 percent
of men were AIDS infected in 1997, compared with 3.5 percent of
all female inmates (Office of Justice Programs, 1991).
It follows that if AIDS is prevalent and increasing among jail
and prison inmates, it is prevalent and increasing among proba-
tioners and parolees as well. Thus AIDS has become a primary topic
of concern among probation and parole officers and their agencies.
In view of the multifarious circumstances under which AIDS has
been transmitted in recent years—including saliva or blood residue
contacted by dentists and other health professionals—probation
and parole officers have perceived their own risk of becoming in-
fected with the AIDS virus accidentally. Many probationers and
parolees are former drug offenders. Drug-dependent clients repre-
sent a special danger, since AIDS is known to be easily transmitted
when drug addicts share needles. And it is widely known that
some crimes have been perpetrated by offenders wielding needles
or other objects they claim to have been infected with AIDS. Thus
supervising probation and parole officers must be on their guard
to protect themselves from becoming infected.
Another category of special-needs offender is the gang
member. Gangs are defined as self-formed associations of peers,
united by mutual interest, with identifiable leadership and inter-
nal organization, that act collectively or individually to achieve
specific purposes, including the conduct of illegal activity and
control of a particular territory, facility, or enterprise. They may
count as members either adults or juveniles. In 2002 there were
more than 800,000 active gang members in 29,000 youth gangs
throughout the United States, both on the streets and in U.S. pris-
ons and jails (Wilson 2000). Many gangs are involved in illicit ac-
tivities, such as dealing drugs or transporting firearms, and
many gang members are smart enough not to get caught taking
drugs while serving time in probation or while on parole. Super-
vising officers often regard their interventions with gang mem-
bers as unproductive, since it is difficult to overcome the
influence of gang membership: identification with a gang and in-
volvement in delinquent activities are highly compelling (Bjerre-
gaard 2002). Virtually every city with a population of 250,000 or
more has reported the presence of gangs. Furthermore, there
have been significant increases in gang membership in suburban
and rural areas of the United States; the number of gang mem-
bers in those areas increased by 50 percent between 1996 and
Special Types of Offenders
53

2002. It is difficult to understand why youth gangs form and per-
petuate themselves over time, however: gangs emerge, grow, dis-
solve, and disappear for reasons that are poorly understood.
Offenders with physical handicaps constitute a growing but
often neglected population. Some offenders are confined to
wheelchairs, and therefore special facilities must be constructed
to accommodate their access to probation or parole offices or
community-based sites. Other offenders have hearing or speech
impairments that limit them in various ways.
Physically challenged offenders often require greater atten-
tion from their supervising officers. Acquiring and maintaining
employment may be difficult for them, and many probation and
parole officers become brokers between their own agencies and
community businesses that are encouraged to employ some of
these people. Community volunteers have been increasingly
helpful in assisting probation and parole agencies with physi-
cally handicapped clients.
Recidivism and Sentencing Effectiveness
There is a great deal of controversy over the definition of recidi-
vism. A conventional definition is that recidivism is the commis-
sion of a new crime after conviction for an earlier offense. Many
investigations of this phenomenon have been conducted, although
no consensus exists about the meaning of the term. Criminologists
and others can recite lengthy lists of characteristics that describe
recidivists, but describing recidivists and using those characteris-
tics as effective predictors of recidivism are two different matters.
Several problems have been identified relating to recidivism
and its measurement. Some of the more common ones are listed
here:
1. The time interval between commencing a probation or
parole program and recidivating is different from one
study to the next. Some standards use 6 months, while
others use a year, two years, or five years.
2. There are at least fourteen different meanings of the
term recidivism. The differences lead to confusion.
3. Recidivism is often dichotomized rather than graduated.
Thus, it is said that people either recidivate or they
54
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

don’t. No flexibility exists to allow for degrees of seri-
ousness of the offense.
4. Recidivism rates are influenced by many factors, such as
the intensity of supervised probation or parole, the
number of face-to-face visits between POs and their
clients, and even the rate of prison construction.
5. Recidivism rates may be indicative of program failure
rather than client failure.
6. Recidivism rates include only officially reported viola-
tions of the law; self-reported information indicates that
rates of recidivism may actually be higher than the re-
ported rates indicate.
7. Considerable client variation exists, as well as many
programmatic variations. Recidivism varies with the
client population under investigation.
8. Policy shifts in local and state governments may change
how recidivism is used or defined, as well as the
amount of recidivism observed in given jurisdictions
(Maltz and McCleary 1977).
We know, or at least we believe we know, that recidivists
tend to be male, black, young, less well educated, and with
lengthy prior records. In fact, having a lengthy prior record ap-
pears to be most consistently related to recidivism. Therefore,
should we make it official judicial or parole board policy not to
grant probation or parole to younger, less educated, black men
with lengthy prior records? No. These are aggregate characteris-
tics that do not easily lend themselves to individualized proba-
tion or parole decision-making.
One continuing problem is that while these and other char-
acteristics describe the general category of recidivists, they are
also found among many nonrecidivists. Thus, based upon rele-
vant information about offenders, prediction measures must be
devised and tested to improve their validity. A related problem is
determining whether recidivism has occurred. This means that
some degree of agreement needs be established concerning what
does and does not constitute recidivism.
Existing measures of recidivism complicate rather than sim-
plify the term’s definition. It is important to pay attention to how
recidivism is conceptualized in the research literature, because
probation or parole program success is measured by recidivism
Recidivism and Sentencing Effectiveness
55

rates. A general standard has emerged among professionals that
a failure rate above 30 percent means that a probation or parole
program is ineffective. But ineffective in what sense? Reducing
crime? Rehabilitating offenders? Both?
Recidivism means program failure—or does it? There are a
wide variety of probation and parole programs available to the
courts and corrections officials for many different kinds of of-
fenders. One common problem faced by all programs is that ob-
servers have trouble matching the right program with the right
client. We have much descriptive information about recidivists.
Numerous evaluative studies are conducted annually of various
offender programs, and virtually all strategies for dealing with
offenders have been examined and re-examined. No matter the
cure proposed, however, the illness remains. Treatments are
rarely simple, and therefore their evaluations are always compli-
cated. Probationers or parolees who violate one or more terms of
their probation or parole—regardless of the type of program—
are considered recidivists.
Sentencing Appeals and 
the Appeals Process
Once defendants have been convicted of a crime, they are enti-
tled to at least one appeal to a higher court. The primary purpose
of an appeal is to correct a wrong that may have been committed.
These wrongs may be mistakes by police, the prosecution, or the
court. Errors may have occurred that influence the trial outcome.
Appeals are intended to correct those mistakes and errors.
A secondary purpose of an appeal is to render judgment
about one or more issues that will influence future cases. Thus,
when an appellate court hears a case from a lower trial court,
their decision becomes a precedent for subsequent similar cases.
That is the doctrine of stare decisis, meaning that once a higher
court has ruled a particular way on an issue, lower courts are
bound to make rulings consistent with that finding. However,
trial court judges do have some discretion in deciding whether
particular cases resemble previous cases in which appellate
courts have ruled. Thus trial court judges may decide that, al-
though a subsequent case is similar in various respects to previ-
56
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

ous cases already decided by higher courts, there may be enough
differences to require a separate finding.
All death sentences are automatically appealed. The appellate
process for any case, capital or otherwise, begins by filing an ap-
peal with the most immediate appellate court above the trial court
level. In capital cases originating in state courts, state remedies
must be pursued on appeal before the federal system is accessed.
For instance, a person convicted of murder in California and sen-
tenced to death must direct an appeal first to the Court of Crimi-
nal Appeals. If there is an unfavorable ruling by that appellate
court, the offender may direct an appeal to the California Supreme
Court. If the ruling by that court is also unfavorable to the offender,
a direct appeal for relief may be made to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Appellants are persons who initiate appeals; appellees are
those who have prevailed in the trial court and argue against re-
versing the decision of the lower court. Those convicted of capi-
tal crimes and sentenced to death are appellants. In most
instances, the state is the appellee. There are many grounds upon
which to base appeals. Furthermore, appeals in most death
penalty cases cause those cases to drag out over a period of ten
to fifteen years before appellants are finally executed.
Appeals may be directed to appellate courts on diverse
grounds. Appellants may raise questions before appellate courts
about how they were originally arrested and processed. They
may challenge the admissibility of certain evidence used to con-
vict them. They may claim incompetent or ineffective assistance
of counsel. They may challenge the sentence imposed by the
judge. Almost every one of these challenges may be included
within the scope of a habeas corpus petition.
Habeas corpus means, literally, “produce the body.” A habeas
corpus petition challenges three things: (1) the fact of confine-
ment, (2) the length of confinement, and/or (3) the nature of the
confinement. The fact of confinement involves every event that
led to the present circumstances of the appellant (Westervelt and
Cook 2004). If the appellant is on death row resulting from a cap-
ital offense conviction, any aspect of the justice process leading to
that offender’s placement on death row is a potential habeas cor-
pus target.
Appeals of any kind, especially death penalty appeals, con-
sume a great deal of time. On the average, it takes about ten to
eleven years for inmates on death row to exhaust the appeals
Sentencing Appeals and the Appeals Process
57

process. In some instances, appeals have dragged out for fifteen
years (Maguire and Pastore 2005). One reason for the length of
the appeals process is that prisoners are permitted to file new pe-
titions with state or federal courts, under a variety of theories.
While habeas corpus is the most frequently used appeal, there is
almost no limit to the number of issues that may be raised by in-
mates and their counsel that can result in a conviction or sentence
being overturned.
If an offender’s case is reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court
and the Court rules in the offender’s favor, the case is often rear-
gued at a new trial. When second or third trials occur, however, the
results are almost always the same as those of the first trial. In fact,
some evidence exists to show that sentencing judges may abuse
their sentencing discretion and punish those offenders with
harsher penalties than earlier prescribed (Williams 1995). But the
U.S. Supreme Court has usually condoned harsher sentences by
judges, especially in cases in which judges have provided a logical,
written rationale for the harsher sentence. Increased sentences
have survived constitutional challenges as violations of double
jeopardy, equal protection, and due process.
Appeals are launched by appellants, or those who lose their
cases in the trial court. Most frequently, appellants are convicted
offenders. They must first file a notice of appeal—a written state-
ment of the appellant’s intent to file an appeal with a higher
court. Such notices are required within a fixed period following
an offender’s conviction. A copy of the court record or complete
transcript of proceedings is forwarded to the appellate court for
review. Also, a brief is filed with the appellate court, outlining the
principal arguments for the appeal. These arguments may per-
tain to particular judicial rulings believed to be incorrect. Appel-
lants are required to list the issues that are the substance of the
appeal. If the appellant believes that thirty mistakes were com-
mitted by the trial judge, or if the prosecutor was believed to
have made prejudicial remarks to the jury where such remarks
are prohibited, or if the police did not advise the offender of the
Miranda rights upon arrest, all of these mistakes or errors should
be listed in the legal brief. These errors or mistakes are consid-
ered appealable issues. An offender’s first appeal should contain
all of the relevant issues, since it is unlikely that courts will con-
sider further appeals over omitted issues.
In response, appellees may file briefs as well, defending why
they believe that there were no procedural irregularities or errors
58
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

committed. These arguments are intended to counter allegations of
irregularities raised by appellants. Thus the groundwork is pro-
vided for argument later before the appellate court. Most states and
the federal government have criminal appellate courts, in which of-
fenders direct their appeals. These appellate courts frequently con-
sist of three-judge panels who will hear the legal arguments and
decide whether the trial court was in error. Rulings by appellate
courts that overturn a lower trial court are rare, however. One rea-
son is that appellate courts assume that whatever occurred during
the offender’s trial was correct, and that the criminal conviction
was valid. That is a difficult presumption for appellants to over-
come. They often must present overwhelming evidence of prose-
cutorial misconduct or judicial indiscretion in order to convince an
appellate court to reverse or set aside their conviction. And if a con-
viction is reversed, that decision does not absolve the offender of
criminal liability. A new trial may be ordered, or a sentencing deci-
sion may be modified to be consistent with a higher court ruling.
Presenting the case for the appellant is the defense attorney in
most criminal cases, while the district attorney or state prosecutor
(the U.S. attorney or assistant U.S. attorney in federal courts) will
offer the government’s position in the matter to be argued. The dis-
pute process is in the form of oral argument. Once the appellate
court has heard the oral arguments from both sides and has con-
sulted the trial transcript, it will render an opinion. An opinion is
a written decision about the issue(s) argued, and a holding as to
which side—appellant or appellee—prevails. If the appellate court
holds in favor of the appellant, and if the appellant is a convicted
offender, the case is reversed and remanded back to the trial court
with instructions for modifying the original decision. When the
ruling favors the government, the appellate court is said to affirm
the holding or judgment against the appellant/offender. When the
case against the offender has been affirmed by an appellate court,
the offender may then direct an appeal to the next higher appellate
court. In state courts, this higher appellate court is the state
supreme court or court of last resort within the state judicial sys-
tem. If the state supreme court affirms the conviction, the offender
may direct an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In some opinions by appellate courts, not all of the appellate
judges agree about the decision rendered. The minority view is
sometimes summarized in a dissenting opinion. Legal historians
value dissenting opinions, because they believe that the policy
changes of appellate courts may be predicted over time. That is
Sentencing Appeals and the Appeals Process
59

especially true if those rendering dissenting opinions are
younger judges on appellate panels. However, the fact is that
these minority or dissenting opinions have no impact on the ap-
peal outcome. The majority opinion is the governing opinion in
the case and is the more important. Appellate judges who write
the majority opinion also outline the legal rationale for their
opinion. Such opinions are more or less lengthy. The ultimate
court deciding the fate of appellants is the U.S. Supreme Court,
or the court of last resort.
Summary
Some of the problems and controversies surrounding sentencing
policies in the United States are exacerbated by prison and jail
overcrowding. It is an impossible task for states and the federal
government to keep pace with the growing number of incarcer-
ated offenders. In lieu of incarceration, therefore, corrections
have turned to community supervision of offenders as a viable
and effective alternative. Professionals contend that many of-
fenders do not need to be incarcerated, but get-tough proponents
suggest that all persons who break the law should be punished,
and they may equate punishment with incarceration.
A tension exists, therefore, between citizens who have legit-
imate fears of offenders living among them and the need to allow
offenders some freedom to seek and hold jobs to support them-
selves and their families and to become rehabilitated and reinte-
grated. Public relations efforts have been useful in most
jurisdictions in convincing citizens of the advantages of success-
ful reintegration and its correlation with lower crime rates. It is
not now, and it has never been, the intention of corrections to set
free dangerous criminals.
In an effort to be more selective regarding who gets probation
and parole, judges and parole boards have devised various means
of assessing risk and the potential for dangerous conduct. Mea-
sures of risk and needs have been devised as a means of making
behavioral forecasts. However, those forecasts have proved faulty
and are continuously being revised and improved. No perfect
prediction instrument exists, and it is likely that we will never de-
velop such an instrument. In the meantime, many persons, be-
cause of characteristics they share with chronic recidivists, are
60
Problems, Controversies, and Solutions

kept in prisons and jails, while others who may be dangerous are
permitted their freedom.
Mistakes are made, to be sure. Some of the offenders placed
in prison or jail will never reoffend. These are known as false pos-
itives. By the same token, some who are deemed safe and un-
likely to pose a risk do become dangerous and harm others.
Those are known as false negatives. The criminal justice system
is intent upon reducing the number of false positives and false
negatives. It is believed that only those deserving incarceration
should receive it, through selective incapacitation, and that those
committing the most serious offenses should receive the longest
sentences. Selective incapacitation has been criticized, however,
in many circles, largely because of faulty prediction instruments.
Several types of prediction have been used to forecast risk.
These include actuarial prediction, anamnestic prediction, and
clinical prediction. For all practical purposes, little difference in
effectiveness exists among them, and all have similar degrees of
predictive utility. But clinical prediction is the most expensive,
inasmuch as it requires one-on-one evaluations by psychiatrists
and psychologists. Actuarial and anamnestic prediction seem to
forecast with equal effectiveness.
A vexing problem is that wrongful convictions against de-
fendants are sometimes obtained, although it is unknown how
often such travesties of justice occur. Various organizations work
to prevent wrongful conviction and to free those who can demon-
strate their innocence. Judicial discretion often influences the na-
ture of criminal proceedings against particular criminal
defendants, and wrongful convictions may ensue as the result of
an abuse of that discretion. Whenever such abuses of discretion
are detected, they are investigated. By the same token, parole
boards sometimes release dangerous offenders who eventually
commit new crimes. Those discretionary abuses are also investi-
gated. One reaction on the part of the citizenry, expressed through
the actions of legislators, is to change sentencing laws to curb the
discretionary powers of judges and parole boards. However, de-
spite the changes made over several decades, there is a continuing
pattern of recidivism among those on probation and parole that is
alarmingly high. It is consistently the case that at least 65 percent
of all probationers and parolees will reoffend within three years,
regardless of the interventions attempted on their behalf. This
high recidivism rate frustrates both the public and politicians.
Summary
61

Some persons are chronic recidivists, meaning that they make
their living from crime as career criminals, or are persistent violent
offenders intent on harming or exploiting others. Recidivism may
be variously defined, depending upon the term’s use in the re-
search literature. It may refer to reincarcerations, rearrests, recon-
victions, technical program violations for those on probation or
parole, or several other actions. But reconvictions are the most re-
liable indicator of recidivism used at present.
For many offenders, especially those who commit minor of-
fenses or who are first-time offenders, civil alternatives to criminal
trial may exist. Two civil means of processing offenders include al-
ternative dispute resolution (ADR) and pretrial diversion. ADR is
victim-offender reconciliation wherein the two parties attempt to
resolve their differences through a third-party arbiter. Their aim is
to reach an amicable solution whereby property is restored, med-
ical bills are paid, and some form of restitution is exacted. Those
who successfully complete ADR may succeed in having the
records of their arrests expunged. For pretrial divertees, the intent
is that they remain law-abiding for a period of time. If they are suc-
cessful in complying with the terms and conditions of their diver-
sion program, they are likely to have the criminal charges against
them dismissed. Their records may even be expunged. These pro-
grams, however, assume guilt without the benefit of trial, and crit-
ics insist that in order for the criminal justice system to be fair to
all, everyone is entitled to a day in court. However, many ADR
participants and pretrial divertees like things as they are and wish
that civil rights groups would not interfere.
Many persons charged with and convicted of crimes have
special needs; they are designated as special-needs offenders.
These include the mentally ill, sex offenders or child sexual
abusers, those with communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS
or tuberculosis, drug- or alcohol-dependent offenders and those
with other dependencies, and handicapped persons or those
with physical disabilities. These offenders pose various kinds of
supervisory problems for probation and parole officers, and even
for correctional officers who must interact with them closely.
Whenever persons are sentenced for any type of crime, they
have the right to appeal their sentences, usually to higher courts
or appellate courts. Each state has its own appellate court system,
and the federal court process is organized similarly. Pursuing ap-
peals is costly and time-consuming, but some appealable issues

eventually reach the court of last resort or the U.S. Supreme
Court. Various grounds are used to launch appeals from trial
courts, the most common being habeas corpus, wherein the fact,
nature, and length of confinement are challenged.

Worldwide Perspective
Introduction
Sentencing in the United States is unique among the nations of
the world. There are obvious parallels to other nations, such as
sentencing goals, including deterrence, retribution, rehabilitation
and reintegration, punishment, just deserts and justice, and
crime control. But how other nations sentence their offenders
varies widely. One explanation for these sentencing variations is
that crime is often defined differently elsewhere. Greater or lesser
emphasis may be placed on rehabilitation, and some countries
lack the resources and skills to construct and operate sophisti-
cated prisons and rehabilitation centers. Their facilities, there-
fore, are more primitive confinement institutions. Still other
countries have very liberal policies toward most offenders, per-
mitting them frequent opportunities to leave confinement to visit
with families and interact with others.
This chapter focuses on the sentencing practices in a select
number of countries. The countries chosen for inclusion here
were targeted because of their differences from U.S. sentencing
policies and practices. The sentencing schemes of each country
presented here are best understood in the sociopolitical environ-
ment of the country itself. Thus some preliminary factual infor-
mation about each country is provided, including its political
structure, judicial apparatus and functioning, and the nature and
frequency of crimes most often committed. Where applicable, as-
sumptions are noted that partially explain the reasons for the
types of punishments imposed. Also discussed are how offend-
ers are treated following sentencing and the types of systems in
67

place to meet their individual needs or to provide necessary
counseling and vocational/technical education.
How Do Other Countries 
Sentence Their Offenders?
It is important to understand the government in a country to ap-
preciate the type of sentencing scheme it adopts to punish of-
fenders. Like the United States, each country defines its own
crimes, although there are vast differences in the types of crimes
and the names given to them. Specialized courts are designated
to deal with various categories of crime, and in that respect there
is some similarity to U.S. court practices. Indeed, several coun-
tries have elaborate court systems similar in complexity to that of
the United States. Also, some acts defined as criminal and treated
harshly elsewhere would not be considered crimes in the United
States.
Sentencing Schemes and 
Practices in Other Countries
Australia
Australia, a British Commonwealth nation, is composed of
Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania, New South Wales,
Victoria, and South Australia. Within each state are shires, the
equivalent of U.S. counties, and within each state, local commu-
nities may pass their own laws and ordinances, such as traffic en-
forcement and public order laws (Biles 2005).
Crimes in Australia are defined as any conduct prohibited
by law that may result in punishment (Australian Institute of
Criminology 2005a). Crimes may be felonies, misdemeanors, or
minor offenses, with most being indictable or nonindictable. In-
dictable offenses, like U.S. felonies, are tried in superior courts;
some may require juries. The vast majority of Australian offend-
ing, however, involves nonindictable offenses that are heard and
decided in magistrate’s local courts.
The minimum age of criminal responsibility is seven years.
Persons under age seven are not accountable. Persons age sixteen
or older can be tried in an adult court, but there is considerable
variation among the states regarding juvenile court jurisdiction,
68
Worldwide Perspective

with some states having a ten-to-seventeen age range, while oth-
ers have an eight-to-seventeen or a seven-to-sixteen age range.
Any youth over the age of seven who is charged with homicide,
however, may be tried in adult court. In some rare instances,
youths over the age of seven but under the age of eighteen can be
tried in adult court for rape or treason (ibid. 2006a).
All suspects have the right to defend themselves, or to have
an attorney appointed for them if they are indigent. A legal aid
commission oversees assignment of public defenders to indi-
gents. Guilty pleas are accepted, and judges may dispense with
trials and impose sentences whenever guilty pleas are entered.
The most serious cases are heard in court, where an accused is
entitled to a twelve-member jury trial. Plea bargaining is a form
of charge bargaining, in which some charges against suspects are
dropped in exchange for a guilty plea (ibid.). Defendants may or
may not be entitled to bail. Most defendants are granted bail,
however. Those charged with murder, robbery, or rape may be
held without bail and are remanded until trial.
The court system of Australia is hierarchical, headed by the
High Court of Australia. Each state and territory has a supreme
court. There are intermediate appellate courts, and in heavily pop-
ulated areas there are district courts and criminal courts. Rural
areas have county courts. Magistrate’s courts exist in each com-
munity. Approximately 90 percent of all criminal cases are heard
and decided in magistrate’s courts. Presentence investigation re-
ports are prepared by probation officers in more serious cases, and
victim impact statements may be appended to those reports: there
is significant victim involvement in the sentencing process. Proba-
tion officers have a great deal of influence in offender sentencing,
because they prepare presentence investigation reports and make
sentencing recommendations. Probation is used frequently as a
punishment (Commonwealth of Australia 2006).
Prisons in Australia are under the control of each state or ter-
ritory. There are no federal penitentiaries. In 2004 there were
24,171 persons in prison. Men make up some 93 percent of all in-
mates. There were 55,000 clients on probation or parole in 2005
(Department of Corrective Services 2006).
The range of penalties for crimes includes fines, probation,
and incarceration, depending upon the seriousness of the crime
and other factors. Judges may also impose home confinement,
community service, restitution, and almost every other type of
intermediate punishment available to convicted offenders in the

United States. Probation orders are also much like those in the
United States. There is no death penalty, however. Inmates in
prisons fall into the following categories: 42 percent are violent
offenders, 15 percent are drug offenders, and 40 percent are prop-
erty offenders. All prisoners have vocational and educational op-
portunities while confined. Counseling programs are offered,
including drug treatment programs. There are several security
levels in prison, and inmates may earn privileges and less secure
confinement through good conduct. Furloughs are permitted
after prisoners have served a portion of their sentence with a
good conduct report. Furloughs are weekend leaves for inmates,
enabling them to rejoin their families and look for work. The
goals of the criminal justice system are retribution, incapacita-
tion, rehabilitation, and crime prevention or deterrence. Restora-
tive justice is used, particularly among Aborigines.
Parole is also used. Inmates become eligible for parole after
serving two-thirds of their maximum sentence. In 2005, there
were approximately 220,000 persons under probation or parole
supervision. Many treatment programs are offered, including in-
dividual counseling, group work, and family counseling. Coor-
dination is emphasized, together with accurate record-keeping,
documentation, and individual evaluation and progress reports
(Australian Institute of Criminology 2005b).
Canada
Canada is a federalist country consisting of ten provinces and two
territories. The criminal code, created in 1892, has been revised
regularly. Parole was established in 1959 through the Parole Act,
and the National Parole Board was created. Each province has es-
tablished its own parole board.
Bail will be granted if someone is charged with a crime that
brings with it a prison sentence of five years or less, and if a po-
lice officer has no reasonable grounds to believe that (1) contin-
ued detention is necessary in the public interest, (2) the accused
is unlikely to attend a subsequent trial if released, and (3) the
issue of release is of such a serious nature that it should be dealt
with by a justice of the peace. The minimum age of criminal re-
sponsibility is twelve for all provinces and territories. The age of
adult criminal responsibility is eighteen in all provinces.
Crimes consist of the following: (1) summary offenses,
which are the least serious crimes (for example, public distur-
bance and traffic violations), (2) indictable offenses, or the most
70
Worldwide Perspective

serious crimes (such as murder, rape, and robbery), involving
confinement in a penitentiary for a minimum of two years, and
(3) hybrid offenses, which are dual offenses that may be prose-
cuted either as summary or indictable offenses. Summary of-
fenses are violations of localized ordinances. Following arrest,
suspects must be brought before a justice of the peace within
twenty-four hours. Pretrial detention is used infrequently. Deter-
mining bail can take up to eight days, and the amount of bail is
set by the justice of the peace.
Persons accused of crimes are entitled to counsel and the full
range of rights. Indigent defendants are provided with court-ap-
pointed counsel. Police officers often serve as prosecutors, but
private citizens may also function as prosecutors under certain
circumstances. Trials are for indictable offenses, although defen-
dants are given the choice of a jury or bench trial, and diversion
is an alternative to trial for the least serious offenses. Alternative
dispute resolution and restorative justice programs are also used.
Only about 10 percent of all criminal cases each year are heard
before a judge and jury (Cohen and Longtin 2004).
The court system consists of the Supreme Court of Canada,
which hears appeals for both summary and indictable offense
convictions. A Court of Appeal hears summary and indictable of-
fense conviction appeals. District and county courts and a
provincial courts-criminal division hear all summary offense
cases. Each province has three levels of trial court. The highest is
the superior court of criminal jurisdiction. This court has juris-
diction over all indictable offense cases. The second type of court
is the court of criminal jurisdiction. That court has jurisdiction
over all indictable offenses except for the most serious. The third
court is the summary conviction court. Youth courts are provided
for juveniles.
When defendants are convicted, trial judges impose a sen-
tence. Judges must follow maximum, minimum, and fixed
penalty guidelines provided by statute for all offense categories.
Sentencing may occur at the time of conviction, and all convic-
tions may be appealed. Judges consider the mental status of de-
fendants when imposing sentences.
The range of penalties in Canada includes life imprisonment
(there is no death penalty), deprivation of liberty for a period of
years or months, control of freedom (through probation), verbal
warnings and admonitions, community service orders, and resti-
tution and compensation (Canada Correctional Services 2005).
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?

Probation is used for most crimes. Probationers are required
to abide by various conditions set by the court, and those condi-
tions are enforced by local probation departments. Community
residential centers exist in most urban jurisdictions. The aims of
probation are rehabilitation, community reintegration, and self-
improvement. These aims are accomplished by an interconnected
network of social and vocational services, including counseling,
vocational/educational training, and other treatments. Commu-
nity service orders are frequently imposed and involve a fixed
number of community service hours. Incarceration in prison is a
last resort. Offenders who serve probationary terms and are con-
victed of new offenses may be resentenced to probation, and there
may be five or six probation sentences before those persons are ac-
tually imprisoned. The thrust of the criminal justice system is on
offender rehabilitation and reintegration.
Federal penitentiaries hold federal prisoners sentenced to
two or more years. Offenders serving shorter sentences are placed
in provincial prisons. Vocational, educational, and counseling op-
portunities are provided. Prison industries train inmates in skills
such as laundry, shoe manufacture, clothing manufacture, farm-
ing, and machine operation. Inmates lacking education are en-
couraged to work toward a G.E.D. or high school diploma, and
inmates are encouraged to take college courses where offered.
Parole is granted once offenders have served one-sixth of
their sentence. All parole actions are at the discretion of a parole
board, and both federal and provincial inmates may be released
on full or day parole. Another type of parole is through the
Mandatory Release Program. This provides for the release of in-
mates who have served two-thirds of their prison time and who
have exhibited good behavior. But those released must remain in
their communities under the supervision of parole officers until
their original sentence expires. Parole officers assist parolees in
finding employment, in obtaining housing, and in solving per-
sonal problems.
Some provinces have Temporary Absence programs. In-
mates may be released on furloughs of up to 15 days. These
leaves are preparole programs and assist inmates to locate work
and housing and support their families and dependents. Under
mandatory release, parolees are not responsible to parole boards,
but they are accountable to their parole officers.
Probation services are operated through the Adult Correc-
tions Services. In 2005 there were more than 130,000 persons on
72
Worldwide Perspective

probation. A total of 166,000 persons were under some form of
correctional service supervision, and about 10 percent of those
were women. Some 1,200 parolees were under supervision in the
various provinces in 2005 (Saskatchewan Corrections and Public
Safety 2005).
Costa Rica
Costa Rica is a constitutional democracy. Crimes in Costa Rica
are classified either as (1) delitos (crimes against life or family, sex
crimes, property damage, human rights crimes, drug trafficking,
robbery, burglary, and aggravated assault), or (2) misdemeanors
or contravention offenses (crimes against public safety, minor
property offending, and minor physical injury). Delitos crimes
carry penalties of fines and/or imprisonment for periods of one
year or longer, while misdemeanor punishments are for periods
of less than one year (Giralt 2004).
The age of criminal responsibility is eighteen years, with the
exception of persons who are close to the legal age (that is, six-
teen to seventeen) and who have committed heinous crimes.
Youths over twelve and under eighteen who have committed one
or more crimes are sent to rehabilitative facilities. The focus is en-
tirely upon rehabilitation of a vocational or educational nature.
For those under age twelve no punitive action is taken; social
agencies accept responsibility for their welfare.
The most frequently committed crimes in Costa Rica are rob-
bery and larceny. Victim’s assistance agencies have been estab-
lished to care for crime victims (Bureau of Democracy, Human
Rights, and Labor 2002). Criminal suspects may be held for
twenty-four hours before charges must be filed. Judges decide to
detain or release suspects (Williams 2003).
All those arrested have the right to an attorney, and indigent
defendants have counsel appointed for them. The Justice Depart-
ment conducts all interrogations, and confessions are admissible
against suspects. All persons accused of a crime have rights: they
are brought before a fact-finding authority, where an initial ques-
tioning period is conducted. Cases with merit proceed to the next
level, where the ministerio publico, or prosecutor, conducts an of-
ficial prosecution. Evidence is gathered, and witnesses are ob-
tained. There is no plea bargaining, and accused persons may not
accept lighter sentences in exchange for testimony against others
or for confessions. However, judges may impose lighter sen-
tences on convicted offenders if they believe that the information

73

provided by them is noteworthy and leads to a successful prose-
cution of others. Pretrial detention exists. Bail depends on the of-
fenses alleged, the person’s prior criminal record, the reliability
of the offender, and the impact on the community. About 85 per-
cent of all persons charged with crimes are released on bail.
Not all cases result in trials. Pretrial diversion is granted to
defendants upon a recommendation from prosecutors and with
judicial approval. Of the 103,000 cases processed in 1999, for in-
stance, about 26 percent were dismissed. Pretrial diversion was
recommended in 5 percent of those cases, while the others re-
sulted in minor penalties including home confinement and fines.
The court system is multileveled, the highest court being the
Supreme Court, or Salas Corte Suprema de Justicia. Several courts
of appeal hear appeals from lower courts. The lowest courts con-
sist of Alcaldias, which handle misdemeanor cases in which pun-
ishments are of less than three years. The next higher courts are
the Juzgados, or courts of First Instance. These deal with crimes in
which penalties are for more than three years. The Tribunal Supe-
rior and the Supreme Tribunal are courts of appeal for lower
courts as well as trial courts for felonies. In 2000 there were 103 Al-
caldia courts, 84 Juzgados courts, 10 Tribunal Superior courts, and
1 Supreme Court.
When a defendant is found guilty, a judge or panel of judges
imposes a sentence. Sentences are determined by the penal code.
Sentencing hearings are conducted and involve input from social
workers, clergy, psychologists, and other professionals. The range
of penalties includes fines, imprisonment, and house arrest. Most
crimes carry one- to twenty-five-year sentences, although longer
sentences may be imposed. There is no death penalty. Fines are
correlated with the offender’s income, and offenders have 15 days
to pay their fines or they will be imprisoned.
There were 2,500 to 4,000 persons in prisons and local jails in
2005. Costa Rica keeps no records of the characteristics of its in-
mate population. Inmates may earn time off for good behavior up
to 50 percent of their maximum sentence. Determination of who
should receive parole is through judicial referrals of cases to the
Criminology Institute, where a criminological diagnosis of each in-
mate is made. For first offenders, early release may be earned after
serving 6 months and receiving reports of good conduct. Judges
may impose any program conditions as parole requirements. The
report from the Criminology Institute is important and is like a
presentence investigation report (United Nations 2000).
74
Worldwide Perspective

Inmates do not have to work while confined, although they
are encouraged to do so. Vocational and educational training are
provided and may prepare compliant inmates for community
reintegration. Prisoners have access to group therapy sessions,
anger management training, counseling, educational and voca-
tional training, television sets, and radios, and they have the right
to possess a certain amount of personal property. Conjugal and
family visits are permitted on a regular basis. Medical care and re-
ligious services are provided.
Probation does not exist, although judges may suspend crim-
inal proceedings against defendants. Divertees are placed on sus-
pension for short periods, and their cases may be dismissed when
their suspension period is complete (Costa Rica National Assem-
bly 2005).
Great Britain
The government of Great Britain consists of the monarchy, Par-
liament, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons; laws
are derived largely from common law. Defendants have a full
range of rights, and indigent defendants have court-appointed
counsel. Plea bargaining is an accepted practice, and about 50
percent of all criminal cases are concluded through guilty pleas
(Phillips, Cox, and Pease 2004). The age of criminal responsibility
is ten years, and children between the ages of ten and seventeen
are brought before a youth court if charged with a criminal of-
fense. Persons eighteen or older are under the jurisdiction of
adult courts.
Crimes are classified into three categories: (1) summary of-
fenses (for example, public intoxication, mischief, public disor-
der, and other nuisance offenses), (2) indictable offenses (such as
rape, murder, robbery, and assault), and (3) hybrid offenses, the
seriousness of which is determined by prosecutorial discretion.
According to the 2004 British Crime Survey, a victimization report,
there were 11.7 million crimes in that year (Nielson 2005).
Summary offenses are usually tried in magistrate’s courts,
while more serious offenses are tried in Crown Courts. There are
approximately one hundred Crown Courts in different jurisdic-
tions in Great Britain. Juries may hear the more serious cases, al-
though bench trials are pervasive. Juries consist of twelve
persons, and guilt must be established beyond a reasonable
doubt. A conviction in a magistrate’s court is appealable to the
Crown Court. Appeals of convictions in Crown Courts are made
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?
75

to the Court of Appeal Criminal Division. In Crown Courts,
guilty verdicts have sentences imposed by judges.
Sentencing hearings are preceded by an order for a presen-
tence report, prepared by the Probation Service. Judges may fol-
low presentence recommendations, or they may impose
sentences at their discretion.
Punishments range from verbal warnings and fines to incar-
ceration, depending upon the seriousness of the offense. More
than 80 percent of all convictions result in fines. Community ser-
vice orders or community work, and probation supervision, may
also be ordered. Victim compensation or restitution orders may
be imposed as well. About 20 percent of all defendants found
guilty of indictable offenses are incarcerated. Such sentences may
be suspended or begun immediately, at judicial discretion. There
is no death penalty (British Home Office 2006).
Criminal proceedings are commenced with arrests and the
filing of charges. Prosecutors may defer prosecution for up to 6
months, and they may discharge defendants at their discretion
based on the defendant’s conduct. Some offenses may be di-
verted to a mediation process. The aim of mediation is restitution
or restoration.
A speedy trial provision exists wherein criminal defendants
must be tried within 70 days of being charged with a crime. Bail is
granted to those entitled to bail, but it may be denied to those con-
sidered a societal risk or who are likely to flee to avoid prosecution.
The range of penalties includes unconditional discharges, in
which defendants are simply fined. Incarceration may be imposed
for more serious criminal convictions. Early release may be
granted to certain inmates, and a parole board grants or denies
parole. All conditional prison releasees are referred to as proba-
tioners. In 2005, 8 percent of all charges resulted in discharge or
dismissal; 71 percent resulted in standard probation, 13 percent in
community sentences (probation), and 7 percent in incarceration.
In 2005 there were 76,000 inmates; less than 10 percent were
women. Inmates have various amenities, including television
and radio. They receive regular health care, educational oppor-
tunities, vocational training, religious worship, and visitation
privileges from family or friends.
Probation may be imposed in different ways, and inmates
leaving prison or receiving a community sentence will be put on
probation and supervised. Thus offenders are placed on proba-
tion whenever:
76
Worldwide Perspective

1. Judges sentence them to a community sentence, as an al-
ternative to prison.
2. The parole board decides that the offender can be re-
leased short of serving the full term of imprisonment.
3. The offender is automatically released from prison after
serving three-fourths of the original sentence.
Being on probation involves conditions. If one or more con-
ditions are violated, violators face revocation of their probation
and possible return to prison. Clients must report regularly to su-
pervising probation officers and attend supervision sessions. If
sessions are missed, a warning will be issued to the violator.
Missing two or more sessions means that clients will be sent to
court and possibly imprisoned. Other probation requirements in-
clude the following:
1. Completing community sentences successfully.
2. Completing alcohol or drug treatment programs.
3. Staying in a probation hostel.
4. Staying away from the area where the crime was 
committed.
Community sentences may include compulsory work, such
as cleaning up local areas and removing graffiti, which may en-
able offenders to acquire new skills while repaying societal debts;
community rehabilitation, which may involve regular meetings
with probation officers to facilitate behavioral changes; and cur-
fews, whereby offenders must stay indoors at certain times
under a form of house arrest or home confinement. The aims of
sentencing include protecting the public, punishing offenders, re-
ducing crime, rehabilitating offenders, and repairing harm to so-
ciety by means of restorative justice. Sentences by judges are
influenced by the seriousness of the offense, one’s remorseful-
ness, and the defendant’s prior record.
In 2005 probation officers supervised approximately 250,000
offenders. About 70 percent of those probationers were serving
community sentences and had not been imprisoned. Consistent
with an emphasis upon rehabilitation is the use of better offender
management methods, including home confinement and elec-
tronic monitoring.
In 2006 the Sentencing Guidelines Council set forth sentenc-
ing procedural guidelines for all courts. These are the National
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?
77

Allocation Guidelines, which assist courts in dealing with all
criminal cases. Their purpose is to provide judges with guidance
in sentencing. Their creation suggests strong governmental inter-
est in formalizing and systematizing the sentencing process (Sen-
tencing Guidelines Council 2006).
France
The government of France is highly centralized. There are both
criminal and civil justice systems serving twenty-two regions
and 36,000 municipalities. Since 1994, France has established new
criteria for different crime categories. The three major crime cat-
egories are as follows:
1. Contraventions: petty offenses associated with fines (for
example, minor traffic offenses, breaches of bylaws,
minor assaults, and noise offenses).
2. Delits: offenses of greater importance and possibly re-
quiring confinement for periods ranging from a half-
year to ten years and possible fines (for example, theft,
manslaughter, assault, drug offenses, and driving while
intoxicated).
3. Crimes: the most serious offenses, punishable by impris-
onment of from ten years to life and possible fines (there
is no death penalty in France) (for example, murder,
rape, robbery, kidnapping, or abduction).
The French court system consists of the Police Court, which
deals with summary offenses or minor violations of the law (such
as reckless driving or public intoxication), and maximum fines of
25,000 francs or confinement of 2 months or less in a jail. The next
higher court is the Correctional Court, with jurisdiction over all
crimes involving a maximum punishment of ten years in prison.
A third court is the Assize Court, in which life sentences may be
imposed upon conviction. Juries of nine persons are used in the
most serious cases. The numbers of jurors in these courts range
from six to twelve, depending upon the jurisdiction. In 2006 there
were more than 7,000 judges in France (Borricand 2006).
Serious criminal investigations are conducted by public
prosecutors under the control of the Public Ministry. Accusations
are made after investigation, once a suspect has been identified.
Defendants are considered innocent until proven guilty, and all
defendants are entitled to court-appointed counsel. Bail is op-

tional according to the seriousness of the offense, and judges
make bail decisions. The burden of proof is upon the state. If
there is insufficient evidence against the accused, the case is
dropped (Clavier 1997).
Plea bargaining does not exist in France. Persons accused of
crimes cannot plead guilty. They may confess to crimes, but those
confessions are used as evidence against them. When defendants
are found guilty, judges impose sentences using broad sentenc-
ing powers. The death penalty does not exist, although life sen-
tences may be imposed. All cases are individualized, depending
on the evidence presented and the seriousness of the offense, of-
fender attitudes, and other factors. All sentences may be ap-
pealed, and judges may impose probation at their discretion. For
custodial sentences of up to five years, probation is used most
frequently. Probation judges appoint persons to supervise proba-
tioners (Juge de l’application des peines), and probationary terms
may be ordered for up to three years.
Community orders may also be imposed, especially for
petty offenders. Such orders may involve service from 40 hours
to 240 hours. In 2006 there were more than 40,000 community
service orders issued. Fines are also imposed. Alternative pun-
ishments or creative sentencing is used for indigent defendants
who cannot pay fines.
The probation system in France supervised more than
200,000 probationers in 2006. Probationers in France are expected
to seek and maintain employment, support their families, seek
counseling and other forms of assistance (depending upon the na-
ture of their offense), and engage in productive vocational or ed-
ucational training. if necessary. Their activities are closely
monitored by probation officers who work under the jurisdiction
of the judicial probation service. Volunteers work with various of-
fenders by teaching literacy training (Bertrand 2006).
The prison population of France in 2005 was 60,000 inmates,
and the average sentence length is 10 months. Prison labor is vol-
untary, but vocational and educational activities are provided for
interested prisoners. About 20 percent of all prisoners cannot
read or write. Prison authorities have the discretion to grant par-
ticular prisoners semi-liberté, whereby they are permitted to leave
their prisons during daytime hours and work or study in their
communities. Thus there is a heavy emphasis upon community
reintegration. These measures are used to assist prisoners in
avoiding job loss and to receive medical treatment, psychological

79

counseling, or other types of assistance. Probation judges may
also grant furloughs or short-term leaves to particular inmates,
particularly those serving sentences of 12 months or less.
Parole in France commenced in 1885 as a means of reinte-
grating offenders back into society, and in 2005 approximately
7,000 paroles were granted. Parole and parole orders are granted
by the juge de l’application des peines, if the sentence being served
is less than ten years, or if the remaining time to be served is less
than three years. Full judicial hearings are held, in which paroles
are either granted or denied to parole-eligible offenders. Paroled
offenders are supervised in a manner similar to those supervised
by probation officers or social workers. Special conditions may
accompany both probation and parole programs, including cur-
fews, drug and alcohol monitoring, and residence searches. If
parolees or probationers violate one or more conditions of their
program, the program will be terminated and they will be im-
prisoned to serve their full terms. In some special cases, pardons
may be granted by the president of France.
Ghana
The government of Ghana is a multiparty parliamentary govern-
ment with a president and legislature. The legislature creates all
civil and criminal laws (Winslow 2005). Statutory law governs
most of Ghana (Ebbe 2005). The age of criminal responsibility is
eighteen, and there are five degrees of offense: (1) capital offenses,
in which the death penalty may be administered, for murder, trea-
son, or piracy, (2) first-degree felonies, punishable by life impris-
onment, for manslaughter, rape, and mutiny, (3) second-degree
felonies, punishable by up to ten years in prison, for intentional
harm to persons, perjury, and robbery, (4) misdemeanors, includ-
ing assault, theft, and official corruption, and (5) public nuisance
activities, meaning crimes punishable by either fines or various
short terms of imprisonment. Corporal punishment is not permit-
ted. No juveniles may be imprisoned, and no one under the age of
eighteen may be executed, regardless of the nature of the offense
(Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons 2006).
Defendants have many legal rights, and indigent defendants
have court-appointed counsel. Defendants may plead guilty, but
such confessions or admissions do not mean that leniency will be
granted by judges. The maximum penalty for the most serious of-
fenses is death. Any person charged with a crime that may result
in the death penalty is entitled to a trial before the High Court. For
80
Worldwide Perspective

lesser offenses, including misdemeanors, cases are tried by mag-
istrates in a summary fashion and fines are typically imposed. All
other serious cases are tried in either a Circuit Court or the High
Court. There is no plea bargaining, and there are no jury trials. Po-
lice officers who make arrests become the prosecutors and pursue
cases against their arrestees. Police officers may also give testi-
mony about the cases they prosecute.
Bail is available to all persons entitled to bail. The court sys-
tem consists of (1) the Supreme Court, consisting of a chief justice
and six other justices, (2) a Court of Appeal, having appellate ju-
risdiction over high courts and circuit courts, (3) high courts and
circuit courts, which consist of from one to three judges who sit
and decide cases, (4) district courts, which have jurisdiction to
hear local cases, and (5) customary courts, or those located in the
most rural regions.
Sentencing in Ghana is on the basis of judicial discretion, but
sentencing decisions must be unanimous if more than one judge
hears a case. The only persons having input in sentencing mat-
ters are professionals such as psychiatrists and social workers.
Medical experts may also be consulted, as well as probation offi-
cers (Ministry of Justice 2006b). The range of punishments in-
cludes fines, community service, restitution, probation, and
prison. Prison terms can be imposed from one year to life, al-
though the death penalty may be administered for the most seri-
ous crimes. Most executions have been for treason, murder, or
attempting to overthrow the government.
The number of persons under supervised probation is un-
known. Offenders who are imprisoned can be released short of
serving their full terms because of good behavior, and parole ex-
ists, with release based on good conduct. Inmates who partici-
pate in self-help programs, counseling, anger management,
vocational or educational courses, and other rehabilitative ser-
vices earn good-time credit against their maximum sentences
(United Nations 2005). The prisons are notoriously overcrowded:
in 2005, prisons designed to hold 7,500 inmates accommodated
15,000 (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 2001).
Japan
Japan has a centralized federal system of government. The crimi-
nal justice system is accusatorial, and the judicial system consists
of summary courts, family courts, district courts, and high courts,
in which decisions can be appealed from district courts. Criminal
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?
81

appeals may be made to the Supreme Court, although most ap-
peals involve constitutional issues. Summary courts are located in
towns and cities and try cases punishable only by fines. High
courts exist in all major cities, with similar jurisdiction over more
serious cases. The criminal code has set minimum and maximum
sentences for offenses in order to individualize punishments for
different offenders. Judges conduct trials and are authorized to
examine witnesses, call for evidence, and decide upon one’s guilt.
Judges may also suspend the sentences of those convicted, plac-
ing them on probation or ordering them to perform various types
of service (Conant 2004).
There are three general categories of crime: (1) crimes
against the state, (2) crimes against society, and (3) crimes against
individuals. The age of criminal responsibility is twenty. Anyone
under that age is considered a juvenile and subject to juvenile
court jurisdiction.
Whenever police officers arrest offenders, prosecutors bring
charges against them. All accused persons have rights, and indi-
gent defendants are provided with court-appointed legal counsel.
Speedy and public trials are provided. There is no plea bargain-
ing. Confessions are accepted, but prosecutors must present evi-
dence that establishes one’s guilt in court. Suspects may be
detained without bail, although bail is most frequently permitted
in the less serious cases. The range of penalties includes death,
imprisonment with labor, imprisonment without labor, fines,
short-term detention (less than 30 days), and a variety of other
penalties such as asset forfeiture. Judges may impose community
punishments such as probation in various forms with a variety of
conditions.
The Correction Bureau is responsible for administering
Japan’s prison system. There are three major types of prisons: (1)
prisons for convicted inmates who are sentenced to imprison-
ment with or without labor, (2) juvenile prisons for convicted of-
fenders under age twenty-six, with or without labor, and (3)
detention houses for unconvicted offenders, such as those await-
ing trial. The treatment of prisoners in Japanese prisons is ori-
ented toward rehabilitation and reintegration or resocialization.
Prison treatment programs are specifically tailored for each in-
mate, following a thorough classification process in which one’s
needs are determined or assessed. Prison labor, vocational train-
ing, educational course work, living guidance, counseling, learn-
ing social coping skills, and receiving various types of medical
82
Worldwide Perspective

and mental health care are all addressed. There were 83,000 per-
sons in Japanese prisons in 2005. Less than 10 percent of all in-
mates were females (National Center for Policy Analysis 2001).
Although estimates are somewhat unreliable, it is believed
that there were more than 250,000 probationers and parolees in
Japan in 2005. The responsibility for aftercare for those offenders
resides with the jurisdiction of the Rehabilitation Bureau, which
supports some 1,400 probation officers and more than 60,000 vol-
unteer probation officers.
The volunteer probation system has been used in Japan since
the 1980s. Volunteer probation officers are community volunteers
selected from their communities to assist in probationer and
parolee reintegration and rehabilitation. The ideal plan for the
volunteer probation system is for each volunteer to supervise and
work with up to five offenders, although most work with only
two at any given time. They are given the responsibility of ensur-
ing that these offenders do not reoffend, largely by offering them
assistance and guidance as well as close supervision (Japan Reha-
bilitation Bureau, Ministry of Justice 2006b).
Prison inmates become eligible for parole after serving a
portion of their sentence. Regional parole boards hear and decide
cases, and whether to release certain offenders short of serving
their maximum sentence. These parole boards may also revoke a
parole program if one or more program conditions are violated.
About 15 percent of all supervised offenders under the jurisdic-
tion of the Rehabilitation Bureau are parolees. There is a very low
recidivism rate among both probationers and parolees. Offenders
must show a great deal of remorse and meet rigorous selective
criteria before probation or parole is granted. Individualization
of offender supervision and treatment contributes significantly to
low recidivism.
Probationers and parolees are subject to periodic checks of
their employment and home, and they are obligated to observe
various behavioral requirements. All major cities have commu-
nity residential centers. These residential centers offer offenders
a variety of services, including educational and vocational train-
ing and job-seeking advice (Hashimoto 2004).
When probationers are initially sentenced to probation they
must report to the probation office, where a professional proba-
tion officer interviews them and reviews their criminal history
and problems. A special treatment plan is eventually established,
and probation officers assign probationers to volunteer probation

83

officers for supervision. Parole works similarly. Each community
residential center can accommodate up to 100 offenders, with
some variation among the different localities. More noncompli-
ant probationers and parolees will be supervised by professional
probation officers, who use more rigorous supervision methods.
Japan’s probation and parole systems utilize electronic monitor-
ing and home confinement; they have used such individualized
tracking and placement methods since the early 1990s.
The Netherlands
The Netherlands consists of the Netherlands, Aruba, and the
Netherlands Antilles. A unitary governmental structure exists
that is governed by laws embodied within the criminal or penal
code and the Code of Criminal Procedure and Special Acts. The
criminal justice system is modified regularly. A probation service
was established in 1986, and that, too, is modified periodically
(U.S. Department of State 2006).
Commission of a crime sets the criminal justice system in
motion. When suspects are arrested, accusations are made. Trials
are accusatorial processes, the purpose of which is to determine
the truth about the crime, how it occurred, and who committed
it. Only judges are permitted to ask questions of witnesses and
suspects during trials. Prosecutors and defense counsels are per-
mitted to ask a limited range of questions, although such ques-
tions are primarily supplementary. Cross-examination of
witnesses is not permitted, and lower courts follow higher court
precedents (Ministry of Internal Affairs 2006a).
Prosecutors have much power. They may keep cases from
the courts and engage in conditional waivers, or what is known
as “transaction.” Conditional waivers involve informal disposi-
tion of cases, which may include minimally restrictive condi-
tions. Transaction vests prosecutors with the authority to impose
fines in cases in which maximum sentences are up to six years.
Out-of-court monetary settlements, when they occur, conclude
cases. Plea bargaining is prohibited, but guilty pleas are accept-
able and may be used against defendants later in court. Prosecu-
tors can hold suspects for several months before bringing formal
charges against them. Their ability to interview and interrogate
suspects is unlimited, but defense counsel are restricted in the
number of contacts they have with their clients.
In 2005 the judiciary consisted of sixty-two cantonal courts,
nineteen district courts, five courts of appeal, and a supreme
84
Worldwide Perspective

court with twenty-four justices. Cantonal courts hear both civil
and criminal cases; a single judge presides in such courts. District
courts hear both civil and criminal matters, but in those courts
there are panels of three judges who hear each case. Courts of ap-
peal hear both civil and criminal cases decided in the lower dis-
trict courts. All lower-court cases are subject to appeal, and once
the Supreme Court has heard an appealed case the case is con-
cluded (Aronowitz 2005).
The range of criminal penalties includes fines, suspended
sentences, automatic release from prison after serving two-thirds
of the maximum sentence, and community service. All prohib-
ited acts are either crimes or felonies (misdrijven), or infractions or
transgressions (overtredingen). Transgressions (misdemeanors) in-
clude traffic offenses and public order offenses.
The age of criminal responsibility in the Netherlands is
twelve. Juveniles between ages twelve and eighteen are subject to
juvenile criminal laws, and youths between ages sixteen and eigh-
teen are tried in criminal courts when the cases involve murder,
robbery, or rape. Juvenile law may be applicable to persons be-
tween the ages of eighteen and twenty-one on a case-by-case basis,
according to prosecutorial discretion. All persons age twenty-one
or older are subject to adult criminal penalties, regardless of the
circumstances. The most serious crimes are punishable by impris-
onment. There is no death penalty. The maximum punishment for
the most serious offense is twenty years and/or a fine (Public and
Cultural Affairs Press 2005).
Criminals are treated in different ways. Defendants con-
victed of murder or rape may be imprisoned and then sent to a
mental institution. Sexual offenses bring time in a mental institu-
tion as a form of TBS (ter beschikking stelling). Sex offenders might
spend an indeterminate amount of time in a mental hospital,
even the remainder of their lives, should a committee believe that
they pose a serious risk to society.
The rights of defendants in the Netherlands are different
from those of U.S. citizens. Defendants may petition the court to
dismiss a case if it is not brought to trial within a short time. All
defendants are entitled to an attorney, and indigents have court-
appointed counsel. Defendants have the right to remain silent
and refrain from giving testimony.
Prosecutorial discretion determines which cases will be
tried. Judges have no discretion over prosecutors or whom they
decide to prosecute. One-third of all criminal cases go to trial,
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?
85

and two-thirds of all cases are concluded by prosecutors through
transaction or dismissal. Cases tried in court have a high convic-
tion rate of 85 percent. Defendants awaiting trial do not have an
absolute right to bail, although few defendants are kept in pre-
trial confinement.
The range of punishments available to judges includes fines,
imprisonment, detention, community service, and court-ordered
treatment. The minimum incarcerative sentence is 1 day, and
maximum sentences are fifteen years, or twenty years for murder.
Life sentences may be imposed in the most serious cases. Other
punishments may include property seizure and dispossession of
certain rights, such as the right to hold particular jobs. Prison sen-
tences of three or fewer years may be suspended, although judges
cannot suspend sentences longer than three years. Those receiv-
ing suspended sentences may be placed on probation.
The inmate population in 2005 was 15,000. Supervised release
has been offered to those inmates who have served two-thirds or
more of their sentence. Supervision is believed fundamental for an
inmate’s successful reintegration into society. Prisons have work
programs and educational facilities. More than 20,000 offenders
have obtained early release from prison during the period 2000 to
2005, and about half of those offenders are under some form of su-
pervision. Both electronic monitoring and home confinement are
used, together with community service.
The probation service supervises many offenders who are
convicted but freed without serving time in either jail or prison.
Probation supervision is minimal, probation officers being largely
brokers and educators. They provide networking services between
their offender-clients and the business community for job place-
ments. There were approximately 60,000 persons under some form
of probation supervision in 2000 (van der Linden 2000).
Norway
Norway’s government consists of three branches: legislative, ju-
diciary, and executive. The national parliament, known as the
Stortinget, passes all laws, both criminal and civil. The court sys-
tem is autonomous, and courts act independently to make indi-
vidualized decisions about defendants. All evidence submitted is
allowed, and all information about crimes is considered relevant
and given appropriate weight by the judiciary. Most judges are
lay judges who may have no legal qualifications. Some judges,
however, are professionally trained (Bygrave 1997).
86
Worldwide Perspective

All criminal laws have been codified into the penal code and
the Criminal Procedure Act. The age of criminal responsibility is
fifteen, with persons under fifteen under the jurisdiction of social
welfare agencies. The aim is to rehabilitate youths. Vocational and
educational opportunities, counseling, and other forms of assis-
tance are provided.
Crimes are divided into felonies and misdemeanors.
Felonies carry sentences of 3 months or longer in prison, while
misdemeanors have lesser punishments. Incarceration is rarely
used, since it is believed to be counterproductive to rehabilitation
and reintegration. Misdemeanors have a maximum penalty of 3
months in jail, together with fines. In 2005 there were more than
450,000 reported crimes. A third of those offenses were misde-
meanors, while the remainder were felonies.
Overseeing prosecution of all criminal offenses is the direc-
tor general of public prosecutions, or Riksadvokaten. Approxi-
mately fifty-five public prosecutors are assigned to the various
geographical jurisdictions. All public prosecutors are appointed
by the king and must have sufficient legal training. When some-
one is accused of a crime, that person has the full range of rights,
and all indigent persons are entitled to court-appointed counsel.
Persons who plead guilty may have their cases concluded in
courts of summary jurisdiction without a formal trial. Courts
may or may not involve juries. Judges decide whether defen-
dants are entitled to jury trials, and defendants are not entitled to
be present during proceedings against them. All court judgments
of guilt or innocence must be supported in writing, with a de-
tailed rationale and supporting evidence. All convicted offenders
have the right to appeal their convictions and sentences to higher
courts (Central Administration of the Correctional Service 2006).
Alternatives to trials may involve fines, or foreleggs, and they
are often assessed for traffic violations and other minor offenses.
Prosecuting attorneys have considerable discretion and may de-
cline to prosecute certain cases. In most cases involving youths
under age eighteen, even though criminal responsibility attaches
at age fifteen, municipal child welfare boards hear cases instead
of the courts. Deferred prosecution or diversion is used in some
cases. Some defendants may be required to perform community
service or have counseling or other treatments, or they may be
freed on the condition that they remain law-abiding. Half of all
criminal cases go to trial. Restorative justice is also used, and
such cases are referred to arbitration and conflict boards.

87

Courts determine sentences to be imposed upon conviction.
Victim input weighs heavily in all sentencing, and penalties may
include fines, social service, and/or imprisonment. Maximum
sentences are twenty-one years in prison. Such sentences are im-
posed for murder, rape, and serious drug offenses. Suspended
sentences are given to younger or first-time offenders, and fines
usually accompany most sentences of imprisonment or sentence
suspensions (Prison and Probation Department 2005).
Community service involves unpaid labor to the community
performed by offenders for up to 360 hours. Such community
service is imposed for crimes punishable by up to one year in
prison. Community service punishment may also involve fines.
Another punishment is detention, or forvaring, which is rarely
used. Most persons sentenced to preventive detention are recidi-
vists with a strong likelihood of reoffending.
Persons sentenced to prison may participate in rehabilitative
programs including vocational and educational training. All lev-
els of education are offered to prisoners. Prisoners have visitation
privileges with their families, as well as the right to be outdoors
for at least an hour a day. Prisoners who have served two-thirds
of their sentence are entitled to apply for parole, which is often
granted. Persons who have served 50 percent of their sentence
may also apply for early release, although that is seldom granted.
Corrections is under the Corrections Service, which oversees
the Prison and Probation Department. This department is the su-
perior authority for the Prison Service and the Probation Service.
The Prison Service is responsible for implementing custodial sen-
tences and preventive detention. There is a strong rehabilitation
emphasis for all inmates, and the Probation Service enforces
community sanctions, such as community service orders, drunk-
driving prevention programs, and early release and suspended
sentence supervision. House arrest or home confinement is used.
The goals of the Probation Service are to enforce reactions set by
the prosecuting authority and by the courts, and to enable of-
fenders to change their criminal behavior through reintegration
and rehabilitation. In 2005 there were four halfway houses,
twenty-one probation offices, and forty-two prisons under the
Correctional Service authority. Estimates are that there are ap-
proximately 35,000 persons under the supervision of the Correc-
tional Service. In 2001 there were 12,130 persons serving prison
sentences and approximately 2,100 awaiting sentencing. Some
5,500 clients were serving community sentences (ibid. 2006).
88
Worldwide Perspective

Several offense-specific treatment programs include cogni-
tive skills programs; offender substance abuse assistance and
treatment; Choices, which assists persons in proper law-abiding
decision-making; a Brotts-brytet (Stop Crime) program, aimed at
crime prevention methods; a WIN program, which is a change
program for women; a one-to-one program, which is a cognitive
activity for use in both prisons and communities that relies heav-
ily on counseling; ATV, which involves discussion groups for vi-
olent sex offenders; an anger management program; and a sexual
offenders program. The recidivism rate is less than 30 percent.
Russia
Russia is a federative state with a president. Criminal laws are
contained in the criminal code, the Criminal Procedure Code, the
Criminal Punishment Execution Code, and the Law in the Jus-
tice System. Other specialized legal codes and compendiums
exist.
The age of criminal responsibility in Russia is sixteen. Per-
sons over fourteen years of age bear criminal responsibility only
for murder, major bodily injury, rape, kidnapping, and other vio-
lent acts. Any act not included in the criminal code is not a crime.
Crimes are classified according to whether they are major or
minor. Major offenses are crimes such as rape, kidnapping, mur-
der, treason, espionage, crimes against the justice system, and all
other serious violent crimes. Minor crimes include offenses
against property, such as theft or burglary, hooliganism, and of-
fenses against public order. Another class of offense pertains to
drugs. In 2005 there were more than 4 million crimes reported
(Foreign Broadcast Information Service 2004; Nikiforov 2002).
Investigated criminal suspects are held in Special Isolation
Facilities (SIZOs). SIZOs are pretrial detention facilities. Approx-
imately 400,000 persons were held in SIZOs awaiting trial in
2005. All defendants have the right to be advised of the charges
against them. They may present evidence on their own behalf
and may be represented by counsel. Court-appointed counsel is
made available to all indigent defendants, and defendants ac-
cused of less serious crimes may deposit money for bail. Only
about 20 percent of all defendants were in pretrial detention in
2005. Judges decide upon sentences for convicted offenders, ei-
ther through a jury or bench trial. The maximum punishment is
the death penalty, and approximately sixty to seventy executions
a year are conducted (Ministry of Internal Affairs 2006b).
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?

For less serious offenses punishments include imprisonment
for indeterminate terms, fines, reforming work in lieu of prison
(community service), adverse publicity, dismissal from one’s office
or job, deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or perform
certain activities, restitution of financial damages, and confiscation
of property (asset forfeiture) (Bureau of Democracy, Human
Rights, and Labor 2001). Nearly 2 million persons were held in
Russian labor camps in 2005. About 5 percent of all prisoners in
Russia are women. Labor camps engage prisoners in various vo-
cational activities often related to agriculture, and all prisoners
confined in labor camps must work. They are paid a minimum
wage for the labor they perform. Prisoners may be given furloughs
to visit families or obtain jobs, and they may be permitted to spend
additional money on food or goods and to receive mail or parcels
from their families. Parole exists, in that through an inmate’s good
work he or she may be released into the community under super-
vision. In 2005 some cities and towns in Russia were experiment-
ing with restorative justice and community corrections
programming (Penal Reform Internationale 2005).
South Africa
The criminal justice system of South Africa applies to a culturally
diverse population. The Criminal Procedure Act of 1977 was en-
acted and amended several times subsequently. In 1991 each
province was authorized on a provincial basis to impose a com-
munity sentence for offenders not considered to pose a risk to
their community. The requirements for correctional supervision
include the following:
1. The offender does not pose a threat to the community.
2. The offender has a fixed, verifiable address.
3. The offender has a means of support so as to be finan-
cially independent.
Pre-Trial Services (PTS) are used. The aim of PTS is to assist
the courts in making bail decisions. Discretionary power to make
bail decisions rests with magistrates, and PTS provides courts
with detailed information about defendants. PTS actions help en-
sure that (1) dangerous suspects are less likely to be released on
bail, (2) petty offenders are released on bail with warnings or
granted affordable bail, (3) all accused persons are closely super-
vised while on bail, thus reducing the likelihood of witness in-
90
Worldwide Perspective

timidation or court delays caused by failure to appear, and (4) a
decrease in the sheer number of prisoners awaiting trial occurs.
Estimates are that without PTS, the number of prisoners held in
South African prisons and jails would double (Shaw 1996).
A diversion program exists to divert low-risk offenders from
the criminal justice system. The aims of diversion are these: (1) to
prevent first offenders from prolonged or frequent encounters
with the criminal justice system, (2) to promote conformity to the
laws, and (3) to prevent persons from being imprisoned. Diver-
sion is believed therapeutic as a rehabilitative action. It is re-
stricted largely to persons ages fourteen to eighteen, although
under special circumstances diversion may be granted to older or
younger offenders. Victim-offender mediation and family group
conferencing through restorative justice are also used.
Pursuant to an investigation of various parole systems in
other countries by a South African delegation in 1992–1993, the
Department of Correctional Services was charged with the super-
vision of parolees, under the authority of community corrections
personnel (Department of Correctional Services 2005). A Correc-
tional Supervision and Parole Board was established to determine
(1) definite dates of parole release of convicted offenders, (2) the
communities in which offenders should be placed, and (3) the pa-
role conditions to be followed during the parole term. These re-
quirements pertain to any convicted offenders sentenced to the
following:
1. Imprisonment for corrective training, for which purpose
they may be detained in prison for a period of two years
and may not be placed on parole until they have served
at least 12 months.
2. Imprisonment for the prevention of a crime, for which
they may be detained in a prison for a period of five
years and may not be placed on parole until at least two
and a half years of the sentence have been served.
3. Life imprisonment: Such persons may not be placed on
parole until they have served at least twenty-five years
of the sentence, although a person who is age sixty-five
may be placed on parole after having served at least fif-
teen years of the original sentence.
The Correctional Supervision and Parole Board makes both
parole and parole revocation decisions. General conditions for

persons serving terms on either probation or parole include the
following:
1. Refraining from committing criminal offenses.
2. Complying with any reasonable instructions by the
court.
3. Refraining from making any contact with particular 
persons.
4. Refraining from threatening any persons by word or 
action.
Differing levels of supervision for offenders are determined
by offense seriousness. More serious offenders are supervised
more intensively than less serious offenders. A classification sys-
tem for all offenders is in the process of being devised. The clas-
sification system assesses risks posed by offenders and also their
individual needs. Community officials are charged with super-
vising them and ensuring that they receive necessary rehabilita-
tive and reintegrative services. The following supervision
categories guide the nature of correctional supervision:
Maximum supervision cases: visited four times per month.
Medium supervision cases: visited twice per month.
Minimum supervision cases: visited once per month.
Both parole and probation may include house arrest; victim
compensation; community service; correctional programming
for treatment of drug/alcohol abuse and other problems; restric-
tions to one’s community; fixed addresses; alcohol/drug moni-
toring; searches; and/or an obligation to seek and maintain
employment (Wilkinson 1998).
Incarceration is used for those who pose the most serious
community threats. In 2005 there were 239 correctional centers.
The inmate population in 2005 was 155,800, with 3,200 of those
inmates female. The death penalty was abolished in 1995. The
number of parolees in 2005 was 31,300, while the number of pro-
bationers was 20,500 (Moatshe 2004).
South Korea
South Korea has a government consisting of an administration, a
legislature, and a judicature. The criminal justice system is highly

Worldwide Perspective

centralized, having been established by the Criminal Law of 1953
and continuously revised through 2005.
Three types of criminal offenses include the following: (1)
crimes breaching a national interest, such as rebellion, (2) crimes
breaching a social interest, such as arson, and (3) crimes breach-
ing personal interests, such as larceny, robbery, murder, and drug
offenses. Punishments are proportional to the type of crime com-
mitted. Crimes are further distinguished according to whether
they are violent crimes or property crimes (Richards 2006).
The Supreme Public Prosecutor’s Office prosecutes all crim-
inal offenses. The age of criminal responsibility in South Korea is
fourteen, although persons ranging in age from fourteen to
twenty are specially treated under juvenile laws. A youth under
age eighteen who is convicted of a criminal offense cannot be
sentenced to capital punishment or life imprisonment. Since the
early 1990s, South Korea has permitted greater citizen involve-
ment in criminal matters, including sentencing. Victims are per-
mitted to speak and give their punishment recommendations to
judges, although judges decide upon the punishment.
Bail is granted for most defendants. Suspects enjoy numerous
rights, including the right to examine evidence; the right to avoid
particular judges; the right to appeal; the right to trial by a judicial
panel; the right to confess or avoid confession; and the right to ei-
ther a private attorney or a public defender. There are no prelimi-
nary hearings, and juries are not used. Judicially appointed
prosecutors, working on behalf of the Ministry of Justice, bring
cases against defendants and have broad discretionary powers.
Prosecutors may indict, refuse to indict, or suspend indictments
against defendants (Newman 2002).
Depending upon the seriousness of their offenses, prosecutors
may or may not recommend bail for certain defendants. About 10
percent of all defendants have criminal trials; the remaining de-
fendants upon conviction are subject to a wide range of commu-
nity sanctions, including confinement in prison, jail, fines,
forfeiture, and other penalties, such as probation. Those impris-
oned may be paroled. Fines are the most frequently used punish-
ment for minor offenses.
Probation is used most frequently as a major criminal sanction.
There were 90,000 offenders in prison in 2005, and about 4 percent
of all inmates are female. All prisons provide useful labor for in-
mates to assist in their eventual rehabilitation and reintegration.

Good institutional conduct is rewarded with parole. Inmates ac-
cumulate points for good conduct, and they may become eligible
for furloughs, more progressive institutional treatment, and spe-
cial privileges. Some inmates participate in work/study release
programs.
Probation was officially used as early as 1982, but the proba-
tion system was not established until 1989. Special probation of-
fices have been created in every jurisdiction, and the probation
system is one of the most advanced in the world. The emphasis
of probation is upon education, counseling, and guidance lead-
ing to rehabilitation and societal reintegration. In 2005 there were
approximately 200,000 probationers and 70,000 parolees of dif-
ferent designations. Supervising those offenders were 495 proba-
tion officers in approximately thirty probation and parole offices
in various cities.
Probationers are subject to various probation conditions, in-
cluding community service orders and attendance center orders.
Attendance centers are designed for those with various drug and
alcohol addictions or dependencies. Participating in attendance
center activities is compulsory (Korean Institute of Criminology
2005). Probation and parole guidelines provide for the following:
1. Legal matters of observation (allowing probation offi-
cers access to a client’s premises for the purpose of mon-
itoring the client’s behavior while on probation or
parole).
2. An obligation to reside in one’s residence and remain
employed.
3. An obligation to maintain a good family relationship.
4. An obligation to obey all probation officer directives.
5. An obligation to make advance reports if traveling for
more than 1 month.
Special conditions of probation and parole may include ab-
stinence from alcohol or drugs, avoiding certain areas, and other
behavioral requirements. In 2005 more than 150,000 persons were
assisted on probation or parole with low recidivism rates.
Prospective parolees are subject to the orders of a Parole Exami-
nation Committee. This committee determines inmate eligibility
for early release. Presentence investigation reports are examined,
including an inmate’s prior living conditions, family relations,
friendships and acquaintances, and potential societal adaptability.
94
Worldwide Perspective

Interviews with prospective parolees are conducted, and those in-
terviews may include participation by victims, family members,
and other interested parties, including probation officers.
Time guidelines exist for different categories of offenders
(see Table 3.1).
Volunteer probation officers are used extensively in proba-
tioner rehabilitation. Volunteer probation officers conduct crime
prevention activities and support the activities of the probation
and parole offices. Volunteers (1) assist in crime prevention ac-
tivities in their communities, (2) counsel offenders, (3) assist of-
fenders in job searches and financial aid, and (4) comply with
other related concerns of the Minister of Justice. Volunteers work
closely with officials to minimize school violence by monitoring
and relating with juveniles more closely; providing counseling
and special instruction to those under suspension of indictment;
assisting probation officers in the guidance and supervision of
their clients; and supporting job searches, vocational training,
care, and financial aid (Chung 2006).

the criminal code. The maximum punishment in Sweden is life im-
prisonment, as there is no death penalty. The Swedish criminal jus-
tice system is accusatorial, consisting of a prosecutor who
represents the state and a defense counsel who represents defen-
dants. All criminal laws are embodied within the Swedish Penal
Code.
The age of criminal responsibility in Sweden is fifteen. Prison
sentences are not ordinarily imposed on persons under the age of
twenty-one, except under extraordinary circumstances. Sweden
does not distinguish between crimes and infractions. Most crime
is property crime, and violent crime is rare (Wikstrom and Dol-
men 2004). Defendants have the full range of constitutional rights.
All defendants are entitled to a trial in which guilt must be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt by prosecutors. There are no jury tri-
als, however, and there is no plea bargaining. All defendants who
are in jeopardy of receiving a prison sentence must stand trial, al-
though only the most serious offenses actually come to trial. Pros-
ecutors have wide discretionary powers in determining whether
charges should be brought against particular suspects. Even if
confessions are voluntarily given or obtained, prosecutors must
make a presentation to the court to show defendant guilt beyond
a reasonable doubt. A statutory maximum time for arrest and de-
tention is 48 hours.
The court system of Sweden is three-tiered. The highest
court is the Supreme Court, and the next highest court is the
Court of Appeal. Those two courts taken together are considered
the highest of three tiers. The other two tiers consist of district
courts, which are courts of general jurisdiction, and general
courts, which are similar to U.S. municipal courts. These courts
hear cases involving public order offenses, traffic violations, and
other offenses.
When a defendant is found guilty, a sentence is always im-
posed by a judge. Sentencing hearings are sometimes conducted,
and during those hearings evidence of aggravating and mitigat-
ing circumstances may be presented.
A broad range of available penalties includes probation and
imprisonment. Probation is a conditional sentence involving re-
habilitative programming. Sentences may also be suspended and
replaced with orders for counseling, community service, restitu-
tion, fines, and other sanctions. For prison sentences, the mini-
mum time to be served is 14 days. Life imprisonment may be
imposed, although fourteen to sixteen years is defined as a life
96

sentence. Judges are advised to use prison as a last resort if it is
possible to impose alternative punishments because of the indi-
vidual case circumstances. Sentences are individualized and are
proportional to the crime committed.
Probation sentences are made at the recommendation of the
prosecutor. Probation sentences are associated with crimes for
which the punishment is more severe than a mere fine. Probation
programs may include electronic monitoring, home confinement,
counseling, attending vocational/educational programs, mental
health outpatient treatment, drug abuse counseling, and other re-
quirements. Probation with conditions can last up to three years.
Fines may also be assessed. Home confinement with electronic sur-
veillance is used, and community service orders may be imposed.
Defendants under age twenty-one are placed with a social
service agency for supervision and aftercare. These sentences are
for one year, followed by two years of provisional freedom with-
out supervision. If the offender commits a new offense while on
the probationary term, however, either a new supervision period
commences or the offender is incarcerated.
There are eighty prisons in Sweden, divided into national
and local prisons. National prisons house offenders serving sen-
tences of more than one year who require additional security.
Local prisons are for offenders who are serving sentences of less
than a year. Vocational, educational, and mental health programs
and counseling are made available in all prison facilities (Proba-
tion and Parole Service 2006a). The Probation and Parole Service
is under the jurisdiction of the Prison and Probation Service
(Kriminalardsstyrelsen), which is directly answerable to the Min-
istry of Justice. The Probation and Parole Service has three major
functions:
1. To provide supervision and support for offenders sen-
tenced to probation, for offenders released from prison
on early-release programs, and for offenders sentenced
to community service orders, treatment orders, or home
detention. In the event that some offenders fail to fulfill
the demands of their programs or court orders (such as
for treatment or for contact with the probation and pa-
role office), the matter is referred to a special board, the
Probation and Parole Board, for consideration.
2. To assist the courts in determining appropriate sentences
through an assessment of the accused’s current and past
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?
97

social situation, the accused’s need of and motivation for
different forms of psychosocial treatment, the accused’s
suitability for placement in community-based programs,
and the treatments likely to affect recidivism.
3. To coordinate the provision of treatment and support
programs organized and administered by local govern-
ment bodies and voluntary organizations and, when no
appropriate programs are available in local communities,
to organize and implement programs that specifically
target criminal behavior (such as programs for violent
offenders or alcohol- and drug-related traffic offenses)
(ibid. 2006b).
Preceding any sentencing of convicted defendants, a social
inquiry report is generated, including a detailed assessment of
the person’s needs and motivation for treatment or other forms
of noncustodial care (such as community work orders or proba-
tion). Parole is an option for incarcerated offenders once they
have served at least two-thirds of their prison sentence. The Pro-
bation and Parole Board hears matters of discipline regarding in-
mates, clients on probation, or others released from prison on
parole. This board rules in all matters relating to early-release re-
quests, sanctions for misbehavior or failure to follow program
rules, and rehabilitative requirements to be met by persons sen-
tenced to probation, parole, community work orders, community
treatment orders, or home detention. The period of parole is usu-
ally one year immediately following release from prison. During
that period the parolee is expected to have continuous contact
with a parole officer. Parolees must keep their supervising offi-
cers informed as to their whereabouts, residence, employment,
and means of financial support. Any misconduct occurring dur-
ing the period may be grounds for revoking the parole program.
After the period of parole has been served, the remainder of the
prison sentence, whatever it may have originally been, is sus-
pended or remitted (Department of Corrections 2006b).
The board may also rule in matters of extending the period
of supervision if warranted by the facts or revoking the program
for the remaining period of the incarceration. Sometimes parole
is only partially revoked, for periods such as 1 month. If parole is
to be revoked in its entirety, the matter is referred to district
courts for further action. The board also rules in matters of treat-

ment outside of the prison system for inmates currently serving
prison sentences, and the board hears offenders’ appeals of deci-
sions made by the Prison and Probation Service. The rate of re-
cidivism for both probationers and parolees is quite low, being
under 50 percent.
Thailand
Thailand has a president and a Constitutional Court. It is consid-
ered a constitutional monarchy with seventy-six provinces, and
courts of justice have jurisdiction over all criminal and civil cases.
The highest court is the Supreme Court of Justice. Lesser courts
include courts of appeals and courts of the first instance, basic
trial courts. The National Assembly makes laws, while provincial
officials and the police enforce the laws (ibid. 2006a).
In 2005 there were approximately 650,000 crimes reported,
with nearly 300,000 defendants. Thailand distinguishes between
violent crime (for example, murder, robbery, and kidnapping),
crimes against the person (such as murder, assault, and rape),
property crimes (for example, theft, blackmail, possession of stolen
goods, and vandalism), interesting crimes (for example, motorcy-
cle theft, car theft, cattle theft, taxi robbery, cheating, and fraud),
and victimless crimes (such as gambling, pornography, prostitu-
tion, and narcotics offenses).
Defendants are entitled to know the charges being filed
against them, and a presumption of innocence exists. Defendants
have a right to a lawyer, and most defendants are entitled to bail.
Prosecutors bring cases against defendants (Bureau of East Asian
and Public Affairs 2005). Defendants may also be held in pretrial
detention for up to 60 days: about 25 percent of those in Thai pris-
ons and jails are pretrial detainees. There is no trial by jury. Judges
decide cases based on the evidence presented. Two or more
judges may sit and decide more complex or serious cases. There is
no time limit governing how long trials last, and some trials may
go on for years. Indigent defendants are entitled to publicly ap-
pointed counsel (Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor
2006b). Maximum penalties include death by lethal injection, as
the result of a 2001 law. However, persons under the age of eigh-
teen cannot receive the death penalty. All sentences are indeter-
minate. Furthermore, all death sentences are appealable. The
number of executed offenders is not large. Between 1997 and
2004, there were forty-eight executions, with only four executions
How Do Other Countries Sentence Their Offenders?
99

in 2004 (Bureau of Rehabilitation, Department of Corrections
2005). There were 162,000 prisoners in Thailand in 2005.
Thailand has also established various community correc-
tions programs aimed at offender rehabilitation and reintegra-
tion. The aims of these programs are to provide public protection
by keeping offenders in custody or under close supervision, and
to aid in the prevention of recidivism. The responsibilities and
mission of community corrections are to:
1. Provide a level of supervision and custody that will
offer maximum protection to the community.
2. Rehabilitate convicted offenders in order to achieve a
successful adjustment upon their return to the society.
3. Provide various alternative programs for convicted 
offenders.
4. Provide an institutional environment that is consistent
with UN standards, with minimum rules for the treat-
ment of prisoners and related recommendations to the
extent that existing circumstances allow.
5. Reduce overcrowding by encouraging the use of various
alternative nonimprisonment programs for offenders
who are not suited for institutional confinement.
6. Promote the knowledge of correctional techniques
through systematic evaluation and research.
A definitive community corrections system has not been
fully established. Much of the rehabilitation and reintegration
that occurs takes place within prison systems. A five-year plan
to revise and upgrade the Department of Corrections, with the
overall goal to become an outstanding agency among Asian
countries, was adopted in 2004. The mission of the Department
of Corrections is to take offenders into custody and equip them
with professional skills, rehabilitating them through meaningful
and effective activities. Other objectives include helping in-
mates acquire professional skills, overcome their drug addic-
tions, create better citizens among inmates, and focus activities
in prisons more on learning than on punishment; using better
governance or leadership in prison administration and opera-
tion; and using innovative treatment philosophies in inmate
management and improvement. A later 2006 strategic plan in-
volved the following:
100
Worldwide Perspective

1. Improving management and leadership skills of prison
directors.
2. Improving human resource management for the Depart-
ment of Corrections.
3. Improving the welfare system for officers.
4. Establishing consistent standards for all prisons and cor-
rectional institutions.
5. Providing secure custody for high-profile offenders.
6. Renovating prison infrastructure and improving secu-
rity systems.
7. Seeking greater partnerships in corrections and commu-
nity justice.
A Probation Department exists, funded by the Ministry of
Justice, and about 97 percent of all offenders receive suspended
sentences. Many of these offenders are placed on probation. That
sentence is an acceptable alternative to prison, as it reduces the
amount of prison overcrowding. Two agencies coordinate proba-
tioner supervision. One is the Adult Probation Service, which
oversees adult probationers. The other is responsible for super-
vising youthful offenders and is called the Observation and Pro-
tection Center.
To be eligible for probation offenders must be facing prison
for three years or less, and the present conviction offense must
not have been committed while the offender was already on pro-
bation. Probationers will be supervised by probation officers as
well as volunteer probation officers. Volunteer probation officers
are recruited from among community residents and assist of-
fenders in becoming rehabilitated and reintegrated into their
communities. Halfway houses were created in 1995 for those re-
leased on probation or parole.
No precise figures about the numbers of inmates on parole
are available. Inmates have usually served flat time or whatever
prison sentences they receive, although some prisoners are re-
leased short of their full terms either through royal pardons or
sentence commutations. All prisons have a prerelease center.
These centers offer services for those offenders about to be re-
leased into their communities. They are referred to as temporary
prisons and have minimum security. Most prisoners receive agri-
cultural training and other special services to assist them in be-
coming more law-abiding.

Chronology
A
general chronology of significant events in the history of
sentencing and a general timeline are presented below. This
chronology lists leading U.S. Supreme Court cases that can
be found in Chapter 6, where they are discussed in greater 
detail.
1868–
The Code of Lipit-Ishtar (earliest known codifier of law
in Sumer) is created, the earliest known codification of
laws pertaining to criminal acts.
1792–
The Code of Hammurabi (Babylonian code of laws,
both criminal and civil, involving punishments for both
civil and criminal offenses) is established.
100 BC– Roman centurions are established to enforce criminal
laws and regulate citizen conduct.
AD 900
King Alfred adopts mandatory punishments in En-
gland. The Frumentarii are created, investigative, detec-
tive-like individuals appointed to investigate crimes
and conduct criminal interrogations in the Roman 
Empire.
1066
The Norman Conquest results in the frankpledge sys-
tem and early vestiges of crime control. Constables are
appointed. Early versions of private police emerge to
control citizens and to conduct crime prevention tasks.
107
1857 BC
1750 BC
AD 200

1200–
Reeves (chief law enforcement officers) are appointed
for shires (counties) by the king of England for law en-
forcement purposes.
1557
Bridewell Workhouse is established. Workhouses house
common criminals and were known for exploiting their
labor for varying fees by leasing them to mercantile in-
terests in the community.
1630–
Watchmen are appointed for crime prevention pur-
poses; shouts and rattles (noisemakers) are used to alert
rural citizens to theft and other crimes.
Early 
Philadelphia and other cities appoint volunteers for
crime prevention patrols.
1748
Henry Fielding establishes thief-takers in London,
fleet-of-foot runners who could chase down thieves,
capture them, and bring them to justice.
1754
Sir John Fielding creates the Bow Street Runners, paid
officers similar to thief-takers, to chase and capture
criminals.
1773
The first state prison is created in the United States in
Simsbury, Connecticut, and is called Newgate Prison.
The site has been an abandoned copper mine.
1787
The Philadelphia Society for Alleviating the Miseries of
the Public Prisons is established. Citizens and philan-
thropists seek to improve jail conditions and assist in-
mates in learning how to read and write. Religious
instruction is imparted.
1790
Walnut Street Jail is constructed in Philadelphia. The fa-
cility separated women and children from adult men.
The congregate system was established, and vocational
and educational training for confined persons were
stressed. Solitary confinement was introduced.
1792
The Pennsylvania System is created, consisting of nu-
merous prison reforms. Corporal punishment is abol-

ished for most offenses, and hard labor, prisoner wages,
and rehabilitative efforts are established.
Patrick Calquhoun emphasizes professionalism among
English officers and stresses education and strict orga-
nizational principles for law enforcement.
1825
Auburn Penitentiary is established; the tier system is
created, separating prisoners according to the serious-
ness of their offense; and the silent system is observed.
The congregate system is copied from Walnut Street Jail
in Philadelphia.
1829
Eastern State Penitentiary is established in Cherry Hill,
Pennsylvania. The institution promotes strict regimen-
tation: prisoners march in lockstep, close-order drill,
and they are hooded so they cannot see each other.
They are denied visitors and reading material.
The Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 is established,
strongly promoted by Sir Robert Peel. The result is a
paramilitary force designed to control crime in London
and other cities; professionalism is stressed. The Metro-
politan Police of London are established. This organiza-
tion demands professionalism, physical and mental
alertness, and educational qualifications.
1840–
Boston, New York, Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia,
New Orleans, and Newark adopt law enforcement or-
ganizational principles similar to those of the Metro-
politan Police of London.
1850–
Tickets of leave are devised by Sir Walter Crofton in Ire-
land as an early version of parole. Captain Alexander
Maconochie from Scotland shares his ideas about the
mark system, a forerunner of good-time credit later
used to reward U.S. prisoners and earn them time off
their maximum sentences.
1870
The National Prison Association is formed in Cincin-
nati, Ohio. Rutherford B. Hayes, future U.S. president,
is declared president of the organization, later to be

named the American Correctional Association. This or-
ganization shares ideas with those in other countries re-
lating to prisons and the use of parole as early
community supervision. Rehabilitation is stressed.
1876
Elmira Reformatory is constructed. This is an experi-
mental facility created to rehabilitate offenders by of-
fering vocational programming and other forms of
instruction and education; it uses parole and other
early-release methods as incentives to encourage pris-
oners to participate in rehabilitative and reintegrative
programming.
1878
The first probation law is enacted in Massachusetts.
1880–
New York adopts a Persistent Felony Offender law
whereby repeat offenders are subject to enhanced pun-
ishments at judicial discretion. Habitual offender or
chronic offender statutes are passed in various states.

ing prison construction for Atlanta, Georgia (1902), and
Fort Leavenworth, Kansas (1906), McNeil Island, Wash-
ington (1909).

The National Conference on Criminal Law and Crimi-
nology is convened, and positivist criminologists are
encouraged to consider individualization of treatment
and various alternative causes of criminality in their
recommended treatments for criminals.
1911
Roscoe Pound (1870–1964), a jurist, scholar, and former
dean of the Harvard Law School, emphasizes greater
need for individualization of punishment and encour-
ages states to adopt individualized programs.
1910–
Psychological screening devices are used for the first
time to separate prisoners into different cell blocks in
state and federal prisons.
1920
Inmate classification schemes are devised to separate
prisoners into minimum-security, medium-security,

1942
All states have parole systems.
1950s
Mandatory minimum sentences are imposed in various
jurisdictions for narcotics offenses.
1950–

North Carolina v. Pearce is decided; portions of sentences
served for a crime must be credited toward time served
if judges impose harsher sentences in retrials and new
convictions for the same offense; furthermore, any

unexplained additional punishment for a new convic-
tion in a retrial is a violation of due process rights and
unconstitutional.
1970
All states and the federal government adopt indetermi-
nate sentencing; parole boards determine the early re-
lease of sentenced offenders.
The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Con-
trol Act is passed, repealing all mandatory sentencing
penalties.
1971
The National Commission on Reform of Federal Crim-
inal Laws recommends classification and grading of all
offenses and authorized sentences; it calls for greater
uniformity in the application of laws.

ing fifteen-year mandatory minimum sentences for
drug trafficking.
1975
Yale Law School advocates the creation of a commis-
sion to issue sentencing guidelines, appellate review of

1976
Maine abolishes parole.
The Parole Commission and Reorganization Act is

1977
California adopts a determinate sentencing scheme, re-
placing its indeterminate sentencing scheme; early re-
lease of offenders is governed by good-time credit
accumulation rather than by a parole board.
1978
The Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission is
formed and develops the state’s first presumptive
guidelines system. This system is widely copied by
other states; also, truth-in-sentencing laws are created
whereby offenders serve at least two-thirds of their sen-
tence before becoming parole-eligible.
112
Chronology
1969
(cont.)

Simpson v. United States is decided; the compounding of
sentences is unconstitutional where overlapping statutes
exist and where a single transaction of a crime occurs.
1980–
The Megargee Inmate Typology is constructed to seg-
regate inmates into various degrees of risk or danger-
ousness.
1981
Bullington v. Missouri is decided; in capital cases, first
trials resulting in sentences of life imprisonment that
are subsequently reversed cannot be followed by sen-
tences of the death penalty in subsequent trials and
convictions for the same offense; a subsequent trial can-
not result in a punishment greater than that imposed by
the first in a capital case.
1982
The Pretrial Services Act is passed by Congress, pro-
viding for pretrial services in all federal districts.
1983
Forty out of fifty states pass mandatory minimum sen-
tences to deter criminals from offending.

federal district courts to consider one’s dangerousness
to the community in setting bail.
The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, also called the
Comprehensive Crime Control Act, is passed by Con-
gress. It authorizes the creation of the U.S. Sentencing
Commission, which is charged with rewriting existing
federal criminal statutes and implementing them in Oc-
tober 1987.
Arizona v. Rumsey is decided; life sentences imposed for
capital offenses cannot be changed in retrials to death
penalty sentences; a subsequent trial cannot result in a
punishment greater than that imposed by the first pun-
ishment in a capital offense case.
AIMS (Adult Inmate Management System) is created
by Herbert C. Quay.
Chronology

1985–
An I-Level Classification System (Interpersonal Maturity
Level Classification System) is devised, based on devel-
opmental and psychoanalytic theories; risk-assessment
devices are used for I-Level classification purposes.
1985
Ake v. Oklahoma is decided; if the defendant’s sanity is
at issue and the state has made a psychiatric examina-
tion of an indigent defendant, the defense is entitled to
a government-funded independent psychiatric evalua-
tion for the effective defense of the accused.
1986
Batson v. Kentucky is decided; prosecutorial use of
peremptory challenges to create all-white juries is con-
sidered discriminatory and unconstitutional.
McMillan v. Pennsylvania is decided; under mandatory
minimum sentencing laws, it is not necessary for juries
to make a factual determination of punishment; fur-
thermore, the standard of proof may be “preponder-
ance of the evidence” and not “beyond a reasonable
doubt” to make a factual determination in imposing a
mandatory minimum sentence; mandatory minimum
sentencing laws are constitutional.
Congress enacts laws pertaining to firearm, drug, and
sex offenses, as well as to repeat offenders.
The Anti-Drug Abuse Act is passed, requiring drug-re-
lated mandatory minimum sentences.
1987
The U.S. sentencing guidelines are implemented. Fed-
eral judges are obligated to sentence offenders accord-
ing to sentencing guidelines; judicial discretion is
curbed; opposition to the guidelines exists among
about a third of all federal district court judges.
Sumner v. Shuman is decided; mandatory death penal-
ties for any capital offense are unconstitutional because
aggravating and mitigating factors cannot be consid-
ered in a bifurcated trial proceeding.
114
Chronology
1990

1988
Maynard v. Cartwright is decided; in capital cases when
judges give juries instructions, they must be precise in
articulating aggravating and mitigating circumstances
that the jury may consider; judges may not use uncon-
stitutionally vague phrases such as “especially heinous,”
“atrocious,” or “cruel” when advising juries which fac-
tors to consider as aggravating or mitigating ones.
Mills v. Maryland is decided; jury instructions in capital
cases in which judges lead jurors to believe that they
must be unanimous in their agreement as to any miti-
gating factors, otherwise they must impose the death
penalty, strongly imply mandatory death penalties
under certain circumstances; thus such jury instruc-
tions are unconstitutional; jurors must consider all mit-
igating evidence as well as aggravating evidence in
deciding whether to recommend the death penalty.
The Anti-Drug Abuse Act is amended to increase sen-
tences for drug offenses.
The Omnibus Anti-Drug Abuse Act is passed, provid-
ing for five- to twenty-year mandatory minimum sen-
tences for drug offenses.
1989
Mistretta v. United States is decided; a constitutional
challenge alleging violation of the separation of powers
doctrine results from some federal judges serving on
the U.S. Sentencing Commission and rewriting federal
criminal laws; lawmaking is a legislative job, not a ju-
dicial one; despite the fact that judges were on the sen-
tencing commission making changes in punishments
for violating federal criminal laws, that does not affect
the constitutionality of the commission’s decision-mak-
ing integrity, according to an 8 to 1 U.S. Supreme Court
vote on the issue, upholding the constitutionality of the
sentencing guidelines.
Teague v. Lane is decided; prosecutorial use of peremp-
tory challenges must be proved by a defendant to be

discriminatory; also, subsequent claims about the use
of peremptory challenges declared to be discriminatory
may not be applied retroactively to prior cases in which
such prosecutorial conduct is alleged.
1990
Blystone v. Pennsylvania is decided; weighing aggravat-
ing and mitigating circumstances in deciding whether
to recommend the death penalty is not unconstitutional.
Supervised home release is approved.
1991
Braxton v. United States is decided; government prose-
cutors may not enhance a sentence based on implied
stipulations under plea agreements to unproved more
serious charges; prosecutors must prove all offense ele-
ments in court before a jury in order to use such of-
fenses as sentence enhancements; stipulations to acts
committed and where intent to willfully commit an il-
legal act is denied are insufficient grounds to impose
harsher sentences.
Harmelin v. Michigan is decided; mandatory life sen-
tences for convictions for possessing and distributing
large quantities of drugs are not disproportional to the
seriousness of the offense, and thus one’s due process
rights are not violated.
Lankford v. Ohio is decided; judges’ personal feelings
about the punishment to be imposed are not to be con-
sidered in capital cases, particularly when aggravating
and mitigating factors are not considered by a jury;
judges may not overrule juries who recommend life im-
prisonment and impose the death penalty where ag-
gravating and mitigating factors have not been
weighed or considered.
1993
Deal v. United States is decided; convicted offenders
may have their sentences for instant offenses enhanced
because of previous crimes committed, even though
they may not have been caught and convicted of those
offenses; escaping apprehension and conviction for

prior crimes may factor into sentence enhancements for
current convictions and sentences.
Smith v. United States is decided; separate and enhanced
sentencing for firearms possession during the commis-
sion of a felony is constitutional as long as the firearm
was used in the present conviction offense.
United States v. Dunnigan is decided; convicted offend-
ers who have committed perjury during their trials
may have their sentences enhanced because of perjured
testimony; self-incrimination is not a defense for com-
mitting perjury.
Stinson v. United States is decided; the U.S. Sentencing
Commission may change statutory language so that
harsher punishments may be imposed, and such statu-
tory language is binding on federal district court judges
when sentencing offenders.
Arave v. Creech is decided; in capital cases if mitigating
and aggravating factors are considered and the death
penalty is imposed, it is not unconstitutional for judges
to use phrases such as “utter disregard” or “cold-
blooded pitiless slayer” in depicting offenders follow-
ing a jury’s recommendation of the death penalty.
Washington State passes a three-strikes-and-you’re-out
law, providing for life imprisonment after three felony
convictions.
1994
The Crime Bill is passed by Congress, establishing
truth-in-sentencing reforms. It is modeled on the fed-
eral system whereby sentenced inmates must serve 85
percent of their sentence to become parole-eligible. The
bill is also known as the Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act.
California adopts three-strikes-and-you’re-out laws
aimed at deterring offenders; the state revises this law
in subsequent years as inmate populations grow.
Chronology
117

Caspari v. Bohlen is decided; double jeopardy does not
occur, even in retrials for noncapital offenses, if previ-
ous convictions against defendants are used for sen-
tence enhancements in retrials even though they were
not mentioned or used in first trials.
Custis v. United States is decided; convictions for state
offenses may be used to enhance sentences for federal
crimes under the Armed Career Criminal Act.
United States v. Granderson is decided; U.S. sentencing
guidelines pertain only to sentences of probation and in-
carcerative terms, not to probation revocation decision-
making.
1996
Koon v. United States, Powell v. United States (same case)
are decided; both statutory and nonstatutory factors
may be considered in determining the level of the of-
fense severity; also, guideline departures, either up-
ward or downward, are permitted where judges write
a rationale for their departures; this effectively made
guidelines generally applicable and not fixed and im-
movable points from which federal district court judges
could depart.
California modifies its three-strikes-and-you’re-out
sentencing scheme to delineate between violent and se-
rious felonies and less serious felonies with proportion-
ally less severe punishments; this change is to reduce
incarceration rates among California prisons.
Melendez v. United States is decided; this case involves
the recommendation from government prosecutors to
decrease Melendez’s sentence below the mandatory
minimum sentence provided by law; the U.S. Supreme
Court holds that no such departure is allowed unless
recommended by prosecutors and approved by the
sentencing federal district court judge.

Kansas v. Hendricks is decided; sex offenders may be sub-
ject to extended commitment in civil institutions follow-

are determined to pose a continuing risk to society.
O’Dell v. Netherland is decided; U.S. Supreme Court de-
cisions cannot be retroactively applied to previous
cases in which convictions have been obtained.
United States v. Gonzales is decided; mandatory sen-
tences arising from federal convictions may be used to
enhance state convictions and sentences; federal courts
may authorize either concurrent or consecutive sen-
tences for federal convictions to accompany state con-
victions and sentences.
The U.S. Parole Commission is phased out, and super-
vised releasees are created, who are persons released
early from prison.
1998
Muscarello v. United States is decided; carrying a firearm
in a glove compartment or trunk of one’s car during the
commission of a felony can be charged as a separate of-
fense and subject to mandatory sentencing.
1998–
Growing emphasis is placed on the importance of inmate
re-entry into society through preparole programming
and postrelease programming; treatments involve indi-
vidual and group counseling, vocational/educational in-
struction, group homes, job placement assistance, and
community collaboration to minimize rejection of newly
released inmates and facilitate their reintegration, ulti-
mately reducing their potential for recidivism.
1999
Jones v. United States is decided; if defendants are sub-
ject to being charged with multiple offenses, those of-
fenses must be charged; otherwise, subsequent
convictions on one of those charges cannot be enhanced
because of uncharged offenses; without a jury to hear
and consider guilt in other offenses, those other of-
fenses have no bearing on the instant conviction of-
fense, and subsequent sentence enhancements are
unconstitutional.

2000
United States v. Johnson is decided; supervised release
periods for convicted offenders are unaffected by sub-
sequently held invalid convictions for offenses if at
least one or more convictions have been upheld; super-
vised release commences once one leaves prison; how-
ever, trial courts may modify or terminate supervised
releases for certain offenders if it is clear that they have
served an excessive amount of time in prison for in-
valid convictions for other crimes alleged.
2001
Selig v. Young is decided; a Washington State law com-
mitting sexually violent predators to civil custody be-
yond the completion of a criminal conviction and
sentence served in a correctional facility is constitutional;
mental health officials must provide such predators with
proper treatment and care, however, in order to improve
their suitability for subsequent release from civil com-
mitment at some later date.
Penry v. Johnson is decided; judges’ jury instructions in
death penalty cases that fail to include consideration of
mitigating evidence presented earlier during the trial
phase violate the accused’s Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights.
Buford v. United States is decided; state criminal convic-
tions may be consolidated with federal convictions
when considering whether to intensify a federal sen-
tence under the sentencing guidelines.
2002
United States v. Ruiz is decided; impeachment informa-
tion pursuant to a plea agreement does not have be dis-
closed to the defendant by the prosecution relative to
third-party informants and others; such nondisclosures
do not invalidate plea agreements, if any are in place
when sentencing occurs.
Kansas v. Crane is decided; challenge is made of the con-
stitutionality of the Kansas Sexually Violent Predator
Act; states must prove that offenders have total or com-
plete lack of control over their dangerous behavior; the
120

constitution does not allow civil commitments under
the act without any lack of control determination.
Harris v. United States is decided; “brandishing” a
firearm during the commission of a crime may include
simple possession of a firearm, and such possession is a
sentencing factor to be considered rather than an ele-
ment of a crime.
2003
PROTECT Act is passed by Congress, reducing the abil-
ity of federal judges to depart from sentencing guide-
lines.
Stogner v. California is decided; ex post facto laws are
unconstitutional, particularly if the statute of limita-
tions relating to alleged child sex abuse crimes has ex-
pired and regardless of when the victim files complaint
with police many years following alleged incidents.
The ABA opposes mandatory minimum sentencing, al-
lowing judges to consider all merits of each case and all
factors, extralegal and legal.
2004
Blakely v. Washington is decided; the U.S. Supreme Court
makes federal sentencing guidelines advisory only and
not literal.
Beard v. Banks is decided; procedural factors relating to
considering mitigating factors and reaching unanimous
agreement on them cannot be applied retroactively to
prior capital cases involving similar circumstances;
capital sentences cannot be overturned retroactively
following final U.S. Supreme Court appeals and denials
of certiorari and where fundamental fairness has not
been jeopardized.
Tennard v. Dretke is decided; jurors who are not permitted
to consider low IQ as a mitigating circumstance in a cap-
ital case deprive a defendant of the right to due process;
all mitigating evidence must be permitted in capital
cases in which the death penalty may be imposed.
Chronology
121

2005
Deck v. Missouri is decided; trial courts may not use
physical restraints on compliant prisoners in court-
rooms in front of jurors; shackling compliant prisoners
prejudices juries and denies due process to defendants.
Shepard v. United States is decided; where the govern-
ment fails to show evidence that generic crimes have
been committed under the Armed Career Criminal Act,
mandatory minimum sentences involving generic
crimes and convictions for them cannot be imposed; it is
improper for the government to use police reports as the
sole evidence for deciding whether crimes are generic or
nongeneric.
United States v. Booker is decided; juries, not judges,
must decide whether aggravating or mitigating factors
are present to convict defendants beyond a reasonable
doubt; judges cannot decide such facts on their own
and modify sentences prescribed under the sentencing
guidelines.
2006
Brown v. Sanders is decided; statutory aggravating and
mitigating factors may be used by judges in determin-
ing sentences under sentencing guidelines.
Minnesota considers separate determinate sentencing

Biographical Sketches
John Augustus (1785–1859)
Probation in the United States was conceived in 1841 by the suc-
cessful cobbler and philanthropist John Augustus, although his-
torical references to the practice may be found in writings as
early as 437–422 BC. Although early actions by Judge Peter Ox-
enbridge Thatcher have been regarded by some scholars as the
equivalent of probation—he sentenced convicted offenders to re-
lease on their own recognizance instead of jail—John Augustus
is most often credited with pioneering probation in the United
States.
Augustus was born in Woburn, Massachusetts, in 1785. He
was a permanent resident of Boston and became a shoemaker in
a successful boot-making business. His subsequent work as a
volunteer probation officer is best understood within the context
of the Temperance Movement. The Temperance Movement
against alcohol provided the right climate for using probation.
Augustus attempted to rehabilitate alcoholics and to assist those
arrested for alcohol-related offenses. He was a member of the
Washington Total Abstinence Society, which eventually led him
to the Boston courts. Washingtonians themselves were convinced
that abusers of alcohol could be rehabilitated through under-
standing, kindness, and sustained moral suasion rather than
through conviction and jail sentences.
Appearing in a Boston municipal court one morning to ob-
serve offenders charged and sentenced for various crimes, Au-
gustus intervened on behalf of a man charged with being a
common drunkard. Instead of seeing the convicted offender
123

placed in the Boston House of Corrections, Augustus volunteered
to supervise the man for a 3-week period and personally guaran-
teed his reappearance. Knowing Augustus’s reputation for phil-
anthropy and trusting his motives, the judge agreed with his
proposal. When Augustus returned 3 weeks later with the drunk-
ard, the judge was so impressed with the man’s improved behav-
ior that he fined him only 1 cent, plus court costs of less than
$4.00. The judge also suspended the 6-month jail term. Subse-
quently, Augustus assisted numerous persons appearing in court.
Not all were alcohol abusers. Augustus performed an early form
of candidate screening by carefully evaluating an offender’s char-
acter and age, and the people, places, and things most likely to in-
fluence the person. It may be that those preliminary screenings
were the first presentence investigations ever conducted, al-
though they were informal documents and contained superficial
information about the clients to be supervised.
Augustus attracted several other philanthropic volunteers
to perform similar probation services. These volunteers worked
with juvenile offenders as well as with adults. Although the pre-
cise number of those who benefited from the work of Augustus
and his volunteers is unknown, Augustus probably supervised
and assisted 1,946 persons to become law-abiding citizens dur-
ing the period from 1841 to 1859. He maintained detailed notes
on all of his probation activities and the clients he supervised.
He was also the first to apply the term “probation” to his activ-
ity of supervising clients at the court’s direction. The first pro-
bation statute was enacted in Massachusetts shortly after
Augustus’s death in 1859 and was widely attributed to his pro-
bation efforts.
Francis Lee Bailey (b. 1933)
Francis Lee Bailey was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, on June
10, 1933. Bailey studied at Harvard College and joined the Ma-
rine Corps in 1952. He received his law degree from Boston Uni-
versity in 1960. Bailey was one of the most successful defense
lawyers of the late twentieth century. Bailey defended Dr. Sam
Sheppard, who had been found guilty of murdering his wife in
1954. He successfully appealed Sheppard’s case to the U.S.
Supreme Court, arguing that biased press coverage denied Shep-
124

pard the right to due process. He won a new trial for Sheppard,
who was subsequently acquitted in 1966.
Bailey also defended Albert DeSalvo, known as the Boston
Strangler. Bailey arranged a plea bargain with the government
on DeSalvo’s behalf, sparing him the death penalty. Despite the
use of the insanity defense, DeSalvo was found guilty and sen-
tenced to life without the possibility of parole. Bailey also de-
fended Dr. Carl Coppolino, who was accused of murdering his
wife, Carmela, in 1965 and Lt. William Farber in 1963. It was be-
lieved that Dr. Coppolino had injected both of his victims with a
curare-like substance, succinylcholine chloride, which at the
time was undetectable in the human body by the scientific
means then available. He was convicted of murdering his wife
and sentenced to life, but he served twelve years of his sentence
and was subsequently paroled. Bailey won him an acquittal on
the charge of murdering Lt. Farber. On more than a few occa-
sions, Bailey won acquittals for his clients by claiming that evi-
dence had been fabricated against them by government
forensics experts.
Bailey’s other accomplishments included an acquittal for
U.S. Army captain Ernest Medina in his 1971 court-martial for re-
sponsibility in the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War. In
the 1970s he unsuccessfully defended Patty Hearst, who had
been kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) and
later participated in several bank robberies with members of the
SLA. Bailey is well known as a member of the “dream team”
hired to defend O. J. Simpson in a Los Angeles double murder
trial in the mid-1990s. One of Bailey’s highlights was cross-ex-
amining Mark Fuhrman, a Los Angeles detective who committed
perjury on the witness stand and was suspected of planting in-
criminating blood evidence at O. J. Simpson’s residence. Bailey
totally undermined Fuhrman’s credibility in court, and it is be-
lieved that this fact was pivotal in leading to O. J. Simpson’s ul-
timate acquittal from all charges against him.
In 2002, Bailey was disbarred by Florida and Massachusetts
as a result of handling stock in the DuBoc marijuana case. Bailey
filed for the reinstatement of his law license in 2005. Bailey’s
legal work defending clients accused of serious crimes has led to
more than a few acquittals, and when convictions have been ob-
tained by prosecutors, sentencing by judges has typically been
lenient.

Zebulon Brockway (1827–1920)
Zebulon Brockway was a penologist and is regarded by some or-
ganizations as the father of prison reform. Brockway was born in
Lyme, Connecticut, and began his career as a prison guard in
Wethersfield, Connecticut. He was warden of the municipal alms
house in Albany, New York, for two years. In 1854 he was head
of the Monroe County Penitentiary in Rochester, New York. In
1861, Brockway became head of a prison, the House of Correc-
tion, in Detroit, Michigan, where he attempted to introduce what
later became known as indeterminate sentences. His ideas were
incorporated into a Michigan statute, but the courts subsequently
nullified the statute.
Brockway was appointed as the first superintendent of
Elmira Reformatory, a new type of facility for inmates estab-
lished in 1876. He retained that post until 1900. The Elmira Re-
formatory was designed for adult men. While at the Elmira
Reformatory, Brockway introduced programs of education and
vocational training, physical regimens and activities, indetermi-
nate sentences, inmate classification, and an incentive program
much like the good-time policy used today, as a result of which
inmates could be transferred either to areas of the reformatory
with more privileges or be granted release. He wrote Fifty Years of
Prison Service, which was published in 1912. While at Elmira Re-
formatory, Brockway introduced a form of military training for
his inmates in order to instill discipline. He accompanied his vo-
cational training programs with trade instruction, and his pro-
gram of incentives for good behavior became widely adopted in
other institutions in many other states. Eventually, his experi-
mentation with sentencing at Elmira Reformatory led to the ac-
tual introduction of indeterminate sentencing. His indeterminate
sentencing model became the standard used for sentencing
schemes in most states until the 1970s.
Warren E. Burger (1907–1995)
Warren E. Burger was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, on September
17, 1907. He attended night school at the University of Min-
nesota, where he received a bachelor’s degree. Later he enrolled
in the St. Paul College of Law and received his J.D. degree in
1931. He also taught law at the St. Paul College of Law for twelve
126
Biographical Sketches

years. He was a close friend of Harry Blackmun, who eventually
became one of his colleagues on the U.S. Supreme Court in the
1960s. Burger became involved in politics during the 1930s and
1940s. He strongly supported Minnesota governor Harold
Stassen in his Republican bid for the presidency in 1948, al-
though Stassen lost out to John Dewey, who became the Repub-
lican presidential hopeful. Burger was subsequently appointed
by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956 to the District of Co-
lumbia Circuit Court of Appeals, where he remained until 1969.
In 1968, Earl Warren indicated that he was going to retire as
Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Burger’s views were
known to President Richard M. Nixon. Earl Warren’s resignation
was accepted in May 1969, and Warren Burger was confirmed
and sworn in as Chief Justice in June of the same year.
Burger participated in the Furman v. Georgia (1972) case,
which held that the death penalty as it was being applied at the
time was discriminatory on the basis of race. Burger dissented in
this opinion. It was later held that Georgia had corrected the
racial discrimination feature of how the death penalty was deter-
mined to be applied when the case of Gregg v. Georgia was upheld
in 1976. Thus a four-year moratorium on the death penalty in the
United States ended.
Burger approached criminal law and procedure in a very con-
servative way. He argued against excessive, disproportionate sen-
tences designed to deter offenders by dissenting in the case of
Solem v. Helm (1983), in which a life sentence was imposed on a
person who cashed a fraudulent check in the amount of $100. He
considered the sentence of life imprisonment in that case to be
cruel and unusual punishment. The case involved a habitual of-
fender, and various states were experimenting at the time with
mandatory penalties for chronic or persistent offenders, regardless
of the value of property involved in the crimes. The deterrent ef-
fect of a life sentence was intended to reduce crime, and the issue
continues to be hotly debated. “Three-strikes-and-you’re-out”
laws have been enacted, as well as mandatory terms for persons
who use firearms in the commission of crimes, such as Virginia
Exile, a plan to impose mandatory five-year sentences on any con-
viced felon who uses a dangerous weapon, such as a firearm, dur-
ing the commission of a crime. The U.S. Supreme Court has
vigorously upheld a state’s right to impose mandatory sentences
where it is believed that such sentences will have deterrent value.
The debate on this issue continues, although little evidence exists

that mandatory penalties do anything more than increase prison
and jail populations. Among Burger’s accomplishments outside of
his U.S. Supreme Court role, he helped to establish the National In-
stitute for State Courts, located in Williamsburg, Virginia; the 
Institute for Court Management; and the National Institute of Cor-
rections. These organizations seek to provide judges, clerks, and
correctional officers with further professional training. Warren
Burger died of congestive heart failure on June 25, 1995.
Johnnie L. Cochran (1937–2005)
Johnnie Cochran was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, on October 2,
1937. He attended UCLA as an undergraduate and obtained his
law degree from Loyola Marymount. Most of Cochran’s legal ca-
reer was spent in Los Angeles. Cochran worked for a time in the
prosecutor’s office for both the City of Los Angeles and Los Ange-
les County. One of his early prosecutions was against Lenny Bruce,
a comedian charged with obscenity in his performances. However,
he subsequently became involved in racially charged criminal
cases as a powerful and widely respected defense attorney.
Cochran is best known for his work as one of O. J. Simpson’s
attorneys in a double murder trial in 1995. Cochran was a mem-
ber of the so-called dream team, consisting of F. Lee Bailey and
Robert Shapiro. Cochran was known for his courtroom theatrics,
and on one occasion during the Simpson trial, Cochran asked
Simpson to attempt to put on a glove that had allegedly been
worn by the killer of Simpson’s former wife and a restaurant
waiter. Simpson struggled with the glove, but it was clearly too
small to fit Simpson’s large hand. Cochran declared to the court
shortly thereafter, “If it doesn’t fit, you must acquit!” This tri-
umphant outburst was widely quoted in the news media, and
Cochran’s name became even more legendary.
Early in Cochran’s career as a criminal defense attorney, he
defended persons against officers of the Los Angeles Police De-
partment during a period when their conduct was being chal-
lenged on ethical grounds. Police brutality and racism were
rampant, and the Rodney King incident in the early 1990s caused
a major riot in greater Los Angeles, leading to even greater de-
struction and more injuries. (King was a black motorist. Several
white police officers were acquitted of beating him without
provocation and under color of their authority.) Cochran also de-
128

fended Michael Jackson against child molestation charges. He
went on to defend rapper Sean Combs and civil rights legend
Rosa Parks. He was also an author, writing books such as Journey
into Justice (1996) and A Lawyer’s Life (2002).
Throughout his life, Cochran dedicated his work to civil
rights issues and righting wrongs committed against blacks and
other minorities. Cochran’s work did not, however, always serve
blacks. In the aftermath of the Rodney King case and rioting,
Cochran represented a white truck driver, Reginald Denny, who
was nearly beaten to death by rioting blacks in a scene that was
captured on national television. Despite overwhelming visual ev-
idence of defendant guilt in the Denny beating and subsequent
trial, his assailants were acquitted by a jury. Thus the jury verdict
was a clear message of jury nullification to answer how white po-
lice officers had been acquitted of crimes against Rodney King, in
which similar visual evidence in videotape format had captured
their crimes for all to see. Jury nullification occurs when a jury
makes a decision contrary to the evidence presented, and it is
usually predicated on racial or emotionally charged factors.
Many persons saw the Reginald Denny beating and trial of his
assailants as payback for the state acquittal of police officers who
had visibly engaged in senseless brutality against Rodney King.
Some of the police officers were later tried in federal court on fed-
eral charges of violating Rodney King’s civil rights under color of
their authority as police officers. The convictions stood, although
their punishment was extremely light. Cochran will be remem-
bered for his promotion of civil rights causes and defense of truth
and justice for all. Cochran died of a brain tumor on March 29,
2005.
Sir Edward Coke (1552–1634)
Sir Edward Coke was born on February 1, 1552. He was one of
the most prominent jurists in English history. Coke was admitted
to the bar in 1578 after having attended Norwich School and
Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. He became a
member of Parliament in 1589 and became solicitor general and
speaker for the House of Commons in 1592.
Between 1600 and 1605 Coke conducted several treason trials,
including prosecutions against the Earls of Essex and Southamp-
ton. He was known as a tough prosecutor. In 1606, Coke was 
Biographical Sketches
129

appointed Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas by King
James I (1603–1625). Coke assisted in writing the charter of the Vir-
ginia Company and became director of one of its branches, the
London Company. During his tenure as Chief Justice, Coke identi-
fied with the common citizens and their plight against the state
where common law was applied. Coke’s advocacy for citizens and
their property rights was ultimately crafted to undermine the au-
thority and proclamations of the king. Alienating the king with his
citizen-oriented activities undermined his political future, and
Coke was removed from office in 1616. Subsequently he was
elected a member of Parliament and championed the rights of cit-
izens against the king to such an extent that ultimately he was ar-
rested and imprisoned in the Tower of London for 9 months.
Following his release from confinement, he continued his
labors and writing. He advocated for citizen rights relating to
protection against arbitrary imprisonment, freedom from taxa-
tion without parliamentary representation, and due process of
law. His works included numerous treatises, among which was
an essay on criminal law and its application to punishments and
sentences. Coke’s legacy was that he indirectly assisted in craft-
ing certain parts of the U.S. Constitution and the principle of ju-
dicial review. Coke died in 1634.
Sir Walter Crofton (1815–1897)
Sir Walter Crofton was a prison reformer and director of Ireland’s
prison system during the 1850s. He was impressed by Ma-
conochie’s work and copied his three-stage intermediate system
whereby Irish prisoners could earn their early conditional re-
lease. Crofton, also known as a father of parole in various Euro-
pean countries, modified Maconochie’s plan whereby prisoners
would be subject to:
1. strict imprisonment for a time,
2. transfer for a short period to an intermediate prison,
where they could participate in educational programs
and perform useful and responsible tasks to earn good
marks, and
3. tickets-of-leave, whereby they would be released from
prison on license under the limited supervision of local
police.
130
Biographical Sketches

Under this third, ticket-of-leave stage, released prisoners
were required to submit monthly reports of their progress to po-
lice, who assisted them in finding work. A study of 557 prisoners
during that period showed that only 17 had their tickets-of-leave
revoked for various infractions. Thus, Walter Crofton pioneered
several major functions of parole officers: employment assistance
to released prisoners, regular visits by officers to parolees, and
the general supervision of their activities. Whereas Alexander
Maconochie had crafted the mark system for granting early re-
lease to prisoners, Crofton added an additional component: the
supervised release of those who were granted freedom early,
known as monitored freedom. Thus Crofton’s work was the fore-
runner of modern-day caseloads and supervision practices
among parole officers.
Alan Dershowitz (b. 1938)
Alan Morton Dershowitz was born on September 1, 1938, in New
York City. Dershowitz attended Yeshiva University High School
and received a B.A. degree from Brooklyn College. Later he at-
tended Yale Law School, where he obtained a bachelor of laws
(LL.B.) degree in 1962. Following his admission to the bar, Der-
showitz clerked for David L. Bazelon, the chief judge of the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Dershowitz
credits Bazelon as being his best and worst boss. Dershowitz said
of Bazelon that he was both a slave master and father figure.
Needless to say, Dershowitz held Bazelon in highest esteem and
regarded him as an extremely instructive jurist.
Following his clerking for Judge Bazelon, Dershowitz
worked as a clerk for U.S. Supreme Court justice Arthur Gold-
berg. He joined the faculty of Harvard Law School in 1964, at-
taining the rank of full professor by 1967, an admirable feat. In
1993, Dershowitz was appointed the Felix Frankfurter Professor
of Law.
Much of Dershowitz’s work has been associated with crimi-
nal defense. His clients have included Patricia Hearst, Leona
Helmsley, Jim Bakker, Mike Tyson, O. J. Simpson, and Harry
Reems. He also represented Claus von Bulow, and the case was
eventually made into a movie, Reversal of Fortune, starring Ron
Silver and Jeremy Irons. Dershowitz had a cameo role as a judge
in the motion picture.
Biographical Sketches
131

Dershowitz has always taken the side of citizens who have
been recipients of injustice at the hands of unscrupulous prose-
cutors and police officers. His work in civil rights is widely rec-
ognized, and he was named a Guggenheim Fellow in 1979 and
received the William O. Douglas First Amendment Award in
1983. He has been awarded honorary doctorates at Yeshiva Uni-
versity, the Hebrew Union College, Monmouth College, Haifa
University, and Bar-Han University. He is a frequent speaker on
important criminal issues and is a guest on numerous television
talk shows. His guest appearances at professional events and
meetings are numerous and influential.
Following 9/11 and the attack by terrorists against the World
Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, Dershowitz advocated that
torture warrants should be issued for the purpose of obtaining im-
mediate information from captured terrorists and associates of ter-
rorists. While not supporting torture to extract confessions from
citizens, Dershowitz believes that if there is an absolute need to ac-
quire information quickly from terrorists to minimize further acts
of terrorism, nonlethal torture should be permitted. This and other
civil rights issues have placed Dershowitz in the midst of much
controversy, and he has debated his various political positions at
length with many interviewers and critics. In 2006, Dershowitz
continued arguing unpopular issues, such as anti-Israel news
media coverage, and he has claimed that Israel should not be con-
demned for doing what every democracy would and should do—
to take every reasonable military step to stop the killing of its
civilians. In August 2006, Dershowitz compared Lebanon to Aus-
tria under the Nazis in the pre–World War II era.
Despite his political controversies and ideological beliefs,
Dershowitz remains one of the top defense lawyers in the United
States, and he has assisted many clients in their acquittals or re-
duced sentences when convicted. His defense work is remark-
able in that regard. His place in the sentencing process in
criminal courts is unrivaled by most other defense attorneys.
Elizabeth Gurney Fry (1780–1845)
Elizabeth Fry was born in Norwich, Norfolk, England, to a
Quaker family on May 21, 1780. Fry was impressionable, and at
age eighteen she became enamored with the words of William
132
Biographical Sketches

Savary, an American Quaker, who preached on behalf of the poor,
the sick, and prisoners. Fry quickly joined a voluntary movement
dedicated to providing clothing and food for the poor, both in
neighborhoods and in prisons. She started a Sunday school in her
home to teach children how to read. In 1812, Fry visited Newgate
Prison and saw conditions among prisoners that horrified her.
Prisoners were sleeping on floors and washing in small cells
where they slept. They did their own cooking whenever food
was available, and the conditions of their confinement were in
her view deplorable. Because of family problems, she was unable
to devote much attention to the plight of prisoners at Newgate
and other prisons until 1816. She founded a prison school for
children who were imprisoned with their parents. She assisted
imprisoned women and taught them how to sew and do other
household chores, and she helped them read the Bible. In 1817
she founded the Association for the Improvement of the Female
Prisoners in Newgate.
In 1818 her brother-in-law, Thomas Fowell Buxton, was
elected to Parliament and assisted her in promoting her new ideas
about assisting Newgate prisoners. He permitted Fry to give tes-
timony and other evidence to the House of Commons committee
on the conditions prevalent in British prisons. She was the first
woman to present evidence of this nature to the British Parlia-
ment. Elizabeth and her brother, Joseph John, opposed capital
punishment and actively sought to abolish it. At that time, citi-
zens of England could be executed for more than 200 different
types of crime. Her early appeals to the Home Secretary were re-
jected outright, but eventually she convinced a new Home Secre-
tary, Sir Robert Peel, of the nobility of her views.
Fry and her brother eventually published a book, Prisons in
Scotland and the North of England, which described numerous pris-
ons they had visited and the deplorable conditions under which
inmates were maintained. Fry also devoted some of her time to as-
sisting the homeless of London, providing nightly shelters for
them together with bedding and food. Her actions were successful
and widely copied in other communities. In 1840, Fry opened a
training school for nurses. Her nursing program inspired Florence
Nightingale, who took a team of nurses to assist wounded soldiers
in the Crimean War. Queen Victoria recognized her work and do-
nated money to her causes. Fry died in 1845, and her memorial ser-
vice was widely attended. In 2002 the Bank of England depicted

Peter Greenwood (b. 1939–)
Peter Greenwood is the president and chief executive officer of
Greenwood and Associates, Inc. He graduated from the U.S.
Naval Academy and holds an M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford Uni-
versity in industrial engineering. He founded the Rand Corpora-
tion’s Criminal Justice Program, which he directed for nearly
nine years. He has published extensively in the areas of violence
prevention, juvenile justice, criminal careers, sentencing, correc-
tions, law enforcement, and cybercrime.
In 1998, Dr. Greenwood was honored by the American Soci-
ety of Criminology for his work in criminology by receiving the
August Vollmer Award. He is a member of the Homicide Re-
search Working Group and the Southern California High-Tech
Crime Association Advisory Group, and he is former president of
the California Association of Criminal Justice Research. In 2006
he served on the faculty of the Rand Graduate School, and he has
served on the faculties of the University of Southern California,
Claremont Graduate School, and Cal Tech, and was on the Cali-
fornia attorney general’s Panel on Research and Statistics. Dr.
Greenwood assisted, together with Peter Hoffman, in devising
the Salient Factor Score Index. That index, known as SFS 81, was
created for the purpose of assessing federal offender risk in
granting early release to federal inmates. The SFS 81 continues to
be used today by the U.S. Parole Commission for persons eligible
for parole under the system that existed prior to the introduction
of the U.S. sentencing guidelines in 1987. Dr. Greenwood has also
extensively studied California’s three-strikes-and-you’re-out
policies and how California corrections officials and the legisla-
ture have defined “strikes.” He has given numerous presenta-
tions on the subjects of sentencing and prison overcrowding.
Some of his works have become classics in the field for those in-
terested in investigating sentencing schemes and the implica-
tions of sentencing reform.

Hammurabi (1810–1750 BC)
Hammurabi was born in Babylon in 1810 BC. He became the
sixth king of Babylonia in 1792 and was considered wise beyond
his years. During the first twenty-five years of his reign as king,
he developed alliances with several other countries, including
Larsa, Mari, Ashur, and Eshnunna. Although Hammurabi fought
many battles and conquered much territory, he is better known
for the establishment of his Code of Hammurabi, which was
based on more ancient Sumerian law. The Code of Hammurabi
contained 282 laws that were chiseled into stone. The Code of
Hammurabi covered four primary areas: (1) economic provi-
sions, (2) family, (3) crime, and (4) civil matters. The code was
based on equal retaliation or retribution, or an eye for an eye. It
contained explicit provisions for how legal proceedings ought to
be conducted, and it provided specific punishments for specific
offenses. Included in his 282 laws were those pertaining to per-
jury and wrongful prosecutions. Thus his work was original and
seminal, dealing as it did with wrongful prosecutions, which oc-
cupy a great amount of contemporary news media attention.
Hammurabi not only developed this code but also per-
formed numerous beneficial acts to promote the economy and
social life of Babylonia. He restored temples, city walls, and pub-
lic buildings, and he built canals for irrigation and other pur-
poses. He did not create a functional bureaucracy; rather, he
ruled in a totalitarian or dictatorial fashion. He died in 1750 BC.
His code persists today as an influential document evident in
much of the literature dealing with sentencing and punishment.
John Howard (1720–1790)
John Howard was born in 1720 and worked at many jobs as a
young man. Eventually he became the high sheriff of Bedfordshire,
England, where he took an interest in penal reform. Earlier he had
spent 2 months in France as a political prisoner and was sorely
mistreated while confined. As high sheriff of Bedfordshire,
Howard became a vocal advocate for penal reforms. At the time,
prisoners were expected to pay fees for their upkeep during incar-
ceration. They could earn money for those supporting fees only
through hard labor, and that labor was often exploited by prison
officials and guards, who hired prisoners out to private interests

135

on a contract basis. Most prisoner earnings were pocketed by
crooked prison officials. Those who couldn’t pay their fees spent
years attempting to bribe prison officials for early release. Condi-
tions of confinement were terrible, unsanitary, and inhumane.
Howard wrote The State of Prisons in England and Wales, which was
a critical essay about prison conditions. His report was based upon
personal visits to various places of imprisonment. Howard advo-
cated clean, healthful accommodations, adequate clothing and
linen, proper health care for prisoners, a chaplain service, produc-
tive and useful labor for prisoners, segregation of prisoners by
gender, age, and nature of the offense, and for jails to be funded by
the public and not by prison labor.
In 1779, Howard introduced the Penitentiary Act, which
called for prisoners to work long hours in heavy manual labor
during the daytime hours and be confined in individual cells at
night in order to meditate and acquire remorse for their illegal
behavior. Hard work and moral penitence in a sanitary environ-
ment were believed to cause changes in a prisoner’s lifestyle
through exposure to good work habits and religious instruction.
Over time Howard’s ideas were widely adopted, and Howard
even succeeded in alleviating for some prisoners the psychologi-
cal torment of imprisonment so customary in penitentiaries of his
period. Today a John Howard Society exists, which perpetuates
his ideals and principles for prison reform. Like other prison re-
formers, Howard was widely criticized by those who perceived
prison life to be punitive and unrelated to reform and rehabilita-
tion. Nevertheless, the Quakers were guided by Howard’s moral
principles and were a significant influence on converting the
Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, into a place of
self-reflection and penitence, as well as a place where prisoners
could be maintained in a relatively sanitary environment to do
productive work and rehabilitate themselves for subsequent
reintegration into society. That the Walnut Street Jail principles
were widely imitated by subsequent jail and prison reforms in
the United States attests to Howard’s influence on penalogical re-
forms and the uses of imprisonment for long-term prisoners.

College with a degree in police science. Lee began working for
the Taipei Police Department and rose to the rank of captain
when he was twenty-two. He came to the United States in 1972
and earned a B.S. degree in forensic science from John Jay Col-
lege of Criminal Justice in New York. He studied science and
biochemistry at New York University and earned his M.S. de-
gree in 1974. Subsequently he earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry in
1975.
Lee presently serves as the chief emeritus for scientific ser-
vices for Connecticut and is a full professor of forensic science at
the University of New Haven. He has helped to establish the
Henry C. Lee Forensic Institute. Earlier he served as the Con-
necticut commissioner of public safety and as the director of the
Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory, and he
was the state’s chief criminologist from 1979 to 2000. Since 2000
Lee has had a television show on Court TV called Trace Evidence:
The Case Files of Dr. Henry Lee, which features his work on fa-
mous cases.
Lee is a highly regarded expert on forensic evidence. He has
testified at hundreds of trials as a forensics expert and regarding
evidence collected and its pertinence to the cases with which he
has been affiliated. Some of his more famous cases have included
the JonBenet Ramsey case, the O. J. Simpson murder trial, the
Scott Peterson murder trial, and an investigation into the death of
Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster, who apparently
killed himself in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993. Lee is a regu-
lar on various television programs, including the coverage of the
disappearance of Natalie Holloway in 2005 in Aruba and other
sensational cases covered by talk show hosts including Nancy
Grace, Geraldo Rivera, and Larry King.
Much of Lee’s work produces exculpatory evidence as well
as inculpatory evidence. His work has led to the exoneration of
various persons, thus avoiding their wrongful conviction. At the
same time, his work has solidified cases against other defendants
and has led to their convictions for various crimes. He continues
to be a useful authority and forensics expert who enables judges
to impose appropriate sentences on those convicted of various
types of offenses.

Alexander Maconochie was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on Feb-
ruary 11, 1787. He joined the Royal Navy in 1803 and as a mid-
shipman saw service in the Napoleonic Wars; he was a prisoner of
war from 1810 to 1814. Later Maconochie saw service in the British-
American War against the United States. He was the founder and
first secretary of the Royal Geographical Society in 1830 and be-
came a professor of geography at the University of London.
As private secretary to the lieutenant governor, Sir John
Franklin, Maconochie sailed to the convict settlement at Hobart
in Van Diemen’s Land (now Tasmania) in 1836. He was quite crit-
ical of what he saw and wrote about his adventures. His writings
condemned the state of prison discipline, the convict system, the
fixation of the system upon punishment alone, release of inmates
back into society later without being reformed or rehabilitated,
and the lack of hope among these offenders. Lord Russell, the
Home Secretary of Great Britain, received Maconochie’s report
with deep interest and resolved to change the practice of trans-
portation of large numbers of convicts to remote locations such
as Van Diemen’s Land. A committee was formed in 1837–1838,
the Molesworth Committee, which was specifically designed to
assess the use of transportation by English authorities. However,
Maconochie’s criticisms were so severe that Lord Russell subse-
quently dismissed Maconochie from his post.
Maconochie was deeply religious, generous, and compas-
sionate. He believed the two guiding principles of penology
should be that (1) inasmuch as cruelty debases both the victim
and society, punishment should not be vindictive but should aim
at the reform of the convict to observe social constraints, and (2)
a convict’s imprisonment should consist of task, not time, sen-
tences, with release depending on the performance of a measur-
able amount of labor. Interestingly, following the Molesworth
Committee’s report, transportation to New South Wales was
abolished in 1840, although other colonies continued to practice
it. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Normanby, was
so disturbed by penal conditions at the Norfolk Island prison
colony that he placed Maconochie in charge of the moral welfare
of convicts there, installing him as the new superintendent. In
that new position Maconochie instituted a series of reforms
whereby his penalogical principles could be applied. Convicts
were awarded marks to encourage their effort and thrift. Sen-

tences were served in stages, each increasing in responsibility.
Cruel punishments and degrading conditions were reduced or
eliminated, and a convict’s sense of dignity was respected. It has
been surmised that Maconochie was able to empathize with pris-
oners because he had once been a prisoner of war.
Unfortunately for Maconochie, his efforts at reform were re-
buffed by many persons, including guards at Norfolk Island. He
was prevented from applying his principles to the 1,200 convicts
there by higher-ups in correctional administration, and new con-
victs sent to Norfolk Island were separated physically from the
older ones under Maconochie’s supervision. Although then-gov-
ernor Sir George Gipps visited Norfolk Island in 1843 and gave
Maconochie good reviews and applauded his mark system, or-
ders had already been issued by English officials to replace Ma-
conochie. When Maconochie left Norfolk Island, it reverted to
being a place of terror under brutal masters. Nevertheless, Ma-
conochie’s legacy for Norfolk Island was that more than 1,400
convicts left the island under his administration with almost no
future recidivism. Maconochie returned to England and wrote a
book about his mark system. Subsequently the mark system be-
came the foundation for what are now known as good-time cred-
its, used in U.S. prison systems and the penal systems of other
countries. Subsequently, despite being placed in the post of gov-
ernor of a prison in Birmingham, Maconochie was again unjustly
dismissed and his humane actions toward prisoners criticized.
Despite criticisms from his contemporaries, Maconochie has had
a profound influence on the course of corrections, particularly
U.S. corrections, and his mark system has been widely adopted
in different forms under the general term “good-time credit” as
an incentive for prison inmates to be compliant and work hard to
earn early release.
William Penn (1644–1718)
William Penn was an English Quaker and founder of Pennsylva-
nia. He was born at Tower Hill, London, on October 14, 1644. His
education was obtained at Christ Church, Oxford, where he be-
came a Quaker and ultimately opposed mandatory religious ser-
vices advocated by the Church of England. Because of his
religious rebelliousness, he was expelled from school. Penn spent
some of his early years traveling throughout Europe. In 1664 he
Biographical Sketches

returned to England, where he studied law at Lincoln’s Inn. After
a few years of study he was sent by his father to manage familial
estates in the county of Cork in Ireland. Subsequently he re-
turned to England and became a Quaker minister. He was im-
prisoned frequently for brief periods because of his beliefs and
vocal advocacy of the Quaker faith.
In 1676, Penn continued to engage in preaching and writing
on religious subjects, and eventually he arrived in the New
World, the colonies, where he and several associates purchased
some land in West Jersey. This land was made into a Quaker
colony. In 1681, Penn received a royal grant of territory from
which the boundaries of the present state of Pennsylvania were
determined. He proclaimed an area later known as Philadelphia
as the capital of his new territory. Penn recognized early that he
ought to establish friendly relations with nearby Indian tribes,
and he did so. Whereas other colonies had Indian wars and sub-
sequent problems, Penn’s colony did not. In 1684, Pennsylvania
had more than 7,000 inhabitants. Penn spent much time traveling
back and forth between Pennsylvania and England, largely seek-
ing rights for the Quakers, who were at the mercy of the Church
of England and persistently persecuted. Penn was accused of
treason on several occasions and tried for that offense. He was ac-
quitted, but he did not cease his efforts to intervene on behalf of
his Quaker constituents.
While Penn was in Pennsylvania, he observed that corporal
punishments were used with great frequency. These acts were di-
rected largely at Indians and blacks who inhabited the area. Penn
abolished corporal punishment upon his return from England
and established less physical punishments for those accused of
law violations. Thus Penn was an early reformer and advocated
lenient treatment for those accused and subsequently convicted
of crimes. The death penalty was used for numerous offenses
prior to Penn’s intervention, applicable to more than 220 of-
fenses. Under Penn’s rule, the death penalty was applicable to
only two offenses: treason and murder. He established the Great
Act, limiting these punishments. His advocacy for rehabilitative
measures was not popular with the public, however. No doubt
Penn’s leniency toward those accused of crimes was influenced
significantly by his own treatment by the English and the Church
of England while he was in England. He vowed not to treat oth-
ers as he himself had been treated. Thus early reforms, including
rehabilitation and reintegration, can be easily traced to the work
140

of William Penn and his Great Law, which lasted until his death
on July 30, 1718. Once Penn passed away his reforms were
quickly abolished, and Pennsylvania reverted to prisoner treat-
ment equivalent to that inflicted on the Quakers by the British—
one of the major reasons the Quakers had fled England.
John Roberts (b. 1955)
John Roberts was born on January 27, 1955, and is the seven-
teenth Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Roberts was
schooled at Harvard University, where he graduated summa
cum laude and with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1976. He then at-
tended Harvard Law School, where he earned his law degree.
Roberts is currently a member of the American Academy of Ap-
pellate Lawyers, the American Law Institute, the Edward Coke
Appellate American Inn of Court, and the National Legal Center
for the Public Interest. While in private practice Roberts argued
thirty-nine cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, prevailing in
twenty-five of those cases. Prior to his chief justiceship, Roberts
served as a Circuit Court of Appeals judge for the District of Co-
lumbia. He was in private practice for fourteen years and held
positions in Republican administrations in the U.S. Department
of Justice and the staff of the White House Counsel.
Roberts has been instrumental in affecting laws pertaining to
sentencing. He was a member of the circuit court of appeals that
heard the case of Hedgepeth v. Washington Metropolitan Area Tran-
sit Authority (386 F.3d 1149, 2004), which involved a twelve-year-
old girl who was asked if she had any drugs in her possession,
was searched for drugs, taken into custody, handcuffed, driven
to police headquarters, and photographed and fingerprinted, be-
cause she had violated a publicly advertised zero tolerance “no
eating” policy in a Washington, D.C., subway station by eating a
single french fry. Roberts wrote for a 3–0 panel affirming a dis-
trict court decision that dismissed the girl’s complaint, which
was predicated on the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, specifi-
cally the claim that an adult would have received only a citation
for the same offense, while children must be detained until par-
ents are notified. Roberts wrote in his opinion that age discrimi-
nation and detention in this case were constitutional, noting that
the question before the Court was not whether the policy was a
bad idea or trivial, but rather, whether it violated the Fourth and
Biographical Sketches
141

Fifth Amendments to the Constitution. He declared that, regard-
less of the minimal infraction that had occurred, the policy itself
did not violate the Constitution.
Roberts upholds the Constitution and its amendments in a
literal way, and thus he is less persuaded than some of the other
justices by emotional and compelling arguments to see cases oth-
erwise. In that respect he is a staunch conservative who believes
in leaving previous U.S. Supreme Court decisions undisturbed
unless there are strong and compelling societal interests that
might dictate otherwise. Even under those circumstances,
Roberts probably would be careful before overturning prior de-
cisions by previous courts.
Barry Scheck (b. 1949)
Barry Scheck was born in Queens, New York, on September 19,
1949. Scheck received his B.S. degree from Yale University and J.D.
and M.C.P. degrees from the University of California–Berkeley in
1974. Scheck is director of clinical education for the Trial Advo-
cacy Program and the Center for the Study of Law and Ethics. He
was a former staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society of New York.
In 1996, Scheck received the Robert C. Heeney Award, the high-
est honor awarded by the National Association of Criminal De-
fense Lawyers. This award is given annually to the one criminal
defense attorney who best exemplifies the goals and values of the
association and the legal profession generally.
Scheck attracted news media attention in the 1990s during
the trial of O. J. Simpson in California. Scheck’s work was signif-
icant in that it challenged much of the state’s DNA analysis of ev-
idence against Simpson. One reason that Scheck became
involved in the Simpson trial on the side of the defense was his
earlier work with Peter Neufeld. He and Neufeld had cofounded
the Innocence Project in 1992. The Innocence Project is dedicated
to the use of DNA evidence to help clear innocent individuals of
crimes for which they have been wrongfully convicted. As of
September 1, 2006, the Innocence Project had freed 180 inmates
who had been incarcerated wrongfully for various crimes.
The Innocence Project carefully screens those who claim in-
nocence. It is a costly enterprise to test DNA evidence, and frivo-
lous attempts by inmates to clear their names use up valuable
resources better spent on more worthy convicted offenders. The
142
Biographical Sketches

Innocence Project accepts only cases in which newly discovered
scientific evidence can potentially demonstrate that a prisoner is
actually innocent. Scheck and Neufeld continue to work toward
freeing wrongfully convicted offenders. Scheck was prominently
featured in a nonfictional work by John Grisham in 2006 entitled
An Innocent Man, which described the wrongful conviction of
Ron Williamson in Oklahoma. Williamson was on death row for
nearly twenty years before Scheck and his associates were able to
convince an appellate court that Williamson could not have com-
mitted the crime of murder, because his DNA did not match any
DNA used as evidence against him in a 1980s murder trial.
One implication we may draw from the Innocence Project is
that more than a few prosecutors are out for convictions regard-
less of the factual circumstances surrounding crimes. Once a po-
tential suspect has been identified, both police and prosecutorial
resources are abundantly allocated in an attempt to secure a con-
viction at any cost. The blind ambition of prosecutors especially
is revealed through much of Scheck’s work. Even when con-
fronted by overwhelming and convincing evidence, beyond a
reasonable doubt, that a wrongfully convicted person is actually
innocent, many prosecutors will continue to believe that they
were right initially and that the evidence they relied upon for
their conviction was sound.
Scheck has caused more than a few ripples among prosecu-
tors and the judicial system since the Innocence Project was
founded. If anything, the work of the Innocence Project has
caused at least some prosecutors to tread more slowly and care-
fully before jumping to premature conclusions and pursuing in-
vestigations against innocent suspects. Scheck’s participation in
trials such as the O. J. Simpson trial of the mid-1990s is a case in
point. Scheck’s work strongly suggested that some of the blood
evidence against Simpson had been planted by one or more per-
sons, and that some collusion had existed between the prosecu-
tor’s office and those technicians responsible for collecting and
analyzing evidence at crime scenes. It will never be known how
many persons have actually benefited from Scheck’s work.
William Howard Taft (1857–1930)
William Howard Taft was born on September 15, 1857; he was the
twenty-seventh president of the United States. Taft attended Yale
Biographical Sketches
143

University in New Haven, Connecticut. He received a bachelor
of laws degree in 1880. After he was admitted to the Ohio bar,
Taft became an assistant prosecutor for Hamilton County, Ohio.
Two years later he was appointed a local collector of internal rev-
enue. He became a judge in the Ohio Superior Court in 1887.
President Harrison appointed Taft to the position of solicitor gen-
eral of the United States in 1892. Subsequently he became Chief
Judge of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. He received an hon-
orary LL.D. degree from Yale Law School. Between 1896 and
1900, Taft was dean and professor of law at the University of
Cincinnati, in addition to his judgeship.
Although Taft aspired to the U.S. Supreme Court, and al-
though he was offered the opportunity to serve in that capacity
by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1902, he declined in order to
assist Filipino groups in Manila as governor-general. Roosevelt
appointed Taft to serve as secretary of war from 1904 to 1908. Taft
became U.S. president in 1909 and served a four-year term. He
pushed for world peace during his tenure as president. Consid-
ered a progressive, Taft lowered tariffs on farm products and fac-
tory goods.
In 1921, Taft was appointed Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme
Court, a post to which he had long aspired. Thus he became the
only president in history to serve also as a Chief Justice of the
U.S. Supreme Court. His hand was visible in numerous civil
rights decisions, as he cast vote after vote favoring civil rights
and the rights of individuals over the state. Perhaps his most crit-
ical case involved Olmstead v. United States (277 U.S. 438, 1928).
This case held that the Fourth Amendment’s proscription on un-
reasonable search and seizure did not apply to federal wiretaps.
Thus, incriminating evidence obtained through such wiretaps
would be admissible against criminal defendants in court. Taft
retired as Chief Justice on February 3, 1930, because of ill health.
He died on March 8, 1930, of a heart attack.
Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher (1776–1842)
One of the more innovative judges during the 1830s was Boston
municipal judge Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher, who was born on
December 22, 1776. Thatcher was the son of a prominent jurist
family of the middle 1700s, and thus it was logical that Thatcher
entered law and eventually rose to the judiciary in the late 1820s.
144
Biographical Sketches

Thatcher’s early life and schooling are sketchy, and little is
known about his formative years. However, his family’s promi-
nence suggests that he was well schooled and privileged. Judge
Thatcher became known for his charitable work, especially for
his philanthropy among the poor. He understood the plight of
those confined in prisons, although he personally could not ex-
ercise his discretionary judicial power to change those condi-
tions. However, Thatcher demonstrated considerable leniency to
many who appeared in his courtroom, especially indigents.
Judge Thatcher was somewhat unusual among his Boston
judicial peers during the early 1830s in that he exercised consid-
erable judicial leniency when sentencing offenders. For instance,
he ordered that some offenders be released on their own recog-
nizance (ROR), either before or after their criminal charges had
been adjudicated. Thus he is probably the first judge in history to
use ROR for defendants. Ordinarily, defendants facing a trial
were confined in a jail facility prior to their trial date. There sim-
ply were no exceptions to that practice. When Thatcher subse-
quently ordered the release of convicted offenders on their own
recognizance, that amounted to an indefinite suspension of their
sentence of imprisonment. Thus, Thatcher introduced the legal
practice of the suspension of the execution of a sentence (SES).
These SESs were known as judicial reprieves. Thatcher believed
that such sentences would encourage convicted offenders to
practice good behavior in their community, support their depen-
dents through gainful employment, and refrain from committing
new crimes. Judicial reprieves were the functional equivalent of
probation as it is presently known. A primary difference is that
Thatcher did not require those released on judicial reprieve to
perform any public service, pay fines or restitution, or engage in
any type of victim restitution. They were freed to return to their
communities and encouraged to be law-abiding.
Probation today involves various conditions, including fines,
community service, victim restitution, and other behavioral re-
quirements. Some historians credit Judge Thatcher as the first per-
son to introduce probation in the United States, although John
Augustus is credited as being its U.S. father, in the year 1841, inas-
much as Augustus did require those released to his custody to
conform their behavior to his expectations and become reformed.
Nevertheless, the fact that some probation experts acknowledge
Thatcher as a precedent-setter relative to the use of judicial re-
prieves, together with the similarity of judicial reprieves to the

informal practices of Augustus, strongly roots Thatcher in the his-
tory of probation. Thatcher died in 1842.
Earl Warren (1891–1974)
Earl Warren was born in Los Angeles, California. Warren grew
up in Bakersfield, and he subsequently attended the University
of California–Berkeley, where he obtained his B.A. degree in legal
studies and his J.D. degree in 1914. While at UC–Berkeley, War-
ren joined the Sigma Phi Society, a fraternal organization. He was
admitted to the California bar in 1914. Warren worked in private
law firms in the San Francisco Bay area and eventually became
employed by San Francisco County, where he worked in the dis-
trict attorney’s office. He was appointed district attorney of
Alameda County in 1925. In subsequent elections, Warren was
elected three times to four-year terms. He was known as a tough
Republican prosecutor and did much to professionalize and
streamline the district attorney’s office. Warren was adamant
about changes made in the district attorney’s office and ruled it
with an iron hand. None of the convictions from his office were
ever overturned on appeal.
Eventually, Warren became affiliated with the University of
California–Berkeley, where he was appointed to the board of re-
gents. He became attorney general for California in 1939 and was
elected governor in 1946. During World War II, Warren sup-
ported the controversial policy of moving large numbers of Japa-
nese-Americans from their homes and jobs to relocation camps
because of pervasive citizen fear that persons of Japanese ances-
try would be more likely to subvert the U.S. war effort. Subse-
quently, Warren apologized to Japanese-Americans and deeply
regretted supporting such removal and displacement.
Warren was elected to a third gubernatorial term in 1950.
Earlier, in 1948, Warren had run for vice president of the United
States with Thomas Dewey, who sought the presidency. The
Dewey-Warren ticket was opposed by the Truman-Barkley Dem-
ocratic campaign, with Harry Truman prevailing. When General
Dwight D. Eisenhower was elected president in 1952, he strongly
admired Earl Warren and was impressed with his legal creden-
tials. In 1953, President Eisenhower appointed Earl Warren as
Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Eisenhower proclaimed
146
Biographical Sketches

that Warren had the integrity, uprightness, and courage that he
believed the U.S. Supreme Court needed. Interestingly, Eisen-
hower later became disenchanted with Warren, who became in-
volved in and supported several liberal U.S. Supreme Court
decisions that Eisenhower firmly opposed. Eisenhower re-
marked later and privately to others that his appointment of
Warren as Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court “was the
biggest damned fool mistake I’ve ever made in my life.”
One of the initial U.S. Supreme Court decisions crafted by
Warren that underscored his liberalism was Brown v. Board of Ed-
ucation (1954), which effectively desegregated the public schools
in the United States. At the time, blacks attended all-black
schools, while whites attended all-white schools, especially in the
South, although segregation of that sort was pervasive in many
states, including Northern ones. Supporting the school segrega-
tion policy was an 1896 decision, Plessy v. Ferguson, which set
forth the “separate, but equal” doctrine. That doctrine justified
racial segregation on the basis that if blacks were provided with
facilities equal to those of whites, the segregation inherent in
such separate but equal facilities was constitutional. The Warren
Court, lasting from 1953 to 1969, declared that the “separate, but
equal” doctrine was not valid as it applied to schools. Many
scholars have erroneously interpreted the Brown v. Board of Edu-
cation decision as reversing the separate but equal doctrine, but it
merely provided that the doctrine did not pertain to schools. It
would take other U.S. Supreme Court decisions to provide that
the separate but equal doctrine did not pertain to other racially
separate activities, including housing, public transportation, 
restrooms, water fountains, and interracial marriages.
The Warren Court set numerous precedents that appeared to
tie the hands of police officers when arresting and interrogating
criminal suspects. Furthermore, the search and seizure powers of
law enforcement officers were severely restricted as a result of sev-
eral important U.S. Supreme Court decisions. For instance, in
Mapp v. Ohio (1961), Ohio police officers were prohibited from en-
tering a person’s premises without a valid warrant to search in
particular places for specified contraband. In 1966 the Warren
Court decided the case of Miranda v. Arizona, which led to advis-
ing suspects of their right to counsel and to refuse to speak with in-
terrogating officers when arrested for crimes. The famed “Miranda
warning” stemmed from that case. Subsequently, anyone arrested

for a crime was informed of the following: the right to remain
silent; the right to an attorney; if they cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for them; they may discontinue questioning
by police whenever they decide that such questioning should be
discontinued; and anything they say may be recorded and used
against them later in court.
Police officers in various jurisdictions rebelled against War-
ren Court liberalism by committing perjury on the witness stand
against criminal suspects in order to circumvent U.S. Supreme
Court rulings about rights violations. For instance, many police
officers engaged in “dropsy testimony,” in which they justified
their illegal searches of a person or vehicle by claiming under
oath that they had observed drugs or controlled substances drop
onto the ground as suspects exited their automobile when
stopped for routine traffic violations. For at least a decade, there
was pervasive clumsiness among criminals who allegedly
dropped illegal contraband in plain view of investigating offi-
cers, or allowed such contraband, including weapons, to pro-
trude conspicuously from their persons or vehicle interiors, so
that officers would be able to justify more extensive searches in
their quest for incriminating evidence. Also during this period,
citizens carried banners declaring “Impeach Earl Warren” as a
protest against his liberalism. Several of Warren’s critics declared
that they were unsure that the document the U.S. Supreme Court
was expected to apply was the U.S. Constitution or a statute. It is
clear that Warren’s legacy has been long-lasting, having long-
term consequences for social policy and radical liberalism.
Chief Justice Warren subsequently headed an investigative
commission at the request of President Lyndon B. Johnson to ex-
amine the circumstances under which President John F. Kennedy
had been assassinated in 1963. The commission was known as
the Warren Commission, and it subsequently concluded that the
assassination of President Kennedy was the act of a single per-
son, Lee Harvey Oswald. A large segment of the general public
was convinced otherwise: that Oswald had acted in a wide-
spread conspiracy with others. Earl Warren regretted his decision
to head the commission from the outset, and he was rightly jus-
tified because of the extensive controversy the findings gener-
ated. Warren retired from the U.S. Supreme Court in 1969. Earl
Warren died in 1974, and he was posthumously awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom. The Earl Warren Bill of Rights
Project is named in his honor.

his chapter presents information about inmates in U.S. pris-
ons and jails. It includes their characteristics, including types
of crimes committed. Additional information includes so-
ciodemographic characteristics, average sentence lengths, and
state and federal sentencing types and patterns. Several sentenc-
ing trends are discussed. The chapter concludes with a list of
leading U.S. Supreme Court cases that have been influential in
promoting changes in U.S. sentencing laws and in the nature of
punishments imposed on those convicted of a crime.
Sentenced U.S. Inmates 
in Jails and Prisons
Jail Inmates
Jails are short-term facilities generally designed to hold local
(county and city) inmates serving sentences of less than one year.
However, since the 1970s and even earlier, some larger U.S. jails
have held state and federal prisoners to ease overcrowding in se-
lected institutions. These inmates serve longer terms in jails in
which they can be housed, fed, clothed, and given minimal living
accommodations. State and federal prisoners who are held in these
jails are called contract prisoners, since contracts exist between the
jails and states or the federal government. State and federal gov-
ernments pay jails a fixed amount of money per prisoner per day,
usually a sum exceeding significantly the ordinary expenses of ac-
commodating local criminals. Thus contract prisoners are often a
151

for-profit enterprise for local jails that assists them in improving
their own local physical plants, hiring additional officers, provid-
ing more comprehensive training, and incorporating amenities not
ordinarily found in other jails. Actually, the expenditures of state
and federal governments paid to jails are often lower than the ac-
tual state and federal costs of accommodating those same inmates
in their own facilities. Thus state and federal prisons benefit be-
cause local jails are able to ease prison overcrowding at a lower
cost to these governments. And local jails benefit from the addi-
tional revenue received by housing a certain number of state and
federal prisoners.
The functions of jails are to (1) house drunks, vagrants, and
juveniles, usually for short periods, (2) hold pretrial detainees
and petty offenders, (3) hold shock probationers and prison in-
mate overflow (contract prisoners), (4) house work releasees and
the mentally ill, and (5) hold probationers and parolees for brief
periods following probation or program violations.
In 2006 approximately 90 percent of all jail inmates were
male, while 43 percent were white and non-Hispanic. The num-
ber of female arrestees has climbed slowly since 1990 from 9.2
percent to 14.1 percent in 2006. Figures for different ethnicities
and races have remained fairly constant during the 1990s and
into the 2000s. Some observers believe that selective law enforce-
ment and racial profiling have contributed to the disproportion-
ately large number of black jail inmates over the years, whereby
they have accounted for about 46 percent of all jail inmates. More
than half of all jail inmates were not convicted of any crime. At
midyear 2006, it was estimated that about 94 percent of all avail-
able jail space in the United States was occupied (U.S. Depart-
ment of Justice 2006).
The jail population in the United States for 2005 was 819,434
(Harrison and Beck 2006, 7). In 2005 there were 747,529 inmates
held in jail, while 71,905 inmates were supervised outside of a jail
facility, including weekender programs, electronic monitoring,
day reporting, and home detention. The prison population of the
United States for 2005 was approximately 2.186 million (U.S. De-
partment of Justice 2006).
The gender, racial/ethnic, and conviction statuses of in-
mates for the years 1995, 2000, 2003, and 2004–2005 have been
compared. An increasing proportion of females are incarcerated
in jails across the years surveyed than in comparable prison pop-
ulation proportionate distributions. The proportion of female in-
152
Facts and Data

mates grew between 1995 and 2005 from 10.2 percent to 12.7 per-
cent. The number of white inmates grew proportionately from
1995 to 2005 from 40.1 percent to 44.3 percent, while the black
proportionate inmate population declined from 43.5 percent in
1995 to 38.9 percent in 2005. However, the Hispanic proportion-
ate distribution of jail inmates grew slightly during the same pe-
riod, from 14.7 percent in 1995 to 15.0 percent in 2005. Also,
fewer convicted offenders made up the jail population between
1995 and 2005, declining from 44 percent to 38 percent. The num-
ber of unconvicted offenders increased proportionately for the
same period, from 56 percent to 62 percent (Harrison and Beck
2006, 8).
Prison Inmates
Prisons are state or federally funded and operated institutions
housing convicted offenders under continuous custody on a
long-term basis. Compared with jails, prisons are completely
self-contained and self-sufficient. In 2005, there were more than
2.4 million inmates in both federal and state penitentiaries (U.S.
Department of Justice, 2006). Prisons at that time were operating
at 108 percent of their operating capacity. The Federal Bureau of
Prisons was operating at 132 percent of its operating capacity,
while New Jersey and Wisconsin were operating at 147 percent
and 142 percent of their operating capacities, respectively. Erving
Goffman (1961) has described a prison as a total institution, be-
cause it is an environmental reality of absolute dominance over
prisoners’ lives. These self-contained facilities have recreational
yards, workout rooms, auditoriums for viewing feature films,
and small stores for the purchase of toiletries and other goods.
The first state prison was established in Simsbury, Connecti-
cut, in 1773. That prison was actually an underground copper
mine that was converted into a confinement facility for convicted
felons. It was eventually made into a permanent prison in 1790.
Prisoners were shackled about the ankles, worked long hours,
and received particularly harsh sentences for minor offenses.
Burglary and counterfeiting were punishable in Simsbury by im-
prisonment not exceeding ten years, while a second offense
meant life imprisonment.
The functions of prisons are to (1) provide societal protec-
tion, (2) punish offenders, (3) rehabilitate offenders, and (4) rein-
tegrate offenders by preparing them for re-entry into society
Sentenced U.S. Inmates in Jails and Prisons
153

through vocational and educational training, counseling, and
other institutional measures. All prisons in the United States
have classifications that differentiate between prisoners and
cause them to be placed under various levels of custody or secu-
rity (Sullivan, 2006).
One of the main purposes for the initial inmate classification
is to identify those likely to engage in assaultive or aggressive
disciplinary infractions. Prisoners are eventually channeled into
one of several fixed custody levels known as (1) minimum-secu-
rity, (2) medium-security, and (3) maximum-security.
Minimum-security prisons are facilities designed to house
low-risk, nonviolent first offenders. These institutions are also es-
tablished to accommodate those serving short-term sentences.
Sometimes, minimum-security institutions function as interme-
diate housing for those prisoners leaving more heavily moni-
tored facilities on their way toward parole or eventual freedom.
Minimum-security housing is often of a dormitory-like quality,
with grounds and physical plant resembling a university campus
rather than a prison. Those assigned to minimum-security facili-
ties are trusted to comply with whatever rules are in force.
Some 60 percent of all state and federal prisons in the United
States are medium- and minimum-security institutions. A major-
ity of state and federal prison facilities are designed to accom-
modate medium- and minimum-security inmates. As of 2006, of
all U.S. penitentiaries, all but the one in Atlanta, Georgia, were
classified as maximum-security (U.S. Department of Justice
2006). Medium-security facilities at both state and federal levels
offer inmates opportunities for work release, furloughs, and
other types of programs.
Approximately 40 percent of all U.S. prisons are maximum-
security institutions. Ordinarily, those sentenced to serve time in
maximum-security facilities are considered among the most dan-
gerous, high-risk offenders. Maximum-security prisons are char-
acterized by many stringent rules and restrictions, and inmates
are isolated from each other for long periods in single-cell ac-
commodations. Closed-circuit television monitors often permit
correctional officers to observe prisoners in their cells or in work
areas. Visitation privileges are minimal, and most often no efforts
are made by officials to rehabilitate inmates.
Considerable diversity exists among prisoners in state and
federal institutions. These differences include the nature and se-
154
Facts and Data

riousness of their conviction offenses, age, and psychological or
medical problems. In order to cope more effectively with meeting
the needs of such diverse offenders, prisons have established a
variety of confinement facilities and levels of custody, depending
upon how each prisoner is classified. Overall, state and federal
prisoner populations increased by nearly 183 percent between
1990 and 2005. Generally, the average increase in the federal and
state prison inmate population was about 5 percent per year. This
information is shown in Table 6.1.
In 2005, 7 percent of all state and federal prisoners were fe-
male. Women have been incarcerated at increasing rates since the
early 1990s. For instance, between 1990 and 2005, the average an-
nual percentage of female inmates in the prison population in-
creased 4.7 percent, outpacing male incarcerations, which rose an
average of 3.0 percent for the same period. Between 1995 and
2005 the female inmate population increased by 45 percent, while
the male inmate population increased by 32 percent in the same
period. The more rapid rise in female incarceration is attributable

mostly to more property-related convictions among women than
among men (Harrison and Beck 2006).
Between 1990 and 2005, the number of prisoners in custody
in the United States increased from 1.1 million to 2.18 million.
That was an average increase of 5.9 percent per year (ibid.).
Among all state inmates, women made up 6.3 percent of the pop-
ulation in 2005. Some 50 percent of all male offenders were in-
carcerated for violent offenses, compared with 31.4 percent of all
state female prison inmates.
Approximately 25 percent of all female prison inmates had
been convicted of property offenses, compared with 19.4 percent
of all male inmates. About 32 percent of the female inmates had
been convicted of drug offenses, compared with 20 percent of the
male inmates. Thus, disproportionately larger numbers of
women than men were serving time for property and drug of-
fenses. White inmates represented 36 percent of all state inmates,
while blacks and Hispanics accounted for 46.5 percent and 14.8
percent, respectively. Forty-eight percent of the black inmates
were serving time for violent offenses, compared with 48.8 per-
cent of the Hispanic inmates and 48.6 percent of the white in-
mates. Whites, blacks, and Hispanics were represented fairly
equally in the violent offense category. However, disproportion-
ately larger numbers of blacks committed robbery (17.5 percent)
than either whites (8.1 percent) or Hispanics (12.7 percent).
About 15 percent of all white offenders were in prison for rape or
sexual assault, compared with 7.1 percent of the Hispanic and 5.8
percent of the black inmates (ibid., 13). Black inmates had a larger
proportion of drug offenses (25.8 percent) than either whites (13.3
percent) or Hispanics (24.2 percent). Of all major federal crime
categories, drug offenses had the greatest percentage of total in-
mate growth, 59.3 percent, between 1990 and 2005. The actual
percentage increase in the number of sentenced federal inmates
for drug offenses was 140.9 percent between 1990 and 2005. That
increase is attributable in large measure to the passage of an-
tidrug legislation in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
There was also a dramatic increase in the number of sen-
tenced federal prisoners who had been convicted of immigration,
weapons, and other public order offenses. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, as well as other agencies, has cracked
down on illegal immigrants, especially during the late 1990s. In
the general public-order offense category, therefore, there was an
156
Facts and Data

increase of 32.2 percent in total federal inmate population growth
between 1990 and 2005 (Harrison and Beck 2006).
Offenders on Probation 
in the United States
The characteristics of persons on probation in the United States
for 2005 have been described. Approximately 77 percent of all
probationers were male in 2005. Between 1995 and 2005, the pro-
portion of female probationers increased from 21 to 23 percent.
The racial distribution of probationers remained unchanged for
much of that same period, however. White probationers in-
creased to 56 percent in 2005 from 53 percent in 1995, while black
probationers declined slightly to 30 percent from 31 percent for
the same time interval. The proportion of Hispanic probationers
declined slightly from 14 percent to 12 percent between 1995 and
2005.
Proportionately greater numbers of probationers are entering
probation programs without serving any jail time first. In 2005, 76
percent of the probationers entered probation without incarcera-
tion, up from 72 percent in 1995. There were proportionately
slightly fewer successful completions of probation programs in
2005 (60 percent), compared with a successful completion of 62
percent in 1995. About 15 percent of all probationers were re-
turned to incarceration in 2005, compared with 21 percent in 1995
for various program violations. About half (49 percent) of all pro-
bationers in 2005 were on probation for felony convictions. Less
frequent use was made of split sentencing in 2005; 8 percent of all
offenders sentenced to probation were also obligated to do some
jail time, compared with 15 percent in 1995. There were slightly
fewer suspended sentences (24 percent) in 2005, compared with
26 percent in 1995 (Glaze and Palla 2005, 6).
Most probationers share the following characteristics: (1)
probationers tend to be first offenders or low-risk offenders, (2)
more property offenders than violent offenders are considered
for probation, (3) more convicted women are considered for pro-
bation than convicted men, (4) not having a history of drug or al-
cohol use or abuse is considered a positive factor in granting
probation, and (5) if there were no physical injuries resulting

157

from the convicted offender’s actions, and if no weapons were
used to commit the crime, the chances for probation are greater.
Offenders on Parole in the United States
In 2005, 7 million persons were under some form of correctional
supervision in the United States. Of those, 765,355, or about 11
percent, were on parole. About 10 percent of these were federal
parolees, while the remainder were from state prisons. The pa-
role population grew in the United States by 12.6 percent be-
tween 1995 and 2005. Supervised releasees in the federal system
accounted for 11.7 percent of all parolees (Glaze and Palla 2005).
Some of the characteristics of parolees in the United States for
2005 have been compared with the parolee population from 1995.
One of the most significant changes between 1995 and 2005 is that
female parolees have increased in number from 10 percent to 12
percent of the parolee population. Racially, white parolees in-
creased proportionately from 34 to 40 percent, while black parolees
declined from 45 percent to 41 percent. The proportion of Hispanic
parolees declined from 21 percent to 18 percent during the 1995–
2005 period (ibid.). Further characterizing these parolees, 85 per-
cent were on active parole status in 2005, compared with 78 percent
in 1995. The greatest proportion of parolees under parole supervi-
sion in 2005 were drug offenders (38 percent), followed by prop-
erty offenders (26 percent) and violent offenders (24 percent).
About 52 percent of all parolees were mandatory parolees, while 31
percent were discretionary parolees. Approximately 46 percent of
parolees in 2005 successfully completed their parole programs and
were released from the system. About 39 percent of all parolees had
been returned to incarceration, with 12 percent jailed or impris-
oned for a new conviction. Parolees awaiting a parole revocation
hearing totaled 26 percent, while 10 percent of all parolees leaving
parole were absconders (ibid., 9).
Average Sentence Lengths 
for Various Offenses
As the result of massive sentencing reforms, the percentage of
prison sentences among convicted state felons has significantly
158
Facts and Data

changed. About 68 percent of all convicted felons received incar-
ceration in 1994, but that figure had climbed to 83 percent by 2005
(U.S. Department of Justice 2006). However, the average prison
sentence had decreased from 67 months in 1994 to 62 months in
2005. For certain types of offenses, such as distribution of drugs,
however, the incarceration of drug traffickers has steadily risen.
While these various sentencing schemes have changed the
average sentence lengths of prison inmates, sentencing dispari-
ties have also been minimized in more than a few jurisdictions.
In Minnesota, for instance, there has been a 22 percent reduction
in disparity for nonprison/prison outcomes and a 60 percent re-
duction in sentencing inequality for overall sentence lengths for
persons of different races and ethnicities convicted of identical
offenses. Reductions in disparities according to racial factors also
occurred over time in Pennsylvania among convicted felons.
However, disparities in types of sentences and sentence lengths
attributable to extralegal factors such as race, gender, or socioe-
conomic status continue to be found in various jurisdictions, in-
cluding federal courts (ibid.).

General Sentencing Cases
Sentencing Decision-Making
Simpson v. United States, 435 U.S. 6, 98 S. Ct. 909 (1978)
Simpson and his brother were charged in federal court in Ken-
tucky with two separate bank robberies in which dangerous
weapons were used. They were convicted of a bank robbery
charge (including the possession of a dangerous weapon) and
also of the charge of using a dangerous weapon during the com-
mission of a felony. Thus, the district judge sentenced Simpson to
two consecutive prison terms for each of the statute violations.
Simpson appealed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed Simpson’s
conviction, declaring that sentence enhancements may not be
permitted where different offenses are alleged and have
stemmed from the same crime. In this case, there was a single
transaction of “bank robbery with firearms.” The prosecution
added a second statute governing the use of weapons during the
commission of felonies. The significance of the U.S. Supreme
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases

Court decision is that sentences may not be compounded or en-
hanced through the misapplication of two or more different
statutes. Thus, where a prosecution grows out of a single trans-
action, such as bank robbery with firearms, defendants may not
be sentenced according to two or more different statutes covering
different dimensions of the offense.
Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 105 S. Ct. 1087 (1985)
Ake was charged with two counts of first-degree murder. He de-
clared that he was indigent, and counsel was appointed for him.
He also requested the assistance of a competent psychiatrist to
determine whether he was sane. Ake’s defense was that he was
insane, and thus it would be the state’s obligation to furnish him
with a psychiatrist to examine him and make a determination. A
psychiatrist did so and found Ake to be incompetent to stand
trial. He was confined in a mental hospital for a period of time.
After 6 weeks of treatment, he was found to be competent to
stand trial. His attorney asked for another psychiatric evaluation,
independent of the state-provided one, but the judge denied that
request, claiming the expense to be prohibitive. Ake was con-
victed. No testimony was given by psychiatrists during the sen-
tencing phase of his trial. The death penalty was imposed when
the state psychiatrist indicated that Ake’s future dangerousness
warranted it. Ake appealed. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed his
conviction, holding that when a defendant has made a prelimi-
nary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense is likely to
be a significant factor, the state must provide access to a psychi-
atrist’s assistance on the issue if the defendant cannot otherwise
afford one.
McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 2411 (1986)
Dynel McMillan was convicted of aggravated assault for shooting
a man in the right buttock during an argument over a debt. Under
Pennsylvania’s Mandatory Minimum Sentencing Act of 1982,
anyone convicted of certain felonies and who “visibly possesses a
firearm” during the commission of a felony is subject to a manda-
tory minimum sentence of five years. This fact may be deter-
mined by a preponderance of the evidence. McMillan appealed
the conviction and five-year mandatory minimum sentence, ar-
guing that such an issue ought to be decided by a jury trial, that
the standard of proof should not be “preponderance of the evi-
dence” but rather, “beyond a reasonable doubt,” and that the act
160
Facts and Data

itself was invalid. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected all of McMil-
lan’s claims. First, the Court noted, the five-year mandatory min-
imum sentence is a sentencing issue, not a jury issue. Thus, a jury
trial is not necessary for this factual determination. Further, be-
cause it is a sentencing issue, the standard of proof may be “pre-
ponderance of the evidence.” The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of the mandatory minimum sentencing law.
Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 111 S. Ct. 2680 (1991)
Harmelin, a convicted drug dealer, was apprehended with 672
grams of cocaine. He was convicted, and a mandatory sentence
of life imprisonment was imposed. Harmelin challenged the con-
stitutionality of this sentence and also declared that it was dis-
proportional to the crime. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and
let his conviction and sentence stand, believing them not to have
violated any of Harmelin’s constitutional rights.
Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 113 S. Ct. 1993 (1993)
Deal was convicted of six different bank robberies. He was also
convicted of possessing and using a firearm in each of the six rob-
beries. These convictions yielded sentences of twenty years and
five years for each of the offenses, to run consecutively. Deal ap-
pealed, arguing that the convictions and sentences were exces-
sive. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the
105-year sentence, saying that it is not glaringly unjust to refuse
to give the offender a lesser sentence merely because he escaped
apprehension and conviction until the sixth crime had been com-
mitted. Thus, convicted offenders may incur sentence enhance-
ments for various crimes they have committed but for which
they have not been caught or convicted.
Smith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 113 S. Ct. 2050 (1993)
Smith was convicted in federal court of using a firearm during a
drug sale. Essentially, he had traded a firearm for narcotics. The
firearm was treated as a part of a drug transaction for purposes of
sentence enhancement (for example, if a person uses a gun, he
does two years in prison). Smith appealed, alleging that he wasn’t
“using” the firearm but rather “trading” it. The U.S. Supreme
Court heard his case and upheld his conviction with the enhance-
ment for use of the firearm by declaring that “use” and “in relation
to” are for all intents and purposes the same within the meaning
of the statute.

United States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 113 S. Ct. 1111 (1993)
Dunnigan was accused of conspiracy to distribute cocaine. She tes-
tified on her own behalf, but it was subsequently determined that
she had committed perjury during her testimony. She was con-
victed, and the judge enhanced her sentence because of her perjury.
Dunnigan appealed, arguing that her testimony was self-incrimi-
nating and that she should not be further punished because of her
perjury statements. The U.S. Supreme Court disagreed and upheld
her sentence enhancement. Under the U.S. Sentencing Commission
Guidelines, if the court finds that the defendant committed perjury
at the trial, the sentence can be enhanced.
Wisconsin v. Mitchell, 508 U.S. 476, 113 S. Ct. 2194 (1993)
Mitchell was convicted of aggravated battery and theft, and his
sentence was enhanced under a Wisconsin statute because he tar-
geted his victim by reason of the victim’s race. Mitchell appealed,
arguing that he should not be punished more because he had se-
lected a person of a particular race to attack. Thus, Mitchell de-
clared, the Wisconsin statute was unconstitutional because it
violated his free speech rights. The U.S. Supreme Court heard
Mitchell’s case and upheld the constitutionality of the Wisconsin
statute, whereby offenders may have their sentences enhanced if
it is proved that they attacked their victim because of the victim’s
race.
Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 114 S. Ct. 1732 (1994)
Custis was convicted in federal court for possession of firearms
and cocaine. He had three previous state convictions, and under
the Armed Career Criminal Act, he received an enhanced sen-
tence. He appealed, contending that the convictions in Maryland
had been the result of ineffective assistance of counsel. Thus his
federal sentence should not have been enhanced. The U.S.
Supreme Court upheld his conviction and sentence enhance-
ments, noting that Custis had not raised the issue of attorney
competence at either of his previous Maryland convictions. Fur-
thermore, he had plea-bargained and knowingly and intelli-
gently waived his rights when entering guilty pleas. Thus, the
Court declared, only if Custis had been convicted and denied
counsel at those times could he challenge such convictions. De-
fendants in federal proceedings have no right collaterally to at-
tack the validity of previous state convictions used to enhance
their sentences under the Armed Career Criminal Act. However,
162
Facts and Data

if Custis wished to challenge his state convictions, he could do so
not in federal court but rather in state court through federal
habeas corpus review.
United States v. Granderson, 511 U.S. 39, 114 S. Ct. 1259 (1994)
Granderson, a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service, was con-
victed of destruction of mail and sentenced to five years’ proba-
tion, although the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provided for a 0- to
6-month incarcerative term. Subsequently, Granderson’s proba-
tion was revoked when it was discovered that he possessed a
controlled substance. U.S.C. Section 3565(a) of Title 18 (U.S. Code
2007), the criminal code, provides that one-third of the original
sentence should be imposed as a punishment when revoking a
federal probation. Thus, relying on the five-year (60-month) pro-
bationary term, the judge sentenced Granderson to 20 months of
imprisonment. Granderson appealed, contending that the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines govern incarcerative terms, not proba-
tionary sentences. A circuit court of appeals reversed his sentence
and ordered Granderson released. Its logic was that the original
sentence had been the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines sentence of 0
to 6 months, not the original probationary sentence. Because
Granderson had already served 11 months of imprisonment at
the time of the appellate decision, his immediate release was or-
dered. The government appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court
heard the case. The Court upheld the circuit court of appeals,
concluding that indeed, the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines governed
this situation, not the probationary sentence imposed by the fed-
eral judge.
Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81, 116 S. Ct. 2035 (1996)
Police officers Koon and Powell were convicted in federal court
of violating the constitutional rights of a motorist, King, under
color of law during an arrest, and sentenced to 30 months’ im-
prisonment. The U.S. district court trial judge used U.S. Sentenc-
ing Guidelines and justified a downward departure of eight
offense levels from “27” to “19,” to arrive at a 30- to 37-month
sentence. The government appealed, contending that a down-
ward departure of eight offense levels from “27” was an abuse of
judicial discretion and that the factors cited for the downward
departure were not statutory. An original offense seriousness
level of “27” would have meant imposing a sentence of 70 to 87
months. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected all of the
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
163

trial court’s reasons for the downward departure, and Koon and
Powell petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the circuit court of appeals in part and reversed it
in part. Specifically, the Court said that the primary question to
be answered on appeal is whether the trial judge abused his dis-
cretion by the downward departure in sentencing. The reasons
given by the trial judge for the downward departure were that (1)
the victim’s misconduct provoked police use of force, (2) Koon
and Powell had been subjected to successive state and federal
criminal prosecutions, (3) Koon and Powell posed a low risk of
recidivism, (4) Koon and Powell would probably lose their jobs
and be precluded from employment in law enforcement, and (5)
Koon and Powell would be unusually susceptible to abuse in
prison.
The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that a five-level down-
ward departure based on the victim’s misconduct, which had
provoked officer use of force, was justified, because victim mis-
conduct is an encouraged (by the U.S. Sentencing Commission)
basis for a guideline departure. The Court said that the remain-
ing three-level departure was an abuse of judicial discretion. Fed-
eral district judges may not consider a convicted offender’s
career loss as a downward departure factor. Furthermore, trial
judges may not consider an offender’s low likelihood of recidi-
vism, because that factor is already incorporated into the Crimi-
nal History Category in the sentencing guideline table.
Considering that factor to justify a downward departure, there-
fore, would be tantamount to counting the factor twice. The
Court upheld the trial judge’s reliance on the offenders’ suscep-
tibility to prison abuse and the burdens of successive state and
federal prosecutions, however. The U.S. Supreme Court re-
manded the case to the district court, where a new sentence could
be determined. Thus, a new offense level must be chosen on the
basis of the victim’s own misconduct, which provoked the offi-
cers, and where offender susceptibility to prison abuse and the
burden of successive state and federal prosecutions could be con-
sidered. The significance of this case for criminal justice is that
specific factors are identified by the U.S. Supreme Court to guide
federal judges in imposing sentences on police officers convicted
of misconduct and violating citizen rights under color of law. Vic-
tim response that provokes police use of force, an officer’s sus-
ceptibility to abuse in prison, and the burden of successive state
and federal prosecutions are acceptable factors to be considered
164
Facts and Data

to justify downward departures in offense seriousness, whereas
low recidivism potential and loss of employment opportunity in
law enforcement are not legitimate factors justifying downward
departure in offense seriousness.
Melendez v. United States, 518 U.S. 120, 116 S. Ct. 2057 (1996)
Melendez was convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, a
crime carrying a statutory minimum sentence of ten years’ im-
prisonment. However, in a plea agreement with the government,
Melendez agreed to furnish valuable information leading to the
arrest and conviction of other drug dealers. The government de-
scribed the assistance rendered by Melendez to the court and rec-
ommended a lesser sentence than that provided under the
sentencing guidelines. Under the sentencing guidelines, Melen-
dez’s sentence would have been from 135 to 168 months, and the
government moved the court to grant a downward departure
from that higher range. However, the government did not move
to have the court reduce Melendez’s sentence below the manda-
tory minimum of 120 months, or ten years. The federal district
judge imposed the statutory minimum ten-year sentence, and
Melendez appealed, contending that the substantial assistance he
had rendered to the government and their implied promise of a
downward departure should be honored. Melendez had ex-
pected that his sentence would be less than the statutory ten-year
minimum. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and affirmed
the lower-court decision, holding that the district court lacked the
authority to impose less than the minimum ten-year mandatory
sentence where the government did not bring a motion request-
ing or authorizing such a departure below the ten-year minimum
sentence based on substantial assistance from Melendez. Further-
more, the Court held that a motion by the government for depar-
ture from applicable guidelines based on substantial assistance
does not authorize departure from statutory minimum sentences.
O’Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 117 S. Ct. 1969 (1997)
O’Dell was convicted of capital murder, rape, and sodomy in the
Virginia case of Helen Schartner, whose body was found in Febru-
ary 1985. O’Dell’s conviction occurred in 1988. At O’Dell’s sentenc-
ing hearing, the state argued that O’Dell’s future dangerousness
should be considered in whether he should be given the death
penalty. O’Dell sought to have the judge instruct the jury about his
parole ineligibility if he should be given a life sentence, but the
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
165

judge refused to give the jury such an instruction. The jury im-
posed the death penalty, and the conviction and sentence were up-
held by the Virginia Supreme Court. Subsequently, a U.S. Supreme
Court case was decided in 1994 that entitled death penalty–eligible
offenders the right to have the jury informed that the offender is
not parole-eligible if a life sentence is imposed. O’Dell filed a
habeas corpus appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, contending
that the judge had violated his Fourteenth Amendment due-
process right by failing to inform the sentencing jury about his pa-
role ineligibility, particularly when the state introduced evidence
about his future dangerousness insofar as making a decision about
the death penalty was concerned. The Court heard O’Dell’s appeal
and affirmed the Virginia Supreme Court, holding that as the Sim-
mons case was new and had occurred after O’Dell’s conviction, it
could not, therefore, be used to disturb O’Dell’s death sentence,
which had been final for six years prior to Simmons being decided.
Thus, Simmons could not be made retroactively applicable to
O’Dell’s conviction and death sentence.
United States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 117 S. Ct. 1032 (1997)
Gonzales, Hernandez-Diaz, and Perez were convicted in a New
Mexico state court on drug-trafficking crimes and firearms viola-
tions following a drug sting operation, and the trial court sen-
tenced them to a prison term of thirteen to seventeen years.
Subsequently, they were convicted in federal court on charges
arising from the same drug-trafficking offenses, including a
mandatory five-year federal prison term to be served consecu-
tively with the state and federal sentences. The district court also
directed that the drug sentences run concurrently with the state
sentences being served. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals va-
cated these offenders’ federal sentences for the firearms viola-
tions and drug charges, holding that the federal sentences,
including the mandatory five-year firearms sentence, should
have run concurrently with the state sentences. This finding was
based on the assumption that mandatory sentences for violating
federal laws were applicable only to federal and not state crimes.
The government appealed, and the U.S. Supreme Court heard
the case. The Court reversed the circuit court, holding that a
mandatory five-year sentence for firearms use in violation of a
federal criminal statute is not limited to federal sentences but is
also applicable to state sentences. Thus, U.S. district courts may
impose mandatory sentences for firearms use, and these sen-
166
Facts and Data

tences may run consecutively with state sentences. Furthermore,
federal courts may order drug-trafficking convictions to run con-
currently or consecutively with state-imposed sentences arising
from the same crimes.
Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.S. 125, 118 S. Ct. 1911 (1998)
Muscarello was convicted of unlawfully selling marijuana, which
he carried in his truck to the place of the sale. He also possessed
a firearm, which was locked in his glove compartment. He was
found guilty of carrying a firearm during the commission of a
drug crime, and a mandatory five-year term was added to his
sentence for drug possession. Muscarello sought to overturn his
conviction on the weapons charge, as he alleged that he was not
physically carrying the weapon when arrested. A U.S. district
court judge granted Muscarello’s motion to quash his conviction
of carrying a firearm during and in relation to drug trafficking,
but the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.
The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which af-
firmed Muscarello’s weapons conviction. The Court held that the
phrase “carries a firearm” is not limited to carrying of firearms
on one’s person, but also applies to a person who knowingly pos-
sesses and conveys firearms in a vehicle that the person accom-
panies. Thus, carrying a firearm in the glove compartment of a
truck while transporting drugs was within the “carrying a
firearm” statute. Even firearms locked in one’s trunk are consid-
ered “carrying a firearm” for purposes of charging a separate of-
fense and imposing a mandatory penalty.
Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 119 S. Ct. 1215 (1999)
Jones and two others carjacked an automobile by force and intim-
idation. Eventually they were apprehended by police, and Jones
was indicted under 18 U.S.C. 2119(1), which provided upon con-
viction for a sentence of not more than fifteen years. However, fol-
lowing Jones’s trial, he was sentenced to twenty-five years and
appealed, contending that other carjacking elements under 18
U.S.C. 2119 were not charged in the indictment and thus the sen-
tence was excessive. The U.S. Supreme Court heard Jones’s appeal
and examined the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 2119, which provides
that a person possessing a firearm who takes a motor vehicle from
the person or presence of another by force and violence or by in-
timidation shall (1) be imprisoned not more than fifteen years, (2)
if serious bodily injury results, be imprisoned not more than
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
167

twenty-five years, and (3) if death results, be imprisoned for any
number of years up to life. The indictment made no reference to
Section 2119’s numbered subsections. Furthermore, Jones was
told at his arraignment that he faced a maximum fifteen-year sen-
tence for carjacking, and that the jury instructions at his trial de-
fined that offense only by referencing 18 U.S.C. 2119(1). The U.S.
Supreme Court reversed Jones’s conviction, holding that the ad-
ditional subsections (2) and (3) of 18 U.S.C. 2119 constituted sep-
arate offenses, all elements of which must be proved beyond a
reasonable doubt. As these offenses were not mentioned in the in-
dictment, it was improper for the trial judge to sentence Jones to
any term in excess of fifteen years. The Court stressed that under
the existing carjacking statute, 18 U.S.C. 2119, three distinct of-
fenses are outlined rather than a single offense with a choice of
three maximum penalties. The Supreme Court said, “We think the
better reading is of three distinct offenses, particularly in light of
the rule that any interpretive uncertainty should be resolved to
avoid serious questions about the statute’s constitutionality.”
United States v. Johnson, 529 U.S. 53, 120 S. Ct. 1114 (2000)
Johnson was convicted of multiple drug and firearms felonies in
1990. A sentence of 171 months was imposed, consisting of three
concurrent 51-month terms, to be followed by two consecutive
60-month terms. In addition, a three-year mandatory term of su-
pervised release was ordered to be served for the drug posses-
sion offenses. After Johnson had served several years in prison,
two of his convictions were held to be invalid. As a result, he was
ordered to be set free, as he had served two and a half years too
much prison time. Nevertheless, a three-year term of supervised
release was yet to be served on the remaining conviction. John-
son filed a motion to reduce his supervised release time by the
amount of extra prison time he had served. The motion was de-
nied in a federal district court, but the Sixth Circuit Court re-
versed and granted the motion. The government appealed and
the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case. The Court reversed the
Sixth Circuit, holding that the term of Johnson’s supervised re-
lease commenced upon his actual release from prison, not on the
date when he should have been released. The Supreme Court
said that supervised release periods do not run while a prisoner
remains in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. The Court
added, however, that the trial court was at liberty, “as it sees fit,”
168
Facts and Data

to modify or terminate Johnson’s supervised release obligations
after one year of completed service according to 18 U.S.C. Section
3583(e)(1).
Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.S. 782, 121 S. Ct. 1910 (2001)
Penry was convicted of first-degree murder in 1989 in a Texas
court and sentenced to death. However, the conviction was over-
turned because it violated the Eighth Amendment. Penry was re-
tried in 1990 and again found guilty of capital murder. During the
penalty phase of the proceedings, the defense put on extensive ev-
idence of Penry’s mental impairments and childhood abuse. Pros-
ecutors introduced and read into the record over a defense
objection a 1977 psychiatric evaluation of Penry prepared at his
attorney’s request in another court matter unrelated to the mur-
der at issue. The report concluded in part that if Penry were re-
leased, he would be dangerous to others. Subsequently, the judge
gave the jury detailed instructions including a consideration of
mitigating circumstances, and Penry was again sentenced to
death. However, the judge provided jurors a document with the
original special issues from Penry’s first trial. Again a question
arose about whether the judge had adequately permitted the jury
to consider and give effect to the particular mitigating evidence.
Penry appealed through a habeas corpus action, claiming in
part that the introduction into evidence of his earlier psychiatric
report was a violation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-
incrimination. Further, Penry contended that the judge’s jury in-
structions were inadequate because they did not permit the jury to
consider and give effect to his particular mitigating evidence. The
state denied Penry habeas corpus relief, and Penry appealed to the
U.S. District Court, which affirmed the Texas trial court. An appeal
to the circuit court of appeals resulted in a similar affirmation of
the sentence, and Penry appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court seek-
ing habeas corpus relief. The Supreme Court heard the case and
held that the introduction of the earlier psychiatric examination
during Penry’s sentencing phase did not warrant habeas corpus
relief. However, the Court also held that the judge’s instructions on
mitigating circumstances failed to provide the jury with a vehicle
to give effect to mitigating circumstances of mental retardation
and childhood abuse as required by the Eighth and Fourteenth
Amendments. Thus, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed in part, and
affirmed in part, the decision of the trial court.

Harris v. United States, 536 U.S. 545, 122 S. Ct. 2406 (2002)
Harris was convicted in a U.S. district court of selling narcotics.
Harris ran a pawnshop and carried an unconcealed semiauto-
matic pistol at his side during working hours. Although he was
not charged with brandishing a firearm during the act of selling
narcotics, the judge considered “brandishing” a firearm in rela-
tion to a drug-trafficking offense as a sentencing factor and im-
posed a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years. Harris
objected, contending that “brandishing” a firearm was an ele-
ment of a separate statutory offense for which he was neither in-
dicted nor convicted. The district court judge and the Fourth
Circuit rejected Harris’s argument and upheld his sentence. The
U.S. Supreme Court heard the case and affirmed, holding that the
possession of a firearm during the commission of a criminal of-
fense was a sentencing factor rather than an element of a crime,
and that allowing the judge to find that factor did not violate
Harris’s constitutional rights.
Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004)
Pursuant to a plea bargain agreement in Washington, Ralph
Blakely pleaded guilty to kidnapping his estranged wife and was
convicted of second-degree kidnapping involving domestic vio-
lence and the use of a firearm. In his plea agreement, Blakely ad-
mitted to the kidnapping and to limited facts that supported a
maximum sentence of 53 months under Washington’s guidelines
sentencing scheme. However, the judge rejected the prosecutor’s
recommended 49- to 53-month sentence and instead imposed an
exceptional sentence of 90 months, 37 months longer than con-
templated by the plea agreement. The judge justified his depar-
ture because of “deliberate cruelty” exhibited by Blakely, because
the maximum sentence is up to ten years, and because “deliber-
ate cruelty” is an aggravating factor under Washington’s Sen-
tencing Reform Act. Blakely appealed, contending that this
sentencing procedure denied him the right to have a jury deter-
mine all facts legally essential to his sentence. The Washington
Supreme Court denied Blakely’s appeal, and the case was heard
by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Court invalidated Blakely’s 90-
month sentence, holding that because the facts supporting
Blakely’s exceptional sentence were neither admitted in the plea
agreement nor found by a jury, the sentence violated his Sixth
Amendment right to a trial by jury. The Supreme Court elabo-
rated, stating that the trial judge could not have imposed the ex-
170
Facts and Data

ceptional 90-month sentence solely on the basis of the facts ad-
mitted in the guilty plea. According to U.S. Supreme Court prece-
dent, statutory maximum sentences are maximum sentences that
judges may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in a
jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. The Court further
noted that this decision does not question Washington’s sentenc-
ing guidelines scheme or its constitutionality. Rather, it reflects
the scope of judicial discretion in sentencing under the circum-
stances of this case.
Deck v. Missouri, 544 U.S. 622, 125 S. Ct. 2007 (2005)
Carman Deck was convicted of first-degree murder in a Missouri
court. During the sentencing phase, Deck was shackled in leg
irons, handcuffs, and a belly chain, in front of the jury, and the
death penalty was imposed. Deck appealed, and the death sen-
tence was set aside by the Missouri Supreme Court. Deck was re-
sentenced, again shackled in leg irons, handcuffs, and a belly
chain, in front of a new jury, and the Missouri Supreme Court af-
firmed the sentence. Deck appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court,
and it heard the case. The Court reversed the conviction and re-
manded the case back to the trial court for new proceedings. The
U.S. Supreme Court held that the due process clause prohibits
routine use of physical restraints visible to the jury during the
guilt phase of criminal proceedings. Courts may not routinely
place defendants in visible restraints during the penalty phase of
capital proceedings. Shackling in this case was not shown to be
specifically justified by the circumstances, and thus this offended
due process.
Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 125 S. Ct. 1254 (2005)
Reginald Shepard pleaded guilty to and was convicted of being
a felon in possession of a firearm. Under the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines, Shepard’s sentence would be 30 to 37 months, but
the government sought a fifteen-year mandatory minimum sen-
tence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) in view of
the fact that Shepard had three prior convictions for burglary.
The government claimed that Shepard’s burglaries were “generic
burglaries,” as defined under the ACCA, which defines generic
burglaries as those committed in a building or enclosed space,
thus constituting violent crimes. Shepard’s burglary convictions
occurred in Massachusetts, and Massachusetts has a broad range
of burglary categories that render them nongeneric burglaries.
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
171

The government failed to show the district court evidence that
Shepard’s burglaries were generic burglaries according to the
ACCA, and the court refused to impose the fifteen-year manda-
tory minimum sentence. The government appealed, and the First
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court. Shepard ap-
pealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard the case. The
Court reversed the appellate court, holding that the government
had failed to show that Shepard’s burglaries were generic in the
context of the ACCA, and furthermore, that it would be improper
for a sentencing court to look to police reports in making a
“generic burglary” decision under the ACCA as the government
had earlier requested.
Brown v. Sanders, ___U.S.___, 126 S. Ct. 884 (2006)
Sanders was convicted of first-degree murder in California, as
well as robbery, burglary, and attempted robbery. In a bifurcated
trial, the jury deliberated and found four special circumstances,
each of which would render Sanders eligible for the death
penalty. The jury recommended the death penalty, and it was im-
posed. Later, on appeal, Sanders argued that two of the factors
were invalid, and an appellate court agreed. Sanders further ar-
gued that considering invalid aggravating factors as special cir-
cumstances added an improper element of aggravation to jury
deliberations concerning whether the death penalty should be
imposed. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the death
sentence, and the state appealed. The U.S. Supreme Court heard
the case and reversed the Ninth Circuit, holding that the fact that
two of the four eligibility factors found by the jury, any one of
which would have rendered Sanders eligible for the death
penalty, were determined to be invalid did not affect the consti-
tutionality of the death sentence ultimately imposed. No im-
proper element of aggravation occurred as a result of these
factors that were later determined to be invalid.
The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines
Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 109 S. Ct. 647 (1989)
Mistretta was convicted of selling cocaine. The U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines were officially in effect after November 1, 1987, and
Mistretta’s criminal acts and conviction occurred after that date;
thus he was subject to guidelines-based sentencing rather than in-
determinate sentencing, which the federal district courts had pre-
172
Facts and Data

viously followed. Under the former sentencing scheme, Mistretta
might have been granted probation. However, the new guidelines
greatly restricted the use of probation as a sentence in federal
courts, and thus Mistretta’s sentence involved serving an amount
of time in prison. Mistretta appealed his conviction, arguing that
the new guidelines violated the separation-of-powers doctrine, as
several federal judges were members of the U.S. Sentencing Com-
mission and helped to formulate laws and punishments, an ex-
clusive function of Congress. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld
Mistretta’s conviction and declared the new guidelines to be con-
stitutional, not in violation of the separation-of-powers doctrine.
Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 113 S. Ct. 1913 (1993)
Stinson pleaded guilty to a five-count indictment resulting from
a bank robbery. He was sentenced according to the U.S. Sentenc-
ing Guidelines and the statutory language that the instant of-
fense of conviction be a crime of violence. Later, the statutory
language was changed to expressly exclude the felon-in-posses-
sion offense from the crime-of-violence definition. The sentenc-
ing court ignored that language change, however, and sentenced
Stinson to the more serious penalty range. Stinson appealed, and
the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his sentence, saying that the
lower court had erred when it ignored the Sentencing Commis-
sion language change. Such commentary by the Sentencing Com-
mission is binding on federal court judges.
Buford v. United States, 532 U.S. 59, 121 S. Ct. 1276 (2001)
Paula Buford was convicted of armed bank robbery and sen-
tenced to 188 months after a finding by the federal district court
judge that she was a career offender. Buford had five prior con-
victions, four relating to a series of gas station robberies. The fifth
conviction was for a drug offense. The sentencing judge consoli-
dated these prior convictions in determining whether Buford
was a career offender and should receive the maximum sentence
under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Buford challenged the
consolidation of these convictions, in which the drug offense was
included in order to determine her career offender status. Buford
did not contest the factual circumstances of each of the prior con-
victions. State criminal courts in Wisconsin had previously sen-
tenced Buford to three prison terms for the five crimes (six years
for the drug crime, twelve years for two robberies, and fifteen
years for the other two robberies), and the courts had ordered
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
173

that all three sentences run concurrently. However, she raised a
procedural issue that would seek to clarify the consolidation-re-
lated legal principles and bring consistency to her sentence.
Thus, she challenged the right of the appellate court to review
her sentence deferentially rather than de novo. The U.S. Supreme
Court heard the case and affirmed the right of the appellate court
to review Buford’s case deferentially. Buford’s 188-month sen-
tence remained unchanged.
United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 122 S. Ct. 2450 (2002)
Ruiz was convicted in a U.S. district court of importing mari-
juana. The U.S. Attorney’s Office attempted to formulate a plea
agreement with Ruiz wherein she would plead guilty, waive in-
dictment and a trial, as well as an appeal, in exchange for a re-
duced sentence recommendation. However, the prosecutor
specified that Ruiz must waive her right to any impeachment in-
formation relating to any informants or other witnesses, as well
as information supporting any affirmative defense she might
raise if the case were to go to trial. Ruiz refused to waive that
right, although she subsequently pleaded guilty absent a plea
agreement. At sentencing, she asked the judge to grant her the
same reduced sentence that the government had offered if she
had accepted the plea agreement. The prosecutor opposed her re-
quest, and it was denied. The Ninth Circuit vacated Ruiz’s sen-
tence, and the government appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court,
which heard the case. The Court reversed the Ninth Circuit rul-
ing and reinstated Ruiz’s conviction, holding that the Constitu-
tion does not require the government to disclose impeachment
information prior to entering into a plea agreement with a crim-
inal defendant. Furthermore, a plea agreement requiring the de-
fendant to waive her right to receive information from the
government relating to any affirmative defense she would raise
at trial does not violate the Constitution.
United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005)
Booker and another defendant in an unrelated case, Fanfan, were
convicted of cocaine distribution in separate jury trials in differ-
ent federal district courts. In Booker’s case, a sentence of twenty-
one years and 10 months was prescribed for his conviction
offense by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. However, during the
sentencing hearing, the judge found additional facts by a pre-
ponderance of the evidence to support a sentence of from 360
174
Facts and Data

months to life and gave Booker a thirty-year sentence. In Fan-
fan’s case, a judge made a similar finding and imposed a harsher
sentence, sixteen years instead of the six years prescribed by the
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. Both cases were appealed, Booker’s
to the 7th Circuit and Fanfan’s to the 1st Circuit. Both circuit
courts overturned these convictions, holding that any fact(s) that
increase the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory
maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a rea-
sonable doubt. The government appealed both cases, and the
U.S. Supreme Court heard them. The Court affirmed the circuit
court decisions and vacated the enhanced sentences for both
Booker and Fanfan. The Court held that the federal sentencing
guidelines are subject to Sixth Amendment jury trial require-
ments, and that if a judge authorizes a punishment on the find-
ing of a fact, that fact, no matter how the judge labels it, must be
found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.
Sex Offender Laws
Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S. Ct. 2072 (1997)
Hendricks was convicted in 1984 of sexually molesting two thir-
teen-year-old boys. Hendricks had a lengthy history of child sex-
ual abuse convictions. In 1994, Hendricks was scheduled to be
released from prison to a halfway house, but Kansas had recently
enacted the Sexually Violent Predator Act, which establishes pro-
cedures for the civil commitment of persons who, because of a
mental abnormality or a personality disorder, are likely to engage
in predatory acts of sexual violence. Kansas thus invoked the act
against Hendricks and ordered his civil commitment to a mental
hospital for an indeterminate period. Hendricks challenged the
civil commitment on several grounds, including double jeopardy,
the prohibited application of ex post facto laws, and a violation
of his substantive due-process rights. The Kansas Supreme Court
invalidated the act, finding that the precommitment condition of
a mental abnormality did not satisfy what it perceived to be the
substantive due-process requirement that involuntary civil com-
mitment must be predicated on a mental illness finding. It did
not address Hendricks’s double jeopardy or ex post facto claims.
Kansas officials appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
heard the case. The Court reversed the Kansas Supreme Court,
holding that the act’s definition of mental abnormality satisfies
“substantive” due-process requirements. Furthermore, the act
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
175

does not violate Hendricks’s rights against double jeopardy or its
ban on ex post facto lawmaking, as the act does not establish
criminal proceedings, and involuntary confinement under it is
not punishment in any criminal context.
Seling v. Young, 531 U.S. 250, 121 S. Ct. 727 (2001)
Andre Young was convicted of six rapes over three decades and
was scheduled for release from prison in October 1990 in Wash-
ington State. One day prior to his release, the state filed a petition
to commit Young as a sexually violent offender. A commitment
hearing was held, and it was determined that Young posed a
threat as a sexually violent offender under Washington State’s
Community Protection Act of 1990, which authorizes civil com-
mitment of such offenders. Young appealed, arguing that his civil
commitment constituted double jeopardy and that the law was
unconstitutional. Furthermore, Young alleged that the conditions
of his confinement were incompatible with rehabilitation and too
restrictive. Washington State courts rejected his arguments, and
he appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard the case. The
Court upheld Young’s civil commitment and rejected his double
jeopardy argument. It further held that the Washington State law
was constitutional. The Court did not address whether the men-
tal health center in which Young was being housed and treated
was operating properly. Rather, the Court left that determination
to the Washington State courts. The U.S. Supreme Court noted
that offenders have a cause of action at the state level if the men-
tal health center fails to fulfill its statutory duty to care adequately
and to provide individualized treatment for sex offenders.
Kansas v. Crane, 536 U.S. 407, 122 S. Ct. 867 (2002)
Michael Crane was convicted of lewd and lascivious behavior and
pleaded guilty to aggravated sexual battery for two incidents oc-
curring in 1993. He exposed himself to a tanning salon attendant
and a video store clerk. In the case of the video store clerk, he de-
manded oral sex and threatened to rape her. Subsequently, the
state court evaluated Crane and adjudicated him a sexual predator
under Kansas’s Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA). That act
permits the civil detention of a person convicted of any of several
enumerated sexual offenses, if it is proven beyond a reasonable
doubt that the person suffers from a mental abnormality, a disor-
der affecting emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the
person to commit sexually violent acts or that makes the person
176
Facts and Data

likely to engage in repeated acts of sexual violence. Crane was
committed to civil custody. Crane appealed, and the Kansas
Supreme Court reversed the civil commitment of Crane, holding
that the SVPArequires that the state must prove that the defendant
cannot control his or her dangerous behavior, and that the trial
court had made no such finding. Kansas appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which heard the case. The U.S. Supreme Court re-
versed the Kansas Supreme Court and held that (1) the SVPA does
not require the state to prove the offender’s total or complete lack
of control over his or her dangerous behavior, and that (2) the fed-
eral constitution does not allow civil commitment under the act
without any lack of control determination. The significance of the
U.S. Supreme Court action is that a state must show that a defen-
dant is likely to engage in sexually violent conduct in the future,
but not in any absolute sense. There is no rule obligating the state
to prove that any defendant must lack total control regarding vio-
lent sexual conduct. Rather, the phrase stressed is that the state
must demonstrate that the defendant possesses an abnormality or
disorder that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to control the
dangerous behavior (compare Kansas v. Hendricks [1997]).
Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607, 123 S. Ct. 2446 (2003)
In 1998, a California jury indicted Marion Stogner on several
counts of sex-related child abuse committed several decades ear-
lier, from 1955 through 1973. The statute of limitations on those
crimes was three years during that particular time interval. How-
ever, California enacted an ex post facto statute in 1993 govern-
ing sex-related offenses that was amended with additional
provisions in 1996. The new law provided for prosecutions of
sex-related crimes in which the statute of limitations had already
expired, provided that authorities prosecuted defendants within
one year following a victim’s first complaint to police of the
crime. Stogner moved to dismiss the complaint on grounds that
the ex post facto nature of the new law was unconstitutional. The
trial court agreed and dismissed the complaint. However, a Cal-
ifornia appeals court reversed, thus permitting Stogner’s prose-
cution for these prior crimes. Stogner persisted in his appeal to
the U.S. Supreme Court, which heard his case. The Court re-
versed the California court, holding that California’s law subjects
individuals such as Stogner to prosecution long after the state
has, in effect, granted amnesty, telling them that they are at lib-
erty to return to their country.

North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072 (1969)
Pearce was convicted of assault with intent to commit rape and
was sentenced to twelve to fifteen years. Several years later he
filed a habeas corpus petition, alleging that an involuntary con-
fession had been admitted as evidence against him at his trial. He
was subsequently retried, was convicted, and this time was sen-
tenced to eight years. This sentence, when added to the time he
had already spent in prison, amounted to a term longer than his
original sentence. Pearce appealed, arguing that the additional
time imposed was a punishment for having his original convic-
tion set aside. The U.S. Supreme Court heard this appeal and set
aside the sentence, saying that although nothing prohibits judges
from imposing harsher sentences in retrials than the sentences
imposed in earlier trials, constitutional guarantees obligate the
government to give full credit of previous time served against the
new sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court also said that any unex-
plained additional punishment is a violation of due process.
Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430, 101 S. Ct. 1852 (1981)
Bullington was charged with capital murder. His case was heard
by a jury, which found him guilty. In the sentencing phase, the
jury had to decide between the death penalty and life imprison-
ment as a punishment, and they recommended the latter. Subse-
quently, Bullington’s conviction was reversed and a new trial
resulted. Bullington was again convicted. This time, the jury de-
cided in favor of the death penalty. Bullington appealed, and the
U.S. Supreme Court heard his case. It set his death penalty sen-
tence aside, saying that the first jury’s refusal to impose the death
penalty was an acquittal for that form of punishment. A subse-
quent trial cannot result in a punishment greater than that im-
posed by the first in a capital case (compare Arizona v. Rumsey
[1984] and Caspari v. Bohlen [1984]).
Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 104 S. Ct. 2305 (1984)
Rumsey, convicted of murder, was sentenced to life imprison-
ment by the judge. His case was overturned and set for retrial. A
new trial also resulted in a conviction for murder. This time the
death penalty was imposed by the judge, who cited aggravating
factors that outweighed mitigating ones. Rumsey appealed on
the grounds that the second penalty was more severe than the
178
Facts and Data

first. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned the death penalty sen-
tence, saying that in capital cases in resentencing proceedings,
the punishment cannot be greater than that imposed in the first
sentencing. Thus, states cannot impose the death penalty on con-
victed murderers following prior trials in which life imprison-
ment was imposed. The U.S. Supreme Court declared that the
first judge’s refusal to impose the death penalty operated as an
acquittal of that punishment, not the offense itself. Thus, judges
who impose life sentences in lieu of the death penalty cannot
later impose the death penalty as a greater punishment (compare
Bullington v. Missouri [1981] for a case involving a jury decision
involving the same issue).
Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383, 114 S. Ct. 948 (1994)
Bohlen and others were convicted of robbing a jewelry store in
Missouri in 1981. The judge determined that Bohlen was also a
persistent offender and was thus in violation of Missouri’s per-
sistent-offender statute. The jury convicted him of first-degree
robbery, and the judge sentenced him to three consecutive terms
of fifteen years in prison. Bohlen appealed, and the Missouri
Supreme Court overturned his conviction because no proof of his
being a persistent offender had been presented at his trial. The
case was retried, this time to allow the prosecution the opportu-
nity of showing proof of Bohlen’s four prior felony convictions
and his status as a persistent offender for a commensurate sen-
tence. Again the trial judge sentenced Bohlen to three consecu-
tive terms of fifteen years in prison, and again Bohlen appealed
on the grounds that the second trial had violated his Fifth
Amendment right against double jeopardy. Bohlen’s conviction
and consecutive sentences were upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court, which said that it is well established that there is no dou-
ble-jeopardy bar to the use of prior convictions in sentencing per-
sistent offenders (at 954). The significance of this case is that the
double-jeopardy issue does not apply in resentencing proceed-
ings in noncapital cases (compare such cases as Bullington v. Mis-
souri [1981] and Arizona v. Rumsey [1984]).
Acceptance of Responsibility
Braxton v. United States, 500 U.S. 344, 111 S. Ct. 1854 (1991)
Braxton entered guilty pleas to charges of assaulting federal offi-
cers but pleaded not guilty to the more serious charge of intent to
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
179

kill a U.S. marshal. The government accepted these pleas, but
when applying the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines it applied an en-
hancement more applicable to the charge to which Braxton had
pleaded not guilty. Thus Braxton was sentenced as though he
had actually committed the crime of “intentionally attempting to
kill a United States marshal.” The government argued that Brax-
ton had “stipulated” to the essence of the charge, that he had de-
liberately fired a shotgun through his front door when U.S.
marshals came to arrest him. Braxton appealed the more severe
sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court heard the appeal and vacated
the sentence, holding that there was nothing in Braxton’s stipu-
lation that he ever intended to kill a U.S. marshal. Because that
was a necessary element of an “intent to kill a United States mar-
shal” charge, the sentence had to be vacated and the case re-
manded for resentencing.
Aggravating and Mitigating Circumstances
Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712 (1986)
In Kentucky, a black man, Batson, was convicted by an all-white
jury of second-degree burglary. The prosecutor had used all of
his peremptory challenges to exclude the few black prospective
jurors from the jury pool. Ordinarily, peremptory challenges may
be used to strike particular jurors without the prosecutor’s hav-
ing to provide a reason for doing so. In this case the use of
peremptory challenges was rather transparent, and Batson ap-
pealed. In a landmark case, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that
peremptory challenges may not be used for a racially discrimi-
natory purpose. Thus, creating an all-white jury by deliberately
eliminating all prospective black candidates was discriminatory.
The Court ruled in favor of Batson.
Sumner v. Shuman, 483 U.S. 66, 107 S. Ct. 2716 (1987)
In Nevada, Shuman was convicted of first-degree murder and
sentenced to life without parole. While in prison, he murdered
another inmate and was convicted of this second murder. This
time he was sentenced to the death penalty. He appealed.
Nevada had a statute imposing a mandatory death penalty on
prisoners who commit murder while imprisoned and already
serving life terms. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Shuman’s
death sentence, indicating that mandatory death penalties are
180
Facts and Data

unconstitutional because they do not consider aggravating and
mitigating circumstances.
Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 108 S. Ct. 1853 (1988)
Cartwright shot and killed a man and slit his wife’s throat. These
victims had formerly employed him. An Oklahoma jury found
Cartwright guilty of first-degree murder. When the judge gave
the jury instructions during the penalty phase of the trial, he used
the phrase “especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel” in describing
various aggravating circumstances they were to consider. Cart-
wright challenged his death sentence on the grounds that such a
statement was unconstitutionally vague. The U.S. Supreme Court
agreed with Cartwright, and his death sentence was vacated, as
the instruction, determined to be unconstitutionally vague, had
not offered sufficient guidance to the jury in deciding whether to
impose the death penalty.
Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S. Ct. 1860 (1988)
Mills was an inmate of the Maryland Correctional Institution in
Hagerstown. He stabbed his cellmate to death with a homemade
knife and was charged with murder. A trial was held and the jury
found Mills guilty. Instructions from the judge at the beginning
of the sentencing phase led jurors to believe that they must agree
unanimously on mitigating circumstances before they could con-
sider them in Mills’s case. If they could not agree, then they had
to render a death penalty decision. Because they were not unan-
imous regarding any mitigating circumstances, they decided on
the death penalty as required by the judge’s instructions. Thus, a
mandatory element was introduced into the penalty phase,
which is unconstitutional in relation to death penalty decisions.
Mills appealed, arguing that very point to the U.S. Supreme
Court. The Court overturned Mills’s conviction, concluding that
there was a substantial probability that reasonable jurors, upon
receiving the judge’s instructions, might well have thought that
they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence
unless all twelve jurors agreed on the existence of such a circum-
stance. The Court said that the jurors must consider all the miti-
gating evidence. The possibility that a single juror could block
such consideration, and consequently require the jury to impose
the death penalty, was not to be risked. Therefore, the death
penalty sentence was vacated.
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
181

Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S. Ct. 1060 (1989)
Teague, a black man, was accused of attempted murder. During
jury selection, the prosecutor used all of his ten peremptory chal-
lenges to exclude blacks from the jury. Teague was eventually
convicted by an all-white jury. In the meantime, Batson v. Ken-
tucky (1986) had recently been decided, which established that
blacks could not be excluded from jury duty by use of peremp-
tory challenges. Teague sought to make that rule retroactive in
his case, thus causing his conviction to be overturned and a new
trial conducted. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected the retroactive
principle relating to Batson, holding that convicted offenders are
barred from making retroactive claims involving racial discrimi-
nation in jury selection. Furthermore, Teague had failed to make
a convincing case that the peremptory challenges had been used
in a discriminatory fashion.
Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299, 110 S. Ct. 1078 (1990)
Blystone was convicted of first-degree murder, robbery, and crim-
inal conspiracy to commit homicide. The sentencing jury was in-
structed to consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances
and to impose the death penalty if aggravating circumstances out-
weighed the mitigating ones. The death penalty was imposed on
Blystone, and he appealed, contending that the weighing proce-
dure of aggravating and mitigating circumstances made the death
penalty a mandatory penalty and thus unconstitutional. The U.S.
Supreme Court rejected Blystone’s argument, saying that the
Pennsylvania statute of weighing the aggravating and mitigating
circumstances was not unconstitutional.
Lankford v. Idaho, 500 U.S. 110, 111 S. Ct. 1723 (1991)
In this rather complicated case, Lankford and his brother were
charged with first-degree murder but entered a guilty plea in ex-
change for a minimum ten-year term. The judge refused to ap-
prove the plea agreement and the case went to trial. The defense
and prosecuting attorneys proceeded as though the ten-year
minimum term was being sought as a punishment and the death
penalty was not contemplated. When the brothers were con-
victed of the murder, the judge asked whether either party
wished to cite aggravating or mitigating circumstances to deter-
mine the type of sentence imposed. Neither side indicated that,
and in the sentencing phase the two brothers were recommended
for long prison terms. The judge, however, decided that the pun-
182
Facts and Data

ishment was too lenient and imposed the death penalty on both
brothers, citing several aggravating circumstances in justifica-
tion. The brothers appealed. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned
the death penalty because neither side had been permitted to
argue the merits of aggravating or mitigating circumstances. The
judge’s personal feelings in the matter had come too late in the
proceeding for either side to address the aggravating and miti-
gating circumstances. Thus, the Court ruled that the sentences of
death were unconstitutional because the judge had failed to pro-
vide adequate notice that they would be imposed.
Arave v. Creech, 507 U.S. 463, 113 S. Ct. 1534 (1993)
Creech, confined in the Idaho Penitentiary, was convicted of the
murder of another inmate. At his trial the judge sentenced him to
death, basing his decision, in part, on aggravating circumstances.
He used the phrases “utter disregard” and “the cold-blooded
pitiless slayer.” Creech appealed the sentence, contending that
the phrase “utter disregard” was invalid. The U.S. Supreme
Court upheld Creech’s conviction, holding that the phrase “utter
disregard” did not violate any constitutional provisions.
Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406, 124 S. Ct. 2504 (2004)
George Banks was convicted of twelve counts of murder in Penn-
sylvania in the early 1980s, and Banks’s convictions became final
in 1987. Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Mills v.
Maryland (1988) and Teague v. Lane (1989). Mills made it unconsti-
tutional for juries to be prevented from considering mitigating
factors in capital cases in which those factors were not agreed
upon by the jury unanimously. The Teague case barred retroactive
application of later U.S. Supreme Court decisions to earlier cases
with some limited exceptions. Banks sought habeas relief in fed-
eral court subsequent to 1987, claiming among other things that
the jury in his case had disregarded mitigating factors that were
not found unanimously. His habeas petition was denied on the
merits in U.S. district court, and he appealed to the Third Circuit
Court, which reversed and remanded the case, concluding that
the Teague analysis was unnecessary. Pennsylvania appealed, and
the U.S. Supreme Court heard the case. The Court reversed the
Third Circuit and held that (1) convictions become final for pur-
poses of determining the applicability of the Teague rule on the
date the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari after Banks’s con-
victions were affirmed on appeal, (2) the Mills rule announced a
U.S. Supreme Court General Sentencing Cases
183

new rule of constitutional law for Teague purposes, and (3) Mills
was not a watershed rule of criminal procedure implicating fun-
damental fairness, for purposes of meeting Teague’s nonretroac-
tivity exception. The Mills rule does not fall within either of
Teague’s exceptions, and therefore it cannot be applied retroac-
tively to Banks.
Tennard v. Dretke, 542 U.S. 274, 124 S. Ct. 2562 (2004)
Robert Tennard was convicted of capital murder in Texas in 1986.
Evidence presented at his trial indicated that Tennard and two
accomplices killed two of Tennard’s neighbors and robbed their
house. Tennard stabbed one of the victims to death. Tennard was
charged with capital murder and subsequently convicted. Dur-
ing the trial, Tennard’s defense counsel introduced evidence
which showed that Tennard had an IQ of 67, as well as testimony
from a rape victim of Tennard’s which suggested that Tennard’s
limited mental faculties and gullible nature mitigated his culpa-
bility in his conviction offense of first-degree murder. It was also
established that Tennard had suffered some childhood abuse.
During the penalty phase, the jury was instructed to consider
Tennard’s appropriate punishment by answering two “special is-
sues” questions used at the time in Texas to establish whether life
imprisonment or death would be imposed. These issues were (1)
was the conduct of Tennard that led to the death of the deceased
committed deliberately with the reasonable expectation that the
death of the deceased or another would result? and (2) is there a
probability that Tennard would commit criminal acts of violence
that would constitute a continuing threat to society? Neither of
those issues was sufficient to address whether Tennard’s mental
retardation or history of childhood abuse could be considered as
mitigating circumstances.
The jury recommended the death penalty, and the judge sen-
tenced Tennard to death. Tennard appealed his conviction and
sentence, alleging that his death sentence violated his Eighth
Amendment rights and that the jury was not permitted to con-
sider evidence of his mental retardation as a mitigating factor.
Tennard’s appeals were rejected by the Texas Supreme Court,
which held that evidence of low IQ alone was insufficient to
demonstrate mental retardation, and that Tennard had failed to
show that the crime he committed was attributable to his low IQ.
Tennard then asked the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a
certificate of appealability (COA), which was denied. Agreeing
184
Facts and Data

with the Texas Supreme Court, the Fifth Circuit declared that
Tennard had failed to present any constitutionally relevant evi-
dence of a “uniquely severe permanent handicap with which the
defendant was burdened through no fault of his own,” or any ev-
idence that “the criminal act was attributable to this severe per-
manent condition.” Subsequently Tennard appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which heard the case. The Court reversed Ten-
nard’s conviction and remanded the case to the Texas courts. The
U.S. Supreme Court held that Tennard had made a substantial
showing of a denial of a constitutional right because jurors were
not permitted to consider his low IQ as evidence of mental retar-
dation. Furthermore, the “constitutional relevance” test used by
the Fifth Circuit was improper and has no foundation in U.S.
Supreme Court decisions, since Tennard’s low IQ evidence was
relevant mitigating evidence. Impaired intellectual functioning
has a mitigating dimension beyond the impact it has on the abil-
ity to act deliberately. The prosecutor in Tennard’s case expressed
the most problematic interpretation of special issues by suggest-
ing that Tennard’s low IQ was irrelevant in mitigation but rele-
vant to future dangerousness.

The American Bar Association (ABA) was founded on August 21,
1878, in Saratoga Springs, New York, by a hundred lawyers from
twenty-one states. The legal profession as we know it today
barely existed at that time. Lawyers were generally sole practi-
tioners who trained under a system of apprenticeship. There was
no national code of ethics and no national organization to serve
as a forum for discussion of the increasingly intricate issues in-
volved in legal practice.
187

The first ABA constitution, which is still substantially the
charter of the association, defined the purpose of the ABA as
being the advancement of the science of jurisprudence and the
promotion of the administration of justice and a uniformity of
legislation throughout the country. Today ABA membership is in
excess of 400,000. The ABA provides law school accreditation,
continuing legal education for those desiring it, information
about the law, programs to assist judges and lawyers in their
work, and initiatives to improve the legal system for the public.
The overall mission of the ABA is to be the national representa-
tive of the legal profession, serving the public and the profession
by promoting justice, professional excellence, and respect for the
law. The ABA recruits persons from a variety of backgrounds
who seek opportunities for challenging and substantive work.
Certain ABA goals pertain to increasing the racial and ethnic
diversity of attorneys admitted to the bar through focusing upon
pipeline issues. These goals encompass the following: (1) take
steps to increase the awareness of the ABA leadership about the
need for and benefits of greater racial and ethnic diversity in the
profession, (2) make pilot projects available for ABA and affili-
ated entities to conduct racial and ethnic diversity pipeline pro-
grams, (3) act as a national clearinghouse and information source
on increasing racial and ethnic diversity in the pipeline to share
information and develop strategies, (4) provide a mechanism for
people and entities with an interest in expanding racial and eth-
nic diversity in the pipeline to share information and develop
strategies, (5) provide services for any organization to carry out
programs and increase racial and ethnic diversity in the pipeline,
and (6) partner with other ABA and non-ABA entities on pro-
grams and projects concerning racial and ethnic diversity issues
in the pipeline.
The most important role of the ABA is its creation and main-
tenance of a code of ethical standards for lawyers. The Model
Code of Professional Responsibility (1969) and newer model rules
of professional conduct promulgated in 1983 have been adopted
in forty-nine state jurisdictions and the District of Columbia. The
ABA publishes the ABA Journal. The ABA has a house of delegates
that acts as the organization’s primary body for adopting new
policies and recommendations as a part of the association’s offi-
cial position. Accrediting law schools is an important function as
well, since the organization assists in the training of lawyers who
defend clients accused of crimes. Defense lawyers must meet with
188
Directory of Organizations

prosecutors and work out plea agreements in many cases so their
clients can benefit from greater leniency at the time of sentencing.
The ABA prepares lawyers for this practice, among its other ac-
tivities and initiatives.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) was founded in
1920 by Roger Baldwin, Crystal Eastman, Albert DeSilver, and
others. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization and presently
has a membership of more than 500,000. The U.S. system of gov-
ernment is founded on two counterbalancing principles: that the
majority of the people governs through democratically elected
representatives, and that the power even of a democratic major-
ity must be limited to ensure individual rights. Majority power is
limited by the Constitution’s Bill of Rights, which consists of the
original ten amendments ratified in 1791, including three post–
Civil War amendments (13th, 14th, and 15th) and the 19th
amendment (adopted in 1920).
The mission of the ACLU is to preserve all of these protec-
tions and guarantees: (1) First Amendment rights—freedom of
speech, association, and assembly, freedom of the press, and
freedom of religion supported by the strict separation of church
and state, (2) right to equal protection under the law—equal
treatment regardless of race, sex, religion, or national origin, (3)
right to due process—fair treatment by the government when-
ever the loss of your liberty or property is at stake, and (4) right
to privacy—freedom from unwarranted government intrusion
into your personal and private affairs.
The ACLU works to extend these rights to segments of the
population that have traditionally been denied these fundamen-
tal rights, including Native Americans and other people of color,
lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered persons, women,
mental health patients, prisoners, people with disabilities, and
the poor.
The ACLU has maintained the position that civil liberties
must be respected, even in times of national emergency. The
ACLU is supported by annual dues and contributions from its

dividuals. No government funding is accepted.

Amnesty International (AI) was founded in 1961 by Peter Benen-
son, a British lawyer. It was originally his intention to launch an
appeal in Britain with the aim of obtaining amnesty for prisoners
of conscience all over the world. The committee working for this
cause soon acquired extensive documentation about this category
of prisoner; it was so extensive that the committee discovered that
it would have to carry out the work more systematically and com-
prehensively and on a more permanent basis. AI is a world-em-
bracing movement that works for the protection of human rights.
It is independent of all governments and is neutral in relation to
its political goals, ideologies, and religious divisions. AI works for
the release of women and men who have been arrested for their
convictions, the color of their skin, or their ethnicity, race, or other
factors, provided that they have not themselves used force or ex-
horted others to resort to violence. AI proclaimed 1977 as Prison-
ers of Conscience Year and collected signatures for an appeal
addressed to the General Assembly of the United Nations.
In 1963 a general secretariat was established, and Sean
MacBride, a subsequent Nobel Prize winner, became chairman of
AI. In 1971, AI had more than 1,000 voluntary groups in twenty-
eight countries, and its membership figures were constantly
growing. AI has continuously worked for the forgotten prison-
ers, those who are prisoners of conscience. Furthermore, AI op-
poses the death penalty and seeks its abolition wherever it is
used. It is also against torture and the ill-treatment of prisoners.
These are the three most important tasks AI has set for itself. In
2006 there were 1.8 million members of AI in more than 150 coun-
tries. Major policy decisions for AI are made by an international
council of representatives from all national selections. AI’s na-
tional selections and local volunteer organizations are primarily
responsible for funding the movement, since no funds are sought
or accepted from any government. AI is independent of any gov-

The Center for Wrongful Convictions (CWC) is dedicated to iden-
tifying and rectifying wrongful convictions and other serious mis-
carriages of justice. CWC was cofounded in 1999 by Steven Drizin
and Lawrence C. Marshall and has three major components: (1)
representation, (2) research, and (3) community services. CWC
faculty, staff, cooperating outside attorneys, and Bluhm Legal
Clinic students investigate possible wrongful convictions and
represent imprisoned clients with claims of actual innocence. The
research component focuses upon identifying systemic problems
in the criminal justice system and, together with the community
services component, on developing initiatives designed to raise
public awareness of the prevalence, causes, and social costs of
wrongful convictions and to promote reform of the criminal jus-
tice system. Additionally, the community services component as-
sists exonerated former prisoners to cope with the difficult
process of reintegration into society.
The work of Steven Drizin and others who have helped
shape the goals of CWC has focused on unfair police interroga-
tions and tactics and false confessions. Collaborations with other
attorneys have led to legal reforms and initiatives dedicated to
freeing wrongfully convicted persons. The CWC’s efforts also in-
clude seeking to abolish the death penalty for juveniles in all U.S.
jurisdictions. CWC works closely with the American Bar Associa-
tion, the Juvenile Law Center, and Amnesty International.

Human Rights Watch (HRW) was begun in 1978 as Helsinki
Watch, to monitor compliance with Soviet bloc countries with the
human rights provisions of the landmark Helsinki Accords. In the
1980s, American Watch was established to counter the notion that
human rights abuses by one side in the war in Central America
were somehow more tolerable than abuses by the other. The orga-
nization grew to cover other world regions, until all of the “Watch”
committees were united in 1988 to form Human Rights Watch.
HRW is dedicated to protecting the human rights of persons
around the world. HRW stands with victims and activists to pre-
vent discrimination, to uphold political freedom, to protect peo-
ple from inhumane conduct in wartime, and to bring offenders to
justice. HRW investigates human rights violations and holds
abusers accountable. HRW challenges governments and those
who hold power to end abusive practices and respect interna-
tional rights law.
HRW is the largest human rights organization based in the
United States. It consists of more than 150 dedicated profession-
als—lawyers, journalists, academics, and country experts of many
nationalities and diverse backgrounds—who work around the
world. Often HRW joins with groups in both the United States
and other countries to further their common goals. A growing
contingent of volunteers supplements the work of trained profes-
sionals who work to further HRW’s interests.
HRW’s staff and researchers conduct fact-finding investiga-
tions into allegations of human rights abuses in all regions of the
world. HRW publishes these findings and distributes its publica-

The Innocence Project (IP) of the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of
Law was created by Barry C. Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld in 1992.
It was established and remains a nonprofit clinic. The IP handles
only cases in which postconviction DNA testing of evidence can
yield conclusive proof of one’s innocence. As it is a clinic, stu-
dents handle most of the case work while supervised by a team
of attorneys and staff.
Most clients of IP are poor and forgotten and have exhausted
all of their legal avenues of relief. The only hope they have is that
biological evidence from their case still exists and can be sub-
jected to DNA testing. All IP clients go through an extensive
screening process to determine whether DNA evidence could
prove their claims of innocence. Thousands of convicted offend-
ers currently await an evaluation of their cases by IP.
The IP is the forerunner in the field of wrongful convictions.
The IP has grown to become much more than the court of last re-
sort for inmates who have exhausted their appeals and their fi-
nancial resources. IP is now organizing the Innocence Network, a
group of law schools, journalism schools, and public defender of-
fices across the country that assists inmates who are trying to
prove their innocence whether or not the cases involve biological
evidence that can be subjected to DNA testing. The IP consults
with legislators and law enforcement officials at the state, local,
and federal levels, conducts research and training, produces schol-
arship, and proposes a wide range of remedies to prevent wrong-
ful convictions from occurring while continuing to work to free
innocent inmates through the use of postconviction DNA testing.
One important objective of IP is to heighten citizen aware-
ness and concern about the failings of the criminal justice system.

It is a facet of this society that eventually touches all of its citizens
in several important ways. The prospect of innocent persons lan-
guishing in jail, or worse, being put to death for crimes they did
not commit, should be intolerable for every American regardless
of race, politics, gender, origin, or creed.

The International Court of Justice is headquartered in the Peace
Palace at The Hague in The Netherlands. It is the official judicial
body for the United Nations, functions as a world court, and
hears and decides disputes between nations over international
crimes, the use of natural resources, and other matters of an in-
ternational nature. It also functions in an advisory capacity to
give individual member-states advice and counsel regarding in-
ternational matters that may arise and what possible alternative
actions may be taken. The International Court of Justice origi-
nated by charter on April 18, 1946, stemming from UN commit-
tee action in 1945 to create an international tribunal that could
function in an impartial manner to settle disputes and other mat-
ters between member nations, also referred to as states.
The International Court of Justice was preceded by the Per-
manent Court of International Justice, which existed from 1922 to
1946, although the idea for this court was set forth in discussions
and actions at The Hague Peace Conference of 1899. This body
eventually became the International Court of Justice. The Perma-
nent Court of International Justice was the creation of the League
of Nations. The League of Nations was formed following World
War I in 1919 with goals that included disarmament, preventing
war through negotiation and diplomacy, and improving global
welfare. The founding of the League of Nations was strongly in-
fluenced by U.S. president Woodrow Wilson.
The International Court of Justice is composed of fifteen per-
manent judges who are elected by the UN General Assembly and
the UN Security Council. Judges serve nine-year terms and may
be re-elected. Elections occur every three years, so that there is
constant turnover among judges representing different member
countries. Judges may sit as an entire bench, or they may sit in
three-judge or five-judge panels to hear less important cases or
disputes between nations. Sometimes smaller three-judge or five-
judge panels are assigned to hear cases of a specialized nature, in
which the testimony of experts is critical and must be closely eval-
uated and considered. In 2006 the president of the International
Court of Justice was Dame Rosalyn Higgins from the United King-
dom, while the vice president was Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh
from Jordan.

UN members are automatically parties to the Court’s
statutes. In all cases in which disputing parties agree to submit to
the rulings of the Court, these rulings are binding on the partici-
pating nations. The jurisdiction of the Court in any case is on the
basis of mutual consent between parties. Four methods are used
by the Court to establish jurisdiction:
1. Parties may refer cases to the Court. Although this
method does not involve compulsory jurisdiction, ex-
plicit consent is given where both parties desire a matter
to be resolved.
2. The Court has jurisdiction in all matters in which mod-
ern treaties are in force. Most treaties have provisions
concerning compromise, providing for dispute resolu-
tion and binding arbitration by the Court.
3. Optional clause declarations may be made by member
states. These declarations often contain reservations and
particular exclusions; thus they are not compulsory, and
the countries are not bound to abide by the terms of a
concluded arbitration. By 2005, sixty-five nations had
declarations in force.
4. Jurisdiction may occur through prior declarations and
treaties made under the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice. Thus, jurisdiction is transferred from older
treaties to influence contemporary decision-making.
The Security Council of the United Nations has a duty to
comply with all International Court of Justice decisions involving
member-states. If the disputing parties are Security Council
members and do not comply with the recommendations of the
arbitration board, enforcement action may be recommended to
the Security Council. Of course the Security Council has the right
to veto any enforcement action against any of its members, and
thus there is no way to force compliance. The International Court
of Justice decides all cases in accordance with international law.
Judicial decision-making is largely influenced by international
conventions, international customs, and general principles of law
recognized by civilized nations.

The National Bar Association (NBA) was established in 1925. It
represents the interests of African-American attorneys through-
out the United States. The association has several affiliate chapters
located throughout the country, including the Barristers’ Associa-
tion of Philadelphia and the Garden State Bar Association. At the
time of its formation, the NBA had fewer than 1,000 black lawyers
to represent, and fewer than 250 of them joined the NBA at the
time it was organized. Today the organization boasts a substantial
membership and exists in most states. The objectives of the NBA
are to advance the science of jurisprudence; to improve the ad-
ministration of justice; to preserve the independence of the judi-
ciary and uphold the honor and integrity of the legal profession;
to promote professional and social intercourse among the mem-
bers of the American and the international bars; to promote legis-
lation that will improve the economic condition of all American
citizens, regardless of race, sex, or creed, in their efforts to secure
free and untrammeled use of the franchise guaranteed by the
Constitution of the United States; and to protect the civil and po-
litical rights of all citizens and residents of the United States.
The NBA has operated a lawyer referral center for those ac-
cused of crimes, especially minorities; fostered longtime alliances
with various legal organizations, including the American Bar

the nation’s leading advocate for frontline attorneys and other
equal justice professionals—those who make a difference in the
lives of low-income clients and their families and communities.
NLADA was founded in 1911 as the result of combining fifteen
legal aid societies together to form a National Alliance of Legal
Aid Societies. Arthur von Briesen of the Legal Aid Society of New
York was the first president of the organization. The name of the
organization was changed several times but was eventually
changed to its present name in 1958. Representing legal aid and
defender programs, as well as individual advocates, NLADA is
the oldest and largest national, nonprofit, membership associa-
tion devoting 100 percent of its resources to serving the broad

meetings of Portland, Oregon’s, review board, also known as the
Police Chief’s Forum. The PCPOPSG publishes a newsletter, Peo-
ple’s Police Report, which includes information about local and na-
tional police accountability efforts. Police behavior is observed in
different parts of Portland, and contacts are made and informa-
tion is spread throughout the community. The goals of PCPOPSG
are: (1) to empower victims of police misconduct to pursue their
grievances, with the goal of resolving individual cases and pre-
venting future occurrences; (2) to educate the general public and
in particular target groups of police abuse on their rights and re-
sponsibilities; and (3) to promote and monitor an effective system
for civilian oversight of police. One of the first lines of defense for
fair court treatment and subsequent sentencing equitability is fair
treatment by police. Accountability mechanisms are in place to
ensure that citizen-police encounters are smooth and that one’s
rights are observed at all stages following an arrest.

Development, and the organization quickly became an indepen-

entific, educational, and charitable purposes for the public welfare
and the security of the United States. For nearly sixty years RC de-
cision-makers in both the public and private sectors have objec-
tively sought to analyze and devise solutions for various
challenges facing the world. These challenges include economic is-
sues, social issues, and related problems of education, poverty,
crime, and the environment, as well as national security concerns.
During the 1970s and 1980s, RC undertook various projects
related to sentencing offenders. RC examined the impact of the
three-strikes-and-you’re-out law enacted by the California legis-
lature. It was apparent that Californians and others were being
impacted by a fear of crime, sympathy for crime victims and their
families, and anger at violent criminals. RC sought to provide
hard evidence for voters to consider concerning the various im-
plications of the three-strikes law. How much crime reduction
could be expected as a result of the law? What about the alterna-
tives? And where will the money come from? RC sought to an-
swer these questions with research from those on its staff with
corrections interests. Peter Greenwood and Joan Petersilia are
two of the many persons who undertook an analysis of those and
related issues with positive and influential results. Analytical
models were constructed that predicted how populations of of-
fenders on the street and in prison would change under the dif-
fering sentencing provisions of the new law and under various
alternatives. Using data on those populations, researchers were
able to estimate crime rates and costs. Also investigated has been
intensive supervised probation and parole for various types of
offenders, including drug offenders. The results of RC research
have helped to shape and modify public opinion and legislative
actions in recent years. RC research continues in those and other
important sentencing and offender supervision areas.

The Sentencing Project (SP) is a national organization working for
a fair and effective criminal justice system by promoting reforms
in sentencing law and practice, and alternatives to incarceration.
The SP was founded in 1986 to provide defense lawyers with sen-
tencing advocacy training and to reduce the reliance on incarcer-
ation. Since that time, the SP has become a leader in the effort to
bring national attention to disturbing trends and inequities in the
criminal justice system, with a successful formula that includes
the publication of groundbreaking research, aggressive media
campaigns, and strategic advocacy for policy reform.
As a result of the SP’s research, publications, and advocacy,
many people know that this country is the world’s leader in in-
carceration, that one in three young black men is under the con-
trol of the criminal justice system, that 5 million Americans can’t
vote because of felony convictions, and that thousands of women
and children have lost welfare, education, and housing benefits
as a result of convictions for minor drug offenses. The SP is ded-
icated to changing the way Americans think about crime and
punishment.

The United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) was created by
the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 as a part of the Comprehensive
Crime Control Act of 1984. The sentencing guidelines established
by the commission are designed to (1) incorporate the purposes of
sentencing (for example, just punishment, deterrence, incapacita-
tion, and rehabilitation), (2) provide certainty and fairness in
meeting the purposes of sentencing by avoiding unwarranted dis-
parity among offenders with similar characteristics convicted of
similar criminal conduct, while permitting sufficient judicial flex-
ibility to take into account relevant aggravating and mitigating
factors, and (3) reflect to the extent practicable, advancement in

the knowledge of human behavior as it relates to the criminal jus-
tice process.
The USSC is charged with the ongoing responsibility of eval-
uating the effects of sentencing guidelines on the criminal justice
system, recommending to Congress appropriate modifications of
substantive criminal law and sentencing procedures, and estab-
lishing a research and development program on sentencing is-
sues. Additionally, the Sentencing Reform Act abolished parole
for offenders sentenced under the guidelines so that the sentence
received would basically be the sentence served. Under the fed-
eral law, federal inmates may earn up to 54 days of credit a year
for good behavior, otherwise known as good time. That figure is
approximately 15 percent of a year, and it complies with a truth-
in-sentencing federal provision subsequently approved by the
USSC in that federal offenders must serve at least 85 percent of
their sentences before becoming eligible for early release from
prison.
The USSC was created primarily to codify existing criminal
laws and make them more uniform. Furthermore, considerable
judicial abuse of discretion was prevalent throughout the federal
judiciary and among circuits. Critics of pre-USSC judicial officiat-
ing and decision-making cited the following as factors justifying
the creation of the USSC: (1) the previously unfettered sentencing
discretion of federal trial judges needed to be more structured, (2)
the administration of punishment needed to be more certain, and
(3) specific offenders (for example, white collar, violent, and re-
peat offenders) needed to be targeted for more serious penalties.
Subsequently, Congress authorized a permanent commission
charged with formulating national sentencing guidelines, known
as presumptive guidelines, to define the parameters for federal
trial judges to follow in their sentencing decisions.
The new sentencing guidelines went into effect on Novem-
ber 1, 1987. There were several challenges to those guidelines,
most notably Mistretta v. United States (1989). The Mistretta case
argued that the federal sentencing guidelines were unconstitu-
tional because they violated the separation of powers doctrine.
That was because some members of the USSC were also federal
district court judges. Thus judges were both creating law and im-
plementing it, apparently violating the separation of powers doc-
trine. Justice Scalia agreed with that position, although the other
members of the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the argument and
upheld the constitutionality of the guidelines. Subsequent U.S.
204
Directory of Organizations

Supreme Court decisions (United States v. Booker, 2005; Blakely v.
Washington, 2004) decided that the Sixth Amendment right to a
jury trial applies to the federal sentencing guidelines. A remedial
opinion by the U.S. Supreme Court, however, excised two provi-
sions from the guidelines that removed their mandatory applica-
tion. Today federal district court judges are obliged to consult
these guidelines and take them into account when sentencing
federal offenders, although the guidelines are not binding on
these judges. Circuit courts of appeal may review any appeals al-
leging unreasonableness on the part of district court trial judges
if it is believed that their decisions in the application of the guide-
lines are unreasonable.
In theory, the sentencing guidelines promulgated by the
USSC provide federal district court judges with fair and consis-
tent guideline ranges to consult at the time of sentencing. The
guidelines take into account both the seriousness of criminal con-
duct as well as the defendant’s criminal record. Each offender is
assigned to a criminal history category and one of forty-three of-
fense levels. Where those values intersect in the body of a guide-
lines table defines a range of months that judges may choose for
sentencing purposes. Judges must choose a sentence from within
the guideline range unless one or more factors result in contem-
plating a different sentence. Since the USSC cannot create every
conceivable contingency for sentencing, there is room for subjec-
tive interpretation among federal district court judges. Usually,
whenever departures from guidelines are contemplated by fed-
eral judges, they must write a rationale articulating the reason(s)
for their departure. Those reasons are usually acceptable to ap-
pellate courts, should defendants decide to challenge them or
their constitutionality.

The Vera Institute began in 1961 with an experiment conducted
by Louis Schweitzer, an active philanthropist, and Herb Sturz, a
young magazine editor. They recognized the injustice of the U.S.
bail system that granted liberty based upon income. Together
they created the Vera Foundation (VF), which later became the
Vera Institute of Justice (VIJ). With a small group of researchers
working in tandem with some of New York City’s criminal
courts, they explored the bail problem and devised a solution.
The experiment in bail reform led to widespread release on one’s
own recognizance, or ROR, where it was proved that New York-
ers too poor to afford bail but with strong community ties could
be safely released before trial and would subsequently reappear
for their hearings. Supplemental funding was obtained in 1966
from the Ford Foundation to further VIJ’s interests.
The mission of the VIJ is to work closely with governmental
leaders and civil society to improve services that people rely upon
for safety and justice. The VIJ develops innovative, affordable pro-
grams that often grow into self-sustaining organizations; studies
social problems and current responses; and provides practical ad-
vice and assistance to governmental officials in New York and
around the world. VIJ’s staff are leading more than two dozen sep-
arate projects, each aiming to reveal more about the meaning of
justice even as they make a difference in the lives of individuals.
These projects include efforts to serve troubled and delinquent
children at home instead of in juvenile institutions; to reduce vio-
lence against women; to help state leaders develop affordable and
humane sentencing policies; and to strengthen police-community
relations. Today VIJ is a leader in developing unexpected yet prac-
tical and affordable solutions to some of the toughest problems in
the administration of justice, and thereby making justice systems
more humane, fair, and efficient for everyone.
One division of the VIJ is the Center on Sentencing and Cor-
rections (CSC), which provides support to governmental officials
charged with addressing their jurisdiction’s sentencing and cor-
rections policies. CSC’s staff and researchers study and analyze
state sentencing and correctional programs. They have devel-
oped a national database and archive to assist states in better un-
derstanding how their systems work and how they compare
with the sentencing systems of other jurisdictions. Both jails and
prisons are targets of CSC intervention and study. Evaluations
are made of various types of sentencing plans and how regional
jails and prisons will be impacted or affected by those changes.

Because so many entering inmates of prisons and jails have drug-
related dependencies, the CSC studies treatment options for non-
violent drug offenders and has worked aggressively with
policy-makers in various states, including New York, to improve
contemporary parole practices to better meet the needs of drug-
dependent offenders.

An alternative dispute resolution is victim-offender reconcilia-
tion. Victim-offender reconciliation is a specific form of conflict
resolution between the victim and the offender. Face-to-face en-
counter is the essence of this process. Elkhart County, Indiana,
has been the site of the Victim-Offender Reconciliation Project
(VORP) since 1987. The primary aims of VORP are (1) to make of-
fenders accountable for their wrongs against victims, (2) to re-
duce recidivism among participating offenders, and (3) to
heighten responsibility of offenders through victim compensa-
tion and repayment for damages inflicted. A subsequent mission
statement was released in 2004. The mission of VORP has been
revised to bring restorative justice reform to our criminal and ju-
venile justice systems, to empower victims, offenders, and com-
munities to heal the effects of crime, to curb recidivism, and to
offer society a more effective and humane alternative to the
growing outcry for more prisons and more punishment.
VORP was established in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada, in 1974
and was subsequently replicated as PACT, or Prisoner and Com-
munity Together, in northern Indiana near Elkhart. Subsequent
replications in various jurisdictions have created different vari-
eties of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), each variety
spawning embellishments, additions, or program deletions
deemed more or less important by that particular jurisdiction. The
Genessee County (Batavia), New York, Sheriff’s Department es-
tablished a VORP in 1983, followed by programs in Valparaiso,
Indiana; Quincy, Massachusetts; and Minneapolis, Minnesota, in
1985. In Massachusetts, the program was named EARN-IT and

was operated through the Probation Department. More than
twenty-five different states have one or another version of VORP.
One of these sites involved a study of offender recidivism and
ADR. Investigations of ADR and its effectiveness have tended to
reduce recidivism among affected offenders. Associates of VORP
include mediators and trainers with backgrounds in psychother-
apy, education, public administration, and law. VORP serves non-
profit organizations, government agencies, and individuals.

Allender, David M. 2004. “Offender Reentry: A Returning or
Reformed Criminal?” FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin 73: 1–10.
Offender re-entry into the community is an increasingly impor-
tant topic in community corrections and corrections generally.
The question is whether prisons and jails adequately prepare in-
mates for their subsequent transition into communities in which
their lives are less regimented. Not only are living conditions se-
verely different, but adaptations of newly released offenders are
expected. These adaptations to normal community living assume
that inmates have received the necessary vocational and educa-
tional training, counseling, and other services while confined, so
that they may successfully adapt to community living and lead
law-abiding lives. The reality is that most prisons fail to prepare
inmates for subsequent community living, and the various
causes of that failure are examined. One cause is the lack of
money with which to hire sufficient personnel to perform train-
ing services. Money earmarked for corrections is often diverted
by state legislatures to local noncorrections-related projects. Ac-
countability mechanisms are nonexistent in many jurisdictions.
Thus, it is unclear how the money is allocated to projects and ac-
tivities unrelated to the correctional services originally intended
for such funds. The problems of accountability for correctional
209

expenditures are examined and contrasted with the failure of
many inmates to adjust adequately to community living.
Belenko, S. 2006. “Assessing Released Inmates for Substance-
Abuse-Related Service Needs.” Crime and Delinquency 52:
94–113.
Many inmates released from prison unconditionally or on parole
suffer from continuing substance-abuse problems. These prob-
lems need to be addressed effectively by appropriate and man-
dated community programming. Despite the recognition of the
necessity for such programming, many communities lack the
funds or resources to provide such services to growing numbers
of offenders in need of treatment. The implications of offender
needs and existing community services are explored.
Bergeron, Christine E., and Stuart J. McKelvie. 2004. “Effects of
Defendant Age on Severity of Punishment for Different
Crimes.” Journal of Social Psychology 144: 75–90.
Research examines the effects of defendant age on the severity of
punishment for various crimes. After reading a murder or theft
vignette in which the perpetrator was a twenty-, forty-, or sixty-
year-old man, ninety-five undergraduates gave sentence and pa-
role recommendations for the offender’s act. Punishment was
harsher for the murder than for the theft. For murder, partici-
pants treated the twenty- and sixty-year-old men less harshly
than the forty-year-old men, which confirms previous archival
findings. However, this inverted U-shaped function occurred for
murder only. Results are discussed in the context of the just-
desert and utilitarian rationales that guide sentencing. Sugges-
tions for future research are discussed.

Diversion programs are examined as they impact formal court
processing of criminal cases. Are diversion programs accom-
plishing their goals of heightening offender accountability, en-
suring public safety, and individualizing offender treatment?
Findings suggest that diversion is a useful and productive alter-
native to formal offender processing. Court delays are reduced

Denov, Myriam S., and Kathryn M. Campbell. 2005. “Under-
standing the Causes, Effects and Responses to Wrongful Con-
viction.” Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice 21: 224–249.
One egregious consequence of a vigorous prosecution is the con-
viction of innocent persons. Overwhelming circumstantial evi-
dence may be presented resulting in the wrongful conviction of
persons who have committed no crime. The systemic features of
the appellate process are examined in this context. It is quite diffi-
cult for higher courts to overturn wrongful convictions, since the
system is weighed heavily in favor of prosecutors and the state. It
is assumed by higher courts that trial courts were correct in con-
victing persons initially, and it takes overwhelming evidence to
convince higher courts otherwise. Since many of those who are
wrongly convicted are coincidentally indigent and cannot mount
the same quality of defense as more affluent offenders, this raises
questions of fairness in terms of minority and socioeconomic fac-
tors. The causes, effects, and responses to wrongful conviction are
explored and several solutions proposed.

Severity and Crime: Accepting the Null Hypothesis.” In Crime
and Justice: A Review of Research, Volume 30. Michael Tonry, ed.
Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 143–195.
This review probes an aspect of general deterrence: the effects of
sentence severity on crime. It concentrates primarily on studies
conducted over the past decade, with special consideration of
those that examine the dramatic changes in sentencing policy that
occurred during the 1990s. The literature in this area has been
studied many times in the past twenty-five years. Most reviews
conclude that there is little or no consistent evidence that harsher
sanctions reduce crime rates in Western populations. Neverthe-
less, scholars have been reluctant to conclude that variation in the
severity of sentence does not have differential deterrent impacts.
A reasonable assessment of the research to date justifies the notion
that sentence severity has no effect on the level of crime in society.
The time has come to accept the null hypothesis.

Draine, M., T. L. Sia, and D. F. Dansereau. 2006. “Improving
Early Engagement and Treatment Readiness of Probationers:
Gender Differences.” Prison Journal 86: 1552–1572.
A comparison of male and female offenders placed on probation
shows that women have greater success rates on probation than
men. The reasons for these differences are examined. Women are
more likely than men to be responsive to community programs
designed to assist them in making the transition to community
living and remaining law-abiding. Male-female differences are
assessed. Various factors are considered as explanations for why
women are more successful on probation, and why men have
more difficulty in making successful probation adjustments.
Farrell, Jill. 2003. “Mandatory Minimum Firearm Penalties: A
Source of Sentencing Disparity?” Justice Research and Policy 5:
95–115.
This study examines how mandatory minimum firearm penalties
are applied in Maryland. Data are obtained from Maryland circuit
courts for all multiple- and single-count violent offenses that oc-
curred between July 1, 1987, and July 1, 1995 (19,995). Only 37 per-
cent of eligible offenders are ultimately convicted under the
mandatory minimum statute, and they receive approximately
three years more on their sentence as a result of the mandatory
minimum. The penalty is not applied randomly, but prosecutors
do exhibit an organized effort to target the more serious offenders
who commit more serious crimes. Race and gender, however, also
exert a significant effect on the outcome, controlling for prior
record, offense severity, offense type, other demographic charac-
teristics, and case processing variables. Specifically, black offend-
ers are more likely to receive the mandatory penalty than whites,
and women are less likely to receive the penalty than men.
Whereas it is possible that race and gender are only proxies for
other, unobserved characteristics, this finding serves as an upper
boundary on the size of the gender and race effect in prosecutor-
ial discretion, and it demonstrates the potential for disparity in
the charge bargaining stage of the sentencing process. Future re-
search should pay close attention to multiple stages in the sen-
tencing process and multiple-count data to estimate unwarranted
disparity whenever possible.

Fleury, Steiner Benjamin, and Victor Argothy. 2004. “Lethal Bor-
ders: Elucidating Jurors’ Racialized Discipline to Punish in
Latino Defendant Death Cases.” Punishment and Society 6: 67–84.
Contemporary anti-immigration and tough-on-crime images of
the threatening alien have direct implications for understanding
how modern death sentencing decisions are racialized. This re-
search focuses on the historic racialization of Latin Americans in
popular culture, in key state legislative initiatives, and in capital
punishment decisions. Data, drawn from the Capital Jury Project,
are based on the narratives of thirty-five jurors who served in
some fourteen cases in Texas and California in which a Latino de-
fendant was sentenced to death. Erecting a racial binary, capital
jurors as penal activists impose the death sentence on Latino de-
fendants as part of a broader assimilationist-infused strategy for
doing punishment. It is argued that, in a historically racist soci-
ety such as the United States, the decision to impose the death
sentence itself is mobilized as a broader, historically situated
form of racialized discipline.
Harris, Victoria, and Christos Dagadakis. 2004. “Length of Incar-
ceration: Was Their Parity for Mentally Ill Offenders?” Interna-
tional Journal of Law and Psychiatry 27: 387–393.
Two groups of detainees in U.S. county jails—mentally ill offend-
ers (MIOs) and nonmentally ill offenders (NMIOs)—are exam-
ined to answer two questions: (1) if previous criminal history was
controlled for and the sample size of a comparative study was
greatly increased, would the results suggesting that MIOs were
incarcerated for a significantly longer period of time hold? and (2)
how large an effect does the presence of a mental illness have on
the length of incarceration for MIOs? Data were obtained through
official records for 127 detainees who were housed in the psychi-
atric unit at the King County Correctional Facility in Seattle,
Washington, during 1990, and 127 detainees who were incarcer-
ated during 1990 but not on the psychiatric unit. Whereas MIOs
had a lower rate of previous misdemeanor arrests, there was no
statistical difference found in the length of incarceration for the
index misdemeanor crime. This suggests that factors other than
age, gender, current crime severity, mental illness, and previous
criminal history were involved in the determination of the length
of incarceration. NMIOs statistically also had significantly more
severe histories of prior felony arrests, yet no difference in the
Annotated Print Resources
213

mean incarceration length was found. Alarger percentage of MIOs
served their entire sentence. Based on relative homelessness, how-
ever, a lower rate of MIOs were released on bail or personal recog-
nizance. Overall, when age, gender, and crime severity are
considered, mental illness does not statistically influence length of
incarceration. The presence of a mental illness may easily result in
a longer incarceration for an individual. There was a disparity in
the length of sentence for both serious and minor crimes, although
the difference was not statistically significant.
Hartwell, Stephanie. 2004. “Triple Stigma: Persons with Mental
Illness and Substance Abuse Problems in the Criminal Justice
System.” Criminal Justice Policy Review 15: 84–99.
This study focuses on individuals with a dual diagnosis and ex-
amines policies creating the trajectories for mentally ill people
with substance-use problems and their community re-entry after
involvement with the criminal justice system. Subjects were di-
vided into three groups: a preadjudication group (n = 171), a
postadjudication group serving a prison or misdemeanor sen-
tence averaging 4 months (n = 212), and a postadjudication
group serving a prison or felony sentence averaging four years (n
= 118). Tracking data were gathered from the Forensic Transition
Team program administered by the Massachusetts Department
of Mental Health. In comparison with offenders with mental ill-
ness, the dually diagnosed were more likely to be serving sen-
tences related to their substance use, to be homeless and to
violate probation after release, and to recidivate to correctional
custody. An examination of substance abuse histories, short-term
community outcomes, and service trends 3 months postrelease
suggests various public policy and social service directions.

This essay and review addresses some of the theoretical and con-

which fact and value are negotiated to correspond with the
moral ideologies of the powerful. For international penalty to
progress beyond partisan ideology, rhetorical symbolism and the
dynamics of retribution and vindictiveness require us to recog-
nize and comprehend how moral values and action are linked
through process, and the significance of that for the legitimacy of
punishment. For victims and victim communities in interna-
tional conflict, this means conceiving of participation and rights
as processual reality, and recognizing that any constructive en-
gagement with notions of truth and justice must be grounded in
context.
Holleran, David, and Cassia Spohn. 2004. “On the Use of the
Total Incarceration Variable in Sentencing Research.” Criminol-

This research questions the use of the total incarceration response
variable that has been incorporated into sentencing studies over
the past thirty years. Specifically, using 1998 data from the Penn-
sylvania Commission on Sentencing, it demonstrates that prison
and jail represent two distinct institutions, and that the judge’s
decision on disposition should take that factor into account.
Based on these findings, researchers should reconsider the use of
the total incarceration variable, which combines prison and jail
into a single response category.
Ireland, Connie Stivers, and JoAnn Prause. 2005. “Discretionary
Parole Release: Length of Imprisonment, Percent of Sentence
Served, and Recidivism.” Journal of Crime and Justice 28: 27–49.
Length of imprisonment of a sample of inmates, the actual per-
centage of time served, and the amount of recidivism are ob-
served over a three-year period following discretionary release
through parole board action. Although recidivism rates were
lower for those who had served greater portions of their sen-
tences before being paroled, the differences between these
parolees and those paroled after serving shorter sentences were
not significant statistically. Questions pertaining to how much
time should be served before parole consideration are examined.
Length of imprisonment does not appear to be a deterrent to fu-
ture recidivism among those paroled after serving shorter or
longer portions of their sentences.

This research examines the process of sex-based differentiation in
sentencing outcomes for 194 men and 194 women sentenced be-
tween 1990 and 1997 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Subjects
were selected from two court registers: the High Court’s “Return
of Prisoners Tried and Sentenced” and the District Court’s “Re-
turn of Persons Committed for Trial and Sentence.” Only cases
involving drug, violent, and property offenses for adult offend-
ers (aged seventeen and over) were analyzed. Consistent with
past research, results showed that judicial processing treated
women more leniently than men. Path analyses revealed that
judges were less likely to sentence women than men to impris-
onment because of gendered information and decisions made
earlier in the judicial process, such as criminal history, length of
custodial remands, and presentence recommendations by proba-
tion officers. In contrast, judges exercised considerably more le-
niency toward women than men in setting the length of prison
terms, even after statistically controlling for all sex-differentiated
factors such as criminal history.

Whenever judges depart from sentencing guidelines, it is ex-
pected and mandated that they will provide a rationale in writ-
ing for doing so. The factors justifying the guideline departure
must be clearly articulated. It is often difficult to separate legal
from extralegal factors when making sentencing guideline de-
parture decisions. An examination of the extralegal factors re-
sponsible for guideline departures is made, and suggestions for
correcting departures based on racial, gender, ethnic, and socioe-
conomic factors are provided.

This study examines the impact of Florida’s habitual offender
law on crime. It attempts to mitigate the problems found in sim-
ilar studies, such as a failure to consider the incapacitation effects
that may be responsible for most of the law’s impact but that may
not appear until years after the law is passed; failure to address
simultaneity issues; and omitting needed control variables to
avoid spurious or suppressed results. A multiple time-series de-
sign of pooled annual data for fifty-eight counties in Florida from
1980 to 1998 was analyzed. Crime rates were measured using
Uniform Crime Report data; habitual offender law data were ob-
tained from inmate files provided by the Florida Department of
Corrections.
Procedures that criminologists can use to overcome method-
ological problems plaguing habitual offender law research are
outlined. Procedures include conducting a sentencing outcome
analysis to estimate the extra amount of prison time imposed on
offenders, using the Granger causality test to help resolve simul-
taneity issues between habitual offender laws and crime, and
using a multiple time-series design that provides for a large sam-
ple size and allows one to enter proxy variables for unknown fac-
tors that affect crime.
Florida’s habitual offender law may have slightly reduced
rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft, but there
is little evidence that changes in crime immediately follow pas-
sage or application of the law. Four possible explanations are dis-
cussed. Florida’s habitual offender law has not been very
effective at reducing crime; the legislature should consider re-
pealing it and sentencing repeat offenders under the state’s sen-
tencing guidelines.

available. Of the 188 cities, 110 were in states that had passed

three strikes laws between 1993 and 1996. No credible statistical
evidence was found that the passage of three strikes laws reduces
crime by deterring potential criminals or incapacitating repeat of-
fenders. Furthermore, no evidence of an immediate or gradual de-
crease in crime rates and homicide rates was positively associated
with the passage of three strikes laws. The findings for the state-
specific analysis were mixed, with some states showing increases
in some crimes, and other showing decreases. As such, policy-
makers should reconsider the costs and benefits associated with
three strikes laws. Although the laws have failed to produce what
is arguably one of the most important benefits, a reduction in
crime, researchers have identified numerous costs associated with
three strikes and other habitual offender laws, including racial
disparity in their application and the financial costs of increased
trials and of providing medical care to aging prisoners. Re-
searchers should also continue to explore this topic, especially in
light of the continual advances in research methodology.

view 14: 229–248.
This study creates a profile of criminals incarcerated under
Florida’s 10–20–Life statute—the initial stage of a postimpact
analysis of the statute. Passed in July 1999, Florida’s 10–20–Life
legislation requires that an offender who possesses a firearm dur-
ing the commission of a crime must serve a minimum term of im-
prisonment of ten years. An offender who discharges a weapon
during a crime must serve a minimum term of twenty years. Fi-
nally, an offender who discharges a firearm and inflicts death or
great bodily harm must serve a minimum term of not less than
twenty-five years and not more than life. Individual and criminal
offense data on all incarcerated 10–20–Life offenders (1,065 as of
November 1, 2001) are collected from the Florida Department of
Corrections. Subjects are overwhelmingly male (96 percent), and
one-half are ages twenty-three to forty-one. Some 80 percent of of-
fenses are for felonies committed while in possession of a firearm
or concealed weapon, and robbery with a firearm or deadly
weapon. Slightly more than half of the offenders are sentenced to
a term of three years; the remaining receive ten or more years. The
average sentence is eight years. The average sentence length is sig-

Kurlychek, Megan C., and Brian D. Johnson. 2004. “The Juvenile
Penalty: A Comparison of Juvenile and Young Adult Sentenc-
ing Outcomes in Criminal Court.” Criminology 42: 485–517.
This is an investigation of the sentencing of juvenile offenders
processed in adult criminal court by comparing their sentencing
outcomes to those of young adult offenders in similar situations.
The expanded juvenile exclusion and transfer policies of the
1990s have led to an increase in the number of juveniles con-
victed in adult courts; thus, it is critical to better understand the
judicial decision-making process involved. Data were obtained
from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing for the sen-
tencing outcomes of 1,042 juveniles and 33,962 young adults
(ages eighteen to twenty-four) processed in the state’s adult crim-
inal justice system over a three-year period (1997–1999). Overall,
juvenile offenders in adult court are sentenced more severely
than their young adult counterparts. Moreover, juvenile status
interacts with and conditions the effects of other important sen-
tencing factors, including offense type, offense severity, and prior
criminal record. These findings suggest that judges may attribute
less importance to traditional legal variables when sentencing ju-
veniles in court, and that the impact of both offense severity and
prior record is significantly less for juvenile offenders than for
young adult offenders. Although this finding may suggest that
juvenile status overshadows other traditional sentencing consid-
erations typically found to impact sentencing in adult court, fu-
ture research is needed to substantiate that claim. Nevertheless,
this decreased reliance on legal criteria may be related to the
overt salience of juvenile status in adult court. That is, while all
other legal and extralegal factors included in this analysis are
typical considerations before the adult court judge, juvenile sta-
tus is a unique identifier for this category of offender that is not
present in the majority of sentencing decisions. As such, court-
room actors may afford it more weight relative to other sentenc-
ing considerations.

Attention is focused on successful parolees who adjust to commu-
nity living after serving various prison terms. Whether inmates are
released through discretionary parole or mandatory parole seems
to make little difference in their subsequent community adjust-
ment. Focus is given to preparole programs provided to these in-
mates while confined. Vocational and educational training seem to
factor prominently into their subsequent successful (or unsuccess-
ful) community adjustment, and whether their law-abiding be-
havior is affected significantly. Counseling, individual or group, is
considered quite important in determining whether offenders can
make satisfactory psychological and social adjustments to com-
munity living. Sentencing solutions should include court-ordered
counseling and other services, regardless of whether institutions
can provide them. The failure of institutions to provide such ser-
vices should obligate those institutions to demand funding to fur-
nish the necessary personnel and other ancillary materials and
resources necessary to effectively provide for the needs of offend-
ers in preparole stages. Various solutions are considered.

This work is an investigation into the clinical effects of a deliber-
ately positively focused relapse prevention (RP) approach for sex
offenders focusing on the creation of a “good life.” It hypothe-
sizes that clients completing this approach would develop more
commitment to preventing relapse and engage the RP interven-
tion more effectively than those completing the more traditional
avoidance-oriented RP intervention. A total of forty-seven in-
mates convicted of sex offenses were randomly assigned to the
two groups, which were matched on age, risk, and sentence
length. All participants completed an 8-month group treatment
program. Data were gathered from the RP Interview, the Self-Es-
teem Questionnaire, risk diaries, and therapist ratings and inter-
views. Results indicated that subjects who completed the
approach-focused intervention had a greater engagement in
treatment as measured by homework compliance and willing-
ness to disclose lapses. Furthermore, these offenders were rated
by therapists as being more genuinely motivated to live without
offending by the end of treatment. However, marked differences
failed to emerge between the groups with regard to changes in

Mauer, Marc, Ryan S. King, and Malcolm S. Young. 2004. The
Meaning of “Life”: Long Prison Sentences in Context. Washing-

Drawing on official statistics, this report assesses the dramatic in-
crease in the imposition of life sentences in the context of inca-
pacitation and public safety, fiscal costs, and the sentencing goal
of punishment. Currently, 9.4 percent of offenders in state/federal
prison are serving a life sentence. Of those, 26.3 percent are serv-
ing a sentence of life without parole. The number of lifers rose by
83 percent between 1992 and 2003. In six states—Illinois, Iowa,
Louisiana, Maine, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota—all life sen-
tences are imposed without the possibility of parole. The increase
in prison time for lifers results from changes in state policy rather
than continuous increases in violent crime. A total of 79.4 percent
of lifers released in 1994 had no arrests for a new crime in the
three years following release. That compares to an arrest-free rate
of 32.5 percent for all inmate releases. Finally, imposing a life sen-
tence carries a potential cost to taxpayers of $1 million.

One result of a get tough policy relating to sentencing is growing
inmate populations in prisons and jails, as more offenders are
given longer sentences with the expectation that they will serve
greater portions of those sentences under truth-in-sentencing ac-
companying statutes. The implications of such a get-tough policy
are explored, both from a practical standpoint of funding the cre-

ining Racial Disparity of Male Property Offenders in the Mis-
souri Juvenile Justice System.” Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice
2: 107–128.
On the basis of 1994 juvenile court data on 4,284 male juvenile
property offenders, this study investigates the extent of racial dis-
parity and discrimination in six Missouri counties. Logistic regres-
sion analyses were used to test the probability of juveniles being
processed in the system at four decision-making points: referral,
detention, adjudication, and disposition, controlling for available
legal factors and county type. Evidence emerged of contextual
racial discrimination in some jurisdictions at the petition, deten-
tion, and adjudication stages. In all counties combined, blacks
were more likely to be formally referred and detained before adju-
dication, whereas whites were more likely to be adjudicated. The
earlier intake decision produced the most collective racial dispar-
ity, a finding reported in other studies. The importance of jurisdic-
tional differences among counties is demonstrated.

Roberts, Julian V. 2003. “Public Opinion and Mandatory Sen-
tencing: A Review of International Findings.” Criminal Justice
and Behavior 30: 483–508.
This article examines the findings from public opinion surveys re-
lated to mandatory sentencing. Evidence from several countries
indicates that public support for mandatory sentencing is quite
limited. Support is strongest when a general question is posed
that permits respondents to supply their own image of the kinds
of offenders likely to be affected by mandatory sentencing laws
and when there is no reference to the impact of mandatory sen-
tencing laws on the principles of sentencing (such as a loss of pro-
portionality in sentencing). When confronted with specific cases,
however, the public rejects mandatory sentences, especially
strongly in the case of nonviolent offenders. Moreover, the limited
research evidence suggests that few members of the public are
aware of mandatory penalties, and providing information about
such sentences has no effect on either their perceptions of crime
seriousness or their confidence in the sentencing process. This
suggests that whatever their merits, mandatory sentences of im-
prisonment do not necessarily advance the goals of deterrence.
Furthermore, there is only limited public support for the sentenc-
ing goals of denunciation and deterrence that underlie mandatory
sentencing. The public appears to be more concerned with desert-
based sentencing, which emphasizes proportional punishments
to which mandatory minima are anathema. By limiting a court’s
ability to impose a proportional sentence, mandatory minima can
violate the principle of proportionality, and that is likely to un-
dermine, rather than enhance, public confidence in the courts.
Nonetheless, whatever happens with respect to these punitive
laws, it is important to have a comprehensive and accurate view
of where the public stands. To achieve a fair and valid assessment
of public attitudes, therefore, respondents must be made aware of
the effects of mandatory sentences on proportional, desert-based
sentencing. They should also be provided with specific examples
of the range of cases affected by mandatory sentencing legislation.

and review addresses some of the persistent objections to allow-
ing victim input into sentencing. By placing the debate on victim
input within its historical context, it suggests that the movement
to provide victims with a voice has been derailed, as the com-
municative model of victim input—originally envisioned by the
reform movement as its justification—was replaced by a model
stressing the influence of victim impact statements on sentenc-
ing. Much of the lingering opposition to victim input rights has
been animated by this “impact” model, which is theoretically
misconceived, empirically unsupported, and at odds with major
sentencing aims. The communicative model, which reflects the
original intent and purpose of the victim reform concerning
input, is reintroduced, and its benefits for both victims and of-
fenders are elaborated. Two examples from the field are pro-
vided, and a call is made to reassess current theory and practice
regarding victim integration in sentencing. Policy recommenda-
tions are outlined.
Rodriguez, Nancy. 2003. “The Impact of Three-Strikes-and-

Habitual Offenders.” Criminal Justice Policy Review 14: 106–127.
This research focuses on how implementation of habitual of-
fender laws has affected the sentencing of repeat, violent offend-
ers. Using both additive and interactive models, the research uses
criminal history records and prior three-strike offenses to measure
sentence length of convicted felony offenders in Washington
State. Data on 19,403 convictions from July 1993 through June
1997 are collected from the State of Washington Sentencing
Guidelines Commission. Hispanics and blacks receive shorter
sentences than whites, whereas male and younger offenders re-
ceive longer sentences than females and older offenders. The in-
fluence of criminal history records and prior strikes on sentencing
decisions is indirectly associated with offense type (that is, per-
son, property, sex, and drug cases). Findings clearly demonstrate
the importance of capturing how legal variables effect the sen-
tencing process of those sentenced under persistent offender laws.
Directions for future research are suggested.

nia Counties: Effects of Size of County and Specialized Collec-

The effects of restitution are examined in several Pennsylvania
counties. Court, probation, and collection office records in four
Pennsylvania counties were chosen because they varied along
two dimensions: population size and the use of specialized units
for the collection of monetary sanctions. From each county, resti-
tution-eligible cases were sampled from both 1994 and 1996 to
test the effects of a 1995 statutory change mandating restitution.
Multivariate models indicated that restitution was significantly
more likely to be ordered for property crimes, offenses that were
more easily quantified, offenses against businesses, and offenses
committed after the statutory change. Moreover, restitution was
more likely to be imposed and a higher percentage was likely to
be paid in counties with smaller populations and in those in
which probation officers handled the collection of economic
sanctions than in counties in which they were handled by spe-
cialized collection units.
Schlesinger, T. 2005. “Racial and Ethnic Disparity in Pretrial
Criminal Processing.” Justice Quarterly 22: 170–192.
The criminal justice system has long been accused of operating
on the basis of extralegal factors, particularly factors related to
race and ethnicity. Numerous studies have examined those and
other extralegal factors as they relate to criminal processing. In-
conclusive evidence has been disclosed, although there have
been instances in which clear and convincing evidence of racial
and ethnic discrimination in offender processing has occurred.
Correcting such disparities rests both with judges and parole
boards. Various accountability mechanisms are suggested for
avoiding the appearance of disparities in processing attributable
to extralegal factors. Suggestions are made for holding judges
and paroles more accountable in their decision-making relating
to sentencing under a racially and ethnically neutral scenario.

long-term incarcerated offenders. Dynamic risk/need assess-
ment instruments are useful tools in the effective treatment and
management of offenders. The LSI-R is a dynamic risk/need as-
sessment instrument that has been used extensively among a va-
riety of offender samples. Although considerable research has
shown that the instrument is valid and reliable, there is a lack of
information on the predictive validity of the instrument among
longer-term offenders. In the current study, the LSI-R was com-
pleted by a sample of 129 Canadian federally incarcerated of-
fenders serving a mean sentence length of five years. Scores on
the LSI-R were compared with various recidivism criteria during
a 15-month follow-up period. Overall, the instrument had ac-
ceptable reliability and predictive validity and distinguished re-
cidivists from nonrecidivists. As such, the LSI-R can effectively
be applied to long-term offenders as well as showing promise as
an important risk/need assessment instrument among a variety
of offender samples. Given the technical quality of the LSI-R and
other similar dynamic risk/need assessment instruments, per-
haps the time has come to shift focus away from the production-
line pace of developing new risk assessment tools. Instead,
research energy might be better channeled toward issues that
have been largely ignored during the risk assessment technology
boom. Specifically, attention is lacking in quality assurance
strategies, links between assessment and rehabilitation, and the
unique factors among individuals that make them more or less
susceptible to clinical intervention.
Solomon, Amy L. 2006. “Does Parole Supervision Work? Re-
search Findings and Policy Opportunities.” APPA Perspectives
30: 26–37.
Parole supervision is examined insofar as it assists parolees to
make successful adjustments into their communities. Problems
of parolee re-entry are explored, and a focus is directed toward
prisons in which these inmates are supposed to receive training,
vocational and educational, as well as other services, including
individual and group counseling. Such preparole programming
is considered essential to making successful adjustments to com-
munity living on the outside. Inmates without such preparole ex-
periences present supervision problems for their parole officers,
who are frustrated in that they lack the means to assist offenders
in becoming successfully reintegrated. The issues and problems

of preparole institutional programming are examined and com-
pared with the services provided by paroling authorities and the
qualifications of officers expected to supervise large numbers of
untrained and unprepared clients.
Steen, Sara, and Mark A. Cohen. 2004. “Assessing the Public’s
Demand for Hate Crime Penalties.” Justice Quarterly 21: 91–124.
This work is an analysis of public attitudes toward punishment
for hate crimes, using telephone interview data from a nationally
representative sample of adults (N = 1,300). The most general
finding to emerge was that there is minimal public support for
harsher penalties for offenders who commit hate crimes than for
offenders who commit identical crimes with no specific motiva-
tion. The second important finding was that respondents’ con-
cerns about hate crimes depend on which minority groups are
targeted. Specifically, there appeared to be some support for
harsher penalties for hate crimes against Jewish victims. Finally,
while most respondents’ demographic characteristics did not
have an impact on sentencing decisions for either nonhate or hate
crimes, attitudes toward punishment, treatment, and minority
rights had a significant effect on those decisions.

This essay discusses America’s preoccupation with crime prob-
lems and policies such as the war on drugs, zero tolerance polic-
ing, and three-strikes-and-you’re-out policies. The U.S. criminal
justice system has lost its way, and political cynicism and fear
have replaced good intentions. The crime control policies that we
currently implement are fueled by short-term thinking and knee-
jerk reactions so as not to appear “soft on crime.” Attitudes to-
ward crime in the United States are cyclical and change with
problems and media presentations. Specific solutions are pro-
posed that can serve as a platform for criminal justice reform.

decisions. Criminal sentencing data for 1997 to 1999 were drawn
from the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing. Contextual
data were taken from the census, the U.S. Uniform Crime Reports,
and the 1999 County and City Extra. Cases were limited to the
most serious offense per judicial transaction and to those sen-
tenced under the 1997 guidelines. Most of the explanatory “action”
was at the individual case level in criminal sentencing. In addition,
evidence emerged of local contextual features—court organiza-
tional culture, court caseload pressure, and racial and ethnic com-
position—affecting sentencing outcomes, either directly or in
interaction with individual factors. Theoretical implications are
discussed, as are the dilemmas among civil rights, local autonomy,
and organizational realities of criminal courts.
Vogel, Brenda L. 2003. “Support for Life in Prison without the

This study compares death penalty supporters who favor the al-
ternative of life in prison without the possibility of parole (LWOP)
to death penalty supporters who oppose that option. Telephone
interviews are conducted with 556 adult residents of Orange
County, California. More than 45 percent of respondents in the
two groups viewed LWOP as a viable alternative to the imposi-
tion of capital punishment. Although findings reveal few statisti-
cally significant differences between the groups, those in the
higher-income brackets are more likely to oppose the LWOP al-
ternative. Developing a clearer picture of death penalty support-
ers willing to support the LWOP option will not only contribute
to death penalty opinion literature but may also better inform op-
ponents committed to the demise of capital punishment and
allow them to champion that cause more effectively.

Individual-level data were obtained from the State Court Process-

ing Statistics Program of the Bureau of Justice Statistics. None of
the four contextual (county-level) variables (the level of crime, un-
employment rate, racial composition, and region) increased the
likelihood of a prison sentence, but ten case-level factors, both
legal and extralegal, and several macro-micro interaction terms
were influential. Overall, these results demonstrate the impor-
tance of considering smaller geographic units (that is, counties in-
stead of states) and controlling for case-level factors in research on
interjurisdictional differences in prison use. Further research in
this area will, therefore, ultimately help pinpoint the (combina-
tion of) contextual characteristics possessed by jurisdictions with
relatively moderate punishment practices. An overarching goal of
future inquiry is to identify the key organizational contextual de-
terminants that keep punishment in check.
Williams, Jackson. 2003. “Criminal Justice Policy Innovation in
the States.” Criminal Justice Policy Review 14: 401–422.
This study examines factors influencing states’ adoptions of four
criminal justice policy innovations: Truth-in-Sentencing laws
(TIS); three-strikes-and-you’re-out laws; boot camps for convicted
offenders; and juvenile court transfer provisions. The data contain
forty-eight cases for forty-eight states (excluding Hawaii and
Alaska) and consist of cross-sectional observations of whether a
state had adopted TIS by 1997, instituted a three-strikes law by
1997, instituted a boot camp program by 1995, and enacted or
toughened a juvenile transfer program provision between 1992
and 1995. States’ crime rates are positively correlated with adop-
tion of the measures, but other objective state factors, such as sen-
tence length, are not. Strained state resources do not deter
legislatures from enacting these policies, and voter ideology and
political culture have less than expected impact. It appears that
criminal justice policy innovations, at least those of the crime con-
trol variety, are most highly responsive to the problem environ-
ment only at the general level of public consciousness and not
responsive to more specific formulations of policy problems.
Specifically, political entrepreneurs, rather than state characteris-
tics, are responsible for the adoption.

Paul Newman stars as the son of a former crime boss who is now
engaged in a legitimate liquor wholesaling business. He becomes
involved in an investigation of another crime figure inadver-
tently, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office and various assistant U.S.
attorneys attempt to cajole him into giving them incriminating
information about those targeted for investigation. Sally Field
plays a reporter who secures Newman’s confidence and learns
things that she reports in her newspaper. The information causes
one of Newman’s close friends to commit suicide. The film is an
excellent depiction of prosecutorial misconduct and how the
legal system can be easily manipulated to bring about desired
ends, often to the detriment of innocent persons and their
friends. The title of this film refers to printing unsubstantiated
rumors about what may or may not be true, and such informa-
tion is disseminated in the press without malice.

81) refer to the years in which they were devised.
seamless parole, seamless probation
To provide continuity of care for
inmates while they are confined, and to continue this care and treatment

parole programs are often used with drug-dependent offenders. The pro-
gram oversees and coordinates all interrelated state and private programs
involved in substance abuse treatment for offenders, both inside and out-
side of prison. Case management and drug and alcohol testing are used,
and the program ranges over 6 to 9 months inside prison, depending on

ment and various states to assist judges in assessing fair and consistent
Glossary
259

lengths of incarceration for various crimes and past criminal histories.
Use of these guidelines is referred to as “presumptive sentencing” in
some jurisdictions.
sentencing hearing
An optional hearing held in many jurisdictions in
which defendants and victims can hear the contents of presentence in-
vestigation reports prepared by probation officers. Defendants and vic-
tims may respond to a report orally, in writing, or both. The hearing
precedes the sentence imposed by the judge.
sentencing memorandum
A court decision that furnishes a ruling or
finding and orders it to be implemented relative to convicted offenders.
This document does not necessarily include reasons or a rationale for the
sentence imposed.
Sentencing Project, The
An organization headquartered in Washing-
ton, D.C., that promotes the development of sentencing alternatives. It

fendant undergoes a period of community treatment. If treatment is suc-
cessful, the jail or prison sentence is terminated.
truth in sentencing, truth-in-sentencing laws
Close correspondence
between the sentence imposed and the sentence actually served; federal
policy and admonition advocated in the Crime Bill of 1994.
unconditional diversion (standard diversion) program
A diversion
program requiring minimal or no contact with a probation department.
It may include a minimum maintenance fee paid regularly for a speci-
fied period, such as one year. No treatment program is indicated.
unconditional release
The final release of an offender from the juris-
diction of a correctional agency; also, a final release from the jurisdiction
of a court.
260
Glossary

United States Sentencing Guidelines
Implemented by federal courts
in November 1987, these guidelines obligated federal judges to impose
presumptive sentences on all convicted offenders. The guidelines are
based on offense seriousness and offender characteristics. Judges may
depart from the guidelines only by justifying their departures in writing.
victim-impact statement
Information or a version of events filed vol-
untarily by the victim of a crime, appended to the presentence investi-
gation report as a supplement for judicial consideration in sentencing
the offender. It describes injuries to victims resulting from the convicted
offender’s actions.
victim/offender mediation
A meeting between a criminal and a person
suffering loss or injury from that criminal whereby a third-party arbiter,
such as a judge, attorney, or other neutral party, decides what is best for
all parties. All parties must agree to the decision of the third-party arbiter.
The technique is used for both juvenile and adult offenders.
Victim/Offender Reconciliation Project (VORP)
A form of alternative
dispute resolution, whereby a civil resolution is made by mutual consent
between the victim and an offender. Objectives are to provide restitution
to victims, hold offenders accountable for the crime committed, and re-
duce recidivism.
