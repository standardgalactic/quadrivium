Break Statement
●
The break statement which was borrowed from C, breaks out of the innermost enclosing 
for or while loop;
●
If break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), break will terminate 
the innermost loop;
●
The else clause of the for loop is executed when the loop is not terminated by a break 
statement
