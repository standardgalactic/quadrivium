Dedication
This book is dedicated to my leadership team at Sostre & Associates, Lisa
Ramos and Chris Rivera. If it hadn’t been for the willingness of this dynamic
duo to take on new levels of responsibility for the day-to-day operations of
the firm, I would not have been able to dedicate myself to writing this book.
— Pedro Sostre
I would like to dedicate this book to the ECT News Network’s publisher, Ric
Kern, and his hard-working editorial staff. These devoted tech news special-
ists offered me tremendous support through the long process of dissecting
Web analytics.
— Jennifer LeClaire
Authors’ Acknowledgments
Between the two of us, we’ve written plenty of articles, designed plenty of
Web sites, and analyzed plenty of stats, but writing a book that applies those
skills and that knowledge is an entirely different story. Blair Pottenger is the
project editor of this book and deserves a hearty round of applause for his
careful reading, incisive comments, and patience. Blair is a pro who shows no
signs of cracking even under deadline pressure. Whatever you throw his way,
he catches it and runs with it. Thanks, Blair!
We tried to make Teresa Artman’s copy editing job easy, but we appreciate
her keen eye. She made us look good by ridding our pages of unclear techie
stuff and a few typos along the way. With an entire new language called Web
analytics to learn over a few short months, we’re convinced Teresa could
copy edit books in any tongue.
Many thanks to Steve Hayes for launching this project and cultivating its first
seeds. Steve held our hands through the beginning stages of developing the
outline and sample chapter. His advice and experience in the publishing
arena made this project an experience to remember (a good one!).
As for Paul Chaney, the technical editor, he had an unusually difficult job with
this book because of the myriad of analytical concepts within its pages. His
insights were invaluable.
Every single pair of eyes and hands who played a role in bringing this book to
fruition should be congratulated. This is an important topic for online busi-
nesses large and small and the editorial team deserves a place in the Web
analytics hall of fame for deciding to make this complex topic understandable
to even Web analytics newbies.

Introduction
W
hat would you pay for a book that could help you tap into the mind-
sets of your Web site visitors, show you where you’re missing golden
sales opportunities, and save you big bucks on online advertising initiatives?
How about less than $30? (It’s quite the bargain for a wealth of knowledge,
isn’t it?)
Web Analytics For Dummies is the book you’ve been waiting for. See, Web ana-
lytics tools are essential, vital, and even critical for anyone who wants to
improve his success on the World Wide Web. In fact, from entrepreneurs to
mega corporations, the need for Web analytics has never been stronger. The
truth is, what you don’t know about your Web site could be hurting your
business.
Web Analytics For Dummies is an introduction to the wonderful world of Web
site statistics. The book will help you understand and unleash the power of
Web analytics. It will take you on a journey with a colorful map that shows
you the sign posts ahead as well as the right and left turns to lead you to
greater profitability. Indeed, by the time you’re done reading this book, no
one will be able to call you a dummy anymore. You’ll have confidence in your
abilities to use these practical techniques that get results.
About This Book
This book takes the mystery out of Web metrics. You find out what you need
to do to get the inside scoop on visitor behavior, measure your Web site’s
performance against your business goals, and make adjustments to help you
meet those objectives.
In this book, we show you how to
 Understand the language of Web analytics.
 Choose the right Web analytics software for your business.
 Get the nitty-gritty on what your visitors are doing on your Web site.
 Calculate your conversion rate and set goals for your Web site.
 Identify your most popular — and most profitable — pages.

 Get the lowdown on where your traffic is coming from and discover
which site referrers you want to get cozier with.
 Fine-tune your Web site and reduce shopping cart abandonment.
 Avoid common data interpretation mistakes and implement proven best
practices.
And plenty more!
Foolish Assumptions
You know what they say about people who make assumptions, but because
you bought this book, we have to presume a few things about your present
circumstances — things such as
 You own a Web site, are planning very soon to build a Web site, or are in
the business of helping other people improve their Web sites.
 You know how to use a Web browser.
 You know how to do some simple math: for example, calculating a 
percentage.
Of course, if you bought a book like this, we have to figure you know a little
more than the basics about how to manage a Web site — or that you have
access to someone who does. Because this book deals with statistics galore
and how to use those stats to improve your site, we have to assume that you
can take action on what you glean from this book. Specifically, you’ll proba-
bly need to know how to
 Do vendor research (compare and contrast).
 Download and install software.
 Fix any Web site errors that your Web analytics software identifies.
 Make changes to your Web site. The Holy Grail of Web analytics is not
merely accessing and interpreting the data but also using what you dis-
cover to optimize your Web site and your Internet marketing campaigns.
We don’t get into coding in this book. This isn’t a primer on fixing errors or
using HTML to make changes to your site. In order to get the most out of this
book, however, you or someone you know needs to have some basic HTML
skills so you can fine-tune your Web site. That may mean moving a picture
from the top to the bottom of the screen or adding new content to certain
pages. If you need more information about HTML, pick up a copy of HTML 4
For Dummies, 4th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Natanya Pitts (Wiley).

Web Analytics For Dummies 

How This Book Is Organized
This book isn’t anything like the boring reference books you relied on for
your high school term papers, but it is organized like a reference book. In
other words, you can start at any chapter and get the information that you
need on the spot. You don’t necessarily have to read the chapters in order
like you would a mystery novel.
This book is divided into several parts: the basics, choosing the tools you need
to succeed, tips on searching for statistical treasure, how to make good with the
knowledge you’ve acquired, and the Part of Tens. If you want to understand the
differences between client-side, server-side, and hosted solutions, read Chapter
4. If you need some insight into key performance indicators (KPIs) — metrics
that illustrate how well your site is performing against goals — read Chapter 11.
If all you need is some quick info on how to determine who is sending traffic
to your site, go right to Chapter 9. You get the idea.
With all that said, Web analytics is a complex topic, and each chapter sort of
builds on the other as you strive to erect your Web-based empire. Yes, you
can skip ahead to Chapter 5 and start the process of comparing and contrast-
ing Web analytics vendors. If you don’t know the difference between the
basic tool types, though, you might choose the wrong software. You can start
with Chapter 3 and take a sneak peek at the data, but if you don’t speak the
language of analytics, you might not have a clue what you’re really looking at.
We recommend that you take the time to read the entire book from cover to
cover, and then use it as an ongoing reference guide as needed. We believe
that you’ll better understand how to set benchmarks, interpret the data prop-
erly, and use the right data to guide you down the path of Web optimization.
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics
In this part, we give you the keys you need to start the Web analytics engine
and keep it humming. Like a foreman setting out to build a skyscraper, this
part of the book lays a strong foundation that will support your efforts as
your Web site grows. Why is Web analytics important to your business? And
for that matter, what is Web analytics? What’s the difference between a hit, a
pageview, and a unique visitor? In this part, you’ll find out the basics of Web
analytics: how it can benefit you, how to speak the language, and how to
access your data and start recording some simple KPIs.

Introduction

Part II: Choosing the Right Web 
Analytics Solution
It’s been said there’s more than one way to skin a cat. (Gruesome thought,
isn’t it?) Well, there’s also more than one way to capture Web analytics. In
fact, as you’ll discover in this part, there are three ways to be exact. Each has
its pros and cons — and all three together offer synergies that no individual
tool offers alone. That’s why you need to know the difference between client-
side, server-side, and hosted solutions.
But that’s not all you need to know as you assess tool types. There are
dozens, even scores, of Web analytics vendors on the market. Some offer free
tools. Others offer low-cost tools. And still others charge a small fortune for
their ability to tell you just about anything you could ever possibly want to
know about your visitors. You’ll find even niche solutions that measure RSS
feeds and let you eavesdrop, so to speak, on visitor navigation — live.
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure
After you settle on a Web analytics tool that suits your specific needs, you
can start searching for statistical treasure. First, though, you have to take out
the trash: that is, the data generated from non-human users, referrer spam,
and other data that block the view of your gold mine. In this part, you’ll dis-
cover a dizzying array of KPIs. We’ll help you figure out which ones matter
most to you. We’ll also roll into the real world of shopping cart abandonment
— the four-letter word of e-commerce — and talk about conversion funnels.
(Don’t worry, you’ll understand all this and more as you read Part III.)
And your treasure hunt doesn’t end there. We also show you how to explore
search engine and non-search engine traffic as you identify who you can
thank for sending visitors your way. Then you’ll see how to analyze your data
so you can get better acquainted with your visitors and the pages they love
to return to again and again.
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — 
Making Analytics Work for You
If knowledge is power, Web analytics offers the thrust of a jet engine, taking
you soaring above the clouds so you can see your site from 10,000 feet. Then
it swoops down and lets you land on individual pages to see exactly what’s
happening on ground level. In this part, you’ll read how to make Web analytics
4
Web Analytics For Dummies 

work for you. It all starts with chronicling your Web analytics history. You
don’t need to be a historian to appreciate this data. In fact, you might be sur-
prised by some of the keyphrases that drive traffic — and it could open the
door to a whole new set of customers and partners. Or, you might discover
that it’s time to revisit your online advertising strategy. We give you actionable
information to help you decide. Finally, we demonstrate some practical ways
to fine-tune your Web site by using your data to guide page, section, and site
redesigns that help reduce shopping cart abandonment. What more could a
Web site owner dream of?
Part V: The Part of Tens
All For Dummies books have The Part of Tens. In this part, you’ll find ten
myths, mistakes, and pitfalls that you want to avoid at all costs. You’ll also
discover a list of reasons why Web analytics will revolutionize e-business.
Finally, we leave you with some Web analytics best practices that will help
you avoid those myths, mistakes, and pitfalls in the first place. The rest is up
to you.
Appendix
Don’t forget to check out the Appendix, where you’ll find a Web analytics
glossary that will serve you well regardless of which vendor you choose.
Icons Used in This Book
Like all For Dummies books, this book uses icons to highlight certain para-
graphs and to alert you to especially useful information. Here’s the lowdown
on what those icons mean:
A Tip icon means that we’re giving you a valuable tidbit of information that
can help you on your journey or provide some extra insight into the concepts
being discussed.
When you see the Remember icon, take note. These mean that we’re offering
information that’s worth remembering.
5
Introduction

The Technical Stuff icon alerts you that you are about to enter the Geek Zone.
If you’d rather not venture into that realm, simply skip it. If you want to know
the every last detail, though, you’ll love these sections.
The Warning icon does just that — it warns you. This icon helps you avoid
common mistakes, misconceptions, myths, and pitfalls. The bomb symbol
sort of gets your attention, doesn’t it? Be sure to look for it so you don’t do
more harm than good as you wade through the world of Web analytics.

Web Analytics For Dummies 

Part I
Getting Started
with Web
Analytics

In this part . . .
T
he basics of Web analytics are, well, anything but basic.
Learning the ins and outs of Web analytics software
may not be as daunting as understanding complex com-
puter programming languages — but it’s not as easy as
firing off a document in Microsoft Word, either. The Web
analytics guru is one part statistician, one part psycho-
logist, and one part prophet. The good news is you can
glean valuable insights without being any one of the three.
This part starts with the basics. We begin by explaining
what Web analytics is, who should use it, and why you
can’t afford not to use this seemingly all-knowing software
in today’s competitive online environment. Whether you
are a small but growing e-commerce vendor, a successful
and growing affiliate marketer, a professional online lead
generator, a media/content portal, blogger — or anyone
else with any other type of Web site we didn’t mention —
you’ll be fascinated to learn what Web analytics software
reveals about your visitors.
The only catch is you’ll have to learn a new language —
the language of Web analytics. That’s why we spell out the
ABCs of analytics in clear terms you can understand. You’ll
discover the difference between hits, pageviews, and
unique visitors. You’ll learn to decipher commonly used
acronyms like CRT, KPI, and PPC. You’ll even get familiar
with some Internet marketing lingo. There is no industry
standard terminology, so interpreting Web analytics can
be confusing even when you think you speak the language
fluently. But don’t worry, we’ve got you covered.
This part of the book also gives you an opportunity to get
your hands dirty with Web data. We’ll show you how to
find your stats, tell you what to do if your Web host 
doesn’t provide them, and walk you through some of the
basics of analyzing your visitor behavior. Finally, we’ll
help you set some goals to keep in mind as you begin to
enter the world of Web analytics.

Chapter 1
Understanding Web Analytics
In This Chapter
 Appreciating the value of Web metrics
 Taking a behind-the-scenes look at your Web site
 Keeping up with the Joneses
 Investing your time and money wisely
A
long time ago, in a World Wide Web far, far away, Web counters — those
rudimentary software programs that indicate the number of online 
visitors — were the only way to tally how many eyeballs viewed your Web
site. You knew nothing about where those visitors came from, what brought
them there, what they did while they were there, or when they left. You could
experience the thrill of watching the Web counter jump from 100 to 1,000 in
January but then drive yourself crazy trying to repeat the performance in
February.
Today, even free Web analytics tools — software that analyzes the behavior of
site visitors — offer the nitty-gritty details about what, when, from where,
and why visitors come to your site. And top-dollar solutions, with their ultra-
sophisticated technologies, are getting so detailed that you may soon know
what your visitor ate for breakfast. (Okay, not really, but an online grocer
could at least collect data about what visitors like to eat by analyzing their
clickstreams, the recorded paths that a visitor takes through your Web site.)
So as far as the Web goes, George Orwell’s prophecies are true: Big Brother is
indeed watching.
The overarching goal of monitoring your Web analytics is to make improve-
ments to both your promotional initiatives and your Web site design. If you
know how visitors find your site and then how they subsequently use your
site, you can take measured steps to make the most of your promotional cam-
paigns and your visual presentation. The bottom line is this: The easier it is
for visitors to find your site — and the more comfortable they feel while they
cruise around it — the better your chances to convert that traffic into paying
customers and repeat visitors.

10
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
This chapter gives you an overview of Web analytics, what these tools mea-
sure, who should use them, why they are valuable in your quest to generate
revenue, and what you could be losing by not paying attention to the wealth
of visitor data that this software compiles.
Web Analytics: Why Bother?
Maybe you need a little more convincing. After all, there is an admitted learning
curve with Web analytics programs, and you’re already undoubtedly busy
enough just keeping your site updated, much less dissecting statistics, charts,
and graphs. Why bother, you ask? The answer is clear: Understanding Web ana-
lytics can unlock business strategies that pay dividends even while you sleep.
There are already millions and millions of Web sites, and that number grows
day by day. An August 2006 Netcraft survey reveals more than 92 million Web
sites are up. Netcraft is an Internet services company that provides security
services and research data and analysis. That’s 4 million Web sites more than
in July and 8 million more than in June. It’s more than likely that thousands —
or even hundreds of thousands — of Web sites are competing for the same
traffic you are. Web analytics can help you build strategies that make you
stand out from the pack.
Who should use Web analytics?
Anyone who hopes to use the World Wide Web to generate income or leads
should use Web analytics. Major e-commerce brands use Web analytics data
to make real-time changes to their sites. Affiliate marketers use analytics to
discern what programs are paying off as well as which ones merely take up
space. Online lead generators tap Web analytics to measure how keywords
are working, and information portals depend on these metrics to offer traffic
figures to their advertisers.
Consider the following questions to determine whether you should invest in
Web analytics software:
 Is my Web site a channel for revenue generation?
 Do I have high traffic counts but low conversions?
 Am I investing in paid-search campaigns through Google, Yahoo!, or
some other search engine?
 Am I actively pursuing link building campaigns and link exchanges?
 Do I engage in e-mail marketing?
 Am I planning a site redesign?

If you answered “yes” to any one of the preceding questions, you should
begin to use Web analytics today. The truth is that your competition is
already using Web analytics. You could be missing golden opportunities to
turn the traffic you’ve worked so hard to generate into sales, subscribers, or
members.
You can’t afford not to invest in this software. Neglecting Web analytics in
today’s information-based society is akin to working in a retail store wearing
a blindfold and earplugs. You might make some sales just because the doors
are open, but you won’t know who your customers are, where they came
from, or how long they stayed — you get the picture.
11
Chapter 1: Understanding Web Analytics
Browser blues?
When you look at the Browser section of your
Web analytics report (as shown in the figure),
you might be surprised to see how many
browser brands there really are. Most people
use Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla
Firefox, but many others are available, including
Safari, Opera, and Netscape. What you need to
know is that your Web analytics report lists
these browsers, in part, so you can make sure
your site design is optimized for the most
common browser. Sometimes a Web site looks
much different on an Apple browser than it does
on an open source browser or a Microsoft
browser. In fact, the site can look skewed and
jumbled on some browsers. Make sure that
your designer tests the site on the most popular
browsers so you can make the best possible
impression.
You can read more about the browser section
of your report in Chapter 9.

Why you should use Web analytics
Here is a list of the top ten compelling reasons to use Web analytics:
1. You can identify which site referrers generate the most traffic and rev-
enue. The site referrer, or referring page, is the URL of the previous Web
page from which a link was followed. This is a good way to identify which
Web site owners you should foster relationships with, and which ones
you can afford to forget about. See Figure 1-1 to see how your Referrer
report looks in the free server-side analytics application AWStats.
2. You can determine what products have the highest browse-to-buy ratios.
That way, you can get rid of products — or content, in the case of an infor-
mational portal — that has the lowest revenue-generating potential.
3. See which campaigns work — and which ones don’t. You can cut off
promotional campaigns that aren’t working and beef up campaigns that
bear fruit.
4. You can measure the impact of the online channel on your overall
business. If your e-commerce Web site is generating more revenues than
your bricks-and-mortar business, then it may be time to close up shop
and concentrate all your efforts on the Web. If your Web site is generat-

report from

12
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

ing more leads than other forms of advertising, then you may want to
sink more into the former and less into the latter. By contrast, if your
Web site is not making much of an impact on your business, then you
need to consider some strategies to boost traffic or convert the traffic
you already have. It could be poor design, poor content, or just poor
marketing efforts. Your Web analytics program can give you some clues.
5. You can discover which visitor groups are most likely to become cus-
tomers, subscribers, or members. Then you can adjust your marketing
efforts accordingly.
6. You can analyze your visitor clickstreams. From this information, you
can make changes to your site hierarchy (how you arrange your Web
site) to improve your rate of conversion. Conversion occurs when you
close the deal — when you convert a visitor to a buyer, subscriber, or
member.
7. You can identify cross-selling opportunities. Use this information to
increase sales to the same customer by introducing other similar or
complementary products. Amazon has championed this concept in the
online space as it uses massive stores of analytics data to identify and
recommend related products, as shown in Figure 1-2.
Figure 1-2:

ommends

Chapter 1: Understanding Web Analytics

8. You can determine the effect of adding new content to the site. If the
new content you added causes visitors to stay on your site longer
and/or increases your conversion rates, then your wordsmithing is to be
congratulated. If the new content has the opposite effect, revert back to
what you were doing — quick!
9. Track the keywords that visitors search for within your site. Then you
can develop new product lines, services, or content based on those key-
words.
10. Find errors in your site. With this information in hand, you can eradi-
cate errors that could frustrate customers, such as broken links and
pages that no longer exist.
Of course, there are many other benefits to keeping tabs on customer behav-
ior, and in the end, careful attention to your analytics, and actions based on
that data will result in converting more visitors into customers, subscribers,
or members. When the right analytics tools are in place, you will have new
information to work with daily, or even in real-time depending on how sophis-
ticated your Web analytics software is.
The importance of benchmarking
You won’t know how far you’ve come if you don’t record where you were —
benchmarking — and compare that with where you are now. Before you invest
your time, energy, and money into generating more traffic, be sure to set spe-
cific goals based on the available metrics. For example, if you want to
 Generate more international traffic: Record how many countries you
reach.
 Boost your weekend traffic: Record the average daily visitors before
you begin.
 Beef up your newsletter subscriptions: Tally your current sub-
scribers now.
Benchmarking your starting point allows you to measure your specific goals.
For more on benchmarking, see Chapter 15.
Web Analytics 101
Web analytics isn’t about gathering data for the sake of gathering data any more
than a police detective collects clues for the sake of collecting clues. In both
cases, the goal is to solve a mystery. Instead of detailing criminal activities at
the scene of a crime, Web analytics details visitor activities on a Web site.
14
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

There are two sides to your Web analytics story; the software and the human
element:
 Web analytics software collects data on Web site users’ behavior.
 The human element involves sifting through data about a visitor’s
online experience to determine which site changes could improve that
experience.
Maybe you’ve stumbled upon your Web analytics tools by accident and
couldn’t make heads or tails of the charts, graphs, lists, and icons. Or maybe
you never even knew about a way to go behind the scenes and examine a visi-
tor’s pathway through your site.
Either way, if you aren’t sure what to measure or how to start thinking about
Web metrics, you can’t benefit from the valuable clues that they provide.
Taking a moment to review the basic language of Web analytics software can
put you on a path to knowledge that leads to power.
Thinking like a journalist
You’ve probably heard the journalist’s rule to tell the reader who, what,
when, where, and why. That’s just what Web analytics does at its most funda-
mental level. The following sections outline the basics of what you can expect
to glean from your Web analytics software.
Who
The Who category gives you the inside scoop. First, you can see what coun-
tries visitors came from. This is where you see the world in the World Wide
Web. You might be surprised to discover that your visitors live in such far
away places as Singapore, Algeria, or Switzerland. This category might also
reveal the Internet service provider (ISP) of the visitor as well as whether the
visit is from an authenticated user or a search engine spider.
 Authenticated users are users who were required to log in, such as sub-
scribers or members.
 Also known as Web crawlers, robots, or bots, a search engine spider is an
automated script or program that browses the Web. Search engines use
spiders to gather up-to-date data as they index the Web.
Benefit: Knowing who your visitors are can help you cater to their specific
needs. If most of your users are members or subscribers, you can do member
polling and make changes to your product, service, or content offerings
accordingly. If most of your users are from Japan, you may consider translating
your site into Japanese or making design changes that appeal to their cultural
preferences. If most of your visitors are search engine spiders, you’ve got
major issues! You need to launch some online and perhaps offline promotional
15
Chapter 1: Understanding Web Analytics

campaigns to get the word out. You can get some ideas of the different types of
online strategies you could employ, along with tips on how to measure their
effectiveness, in Chapter 16.
What
The What category tells you what the visitor did during his time on your site.
You can discover how long the visitor stayed, what types of files he viewed
(images, static pages, JavaScript files, and so on), what specific URLs were
visited, and which operating systems and browsers were used to navigate
your site.
Benefit: Knowing what the visitor did on your site can help you understand
what his interests are. If a high percentage of your visitors spent most of their
time on a handful of pages, then you can quickly discern what their interests
are and add more of the same to your site. If most of your visitors are down-
loading one white paper over all the others you’ve posted or reading certain
articles more than others, you can safely assume that you’ve struck content
gold. If your visitors are spending lots of time on your FAQ pages, you might
conclude that they are confused and need better online customer support.
The point is to pay attention to what visitors did on your site to look for
trends — positive or negative — and make any necessary adjustments to
your site.
When
The When category tells you just that — when visitors traveled across your
virtual domain. You can see this data broken down by the number of unique
visitors, how many visits as well as how many pages and how many hits were
tracked each month, each day of the month, and each hour of the day (see
Figure 1-3). You can also break this data down to determine which days of the
week and which times of day see the most traffic.
Figure 1-3:
Visitor
report
broken
down by
time of day.
16
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

Benefit: Knowing when your visitors enter your site can help you track the
effectiveness of special promotions or seasonal sales.
Where
The Where category tells you where the visitor came from. These are as site
referrers. Referrers could be search engines, Web ring partners, link partners,
affiliate marketers, or a host of others. You can read more about site referrers
in Chapter 9.
Benefit: Knowing where your visitor came from helps you strategize link part-
ner and paid-search campaigns. You can also learn more about your visitors
by seeing what types of sites they frequent.
17
Chapter 1: Understanding Web Analytics
What’s up with error codes?
If you’re alarmed at the number of HTTP
(HyperText Transfer Protocol) error codes you
find in your Web analytics report (shown in the
figure), don’t be. Common HTTP error codes
include
 Document Not Found: This error occurs
if the file that a visitor is trying to access has
been moved or deleted.
 Too many users: This error usually
means too many visitors were trying to
access your site at the same time or that
you have run out of bandwidth, in either
case, you should speak with your Web host-
ing company to determine what you can do
to remedy these errors.
 Internal server error: This error
requires a little more investigation; it could
be caused by any number of reasons.
Although this metric is not included in your
other charts and does not skew your over-
all numbers, you need to identify and cor-
rect these errors because you could be
frustrating visitors, losing sales opportuni-
ties, or both.
You can read more about identifying and cor-
recting error codes in Chapter 10.

Why
The Why category tells what drew them to your site. That could include site
referrers (such as search engines) or keywords and keyphrases that visitors
used to find you in those search engines.
Benefit: Knowing why the visitor came — and what she was looking for —
gives you the knowledge you need to make adjustments to your products,
services, and content.
As you put on your journalist’s cap, be sure to do what any good journalist
would do on a breaking news story: Take notes. Although your Web analytics
software will chronicle and store your site’s data, you’ll want a quick refer-
ence of the top visitors, keywords, and site referrers at the tip of your fingers
so you can compare them with a glance to identify trends.
The language of Web analytics
As you venture into the world of Web analytics, you’ll quickly notice that it has
a language of its own. You might even feel as if you’ve been submersed in a for-
eign culture without a translator as you begin to hear words like hits, traffic,
and sessions that have totally different meanings online than they do offline.
Like any new language, the best way to become fluent is to begin with the
fundamentals. In Web analytics, those fundamentals — or core metrics — are
found in the five Ws in the journalist’s toolbox. Specifically, the heart of Web
analytics is captured in the following terms:
 Hits
 Pageviews
 Visits
 Unique visitors
 Referrers
 Keywords and keyphrases
Take a look at each one of these terms and what they mean in the big picture.
For more on the language and terminology of Web analytics, be sure to check
out the Appendix at the end of this book.
Hits
People love to boast about this metric. A hit, or impression, is created when
your Web server delivers a file to a visitor’s browser. PDF, sound files, Word
documents, and images are a few examples of files that generate hits. A
18
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

request for a page with five images would count as six hits: one hit for the
page itself plus one hit for each of the five images. This has been a popular
metric with sites hoping to score advertising, but it can be deceiving. See
Chapter 2 for an in-depth look at common terminology confusion.
Pageviews
A pageview is recorded each time a visitor views a Web page on your site. This
metric reveals how well your site captured the interest of your visitor. Simple
analytics programs divide the number of visitors by the number of pageviews
to determine the average number of pages each visitor viewed. If that number
is low, you might need to rethink your content, design, or hierarchy.
Visits
Sometimes called a session or user session, a visit describes the activity of an
individual user on your site. You could also say that a visit is a series of views
by the same visitor. It’s interesting to note that most analytics tools will end
the session if the visitor remains idle for 30 minutes although that time limit
can often be adjusted in your software’s options.
Unique visitors
The unique visitors metric represents the number of individual people who
visit your Web site. Each individual is counted only once, so if a person visits
your site five times in the reporting period, that behavior might count as five
sessions but only as one unique visitor. Most analytics programs track
unique visitors by their IP address, which is the unique string of numbers that
identifies a computer or server on the Internet.
Some users are assigned dynamic IP addresses from the ISP. That means that
their IP address changes daily, or sometimes even every few hours or min-
utes. These types of users might skew your number of unique visitors
slightly.
Site referrers
The site referrer, or referring page, is the URL of the previous Web page from
which a link was followed. A referrer could be a search engine, a blog, a
banner ad, an e-mail, an affiliate marketer, a Web ring, a link partner, or some
other Web site. Your Web analytics program will record the exact URL of the
site that referred traffic so you that can measure the success of your various
traffic-building initiatives.
Keywords and keyphrases
Keywords and keyphrases are appropriately named because they hold the key
to potentially significant traffic. People use these words to search for prod-
ucts, services, and information on the Web. You can pay search engines to
display your advertisement in the results of a user’s search based on the 
19
Chapter 1: Understanding Web Analytics

keywords and keyphrases you choose. If you are selling helium balloons, for
example, you might pay Google to display a link to your Web site when
searchers enters the keyphrase helium balloons into that engine.
Don’t wait until the end of the month to view your Web analytics report. You
could be losing valuable opportunities to convert customers — and you could be
wasting your paid-search ad dollars. By monitoring your Web analytics software
weekly — or even daily — you can reap the full potential of this intelligent tool.

The Bandwidth report
Your Web host probably has a limit to the
amount of bandwidth (the data that is trans-
ferred to and from your Web site) that you can
use in a given month. Web analytics tells you
precisely how many bytes (a unit of measure-
ment for data) your site is sending to and receiv-
ing from users. The bottom line is this: The more
traffic you get, the more bandwidth you need. If
you run out of bandwidth, your visitors might not
be able to view your Web site. Another metric
in the Bandwidth report (shown in the figure) is
bytes per second (bps). This measures the aver-
age transfer rate. If your transfer rate is set too
low by your hosting provider, your Web pages
might load very slowly — and your visitors
might get impatient and leave.
You can read more about the bandwidth report
in Chapter 3.

hen you apply for a driver’s license, the state requires you to pass a
written exam before you receive permission to hit the road. The
Powers That Be give you a thick study guide that defines every sign, symbol,
and flashing light on the highways and byways. The goal is to help you steer
clear of accidents so you can get where you want to go safely — even in
heavy rush hour traffic that can demand split-second decision making.
Just like a vehicle, your Web analytics software has a dashboard, of sorts,
that displays important information about your Web site. Instead of oil, tem-
perature, and gas, though, it offers information on visitors, length of stay, and
site referrers. The site referrer, or referring page, is the URL of the previous
Web page from which a link was followed.
Of course, most Web analytics control panels are far more complex than even
the highest-tech car dashboard. The more sophisticated the software, the
more difficult it is to navigate the charts, graphs, and other data that unlocks
the secrets to visitor behavior. If you don’t understand the terminology that
describes the various Web measurements, you could be in for a bumpy ride
as you make changes to your site based on misunderstandings of what the
data really means — as well as what it doesn’t mean.
Indeed, you have a lot to master about graphs, charts, symbols, and terminol-
ogy as you venture into the world of Web analytics. You won’t find this stuff

of this chapter as your study guide that defines common signs, symbols, and
flashing lights on the road to successful Web analytics interpretation. With
definitions, synonyms, acronyms, and the like, you can be sure to choose the
right tools and use them well.
For more definitions and descriptions of the language and terminology of
Web analytics, be sure to check out the Appendix at the end of this book.
Hitting the Terminology Targets
In Chapter 1, we outline some of the most common Web analytics terms, such
as hits, pageviews, visits, and site referrers. Those are the fundamentals of Web
metrics, as shown in Figure 2-1, but understanding these terms will hardly
make you fluent in the language of analytics. In fact, without a thorough
understanding of Web analytics vocabulary, you could be throwing your dart
at the wrong board.
Have you ever heard anyone brag about how many hits his Web site gets? A hit,
or impression, is created when your Web server delivers a file to a visitor’s
browser. Advertising-supported sites, such as online magazines, boast the
loudest and longest about this metric, but using this as a target is deceptive at
best. As for pageviews (a record of each time a visitor views a Web page on
your site), well, this metric at least hits the target. However, if you want your
measurement dart to hit the bulls-eye, you need to zero in on unique visitors,
which is the actual number of individual users who came to the Web site.

Chapter 2: Steering Clear of Common Terminology Confusion
Hits: The most deceptive stat of all
Hits are the most deceptive stat of them all, and here’s why. Each page on
your Web site includes photographs, text, graphics, sound files, PDFs, or
some other file type. Thus, a request for a page with five images counts as six
hits: one hit for the page itself plus one hit for each of the images. Thirty-
thousand visitors could easily rack up a million hits in a hurry on a catalog-
style site that serves up 30 or 40 photos per page.
If you are trying to impress advertisers with big online “circulation” numbers,
you would be tempted to let them know your hits. Be careful, though, to not
deceive yourself in the process. Breaking the million-hit barrier is something
to celebrate, but the inflated figures could cause you to rest on your laurels
while your competition continues to launch initiatives that bring more
unique visitors to their sites. More visitors mean more opportunities to make
a sale, woo a member, or generate a lead. From that perspective, hits ulti-
mately don’t mean much.
Measuring the success of your Web site based on hits is like putting cheap
gas in a luxury sports car: It could backfire. When you look at your Web ana-
lytics dashboard, shown in Figure 2-2, concentrate on the number of unique
visitors rather than the deceptive, inflated number of hits.
Searching for standards
Web analytics is a rare segment of the software
industry because no hard and fast industry
standards currently exist. That’s not surprising,
seeing as how it took several years for the
industry to even settle on a name for itself.
(Vendors toyed with monikers like e-metrics and
Web metrics before deciding on Web analytics.)
Surprisingly, debate is still ongoing as to what
should be measured as well as little agreement
on the best way to calculate the measurements
or even what to call them. Sure, you’ll find some
cross-over between Web analytics vendors, but
the lack of an industry standard has admittedly
caused terminology confusion. The good news
is several organizations are developing Web
analytics standards. Britain’s Audit Bureau of
Circulation (www.abc.org.uk), the Joint
Industry Committee for Web Standards
(www.jicwebs.org) and the Web Analytics
Association (www.webanalyticsasso-
ciation.org) are all working to set clear
definitions for this relatively young industry.

Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Pageviews: Getting closer to the truth
Pageviews can offer valuable information. A pageview reveals how well your
site captured the interest of your visitor. This metric becomes the foundation
for tracking a visitor’s clickstream (the recorded path, page by page, of the
pages a visitor requested while navigating through a Web site).
However, industry experts disagree about what constitutes a pageview and
how this metric should be interpreted and applied. The Interactive
Advertising Bureau (IAB; www.iab.net) defines a pageview as “when the
page is actually seen by the user.” In the next breath, it notes that pageviews
can only be estimated because you can’t discern whether the visitor actually
viewed the page or merely clicked through it. The IAB recommends measur-
ing page displays — when a page is successfully displayed on the visitor’s
computer screen.
Any way you define it, pageviews still get closer to the truth about a Web
site’s popularity. Pageviews clearly reveal the popularity of certain pages or
sections of the Web site. If a shoe retailer’s boot section receives the most
pageviews, it becomes obvious that either boots are coming back into style
Figure 2-2:

25
Chapter 2: Steering Clear of Common Terminology Confusion
or that the retailer’s site offers competitive prices, selection, and so on. That
allows the retailer to examine the market and tweak his offerings or advertis-
ing to leverage the popularity of those products.
You might sell vacuums, but don’t look at your pageviews in one. In other
words, put the pageview metrics in perspective. Dig a little deeper to dis-
cover why certain pages are drawing visitors. Find out what referrers are
sending traffic to those particular pages. A retailer might discover that he
needs to increase promotion efforts for certain landing pages — the specific
Web page where a visitor first arrives in response to a search or advertising
campaign. An information portal might find out that current events drive traf-
fic to special content sections and need a Subscribe Now button to convert
that traffic.
Unique visitors: The undisputable facts
As we state earlier, tracking hits can make it seem like you have 5, 10, or even
50 times as much traffic as you really drive. Pageviews are good for determin-
ing how popular your site content is after users find your site, but they still
aren’t an accurate representation of how many people visit your site. By con-
trast, unique visitors represent the undisputable facts.
The three faces of unique visitors
 Anonymous: Not all unique visitors are cre-
ated equal; some browse your Web site in
relative obscurity. Your Web analytics soft-
ware can tell you where they came from,
which pages they visited, and some other
standard metrics, but information related to
their location or network is hidden. These
anonymous visitors purposely hide behind
proxies (computers that allow multiple users
to surf the Internet using their IP address in
order to hide the users’ real IP address and
maintain privacy) that do the following:
 Cloak their IP address. An IP address is a
unique numeric code assigned by the user’s
Internet service provider (ISP).
and
 Disable cookies. Cookies are small text files
that allow a Web server to store information
about a visitor and recognize them when
they return.
 Partially anonymous: Other visitors are par-
tially anonymous. They might not be hiding,
but they aren’t volunteering any personal
information, either. If you don’t require them
to log in or give them an incentive to ante up
their personal data, they will remain in the
Web analytics shadows.
 Known: The “end all be all” are known vis-
itors. Known visitors can be segmented into
demographic segments. You can view their
shopping history, and you can target them
with special offers.

26
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Unique visitors are the purest measurement of Web site traffic because an
individual visitor — regardless of how many times he returns to your site
during a reporting period, how many pages he views, or how many images
are on a page — counts as an individual user.
Search engine spiders — programs or automated scripts that crawl the Web to
update search engine indexes — are not included when calculating unique
users, pageviews, or hits by the majority of analytics applications. However,
look out for smaller, less-advanced applications that don’t automatically
exclude this traffic.
With the right analytics tools, you can measure unique visitors during any
reporting period that suits you — by the day, week, or month. The unique vis-
itors metric is important because it clearly communicates the bottom line
about your traffic-generating efforts. You can understand, in no uncertain
terms, whether you wooed more visitors to your site in February than you
did in January, or if you attract more people during your Friday promotion
than you do on an average weekday. Understanding unique visitors is the
beginning of Web analytics wisdom.
The ABCs of Web Analytics
What is abandonment? Why is the average lifetime value important? What does
KPI stand for? With plenty of acronyms and words like dashboard that have dif-
ferent meanings in the online and offline worlds, making the most of your Web
analytics experience demands learning the ABCs of this tech terminology.
Some terms have synonyms, so one Web analytics user might call a 404 error a
Page Cannot be Found error, while another calls it a broken page. Some people
prefer the word crawler, while others insist on using the term spider.
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
What’s the meaning of this?
People who learn English often complain that
our language has too many different meanings
for the same words. In Web analytics, you’ll run
into your fair share of these. Abandonment, ses-
sion, and navigation are fairly self-explanatory,
but you’ll find synonyms galore. With no indus-
try standard Web analytics vocabulary, terms
used in Software X could mean something
much different than terms used in Software Y.
Take frequency, latency, and recency as exam-
ples. All three terms are used to reveal the
number of days since a visitor’s most recent visit
during a reporting period. As you choose your
software vendor — and as you begin to deci-
pher data — be sure that you’re speaking the
same language as your application.

Web analytics vocabulary is extensive and continues to evolve as Web metrics
analysts more clearly define their measurements and as technology advances
to offer deeper capabilities. However, if you take the time to review and under-
stand these common nouns, verbs, and adjectives you will be well on your
way to understanding and unleashing the power of Web analytics for your site.
Some terms, like abandonment or opt-in, describe what a visitor did on your
site. Abandonment means just what it says: The visitor left your site in the
midst of a transaction. Terms like bounce rate may stir images of how many
times a star basketball player dribbles before passing the rock to another
player. In the analytics arena, however, the bounce rate is a metric that shows
the percentage of entrances on any individual page that resulted in the visi-
tor’s immediate exit from the site. Take a look at Figure 2-3 to see how Google
Analytics displays bounce rates for your Top 5 entry pages.
Take a moment to review this list of the most common terms that describe
visitor behavior on a Web site.
 After-click tracking (ACT): Also called path analysis, clickstream, or navi-
gational analysis, this is simply a study of the paths that visitors take
through your site. This detailed assessment begins with the referring
page and ends with the exit page.
Figure 2-3:

28
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
 Clickthrough rate (CTR): Typically, this metric is used to calculate how
often a banner ad is clicked compared with how many times it is viewed,
and it helps indicate how effective a particular banner ad is. This metric
can also be used to indicate the rate at which visitors clickthrough from
one page on a Web site to another.
 Conversion: This is what it’s all about. Conversion occurs when you
close the deal — when you convert a visitor to a buyer, subscriber, or
member.
 Entry page: Sometimes called the landing page, the entry page is just
what it sounds like: the page at which the visitor entered your site. Your
Web analytics tools list the entry pages based how many visitors viewed
that page.
 Exit page: The exit page marks the point at which the navigational path
within the site ends. In other words, it’s where the customer exits the
site.
 Navigation: This describes clicking from one page to another within a
Web site, or sometimes from one Web site to another.
 Session: Also called a visit, a session is the time from when a visitor logs
on to your site to when he leaves. A site might receive 50,000 unique vis-
itors but have 65,000 sessions. That just means that the some users vis-
ited more than once.
 Visit duration: This is a record of how long an individual stayed on your
site. Sessions are measured in time, often in increments ranging from
0–30 seconds, 30 seconds–2 minutes, 2–5minutes, 5–15 minutes, 15–30
minutes, 30 minutes–1 hour, and 1 hour-plus. This log divides the
number of visits by number of minutes visitors spent on your site to
determine the average length of stay.
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Much ado about landing pages
You don’t have to wade through the world of
Web analytics long before you start hearing
about landing pages, which are specific Web
pages that a visitor reaches after clicking a link
from a search engine or an advertisement.
Landing pages are typically associated with
promotional campaigns. Instead of driving visi-
tors to your home page and relying on them to
navigate through the site to find the products
they are looking for, your basketball gear pro-
motion drives them to the exact page on the site
that had the latest and greatest basketball
equipment. Measuring the traffic to and behav-
ior on your landing pages is critical so that you
can make changes that lead to greater conver-
sions. An entire subindustry is forming around
landing page optimization, just as it did around
search engine optimization.

29
Chapter 2: Steering Clear of Common Terminology Confusion
Mastering Internet Marketing Lingo
Online advertising also has a language all its own. The Wiley book, Search
Engine Optimization For Dummies, (Peter Kent) goes into great detail about
this topic. However, before you can begin to optimize your site for search
engines, you need to understand the lingo of the search world as well as the
online advertising and Internet marketing initiatives that populate it. Here are
a few of the most common terms that Web analytics masters use to describe
these measurements:
 Acquisition: Just like it sounds, acquisition is attracting customers to a
Web site by using various advertising and marketing strategies.
 Affiliate marketing: This is an advertising system in which Web site
owners, search engine marketers, and e-mail marketers promote compa-
nies in return for a commission. This commission is often either a per-
centage of revenue or a flat fee, sometimes called a bounty. When a
visitor clicks an advertisement, he is taken to the merchant site. If the
visitor makes a purchase from the merchant, the affiliate receives a com-
mission.
 Banner ad: A banner ad is an advertisement that is displayed on a Web
page. Some banners allow visitors to click through the advertiser’s site.
This allows you to measure the effectiveness of the banner.
 Keyword: These are terms entered into the search box of a search
engine.
 Organic search: This is a search that retrieves results by indexing pages
based on content and keyword relevancy.
 Pay per click (PPC): Also called paid search, this method retrieves list-
ings based on who paid the most money for keywords to appear at the
top of the search results.
 Search engine marketing (SEM): This is a method that seeks to
increases the ranking and visibility of a Web site in search engine results
pages. This includes creating paid search campaigns.
 Search engine optimization (SEO): This is a method of improving the
rankings for relevant keywords in search results by making changes to
the content or navigational structure of a Web site.
 Segment: This is a customer group as defined by a user’s activities on a
Web site or other strategic data. Segmenting allows Web sites to target
their visitors more effectively based on specified behaviors.

30
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Defining Actionable Data
Actionable data offers an accurate foundation on which to make decisions
about changes to your Web site, search engine marketing, or customer rela-
tionship management. Here are some terms that are associated with digging
for the hidden statistical treasure in your Web analytics software:
 Aggregate data: This is a summary of the information that your Web
analytics program collects. It is presented in groups rather than individ-
ual-level statistics.
 Average lifetime value (ALV): This metric defines an individual visitor’s
lifetime value in monetary terms by tracking past orders. This could be a
helpful metric when determining to whom to send private sales or spe-
cial discount offers.
 Benchmark: A benchmark is a clearly defined point of reference from
which measurements can be made. Benchmarks become standards by
which you can judge the effectiveness of your advertising and marketing
initiatives.
 Filters: Using filters is a method of narrowing the scope of a report by
defining statistical ranges or data types that should or should not be
included.
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Return on investment
The bottom line on Web analytics is return on
investment (ROI). After all, this software isn’t
measuring behavior for the heck of it. The goal
is to tweak your site and its content to drive
more conversions. The greater the number of
conversions, the greater the return on your
online investment. Here are several ROI terms
that you want to get straight when considering
how your online strategies are paying off:
 ROMI: You can determine the Return on
Marketing Investment (ROMI) by looking at
site referrers and clickstreams of visitors
who came in through marketing efforts such
as link exchanges, posting to newsgroups
and blogs, or sponsorships of online events.
 ROAS: The Return on Advertising Spend
measures your conversions stemming from
banner ads and paid search.
 GRP: Gross Rating Point offers the percent-
age of your target audience that an ad
reaches. If you aren’t careful, your return
could fail to cover your spending. Web ana-
lytics can save you time, money, and finan-
cial headaches by making it crystal clear
what is working — and what is not.

31
Chapter 2: Steering Clear of Common Terminology Confusion
 Key performance indicator (KPI): KPIs illustrate how well a site is per-
forming against goals. You can read much more about KPIs in Chapter 11.
 Log file: This kind of file records transactions that occurred on the Web
server. Log file data can include a visitor’s IP address, site referrer, date
and time of the visitor, and other analytical information.
When you dive into Web analytics, you’ll quickly realize that you can slice the
data 12 ways from Sunday. In other words, there are many different perspec-
tives of what’s happening on your site. Start with the simple metrics, like
unique visitors, site referrers, and clickstreams before you attempt to under-
stand some of the more advanced analytics discussed in later chapters.
Untangling Technical Terms
You don’t have to attend a technical institute to take full advantage of Web
analytics software, but you do need to untangle a few technical terms if you
want to fully understand what you are looking at and what you are looking
for. Take a few minutes to review these complex technical terms spelled out
in plain language and you’ll be rattling off these acronyms with the best tech
geeks out there.
 Active Server Pages (ASP): This a scripting language, developed by
Microsoft, that runs on a Web server. It allows developers build Web
pages that present dynamic content, images and text that are pulled from
a database, XML file, or other data source.
 Application Programming Interface (API): This is a language and
format that one software program uses to communicate with another
software program.
 Authentication: This process requires users to enter a username or
password to identify themselves in order to gain access to a Web site’s
resources. Users might be asked to log in to a Member’s Only section or
provide details to make a payment in an e-commerce transaction.
 Bandwidth: This is the amount of data that can be transferred to and
from a Web site in a given period of time. This is usually expressed as
bits per second (bps) or higher units like Mbps (millions of bits per
second).
 Cookie: These are small text files that allow a Web server to store infor-
mation about a visitor and recognize them when they return.

32
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
 JavaScript: Not to be confused with the Java programming language,
JavaScript is a scripting language developed by Netscape. It can be
embedded into the HTML (HyperText Markup Language) of a Web page
to add functionality, such as validating data or responding to a visitor’s
button clicks.
 Platform: This is the operating system that runs a computer. The three
most common operating systems are Windows, Macintosh, and Linux.
 Robot: Also known as Web crawlers, bots, or spiders, a robot is an auto-
mated script or program that browses the Web. Search engines use
robots to gather up-to-date data as they index the Web.
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Are your spiders poisonous?
There are only a few poisonous spiders in the
world (and that’s more than enough), but just
one Black Widow bite could cause a painful
headache, among other unwanted symptoms.
In the online world, spiders — also known as
Web crawlers, bots, or robots — wander
around the Web to gather up-to-date data as
they index the Web and are typically welcomed
visitors because they help your search engine
rankings. There are a few “poisonous” spiders
that you should be aware of, though.
Benign bots follow proper protocols, letting
Web analytics programs know that they are
automated scripts so that they aren’t mistaken
for actual human beings. Bad bots, on the other
hand, masquerade themselves as real people in
hopes of gathering data from your site — such
as e-mail addresses — to use for their own pur-
poses. You can tell the difference by analyzing
your log analysis for high-query volumes from
an IP page range. If a bot queries you 20 or 30
times in an hour, it’s probably up to no good.
Check with your hosting company or server
administrator for ways to block them at the Web
server level and stop them dead in their tracks.

genius or easily intimidated by double digits, we’ll be right here with you 
as you get acquainted with your Web measurement tools and the statistics
that they generate. Remember: Your goal is to improve your Web site’s 
performance — and your profits.
Your first Web analytics assignment is not merely an exercise in overcoming a
technology learning curve. This chapter yields useful results as we escort
you through accessing your Web stats and recording important data. You’ll
see how to measure your Web site’s progress toward your goals, too. So be
sure to make a good record of the stats you discover while going through
these motions.
Are you ready? All right, then. Take a deep breath, roll up your sleeves, and get
ready to get your hands dirty with Web data. Pretty soon you’ll be reading —
and analyzing — your reports with the best of them and taking action to make
your Web site the best it can be.

Help! I Can’t Find My Stats!
Maybe you’ve admired your eye-pleasing Web site for many months without
ever realizing that a back-end might exist that offers more tools than the aver-
age do-it-yourselfer’s toolbox. Depending on your Web host, the back-end —
that is, a control panel, which comprises site configuration and management
software application — of your Web site might offer general account informa-
tion about your hosting package, along with your IP (Internet Protocol)
address, disk e-mail configurations, FTP (File Transfer Protocol) accounts,
site management tools, databases, and, yes, Web analytics software.
In fact, you might be pleasantly surprised to discover what you can control
on the front-end by visiting your Web site’s control panel. One of the most
popular Web control panels is cPanel. It supports many operating systems
and allows you to manage and monitor almost every aspect of your Web site
with an easy user interface. Other popular control panels are Ensim, Plesk,
Helm, and Webmin. For the exercises in this chapter, we use cPanel
(www.cpanel.com; see Figure 3-1) because it is widely available and offers
several options when it comes to viewing your statistics information.

How to access your Web analytics tools
Time to take a look at a back-end. If your host offers cPanel with your hosting
account, you can access your Web analytics tools by following three easy
steps:
1. Point your browser to the control panel.
Generally, you can access your cPanel installation by typing your URL,
followed by a slash and then cpanel. Here’s an example:
http://www.yoururl.com/cpanel
That URL will probably direct you to another URL that corresponds with
your Web hosting provider, so don’t be alarmed if the URL changes. If
you know that your hosting company offers cPanel but the instructions
above don’t take you anywhere, you may need to contact your hosting
company to get the URL for your cPanel installation.
2. Enter your username and password and click OK to gain access to the
control panel.
You are greeted with a pop-up box that instructs you to enter your Name
and Password. (See Figure 3-2.) You may choose to select a check box
that offers to remember your password so you don’t have to enter it the
next time around. (If you’ve already forgotten your Name and Password,
of if you never knew what it was to begin with, contact your Web hosting
provider for details.)
3. In the Web/FTP Stats section (in the center column, the second cate-
gory), click the software that you would like to use.
Voilà! You have access to a world of data.

Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

You’ll see several different links in this section, as shown in Figure 3-3.
The options available in this area depend on what your Web host has
enabled for the server. Keep reading to see what kind of information
these links offer.
If your host has enabled several different analytics applications, you’re prob-
ably wondering which link to click. Don’t worry: The choice is not as dra-
matic as taking the red pill or the blue pill. You are not in The Matrix. The
following sections serve as a quick guide to understanding what’s behind all
those “doors” so that you can walk through the one you really need.
AWStats Stats
AWStats is a popular, free analytics application that displays your traffic logs
graphically. Feature-rich and fast, it’s generally a good option if you need to
get overview data for your Web site. One of the downsides to this choice is
that it displays data monthly but does not give you the flexibility to see data
for one particular day or a date range. (See Figure 3-4.)
Urchin Stats
As soon as you click the Urchin link, you’ll notice that the Urchin user inter-
face is exceptionally graphical. It also parses your log files and displays the
information graphically, similar to AWStats. Urchin might run slightly slower
because of its graphic-rich interface, but it allows you to see data by day,

For more information on how to select the right Web analytics tools for your
Web site, read Chapter 4.
Latest Visitors
Click this link for a quick look at the latest visitors, which are organized by
their IP address, a unique numeric code assigned by the user’s Internet ser-
vice provider (ISP). This section also shows you the HTTP (HyperText
Transfer Protocol) response code. (An HTTP response code, or HTTP code, is
generated each time a visitor requests a file. For more information on HTTP
codes, read Chapter 10.) This area also shows you the page visited; the
browser that was used; and, in some cases, the site referrer. However, this
section doesn’t put any of the data in context. (See Figure 3-6.)
The Latest Visitors view is ideal when you want a quick look at what your
recent visitors did on your site. For example, say your business receives a
phone call, and the user mentions that he Googled your Web site: You might
be able to look at this log to determine the caller’s exact search terms and
which pages he visited on your site. That could give you some clue as to
what search terms are most effective and/or what content or images on the
Figure 3-6:
The cPanel
view of the
latest
visitors to
the Web
site.
38
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

pages he visited that spurred him to pick up the phone and call. Did the
search terms he used actually match what he was calling about, or was it just
an entry point of interest? Were there strong calls to action on those pages?
Did he have to go to a contact page to get your phone number, or was it read-
ily available for him? Most importantly, did you actually close the sale, or was
it just a waste of time? As you can see, the Latest Visitors section can give
you plenty to consider.
Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred to and from a Web
site in a given period of time. This is usually expressed as bits per second
(bps) or in higher units like Mbps (millions of bits per second). The band-
width report may include HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and POP3 traffic.
Before you go into acronym overload, let us explain. The following are the
main consumers of your bandwidth:
 HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): The four letters before the www in
a URL, this is the actual communications protocol that enables Web
browsing. HTTP traffic is browser-based traffic.
 SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol): This is used to send and receive
e-mail.
 FTP (File Transfer Protocol): This is the language used for file transfer
for computer to computer across the World Wide Web.
 POP3 (Post Office Protocol): This traffic is a data format delivery of
e-mail across the Internet.
Keeping an eye on bandwidth usage isn’t always the most exciting activity. If
your site attracts lots of traffic, though, watch your bandwidth to make sure
you aren’t going to exceed the quota imposed by your host. That can result
in slow Web site performance, costly overage charges, or even deactivation
of your hosting account. Would-be visitors might click the Stop button on
their browser while they grow impatient waiting for the site to load — or, if
the requested site doesn’t load, they might easily go to your competitor
instead.
Error Log
This list (see Figure 3-7) gives you a quick rundown of your site errors — that
is, what has gone wrong on your site — showing the last 300 error log mes-
sages, in reverse order. You can see the exact date and time of the error, the
error code, and an explanation of what it means. (Now all you have to do is
fix it.) For more information on error codes, also called HTTP codes, read
Chapter 10.

Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

Raw Log File
Click this link to get a pop-up box from your browser asking you what you’d
like to do with the file. You can open it or save it to your hard drive. Unless
you are highly analytical, though, you might not be able to make sense of its
contents. A raw log file stores information of all requests made to your Web
site. These are the files that your Web analytics software uses to calculate the
Web site statistics. The format looks something like this:
68.142.250.40 - - [30/Sep/2005:03:12:35 -0500] “GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.0” 404 -
“-” “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Yahoo! Slurp;
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp)”
68.142.249.113 - - [30/Sep/2005:03:12:35 -0500] “GET /dog.php?breed=Chihuahua
HTTP/1.0” 200 6321 “-” “Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Yahoo! Slurp;
http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp)”
You might need access to these files if you want to run a client-side Web ana-
lytics software package. Client-side Web analytics are programs that are
installed on your computer, just like Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.
For more information on client-side, server-side, and hosted Web analytics
software solutions, read Chapter 4.

Raw Log Manager
The Raw Log Manager (see Figure 3-8) allows you to control whether your
raw log files are saved or deleted at the end of each month. If you choose to
save your logs, you can use the Raw Log Manager to view any saved logs. You
have two options here:
 Archive logs. If you want to save your raw logs at the end of the month,
select the Archive Logs in Your Home Directory at the End of Each
Month check box.
 Remove logs. If you want to remove the previous month’s saved logs
when a new month’s logs are saved, select the Remove the Previous
Month’s Archived Logs from Your Home Directory at the End of Each
Month check box.
Regardless of whether you choose to archive or remove your logs, click the
Save button to put the command into effect.
Saving your logs can take up a tremendous amount of disk space. Busy sites
can build up log files as large as several gigabytes in one month. These files
count against your storage space on your hosting account. If you have lots of
very large files, you might need to upgrade your hosting package or choose
not to save log files for more than one month.

Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

What if my host doesn’t offer analytics?
Arrgh. You access your control panel only to discover that you have no Web
analytics software package preinstalled on the back-end. Uh, oh. Now what
are you going to do? First, don’t panic. Plenty of free options are available
that can get you started quickly and fairly easily. See Chapter 5 for the low-
down information on choosing and setting up analytics applications.
Some hosting providers might be willing to install higher-end Web analytics
applications — for a price. If you determine that you need something more
robust than what you have available, check with your provider.
Taking a Sneak Peek at the Data
By now, your curiosity has probably gotten the best of you. You probably
went ahead and opened your Web analytics software and looked at all the
numbers, charts, graphs, and other pertinent data-oriented presentations. If
you weren’t that brave, take a sneak peek at the data right now.
Before you get too excited — or nervous, as the case may be — remember
that you’re just looking at some overall numbers here so you can get your feet
wet (and your hands at least a little dirty.) Read along to see how to review
the monthly history so you can see how your site has been performing. Then,
delve into site referrers, measure the conversion rate, and set some goals for
your site. If you want to jump right into the deep end, read Chapter 11 on key
performance indicators (KPIs) and swim with the big sharks.
Recording your monthly history
It’s been said that when Christopher Columbus set out for the New World, he
didn’t have a clue where he was going. He didn’t know where he was when he
got there. And he didn’t know where he had been when he returned to Spain.
Old Chris could have avoided at least the latter half of that legacy if he had
simply recorded his monthly history.
Of course, Columbus deserves a bit of a break. After all, it was 1492 when he
sailed the ocean blue. He didn’t have any maps to follow nor high-tech gad-
gets to guide him to his discovery of America. You don’t have the same
excuse. As you steer the ship (your Web site) toward the land of opportunity
(greater profits), you can be sure of where you are headed, you’ll know when
you get there, and you’ll be able to tell others how you did it — that is, if you
record your monthly history.
42
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

Recording your monthly history lets you set a benchmark so that you’ll know
how far you’ve come from month to month. You can compare how many
unique visitors, visits, pages, and hits you’ve had as well as how much band-
width you used in any given month. With that information in hand, you can
compare those numbers with other months to determine historical trends,
such as busy seasons. You can also use your monthly history to measure the
effectiveness of campaigns.
For a more detailed review of monthly reporting, read Chapter 15.
For now, allow us to show you some of the basics as you familiarize yourself
with the software. With your control panel open (see how to open this, ear-
lier in chapter), here’s what you need to do. Again, we’re using AWStats.
1. Click the AWStats Stats link.
It’s under the Web/FTP Stats section, in the middle column.
In the left-hand column is a list of options.
2. Click the Monthly history link (the first option under the When 
category).
See Figure 3-9.
Figure 3-9:
The monthly
history view
from
AWStats.
43
Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

You see a bar graph with various colors that correspond to the headings
on the chart below. There are headings for Month, Unique Visitors,
Pages, Hits, and Bandwidth.
3. Save this history.
Some Web analytics programs will save this data for you automatically,
though perhaps only for a period of time. You could also input it into a
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet or burn it to a disk. For more back up rec-
ommendations, check out Chapter 15.
Although your software will keep this record for you, plan for the worst
and record it elsewhere. If you switch analytics providers or if some cat-
astrophe occurs, you could lose your data. As you progress through the
sea of Web analytics, you will want to identify KPIs and add those
records to your historical data as well.
Each month of the current year is listed on your monthly history report. This
is helpful, for example, when you want to compare specific months: say, this
June with last June. Here’s how:
1. Scroll to the top of the page.
You see a box there with two items inside, as well as the AWStats globe.
You’ll see the date and time that your analytics program last updated
the data. AWStats commonly processes your Web site log files automati-
cally every night, but your host might have set this process to happen
less frequently. If you’re looking at data that’s more than 24–48 hours
old, look for an Update Now link.
2. (Optional) Click the Update Now link to get to-the-minute stats.
This option to manually update your stats is not available with all Web
hosts.
3. Set the reported period.
The second, and only other, line item in the box is Reported Period. Use
the two drop-down menus there to choose any month of any year of
your Web site’s history. Choose the month and year for which you want
to receive data and then click OK.
At the bottom of each column, your handy-dandy Web analytics program
tallies how many unique visitors, visits, pages, and hits you’ve had, year to
date, as well as how much bandwidth you used, as shown in Figure 3-10.
Off the bat, you might see some trends by simply reviewing your monthly his-
tory. Hopefully, you are pleasantly rewarded by steadily increasing unique
visitor counts. If your site is on the skids, though, it could be time to amp up
your lead generating efforts — or maybe you need a whole new look.

Making note of peak days and times
Although recording monthly history gives you a good historical baseline,
making note of peak days and times offers a here-and-now point of view. You
can get fairly detailed with these charts, opting to view days of the month,
days of the week, or hours of the day.
Dealing in days of the month
How many people visited your site on October 17? Was that more or less than
the number of folks who walked through your virtual doors on October 1? You
can find out in a flash by viewing your Days of Month report. Here’s how to
access and read this report. (See Figure 3-11.) With your control panel open
1. Click the AWStats Stats link.
It’s under the Web/FTP Stats section in the middle column.
2. Click the Days of Month link.
Look for this in the left column, in the options list, under the When 
category.
Figure 3-10:
Viewing

45
Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

3. Review the Days of Month report.
This report offers a line graph and a day-by-day chart that outlines the
number of visits, pages, and hits as well as bandwidth used for each day
of the month, with the current day of the month highlighted. The days
highlighted in gray are weekend days. For e-commerce sites, weekends
might be among the busiest of the month: comparatively, for service
firms, the lightest.
What’s really neat for the math-averse is that the Days of the Month report
offers totals and averages so you can avoid the number crunching and the
calculator pecking. Maybe you got 10,000 hits one day and 5,700 another, and
only 3,200 another. This report gives you an average per day. It also reveals
the average bandwidth used in a day so you can adjust your Web hosting
package to get more bandwidth if you need it.
Delving into days of the week
If you want to drill down even further, check out the Days of Week report. The
data is narrower, but that’s the point: If you just want to see how many hits
you got on Wednesday, this little chart satisfies the need. Here’s how to find
your Days of Week report in AWStats. (See Figure 3-12.) With your control
panel open
Figure 3-11:
The Days of

46
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

1. Click the AWStats Stats link.
It’s under the Web/FTP Stats section in the middle column.
2. Click the Days of Week link.
Look in the left column option list. It’s under the When category.
3. Review the Days of Week report.
You see a line graph that shows you the peaks and valleys that your Web
analytics program recorded throughout the current week. Make a note of
which day of the week sees the most traffic to compare it with weeks
past — and get ready to compare it against weeks in the future.
Honing in on hours of the day
Honing in on hours of the day can lead to some intriguing insights. You might
discover that night owls are populating your site. Or you might discover that
the early birds are catching the worms that you leave out for bait. Here’s how
to find your Hours report in AWStats. (See Figure 3-13.) With your control
panel open
Figure 3-12:
The Days of
the Week
report from
AWStats.
47
Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

1. Click the AWStats Stats link.
2. Click the Hours link.
3. Review the Hours report.
You’ll see a line graph that shows you the peaks and valleys your Web analyt-
ics program recorded throughout the current week. Make a note of which day
of the week sees the most traffic, then compare it to weeks past and get ready
to compare it to weeks in the future. There are several insights you can glean
from the Hours report. For example, if the bulk of your traffic comes between
the hours of 9am and 5pm, then you can accurately assume that most of your
users are surfing from work. This type of visitor behaves different than week-
night or weekend traffic. For example, at-work users usually prefer to visit
Web sites that don’t feature music or sound because they don’t want their
boss to find out they are goofing off at work. What’s more, at-work users may
be trying to take care of some personal matters on a break or at lunch,
making quick checkout options a desirable characteristic for this audience.
Get creative with your Web promotions. Knowing what hours see the most
traffic could help you craft special midnight sales, early-bird specials, or even
lunchtime-giveaways designed to give that traffic an incentive to become reg-
ular customers, subscribers, or readers.
Figure 3-13:

Where’s my traffic coming from?
Half the battle of any e-business is driving traffic to your site. After all, you
can’t convert a visitor into a customer, subscriber, loyal reader, or qualified
lead until you first get that visitor to your site. Whether you depend purely
on organic search or you pull out all the stops with a combination of paid
search, affiliate marketers, link building campaigns, and the like, you need to
know what methods are working — and what methods are not.
Einstein is attributed with this pithy witticism: “Insanity: Doing the same
thing over and over again and expecting different results.” He’s got a pretty
good point: If your traffic-building tactics aren’t working, don’t go nuts. Just
change your tactics.
Perhaps you need to write Web site copy that uses keywords more effectively.
Maybe you need to work harder to build reciprocal links. In fact, it could be
any number of things. You won’t know where to begin, though, until you find
out where your traffic is (and isn’t) coming from. Here’s how (see Figure 3-14).
With your control panel open
1. Click the AwStats Stats link.
2. Click the Origin link.
Look in the option list, in the left column. Toward the bottom of the list
is the Referrers section. The link is there.
Figure 3-14:
The

49
Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

3. Review your Referrers.
In the Connect to Site From section, you will find four or five key cate-
gories. You can see your site referrers by examining these four sections.
The Origin section breaks down visitors in terms of hits, pages, and per-
centages. In the following sections, we briefly review each section. For
extensive information on where your traffic is coming from, read
Chapter 9.
Direct Addresses/Bookmarks
The first origin in the list of site referrers is Direct Addresses and Bookmarks.
Visitors who either typed in your URL by hand in response to some external
prompt (usually an offline ad) as well as loyal visitors who have bookmarked
your site are counted in this section. If you already have an established fol-
lowing or if you do a lot of offline advertising, a large percentage of your traf-
fic natural falls under the Direct Address/Bookmarks section of your site
referrer report.
Links from a NewsGroup
This section records how many visitors found your site through a newsgroup.
A newsgroup is a Usenet discussion group that is related to one topic. Internet
users can subscribe to many different newsgroups. Perhaps one of your traf-
fic building strategies is to position yourself as an expert in a newsgroup on
real estate. You would put your URL at the bottom of your signature, and
anyone who sees it can visit you online.
Google and Yahoo!, among other industry powerhouses, have newsgroups,
but they are not as powerful of a tool for generating traffic as they once were.
Some have blamed the decline of newsgroups on blogs and social networking
sites, such as MySpace and Facebook. If you are spending several hours a
week posting on newsgroups and have little to no traffic to show for it, your
time might be better spent on some other traffic-building initiative (like blog-
ging or social networking).
Links from an Internet Search Engine
A quick glance at the Links from an Internet Search Engine section (see Figure
3-15) records which search engines send traffic to your Web site. Chances are
that if your Web site is listed in a particular search engine, it will drive at
least some traffic. You’ll notice that the chart breaks down the percentage of
traffic that came from all search engines put together so you can compare it
with other site referrers.
50
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

One engine will likely drive the majority of your traffic. That could be
because you are running paid advertising campaigns on that engine or that
engine has more active spiders. Also known as Web crawlers or robots, spiders
are programs or automated scripts that browse the Web. You might occasion-
ally hear spiders referred to as ants, automatic indexers, bots, or worms.
Search engines use spiders to gather up-to-date data as they index the Web.
Look for any niche search engines that drive traffic to your site. This is an
area that you might want to exploit. Those niche engines, or other search
engines that have the potential to drive more traffic to your site, could be
hidden beyond the Top 10. Right next to the Links from an Internet Search
Engine heading is a blue link that reads Full List. Be sure to click that link to
see every engine that’s sending traffic your way.
Links from an External Page
This section shows site referrers that are not search engines. In other words,
these sites referrers are other Web sites beyond Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and
others. These external pages are listed first, second, third, and so on, based
on how many visitors they referred to your site. The chart breaks down the
percentage of traffic that came from all external pages put together so you
can compare it with other site referrers.
Be sure to go beyond the Top 10 external page referrals to see who else is
sending traffic your way. You can do this by clicking the Full List heading
right under the section header. It could be that the quality of traffic coming
from blog sites is more valuable than traffic coming from content exchanges.

51
Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

You won’t know unless you do a comparison. Sometimes it’s not the quantity
but rather the quality of the traffic that counts.
In AWStats, when you view the full list of site referrers from an external page,
you’ll notice a box right above it that allows you to choose Filter or Exclude
Filter. Filters are applied to the information coming into your Web analytics
reports.
You can use filters to manipulate the final data your Web analytics applica-
tion displays so you can get reports that suit your needs. With Google
Analytics for example, you could set up filters to exclude visits from certain
IP addresses — such as the origins of known referrer spam (for more informa-
tion on referrer spam, read Chapter 7) — or you could set filters to take
dynamic page URLs and convert them into readable text strings. Here’s a list
of some filters you could use in Google Analytics:
 Exclude all traffic from a domain: You can use this filter to exclude traf-
fic from a specific domain, such as an ISP or company network. This is
helpful in fighting referrer spam.
 Exclude all traffic from an IP address: You could use this filter to
exclude clicks from certain sources. You could enter one or many
addresses. This is also helpful in fighting referrer spam.
 Include only traffic to a subdirectory: You might choose to use this
filter if you are only interested in tracking behavior of visitors to a par-
ticular section of the site.
 Exclude pattern: You could use this filter to exclude hits that match the
filter pattern. For example, a filter that excludes Firefox would also
exclude all other information in that hit, such as visitor, path, referral
and domain information. You might decide to do this if you are trying to
differentiate the behavior of visitors who use one browser over another
before you optimize your site for a particular browser.
 Uppercase/Lowercase: This filter converts the contents of the field into
all uppercase or all lowercase letters.
 Search & Replace: You could use this filter to search for a pattern
within a field and replace the found pattern with an alternate form.
You can create many different types of custom filters that meet your needs.
Be sure to find out first, though, if you can keep all your raw data intact so
you can go back and review the full reports without filters if you choose to.
Also, remember to remove the custom filter after it has served its purpose.
52
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

Unknown Origin
You might find this difficult to believe in this high-tech age in which we live,
but sometimes your Web analytics program just doesn’t know where someone
who visited your Web site came from. Referrers are determined by reverse
DNS look-ups — that is, translating IP numbers to domain names to uncode the
true referrer. However, many numerical addresses are of unknown origin.
When you review your site referrers, you might be disgruntled by the per-
centage of hits that seem to wear the cloak of anonymity. Even the best ana-
lytics programs are stumped, it seems, although this is clear: If you see a high
level of use from an unresolved IP number, it could be spiders. The Unknown
Origin category, though, at least shows you how many of these masked visi-
tors you had.
Comprehending Conversion Rates
You can hardly claim that you’ve gotten your hands dirty with Web analytics
until you measure your conversion rate. Conversion occurs when you close the
deal — that is, when you convert a visitor into a buyer, subscriber, or member.
The conversion rate, then, is the percentage of your Web site visitors that take
the desired action. That can mean completing a retail sale for merchandise;
subscribing to a newsletter, magazine, or community; filling out a form that
sends you information to qualify a lead, or achieving some other goal.
The conversion rate is sort of the bottom line of Web analytics and the Web
site optimization that follows. You might look at any number of KPIs in your
quest to turn more traffic into customers. However, it’s often the overall con-
version rate that tells you whether the changes you are making to your site
are helping — or hurting — your cause. For more insights into KPIs, read
Chapter 11.
Calculating that all-important metric
Your conversion rate is an all-important metric. Here’s where it gets fun. You
can calculate more than one kind of conversion rate. For instance, you could
measure the average number of visitors prior to conversion, the new visitor
conversion rate, the returning visitor conversion rate, the repeat customer
conversion rate, and . . . well, you get the picture.
53
Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

Right now, focus on the overall conversion rate. Calculating your conversion
rate is not difficult, even for mathophobic. Here’s how it works:
1. Determine the number of positive outcomes.
The first step in calculating the overall conversion rate is to determine
how many positive outcomes you had in a defined period — usually a
month. In other words, how many widgets did you sell, how many leads
did you generate, and how many subscriptions did you receive? This is
your baseline number.
2. Determine the number of unique visitors.
The second step is to determine how many unique visitors you had
during that same period. You can find this in your Web analytics pro-
gram under the Unique Visitors label.
3. Divide and conquer.
Divide the number of closings by the number of unique visitors. That is
your overall conversion rate.
You’re probably wondering whether your conversion rate is healthy or ill. The
answer is, “That depends.” Namely, that depends on several factors, including
what industry you are in and what users need to surrender (information,
money, or both) to buy what you are selling. According to the Fireclick Index
(an index developed by hosted Web analytics provider Fireclick; www.
fireclick.com), average conversion rates vary greatly. As an example, the
October 16, 2006 index showed the following conversion rates:
 Electronics Industry
Conversion rate = 0.40%
Abandonment rate = 84%
 Fashion and Apparel Industry
Conversion rate = 1.90%
Abandonment rate = 69.8%
 Catalog Industry
Conversion rate = 4.80%
Abandonment rate = 65.10%
 Outdoor and Sports Industry
Conversion rate = 0.40%
Abandonment rate = 63%
 Software Industry
Conversion rate = 3.50%
Abandonment rate = 80.40%
54
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 

As you can see, the catalogers do it best, followed by the software industry.
The electronics and sports industry products are notably harder sells. A 2-
percent conversion rate in the fashion industry is fairly standard. A 2-percent
conversion rate in the software industry, though, could cause a headache.
Goal Setting 101
We assume that your goal is the same as most other Web site owners’ goals:
to be wildly successful and make lots of money. You’ll need to get a little
more specific than that if you want to achieve Web wealth status. In fact, your
e-business goals should be broken down into two categories: non-financial
and financial. You should also have an idea of what you expect to get out of
your e-business this year, next year, and several years from now. This is typi-
cally called a marketing plan, or the marketing section of a business plan.
If you want a good lesson on how to write a business plan or a marketing
plan, pick up a copy of Wiley Publishing’s Business Plans For Dummies.
Meanwhile, hear this: Your goals should always be realistic yet challenging. It
doesn’t matter whether you are the Amazon of your category or still playing
in the Pee Wee league. Google didn’t start off as the most profitable search
engine. So take a look at your historical data and keep in mind your strategies
and tactics as you set out to set goals.
Setting nonfinancial goals
Nonfinancial goals can be related to financial goals at a broad level.
Nonfinancial goals include entering new territories; adding new products, ser-
vices, content, or customer support features to your Web site; or increasing
market share 25 percent per year for the next three years.
After you implement the strategies that aim to help you meet your goals, Web
analytics can help you measure them. Did the Spanish-language translation of
your Web site increase your market share? Web analytics will measure it for
you. Do those new products help boost profits? Web analytics will tell you.
Do those new customer service tools reduce calls to the call center? Web
analytics can help you figure that out, too.
Setting financial goals
Your financial goals should be more definite. Maybe you want to grow sales
from $100,000 last year to $125,000 this year and $150,000 the following year.
Or if you are an entrepreneur who is convinced that you have the next best
idea since Google, your goal might be to land venture capital investment. The
latter means proving your business model, which probably means building
your traffic or your conversions. Web analytics, once again, helps you mea-
sure your progress toward your financial goals.

Chapter 3: Getting Your Hands Dirty with Web Data

Setting conversion rate goals
Because determining whether you met your lofty goals will be measured in
some way, shape, or form by calculating the conversion rate, you might as
well set a conversion rate goal, too. If you’re in the catalog industry, for exam-
ple, your goal should probably be a conversion rate of about four percent
because that’s the industry standard. If you are in some other industry, first
determine what the industry standard is and then set that as your benchmark.
Generally speaking, a conversion rate of 2 percent is admirable — and that
means there’s plenty of room for improvement. No matter what your current
conversion rate, just think of the potential profits you could generate if you
could double that number.
Setting Web site goals
Increasing conversions might mean increasing visitor counts, average time
on site, or some other area. With that in mind, you need to tie your financial
and nonfinancial goals to the Web statistics your software measures. Maybe
you need to increase the number of visitors from 5,000 per month to 15,000
per month to give yourself a fighting chance to double that conversion rate.
Or maybe you need to add content or imagery to keep visitors on your site
longer. Maybe you need search engine optimization, which covers making
changes to your Web site so that it attracts more visitors from search
engines. You can employ any number of strategies. Just be sure to measure
them to find out whether they’re doing the trick.
56
Part I: Getting Started with Web Analytics 
Ready, set, measure
Some media portals aren’t waiting for visitors to
enter into their virtual content shop. Instead,
they push content to the people through Really
Simple Syndication (RSS). RSS is a software
system that lets users subscribe to content from
their favorite Web sites. With this technology,
you can put your content into a standardized
format that can be viewed and organized
through RSS-aware software or automatically
delivered as new content on another Web site.
On the reader’s end, a feed reader or content
aggregation software can check those sub-
scriptions for new content and pull it into a dis-
play. Web analytics software allows media
portals that rely on RSS to push content to its
loyal readers to measure their efforts.
RSS is actually easier to measure than e-mail.
Your goal with RSS measurement is to deter-
mine how many people subscribe to your feed
and whether that number is increasing or
decreasing. If your subscribers are declining,
perhaps your content is boring for your target
audience. In that case, you need to revamp your
content strategy in a hurry because this decline
could soon become apparent on your Web site,
too. Web analytics can also tell you whether
your subscribers are clicking the content items
in the RSS feed. If your subscribers aren’t actu-
ally reading the content, you might need to offer
more creative headlines that will entice them.

Choosing the Right
Web Analytics
Solution

In this part . . .
T
ime to make some decisions. In this part we will arm
you with detailed information that will help you deter-
mine what type — or types — of Web analytics tools you
need to get the data you crave. You’ll quickly learn that
while all Web analytics tools have the same objective — 
to measure visitor behavior — no two software packages
are exactly alike. Understand the differences and you are
well on your way to choosing the best solution for your
Web site.
We start off with a discussion of the pros and cons of the
three basic options in Web analytics programming: server-
side, client-side, and hosted solutions. Those terms may
not mean much to you now, but soon you’ll understand
what types of tools you need — and why you need them.
You may even discover that you need to use more than
one type of tool to gather all the data you desire. In this
part, we’ll guide you through the ins and outs of leverag-
ing multiple tool types, too.
Before you actually invest in a particular vendor, though,
you’ll need to do some test drives. We’ll show you how to
get your hands on some free analytics tools and get a
taste of what’s available. We’ll also introduce you to some
low-cost tools that may take you where you need to go.
And if your appetite for data is virtually insatiable, we’ll
escort you straight to some enterprise-level tools that
offer more data than you may have thought possible. 
With the popularity of social networking and new “push”
technologies, we wouldn’t dare leave out niche Web ana-
lytics solutions. You’ll discover which analytics vendors
are catering to the special needs of search marketers with
tools customized to track pay-per-click advertising, blog-
ging, and RSS feeds. We’ll help you get acquainted with
A/B and multivariate testing software and usher you into a
Web analytics world where you can watch the action live,
click by click.

M
ore than 100 Web analytics vendors are on the market, and while
industry experts expect some consolidation in the years ahead, they
also expect some new start-ups to emerge on the scene. Wading through the
scores of Web analytics tools on the market can be daunting for even the
most experienced Web gurus. That same task can be frustrating for those
who are just learning the lingo. And it can be absolutely maddening for 
newbies.
Unlike many other software segments, choosing a Web analytics tool is not
merely a matter of brand name or even price. Although those factors should
certainly play a role in your decision, you have three distinct options in the
analytics world:
 Server-side: Server-side analytics tools are software installed on the
Web site’s server. Server-side solutions are often the most convenient
because many of them are preinstalled by your hosting company and
don’t require much work to start using them.
 Client-side: Client-side tools are installed on your computer. Client-side
software lets you keep track of multiple domains with the same tool and
can move with you if you change hosting companies.
 Hosted solutions: Hosted solutions are hosted by a service provider on
its server. Hosted solutions are independent of your Web server and
your desktop computer, but there is a monthly fee associated with most
of these services.

60
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 
Of course, this overview only describes Web analytics tools in a nutshell.
Finding the right tools that work for you means cracking that shell. Before
you begin reviewing Web analytics vendors, you need to understand the ins
and outs of these three classes of applications. In this chapter, we review the
pros and cons of server-side, client-side, and hosted solutions. We also offer
some reasons why you might want to use more than one type of tool.
Before You Begin . . .
Before you set out on this three-pronged trail, take inventory of your supplies
and outline a clear map of your specific needs. You may be impressed with the
bells and whistles a certain program class has to offer, but your budget might
not allow let you make that much noise. Consider the following factors as you
begin to compare and contrast the three classes of Web analytics software.
What’s my budget?
If your budget looks like a goose egg, don’t fret. Some attractive options are
available in both the server-side and hosted categories that cost little to
nothing. In addition to the free applications, you can find a fair selection of
feature-rich, hosted applications in the intermediate, or middle market,
budget range (between $15–$30 per month).
Most client-side solutions worth using are going to cost you a prettier penny
up front. On the low end, you could spend between $100 and $500 for an
entry-level client-side solution, but then it’s yours for the keeping. No
monthly fees to nag you. If money is no object — if you can fork over thou-
sands of dollars without blinking — don’t hesitate to check out the enter-
prise-level server-side and hosted Web analytics applications.
Some people swear by the adage that you get what you pay for. Of course, to
a certain extent, that is true. With so much competition in the Web analytics
market, though, you can find helpful tools at any price point. Decide how you
want to access your analytics and what options you need, and then begin
your search for a provider that meets those needs.
What does your hosting company support?
Some estimates figure that 90 percent of Web sites are hosted on shared
servers: that is, Web servers that host multiple clients and potentially thou-
sands of Web sites. So, if you’re like most Web site owners, your options

might be limited by the resources that your Web host provides. Most Web
hosting providers today offer free Web analytics tools (see Figure 4-1) such as
Webalizer (www.webalizer.com), AWStats (awstats.sourceforge.net),
and Urchin (www.google.com/analytics/urchin_software.html). If
your host offers those tools, your Web site is probably already recording met-
rics on your visitors. All you need to do is access them. Because no two Web
hosts are alike, you need to check your registration information or send an
e-mail to customer service to get instructions.
If your host isn’t quite gracious enough to offer free analytics tools as part of
the package, you might have to upgrade your account or purchase an add-on
package that includes the tools you need.
Server-side analytics applications require a complex installation and configu-
ration process. A professional server administrator with specialized training
typically performs this highly technical task. If your hosting company doesn’t
offer free analytics tools, installing a server-side analytics application on a
shared server is usually not an option. Clients generally don’t have the autho-
rization to install programs at the server level on shared servers for security
and performance reasons that could impact all the Web sites that share the
same server.
Check which analytics applications are offered before committing to a partic-
ular Web host. If your hosting company doesn’t come with analytics tools
already configured and if it doesn’t offer the ability to download access logs
(the data files your analytics applications use to get the data for reports-
more in the next section), your measurement options will be limited.

Chapter 4: Web Analytics Tools You Can Use

If you find yourself in this unwanted predicament, you might have the option
to use a client-side application like ClickTracks Analyzer to process your raw
logs. Of course, you need to check with your hosting provider to make sure
that you can get access to your raw traffic logs. Check the FAQs or send an
e-mail to customer service to get the skinny. If you can’t, the only way you
can get the data you crave is to use a hosted application like Google
Analytics.
Hosted applications are independent of your hosting provider. All they require
is that you add a small bit of code directly to the Web pages that you want to
track. That means your Web hosting company doesn’t have to lift a finger or
give you permission to access anything in order to gather your site statistics.
What’s more, hosted Web analytics applications can move with you if you
decide to move to another Web hosting company. If your Web site(s) oper-
ates on a dedicated server, you probably have a server administrator on staff
who can configure your server to work with the Web analytics solution of
your choice. A dedicated server is a server that you own or rent and offers
you full control.
Surveying Server-Side Software
Server-side applications are generally installed on the same server on which
your Web site is hosted, whether shared or dedicated. Server-side analytics
applications parse your log files at regularly scheduled intervals. Access logs,
also called raw log files or just log files, are simple data files that record visi-
tor data such as time of visit, what files a visitor accessed, where the visitors
were referred from, and more. The format looks something like this:
68.142.250.40 - - [30/Sep/2005:03:12:35 -0500] “GET /robots.txt HTTP/1.0” 404 -

Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

As you can imagine, trying to analyze these log files without an analytics
application to parse the data and turn it into easy-to-read charts and top ten
lists would be next to impossible for the average Joe. Some of the points an
analytics application could pull from the example data above are:
 There are six hits. A hit registers with every file that is accessed from
the server. The example logfile data shows a new line for each hit, as do
most log files.
 There are four unique visitors. This is based on the four unique IP
addresses (the set of numbers at the beginning of each entry).
 The first two hits are from Yahoo!’s crawler. This can be determined 
by the user agent section in parentheses near the end of each entry,
“Yahoo! Slurp; http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/slurp” as well as
the behavior in the first entry, accessing robots.txt, a text file that tells
robots if any files should be excluded from the search engine’s index.
These are just a few of the points that would be spelled out for you in easy-to-
read reports by your analytics application.
As we mention in the preceding section, if your Web site is hosted on a
shared server, there’s a good chance your provider has already preinstalled
the commonly free Web analytics tools, such as Webalizer, AWStats, and
Urchin, for you.
If your Web site is hosted on a dedicated server, you might need to have your
server administrator download and install this software for you.
Some hosting providers might be willing to install higher-end Web analytics
applications — that is, for a price. If you determine that you need something
more robust than what the free tools have to offer, check with your provider.
The selling points of server-side analytics
Although many industry analysts have predicted that hosted Web analytics
solutions offered by Application Service Providers (ASP) — a company that
hosts applications and charges a monthly fee — would overtake server-side
analytics, the latter still boasts a few selling points.
 Anywhere access: Server-side systems allow you to view your Web met-
rics from any computer. Client-side systems relegate you to the com-
puter your software is installed on. That means unless you have
server-side systems, you can’t check Web stats during your Hawaiian
vacation unless you pay an additional license fee to install it on another
computer.
63
Chapter 4: Web Analytics Tools You Can Use

 Fast access: Server-side applications automatically parse your Web
server log files at regularly scheduled intervals or sometimes on-
demand, as is the case with AWStats. Because your software is doing all
the work for you, you only need to log in to your analytics application to
see the results (see Figure 4-2).
 Free and clear: One of the most compelling selling points of server-side
analytics is the cost. Many of the most popular and robust server-side
analytics tools cost zero, zilch, nada . . . um, free.
 Reliability: Server-side application data is based on your server log
files. The Web server records each and every access, making the data
reliable and robust. Server-side solutions are often viewed as more reli-
able because the data is based on your server log files, which record
every file (pages, images, documents, and so on) that are accessed via
your Web sites. This is different from hosted applications, which rely on
a bit of code placed at the bottom of your Web pages to track visitor
activity. If the code is somehow removed or if the user leaves the page
before the code has time to load properly, visitor access might not be
tracked.
 Privacy issues: With server-side analytics, you don’t have to worry
about a competitor seeing your hidden treasure because the data is
stored in-house. This is often the biggest fear when it comes to using
tools like Google Analytics. For some Internet businesses, the idea that
Google will have access to their Web site data is unnerving.

Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

 Site failures: Server-side software offers insights into failed requests.
Client-side software will tell you only if the page is successfully viewed.
You can’t fix what you don’t know is broken.
 Spider activity: Server-side analytics offer critical information on search
engine spider visitations. These visits are not lumped in with human
activity: That is, they don’t count as unique visitors. This spider data is
key to search engine optimization (SEO) strategies. SEO is a method of
improving the rankings for relevant keywords in search results by
making changes to the content or navigational structure of a Web site.
 Standardized log files: Because the data is on your server, you can
easily switch from program to program as you see fit, or use multiple
programs that might offer slightly different features or data presenta-
tion. In other words, if you switch vendors, you won’t lose your data.
Server-side shortcomings exposed
Of course, server-side tools do have their shortcomings. Client-side and
hosted analytics solutions were developed to overcome some of them. Here
are some server-side downsides that you should be aware of before ruling
out other types of tools.
Server space shortages
Server-side analytics tools store lots of data on the Web server. If you have a
hosting plan with strict limitations on space usage, you might have to limit
the amount of historical data that you save on the server. Because viewing
your analytics in a historical context can be vital to your success, this is a
shortcoming that could make or break the deal.
Portability problems
If your Web site is on a shared hosting plan and you change hosting
providers, your log files and analytics data probably won’t move with you. If
you aren’t committed to your host, you might want to rely on a client-side or
hosted solution, both of which can move when you do.
Is there an administrator in the house?
Whether your Web site is on a shared or dedicated server, there is always a
chance that something will go wrong. Hard drives fail. Configurations get cor-
rupted. You might run out of space on your hosting account. Log files could
exceed their maximum defined file size. The possibilities are virtually endless.
65
Chapter 4: Web Analytics Tools You Can Use

Here’s a general rule: If something can go wrong, you should plan for it. That
means having a capable, responsive support staff at your hosting company,
or a server administrator for your dedicated server in case your hardware
stops tracking statistics for whatever reason. If you don’t have someone who
can respond in a hurry, you could face losing days or weeks of valuable ana-
lytics data — and corresponding opportunities.
Are server-side solutions right for me?
For many (if not most) small to medium Web site owners, server-side solu-
tions are the simplest way to start keeping track of Web site performance and
visitor activity. They come preinstalled and preconfigured, requiring little or
no setup. If you are looking for simple, easy-to-use analytics data that are
available at your beck and call but don’t cost anything when you don’t, free
server-side tools are probably going to suit your needs perfectly.
On the other hand, if your hosting company offers raw log files but doesn’t
offer analytics tools, you might want to consider purchasing a client-side (or
desktop) application to parse those log files for you. Additionally, if you think
you might be changing to a different hosting provider, consider opting for an
analytics solution that is completely independent of your hosting provider
and get set up with a hosted analytics application so you won’t have to worry
about switching analytics programs ever again (unless you want to).
Discovering Desktop Applications
Like many terms in the Web analytics world, the second type of site measure-
ment tools has various names. Some call it a desktop solution because, well,
you can access it from your desktop. Others call it client-side software because
the computer is known in technology circles as a client. Much the same as
server-side analytics, there are pros and cons to using client-side solutions.
Maintaining control with
client-side analytics
Client-side analytics have caught on with Web site owners for three good 
reasons:
 The application is installed on the user’s computer.
 The stored data can be presented with lightning speed.
 The analytics can be accessed even without an active Internet connection.
66
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

Client-side analytics also offer this added bonus: The software allows you to
keep original log files on your computer and store them independently of
Web hosts or hosted analytics providers.
All this adds up to a level of comfort and control for users who don’t have
complete access to their Web server. Additionally, this software provides the
data in a vehicle — namely, the desktop — that users are already comfortable
with for most of their everyday computing needs.
Long-term cost versus benefits
Any assessment of software must include a look a long-term cost versus ben-
efits. This is especially true when you look at handing over large sums of
cash up front to invest in a program. Although server-side analytics offers
strong data points to discern user behavior, more robust server-side solu-
tions can become costly and difficult to implement. This is because in the
server-side arena, the next step up from free is generally straight to the enter-
prise level. These tools can costs thousands of dollars to license and might
require an in-depth level of configuration that only experts are suited for.
Client-side applications (and hosted applications, too) do a fine job of filling a
void in the middle market, e-businesses that need more than what free tools
provide, but don’t have the money or need for costly enterprise solutions,
without breaking the bank. When you need more detail than your standard
server-side applications offer but you don’t feel the need to invest in the
enterprise-level software, your two choices are simple. You can pay $10–$50 a
month for a hosted solution, or you can purchase entry-level, client-side soft-
ware in the $100–$500 range.
When you’re looking at a long-term solution, it might make sense to pay the
one-time cost rather than commit to a long-term relationship with a hosted
analytics provider. Hosted providers store all the Web analytics data on their
servers. That means that if you cancel your account, you lose access to that
data — forever. Without this historical data, forecasting future seasonal or
product trends is more difficult. So when you’re comparing paid hosted
providers, total the rental expenses for a one-year, five-year, and ten-year
period. After viewing the costs in light of the big picture, you might decide
that purchasing a piece of software for $500 is cheaper than paying $39 per
month, after all.
Managing multiple domains
If you have more than one Web site, client-side Web analytics programs offer
a marked advantage over other options: the ability to manage multiple
domains. Keeping track of multiple domains with sever-side and hosted solu-
tions can be difficult. Instead of forcing you to view your precious stats in
several locations, client-side application gives you one central place to view
statistics for all your domains and save all your data. There is also a cost
67
Chapter 4: Web Analytics Tools You Can Use

factor to consider for the frugal data miner: If you’re using a paid hosted solu-
tion, the cost is usually assessed per domain. Those fees can add up in a
hurry when you’re managing scores of domains.
Client-side cons and desktop downsides
It’s been said that every pro has its con. After you filled up the plus side of
your comparison column, consider these desktop downsides.
The buck stops here
One of the first disadvantages to client-side applications is cost. Although
several free options are available in both the server-side and hosted cate-
gories, the control offered by client-side analysis comes at a price. Pricing for
entry-level desktop analysis tools falls within the $100–$200 range, and inter-
mediate tools cost around $250–$500.
Getting too big for your britches
Because client-side applications rely on server log files, you have no choice
but to download all those log files to your computer. When you have a Web
site that serves up tons of traffic, these log files tend to get very large, very
quickly. That can make downloading the files and then waiting while your
applications parses the files far too time-consuming to trouble with, espe-
cially when compared with server-side and hosted solutions. With the latter
two options, the parsing is accomplished behind the scenes.
All client-side software is not created equal. In fact, some client-side software
cannot parse extremely large log files and might just leave you stumbling
around in the dark on your search for hidden treasure. Entry-level applica-
tions might freeze or operate very slowly when presented with log files that
are over 100MB.
68
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 
Getting granular: Access log parsing
Client-side and server-side analytics tools rely
on raw access logs located on your server to
calculate your Web site traffic and visitor data.
Your Web server records every single file that is
accessed from your Web site, including images,
PDFs, Word documents, or other file types. This
data usually includes dates, times, referring
information, a record of pages viewed, informa-
tion about the user’s computer and network,
and more. Essentially, analytics applications
automatically parse the access logs and pre-
sent the information in easy-to-read bar charts
and relevant rates and percentages.

Keeping all your eggs in one basket
Because all the data gathered by client-side analytics applications is typically
saved to your local desktop computer, you have only one point of failure.
However, it’s a potentially devastating one. A corrupted or failed hard drive
could mean the losing months — or worse, years — of analytics data that can
never be recovered again even by the most sophisticated recovery programs.
Most hosted and server-side solutions are prepared for these types of night-
mare-inducing failures. They keep multiple backups, so even if something
happens to the data, it can be restored from a backup.
If you choose to use client-side software, save yourself some potential drama
by keeping regular backups of your files.
Are client-side solutions right for me?
Client-side solutions allow you to take a more active role in the nitty-gritty
Web analytics process. Simply put, you set up the domains, download the log
files, and choose your options in an environment that you’re already familiar
with: the desktop. Client-side solutions, though, are often more costly than
server-side solutions, so if you are just testing the waters, if your budget is
low to non-existent, or if you really need only some simple metrics to satisfy
your curiosity, client-side solutions might not be your best bet.
Hooked on Hosted Solutions
Offered by any one of many ASPs on the market, hosted analytics solutions
are the newest breed of analytics application. Hosted solutions are called such
because the data is stored on the ASP’s server instead of the shared server
provided by your Web host or the dedicated server in your offices. Hosted
solutions require you to log in to an ASP’s Web site in order to view and ana-
lyze your data.
Just like server-side and client-side, hosted solutions have plenty of pros and
cons that you need to understand before you can make an intelligent decision
about your intelligence-gathering tool of choice.
On-demand: Let the vendor do the work
Also called on-demand, hosted solutions are all the rage — and for good
reason: The Web analytics vendor does all the work. There’s no log file pars-
ing, downloading, installing, or maintenance. The vendor also gets to deal
69
Chapter 4: Web Analytics Tools You Can Use

with all the trouble shooting if something goes wrong. That means you don’t
need to know how to do anything except interpret the data. For more infor-
mation on how to interpret the data, read Chapter 8.
Keep your cash flow flowing
Hosted applications can also help regulate your cash flow. ASPs let you rent
the application for small monthly payments. Payments range from $15–$60 a
month for intermediate tools and $100–$250 a month for advanced tools.
Compare this with handing over a large, one-time fee to actually purchase the
software and call it your own. If your Web site is a revenue generator, you
may want to check with a qualified tax consultant to see if you can write off
the cost of the hosted tools on your taxes as an operating expense.
Anytime access
Similar to server-side tools, hosted analytics solutions don’t tie you down to
one-computer access. That means if you are the type who gets sudden
impulses to check your Web analytics on the fly, ASPs can usually accommo-
date you with Web-based reports that can be accessed anywhere there is an
Internet connection. (See Figure 4-3.)

Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

Individual page tagging
Client-side analytics have caught on with Web site owners because they cap-
ture data only for pages you want to track. That reduces the amount of data
you have to store or process and can make it easier for you to identify key
performance indicators (KPIs) when you are looking over your data. KPIs
illustrate how well the site is performing against goals.
One Web site, multiple servers
Occasionally, you might need your Web site to span multiple servers. Sounds
techie, we know. Here’s a practical example that will drive this important point
home. If you’re using a hosted third-party shopping cart solution, your server-
side analytics tools might not work. This is a common situation e-commerce
players who depend on server-side analytics find themselves in because
server-side solutions record traffic only from the server on which they are
installed. If you use a hosted solution, your Web site can span multiple servers
and combine the data from different servers into one complete report.
Hosted analytics pitfalls
Although hosted solutions seem to be the next frontier in Web analytics, they
are not without their faults. Review these common pitfalls before you take
the plunge.
To tag or not to tag?
One of the advantages of hosted solutions is that you have to tag only the
pages that you want to track. When you stop to think about that, though, the
disadvantages are obvious. If you don’t tag all the pages, you won’t get an
accurate clickstream. That means you can throw all the sermons about accu-
racy out the back door. If you have a simple site, tagging every page might
take a matter of minutes. If your site is content heavy, though, you could be
in for a major project.
Considering site architecture
Although adding a few lines of code onto a Web page isn’t complicated, making
sure that you tag every page to get the big clickstream picture can be a difficult
task on certain sites. In fact, depending on how your site is architected and
designed, tagging every page can be virtually impossible. If your site consists of
individual HTML pages, you (or your Web developer) would have to open each
page and add the code in the appropriate location for each page. Imagine the
task that becomes when you are looking at hundreds of thousands of pages!
71
Chapter 4: Web Analytics Tools You Can Use

No error page information
Unless error pages and redirect pages have JavaScript embedded in the tags,
you can’t track page-loading errors with hosted solutions. That means you
might not see the whole picture when it comes to broken pages or images on
your site. Error information is important because if your customers are trying
to read a thrilling article, make a purchase, or perform some other function
only to click to a broken page, they might get frustrated and not return.
Are you looking for a long-term relationship?
ASPs design hosted solutions for customers who are looking for long-term
relationships. Because of the time investment involved in adding the code to
your pages and because all your access information is stored on the ASP’s
server, hopping from provider to provider is not easy or advisable. If you’re
considering a paid hosted solution, don’t forget to weigh the long-term costs
of the relationship. In other words, do you want to keep paying the monthly
fees for this service in five years? Ten years?
Are hosted solutions right for me?
Hosted solutions might make the most financial sense when you consider the
big picture. When you “rent” a hosted analytics solution, you can leave your
problems at the vendor’s doorstep. You don’t have to worry about potentially
costly server administrator time if something goes wrong with your server-
side analytics. As we mention earlier — and it’s worth mentioning again —
the low monthly fees also save you from shelling out large sums of money to
purchase a desktop solution.
Don’t forget the tech-savvy warning: If you’d rather pull your hair out than
learn how to add code to your Web site, you’ll want to avoid hosted solutions
like the Avian flu. And if your organization requires a high level of privacy and
control, you might want to bring the task in house. Finally, don’t forget to
consider the long-term costs associated with the long-term commitment
associated with hosted providers.
Getting the Best of All Worlds
Serious Web analytics watchers might choose to use some combination of
the three available tool types to leverage synergies that could never be
achieved by a single tool alone. Remember, hosted solutions mean you don’t
have to keep log files. Client-side software allows you to track all your
domains with a single program. And server-side solutions are very conve-
nient and oftentimes free. Here we show you what you can do by combining
one or more of these tools in your search for statistical gold.
72
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

Leveraging synergies of multiple tool types
You’ve heard undoubtedly the phrase, “You scratch my back, and I’ll scratch
yours.” In other words, two people help one another. In the world of Web ana-
lytics, client-side and server-side Web analytics sort of scratch one another’s
backs. They make up for one another’s weaknesses when used to analyze the
same Web site.
Keeping track of downloads — such as PDF files, Microsoft Word documents,
music files, or some other type of download that your site offers — can be
difficult, if not impossible, with today’s hosted analytics solutions. Instead of
missing out on this valuable information, just revert to your sever-side solu-
tion, which offers flawless tracking of downloads because the Web server
logs every file request individually. Are you getting the picture?
If you regularly check your server-side tools for overall traffic patterns but
you’re limited by poor visitor segmentation, try supplementing your server-
side data with a client-side tool, such as ClickTracks Analyzer (www.click-
tracks.com). Leveraging the benefits of multiple tools could give you
insights that are otherwise only available in much more expensive solutions.
Getting a little creative can save you money and help you cover all your ana-
lytics bases.
Why you might want to use 
multiple vendors
Just as you might choose to use more than one tool, you might also choose to
use more than one vendor. Think of laundry detergents: They all have their
proprietary benefits. Cold water soap is extra gentle on clothing, whereas
Brand A is extra tough on stains. Others offer color-safe bleach or extra whiten-
ing power. It’s a value-add that distinguishes one brand of soap from another.
It’s the same in the Web analytics market. Each vendor certainly offers baseline
benefits, but some have developed proprietary algorithms, visitor segmenta-
tion methods, or special graphical presentations that might interest you.
Sure, it’s a pity to have to use three services to get all the features and func-
tions you need, but it’s not much different than buying pre-stain remover,
extra-strength detergent, softener, and wrinkle-remover for your laundry. It’s a
“whatever it takes to get the job done” mentality that, well, gets the job done.
If all of this has your head spinning, don’t worry. Table 4-1 breaks it down for
you in black and white. A quick glance will offer you a checklist of sorts of the
benefits of server-side, client-side, and hosted solutions.

Chapter 5
Investing in Web Analytics Tools
In This Chapter
 Giving the freebies a fair chance
 Making the most of low-cost solutions
 Getting serious about your analytics investment
 Reviewing vendor pricing models
W
hen it comes to word processors, choosing software is relatively sim-
plistic. (A software giant in Redmond, Washington, has made sure of
that.) Stepping into the world of Web analytics tools, though, is like venturing
into your local big-box home improvement center. Walk down the power tools
aisle, and you’ll find cordless drills, compact drills, variable speed drills, drill
combos, and a host of other borers for your consideration — large drills,
small drills, red drills, yellow drills . . . . You get the picture.
In addition to the three key categories of Web analytics software — namely,
client-side, server-side, and hosted — you’ll also find a world of difference in
the functions, capabilities, and (of course) price ranges for these data mining
applications. (Server-side analytics tools are software installed on the Web
site’s server. Client-side tools are installed on your computer. And hosted 
solutions are hosted by a service provider on its server. Read more about 
all these categories in Chapter 4.)
Thus, before you invest your time and energy when purchasing a Web analyt-
ics tool, learning its distinct terminology, and benchmarking your data based
on its initial assessment of your Web site, you need to know exactly what
you’re getting into. Most Web analytics vendors — and there are enough of
them to make your head spin — offer a free trial before forcing you to fork
over the dough.
So which one do you choose? That depends on your specific needs: the size
of your company, how much traffic your site gets, and how much you want to
spend. What is certain is this: You need the tools if you want to monitor con-
version rates, learn how user groups interact with your Web site, discover
where visitors are coming from and what they are looking for, and many
other metrics that could help you improve your success online.

So take a hint from the savvy home improvement guru who visits the big-box
store looking for that new drill. Rather than getting intimidated by shelf after
shelf of choices, get excited by the possibility of choosing from the one shelf
that offers several models to fit your specific needs. In this chapter, we’ll help
you narrow the choosing field so you can spend your time drilling through
data rather than selecting the drill.
Before You Begin
You wouldn’t rush into a marriage, so don’t rush into a commitment with a
Web analytics vendor. Take your time to compare apples with apples, so to
speak, and measurements with measurements. Because being able to review
historical data is immensely important and because vendor hopping can
erase that history in a heartbeat, you want to be sure that the vendor you
choose has the features, functions, and technologies to serve your needs for
the long term.
You can’t possibly know whether a vendor has what you need until you know
what you need. The best way to do that is to start with a free tool and get
familiar with the baseline measurements. Quite possibly, a freebie tool has
everything you need and more. If it doesn’t, you can quickly figure out what
you’re missing. While you are monitoring your Web analytics reports for
trends, take some time to review the for-fee offerings on the market to dis-
cover what you might not even know that you’re missing. You’ll be surprised
at what Web analytics can tell you about your site. Really surprised.
Plan to take several months to choose your Web analytics vendor. If you’re
looking at free or low-cost solutions, ferret out which software meets your
business requirements and gels with the technical specifications of your site.
That may mean reviewing vendor Web sites or even picking up the phone and
calling a vendor. And if you’re looking at an enterprise solution, the vendor
might work up a proposal to win your business. Either way, put on your
investigator’s cap and check out the vendor’s history, stability, track record
for innovation, implementation and support offerings, contract terms and (of
course) pricing. Always ask for client referrals, and don’t jump on the low-
price bandwagon just to save a few dollars. Inaccurate results could cost you
well more than a few dollars in the long run.
Don’t Forget the Freebies
Before you invest a single penny in Web analytics, consider taking some of
the free programs for a test drive? You might find that these tools give you a
nice view of the landscape.
76
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

The advantage of free tools is clear: They are free. And plenty of free tools are
out there for the installing. The downside, though, can be dark:
 Not as full-featured: Free tools don’t pack the same informational punch
as paid tools.
 Not as much support: Free tools don’t usually offer any support, either.
That means you are on your own in a sea of data. No one is there to hold
your hand, explain a metric, or help you interpret the findings. (Of
course, that’s what you have this book for.)
Still, you should at least give the freebies a try. Who knows? You might catch
on quick and begin leveraging the tool for more profits from Day One.
Before you can begin using the free tools, you need to know where to find
them. And as you begin to use them, you should go in knowing what to
expect — and what not to expect — or you could wind up frustrated. You
wouldn’t expect a Hyundai to perform the same way a Jaguar does. Much the
same, you can’t expect a free tool to perform the same way an enterprise tool
does. What you can expect from a free tool (and a Hyundai) is to get you on
the road so you can see some pretty views.
What to expect from free analytics tools
Free tools often have very simple user interfaces that any beginner can learn
quickly. For example, Google Analytics essentially presents a more friendly
and simplified version of Urchin for mass consumption. Google states on its
site that it believes “Web analytics should be simple and sophisticated at the
same time.” (Sort of like this book!)
At the entry level, you get quite a bit of mileage from your analytics dollar.
Free Google Analytics is a massive temptation for marketers who see the pos-
sibility of putting budgets currently assigned to tool sets into the advertising
market. You can expect a wide spectrum of functions and feature sets among
the free tools; at the baseline, though, they all show you metrics, such as hits,
pageviews, unique visitors, time on site, and the like.
What not to expect from the freebies
Free tools are great solutions for low-to-moderate traffic sites. When a site
grows to higher volumes, though, the solutions might no longer prove effec-
tive for anything other than a quick scan of basic metrics. And basic metrics
are about all you get with most of the free analytics tools. If you want to
engage in complex visitor profiling or ad campaign tracking, don’t expect to
find that in your freebie tools. Also don’t expect to get any type of customer
support with most of these tools.
77
Chapter 5: Investing in Web Analytics Tools

Don’t expect to find cutting-edge innovation, either. Sure, some of the 
programs are open source, meaning that developers from all over the world
can contribute to the programming to make improvements to the program.
Without large development budgets, though, it’s unlikely that free Web ana-
lytics programs will match costly enterprise-level analytics features and func-
tionality any time soon. Meanwhile, the more expensive solutions just keep
getting better.
Although every Web analytics vendor has its own terminology, proprietary
tools, and benefits, here is a common denominator among them: They all
measure visitor behavior:
 How visitors find your site
 What visitors do when they get there
 How long visitors stay
 Other insightful actions, such as the keywords they typed into search
engines to find your site and other sites that referred visitors your way
Be sure to take Web analytics vendors up on their free trial offers and take
the software for a test drive before you lay out any cash.
Finding free analytics tools
If you already have a Web site, your likely host offers some sort of free tool
on the back end. Read Chapter 3 for step-by-step instructions on how to
access your Web analytics tools, take a sneak peak at the data, and start 
setting some benchmarks.
If your Web host doesn’t offer any analytics or if you just want to explore 
the free landscape, your task is easy. Just go to your search engine of choice
and type in “free Web analytics”. You’ll get a number of results to get you
started. Here are a few, however, that have achieved a solid reputation in the
freebie market.
Analog
http://analog.cx
Analog (see Figure 5-1) bills itself as the most popular logfile analyzer in 
the world. (Logfiles are data files that record transactions that occurred 
on the Web server.) You can learn more about logfiles in Chapter 15. We’re
not sure about that, but it does offer several advantages. It’s scalable, highly
configurable — and free. It works on any operating system, and it reports in
32 languages. This free tool offers free support or commercial support. It’s
very easy to read and offers a quick round up of overall statistics. This soft-
ware works with any operating system and any browser.
78
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

Downside: However, because this is a server-side application, you need root
access to your Web server, or you need to ask your hosting company to
install this for you.
AWStats
www.awstats.org
AWStats (see Figure 5-2) generates some fairly robust analytics for a free tool.
It analyzes Web, streaming, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), or mail server statis-
tics graphically. It can also analyze logfiles from all major server tools. This
open source tool is very easy to read and offers a quick round up of overall
statistics. You can even get info on worm attacks with this software. This free
tool works with any operating system or browser.
Downside: Because this is a server-side application, you need root access 
to your Web server, or you need to ask your hosting company to install this
for you.
ClickTracks Appetizer
http://clicktracks.com/products/appetizer/
ClickTracks Appetizer (see Figure 5-3) includes several of ClickTracks’ most
popular features:

 Overlay view
 Path view
 Page analysis
 Basic visitor labeling; tagging visitors based on their use of search

 Search referrals
 Returning visitors
The software is flexible and allows you to select and label visitors who meet
criteria important to you. It offers all the usual metrics and more and helps
you make comparisons that lead to conversions.
Downside: However, the tool works only with Windows; if you run Mac OS X
or Linux, you are out of luck.
ClickTracks also makes for-fee tools that you could upgrade to if you like this
vendor’s platform. This software is installed directly on your computer and
does not utilize your browser.

Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

Google Analytics
www.google.com/analytics
Google’s motive with its free analytics tool is to tell you everything you want
to know about how visitors found your site and how they interact with it so
that you can focus your marketing resources on campaigns and initiatives
that deliver a return on your investment. Wow. That’s a mouthful!
In short, Google wants to give you a free tool (see Figure 5-4) in hopes 
you’ll spend more on Adwords. If you are a Google Adwords buyer, Google
Analytics might be a good choice because it is integrated with the pay per
click (PPC) platform. Also called paid search, this method retrieves listings
based on who paid the most money for keywords to appear at the top of the
heap. Of course, it also tracks non-Adwords initiatives.
Downside: Google Analytics only updates statistics one time in a 24-hour
period. That means you can’t get up-to-the-minute stats on a campaign you
are running. If that’s an important feature, you’ll have to choose another tool
or use another tool to supplement Google Analytics.

Chapter 5: Investing in Web Analytics Tools

OneStatFree
www.onestatfree.com
OneStatFree (see Figure 5-5) offers free hit counters and Web analytics tools
as well as paid options. You can see all the usual key performance indicators
(KPIs). KPIs illustrate how well the site is performing against goals. You can
read much more about KPIs in Chapter 11.
What’s unique about this tool is that you can see how your site performs
compared with other Web sites in the same category or same country, based
on the number of pageviews (a record of each time a visitor views a Web page
on your site). The vendor claims that inclusion in its charts listings boosts
traffic to your Web site. This tool works with any platform or any browser.
Downside: The tradeoff is that you have to display a counter/tracker icon on
your Web site.

CrazyEgg
www.crazyegg.com
CrazyEgg does what no other reputable free tool can claim: visitor visualiza-
tion. First, CrazyEgg offers a heat map. Sort of like an infrared camera, this
software literally shows you what’s hot on your Web site with red, orange,
and blue areas imposed over your site. (See Figure 5-6.) CrazyEgg also has
overlays that show buttons containing information on each element of your
site, such as how many clicks it received. You can track up to 5,000 visitors
per month for free. Or, you can spend $25 per month to track up to 25,000 vis-
itors or $99 per month for up to 250,000 visitors. This is a hosted solution, so
there’s no software to install. This tool works with any platform or browser.
Downside: The only potential downsides for Crazy Egg is that you have to
paste one line of code to the bottom of each Web page you want to visualize,
which can be tedious. Also, by its visual nature, you don’t get the depth or
breadth of reports you might with traditional freebie tools. What’s more, free
accounts are only updated every few hours.
These are just a few of the many free tools out there. If you want a quick 
hit on a few more, check out the Cheat Sheet in the front of the book for 
our recommendations.

Low-Cost Solutions, High-End Returns
Free Web analytics solutions are great, but they will take you only so 
far on your journey to increasing online profits. If you are serious about 
generating income with your Web site, you probably need to consider 
using a low-cost solution at some point to calculate metrics that the 
freebie tools won’t even list. The next step on the ladder is an entry-
level package. Inexpensive tools such as Unica NetTracker, VisiStat,
ClickTracks, nextStat, and IndexTools offer some valuable capabilities 
at lower price points.
You can subscribe to entry-level hosted solutions for $60 per month 
or even less. (Some are as little as $15 per month.) For this price, you 
have more control over the metrics you measure because you can 
customize the dashboard and use filtering technologies. You can set 
permissions so that certain users can only see certain data. Some even 
offer live reporting capabilities. Finally, you get customer support that 
is often lacking in free tools.

Valuable capabilities for the 
value-conscious consumers
When you outgrow the freebie tools but can’t quite justify spending a fortune
on Web analytics at this stage in your business game, don’t despair. Plenty of
affordable solutions with valuable capabilities are available for value-conscious
customers like you. Most low-cost vendors do everything that the freebie tools
do and more. At this level, your analytics applications are capable of advanced
visitor profiling, high-level ad campaign tracking, and in-depth click fraud
detection. Unless you are a Fortune 1000 company, these low-cost tools will
likely offer you everything you need to drive value from your measurements.
Getting acquainted with low-cost vendors
No two entry-level Web analytics tools are alike. Some refresh their statistics
only a few times a day, and others offer near real-time tracking. Still others
allow you to click an Update Now tool when you want the latest stats.
Too, you’ll find that some entry-level tools are extremely user-friendly while
others are quite complicated. Usually, the more complicated tools pack more
metrics into the analysis. Low-cost vendors target small- to mid-sized busi-
nesses. Here are a few of the most popular choices to give you an idea of
what to expect.
Unica NetTracker
http://unica.com
Unica NetTracker (see Figure 5-7) is designed to help you optimize your 
Web programs, such as PPC advertising, e-mail campaigns, search engine
optimization, and affiliate marketing. It also targets intranet owners who 
want to measure the effectiveness of their online knowledgebase and 
community. NetTracker lets you slice and dice the data in a variety of ways 
to make important comparisons. You can see clickstream paths, online prod-
uct interests, Web trends, visitor conversion patterns, and Web content qual-
ity and visitor retention rates, among other metrics. You can use page tags,
logfiles, or a hybrid of both. (Page tags are snippets of code that need to be
inserted in your Web pages in order for many hosted applications to gather
your data.)
85
Chapter 5: Investing in Web Analytics Tools

VisiStat
www.visistat.com
VisiStat (see Figure 5-8) offers an attractive competitive advantage: live report-
ing. That means you can see live site visitors, what pages they are viewing,
and how they navigate through the site while these events happen. You can
also chart pay per click results, track demographic interests, or focus market-
ing by location. This program helps you identify areas of interest on your site
so you can distribute important content to high traffic pages and identify navi-
gational errors. It also offers a laundry list of technical stats, such as report
resolution and color depth. You can get this solution for as little as $19.99 per
month. This tool works with any operating system or browser.
ClickTracks
www.clicktracks.com
ClickTracks (see Figure 5-9) offers free tools, enterprise tools, and entry-level
tools. At the entry level, this vendor offers its Analyzer. This program offers 
visitor labeling and actually superimposes the data on your Web site so you can
see and understand visitor behavior firsthand rather than using charts and pie
graphs, rows of numbers, and percentages. You can even select “goal” pages that
help you identify which pages lead to conversions. You can get this solution for
as little as $25 per month. This tool works with any operating system or browser.

nextStat
www.nextstat.com
nextStat (see Figure 5-10) is one of the easiest to use among the entry-level
tools, but it’s also among the least sophisticated. You won’t find the level of
in-depth analysis with this tool that others in its class have to offer. You can
create some solid reports, though. For example, you might choose to see all
visitors who browsed a minimum of six pages on the site and then responded
to the call to action. This tool also offers the unique feature of being able to
click an icon next to each page to see a display of the path analysis for visi-
tors on that page. If it’s ease of use you are after, this might be the perfect
tool for you. You’ll pay more than you do for the others, though, at $59.95 
per month. This tool works with any operating system or browser.
Downside: NextStat will only track pages that you tag.
IndexTools
www.indextools.com
IndexTools (see Figure 5-11) offers real-time reporting and a user-friendly
interface. You can customize your dashboard for quick access to the reports
you need in a hurry. This tool offers some interesting segmentations. If you
have a sale on toothpaste in June, for example, you can set goals and quickly
determine whether you met your objectives. You can also get an instant snap-
shot of whether a visitor made a purchase and how much he spent. The pro-
gram offers a variety of filters that allow you to drill down into visitor
segments that interest you the most. You’ll pay $49.95 per month for this pro-
gram, with the option of adding a host of plug-ins for another $30 per month.
This tool works with any operating system or browser.

Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 
Reviewing vendor pricing models
As the Web analytics space gets more compet-
itive, that trend translates into better deals for
Web site operators. One key factor to look at is
vendors’ pricing models. Some charge a flat fee,
and the software is yours to keep. Others
charge a flat fee per month. Still others charge
according to the number of pageviews that your
site registers. Those upfront fees might be only
part of the equation, though. You should also ask
the vendor whether it makes its money on
pageview volume, maintenance and upgrade
fees, or add-ons. Judge that cost against your
business needs today as well as what you are
likely to need in the future. Sometimes the
upfront cost can look great, but getting what
you really need over time can become very
costly if you don’t choose wisely from the
outset.

HitBox Professional
www.websidestory.com
WebSideStory offers an attractive entry-level tool called HitBox Professional
(see Figure 5-12). It’s aimed toward small- to mid-sized businesses that want to
optimize their Web sites, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize online
marketing. This is a solid program. It does a lot of the necessary comparisons
for you, such as comparing search engine traffic counts and identifying top
performing promotions. This can help you focus your resources where the
returns are. You can also see what pages your customers looked at — and in
what order — so you can identify compelling content and increase visitor sat-
isfaction. This is a bottom-line tool that only costs $34.95 per month. This tool
works with any operating system or browser.
MetriServe
www.metriserve.com
MetriServe (see Figure 5-13) offers up-to-the minute Web analytics with no
logfiles or servers. The firm collects Web metrics directly from the visitor’s
browser and stores them on its servers. More than 50 real-time reports are
provided in MetriServe’s online reporting tools, which are searchable and
customizable over any date range. You can also export reports as PDF files or
as raw data. This program helps you find hidden patterns in how visitors use
your Web site as it aims to uncover relationships between pages on your site
that you wouldn’t otherwise know existed. This is a European vendor that
charges by pageviews. It costs about $18 per month for 10,000 pageviews or
$600 for 10 million pageviews. This tool works with any operating system 
or browser.
ecommStats
www.ecommstats.com
This program (see Figure 5-14) is heavy into tracking conversions and what
caused those conversions. You can quickly see your return on investment
(ROI) for your spending on search engine advertising and analyze how your
visitors navigate through your site. And as a nice bonus, you can manage an
unlimited number of Web sites from a single account. As its name suggests,
this Web analytics program is targeted to folks who sell widgets on their site,
with features, such as revenue generated by referrer. The program is Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) compatible, so you don’t have to worry about techie
issues associated with tracking e-commerce sites. ecommStats charges by
pageviews. You can choose a plan that runs $25 for 50,000 pageviews up to
200,000 pageviews for $85, with special pricing for higher volumes.

Enterprise Analytics for the Data Hungry
If you have an insatiable appetite for Web metrics — and a real need for deep
insights — enterprise-level products might be the only software that will make
you content. Enterprise-level tools do everything the freebies and mid-level
applications do — and much more. Because they target larger companies,
enterprise-level tools are heavily focused on metrics that demonstrate ROI.
Often, these sophisticated vendors offer specialized packages for marketing,
commerce, or some other special need. Enterprise-level products are critical
in developing custom reports that lighter versions of this software typically
can’t accommodate. These programs allow you to get details on unique users
at a deeper level, which is particularly important in higher price-point sales
or higher lifetime value situations in which you might have fewer shoppers
and need to make the most of every visit.
The more sophisticated your business, the more sophisticated the 
software needs.

Enterprise solutions are not for companies with shallow pockets. The price
tags on these powerful solutions start around $15,000 per year. With such a
hefty investment in analytics, many businesses that operate at this level have
one person dedicated to analyzing and parsing all this data. Such analysis
can get pretty complex, and training someone who is uninitiated can be a
costly proposition. The future will likely see Chief Analytics Officers and
Directors of Web Analytics who have a prominent position and considerable
salaries.
If you want to run with the big dogs, you’ll want to take a look at vendors
such as WebTrends, Omniture, WebSideStory, and Coremetrics. These solu-
tions all have their proprietary bells and whistles, but generally speaking,
they tell you more about your visitors than entry-level and midrange solu-
tions ever could. They also have some interesting features. Here are a few
standouts from some of the leading enterprise vendors.
WebTrends Web Analytics 8
www.webtrends.com
This software (see Figure 5-15) lets you benchmark KPIs and explore what-if
scenarios to identify where to focus your budgets. It gives you a complete
view into which campaigns are successful and which aren’t, from e-mail and
online advertising to affiliate and partner programs. You can monitor search
engine optimization and PPC results, drill down into your Web site stats by
search engine and phrase, and integrate your PPC cost data with your Web
site stats for a complete marketing ROI breakdown. You can even optimize
conversion rates for each page, path, and conversion scenario.
93
Chapter 5: Investing in Web Analytics Tools
Creating customized reports
No two businesses are alike. That’s why enter-
prise-level tools offer customizable reports,
which combat information overload and offer
quick insights into enhancing online revenue
opportunities. You can tailor these reports to your
specific online business objectives that are most
relevant to your bottom line. You can find out what
the marketing ROI of your marketing initiatives is,
what visitor segments are likely to convert into
customers; where the bottlenecks are in your
purchase path; what content, products and ser-
vices visitors prefer; and much more. WebTrends’
custom report engine is both flexible and
advanced, allowing you to measure users across
a buy cycle, and then deduce and update their
status accurately. WebSideStory’s HBX lets you
integrate external cost data. Coremetrics has a
strong focus on merchandising as well as lifetime
profiling. These powerful analytics engines allow
you to blend elements that are most important to
you with just a few clicks.

Omniture Site Catalyst 13
www.omniture.com
This program (see Figure 5-16) includes Web 2.0 Business Optimizations for
Web site owners struggling to measure this new technology. Web 2.0 is part of
the ongoing transition of the World Wide Web from a collection of Web sites
to a comprehensive computing platform that serves up Web applications to
end users. Some believe that Web 2.0 will eventually replace desktop applica-
tions. Omniture is on the cutting edge with its software, which offers the stan-
dard enterprise-level analytics. In addition, you can find special measurement
tools for social networking sites, blogs, rich Internet applications, dynamic
site search, and visitor interaction profiling.
WebSideStory HBX
www.websidestory.com
HBX (see Figure 5-17) is a powerful tool that offers features such as Web site
navigation analysis, robust e-commerce analysis, campaign analytics, and
custom reports in executive dashboards. However, this program also offers
Figure 5-15:
WebTrends

some over-the-top functions, such as internal search tracking, detailed con-
tent analysis, and an active segmentation model that lets you combine any
number of visitor session characteristics in order to create segments on the
fly. Cross-channel integration is another interesting feature, correlating Web
site behavior with offline sales conversions through technology integration
with Salesforce.com.
Coremetrics Online Analytics
www.coremetrics.com
Coremetrics Online Analytics (see Figure 5-18) aims to serve as a single
resource for planning, measuring, and testing integrated marketing efforts.
The vendor brags about its visualization tools and targeted business solu-
tions that allow you to uncover value and take action. Coremetrics offers an
interesting feature — LIVE Profiles — that delivers information on actual cus-
tomer behaviors. This vendor takes a cross-channel approach that incorpo-
rates offline and call center activities with Web stats. The software also
enables profile mining to allow you to maximize lifetime customer value by
identifying high-value visitors and understanding product affinities.

eb analytics tools used to be one-size-fits-all, relatively speaking. In
other words, you wouldn’t find much difference between what each
vendor could measure. From the genesis of Web analytics — when Web coun-
ters tracked nothing more than how many eyeballs viewed your home page —
the market is beginning to see waves of niche products designed to track
everything from blogs (or Weblog; a frequently updated online journal, usually
for public viewing) to Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feeds (a new way to dis-
tribute content over the Internet) to industry-specific metrics.
Indeed, Web analytics was once described as a niche industry with mass
market products. Now, it’s becoming just the opposite: a mass market indus-
try with niche products. Indeed, because no two companies — or no two Web
sites — are alike, Web analytics has matured to offer niche products that fill
needs that have emerged as the Internet has matured.
If you’re wondering whether you can’t just analyze all this information with a
regular Web analytics program, the short answer is simple: sure. The better
answer is that you can certainly measure some of it. However, these special
tools zero in on metrics that intend to help you make the most of your niche,
typically offering some takes that you can’t get with mass market analytics.
Read on to discover what you can do with some of these targeted tools. You’ll
find that many of these niche analytics programs offer similar feature sets. 
As you review them, consider your budget, which operating systems the soft-
ware works with, and the features that are most important to you. If you need
help understanding what might be important to you, read Chapter 11 for
insights on key performance indicators.

Web Analytics: A Boon for Bloggers
According to Technorati (a recognized authority on tracking a monitoring
blog usage), about 63.2 million blogs were up and running in 2006. Of course,
not all bloggers attempt to generate income through leads, advertising, or
affiliate marketing, but many do — enough, indeed, for Web analytics vendors
to develop tools targeted at this group of diverse self-publishers. Bloggers
range from the casual (diarists, families blogging together, teens blogging 
in social networks) to topical bloggers (commenting on daily news events 
in various categories) to technology, political, and self-promoting bloggers
(such as attorneys and other service firms hoping to generate leads by 
positioning themselves as experts).
Blog analytics developers have an advantage: They don’t typically need to
worry about tracking e-commerce functions. Their goal is to keep a pulse 
on who is reading what, how often, and when. What’s different about blog
analytics is that they keep things simple and talk in terms that bloggers
understand. Instead of looking at a Most Requested Pages report, you can
simply review your Top Posts. Many of these applications also have ways 
to track comments and RSS feeds, both of which are options that aren’t 
regularly available in mainstream analytics applications.
The blogger who wants to build readership — say, to build credibility for a
consultant or other professional attempting to establish expert status in a
field — might choose to take the golden nuggets of information the analytics
yield and guide the subject matter of his posts. Bloggers could also use the
tools to validate traffic statistics in order to turn the heads of potential 
advertisers or to track links to see who sends traffic.
Here are a few solid tools you can use as well as some good news: Most blog
analytics tools are easy to install. Specific instructions for your platform of
choice are offered.
Mint
www.haveamint.com
As the first widely known analytics application-targeting bloggers, Mint (see
Figure 6-1) took a fresh approach to measurement. This tool is also popular
because it blocks referrer spam and comment spam, which is a major battle
for bloggers. For a one time flat-fee of $30, you can license this analytics tool
that breaks down site referrers by newest unique, most recent, and repeat
referrers from a customizable time frame. You can also measure visits,
browsers, and platforms; find search terms in popular search engines; and
illuminate your most popular pages and most recently accessed content. You
can even bookmark or watch individual pages.
98
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

Mint may not run on your server, though. It has been developed and beta
tested on various Linux servers running Apache with a MySQL database (3.x
and up), and PHP scripting (4.2.3 and up). You should check with your host if
you aren’t sure about those requirements. The developer offers a compatibil-
ity test that you can take to find out in a flash.
In order to view Mint, you need a modern browser. Mint recommends Safari
or Firefox and only has partial support for Internet Explorer (IE). IE for Mac is
not supported at all. In order to record hits, be sure to enable JavaScript on
your browser of choice.
Measure Map
www.measuremap.com
Measure Map (acquired by Google in February 2006) helps you understand
what people do at your blog, how many readers you influence on your virtual
soapbox, and how many people respond to your pontifications. Measure Map
(see Figure 6-2) presents the information in a compelling way. It not only tells
you not how many visitors you had today, but it also immediately tells you,
“That’s 15 more than you had on an average day.” It offers up the same quick
assessment for links, comments, and posts. In essence, it does the heavy ana-
lytical lifting for you with this snapshot.

Bloglet
www.bloglet.com
Bloglet (see Figure 6-3) offers an e-mail subscription service for your blog.
The goal is to keep readers coming back by keeping them up to date on
recent posts to their favorite blogs. Bloglet offers daily stats on total new 
subscribers, so you can watch your audience grow. You can also receive 
stats on how many sites link to you as well as a list of the Top 10, as tabu-
lated by Google. This is a free tool, but unfortunately, it works only with
Blogger or Moveable Type, which are two popular, free blog hosts.
Technorati
www.technorati.com
Technorati is recognized as the authority on what’s happening on the 
Web. As of the time of this writing, the firm tracks 63.2 million blogs — and
Figure 6-2:

counting. Technorati searches, surfaces, and organizes blogs and other forms
of independent, user-generated content. Technorati takes a bit of a different
approach to analytics. It doesn’t provide you with navigational paths; rather,
it offers your ranking in
 the blogosphere
 the number of links pointing to your blog in the last 
180 days
 the number of distinct blogs pointing to your blog in the 
last 180 days
 the total number of links it found pointing to your blog
This is a good way to compare your blog with the rest of the blogs in the 
blogosphere. However, you first have to “claim” your blog. Just visit www.
technorati.com, scroll down to the bottom left of the page, and click 
Claim Your Blog. You’ll be in the system in no time.

103bees.com
www.103bees.com
103bees.com (see Figure 6-4) isn’t a hive of stinging creatures: It’s a free, 
real-time online tool for Webmasters and bloggers that is highly focused 
on natural search engine traffic analysis. It offers tons of detailed statistics
and in-depth information on search terms that drive visitors to your blog. 
If you want to search engine optimize your blog, this is the tool for you. If 
you want to measure your Internet marketing initiatives, this tool is right up
your alley — and it’s free. 103bees.com helps you discover the long tail — 
all the keyword combinations that work for your Web pages. This is valuable
because you can unlock hiding opportunities beyond the Top 10, such as 
new blogging content ideas that attract readers. Instead of paying for ads,
you can merely mine your long tail of search and use those keywords to 
drive more traffic.

Read All about It: RSS Analytics
RSS (Really Simply Syndication) is just that: a simple way to syndicate content
online. It’s a content delivery channel for publishers and bloggers who want
to push their words out to the masses rather than waiting for the readers to
come to them. According to Nielsen/NetRatings, RSS is riding on the blogging
phenomenon to a large extent, but major online newspapers and magazines
are also coming aboard. Research firms predict dramatic growth in RSS, and
literally millions of feeds already exist.
RSS offers benefits to the reader and the sender. For the reader, RSS keeps the
e-mail box free of newsletters. For the sender, RSS can boost search engine
rankings. Your Web site link will show up on many RSS readers and increase
your link popularity, which is one of the factors that search engines consider
when determining your ranking. Setting up an RSS feed is easy, but the chal-
lenge is similar to blogging in that you have to continually provide new con-
tent. That’s why RSS and blogs are often tied together. Bloggers use the tool
as a way to let readers subscribe and pull the content in.
Like blogs and podcasts, RSS offers advertising opportunities. We’re talking
multiplied millions of dollars of ads getting pushed out to content readers
through RSS feeder advertising networks, such as FeedBurner and Pheedo.
103
Chapter 6: Discovering Niche Solutions
Battling blog spam
Blog spam, also called comment spam, is much
like its annoying e-mail counterpart. These are
unsolicited messages that usually advertise
something that nobody wants. These bogus
commenters aren’t adding value to your blog.
Instead, they attempt to use your blog to pro-
mote their products and services. These leeches
know that if they can use comments, pings, or
trackbacks to get a link from your blog, it will
boost their search engine ratings. (A trackback
is an automated comment that is added to one
blog when another blog references it.) You can’t
complain to the perpetrator because you proba-
bly can’t find him. It probably wouldn’t do a bit of
good, anyway. No, you’ve got to put on your
combat gear and battle back.
Blogger (www.blogger.com) has an inter-
esting approach to this. The Google property
requires the poster to solve a captcha puzzle
before posting. Captcha is an acronym for
Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell
Computers and Humans Apart. You’ve probably
seen one before. It sort of distorts the letters so
they look like a reflection in one of those mirrors
you find at the county fair. The poster has to type
in what the letters say. This verifies that a
human being, rather than a spambot, is on the
other side of the connection because computer
programs can’t read captchas. Alternatively,
you can use a spam filter that comes with your
blog. WordPress (www.wordpress.org)
uses a program called Akismet to catch spam
automatically. Or, you can choose to manually
approve each comment, but that can be a pain
to maintain, especially if your blog is getting a
lot of comments, for good or bad.

RSS ad spending is projected to reach $129.6 million by 2010, according to PQ
Media. Wherever ad money funnels in, is a need for measurement tools. The
promise of RSS riches, then, has spawned some niche analytics tools designed
specifically to measure the impact of these feeds. These tools allow you to
measure RSS specific metrics like the number of subscribers, clickthroughs
from feeds, RSS usage patterns, and site usage patterns for RSS traffic.
FeedBurner
www.feedburner.com/fb/a/home
A testimony to the growth of blog analytics, Nielsen//NetRatings reports that
FeedBurner (see Figure 6-5) is growing faster than Web 2.0 champions MySpace,
a free online social networking community, and Digg, a user-driven content 
Web site. FeedBurner, a feed management provider, offers Web-based services
designed to help bloggers, podcasters, and commercial publishers promote,
deliver, and profit from their content on the Web. FeedBurner also offers the
largest advertising network for feeds that brings together content aggregated
from leading media companies, A-list bloggers (influential bloggers, with many
other bloggers and Web sites linking to their blogs), blog networks, and individ-
ual publishers.
Figure 6-5:

104
Part II: Choosing the Right Web Analytics Solution 

With so much content flying around, FeedBurner has made heavy invest-
ments in analytics to capture subscriber statistics. Designed for the serious
content producer, FeedBurner offers core statistics with detailed visibility
into specific item statistics as well as an easy user interface. FeedBurner’s
StandardStats — its free service — leverages the critical mass of feed readers,
bots, search engines, news filters, and other common feed sources. You can
find out where your content is referenced as well as measure how many sub-
scribers versus nonsubscribers access your productions. It even tracks the
number of downloads of rich media files, such as audio and video podcasts.
TotalStats, the FeedBurner premium service, tells bloggers what percentage 
of the total subscriber base is actively reading and clicking individual items
within a feed. Like newspapers and magazines, a certain percentage of read-
ers subscribe while a certain percentage actively open and act on content.
The Reach metric offers insight into the second group. TotalStats also offers
Item Popularity stats, which offers a more thorough drill-down through the
popularity of individual items in a feed. This gives you insights about specific
posts on specific days as well as a history of activity.
FeedFoundry
http://www.feedburner.com/fb/a/publishers/feedfoundry
For larger publishers, FeedBurner offers a tool called FeedFoundry (see
Figure 6-6). It’s designed to let you manage large sets of feeds across multiple
properties. You can track circulation and ad performance in aggregate and
make real-time adjustments to improve the reach and profitability of your
syndicated content. This is the RSS analytics equivalent to enterprise Web
analytics tools. If you just publish a simple blog, you probably don’t need 
this much power — and it may even confound you. This is high-level insight,
guys, with a mega-dashboard, customizable reports, and security features.
Pricing includes a monthly subscription that is based on several factors
including number of subscribers.
Pheedo
www.pheedo.com
The Pheedo RSS Analytics toolset is turning plenty of heads and getting lots
of ink (journalist talk for media exposure) with its RSS advertising solutions
105
Chapter 6: Discovering Niche Solutions

for publishers. Pheedo (see Figure 6-7) is going head to head with FeedBurner
with tools that offer the same sort of measurements e-mail campaigners
enjoy, such as how many people open a feed and how many clickthrough and
read an article. Although this is not a pure analytics tool — you can’t adopt it
unless you are part of the ad network — if you hope to monetize (generate
revenue) your RSS feeds, this is a strong tool.
SimpleFeed
www.simplefeed.com
SimpleFeed is Pheedo’s pure publishing and analytics partner. SimpleFeed
(see Figure 6-8) offers more comprehensive RSS analytics. Each subscriber
has his own URL, so you can measure RSS subscribe and unsubscribe rates
as well as individual content interests. Using SimpleFeed in conjunction 
with Pheedo offers some interesting analytical benefits, such as better ad
rotation, personalization and frequency capping, which allows you to limit 
the maximum number of impressions/views of an add a visitor can see 
within a defined period of time. SimpleFeed is available in three flavors, 
Basic $99/mo., Pro $199/mo., and Entrprise (which requires you to contact
the company for pricing).

Analytics in a Pod
Are you podcasting? Millions of others do. In fact, researchers at the Diffusion
Group predict that the U.S. podcast audience will climb from 840,000 in 2004
to 56 million by 2010. More optimistic measurements approach the 70-million
mark. Three-quarters of all people who own iPods or some other MP3 player
will be listening to podcasts by that time. It’s all part of the user-generated
content phenomenon. (For more information on podcasting, check out Wiley’s
Podcasting For Dummies (Tee Morris and Evo Terra).
Sounds like a good venue for (yes, that’s right) more advertising. PQ Media
figures that podcast advertising will climb to $3.1 million by 2010. That’s
some serious money for people with a compelling voice and something 
interesting to say. Like other forms of advertising, advertisers want measure-
ments. Anticipating the promise of the just-around-the-corner future, pod-
casting analytics tools are already starting to spring up on the market.
Tracking with PodTractor
www.podgarden.oneupweb.com/tracking/podtractor.htm
PodGarden, a podcast production company, launched the PodTractor pod-
cast analytics tool, which is billed as the industry’s first comprehensive,
hosted podcast tracking system. We’re not sure whether it’s the first, but we
can vouch for the comprehensive part. You don’t have to rely on your gut
feelings when you use this tool. It lets you know right where you stand with-
out having to weed through server logfiles or asking listeners to install soft-
ware on their mobile players. PodTractor (see Figure 6-9) tells you what your
most popular series and episodes are, which domains listeners visited and
what each of them downloaded, and your top podcast referrer. It also sepa-
rates subscribers from nonsubscribers, shows you your top converting key-
words, reveals partial versus completed downloads, and lots of other cool
stuff. You have to contact PodGarden for pricing.
Just like regular Web analytics, podcasting analytics hits can fool you into
thinking you are the next greatest broadcasting star when you really have
only a handful of people listening to your ramblings. The number of hits to 
a file will undoubtedly be greater than the number of folks who actually
download your podcast. By the same token, the number of folks who down-
load your podcast will probably be greater than the number of people who
actually listen to it from the opening music to the “until next time.”

RadioTail (see Figure 6-10) is a podcast advertising network, advanced met-
rics, and dynamic ad serving technology. The company’s aim is to make sure
advertising in podcasts reaches the right audience and delivers a solid return
on investment (ROI). The analytics tool is RadioTail Ripple. It’s a free control
panel that lets you analyze stats on your podcast and build a trusted profile
with verified visitor statistics that advertisers demand. Ripple also lets you
monitor offers from advertisers and track your account balance from one

Because You Are Paying Per Click
Online ad revenues just keep climbing higher and higher. According to the
Interactive Advertising Bureau Internet, advertising revenues for the first half
of 2006 totaled a mind boggling $7.9 billion. That was a record, folks. It was
also a 37-percent increase over the first half of 2005. But here’s the rub (and 
a very sad rub, at that): Not all those ad dollars reaped a return. There’s no
telling how much of that money went down the dot-com drain — unless you
use Web analytics to calculate it.
Don’t be fooled. Pay per click (also called PPC — these are search engine 
listings where advertisers pay per click for placement) can run up a tab 
that you can’t afford to pay in a heartbeat. We’re talking thousands of 
dollars here. If you’re going to play the PPC game, you must get into the 
Web analytics game. No ifs, ands, or buts. Not only do you need to monitor
your Web analytics, but you might also need to invest in some PPC optimiza-
tion analytics for the serious online marketer. These tools tell you exactly
Figure 6-10:

where your money is going as well as what kind of return those dollars 
are bringing in so that you can make changes to your campaigns for better
performance.
CampaignTracker 2.0
www.semphonic.com
Semphonic publishes CampaignTracker 2.0 (see Figure 6-11). It provides 
PPC and competitive reporting about search engine marketing (SEM) 
campaigns. You can make engine-to-engine comparisons, track groups 
of keywords, track position performance, and much more. This software
breaks down keywords in every possible way that you can imagine and 
also scans the Web to find out how your competitors are using keywords.
This is business intelligence at its finest. A single-user license for this soft-
ware costs $499.

Chapter 6: Discovering Niche Solutions

Beware of products and services that guarantee results through bid manage-
ment or PPC optimization services that they run for you. Bid management
tools might have tracking systems, but it’s not the same as analytics. Vendors
who promise high-traffic volumes for pennies on the dollar are usually scams.
Sure, they might send you hits, but that might make you feel like hitting them
back after you get the bill and realize that the traffic was purely junk. If the
traffic isn’t targeted — that is, if the folks who come to the site have no inter-
est in what you have to offer — it probably won’t convert. If it doesn’t con-
vert, you just threw your money out the window with the junk traffic. Get
your own analytics tools and find out for yourself what works.
BlackTrack
www.blacktrackanalytics.com
BlackTrack Analytics (see Figure 6-12) is unique in that it offers a live cost
analysis. That’s right — you can view live information from the leading PPC
search engines and compare that with the revenue earned on your site. You
can measure your search ROI for each keyword with the latest up-to-date
information and increase your revenue with the same ad spend. Sounds
pretty good, doesn’t it? This is a great tool for on-the-fly optimization because
you can see what keywords aren’t performing right away. Why wait? You can
buy the entry-level package for $79.95.

People Watch with Live Analytics Tools
What if we told you that you could watch an individual visitor clickthrough
your site, enter keywords into your internal search engine, stop to read a spe-
cific product description, place the item in his shopping cart, and repeat the
process? Perhaps you have to see it to believe it. Live analytics tools let you
do just that. Live analytics tools are a special subset in the Web analytics
market. These tools are usually tied to live visitor chat programs.
It only makes sense. This virtual customer service agent can watch the visi-
tor’s every move. If a visitor seems to be struggling to find something — as
evidenced by typing in various or similar keywords into the internal search
engine — a live chat rep can pop up with a message asking whether the visi-
tor needs any help (just like in a brick-and-mortar store). If the visitor seems
to be having a hard time getting through the checkout process, once again,
your live chat rep can sweep in and serve as the hero, saving the sale from
shopping cart abandonment oblivion. Live chat helps build trust for your
site, too, because visitors know that help is only a click away. No 24-hour
waits for e-mail customer service.
Live stats also help you get a handle on PPC campaigns and click fraud. The
overall goal of live stats is to help you close more sales more efficiently.
These tools are especially valuable for e-commerce vendors who want to
understand how their site is working and what improvements they can make
to the navigation and other elements. Live analytics take the guesswork out
of what the visitor did because you can watch the action blow by blow and
take the appropriate actions before it’s too late.
113
Chapter 6: Discovering Niche Solutions
When clickers are cons
Click fraud occurs when someone purposely
clicks ad listings with no intention to buy from the
advertiser. Here are at least a couple of motives
for this scam, depending on who is committing it:
A competitor might click your PPC ads repeat-
edly to exhaust your advertising budget so that
he can benefit from the traffic. Or, an affiliate
marketer might click through on links from his
site to drum up revenue. If you see repeat visi-
tors from the same IP address, you could be the
target of click fraud. Other suspicious signs are
one-page visitors, clicks at unusual hours, visi-
tors who do not accept cookies, and short time
spans onsite. Of course, any of these metrics
could be legitimate, but they could be costly in
combination. Niche Web analytics tools have
emerged to help you reign victorious against
these Internet con artists, such as ClickLab,
ClickSentinel, and ClickForensics. These are
strong tools that automatically detect and isolate
potential click fraud activity. Some of them will
even help you get your money back from paid
search providers. If you are sinking with the click
fraud ship, you might want to consider one of
these strategic analytical weapons. To find out
more about these tools, read Chapter 14.

Lots of Web analytics vendors will claim real-time. Thus, you should under-
stand the difference between real-time and live-time.
 Real-time means that your analytics program allows you to refresh the
stats at any time to get the latest counts.
 Live-time, by contrast, means you can actually watch what your visitors
are doing right now, second by second.
This is an important distinction. Don’t be fooled.
WhosOn
www.whoson.com
WhosOn? (see Figure 6-13) lets you watch visitor activity on your Web site 
as it happens and interact with your visitors as they browse. You can watch
them walk through the door, holding their PPC or natural search keywords,
and move from page to page. You can see where they are in the world and
how they found you. You can detect and deter click fraud. And you can chat
with them in real-time to guide visitors to the correct part of your site. This
can lead to cross-selling and up-selling opportunities as you proactively
engage your visitors in a one-on-one relationship. On top of all this, this 
program records histories and other analytics that are standard practice in
the industry. You can choose a client-side, or installable version ($365) or a
hosted version ($35 per month) of this tool. The installable version requires
Windows 2000, XP, Vista or 2003.
VistorVille
www.visitorville.com
VisitorVille (see Figure 6-14) applies video game principles to help you visual-
ize your Web site traffic statistics. This is cool stuff. Here’s how it works:
Each building represents a Web page. Each bus is a search engine. Each ani-
mated character is a real-life visitor on your site. All you have to do is paste a
tracking code into your Web pages and launch the program. You’ll enjoy the
visual metaphors, and your visitors will enjoy the integrated live chat feature.
You can even keep tabs on competing companies visiting your Web site. Let
us put it to you this way: Would you rather read a report that said Overture
sent you a visitor, or would you rather see the Overture bus drop the visitor
at your virtual doorstep? If you chose the latter, VisitorVille is for you. The
program offers all the usual stats and more for as little as $14.99 per month.

VisiStat
www.visistat.com
VisiStat (see Figure 6-15) is a pioneer of what it calls statcasting technology
that streams live data into your reports. You see your Web site pageviews 
at the very second when a visitor clicks your pages. The StatCaster displays
the current visitor’s geographic location. In real-time, VisiStat interprets 
your Web site traffic and builds dynamic reports for trend and marketing
analysis. You can get some helpful ad-on modules with this software, too, 
like AdCaM (which tracks all your campaigns) and PageAlarm (which 
monitors your Web site 24/7/365 and lets you know whether the site goes
down for any reason). You can get started with this program for $19.95 
per month.

Exploring A/B and Multivariate 
Testing Software
If you truly are ready to optimize your site, consider exploring some A/B and
multivariate testing software. These tools help you take the guesswork out of
site changes. Who wants to pay a Web designer big bucks to redesign your
whole site when maybe you just need to tweak some of your landing pages?
No dummy we know.
Also called split testing, A/B testing allows you to compare different versions
of your site and measure the impact they make on conversions. Multivariate
testing goes a step further to let you test multiple versions of the same Web
site. You could literally test hundreds of different variations in the placement
of Buy Now buttons, product images, copyrighting, and the like to figure out
which site variations do the best job persuading visitors to take action. To
read more about how to optimize your site, read Chapter 15.
Just like you would with any software vendor, be sure that the costs are crys-
tal clear, review the types of reports you will receive, ask for an estimate on
ROI (that’s always a hard question to answer, but you should ask it), and by
all means ask for references. Lots of scammers are out there who attempt to
take advantage of good folks who are trying to make a go of it online. Check
for BBB Online seals and other industry affiliations that lend credibility to
their services.
Chances are that if Microsoft, Amazon, and other Fortune 1000 companies are
using the firm, you are in good hands. A few reputable firms include
 Offermatica: www.offermatica.com
 SiteSpect: www.sitespect.com
 Optimost: www.optimost.com
 SplitAnalyzer: www.splitanalyzer.com
 Lunametrics: www.lunametrics.com
Most of these tools allow you create variations of dynamic and static content
without changing the actual code on your site, launch tests in hours without
any IT or technical expertise, run tests on visitors and track behavior across
multiple visits, analyze results in real-time, and target testing efforts more
effectively through visitor segmentation.

Searching for
Statistical
Treasure

In this part . . .
S
earching for statistical treasure is the glory of Web
analytics. Your job is to define what you are looking
for so that you’ll recognize it when you see it. After all,
there is plenty of data that just really doesn’t matter, like
non-human users and referrer spam. Once you get rid of
this analytics “trash” it’s easier to find those precious
gems of information.
In this part, we’ll show you how to take out that trash and
understand your Key Performance Indicators (the data
that matters most). You’ll discover how to put metrics 
like average time on site, average number of pageviews 
(a record of each time a visitor views a Web page on your
site), and shopping cart abandonment rates into perspec-
tive. We’ll also teach you how to wrap your head around
what’s called the conversion funnel and revisit your con-
version rate. (Don’t worry. You don’t need to be a mathe-
matical genius to calculate conversion rates.)
What you’ll soon find is that your Web analytics represent
two different groups of friends: site referrers and visitors.
You’ll discover how to pinpoint which site referrers —
such as search engines, content partners, and link
exchanges — are sending traffic your way. You’ll also
learn how to glean valuable insights about visitor behav-
ior based on where they came from, what they did while
they were there, and even what country they are surfing
from and what browsers they used. It’s not about being a
nosy snoop. It’s about gathering data that unlocks greater
profits.
Finally, we’ll teach you how to zero in on your most popu-
lar pages. We like to call them VIPs (Very Important
Pages) because this is where your bread is buttered. In
other words, certain pages drive most of your outside
traffic and certain pages may convert more visitors than
others. Knowing which pages are doing the heavy lifting
makes your load a little lighter.

 Eliminating nonhuman users
 Fighting referrer spam
 Ignoring non–mission-critical stats
I
f you depended on weekly chores to earn a few extra bucks in your child-
hood years, you’re probably familiar with these four words: “Take out the
trash!” In fact, in all likelihood, Mom probably had to repeat those words
more than once before you got around to taking that Hefty bag down to the
curb. Mom was persistent — not because she was giving you a $5-per-week
allowance but because she understood the stinky consequences of not taking
out the trash. Now that you are all grown up and building your Internet
empire, don’t forsake Mom’s advice: Take out the trash!
Consider Web analytics trash as the metrics that don’t really matter. In fact,
not only do they not matter, but they can actually stink up your data if you
don’t weed them out. Trash could be nonhuman users, like robots. Also
known as Web crawlers, bots, or spiders, a robot is an automated script or pro-
gram that browses the Web. Nonhuman users could also be hosting monitor-
ing services (services that visit Web sites looking for outages) or e-mail
harvesters (bots that collect e-mail addresses displayed on your pages) or
even notification services that tell various search engines that you updated
your blog.
If those nonhuman users weren’t enough to keep you on your toes, referrer
spam can also give you fits. Referrer spam occurs when unscrupulous Web
site operators use technology to fake sending traffic to your site so that you
will see their URL in your site referrer list and visit them. Site referrers, or
referring pages, are the URLs of the previous Web page from which a link was
followed. Not only do you want to refrain from measuring it, but you want to
fight against it. We’ll show you how. Finally, there is other data that just does-
n’t matter. In other words, you don’t want to waste your time with non–mis-
sion-critical stats. Those stats will be different for different Web sites. In this
chapter, we’ll help you determine how to eat the hay and spit out the sticks
so you don’t choke on irrelevant stats.

You’ll also discover that not all traffic is good traffic. We show you how to tell
the difference between what matters to you, what doesn’t matter at all, and
how to wage war against sinister plots that could cause trouble for your site.
So put on some gloves and get ready to take out some analytics trash.
Classifying Nonhuman Users
Nonhuman users are just what they sound like: nonhuman users. A nonhu-
man user is any visitor that is not an actual person who uses a browser to
navigate your site. The challenge is that nonhuman users can indeed look like
living, breathing visitors and be counted as such. Your job, if you choose to
accept it, is to eliminate these imposters.
Several different types of nonhuman users exist. You need to be aware of
them and classify them so you know what to look for when it’s time to elimi-
nate them. You also need to understand the motivation of these nonhuman
users so you can decide whether to spend your time trying to shut them out
of your online kingdom. Here are a few of the most common types of nonhu-
man users and some tips on how to respond to them.
Robots, spiders, and Web crawlers
Robots, spiders, and Web crawlers are virtually synonymous. Good bots
(which typically come from major search engines like Google and Yahoo!) are
on a mission to index your Web site — and that’s a good thing. Bad bots, on
the other hand, disguise themselves under the cloak of unique visitors with
the intent of gathering data from your Web site to use for their ominous pur-
poses. (Read more about e-mail harvesters later in this chapter.)
Of course, not all unidentified bots are necessarily bandits. Some small
search engines just don’t properly identify themselves. Or, it could be that
your site was visited by some college experimenters. (Sometimes university
students develop new search engines as part of their curriculum.) In both
cases, you can track these bots back to their rightful owner by their associ-
ated Internet protocol (IP) addresses (a unique numeric code assigned by the
user’s Internet service provider) or hostname. Just do a search for IP
address lookup or hostname lookup on Google for various tools to help
accomplish this.
Some analytics applications provide links to IP address lookups directly from
the application. If you use Urchin as your analytics application of choice, you
can just click the IP address in the top IP Addresses report (see Figure 7-1) to
see what network it belongs to.

The evil of e-mail harvesters
Some bots are nothing more than e-mail harvesters, also known as spambots.
Spambots look for any string of text that appears to be an e-mail address.
They gather these into a database and sell lists to spammers who blast out
unsolicited e-mail with product offers. Spambots are also a method employed
by phishers, those nefarious folk who get their list of potential victims by
tricking people into giving them confidential information or doing something
else they normally wouldn’t do, typically through spam messages (see Figure
7-2) that appear legitimate (like a bogus bank communication or some mes-
sage supposedly from eBay or PayPal). E-mail harvesters are one of the evils
of the Internet. If your e-mail address is displayed on your Web page, it’s a
target for e-mail harvesters.

Uptime hosting monitoring services
Uptime companies, also known as hosting monitoring services, can also visit
your site. There are many different services. Some of the most popular are
 Hosttracker: www.hosttracker.com
 Alertra: www.alertra.com
 Netcraft: www.netcraft.com
Uptime monitoring services detect outages in Web servers, e-mail servers, DNS
servers, and routers. They ping: that is, use a program to test whether a particu-
lar network destination is online by sending a request to and waiting for a
response from your Web site to make sure it’s up and running. If it isn’t, this
automated software tool notifies the customer via e-mail or text messages to
your mobile phone. Large companies can use it. Web hosts can use it. However,
anyone who is interested in tracking the uptime of your Web site, for any
reason, can arrange for a hosting monitoring service to visit your site. (Sort of
makes you feel like Big Brother is watching you, eh?) In the high-stakes world of
online business, site downtime can mean hours of lost sales, and that can make
the average cost of services like this, often less than $20 a month, well worth it.

Gotta love link checkers and validators
Link checkers and validators are nonhuman users that analyze Web sites for
broken and problem links. These aren’t malicious users at all. You might have
even invited them in by subscribing to a link-checking service, such as Link
Checker Pro (www.linkcheckerpro.com) or Web Link Validator (www.rel-
software.com). Or you might get a report (see Figure 7-3) from a company
like InternetSeer that offers you data on your broken links in hopes that you’ll
subscribe to its link management services. Link checkers can be important
because search engines penalize sites with broken links — and, in some
cases, won’t list sites with lots of broken links. You can also read your Web
analytics report’s section on broken links. For more information on broken
links, read Chapter 10.
125
Chapter 7: Taking Out the Trash
Battling spambots
You are not powerless against spambots, those
automated software programs that collect
e-mail addresses for the express purpose of
selling address lists to spammers. You can
battle spambots in several ways. Of course,
each method has its pros and cons.
 Spell out your address. Instead of using an
e-mail link, you could simply spell out the
address so that harvesters can’t readily
recognize it. Con: This quick-and-easy solu-
tion forces legitimate e-mailers to type out
your address by hand — and if they aren’t
good typists, qualified leads might not find
you in time.
 Display your address as an image. You
could also display your e-mail address as
an image file so that harvesters can’t see it.
Con: Again, you are forcing legit users to
type it in manually.
 Password-protect the address page. You
could put password protection on the page
containing your e-mail address. Con: This is
realistic only for private Web sites and
intranets.
 Encode the address. You could encode the
e-mail addresses with JavaScript so that
harvesters are blinded. Con: If your legit
users don’t enable JavaScript, they may not
be able to see it, either.
 Use a special form. You could even set up a
special contact form that users have to fill
out. Con: You might need to get a developer
to do the coding.
At the end of the day, you need to decide
whether this is a battle worth fighting.

Recognizing RSS feed readers
RSS, Really Simple Syndication, is a method for syndicating content on a Web
site. Major newspapers use this method as well as bloggers and others who
want to push content out to the masses rather than waiting on the masses to
visit their site. RSS feed readers, also called aggregators, are software applica-
tions or remotely hosted services that collect syndicated content from vari-
ous Web sites into one program for easy viewing. Popular RSS feed readers
include FeedBurner, Syndirella, and NetNewsWire. The URL of the referrer
contains the name of the reader. You’ll find evidence of these readers in your
list of site referrers. For more information on RSS analytics, read Chapter 5,
which covers niche solutions.
Blog-monitoring services
Nonhuman users can be blog search services or pinging services. In the con-
text of blogging, a pinging service tells search engines that you updated your
blog. Blog search services allow users to search through a catalog of blogs to
discover posts on topics of their choice. Perhaps the most comprehensive
blog search and monitoring service is Technorati, which is also a pinging ser-
vice. Another popular pinging service is Pingomatic. You might see these or
other services, such as NewsGator, Feedster, or Blogdigger, listed in your site
referrer report. From a blogger’s standpoint, this is helpful to determine how
many people are searching for topics posted in your blog. But you can just as
well look at the pageviews to see which blog topics drove the most traffic.
For more information on blogging analytics, read Chapter 5.

Why Eliminate Nonhuman Users?
Because you can’t convert nonhuman users to a sale, subscriber, member or
anything else, you shouldn’t let these stats influence your Web decisions.
Imagine quickly glancing at your Web analytics report and determining that
Fridays see the most traffic. You confidently decide to launch a special pro-
motion on that day. What you didn’t know was that nonhuman users have
erroneously inflated your visitor counts. Your highest human visitor counts
are actually on Sunday evenings. You just blew your chance to convert the
highest possible number of visitors with your special promotion. The point is
that you can’t make solid business decisions based on bad information.
When you eliminate nonhuman users, don’t throw the robot report out the
window. You should keep your eyes on your robot visitors on occasion to
make sure the Big Three search engines — Google, Yahoo!, and Microsoft —
are crawling your site. If these engines aren’t crawling your site periodically,
you could be losing relevant traffic. Also, keep an occasional eye on your
robots report so you can see whether any particular engine is suddenly send-
ing you large volumes of visitors. If you discover that a smaller, niche search
engine is sending visitors your way, consider launching a PPC to generate an
even greater buzz on with those targeted users. The good news is that good
bots aren’t registered as human activity, so you don’t have to eliminate them
from your visitor counts.
Knowing that nonhuman users are traveling across your site is one thing, but
knowing how to identify them is another — and it’s the first step toward elim-
inating them from your decision making process. Consider the following
steps for identifying nonhuman users:
 Review your reports. Review your Web analytics report each month to
look for any user agent names that you don’t recognize. Specifically, look
at your site referrer list and your Robot report. You should be relatively
familiar with your usual site referrers and standard robots. If there is a
site referrer you don’t recognize, click the link to see who it is. It could
be a new ally, but it could be an undercover enemy with malicious
intent. The same goes for the Robot report. Some robots don’t identify
themselves for malicious reasons. Those are your suspects.
 Monitor agent behavior. Robots can be identified by their behavior
while on your site (see Figure 7-4). Do some visitors generate pageviews
that number 10, or even 100 times the number of pages that your aver-
age visitor looks at? If a bot queries you 20 or 30 times per hour, it’s
probably up to no good. Check with your hosting company or server
administrator for ways to block them at the Web server level, stopping
them dead in their tracks.
127
Chapter 7: Taking Out the Trash

Is the user agent a legitimate spider that appears to be doing its duties?
Or does a particular unknown spider use up large chunks of your band-
width allotment? (Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be trans-
ferred to and from a Web site in a given period of time. This is usually
expressed as bits per second [bps] or higher units like Mbps [megabits
per second].) If you see an unknown spider gobbling up bandwidth at
rates higher than the Big Three, be suspicious — be very suspicious.
These non-human users could be out to extract data from your pages,
like e-mail addresses.
 Exclude the bad apples. You need to put your user agent data into con-
text to determine whether you should really count the visitor. Wisdom
speaks against counting unique visitors who stay less than ten seconds.
You don’t want to gear your Web decisions around folks who weren’t
interested in what you had to offer or nonhuman users that were just
validating uptime or pursuing click fraud activities. (Click fraud involves
sending fraudulent clicks to PPC advertisers.) When you eliminate the
visitors who stay less than ten seconds, you might eliminate a few valid
users with them, but make no mistake: You will be hurt more by includ-
ing nonhuman users than by eliminating a few human visitors who just
didn’t buy into your concept.

The Danger of Referrer Spam
If you have ever used e-mail, you are overly familiar with spam, that unso-
licted e-mail with offers for everything from discounted Rolex watches to fake
offers from bogus estate holders promising you millions of dollars. These
annoying salesmen have wormed their way into many Web sites, too, through
referrer spam. Also known as spamdexing, perpetrators of referrer log spam-
ming make repeated requests to your Web site using a fake URL that points to
a spam-advertised site.
Referrer spam can be inconvenient, muddying up your site referrer report, or
it can be deadly, wasting away your bandwidth and causing one of two
unwanted problems:
 Excess bandwidth charges
 The inability to serve pages to legitimate traffic because your site is
overloaded
Thus, keeping your eye on your Referral report is vital. If you get only an
occasional referrer spam, it might not be worth your time to deal with it. If
you are getting spamdexed to death, though, it’s time to fight back.
The referral spam technique is clever because sites that publicize their referrer
statistics, such as blogs, will also link to the spammer’s site by default. That
link boosts the spammer’s ranking in the search engine and gives them a batter
chance of getting visitors through natural search. Curious Web site owners
(like you) might also decide to click a link that you don’t recognize to find the
spam-advertised site. That can be potentially dangerous as well because mali-
cious hackers can secretly install spyware or other viruses and bugs onto your
computer without you ever knowing it.
Recognizing referrer spam
How do you recognize referrer spam? Some common referrer spam URLs
often include words like casino, poker, and texasholdem, or adult-oriented
content. You can also recognize referrer spam by typos in the URL. The refer-
rer spam might also have the name of the product the spammer is selling, like
Prozac, Vicodin, or some other prescription drug they claim to peddle at dis-
count rates.
129
Chapter 7: Taking Out the Trash

To give you a better idea of what this might look like in your site referrer
report, here is a list of referrer spam URLs:
http://www.texasholdemcentral.com
http://www.favorite-casino/blackjack.html
http://www.online-casino.blest-casino.com
http://www.fistfulofeuros.net
http://www.poker-4all.com/poker-rooms.html
As you can see, if your site doesn’t offer poker tips, there is no reason for
these sites to send you traffic. So after you identify that you’re getting refer-
rer spam, what can you do about it? Fight back!
Fighting Referrer Spam
You can’t fight against what you can’t see, but what you can’t see could be
harming you. Referrer spam is like an undetected cancer on your site referrer
report. It’s eating away at your time because you have to eliminate these non-
human users to get to the heart of who is sending legitimate traffic to your
site. After you recognize referrer spam as your enemy, you can fight against it.
Unfortunately, there is no silver bullet that will stop referrer spam once and
for all. Here are, however, some counter tactics that you can deploy against
these deceptive foes. Some are technical; others just cost a few bucks.
Blacklist the spammers
You can fight referrer spam with a hand-edited blacklist of known spammers.
It might not be the quickest solution, but it works well. If your site is running
on an Apache server, the most popular Web server software, and your Web host
has enabled the feature, you can use a configuration file called .htaccess to
block users or sites that come from a particular domain or IP address.
To implement this fix, you’ll either need to find someone who’s familiar with
htaccess commands, or you’ll need to take some online tutorials to bring
your htaccess writing skills up to par. What’s more, with the speed at which
spammers are creating new URLs, it can be difficult — and time consuming —
to keep up with this manual remedy.
130
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

Use the rel = “no follow” solution
An HTML attribute designed to combat comment spam on blogs, which also
works well for referral spam, is rel = “no follow”. This fix is easy. You
just tag any outgoing link with rel = “no follow” attribute to prevent the
spammer from enjoying a boost in a search engine’s rank. Because the spam-
mers aren’t benefiting from spamming your site, they might decide to focus
their efforts elsewhere. Here’s an example of some code utilizing the
rel=”no follow” attribute:
<a href=”http://www.dummies.com” rel=”nofollow”>Visit
Dummies.com</a>
Rely on your analytics tools
For a one-time flat-fee of $30, you can license an analytics tool called Mint.
Mint specifically ignores referrer spam. The developer bills it as referrer-
spam–proof. Referrers are broken down by newest unique, most recent, and
repeat referrers from a customizable timeframe. You can also measure visits,
browsers, and platforms; find search terms in popular search engines, and
illuminate your most popular pages and most recently accessed content. You
can even bookmark or watch individual pages. Mint might not run on your
server, though. The developer offers a compatibility test that you can take to
find out in a flash. You can visit it at www.haveamint.com.
Whatever method you choose, remember these two caveats:
 Be sure to review the filters to make sure you aren’t getting any false
positives. The last thing you want to do is block legitimate referrers.
 Avoid slower performance. Typically, if you enable methods to combat
referrer spam, your Web server logfile is checked against every line in
the blacklist file. That means it could wind up taking you much longer to
run your reports.
Ultimately, you have to decide what’s worse: the pain of fighting referrer
spam, or the pain of weeding through it in your referrer report.

Chapter 7: Taking Out the Trash

Ignoring Non–Mission-Critical Stats
Some data just doesn’t matter to most people. It’s not critical to your mis-
sion. With so many KPIs, it’s helpful to ignore the non–mission-critical stats,
or at least not spend much time analyzing them. You’ll find that your mission
critical stats might change over time as your Web site’s goals change. Well,
you can always change your analyzing strategy later, but your goal with Web
analytics is always the same: to use the best data, the best way, to get the
best possible results on your site. The following sections discuss some data
that might just not matter.
Who needs hit counts?
We’ll say it before, and we’ll say it again (and again and again): Hits are the
most deceptive stat of them all. A hit registers each time a file is requested
from your site. Each page on your Web site can include photographs, text,
graphics, sound files, PDFs, or some other file type. Thus, a request for a
page with 10 images would count as 11 hits. Thirty-thousand visitors would
easily rack up 1 million hits in a hurry on a catalog-style site that serves up
30 or 40 photos per page.
Don’t even pay attention to your hits. It isn’t a realistic assessment of how
your Web site is performing. It could be that most of your visitors all went to
the pages that contained the largest number of files last month but visited
the pages with the fewest number of files this month. The data, then, would
be far and away skewed. If you track hits, you could swing back and forth
from an elated mood to a panic-stricken frame of mind from day to day and
month to month. Who needs it?
Do you have the time?
Do you really have the time to keep up with the times of day visitors come to
your site? If you take a look at the hour during which your visitors came
knocking, you’ll probably find that they are navigating your Web site at each
and every hour of the day. That’s not surprising because there are plenty of
different time zones around the world. When it’s noon in the United States,
it’s 5 p.m. in the United Kingdom. When it’s midnight in some other parts of
the world, it’s noon somewhere else. So, knowing whether a visitor came at 2
a.m. or 2 p.m. won’t make much difference to most Web site owners. Unless
you’re trying to measure the effectiveness of your special midnight sales, you
probably don’t need to sweat these statistics.

Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

Basking in your international appeal
If your site has been up and running for any length of time — and if the spi-
ders are crawling it — the list of countries that your visitors represent is
probably lengthy. It can be cool to see all the different flags; see Figure 7-5.
(Who would have thought three people from Latvia would ever visit your
site?) Unless you are specifically targeting users in certain countries, though,
this list just doesn’t matter.
Who’s hosting my visitors?
Your Hosts report will offer all the IP addresses your visitors used. It’s likely
that the host that rang up the most pages is your very own. The host of your
visitors won’t usually matter unless you are trying to root out abusers.
Perhaps a certain visitor from a certain IP address is using most of your
bandwidth. This is suspicious activity that needs to be investigated.
However, beyond a quick scan, most of this data just doesn’t matter.

Authenticated users and anonymous users
Your Authenticated Users report won’t matter much unless you are tracking
visits to a Member’s Only portion of your Web site. In that case, you might
want to calculate the difference in traffic between non-registered and regis-
tered users to see who comes to the site most often. However, most sites
don’t even have member’s only sites. If that’s you, you can ignore these stats,
which will merely report 0.

Your site is probably made up of all different types of files, such as images,
static HTML or XML static pages, dynamic HTML pages, Cascading Style
Sheet (CSS) files, JavaScript files, and so on. These are the file types that your
developer used to create your site, and you can basically ignore those stats.
The only time that the Files Type report might matter to you is if you are
trying to tack how many times visitors downloaded a PDF or other specific
file format. Of course, if you have lots of those types of files, this report won’t
tell you which particular files were downloaded. You will need to check your
Most Popular Files report for that data. At the end of the day, this statistic
just isn’t terribly valuable to most Web site owners.
Favorites and bookmarks
Your Web analytics program might tell you how many people bookmarked
your site or added you to their favorite sites list. First of all, there’s no accu-
rate way for a Web analytics program to track that sort of stat. Even the best
programs are just guessing. Secondly, who really cares? It might make you
smile to think that x number of your visitors liked your site enough to book-
mark it. Just because they bookmarked it doesn’t mean that they’ll ever come
back, though. Think about it — how many different sites have you book-
marked, never to return? Case in point.
Miscellaneous miscellany
Your Web analytics program might have a chart for Miscellaneous. Here
you’ll probably find just that: miscellany. You’ll find stats on browsers, such
as how many visitors used browsers with support for Java, Macromedia
Director, Flash, Real Audio, or some other type of plug-in. If you don’t have
any of those fancy-schmancy elements on your site — or if you aren’t plan-
ning to incorporate them — it just doesn’t matter.

M
arketing gurus suggest asking new customers this question: “How did
you hear about us,” figuring that the answer to that six-word query
will help unravel the mystery of measuring promotional efforts. The only
problem is that those same marketing gurus admit that the answers are
skewed. In fact, they figure that you’re lucky if 25 percent of the responses
you get are accurate.
The truth is most people don’t remember exactly where they heard about
some new retail boutique on Main Street. Maybe they saw an advertisement
promising 10% Off in the newspaper, heard a radio announcement hyping the
grand opening celebration, or had lunch with a co-worker who raved about
the trendy selection.
The beauty of the World Wide Web, however, is that you can indeed know
exactly who referred visitor to your site. Even the simplest Web analytics
tools record each and every site referrer. The site referrer, or referring page, is
the URL of the previous Web page from which a link was followed. Whether
your visitor is introduced to your site through a search engine, a link building
campaign, or some other strategy, you’ll be sure to know it.
This chapter covers how to use your site referrer stats in your Web analytics
study. We cover how to get the information, what it means, and then how to
use it to improve your site’s traffic.

Revving Up for Referrers
We use AWStats as our Web analytics tool for the examples in this chapter
because it’s a free program that many Web hosting firms include as part of
your package. And because AWStats is written in Perl, it can work on all oper-
ating systems. It’s also chock full of features to satiate the data hungry.
If your host offers the cPanel control panel to administer your Web site, you
probably have AWStats already installed. If AWStats isn’t installed on your
Web server, you can ask your host to install it for you.
If you have the right permissions for your server, you can download AWStats
from http://awstats.sourceforge.net and install it yourself. AWStats
can work with all Web servers able to write log file with a combined log 
format (XLF/ELF) such as Apache, a common log format (CLF) such as Apache
or Squid, a W3C log format such as IIS 5.0 or higher, or any other log format
that contains all information AWStats expect to find. It also works with most
Web/Wap/Proxy/Streaming servers, and some FTP, Syslog, or Mail log files.
Discovering Your Traffic Partners
As you embark on your quest to generate more traffic to your Web site, you’ll
need your site referrer report to show you the way. Referrers, also known as
traffic partners, are the URLs listed in your site referrer report and are allies in
the battle for more online traffic.
This powerful collection of metrics — data used to assess and monitor activ-
ity on a Web site — unlocks the mysteries of driving more successful market-
ing campaigns by revealing the names and impact of your site referrers. So
what are you waiting for? Gather your referral information and discover your
traffic partners so you can make educated decisions about where you spend
your marketing time and dollars.
To start using your analytics to direct your marketing efforts, follow these
steps:
1. Gather your referral information.
Access your Web analytics tool and look for a section labeled Referrers.
This is the area within the tool that collects detailed information about
your traffic partners. In AWStats, the Referers section can be found
about three-quarters of the page down in the left side, below the
Navigation section (see Figure 8-1).
136
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

2. Review sources of your Web traffic.
Referrer information is usually grouped into various categories, such as
traffic from bookmarks, newsgroups, search engines, and external Web
sites. Monitoring repeat visits from users who have bookmarked your
site can be exciting, but measuring traffic from bookmarks is difficult at
best — and largely unreliable. Web analytics software merely makes an
educated guess. Once a powerful way to generate traffic, the use of
newsgroups are declining in the face of social networking sites such as
MySpace.com and Del.icio.us.
In today’s Web analytics economy, traffic patterns generated through
search engines and external Web sites are the most vital metrics. The
referring search engines section can help you measure and compare nat-
ural search — traffic that comes from unpaid search engine listings — and
paid search campaigns, such as Google’s Adwords program. Meanwhile, a
list of external Web sites that have pushed traffic your way can help you
guide your link building strategies.
3. Make educated decisions about your campaigns.
Your referrer report offers much of the data that you need to make edu-
cated decisions about your marketing campaigns. Armed with indis-
putable information about where traffic is coming from, you can
compare search engine with search engine and link partner with link
partner to determine which marketing wells deserve more investment,
where to prime the pump, and when to shut off the faucet.

Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers

The following sections discuss how to gather referral information and review
sources of Web traffic in more detail. For more information on making edu-
cated decisions about your campaign, see Part IV.
Identifying your referrers
When it comes to displaying where your Web site visitors are coming from,
each Web analytics tool presents information in a slightly different way.
Most Web analytics tools are commonly found in the Web-based, hosting con-
trol panel, and AWStats is no exception. When you sign up for your Web host-
ing service, your hosting company should provide you with information
about how to access your control panel. For more information on how to
locate and log in to your stats application, see Chapter 3.
After logging in, you see AWStats available under the Web/FTP Stats heading.
Figure 8-2 shows the main page from AWStats.

138
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

Look for the AWStats Referers section in the lower-left side of the page. This
is where you can find all the relevant data you need to make decisions about
your online traffic building strategies.
When you click the Origin link, you see the referrers’ origin summary section
(see Figure 8-3). The information in this section is divided into five categories
to indicate the type of source that referred the visitor:
 Direct address/Bookmarks
 Links from a NewsGroup
 Links from an Internet Search Engine
 Links from an external page (other Web sites except search engines)
 Visits of an unknown origin
Unknown origins are largely such — unknown. Referrers are determined by
reverse DNS look-ups — that is, translating IP numbers to domain names to
uncode the true referrer. Many numerical addresses are of unknown origin. In
fact, when you review your site referrers, you might be disgruntled by the
percentage of hits that seem to wear the cloak of anonymity. Even the best
analytics programs are stumped, it seems, although this is clear: If you see a
high level of use from an unresolved IP number, it could be spiders. Also
known as Web crawlers or robots, a spider is a program or automated script
that browsers the Web. You may occasionally hear spiders referred to as
ants, automatic indexers, bots, or worms. Search engines use spiders to
gather up-to-date data as they index the Web.

Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers

Classifying sources of Web traffic
The first step toward making the most of your Web site traffic is getting
acquainted with the various referrers and recognizing who’s who in the refer-
rer list. The following list discusses some of the more popular sources for
Web site traffic:
 Search engines: If your traffic is coming directly from Google, MSN, Yahoo!,
or some other search engine, your analytics tool can break down the met-
rics by the search engine’s name and how many hits it sent your way.
 Web ring partners: Web rings are a way to interlink related sites so that
people can visit many similar Web pages simply by clicking a traditional
Next link, often located at the bottom of the page. You can identify other
Web sites from your Web ring by visiting the URL and looking for a men-
tion of the Web ring on their Web sites.

Who’s trying to find out who I am?
If you run across a site referrer that looks some-
thing like: www.whois.sc/yourdomain
.com (where yourdomain.com is replaced
with your actual domain name), someone
tapped into the Whois Lookup database to find
out who you are. Why do they care? Here are
several reasons:
 To find out who the registered owner for the
domain is: Maybe someone wants to partner
with you. Maybe a competitor is conducting
some business intelligence. Maybe it’s an
old friend who’s looking for your number. We
call these folks Curious Georges.
 To find out when a domain name is going to
expire: These seekers are people who want
your domain and hope to snatch it out from
under your feet when it expires. Services
from Internet registrars like GoDaddy.com
offer automatic renewals so this can’t
happen.
 To place a bid on a URL that you’re selling
or just not using: You might own a couple
dozen (or more) URLs as you take dominion
on the World Wide Web. It’s your right to
sell them to the highest bidder.
 To find out where a domain is hosted: Who
would want to know that, you ask? A Web
developer who needs to look up technical
details, like your IP address, the DNS
servers, or your Web host to make changes
to the location of your Web site.
If you don’t like the idea of total strangers visit-
ing your site, getting your address and phone
number, and waiting to snatch up your domain,
you can opt for a private listing. Just like the
phone company, you can keep your information
hidden for a small fee.
Typically, when you register your domain name
you can opt to keep it private during the sign up
process. If you did not initially choose to keep
your information private, you can return to your
Domain Name provider and opt to pay for the
privilege later. Simply log in to your account, look
for the domain manager, and select the privacy
feature. This typically costs about $5 a year.

 Link partners: Trading links with business partners, friends, and col-
leagues is old-fashioned networking at its best. If you keep a list of Web
sites that you’ve exchanged links with, you can recognize these allied
URLs by cross-referencing that list with the list of external referring
sites.
 Affiliate marketers: If you have an affiliate program in place that pays
Web site owners for each lead or sale they send your way, you can com-
pare your list of external referrers with your list of affiliate marketers to
find out which affiliate marketers are sending traffic.
 E-mail campaigns: If you put a link to your site in an e-mail marketing
campaign, you might see referrals from Web mail services such as
Hotmail and Yahoo!.
This works, however, only with e-mails sent to recipients who have Web-
based mail.
As you wade through the mountains of relevant data Web analytics software
generates, take some time to comb through your list of site referrers, no
matter how long or short it is. Site referrer statistics are like latitude and lon-
gitude designations on a map: They offer a frame of reference as you explore
the world of search engine advertising and link building campaign strategies.
Searching for Statistical Treasure
Scavenger hunts can be fun, but treasure hunts are more profitable. With
your site referral stats in hand, you don’t have to play guessing games to
determine where traffic is coming from. You know exactly what you are look-
ing for — whether it’s how many hits you got from your new link partner yes-
terday or how many visitors Google sent through your virtual doors last
month — and you will recognize it when you find it.
Of course, you have to know where you are before you forge ahead with new
traffic generation campaigns. Web analytics gives you a point of reference
that acts as a yardstick for your traffic building efforts. From there, you can
measure the success or failure of your strategies.
This section can help you unlock information to measure the payoff from your
current internal search engine optimization efforts, your paid search cam-
paigns, and your various link-building strategies. You might think you get the
most traffic from Google, for example, but you could find out that you get 
the most conversions from the traffic Yahoo! refers. You might even discover
that you’re missing golden opportunities because you aren’t drawing traffic
from the hundreds of second-tier search engines (such as www.alltheweb
.com and www.altavista.com) that scour the Web for sites like yours.
141
Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers

Which search engines list your site?
Hundreds of search engines are on the Web: shopping search engines and kid
search engines, country-specific search engines and multimedia search
engines, metasearch engines and pay-per-click search engines. The list goes
on. Your Web analytics tool will reveal which engines your site is most likely
listed in. Refer to the chart in Figure 8-3 to see the search engine Referers sec-
tion from the AWStats Web analytics tool. This simple report shows a list of
the top (up to ten) search engines, ranked by pageview, along with a link to
see the full list. A quick glance at the Links from an Internet Search Engine
section shows which search engines send traffic to your Web site. Chances
are that if your Web site is listed in a particular search engine, the engine will
drive at least some traffic. You can glean several valuable nuggets in this
course of our treasure hunt:
 Hitting the Big Three: Our sample Web site is listed in Google, MSN, and
Yahoo!, which are widely recognized as the Big Three search engines. It’s
great that your site is on the map, so to speak, but don’t pat yourself on
the back just yet. These mainstream engines have overactive Web
crawlers, so they’re often quick to find Web sites without much effort
from you. (Web crawlers are automated scripts that scour the Web,
adding or updating the search engine’s database of Web sites. Read
more about them in Chapter 2.)
 Getting to the next level: The sample Web site isn’t getting any traffic
from second-tier search engines, like Ask Jeeves, AlltheWeb, and Mamma.
That could mean one of two things: Either these search engines aren’t
sending traffic your way, or you aren’t registered with those search
engines. The latter is the more likely scenario. The good news is the
latter is also under your control. Make sure that you’re registered with
second-tier search engines that could generate traffic galore.
Conveniently enough, you can read how in the following section.
 Finding the niches: Our example tool, AWStats, recognizes 122 search
engines at the time of this writing. The sample Web site is getting traffic
from only eight of them. Time to start registering your site with relevant
niche search engines and boost that traffic!
Register your Web site with search engines
If you’re not getting the search engine action you need, don’t throw up your
hands in despair. It’s easy to register your site with a search engine. Using
Google as an example, registration can be accomplished in five easy steps.
1. Browse to Google.com.
2. Like most search engines, you’ll find an About link on the home page
(About Google, in this example). Click that link.
142
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

3. In the top-right section — For Site Owners — click the Submit Your
Content To Google link.
4. Click the Add Your URL To Google’s Index link and then submit your
content.
5. Type your URL, any comments you want to add, and then click the
Add URL button.
The registration process is similar with most search engines. If you’d rather
not manually enter your registration at the hundreds of online search
engines, you can hire a service handle the submissions for you, as we discuss
in the next section.
Hiring a service
If you’re not the do-it-yourself type, you might want to look at hiring a service
to handle your search engine submissions. Many are out there, but we would
caution you to avoid the ones that promise you the world. Number 1 rankings
for high-traffic keywords aren’t easy to come by, despite what search engine
optimization company salespeople tell you. A reputable company will explain
to you that natural, or unpaid, search engine marketing is a process that takes
time and offers little guarantees. Look for references and contact information
from previous clients — then do your homework and contact those clients to
hear about their experience firsthand.
Are you missing out on the search action?
No hard and fast rule exists as to how much traffic search engines should
drive to your Web site. Some Web site owners might generate only minimal
traffic from search engines because they concentrate their marketing efforts
on link exchanges. Other Web site owners might depend exclusively on
search engines to let the world know how to find them. To determine
whether you’re missing out on the action, considering the following factors:
 Is your traffic membership- or loyalty-based? If your Web site depends
on membership- or loyalty-based strategies to woo visitors, you should-
n’t be dismayed if search engines are driving only 25 percent of your
traffic. Membership-based sites could be forums or online communities
to which members must register to gain access to certain portions of
your site. Loyalty-based traffic characterizes visitors who bookmark
your site. If you already have an established following, a large percent-
age of your traffic will naturally fall under the Direct address/Bookmarks
section of your site referrer report.
143
Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers

 How much unique content do you offer on your site? Unique content is
the food of choice for search engine spiders. If your site offers lots of
original, high-quality content on a regular basis, you should expect
search engine traffic percentages of 60 percent or more. Blogs are a good
example of how the frequent addition of new content drives search
engine traffic.
 Are you running search advertising campaigns? Search engine pay-
per-click advertising, such as Google Adwords or Yahoo! Search
Marketing, will definitely skew the percentages of search engine traffic.
In this case, you might want to evaluate the percentage each engine is
driving to your site based on your spending with that particular site (see
Figure 8-4). Pay-per-click is an advertising pricing model in which adver-
tisers pay agencies a predetermined fee each time a visitor clicks on the
promotional link; for more information check out Pay Per Click Search
Engine Optimization For Dummies by Peter Kent (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Which search engines send you traffic?
After you know which search engines have your number, look more closely at
which ones visitors are using to dial you up. This metric will reveal where
you should be investing your Search Engine Marketing (SEM) dollars. A
deeper analysis will even show you which sites are giving you the most bang
for your paid search buck.
Figure 8-4:
List of Links

144
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

What engine gets the attention?
Check out Figure 8-4. It’s no surprise that Google is atop the list because Google
gets the majority of search engine use. According to Nielsen//NetRatings, Google
gets 49 percent of all searches, Yahoo! gets 22 percent, and MSN gets 11 percent.
Unless you’re investing heavily in paid search campaigns with another search
engine, Google will probably be atop your list, too. As you can see in Figure 8-4,
MSN is an extremely distant second while AOL and the rest barely made it on
the chart. Based on what the sample Web site and what we know about search
engine traffic in general, you can conclude that you could generate more traffic
from Yahoo! — and probably MSN, too.
Looking to throw some extra attention at one of the main search engines?
Consider the following factors before investing your resources:
 Is your target site one of the Big Three? Investing some energy to beef
up your ranking in Google, Yahoo!, and MSN is a smart move. Just
remember to measure your efforts to make sure that they’re paying off.
 Are you seeing traffic spikes from second-tier engines? If you begin to
notice that you’re generating significant traffic from a lesser-known
search engine, do some testing to determine how you might benefit by
investing in that engine. You might find hidden treasure waiting to be
discovered.
 Do you peddle niche products or services? Unless your products and
services appeal to niche surfers, tossing your time and money at
obscure search engines doesn’t make much sense. If the converse is
true, then by all means tap into the specialty searchers and draw as
much traffic as possible.
 Want to mingle with meta-data engines? You could score big with meta-
data engines such as Dogpile.com and Metacrawler, which draw
resources from multiple search engines at the same time. These sites
give you a big bang for your buck by pulling from Google, MSN, Yahoo!,
and others. The drawback is that fewer consumers use these engines.
145
Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers
The mysteries of the unknown
See Unknown Search Engines item in the list in
Figure 8-4. AWStats compiles this number from
URLs that use a syntax similar to known search
engines, like Google and Yahoo!, but that are not
predefined as a search engine in the AWStats
database. (Syntax in this context means the
ordering of elements in the URL.) Although you
should keep an eye out for major fluctuations in
this number, you can generally assume that
these unknown engines are not worth their
weight in gold.

Driving more traffic
You can tell that the sample Web site is listed in Yahoo!’s index because it
receives some traffic (however paltry) from the search behemoth. In this
example, Yahoo! gets about half of the number of Web searches as Google yet
draws only 6 visitors to this site compared with Google’s 748. So, you can
conclude that there is room to grow referrals from Yahoo!.
You can do this in one of three ways: Increase your paid search spend on
Yahoo!, optimize your site design for Yahoo!, or optimize your copywriting by
using keywords and phrases in the text that draw the type of traffic you’re
hoping for. The first option costs money, the second option takes time, and
the third option requires some common sense and a perhaps a little creativity.
 Increase your paid search. Increasing your paid search is a knee-jerk
reaction to driving more traffic, and for good reason — it often works. In
order to make wise investment decisions, however, you need to become
a master keyword analyzer. You need to know not only what engines are
driving traffic, but more specifically, what keywords and key phrases do
the trick.
 Optimize your site design. Search engine spiders, however complex, are
still just computer algorithms that respond in predictable ways when
you know what triggers them. You can start optimizing your Web site by
learning how to properly use page titles, heading tags, and image alt
tags. (Alt tags, short for Alternative Text Tags, appear in place of images
when the browser preferences are set for text only. Alt tags allow visu-
ally impaired visitors to use speech synthesizers to read the text aloud.)
Adding keywords to these three areas can really get you on track for
search engine success.
 Optimize your copywriting. Search engine optimization strategies often
include posting articles on your Web site that are rich with keywords
that you expect visitors to use when searching for what you have to
offer. For example, if you sell organic dog food, you might write articles
that use the phrase organic dog food and vegetarian dog food over and
over again in the context of the article. Your product descriptions and
other content would use the same keyword and key phrase strategy.
Although you can use strategies for optimizing your Web site to appeal to
particular search engines, proceed with caution. The changes you make
could potentially lower your rankings with a competitive Web site. Be sure 
to explore and fully understand search engine optimization strategies before
giving your site a makeover that could leave your face black with backfire.
Also be sure to record your search engine rankings before and after any
changes so that you can measure the impact. Alas, that is the subject of 
an entirely different book. For a complete guide on search engines, pick up 
a copy of Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, Second Edition (Peter
Kent; Wiley).

Beyond Search Engines: Where Else
Is My Traffic Coming From?
Search engines are central to any discussion of online marketing campaigns
and rightfully so. This is one of the most effective ways to get the word out
about your products and services. However, search engine traffic is not the
end all of site referrers. You should also examine other sources of traffic, espe-
cially when that traffic is coming in droves. Remember that your Web analyt-
ics tool asks each and every visitor, “How did you find out about us?” Now it’s
your job to take the time to listen to the answer. The URLs offer clues that
could help you locate buried treasure that wasn’t even on your map.
When in doubt, click. If you don’t immediately recognize a referring site listed
in your referrer list, just click the URL to find out in a snap. You might discover
a new ally, an old friend, or a hostile blogger set on tarnishing your reputation.
When you begin to take a closer look at your site referrers, you will quickly
figure out what the top Internet marketing gurus already know: You can’t take
anything for granted on the World Wide Web. That’s why Web analytics firms
are springing up to cash in on folks like you who are beginning to realize that
more is going on behind the scenes of your Web site than meets the eye. You
can determine quite a lot from reviewing your list of non-search engine site
referrers, including
 Winning marketing methods: By taking a look at site referrers, you can
determine how much traffic came from your e-mail campaign, how much
came from your link partners, how much came from your Web rings, and
so on.
147
Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers
Keyword strategies and tactics
Keywords are critical drivers of both natural
and paid search. Savvy Web site owners can
write Web site content that makes strategic use
of keywords and key phrases that specifically
relate to their products and services. A pet
products store, for example, should be sure to
experiment with keywords and key phrases that
relate to their unique products, like personalized
leashes or organic dog food.
Web site owners can also execute paid search
campaigns through Google, Yahoo!, and other
engines. Paid search requires an owner to pay
a fee that ranges from a few cents to a few dol-
lars for each visitor who comes to that site
through the advertised keywords. Whether you
depend on a natural or a paid search, under-
standing which keywords are driving traffic —
and where that traffic originated — is vital to
choosing and maintaining keywords that grab
the attention of searchers. For more information
on keywords and key phrases, see Chapter 12.

 Accidental traffic: With just a quick glance at your site referrer list, you
might discover that visitors are being sent to your domain by folks
you’ve never even heard of. In Figure 8-5, for example, you can see that
the sample site has referrers that include the popular online encyclope-
dia Wikipedia. This is a growing collection of information that includes
links to Web sites that are relevant to the subject matter entries. Could
your site be among them? Who else is doing you a favor by linking to
your site?
 Linkage control: Much the same as favorable accidental referrers, you
might discover some unfavorable referrers. In other words, folks out
there might talk negatively about your products and services. They
could link to you from a blog or a message board in the midst of a rant.
This is not the kind of traffic you want, and such posts should be
addressed.
Table 8-1 looks at the pros and cons of some non-search referrers, and the
sections that follow discuss them in more depth.

Table 8-1
Non-Search Referrer Pros and Cons
Referrer Type
Description
Link-building campaigns
Link-building campaigns are often free, but these initia-
tives can be extremely time consuming. Web analytics
is key to strategic time management because it takes
the guesswork out of what’s working. Paid link cam-
paigns can be costly, so once again, measurement is
key to moving forward.
Web rings
Web rings are free but not always practical. Web
rings force you to put a link to the next member in the
Web ring, which could ugly up your site. Web rings
could also force you to link to a competitor.
E-mail campaigns
E-mail campaigns have the potential to reach several
thousands of potential visitors — if you have your e-mail
addresses. However, Web analytics tracks only those
visitors who came from Web-based e-mail programs.
Measuring the value of link
building campaigns
Some Internet marketers consider link building one of the most important
strategies for getting direct click-through traffic and improved search engine
rankings. Link building is simply creating quality inbound links to your Web
site. Search engines look at link popularity (the number and quality of incom-
ing links pointing to your site) as a factor in Web site rankings. That’s one
reason why link building has evolved from a friendly practice of “You link to
me; I’ll link to you” to a strategic business opportunity for link building cam-
paign service providers.
Link-building strategies abound, such as getting listed on partner sites, in e-
zines, and in press release syndication. Because link popularity is what gets
you into the search engine’s elite listings (first-page positioning is where you
want to be), you need to understand how your link building campaigns are
panning out. Whether you’re a do-it-yourself link builder or you outsource to
a pro with a track record for success, the results will speak for themselves in
your analytics. Once again, it’s Web analytics to the rescue.
149
Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers

Looking for some time-tested, link building strategies? At your disposal are
literally scores of techniques savvy link builders can use. Here are ten solid
strategies for your repertoire:
 E-mail the Webmaster of a complementary site and ask for a link trade.
 Incorporate link partnerships with resellers, partners, and vendors.
 Become a content provider.
 Issue online press releases.
 Buy text link ads.
 Submit articles to syndication sites.
 Launch an affiliate program.
 Start a blog and get on other bloggers’ blogrolls.
 Post on discussion forums and include your URL in your signature.
 Create awards programs for related sites, and place winner logo links on
an awards page the winner can link back to.
Keep a list of Web sites with which you have arranged link swaps. Then make
a note of any special campaigns, like online press releases. Now scan your
Web analytics tool’s External Links list for these specific URLs to see which
allies and purchased links send the most traffic to your site. The traffic might
fluctuate from month to month depending on how much traffic your partner
site generates. A review over a 3–6 month period offers the big picture that
lets you make long-term decisions.
Look at the AWStats list of referring pages in Figure 8-2. In the sample site, the
Endurance.net home page sent about 25 percent of the traffic to Equestrian
Mag.com. The site scored those 87 hits by providing content to this leading
online resource for endurance and distance riding. A headline on the home
page links back to an article on EquestrianMag.com. The rest is Web analytics
history. Although you can’t expect Endurance.net to send the same number
of visitors once the article is bumped from the home page to the archives, you
can measure the traffic impact of providing content to this strategic partner.
Are my Web rings really working?
Web rings are an age-old (if there is such an applicable adjective for anything
on the Internet) but not forgotten form of link building. Web rings are a collec-
tion of independently owned Web sites with similar topics that are purposely
150
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

linked to help generate traffic for the entire group. When a visitor finds one
Web site in the ring, he can click a link on the page that sends him to the next
site in the group. Web rings have the potential to drive high volumes of traf-
fic, so this aspect of link building deserves special attention in any Web ana-
lytics review.
How do you tell whether your Web ring is working? Just record the URL of the
Web site before and after yours and look for this domain in your Links from
External Sites metric. The resulting traffic might also come from the URL of
the actual Web ring or from some other member in the ring. You can discover
those referrers by clicking the URL to verify the source. If your analysis con-
sistently shows little to no traffic, or poor quality traffic, you might want to
opt-out of your Web ring and rid yourself of the obligation of sending traffic
to what could be a competitor.
Counting click-throughs
from e-mail campaigns
For opt-in e-mail marketers and e-newsletter publishers, counting click-
throughs generated from e-mail distributions is one component of fine-tuning
your tactics. Web analytics arms you with the data you need to make deci-
sions. If you consistently get a low response rate, perhaps you’re not getting
your message to the right target audience, or maybe your messaging needs a
stronger call to action. Your Web analytics tools also ante up metrics that
draw potential advertisers to your e-mail newsletter. You can figure all that
out later. Right now, you just need to get a clear picture of how many sub-
scribers are visiting your Web site as a result of your e-mail campaigns.
151
Chapter 8: Reviewing Site Referrers
Watch out for referrer spam
Referrer spam is spamming aimed at analytics
watchers. This dastardly technique involves
making Web site requests over and over again
by using a fake referrer URL that points to a
spam site with an advertisement. These sinister
spammers are betting that you’ll see their URL
on your analytics tool and click through to try to
figure out why they’re linking to you. The spam-
mers’ goal is to build traffic to their sites and try
to convert you on one of their (typically shady)
offerings. After you identify referrer spam, raise
a red flag. You can even use filtering and block-
ing tools to ban these unwelcome, bogus site
referrers. We take a closer look at this issue in
Chapter 7.

Before you get too excited, we need to give you a heads up on the limitations
of Web analytics for tracking e-mail campaigns. Here’s the deal: This data
shows only links from Web mail. It will not show how many visitors linked to
your site from a desktop e-mail application, such as Microsoft Outlook. Web
analytics won’t track how many times subscribers open the e-mail you sent
them, either. Don’t worry, though: You can find services designed to offer
detailed e-mail campaign reporting on the market. You can find a list of these
in Chapter 6.
So what do site referrers from your e-mail campaigns look like? You can find
them quickly by looking for URLs that include the word email, webmail, or
mail. Here are a few examples:
 http://email.secureserver.net/view.php
 http://us.f327.mail.yahoo.com/ym/ShowLetter
 http://by101fd.bay101.hotmail.msn.com/cgi-bin/getmsg
 http://webmail.bellsouth.net/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/
AppLogic+mobmain
 http://webmail.tm.net.my/frame.html
This traffic is most often generated by users clicking a link in your newsletter
or e-mail promotion via Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail, or some other Web mail ser-
vice. If you haven’t sent newsletters or e-mail campaigns and still see these
site referrers, your visitor was probably encouraged to check out your site by
a friend or associate who posted a link to your site in her e-mail.

 Betting on browser data
You’re probably familiar with the golden rule of real estate. (For those of
you who are scratching your heads right about now, here’s a hint: loca-
tion, location, location.) Well, having valuable Internet real estate — also
known as a stellar domain name — is a good place start, but it’s not enough
to guarantee success. To win in an ultra-competitive online environment, you
also need to exercise the golden rule of customer service: Listen, listen,
listen. Online or offline: To succeed in the business world, you need to listen
to your customers to find out what they like, what they don’t like, what they
would like if you offered it, and so on.
We can hear your objections now: “Sure, that’s easy for an online customer
support center, but what if my visitors never bother to e-mail me? What if I
don’t have live chat? How am I supposed to know what my visitors are think-
ing if they don’t tell me? I’m not a mindreader!” Never fear, Web analytics is
here to serve as your secret agent. Although you won’t get a list of physical
traits (height, weight, hair color, and so on) in the form of a dossier. The
information that Web analytics offers is, in many ways, even more telling.
Web analytics offers the promise of visitor segmentation, which groups users
based on similar traits or activities. After you segment your visitors, you can
compare behavior of one group of visitors with another group of visitors as
well as to the broader visitor population. You can segment your visitors into
any number of categories, from geographic region to language preference to
the age group or even job or income classifications they chose on a registra-
tion form. You can explore how first-time visitors behave in the checkout
process compared with loyal customers. The ultimate goal is to increase con-
version rates — that percentage of visitors who take the desired action on your
site — of your visitors by making adjustments that better serve their needs.

154
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 
With that said, read on to discover how to find the data you need to better
understand your visitors and serve them at higher levels than your closest
competitor, who really is only three clicks away. Because of its unique visitor
segmentation features and its affordability, we illustrate our examples with
ClickTracks Web analytics software to demonstrate visitor segmentation prin-
ciples throughout this chapter.
Gleaning from Your Visitors’ Past
Through Web analytics, online ventures enjoy customer service advantages
that are difficult, if not impossible or at least not affordable, for most to attain
in the bricks-and-mortar world. Sure, a suit retailer can ask everyone who
walks through the door where he was before he decided to drive over, and the
answer could be somewhat helpful. If he came from a fine restaurant, you can
deduce he’s probably got plenty of money to spend on one of your more
expensive suits. If he came from a burger joint, you might come to the oppo-
site conclusion. Of course, even still, you are merely making assumptions (and
you know what they say about folks who make assumptions). What’s more,
the customer might not wish to tell you where he just came from — and possi-
bly get offended if you ask — or maybe even tell you a bold-faced lie.
Using Web analytics, however, takes the guesswork out of your visitors’ past
and offers reliable insights that could help you convert them at higher rates.
Web analytics offers information, such as the URL of the site that the visitor
came from. This is also known as the referring site. You can also discern the
search terms visitors use to find your site as well as what country they came
from. Collecting this data forms the foundation of visitor segmentation.
Paying attention to where your visitors came from can tell you plenty about
them. For an exhaustive exercise in reviewing your site referrer reports, read
Chapter 8. For this section, we focus on how the referrer reports can help
you segment your visitors. First, get your list of referring sites from your Web
analytics software. In ClickTracks, follow these steps:
1. Open the ClickTracks application.
If the site you want to look at is already open in the ClickTracks dash-
board, go to Step 2.
Otherwise, you need to open the dataset for the specific site you want to
review.
a. Choose File➪Open Dataset (or press Ctrl+O).
b. Navigate to your dataset file.

By default, the file is saved in the My Documents➪ClickTracks
Datasets folder, and it usually looks something like yourwebsite-
com.tks.
2. Click the Change Dates button in the middle of the home screen to
select the dates you want to analyze.
3. Click the Site Overview button.
4. Scroll down until you find a section titled Top Referrers (see Figure 9-1).
As you can see in Figure 9-1, ClickTracks does not separate the search
engine referrers from non-search engine referrers. If you want to see only
the non-search engine referrers, try using AWStats to look at your referrers.
You can find detailed instructions for AWStats referrer lookup in Chapter 8.
With your analytics program open, take some time to familiarize yourself
with the sites on your site referrer report. You can safely conclude that your
visitors trusted the sites that referred them to you enough to click through.
Now consider the following questions to glean from your visitors’ past:
 Are the referring sites targeting consumers, or are they business-to-
business–focused?
 Does the referring site target a particular gender or nationality in 
particular?
 How tech-savvy do those Web sites require their visitors to be?
 Did your visitors enter your site by clicking a link in an e-mail?
 Did a separate URL you own and have pointed to your Web site bring
them in?
Figure 9-1:

Referrers
section in
ClickTracks.
155
Chapter 9: Getting to Know Your Visitors

By answering questions like these, you can discover characteristics about
your visitors that you might not have thought to consider otherwise. For
example, if many of the referring sites to your content portal have a business-
to-business focus but your site is largely targeted toward consumer news,
you may have an untapped opportunity in business readers. If you operate a
travel site but you see that you receive a good number of hits from golf sites,
you might want to consider adding a section specifically for golf travel. If you
find that many of the referring sites use technology that you previously
avoided because you felt it was too “techie” for your users, maybe it’s safe to
begin implementing some new technology you’ve been wanting to explore,
such as steaming video or downloads.
Searching for Significance
Visitor search terms are perhaps the most intriguing and valuable data that
Web analytics produce. Search terms provide a very clear answer to a very
clear question: What is your visitor looking for? In a bricks-and-mortar retail
store, the very first question you hear from a sales person is often, “Can I
help you find something?” Sound familiar?
Every visitor who is referred to your site through a search engine comes in
the door with that answer in hand. It’s up to you to look at the reports to
determine popular search terms; find requests for products, services or infor-
mation that are related to what you offer on your Web site but don’t sell (and
could potentially profit from adding); and refer off-the-wall requests to
respected partners who might to do the same for you.
156
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 
When the cookie crumbles
For all the Web analytics myths and mistakes,
misconceptions about cookies are making it
more difficult to measure unique visitors.
Cookies are small files that hold information on
times and dates when a user visits your Web
site. Examples are log-in or registration infor-
mation, online shopping cart data, user prefer-
ences, and the like. Cookies allows online
vendors such as Amazon.com to recognize you,
serving you a list of personalized product rec-
ommendations. Until you register, Amazon
knows very little about you and can’t target its
marketing efforts to your sweet spots.
Cookies are invaluable to Web site owners and
can be convenient for users, but the fear of spy-
ware leads many consumers to rid themselves
of the files. In fact, a survey conducted by
market 
research 
firm 
JupiterResearch
(www.jupiterresearch.com) found that
as much as 39 percent of U.S. Web surfers
delete cookies from their computers at least
once per month, with 17 percent erasing cook-
ies once per week and 10 percent cleaning
them out daily. That means the sheer number of
your unique visitors could fluctuate dramatically
over a 30-day period.

Once again, we use ClickTracks in this chapter because it offers a robust view
of the reports we are discussing. To find your Web site’s top search keywords
(terms entered into the search box of a search engine) in ClickTracks, just
follow these steps:
1. Open the ClickTracks application.
If the site you want to look is already open in the ClickTracks dashboard,
go to the next step. Otherwise, you will need to open the dataset for
your site.
a. Choose File➪Open Dataset (or press Ctrl+O).
b. Navigate to your dataset file.
By default, the file is saved in the My Documents➪ClickTracks
Datasets folder, and it usually looks something like yourwebsite
com.tks.
2. Click the Change Dates button in the middle of the home screen to
select the dates you want to analyze.
3. Click the Site Overview button.
4. Scroll down until you find a section titled Top Search Keywords (see
Figure 9-2).
Figure 9-2:
The Top
Search
Keywords
section in
ClickTracks.
157
Chapter 9: Getting to Know Your Visitors

Figure 9-2 shows the Top Search Keywords report for AKCStandard.com
for a one-week period. Notice some of the surprising search terms in this
report, such as commercial actress for 1800petmeds, or the informational
requests like dollars in the U.S. spent on pet apparel that probably came
from a student doing a research report.
Determine popular search terms
The first step in your quest to benefit from referring search terms is to deter-
mine popular search terms or phrases that correlate to the products or ser-
vices you offer. Then you can give more weight to those sections by adding
more content or by featuring them more prominently on your site.
For example, if you operate an online bookstore and you see that the number
of search queries for a particular author is increasing, consider adding a spe-
cial section to the site just for that author. If you are a marketing communica-
tions firm and you see significant numbers of searches for press release
writing, beef up the descriptive content in that section using those keywords.
This is one aspect of search engine optimization — a method of improving the
rankings for relevant keywords in search results by making changes to the
content or navigational structure of a Web site. For an in-depth look at this
subject, check out Search Engine Optimization For Dummies by Peter Kent
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Find requests for products, services, and
information you don’t yet offer
The second step in your search for significant search terms is to find
requests for products, services, or information that are related to what you
offer on your Web site but that don’t qualify as a match made in heaven.
Pretend that you have a Web site that focuses narrowly on selling historical
books. (There’s certainly enough of them out there to fill several libraries.)
Now, imagine you’ve reviewed your referring search terms and find that sev-
eral people were searching for books on Japanese history — a category you
hadn’t thought to offer.
Of course, just because a few folks wanted books on Japanese history doesn’t
necessarily mean you should rush to add that category. Like with any busi-
ness decision, you need to weigh the risks and the rewards. The last thing
you want to do is stock an item or add employees to your firm to perform a
158
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

service for which there isn’t a strong demand. So, while you search for new
opportunities in your keywords and keyphrases (a collection of terms entered
into the search box of a search engine), be sure to put what you find into 
context. Is it an ongoing trend? Do you get requests for Japanese history
books (or what ever you peddle) frequently? Or was it a fluke?
Referring off-the-wall requests
As you review your keywords and keyphrases reports, you are sure to stum-
ble upon at least a few terms that represent requests for products, services,
or information that you have no intention of ever offering. Such requests
might even be related to your products, services, or content tangentially, but
you just have no interest in including them in your repertoire.
When that’s the case, you still don’t have to waste the opportunity that Web
analytics affords you. You could take the chance to build your referrer part-
ner network. If it’s possible, add a link to a related resource that you can gen-
uinely recommend. Part of good customer service is being able to help
customers solve problems, even when you don’t profit from the solution. If
you can refer visitors to a site that will help them, it can build brand loyalty
for your site and build strong ties with referrer partners who might do the
same for you. Think of it as paying it forward: It comes back to you.
Gleaning from Clickstreams and Labeling
Also called navigational paths, clickstreams — the recorded path, page by
page, of the pages a visitor requested while navigating through a Web site —
can speak volumes. If Sally Visitor came in your virtual doors through a
Google search for leather handbags, you’ll see that. If she went to the shoe
section afterward, you’ll see that, too. You can tell at what point she entered
items into the shopping cart and whether she viewed your return policy. Her
entire visit on the site is mapped out, step by step. What’s more, you can also
see how long Sally spent on each of the pages she visited.
Clickstream analysis helps you make decisions about your site in many ways.
For example
 You can get some clues about product affinities that you hadn’t dis-
covered. Maybe you want to offer a few matching pairs of shoes on the
handbags page for Sally to consider.
159
Chapter 9: Getting to Know Your Visitors

 You can tell you how many customers are concerned about your
return policy, and how long they spent reading it. If they abandoned
the site after reading your return policy, you have a clue that they didn’t
like what they read.
 You can tell which keywords led to the most conversions and which
led to the highest sales.
Putting a magnifying glass on your clickstream can offer you a virtually end-
less list of combinations, especially when you use Web analytics software
that allows you to label visitors and segment them accordingly. Some Web
analytics tools incorporate the clickstream analysis to put visitor behavior
into context and compare one group of visitors to another.
As we mention earlier, ClickTracks offers some fairly sophisticated tools on a
budget price. One of them is Visitor Segmentation. Using the ClickTracks
labeling features takes the headache out of grouping users into custom
groups and analyzing those visitor segments. Labeling features are conve-
niently located on the application home page or dashboard in ClickTracks. To
access them, just follow these steps:
1. Open the ClickTracks application.
If the site you want to look is already open in the ClickTracks dashboard,
go to the next step.
Otherwise, you will need to open the dataset for your site.
a. Choose File➪Open Dataset (or press Ctrl+O).
b. Navigate to your dataset file.
By default, the file is saved in the My Documents➪ClickTracks
Datasets folder, and it usually looks something like yourwebsite-
com.tks.
In the center column is the Enhance Reports section. That section
includes the buttons for Quick Labels and Advanced Labels. (See Figure
9-3.) Quick Labels offers you a simple way to get started with labels.
2. Click the Quick Labels buttons to open the Label Wizard, as shown in
Figure 9-4.
This includes such options as Reached Checkout, New vs. Returning
Visitor, Compare Search engines, and Short Length Visit. These options
will initiate you into the concept of seeing data by custom defined
groups.

Chapter 9: Getting to Know Your Visitors

As you progress in your Web analytics experience, you should eventually
move to Advanced Labeling, which lets you group users by a wide variety of
metrics. You can see how groups of users behaved based on which page they
entered the site. You can group users by the search engine query they used
to find your site. You can even define a group by combinations of these met-
rics. For example, you could analyze data for only users who came from
Google and viewed the About page on your site. The possibilities are virtually
endless.
Wow! My Site Has Multinational
Appeal!
The World Wide Web isn’t called the World Wide Web for nothing. Your Web
site has the potential to reach New York City corporate moguls, Asian manu-
facturing workers browsing the Web from a cell phone, Latin American taxi
drivers who frequent Internet cafes and many, many others. It’s pretty cool to
see all the different flags represented in your country report. But how do
these Web analytics really help your site? The truth is, they might or might
not help you at all, or they could unlock new levels of profitability. Here’s
how to discover the difference:
 Define your target market. You should know who your target market is
before you ever launch your Web site, of course. As you review the coun-
try report in your analytics tools, though, keep your target market in
mind.
162
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 
One niche, many segments
Even if your site has an extremely narrow focus
(say, horses), you’ll probably find many different
visitor groups searching through its pages.
Sostre & Associates property Equestrianmag.
com, for example, serves several different user
groups, including children looking for informa-
tion about horses for a school report, horse
owners looking for health care tips for their
pets, and professional riders looking for the
latest event results. Visitor segmentation is
important even within highly targeted sites
because it will show you who your biggest fans
are. Then you can gear your products, services,
and content to the visitors who represent the
highest conversions.

 What are your multinational visitors doing? Now, review the click-
stream analysis on your site to see what these foreign visitors are doing
and how they are behaving. Are they flocking to certain products or ser-
vices? Or are they just visiting for a few seconds and then leaving? Are
visitors from some countries converting at higher rates than others.
 Serve country-specific needs. If your products and services are avail-
able only in the United States but you have considerable numbers of vis-
itors from other countries browsing through them, perhaps you should
begin catering to this market with offering international shipping, or
even launch a separate site that caters to certain countries specifically,
with their culture and language in mind.
 Consider translating your site. Are you getting droves of customers
from Latin America or China? It could be time to consider getting your
site’s content translated into the native languages for some of your top
non–English-speaking countries. Finding translation services online has
become easier than ever, a quick Google search for the phrase Web site
translation service will yield many results for you to choose from.
Betting on Browser Data
If you aren’t a Web developer or programmer, tracking the technical details
behind your Web site’s visitors probably isn’t on your list of top ten favorite
analytics categories to review. It’s true that these aren’t the sexiest stats in
the log. In fact, sometimes this data is not worth wasting your time on. Of
course, there are two sides to every story, and it’s also true that you can find
some valuable nuggets of information in this miscellaneous data. In fact, in
some cases, what you glean from the technical details can have a positive
effect on future Web site development and positioning efforts.
Monitoring browser usage
Microsoft’s Internet Explorer (IE) is the top dog when it comes to browsers,
but with more and more users moving to alternatives such as Firefox, Opera,
and others, what does that mean for your site? Web analytics can give you
some clues.
Just the facts, ma’am (Or sir)
First, consider the facts. According to an OneStat.com report issued in
November 2006, IE accounted for 85 percent of all browser usage around the
world. Its next closest competitor, Mozilla’s open source Firefox browser,
163
Chapter 9: Getting to Know Your Visitors

accounted for about 12 percent of global browser usage. Apple’s Safari
browser trails behind at 1.8 percent, Opera scraped together 1 percent, and
the rest are too small to really count. From month to month, those figures
don’t change all that much and few predict that Microsoft will lose its
browser crown, despite alternative browser momentum.
Compare and contrast
Compare the global OneStat.com estimate with what you see in your own
Web site statistics. If you use AWStats to gather your Web site’s statistical
treasures, follow these steps to find browser usage statistics for your visitors:
1. Point your browser to the control panel.
Generally, you can access your cPanel installation by typing in your URL
followed by a slash and cpanel. Here’s an example:
http://www.yoururl.com/cpanel
That URL will probably direct you to another URL that corresponds with
your Web hosting provider, so don’t be alarmed if the URL changes.
If you know that your hosting company offers cPanel but the preceding
instructions above don’t take you anywhere, you might need to contact
your hosting company to get the URL for your cPanel installation.
2. Enter your username and password.
You are greeted with a pop-up box that instructs you to enter your Name
and Password. (See Figure 9-5.) You can choose to select a check box
that offers to remember your password so you don’t have to enter it in
the next time around. (If you’ve already forgotten your name and pass-
word, of if you never knew what they were to begin with, contact your
Web hosting provider for details.)
Figure 9-5:

3. Click Log In to gain access to the control panel.
4. Locate the AWStats section.
The AWStats section is located in the center column —, the second cate-
gory, named Web/FTP Stats.
5. Open AWStats.
6. Find Miscellaneous data.
Look at the column to the right, towards the bottom, for the Navigation
category. Under that, you’ll see Browsers.
7. Click the blue link for Browsers.
You’re in business.
With your analytics program open, review your browser statistics. If you dis-
cover that browser usage for your site is pretty close to the data from the
OneStat.com report, you know that you’re serving a fair representative group
of Web users. On the other hand, if you find that alternative browser usage is
much higher, you might want to consider the possibility that your audience is
more tech-savvy and then take that into account when deciding what tech-
nologies and features to add to your site. You might even want to consider
optimizing your site for that browser.
Mulling over miscellaneous browser data
With your AWStats analytics report open, scroll down to the navigational list
on the left hand side until you see the Others category. There, you will find
what the program dubs Miscellaneous data. As it relates to browsers, this
could offer some important insights under certain circumstances.
You’ll find stats on browsers, like how many visitors used browsers with sup-
port for Java, Macromedia Director, Flash, Real Audio, or some other type of
plug-in. If you’re thinking about adding some fancy stuff to your Web site,
such as streaming videos or Flash components, you might want to review
these stats first. If you find that nobody has the plug-ins that would support
your high-tech dreams, you likely want to avoid the nightmare of annoying
visitors with pop-up messages telling them they can’t view your site without
special software.

E
very professional sports team has its all-stars. These Very Important
People (VIPs) get paid much more than their teammates because manage-
ment believes they make a greater impact on the game than the rest of the
pack. Although sports fundamentalists may not agree with the inflated salaries,
few would leave Dwayne Wade or LeBron James off their NBA Fantasy League
rosters. Their productivity stats — rebounds per game, points per game, min-
utes per game — prove that individual player’s worth to the overall team.
Much the same, stats also prove an individual Web page’s worth to the overall
site. Indeed, every Web site has its VIPs, or Very Important Pages. If you want to
look at it in terms of productivity, think of the Pareto Principle, better known as
the 80/20 rule. This rule states that in anything, a few (20 percent) are vital, and
many (80 percent) are trivial. Twenty percent of the people do 80 percent of the
work; 20 percent of your tasks account for 80 percent of your income; and so on.
Using the Pareto Principle as a guideline, it is likely that 20 percent of your
pages are generating 80 percent of your revenue, subscribers, or leads. That’s
okay as long as you learn to identify which pages do the heavy lifting. And
that’s where Web analytics comes into the game. The software doesn’t leave
room for opinion: It makes no bones about which pages are most productive
and therefore deserve the coveted VIP status.
In this chapter, you discover how to identify which pages bring your visitors
back again and again — and which pages keep them there the longest — 
as well as how to spot pages that might send your visitors running to a 
competitor’s site. Our goal with this chapter is to help you define which

pages bring the most value to your Web site so you can try to duplicate the
success of those pages in other areas.
It’s Not a Popularity Contest — Or Is It?
No doubt about it: Some pages on your Web site are simply more popular than
others. Few visitors might actually read an e-commerce vendor’s privacy policy,
for example, but the return policy page could see heavy traffic during the holi-
day season. An online news portal might see less traffic to its World News page
during the World Series, but the sports section might near bandwidth overload.
Some pages on your Web site are likely to be more popular than others
regardless of what big event or seasonal reason people have to visit. A quick
scan at your Web analytics dashboard will probably reveal that your home
page is one of the most popular, if not the most popular, page on the site
because it’s the Web address you use in most of your offline advertising ini-
tiatives. Face it, though — your home page is only the door. Your primary
interest in this popularity contest is landing pages and other pages beyond
the home page. A landing page is a specific Web page at which a visitor first
arrives in response to organic search or paid search initiatives. To discover
ways to measure your organic and paid search initiatives, read Chapter 14.
If your Web site markets your services — maybe you are a consultant, den-
tist, accountant, or attorney — you might discover that your About Us page
gets much more traffic than your Contact Us page. That makes sense because
prospects want to know more about you before they engage your services. 
If your bio page is boring or fails to illustrate your expertise (complete with
fancy certifications, awards, and the like), you could be losing prospects no
matter how strong your homepage is.
Insights like the About Us revelation make judging the Web page popularity
contest well worth your time. That’s the good news. The even-better news 
is that it doesn’t even have to take much time. Google Analytics, which we
discuss at length in Chapter 5, makes it automatic with a report titled Top
Content. This report displays your top Web pages based on how many
unique views they tallied.(For more on unique views, see Chapter 2.)
If you use Google Analytics to track your Web site statistics, you can access
the Google Analytics Top Content report by following these steps:
1. Open Google Analytics.
Because this tool is Web-based, opening the application is as easy 
as dialing up the URL and logging in. Simply visit www.google.com/
analytics and log in, using your e-mail address and password (see
Figure 10-1). If you don’t have a Google Analytics account, see our
instructions for registering in Chapter 5.

2. Opening reports for the domain you want to analyze.
When you log in to Google Analytics, you are escorted to your analytics
settings page. Whether you are using this freebie tool to track 1 Web site
or 20, the list of your sites is displayed in the Website Profiles section.
Now find the Web site you want to review.
3. Click the View Reports link, shown in Figure 10-2.
After you click the View Reports link for your Web site, you are sent to
the Executive Overview Dashboard.
4. Click the All Reports heading for the Content Optimization category.
When you click this, a list of subcategories drops down. The report
you’re looking for is beneath the Content Performance subcategory.
5. Click Content Performance.
Voilà! A list of reports appears. The first report on the list is your Top
Content report.
6. Open the Top Content Report.
Just click the report name to open it up, and the results of your Web site’s
popularity contest are revealed. (See Figure 10-3 for an example report.)

You can also choose to sort your Top Content report by pageviews (a record
of each time a visitor views a Web page on your site), average time on page, or
the percent of users who exit at that page. Although the default sort order of
unique views is the default for good reason — it clearly defines the most vis-
ited pages — you might want to look at the pages from another angle to 
put the story into context.
Google obliges by letting you view the Top Content sorted by which pages
have the highest average time on page and the percent of users who exit the
site on these “top” pages. You might discover that one of the so-called top
pages in this report has a 95-percent exit rate and really doesn’t belong in 
the winner’s circle after all.
Which Pages Drive Your Traffic?
The pages that are most popular and the pages that drive the majority of
your traffic could be two entirely different sets of pages. In other words, 
just because half your visitors browse your sneaker section doesn’t mean
that they stayed there long. Maybe it took them longer to pick out jackets
than shoes. Perhaps your selection of jackets is larger, or maybe you just
have picky customers. (Web analytics hasn’t figured out how to tell how 
persnickety your customers are yet, but you as the Web site owner know 
the breadth of your product selection and can infer some insights from 
the comparison.)
The pages that drive most of your traffic are probably pages that visitors
found while searching for products and services on the Internet rather than
by browsing through internal site pages that link to one another. Most visi-
tors probably find your Web site through organic or paid search. Organic
search is an online search that retrieves results by indexing pages based on
content and keyword relevancy. Paid search, or pay per click, is a method
that retrieves listings based on who paid the most money for keywords to
appear at the top of the heap.
Whether you pay for your traffic or depend on high page ranks and well-
optimized content to send visitors your way free of charge, you need to 
know which pages drive most of your traffic. If the wrong pages are generating
the greatest visitor counts, you might not wind up converting those visitors.
And by the wrong pages, we mean pages with your least important content. 
You aren’t hosting traffic just for the heck of it. The name of the game is 
conversions.
171
Chapter 10: Identifying Your Most Important Pages

If you discover that your most popular pages aren’t converting visitors into
customers, consider embarking on a search engine optimization (SEO) cam-
paign. SEO is a method of improving the rankings for relevant keywords in
search results by making changes to the content or navigational structure of
a Web site. Pick up Wiley’s Search Engine Optimization For Dummies to read
more about this hot topic.
Of course, generating traffic is only part of the equation. Bounce rates — a
metric that shows the percentage of entrances on any individual page that
resulted in the visitor’s immediate exit from the site — also play a role in
your popularity contest. In order to earn the title VIP, your most-popular
pages should not only attract lots of traffic but also entice visitors to surf the
site for a while. The longer they stay on your site, the better chance you have
of converting them. Web analytics offers a clear view of the big picture, so
you can be a just judge.
To avoid losing visitors to high bounce rates, you need to view a Web analyt-
ics report that clearly depicts your strong traffic-generating pages, alongside
their bounce rates. You can access the Google Analytics Entrance Bounce
Rates report by following these steps:
1. Open Google Analytics.
Go to www.google.com/analytics and log in, using your e-mail
address and password. If you don’t have a Google Analytics account, 
see our instructions for registering in Chapter 5.
2. Select your Web site.
When you log in to Google Analytics, you are escorted to your analytics
settings page. As we said before, it doesn’t matter how many sites you
are tracking. Just select the Web site you need statistics for from the
Web Site Profiles section.
3. Click the View Reports link.
After you click the View Reports link for your Web site, you are taken to
the Executive Overview Dashboard.
4. Click the Content Optimization category under the All Reports
header.
A list of subcategories drops down. The report you are looking for falls
under the Navigational Analysis subcategory.
5. Click Navigational Analysis.
A list of reports appears. The first report on the list is your Entrance
Bounce Rates report.
6. Open the Entrance Bounce Rates report.
Just click the report name to open the report. (See Figure 10-4 for an

To Err Is Human, to Fix Is Divine
When a customer sees a broken image, stumbles onto a Page Cannot be
Found error, or clicks a link that is no longer active, your Web site’s credibil-
ity takes a nose dive. Put yourself in the visitor’s shoes: You’ve been scouring
the Web for the perfect venue (to buy shoes, to read about something, or to
find a consultant who can help you launch your new product). You finally find
a Web site that looks promising only to be met with error messages. Wouldn’t
you be frustrated, too? You are lucky if those visitors try again later.
Web analytics programs are designed to help you avoid these potentially
costly faux pas by alerting you to these errors. You can discover them in a
section of your Web analytics software, named something like HTTP Error
Codes or Error Log. We recommend becoming acquainted with this report
and to look at it at least once a month. Finding the errors is not enough,
though. You also need to know what the codes mean so you can fix them 
in a hurry.
Deciphering error codes
If you’ve ever heard someone say she received a 404 code and wondered
what she meant, you are about to find out — and you need to know because
it could happen to you.

Chapter 10: Identifying Your Most Important Pages

When a visitor requests a file, the Web server records an HTTP response code.
Some response codes are good, some are bad, and some are downright ugly.
The server goes through this process every single time a visitor requests a
file. Most Web analytics applications make reference to Web site errors by
their designated HTTP response code. Because these are common and
because even well-maintained sites are liable to throw errors from time 
to time, wisdom dictates getting familiar with the errors you are likely to
encounter on the road to Web success.
Seeking success codes
Some people use the phrases response code and error codes interchangeably,
and these numerical distinctions don’t always bring bad news. Although
these success codes are reported in many Web analytics applications, the
user doesn’t generally see response codes that don’t indicate an error. They
occur behind the scenes while your browser continues to take you to the
requested file. Here is a list of non-error response codes, however, that you
might come across:
 200 OK: The page was served successfully. No additional work required.
Congrats!
 206 Partial Content: The page was loaded, but some of the content
might not have loaded properly. One common reason happens when a 
user clicks the Stop button on his browser, which stops the server from
downloading the files in midstream. In most cases, the user might not even
realize that parts of the page didn’t load. This is an error you can ignore. If
you see this error occurring frequently, however, consider optimizing your
pages or contacting the person responsible for managing your Web server.
(That’s usually your hosting company or IT department.)

Are you using the right tools?
Just like a doctor needs the right tools to 
diagnose a patient, you need the right tools to 
diagnose your Web site. In this chapter, we use
Google Analytics to check the pulse of top-
performing pages. However, this freebie tool
remains relatively silent when it comes to error
pages because it’s a hosted analytics tool.
Hosted tools rely on snippets of code placed on
your Web site pages to record individual visits.
Because broken images and missing pages
cannot be tagged, hosted applications tend to
leave you in the lurch. If you rely solely on a
hosted Web analytics tool, you might not find
out about errors on your site unless you stum-
ble upon them yourself — or unless a frustrated
customer e-mails you in the midnight hour. For a
full review of the pros and cons for the different
types of analytics tools, see Chapter 4.

 301 Moved Permanently/302 Moved Temporarily: Sometimes,
you need to redirect users from one page to another automatically. This
can happen if you have an old URL that still receives traffic, but you
want to automatically direct those users to your newer products. In
these cases, the server logs this response code while it automatically
redirects the user to another page. This usually requires no interaction
from the visitor.
 304 Not Modified: The file being requested has not changed since 
it was last accessed or cached. This code might be generated by bots
(Web crawlers) looking for new content or browsers that try to optimize
user downloads by checking whether a page has changed before updat-
ing their cache. (Read more about Web crawlers in Chapter 3.)
Deciphering error codes
Success codes are mostly good but sometimes a little bit bad. Comparatively,
error codes are often bad and can even be ugly. If you see any of the codes
described below, something went wrong. You should investigate any URLs
that display the following response codes — and fast.
 401 Unauthorized: A visitor attempted to access a password-protected
page, such as a members-only area of the site. In general, users who don’t
have a username and password won’t bother attempting to gain entry
into these areas of the site. Some might have forgotten their username 
or password. However, it could be that the page in question has been
password-protected by mistake. When that’s the case, you need to unlock
that page so all can freely partake of its contents.
 403 Forbidden: The most common reason for this error code is when
a user tried to browse a directory (view all the files within a particular
sub folder) when directory browsing is not allowed. Directory browsing
is disallowed when server administrators don’t want nosy people snoop-
ing around their directories, opening files. However, if you don’t mind
users browsing directories and accessing photos, documents, old Web
pages, and other file types posted on your site, just leave directory
browsing enabled, and you’ll never see this code.
 404 Not Found: The file in question does not exist. This is the most
commonly seen error code and can often be identified by the tell-tale
Page Cannot be Found message on the visitor’s end. Your job when
you see one of these errors in your error log is to either create the page
or image that is supposed to be there, or to make note of the referring
URLs for those missing files and update the links on those pages so that
they point to a file that does exist.
 500 Server Error: These errors are often seen when a Web applica-
tion, such as a CGI (common gateway interface) script, is configured in a
way that conflicts with the server configuration. This is the most techni-
cal of the errors and generally requires a programmer to correct.
175
Chapter 10: Identifying Your Most Important Pages

Unearthing unsightly errors
You could spend half your day browsing every single one of your Web pages
and links looking for broken pages and images. Or, you could get smart and
employ the right Web analytics tools to make unearthing unsightly errors,
such as missing pages and files, easier than pulling weeds. Several of the pop-
ular and free server-side analytics tools, including AWStats (www.awstats.
sourceforge.net) and Urchin (www.google.com/analytics/urchin_
software.html), report on error codes. If you use Urchin for your Web ana-
lytics, follow these steps to explore your Web site’s HTTP request codes:
1. Open your Urchin analytics page.
This usually involves visiting a specific URL provided by your hosting
company or navigating to the system through a Web-based control
panel, such as cPanel. If you don’t know how to access your Urchin 
analytics account, ask your hosting company for specific instructions.
When you access Urchin analytics, you see a pane in the upper-left side
of the page labeled Reports. The first option in that list is Traffic, which
might already be open by default. The second bold option in the list
should be labeled Pages & Files.
2. Click Pages & Files.
You see a drop-down list of related reports, one of which will be Status
and Errors.
3. Click the Status and Errors report to open it.
The results appear in the main section of the screen.
4. View files resulting in Page Cannot be Found errors for users.
After the report is open, it shows a list of Status and Error codes, some of
which will have an arrow next to them that you can click for more detail.
176
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 
Common files in the 404 report
Two files that almost always appear in the 404
error report: favicon.ico and robots.
txt.
 favicon.ico: This is a file requested by
Web browsers. Browsers use it to display a
custom icon for your Web site in the
address bar and bookmark lists. Most Web
sites do not have this file; if you don’t, it’s
really no big deal.
 robots.txt: Search engine spiders
look at this file prior to accessing your site.
robots.txt tells spiders which pages
they can and cannot access on your site. If
you don’t need to restrict search engines
spiders from any areas of your site, you
don’t need a robots.txt file.
Read about spiders in Chapter 3.

5. Look for the line that reads 404:Not Found, under the Status and
Error column header.
6. Click the arrow to the left of that row.
The report refreshes with a list of URLs that are generating this error for
users. (See Figure 10-5 for an example report.)
After you have a list of files that are generating 404 errors, you can proceed
to clean up the mess before any more of your users encounter the broken
files and before your site loses any more credibility.
Working with Dynamic Pages
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) will always play a role in Web design,
but new programming languages are offering more dynamic experiences for
visitors and easier management for the Web site owner. In fact, there is a
mass movement from static HTML-only pages to sites that leverage data-
bases, and the server-side programming languages like PHP, ASP (Active
Server Pages), and ColdFusion for those very reasons. With these new lan-
guages, you can create dynamic pages (with changing content). It’s important
to note that not all Web analytics programs provide accurate reporting for
dynamic pages. Unfortunately, the challenges involved in tracking dynamic
pages are inherent in the benefits of dynamic pages.
Figure 10-5:
An Urchin
404 Errors
report.
177
Chapter 10: Identifying Your Most Important Pages

Dynamic pages are just that — dynamic. They change. Practically speaking,
an online magazine could create a single page and use a language like PHP to
pull thousands of articles. If the developer used HTML, he would have to
create 1,000 different HTML pages. Here’s how it works: The page pro-
grammed with PHP pulls all the articles from the e-zine’s database in accor-
dance with the parameters, or variables, that the publisher configured. So the
Webmaster would make a call to article.php?id=325 to display article
number 325 in the database. This means that just by changing the variable at
the end of the URL to a different ID — say, article.php?id=722 — you can
get a page with entirely different content.
The tricky part is that many Web analytics tools tend to ignore the variable
that makes your pages different. So even though article.php?id=100
serves a story about international travel and article.php?id=750 serves
a story about getting the best deal on car rentals, your Web analytics applica-
tion regards them the same and displays statistics for both, as though they
were the same page, article.php. That makes it difficult to determine the
visitor’s navigational path through your site as well as the time spent on each
page or even the exit page.
Here’s the bottom line: If your site uses dynamic pages, you’ll want to make
sure that your Web analytics applications can still deliver the information
you need. That means investing some research time up front so you choose
the right Web analytics vendor. You can read more about how to select a
vendor in Chapter 5. What you’ll soon discover is that some analytics appli-
cations just aren’t as good at handling dynamic pages as others are. In partic-
ular, Google Analytics and ClickTracks do a good job reporting on dynamic
pages individually, whereas AWStats and Webalizer ignore the accompanying
parameters and report on dynamic pages as one page.

Tricking your Web analytics software
If you consider yourself tech savvy, or you know someone who is, you can pull a trick from your
sleeve that will fool the world and offer a loophole to the dynamic page-tracking dilemma. Dynamic
pages are pages that are generated by programming languages ASP, PHP, or ColdFusion. The secret
is to use a common tool developed by Apache, which is a popular Web server software. The
mod_rewrite. Mod_rewrite tool lets you define rules that tell the server to interpret specif-
ically formatted, static-looking URLs as their dynamic counterparts. When you use a
mod_rewrite, it effectively hides the fact that you are using dynamic pages from users, Web
analytics applications, and search engine spiders. Taking this path has two benefits. First, it allows
your Web analytics tools — even the ones that don’t work well with dynamic URLs — to track your
dynamic pages properly. Next, it tricks search engine spiders into thinking that your site is com-
posed of many static pages instead of one dynamic page. Some search engines will even rank your
site higher because of this. Visit http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_
rewrite.html to discover more about this technique.

magine driving your vehicle down an interstate on a rainy day. You’re on
your way to an important business meeting, and you have a long journey
ahead of you. The road is slick, visibility is dim, and the traffic is heavy. If you
navigate these unexpected highway challenges successfully and make it there
on time, you’ll stand a strong chance to close a lucrative business deal. If you
get lost or arrive late, though, you could blow the show.
The reality is that even if you can have the best driving skills in the world, 
if you don’t monitor your dashboard along the way, you could end up in 
trouble. You’ve got to keep your eye on the speedometer because if you drive
too fast, you may get pulled over by the police. If you drive too slowly, you’re
sure to be late. And if you run out of gas, well, the story is over. You’ll be
walking to your business meeting in the rain — and it’s a long, long way.
In terms of Web analytics, think of your Web site as that vehicle you’re dri-
ving down the Information Superhighway. On the way to online success, you
will certainly face challenges in the form of competition, poor product mixes,
and even stalled sales. Just like you keep an eye on your car’s dashboard to
monitor how the vehicle is performing, you need to keep your eye on your
Web analytics dashboard — the area that displays important information
about your site — to understand how your Web site is performing.
This online analytics dashboard displays key performance indicators (KPIs),
which are metrics that illustrate how well your site performs against goals.
Also known as key success indicators (KSIs), offline businesses have been
using these metrics for decades as a sort of report card for their business. 
A manufacturing plant, for example, might use KPIs to assess production or

quality (average number of units produced per hour). A fast food chain, by
contrast, might choose to use KPIs to measure customer service (average
time that a customer waits in the drive-thru line).
In this chapter, we take you on a stroll down KPI Lane and show you every-
thing you need to know about these qualitative metrics. If you’re launching a
brand new Web site, you might discover that you have more KPIs than you do
visitors. Or if you have a well-established site, you might discover that you’ve
been measuring the wrong metrics entirely. We segment these KPIs into cate-
gories and narrow down a long list to help you drill down into your metrics
until you hit a gusher.
KPIs: When Not Just Any Data Will Do
Web analytics software gathers mountains of raw data. It could take you
hours to climb to the top and get that bird’s-eye view of your site — that is,
unless you focus on KPIs. There are scads of KPIs, from how many users vis-
ited the site to where they came from to what pages they visited and so on.
You can easily get caught up in the thrill of reviewing these metrics, but it’s
your KPIs that hold the keys to improving your Web site’s performance.
KPIs can obviously differ from site to site because each site has unique goals.
If you’re trying to build traffic so that you can sell online advertisements to
big name brands, the sheer volume of your unique visitor counts in combina-
tion with the average time spent on site are critical. However, if you’re trying
to generate leads, the quality of the visitor is more important than the mere
quantity. And if you’re trying to sell widgets, the top ten keywords or
keyphrases might be key.
Much like how selectively reading one sentence out of an epic novel can offer
an altogether incorrect understanding of the book’s theme, pulling any one
metric from your Web analytics reports and making decisions can lead you
into error. KPIs put your raw data into the appropriate context so you can 
get the full meaning of your Web site’s story. Allow us to illustrate:
 50,000 visitors came to your site in March. That’s neither good nor bad 
in and of itself. It’s a neutral observation unless it’s in context:
 If 500,000 visitors came to your site in February, a quick comparison of
last month’s traffic with the current numbers tells you that something is
terribly wrong. You just lost 450,000 visitors. Run for the fire extinguisher!
 If only 5,000 visitors came to your site in February, congratulations! You
gained 45,000 visitors. Now figure out what you did right and do more of
it. Mining data, such as search keywords and site referrers, can give you
a clue. (A site referrer, or referring page, is the URL of the previous Web
page from which a link was followed.)
180
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

As you can see, raw numbers are relative and must be put into the context of
KPIs before they can really communicate meaningful insights that can help
you take giant leaps toward your goals.
Calculating basics: Percentages 
and rates; averages; and ratios
Taking columns and columns of raw numbers and putting them into context
means understanding percentages and rates; averages; and ratios. Sometimes
Web analytics programs will calculate these arithmetic puzzles for you, but
sometimes they don’t. If you’re concerned about having to do this yourself, 
be sure to ask your vendor whether its software offers this capability. You can
read more about how to choose the right Web analytics software in Chapter 5.
Assuming that you have to do the math, we want to equip you to avoid poten-
tially costly errors. Don’t zone out on us now. Writers don’t like numbers any
better than the average reader. We’re here to help. (For those of you who
didn’t believe you’d ever need the stuff you learned in math class, we’re here
to say on behalf of your 8th grade teacher, “I told you so.”) Now, for the quick
refresher course.
Practicing percentages
According to Wikipedia, “A percentage is a way of expressing a proportion, 
a ratio or a fraction as a whole number, by using 100 as the denominator. A
number such as ‘45%’ (‘45 percent’ or ‘45 per cent’) is shorthand for the frac-
tion 45⁄100 or 0.45.”
Still confused? Fair enough. Try this: To calculate a percentage, take the
number that represents a part of the total and divide it by the total. Here is a
good, old-fashioned word problem that will take you back in time and tell you
a lot about your Web site:
If you have 12,289 total visitors and 7,844 of them came from search
engines, what percentage of your visitors came from search engines?
To solve the problem, take the number of visitors that came from search
engines and divide it by the total number of visitors:
7844 / 12289 = .6382944
Then move the decimal to the right two places, and you have your answer:
63.82944 percent
181
Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

You could then round up the number (because the first number after the 
decimal is greater than five) to get a simple 64 percent.
Rates
Rates are expressed as percentages. When you discover that your Web site
has a conversion rate of 6 percent, it just means that on average, 6 of every
100 visitors to your Web site will convert to a sale.
All about averages
When you look at an average, you’re trying to approximate the most common
or the middle number in a set of data. In reality, the three types of averages in
mathematics are the mean, the median, and the mode. The most common
method, and the one generally referred to simply as the average, is the arith-
metic mean.
You can calculate the arithmetic mean by adding up a group of numbers and
then dividing that by the number of elements in the group. For example, if
you want to calculate the average number of pageviews (a record of each
time a visitor views a Web page on your site) per user and your data looks
like this:
User A: 3 pages
User B: 1 page
User C: 2 pages
User D: 6 pages
User E: 1 page
You simply add the number of pages for each user:
3 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 1 = 13
And then divide that result by the total number of users in the sampling:
13 / 5 = 2.6
You could then say that the average pageviews per user for your sample set
of 5 users was 2.6 pages.
Ratios
Ratios are another way to compare and contrast data. They are generally
expressed in this context: the ratio of visitors to buyers is 10:1 (read that as
“ten to one”). That simply means that for every 10 visitors, you have 1 buyer.

Keeping up with common KPIs
A shoe seller’s KPIs might be much different than a media portal’s KPIs, and a
media portal’s KPIs will surely be altogether different than a lead generator’s
KPIs. Each type of business has different goals. The shoe seller is about increas-
ing sales. The media portal is about getting new subscribers and advertisers.
The lead generator wants targeted traffic that yields qualified leads. However,
every Web site owner should keep up with some common KPIs. Consider the
following basic KPIs as a bird’s-eye view of your Web site’s performance.
Average number of pageviews per user
The average number of pageviews per user statistic is a common metric
found in many Web analytics applications. This metric is also called Depth of
Visit in some applications. Doubtless, the average number of pageviews per
user will vary, based in part on the type of Web site you’re operating.
Nonetheless, you need to know where you stand. If your average number of
pageviews is low, it could mean a couple of things:
 The user expected something different than what he found on your 
Web site.
 What the user found failed to keep his attention or meet his needs.
In most cases, a low average number of pageviews is a sign that you should
address your Web site design or your content in a way that will encourage
users to stay around a bit longer.
As in other chapters of this book, we use AWStats as our sample Web analyt-
ics application. For more about AWStats, see our overview in Chapter 5.
Finding your average number of pageviews per user in AWStats is a cinch.
Just follow these steps:
1. Point your browser to the URL for your AWStats application.
You can either do this by typing in a defined URL (such as http://
www.yourdomain.com/stats/awstats.pl) or through a Web-based
control panel like cPanel. If you don’t know how to access your statistics
application, see our tips in Chapter 3.
2. Look for the Summary section.
AWStats displays the Summary section near the top of the right pane.
3. Find the Pages heading.
In the middle of the Summary section is a blue header labeled Pages.
Under that label, you see a number that indicates total page views, and
under that number, you will find a line that reads something like ##.##
pages/visit. (See Figure 11-1.) That number is your average number
of pageviews per user.

Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

Notice that our example site boasts a hefty 48-plus pages per visitor metric.
That’s enough to send you doing cartwheels in the backyard, but before you
do, take a reality check. Unfortunately, although having a number that high
would be great, it might not be accurate.
One downfall to AWStats as well as many other server-side Web analytics
applications (software installed on the Web site’s server) is that if a site uses
server-side includes, it often counts each included page as one pageview.
A server-side include is code that displays other pages within one page, and 
is commonly used to simplify Web site management. For example, you could
have a single file that contains the HTML code for your Web site navigation
and include that one file on all the other pages of your site. If you later 
needed to change your navigation, you would need to update only one file, as
opposed to updating every page on your site. But, as you can see, this method
could wreak havoc on some of your statistics. Hosted analytics — Web analyt-
ics applications hosted by a service provider on its server — avoid this pitfall.
For more about hosted analytics applications, read Chapter 4.
Average amount of time users spend on the site
The average amount of time users spend on your site can give you a clear
indication of both your Web site’s first impression and also the quality of
your content overall. First impressions are critical. It’s been said that it takes
seven consecutive good impressions to make up for a poor first impression.
The only problem is that visitor might not come back those seven times if he

summary
section.
184
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

didn’t like what he saw the first time. That means that the time, effort, and
perhaps cold hard cash you spent to get that visitor there is in a virtual
wasteland. The average amount of time users spend on the site, then, is a KPI
that every Web site owner should keep a close eye on.
Generally, the longer visitors stay on your site, the better — with one excep-
tion. If you’re an affiliate marketer hoping that the traffic you captured will
clickthrough to the companies for which you are advertising, you want them
to clickthrough so you can cash in. An affiliate marketer is a Web site owner
who advertises another company’s products or services on his venue
through banner ads or text links. In that case, it doesn’t really matter whether
a visitor stays on your site for 15 seconds, as long as he ultimately clicks
through to the affiliate site.
The concept of sticky content is often misappropriated in the context of this
KPI. When the Web was young, having sticky content came to mean that the
longer you could keep users on your site, the better your content was.
However, we’ve since learned that is not always the case. Remember, the idea
behind KPIs and Web analytics in general is not just to gather the numbers
but rather to try to understand the meaning behind the numbers. For exam-
ple, if you have an e-commerce site and you discover that hundreds of visi-
tors stay on your site for a long time, that’s not necessarily a good thing. It
could just mean that they are having a hard time finding the information or
products they’re looking for. On the other hand, if your Web site is content-
based, it’s safe to say that a higher average amount of time is better.
Many Web statistics programs also commonly calculate this KPI, including
AWStats, our example application for this chapter. To find the average
amount of time users spend on your site, follow these steps:
1. Go to the URL for your AWStats application.
This can either be done through a specifically defined URL (such as
http://www.yourdomain.com/stats/awstats.pl) or through a
Web-based control panel like cPanel. If you don’t know how to access
your statistics application, see our tips in Chapter 3.
2. Find the Visits Duration link.
AWStats houses all the main navigation on the left side of the page. In
the third section down, under the title Navigation, the first link is Visits
Duration. Click that link.
3. Find the average time on site.
After clicking the Visits Duration link in the left navigation, you see the
Visits Duration box in the upper-middle part of the page. Just under the
title, you will find what were looking for. (See Figure 11-2.)

Tabbed browsing and average time on site
Mozilla introduced tabbed browsing to the
masses with its popular open source browser,
Firefox. Tabs allow users to view multiple sites
in a single browser window and easily switch
from one site to another. Visitors doing a little
comparison shopping and product research
can bounce back and forth.
For example, Jack is looking for a new set of golf
clubs, so he opens a browser to his favorite com-
parison shopping search engine and scans the
options for the brand name he’s looking for. He
finds three vendors that look like a bargain, clicks
those links, and winds up with three tabs open.
When he opened those sites, the server regis-
tered a pageview and started the clock ticking to
measure how long he stayed on the site. The only
problem is that he hasn’t actually viewed all the
sites yet because they are hidden behind one
tab. He can view only one site at a time.
Talk began in the Web analytics community
about the potentially serious effects this new
functionality could have on the software’s abil-
ity to accurately calculate statistics because it
falsely — and dramatically — increases the
average time onsite across the board. Jack
might open a dozen or more links in his search
for the perfect set of golf clubs and the acces-
sories that go along with them. However, he
might never actually view the contents of some
of those tabs if he is satisfied with the vendor
under tab 5 in his sequential review.
When Firefox was the only popular browser to
use tabbed browsing, this was not a major con-
cern. However, all that changed when Microsoft
introduced the tabbed browsing for Internet
Explorer 7, which is the dominant browser on
the market as of October 2006. The full effects
of tabbed browsing are not yet fully understood,
but we do know this: It can have major implica-
tions in terms of cookies, a visitor’s pathway
through the site, Web browsing behaviors, time
on site, and even paid search. Be sure to ask
your Web analytics vendor its strategy for deal-
ing with tabbed browsing.

Shopping cart abandonment rate
You might say the shopping cart abandonment percentage is the inverse 
of the conversion rate. Instead of telling you how many visitors became 
customers, this metric tells you how many almost became customers but
ditched the cart in aisle number nine.
To put it another way, the shopping cart abandonment rate tells you how 
frequently a visitor adds products to their shopping cart but then for one
reason or another, does not complete the purchase. In order to make this 
statistic more widely valuable, we call it the conversion process abandonment
percentage. Although this number might not be applicable to strictly content
sites, it does have value for support sites, lead generators, and (of course) 
e-commerce sites.
An online sale has many opportunities to break down. For straight shopping
cart abandonment, you can simply take the number of completed purchases
and divide it by the number of users who added items to their shopping cart.
The result is your shopping cart abandonment percentage. Here’s an example
of 120 users who converted to 18 sales:
18 (sales) / 120 (users who added products to shopping cart) = .15
Now calculate the difference between conversions and 100 percent:
1.00 – .15 = .85
Convert .85 to a percent, and you can see that your
Shopping cart abandonment rate = 85 percent
187
Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights
Support ticket abandonment rate
For support sites, you might want to use a vari-
ation on the shopping cart abandonment rate.
Take the number of visitors who submitted a
support ticket and divide that by the number of
visitors who started the support ticket submis-
sion process. If your support system offers easy
access to frequently asked questions (FAQs) or
suggests answers based on the question the
user has entered, this is a good way to see how
effective those tools are.
Again, you need to make sure that you take some
time to dig deeper than just the bare numbers. If
you find that only 30 percent of the users who
started the process to submit a ticket actually did
submit a ticket, you need to ask what happened
to the other 70 percent. Did they abandon the
process because they found the answers they
needed? Or was it because they couldn’t figure
out how to submit a ticket and thus left in frus-
tration? Remember that getting the numbers is
just the beginning. The real work starts as you
strive to understand the meaning behind the
numbers.

This means that 85 percent of the people who add items to their shopping
cart ultimately decide not to purchase from your store. Why is that? Are your
shipping charges too high? Is your shipping process too slow? Is pricing dif-
ferent than they expected? The possibilities are just short of endless, but
we’ll help you resolve some of the more common shopping cart abandon-
ment causes in Chapter 16.
Conversion rate
If you own a lead generation site, try dividing the number of leads by the
number of people who visited the lead generation form. Say that you get 
433 leads from 3624 visits to the lead generation form:
433 (leads) / 3624 (visits to the lead generation form) = .119
Calculate the difference between conversions and 100 percent:
1.00 – .119 = .881
Convert .881 to a percent, and you can see that your
Conversion process abandonment rate = 88.1 percent
Wow! Over 88 percent of the visitors to your lead generation form are leaving
without submitting a lead! Could the form be improved? Do users have a
reason not to trust that their information will be safe? See Chapter 15 for 
tips and tricks on how to lower your conversion page abandonment rate.
The Granddaddy List of KPIs
As you’ve probably already figured out, you could choose to calculate dozens
of KPIs. This section features a list of some potential KPIs for you to consider
for your Web site.
User and traffic growth KPIs
Tracking your Web site’s traffic growth — unique visitor growth, in particular —
can tell you a lot about how much effect your site is making. Use the following
KPIs to keep an eye on these numbers:
 Percent of User Growth This Period: This is the total number of users in
this reporting period, divided by the total number of users in the preced-
ing reporting period. (Periods are usually measured in months or years.)
This metric provides a snapshot view of your user growth. This KPI is 
the best way to track how well your site is performing when it comes to
188
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

attracting new visitors. If this number remains stagnant for months or even
weeks, you might need to start thinking of new ways to attract new users.
 Percent of Traffic Growth This Period: This is the total number of visits
this period, divided by the total number of visits in the preceding
period. (Periods usually measured in months or years.)
This KPI lets you see how much your traffic has grown since the last
period. It is different from Percent of User Growth in that it counts each
time someone visited your site, as opposed to only counting new visi-
tors. That means if someone visits your site 15 times this period, it
counts all 15 times; the former metric counts only one visit per user.
New or repeat users could generate traffic growth.
 Percent of Traffic from Search Engines: This is the number of visits
that were referred from search engines divided by the total number of
visits. Keeping an eye on this stat can help you decide whether your cur-
rent search engine marketing (SEM) campaigns are doing their job to
increase traffic. SEM is a method that seeks to increase the ranking and
visibility of a Web site in search engine results pages. SEM includes paid
search campaigns.
 Percent New Visitors: This is the number of new users divided by the
total number of users. Getting return visits is great, but it’s also important
to make sure your site is being exposed to new visitors on a regular basis.
Content-effectiveness KPIs
After users get to your site, your content needs to keep them there. Having
lots of users visit your site but leave immediately after arriving does not bode
well for the future of your Web site. Make sure that the following KPIs are
kept in check.
 Average Page Views Per Visit: This is the average number of pages that
a visitor views while on your Web site. In most cases, if a majority of visi-
tors leave after seeing only one or two pages, you might need to do more
to entice them delve deeper into the content your site has to offer. You
might need better headlines, photographs, or other article teasers.
 Average Visits Per Visitor: This is the average number of times that a
visitor views your Web site within a given period of time. If the same 
visitors come back to you time and time again, congratulations. You 
created a site with compelling content that your users just can’t get
enough of. If they don’t come back again and again, maybe start thinking
of ways to encourage them to do so. Maybe you need to offer more regu-
larly updated content or some downloads that they can keep on their
desktop so they won’t forget you.
 Percent of Returning Visitors: This is the number of returning users
divided by the total number of users. Although a high percentage of new
189
Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

visitors tells you that you’re doing a good job marketing your site, a high
percentage of returning visitors tells you that you’re doing a great job
developing Web site tools or content that keeps users coming back.
Here’s one more thing to consider when you have a high percentage of
returning visitors: These people have already seen your site, so you can
feel safe designing a site that offers less introductory content and more
new content. In other words, you don’t have to do a lot of explaining
about who you are and why they should keep coming back. You’ve
gained their trust.
 Ratio of New to Returning Visitors: The number of new visitors com-
pared to the number of returning visitors. Do your visitors know about
you already, or should your Web site talk to them as if they have never
heard of you before? Determining the voice for your Web site is essential
to a successful marketing campaign. If your ratio of new to returning 
visitors is 20:1, you need to start with the basics and offer introductory
information on your Web site. If that number is reversed, however, and
you’re seeing 1 new visitor for every 20 returning visitors, you’re proba-
bly safe skipping the introductions and just immediately making way for
the content they’re looking for.
 Percent Low/Medium/High Time Spent Visits: This is the percentage of
visitors who stay on your Web site for under 30 seconds (low), between
30 seconds and 2 minutes (medium), or longer than 2 minutes (high).
Knowing how long a visitor was at your site can be an important piece 
of the puzzle to show you how effective your site really is. For content-
based sites, such as a news portal or a blog, long stays at your Web site
generally mean your content is doing a good job at capturing your visi-
tor’s interest. Comparatively, a high percentage of short visits can indi-
cate the opposite.
 Percent Low/Medium/High Click Depth Visits: This metric breaks down
visitors into groups based on how many pages they visited on your site.
Click depth is also referred to as pageviews. Expressed as a percentage,
this metric is also effective for determining how well your content
appeals to your visitors and how effective your individual pages are 
at getting users to visit other pages on your site. Content-based sites
should track this metric regularly.
 Percent Low/Medium/High Frequency Visitors: This percentage illus-
trates know how often visitors are coming back to your site. Low fre-
quency visitors come to the site once; high frequency visitors just can’t
get enough of the site and visit all the time. If one of the goals of your
site is to keep users coming back, a high percentage of high-frequency
visitors indicates that you’re doing plenty right. Otherwise, maybe you
need to include more calls to bookmark the site or some other verbiage
that encourages users to come back often, such as teasers about upcom-
ing content specials.
 Page Bounce Rate: This is the percent of users who leave immediately
after viewing the page. If many users leave your site immediately after
190
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 

getting there, that could indicate that either something about your Web
site — design, content, and so on — is turning them off. Or, the source 
of your traffic is sending lots of untargeted traffic. This is a good metric
to watch when you want to see whether a particular campaign is reach-
ing the right audience or if you suspect high levels of click fraud on a
pay per click (PPC) campaign. Click fraud is when a person or robot 
purposely clicks ad listings without any intention of buying from the
advertiser — and it’s becoming a big problem online.
Internal search effectiveness
If your site boasts an internal search function, you need to keep tabs on its
performance. The ability to track these statistics isn’t common in the free or
lower-end analytics applications, so you might need to shop around if you
determine that this data is vital to the success of your Web site.
 Percent Visitors Using Search: This is the percentage of visitors who use
the search function on your site. Is an internal search vital to your site?
One of the ways to determine the answer to that question is to keep 
tabs on what percentage of your site visitors are actually using it. If the
number is high, you’d better make sure that your search function works
well and delivers the results they’re looking for. Otherwise, if your inter-
nal search doesn’t see much action, you can leave well enough alone and
focus your efforts on other aspects of the site. (For more insights into
internal search, read Chapter 12 for more on sifting through search data.)
 Average Searches per Visit: This is the average amount of times that a
user uses the search function on your Web site. If users have to embark
on four or five searches per visit and your site isn’t a search engine, you
need to ask yourself why. Why aren’t users finding what they want on
the first search? Having to do multiple searches to find something
almost always leaves visitors frustrated, and frustrated users are bad 
for business. Of course, perhaps they were searching for four different
items. That’s good news because it means the visitor is interested in
building a relationship with you at some level.
 Percent “Zero Result” Searches: This is the percentage of searches that
yield no results. If your visitors frequently see no results for the terms
they’re searching for, you probably need to do some digging into the
search terms they use. Should your site offer content for those keywords?
If many of your users are searching for them while on your site, the answer
is a resounding “yes.”
 Percent “Zero Yield” Searches: This is the percentage of searches in
which the user doesn’t click any of the results. What good is providing
search results if users don’t click them? If your site generates lots of
searches but users don’t click the results, possibly your search engine is
identifying bad search matches. If that’s the case, you should consider
upgrading your search function to one that provides more relevant results.

Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

Marketing-effectiveness KPIs
How well is your marketing campaign performing? Watch these KPIs if you
want to keep tabs on your online marketing efforts. Note: Because many of
these stats need to be taken in context, you will see metrics side by side in
this format: for example, KPI-1 vs KPI-2. This simply indicates that you need
to look at both numbers in relation to each other in order for them to carry
any real meaning.
 Average Cost per Visitor vs Average Revenue per Visitor: The average
cost to acquire a visitor compared to the average dollar amount that visi-
tor spends on your site. Average cost per visitor is the amount of money
spent driving traffic to the site divided by the number of visitors. Average
revenue per visitor is the amount of revenue generated divided by the
number of visitors. In conjunction, these metrics help you determine how
successful your current marketing strategy is. If the average revenue is
much more than your average cost per visitor, you can pour more money
into the current marketing strategy. On the other hand, if your cost per
visitor is more than your average revenue per visitor, maybe it’s time to
tighten the purse strings and explore other marketing options or perhaps
make some site optimization to increase conversions.
 Percent Revenue from New Visitors vs Returning Visitors: This is 
the amount of revenue generated by new visitors divided by the total
amount of revenue generated and the amount of revenue generated 
by returning visitors divided by the total amount of revenue generated,
respectively. This metric is essential in determining whether new or
return visitors drive your revenue. Determining who pays you is one of
the first steps in determining where to spend your marketing efforts.
192
Part III: Searching for Statistical Treasure 
Let your visitors tell you what they want
Keep an eye on the search terms that your site
visitors use on your internal site search (if you
have one). The ones that yield zero results can
offer important clues in your quest to better
serve your site’s visitors. Put on your customer-
colored glasses for a moment. Something about
your site made them think that you offered what
they were searching for. It could have been a
word in a promotional blurb on your site that
was inconsequential to the actual product. It
could have been a sentence in your blog that
was taken out of context by a search engine.
Who knows? The point is your visitor probably
left disappointed when he discovered that you
did not have what he was looking for. Whether
it was your fault or not, you can use this data to
discover what areas or product or service offer-
ings you should develop next.

 Percent Revenue from First-Time Customers vs Repeat Customers:
This metric is similar to the previous one except that in this KPI, you
track where the bulk of your revenue is coming from:
• First-time customers: People who have never made a purchase from
you before
• Existing customers: People who have made purchases from you in
the past
Coming to terms with this metric can give you insight into whether your
time is better spent selling to existing clients or finding new ones.
 Percent Orders from New Visitors vs Returning Visitors: This is the
percentage of orders from users seeing your site for the first time com-
pared with the percentage of orders from users who have been to your
site. Do most people buy your product on their first visit, or do they
have to come back several times before they make the decision to pur-
chase? Tracking this metric can enlighten you to your customer’s buying
process. For example, if your average customer needs to see your site
four times before he makes a purchase, what can you do to make sure
that he comes back four times?
 Percent Orders from First-Time Customers vs Repeat Customers: This 
is the number of orders from first-time customers divided by the total
number of orders and the number of orders from repeat customers divided
by the total number of orders, respectively. Are the bulk of your orders
being generated by people who have ordered from you before, or is it from
visitors ordering from you for the first time? Track this metric to find out.
 Average Items per Cart Completed: This is the average number of items
in each completed purchase. Everyone who has eaten at a fast food
restaurant has probably heard the phrase, “Do you want fries with that?”
That’s because those restaurant owners understand the power of cross-
selling. If you sell products that can easily be cross-sold, this number
can tell you whether you are doing a good job. If the number is low,
make sure that your Web site is doing everything it can to cross-sell
related items before your visitor clicks the Checkout button. That might
mean installing software that makes recommendations automatically or
perhaps bundling related items in internal search results.
 Average Order Value vs Average Cost per Conversion: The average
order value is the amount of revenue generated divided by the number
of orders. Your average cost per conversion is the amount of money spent
driving traffic to the site divided by the number of conversions (sales,
leads, newsletter subscriptions, and so on). This is your bottom line.
How much is each sale worth, compared with how much you paid to 
get it? As long as you’re paying less to get the sale than your business
makes from it, your business should hum along smoothly. The alterna-
tive is a business that loses money as well as lots of headaches.
193
Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

Conversion KPIs
At the end of the day, your business probably exists to make sales, and your
conversion KPIs are where you find out how well your Web site is performing
in your never-ending goal to gain conversions.
 Average Visits Prior to Conversion: This is the average number of times
that a visitor views the site before making a making a purchase, joining 
a newsletter, requesting more information, and so on. If the number 
is extremely high, perhaps you need to work harder to build trust.
Copywriting or security seals can help. If that number is very low, 
you are probably executing your branding efforts well.
 Conversion Rate: This is the number of conversions divided by the total
number of visitors. Converting visitors into buyers, members, or sub-
scribers is the name of the game. This is the core metric around which
everything else ultimately revolves. If this number is poor, you could go
out of business. If this number is healthy, you could get rich quick. Okay,
so those are the extremes. The point is that this is a number you must
keep your eye on continually.
 New Visitor Conversion Rate: This is the number of conversions divided
by the total number of new visitors. Are new visitors converting immedi-
ately? Or are they running in the other direction? If you convert visitors on
the first visit, congratulations. You’ve hit on some winning search engine,
branding, merchandising, or copywriting strategies (or all the above).

Remembering lifetime value
When you assess the value of your customers, be
sure to look beyond the here and now to the life-
time value. Customer lifetime value (also known
as long-term value, or LTV), which is one of the
greatest assessments of customer loyalty. This
metric is used to describe the value an individual
customer has over the life of her relationship with
your Web site. You can use this metric as the
basis for developing special offers, such as pri-
vate sales and other discounts and benefits that
show your appreciation. You could calculate this
in several ways: total dollar amount for each vis-
itor, frequency of visits, or a combination of both.
Keep in mind the X-factor: subscription models.
Many businesses are built around subscription
models. That means the customer continues
paying even after the initial sale. For example, if
you sell a subscription for a digital download of
the week for $15 per month but you also offer
other digital downloads that the visitor can pur-
chase at-will, the potential lifetime value of the
customer has to be viewed in that light. The point
is, KPIs are not always cut and dried. You have to
continually put the numbers in context and even
consider some what-if scenarios. Enterprise-
level Web analytics programs often offer what-if
and other predictive tools that allow you to see
into the future.

 Returning Visitor Conversion Rate: This is the number of conversions
divided by the total number of returning visitors. As a general rule, repeat
visitors are coveted online because it takes less marketing dollars to get
the sale. If you can spend less to get them there in the first place — and
convert them, to boot — you are ahead of the game.
 Conversion Rate for Campaign “X”: This is the number of conversions
divided by the total number of visitors generated by a particular cam-
paign. Was it those Yahoo! ads that paid off or the Google ads? Was it the
campaign for toothpaste that paid the bills or the campaign for mouth-
wash? This metric will tell you.
Shopping cart KPIs
Shopping cart effectiveness is often the elephant in the room. Companies will
spend thousands on their Web sites only to leave their shopping cart process
for an afterthought. This results in unusually high abandonment rates and
many lost sales. By watching these shopping cart KPIs, you can head off poor
shopping cart performance before it bankrupts your business.
 Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate: This is the number of users who
complete the checkout process divided by the number of users who
start the shopping cart process, usually by adding an item to their cart.
 Cart Start Rate: This is the number of users who start the shopping cart
process, usually by adding an item to their cart, divided by the total
number of users who visited the site. If this figure is high, you need to
investigate why they didn’t seal the deal. Were the shipping costs too
high? Was there some other barrier to entry? It could just be that the
phone rang and they forgot to wrap it up, but there could be a reason
that demands your attention. If you get a high cart start rate, you should
investigate your buying process to see whether it’s too complicated.
 Cart Completion Rate: This is the number of users who complete the
shopping cart process, usually by clicking the Checkout button, divided
by the total number of users who started a shopping cart. If this number
is high, you’ve either made it very easy for your visitors to close the sale,
or they wanted what you were selling badly enough to jump through
pages of hoops to get through the buying process. If this number is low,
maybe your buying process is too complex. Try to limit the number of
steps to three.
 Checkout Start Rate: This is the number of users who start the checkout
process, usually by clicking a button to check out, divided by the total
number of users who visit the site.
 Checkout Completion Rate: This is the number of users who complete
the checkout process, usually by finalizing and paying for an order,
divided by the total number of users who start the checkout process.

Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

Which KPIs Are Right for You?
After you get a solid understanding of the basics of KPIs, you might want to
know which KPIs you should track for your site. Calculating all 40-plus KPIs
listed in this chapter would be too time consuming, not to mention fruitless,
for most Web site owners. Each business needs to develop a short list of KPIs
to track based on the type of Web site it is operating — and more specifically,
for the goals of the organization.
Every organization is different. And because KPIs are largely determined by
the goals of your organization, they vary for each organization. We can sim-
plify the KPI selection process, however, based on the type of site that your
organization operates. Keep in mind, though, that when it comes to Web
sites, there are really only four major categories of sites:
 E-commerce
 Content
 Lead generation
 Customer support
Within those types, we can assume some generally valuable KPIs.
Alright, pay close attention. If you are an e-commerce site, we have narrowed
the KPI field for you. If you are a lead generator, we made it easy to under-
stand what to watch for. If you are a content portal, a quick glance will high-
light all the KPIs you need. If you are running a customer support site, we’ve
got you covered, too. Now it’s up to you to figure out what those numbers
really mean and take the appropriate actions to optimize the online channel.
E-commerce sites
E-commerce sites exist to sell products. They are the Amazon.coms, the reden-
velope.coms, and the bluenile.coms of the Internet world. The desired flow of
an e-commerce site is to get users in, direct them to the items they want, try to
up-sell if possible, and finalize the purchase. With that flow in mind, here are
some basic KPIs that every e-commerce site operator should be watching:
 Average Cost Per Conversion
 Average Order Value
 Average Items Per Cart Completed
 Conversion Rate
 Conversion Rate for Campaign “X”
 Shopping Cart Abandonment Rate

Content sites
The goal of most content sites, or information sites, is to generate as many
new visitors and pageviews as possible. Because these types of sites are
often monetized — to generate revenue from a Web site — by selling targeted
advertising, the more traffic they generate and the more revenue potential
they enjoy. Content sites include news sites, forums, directories, and gener-
ally any Web site where visitors come to the site in search of information and
not necessarily to purchase a product or service.
Common KPIs for content sites include
 Percent of User Growth This Period
 Percent of Traffic Growth This Period
 Percent of Traffic from Search Engines
 Average Page Views Per Visit
 Average Visits Per Visitor
 Percent Low/Medium/High Time Spent Visits
 Percent Low/Medium/High Click Depth Visits
Lead generation sites
Lead generation sites are essentially sites that sell a service. These can
include personal services (such as consulting and legal services) or service
comparison systems (such as lendingtree.com or lowermybills.com). These
sites make money by when visitors submit their information, and the com-
pany closes the lead for personal services or sells the lead to another 
company that can perform the desired service.
KPIs for lead generation sites include
 Page Bounce Rate
 Average Cost Per Visitor
 Average Cost Per Conversion
 Average Revenue Per Visitor
 Conversion Rate
 Conversion Rate for Campaign “X”

Chapter 11: Key Performance Indicators Insights

Support sites
Support sites are commonly designed to help users get answers to technical or
customer support questions. They help organizations save money by reducing
customer turnover rates and eliminating much of the personal interactions
required through the use of FAQs and well-organized, searchable information.
Support site KPIs include
 Percent of User Growth This Period
 Percent of Traffic Growth This Period
 Average Page Views Per Visit
 Average Visits Per Visitor
 Percent New Visitors
 Percent Returning Visitors
 Ratio of New to Returning Visitors
 Percent Low/Medium/High Time Spent Visits
 Percent Low/Medium/High Frequency Visitors
 Percent Visitors Using Search
 Average Searches Per Visit
 Percent “Zero Result” Searches
 Percent “Zero Yield” Searches
Creating Your Own KPIs
As we discuss throughout this chapter, many organizations can benefit by
developing a list of KPIs that are relevant to their individual organizational
goals. When developing KPIs, keep the following recommendations in mind:
 Be specific. Don’t define KPIs that are vague, such as Develop more
incoming links. Instead, look for more specific metrics, such as Number
of incoming links this period vs last period.
 Make sure that the KPI is quantifiable. Get more visitors to like our site
is not a measurable, or quantifiable, goal. Make sure that your KPIs can
be measured with data. Something like Percent of returning visitors is a
KPI that can really be measured.
 Work with what you have. Some analytics programs are more robust
than others. You might not be able to measure everything you want to
measure within your analytics software budget. So work with what you
have, or upgrade to a more sophisticated tool. To read more about the
various tools that are available, see Chapter 5.

Knowledge 
Is Power —
Making Analytics
Work for You

In this part . . .
M
aking Web analytics work for you isn’t rocket sci-
ence if you’ve set goals and determined the Key
Performance Indicators that measure your progress
toward them. Making Web analytics work for you is a
matter of taking the pertinent data that you’ve gathered
and putting it in action.
In particular, you must understand where you’ve been,
where you are, and where you want to go before you begin
applying this powerful knowledge to your site. This is
where chronicling your Web analytics history comes into
play. If you do this, you can even use your historical data
to see the invisible — and to predict the future. We’ll show
you how.
In this part, you’ll also receive insights into how to find
new customers and partners by monitoring your key-
words and referrer reports. What you find there may sur-
prise you. You’ll also understand why you should not
neglect internal site search data while you are combing
through site referrals from Google, Yahoo!, and the other
major external engines. Internal search results can help
you expand your product and service horizons. You can
even cash in on common misspellings if you can identify a
trend in search reports. Again, we’ll show you how.
Of course, with an arsenal of search engine information at
hand, you may discover that it’s time to change your online
advertising strategy. We’ll offer hands-on demonstrations
of how to use tracking URLs and ferret out ad campaigns
that don’t work. And since conversions are the name of
the game, we’ll also show you how to unravel the conver-
sion funnel breakdowns.
All of this falls under the guise of Web site optimization,
which we believe is the Holy Grail of Web analytics. You
can use your data to guide Web site redesigns, optimize
your home page and landing pages, put a stop to shop-
ping cart abandonment, and, finally, measure the impact
of your site changes. Just as Web analytics never stops
collecting and presenting data, you should never stop
measuring your progress towards your goals and making
adjustments to get there faster whenever possible.

In This Chapter
 Discovering surprise keywords that drive traffic
 Spying on internal searches
 Maximizing opportunities with misspellings
T
he business world holds the generally accepted tenet that retaining an
existing customer is far less expensive than acquiring a new one. Just
think about all the preapproved credit card offers that the postman delivers
to your house on a daily basis offering low introductory rates. The average
household receives two credit card offers each week, according to the U.S.
Public Interest Research Groups. And although all those mailings cost money,
after you sign the dotted line, card vendors can stop sending mailings and
start collecting interest.
Web analytics offers unique opportunities to find new customers and even
new partners by mining your external and internal search reports and site
referrer data. Also called the referrer page, a site referrer is the URL of the
previous Web page from which a link was followed. Instead of buying a direct
mailing list — or, in the case of online marketing, an opt-in e-mail list that can
cost thousands of dollars — you can merely review your analytics reports
and discover valuable information about your traffic and its origin.
Web analytics allows you to do what even the most targeted advertising cam-
paigns can’t offer: to discover exactly who sends visitors to your site and
what those visitors expect to find when they gets there. Armed with this
information, you can optimize your Web pages, optimize your merchandising
scheme, or reach out to your top referrers to form strategic alliances that will
send even more traffic your way.
Indeed, if you subscribe to the generally accepted customer-acquisition rule
(keeping a customer is easier than getting one), Web analytics offers you the
best of both worlds because you can glean insights into what your current
customers want as well as what your potential customers want. Either way,
you can target your visitors with the most tempting products and services
and turn them into customers — or repeat customers, as it were.

This is a much different strategy than merely blasting advertising or market-
ing campaigns to the masses in the brick-and-mortar world, even if you target
masses in a narrowly focused trade journal or via television broadcast. It’s
different because oftentimes, the target can immediately respond by clicking
through to your site and accepting your call to action. Customers don’t have
to pick up the phone to order or drive to a store near them: Their fingers lit-
erally do the walking.
What you discover in this chapter may surprise you. So get ready to delve
into your search and referrer reports to
 Find keyphrases you never dreamed were driving traffic.
 See how to monitor your internal site searches for maximum 
conversions.
 Cash in on common misspellings.
 Plenty more!
If you implement these measures, you not only have the potential to attract
new visitors, but you’ll also serve your loyal customers more effectively.
Sifting Your Search Terms
Web analytics offers you the opportunity to get inside the heads of your visi-
tors. (Whether you get inside their wallets depends on other factors, such as
compelling products, site design, a trusted brand, and so on). In other words,
you can discover how your visitors are thinking as well as what they expect
to find when they entered your virtual outpost. Reviewing your keywords (terms
entered into an external search engine) and keyphrases (multiple search terms
used together) reports is a fascinating exercise, but beware that it can be
addictive. Reviewing these reports is more than an exercise in satisfying
snoops: It’s the first step in driving additional traffic. More traffic equals more
opportunity to turn visitors into customers, subscribers, and readers.
Accessing the search data
Practically speaking, most Web site owners should sift through their search
terms every month or so to discover what keywords and keyphrases are
used on search engines, and then respond accordingly. If you get more than 
a few thousand visitors per day, we recommend reviewing your data weekly
or even daily. Most importantly, don’t ignore this opportunity to optimize
your site and your online advertising efforts by using this data. It could

realistically double or triple your traffic virtually overnight. You decide how
much time and money you want to put into traffic-acquisition strategies.
Using AWStats as our example analytics tools, accessing your keywords and
keyphrases reports is as simple as one, two, three (and four).
1. Point your browser to the control panel.
Generally, you can access your cPanel installation by entering your URL,
followed by a slash and cpanel. Here’s an example:
http://www.yoururl.com/cpanel
That URL will probably direct you to another URL that corresponds with
your Web hosting provider, so don’t be alarmed if the URL changes. If
you know that your hosting company offers cPanel but the preceding
instructions don’t take you anywhere, you might need to contact your
hosting company to get the URL for your cPanel installation.
2. Enter your username and password and click OK to gain access to the
control panel.
You are greeted with a pop-up box that instructs you to enter your Name
and Password. (See Figure 12-1.) You may choose to select a check box
that offers to remember your password so you don’t have to enter it the
next time around. (If you’ve already forgotten your Name and Password,
of if you never knew what it was to begin with, contact your Web hosting
provider for details.)
3. Locate the Web/FTP Stats section.
Note the Web/FTP Stats section in the center column (the second 
category). Several different links appear in this section, as shown in
Figure 12-2, which vary depending on what your Web host has enabled
for the server.
Figure 12-1:

dialog box.
203
Chapter 12: Sifting through Search Data

4. Click the software that you would like to use.
Voilà! You have access to a world of data.
5. Locate Search statistics.
On the left side of the screen is a list of link options. Toward the bottom
is the Referrers section. Under that category, you’ll see Search. Click
that link.
Your Search Keyphrases (Top 10) and your Search Keywords (Top 25)
reports display. You’ll also see a link to Full List under the heading. If
you have more than 10 search keyphrases and 25 search keywords, click
this link to display each and every one of them.
Reviewing your top search terms
When you review your Search Keyphrases and Search Keywords reports,
note how the charts are broken down into three columns. (See Figure 12-3.) 
In the chart below, for example, are the columns 3,638 Different Keyphrases,
Search (lists how many times visitors used those specific terms to find your
site), and Percent (tells you what percentage of your visitors who came
through an external search engine used those specific terms).
Figure 12-2:
Web/FTP
Stats
section in
cPanel.
204
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Looking at our example, you can tell that the most popular keyphrase was
Frank T. Hopkins, followed closely by Frank T Hopkins (without the period
after the middle initial). In fact, more than 5 percent of the visitors who found
this site through an external search engine (such as Google or Yahoo!) used
those terms. And what does that have to do with the resulting target,
EquestrianMag.com? As you can likely guess, the site features an article
about the legendary endurance rider, Frank T. Hopkins. More searchers 
find Equestrianmag.com by searching for Hopkins than they do by searching
for equestrian magazine, which only garnered 1.7 percent of the searches.
That is telling.
So, what do your search reports tell you? What are your most popular key-
words and keyphrases? These are the search terms that will probably drive
the most traffic through a paid search campaign, so if you want to boost your
traffic, that’s an option. For more good stuff on online advertising, read
Chapter 13.
Sifting through these top keywords and keyphrases is important because
what you find can actually be disturbing. Perhaps you discover that the most
popular search terms don’t relate to the product or service that you’re labor-
ing to sell. The search engine terms that your visitors used most could direct
them to a product that has low margins or to a service that isn’t all that prof-
itable. Don’t get us wrong: Getting visitors in the door however you can is

Chapter 12: Sifting through Search Data

great, especially through natural search, which doesn’t cost you a penny.
However, the same natural search engines that brought less profitable visi-
tors through your virtual doors can bring visitors who are looking for high-
margin products and banner services. Why not optimize for that juicier fruit?
My Visitors Are Searching for What?!
When you review your search reports, you might discover that some surpris-
ing keyword and keyphrases are opening the door to your site. The Web site
This Might Be a Wiki (www.tmbg.net) offers a list of amusing search engine
keywords and keyphrases that took visitors to tmbw.net for one reason or
another, including linky dinky, bicycle wrecks, how to become a robot, and help
me match my clothes. Get the picture? Some keywords that your visitors use
might give you a good chuckle; others may disgust you; and still others can
offer you insights into products, services, content, and customer service
answers you could be offering. Unfortunately, others could be wasting your
Benjamins.
Pleasant surprises
The Holy Grail for many Webmasters is to find their site listing on the first page
of the search engine results for his terms of choice. However, using generic key-
words rarely does the trick for the average Web site owner. You need to get cre-
ative and consider what the competition is doing — think like searchers think.
Your Web analytics program can help you do that last part, anyway.
Reviewing your search reports can uncover some surprising and powerful
keywords that you can use to generate high volumes of traffic to a specific
landing page, the specific Web page where a visitor first arrives in response
to an organic search or a paid search initiative. Or maybe you’ll decide to
build landing pages around these surprising keywords so that visitors can
enter into the site on the very page that has the products, services, articles,
or answers they need. Looking at these surprising keywords can help you
come up with names of new products, services, and content categories; or
even help you phrase self-service questions and answers in ways that are
easier for your customer to understand.
Say you discover that 20 percent of your visitors used the terms polka dotted
pants to find your Web site. Maybe you need a landing page especially for
polka dotted pants. Okay, that’s an extreme example, but we’re trying to make
a point. What search terms are visitors using frequently that you never thought
would play up in your copywriting or merchandising schemes? Got it? Now
use them to your advantage.
206
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Searching for relevant terms
If you find yourself with keyword block, don’t despair. There are plenty of
ways to figure out what Web searchers are looking for. For example, Overture
(www.overture.com) offers a free Keyword Selector Tools that offer some
relief. Hitwise (www.hitwise.com) has a service that shows you the top
1,000 terms in any given industry albeit at a hefty price.
You could skirt both services by doing some undercover searching of your own.
1. In Google (or your search engine of choice), just enter search terms
that are most relevant to your business.
You can see the quality of the keyword competition. Pay careful atten-
tion to the sponsored links. Those are probably your competitors who
bought contextual keywords.
2. Visit those sites and view the source code to look at the home 
page’s code.
3. Look for a list of keywords embedded in their meta tags.
You want to see HTML tags that are written into the head section of an
HTML page behind the scenes.
Sounds sneaky, we know, but it’s not unethical. It’s competitive intelligence.
You know what they say — imitation is flattery. Besides, their lists might
spark even better ideas you can use for your keyword campaigns.
If you need to wrap your mind around this and other HTML issues, pick up a
copy of HTML 4 For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Ed Tittel and Mary Burmeister
(Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Profit thieves
Although you will surely find some pleasant surprises in your keywords
report, you might also find some profit thieves lurking in the wings. We’re
talking about your pay per click (PCC) search campaigns. Also called paid
search, this method retrieves listings based on who paid the most money for
keywords to appear at the top of the heap. What many newbies don’t under-
stand is that search engines take a broad approach to keyword traffic. Most
engines not only send you traffic based on exactly the search terms you
chose, but they also send you traffic that they think relates to the search
terms you chose. Search engines can include synonyms, misspellings,
hyphenated terms, singular and plural combinations, compound words, or
typographical errors related to the words you selected.
207
Chapter 12: Sifting through Search Data

Yes, you can direct these engines not to use broad matching when you sign
up for your keywords campaign, but if you forget — and even if you do want
the broad matches — you might find that these visitors are sucking your PPC
ad budget dry without filling up your bank account with sales. Broad match
strategies, then, can be a blessing or a curse. You need to keep your eye on
broad search terms and take the appropriate action. For example, if the
broad matches are a blessing, you can optimize around them. If they are a
curse, talk with your paid search provider about shutting the door on these
profit thieves — for good.
Cashing In on Common Misspellings
Thank God for spell check. It’s made all our lives much easier, hasn’t it? Well,
there is no spell checker, per se, on the Web. Sure, if you type in elphant circus
on Google (notice the missing e), you will get a red prompt at the top of the
search results that reads something like Did you mean: elephant circus? And
immediately under that you also see links to stories, eBay sellers, movie list-
ings, and gift stores that spelled elephant as elphant. Buyers do the same
thing on your internal site search. They mean elephant but type elphant. They
mean toilet but type in the synonym commode. They meant one thing, but 
cultural differences or common misspellings bring up something different —
unless you discover how to cash in on these issues.
Names are among the most frequently misspelled words in search engines, as
evidenced by the Yahoo! Buzz Log of the Top 20 misspellings for 2006. There,
you’ll find common misspellings such as Rachel Ray, Louis Vitton, Jimmy
Buffet, Brittney Spears, and Anna Nichole Smith. Again, some search engines
will attempt to automatically correct the typos, but accounting for the ones
that fall through the cracks doesn’t hurt.
If you don’t see the correlation between the engine and the site, allow us to
offer you a real-life example. FreeBookClubs.com (see Figure 12-4) offers some
unusual misspellings. After you identify the misspellings (get out your diction-
ary if you don’t spell any better than the average person), you can include those
misspellings in your product descriptions so that searchers who aren’t quite
sure how to spell an unusual author’s name or book title can still find what they
are looking for. This should be done tactfully and obviously so that users under-
stand why you have misspellings at the bottom of your about page.
Don’t go over the top listing misspellings because this tactic can backfire on
you big-time. If you have lots of text that is similar or large sections of copy
that don’t make any sense, search engines might penalize you for what they
believe is a slick attempt to get higher rankings and generate more traffic
with fluff content. Try to keep your misspellings list to just the most common
misspellings, or break it up into different areas on the site. Follow this general
rule: If it looks weird or out of place to users, search engines will probably
see it the same way.
208
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Beyond Traffic to Conversions
Traffic is one thing; conversions are another. Although discovering what
search terms drive your traffic is undeniably important, it’s equally (if not
more) important to discover what search terms convert traffic. After all, you
aren’t paying a Web host to serve your site to the masses for grins and gig-
gles. Even bloggers are seeking to get subscribers to RSS feeds and on-site
advertising these days. And affiliate marketers don’t just want traffic: They
want visitors who click through to their affiliate partners so they can collect
their commissions. Lead generators aren’t just bragging about their abilities.
They want folks to e-mail them or call them. And customer service opera-
tions don’t just want visitors to search Q&A databases: They want visitors to
find the answers so they won’t pick up the phone and call in a nervous tizzy.
Regardless of your conversion goals, Web analytics has you covered with the
data you need to demonstrate success (or break the news that you need to
change your strategies). We delve into of search engine marketing (SEM) — a
method that seeks to increase the ranking and visibility of a Web site in search
engine results pages — at greater length in Chapter 14, we focus our discus-
sion here on natural search (the kind you don’t pay for). You’ll be pleased to
know that several strong search engine optimization (SEO) analytics tools are
on the market in various price ranges; they can tell all you need to know about
how your search SEO labors are paying off. We’ve selected a few reputable
tools to give you a taste of the market.
If you get out of the shallow end of SEO and venture out into the deep, you’ll
discover what many online scam artists will never tell you: SEO is not merely

about getting first positioning on Google, Yahoo!, and others. It’s about con-
versions. Pop quiz: Would you rather be listed eighth in the rankings and
earn $10,000 per month, or be listed first in the rankings and make $200 per
month? Don’t you wish all pop quizzes were that easy?
Not quite classified as niche programs (because they offer well-rounded ana-
lytics packages), software such as TrafficAnalyzer and Portent Interactive are
ideal for the wannabe and professional SEO guru alike. These tools offer an
in-depth look at keywords so you can decide which search terms are convert-
ing and which ones aren’t. Although there is still room for a superstar SEO
analytics program at the time of this writing, the applications we list here can
help you break down your data into actionable steps. Then you can fine-tune
your Web site accordingly. (We get to the fine-tuning in Chapter 16.)
TrafficAnalyzer
www.agentinteractive.com
TrafficAnalyzer (see Figure 12-5) is a combined, in-depth keyword tracking
and Web analytics solution. This hosted solution is relatively easy to use, and
its sole task is to determine the sources of your most profitable TrafficAnalyzer.
One of this application’s features that turns the heads of SEOs and affiliate
marketers is its ability to determine and track unlimited single or multistep
conversion points. You can differentiate between sale and non-sale conver-
sions, view new visitor and returning visitor conversions, and identify the
best source of conversion-producing traffic. The cost is only $10 per month
for up to 1,000 hits.
Portent Interactive
www.portentinteractive.com
Portent Interactive’s SEO Analytics (see Figure 12-6) drills down to the
bottom line in a hurry. Its program tracks several metrics on every campaign,
including nonbranded traffic, percentage of traffic, conversion, and ranking.
Nonbranded traffic is traffic that you get from terms that don’t include your
company name. Some call this the truest measure of SEO success. Measuring
nonbranded traffic tells you more about how your audience looks for you.
This program also tracks the percentage of traffic to your site from major
search engines and how many visitors converted.

Don’t get sucked into SEO firms that promise to get you number-one rankings
on all your keywords. We’re not discussing those here because we are talking
about Web analytics, which deals with measuring the results of campaigns.
But we felt it necessary to warn you that opportunists are on the Web who
will promise you the moon and deliver you a large bill that will have you seeing
stars. You can do lots to search-engine-optimize your own site; read Wiley’s
Search Engine Optimization For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Peter Kent for more
about that. This book helps you track those efforts. We listed the reputable
tools in this section to help you avoid the temptation of the scammers.
103bees.com
www.103bees.com
103bees.com (see Figure 12-7) isn’t a hive of stinging creatures. Rather, it’s a
real-time online tool for Webmasters and bloggers that is highly focused on
natural search engine traffic analysis. It offers tons of detailed statistics and
in-depth information on search terms that drive visitors to your blog. If you
want to search-engine–optimize your blog, this is the tool for you. If you want
to measure your Internet marketing initiatives, this tool is right up your alley.
Plus, it’s free. 103bees.com helps you discover the long tail for all the key-
word combinations that work for your Web pages. This is valuable because
you can unlock hiding opportunities beyond the Top 10, such as new blog-
ging content ideas that attract readers. Instead of paying for ads, you can
merely mine your long tail of search terms and use those keywords to drive
more traffic.
Flip-Flopping the 80/20 Rule
Many Web site owners are hyperfocused on the Top 10 or Top 25 search key-
words and keyphrases. In essence, you might be looking at the top 20 percent
of your external search terms and ignoring the remaining 80 percent. Some
search marketers flip-flop the 80/20 rule and spend considerably more effort
sifting through the latter 80 percent. True, perhaps 20 percent of your search
terms drive 80 percent of your traffic today, but there is no reason why the
other 80 percent of your search terms couldn’t generate enough revenue to
put that top 20 percent to shame. (See Figure 12-8.) In our example, the top 10
keywords are responsible for less than 10 percent of all search traffic. Isn’t it
time to start watching the other 90 percent?

Chapter 12: Sifting through Search Data

This is known as the long tail principle, which is a term whose coinage is widely
attributed to Chris Anderson, who wrote a book by the same name. The long
tail (see Figure 12-9) consists of keywords and keyphrases that individually
don’t account for much traffic but, if maximized, could be potentially power-
ful tools to enhance revenues, leads, content, or customer self-service oppor-
tunities. The long tail, then, helps you uncover product and service niches,
no matter how small they are.
You can start using your long tail to swing search circumstances in your
favor. But before you do, consider this theory in practice. Amazon.com, for
example, might sell 250,000 of its top 20 book titles on Thursday, but it might
also sell 1 million book titles that fall under the radar screen of the top 20. By
paying attention to the long tail, Amazon can also search for titles it doesn’t
have that people wanted to buy. Amazon can then stock them on its virtual
shelves and begin to sell them, thereby increasing the opportunity to gen-
erate revenues. This might not work well in the brick-and-mortar world 
where shelf space is limited, but it is a winning concept on the Web, where
many book publishers can drop-ship products direct to the customer for 
e-commerce players.
The same concept holds true for customer self-service. Every question that
customers type into a search box that isn’t answered in your database causes
frustration. You can increase customer loyalty by examining the long tail and
making sure that you address every customer concern. For content portals

Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

and lead generators, the long tail works much the same way. It could be that
your firm offers precisely the services the customer is looking for, but the
long tail reveals that they use a completely different terminology to describe
what they need. Those leads might not have converted simply because you
are speaking a different language. Content providers can examine the long tail
to discern new opportunities for niche categories of content. So don’t limit
yourself to the 80/20 rule. Start swinging the long tail in your favor.
Monitoring Internal Site Searches
Internal site search — the search box that should appear on every page of
your Web site to help customers find what they are looking for — can help
transform a site that suffers from high abandonment rates to one that boasts
full carts. It can help extend the one-hit visit into multiple pageviews. It can
even take a sad excuse for an online customer support center and give it a
makeover that will encourage customer loyalty. That’s why you should moni-
tor what some in the industry call the other search. Sure, search engine traffic
and the keywords that drive it are critical because your visitors might not
otherwise find you. However, if they can’t find what they are looking for after

Stats on site search stats
As you review your site search terms, you’ll
probably discover that most of them are one or
two words. We know this because we keep
tabs in industry research, so we can bring you
the inside scoop. We turned to WebSideStory
(www.websidestory.com) for some stats
on visitor site search behavior and came up
with some interesting results that serve all types
of sites. For the record, WebSideStory studied
visitor site search behavior on 42 of its cus-
tomers sites in May 2006. Fifteen of those sites
were e-commerce sites, 14 were media sites,
and 13 were lead generators. All in all, the ana-
lytics firm analyzed a mind-boggling 34 million
site searches to come up with some key find-
ings. Here’s what the firm found:
 One- and two-word queries accounted for
83 percent of all site searches.
That figure was 91 percent on e-commerce
sites.
 The top 4 percent of all unique query
phrases accounted for half of all site
searches.
For e-commerce sites, 2 percent of all
unique query phrases accounted for 50 per-
cent of all sites searches.
 Nearly 12 percent of all sites searches led
to 0 results.
 About 0.2 percent of all site searches were,
well, blank.

If you have a lead generation site with just a few pages, these might not be
the most important pages in the book. However, if you sell widgets (and lots
of different colors, sizes, and shapes of them) or if you run a customer serv-
ice center online, pay very close attention to what we are about to share with
you because it could change the face of your business forever. (You can thank
us later.) What you are about to discover is hidden treasures are contained in
the internal site search report that even the external search engine report
won’t tell you. Your job is to monitor that report and put what you discover
into action.
Driving sales, not traffic
Internet search engines drive traffic to your site, but the internal search
engine can drive conversions. You can pay hundreds or even thousands of
dollars when driving traffic to your Web site. Simple site search, by contrast,
is free. So, if you’re going to bid on keywords at Google, be sure to optimize
your site search functions first. Otherwise, you could just be funding the
development Google’s next online tool.
Site search puts you in the driver’s seat. You don’t have to depend on being
the highest bidder on a keyphrase in Overture. Once users are on your site,
you have a captive audience for as long as you can keep them. Site search
helps you take visitors by the hand and walk them down the aisles they choose.
While you escort them with your site search tool, you can suggest other
products and services that compliment what they searched for. For example,
if a visitor types scarlet scarf in the site search box, you can also bring up
scarlet coats and gloves and present them on the same page. This is cross-
selling and up-selling at its best.
But wait, there’s more! Using Web analytics to monitor your internal site
searches can also uncover opportunities to sell products or offer services
that customers want but that you don’t yet offer. You can also drill down into
your reports to discover what products you offered that visitors searched for
but couldn’t find. (How tragic! You just lost a customer!) You can use a visi-
tors own words to fine-tune your product and service descriptions and even
identify emerging customer service issues.
The bottom line from the top down
Here’s the bottom line: According to WebSideStory stats, visitors who use
internal site searchers spend 270 percent more moolah on a Web site than
visitors who don’t use internal site search. Need we say more? Great naviga-
tion isn’t enough, folks, especially if you have lots and lots of stuff to navigate
through. Yes, pay attention to your clickstream analysis — the recorded path,
page by page, of the pages that a visitor requests while navigating through a
Web site. But also pay attention to your internal site search.
216
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Allow us to put it to you in another way: For all the hoopla over SEO and SEM,
another method could dramatically increase conversion rates for e-commerce
players: site search. Site search can be as much as three times as likely — 
yes, we said three times — to convert site visitors to buyers, according to a
WebSideStory study. In fact, site search conversion rates can easily run 6 per-
cent compared with the rather typical 2 percent standard for most industries.
Before you begin . . .
Before you begin monitoring your internal site search efforts, be sure to do
some quick comparisons and record what you find. Assess the quality of your
site search results. Did visitors leave the searcher empty-handed? Are your vis-
itors using your search box to dial up contact information? Did the site search
queries your visitors use convert? What is the conversion rate (the percentage
of visitors who take the desired action) for internal site searchers — and how
does that compare with visitors who didn’t use the internal search box?
Here’s how to calculate your conversion rate:
1. Determine the number of visitors to your site.
Look at the number of unique visitors in your Web analytics program.
217
Chapter 12: Sifting through Search Data
Selecting site search technology
Plenty of site search vendors are on the market,
but you don’t necessarily need to use one. If you
have but a few items on your site, you can rely
some of the free solutions on the market, like
FreeFind (www.freefind.com) or FusionBot
(www.fusionbot.com). If you’re serious
about making the most of site search, however,
you should consider investing in a paid solution.
Some solid paid tools include Pico Search
(www.picosearch.com), SearchBlox (www.
searchblox.com), and SLI Systems (www.
sli-systems.com). Of course, those are
just a few leads. You’ll need to check out these
solutions for yourself, keeping these points 
in mind:
 Scalability: Site-search solutions need to
grow with your business.
 Pricing model: The pricing should be flexi-
ble, determined by the size of the Web site
being searched.
 Optimization features: These should offer
greater managerial control over your own
site search.
 Indexing and templates: These should keep
the engine fresh. The templates are impor-
tant because they offer a support design
system to help control the layout of your
search results page. Choose a vendor
whose templates can match your site’s look
and feel.

2. Determine the number of conversions.
Not all Web analytics programs do this for you. If you use Google
Analytics, though, you can count the number of Thank you pages, or
whatever page displays after the visitor takes the desired call to action.
3. Divide the number of visitors by the number of conversions.
This is good, old-fashioned arithmetic. Your answer will offer you the
conversion rate for your Web site.
WebSideStory’s data suggests that you should be converting site search
users at nearly three times the rate of average site visitors who don’t use site
search. If that’s not the case, you might need to look for another site search
technology vendor, changing the way you associate keywords with your con-
tent or make some other adjustment.
Searching for Accuracy and Relevancy
Internal site search is critical in the Google Age, where searchers expect to
get highly relevant results. Going to an e-commerce site and searching in the
internal engine only to come up empty is a frustration for visitors, especially
when they know that you sell what they want. Getting inaccurate or irrele-
vant results can be even worse.
You’ve probably heard it said that your visitors are only a few clicks away
from your competitor. That was a popular cliché that developed in the Web’s
early years. It was true then, and it’s still true now. Again, you can’t rely
solely on navigation. You need relevant internal site search results to help
harried visitors cut through the clutter and find what they are looking for
quickly. Don’t try to be slick and offer them a page of boots when they typed
in sweaters just because you don’t sell shirts. It’s one thing to cross-sell or 
up-sell; it’s quite another to get pushy with irrelevant products.
Put on your customer-colored glasses again. Every time a visitor types a 
keyword or keyphrase into a site’s internal search engine, he expects to find
results that match his search term. Wouldn’t you? If a trend arises in the
search terms that visitors use — no matter how strange that trend may be —
the internal search parameters should be tweaked to ensure that visitor gets
the results that she is expecting.
Creating Targeted Landing Pages
We’re about to let you in on one of the newest trends in site search: using the
results as a landing page. Your advertising or e-mail campaigns will drive traf-
fic to your site, but you can decide what pages they go to. Of course, being
218
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

the savvy Web analytics analyzer that you are, you are going to review your
internal site search report and send visitors to a page with relevant site
search results.
An e-commerce vendor could launch a campaign around a particular brand,
for example. If the vendor offers a link that delivers relevant site search
results to visitors, he can more easily find the desired brand or product.
Clinique, for example, sells more than cologne. A landing page of site search
results could display information about all related or available products,
which could also lead to cross-selling opportunities. For more information
about landing page optimization, read Chapter 15.
Similarly, if you have an e-commerce site, you can enhance your SEM cam-
paigns by indexing site search pages. Typically, spiders don’t index site
search results because they are automatic user agents. Also known as Web
crawlers, bots, or robots, spiders are automated scripts or programs that browse
the Web. Search engines use robots to gather up-to-date data as they index
the Web. Search engine spiders can’t manually enter keywords in search forms.
You can get around this, though, by adding related searches on your product
pages. That lets you provide a path to the site search page for various items.
Using this technique makes it easy for spiders to index the site search page
and then follow the related search links to get thousands of new pages
indexed and optimized for the search terms people are actually using on your
site. Brilliant, isn’t it? Thank you very much. We thought so, too. Remember
the rule of relevancy, though, and keep analyzing your Web analytics reports
to determine the appropriate listings.
Your Search Yielded Zero Results . . .
A WebSideStory study of 34 million internal site searches discovered that
nearly 12 percent of them led to 0 results. As you review your internal search
reports, pay close attention to these goose eggs. Site searches that yield zero
results can clue you in to new product or service opportunities. Maybe your
competition is already offering the product, and the visitor was doing a little
comparison shopping to check out your price. If you run a customer service
site and the customer’s queries yield zero results, he’ll either get angry, pick
up the phone and call, or send you an e-mail — or all the above. In any of
these cases, your job is to react — and react quickly — to zero results.
Here’s an example to drive home our point. We take a quick look at one of the
top Web properties that Sostre & Associates (an interactive firm) operates. (If
the name Sostre sounds familiar, it’s no coincidence. Check out the co-authors
of this book!) The Web site, FreeBookClubs.com, is a book club directory that
aims to simplify avid readers’ search for clubs that offer the authors, genres,
and titles they crave.
219
Chapter 12: Sifting through Search Data

Although FreeBookClubs.com offers an internal site search tool, the Sostre &
Associates development gurus realized they could better understand user
behavior by tracking the specific terms that visitors used in the search box.
What they discovered was that six of the Top 10 most popular search phrases,
including the most popular search phrase on the site, were for authors that
weren’t mentioned anywhere on the site. So even though FreeBookClubs.com
did offer book clubs that featured books by those requested authors, the visi-
tor was presented with zero search results. Translation: Most of those visi-
tors left because they thought the site didn’t offer what they were looking for.
By adding information about those authors as well as which book clubs they
were associated with, FreeBookClubs.com was able to provide visitors with
the information they were looking for, keep more visitors on the site, and con-
vert more book club browsers into book club subscribers.

Mix and match internal and external search
Web analytics allows you to do some interesting
experiments in your search for profitable key-
words and keyphrases, and it’s one of the easi-
est experiments to execute and measure. First,
review the most popular search terms that your
visitors used to find your site. Then review the
most popular search terms that your visitors
entered into your internal search box. Are they
the same? Or are there some vast differences?
Chances are that at least some minor differ-
ences are worth noting. If you see a prepon-
derance of internal site search keywords that
convert visitors into buyers, members, sub-
scribers, or otherwise satisfied customers, you
need to exploit those keywords to the fullest and
use them in your PPC campaigns.

t’s one thing to use Web analytics to better understand those customers —
or readers — you already have. It’s quite another to use Web analytics to
increase your visibility to new customers and partners. That’s what we show
you how to do in this chapter. If you haven’t considered the power of this
software to assist you in your target marketing efforts, now’s the time.
Target marketing is a simple concept and one with which you may be familiar:
It’s merely communicating with a specific group of people who share similar
characteristics. By knowing what your visitors are doing on your site, you
can carve out markets and target new customers who want what you have to
offer. You can do this through visitor segmentation — analyzing users grouped
by similar characteristics or traits — which we discuss at length in Chapter 9.
But that’s not the only way to use Web analytics to drive new customers. You
are about to discover several other ways to generate new revenue streams.
By the same token, Web analytics can help you discover new partners, or
allies. It’s a competitive World Wide Web out there. Believe us: You need all
the help you can get. The more Web sites that refer visitors to your Web site,
the better. It helps your page rank — a numeric value created and calculated
by Google that’s designed to indicate the importance of a page — and it deliv-
ers the potential of more conversions. We discuss strategies for reviewing
site referrers in Chapter 8, but you’ll see these strategic allies in a new Web
analytics light in the paragraphs to come.
To put it plainly, this chapter is where you discover how to increase the
number of potential customers who come through your site as well as part-
ners who can help get the word out. Whether you are a socialite or a recluse,
an expert marketer or still wet behind the ears, you’ll discover how to use
Web analytics to unlock new opportunities to drive revenue. As an added

bonus, we show you how to keep tabs on your Google PageRank so you can
watch how your new partnerships and traffic building efforts make your site
more attractive to the biggest search engine out there.
Finding New Customers
Face it: Repeat customers are welcomed friends, and they are easier to keep
than new customers are to acquire. But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t
seek new friends, does it? After all, your existing customers, subscribers,
members, and others will only purchase, read, or visit so much. You need a
steady flow of fresh blood, so to speak, if you want to see that line on your
revenue chart climb higher and higher. You need to find some new customers.
You’ll find strategies, tips, and tricks throughout this book on connecting
with new customers, but this chapter zeroes in on some Web analytics activi-
ties that are specially designed to help you attract more visitors.
Attracting new visitors is only one part of the equation. You can spend half
your Internet life driving traffic to your site. If that traffic isn’t relevant to
what your site has to offer, you’d be better off watching old reruns on Nick at
Nite. In other words, if you aren’t identifying customer trends in your Web
analytics report and targeting a like-minded Internet population, you’re just
using up bandwidth.
Scanning your search engines
Knowing which search engines send you the most converting visitors — who
then qualify as customers — helps you make smart decisions about online
advertising aimed at attracting more of the same. If you discover that Google
sends you virtual truckloads of duds but Yahoo! sends visitors who subscribe
to your RSS feeds or fork over cash to buy your widgets, it would seem that
the latter also gives you a better shot at finding new customers who will 
do the same.
Using your Web analytics applications to segment visitors and discover which
search engines send you the highest percentage of paying customers allows
you to focus your efforts on those engines. After all, your search engine market-
ing (SEM) budget isn’t unlimited. (SEM is a method for increasing the visibility
of a Web site in search engines through improving rank in organic listings, pur-
chasing paid listings, or a combination of these as well as other search engine-
related activities.) Web analytics offers you opportunities for efficiency. Skip to
Chapter 14 for more relevant info on how to measure these metrics.
222
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Improving your search rankings
One way to find new customers is to extend your reach online by improving
your search rankings. According to a Pew Internet & American Life study, few
people look beyond the first page of results. Don’t let that get you down.
Obviously, not everybody can rank on the first page of search results for a
given search term or phrase. And you shouldn’t toil and spin trying to get
your site on the first page of results for anything and everything you peddle
or produce. You need to decide what you want to be known for or check your
Web analytics and play off what customers already know you for. Then opti-
mize your Web site’s content around those keywords.
To that end, you might engage in any number of search engine optimization
(SEO) activities. SEO is a method of improving the rankings for relevant key-
words in search results by making changes to the content or navigational
structure of a Web site. Web analytics can help measure every one.
Optimizing your Web site so that it ranks well in search engines is one of the
first steps in improving your search engine rankings. But how do you know
which keywords to target in your quest for higher rankings? Web analytics
can help.
 Benchmark your search engine standing. You can’t improve your
standing on the search engine front if you don’t know how you’re doing
to begin with. The first step for any good SEO campaign is to figure out
where you stand in the here and now.
 Determine your top converting keywords. Some analytics applications
track conversions and the associated keywords that those buyers, sub-
scribers, leads, and so on use to find your site. WebSideStory’s HitBox
Professional (www.websidestory.com) and Google Analytics (www.
google.com/analytics) are two popular options that offer this fea-
ture. After you know which keywords work for you, you can focus on
optimizing your site for those keywords. To learn more about the vari-
ous tools available, check out Chapter 4.
 Find new keywords to target. The long tail, a concept coined by Wired
editor Chris Anderson, refers to the keywords that fall outside your top
referring keywords. These are terms that don’t send you much traffic
individually, but taken together might outnumber your high-traffic key-
words because there are so many of them. The idea is that you look
beyond your Top 20 keywords and start developing content and pages
for those niche, lower-traffic keywords. Generally, they represent more
very-targeted areas that are less competitive, making it easier for you to
rank well for and monetize (generate revenue from) these keywords. For
more in-depth insight in the long tail concept, read Chapter 12.
223
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

What you’ll find as you venture into the world of SEO is that there are more
strategies than there are hours in the day to implement them. That’s why you
need to focus your efforts on what will pay the highest rate of return. Web
analytics will help you do just that so that you aren’t merely spinning your
wheels when you could be driving to the bank.
Measuring your SEO efforts
If you spend any time at all exploring SEO strategies, you’ll surely want to
know how they pay off in the grand scheme of things. Hopefully, you will
notice lots of new visitors, but it’s likely that there will be at least a short lag
between your site’s search engine ranking improvement and the fruit of your
labors. Or it could be that your SEO efforts completely fail to boost your
search engine rankings at all. Either way, you’ll want to know what effect your
efforts are making, so we are going to take a side step for a moment to talk
about two non-analytics–based metrics: Google PageRank and Alexa Ranking.
Indeed, your Web analytics tools will tell you how your site is performing, but
the software won’t tell you how well your site is performing compared with
your competition. It’s true that Nielsen//Netratings, Hitwise, and comScore
offer industry rankings, but unless you are rolling with the Fortune 500 clan
or have caught the wave of a major emerging trend and become the next
YouTube or MySpace, those benchmarks don’t offer useful comparisons. All
that said, you can still determine how your Web site really ranks against the
rest of the World Wide Web.
Google PageRank
Google PageRank, named after Google founder Larry Page, is Google’s system
for ranking pages. Although the specific algorithm for calculating PageRank is
somewhat guarded, we do know that it’s based on several factors, including
number of incoming links, length of time online, and others. And although it
doesn’t tell you much specifically, the PageRank can give you a general idea
of how important Google thinks your Web site is. The number is based on a 1
to 10 scale. A PageRank of 1 or 2 would indicate that Google does not see
your site as very important, and a 9 or 10 means you’re playing with the big
dogs. If your site does not have a PageRank, it has not been indexed by
Google (in which case you can go to www.google.com/addurl/ to submit
your URL to be crawled at a future update).
When you want to find your PageRank, you have two options:
 Use the Google toolbar or another browser toolbar or extension that
offers this functionality.
 Use PRChecker (www.prchecker.info) or another online PageRank
checking service.
224
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

To use the Google toolbar:
1. Go to http://toolbar.google.com.
2. Click Install Google Toolbar.
3. Follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the toolbar
(see Figure 13-1) in your browser.
The Google Toolbar consists of:
• An enhanced search box that makes suggestions, spelling correc-
tions, and offers a history as you type
• Safe browsing features that offer warnings about Web pages that
may be unsafe
• SpellCheck, a tool that checks your spelling automatically as you
type in Web forms
• AutoFill, a feature that automatically fills out forms for faster
online shopping
4. After the installation is complete, just browse to your Web site to see a
PageRank indicator on the toolbar. (See Figure 13-2.)

225
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

Checking with PRChecker
Several Web sites also offer online tools to check your PageRank if you want
to avoid installing the Google toolbar. Those options are as simple as typing
in your URL then and pressing a button. Using PRChecker as your example,
here is the quick step by step:
1. Point your browser to
http://www.prchecker.info/check_page_rank.php
You’ll see a heading that reads Check Page Rank of Any Web Site Pages
Instantly and a box underneath prefilled with http://.
2. Type your URL in the box (just enter
http://www.yourwebsiteaddress.com) and then click Check PR.
3. Review the results.
A bar and your numeric PageRank accompany the results, as shown in
Figure 13-3.
Figure 13-2:

226
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Alexa Rankings rate you well
Alexa Rankings attempts to give every Web site a numeric ranking. Based on
traffic numbers generated by Alexa toolbar users, the ranking assigns every
site a position. The most heavily trafficked site is in position 1. At the time of
this writing, the site in the number 1 position is Yahoo.com, followed by
MSN.com at number 2, and Google.com at number 3. All the other sites fall in
some ranking below that.
With Google PageRank, the higher the number, the better; with Alexa, the
lower the number, the better.
Because the numbers are based on toolbar users, they are admittedly skewed
(see www.alexa.com/site/help/traffic_learn_more for more info).
Overall, they are another indicator of where your site falls in the grand scheme
of things. And if your search engine campaigns are working well, your ranking
will usually increase accordingly.

info.
227
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

Here’s how to use Alexa Rankings:
1. Point your browser to
http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_500
See Figure 13-4.
2. Type your URL in the box (in the main search box, enter your Web
site, with or without the http, such as yourwebsiteaddress.com) and
then click Get Traffic Details.
3. Review the results.
Results include Traffic Rank for
• Your domain: This is your place in the list. Remember, the lower
the number, the better.
• Sites in the top 100,000.
You’ll also see graphs for Daily Reach, Daily Traffic Rank, and Daily
Pageviews. (See Figure 13-5.)

SEO services can take some time before you see any results. Expect to wait
four to six weeks before your analytics metrics start to show improvement.
You might need to wait even longer for PageRank and Alexa Rankings to
reflect those new traffic numbers.
Extending your geographic reach
When you read the preceding heading, you probably said, “Huh? How much
further can you extend? The World Wide Web already reaches the world.”
Yes, but does it cater to potential customers in various countries around the
world? If your Web site content displays in English only, you limit yourself
dramatically. Depending on which encyclopedia you favor, there are about
190 countries in the world and 6,800 languages.
Approximately 65 to 75 percent of all Internet content is in English despite
the fact that English-speaking Internet users number only 35 percent of the
world’s Internet users, according to Revising. English is still the most widely
spoken language of all Internet users, but 14.1 percent of current Internet
Figure 13-5:

com.
229
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

users speak Chinese, 9.6 percent speak Japanese, 9 percent speak Spanish, 7
percent speak German, 4.1 percent speak Korean, and 3.8 percent speak French.
Now, hold your horses. We aren’t suggesting that you blindly translate your
site to every known language on the face of the Earth, or even the most
common ones for that matter. We are suggesting that you review your Web
analytics data to see whether multitudes of visitors come from certain coun-
tries looking for certain products. If they are, you can make them feel more
welcomed by adding content in their native tongue, adding discounted
express shipping, or even creating a subsection of the site just for the prod-
ucts they seem to care about most.
Reviewing your country statistics is one of the easiest and most exciting Web
analytics activities because you suddenly realize that half the world is watch-
ing, or at least visitors from a few dozen countries. If you are truly going to
leverage this data to find new customers, you need to go beyond exploring
the interesting flags from the foreign ambassadors who travel through your
virtual doors to looking at the hard figures behind them. Here’s how:
1. Point your browser to the control panel.
Generally, you can access your cPanel installation by typing in your URL
followed by a slash and panel. Here’s an example:
http://www.yoururl.com/cpanel
That URL will probably direct you to another URL that corresponds with
your Web hosting provider, so don’t be alarmed if the URL changes. If
you know your hosting company offers cPanel but the preceding instruc-
tions above don’t take you anywhere, you might need to contact your
hosting company to get the URL for your cPanel installation.
2. Enter your username and password and click OK to gain access to the
control panel.
You are greeted with a pop-up box that instructs you to enter your Name
and Password. (See Figure 13-6.) You may choose to select a check box
that offers to remember your password so you don’t have to enter it the
next time around. (If you’ve already forgotten your Name and Password,
of if you never knew what it was to begin with, contact your Web hosting
provider for details.)
3. Locate the AWStats section.
You can find this in the center column — the second category called
Web/FTP Stats.
4. Open AWStats.
5. Find the Who data.
At the column to the right, close to the top, is the Who category. Under
that is the Countries link.
230
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

6. Click the blue Countries link.
You are well on your way to a journey through the nations. (See 
Figure 13-7.)
With your analytics program open, review your country statistics and ask
yourself the following questions:
 How many English-speaking countries are on the list?
 How many Spanish-speaking countries?

Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

 Do you have a large audience of Asian visitors?
 What percentage of your visitors come from other countries?
 What countries convert at the highest rates?
You need to do some visitor labeling in ClickTracks or a similar applica-
tion to track this. Read Chapter 9 on segmenting your visitors to dis-
cover more about this technique.
You might discover you can extend your geographic reach by catering to these
visitor groups that have high conversion rates or by working harder to convert
repeat visitors who aren’t converting, or even by launching campaigns in search
engines and online magazines that target those country groups. Are you starting
to get the Web analytics picture? Knowledge applied is power.
Targeting high conversion categories
Every organization has its most popular items. Content portals often display
lists of the most e-mailed stories for all to see, for example, and customer sup-
port sites typically offer a list of the most asked questions in a convenient list
up front. Much the same, service firms have marquee services and e-commerce
and affiliate marketers have hot ticket items. Web analytics lets you find out
what items, whether FAQs, articles, blog entries, products, or services, so
you can play off that success.
Imagine that you sell 30 different products online. Analyzing your Web analyt-
ics results reveals that customers who purchase electronics and garden sup-
plies have the highest conversion rates and also make the most purchases after
the first sale. Based on your Web analytics reports, it’s clear that you’ve built
a name for yourself in electronics and gardening supplies. You should make it
a priority to not only target those customers with special campaigns to get
them to return, but to find more customers just like them. Visitors trust you
and/or the brands you’ve stocked. Your prices are good, and your site is user
friendly for those types of shoppers. Whatever the case, Web analytics has
just offered up an opportunity to target new customers in those categories
with your advertising and marketing initiatives.
Discovering high conversion categories
You don’t need to rely on Web analytics to discover high conversion categories
of products. Rather, just look at what you are selling. You don’t need to rely
on Web analytics to discover popular services, either. Just make a note of what
your Web leads hire you to do the most. If you are a content portal, blog, online
customer service venue, or some other type of information-based site, you
can discover what your most popular content is by looking at your Pages
report. In AWStats, this report tells you how many times individual pages on
your site were viewed as well as how many people entered your site and
exited your site on that particular page.

Milking Multichannel Sales
As Web analytics software matures, these technologies are beginning to find
ways to integrate online data with offline data to unlock multichannel oppor-
tunities. If you have a brick-and-mortar presence and use the Web as an addi-
tional sales channel, listen up: We’ve got good news for you. Web analytics
firms such as Coremetrics are trying to answer the question, “How can I
leverage knowledge of my customers’ online behavior in my offline marketing
activities?” If you are wondering why on Earth this matters, consider a
Forrester Research that reveals multichannel customers spend three to ten
times as much as single-channel customers, and they have an income that’s
$10,000 per year higher.
Advanced tools such as Coremetrics Live Profiles allow you to import and
export data from offline sources into a data warehouse that will correlate
online and offline data for a comprehensive multichannel analysis. If that
sounds complicated, don’t worry. The bottom line is that multichannel analytics
programs offer the best of both worlds: They help you sell more to existing cus-
tomers and target new customers who share the defined characteristics. If you
have the budget to pay the diggers, there are vendors who can do the digging. If
you don’t have the budget, you can still glean quite a lot by studying certain key
performance indicators (KPIs) as they relate to brick-and-mortar trends.
You could collect any number of KPIs and compare them with in-store behav-
ior. Which KPIs you choose depends on your goals. For this exercise, you
need to either follow individual users through the site or segment them. (You
can read more about segmenting your visitors in Chapter 9.) Check your site
referrer report. For example
 Track navigational paths to see what pages visitors are browsing the most.
 Discover which items are browsed or purchased.
 Calculate the lifetime value of the customer.
 Review data on registration forms to glean demographic information.
The point is to merge what you know about your offline customers with what
you know about your online customers and tap into the synergies that this
knowledge unveils.
Reach Out and Touch Your Referrers
You have friends, family member, or colleagues who are master networkers.
They carry around a stack of business cards with them everywhere they go
and reorder frequently. Networking on the Internet is a much different ball
game and requires different strategies. It’s true that the Internet has created a
233
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

globally interconnected environment that offers never-before-seen access to
potential new customers. However, you can also use that network to discover
potential new partners. These strategic allies are other Web site owners —
and there are plenty of them.
Indeed, as of December 2006, at least 105,244,649 sites were on the World Wide
Web, according to Netcraft. That figure represented an increase of 3.8 million
hostnames from the previous month. All in all, the Web added 30.9 million
sites in 2006, shattering the previous one-year record gain of 17.5 million sites
in 2005. Let us put it to you this way: The Web grew by 41.5 percent in 2006.
Could it be possible that there might be some sites who are speaking to the
same or similar audiences as you, but who aren’t competing for market
share? It’s more than possible.
Like needles in the proverbial haystack
Your challenge is to find allies. Of course, you can do keyword searches and
the like to uncover sites that serve the same niche. That’s part of building a
good link campaign, and we encourage that. However, with more than 100
million sites out there and probably thousands that you could partner with,
you aren’t likely to find them all on your own, no matter how proficient you
are with your favorite search engine.
Web analytics meets the challenge with referrer logs that allow you to iden-
tify the Web sites that sent visitors through your virtual doors. You can dis-
cover Web sites that purposely linked to yours because they were either
interested in your products and services, enjoyed your content, or just
thought your Web site was pretty to look at. In any of those scenarios, you
have the opportunity to establish formal link partnerships with those sites.
As we say in Chapter 7, it’s possible that not all the sites in your referring
sites list actually sent you traffic. The occurrences of referrer spam (sites that
fake sending traffic to you so that you will visit their site when you check
your referrer logs) are becoming more widespread. So if you see sites in your
list that don’t make sense (these sites are often of the “adult” or gambling
genre), just cross them off your list of potential partners.
Here’s how to review your referrer logs:
1. Access your Web analytics tool.
You can review instructions for getting into your control panel in the
earlier section, “Extending your geographic reach.”
234
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

2. Look for the Referrers section.
This is the area within the tool that collects detailed information about
traffic partners. With AWStats, the Referrers section can be found about
three-quarters of the page down on the left side, below the navigation
section.
3. Review sources of Web traffic.
Referrer information is usually grouped into various categories, such as
traffic from bookmarks, newsgroups, search engines, and external Web
sites. For this exercise, ignore everything other than external Web sites.
4. Make a list of external referrers.
Here’s the payoff of the exercise. If you already have link partners, you’ll
recognize them quickly by cross-referencing these links with your partner
list. After you eliminate links incoming from e-mail campaigns (these usu-
ally have an ISP name, such as aol.com, hotmail.com, or bellsouth.
net, in the URL), search engine referrals, affiliate marketers, and Web
ring partners, you’ll have a list of new potential partners who linked to
your site for one reason or another.
Pondering strategic alliances
Now it’s up to you to visit the referring site and determine whether you’d like
to cement the relationship with a mutually beneficial link exchange or some
other arrangement like content sharing, ad banner exchanges, and so on.
Consider the following questions as you ponder whether to forge a strategic
alliance with a particular site referrer.
 Is the referring site talking about your product or service directly or
indirectly? If so, the referring site might already be sold on it. Perhaps
you could offer products in exchange for traffic.
 What has the referring site already said about you? Whether the site
has positive or negative things to say, contacting it might be useful. If
the site dislikes your product or service, this could be a great chance to
start a conversation and find out why.
 Is the referring site of higher or lower quality than yours? Although
quality can be a relative term, you can use metrics such as Alexa and
Google PageRank to see whether the site is much better or worse off
than your own. Getting strategic links from sites that are more highly
regarded than your own helps to raise your rankings.
235
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

 What does the referring site tell you about the types of visitors it
could refer to you? Sometimes you will get a link from a site that talks to
an audience who you never dreamed would be interested in what you
have to offer. This can be a great way to discover new markets.
 What are you willing to give? It’s a give-and-take world. Before you
start approaching Webmasters with ideas about what you want, be pre-
pared with a list of things you are wiling to give. Are you willing to offer
links back to their sites? Are free products a possibility?
Qualifying the leads
When you walk through a shopping mall, you’ll notice that many of the stores
in the mall might have similar appearance in terms of pricing, quality, signage,
and so on. Still, everyone has seen that one out-of-place store. Sometimes it
looks unusually dirty, or maybe it even looks too expensive. It goes without
saying that the store that doesn’t fit in usually doesn’t last very long because
it’s not what shoppers in that area are comfortable with.
Think of referring sites as your neighboring stores in a mall. Users from those
sites are comfortable with those sites, and maybe they just happened across
your site along the way. If your site isn’t up to par with the other shops in the
mall, it could hurt your sales to visitors passing by. By the same token, if the
site that’s referring customers to you is like that dirty, run-down store in the
mall, the quality of customer might not validate an official partnership.
This isn’t to say that you need to redesign your Web site based on every refer-
ring site you see in your report. The idea is to keep a bird’s-eye view of who
your visitors are in relation to where they are coming from. You’ll be surprised
how this can open up new markets for you. Then when you recognize a poten-
tial new market, you can implement a special category or offering for that
particular clientele, which should then reward your insight with more sales.
236
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 
A qualified example
Here’s a “qualified” example of how to qualify
leads. The Sostre & Associates property
Audiobookdeals.com (a site that offers infor-
mation about and places to buy audiobooks),
identified its primary target market as career
persons who have lengthy work commutes.
Although that market was working well, the
Webmaster began to notice lots of incoming
links from sites that target teens. It seems that
teenagers like listening to books on CD or 
MP3 just as much as their commuting parents.
This was a marketing strategy that Audio
bookdeals.com had not previously considered,
which opened up a new and profitable market
for the site.

Understanding Strategic Alliances
Before you can ink a deal with a link partner, you should understand the gen-
eral concept. Our use of the word partnerships in this context is loose. You
aren’t partnering with another Web site like you would partner with a person,
establish a corporation, and share a bank account. Think of it more as a
strategic alliance in which you each offer something valuable to the other. In
the online world, you should be aware of several different types of partner-
ships, from simple link exchanges (where most of the process is handled
automatically and little interaction is required) to complex content licensing
and co-registration agreements. Here are a few of the common types of part-
nerships, along with how to measure their effect in your Web analytics.
Affiliates
Affiliate programs abound on the Internet. If you sell widgets, it might be a
valid option to sell more by signing up affiliates who will put a banner or link
on their site (see Figure 13-8) that opens the door for visitors to clickthrough
to your site.

237
Chapter 13: Increasing Web Site Visibility

Being able to connect sales to their referring affiliate is essential for an affili-
ate program to work. Affiliates will stop sending you traffic if they aren’t being
paid for their sales. When you decide to start an affiliate program, you also
need to decide whether you will be running the program in house or through
an affiliate network like Commission Junction or Linkshare. Affiliate networks
come with their own statistics to help you keep track of your programs per-
formance. For more information, read Chapter 14.
Link exchanges
You could visit a link exchange directory and weed through its listing to see
whether you can find complementary Web sites to exchange links with. Remem-
ber, you are looking for high-quality links. There are even link auctions and
link brokerages you can sign up with. Link exchanges are big business because
quality links help boost your ranking with search engines. You can recognize
your link exchange partners by making a list of your partners’ URLs and refer-
ring back to it to see who is sending you the most traffic. If it turns out that
certain partners aren’t doing you justice, you might want to drop them like a
hot potato and add another link partner instead.
Content sharing
Some sites will let you use their content on your site in exchange for linking
back to them (see Figure 13-9). This can be beneficial when you need more
content for SEO purposes. You can also write articles in free online article
banks, and they will usually link to you. This can help boost your traffic and
position you as an expert in your field.
Co-registrations
Co-registrations are online lead-generating tools based on opt-in e-mail. This
direct marketing strategy allows you to build qualified mailing lists and mem-
bership enrollment by placing your advertisement on subscription-based
sites. Co-registration vendors such as LiveDoor and CoRegistration.com
target ads to precise markets in effort to generate qualified leads. These are
paid partnerships, but they can pay off.

New people, partners, and opportunities
Just think of it. With new people — and new Web sites — coming online liter-
ally every day, there are always fresh opportunities to reach out to potential
customers and partners who have never heard of you before. Web analytics
will help you make your site more visible so that you can target the right 
customers, get them to your site, and turn them into conversions. That last
part — making conversions — might require some Web site optimization. To
discover how to optimize your home page, landing pages, product pages, or
your entire Web site, check out Chapter 16 for the lowdown on fine-tuning
your Web site.

n a world of dozens of competing search engines, banner ad opportunities,
and e-mail marketing service providers, finding ways to spend your money
online is about as easy as it is for a kid to spend money in a candy store. Indeed,
the number of advertising opportunities available through online advertising
networks like DoubleClick, blog advertising networks like PayPerPost, and, of
course, search engine marketing (SEM; a method that seeks to increase the
ranking and visibility of a Web site in search engine results pages) have sky-
rocketed in the recent years.
Online ad revenue just keeps climbing higher and higher. Internet advertising
revenues for the first half of 2006 totaled a mind boggling $7.9 billion, accord-
ing to the Interactive Advertising Bureau. That was a record, folks! It was also
a 37-percent increase over the first half of 2005.
Of course, every online advertising platform offers “unbeatable” advertising
rates and promises a strong return on investment (ROI). But here’s the rub
(and a very sad rub, at that): Not all those ad dollars reaped a return. There’s
no telling exactly how much of that money went down the dot-com drain —
unless you use Web analytics to calculate it. Web analytics empowers you to
find out the truth about your ad campaigns, often with more clarity than
offline advertisers could hope to receive.
In the brick-and-mortar world of print, radio, and television advertising, you
can’t really tell how many people saw and responded to your ad. Sure, you
can distribute coupons in Valpak and get some measure of the effectiveness

of that particular campaign, but how do you really know how many people
responded to that billboard you rented on the highway or how many listen-
ers really responded to your ad on the radio? (Um, you don’t.) Nielsen tries
to measure TV audiences, but face it: It’s still not an exact science. Despite
some admitted X-factors, Web analytics comes closer to the truth.
In this chapter, you discover how to track online advertising campaigns of all
shapes and sizes. You also get a heads-up on some special tools and services
that aim to help you get to the bottom of your ad campaign performance
before you get to the bottom of your budget. Whether you’re an affiliate mar-
keter, as search engine marketer and e-mail marketer, or you engage in some
other form of online advertising, you’ll find some valuable nuggets you can
use immediately to optimize your ad campaigns.
Many Ad Types, Many Analytics Tools
Before we get into the nitty-gritty of measuring online ad and marketing cam-
paigns, we need to lay a foundation about online opportunities. For all the
hype over SEM and pay per click (PPC; also called paid search, which retrieves
listings based on who paid the most money for keywords to appear at the top
of the search heap), many other forms of online ads are available, such as
banners, pop-ups, e-mail campaigns, and affiliate marketing. Web analytics
can help you figure out not only which campaigns are performing but also
which types of initiatives your target audience tends to respond to.
Just like the various forms of online advertising and marketing, you can also
use various ways to track the success of your initiatives using Web analytics.
In fact, different Web analytics tools use different methods to track online
ads. Other Web analytics tools work in conjunction with offline databases to
tap into multichannel customer experiences. If you’re planning for forge into
this territory with both guns blazing, make a review of ad tracking methods
part of your decision-making process before you choose a Web analytics tool.
To read more about the basics of choosing a Web analytics program, see
Chapter 5. Or, if you want special Web analytics software that’s designed to
track PPC campaigns and the like, be sure to check out some additional top
options in Chapter 6. Whatever you do, don’t get stuck in the paralysis of
analysis while you ponder over tools.
The bottom line is this: If you engage in online advertising and marketing, you
need to engage Web analytics tools to track it. A simple tool is better than no
tool at all.

Tracking Efforts with Tracking URLs
We start the journey into online advertising and marketing measurement 
with some practical tips on tracking SEM, banner, pop-up, and pop-under ads.
Pop-under ads are like pop-ups except the viewer doesn’t see them until she
closes the browser window. That can make it difficult for the viewer to dis-
cern what site snuck up on her with an advertising message.
Running a quick-and-dirty Google search makes it abundantly clear that there
is no lack of free or low-cost online tools to help you execute the many differ-
ent aspects of online marketing and online advertising. You can find free tools
to create banners, choose combinations of keywords, manage your bids . . . you
get the idea. (Of course, you still have to pay for the advertising and market-
ing campaigns that you eventually execute.) Unless you are an SEM expert,
you need all the help you can get, so use these resources wisely. As you use
these tools, you’ll find that Web analytics tools become useful once again
because you can measure the efficacy of the keyword combinations or ban-
ners that these free tools created. You may find out you’re better off hiring a
pro or educating yourself with some other book in the For Dummies series.
Using tracking URLs is fairly foundational to tracking your online campaigns.
Google defines tracking URLs as “URLs appended with parameters that pro-
vide information about the source of the click, the search query used, and
other advertising metrics. Tracking URLs help advertisers determine the
effectiveness of their ads and/or keywords on non-AdWords channels.”
Simply, tracking URLs do just what they sound like: They track your ads so
that you can tell which ones work and which ones merely cost you money.
Tracking URLs are largely independent of your analytics application; however,
your analytics application uses them to tell you how each individual ad or
marketing initiative you’ve launched is performing. Tracking URLs are fairly
simple to implement. Imagine that you sell everything under the sun having
to do with golf. You decide to place a banner ad on Golfersmag.com because
it targets your audience precisely. Sounds like a great idea, but you want to
know that it’s a great idea. That’s where tracking URLs come into play.
Here’s how it works: Instead of using your standard link to your home page
(www.yoursite.com), use a tracking URL.
1. Assign a number to your campaign.
If the ad in Golfersmag.com is your one and only ad, you might call it
ad1. If you have a slew of ads across the Web, it might well be ad29.
243
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy

2. Create a tracking URL, using the number.
Append a tracking variable that identifies the campaign number to your
URL. One example might look like this:
http://yoursite.com/?src=ad1
In the example, we used “src” as the name of the variable. The “src” vari-
able is short for “source.” The actual variable can be whatever you want.
The tracking URL would be just as effective any of the following ways:
http://yoursite.com/?ad=1
http://yoursite.com/?campaign=ad1
http://yoursite.com/?ref=ad1
The URL will still go to your home page (or the landing page of your
choice if you use something like
http://yoursite.com/landingpage.html?src=ad1)
but it will log the variable that was used. This is the URL that you give to
your account manager (or enter into a Web-based ordering system).
3. Check the results of the campaign.
Now you can
 Segment visitors who enter your site with that parameter. Use
ClickTracks or another analytics application that allows for this kind of
visitor segmentation to compare the traffic from this campaign against
your nonpaid traffic and traffic from other campaigns. (Visitor segmenta-
tion means grouping users based on similar traits or activities.)
 Compare the following:
• Bounce rates: This metric shows the percentage of entrances on
any individual page that resulted in the visitor’s immediate exit
from the site.
• Average time on site.
• Conversion rates: This is the percentage of visitors who took the
desired call to action.
Tracking keywords with Google Analytics
Although you can use tracking URLs for banners and pop-ups, Google offers a
neat tool — URL builder — specifically for its AdWords users. All you have to
do is fill in a simple form and then click the Generate URL button. Of course,
you need to know how to tag links in order to leverage this tool. If your Google
Analytics account has been linked to an active AdWords account, you don’t
need to tag your AdWords links. An auto-tagging feature will do it for you auto-
matically. In order, here’s how to do it in conjunction with Google’s URL builder.
244
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Tag only what you need
Some links don’t need tagging. Others, though, such as organic keyword links
(links that are naturally associated with certain pages on your site) can’t be
tagged. You don’t need to tag links that come from referral sites, such as por-
tals or affiliates, because Google Analytics is smart enough to automatically
detect the name of the search engine and the keywords from those sources,
usually under Organic listings. Google Analytics also displays referrals from
other Web sites, regardless of whether you tagged them. This will save you a
lot of hassle in the tagging process.
Create tracking URLs in URL builder
You do need to create tracking URLs for your non-AdWords–paid keyword
links, your banners and other ads, and the links inside your promotional
e-mail messages. If you use this tool, you won’t have to worry about where
the question mark, the parameter used to separate variables in a URL, goes
or other syntax issues. (See the previous section for step-by-step instructions
if you prefer not to use a tracking URL tool.)
Use only the campaign variables you need
Google Analytics’ link tagging capabilities let you uniquely identify any and
all of your campaigns by virtue of its five fields:
 Campaign Source: Banner ad, e-mail campaign, PPC keywords
 Campaign Medium: Banner, e-mail, cost per click
 Campaign Term: A descriptive phrase or keyword to identify the ad
245
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy
Pesky pop-ups and blockers
Plenty of debate abounds, swirling around the
intrusiveness of pop-up ads. That’s why
browser makers such as Microsoft and Mozilla
offer pop-up blockers. Pop-up ads introduce
some interesting problems for Web analytics.
For starters, using pop-up ads can skew the
traffic stats because they can automatically
open windows to sites regardless of whether
the user really wants to see them. And pop-up
ads make it impossible to determine whether a
visitor intended to visit a site or was ushered
there through a pop-up ad that was closed 
with annoyance. If the tracking URL in your 
pop-up ad reveals that users left within 20 sec-
onds of being escorted to your site unaware,
you haven’t succeeded — and, in fact, could be
alienating visitors.
Don’t get us wrong: We aren’t against pop-up
ads, per se. The bottom line is they might send
traffic to your site, but it’s not from folks who
chose to go there, so the hit probably won’t 
convert as well as from traffic that choose to
clickthrough to your site through a traditional
banner ad.

 Campaign Content: Used to differentiate ads for the same company
 Campaign Name: Product, promo code, or slogan
Google recommends using Source, Medium, Term, and Name for most 
campaigns.
Click the Generate URL button
Click the Generate URL button. If you make a mistake or want to change any
of the variables, click the Clear button.
Tracking URLs cons
Tracking URLs are beautiful — when they work. Unfortunately, their simplic-
ity is also their weakness. Plainly put, if the tracking variable is replaced or
removed by an ad serving platform or script, the tracking will not work. In
the vocabulary of Webmasters, the link can “break.”
Imagine that you’re a writer and want to generate more leads for your copy-
writing services. You might choose to run a banner ad on a popular site where
your target audience frequents, such as MediaBistro.com. If the publisher has
a system that tracks clicks on its end, the code that it uses to track the click
and then redirect them to your site might affect the tracking URL on your
end. That makes using tracking URLs less than 100 percent accurate.
So before you run to the publisher and complain that your ad isn’t generating
any hits, keep the imperfections of tracking URLs in mind. However, for the
most part, tracking URLs do work well. Again, using an imperfect tool that
tracks most of, but not all, your advertising referrals is better than not using
a tool at all. If you’re really concerned, you could include a drop-down menu
on the conversion page that asks how the visitor learned about you.
Adding Campaign Analytics to the Mix
Campaign analytics is a subset, or niche, of Web analytics. Campaign analytics
track ad and marketing campaigns specifically and can come as part of a
robust Web analytics program or be sold individually from niche players. In
Chapter 6, we offer CampaignTracker and BlackTrack as two examples of
campaign analytics just to whet your appetite for these focused tools. However,
if you’re serious about online advertising, you’ll want to review a few addi-
tional tools to make sure you choose the one that’s right for you.
246

Although the baseline functions are typically the same, you’ll find that each
tool has its own unique features. CampaignTracker, for example, offers com-
petitive reporting and engine-to-engine comparisons. BlackTrack offers live
analysis. Check out these tools to find out what else is available. During your
journey, you might discover that some tools are a better fit for the type or depth
of your campaigns, or just your personal data digestion preferences. Here is a
short-list of vetted tools you might choose to put your magnifying glass to.
Openads points you to profits
www.openads.org
Openads bills itself as the most popular online advertising software. It’s essen-
tially an open source ad server with an integrated banner-management interface
and tracking system that gathers statistics. If you offer banner advertising, this
software has some attractive features. For example, you can rotate paid banners
with your own in-house advertisements. You can also integrate banners from
third-party advertising companies into the measurement mix. Openads also
tracks all types of banners, from buttons to pop-ups to text ads and even Flash
banners. The software is free although donations are accepted.
TrackPoint ad tracking
www.alentus.com/hosted-applications/trackpoint.asp
TrackPoint boasts performance tracking dollar-by-dollar, click-by-click on all
your online advertising campaigns. This is a hosted service developed by
Alentus. Whether you have a single campaign or dozens of different cam-
paigns of various types (such as PPC, banners, newsletter links, and so on),
this program lets you see the big picture on the total spend or drill down to
individual campaigns.
The software also reports exactly which keywords and keyphrases visitors
typed into all major search engines to arrive at your site. You can use these
reports to add keyword density to your site. Keyword density is the ratio of
the number of occurrences an individual keyword to the total number of
words on a page. This is one aspect of search engine optimization (SEO; a
method of improving the rankings for relevant keywords in search results by
making changes to the content or navigational structure of a Web site).
This program integrates with a shopping cart for easier conversion tracking.
TrackPoint costs $9.95 per month or $99.95 per year.

Clickalyzer’s marketing co-ops
www.clickalyzer.com
Clickalyzer has some interesting features from the SEM perspective with
eight real-time reports. Beyond all the basic analytics and visitor segmenta-
tion capabilities, Clickalyzer actually tells you how much of your marketing
copy a visitor read. You can see the last page your visitor saw before he
accepted or rejected your offer. You can even run a marketing co-op with 
several other marketers who all promote the same product. Just combine
your advertising budget and use Clickalyzer’s split testing to accurately
divide the visitor’s between your URLs.
The program costs $29.95 per month, $299.95 per year, or $599.95 for a life-
time account.
Bid management and keyword optimizer tools aren’t Web analytics, but you
can use them in tandem with your Web analytics tools — and you probably
should if you spend lots of money on PPC advertising. Keyword optimizers
can help you discover the best keywords for your campaign. Bid manage-
ment tools can help you organize your online ad spending. Instead of logging
in to three or four search engine marketing interfaces, you can log in to one
service and execute your campaigns. If you don’t have much experience in

Combating Click Fraud
Even though we briefly mention click fraud — purposely clicking ad listings
without any intention of making a purchase from the advertiser — other
places through this book, we couldn’t write a chapter on revisiting your
online advertising strategy without a thorough review of click fraud and the
tools available to prevent it. Click fraud has been called one of the biggest
threats to the continued growth of SEM, and we agree. It’s also opening up
new opportunities for vendors to generate revenue, or add value to existing
products, by helping you fight it.
Listen, the cost of click fraud isn’t chump change. Market researcher Outsell
estimates that advertisers wasted over $800 million on click fraud in 2005
alone. Surveyed advertisers say they believe about 15 percent of all clicks are
bogus, and 75 percent have been victims at least once. (That means some
were victims more than once!) Click fraud has prompted nearly 30 percent of
advertisers to stop spending on click-based initiatives. Outsell figured that
Google and Yahoo! have lost $500 million because some advertisers have
drawn back from this form of advertising.

Here’s the deal. Click-based advertising works. You just have to be wise as
the proverbial owl in this day and age where cyberbandits are turning the
World Wild Web into the Wild Wild West, organizing virtual hold-ups designed
to leave your advertising budget stranded on the side of the dusty trail. Don’t
get into your covered wagon without your weapons. Instead, ride with a
posse (in the form of click fraud tools) that can stop those crooks before they
have a chance to rob you blind. Click fraud perpetrators could be competi-
tors trying to bleed your PPC campaign dry or angry customers trying to take
revenge incognito.
Check into your SEM providers’ policies. Google, for example, launched its
Cost Per Action service (available by invitation only at the time of this writ-
ing). Advertisers pay only when a user takes a demonstrable action after
clicking. Still, that might not be enough. That’s why vendors are emerging
with an arsenal of click fraud tools to combat this slick debauchery. Check
out these weapons and wield them boldly.

The official online ad guide
In November 2004, the Interactive Advertising
Bureau (IAB) Measurement Task Force issued
a global standard for counting online ad impres-
sions. It was the first time that any advertising
medium developed a measurement standard
that measures the ad itself, as delivered to 
a consumer. In other words, using this mea-
surement standard tells you in no uncertain
terms whether folks viewed your ad or not.
Other forms of advertising (such as radio, TV, or 
magazines) can only rely on the number of
potential viewers. The guideline standardizes
how and when an ad impression is counted and
has offered the global media buying commu-
nity consistent and accurate data. Keep in mind
that these guidelines do not measure paid
search, rich media, or broadband commercials.
Measurements for those forms of interactive
advertising, though, are in the works. Behind all
of this, of course, is Web analytics.

CFAnalytics: Free and plenty of perks
www.cfanalytics.com
CFAnalytics is a free click-fraud reporting and monitoring service from Click
Forensics. You can’t beat the price, and the features of this page tag-based
click-fraud reporting system are pretty keen, too. You can track up to 100,000
clicks per month and get a free weekly e-mail report with an overview of your
PPC campaigns. You can also access reports online to help you manage 
your PPC campaigns and access the Member’s Only section of the Click Fraud
Network, where you’ll find a Click Fraud Index and campaign reports detailing
click fraud threat level by term and search provider. This is advanced stuff —
and, again, it’s free.
AdWatcher adds it all up for you
www.adwatcher.com
AdWatcher does it all. It monitors your ad campaigns for fraudulent activity,
helps you track your ROI, and manages your online advertising from one cen-
tral location. This tool claims that it can save you up to 50 percent in click
fraud charges. This solution will not only detect suspicious activity, but it also
works with search engines to recover money that click fraudsters ripped from
your clutches. This program offers over 20 metrics to analyze your campaigns,
organizes your campaigns by group, and reveals which keywords convert best
in your PPC campaign. This service costs $25 to monitor up to 3,000 clicks per

WhosClickingWho?
www.whosclickingwho.com
WhosClickingWho claims to be the first pay-per-click detection service. We
won’t deny or substantiate that claim, but we can tell you that the software
cuts to the point in a hurry. After five repeated clicks from a PPC listing to your
Web site, a ClickMinder tool pops up to deter potential abusers. (You can set
the parameters to warn clickers at the number of clicks you decide upon.) Pop-
up blockers won’t block ClickMinder, which tells the clicker the following:
You appear to be abusing our search engine listing. YOUR ACTIONS ARE
BEING LOGGED. Please stop clicking on our search engine listing.
You can also select a custom message that isn’t so “in your face.”
The tracking offers proof you need to take to search engines to get your
money back. The fee is $30 per month for up to 5,000 clicks.

Evaluating E-mail Marketing Campaigns
Despite the growing number of spam messages jamming up e-mail boxes, direct
marketers still find value in legitimate opt-in e-mail marketing campaigns.
Web analytics can add tremendous value to e-mail marketers by making way
for more targeted e-mail communications that are based on measured visitor
behavior. Although server-side analytics (analytics software installed on the
Web site’s server) offers only limited information about e-mail marketing
campaign success (you can view your site referrer report to discover links
from URLs with ISP names, like AOL or Hotmail, in the code), a maturing
client-side analytics market is opening up possibilities to integrate Web ana-
lytics and e-mail marketing.
This is an important development because much like PPC, you can spend
bundles of money on e-mail marketing in a hurry. What’s more, you can also
come off as an irritant to the recipients. If you don’t believe us, just ask the
Direct Marketing Association (DMA; www.the-dma.org). That makes e-mail
marketing analytics programs vital to the online direct marketer. Of course,
the market for e-mail analytics is still shaking out. Right now, large analytics
vendors such as WebTrends, Coremetrics, and Digital River are integrating
metrics with e-mail. Here’s a look at some of the capabilities available today.
WebTrends targets markets
www.webtrends.com
WebTrends works with ExactTarget, a third-party e-mail solutions provider.
Customers can view Web metrics on top of e-mail campaign performance and
drill down to the clickstream level to create visitor segments that ultimately
allow more targeted marketing. You can compare the performance of your

Remote Tracking 101
Clickalyzer is mentioned several times in this
chapter and for good reason. It has plenty of
options tweaked just for search marketers like
you. One unique feature that might appeal to
marketers who promote cost per action (CPA)
offers and don’t actually make the sale on their
sites is Remote Tracking. Clickalyzer coined the
term that refers to the ability to track activity on
a Web site that you promote but don’t own. In
other words, you no longer have to be content
just sending traffic to a site and tracking how
many clickthroughs you generated for that site.
Now, you can actually see what the traffic you
sent the advertiser did after they got there — all
the way to the point of sale. Remote Tracking
lets you verify that the advertiser credits you for
the sales you sent.

campaigns and capture the key performance indicators (KPIs; metrics that
illustrate how well the site is performing against goals) and conversion events
that are most important to measuring your success. You can also use the
data to create more targeted lists.
www.coremetrics.com
Coremetrics has been perhaps the most aggressive in this area. The firm
works with Responsys, Digital Impact, Yesmail, and CheetahMail to measure
e-mail marketing success. Coremetrics automatically feeds behavioral data
into these e-mail marketing platforms so that you can deliver targeted cam-
paigns based on a customer’s recent behavior, such as what categories the
visitor clicked or what was in her shopping cart before she left the site.
www.digitalrover.com
Digital River now owns Fireclick and BlueHornet and offers an integrated
product designed to enhance e-mail marketing opportunities. The company
also wraps bid management tools into its package, along with message wiz-
ards that guide you through the e-mail message creation process as well as a
spam rating tool that lets you check your content and layout for factors that
have been proven to trigger filters and event-triggered messaging for greater
relevance. This is a comprehensive package for the Internet marketer.
Reaching for relevancy
Sometimes — well, actually most of the time — you need to exercise some
good, old-fashioned common sense to interpret your Web analytics. Case in
point: More is not always better when it comes to e-mail marketing. If you
expect to get clickthroughs that lead to sales but get no action or even opt-
outs, you might be bombarding subscribers with too many messages. A DMA
survey reveals that the opt-out rate (the percentage of recipients who request
to be removed from a mailing list) for recipients who were contacted via
e-mail every month was below 1 percent. Recipients who were contacted on a
weekly basis were more likely to become disinterested. The result: a 2.5 per-
cent opt-out rate.
The good news is that the more relevant your content, the lower the opt-out
rate — and, by default, the higher the chances that the recipient will click-
through and take the desired action on your site. DMA research proves it: As
e-mail messages have become more targeted and relevant, clickthrough rates
have improved. Two-thirds of e-mail service providers experienced opt-out
rates of less than 0.5 percent in 2006 compared with 44 percent in 2005.
252
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

E-mail marketing KPIs to monitor
When you launch your e-mail marketing campaign, you’ll receive what amounts
to an analytics report from your e-mail service provider. This report tells you
the fate of the e-mails you sent, such as
 Bounces: The number of e-mails that didn’t get delivered
 Opt-outs
 Open rate: The percentage of recipients who opened your e-mail
 Clicks
Your job is to review that report with KPIs in mind. (You can read much more
about KPIs in Chapter 11.) You’ll want to keep track of these KPIs while you
seek to measure the effect of your e-mail marketing campaigns.
Open rate: Facts and myths
Modern technology is so wonderful that it can tell you not only how many
e-mails were opened but also which recipients opened the message. Of course,
you can’t tell whether the recipient actually read the message or engaged
with your e-mail. Sometimes, a recipient does indeed open — and even read —
your e-mail, but it doesn’t get recorded. We won’t bore you with the techno
mumbo-jumbo. Suffice it to say that if the recipient has text-only e-mail, your
system may not be able to track that the email was opened. What’s more,
some programs will count a new Open each time the recipient opens the mes-
sage, even if that’s several times a day.
Thus, you can see that using an Open rate isn’t an exact science (and that’s
putting it kindly). For all these reasons, don’t think of the Open rate as the 
be-all-end-all measurement. However, Open rates are good for comparing the
apparent success of different e-mail campaigns. Higher Open rates could
mean more relevant messaging, more effective subject lines, or a more tar-
geted list from an e-mail service provider.
If you switch providers and see massive drop-offs, consider switching back to
your original vendor. If you switch subject line strategies and it leads to more
Opens, you’ve hit on something that works. Maybe you changed to an action
verb or a popular keyword for that market. If your Open rate to AOL accounts
is 50 percent but your Open rate to Hotmail is 0 percent, there’s probably an
issue with Hotmail users receiving your message. If they don’t receive the
message, open it, and read it, you’ve wasted your time.
253
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy

Clickthroughs in context
After you have a handle on the Open rate, you can put the clickthrough rate
in context. Visitors can’t clickthrough if they don’t open the e-mail. A high
number of clickthroughs could mean that your e-mail message hit home. Your
price was good, your copywriting was keen, or the reader saw some other
benefit to clicking through. Still, that’s not the bottom-line story.
Calculating cost per lead
The cost-per-lead generated via e-mail is a key metric to watch. Because an
e-mail recipient might initially clickthrough to your site but then visit several
times before taking the desired action (downloading a file, registering, pur-
chasing, and so on), you need to know how much you are paying to drive traf-
fic to your site. To determine this metric, divide the number of leads into the
cost of the e-mail campaign. To keep it simple, if you pay $100 to send out the
e-mails and generate 500 leads, it costs you $.50 per lead. If you spend $500 to
get 100 leads, it costs you $5 per lead.
Calculating cost per conversion
At the end of the day, what you ultimately want to know is the cost-per-
conversion generated via e-mail. To determine this metric, divide the number
of conversions into the cost of the e-mail campaign. Once again, to keep it
simple, if you pay $100 to send out the e-mails and you generate $500 in sales,
it costs you an average of $5 to make each sale. You came out on top. Alterna-
tively, if it costs you $500 to send out the e-mails and you generate $100 in
sales, you are upside-down. You lost.
More e-mail marketing KPIs
Here’s a list of a few more e-mail marketing KPIs that you might want to track.
Like with any KPIs, your goal is to choose a select few that make the most
effect on your campaigns. You’ll notice that many e-mail marketing KPIs
depend on Web analytics work together to tell you the whole story.
 Campaign over campaign open rates
 Campaign over campaign clickthroughs
 Send to a friend
 Average order value
 Number of site visits
 Average page views
 Length of site visit
 List growth

Tracking Offline Responses to Online Ads
Web analytics is not just for the Web anymore. As the technology matures,
these tools are being used to track what is happening in multiple channels.
(You can read more about milking multichannel sales in Chapter 13.) Beyond
philosophical talks of how online ads generate brand awareness even if the
consumer doesn’t act upon them, you can certainly track how your online
ads led to online sales. This is important, with comScore estimating that 60
percent to 90 percent of all conversions happen offline. Tracking the return
on your ad spend, then, is critical to understanding your profit margins.
Tracking an offline response to online ads taps into a concept delayed conver-
sions, which start online but conclude offline some time later. Say that your
online conversion rate is 4 percent. If you take delayed conversions into
account, it could really be 5 percent. That means what you are doing online is
more effective than you thought it was. Tracking offline responses to online
ads — or mere site visitors for that matter — gives you the big picture. The

Measuring mobile marketing
Many believe that mobile advertising is the
wave of the future. Indeed, it’s already gaining
momentum. Market researcher M:Metrics
(www.mmetrics.com) launched a definitive
metrics for mobile advertising in late 2006 and
found that a sizeable percentage of mobile sub-
scribers are responding to short codes placed
in advertisements or in other media. The firm
compares the state of mobile advertising with
what we saw in e-mail response during the mid-
1990s as the Web emerged as an advertising
medium, with as many as 29 percent of mobile
subscribers responding to text message ads.
The data signals that multimedia convergence
is a reality today — and a growing one.
This data, combined with the fact that Smart
Phones are becoming pervasive, makes it easy
to imagine targeted ads strategically served to
your mobile device while you walk through the
Macy’s. The retailer could alert you to a special
in the furniture department as you approach the
second floor. The movement, dubbed m-com-
merce (for mobile-commerce), is coming to a
cell phone near you. Google has already cre-
ated a mobile AdWords platform, complete with
the ability to set daily spending budgets, estab-
lish schedule marketing messages and make
payments only when consumers click, so it
seems only a matter of time before the concept
takes off. 
The next question is: How do we measure it?
WebSideStory HBX Analytics platform allows
publishers and marketers to measure both
streaming media and mobile device user behav-
ior. With this tool, you can measure mobile
devices used by visitors, with details about the
device brand, model, and service provider. This
is an area of analytics that’s sure to mature as
the market demands more robust solutions.

delayed conversion concept is especially prevalent with lead generation sites
where, even though there might be an online registration form, customers
tend to call a week later to sign up for that new bank account or inquire
about that new car.
Using coupon codes
Using coupon codes can clue you in to a conversion process that began
online but escaped the boundaries of the World Wide Web and continued in
the physical world. The travel industry offers a strong example of using
coupon codes in connection with reservations. If Hotel ABC runs an online
banner ad campaign on a popular online travel portal, it might instruct the
viewer to use booking code XC#89. The viewer picks up the phone and calls
the agency to book the reservation. That booking code ties the viewer to that
specific ad. This takes some offline database expertise because the sales
agent needs access to online promotional information to tie the viewer in
with the booking code. By the same token, any retailer could offer an online
coupon code that offers 5 percent off the purchase price and can be used
online or offline.
Using unique URLs
You can use unique URLs in your offline advertising and see whether it trig-
gers an online response. Say you run a print ad in a women’s fashion maga-
zine for a new line of handbags that you sell exclusively online. Tracking the
success of that specific ad is as easy as
 Including a unique URL in the ad: Hint: Make it easy to remember, like
www.mycompany.com/europeanbags.
 Using the URL only for that particular campaign.
If that landing page features the handbags and offers mentioned in the ad, it
will ensure a quick connection in the consumer’s mind, and you are well on
your way to converting the visitor. If visitors did not convert, perhaps your
landing page was not making the connection, and they really didn’t want to
spend the money on a European handbag. At least you know the ad got them
there, though.
Using unique toll-free phone numbers
Another strategy for tracking ads that publish online but convert offline is to
include a unique toll-free number in the ad. When operators answer that line,
they know that the caller viewed your ad on the Internet and can relate it to
256
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

the specific offer she saw. Again, this takes some database integration if you
have heavy call volumes. (And, of course, you can afford it if your phones are
ringing off the hook with new sales, right?) Still, this tracking can help you
know exactly how well your online ad worked. Although it’s possible that the
consumer remembered your company name and not the phone number and
called your general toll-free number, this method offers you the possibility of
tracking offline conversions.
Ferreting Out Ad Stats that Don’t Work
Measuring your online advertising strategies is an ongoing process. That’s
why the title of this chapter is “Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy.”
What brought high-targeted traffic that converted at record numbers last
year might or might not work again this year. And that’s why it’s important to
benchmark your data so you can compare last year’s data with this year’s
data to uncover hidden trends. Read more about how to do that in Chapter
15. For now, we help you concentrate on some current comparisons that will
help you ferret out ad strategies that don’t work.
Comparing engine to engine
If you’re trying to ferret out paid search campaigns that threaten to rob your
children’s inheritance, use your Web analytics report to compare search
engine to search engine. Some simple metrics can tell a lot about the quality
of the traffic you are receiving, and one of the easiest ways to compare those
metrics is to use the ClickTracks Labels feature. Labels are ClickTracks’ way
of segmenting visitors, which is quite powerful in that it allows you to group
users by traits. You can segment visitors based on behavior such as what
search engine or site they came from, what page they entered on, what time
of day they came, and more.
Labeling for entry pages
The following steps show you how to use your tracking URLs for each cam-
paign you ran to group visitors by those tracking variables. Then you will see
in no uncertain terms which SEM campaigns performed well and which ones
didn’t. To set up visitor labels for certain entry page parameters in
ClickTracks Analyzer, here’s all you have to do:
1. Open the ClickTracks application.
2. On the home page or dashboard of your ClickTracks application, click
the Advanced Labels button (center of the page).
This opens the Advanced Labeling Visitor Wizard; see Figure 14-1.

5. In the second drop-down box, enter
?src=XXX
where XXX is substituted for whatever your variable your tracking URL
uses. (See Figure 14-3.)
6. Click Next.
7. Leave the Inverse (Count if Criterion NOT Met) check box clear. Then
click Next.
8. Make sure that all the check boxes under Display Options are
enabled. Then click Next.
9. Choose a display color and name for this label and then click Finish.
You can follow the preceding steps to define a label for every campaign and
tracking URL that you use. That will segment out those particular users. The
next step in your engine-to-engine comparison activity is to use the data gen-
erated by Labels to conduct a side-by-side comparison of traffic quality.
Comparing your traffic quality
To determine how the traffic quality from one search engine compares with
the traffic quality from another search engine, follow these steps:
1. Open the ClickTracks application.
2. On the home page or dashboard of your ClickTracks application, click
the Site Overview button (lower right of the page).
This opens the Site Overview page.

step 3.
259
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy

3. Scroll down slightly.
You see a section for Average Time on Site and Page Views Per Visitor.
(See Figure 14-4.)
These two metrics are a great way to quickly evaluate the traffic you are
receiving from your different campaigns. For the most part, the longer that
users stay on your site and the more pages they visit, the higher the quality
of the traffic.
Comparing keyword to keyword
You could just as easily drill the above example down to the keyword level
even if you’re using only one search engine. Suppose you put your entire
advertising budget into Google. (That might or might not be a wise decision.
Fortunately, your Web analytics program will tell you.) You can then choose
to compare the performance of one keyword against another keyword by seg-
menting your site’s visitors based on those keywords.
Practically speaking, if your site sells comic books and you ran AdWords cam-
paigns with Batman, Superman, Spiderman, and X-Men, your task is to seg-
ment your users based on the keywords through which they entered the site.
You’d have one segment, then, that was looking for the bat cave, another that
loved to leap tall buildings in a single bound, and so on. After segmentation,
you can analyze the behavior of those visitors up to the point of conversion.
If you find that X-Men blew Spiderman away (figuratively speaking, of course),
you might want to up your spend on X-Men at Spidey’s expense.
Figure 14-4:

Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Web analytics gives you raw metrics. You still need to use some common
sense and sometimes some street smarts, too, to determine what those num-
bers really mean. While you are making these comparisons, keep external
market influences in mind. What works one summer might not work in the
winter. For example, if a new Spiderman movie comes out in the summer
months, it’s only natural that those keywords would perform better. That fad
might die out in a few months when people get sick of all things Spidey and
move on to the next cool comic. The same goes for generators during hurri-
cane season or perfume around Valentine’s Day. (Even Homer Simpson could
figure that one out. D’oh!)
Unraveling Conversion 
Process Breakdowns
You might spend $1,000, $5,000, or more on a campaign, but when you’re
done, you don’t have a single conversion to show for it. The immediate
assumption is that the ad campaign belly flopped in the pool of SEM. (Ouch!)
But could it be possible that other forces at work caused your visitors to bail
out on you? It’s not only possible, but it’s likely. Before you rush to judgment,
you need to examine your conversion process for breakdowns as it relates to
the keywords you chose for your campaign. That means that the problem
could be on your site rather than on the search engine that sent the visitor to
your site. It’s been said that blame is the guard to change. So don’t point fin-
gers at Google, Yahoo!, and others until you examine your site.
Possibly, your paid search or banner traffic didn’t convert because of some dis-
connect in the visitors’ minds between your advertising campaign and what
they found on your site when they clicked through. So it might be your own
stinkin’ fault instead of the search engine that sent the visitor to your site.
261
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy
Determining the cost of traffic
Here’s another example from the Sostre &
Associates Web property, FreeBookClubs.com.
The affiliate marketing publisher was running
several separate online keyword campaigns
with different SEM vendors promoting the site.
Using Web Analytics, the team was able to seg-
ment the visitors based on what campaign they
were coming from. Specifically, that meant seg-
menting Yahoo!, Google, Miva, Kanoodle, and a
few other second-tier search engines.
The results revealed that as a whole, the traffic
that came to the site from one of the engines
had an 80 percent bounce rate. Google and
Yahoo! were just about even, posting a 30-per-
cent bounce rate. Those figures made it clear
that money was being wasted on some of the
second-tier engines. Even though the cost of the
traffic was far less on the lesser-known engines,
the quality of the traffic was too poor to keep the
return on the investment out of the red.

Understanding the conversion funnel
Google describes conversion funnels as a series of pages through which a visi-
tor must pass before reaching the conversion goal (desired visitor action). In
the Google Analytics world, the name comes from a graph of visitors who
reach each page. The first page in the funnel counts the most visitors. Each
successive page shows fewer visitors as they exit the site before reaching the
finish line.
Read more about conversion funnels in Chapter 17.
Tracking the pages represented in the conversion funnel is important. One
reason is to see how efficiently your pages direct your heard-earned visitors
to the final destination you have in mind. You can discover quite a bit about
specific pages by reviewing the conversion funnel. If you see visitors moving
right along until they get to a certain page but then witness dramatic drop
offs, perhaps the design of your page isn’t user-friendly. Or, perhaps your
prices are too high, your information isn’t satisfying, or some other negative
visitor perception is amiss.
Cueing in to conversion funnel issues
Imagine that your visitor lands (enters your Web site) on the home page.
From there, he clicks through to a product or service page that interests
them. Your snazzy photos and/or compelling copywriting did the trick. The
visitor wants what you’ve got. So he moves on to the next step: conversion.
(That’s the conversion funnel in its simplest form. In reality, it doesn’t typi-
cally happen that fast. Visitors might click around and around, leave, come
back, place items in the cart, abandon the cart, come back again later, and
repeat the process several times before actually converting.)
Now, put your math mind on. We’re going to associate some numbers with
the simplified funnel we just took you through. If 100 percent of your visitors
hit the home page but only 25 percent continued on to the product or service
page, you lost 75 percent of your traffic before they even had a chance to see
your diverse array of products and services. There could be many reasons
for this. Maybe your home page is poorly designed, or your shopping cart is
difficult to navigate, or the page could simply be failing to make that keyword
connection. By setting up specific KPIs for each of those areas, you can deter-
mine where you can start plugging the holes in your funnel. See Chapter 11
for the lowdown on KPIs.

Examining Google’s Conversion Funnel
As we discuss, you can discover at what point in the conversion process your
visitor bailed out on you by looking at certain reports in your analytics data.
Google Analytics, as well as other analytics providers, offer visual views of
your conversion funnel and other metrics that indicate where users bailed
out. If your site is having trouble closing the sale, you’ll want to become best
friends with this report as you make site changes and watch how they affect
your funnel. We’ll show you how to get started with goals and funnels with
Google Analytics. For an extensive lesson on how to use this program, pick
up a copy of Google Analytics (Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Suppose you’re trying to drive visitors to a particular landing page. That
could be a product page, an e-mail registration page, or a page that describes
your stellar services. You can track the number of successful conversions
using goals and funnels in Google Analytics. Each profile can have up to four
goals, with a defined funnel for each goal. With your Google Analytics pro-
gram open, here’s how to set up goals and funnels in Google Analytics:
To enter goal information, follow these simple steps:
1. From the Analytics Settings page, find the profile for which you will
be creating goals and then click Edit.
2. Select one of the four goal slots available for that profile and then
click Edit.
3. Enter the Goal URL.
If your visitor reaches the goal page, congratulations. You made a suc-
cessful conversion. Examples of goal pages include registration confir-
mation pages, a checkout complete page, or a thank-you page.
4. Enter the Goal name how you want it to appear in your Google
Analytics account.
5. Turn the goal On or Off.
This tells Google Analytics whether you want to track that specific goal.
The next step is to define a funnel. Here’s how:
1. Enter the URL of the first page of your conversion funnel.
The first page of your conversion funnel should be a page that is common
to any visitor moving toward your conversion goal. If you track user flow
263
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy

through your checkout pages, for example, don’t include a product page
as a step in your funnel. You are measuring only shopping cart issues in
that type of funnel.
2. Enter a Name for this step.
3. If the step you just named is a Required step in the conversion
process, select the check box to the right of the step.
If this check box is selected, any visitor that reaches your goal page
without traveling through this particular required funnel page will not be
counted as a conversion.
4. Continue entering goal steps until your funnel has been completely
defined.
Google lets you enter up to ten steps.
Finish by configuring additional settings:
1. If the URLs entered in the funnel definition are case sensitive, select
the check box.
2. Enter a Goal value.
Google Analytics uses the goal value in its ROI calculations. You can set
a goal value for the page, or a dynamic value pulled from your e-com-
merce receipt page.
• If you are setting a goal value for a page: Enter the amount in 
the field.
• If you are entering a dynamic value pulled from your e-commerce
receipt page: Leave this field blank.
You’ll need to get some additional insight from Google from its 
support site.
3. Click the Save Changes button to create this goal and funnel or click
Cancel to exit without saving.
Employing Conversion Tracking Tools
If you don’t want to go through the brain damage of setting up conversion
funnels but you still want to track the conversions of your PPC campaigns,
you can employ conversion tracking tools. Google offers AdWords Conversion
Tracking, which is different from Google Analytics but yields similar end results.
Google is not the only one that has these tools. ROI Tracking, Conversion
Ruler, and Hitbox Professional offer them, too.
264
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

If you’re already using Google AdWords, though, the search giant’s Conversion
Tracking tool is a good bet. Conversion Tracking works by placing a cookie
on a user’s computer when she clicks one of your AdWords ads. The way
Google explains it, if the user reaches one of your conversion pages, the
cookie is connected to your Web page. Then, when a match is made, Google
records a successful conversion for you.
Be wary of this potential caveat to conversion tracking tools: They don’t
always work well with cookies. Pretend that a visitor comes to your site
through a Google search. She likes what she sees, but she has to rush to a
business meeting before she has an opportunity to accept your call to action.
That same visitor types in your URL the next day and purchases a subscrip-
tion to your online magazine. Some applications won’t recognize that visitor
as a Google-referred conversion, so Google gets a raw deal because it really
sent you a converting visitor but doesn’t get the credit for it. Google says that
its cookie doesn’t expire for 30 days, but if the visitor logs back on to your
site from a different computer or doesn’t use cookies, the root of the conver-
sion is a mystery.
Optimizing Your Ad Campaigns
We talk more about how to use analytics data to optimize for these types of
issues in Chapter 16. The point here as it relates to advertising is this: The
keywords that you use in your advertising campaign are targeting a specific
audience. Those keywords and concepts need to be clearly reflected on what-
ever landing pages they are associated with. It’s not just about choosing the
right keywords, then, it’s about making sure your site connects with what the
reader was searching for when he gets there. Copywriting and other content
should be optimized with keyword and keyphrases that you used in your
advertising campaign.
You might wonder how to use your newfound knowledge of the keyword con-
nection to optimize your ad campaigns. Pretend that you operate a site for
your business consulting firm, and you target small businesses that are trying
to take their company to the next level. Instead of sending the visitors to
your home page and hoping that you’ve adequately communicated your
value proposition, why not send them to a landing page that lists all the
strategic services that you’ve provided to other small businesses? Because
you never have a second chance to make a first impression — some clichés
are true, okay? — why not make the most of the money you paid for that
clickthrough by getting right to the bottom line with your visitor with a spe-
cially crafted landing page designed to compel them to convert? We can’t
think of any good reason.
265
Chapter 14: Revisiting Your Online Advertising Strategy

Here’s another example. You sell watches. You run a banner ad campaign that
promises free shipping on orders greater than $100. The watcher customer
decides to take you up on your offer and clicks through to your site. The only
problem is when he gets to the product page, the content does not reflect the
free shipping offer you promised in the banner ad. He might feel like you’ve
pulled the old bait and switch (like the used car dealer’s ad for a low-mileage,
fully loaded Cadillac, that turns into a run-down bare bones lemon when you
show up on at the car lot). If the visitor feels slighted, she might not only
decide to exit your site, but she might not trust your next banner ad promis-
ing a free charm bracelet with the sale of a Rolex watch.
As you can see, you have many different ways to track your online advertis-
ing and marketing campaigns. We don’t want to sound like nags, but our
advice bears repeating:
Whatever method you use, if you are an aggressive search engine mar-
keter, please, please, please use one or more of these methods to revisit
your strategies. You’ll be glad you did.

 Logfiles: To save or not to save?
I
f seeing the word history in the chapter title made you yawn and consider
skipping ahead, don’t you dare! We promise not to bore you or make you
memorize the names of America’s presidents, significant wars, or watershed
political events. We do suggest, however, that you keep a record of your Web
analytics history. You know the adage: History repeats itself. If that’s even the
slightest bit true, you’d better make a note of what happened in your Web
site’s past so you that can foresee the good, the bad, or even the ugly that
potentially lies ahead.
You’ve probably heard the word benchmark used in connection with any
number of industries, from investing to education to NASCAR racing. Simply
put, a benchmark is merely a point of reference from which measurements can
be made. Because Web analytics is all about measurements, benchmarking —
in this context — is critical to applying the data properly. Just as racecar dri-
vers time their speed around the track in what’s often called a benchmark race
that gauges their performance on a specific track with a specific vehicle and
a specific crew, you can use Web analytics to benchmark your key performance
indicators (KPI) on your site or sites. KPIs illustrate how well your site is per-
forming against goals; read all about them in Chapter 11.
Regardless of whether you enjoyed history in high school, you’ll have to admit
that it does offer valuable insights. From the annals of history, we all learn
about the successes and failures of great leaders and great nations. Much the
same, if you chronicle your Web analytics history, you have a strong frame of
reference to compare your Web site’s performance today with its performance
last month, last year, or even five years ago. You can clearly see the effects
that seasonal shifts, economic conditions, market changes, product trends,

Web site redesigns, marketing initiatives, and other activities had on your
site. You can see what did and what didn’t work and then forecast how exter-
nal factors that are beyond your control could affect your site so that you can
plan accordingly.
Don’t pooh-pooh this chapter. Instead, embrace it. You are about to see first-
hand the importance of
 Benchmarking your data
 Which numbers you absolutely must save
 How to save them
 How to use this historical data to see what would otherwise remain
invisible
If you study your history, you’ll be prepared to pass the tests that come your
way as customers, partners, products, services, content, and strategies change.
Name, Rank, and Serial Number
Some people love numbers, and some people don’t. Some people are pack
rats, and others throw away anything they haven’t used for six months. For
you data-loving packrats, chronicling your Web analytics history is a welcomed
task. Regardless, here’s our mandate: Save as much of your analytics data as
you can, for as long as you can. Unlike tax paperwork from 20 years ago, left-
over paint, and dried-up caulking (and all the other stuff that people nag you to
get rid of), your Web analytics history will probably come in handy — and it
won’t clutter up the garage. In just a bit, we show you how to save it all.
For those of you who begin feeling nauseous at the thought of numbers (much
less taking the time to save them), we’ll try to make this as painless as your
last cavity-free trip to the dentist. All you have to do is save the equivalent of
a soldier’s name, rank, and serial number. That’s it. In the Web analytics
world, that includes your
 Standard traffic information
• Unique visitors: The actual number of individual users who came to
the Web site
• Pageviews: A record of each time a visitor views a Web page on
your site
 Top 25 search terms
 Top 25 referring sites
268
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

 Conversion rate: The percentage of visitors who took the desired call 
to action
 Any other KPIs that you discovered are vital to keeping your Web site
humming like a shiny new Lamborghini (or Porsche, if you prefer)
After you decide to save your data (even if it is a reluctant determination),
you need to know how to save it. Like many things online, the answer is not
cut and dry. Your saving options depend on two factors:
 The type of analytics software you use
 How long you plan to continue using that service
The three distinct Web analytic tool options you can choose from — server-
side, client-side, and hosted solutions — play a role in determining how long
your data is stored.
Don’t take it for granted that your Web analytics application will automati-
cally save your history by default, or you could lose valuable data. For exam-
ple, some tools might save your data for only a limited period of time. Just
like you check the expiration date on a carton of milk, be sure to find out
where your Web analytics software or vendor stands on saving your history,
or you could be in for a sour experience.
Saving data on the server side
Server-side analytics applications tend to put a cap on storing your historical
data automatically, maybe storing it for only three or six months. Other
server-side analytics programs might limit the amount of data that you can
save based on how much storage or hard drive space you purchased with
your hosting package. The latter issue is easier to clear up:
 Pony up: Spend more money to get more storage.
 Watch your pennies: Gauge how much you much data you can save
before you go over quota and run into costly overage charges or experi-
ence server downtime.
269
Chapter 15: Chronicling Your Web Analytics History
The three types of Web analytic tools
Server-side analytics tools are installed on the
Web site’s server. Client-side tools are installed
on your computer. A service provider on its
server hosts hosted solutions. Be sure to read
Chapter 4 for the scoop on the pros and cons of
each of these delivery models.

If it’s just a matter of the provider putting an expiration date on your data,
talk to your Web host to determine how you can download your raw access
logs and save them to a permanent location.
Saving data with client-side solutions
If you use a client-side solution (a log-parsing application that is installed on
your personal computer), your only limitation in terms of space is the size of
your hard drive. With the prices of storage drives as low as they’ve ever
been, upgrading your capacity or buying a new storage device when your
data gets really large is a no-brainer.
However, think about this when you’re saving data on your computer: What
happens if your computer dies or is lost or stolen? If you choose to save
important data to your local computer, you should have a backup plan in
place so that when (because it’s not really a question of if ) something bad
happens, you can still access your data.
Saving data with hosted applications
If you use a hosted analytics application, the service provider will most likely
save your historical information for as long as your account is in good standing.
You can enjoy easy access to your historical data anytime you need it: that is,
until you change providers. Like changing Web hosts, switching hosted Web ana-
lytics providers can cause major headaches. Beyond the fact that statistics can
vary from application to application, you typically lose all your historical data.
There’s no need to stock up on aspirin as long as you get in the habit of record-
ing your KPIs in a spreadsheet. We talk more about that in the next section.
Saved by the spreadsheet
Even if your historical Web analytics data is available on a server, your desk-
top, or a host indefinitely, it never hurts to compile an additional backup. 
You can do this using a simple spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel, as
shown in Figure 15-1. Be sure to check out Wiley’s Microsoft Excel 2007 For
Dummies, by Greg Harvey, if you need help with this program.
Not only does saving this data to a spreadsheet serve as a backup for your
vital metrics and KPIs, but it also offers another way for you to review and
compare your historical data. You don’t need to record each and every metric,
but you should make it a habit to review your analytics info and record the
important metrics to an Excel file at least every few months. This can be a
life-saver — or at least a marketing-saver — should your normal data storage
plan fail for any reason.

Benchmarking Your Conversion Rate
Because operating a Web site is all about conversions, if you make no other
effort to chronicle your Web analytics history, benchmark your average con-
version rate at the very least. Whether you sell pet supplies, offer an online
self-service support kiosk, or generate leads or serve up information, your
conversion rate is the bottom line, and Web analytics doesn’t beat around the
bush. It tells you the way it is.
To calculate your conversion rate
1. Determine the number of visitors to your site.
Look at the number of unique visitors in your Web analytics program.
2. Determine the number of conversions.
Not all Web analytics programs calculate conversions this for you. If you
use Google Analytics, you can count the number of “Thank you” pages,
or whatever page displays after the visitor takes the desired call to
action (see Figure 15-2).
3. Divide the number of visitors by the number of conversions.
This is good, old-fashioned arithmetic. Your answer will offer you the
conversion rate for your Web site.
Figure 15-1:

Excel

271
Chapter 15: Chronicling Your Web Analytics History

4. Make a record.
Now make a record of your conversion rate and note the date. That is
your benchmark.
5. Monitor your conversion rate.
Your goal now is to monitor your conversion rate on a monthly basis 
(or more often if you choose) and see how well your site is performing
against that benchmark. If you run an e-commerce site, you could also
choose to benchmark against special promotions or holiday shopping
seasons. If you are an accountant, you could benchmark against tax
season or year over year. Tailor your benchmark against your business
goals.
A declining conversion rate won’t help you diagnose an ailing Web site, but it
at least offers a warning sign that you are headed toward the edge of a cliff.
Much the same, a rising conversion rate won’t tell you what you’ve done
right, but it at least gives you peace of mind that your overall efforts are
paying off. Benchmarking your conversion rate, then, helps you keep a pulse
on your site’s overall ability, over time, to maintain peak performance.

272
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Oh, what difference does it make?
Do you know what your conversion rate is today? Do you know what it was a
year ago? Two years ago? Most people don’t. In fact, a survey conducted by
the e-tailing group, a shopper-centric e-commerce consultancy, found that 58
percent of retailers say the conversion rate is an important metric in under-
standing how well a Web site performs. (In our minds, that’s a low number: It
should be 100 percent.) If that’s not bad enough, 19 percent didn’t even know
their conversion rate.
Failing to benchmark your conversion rate can spell disaster with a capital D.
In this fast-paced world, you might not be too concerned over even notice a
conversion rate that slips half a percentage point month after month. However,
if you keep tabs on your historical data, you’ll avoid that slippery slope. If
you ignore your historical data, you could wind up with a 2.5-percent decline
in your conversion rate over a four-year period. That’s the equivalent to a
wake up call delivered by the worst ever performer on “American Idol.” It’s a
rate change that not many businesses can afford to miss.
Benchmarking against the masses
Sometimes folks in the Web analytics world consider benchmarking a com-
parison between your site and competitive sites. That’s one way to look at it,
and it’s a valid way despite the variations in how analytics tools measure
metrics and how often they fluctuate. However, most Web sites don’t gener-
ate enough traffic to rank next to the mass retailers and content providers
that major indexes like what comScore and Neilsen//NetRatings measure.
If you are really interested in how your Web site performs in the broad cate-
gory that you serve, check out the Fireclick Index instead of beating your
head against a brick wall (perhaps Wal-Mart or Amazon.com).
Fireclick (www.index.fireclick.com) is a Web analytics provider that
taps its database to offer a publicly available Web analytics benchmark index
(see Figure 15-3) across a variety of segments, such as fashion and apparel,
electronics, catalog, specialty, outdoor and sports, and software.
WebSideStory (www.websidestory.com) offers a benchmarking service called
StatMarket that offers critical comparison metrics — from checkout start rates
to new and repeat visitor conversion rates — against five e-commerce cate-
gories, including apparel, toys, computers, sports, and leisure, as well as all
categories together. StatMarket is only available by subscription and pricing
starts at $750 for two-weeks’ access and $1,500 for an annual subscription.
273
Chapter 15: Chronicling Your Web Analytics History

Some big analytics firms, such as Omniture (www.ominiture.com), don’t
believe in industry benchmarks at all because of the fluctuations we mention.
The bottom line should always be making your site perform to its highest
standards. Focusing too much on what your competitors are doing could ulti-
mately distract you from your own agenda.
Benchmarking Your KPIs
As we list earlier in this chapter, your baseline comprises unique visitors,
pageviews, Top 25 search terms, Top 25 referring sites, and conversion rate.
Depending on what type of site you operate, you want to benchmark critical
KPIs. E-commerce sites, for example, want to benchmark the shopping cart
abandonment rate (the number of visitors who put items in the shopping cart
but did not complete the sale). Content producers might want to benchmark
metrics such as time spent on site. Customer service operations would want
to benchmark support ticket abandonment rates (the number of visitors who
started the customer support process but did not complete it). A lead gener-
ator might want to benchmark search-marketing KPIs. Are you catching on
yet? For an exhaustive list of KPIs and how to take action on them, read
Chapter 11.

Benchmarking Times and Seasons
If you’re wondering how often you should look back at your Web analytics
history and compare your benchmarks against your site’s current perfor-
mance, that’s a valid question. Your answer depends (don’t you hate when
people say that?) on how much traffic you have, for one thing. If you get 500
hits per month, you aren’t going to see dramatic changes in your KPIs, so
reviewing your history on a monthly basis is probably sufficient. If you get
one million hits per day, your KPIs could be skewed widely on a day-to-day
basis, and you should have someone in your organization who monitors the
metrics daily, if not more often. If you are aggressively spending on pay per
click (PPC) campaigns (also called paid search; this method retrieves listings
based on who paid the most money for keywords to appear at the top of the
heap) across various engines, you need to monitor your analytics just as
aggressively.
Here’s the bottom line: Even if you can start only on a quarterly schedule,
starting to track and record your important metrics as soon as possible is
vital. Looking at the data every once in a while isn’t good enough if you’re
serious about using analytics to improve your e-business. Get on a schedule
that works for you and stick to it.
Month-to-month monitoring
Regardless of how aggressive your Web strategy is, you want to keep a pulse
on certain benchmarks every month. Unique users, pageviews, and top
search engines and keywords can see dramatic fluctuations month-over-
month, even if you aren’t doing anything to your Web site. This is because
Google, Yahoo!, MSN, and the other search engines constantly tweak algo-
rithms which can cause your listings to fall and rise unexpectedly. If you fail
to take notice of those changes, your business could suffer. On the other
hand, if your traffic numbers are increasing but your sales are not increasing
proportionately, reviewing your data could point you in the direction of
increased profits. Who would willingly pass on that opportunity?
Scoping history season-to-season
To everything, there is a season. If your business is seasonal, you want to be
sure to review your Web analytics history accordingly. We mention accoun-
tants earlier. Although accountants could use a Web site to generate leads all
year long, every year holds the tax season during which that accountant might
generate most of his leads for the entire year. Likewise, if you run an e-com-
merce shop that sells sporting goods, you are likely to see sales spikes in bas-
ketball gear during basketball season and camping gear during the warmer
months.
275
Chapter 15: Chronicling Your Web Analytics History

Much like how traditional brick-and-mortar operations review their seasonal
data to make predictions for labor, advertising, merchandising, and other
business functions, you can use the historical data in your Web analytics soft-
ware to gauge the same factors. The good news is Web analytics lets you take
it a step or two further. Not only can you gauge the need to saturate the market
with advertising, but you can review search term reports from that period to
discover what keywords drove the most traffic to your site and use those
while weeding out the duds. You can see which site referrers drove the most
conversions your way and make sure that you’re still connected. To read
more about how to measure traffic generation to your site, read Chapter 8.
Another year goes by . . .
Seasons come and go every year, but comparing seasonal metrics and com-
paring yearly metrics are two different things. Comparing your Web analytics
history year over year gives you the big picture view of the growth of your
operation. Ideally, you should be growing each and every year. As you review
your year over year history, have your goals in front of you. Did you meet
your sales goals? If so, did you spend more on PPC campaigns to get those
sales? If so, what was the actual return on investment? You need to determine
what those annual analytics comparisons really mean to your business.
The numbers can be deceiving if you don’t put them into context. We’ve
heard some Internet marketers claim that they are making $1 million on their
sites, and consequently offer to sell their expert consulting services for a
pretty penny. But did they neglect to tell you that they spent $950,000 on PPC
campaigns to generate that $1 million in revenue?
Revenues and profits are two different metrics. Just like you shouldn’t bank
on hits (also called an impression; a hit created when your Web server deliv-
ers a file to a visitor’s browser), you shouldn’t bank on sheer numbers.
Always drill down into your Web analytics to get the big picture. Set new
goals each year and leverage your tools to truly measure your progress
toward those goals.
Too, don’t be fooled by an eye-pleasing chart (see Figure 15-4). Some unscrupu-
lous consultants could take numbers out of context in order to impress you.
If you are working with a search engine marketing (SEM) consultant (one who
uses methods that seeks to increases the ranking and visibility of a Web site
in search engine results pages) or a search engine optimization (SEO) consul-
tant (one who uses methods of improving the rankings for relevant keywords
in search results by making changes to the content or navigational structure
of a Web site) who offers you graph that makes everything look dandy with
unique visitors and pageviews going up, up and up, just remember to ask
how much it cost you to get those increased visitors. And are these numbers
also bringing increased conversions? Although improving individual metrics
is easy, your KPIs are what really tell the story.
276
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Identifying Hidden Trends
If you’ve read this chapter to this point, you are likely thoroughly convinced
of the importance of chronicling your Web analytics history. Assuming that
you are indeed sold, we have a bonus for you. Analyzing your historical Web
traffic data can help you identify visitor trends and patterns that would be
invisible if not seen from the 10,000-foot view offered by your historical data.
These could be positive trends or negative trends.
For example, you might not notice that your traffic for a particular keyword is
increasing by 2 percent month after month. Still, missing a 24-percent increase
in traffic for that keyword after 12 months is hard. Seeing the effect of this new
keyword could indicate a growing market for the associated product or serv-
ice. Or it could mean that some of your online competition is losing its step.
Either way, it poses an opportunity that you might have missed otherwise.
On the other hand, say that your shopping cart abandonment rate is increas-
ing by .05 percent per month. One-half of 1 percent would hardly make one
flinch. Left unchecked, though, that .05 percent becomes almost 2 percent in
the course of three years. Keeping tabs of your historical data lets you iden-
tify these trends so you can head off the negative effects before it’s too late.

Chapter 15: Chronicling Your Web Analytics History

Many Tools, Many Benchmarks
Now we are going to throw you for a loop, but don’t worry — we’ll help you get
your balance back in just a minute. Earlier in the chapter, we talk about three
different types of tools (client-side, server-side, and hosted solutions). We also
share with you that you could use dozens — even scores — of Web analytics
tools. We warn you of the potential pitfalls of switching tools and losing your
historical data. Now we answer your question: What if I use more than one tool?
If you use more than one tool to keep tabs on different slices of data, you
haven’t painted yourself into a corner. For example, you might use server-side
analytics to keep a quick pulse on your critical KPIs but also use a hosted
solution to dig deeper into the data. That’s a reasonable tack because there
are pros and cons to each different type of analytics tool. (To discover more
about the pros and cons of the different tool types, read Chapter 4.)
Much the same, you might decide that client-side tools are right for you but
use more than one vendor because you like the combination of features that
using both tools offers. For example, you might use AWStats to monitor your
day-to-day fluctuations in traffic but also use a client-side version of ClickTracks
Analyzer to determine which user groups are generating the most revenue.
Because AWStats is a free, server-based tool, it offers a quick and easy way 
to pull up your stats from any computer with an Internet connection. And
although your client-side ClickTracks Analyzer application might take a little
longer to import and process logfiles, it offers visitor segmentation tools that
are unavailable in AWStats.
Nothing is wrong with using data from multiple vendors, but let the analyzer
beware. You might yield slightly different results — or even significantly dif-
ferent results — from vendor to vendor. Each vendor defines and calculates
metrics slightly differently: While one tool says that you had 10,000 unique
users last month, another tool might figure that number at 8,000.
Here’s how you reconcile using more than one tool: Even if you use multiple
tools, be sure that when you benchmark and record your essential metrics
and KPIs, you always grab your numbers from the same tool. Switching back
and forth can make historical trend watching irrelevant.
Access Log Files: To Save or Not to Save?
Access Log files, also called raw log files or just logfiles, are generally text-based
files that record each and every Web user’s interaction with the Web site. In
simple terms, a typical logfile records when a user visited, what files they
accessed, and a unique identifier such as host address or IP address (see
278
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Figure 15-5). More robust logfiles store additional data that can include where
the user came from (or her referring site), what operating system and
browser she was using, the resolution of her monitor, and more.
Analytics applications then use the data in logfiles to create reports and met-
rics that you see displayed in your analytics application’s charts or data tables.
Logfiles are usually saved on the server that hosts your Web site; depending
on your hosting company, they might or might not be available for download.
The case for dumping logfiles
Sometimes being a pack rat can leave you without much room to grow. Saving
logfiles isn’t always a good idea, nor is it always necessary. The downside is
that logfiles can get very large. That means they can take up lots of storage
space and become hard to manage.
And if you decide to change vendors and you have all these raw logfiles of
data, you might not want to transfer them all over. It’s not always a simple
process. First, you have to locate the files. Then you have to prepare them for
importing, which can involve using utilities to uncompress or convert the
files to other formats. Finally, you go through the process of importing the
files, if your vendor allows it. That can take a lot of time and a lot of comput-
ing resources.

Chapter 15: Chronicling Your Web Analytics History

Your decision boils down to the importance of your history. If you weren’t
getting much traffic before the last 6 or 12 months, saving historical data
before that point in time can be a waste of time. However, if you have years’
worth of logfiles that you feel are critical to keeping tabs on your site’s per-
formance, by all means — save, back up, and save again!
The case for saving access logs
Sometimes, being a pack rat can pay off. (Ask anyone who saved their bell
bottoms until they came back in style.) The default setting for most hosting
companies is to delete logfiles after a certain amount of time. However, you
should decide whether you want to save those files. The benefits of saving
your logfiles is that they are the raw data files that analytics applications
need to generate your metrics. So, if you decide to change analytics applica-
tions or upgrade to one of those high-end enterprise solutions in the future,
you can run those logfiles through your new application and possibly pull
gems out of the data that you didn’t know to look for previously.
Deciding whether to save your logfiles depends on how important it is to you
to be able to parse this raw data in the future. As the analytics world changes
and evolves, it seems that advances in this area will continue to lead to inno-
vation in the way that applications parse and present that data so keeping it
around for a while might make the most sense.
A simple way to save your files is to download and save the access logs to
your computer. If you don’t have the space on your computer, or would feel
more comfortable with a more redundant backup, look into an online storage
solution — some of which start at just $9.99 a month.

Fine-Tuning Your Web Site
In This Chapter
 Optimizing your home page and landing pages
 Redesigning your Web site based on solid analytics data
 Minimizing shopping cart abandonment
 Measuring the impact of site changes
W
hen all is said and done, you need Web analytics data to accomplish
one overarching goal: Improve your business. If you’ve read all the
earlier chapters in this book, you know that analytics can expose powerful
information about your customers and their online behavior, which pages on
your site are most popular, what content your visitors look for, where your
online sales process breaks down, and more.
Web analytics can help you find new customers and partners, revisit your
online advertising campaigns, and identify your most important pages,
among other things. However, Web analytics can also help you take a view of
your site from 10,000 feet up so that you can see potential problems with the
function, design, and content of your Web site that you might otherwise not
notice in the day-to-day grind of doing business online.
Indeed, one of the most powerful ways that you can use Web analytics data is
to fine-tune your Web site. Much like search engine optimization (SEO; a method
of improving the rankings for relevant keywords in search results by making
changes to the content or navigational structure of a Web site) or ad cam-
paign optimization, the idea behind Web site optimization is (as dear Merriam-
Webster puts it) to “make as perfect, effective or functional as possible.”
If you haven’t already read Chapter 15 on chronicling your Web analytics his-
tory, we highly recommend you do that now. Trying to optimize a site without
understanding your starting point is like going on a rapid weight-loss reduction
program without weighing yourself at the onset. (That’s dumb underlined
three times.) In other words, you can’t really measure how far you’ve come
because you don’t know where you started.
In this chapter, we make concepts such as redesigning your Web site based on
solid analytics data, optimizing your home page and landing pages, minimizing

shopping cart abandonment, and measuring the effect of site changes come
to life with practical examples that will help you relate to your dear Web
designer in a whole new way.
Understanding Optimization Strategies
If you’ve traveled in Web circles for any length of time, you’ve probably heard
the word optimization. Optimization simply means to make as perfect, effec-
tive, or functional as possible. That definition in and of itself clues you that
various optimization strategies exist for Web sites. Before we share strategies
for using Web analytics data to make your site the best possible online business
ambassador it can be, then, take just a minute to understand some common
optimization strategies and how they relate to the challenge at hand.
Search engine optimization
We mention SEO throughout this book, defining it as a way to beef up your
rankings for relevant keywords in search engines by making changes to the
content or navigation. If you want to know more about SEO, pick up Search
Engine Optimization For Dummies, 2nd Edition (Wiley Publishing, Inc.; Peter
Kent) for everything you need to know about this popular optimization strat-
egy. For our Web analytics purposes, if you engage in SEO projects, you want
to keep track of a few metrics to measure your success against your goals. If
your SEO strategy is working, you should be getting more traffic to your site.
 Percent of User Growth this Period: The total number of users this
reporting period, divided by the total number of users in last reporting
period. (Periods are usually measured in months or years.)
 Percent of Traffic Growth this Period: The total number of visits this
period, divided by the total number of visits in last period. (Periods are
usually measured in months or years.)
 Percent of Traffic from Search Engines: The number of visits referred
from search engines divided by the total number of visits.
 Percent New Visitors: The number of new users divided by the total
number of users. Getting return visits is great, but making sure that your
site is being exposed to new visitors on a regular basis is also important.
After you have these stats in hand, you have two options:
 Conclude that your SEO efforts have paid off and move on to the next
conquest in life.
 Decide that you have more work to do and get to it.
282
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Web analytics doesn’t measure some aspects of SEO, at least not directly. If
you are gung ho about SEO, you also need to watch your Google PageRank.
Your page rank is where your Web site falls on Google’s scale of 1–10, with 10
being the highest. You also want to check your link popularity, which mea-
sures of the total number of Web sites that link to your site. Link popularity
can dramatically increase traffic to your site and can also generate additional
search engine traffic.
Calling on conversion design
Whether you are building a Web site from scratch, redesigning your site, or
just improving certain pages, conversion design is an optimization strategy
you’ll want to employ. Conversion design is a design philosophy that com-
bines business goals with aesthetics. It’s bottom-line design with a single goal
in mind: to turn online traffic into online sales (or subscriptions, registra-
tions, leads, or whatever your desired call to action is). Conversion design
describes the business of design and encompasses critical Web design ele-
ments that spark increased conversions, such as color theory and usability.
For our Web analytics purposes, if you execute conversion design concepts,
you want to use A/B and multivariate testing to compare how one landing
page performs against another. These tools help you take the guesswork out
of site changes. You could literally test hundreds of different variations in the
placement of Buy Now buttons, product images, copyrighting, and the like to
figure out which site variations do the best job persuading visitors to take
action.
283
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site
Reviewing the Robot Report
A Robot Report may sound like something the
Jetson’s maid (Rosie) would offer at the end of
a long day of dusting high-tech gadgetry. In the
world of Web analytics, though, this report tells
you which bots visited your site, the date of the
last visit, how many times they visited, and how
much bandwidth they consumed. Also known
as Web crawlers, bots, or spiders, a robot is an
automated script or program that browses the
Web. Search engines use robots to gather up-
to-date data as they index the Web. This report
is helpful for several reasons. For example, if
you determine that the Googlebot darkens your
virtual doors once per week, you can push
through any new changes to your site between
visits to bolster your page rank (determined by
how many links point to a Web site together
with the quality of the sites providing the links).
Also, if you notice that the Yahoo! bot visits your
site every month, but you don’t get any traffic
from Yahoo!, you might want to research search
engine optimization techniques specifically for
that search engine.

 A/B testing: Also called split testing, A/B testing allows you to compare
different versions of your site and measure the effect that they make on
conversions.
 Multivariate testing: Multivariate testing goes a step further to let you
test multiple versions of the same Web site.
With these niche software tools, cousins of traditional Web analytics, you
could literally test hundreds of different variations in the placement of Buy
Now buttons, product images, and the like to figure out which site variations
do the best job persuading visitors to take action. Check out Chapter 6 to
read more about these tools.
Capturing customers with 
conversion content
It’s been said that content is king, but in a maturing Web world, not just any
content will do. Search engines are clogged with blog entries and copywriting
that is search engine-optimized beyond coherence. Different from keyword
density (the ratio of the number of occurrences an individual keyword to the
total number of words on a page), the concept of conversion content describes
the actual content of copywriting, video scripts, PowerPoint presentations,
and various forms of rich media that encourage a visitor to take the desired
call to action. Conversion content, then, is not merely about drawing traffic
to your Web site. Nor it is not merely about telling the visitor what to do when
he gets there with a clear call to action. Rather, conversion content includes
the meat of multimedia elements that accurately depict clear user benefits,
communicating answers to unasked questions that could lead to consumer
objections — and, in doing so, compelling visitors to respond to your offer.
For our Web analytics purposes, again rely on A/B and multivariate testing to
optimize around conversion content. For example, an attorney might find
that a version of his site that offers an introductory video that talks about 
the last big case he won generates more leads than the version that merely
advertises his credentials, or vice versa. Or, an online catalog might discover
that copywriting written in a conversational tone draws more conversions
than copywriting written in a formal tone. However, this tack might not be
true for a dermatologist’s Web site, where potential patients might feel better
about a doctor’s big vocabulary. Indeed, how your visitors respond to your
content can tell you much about who your visitors are as well as how to fur-
ther optimize your site to meet their needs.

Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Optimizing Your Home Page
Before you attempt to optimize your home page, you need to understand its
purpose and importance. Your home page can often be the first impression
that the world gets of your company. It’s the doorway to the rest of what you
have to offer; its design and content can cause a visitor to enter or slam the
door of opportunity in your face. The home page has to balance visual appeal
with usefulness. Of course, you can accomplish that goal in any number of
ways, but you certainly want to include standard elements about who you
are, your unique selling proposition, and a clear navigational framework to
help visitors explore the site efficiently. Then, use Web analytics to help you
measure the most effective combination of elements so that you can increase
revenue from your home page.
Before you start any optimization project, be sure to record your key metrics’
key performance indicators (KPIs). KPIs illustrate how well the site performs
against goals. You can read much more about KPIs in Chapter 11. Users enter
your site from many different pages. When you track users who enter your
site from the homepage, here are some important metrics and KPIs that you’ll
want to measure:
 Average Time on Site: The average amount of time a visitor stays on
your site (see Figure 16-1). Users who come through your home page
should be immediately understand what you offer and should feel a
sense of trust for your site that will encourage them to hang around and
see what all you’d like to show them. If this number is under 30 seconds,
you didn’t get their attention. You need to make some changes to your
home page.
 Average Number of Pageviews: The average number of pages a user
visits on your site (see Figure 16-2). This metric is similar to average
time on site except instead of measuring seconds and minutes, it 
Figure 16-1:
Average
Time On Site
report.
285
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site

measures how many pages your users visit before ultimately making a
purchase or leaving. If this number is low (less than two or three pages),
you might need to address problems with your navigation.
 Bounce Rate: A metric that shows the percentage of entrances on any
individual page that resulted in the visitor’s immediate exit from the site
(see Figure 16-3). Visitors can decide in a flash whether you have what
they need just by how your site looks. They could be wrong, but if you
have a high bounce rate, perhaps the first impression scared them away.
If that’s the case, you need to make some changes to your home page.

What Sends Visitors Running?
Before you can optimize your home page, you need to understand some of
the issues that can send visitors running to your competitor’s front door. It
could be any number of issues. As you set out to optimize your site, make
changes in these areas if you feel that they apply to your site:
 Unclear selling proposition: If your home page does not quickly tell the
visitor what your site sells, why she should buy from you, and how she
can accomplish that goal, she could decide to move on to the next vir-
tual outpost. For example, if your site’s main focus is to sell shoes but
your home page is cluttered with everything else that could fit into a
closet, a visitor could easily get confused. Try repositioning the most
important elements at the top of the page for the world to see; then mea-
sure the results with your analytics program.
 No images: If your e-commerce site’s home page doesn’t display images
of your company’s best-selling products, you are wasting an opportunity
to cash in on the visit. What’s more, if visitors came looking for that
best-selling product and didn’t see it within a few seconds, they might
not clickthrough to the product pages where you proudly display your
profitable goods. Try adding attractive photos of your prime time prod-
ucts and measure the results.
 No contact info: Even on the home page, it should be evident how to
contact your service firm, register for your newsletter, or add items to
the shopping cart. If your visitors can’t find out how to contact you, they
can easily leave as fast as they came. Try adding prominently displaying
phone numbers and/or registration and contact forms on your home
page; then measure the results.
 Too much navigation: If you present too many navigation options, it’s
difficult for the eye to pick any one thing out, much less what’s really
important. Visitors might miss what they came for and leave without
digging. Try narrowing down your categories based on groups of com-
plementary products. You might have to rename the buttons. That’s
okay! Try it and then measure the results.
 Unclear navigation: When your navigation options are unclear, the visi-
tor might be forced to guess which category the products and services
his heart desires are hidden behind. Visitors can get frustrated and leave
if they guess wrong. Try to get more specific about your navigational
scheme; then measure the results of your efforts.
 Uncommunicated trust: If the visitor can’t trust you, he won’t walk
through your door. Your home page should exude authority, trust, and
credibility. If your site is outdated, is unprofessional looking, or offers
copywriting that, well, sounds like your younger brother wrote it, you
probably aren’t exuding these qualities. It might be time to remake your
home page and rewrite your content. Try it and measure the results.
287
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site

The preceding list comprises just a few of the obvious issues that can cause
visitors to turn tail and run. There are many others, including poor use of
photos, wide text columns that are difficult to read, cryptic icons. . . . The list
goes on. Your job is to assess the potential problems, make some changes,
test, make some more changes, and test again. This, our friends, is the
process of optimization.
Optimizing Your Landing Pages
A landing page is the specific Web page on which a visitor first arrives in
response to advertising or paid search initiatives (see Figure 16-4). If you are
driving traffic to specific pages, such as product pages, promotional pages,
registration pages, or some other page you want them to land on, you want to
optimize that page for optimum results: conversions. If you have plenty of
visitors hitting your landing page but they aren’t converting, something is
obviously wrong somewhere. Don’t spend another penny on SEM or another
hour on SEO until you optimize your landing page.

Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 
An informational example
Sostre & Associates worked with an informa-
tion portal for new fathers. The site featured
articles, pregnancy tools, a shopping directory,
and various other valuable resources. The
home page was jam-packed with more naviga-
tional options than you could shake a stick at.
(Where does that statement come from
anyway?) Although the number of unique visi-
tors was healthy, the conversion rate was ill.
The Web site owner, of course, was trying to
increase his conversions by offering everything
possible on the home page. Instead, the result
was a cluttered, confusing, jumbled mess.
Using the conversion design concept (read
about this earlier in this chapter), Sostre &
Associates redesigned the home page, group-
ing the content into clearly defined categories
so that visitors could easily move through the
page. The designers used more white space
between informational elements, cut the
number of navigational buttons and moved them
to another position on the site, used fewer
colors, and added a registration function on the
home page. When the owner measured his ana-
lytics reports again, he discovered a major
boost in his KPIs, including 20-percent higher
affiliate commissions and 40-percent greater
advertising revenues.
Even if your home page isn’t a jumbled mess,
you can still toy with smaller elements of the
design and see substantial improvements. It
could just be that you need to rework your copy
because it’s not compelling the visitor to enter.
Or your navigation might not appear user-
friendly. It can surely be the little foxes that spoil
the vine. Be sure to measure your metrics and
KPIs to judge the impact of your changes.

Measuring landing page KPIs
Although you have only one home page, you might have many landing pages.
You could run customer-only ads on a hidden URL that’s not accessible to
mainstream visitors and another similar promotion that is publicly available
to anybody and everybody. You want to measure the KPIs of each individual
landing page that you’re planning to optimize rather than measuring overall
site metrics as a benchmark of success. Before you begin, make a record of
these landing page metrics and KPIs so you can measure your results:
 Average Time on Site: If your average time on site is high but conversions
are low, it could be that you don’t have a clear call to action. Visitors
need to be told what to do in a way that compels them to do it. You
might need to add a Buy Now button, do a better job of highlighting your
super-low prices, or more prominently display your price. Perhaps you
have too much content altogether.
 Bounce Rate: If your bounce rate is low and your conversion rates are
also low, maybe your visitors are either confused or are engaging in a
long game of eenie, meenie, minie, moe. You need to compel them to
Figure 16-4:
An example
of a landing
page.
289
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site

convert with design and content. Following the conversion content con-
cept, you might need to add in some product images, write stronger
headlines, descriptions, body copy, or bullets.
 Conversion Rate: If your conversion rate is low, perhaps you don’t have
the right products. Too, consider some of the aforementioned reasons.
You could be losing thousands of dollars over a few simple changes.
Keep testing until you figure out what works.
If visitors don’t love the landing page
Before you can optimize your landing page, you need to understand some of
the issues that can prevent your visitors from falling in love with your presen-
tation. Any number of issues could be the reason. As you set out to optimize
your site, you should make changes in these areas if you feel they apply to
your site:
 Poor design: Poor design is one of the leading reasons why visitors
don’t love your landing page. Design includes text and link color (some
colors are difficult to read onscreen), image choices and positioning, the
layout of the page, navigation, and even the font and the size of the font.
If you suspect that any or all of these elements hinder your conversions,
begin making changes and then measure the results.
 Unclear price: If the price of what you sell isn’t positioned clearly and
accurately, visitors might not like — much less love — your landing
page. Make sure that the price is easy to find and is consistent with any
promotions you’ve launched online.
 Content considerations: A myriad of content considerations can hurt
your landing pages chances of conversion. If your landing page copy
rambles on and on like your second cousin whose phone calls you
avoid, you could have a problem. If you fail to mention the benefits of
what you’re selling (benefits are different from product and service fea-
tures, mind you) or fail to mention them quickly enough, your landing
page conversions could suffer. If any of your content isn’t up to profes-
sional par or isn’t consistent with your promotions; or if your captions,
headlines, and blurbs aren’t attention-getting, you might need to make
some changes. Then, measure the effect.
 Cluttered page: If your landing page is as cluttered as your kid’s bed-
room, how do you expect visitors to find what they’re looking for?
Organize your content into chunks that are easy for the eye to scan and
then measure the results.
 No call to action: If you don’t tell the visitor what to do, she might not
do it. You need to make a clear call to action. Try adding Buy Now but-
tons and adding copy that states to respond to this limited-time offer or
some other promotional strategy. Then measure the results.
290
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Optimizing Product Pages
Your product (or service) pages are where your bread is buttered. These
pages are where you spotlight what you have to offer the world. If the bright
light turns up ugly flaws or noncompelling content, you could lose the sale.
Not all product pages are landing pages. Landing pages are pages you design
for search engine visitors or visitors responding to some other promotion to
land on so they can take advantage of what you are marketing. You will have
a product page for each product (or service) you offer but perhaps only a few
landing pages.
Measuring product page KPIs
Unless you operate an information site or an online customer support center,
most of your site is made up of product (or service) pages. Keep these met-
rics and KPIs in mind at the onset, and then measure against them:
 Percent Low/Medium/High Time Spent Visits: The percentage of visi-
tors who stayed on your Web site for under 30 seconds (low), between
30 seconds and 2 minutes (medium), or longer than 2 minutes (high).
Knowing how long a visitor was at your site can be an important piece of
the puzzle that when solved, shows you how effective your site really is.
If your product pages are doing their job, your visitors should be willing
to stay and shop or read.
 Shopping Cart Start Rate: The number of users who started a shopping
cart (by adding one of your products to their shopping cart) divided by
291
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site
A healthy example
Here’s a good e-commerce example for you.
Sostre & Associates worked with a Web site
owner who provides salary information, medical
testing and advice, and a medical industry job
search to med students. The site didn’t have a
tagline or any images to convey what it was
about, so it just looked like a list of links. The site
didn’t encourage visitors to come again, either,
or register for updates. After adding a simple
photo of medical students at the top of the site,
a logo update with a clear tagline, a few text
links to help visitors find what they are looking
for more quickly, some calls to action to book-
mark the site and register for updates, the site
took on a whole new look — and a lot more
conversions.
The Web design team demonstrated that just a
few changes could lead to dramatic results. The
same probably holds true for some of your land-
ing pages. The key is to dive in, make the
changes, and then test, change, test change,
and so on.

the total number of visitors who viewed your product page. This is
important because one of the main goals for your product pages is to
encourage users to add the product to their shopping cart. If only 1 per-
cent of users who hit your product page add something to their cart,
you might not be clearly communicating what makes your product
better than what your competition offers. You can read much more
about minimizing shopping cart abandonment later in this chapter.
 Conversion Rate: The number of conversions divided by the total number
of visitors. Converting visitors into buyers, members, or subscribers is
the name of the game. This is the core metric around which everything
else ultimately revolves. Your product pages should have a clear call to
action. If not, add one and measure the results. Add some calls to action
in various places on the page and measure the before and after.
Perking up poorly producing 
product pages
Before you can optimize your product pages, you need to understand some
of the issues can prevent your visitors from browsing long enough to respond
to your call to action (if you’ve made one). It could be any number of issues,
as we discuss earlier in this chapter in the landing page section.
As you set out to optimize your product pages, start with the page that gets
the most traffic so that you can discover more quickly how the changes impact
performance. After you hit on some winning optimizations, you can use them
on your other product pages and really get your conversion rate rising.
Here’s another good idea: If you’re making changes in waves, begin your
changes above the fold — the area of the Web site that visitors see in the first
section of the browser screen (without having to scroll down). If you have
limited time, those changes are bound to make the greatest immediate
impact because some people won’t scroll down if they don’t like what they
see initially.
Just a few words about optimizing customer support sites. If your goal is to
help users get answers to questions about your products or services, you
need a well-organized site with searchable information. Site search and clear
copywriting are integral to your efforts. To read more about site search, see
Chapter 12. You’ll also find a list of critical KPIs for customer support sites in
Chapter 11.
Likewise, if you seek to optimize your content portal or blog, consider your
article or blog post pages as your product pages. Although shopping cart
metrics don’t apply, your articles are the products for content sites. Make
sure that those are optimized to sell users on coming back to your site often.
292
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

Starting with a Clean Web Slate
In rare occasions, you might need to crumble up your Web pages and throw
them in the virtual wastebasket. If your site looks like it came right of out the
early (or even the late) 1990s and you haven’t spruced up your site in five
years, the content and the design are likely in sore condition. If your naviga-
tion is a list as long as your arm, you are confusing visitors in many cases.
(There are always exceptions to the rule, of course. Some sites, like news por-
tals, can get away with lots of options. Folks expect that, though, and the nav-
igation is clearly expressed.)
If you decide to totally redesign your Web site, it’s time to go back to the basics
and review your goals. The issues we discuss earlier about landing pages, prod-
uct pages, and the home page apply here as well. You have two options:
 Redesign your site page by page while it’s live.
 Design a completely new site offline or in a development environ-
ment (a location that is online but hidden from the view of most users)
and then make it live it when it’s complete.
Either way, your focus should be on improving your KPIs.
Don’t get in a hurry with Web site optimization projects. You should make
sure you have clear goals in mind and think through each and every change
and its potential consequences before you decide to invest the time in making
them. You can take a good guess by reviewing your Web analytics data.
Determining Why Your Customers
Abandon You
Shopping cart abandonment is one of the plagues of e-commerce. Shopping
cart abandonment happens when a visitor puts items in the virtual shopping
cart and initiates the checkout process, only to leave the site before the sale
is complete. In the brick-and-mortar world, this is akin to going to the grocery
store, filling up the cart, and leaving it stranded in the produce section (filled
with rapidly melting ice cream, among other things) as you walk out the elec-
tric doors. This is one of the most frustrating statistics to review because you
were oh-so-close to hearing the welcomed cha-ching sound of your virtual
cash register — and instead, you heard the door slam shut in your face.
No one likes to be abandoned, but instead of getting offended, you need to
put on your customer-colored glasses and get to the root of the problem.
There could be any number of reasons why your customers walked away from
the deal. It’s your job to find out and to correct the problem. Of course, most
293
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site

of the time you can’t chase the customer out of those electric doors and ask
him why he abandoned the sale. However, your handy-dandy Web analytics
serves as a stealth detective who gathers clues at the scene of the crime and
delivers them to you in the form of navigational paths and numbers.
Customers bail out on the transaction for any number of reasons. Here are
some of the most common ways. As you read these reasons, consider
whether they might apply to your Web site.
 The visitor was comparison shopping. Visitors often browse before
they buy, comparing your price, shipping price, return terms, and the
like before actually making the sale. With this scenario, the visitor might
go through this process with several vendors before choosing one and
abandoning the others.
 The visitor might plan to return. Not all customers who abandon a
shopping cart abandon it for good. A ScanAlert study demonstrated that
the average time delay between a consumer’s first visit to a Web site and
the first purchase was just over 19 hours. Some took days or even weeks
to return and close the sale.
 The visitor was concerned about security. The visitor might have gotten
cold feet when it came time to enter his credit card number because the
shopping cart area did not instill consumer confidence. Some reasons
why a shopper might get cold feet are a lack of security seals from trusted
firms, such as VeriSign, TRUSTe, or the Better Business Bureau, not seeing
https in the URL, which means a secure connection has not been estab-
lished, and not offering a contact phone number on your site.
 It takes too long to seal the deal. Online shoppers demand convenience.
That’s why they let their fingers do the walking rather than driving to the
store and buying what they want immediately. If it takes too long to close
the deal — say, they have to jump through pages of hoops masquerading
as lengthy registration forms — they might decide it’s not worth it.
 Your site loads too slowly. If the visitor, virtual arms overloaded with
products, clicks the Order Now button and watches (and watches and
watches) as the order processes, he might get impatient and decide to
click the Stop button on the browser, effectively canceling the sale.
 Shipping charges are too high. You might have great prices on your prod-
ucts, but if you charge an arm and a leg to ship it, potential customers
might abandon the sale. You can avoid this by offering a shipping calcula-
tor before the visitor puts the item in the cart. It won’t help you close the
sale, but it will help you determine in your analytics report whether they
possibly decided not to buy the item based on the shipping charges.
 Shipping time is too long. By the same token, if you don’t offer express
mail services and the visitor needs the product overnight, he might
abandon the sale.
 The product is backordered. The time to tell a customer that the prod-
uct is backordered is not when she goes to close the sale. That’s just
294
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

annoying. Your Web site should let visitors know when they go to enter
the item in the cart that it will not be available until next month, and
then give them the opportunity to have it shipped when it is available.
 The visitor changes her mind. It’s a woman’s prerogative to change her
mind — and a man’s, too. Quite possibly, the buyer got cold feet and
decided to abandon the transaction. That might be a better outcome
than buyer’s remorse that leads to returns. There’s no way that Web ana-
lytics can tell you this. It’s pretty advanced, but it doesn’t read minds.
 You lack a return policy. If you don’t have a return policy, the visitor
might choose to not take a risk. If you do have a return policy, the visitor
might not agree with the terms. If your Web analytics show that the visitor
abandoned the sale after reading your return policy, that’s a strong clue.
 Too much personal info is required. Sometimes visitors don’t want to
register with your site if they are required to ante up too much informa-
tion about themselves, such as annual income, birthdate, and gender. If
your site doesn’t offer a quick checkout opportunity that lets them make
a purchase without anteing up too much personal information, they
might go to a vendor who does.
 Your checkout process is confusing. Your shopping cart process should
be easy to wade through. If it’s not clear where to enter information or
how to redeem gift certificates or how to ship to a different address than
the billing address, your would-be customers could bid you farewell
instead of sending you their credit card information.
 You don’t offer order tracking. Some consumers want to know where
their package is every step of the way, especially if they need it in a
hurry or are nervous about online shopping to begin with. If you don’t
have order tracking, they might back out of the sale.
Reducing Shopping Cart Abandonment
At this point, we have some good news and some bad news. You will never be
able to completely eliminate shopping cart abandonment. It is a sad fact of life
that you must learn to live with. The good news is that you can tap into the
power of your Web analytics software to find ways to reduce abandonment —
and, at the same time, increase your conversion rate. In fact, you can learn
more about what your customers expect from your site by paying attention
to these metrics.
What you’ll find as you fine-tune this aspect of your Web site is that a little
common sense goes a long way. At this critical turning point in the conver-
sion funnel, it’s imperative that you get your customer-colored glasses out of
your drawer and onto your face. We recommend that you visit some leading
e-commerce retailers to see what they are doing. Read this section first, though,
so you can understand the why behind the what.
295
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site

Finding out why shopping 
carts are abandoned
Before you set out to put the kibosh on shopping cart abandonment, you
need to clearly define what that really means to you. Sure, at a broad level,
you understand that shopping cart abandonment simply means the customer
had “stuff” in the online shopping cart but decided for one of many reasons
not to complete the sale. You need to narrow that definition a bit, though, or
you could be spinning your optimization wheels.
Especially with expensive items, a visitor might return to your site multiple
times to do research before making up his mind. With inexpensive items, it
not be worth including the abandonment in your overall rates because it
doesn’t affect your business enough to justify making changes to your
process. Perhaps some visitors treat the shopping cart like a bookmark to
save items they want to go back and look at again but might not be ready to
buy. (Sites like Amazon.com implemented wish lists for customers who are
browsing but perhaps not ready to make a purchase. Amazon then takes that
information to personalize e-mail campaigns or product offers that appear
when you first enter the home page. Pretty clever, eh?)
You can set some parameters in place to account for those types of situations
so that you don’t get inflated numbers that are meaningless. By determining
how long a cart can sit empty before you label it abandoned or the total
dollar amount a cart must reach before you consider it worthy of measuring,
you can fine-tune this metric and optimize accordingly.
Shopping cart KPIs to watch
Web analytics offers some strategic insights into shopping cart abandonment
in the form of KPIs. After you have a handle on these metrics, you can deter-
mine which of the strategies we offer for reducing shopping cart abandon-
ment later in this chapter are the best options for your site.
 Cart Completion Rate: The number of users who completed the shopping
cart process, usually by clicking a Checkout button, divided by the total
number of users who started a shopping cart. If this number is high, you’ve
either made it very easy for your visitors to close the sale, or they wanted
what you were selling badly enough to jump through pages of hoops to get
through the buying process. If this number is low, your buying process
might be too complex. Try to limit the number of steps to three.
 Checkout Completion Rate: The number of users who completed the
checkout process, usually by finalizing and paying for an order, divided
by the total number of users who started the checkout process. This
might sound a little bit like the conversion rate, but they’re different:
296
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

• The Checkout Completion Rate compares how many people com-
pleted the checkout process with how many people actually
started the checkout process.
• A conversion rate in the traditional sense of the word compares
how many people completed the shopping cart process with the
number of people who visited the site.
The Checkout Completion Rate metric is important because if only 10 per-
cent of people who start a cart actually complete it, your shopping cart
process might be too long, your shipping charges could be too high, or you
have one of the other reasons we outline earlier. Either way, it tells you that
something about your shopping cart process causes people to leave.
 Ratio of Checkout Starts to Cart Starts: The number of users who start
the checkout process compared with the number of users who added
items to their shopping cart. People add things to carts all the time, and
then they never start the actual checkout process for whatever reason.
There are things you can do to push people toward the checkout after
they add items to their shopping cart. Make sure that your Checkout
button is clearly evident. If you offer free shipping, really hammer that
message after a user adds something to his cart. Talk up your return
policy (if it’s good). This is an important and sometimes easily improved
metric for e-commerce sites that want to ratchet up the conversion rate.
Sealing the shopping cart deal
Finally, the section you’ve been waiting for — the ways to reduce your shop-
ping cart abandonment rate. Besides fixing all the problems we outline ear-
lier, you can also take these measure steps (notice we said measure steps) to
increase your chances of sealing the deal. Try some or all of these tactics and
then measure your shopping cart KPIs again. We bet you’ll see improvements.
297
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site
Offering multiple payment options
Visitors might abandon their shopping cart (and
your opportunity for greater profits with it) if you
don’t offer multiple payment options. In fact,
Quality Research Associates polled 147 of the
leading online retailers last year to determine
the benefits of offering multiple payment options
and concluded that sellers who accept four
types of payments (such as credit cards, online
checks, PayPal, and similar services) have more
visitors convert to customers than merchants
who offer a single payment method. In fact,
merchants can covert as many as 20 percent
more customers by offering them more pay-
ment types to choose from, according to the
study. This is true, the study concluded,
because Internet shoppers now include more
people who might not have credit cards. Or for
security purposes, people might choose to use
an alternative payment service such as Google
Checkout or Bill Me Later instead.

 Streamline the checkout process. How many steps are in your checkout
process? Two, three, five, nine? Some believe the fewer steps, the better.
Others believe it doesn’t really matter as long as it’s not confusing. We
believe that less is more in this case. If you can condense the number of
steps without making it confusing, you should. And there shouldn’t be
any reason not to. You don’t need a visitor’s life history in order to fulfill
the product order.
 Use a progress indicator. No matter whether your checkout process is
one step or ten steps, let visitors know what to expect along the way.
Tell them they are on Step 3: Address Information or Step 8: Payment
Information. Make a way for them to click the Back button so they can
change information without losing everything they’ve entered on later
pages in the process.
 Offer a link back to the product. Make it easy for visitors to check back
and make sure they are getting what they thought they were getting. If
you offer a link back to the product page, you can ease their minds by
making it easy for them to review the product description one last time
before authorizing the credit card swipe. If the visitor has to leave the
shopping cart area and wander back through the navigation system or
search function, she might never make her way back.
 Use thumbnails. You use images on your product pages, so why not use
them in the shopping cart? Using thumbnail images of what the cus-
tomer ordered can ring that mental bell so he doesn’t have to even click
the link back to the product page. By the same token, be sure to include
the quantity and size in the product description that appears next to the
thumbnail.
 Change quantity. Make it easy for your visitors to change the quantity of
the items they are buying. Don’t make them start the checkout process
all over — or worse, empty the cart and start the entire visit over. They
might forget to put some items back in the cart — or not even bother 
at all.
 Use clear error messages. Make error messages easy to understand
rather than cryptic or difficult to follow. It’s a frustrating exercise to try
to convince a computer to accept the expiration date on your credit
card when it wants that info in some newfangled format previously
unknown to man. Make sure the bugs aren’t your fault or that what you
are asking for isn’t in some strange format.
 Provide purchase options. Even if the visitor is halfway through the
process, she might decide to pick up the phone and call instead. Make it
easy by providing a phone number on every page along the way.
 Use live chat software. Live chat software can help minimize shopping
cart abandonment. If the visitor gets confused, your live chat rep is
there to answer questions. Don’t let your reps barge in on the process,
though. Always let the visitor initiate contact. You don’t want them to
feel like Big Brother is watching — even if he is.
298
Part IV: Knowledge Is Power — Making Analytics Work for You 

 Don’t advertise. Don’t place advertising banners or other forms of mar-
keting in the shopping cart area. You don’t want to distract shoppers.
You’ve got them right where you want them, why risk that they’ll click a
banner that will take them somewhere else?
 Promote return policies. Make it clear within your shopping cart that
you offer a no-risk guarantee. You want visitors to feel comfortable
buying from you. Let them know they can return or exchange the item if
it doesn’t satisfy them when they see it in real life.
 Reassure about privacy. Any time you ask for personal information,
include language alongside the request that ensures the visitor that you
will not sell his private information but will protect it. Four simple words
We value your privacy — can go a long way toward reassuring would-be
customers.
 Send a pop-up message. Technology allows you to send a pop-up mes-
sage that reminds the visitor that they have items in their cart. Perhaps
they forgot and will thank you for the gentle nudge. You get the sale. 
The worst thing they could do is close the message. But at least you
gave it a shot.
 Don’t empty the cart. Technology also allows you to not immediately
empty the cart when the visitor leaves. It could be that their computer
crashed. They will be grateful that they didn’t lose all the items in their
shopping cart — and so will you.
 E-mail customers. If you save the cart contents, you could e-mail cus-
tomers and remind them that you’ve done so, or that their cart is about
to expire. Again, you have lots to gain and nothing to lose.
 Run a dummy test. Have someone who isn’t well versed with e-com-
merce try to make a purchase on your site to see how did he fares? If he
makes it through with all his hair, good for you. If he abandons the cart,
go back to the top of this list and choose some additional changes to
implement.
These are all good tips, but your site isn’t like any other, and your site does-
n’t have the same challenges as any other. It’s important, then, to review your
Web analytics to discover exactly at what point your visitors abandon a sale.
After you identify your weak spots, you can focus your attention on strength-
ening those areas.
Measuring the Effect of Site Changes
Don’t make the mistake of working up a sweat making changes to your site
without measuring the impact of your toil. Throughout this chapter, we give
you some pointers about what to look for along the way. Now, we take a big-
picture view of your site that takes all the potential changes in perspective
299
Chapter 16: Fine-Tuning Your Web Site

and offer a few tips for the road. Keep in mind that you typically need at least
four weeks of Web analytics data to really discern the impact of the site changes
you’re making. Also keep in mind the many X factors that can give you false
positives and traffic boosts, such as seasonal events, societal trends, and
other things that you can’t control — and, therefore, cannot replicate.
When you work on enhancing an individual page, we recommend that you
make several versions of the same page. Each version should have different
combinations of design enhancements or content changes. You can test one
page each week until you run through the lot of them, and then aggregate
your Web analytics results to determine which pages performed the best. You
might discover that three out of the eight pages you created were top per-
formers. That’s good; now narrow it down even further by taking combina-
tions of those design and content elements and creating three more test
pages until you have a clear winner. Alternatively, you could choose to make
one minor change at a time and measure the results, but that can leave you
with slowed results, at best.
Clickalyzer (www.clickalyzer.com) makes some bold promises — and
delivers. This software tells you why people leave your Web site without
buying, which traffic sources are truly profitable to you (even before they
ever convert), exactly how far down a page someone reads, and what hap-
pens on your affiliate’s Web sites right down to the point of sale. This is inter-
esting software that’s worth the buck you pay for a seven-day trial. After that,
you’ll pay $29.95 a month or $299.95 a year (you save $60 by paying up front).
Clickalyzer puts you in the driver’s seat. You can tell the program what you
want to see and what you don’t want to see. Split testing is another keen fea-
ture. You can rotate the URL of a single Web address between several differ-
ent Web site addresses. That allows you to test the effectiveness of different
sales copy, pricing strategies and various other options.
If you want to kick-start your testing, you could choose to launch a paid
search campaign. It will send plenty of traffic your way and allow you to
come to some conclusions in a matter of days rather than weeks. That said,
don’t be too hasty with your final decision. Review your metrics, put them in
context, and then decide. What you’ll discover is that Web site optimization
is an ongoing process. It never ends. Your search for statistical treasure that
will continually improve your conversions is a lifetime proposition. Happy
analyzing.

N
ow that you’ve got the basics of Web analytics
under your belt, this final part of the book will help
you implement best practices, avoid common pitfalls, and
utterly convince you that this software will revolutionize
your e-business.
We talk about a number of myths, pitfalls, and mistakes
that are common in the Web analytics realm. You may
have made some assumptions about how Web analytics
will work for you — and they may be all wrong. You’re not
alone. There are plenty of stumbling blocks on the road to
Web site optimization. We’ll help you avoid them.
Of course, it’s one thing to avoid pitfalls. It’s another thing
to find a road that’s been freshly paved. In this part, we
also illustrate some Web analytics best practices. These
approaches to interpreting the data are tried-and-true and
will work for you. Finally, we make a convincing case for
the overwhelming impact Web analytics could have on
your Web site today — and tomorrow. With Google and
Microsoft getting into the game, the industry is bound to
see even further advancements.

Ten Web Analytics Myths,
Mistakes, and Pitfalls
In This Chapter
 Six of the most erroneous Web analytics myths
 Two of the most horrific Web analytics mistakes
 Two of the most pitiful Web analytics pitfalls
P
lenty of Web analytics myths circulate online, and there are probably as
many mistakes to make as statistics to measure. If you aren’t careful,
you could end up in the fairy-tale world of Neverland with Tinkerbell inter-
preting your data, and Peter Pan making changes to your Web site. Make no
mistake — the real world of Web analytics isn’t a place where the data is
black and white but rather can be sliced and diced in many different ways.
As you begin to put what you’ve read in this book into practice, remember to
go in with your eyes wide open. Don’t listen to just anybody and everybody’s
latest “strategies” for how to wade through your data more effectively. Any
black belt karate master will tell you this: The strength is in the fundamen-
tals. The same is true for Web analytics. Straying from the fundamentals will
lead you into pitfalls that can be hard to escape.
You’ll be tempted to look at averages, Top 10 lists, and monthly visitor trends.
Go ahead and look, but don’t let these reports muddy your decision-making
process. Just like world-changing events in a history book, Web analytics
data has to be put into context in order for the reader — that’s you — to truly
understand what has happened in his world.
Like we said, there are plenty of Web analytics myths circulating online and
dozens of mistakes you could make. Although this list is certainly not exhaus-
tive, it does offer insight into some of the most common mistakes. These uni-
versal errors are based on wrong perspectives that, if corrected, will help you
avoid the many other blunders.

Averages Are the Analytics Answer
Oh, what a wonderful world it would be if Web analytics offered a single digit
to describe your Web site’s performance. Imagine the glorious ease of a figure
that took into account every possible analytic — from unique visitors to
length of stay to page views, and more — and offered an arithmetic mean to
portray your site’s performance on a scale of 1 to 10. A 1 might indicate that
your paid search campaigns are failing miserably and that your traffic is
shrinking month by month. A 10 would offer a picture of perfection, where
visitors respond to organic search strategies, make large purchases, and
return again and again. Unfortunately, one number does not fit all.
It’s a fallacy, or at least an online urban legend, that averages are the answer.
True, Web analytics software offers plenty of averages, such as average time
on site, average visitors per day, average pages per visit, and so on. However,
these median figures might not be as telling as they appear. You have power-
ful technology at your fingertips, so why settle for averages when you can
drill down to specific data points that help you outline action plans?
Before you throw your averages out the window, allow us to explain. Averages
are helpful when you use them in tandem. It’s discouraging to learn that visi-
tors who find your Web site through organic search — a search that retrieves
results by indexing pages based on content and keyword relevancy — spent
an average time on site of only 35 seconds. However, say you can glean that
your paid search or pay per click (PPC) traffic — namely, visitors who are
drawn to the site through search engine listings that you pay for — post an
average time on site of 180 seconds. When you compare one group of visitors
with another, you can easily see that your PPC campaigns draw the more
valuable traffic.
Just like there is no such thing as one number that fits all, there is no such
thing as an average visitor. Like the people those metrics represent, many dif-
ferent types of users will use your site differently. Visitors who come to your
site through organic search might have knocked on your virtual door by mis-
take and left in chagrin when they realized the error. Paid search visitors
know exactly where they are going, and then it’s up to you to deliver the
goods after they get there. Weekend visitors might have different habits than
weekday visitors, morning visitors than late night visitors, and so on.
Monthly Visitor Trends Tell All
When you turn the pages of women’s magazines, you see the latest trends in
fashion design. When you explore a business magazine, you learn about the
304
Part V: The Part of Tens 

latest management trends. Much the same, when you delve into Web ana-
lytics, you discover visitor trends. Identifying trends is a key to data deci-
phering, but it’s the trends you watch that make the difference. Watch the
wrong trends, and you’ll end up making the wrong decisions.
Here’s the myth: You can determine visitor trends by simply reviewing your
monthly visitor report. Perhaps you can indeed determine overall traffic
trends — whether page views, unique visitors, and length of stay is up or
down for any given 30-day period — by scanning the charts and graphs in
your monthly visitor report. But wait: Don’t get too excited about an upward
trend in traffic and begin increasing your PPC dollars arbitrarily.
Trends based on the monthly visitor report alone can be somewhat of an
optical illusion, tricking your eyes into seeing something that is not really
there or incorrectly perceiving what is there. In other words, the surface data
can be deceptive. For starters, the monthly visitor report draws you into a
time warp, of sorts, because the time intervals depicted don’t reflect real-
world events. The report surely offers a snapshot of how your site performed
but doesn’t take into account the e-mail campaign you released in week one
or the site optimization project you completed six weeks ago. Likewise, your
Web analytics software clearly depicts traffic ebbs and flows, but the num-
bers alone cannot tell you the reasons behind those spikes.
Instead of watching monthly trends and monthly trends alone, define the
trends that matter most to your site. You do that by segmenting the time peri-
ods your software is evaluating. Don’t let your software dictate the timing:
Put the clock in your own hands by setting your own dates based on events
(such as weekend promotions) and activities (such as blogging updates). For
example, if you send out an e-mail blast on January 15, compare your conver-
sion rates two weeks before and two weeks after the campaign. (The conver-
sion rate is the percentage of visitors who completed a transaction; filled out
a membership; or, in the case of lead generation, requested additional infor-
mation.) Those real comparisons speak undiluted volumes.
Pinpoint Precision Is Paramount
The “accuracy” myth is hard to wrap your head around, especially in the
realm of data. After all, who wants to make business decisions based on inex-
act statistics? Would Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates tolerate approximations
in his boardroom meetings? If he’s measuring how many visitors used MSN
portal in June, “close” might have to be good enough.
305
Chapter 17: Ten Web Analytics Myths, Mistakes, and Pitfalls

The accuracy myth states, in no uncertain terms, that pinpoint precision is
paramount to determining how your Web site is performing. The fact is,
though, that no Web analytics software is 100-percent accurate. Many factors
can skew the data, such as proxy servers, tabbed browsing, dynamic IP
addresses, ever-changing security enhancements, and other emerging tech-
nologies. Web analytics software does offer close estimates: Certain metrics,
such as unique visitors, are more valuable than other metrics (such as hits).
Before you throw your software program out the window — and this book
along with it — take a deep breath and consider what matters: whether the
overall metrics are improving or declining.
At the end of the day, it doesn’t matter too much whether 25,000 or 25,500
visitors navigated your well-designed Web pages. You shouldn’t be too con-
cerned one way or another over 500 visitors (unless your site is only getting
500 visitors a month because it then may be time to break out the aspirin to
ease your aching head). On the other hand, you should be extremely con-
cerned if your visitor count drops from 25,000 to 10,000. That would qualify
as a bona fide emergency that requires your full attention to diagnose a dis-
ease and determine a cure.
Top-level data is not nearly as powerful as contextual data. Drill down from
the top-level conclusion that says, “Search engines send me the most traffic”
to the more specific “Google sent 60 percent of my unique visitors last month.”
But don’t stop there. You won’t hit oil until you compare this month’s Google
traffic with last month’s Google traffic to discover that your Adwords campaign
is a gusher. Contextual data might also compare search engine to search engine
in light of search engine optimization (SEO) initiatives that were launched on

Determine ROI improvements
You can determine the effect of your Web ini-
tiatives by measuring the key performance indi-
cators (KPIs), which is information viewable
from the Web analytics dashboard that illus-
trates how well the site is performing against
goals at strategic time intervals. You can not
only determine the impact but also get clues as
to the lingering effects of the campaign.
Here’s a rough overview:
1. Measure your KPIs before your promotion
to establish a baseline.
2. Measure your KPIs the day of your promo-
tion to measure the immediate effect.
3. Measure your KPIs two weeks after your
promotion.
4. Measure your KPIs three weeks after your
promotion.
You can read much more about KPIs in Chap-
ter 11.

various engines. (SEO comprises methods to improve the rankings for rele-
vant keywords in search results by making changes to the content or naviga-
tional structure of a Web site.)
Unique Visitor Data Tells the Truth
It’s true that unique visitor counts can offer a more accurate metric of site
traffic than pageviews or hits, but the notion that all unique visitor tracking is
accurate is a new wives’ tale in the Web analytics era. Web analytics applica-
tions track unique users in two basic ways, by
 An IP address, which is a unique numeric identifier assigned by a user’s
Internet service provider (ISP)
 Cookies, which are small text files that hold defined visitor information
Because of proxy servers and dynamic IP addresses, counting IP addresses
isn’t entirely accurate. And when it comes to cookies, you have to face the
possibility that users will delete their cookies or have their security settings
set to block cookies.
Analytics applications that rely entirely on IP addresses to track unique visi-
tors fall short in two ways: when a user’s ISP assigns a dynamic IP address
and when a visitor is surfing your site from behind a proxy or network IP. A
dynamic IP address is one that changes each time a user connects to the
Internet; or, in some cases, when they browse the Internet. Proxy and network
IP addresses let several users connect to the Internet through the same IP
address at the same time.
Analytics applications count each individual IP address. So if an individual
user is browsing your site from several IP addresses, your unique visitor
counts are automatically inflated. Comparatively, if several visitors access
your site through a proxy or network IP address, your analytics program
might count them all as one unique visitor.
All Web Analytics Software Is Alike
Saying that all Web analytics software is alike is akin to saying that all word
processing applications are alike. Sure, they share some common denomina-
tors, such as text entry and formatting. Similarly, all Web analytics software
tracks fundamental metrics, such as hits, pageviews, unique visitors, and site
307
Chapter 17: Ten Web Analytics Myths, Mistakes, and Pitfalls

referrers. And, just like how sophisticated word processing programs offer
much more than the ability to type text onto a digital page (such as internal,
dictionaries, grammar checking, and even layout tools), sophisticated Web
analytics software offers much more than the fundamentals. In fact, the most
advanced programs on the market run complex analytics systems that parse
data in real-time and present 3-D page-traffic reports.
308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
When the cookie crumbles
For all the Web analytics myths and mistakes,
misconceptions about cookies are making it
more difficult to measure unique visitors. Cookies
are small files that can hold information on the
times and dates when a user visits your Web site.
Examples are log in or registration information,
online shopping cart data, user preferences, and
the like. Cookies allow Amazon.com to recognize
you and offer a list of personalized product rec-
ommendations. You don’t even need to register
or submit any information for Amazon to start
tracking your Web site behavior and targeting its
marketing efforts to your sweet spots.
However, cookies don’t take into account the
possibility that one person could be using sev-
eral different browsers, such as Firefox and
Internet Explorer, to access the same site from
the same computer. That single visitor, then,
would register as two unique visitors when tech-
nically only one person viewed the site. Likewise,
cookies don’t take into account that one person
can call up the same sporting goods Web site
from several different computers in several dif-
ferent locations all in the course of a single day.
Further, cookies don’t take into account that sev-
eral people could use the same computer and
the same browser to visit the same site on the
same day. Can you see the cookie crumbling?
Another important consideration in the cookie
tracking method is cookie deletion issues. If one
individual deletes the cookies from a Firefox
browser but doesn’t delete them from an Internet
Explorer browser, the number of unique visitors is
skewed, depending on which browser the visitor
is using. One individual can accept cookies on one
computer yet reject them on another. There are
more than a dozen different scenarios that could
cause the proverbial cookie to crumble.
Although cookies are invaluable to Web site
owners and can be convenient for users, the
fear of adware and spyware leads many con-
sumers to rid themselves of these files. In fact,
a survey conducted by JupiterResearch (www.
jupiterresearch.com) found that as
many as 39 percent of U.S. Web surfers delete
cookies from their computers at least once per
month, with 17 percent erasing cookies once
per week and 10 percent cleaning them out
daily. That means that if your Web analytics soft-
ware uses cookies alone to track unique users,
the sheer number of your unique visitors could
fluctuate dramatically over a 30-day period.
Cookies are a great asset to Web analytics soft-
ware, but they can also be a liability in some
cases if you don’t measure your metrics in con-
text. If you compare groups of visitors with each
other, such as visitors who found your Web site
through Google with visitors who found your
Web site through Yahoo!, the cookie issues
become less of an issue. Sure, you still have to
deal with the multiple browser issue, but you
are mitigating the cookie deletion dilemma.

Because Web analytics terminology and methodology is still evolving, inter-
preting metrics offered by one application might require a different approach
than interpreting metrics offered by another. Analytics such as pageviews,
visits, and unique visitors are slightly different from system to system. Making
matters more confusing, different products from the same vendor might count
in different ways.
A key reason for the discrepancies is how the products are delivered: client-
side, server-side, or hosted. You can read about the differences in detail in
Chapter 4. Another reason for the inconsistencies is how the software is con-
figured. We recommend that you configure your Web analytics tools based on
data-collection and reporting best practices. Omniture (www.omniture.com)
launched a Best Practices Group in 2006 to address some of these issues.
Then conduct ongoing accuracy audits to ensure data reliability.
Choosing a Web analytics application because it works well for your friend
could leave you with a bullet in your foot. Every Web site is different, with dif-
ferent goals and measures of success. Every Web analytics program is differ-
ent, with different features and functions. Before choosing a vendor, you need
to know what data and metrics are most important to your business. Then
you can focus on finding programs that offer exactly what you need.
But Numbers Never Lie . . .
An old adage emphatically states that numbers never lie. That’s a half-truth
that was probably coined by an accountant type who sees the world in black-
and-white digits. It’s a half-truth because, well, numbers themselves might
not lie. They are what they are. Still, numbers can be skewed to portray an
inaccurate picture; and, with mountains of data, statistical perception can be
downright deceiving. As we’ve learned with the corporate accounting scan-
dals of the past few years, numbers have been at the heart of some of the
biggest lies of our day.
This is not an accuracy myth; rather, it’s a metric myth. Some metrics are
downright overrated. The marketing industry might build a buzz around hits,
for instance, but advertisers are beginning to catch on to the flaw in this broad
figure. So it is true that numbers don’t lie. However, your goal is to avoid toil-
ing over metrics that don’t really matter to your bottom line. Making decisions
about your Web site based on metrics that don’t accurately measure online
success is a flat-out mistake. An informed decision based on the wrong infor-
mation is an ill-advised decision.

Chapter 17: Ten Web Analytics Myths, Mistakes, and Pitfalls

Take site referrers for example. Site referrers, or referring pages, are the URLs
of the previous Web page from which a link was followed. In the SEO world,
these are called backlinks. You might have an impressive number of back-
links, perhaps hundreds or even thousands. You might drill down a little fur-
ther and determine that those backlinks brought 150,000 visitors — unique
visitors, at that — to your Web site. Before you get too excited, though, don’t
forget a couple more metrics that matter:
 Depth of visit: Depth of visit shows you how many of your Web pages a
visitor viewed.
 Length of stay: Length of stay indicates how long the visitor was on your
site. If most of those 150,000 visitors stayed an average of 10 seconds
and viewed one page, what have you gained? Making a decision to invest
more resources on linking partners based on pure traffic generation
alone would be erroneous.
Make money with your metrics
There’s potential money in your metrics. That’s right, if you understand how
to analyze your Web analytics, you can uncover revenue-generating opportu-
nities to which you would otherwise be blind. However, there is a rhyme and
reason to making money with your metrics. Consider the following steps as
you set out to tap your stats for more income:
1. Determine the type of site you have — e-commerce, lead generation,
content portal, and so on — as well as its goals.
2. Determine relevant KPIs, such as new account sign-ups, Contact Us
form completions, article views, online sales, case study downloads,
and so on.
3. Combine relevant metrics (such as pageviews, visitors, length of stay,
and site referrers) to get a clear picture of what drives conversions as
well as where your site needs optimization or your marketing efforts
need tweaking.
4. Develop a strategy, take action and continue to measure your results
to continual improvement.
A Picture Speaks a Thousand Words
The world of Web analytics is a world of multicolored charts, graphs, and
other visuals that are bound to attract the attention of Web site owners who
would rather look at pretty pictures than crunch numbers. Whether you
prefer pie charts, line graphs, bar graphs, or some other type of picturesque
310
Part V: The Part of Tens 

presentation, you’ll find it in a Web analytics program near you. But don’t get
too enamored with session graphs, pageviews graphs, hits graphs, bytes
graphs, and the like, or you could fall into a nasty trap: putting too much
stock in charts.
Don’t get us wrong: Eye-pleasing graphical data is helpful, but there is a ten-
dency to skip the hard data analysis in reliance of the colorful imagery. The
problem with graphs is they highlight trends only at a glance. In order to
make the most of your Web analytics, you need to dissect the data, run com-
parisons on various groups, and otherwise gain a deeper understanding of
the statistics the technology worked so hard to gather. ClickTracks CEO John
Marshall once said in his charming accent, “Data must be clear first, pretty
second.” We wholeheartedly agree.
For an example of this concept, take a look at Figure 17-1. At first glance, you
might see that traffic spike on Wednesday and rush to the marketing depart-
ment folks to tell them to get the campaign that drove that traffic online again.
However, when you dig a little deeper, behind the bar graphs, you’d see that
the majority of the visitors from that day stayed less than 20 seconds and did
not visit any secondary pages. Obviously, the campaign was great at generat-
ing traffic, but this is not the type of traffic that converts to sales. Bottom line:
Spending more money on a campaign like this won’t pay dividends.

Chapter 17: Ten Web Analytics Myths, Mistakes, and Pitfalls

After you get more acquainted with Web analytics, you’ll begin to understand
what the highest-paid analysts already know: Graphics are helpful in persuad-
ing decision makers to invest in new initiatives, but flashy imagery without
an in-depth comprehension of how those numbers really affect your return
on investment are only ostentatious displays of artistic flair. If you insist upon
relying on graphics, make sure you understand what the colors — and the
shades of those colors — actually mean.
Popular Search Terms Hold 
the Key to More Traffic
Basing decisions about your organic search or PPC campaigns based on pop-
ular keywords and phrases alone could leave you with more than empty
pockets: It could put you right out of business. Indeed, in the age where you
rack up a large pay-per-click bill in a hurry, this is one of the biggest dangers
in interpreting Web analytics data. We’d like to rescue you from this bottom-
less pit before you ever come to its edge.
We can just hear you now, “Wait a minute! Keywords drive most of my traffic.
How can investing in the most popular phrases be a bad thing?” Before your
brain goes tilt, allow us to explain. See, there is a fundamental difference
between quantity and quality. It doesn’t really matter whether the keyphrase
gold tennis balls drives the most traffic to your Web site if you are selling jew-
elry. Are you starting to get the picture? When you look at your Web ana-
lytics, you’ll notice all sorts of strange keywords and keyphrases popping 
up — some of them with great frequency. But it doesn’t do you a darn bit of
good if they aren’t relevant because visitors looking for gold tennis balls are
extremely unlikely to buy an expensive tennis bracelet.
Quality keywords and keyphrases are more likely to lead to conversions,
which is the name of the game. So you don’t want to merely know what key-
words and keyphrases are the most popular. You want to know what 
keywords and keyphrases are bringing bona fide customers to your site.
When you sit down to analyze your keywords popularity to plan your PPC
spend, don’t limit yourself to what’s on the chart. You might need to consider
using some new search terms based on new products or services. You also
might need to retire popular search terms that don’t lead to conversions.
There is a whole industry devoted to SEO for a reason. Don’t make the mis-
take of making assumptions based on popularity contest alone. Compare
your data with other statistics to get the whole picture.

Funnel Vision Offers a Quick Fix
Like graphs and charts, your funnel report can be fun. The conversion funnel
outlines a series of linear steps a visitor takes toward a transaction, such as
an e-commerce sale or a newsletter subscription. In other words, the conver-
sion funnel shows you many of your visitors expressed interest in your wid-
gets, how many put the widget into the virtual cart, and how many carts were
pushed through the checkout lane to seal the deal. Here’s the pitfall: Visitors
don’t always walk in a straight line, and the funnel doesn’t offer insight into
why they abandoned you midstream.
Like a funnel that you use to pour the contents of a large jug of water into a
small bottle of water, the funnel merely channels the flow. The large jug of
water represents the myriad of customers who enter your Web site with high
hopes of finding what they are looking for. The small bottle represents the
few who actually found it and purchased it. Each stage of the funnel gets nar-
rower, winnowing out those who exited before conversion. Funnel vision,
though, isn’t broad enough to show you how many times the visitor clicked
around your site looking for the right color, size, shape, or other product
characteristic before the put the item in the shopping cart.
The visitor might exit the shopping cart temporarily to shop for more items,
to read the return policy, or to check the shipping charges. That act clogs the
linear flow of the funnel, and some funnel reports will put the cap back on the
gallon water bottle and start over again. That makes it impossible to truly
determine your conversion rate because one visitor is split into two. You
can’t make smart decisions based only on the funnel because it only tells you
half the story, at best. Advanced Web analytics programs offer more robust
funnel reports that address some of these issues. Once again, though, just
like charts and graphs, relying on funnel reports alone could be a fatal flaw.
Betting the Farm on Top 10 Lists
Billboard magazine, The New York Times and even late night show host David
Letterman have conditioned us to look to Top 10 lists when making decisions
about what to listen to, what to buy, and, well, what to laugh at. Web analyt-
ics reports have no lack of Top 10 lists of their own. You can get a list of the
Top 10 countries, the Top 10 referrers, the Top 10 robots, and so on.
The keywords and referrer lists are two of the most popular of the popularity
records because they tell you what led traffic to your site. Just like keyword
313
Chapter 17: Ten Web Analytics Myths, Mistakes, and Pitfalls

popularity alone won’t win any conversion prices, these Top 10 lists shouldn’t
dictate your decision-making, either. Digging for statistical treasure requires
deeper excavation because barring any major changes on your Web site, the
Top 10 remain fairly constant. It’s the trends that are developing below the
surface that help you see where small changes could pay big dividends. For
example, the 20th most popular keyphrase might lead to more conversions
than #3. Following that path of reasoning, the 100th most popular site refer-
rer could actually be the one that pays the bills.
Your goal with Web analytics is to identify the best traffic, and that usually
comes from the most targeted efforts. If home-and-garden bloggers are raving
about your selection of exotic fertilizer, this accidental viral marketing proba-
bly won’t bring you large volumes of traffic because the viewing audience is
much smaller than the overall online population. Still, the traffic you receive
from those blogging recommendations is prequalified. The pump has been
primed, and conversions are far more likely even though the blog never
makes it in your Top 10 list, or even your Top 50.
The more site referrers you have, the deeper you need to go in your search
for statistical treasure. If you have 5,000 site referrers, consider using Web
analytics software to help you see how the list is changing from month to
month. ClickTracks (www.clicktracks.com) offers a feature called The
What’s Changed Report that quickly tells you just that — what’s changed in
the past day, week, or month.

Will Revolutionize E-Business

evolutionary. It’s a term that’s almost overused in today’s world. You
hear about revolutionary new medicines and revolutionary new diets
and even revolutionary new laundry detergents. When writing this book, we
almost hesitated to use the word revolutionary in connection with Web ana-
lytics. But then we figured, heck — this is one place where it actually fits.
Web analytics is a revolutionary practice that can transform an e-business
from an ugly online frog to an Internet prince almost as fast as a fair maiden
can pucker up.
Well, okay, maybe not quite that fast. Web analytics does require diligent
analysis followed by persistent action with ongoing measurement, testing,
measurement, testing, and so on. However, Web analytics doesn’t need to
take years or even months to pay off. You can see the revolutionary effects 
of this software on your Web site in weeks — or, in some instances, even 
days — if you make smart decisions according to the data.
There is little doubt from industry analysts, online marketing gurus, or savvy
Internet entrepreneurs that Web analytics will revolutionize e-business as we
know it. In fact, it already has for those who have tapped into the power that
this knowledge offers. That knowledge is ever increasing with new iterations
of these powerful software tools that offer a behind-the-scenes look at cus-
tomer behavior.

If you still don’t believe in the power of Web analytics to transform your 
e-business, consider this: Google and Microsoft are making their moves in
this arena. These companies are known for revolutionary products in their
respective fields. Still need some convincing? Take a look at these top ten 
reasons — oh, there are many more than ten — that Web analytics will revo-
lutionize your e-business.
Truly Develop a User-Oriented Web Site
User-friendly sites were once all the rage. Guess what? They still are. Web
analytics can revolutionize your e-business with insights that help you develop
a user-optimized site. Your analytics program can reveal what browsers your
visitors use, what version of JavaScript they run, what operating systems
they use, what their screen resolution and color quality are, what country
they are visiting from, and other important metrics.
Different browsers display your Web site differently. Unfortunately, different
is not always better. A site that looks great in Microsoft’s Internet Explorer
browser may not even function in Apple’s Safari browser. And a site that
adheres to the strict Firefox requirements might look skewed in some of the
lesser-known browsers, like Opera.
If you discover that the vast majority of your visitors are viewing your site in
a certain browser, consider optimizing your site for that browser and cut your
losses on the others. If many of your visitors don’t have the latest version of
Flash, remove those dazzling elements. Sometimes a site with less dazzle per-
forms better because it offers a friendlier user experience. Although many
Webmasters want to build sites with animated eye candy, creating a Web site
that converts visitors to customers should always be the priority.
By the same token, you can also use Web analytics to analyze the clickstream
(the recorded path, page by page, of the pages a visitor requested while navi-
gating through a Web site) and make the navigation through your site more
user-friendly. Certain navigational paths inevitably generate more conversions
than others. User-friendly sites offer a straight line between point A and point
B. In other words, don’t make your visitors take detours on their journey to
the point of conversion by throwing up untargeted advertisements, unneces-
sary registration forms, or other obstacles that might cause them to abandon
the transaction.

Make the Most of Online Marketing
Whether you are engaged in guerilla marketing — unconventional marketing
tactics designed to get maximum results from minimal resources — or you
spend a tidy sum on traditional online advertising tactics, Web analytics can
revolutionize your e-business by helping you make the most of it.
Your goal with online marketing campaigns is to see them generate more
money than they cost. Web analytics clarifies your Return on Marketing
Investment (ROMI). Before Web analytics, online advertisers figured about
half their efforts were paying off — they just weren’t sure which half. Web
analytics offers the ultimate accountability. If a certain campaign is sucking
your bank account dry, you can turn off the vacuum and reinvest in another
promotion.
Web analytics is revolutionary because it offers a crystal clear window into
what works and what doesn’t with greater accuracy than you could ever
dream of with offline advertising measurements. What’s more, online Web
analytics can add value to your offline marketing efforts. All you have to do 
is use a simple but unique URL in the ad that is used only for a particular
campaign.
If you want to measure the effect of magazine ads that sell your new online-
only special travel packages, simply create a special URL for that campaign
and track the responses by using your handy-dandy Web analytics program
to measure traffic, unique visitors, length of stay and, ultimately, conver-
sions. You can take it a step further by comparing that magazine ad with key-
word campaigns by linking your paid search or pay per click (PPC) ad traffic
(visitors who are drawn to the site through search engine listings that you
pay for) to a different URL with the same promotion. It doesn’t take a brain
surgeon to cut into the comparison and extract the data that matters.
Save Money on Paid Search Campaigns
PPC is all the rage because it drives targeted traffic to your Web site. The
quest to discover which words are driving traffic, which words are driving
conversion, and which words are plain ol’ duds has shed new light on Web
analytics in recent years.
317
Chapter 18: Ten Reasons Why Web Analytics Will Revolutionize E-Business

The first order of business is to stop wasting money. One key to efficient PPC
campaigns is to first understand which keywords and keyphrases are already
driving organic search traffic to your site (and which ones are driving conver-
sions). Organic search retrieves results by indexing pages based on content
and keyword relevancy. If you pay for search terms that don’t historically
lead to conversions, you’re throwing good money after poor keywords.
The second order of business is to start saving money. PPC depends on spon-
sored links displayed in a shaded box above the organic search results, or in
a column to the right. Doubtless, PPC campaigns drive traffic and often con-
vert to customers. However, searchers know that you paid for this placement
and might choose to give more credibility to listings in the organic search
box. Unless your PPC campaign is highly targeted and hits the bull’s-eye, it
will either be ignored, or it will waste your money because the visitors click
the link — and you will pay for that — before realizing that your site doesn’t
have what they are looking for.
This second order is one big reason why so much focus is being put on
search engine optimization (SEO), which is tweaking your current Web pages
and creating new Web pages in hopes of getting ranked higher in the search
engines. For a fraction of the cost, you can rely on this technique to produce
unpaid search rankings that drive qualified leads to your site. For many Web
site owners, this might prove to be a better long-term investment than PPC.
Google launched Google Sitemaps service in mid-2005 to help Web site owners
keep their content current in its search engine index. Google won’t admit that
its sitemap — pages that link to all the other pages on the Web site — has any
effect on your page rank, but ensuring that all your pages appear in Google’s
index with a properly formatted sitemap certainly can’t hurt. Visit here for
more information about this program:
www.google.com/webmasters/sitemaps
Online tools like XML-Sitemaps.com that let Web site owners create a Google
site map for free have sprung up in response to the Google Sitemaps offering.
However, Webmasters have been creating HTML sitemaps for years. If you are
wondering why you should bother, consider this: These sitemaps enable
search engine spiders to find pages — even the ones linked deep into your
site that may otherwise go unnoticed — more quickly.
Cross-Sell and Up-Sell Your Customers
Web analytics is revolutionizing e-business because it identifies ways to opti-
mize your merchandising schemes. Think of a grocery store. There may not
318
Part V: The Part of Tens 

be a rhyme, but there is a good reason why retailers choose to combine food
types on the same aisle. Dozens of varieties of bread are displayed right next
to the peanut butter. On that same aisle, you are likely to find cereal, break-
fast bars, grits, and oatmeal. You might even find coffee, tea, creamers, artifi-
cial sweeteners, and other things that lend themselves to breakfast fare.
The grocery store gurus know that if you are buying bread, you might also be
in the market for peanut butter. If you are buying grits, you might also have a
craving for toast and jelly. Of course, what breakfast would be complete with-
out coffee? You could certainly argue that bread might be better positioned
next to the deli, and you’d be right. That’s why grocery stores stock French
bread, pumpernickel, and other varieties there. But they also stock pickles,
specialty mustards, and other condiments — sandwich-y accoutrements. Are
you beginning to get the picture?
Grocery stores cross-sell — sell related products or services over and above
the original intended purpose — and up-sell — sell customers a higher-priced
version of the product they intended to purchase. That’s why it’s so difficult
to get out of the grocery store with just those five items on your list.
Web analytics offers insight into how to optimize your merchandizing efforts
on product pages. With this data in hand, you can determine which products
people purchase together. The trends you uncover might surprise you. After
you discover that visitors who bought a sweater also purchased a scarf, you
can make changes to your site so that the scarves and sweaters are displayed
on the same page. If you have a content site, you can analyze what content
departments readers flow between the most. If most of them jump from news
directly to sports, it behooves you to make sure your navigation makes it as
easy as possible for them to get from one place to another.
Realize Real-Time Opportunities
From instant grits to instant messaging, the whole world wants what they
want — and now. Web analytics can revolutionize your e-business by offering
opportunities to dissect revenue-generating data in real-time and avoid costly
mistakes. Think of it as on-demand actionable data available second by
second, as it happens.
Sophisticated programs show you in the here and now where your most 
profitable customers are coming from. You can immediately glean what con-
tent or product pages they are flocking to at any given moment and make
changes to your pages on the fly to accommodate daily trends. You will know
right away which of your banner ads and keywords promotions are paying
319
Chapter 18: Ten Reasons Why Web Analytics Will Revolutionize E-Business

dividends so you can decide whether to add more dollars to a particular cam-
paign budget or shut down the promotion for the day.
Imagine if your landing page was throwing an error that was hurting sales of
your best-selling product. Real-time Web analytics lets you fix site errors as
soon as they occur. Real-time analytics also helps you detect and deter click
fraud, which fraud occurs when someone purposely clicks your PPC ad list-
ings with no intention to buy from you.
Combating Controversial Click Fraud
There’s been plenty of technology news headlines — as well as at least a
couple of lawsuits — over the click fraud issue. The clicks can be generated
using by hitbots or clickbots, which are programs that automatically click PPC
ads or manually click the link over and over again.
Here are two clear motives for this scam, depending on who is committing 
it. One, a competitor might click your PPC ads repeatedly to exhaust your
advertising budget so that he can benefit from the traffic. Or, it could be an
affiliate marketer clicking-through on links from his site to drum up revenue.
Web analytics is revolutionizing e-business by combating controversial click
fraud. A variety of indicators can give you a heads-up on suspicious activity
in your PPC campaign. If you see an increased number of clicks from coun-
tries like Romania (.cn) or India (.in), you might be the target of click fraud.
If you see repeat visitors from the same IP address, you might be the target of
click fraud. Other suspicious signs are one-page visitors, clicks at unusual
hours, visitors who do not accept cookies, and short time-spans on site. Of
course, any of these metrics could be legitimate. In combination, though,
they could be costly.
Closing the Delayed Conversion Loop
Here’s a nagging question in the back of the minds of many entrepreneurs
who have both a brick-and-mortar presence and an online channel: How do
you tell whether the customer did research online before shopping in the
store? The same question holds true for lead generators: Did they learn about
your services online before picking up the phone? Web analytics can revolu-
tionize your e-business by tracking what some have called delayed conver-
sions. Just like it sounds, delayed conversions are conversions that start
online but close offline.
320
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Without understanding the concept of delayed conversions, you might get
the idea that that high-cost traffic you’ve been paying for is a waste and thus
stop marketing just at the brink of financial breakthrough. Likewise, with 
no knowledge of how many of your customers actually began the product 
or service education process online, you might change navigational paths,
rearrange graphical elements, or even undergo an entire site design — all
unnecessarily. You’ve heard the old adage, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” Well,
remaining ignorant to delayed conversions could cause you to break some-
thing that is working quite well.
The good news is that you can close the delayed conversion loop. Your Web
site can feature a unique toll-free number so that any calls (and sales) coming
through that number are sure to have come as the result of Web research.
Another popular method involves creating special promotional codes that
are available only on the Web site, and then tracking how many of them close.
With a little help from a knowledgeable Web programmer, those promotional
codes can be tracked back to their online referral source, revealing the qual-
ity of the leads coming to your site through various means, whether PPC,
organic search, link exchanges, banner ads, or some other promotional 
activity.
Now you can focus your efforts on the sources that offer the most conver-
sions: immediate or delayed. You can also determine how the quality of the
leads generated through your Web site compare with the quality of the leads
generated by any one of the other offline marketing methods you are using.
You can even compare the length of time it takes for an online generated lead
with the time it takes a Yellow Page ad to convert. Getting the whole story
might take a few months, but it’s worth listening to.
Optimize Self-Support Functions
If making money while you sleep is a dream come true, not having to answer
support calls the rest of the time is the ultimate fantasy. Indeed, customer
self-service is the Holy Grail of Internet business. Maintaining a large call
center is such a costly task.
The Internet has inspired all sorts of innovative technologies designed to 
do away with traditional customer support functions, such as FAQs, search-
able Q&A databases, and customer chat boards. Unfortunately, many dreams
turned into nightmares after companies poured big money into customer 
self-service sites that failed to reduce traditional support call volumes. The
bottom line with customer self-service is this: If the user can’t find the
answers he needs online, he’ll pick up the phone and give you a call.
321
Chapter 18: Ten Reasons Why Web Analytics Will Revolutionize E-Business

Web analytics can revolutionize e-business by offering key insights into why
users weren’t able to find the answers they were looking for. Web analytics
identifies where the process broke down. Did your internal site search func-
tion fail to yield relevant results? Or did the answer itself fail to satisfy the
customer’s curiosity? Could it be possible that the answer was not to be
found at all?
There are countless reasons why self-support functions fail, but proper use of
Web analytics helps you understand where the breakdowns occur so that you
can build a bridge to true self-support. Although the dream of eliminating call
centers entirely might not have been realistic from the beginning, it certainly
is possible to significantly reduce the number of support calls your team has
to field by using Web analytics to fine tune your online support functions.
Increase Results from E-Mail Campaigns
According to JupiterResearch, Web analytics can make a dramatic effect on
targeted e-mail campaigns. According to a Jupiter study, using Web analytics
to target e-mail campaigns can produce 9 times the revenues and 18 times the
profits of broadcast mailings. (Yes, we said 18 times the profits.)
David Daniels, a research director for the New York–based research firm, says
the study proves that spam and the cluttered inbox have not killed the e-mail
medium for marketers. A clear messaging strategy that is built off a lifecycle
relationship-driven approach still offers tremendous value.
However, as Jupiter noted, few marketers are sending highly contextually 
targeted e-mail campaigns. Most are using broadcast and basic personaliza-
tion tactics that do little to make these marketing messages highly relevant.
According to Daniels, the failure of Customer Relationship Management
(CRM) systems to centralize all customer insights haunts e-mail marketing;
and, in many respects, relegates it to a second-class medium. Because the
lack of integrated customer data is the top challenge for large marketers, he
adds, these data deficiencies bind many of them to relatively simplistic tar-
geting tactics.
Here’s how Web analytics will revolutionize e-mail campaigns: by using click-
stream data. With clickstream data, targeted e-mail campaigns on average
produced open rates of 33 percent, click-through rates of 14 percent, and
conversion rates of 3.9 percent, Jupiter revealed. That compares with aver-
age open rates of 20 percent, click-through rates of 0.5 percent, and conver-
sion rates of 1.1 percent for mass mailings.
322
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Better results come at higher costs. There is much more labor involved in
applying Web analytics to track e-mail campaigns. According to Jupiter, the
average total salary budgets for campaigns using clickstream targeting are 2.5
times higher than those of marketers using mass-mailing campaigns. The
average cost per message totals $4.50, excluding Web analytics costs, com-
pared with $3 for untargeted mailings. Overall, Jupiter concluded that the
additional costs were worthwhile, pointing to e-tailer Newport-News.com and
its six-fold improvement in revenue after using Web analytics to target
browsers of three of its worst-performing product categories.
Predict the Future Here and Now
There is no such thing as a crystal ball in the world of Web analytics, but
there are predictive analytics, which can revolutionize your e-business.
Predictive analytics is a type of data mining that focuses on predicting future
possibilities and trends. Predictive analytics vendor SSPS (www.spss.com)
translates it this way: Predictive analytics ensures that the actions you take
today will directly achieve your organization’s goals tomorrow.
Predictive analytics works on the premise that there are scores of critical
decisions to make at any given moment. Any one of those decisions could
impact your ability to convert visitors into profitable customers, members,
or readers. Predictive analytics analyzes the mountains of behind-the-scenes
Web site data, combines information on past circumstances, present events
and projected future actions, and then automates the decision-making process.
Predictive analytics can lead to greater cross-selling, lower marketing costs,
reduced click fraud, or increased PPC response rates. Sure, you can gain
those advantages by analyzing the data yourself and taking an educated
guess, but the beauty of predictive analytics is that it does the heavy lifting
for you. This software can predict product preferences and purchasing habits
and create relevant marketing messages and target marketing at its best. It’s
fact-based decision making plain and simple. It’s revolutionary because it
automates the process so you won’t risk drowning in an ocean of statistics.
According to analyst firm IDC (www.idc.com), “Predictive analytic projects
yield a median ROI of 145 percent.” Of course, the cost of predictive analytics
is probably out of reach for most entrepreneurs today, but the good news is
that just like other technologies, the prices will eventually come down. When
they do, predictive analytics could make one of the biggest impacts on e-busi-
ness since e-business was birthed. Predictive analytics goes beyond telling
you what happened on your Web site last month to what is likely to happen
next quarter.

Ten Web Analytics Best Practices
In This Chapter
 Five ways to tie your data into your business objectives.
 Five metrics that deserve extra special attention.
W
eb analytics makes a promise to its users — to capture mountains of
data about customer behavior — and the technology never breaks its
promise. However, the data is only as good as the person interpreting it.
The good news is that you don’t have to figure out the best way to take action
on the data you’ve gathered in a vacuum. Web analytics is a young industry,
but it’s old enough to have an industry association, a cadre of experts, and
some established best practices. You can implement those best practices to
get the best possible results from your Web optimization initiatives. In fact,
one of the leading Web analytics providers, Omniture (www.omniture.com),
launched the industry’s first Web analytics best practices group in 2004. The
group offers services and methodologies designed to address and drive
online marketing return on investment (ROI), ranging from strategic planning
and rapid implementations to enterprise marketing optimization.
If you’re wondering just how important best practices are, consider what
market research firm Gartner’s (www.gartner.com) Principal Analyst Bill
Gassman said: “As companies acquire or reevaluate a Web analytics solution,
many are finding that they don’t have the internal skills and resources to
quickly and effectively implement online marketing and merchandising
strategies. Yet, that expertise is important for maximizing the success of their
strategies. The companies that incorporate Web analytic tools in recurring
cross-organizational processes, not just occasional projects, will see the high-
est returns from their Web channel investments. To achieve better results,
more quickly and effectively, companies should consider using external
expertise to learn about best practices and principles.”

Trust us: We’re all for getting external expertise when needed. But if you
implement the ten best practices we cite in this chapter, you’ll be well on
your way to becoming an expert yourself.
Define Metrics That Matter
Web analytics can generate mind-boggling amounts of data. Even simple pro-
grams offer enough metrics to keep you busy staying in tune with keywords
that work and site referrers that succeed in driving traffic for days on end.
And the pages and pages of reports that sophisticated programs have to offer
could intimidate even the most daring number crunchers.
Whether you use the freebie software or the most expensive enterprise-class
technology on the market, your ability to make decisions boils down to mea-
suring the data that matters. After all, you need more than information: You
need interpretations that offer actionable insights. Actionable insights are
found in the realm of key performance indicators (KPIs), which illustrate how
well the site is performing against goals. You can read much more about KPIs
in Chapter 11.
Here’s where many novice Web analytics interpreters miss it: They don’t 
connect the KPIs to clear business goals. Failing to make that critical connec-
tion is like starting on a long journey with no map and no address through
the countryside to visit grandma’s new house. You might see some pretty
scenery along the way, but you won’t know which way to go or whether
you’ve arrived. In other words, you’ll waste a lot of time and money and 
probably end up frustrated to boot.
Some people go online for fun, and others go online for money. Either way,
Web analytics works best when it’s tied to your goals. The funster may just
want to build a community of friends. The entrepreneur has monetary motives
in mind. Ask yourself the following questions to outline your business 
objectives:
 Is my goal to drive online sales?
 Is my goal to generate traffic so I can win advertisers’ hearts?
 Is my goal to generate qualified sales leads for my services?
 Is my goal to streamline customer service so customers can find fast
answers or even engage in total self-service?
 How will I know when I’ve accomplished my goals?
The answers to these questions will help you define the metrics that matter.
Then you can monitor only your most vital KPIs.
326
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Monitor Only Your Vital KPIs
There are scads — and scads and scads — of KPIs you could monitor. If you
are like most time-strapped entrepreneurs, the majority of these metrics will
never even become a blip on your radar screen. Realistically, the choice
between combing through every last possible metric your Web analytics soft-
ware offers or keeping up with the PPC campaigns that are generating paying
customers is no choice at all.
Your goal is to monitor the most vital KPIs. Think of yourself as an emergency
medic. These harried healthcare professionals check a patient’s vital signs —
the blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, and so on. What we are saying is
this: If you have time to monitor many different KPIs, go ahead. But if you’re
like most Web site owners, you are better off identifying the most vital KPIs to
keep your finger on the pulse on the health of your Web site.
 If your goal is to drive online sales, you’ll want to pay attention to KPIs
that illustrate revenue, orders, profit, conversion rates, revenue per
visit, profit per visit, and average order.
 If you’re an online content portal whose goal is to generate traffic so you
can win advertisers’ hearts, you need to concentrate on KPIs like the
average pageview per visit, the percent of returning visitors, conversion
rate through subscriptions, registrations, log ins, cancellations, and
overall pageviews (a record of each time a visitor views a Web page on
your site).
 For lead generators who seek qualified prospects, you need to focus on
KPIs that highlight leads, cost per lead, conversion rate, newsletter sign-
ups, partner referrals, registrations, demo quotes, price quotes, or mate-
rials download. You’ll also need to keep a close eye on KPIs such as Web
inquiries per visit, call center volume, and support inquiries if you hope
to measure how effective your online customer support efforts are.
These best practices save you time by getting down to the bottom line in a
hurry. You can read much more about KPIs in Chapter 11.
Segment Your Visitors’ Behavior
If you’ve boned up on your Web analytics vocabulary, you know that segmen-
tation is the grouping of customers based on visitor behavior. Some people call
these groups clusters. Still others call them customer segments, visitor labeling,
or visitor profiling. Web analytics vendor WebTrends (www.webtrends.com)
characterizes this tactic as a “powerful aspect of relationship marketing in
327
Chapter 19: Ten Web Analytics Best Practices

which you target sub-sections or groups of customers who share a specific
trait or set of behaviors.”
Don’t worry too much about what to call this tactic — just do it. Visitor seg-
mentation has been used in the offline world for decades to increase customer
retention and increase top line sales. Several, but not all, Web analytics appli-
cations make it oh-so-easy to implement this strategy online. (So be sure to
ask about this feature before you plunk down your dollars.) You can segment
your visitors by where they came from before they entered your site, by par-
ticular actions such as downloading a white paper, by what page they landed
on inside your site, and more. The possibilities are virtually endless.
After you segregate your visitors into nice and neat categories, you can take 
a closer look at the activity of users in that segment, such as time spent on
site and conversion rates. You might find that visitors who download a white
paper from your site are twice as likely to become customers as those who
don’t. You might find that visitors who came to your site through a Google
search behaved quite differently than visitors who came to your site through
Yahoo!, MSN, or some niche search engine.
Check out these telling metrics to examine to determine which user groups
are helping you pay the bills:
 Which group of visitors was most likely to convert?
 What content did they view?
 What promotional campaigns did they respond to?
 Are they return or first-time visitors?
 Do members of that group spend longer on your site than other segments?
Armed with this information, you can target these segments with special
campaigns or make changes to the site based on perceived user preferences.
Know Your Navigation Report
Until the World Wide Web became mainstream, navigation reports were
reserved for Christopher Columbus types who used them to avoid winding
up on a deserted island where headhunters lay in wait of fresh trophies.
Okay, so you won’t shipwreck if you ignore your online navigation report, but
you might very well miss out on some buried statistical treasure.
328
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Also known as a clickstream, a navigation report reveals the order in which
your visitors click through your Web site and how long they stay on each
page. The report also shows at a glance the percentage of visitors who clicked
each link as well as where those visitors came from, such as a search engine
or a link partner. Reviewing this report can offer insights into which prod-
ucts, content, or other pages were most interesting to any given customer.
The navigation report, then, helps you determine which pages are the most
popular. You can also calculate the return on investment on your pay per
click (PPC) budget by comparing the traffic volumes that each search engine
sent to a particular page. Maybe you’re a bookstore trying to drive traffic to a
landing page that features all your releases. The navigation report tells you in
no uncertain terms whether your keywords and keyphrases generated traffic
or whether you should go back to the drawing board. This same report
shows you whether that clickstream flows through to the shopping cart and a
sale was completed.
As you review your navigation report, put on your customer-colored glasses.
You want to see a smooth flow through your site from one section to the
next. It should be logical. If your navigation report shows that visitors are
rapid-fire clicking through the pages on your site, perhaps the navigational
elements of your site need some fine-tuning. Maybe your site hierarchy
makes sense to you but confuses visitors. And confused visitors can be diffi-
cult to convert into paying customers.
Keep Up With Keyword Campaigns
With the potentially high cost of PPC campaigns, you’d be a fool not to use
your Web analytics tools to provide additional insight into your PPC advertis-
ing. Also called paid search, this method retrieves search listings based on
who paid the most money for keywords to appear at the top of the heap.
First, failing to track which keyphrases drive paying customers to your site
could leave you with loads of traffic but no sales. If you are serious about
paid search as a business-building strategy, you need to know what works —
and what doesn’t.
Second, you should track which PPC vendors provide the best value. Don’t
fall into the trap of the low-priced keywords that some PPC vendors offer. It
doesn’t matter whether you can buy traffic for a penny per click if none of
that traffic converts. Use visitor segmentation to group your visitors by PPC
vendor and compare the results to weed out the poor performers.
329
Chapter 19: Ten Web Analytics Best Practices

Some Web analytics programs, like ClickTracks (www.clicktracks.com),
offer a campaign report. This eliminates some of the heavy data digging by
showing you metrics such as how many users spent less than five seconds on
the site. If they spent less than five seconds on the site, they saw nothing of
interest and moved on. This report also offers an ROAS, or return on advertis-
ing spend, which is a ratio between the cost of a campaign and the revenue
that it generates.
Third, watch your PPC search terms. With the introduction of advanced
matching — displaying your PPC ads for keywords that are similar or related
to the keywords you bid on — some advertisers are surprised to learn that
they are paying for traffic that isn’t helping their Web site goals.
To illustrate this point, pretend you want to sell bricks online. Yes, they are
heavy, and the shipping costs are prohibitive (to put it politely). (We’ve seen
worse ideas.) You launch PPC advertising campaign on several of the most
popular search engines. You bid on the term, or keyword, brick. Because you
sell many different colors, shapes, and sizes of bricks, you get a bright idea:
Turn on advanced matching in case people search for bricks, yellow bricks, or
circular bricks.
That might have seemed like a bright idea at the time, but your keyword
reports belie your brains. Your Web analytics data show that you are also
paying for visitors searching for free bricks, brick making, ceramic bricks,
and other terms that you end up paying for through the nose. The problem is
you don’t sell any of those items — and you don’t give them away for free,
either. So the visitors comes to your site sand probably see nothing of value.
The takeaway: Advanced matching can be a good thing, or it can bankrupt
your ad campaign in a flash. If you decide to experiment with this feature,
keep a constant eye on your Web analytics to make sure you aren’t wasting
money on unrelated common words that people use in conjunction with your
keywords of choice. Most search engines let you set negative matches on your
PPC campaigns. With these, you could specifically exclude the words that are
irrelevant to your potential visitors (like free, making, and ceramic in the pre-
ceding example) and save a bundle o’ cash.
Optimize Your Landing Pages
On the World Wide Web, Home Sweet Home is not the name of the revenue
game. What we mean by that is most of your traffic might not land on your
home page. So although we recommend that you make your home page user-
friendly and visually appealing, don’t stop there. Every other page on your
site should be just as pretty and easy to navigate as the home page.
330
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t take our word for it. See for yourself. On your Web analytics report, you
will notice that many users enter your site from pages other than the home
page. Although in most cases, the home page is indeed the single most popu-
lar page on a site, you might find that most of your search traffic doesn’t
come directly to your home page. When it comes to Net surfers searching for
information, most of them will land somewhere within the confines of the
site. Consider each of those “somewheres” a landing page.
With only so many hours in the day, focusing too much energy on your home
page could leave you with ineffective landing pages — the very pages where
you display your products or make a pitch for your services. If you spend
money on PPC campaigns that send visitors to your product pages, concen-
trating on landing pages makes even more sense.
 Test different headlines.
 Test different call to action sizes and placements.
 Test different product images.
 Test different copy lengths.
 Test various special offers.
 Try adding reviews and testimonials.
Calculate Visitor Conversion
Much has been said about conversion rates, and much more will be said in
the future. In fact, we’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Converting visi-
tors into customers (or qualified leads, subscribers, and so on) is the overar-
ching purpose of most Web sites today. Sure, if you are merely blogging for
fun or posting an old-fashioned online billboard for your company, calculat-
ing the conversion rate may not be on your Top 10 list of best practices. But
for the vast majority of Web site owners, conversions are critical.
Your conversion rate is the percentage of visitors who complete a desired
action. That could be buying a shirt, filling out a form, subscribing to a
newsletter, or some other target activity. If your goal is to get people to fill
out a form so you can build a mailing list, the conversion rate is the number
visitors who fill out the form divided by your total number of visitors. If you
are selling a shirt, your conversion rate is the total number of transactions
divided by your total number of visitors. For a more in-depth look at conver-
sion rates read Chapter 11 for the lowdown on understanding KPIs.
331
Chapter 19: Ten Web Analytics Best Practices

Don’t worry about someone else’s numbers. An outstanding conversion rate
for one site might be a poor conversion rate for another. Just benchmark
where you are at and compare the rates from week to week as you make
changes to your site. If you still want to know some general rule, try this: If
your conversion rate is less than one percent, your site could use some
improvement. Your priority should be to invest time and energy into making
site improvements.
Save Your Historical Data
Looking back at your traffic numbers from when you first launched your Web
site five years ago can be fun — and even quite funny. Surely, your traffic has
grown exponentially, and you have much more data to dissect today than you
did way back when. Reviewing your early metrics is more than a stroll down
Memory Lane, though — it’s smart business because your historical data
could hold keys to Web analytics success.
True, how your Web site performs today is what matters most. However, it’s
also absolutely true that looking back to last year’s data — or even data from
two, three, or five years ago — can illustrate trends, for better or worse. In
fact, this historical perspective might be the only way to fully comprehend
how serious those slightly downward trends in your KPIs really are.
Maybe you’ve been losing a fraction of a second in the average time spent on
site each week for the past two years. Your monthly reports don’t offer much
cause for concern, adding the effects of that downward trend it over a year or
two can send you reaching for the aspirin bottle and your Web designer’s
phone number.
By contrast, perhaps you’ve seen a net gain in a critical KPI, such as your con-
version rate per repeat visitor. In that case, you should be celebrating instead
of messing with the design too much. The point is this: Sometimes the only
way to truly determine how well your site is performing is to put the data
into historical context. For more reading on this topic, turn to Chapter 12.
Make Changes Gradually
Knowledge might indeed be power, but you have to use that power to make
an effect. As you begin to put the power of behind-the-scenes visitor behavior
in action, be sure to take it one step at a time. Say your traffic is anemic, your
332
Part V: The Part of Tens 

average time per visit is a split second, and your conversion rate is, well, non-
existent. What’s a Web site entrepreneur to do?
You might be tempted to do an entire site redesign — and in some cases, that’s
not a bad idea. Or maybe you just launched a site redesign, complete with
eye-pleasing graphics, award-winning copywriting, and plenty of high-tech
bells and whistles, but your metrics are worse than ever. You have little idea
what you did to make it worse and probably no idea how to make it better.
No matter whether you are in dire straits or just want to get more from a site
that is already performing well, your best practice is to start where you are
and make changes gradually. With each set of changes, monitor your KPIs to
see how your fiddling affected your site’s vital signs over the course of a
month. If the changes helped, hold steady. If they made matters worse, revert
to the original game plan and set out to test another set of changes.
You could make all sorts of changes to your site that could pay dividends.
The most important conceptual changes include the following:
 Make sure your visitors know what you’re selling.
 Make sure your Web site is communicating your unique value proposi-
tion, or what makes your service/product/offering better than your 
competition.
 Build trust and credibility through testimonials, certifications, awards,
and so on.
Commit to Continual Improvement
Your Web site is running like Michael Johnson in the 2000 Olympic Games —
fast, furious, and profitably. Watch out! A busy schedule might lure you into a
state of complacency, and your competitor could catch a second wind, come
from behind, and steal the winner’s wreath from right off your head. Instead
of staring proudly at that gold medal in the trophy case, get back on the Web
analytics track and try to break your own world’s record for most unique visi-
tors in a month, longest average time on site, or some other vital KPI that will
boost your online success.
Web analytics is more than just a measurement tool; rather, it’s an ongoing
process of driving value from your Web site. Committing to continual improve-
ment means measuring the effect of every change you make to the Web site.
It means analyzing the performance of every new product, service, or content
333
Chapter 19: Ten Web Analytics Best Practices

you add. Likewise, it means looking for areas where your KPIs are dropping
off and also digging through the data to find out why.
Committing to continual improvement does not mean making changes to
your Web site just for the sake of making changes to your Web site. Any time
you enact a design change, remove content, add features, or make any other
change — no matter how big or small — you should have a good reason. You
should also forecast the anticipated impact of those changes. Are you moving
the Subscribe Now button because the response has been poor? Then you
would naturally expect that its new location should produce a greater con-
version rate. Any and all changes you make should be in line with your busi-
ness goals, and their effects should be measured.
