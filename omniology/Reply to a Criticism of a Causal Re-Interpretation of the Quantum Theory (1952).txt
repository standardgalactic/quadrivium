The experiments
were put aside at that time owing to the press
of other work and approximately
a year later they were again
investigated
with the help of a scintillation
counter. In the present
work two sets of experiments
were performed.
In the first set of experiments,
in order to get a good calibration
point for this low energy radiation,
the low energy radiations
from
Tl"' were compared
with
those of Os"', a known E-capturer. ''
By using the line produced
by Os'" (I|.~ of Re) as a calibration
point, the radiation
from TP04 had an energy of 68 kev.
In a second
set of experiments,
the photon
radiations
from
TP 4 were compared directly with those from TP'0, which is known
to decay to Hg"' by electron capture. 4 The results of these experi-
ments,
taken
with a scintillation
counter
are shown
in Fig. 1.
It will be seen that the peak of the curve, owing to the E
x-rays
of Hg from TP00, falls at exactly the same place as that of the
photons from TP".
From the above
experiments,
it is to be concluded
that
the
photons
from TP0' are the E& x-rays of Hg and that TP'4 decays
to Hg"' by E-electron capture.
While these experiments
were in
progress, a similar conclusion
was obtained
by Lidofsky, Macklin,
and Wu.'

constants
in the sense of the
Hamilton-Jacobi
theory, since they will in general also be present
in the "quantum
potentiaV'

by R and its derivatives.
There does not seem to exist a general formulation
by which (2a)
and (2b) can be satisfied
and S still be made to contain f (non-
additive)
integration
constants
that are not present
in R. Until
a way to find these integration
constants
has been devised,
the
similarity
with the Hamilton-Jacobi
theory
is purely
extraneous,
and
one cannot
talk about
a mechanical
interpretation
of the
wave equation.
It may perhaps be kept in mind that the whole procedure
sug-
gested by Bohm is, even in its present
incomplete
form, strictly
limited
to nonrelativistic
quantum
mechanics
and
there
is no
indication
given
as to how it could possibly
be extended
to in-
clude
relativistic
(spin)
phenomena;
nor has an attempt
been
made in any of the examples
to analyze
the fundamental
rela-
tivistic questions
of observables
and their measurability. '
Keeping in mind these factors together
with the difhculties
in
the purely
mechanical
part of the interpretation,
one may feel
justified in concluding
-that no alternative
interpretation
of quan-
tum mechanics
has been ofFered.

N two recently
published
extensive
papers, ' Bohm has given
-- a full
discussion
of an
alternative
interpretation
of non-
relativistic
quantum
mechanics
proposed
by him. It is Bohm's
opinion
that
there
exists the possibihty
of looking
on nonrela-
tivistic quantum
mechanics
as a form of classical mechanics
in-
volving
special quantum
forces. While the bulk of the papers is
devoted
to various
applications
of this
view,
the fundamental
point is contained
in a few remarks
concerning
the solution
of
Schrodinger's
equation, at the beginning
of Bohm's first note.
Writing, as customarily,
@=R(x, y, r, t) exp{iS/A)
(R, S real),
the Schrodinger
equation
is split into two equations:
(BR/8t}+(1/2m) (M,S+2 gradR
gradS),
(2a)
(85/8l)+(1/2m) (gradS)~+ V(x, y, g, t}——
.
(2b)
km (gradR}2
2m
R
Equation
(2b) is looked upon as the Hamilton-Jacobi
equation
of
the quantum-mechanical
problem,
in which
the terms containing
R and its derivatives
are a sort of quantum
potential
energy. Since
it is necessary to satisfy also (2a), Bohm simply
suggests
the use
of an arbitrary
solution P of the Schrodinger
equation. One is then
certain that both (2a) and (2b) will be satisfied.
We do not want to enter here into a discussion of the individual
cases treated
by Bohm. It is the thesis of the present letter that
so far no possibility
of a mechanical
interpretation
has been
demonstrated.
To obtain the solution
of a mechanical
problem, it is necessary
to have a solution S which
depends
on the coordinates
of the
system,
the physical
parameters
entering
into the expression
for
kinetic and potential
energy
and f nonadditive
integration
con-
stants. Bohm has failed to show that such a function can be found. '
It is, of course,
true that,

to the infinite
number
of
eigenstates,

as one wishes can be introduced

'N a letter' criticizing a causal re-interpretation
of the quantum
theory proposed by the author/
Halpern
comes to the conclu-
sion that "no alternative
interpretation
of the quantum
theory
has been offered. "In the present letter, the author wishes to dis-
cuss in some detail the arguments
by which Halpern
is led to this
conclusion.
Halpern's
first objection
is that
because
the function,
S(x),
appearing
in paper I, Eq. (6), does not depend
on f nonadditive
integration
constants,
one has not yet obtained a solution of the
mechanical
problem. It was stated in paper I, Sec. 4, however,
that
the Hamilton-Jacobi
theory
was being
used
only for the
purpose
of indicating
in a simple way how one might arrive at a
causal interpretation
of the quantum
theory;
while
the theory
itself was to be based directly on the equations oi motion [paper I,
Eq. (Sa)J:
rN(g'x/d»= —V~ V(x)+ V{x}},
where V{x) is the classical potential,
and U(x) is the "quantum-
potential. '" Now, the solution of these equations
by the Hamilton-
Jacobi technique
would
certainly
require
the f nonadditive
inte-
gration constants referred to by Halpern,
but the author. intended
to employ another
method of solution in his papers; namely, that
of guessing a function and verifying it by direct substitution
in the
differential
equations.
Since the treatment
given in the papers
is
perhaps
not completely
explicit, it may be useful to amplify
it
here. Guided by the Hamilton-Jacobi
theory, we guess tentatively
that if the momentum
were equal to y= VS(x},this function would
satisfy the equations
of motion. Now,
Cy/Ch =By/Bt+
(v ~ 'y)y= 8(yS)/et+%(yS)'/2ra.
But since S is defined as the phase of the wave function,
we have
(paper I, Eq. (6))
es/8$ =—(yS)'/2m —V—U,
Cy/Ch =—V'( V+ U).

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Thus, we verify that a particle
traveling
with velocity v= VS/m
will satisfy our equations
of motion. ' This means that the condi-
tion p=V'S(x) is a consistent
subsidiary
condition. It was then
pointed
out in paper I, Secs. 4 and 9 that if we assumed
this sub-
sidiary condition to be satisfied initially,
we would be able to ob-
tain a mechanical
explanation
of the
results
of the
quantum
theory; if not, we obtained a wider theory. Since it was shown to
be possible to choose this wider theory
in such a way that y ap-
proached
V'S(x) at the atomic
level,
but
differed
significantly
from it at the level of 10 "cm, it was concluded
that the wider
theory
might
be needed
in the domain
of very
small
distances,
where present
theories seem to be inadequate.
Halpern
then objected that the suggested
reinterpretation
was
not relativistic and did not deal with spin phenomena.
The author
has, however,
recently
developed
an extension
of the causal inter-
pretation
which
applies
to the Dirac relativistic
wave
equation
and therefore also takes care of spin phenomena.
This interpreta-
tion will soon be submitted
for publication.
As for Halpern's
statement
that no attempt
has yet been made
to analyze the question
of the measurability
of observables
from a
relativistic
point of view. the answer
is, of course, that this will
now be done with the aid of the causal interpretation
of Dirac's
relativistic
wave equation.
It is therefore
the author's
feeling that his previous
articles' do
in fact present a causal reinterpretation
of quantum
mechanics.

on. the de-
tection
of two charged
decay
fragments
which
in many
cases are probably
a proton
and a negative
pion. ' ' Accordingly,
the tentative
decay scheme
where E, q, Eo, qo are the total energies and momenta
of the pion
and neutral particle respectively
considered to be functions
of the
pion kinetic energy T with the restriction that E+Eo=Q+p+ po.
The distribution
in Q* is giveri in Fig. 1 for the cases of zero and
mesonic' neutral particle mass. The true energy release Q has been
adjusted
to give a most probable
value
for Q* of 35 Mev, to
correspond
approximately
to experiment.
The problem of coplanarity
can be treated similarly. If y' and q'
are the momenta
of the proton and pion in the laboratory
system,
then the angle
5 between
the plane of the charged particles
and
the true direction $/p of the Vs-particle is given by the expression
»»=(q'xp')
Il/(lq'xp'lfi).

This result can be simplified
if, in the numerator,
we substitute
p'=Po' —q' —qo', where
Po' is the momentum
of the U'-particle.
In the denominator,
we make use of the fact that for the decay
of a rapidly
moving
V'-particle,
the velocity and direction
of the
decay proton are essentially
the same as for the Vo-particle, so that
