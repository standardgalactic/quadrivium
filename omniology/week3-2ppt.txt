Two Types of Lower Motor Neurons  
ALPHA MOTOR NEURONS innervate 
extrafusal muscle fibers to generate 
force for posture & movement.  
        
GAMMA MOTOR NEURONS 
innervate intrafusal muscle fibers 
(muscle spindle). Shortening of the 
muscle spindle concurrent with 
shortening of the extrafusal muscle 
fibers enables continuous feedback 
via afferent sensory neurons to the 
spinal cord. The muscle spindle is 
critical for monitoring the length of 
the muscle as it shortens.     
 
Alpha and gamma motor neurons 
are efferent fibers which are 
coactivated to finely regulate the 
intensity of muscle contraction.

The afferent neuron coiled 
around the muscle spindle 
senses stretch (muscle 
length & speed of stretch). It 
acts in reciprocal 
innervation causing 
contraction of stretched 
muscle and relaxation of 
antagonistic muscle.  
 
The gamma motor neurons, 
muscle spindle, and sensory 
neuron act as part of a 
negative feedback loop to 
maintain muscle length at a 
desired value.

afferent neuron associated 
with Golgi tendon organ 
senses tension generated 
by muscle.  
 
Golgi tendon organs are 
encapsulated  
afferent nerve endings 
located at junction of muscle 
and tendon in series with the 
extrafusal fibers. Output from 
each Golgi tendon organ is 
sent via an afferent axon.  
 
Golgi tendon organs are 
activated by contraction of 
the muscle, NOT passive 
stretch. They act in a 
negative feedback to regulate 
tension.

Muscle Stretch Reflex - knee jerk reflex

The afferent neuron coiled around the muscle spindle senses 
stretch (muscle length & speed of stretch). It acts in reciprocal 
innervation causing contraction of stretched muscle and 
relaxation of antagonistic muscle.  

Golgi Tendon Reflex      
Limits tension within the muscle to protect muscle and muscle-tendon junction   
image by Rick Melges, Duke University 
Contraction of the flexor muscle of the arm 
pulls the Golgi tendon organ activating 
afferent neurons. It acts in reciprocal 
innervation causing relaxation of the 
contracted muscle and contraction of the 
antagonistic muscle.

     Reflex circuitry mediates withdrawal of limb from a painful sensory 
stimulus (flexor reflex).  Crossed extensor reflex provides postural 
support during withdrawal of affected limb.    
 
Pain input to spinal cord excites/inhibits reciprocal muscles on pained side of 
the body (causing withdrawal reflex) and on opposite side of the body to 
support body weight.

Central Pattern Generators 
CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATORS (CPG):   
Neural circuits produce timing and coordination of complex 
patterns of movement independent of sensory input and 
adjust them in response to sensory feedback.  
 
CPG Characterized by: 
   - Oscillatory 
   - Flexible due to control by brain (change from walking to 
running by reducing stance phase and sequence of limb 
movements in quadrupeds). 
 
Locomotion 
Forward flexion (swing phase) of a limb and then backward 
extension (stance phase) that is repeated 
Reciprocal innervation of limbs 

Specific sensory systems provide input to the motor system. 
Sensory receptors in muscle detect and regulate muscle 
length and velocity of shortening (spindle) as well as tension 
(Golgi tendon).  
 
Reflex actions are initiated when sensory information is sent 
from muscle, tendon or skin receptors to the spinal cord 
causing movement in the appropriate muscles.  
 
Walking movements are initiated by central pattern 
generators in the spinal cord. Interneurons coordinately drive 
antagonistic muscles in withdrawal and crossed-extensor 
reflexes and can be modified by sensory feedback.
