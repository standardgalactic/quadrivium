About the Authors
Mary Herczog is a second-generation California native and is 
married to Paula Tevis’s prom date. She writes for Frommer’s and
Wiley whenever she can, which is quite a bit (Frommer’s New
Orleans, Frommer’s Las Vegas, Las Vegas For Dummies, Los Angeles
For Dummies, and more!) and she is so happy she can do it in the
California sunshine. The rest of the time, Mary works for the film
industry, which is a very California thing to do.
Paula Tevis, also a second-generation Californian, was born and
raised in Santa Barbara, attended college in Los Angeles, and then
moved to her favorite city, where she could cheer for the San
Francisco Giants in peace. After an eclectic but blessedly brief
career that included stints in the computer and nonprofit sectors,
she and her California-bred husband produced a couple of lovely
children, and Paula happily relinquished the 9-to-5 world for the
24/7 one that parenting brings. Upon regaining consciousness, she
metamorphosed into a freelance writer, and over the years has
contributed articles and essays to Parenting and Family Fun maga-
zines, the San Francisco Chronicle, Citysearch.com, Frommer’s 
Las Vegas, and Frommer’s New Orleans. She is the author of 
San Francisco For Dummies, the Berlitz Vancouver Pocketguide, and
Frommer’s San Francisco with Kids. Paula currently lives with her
husband and their daughters in London, but reads the Chronicle
online daily.


Dedication
This book is dedicated to the memory of my brother, Peter Tevis.
Authors’ Acknowledgments
I wouldn’t write this book if I couldn’t write it with Paula Tevis.
Without Melissa Sherman Pearl, the San Diego and Laguna chap-
ters would have been skimpy, and Sims Brannon created the
Central Coast wine chapter. I am hugely grateful to both. Lisa
Derrick helped make sense of Los Angeles, and Rick Garman helps
me make sense of everything. California is the golden state
because I live here with Steve Hochman. 
— Mary Herczog
Many thanks to my coauthor, the truly amazing Mary Herczog.
Thanks, too, to the wonderful people who assisted me in one way
or another as I made my way through the best half of California:
Bev Chin, Patience Tevis, Prudence and Steve Handelman, Nick
Cann and Peggy Blair, Andrea and Jeff Tobias, Irene Levin Dietz, Ina
Levin Gyemant and Leonard Shlain, the imitable Cynde Ahart
Woods, Robert Markstein, Donna Joyner, the wonderful Renee
Brincks of the Monterey County Convention and Visitors Bureau,
and Patricia Unterman. Mark Katz and our daughters, Lili and
Madeleine, make living anywhere an adventure and a joy. 
— Paula Tevis
Mary and Paula also wish to extend great thanks to their editor, 
Marc Nadeau.

Introduction
I
f you reached for California For Dummies, 4th Edition, because it
stood out from the overwhelming pack of California guidebooks or
because it just seemed different, pat yourself on the back — you have
good instincts.
This book walks you through the whole process of putting together your
perfect trip, from the ins and outs of laying out a manageable itinerary to
choosing the right places to stay to how much time to allot for which
attractions and activities. Not that one right answer exists for anybody,
of course. This book gives you the tools you need — and only what you
need, not too much — to really help you discover what works for you
and what doesn’t. We know your time is valuable, so we strive to get
right to the point and give you the clearest picture of what you need to
know, what choices you have to make, and what your options are so you
can make informed decisions easily and efficiently.
Think of building your vacation less as a step-by-step process and more
as a jigsaw puzzle. This book helps you choose the right puzzle pieces
and assemble them so that they interlock smoothly and the finished
product reflects the picture you want, not someone else’s image of what
your vacation should be.
About This Book
Some parts of California deserve your valuable time and hard-earned
money, and others don’t. For this reason, we’ve focused not on covering
California comprehensively, but on covering the best that California
offers. This book is a reference tool that answers all your questions
about the state’s most terrific destinations — places such as Disneyland
and Napa Valley. The result is a guidebook that directs you to all the
worthiest locales and doesn’t bother you with the secondary stuff.
Instead of just throwing out reams of information for you to sift through
until you’re too tired to tell Bakersfield from Big Sur, California For
Dummies, 4th Edition, cuts to the good stuff. We’ve done the legwork 
for you, and we want you to benefit from our expertise. We know that
you work hard to set aside a few precious weeks of vacation time and
that money doesn’t grow on palm fronds. But no matter how much
money you have, you don’t want to waste it. Consequently, we’re willing
to take a stand so that you will know what to include in your California
vacation — and, even more important, what to pass by. After all, you
want to figure this stuff out now, in the planning stage — not after you
get there, when it’s too late.

Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time — especially prices. We, therefore, suggest that you write or call
ahead for confirmation when making your travel plans. The authors, 
editors, and publisher can’t be held responsible for the experiences of 
readers while traveling. Your safety is important to us, however, so we
encourage you to stay alert and be aware of your surroundings. 
Conventions Used in This Book
We recently tried to extract some information from a guidebook and
found so many symbols that we considered training in hieroglyphics to
interpret them all. We are happy to report that the user-friendly
California For Dummies, 4th Edition, travel guide isn’t like that. The use
of symbols and abbreviations is kept to a minimum.
The credit-card abbreviations are as follows:
 AE: American Express
 DC: Diners Club
 DISC: Discover
 MC: MasterCard
 V: Visa
We list the hotels and restaurants in alphabetical order (for the most
part — and when we don’t, we let you know) so that moving among the
maps and descriptions is easy.
We include some general pricing information to help you as you decide
where to unpack your bags or dine on the local cuisine, and we use a
system of dollar signs to show a range of costs for one night in a hotel or
a meal at a restaurant. Check out the following table to decipher the
dollar signs:

Dummies Post-it® Flags
As you read this book, you may find information that you want to reference as you plan
or enjoy your trip — whether a new hotel, a must-see attraction, or a must-try walk-
ing tour. To simplify your trip planning, mark these pages with the handy Post-it® Flags
included in this book.

For those hotels, restaurants, and attractions that are plotted on a map,
we provide a page reference in the listing information. If a hotel, restau-
rant, or attraction is outside city limits or in an out-of-the-way area, it
may not be mapped.
Foolish Assumptions
Maybe this is your first California vacation — or maybe you haven’t
been to California since you were a kid, or you haven’t visited a particu-
lar region within the state. Or maybe you don’t want to dedicate your life
to trip planning, wading through hundreds of dense pages only to feel
more confused than confident about your choices. Maybe you don’t like
the way that so many conventional guidebooks require you to figure out
which hotels, destinations, restaurants, and so on the authors actually
like and which they’re including because they think quantity outweighs
quality.
On the other hand, you may be an experienced traveler, but you don’t
have a lot of time to devote to trip planning or you don’t have a lot of
time to spend in California after you get there. You want expert advice
on how to maximize your time and enjoy a hassle-free trip.
How This Book Is Organized
California For Dummies, 4th Edition, is divided into six parts. The chap-
ters within each part cover specific travel topics or regions in detail. You
can read each chapter or part without reading the one that came before
it — no need to read about San Francisco if you’re heading to Southern
California — but we may refer you to other chapters of the book for
more information on certain subjects.
Part I: Introducing California
This part introduces you to the best of California and touches on every-
thing you want to consider before actually getting down to the nitty-
gritty of trip planning, including:
 Lively cultural information
 When to go (and when you may want to stay home)
Introduction 3

 Tips on planning your itinerary, plus actual time-tested itineraries
that you can use as a proven blueprint for your own vacation
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California
This is where we get down to the nuts and bolts of travel planning,
including:
 How to get to California and how to get around California after 
you arrive
 How much you can expect your trip to cost, with tips on how to
save if money is a concern
 Special considerations for families, seniors, travelers with disabili-
ties, and gay and lesbian travelers
 The advantages of all-inclusive travel packages
 Getting ready to go, from the pluses and minuses of buying travel
insurance to making advance dinner reservations to what to pack
Parts III, IV, and V: The Destinations
If you think of this book as a meal, these parts constitute the main
course. They form the bulk of the book and cover the destinations you
want to visit. Each chapter offers all the specific details and recommen-
dations you need for a given destination, including:
 When to go
 How much time you’ll need
 How to get there
 Where to stay
 Where to eat
 What to do after you arrive
Part III covers Northern California: the San Francisco Bay Area; Wine
Country; the wild North Coast and tall-tree Redwood Country; and the
Sierra Nevada mountains, where you’ll find spectacular Lake Tahoe and
Yosemite National Park.
Part IV covers California’s Central Coast, which includes Santa Cruz and
such marvelous destinations as the Monterey Peninsula, Big Sur, Hearst
Castle, the Santa Ynez Valley, and that gem of the coast, Santa Barbara.
Part V focuses on Southern California, namely Los Angeles, San Diego,
the Disneyland Resort, and parts in between. And, if you’re the type who
never thinks the weather is too hot or too dry, we cover the desert,
including Palm Springs.

For a more thorough overview of California, flip to Chapter 3.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book contains a Part of Tens. If Parts III, IV, and V are
the main course of your meal, think of these fun chapters, each its own
top-ten list, as dessert. Go to Chapter 28 to find out where you can get
down and wacky the way actual Californians do (when we’re not writing
travel guides). If the folks back home demand a token of your travels,
and you’re something of a penny-pincher, read Chapter 29 to get the low-
down on inexpensive gifts.
Appendix
The Quick Concierge lists many details for easy reference, putting the
facts about California at your fingertips, from locating local American
Express offices to finding the most accurate online weather forecasts.
You can find this appendix easily because it’s printed on yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll notice the following icons sprinkled throughout the text. Think of
them as signposts; we use them to highlight special tips, draw your
attention to must-see destinations, and give you a heads-up on a variety
of topics.
This icon points out useful advice on things to do, alternate ways to
schedule your time, and other tips you won’t want to miss.

Introduction 5

Where to Go from Here
As you read through this book and start to formulate your California
vacation, remember this: Planning really is half the fun. Don’t think of
choosing your destination and solidifying the details as a chore. Make
the homebound part of the process a voyage of discovery and you’ll end
up with an entire vacation experience that is much more rewarding and
enriching — really. Let your vacation begin right now.

Part I
Introducing
California

In this part . . .
T
his part introduces you to the best of California, offers
some basic tips on timing your trip, and suggests some
possible itineraries, all so that your California vacation is as
spectacular as the state. The chapters in this part offer a 
cultural introduction to the state — digging deeper into
California’s storied history and unique culinary traditions —
and also discuss the movies and books that best deﬁne the
California ethos. This part helps you decide where and when
to go and offers several itineraries to follow on your trip.

Chapter 1
Discovering the Best 
of California
In This Chapter
 Drawing a bead on California’s outstanding experiences
 Serving up the best of California’s hotels and restaurants
 Finding the best family destinations
 Taking the scenic tour (even guided ones)
 Making your way to California’s elite museums
C
alifornia is really an awesome place, in the truest sense (not the
surfer-dude sense) of the word. Its jaw-dropping diversity is what
continues to amaze us (and we’re natives, mind you) more than anything
else. With two of the nation’s largest megalopolises — the San Francisco
Bay Area, which has grown beyond speculator’s wildest dreams with the
rise of Silicon Valley, and metropolitan Los Angeles, whose urban sprawl
has a glamorous heart called Hollywood — California has the largest,
wealthiest, and most urbanized population of any state in the nation. Yet
it’s also an agricultural wonderland with a bounty that runs the gamut
from artichokes, raisins, garlic, and asparagus to some of the finest wine-
making grapes in the world. And it still manages to be home to much of
the country’s most striking and varied wilderness — from purple moun-
tains’ majesty to arid, marvelously barren desert to coastlines of unsur-
passed beauty.
Even with all that, California is so much more — much more than we can
possibly include here. So we’ve designed this book to highlight what we
consider the best of the best of this awesome state — at least the best of
the best of what we think may appeal to you. In this chapter, you get an
added bonus: a quick reference to the experiences, hotels, restaurants,
and more that stand out as the absolute best. In the destination chap-
ters in Parts III, IV, and V, we discuss the places and experiences noted
here (the ones highlighted in bold) in more detail; just look for the Best
of the Best icon you see next to this paragraph.

The Best California Travel Experiences
Without taking the easy way out and suggesting that all travel experi-
ences in the Golden State are the best, here are a few prime cuts to con-
sider adding to your California itinerary:
 Strolling along San Francisco’s Embarcadero to Aquatic Park:
This is a quintessential San Francisco activity, ideally experienced
on a sunny day. We love to begin near the baseball park, although
it’s more convenient to take public transportation to the end of
Market Street and start there. With the water on your right and city
landmarks popping up on your left, a leisurely walk past the piers,
through Fisherman’s Wharf, leads to Aquatic Park and the
Municipal Pier. Be sure to hike all the way to the end of the pier,
stopping if you will to see what, if anything, the anglers have
caught. You’ll be rewarded with million-dollar bay vistas and a spot-
on view of the beautiful Golden Gate Bridge. See Chapter 11.
 Hiking in Yosemite Valley during the winter: Snow covers the
ground and clings to the tree branches, the air is crisp, the sky is
bright blue, and Yosemite Falls roars with snowmelt. With so few
visitors in the park during this low season, you’ll feel as though you
have this wonderland almost to yourself. Take advantage of winter
rates and stay at the grand Ahwahnee Hotel. See Chapter 16.
 Biking along the Monterey coastline: The Monterey Peninsula’s 
18-mile Recreation Trail was a brilliant piece of civic planning, a
useful and beautiful path for all to enjoy. It ends (or starts, if you
like) at Seal Rock past Pebble Beach and wends its way along the
coast through Monterey north to Marina. The most traveled sec-
tion is from Custom House Plaza past Cannery Row, the Aquarium,
and on to Lover’s Point; however, we suggest you carry on to
Pacific Grove, stop for lunch, and dawdle on the beach on your way
back. If you’re more than just a recreational cyclist, you may want
to carry on through the 17-Mile Drive. See Chapter 18.
 Sitting on a beach in Southern California: This activity’s not so
active, but there has to be a reason for all those Beach Boys songs,
right? You could surf, too, and you probably should get your feet
wet in the Pacific. But really, it’s all about the imagery, the girls, the
boys, the sand, the surf, the sun, the palm trees, and did we men-
tion that it’s January? See Part V.
 Cruising Sunset Boulevard: It’s the way to best see all that L.A. has
to offer in a short amount of time, as you drive this iconic boule-
vard from its origins at Olvera Street (L.A.’s oldest) through ethnic
neighborhoods, bohemian enclaves, dumps and dives, the dregs of
Hollywood, the spick-and-span wealth of Beverly Hills, the subdued
hush of Bel Air, past scenes of crime and shame (John Belushi and
River Phoenix each died within steps of the street, and the infa-
mous O.J. murder case happened blocks away), and catch glimpses
Part I: Introducing California 
10

of the Hollywood sign and stars on the sidewalk, all the way to the
end at the Pacific Ocean. We love L.A., and this drive is one of the
reasons why. See Chapter 23.
 Getting within 6 feet of a star: We can’t promise you’ll spot any
celebrities while in L.A. (keep your eyes peeled), but we can prom-
ise you proximity to some of the biggest names of the past . . . by
visiting their graves. Forest Lawn, Hollywood Forever, and
Westwood Memorial Park are just some of the resting spots of
Gable, Monroe, Disney, Valentino, and more. See Chapter 23.
California’s Best Hotels
When vacationing in California, swimming is nearly always an option —
for the kids and the adults. So if you’re looking for the best hotel 
pools — or the best hotels for a romantic getaway or for a decidedly
unromantic stay with the kids — this section is the right place.
Best all-around family hotels
Traveling with the kids? We know from experience that a good kid-
friendly hotel can make all the difference between a classically good
vacation and a classically bad one. The following are our favorite family-
friendly hotels in the state:
 The playful Argonaut Hotel in San Francisco shares lobby space
with the Maritime Museum, and its enviable location next to the
Cannery near Fisherman’s Wharf means you’ll be close to many kid-
pleasing attractions. See Chapter 11.
 The moderately priced Hotel del Sol in San Francisco has a heated
outdoor pool, treats for the kids, and a few units with kitchenettes.
Plus, the parking is free! See Chapter 11.
 Up in Calistoga, the enormous mineral pool at Indian Springs is all
that your kids need for happiness. The easygoing resortlike atmos-
phere is relaxing for the grown-ups as well. See Chapter 12.
 The new Treebones Resort in Big Sur offers an alternative to both
hotels and camping by housing guests in gorgeous yurts. Reserve
the yurt with the ping-pong table and then try to get the kids out-
side to hike. See Chapter 19.
 Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove resembles an
organized camp with better sleeping accommodations. Find the
kids on the beach or playing ping-pong. See Chapter 18.
Best hotels for a romantic weekend
Not traveling with the kids? Ahh, you’re in for a treat at these fine desti-
nations for two:
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of California 11

 In San Francisco, romantics have a couple of choices. The new
Hotel Vitale on the Embarcadero has a small spa with two semi-
secluded outdoor baths and rooms with knockout views of the 
bay. If you need to duck the paparazzi, the St. Regis Hotel is a self-
contained oasis you and your partner won’t want to leave. See
Chapter 11.
 Cocoon at the ultracomfy and chic Milliken Creek, convenient to
the town of Napa but providing a sense of being somewhere much
more glamorous. If you’d rather really be in the relative country of
the Sonoma Valley, hide away at the beautiful Kenwood Inn and
Spa, our pick for honeymooners. See Chapter 12.
 Mendocino is a popular romantic getaway. Lots less fancy than
Kenwood, but private, relaxed, and well tended, is the village’s
Alegria Oceanfront Inn & Cottages. The beach access and excel-
lent breakfast make it extra nice. If you’re seeking a Mendo retreat
with all the extras, wonderful Stanford Inn by the Sea has more
comforts than you’ll find at home, plus on-site spa services and a
very good vegetarian restaurant. See Chapter 13.
 Our northernmost pick is Ferndale’s Gingerbread Mansion Inn.
We’ve never seen anything quite like the over-the-top Romanesque
(as in Caesar) Empire Suite. See Chapter 14.
 For pure pampering and four-star dining, Château du Sureau in
Oakhurst will not disappoint, plus you’ll be close enough to
Yosemite to enjoy a day in the park. See Chapter 16.
 There’s nothing like endless ocean views to stir the senses and
you’ll find them, as well as a splendid breakfast and unobtrusive
service, in Monterey/Pacific Grove at the Grand View and Seven
Gables inns. See Chapter 18.
 It’s tough to choose between Big Sur’s Post Ranch Inn and Ventana
Inn & Spa — both are splendid examples of luxury properties. Post
Ranch is smaller and has the ocean view; Ventana is friendlier. See
Chapter 19.
 Santa Barbara’s Four Seasons Biltmore is right on the beach and is
a divine old (built in 1927) hotel run by the most pampering of
hoteliers in the country. See Chapter 22.
 When in L.A., consider the Chateau Marmont, where the Art Deco
and Beaux Arts castle-style main building and individual bungalows
remind us of the noir days of Los Angeles, where a rendezvous in a
dark corner seems like a very good thing indeed. See Chapter 23.
 La Jolla’s Lodge at Torrey Pines is a dreamy, breathtaking five-
diamond resort full of Craftsman furniture and luxe touches; 
however, as a resort, it may be a bit more bustling than you want.
See Chapter 27.
Part I: Introducing California 
12

Best hotel pools
Just when you thought a hotel pool is a hotel pool is a hotel pool, along
come these two heavenly respites:
 Children under 16 aren’t actually allowed in the spa at the
Huntington in San Francisco, so the lovely, large pool, which
reflects an eastward view of downtown, is the purview of the
grown-ups. If we had a category for best hotel spa, the Huntington
would get the nod there as well, although the St. Regis spa is mag-
nificent, too. See Chapter 11.
 Many Wine Country lodgings have pools, but none as inviting as
the Olympic-sized mineral pool at Indian Springs in Calistoga. The
view from the deck chairs is awesome as well. See Chapter 12.
California’s Best Restaurants
Eating out in California is not quite a competitive sport — but almost. In
this section, check out some of the state’s most innovative and most
inexpensive — and many others in between.
Best to impress
Expect no surprises when looking for the meal to die for (or the restau-
rant to be seen). The Bay Area and L.A. offer the cream of the crop of
California’s trendiest restaurants. However, you can find a gem or two in
other parts of the state.
 In San Francisco, Gary Danko runs a smooth operation from the
kitchen to the front of the house. His prix-fixe menu is unusual in
that guests do the choosing and it’s impossible to make a mistake.
See Chapter 11.
 Serious foodies regard the French Laundry in the Napa Valley 
village of Yountville as the Holy Grail of Gourmetdom; the problem
is actually getting a reservation. Of course, if it were easy to get
into, it would lose some cachet. See Chapter 12 for info on making
an attempt.
 If you’re near Santa Cruz around dinnertime, try booking a table at
the tiny Oswald. It does everything right, but quietly, which means
you may not have heard of the place. Take our word for it — the
food is worth a detour. See Chapter 17.
 You could get into some serious arguments with Los Angeles food
critics, daring them to choose between their beloved Campanile,
where owner Mark Peel has long demonstrated his gift with sea-
sonal cooking; Patina, which spawned a restaurant empire, and
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of California 13

now in its new Disney Hall–adjacent space, regularly thrills diners;
and the new Providence, whose French-influenced seafood earned
a James Beard nomination for Best New Restaurant, and may be the
finest dining option in Los Angeles. See Chapter 23.
Best for families with picky eaters
We don’t propose you let anyone starve (although that thought has
crossed our minds on occasion); on the other hand, no one ought to be
a hostage to chicken fingers in the bountiful state of California. The
restaurants in this list should satisfy the dining wish list of everyone in
your traveling party:
 In San Francisco, there’s something good for everyone on the menu
at Chow, which has two locations — one in the Castro district and
one near Golden Gate Park.
Another brilliant suggestion in the Bay Area (if we do say so our-
selves) is to let everyone graze to his own taste around the Ferry
Building on the Embarcadero where Market Street ends. Seafoodies
can wait for a stool at the Hog Island Oyster Bar, while those in the
mood for Japanese can pick up a bento box at Delica rf-1. The kids
(and probably you, too) will gleefully join the lines at Taylor’s
Refresher, a two-restaurant chain that redefines fast food for health-
conscious Northern Californians. See Chapter 11.
 In Monterey, Rosine’s is kind of what a Denny’s ought to have
aspired to: a plain, let’s-please-the-mainstream menu, but with mom
in the kitchen and better desserts. See Chapter 18.
 L.A. has many options for fussy eaters. The 101 Coffeeshop (in the
Best Western Hollywood Hills Hotel) has serious grown-up food
alongside one of the best burgers in the area. The Farmers Market
features a number of food stalls and restaurants around a central
food court area, so there is something for every taste — diner food
or homemade pies, doughnuts or Chinese food, deli or Greek, and
more. Angeli Café will make a simple pasta for your young diners,
as well as give them a ball of dough to mash and mold before
baking the creation as a take-home souvenir, all while you dine on
the cafe’s seasonal Italian delights. See Chapter 23.
Best for a lovely, but reasonably priced dinner
Not in the market for a meal to die for? You can dine just as nicely (and
also trendily) at any of the following establishments:
 Isa is one of two San Francisco restaurants we recommend in this
category. It serves absolutely delicious meals in a friendly, casual,
but professional little place in the Marina. We also adore the more
intimate Tablespoon on Russian Hill. See Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing California 
14

 In the Wine Country, Angèle in Napa is run by second-generation
restaurateurs and it shows, from the warm design of the lodgelike
interior to the carefully crafted menu. Our hands-down favorite in
Sonoma is Café La Haye. If an eatery can be described as having
clarity of purpose, this is it. See Chapter 12.
 Adorable Pacific Grove is preferable to Monterey, in our opinion,
for dining, and we especially recommend Passionfish. The menu
has a light Southeast-Asian bent, and this is a calm place in which
to enjoy excellent food. See Chapter 18.
 Santa Barbara’s Sage & Onion is a little gem with some of the
cleverest cooking in Southern California. See Chapter 22.
 Angelini Osteria in Los Angeles has remarkably authentic Italian
food, lovingly and passionately prepared. See Chapter 23.
Best dining with views
Good food and a view don’t usually mix; our theory is that, when you’re
facing a great view, the kitchen figures no one is really concentrating on
the meal, but that’s not fair, now, is it?
 One of San Francisco’s most celebrated restaurants, the Slanted
Door, recently moved to the new Ferry Building, so now you can
chow down on stellar Vietnamese and look at Alcatraz while enjoy-
ing both. See Chapter 11.
 The Ravens Restaurant at the Stanford Inn by the Sea in Mendocino
overlooks both the gorgeous property and the ocean in the dis-
tance. The vegetarian menu will convince even the toughest 
carnivore that green things are good. See Chapter 13.
 The food is just okay at Nepenthe, but this is the view to sigh for in
Big Sur. For great food and views, splash out at Cielo in the Ventana
Inn. See Chapter 19.
Best local traditions
Join the local residents and sample a meal at these time-tested eateries,
and you’ll discover how these establishments came to be so, er, well
established:
 It’s hard to find a single native who, when discussing food in Santa
Barbara, won’t bring up La Super-Rica Taqueria. It’s just a taco
shack, but one with lines out the door just about any time of day.
There’s a reason why. See Chapter 22.
 “Just” a French-dip sandwich doesn’t explain why locals have kept
Philippe’s in Los Angeles open since they created said sandwich 
in 1918. Join the crowds and become a regular yourself. See
Chapter 23.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of California 15

Best inexpensive meals
Los Angeles’s real claim to culinary fame isn’t so much brand-name
chefs, though it does boast more than a few. In our opinion, where other
cities can’t compete is with the heavenly and often-shockingly cheap
fare found at nondescript hole-in-the-wall restaurants. And, after all,
eating a variety of cuisines is a way to pay homage to the melting pot
that is California. You won’t have time in a short trip to do some serious,
daring poking around, so we direct you to two of our standout favorites:
Sanamluang Café, where you can dine for weeks on a massive Thai
menu, and Zankou Chicken (with three locations), where the perfect
roast chicken would be good enough, but when they add their special
garlic paste, it’s lifted into perfection. See Chapter 23.
The Best Family Excursions
Assuming you and your family will be unable to schedule several weeks
covering the whole of the Golden State, we’ve highlighted a few can’t-
miss family destinations for whichever part of the state you target:
 We wouldn’t have believed it if we hadn’t experienced it for our-
selves, but taking the ferry to Alcatraz Island, trooping up the hill,
pulling on the headset for the audio tour, and staring at prison cells
turns out to be fascinating. And we did it with a couple of teenage
girls. Alcatraz may be one of the biggest tourist attractions in
Northern California, but it’s actually worth the price of admission.
See Chapter 11.
 Humboldt Redwoods State Park is ideal if you’re an outdoorsy
type, and a hike amongst the giants is a memorable experience.
During the summer, stop by the visitor center for information on
ranger-led nature walks and the Junior Ranger’s program for kids 7
to 12. See Chapter 14.
 The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, a cartoon-character-free zone,
may not have the glitz or polish of pristine Disneyland, but its 
manageable size, beachside location, and old-fashioned ambience
hearken back to amusement parks such as New York’s Coney
Island. Bay Area teens flock here in the summer along with vaca-
tioning families; we recall bringing the kids when they were still too
short to qualify for the more daring rides. Be sure to buy a bag of
saltwater taffy, because you can’t find that stuff just anywhere. See
Chapter 17.
 The Monterey Bay Aquarium is no glorified fish hostel; few aquar-
iums come anywhere close in grandeur to this spectacular com-
pound. Stand at the window into the Outer Bay exhibit for a while
and we bet you’ll agree this is one of the few “educational” stops on
a tour of Northern California that probably ought to be mandatory.
See Chapter 18.
Part I: Introducing California 
16

 The original — and still the champion — Disneyland Resort
remains the must-see family destination in California. It’s expen-
sive; it can be crowded and hot; it’s magic. Really, did you think
there was any way we weren’t going to recommend this for chil-
dren? Actually, there is; if your kids are under the age of 6, do take
into consideration any fears or phobias they may have. For exam-
ple, if your kids are anxious in dark places, many of the rides —
even those geared toward the very young — start off in the dark. It
would be a shame to spend that much money, time, and effort just
to ride the merry-go-round a bunch. See Chapter 24.
 Speaking of merry-go-rounds, you can find an all-wood one from the
1920s on the Santa Monica Pier, along with other carnival rides,
shops, and food stalls. A sweet little excursion right on the edge of
not-so-sweet Los Angeles. See Chapter 23.
 A couple of L.A. museums may be just the ticket for your kids. If
you’re the sort of parent who wants an educated holiday, try the
California ScienCenter, which has all sorts of hands-on interactive
displays and, as of this writing, actual human bodies preserved in
plastic. Yuck! But we bet kids will remember they saw it, long after
they’ve forgotten about the Grand Canyon. Or if you really want
your kids to love you, let them watch TV on their vacation, but do
so at the Museum of Television & Radio, where an extraordinary
number of hours of classic TV, from sitcoms to Moon landings to
Olympic moments, are available for viewing on monitors. See
Chapter 23.
 Kids and zoos go together, and though we’re partial to the some-
times overlooked, but still worthy Los Angeles Zoo (see Chap-
ter 23), the San Diego Zoo (see Chapter 27) gets a lot of headlines
for a reason. One operation is slick and sharp, the other perhaps
not so much, but honestly, we don’t see enough of a difference to
justify the disparity in ticket prices. Pick whichever one you’re clos-
est to geographically. But remember that animals are smart, and
that’s why, when it’s hot, they snooze in the shade. If you want to
see more than slumber, be sure to go early or late or on a generally
cool or overcast day.
The Best Scenic Drives
Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but California offers so much
to behold that we think it’s essential to plan for at least one day of just
driving. These scenic drives promise the best views, stopovers, and dis-
tractions that very quickly fill up that one day of just driving:
 Best in Northern California: If you’re in San Francisco with plans to
head south, rent a car the day you’re leaving. Say farewell to the city
by driving west on Geary Boulevard all the way out to the ocean
where you’ll turn left onto the Great Highway. This road leads along
the water to the tiny village of Pacifica and to Highway 1. Traffic
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of California 17

can be dense on weekends, but there’s no lovelier way to reach
Santa Cruz or points farther south. After you pass the town of
Napa, the drive along Highway 29 up to and past Calistoga is so
pretty you’ll want to draw straws to determine who gets the pas-
senger seat. Although the drive to Mendocino gets enthusiastic
raves from people who love car trips, the 32-mile tour along the
Avenue of the Giants is easier on folks who get carsick, because
the road is comparatively less curvy.
 Best on the Central Coast: Paying to drive through some of the
more expensive real estate in the country may seem counterin-
tuitive, but the fact is, the 17-Mile Drive through Pebble Beach is a
worthy attraction (despite the price of gasoline). We can’t ever get
enough of the splendid coast however, and the always-toll-free
Highway 1 between Point Lobos State Reserve (just south of
Carmel) and San Simeon is on the top-ten list of excitingly gorgeous
drives.
 Best in Southern California: The Pacific Coast Highway (High-
way 1) runs along some of the most spectacular coastal scenery in
the country. Pretty much anywhere is good, from the start at San
Juan Capistrano all the way up through San Luis Obispo, although
it varies: The stretch alongside Los Angeles County is somewhat
developed, but after you get past Malibu and on your way up to
(and past) Santa Barbara, you’re rewarded with rocky cliffs tum-
bling into the ocean. The stretch of 19 miles in Santa Barbara
County is one of the finest, and while continuing north into Central
Coast Wine Country adds green vineyards into the scenic mix, that
is technically no longer Southern California.
The Best Museums
You can find some nice little museums in California cities outside of the
Bay Area and L.A. — and we introduce you to some of them in the desti-
nations chapters in this book. But for hardcore museum-philes, to the
big cities you go.
 Best with kids: Try San Francisco. The Exploratorium benefits
from being educational but not boring — all the exhibits are hands-
on and there are plenty of them. Science-minded scions will settle
in happily for hours. Artsy teens may be intrigued by the Cartoon
Art Museum, not far from the Sony Metreon. See Chapter 11.
 Best for contemporary-art lovers: San Francisco’s Museum of
Modern Art (see Chapter 11) is our kind of gallery; the art is well
curated, the building is beautiful, the cafe has really good food, and
the gift shop is tops. But Los Angeles’s two-part Museum of
Contemporary Art/MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary (see
Chapter 23) has significant exhibits, from Lucien Freud retrospec-
tives to a recent Minimal Art exhibit that was featured in Time
magazine to fantastic permanent collections.
Part I: Introducing California 
18

 Best encyclopedic museum other than the Met in NYC: The Los
Angeles County Museum of Art has something for everyone: old
masters, young modern artists, antiquities from across the globe
and through the centuries, some of the finest collections of Asian
art anywhere, and the list goes on. The building is no great shakes,
but it’s oddly and undeservedly uncrowded much of the time. See
Chapter 23.
 Best museum with a message: The Museum of Tolerance in
Beverly Hills may be more Holocaust-centric than one would like
(only because the tragic consequences of intolerance manifest in
many different times and places), but its message is universal, now
in these perilous times more than ever. See Chapter 23.
 Best-looking museum: Listing the very wealthy and powerful Getty
Museum this way is probably odd, but we know the truth: The col-
lection is boring, but the setting, way up in the hills over West Los
Angeles, with views out to the sea, and in a very modern urban
space, is anything but. It’s worth it just to come here for a snack,
and because it’s free (albeit with a $7 parking fee), not at all a risk.
The newly reopened Getty Villa, with an emphasis on Roman and
Greek antiquities, styled as a classical Roman villa and set on a
Malibu cliffside, is a near-perfect combination of structure and col-
lection. See Chapter 23.
The Best Guided Tours
We generally are reluctant to heartily recommend guided tours — armed
with this book and your own intimate knowledge of your personal inter-
ests, you’re likely to do just about as well as any tour guide. However, we
do make some exceptions for the following:
 Best for food and wine lovers: In San Francisco, we suggest either
Wok Wiz Chinatown Tour or Mangia! North Beach (see Chap-
ter 11). Though expensive, both are scads of fun and offer an
opportunity to meet some local characters while walking around
the city’s more fascinating neighborhoods. In Napa, let the boys
from the Napa Winery Shuttle (see Chapter 12) show you their
favorite wineries, or they can customize a daylong itinerary.
 Best for architecture buffs: The major sights of Los Angeles are
easy to do on your own, but if you want to see the hidden charms
of this city, we highly recommend Architecture Tours L.A. The
owner does two-hour tours of the overviews and highlights of vari-
ous L.A. neighborhoods (and she can customize for you), from
Greene and Greene beauties to the groundbreaking work of Neutra
and Schindler.

 Taking in the film industry — with its cast of thousands
T
he smug East Coast believes it has a monopoly on U.S. history, as if
California had a gold rush and little else until it sprung, fully formed,
from the forehead of the film industry in the 1910s. That’s rank arro-
gance. California’s history goes back thousands of years; Native
Americans enjoyed it from the mountains to the sea well before the
Europeans showed up in the mid–16th century (yes, that’s right; about
the same time they were settling the East Coast). Of course, this being
California, where people have come for centuries to reinvent them-
selves, hardly anything remains pre-1700-something (much less thou-
sands of years back), although there are some very nice parking lots.
In any event, this chapter invites you to understand a little more about
the state’s historical and cultural legacy.
History 101
Portuguese explorer Juan Rodrígues Cabrillo is credited with being the
first European to “discover” (in 1542) California, beginning the process
of newcomers wrecking the state for the natives (a complaint that
remains today, although the self-proclaimed “natives” are people whose
residency ranges from a couple of years to two whole generations). Over
the next 200 years, dozens of sailors mapped the coast, including British
explorer Sir Francis Drake, who sailed his Golden Hind into what is now
called Drake’s Bay in 1579, and Spanish explorer Sebastian Vizcano, who,
in 1602, bestowed most of the place names that survive today, including
San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Carmel.
European colonial competition and Catholic missionary zeal prompted
Spain to establish settlements along the Alta (upper) California coast

and claim the lands as its own. In 1769, teeny (5-foot-nothing) Father
Junípero Serra, accompanied by 300 soldiers and clergy, began forging a
path from Mexico to Monterey. A small mission and presidio (fort) were
established that year at San Diego, and by 1804, a chain of 21 missions,
each a day’s walk from the next along a dirt road called Camino Real
(Royal Road), stretched all the way to Sonoma. Most of the solidly built
missions — Mission Delores, Mission San Juan Bautista, Mission San
Diego de Alcala, to name just a few — still remain and offer public tours.
The missions are pretty and pious, but their existence resulted in 
the usual story: Thousands of Native Americans were converted to
Christianity and coerced into labor. Many others died from imported 
diseases. Because not all the natives welcomed their conquerors with
open arms, many missions and pueblos (small towns) suffered repeated
attacks, leading to the construction of California’s now ubiquitous —
and fireproof — red-tile roofs.
Embattled at home as well as abroad, the Spanish relinquished their
claim to Mexico and California in 1821. Under Mexican rule, Alta
California’s Spanish missionaries fell out of favor and lost much of their
land to the increasingly wealthy Californios — Mexican immigrants who
had been granted tracts of land.
Beginning in the late 1820s, Americans from the East began to make their
way to California via a three-month sail around Cape Horn. Most of them
settled in the territorial capital of Monterey and in Northern California.
From the 1830s on, Manifest Destiny led many a pioneer to go west,
young man — and woman. The first covered-wagon train made the four-
month crossing in 1844. Over the next few years, several hundred
Americans made the trek to California over the Sierra Nevada range 
via Truckee Pass, just north of Lake Tahoe. A memorial to the Donner
Party — the most famous tragedy in the history of westward migration,
and the subject of many a culinary joke we won’t repeat — marks the
site of the ill-fated travelers.
In 1846, President James Polk offered Mexico $40 million for California
and New Mexico, a sum that will barely get you a shack on the beach in
Malibu today. The offer might have been accepted, but the two countries
got too busy fighting over Texas, instead. The United States won and
simply took over the entire West Coast. (This chain of events throws an
interesting light on the attitudes toward Mexican immigrants today.)
In 1848, California’s non–Native American population was around 7,000.
But then gold was discovered in them thar hills — well, flakes at a
sawmill along the American River, anyway. Faster than you can say
“Eureka, California!” 300,000 men and women rushed into the state
between 1849 and 1851, one of the largest mass migrations in U.S. his-
tory. Very few of them found any actual gold, foreshadowing similar
migrations trying to hit it big in the movie industry.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into California 21

In 1850, California was admitted to the Union as the 31st state. The state
constitution on which California applied for admission included several
noteworthy features that set up California as the progressive (to some,
flaky and overly liberal) place it remains. To protect the miners, slavery
was prohibited. To attract women from the East Coast, legal recognition
was given to the separate property of a married woman (California was
the first state to offer such recognition).
Not-so-progressively, by 1870, almost 90 percent of the state’s Native
American population had been wiped out, and the bulk of the rest were
removed to inland reservations.
In 1875, when the Santa Fe Railroad reached Los Angeles, Southern
California’s population of just 10,000 was divided equally between Los
Angeles and San Diego. As San Francisco, around the tenth-largest city in
the United States, suffered a serious setback in the form of the infamous
1906 earthquake and subsequent devastating fire (it rallied fast and
strong enough to host the 1915 Panama Pacific Exposition), Los Angeles
got its own growth spurt, and identity, thanks to the nascent movie
industry realizing that in places where it doesn’t snow, you can film out-
doors year-round. The movies’ glamorous, idyllic portrayal of California
boosted the region’s popularity and population, especially during the
Great Depression of the 1930s, when thousands of families (like the
Joads in John Steinbeck’s novel The Grapes of Wrath) packed up their
belongings and headed west in search of a better life.
World War II brought heavy industry to California, in the form of muni-
tions factories, shipyards, and airplane manufacturing. In the 1950s,
California in general, and San Francisco in particular, became popular
with artists and intellectuals. The so-called Beat Generation appeared,
which later inspired alternative-culture groups — most notably the
flower children of the 1960s — in San Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury district.
During the Summer of Love in 1967, as the war in Vietnam escalated, stu-
dent protests increased at Berkeley and elsewhere in California, as they
did across the country. A year later, amid rising racial tensions, Martin
Luther King, Jr., was killed, setting off riots in the Watts section of Los
Angeles and in other cities. Soon thereafter, Robert F. Kennedy was fatally
shot in Los Angeles after winning the California Democratic Party presi-
dential primary. Antiwar protests continued into the 1970s.
Perhaps in response to an increasingly violent society, the 1970s also
gave rise to several exotic religions and cults, which found eager adher-
ents in California. The spiritual New Age continued into the 1980s, along
with a growing population, environmental pollution, and escalating
social ills, especially in Los Angeles. Real-estate values soared, the com-
puter industry — centered in Silicon Valley, south of San Francisco —
boomed, and banks and businesses prospered.
The late 1980s and early 1990s, however, brought a devastating reces-
sion to the state. Los Angeles stayed perpetually in the news, thanks 
to grave issues such as the race riots spurred by a videotaping and 
Part I: Introducing California 
22

subsequent acquittal of four white police officers beating black motorist
Rodney King, along with ultimately trivial if captivating ones like the O.J.
Simpson murder case and other celebrity peccadilloes. Two years later,
a major earthquake caused billions of dollars in damage to L.A. and left
thousands injured and homeless, while Oakland’s hills became a raging
inferno, killing 26 people and destroying 3,000 homes.
Midway through the 1990s, the U.S. economy slowly began to improve, a
welcome relief to recession-battered Californians. Crime and unemploy-
ment began to drop, while public schools received millions for much-
needed improvements. Computer- and Internet-related industries
flourished in the Bay Area, with entrepreneurialism fueling much of the
growth. As the stock market continued its record-setting pace, no state
reaped more benefits than California, which was gaining new million-
aires by the day. At the millennium, optimism in the state’s economy and
quality of life was at an all-time high.
At the turn of the century, the economy was still strong, the unemploy-
ment rate still low, and property rates still rising. Then came some out-
of-the-blue sucker punches to California’s rosy economy, including the
rapid demise of many, if not most, of the dot-coms in the stock-market
slump and an energy deregulation scheme gone awry, leaving irate resi-
dents with periodic rolling blackouts and escalating energy bills. The ter-
rorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the following national trauma
and economic downturn hit California hard.
And just when things seemed to be getting back to normal, along came
the 2003 recall effort to oust Governor Gray Davis, launching California
politics into the national news limelight as Arnold “The Terminator”
Schwarzenegger unseated the unpopular politician. Not to be outdone,
the following year San Francisco elected a 36-year-old supervisor, Gavin
Newsom, as mayor. He quickly made national headlines by authorizing
city hall to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He even per-
formed a few of the unions. Six months later, the state supreme court
invalidated 3,955 gay marriages. California: It’s like that. It may be many
things, but boring is never one of them.
A Bite of California’s Culinary 
Past and Present
What are the factors that make California such a delightful place to dine
(and grocery shop)? Location, location, location. No other state in the
union cultivates like the Golden State; in fact, California’s farmers pro-
duce over half the country’s fruit and vegetables on just a measly 3 per-
cent of its farmland. Almonds, olives, lemons, artichokes, all kinds of
cruciferous and cabbagey vegetables, figs, dates, and truckloads of
grapes and tomatoes are just some of the commercially produced good-
ies that thrive in the state’s mellow Mediterranean climate.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into California 23

But California’s cuisine is greater than the sum of its parts. Along with a
rich pantry, immigration has affected what and how Californians and its
visitors eat. In Northern California, the Gold Rush attracted an enormous
number of Chinese from Canton Province, who stayed to work on the 
railroad and eventually settled into Chinatowns throughout the state.
Chinese eateries opened to feed the largely male population, but by the
1920s, adventuresome Anglos found it fashionable to give Chinese food a
try, and soon you could sample chop suey in every city, big or small.
In Southern California, Latino immigrants brought their influence to
bear, introducing unfamiliar spices and changing the tastes of a popula-
tion to such an extent that fast food today means tacos and burritos as
much as hamburgers and fries. Los Angeles, in fact, can make its
strongest claim to culinary fame (beyond the first and still champion
celebrity chef, the highly influential Wolfgang Puck of iconic Spago in
Beverly Hills) courtesy of its many hole-in-the-wall ethnic restaurants.
Reflecting the dozens (if not hundreds) of cultures that have settled in
the area, the curious can nosh on Armenian, Nicaraguan, Oaxacan,
Ethiopian, Issan Thai, Romanian, Hungarian, and more — a veritable
United Nations of dining experiences, and many of them within just a
few blocks of each other. And that’s not even discussing California rolls,
which regrettably (in the minds of some purists) forever changed sushi-
eating from a meditative consideration on a choice slice of fish to a
circus stunt wrapped in seaweed. And Nancy Silverton’s La Brea
Bakery, originally just a local bread shop, seems to have survived the
low-carb phase just fine, bringing the gospel of artisanal bread to restau-
rants and supermarkets across the country.
Perhaps the greatest modern influence on how tuned-in Californians eat
can be traced to food gurus such as Alice Waters. Her restaurant,
Berkeley-based Chez Panisse, began as an outgrowth of Waters’s desire
to feed her friends and became a philosophical training ground for many
of today’s important chefs. Like French cooks — and Waters was pro-
foundly changed by a year living in Paris — she is interested not in the
quantity or cost of ingredients, but strictly in quality and freshness.
In Berkeley, Waters created an infrastructure in which her restaurant is
dependent on a cadre of small farmers, and vice versa. It wasn’t enough,
however, to provide customers with the tastiest heirloom tomatoes and
organic baby lettuces: the breads must be as delicious and fresh; the
meats must be sourced from trusted ranchers; the cheese should com-
plement the fruits and come from local producers as well.
So along with a generation of restaurateurs, Chez Panisse inspired such
robust local-artisan producers as Acme Bread and Cowgirl Creamery.
California cuisine — which is really about showcasing the flavors of
locally grown, seasonal bounty at its peak — has spread throughout and
beyond California, thanks to Waters and to the chefs who have made her
vision their own.

California on the Page and the Screen
The beauty and metaphor that is California (Gold Rush; Land of
Opportunity; Go West, Young Man; Silver Screen — the list goes on) has
inspired far too many authors and moviemakers to list in any compre-
hensive way. But we give you a taste in the sections that follow.
Reading up on California
Quantifying art is odious, but we have to say the greatest California
novels were written by John Steinbeck. Oh, c’mon, the man won the
Nobel Prize for Literature — that has to count for something. Start with
The Grapes of Wrath, as the Joad family flees the defeat of Dust Bowl
Oklahoma only to find bitter disillusionment in the not-so-Golden State.
Then visit with his oddly happy crew of lowlifes who hang around
Monterey Bay’s Cannery Row.
Upton Sinclair didn’t get a Nobel Prize (despite the efforts of his admirer,
George Bernard Shaw), but his Oil! is considered the great novel of 1920s
Southern California. Hollywood Noir simply wouldn’t be the same with-
out Philip Marlowe, the private-eye protagonist of Raymond Chandler’s
detective novels such as The Big Sleep. His Northern California counter-
part Dashiell Hammett brought the world Sam Spade in The Maltese
Falcon (Spade worked in San Francisco). What does it say about the
state when its most famous romantic figures are troubled loners?
Anyone wanting to try his luck in Hollywood should be required to read
Nathaniel West’s Day of the Locusts (because it rips the glitter off
Tinseltown and shows the savagery beneath) and Bud Shulberg’s What
Makes Sammy Run? (featuring everyone’s favorite amoral, desperate
agent Sammy Glick, role model for too many ambitious, if not particu-
larly self-aware, Young Turks). Following in these footsteps is Michael
Tolkein’s The Player, equally unsentimental about This Town and The
Industry, to say the least. (At least Sammy Glick never killed anyone —
that we know of.) If you ask him, however, Tolkein would say the best
novel about Los Angeles is John Fante’s 1939 Ask The Dust, wherein yet
another young writer gets his hopes and dreams crushed.
And while we are recommending downer (if brilliant) books, follow Los
Angeles’s turbulent history and speculate on its future via Mark Davis’s
City of Quartz. Relive some of the state’s most infamous (and brutal)
moments with Vincent Bugliosi’s Helter Skelter (the best version of the
Manson murders and the book most responsible for childhood night-
mares among a generation), or one of the many books about San
Francisco’s Zodiac Killer, L.A.’s Hillside Strangler, and, of course, O.J.
One of the more famous and beloved pieces of modern fiction based in
San Francisco is Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City. If you’ve seen
the miniseries, and especially if you haven’t, this is a must read for a
leisurely afternoon — Maupin is a Dickens for his time. His 1970s soap
opera covers the residents of 28 Barbary Lane (Macondry Lane on
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into California 25

Russian Hill was the inspiration), melding sex, drugs, and growing self-
awareness with enormous warmth and humor. A work of fiction featur-
ing San Francisco during the Gold Rush is Daughter of Fortune by
acclaimed novelist and Marin resident Isabel Allende. The tale begins in
Chile and follows the life of Eliza, an orphan adopted by a proper English
spinster and her brother. In love with a boy who has sailed for the gold
fields, a pregnant Eliza runs away from home to search for the lad and is
befriended by a Chinese doctor. Allende’s vivid depiction of life in
California during the mid–19th century is one of the novel’s strengths.
Going to the California picture show
Perhaps we should turn to movies to lighten things up. San Francisco
and Northern California, landscape and residents both, are God’s gift to
filmmakers.
 The film version of The Grapes of Wrath (1940). The John Ford–
directed, Academy Award–winning film of dispossessed Okie Dust
Bowl farmers who migrate west to the promised land — California
— wins a spot on this list not for its tremendous footage of the
Golden State, but because it beautifully evokes California’s agrarian
story.
 Vertigo (1958) is the work of possibly the greatest movie director of all
time, Alfred Hitchcock, who always used locations well — remember
Mount Rushmore in North by Northwest? In Vertigo, the suspense
master uses San Francisco to dizzying effect (pun intended).
 Monterey Pop (1969), D.A. Pennebaker’s first-rate rockumentary,
chronicles the glorious three-day music festival that was actually a
better realization of the Summer of Love dream than Woodstock
ever hoped to be. The film wonderfully captures ’60s’ San
Francisco’s Haight-Ashbury vibe and the California sound, includ-
ing groups such as the Mamas and the Papas (whose leader, the
late John Phillips, was the brains behind the event), Jefferson
Airplane, Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company,
Jimi Hendrix, Canned Heat, The Who, and others, including a stun-
ning performance by Otis Redding.
 With Play Misty for Me (1971), Clint Eastwood made his directorial
debut, a winningly creepy thriller costarring Jessica Walter (and
Donna Mills, of quintessentially Californian Knots Landing fame).
Young, studly Clint looks mighty fine, but the real star of the show
is stunning Carmel, which Clint films with a genuine hometown love
and a master’s eye. (You may remember that Eastwood was elected
mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea in 1986; he still owns the Mission
Ranch, an elegant country inn, and resides in town.) Watch for the
great footage of Big Sur’s Bixby Bridge.
 What’s Up, Doc? (1972) is a Peter Bogdanovich–directed, Buck
Henry–scribed gem starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O’Neal 
that shows off the hilly streets of San Francisco — especially
Chinatown — at their most colorful and romantic.
Part I: Introducing California 
26

Of course, the film industry in Southern California has spent some time
concentrating on itself as well, as in the following gems:
 A more light-hearted view of California comes from Gidget
(1965). Perky Sally Field is the ultimate California beach girl in the
ultimate California beach movie. This innocent romp is really a joy
to watch — far superior to the Frankie Avalon/Annette Funicello
beach movies — with excellent footage of Malibu Beach and Pacific
Coast Highway (cruisin’ with the top down, of course).
 Staying South, Chinatown (1974) is possibly the finest noir ever
committed to film, using L.A. in the ’70s to re-create L.A. in the 
’30s impeccably. Not only did director Roman Polanski (pre-exile)
capture the City of Angels masterfully, but writer Robert Towne
worked in an essential slice of city history: the dirty dealing 
and power grabbing of water rights that allowed — for better or
worse — the infant desert city to blossom into the sprawling
metropolis you see today. And, of course, this true classic features
Jack Nicholson as the hard-boiled detective embroiled with femme
fatale Faye Dunaway, plus legendary Hollywood heavyweight John
Huston as the evil genius behind the Chandleresque web of
intrigue. Its modern-day noir and crime successor is the Oscar 
winning L.A. Confidential (1997).
 Valley Girl (1983), starring a teenage Nicolas Cage, is an underdog
in a teen genre that includes Fast Times at Ridgemont High and
Clueless, but it comes out a winner because of its New-Wave-Boy-
meets-mall-lovin’-Valley-Girl love story at the height of Valley Girl
mania.
 The Big Picture (1989) is director Christopher Guest’s first feature,
a dead-on and deadly satire of the movie industry, filmed presum-
ably on a shoestring around Hollywood and just outside in the
desert. It’s hilarious — we watch it once a year just to laugh our-
selves silly, and wince over how recognizable it all is — and we
don’t just mean the locations.
 Steve Martin’s L.A. Story (1991) is a romantic look at everything
that’s wonderfully silly about life in contemporary Tinseltown.
 The Player (1992) all-too-realistically captures the seedy under-
belly and soul-selling seductive power of Hollywood influence and
celebrity. Everybody who’s anybody in the movie industry knows
how scarily close to home Tim Robbins’s portrayal of beleaguered
studio exec Griffin Mill hits.
 Finally, check out any movie with “Beverly Hills” in the title (Slums
of Beverly Hills, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Beverly Hills
Cop . . .).

C
alifornia isn’t like any state in the Union. In fact, it’s hardly like a
state at all. Even national politicians tend to refer to the 31st state
as “the nation of California” — a sovereign country all its own, an
immense and diverse dominion to be conquered above and beyond the
other 49 states.
Their outsize view isn’t far from the truth. With nearly 159,000 square
miles of land and a 1,264-mile coastline, California is the third largest
state in the United States. Sure, both Alaska and Texas are bigger — but
California’s uniqueness stems from much more than size. California is
like the high-school homecoming queen whose natural beauty and
innate poise make the rest of the student body sneer at her while want-
ing to bask in her glow at the very same time. They don’t call this the
Golden State for nothing, after all.
Within the natural landscape alone, the contrast is unparalleled. Take
Mount Whitney and Death Valley as a case in point: At 14,494 feet above
and 282 feet below sea level, respectively, they are the highest and
lowest points in the continental United States — and just 85 miles sepa-
rates them. Wow.
Going Everywhere You Want to Be
Unless you have a couple of months to spare for vacation (lucky you!),
you’re not going to see everything this marvelous, multifaceted state
has to offer. You know what? Don’t even waste time trying. Frankly, some
parts of California are much worthier of your valuable time and hard-
earned money than others.

The destinations in this chapter (shown on the inside front cover of this
book) comprise the best of California. You discover more about them
throughout this book as you plan your trip.
The San Francisco Bay Area
The metropolitan San Francisco Bay Area grew by leaps and bounds
with the Silicon Valley revolution; even with the dot-com bust, the 
city and environs have remained coveted real estate. The prime draw,
however, is still the loveliest and most beguiling city in America, San
Francisco (see Chapter 11). “The city” (as locals call it — never, ever
“Frisco”) is smaller than you may expect, loaded with personality in all
corners, and pleasant to visit year-round. It’s also the one destination in
the Driving State where you can easily get around without a car.
If San Francisco is the ultimate urban destination, then the gorgeous
Wine Country of Napa and Sonoma counties — America’s premier wine-
growing region (see Chapter 12) — is the embodiment of pastoral
escape. These superfertile valleys brim with world-class wine-tasting
rooms and some of the country’s finest restaurants and inns.
The North Coast
The wild and woolly coastal region north of the San Francisco Bay Area
(see Part III) offers some of California’s most breathtaking scenery. It’s
quiet, remote, and ruggedly handsome, with spectacular nature broken
only by the occasional picturesque village. Of those villages, none is
lovelier than romantic Mendocino (see Chapter 13), a postage stamp 
of a town situated on a majestic headland. Rife with elegant bed-and-
breakfasts (B&Bs), upscale restaurants, and pricey boutiques and 
galleries, it’s definitely built for two — but families with kids find plenty
of outdoor activities to occupy them in the surrounding area. Beware
the weather, though, which can be cold and misty at any time of the 
year — all part of the dreamy Mendocino vibe, aficionados say.
Mendocino also serves as a good jumping-off point for exploring the
regal Redwood Country (see Chapter 14), which starts just inland and
north of Mendocino. The towering coast redwoods — the tallest trees on
the planet — extend all the way to the Oregon border, but you don’t
need to travel that far to get your fill of their majesty. You can follow the
scenic 32-mile Avenue of the Giants to the midpoint as a day trip from
Mendocino or dedicate a couple of days to the drive, depending on your
sightseeing goals.
The Sierra Nevadas
Travel inland from the Bay Area or North Coast and you’ll soon reach
the Sierra Nevadas, the magnificently rugged, granite-peaked mountain
range that defines northeast and east-central California. This high-altitude
region is so uniquely stunning that such geniuses as Mark Twain and
Ansel Adams considered it one of their greatest inspirations. The 
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 29

Sierra Nevadas stirred John Muir to do no less than found the U.S.
National Park system.
Possibly the greatest of the national parks is spectacular Yosemite
National Park (see Chapter 16), whose natural wonders include such
record-setters as Yosemite Falls (North America’s tallest waterfall) and
El Capitan (the world’s largest granite monolith). Beware, though,
because Yosemite is the superstar of California’s natural attractions,
drawing theme-park-worthy crowds in summer — but we tell you in
Chapter 16 how to do your best to lose them. Just to the south of
Yosemite is the year-round recreational playground resort of Mammoth
Mountain, where you can ski from November to July.
Also in the High Sierras rests the biggest and most beautiful alpine lake in
the United States, sparkling Lake Tahoe (see Chapter 15) — California’s
finest outdoor playground. Come in the winter to ski, in the summer to
hike, bike, kayak, sail . . . you name it. If you’re a history buff and on 
your way to or from Tahoe, consider taking a day to visit Sacramento,
California’s capital, or the Gold Country (see Chapter 15), the epicenter
of California’s 19th-century gold-rush hysteria.
The Central Coast
If you ask us (and you did), the Central Coast — the stretch between San
Francisco and Los Angeles — represents California at its very best (see
Part IV). The drive along Highway 1 — the world-famous Pacific Coast
Highway — is one of the most scenic in the world. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that the drive is slow going and quite curvy — real Dramamine ter-
ritory, so stock up if you’re queasy.
Where the San Francisco Bay Area meets the Monterey Peninsula sits
Santa Cruz (see Chapter 17), California’s quintessential, and kinda wacky,
surf town. Kids (and kids at heart) will love Santa Cruz — especially the
genuine old-fashioned boardwalk, the West Coast’s only beachfront
amusement park. Santa Cruz is at its best in summer and early fall, when
the beach party is going strong.
Pristine nature meets unbridled commercialism on the Monterey
Peninsula (see Chapter 18) — and fortunately, nature wins out. This
stunning knob of land jutting out to sea cradles Monterey Bay, one of the
richest and most diverse marine habitats on Earth. On land you’ll find the
Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of California’s all-time top attractions, plus
a collection of delightful communities, from family-friendly Monterey
itself to golf mecca Pebble Beach to ultraromantic Carmel-by-the-Sea.
The marriage of natural beauty and man-made diversions doesn’t get any
better than this.
In Big Sur (see Chapter 19), on the other hand, the spectacular wilder-
ness and breathtaking views are unhindered by all but the most minimal
development. Dedicate a full day to the natural splendor of Big Sur even
if you don’t want to stay in one of the region’s funky hotels; you won’t
regret a minute of it.
Part I: Introducing California 
30

Hearst Castle (see Chapter 20), one of the most outrageous private
homes ever built and a real hoot to tour, lies on the other end of the
man-versus-nature continuum. Even if this monument to excess isn’t
your style, you’ll enjoy the surrounding countryside — neither Northern
California nor Southern, it has a distinct, golden-hued beauty all its 
own — and the amiable village of Cambria, a great place to soak up
some small-town charm.
Driving farther down the coast puts you squarely in Southern California.
Adults enjoy meandering through the charming Central Coast Wine
Country towns of Paso Robles, San Luis Obispo, Ballard, and others,
sampling the region’s concerted efforts to demonstrate that not all
California wine comes from Napa Valley (see Chapter 21). If you have
little ones in tow or a strong affinity for good pastry, head inland to
Danish Solvang (also in Chapter 21), a storybook town straight out of
Scandinavia. Or visit Santa Barbara (see Chapter 22), a seaside jewel
that embodies the Southern California dream — perfect for clocking in
some top-quality relaxation time — and then take a break in the restful
surrounds of California’s own Shangri-La, the Ojai Valley.
The Southern California cities
Southern California is where things get crazy, in a good way. Certainly,
Los Angeles (see Chapter 23), the poster child for urban sprawl, isn’t 
for everybody. But think twice before you reject it out of hand. L.A.’s
charms may be subtle (after all, it’s easy to be popular when all your
goods are in your shop windows, so to speak), but they do exist. In addi-
tion to being celeb-rich and gloriously silly, it also happens to be the
state’s finest museum town. Really.
Do you really need us to tell you to go to Disneyland (see Chapter 24)?
Oh, all right. Just south of L.A. (behind the Orange Curtain, as Angelenos
are fond of saying), in Anaheim (Orange County), it is the Happiest Place
on Earth and the original theme park, and it’s an unadulterated blast for
kids of all ages (even grown-up ones with jobs and mortgages). Consider
visiting again even if you’ve been before, because you’re sure to find
plenty of new things to see and do — including the latest Disney park,
called California Adventure.
Almost midway between L.A. and San Diego are two spots to catch your
breath after a hectic urban odyssey. Beach lovers can park themselves
in the sand in quaint and calm Laguna Beach, perhaps occasionally get-
ting up long enough to browse the goods created by one of the area’s
many artists. Then follow the swallows to the hauntingly lovely adobe
ruins of San Juan Capistrano’s fabled mission (see Chapter 25).
In San Diego (see Chapter 27), you’ll find a wonderfully mellow vibe,
golden beaches galore, and plenty of memory-making diversions, most
notably three terrific animal parks: the San Diego Zoo, SeaWorld, and
the Wild Animal Park. If that’s not enough to keep you and the kids
happy and busy, also consider the multifaceted joys of Balboa Park (the
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 31

second-largest city park in the country, after the Big Apple’s Central
Park) and the metro area’s youngest theme-park addition, LEGOLAND,
which opened in 1999.
The Desert
Unlike the other destinations in this book — which are generally most
popular in summer and largely pleasant to visit year-round —
California’s desert is most fun to visit in any season except summer,
when the scorching heat can be a bit much to bear. Still, some people
enjoy summer in the desert, when prices are low and crowds are mini-
mal (just pack your sunscreen — SPF 30 or higher, preferably).
The Palm Springs area (see Chapter 26) is the place to go for desert
cool. This is the manicured side of the desert, where streets bear names
such as Frank Sinatra Drive, and golf greens, swimming pools, spa treat-
ments, and martinis rule the day. What’s more, easy access to unspoiled
nature makes Palm Springs appealing even to those who couldn’t care
less about the prefabricated glamour or retro-groovy stuff.
Scheduling Your Time
You gain no particular advantage by starting at one end of the state over
the other, so don’t worry about it. Just head north or south based on
what’s most convenient, appealing, and/or cost-efficient for you.
Following are some tips to help you map out your travel strategy. For
suggested itineraries that we’ve mapped out for you, see Chapter 4.
 Embrace the hugeness of California. You’ll drive a lot moving from
one destination to another, so factor that in when plotting your
strategy. If you’re the road-trip type, planning an ambitious itiner-
ary is fine. But if getting to really know a place is important to you,
you’ll want to make plans to settle in for a few days. Or if spending
too much time in the car with the kids is more like a chore than a
vacation, plan accordingly for that, too.
 If you have only one week, limit yourself to no more than three
destinations. If you don’t limit yourself, you’ll suffer from the “If it’s
Tuesday, it must be Big Sur” syndrome. If, for example, you’re tour-
ing Southern California, start with two days in San Diego, then two
days in Disneyland, and wrap it up with three days in L.A.
 Consider flying in to one airport and leaving from another. The
time saved by flying into L.A. and leaving from San Francisco, say,
or flying into San Jose and departing from Palm Springs, may be
worth the extra airline charges and/or rental-car drop-off charges.
What’s more, depending on your points of arrival and departure,
you may not even incur extra fees. Consider a couple of options
and price them out with the airlines and car companies (or put
your travel agent to work) before you decide.
Part I: Introducing California 
32

 Consider your drive part of the adventure. You can either drive
straight through without stopping or take a leisurely meander off
the beaten path — it depends on how adventurous you are and
how much unassigned time you have. California is a gorgeous state,
with lots to admire along just about any route you take. Be sure to
make time for unplanned stops and serendipitous side trips.
 Don’t try to cram too many activities into a day when you’ll be
making a long drive. Driving long distances can really sap your
energy. Estimated drive times in this book don’t include rest stops,
unforeseen traffic, or detours; unfortunately, traffic is only getting
worse, especially in L.A., one of the most congested cities in the
country. If you have time and energy to do more than drive and
check into your new hotel on big drive days, consider it a gimme;
use the time to relax. (After all, this is a vacation, remember?)
 Avoid ending up at a super-popular weekend destination on the
weekends. Restful destinations such as Napa Valley, Mendocino,
Carmel, Hearst Castle, Solvang, and Santa Barbara become human
zoos when urban dwellers escape the city for the weekend. Many
also require two-night minimums over the weekend, which can
throw a monkey wrench in your plans. Try, instead, to schedule
your city visits over the weekends and your retreat destinations
during the week.
Understanding California’s Climate
W.C. Fields once said, “California is the only state in the Union where you
can fall asleep under a rose bush in full bloom and freeze to death.”
Surely a gross exaggeration, right? Actually, no.
Don’t be fooled by what you think you know about California’s weather.
“Really,” you say, “I’ve seen Baywatch and The O.C. What’s there to
understand? California is all buffed bikini-clad bods and perpetual sun.”
Well, yes and no. Sometimes the reality lives up to the myth; sometimes
it doesn’t. Frankly, the weather isn’t that predictable.
The most important weather predictor is your location: coast or inland,
north or south. As a general rule, the weather is cool and windy along
the coastline — even in July and August — and warmer and perpetually
sunnier as you move inland. The climate is always warmer and sunnier
in inland Sacramento than in famously foggy San Francisco. (The tem-
perature drops again as you climb into the mountains to high-elevation
places such as Lake Tahoe.) Believe it or not, the rule even holds true in
the same city: Downtown Los Angeles is more often than not 10°F to 20°F
warmer than L.A.’s oceanside beach community, Santa Monica, which
benefits from cooling ocean breezes. Latitude matters, too; in general,
the southern coast — Santa Barbara and points south — sees better
beach weather than its northern counterparts.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 33

Part I: Introducing California 
34
One thing you can say for sure about California weather is how change-
able it is. The temperature may drop at night more than you’re used to;
in many places, both along the coast and inland, daytime temperatures
of 80°F and above may routinely drop into the low 40s in the evening.
Cool fog covers much of the coastline in the mornings, but if the sun
breaks through, temperatures soar by noon or so. The bottom line: Be
prepared for dramatic daily changes, even in summer. Layering your
clothes is always a good idea.
Revealing the Secret of the Seasons
California is seasonless to a certain degree — any time is a good time to
visit. The state benefits from glorious conditions year-round, with the
weather being generally warmer than most other mainland U.S. spots in
winter, and cooler and drier than most in summer.
One of the most surprising ticks in California’s weather pattern is that
summer generally starts late. As the temperature charts in Table 3-1
show, both San Francisco and Los Angeles (and virtually all points in
between) don’t really start warming up until July. Even blessedly sunny
L.A. is notorious for June gloom: Morning gray rolls in and stays until
afternoon.

On the upside, when the warm weather comes, it almost always stays
through September and usually well into October. (Unfortunately, in L.A.,
“warm” often means several days of really stinkin’ hot.) Indian summer
is common, and fall is universally the best season, weatherwise. In
September and October, the fog even lifts from perpetually misty spots
along the coast, such as Monterey and Mendocino. In places where the
weather starts to crisp in the fall, such as Tahoe, clear air and beautiful
colors make for gorgeous conditions.
If you’re coming to California to hit the beach in your bikini in January,
don’t count on it — this is not Hawaii. Still, the weather will likely be
milder here than where you’re from — swimming may not happen, but
strolling the sands under cloudless brilliant blue skies probably will. No
wonder so many people love visiting in winter — 50°F in San Francisco is
way better than Chicago’s, or even New York’s, parka weather. Tahoe is 
a prime spot for skiing, and snow-blanketed Yosemite is crowd-free and
magnificent. And we’ve often found the coastal destinations — particularly
Monterey and Big Sur — to be more pleasant, with clearer skies, in
December or January than in June or July. If you’re lucky, you may even
get a beach day in L.A. or San Diego in those months, when the occa-
sional 80°F day takes a bow.
Perusing a California Calendar of Events
Here’s a brief rundown of the Golden State’s top annual events:
 December–March: This is whale-watching season all along the
California coast. Mammoth gray whales migrate from the cold
Alaskan waters to warmer climes for their birthing season and then

transport their new pups back home. Just look out to sea for a
blow; the puff of steam can rise 12 feet from the whale’s blowhole.
The best place to watch for whales is Monterey, which celebrates
the annual migration with a two-week party in January called
Whalefest. For information, call % 831-649-6544 or go to www.
whalefestmonterey.com.
Mendocino holds its own celebration, the Mendocino Whale 
and Wine Festival, usually in early March (% 707-961-6303; www.
mendocinocoast.com).
 January 1: New Year’s Day sees the Tournament of Roses Parade,
the mother of all college bowl parades, descend upon Pasadena
(near Los Angeles) almost at the crack of dawn. Outrageous floats
constructed entirely of fresh roses and other flora compete for the
spotlight with high-volume marching bands and high-wattage
celebs making appearances. Although the festivities happen on
New Year’s Day, arrive the night before (bring supplies for sleeping
on the sidewalk, and remember, it gets quite nippy) if you want a
spot that lets you see anything. Call % 626-449-4100 or visit
www.tournamentofroses.com for grandstand tickets, official tour
packages, and other information.
 January–February: The Chinese New Year Festival and Parade in
San Francisco, the largest Chinese New Year’s celebration in the
United States, encompasses two weeks of excitement, the highlight
of which is a magnificent parade featuring the legendary Golden
Dragon. Events range from the Miss Chinatown USA pageant to

Five Great Trips
In This Chapter
 Exploring Northern California in ten days
 Seeing Southern California in ten days
 Bringing the kids along
 Taking a romantic trip for two
 Discovering the natural side of California
U
nderstand this right now: You will not see all of California. We
know actual native Californians who’ve lived here all their lives
and who continue to stumble upon new discoveries.
Still, it’s easy to see quite a bit of the Golden State, even if your vacation
time is short. In this chapter, we offer a few specific itineraries — ten-
day jaunts through Northern and Southern California, romantic idylls for
two, kid-friendly road trips, and forays into the wilds of the state — to
help you plan your own California dream of a trip.
The itineraries we suggest in this chapter give you an idea of what you
can see and do comfortably in the time you have. But remember that no
one ideal vacation plan exists. Use the itineraries in this chapter as you
see fit — either as proven, hard-and-fast plans, or simply as starting
blueprints that you can then customize to your own needs.
Seeing Northern California’s Highlights 
in Ten Days
On Day 1, fly in to San Francisco. Spend Day 2 and Day 3 enjoying the
City by the Bay (see Chapter 11 for more details on San Francisco).

Itinerary #1
After spending Day 4 in San Francisco, head to the Wine Country (see
Chapter 12) early on Day 5 and spend Day 5 and Day 6 getting to know
the area. For the ideal introduction, plan on a late-morning or early-
afternoon winery tour, perhaps one of the reservation-only tours at
Schramsberg or Robert Mondavi, or one of the terrific first-come, first-
served tours offered by Clos Pegase or St. Supéry. See two more wineries
after lunch, and mix it up with a little sightseeing or shopping before rest-
ing up for a gourmet feast at one of the valley’s stellar restaurants. Book
two months ahead if you want to eat at French Laundry, often named the
best restaurant in the United States. On the morning of Day 6, stop at one
of the valley’s gourmet markets to assemble a lunchtime picnic. Plan
some additional activities to mix in with your winery-going, such as a hot-
air balloon ride, a bit of bicycling, and/or a mud bath and massage.
On Day 7, head north from the Wine Country in the afternoon for
Redwood Country (see Chapter 14). Follow Highway 128 north to U.S.
101, and spend the night along the Redwood Highway, perhaps in charm-
ing, Victorian Ferndale. On Day 8, meander down the Redwood
Highway, reaching Mendocino in time for dinner. Spend Day 9 exploring
Mendocino (see Chapter 13), hiking the headlands, shopping, or just
enjoying the wild beauty of the misty North Coast.
On Day 10, drive back to San Francisco for your flight home.
You can easily trim this itinerary to eight days by cutting a day off your
time in San Francisco and limiting your Redwood Country exploring to a
day trip.
Itinerary #2
Depart San Francisco on Day 4 for the Monterey Peninsula. Leave in the
morning and spend the day playing on the boardwalk and the beach in
Santa Cruz, arriving in Monterey in time for dinner. If there are just the
two of you and you’re looking for romance, consider Carmel as a base. If
your budget is generous, go all out and spend your nights on some of
the most spectacular real estate in the nation: Pebble Beach, the
California destination for golfers.
The Monterey Peninsula (see Chapter 18) deserves a good chunk of
time, so spend the evening of Day 4 and the following two nights here.
Start Day 5 at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. (Don’t forget to buy your
aquarium tickets in advance to save aggravating time in line.) In the
afternoon, rent bikes and follow Monterey’s gorgeous bayfront bike path
(suitable for all riders) for some spectacular views.
Spend Day 6 exploring the rest of the peninsula by car, including the jus-
tifiably famous 17-Mile Drive (viewable from that rented bike if you have
the energy). Spend the afternoon strolling through charming Carmel; if
the weather is chilly, bundle up for a walk along cypress-lined Carmel
Beach, one of the world’s most beautiful stretches of sand.
Part I: Introducing California 
40

On Day 7, drive through gorgeous Big Sur (see Chapter 19) to San
Simeon and Hearst Castle, which we discuss in Chapter 20. Resist the
urge to stop much along the way (you’ll have time for that later). Arrive
at your base in nearby Cambria in time to see the elephant seals basking
in the sun just north of San Simeon and do a little exploring in Cambria
before a leisurely dinner.
Dedicate Day 8 to Hearst Castle. Book yourself a morning tour and an
afternoon tour, with time for a flick in the five-story-high iWERKS format
at the castle visitor center in between (this makes for good resting-your-
tootsies time).
Day 9 is for exploring awesome Big Sur. In fact, spend the night along
the Big Sur coast so that you have plenty of hiking and/or contemplation
time.
Fly home on Day 10. Consider flying out of San Jose to avoid the drive
back to the San Francisco airport.
Seeing Southern California’s Highlights 
in Ten Days
On Day 1, fly into Los Angeles. Spend Day 2 and Day 3 enjoying
Tinseltown. Check out Chapter 23 for additional details about Los
Angeles.
Itinerary #1
On Day 4, go to Disneyland (see Chapter 24). In fact, consider making
the hour’s drive south on the evening of Day 3 so that you can be first in
the park in the morning. (You may even be able to get a jump-start on the
masses with an early entrance, a perk currently enjoyed by Disneyland
Resort hotel guests, though that may be dropped by the time you read
this.) Spend the evening of Day 4 in Anaheim so that you’ll have an entire
day in the park. In fact, you may want to consider spending the better
part of Day 5 at Disneyland as well, especially if you want to see the
California Adventure park. You may also want to split up your park time if
you have little kids who’ll tire out easily, if your own theme-park stamina
is low, or if you’re visiting at a peak time with long lines and wait times
for rides. If you’ve had your fill of Disneyland by Day 5, spend that day
relaxing by the pool, soaking up some of those California rays.
In any case, head south to San Diego (see Chapter 27) in time for dinner on
Day 5 so that you can start your animal-park adventures early on Day 6.
Whether you have the kids with you or not, don’t miss the San Diego
Zoo; hyped though it may be, there is a reason it’s a major attraction. On
Day 7, choose between spending the day at SeaWorld, taking your lit-
tlest ones on an excursion to LEGOLAND, or treating your older kids to
the Wild Animal Park. Or, if you’ve had enough theme-park fun for one
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Trips 41

trip, split your day between San Diego’s culture-rich Balboa Park and
the beach.
After all this running around, you deserve some rest-and-relaxation time.
On Day 8, head to Palm Springs and spend Day 9 relaxing under the
desert sun. You can also get in some quality time on the fairway or some
pampering at the spa (or both, if you’re so inclined). If the desert isn’t
your bag, try the small seaside town of Laguna Beach or check out the
fabled mission of San Juan Capistrano (see Chapter 25).
If you’d rather avoid a lot of running around, simply stay put in San
Diego on Day 8 and Day 9 — it’s another terrific place to kick back —
and fly out from there on Day 10. Either way, you’ll be relaxed and con-
tented enough to head home on Day 10, whether you leave from Palm
Springs International or San Diego’s airport (if you’ve stayed put) or take
the easy two-hour drive back to Los Angeles.
Itinerary #2
If theme parks aren’t your style, head to Palm Springs (see Chapter 26)
in the late afternoon of Day 4, arriving in time for an alfresco dinner. On
Day 5, take a desert excursion with Desert Adventures Jeep Eco-Tours.
Spend Day 6 golfing, spa-ing, or just sitting by the pool sipping fruity
drinks garnished with umbrellas.
On Day 7, head west again, skirting L.A. as you head northwest to lovely
Santa Barbara (see Chapter 22), arriving in time for dinner.
If you’re driving on a weekday, be sure to pass through L.A. before 3 p.m.
to avoid getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.
Spend Day 8 and Day 9 hanging out in Santa Barbara, Southern
California’s loveliest beach town. If you’re not the beach type (or if the
weather’s just not beachy), and you feel as if you’ve seen and done it 
all by midday on Day 9, explore Santa Barbara’s Wine Country or 
head to Solvang (see Chapter 21) for a slice of Scandinavia, Southern
California–style. Or consider spending a night in the small town of Ojai
(about half an hour southeast of Santa Barbara — see Chapter 22), where
artists congregate and the setting sun turns the bluffs pink every night.
The drive is an easy 100 miles back to L.A. on Day 10, your day to fly
home.
Discovering California with Kids
Kids love California as much as adults do — it’s sort of like a giant play-
ground with all the latest toys. If you’re traveling with kids, you won’t
have a problem finding things to do; the trick is fitting it all in.
Part I: Introducing California 
42

Itinerary #1
On Day 1, fly the brood in to San Diego. Spend Day 2 and Day 3 enjoy-
ing the local animal parks.
Check out of your San Diego hotel on the morning of Day 4 and head
north to either LEGOLAND in nearby Carlsbad with the little ones or the
San Diego Wild Animal Park, in Escondido, with older kids
Both parks make easy stops along the way to Anaheim, where you want
to check in to your hotel, have an early dinner, and rest up for your big
day at Disneyland. Spread your park time over two days, Day 5 and 
Day 6, to avoid burnout — your own and the kids’.
On the morning of Day 7, head north to L.A. Base yourself at the beach
for maximum fun. Visit Universal Studios on Day 8.
On Day 9, make the short (two-hour) drive north to cutesy, Danish-
themed Solvang, which your younger kids are bound to enjoy — 
especially if they like pastries.
On Day 10, head north to Monterey, stopping in San Luis Obispo for a
pleasant lunch break (it’s just about exactly at the midpoint of the four-
hour drive). The peninsula features plenty to entertain you and the kids
on Day 11 and Day 12; the Aquarium, of course, is a must.
Spend Day 13 on the beach and boardwalk at Santa Cruz, California’s
historic seaside amusement park (see Chapter 17). It’s a real joy, and a
must-do for families. You can see the boardwalk in a few ways: You can
make it a day trip from your base in Monterey or enjoy it on your way to
San Francisco (from where you’re presumably flying out on Day 14).
However, we recommend spending the night in Santa Cruz so that you
can enjoy the neon-lit rides and lively arcades after dark, which is espe-
cially fun in summer.
Only a half-hour or so from Santa Cruz, San Jose makes the perfect
departure point for your homebound flight on Day 14.
Itinerary #2
Fly into San Francisco on Day 1. The City by the Bay has plenty of kid
appeal — in fact, more than enough to occupy Day 2 and Day 3. Chap-
ter 11 can help you formulate a sightseeing plan.
On Day 4, drive to Yosemite National Park, where you can spend Day 5
and Day 6. It’s an ideal place for kids to discover and enjoy the natural
world. (If the weather’s warm, consider staying in the tent cabins, 
which offer both creature comforts and a kid-friendly resemblance to
camping.)
On Day 7, head back to the coast, basing everyone in Monterey or Santa
Cruz on Day 8 and Day 9 for area exploring.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Trips 43

Drive south on Day 10, spending the night in Solvang. If you choose to
spend the day at L.A.’s Universal Studios, leave this mini-Denmark early
on Day 11.
The distance from Monterey all the way to L.A. is one heckuva drive, so
if you’d like to wake up in L.A. on the morning of Day 11, we recommend
departing Monterey or Santa Cruz on the afternoon of Day 9 and basing
yourself in the Hearst Castle area before heading south on Day 10. In
fact, you’ll even have time to catch a castle tour in the morning before
you set out, if you want.
Head to Anaheim on the evening of Day 11 to spend Day 12 at
Disneyland (see Chapter 24).
Depart Anaheim early on Day 13 to make the hour’s drive south to San
Diego with plenty of time to enjoy LEGOLAND, the San Diego Zoo, the
Wild Animal Park, or SeaWorld — pick one for your pleasure. Schedule
a late flight out on Day 14 to finish up at another park — and the kids
will sleep on the way home like the angels they are.
If you’d like to spend more time in San Diego without adding another day
to your trip, consider cutting back a day in San Francisco; leave the city
on the afternoon of Day 3, arriving at Yosemite in time for dinner.
California in Two Weeks for Romance-Seeking
Couples
Fly in to San Francisco on Day 1. Spend Day 2 and Day 3 enjoying the
most romantic city in the United States. See Chapter 11 for a recom-
mended sightseeing plan of San Francisco.
Itinerary #1
Head north on Day 4. If you don’t mind a long drive, consider the coastal
route on your way up, which winds through lovely, artsy seaside towns.
Stop at misty Mendocino (see Chapter 13), where picnicking, bike riding,
strolling the charming seaside village, and snuggling up in front of a roar-
ing fire in the evening are the primary orders of business. Frankly, towns
don’t get any more romantic, so spend Day 5 here, too.
On the afternoon of Day 6, pick up curvaceous Highway 128 just south
of Mendocino and follow it into the Wine Country (see Chapter 12). Set
up camp at one of the valleys’ romantic B&Bs (the Milliken Creek Inn is a
great choice), and wine and dine on Day 7 and Day 8.
On Day 9, cut south, back toward the coast, and make magical Carmel-
by-the-Sea your love nest from which to explore the Monterey Peninsula
over Day 10 and Day 11. If the weather’s good, work in an afternoon
kayaking among the elephant seals and sea otters in Monterey Bay
Part I: Introducing California 
44

(see Chapter 18). And don’t forget to take a romantic stroll along jaw-
droppingly beautiful Carmel Beach.
Leave the Monterey area early on Day 12 to give you the entire day to
meander through Big Sur (see Chapter 19) on your way to Hearst Castle
(see Chapter 20). Make Cambria your area base and dedicate Day 13 to
touring Xanadu.
On Day 14, drive back to San Francisco (or the San Jose or the
Monterey airport, both a tad closer) to catch a late-day flight home.
Itinerary #2
Spend Day 4 in San Francisco, and on Day 5 head directly to the Wine
Country. Dedicate Day 5 and Day 6 to touring the romantic, adult-
oriented region (see Chapter 12).
On Day 7, drive to Carmel (or to the Casa Palermo in Pebble Beach, if
you have the bucks) and settle in for Monterey Peninsula sightseeing on
Day 8 and Day 9 (see Chapter 18).
On Day 10, meander through Big Sur country, arriving in Cambria (see
Chapter 20) in time for a candlelit dinner (the Sow’s Ear makes a good
choice). Make Day 11 your castle day — and because you’re in the
romantic mood, ask your guide for tales of Clark Gable and Carole
Lombard’s visits to “the ranch.”
Take Day 12 to drive south along the Central Coast to Santa Barbara
(see Chapter 22), a great place to spend Day 13 at the beach.
On Day 14, drive the easy two hours south to the Los Angeles airport to
catch a flight home.
California in Two Weeks for Nature Lovers
These two nature-loving itineraries start from Los Angeles.
Itinerary #1
Fly into Los Angeles on Day 1 — and leave immediately. Drive two hours
east to discover the desert beauty of Palm Springs (see Chapter 26). 
(Or avoid the drive by flying directly into Palm Springs.) Spend Day 2
exploring wild, fascinating, untrammeled Joshua Tree National Park
(see Chapter 26), an excursion that should take the entire day.
Spend the morning of Day 3 lazing by the pool. After lunch, head out 
of Palm Springs, skirting L.A. again as you head northwest to Santa
Barbara (see Chapter 22).
If you’re traveling on a weekday, make sure you pass through L.A. before
3 p.m. to avoid getting stuck in rush-hour traffic.
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Great Trips 45

Spend Day 4 relaxing in the lovely beach town of Santa Barbara, and
then head to Big Sur (see Chapter 19) on Day 5. We highly recommend
spending at least one night here among the trees, so that you can enjoy
this spectacular coast on Day 6, too.
On Day 7, head to the Monterey Peninsula (see Chapter 18), where you
should park yourself in Pacific Grove for the best outdoors experience
today and on Day 8.
On Day 9, make the drive to Yosemite National Park (see Chapter 16),
and spend Day 10 and Day 11 exploring the park; head for the High
Country if you want to avoid crowds, but be sure to dedicate a half-day
to seeing the icons of Yosemite Valley first.
On Day 12, head north to Lake Tahoe (see Chapter 15). Spend Day 13
admiring this magnificent lake and its surroundings. Schedule a late-day
flight out of Reno so that you have most of Day 14 to play, too.
Itinerary #2
Fly in to Los Angeles on Day 1 and get a good night’s rest for the mam-
moth 300-mile drive to Death Valley National Park (see Chapter 26) on
Day 2. Expect it to be a looooong driving day.
Spend Day 3 and Day 4 exploring the vast expanses of the park.
(Consider renting a four-wheel-drive vehicle if you want to explore some
of the primitive park’s backcountry roads.)
On Day 5, drive out of Death Valley on the western side and take the 
I-395 route north to the east (Tioga Pass) entrance of Yosemite National
Park (see Chapter 16). Again, plan on another full day of driving. Spend
Day 6 and Day 7 exploring the park.
Yosemite’s Tioga Pass entrance is closed from the first snowfall, which
usually occurs in November, until mid- to late June. Call ahead (% 209-
372-0200) to check road conditions around these times.
On Day 8, drive out of the park’s south entrance and head to the
Monterey Peninsula (see Chapter 18). Make forested Pacific Grove your
base here on Day 8 and Day 9 for the best outdoors experience.
On Day 10, head to Big Sur (see Chapter 19), staying to enjoy this won-
derful wilderness on Day 11 as well.
On Day 12, meander south along the view-endowed Pacific Coast
Highway to Santa Barbara (see Chapter 22), one of the most naturally
blessed towns in the United States; it’s a good place to rest up on Day 13
for the flight home from Los Angeles on Day 14.

Planning Your Trip 
to California

In this part . . .
I
n this part, we discuss your travel options: how to get to
California and how to get around after you arrive; how to
plan a trip around your budget; and whether to go the pack-
age-tour route. This part offers savvy travel advice for travel-
ers with special needs. This part also helps you ﬁnalize those
little last-minute details, such as making dinner reservations
at hot local restaurants and weighing your travel-insurance
options. No glamour here — but all necessary.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Adding up the elements: transportation, lodging, dining, and sightseeing
 Using AAA to your advantage — and other ways to trim expenses
 Getting cost-cutting tips for wallet-watchers
“S
o — how much is this trip going to cost me, anyway?”
The question is a reasonable one, no matter where your budget sits on
the spending ladder. A vacation is a considerable endeavor, with costs
that can add up before you know it — especially if you’re traveling with
kids, when expensive admission tickets and pricier-than-you-thought
meals can multiply the damage in the blink of an eye. Therefore, knowing
what to expect before you go makes sense.
Planning Your Budget
The good news is that structuring a California trip to suit any budget 
is relatively easy. Sure, you can rub elbows with high-profile celebs or
dot-com millionaires by choosing to stay at ultraluxurious resorts and
dine at elegant restaurants, but you don’t have to; plenty of affordable
choices exist in every destination. Sure, you can spend tons of money 
at many excellent high-ticket attractions, from the Monterey Bay
Aquarium to Disneyland, but pursuing such pleasures as a stroll on 
the beach or a mountain hike carries no admission price whatsoever.
Whatever your tastes, this section helps you figure out where your
money’s going to go and what you can afford to do.
Totaling transportation costs
Most visitors to California fly in and rent a car to get around this mam-
moth state. The following sections help you budget enough for comfort-
able transportation wherever you want to go.

Booking airfare
Airfare is one of the two big-ticket items of your California trip (the other
is lodging). Predicting airfares is almost impossible, because they can fall
to new lows or go through the roof at the drop of a hat. We can tell you,
however, that California’s main airports — San Francisco, Los Angeles,
and San Diego — tend to get so much air traffic (and, therefore, generate
so much competition) that airfares are usually lower than if you’re fly-
ing into less competitive markets elsewhere in the country. And both
Northern and Southern California have alternative airports that are even
cheaper, especially with the expansion of low-fare carriers. Oakland, for
example, is generally cheaper to fly in and out of than San Francisco.
Southwest Airlines serves Oakland, and United has lower fares in and out
of Oakland (again, generally). In Southern California, Burbank is another
smaller airport beloved by Southwest, and Long Beach is the tiny home
to JetBlue and its amazing deals from New York City.
Don’t quote us, because prices can always vary, but expect to pay in the
neighborhood of $400 to $600 per person for a coast-to-coast flight.
You’ll pay less if you plan well in advance, stay over on a Saturday night,
or get lucky and catch a fare sale; see Chapter 6 for tips on getting the
best airfare.
Be sure to check out airfares within California as well. Thanks to the
variety of low-fare carriers, prices are usually quite reasonable. At press
time, for example, the advance-purchase fare between Oakland and San
Diego was just $73 one-way. One of these lower fares may allow you to
fly into California through one airport and return home via a second air-
port. (But don’t forget to factor in any rental-car drop-off charges before
booking.)
Renting a car
Rental cars are relatively cheap in the Driving State. You can often get a
compact car for between $100 and $200 a week, depending on your
dates and where you pick up your car. (Southern California rentals are
usually cheaper.) If you want a vehicle meant to haul your family, expect
to pay more like $200 to $300 a week — frankly, still quite reasonable.
Do yourself a favor and book a rental car with unlimited mileage. You’ll
be doing a lot of driving as you travel within California, and you don’t
want to end up paying for your rental on a per-mile basis — you’ll end
up on the short end of this stick.
And because you’ll probably cover a good deal of ground, don’t forget to
factor in gas, which at press time was hovering around $3 a gallon (in
California, prices vary greatly in different parts of the state). Parking is
another cost factor, especially in the cities; play it safe and budget $10 to
$20 a day, more if you’re spending lots of time in the cities. Also remem-
ber to account for any additional insurance costs.
For further details on renting a car in California, see Chapter 7.

Paying for lodging
California has a wealth of luxury hotels and resorts, but it also offers
plenty of affordable choices. The cities specialize in business- and
tourist-oriented hotels, while the smaller destinations feature standard
hotels, bed-and-breakfasts, and motels, plus destination resorts in some
locales. We recommend a range of choices in each of the destinations
covered in this book so that you have suitable options, no matter what
your needs or budget.
In the destination chapters in this book, a number of dollar signs, rang-
ing from one ($) to five ($$$$$), follows each hotel name. These dollar
signs represent the median price for a double room per night, as follows:

Expensive but not ridiculous: $226 to $300
$$$$$
Ultraluxurious: more than $300 per night
In general, you’ll find that if you budget between $100 and $175 to spend
per night, you’ll be able to balance your costs. Make economical choices
in the more affordable locations so that you can comfortably handle any
pricier destinations down the road, such as Carmel. Staying cheaply
when possible will make digging a little deeper into your pockets later
on easier to bear.
So that you don’t encounter any unwanted surprises at payment time,
be sure to account for the taxes that will be added to your final bill. The
base hotel tax is 14 percent, but some municipalities add an additional
surcharge, bringing taxes as high as 25 percent in some cities. We note
the taxes you can expect to pay in the hotel section of each destination
chapter in Parts II, III, and IV.
Dining with dollars
California prides itself on its culinary prowess, but prepare to pay for
that prowess; dining out tends to be rather expensive, especially in
tourist-targeted destinations such as the Wine Country. Main courses
can run from $12 to $22 on the average dinner menu. Throughout this
book, however, we make an effort to recommend a range of choices in
every destination so that you have options, no matter what your needs
or budget.
In the destination chapters, a number of dollar signs, ranging from one
($) to five ($$$$$), follows each restaurant name. The dollar signs are
meant to give you an idea of what a complete dinner for one person —
including appetizer, main course, one drink, tax, and tip — will likely set
you back. The price categories go like this:
Symbol
Meaning
$
Cheap eats: $15 or less per person
$$
Still inexpensive: $16 to $25
$$$
Moderate: $26 to $40
$$$$
Pricey: $41 to $70
$$$$$
Ultraexpensive: more than $70 per person
Of course, just about any menu has a range of prices, and the final tally
depends on how you order. The wine or bar tab is more likely to jack up
the bill quicker than anything else; desserts also add to the total.

Saving on sightseeing and activities
Sightseeing admission charges and other activity fees can add up
quickly, especially if you’re traveling with kids. Of course, how much you
spend depends on what you want to do. If you’re traveling to California
largely to discover its scenic towns and natural wonders, you won’t have
to budget much for sightseeing. Admission to national and state parks is
minimal, and activities such as hiking, picnicking, and beachcombing are
absolutely free (except for the cost of refreshments). Even bike and
kayak rentals are inexpensive.
But if you’re planning to visit the big-name sightseeing attractions —
especially the theme parks — know what your budget can handle. These
destinations can be expensive: Expect to pay about $41 per person just
to get in the door at Disneyland, the same at Universal Studios, $39 at
SeaWorld, $18 at the San Diego Zoo, and $20 at the Monterey Bay
Aquarium. (Needless to say, the Southern California theme-park loop
won’t be cheap.) Admission is slightly cheaper for kids — but don’t
worry, they’ll find plenty of ways to spend the difference and then some.

In the destination chapters in this book, we tell you how much you can
expect to pay for admission fees and activities so that you can budget
your sightseeing money realistically.
Allotting funds for shopping and entertainment
Shopping is a huge temptation in California. Many of the state’s finest
small towns are rich in unique boutiques and other shopping opportuni-
ties. We dare you to escape Napa Valley (see Chapter 12) without spend-
ing money on wine or other goodies. But places such as Mendocino (see
Chapter 13) and Carmel (see Chapter 18) are so pleasant just to stroll
through that, if your budget’s tight, you won’t suffer if you limit yourself
to window-shopping while you’re there.
Don’t blow a wad at the theme-park souvenir stands. Anything you buy
at Disneyland is available at your local mall’s Disney Store. And your
teenager doesn’t need another Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt. Save your dough
for something special — a one-of-a-kind souvenir that will recall vivid
memories of happy vacation times. Or a really good pair of shoes, at
least.
The cities are loaded with nightlife and entertainment options. You can
spend a hundred bucks on a pair of theater tickets or nurse a couple of
$3 beers in a friendly bar all night — the choice is entirely up to you and
your wallet. Outside of the cities, California tends to be quiet after dark,
although college towns such as Santa Barbara and resort destinations
such as Palm Springs are exceptions.
Keeping a Lid on Expenses
We don’t care how much money you have, but we do know that you
don’t want to spend more than you have to. In this section, we help you
rein in your expenses before they get out of control.
Getting the best airfare
This is such a huge topic that we’ve dedicated the better part of a chap-
ter to it. Before you even start scanning for fares, see Chapter 6 (also see
Chapter 7 if you’re interested in traveling within California by plane).
Booking accommodations — and 
avoiding the rack-rate scam
The rack rate is the equivalent of the suggested retail price for your
hotel room. Don’t be unduly alarmed by the prices listed for some of the
hotels — many a $300 hotel never charges $300 a night for a room. The
best way to avoid paying the full rack rate when booking your hotels is
stunningly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised. But you have to take the initiative and ask,
because no one is going to volunteer to save you money.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
54

Taking the AAA advantage
If you aren’t already a member, consider taking a few minutes to join the
American Automobile Association (AAA) before you launch your
California vacation. Unfamiliar roads, unpredictable drivers, unforeseen
circumstances (a flat that needs fixing, a battery that needs jump-
starting), and unexplainable moments of stupidity (hello, lockout!) are
just a few of the reasons for hooking into the club’s roadside assistance
network before you leave home.
But AAA membership offers much more than the occasional roadside
rescue. Membership can save you money on hotel rates and admission
to attractions throughout California (and other locations). Also included
in the annual dues is a mind-boggling array of travel-related and general
lifestyle services, as well as comprehensive maps. The AAA Travel
Agency can help you book air, hotel, and car arrangements as well as all-
inclusive tour packages — and the staff will always let you know when a
AAA member discount is available. American Express traveler’s checks
are available to members at no charge (see the “Handling Money” sec-
tion later in this chapter for more information on traveler’s checks).
To find the AAA office nearest you, log on to www.aaa.com, where you’ll
be linked to your regional club’s home page after you enter your home
zip code. You can get instant membership by calling the national 24-hour
emergency roadside service number (% 800-AAA-HELP), which can con-
nect you to any regional membership department during expanded busi-
ness hours (only roadside assistance operates 24 hours a day). If you 
live in Canada, the Canadian Automobile Association (% 613-247-0117;
www.caa.ca) offers similar services (plus reciprocal benefits with AAA).
Cutting costs, but not the fun
In addition to the suggestions we discuss in the preceding sections, here
are some other potential money-saving tips:
 Always mention membership in AAA, AARP, or frequent-flier/
frequent-traveler programs. You may also qualify for corporate,
student, military, or senior discounts.
 Call the hotel directly and also call the central reservations toll-
free number. We’ve found that it’s worth the extra pennies to make
both calls and find out which one gives you the better deal.
Sometimes the local reservationist knows about special deals or
packages, but the hotel may neglect to tell the central booking line.
We think phoning the hotel directly is especially important if you
have questions about room configurations and amenities. The nice
folks manning the phones at central reservations don’t actually
know anything more about the individual hotels than what they
may have read on a brochure. For the most accurate information,
talk to the reservations manager at the hotel.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 55

 Consult a reliable travel agent. Even if you’ve already booked your
own airfare, you may find that a travel agent can negotiate a better
price with certain hotels than you can get on your own. For more
advice on the pros and cons of using an agent, see Chapter 6.
 Bed-and-breakfasts are generally nonnegotiable on price.
However, always ask whether a price break is available midweek or
during the off-season; in fact, you’ll find that many B&Bs publish
discounted midweek and off-season rates.
 Study this book. Keep your eyes posted for the Bargain Alert icon
as you read this book. This icon highlights money-saving opportu-
nities and especially good values throughout the Golden State.
 Travel midweek to popular weekending destinations. Rates to
destinations such as the Wine Country, Carmel, the Hearst Castle
area, Solvang, and Santa Barbara are at their highest on the week-
ends. Schedule your visits to the cities on weekends, when busi-
ness travelers abandon San Francisco, L.A., and San Diego hotels,
leaving them open to bargain-hunting vacationers.
 Check the hotel listings in this book. In the destination chapters,
we note the types of discounts that each hotel, B&B, or motel tends
to offer. We can’t guarantee what discounts may apply when you
reserve, of course, but these tips should give you a heads-up on the
kinds of special deals or discounted rates to ask for when you book.
 Remember that summer — June through mid-September — is the
busy season. If you haven’t decided on a travel time yet, consider
the off-seasons, which are not only cheaper and less crowded but
often more pleasant, weather-wise. See Chapter 3 for lots of helpful
guidance.
 Try a package tour. For many destinations, you can book airfare,
hotel, ground transportation, and even some sightseeing just by
making one call to a travel agent or packager, for a price much less
than if you put the trip together yourself. (See Chapter 6 for more
on package tours.)
 Try expensive restaurants at lunch instead of dinner. Lunch tabs
are usually a fraction of what dinner would cost at a top restaurant,
and the menu often boasts many of the same specialties.
 Get out of town. In many places, big savings are just a short drive
or taxi ride away. Hotels just outside the city, across the river, or
less conveniently located are great bargains. Outlying motels often
have free parking, with lower rates than downtown hotels offering
amenities that you may never use. Sure, at a motel you’ll be carry-
ing your own bags, but the rooms are often just as comfortable and
a whole lot cheaper.
 Walk a lot. A good pair of walking shoes can save money on taxis
and other local transportation. As a bonus, you’ll get to know your
destination more intimately, as you explore at a slower pace.

Handling Money
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what alternative form of currency is your favorite. That’s not going to
change much on your vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving around
more and incurring more expenses than you generally, and you may let
your mind slip into vacation gear and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode. But, those factors aside, the only
type of payment that won’t be quite as available to you away from home
is your personal checkbook.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine). The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.
mastercard.com) and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) net-
works span the globe; look at the back of your bank card to find out
which network you’re on, and then call or check online for ATM loca-
tions at your destination. 
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN, but most banks
charge their highest rate of interest on cash advances. If you’ve forgot-
ten yours, or didn’t know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you.
Toting traveler’s checks
These days, traveler’s checks are less necessary than in the past
because most cities have 24-hour ATMs that allow you to withdraw cash
as needed. 
You can get traveler’s checks at almost any bank. You’ll pay a service
charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. You can also get American
Express traveler’s checks over the phone by calling % 800-221-7282;
Amex gold and platinum cardholders who use this number are exempt
from the 1 percent fee.
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks, in case they’re stolen or lost.
You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 57

Dealing with a Lost or Stolen Wallet
Be sure to contact all your credit-card companies the minute you dis-
cover your wallet has been lost or stolen and file a report at the nearest
police precinct. Your credit-card company or insurer may require a
police-report number or a record of the loss. Most credit-card compa-
nies have an emergency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or
stolen; the company may be able to wire you a cash advance immedi-
ately or deliver an emergency credit card in a day or two. Call the follow-
ing emergency numbers in the United States:
 American Express: % 800-221-7282 (for cardholders and trav-
eler’s check holders)
 MasterCard: % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111
 Visa: % 800-847-2911 or 410-581-9994
For other credit cards, call the toll-free number directory at 
% 800-555-1212.
If you need emergency cash over the weekend when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-397-
3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289; www.
transunion.com). Finally, if you’ve lost all forms of photo ID, call your
airline and explain the situation; the airline may allow you to board the
plane if you have a copy of your passport or birth certificate and a copy
of the police report you’ve filed.

In this chapter, we give you the information you need to decide what’s

Who Flies Where
The major California airports include
 San Francisco International Airport (SFO), 14 miles south of 
downtown San Francisco via U.S. 101 (% 650-821-8211; www.
flysfo.com)
 Sacramento International Airport, north of downtown Sacramento
on I-5, just past the junction with Highway 99 (% 916-929-5411;
www.sacairports.org)
 San Jose International Airport, gateway to the Silicon Valley, just
north of the U.S. 101/I-880/Highway 17 junction, at the intersection
of U.S. 101 and Highway 87 (% 408-501-7600; www.sjc.org)
 Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), at the intersection of the
I-405 and I-105 freeways, 91⁄2 miles south of Santa Monica and 16
miles southwest of Hollywood (% 310-646-5252; www.lawa.org)
 San Diego International Airport, locally known as Lindbergh Field,
on I-5 right in the heart of San Diego (% 619-400-2400; www.
san.org)

Chances are good that one of these major airports will be your gateway.
In addition, major carriers also serve good-size or smaller airports in
Oakland, just across the bay from San Francisco (see Chapter 11); in the
middle of the state in Fresno, close to the southern gateway to Yosemite
(see Chapter 16); in Reno, Nevada, less than an hour’s drive from Lake
Tahoe (see Chapter 15); on the northern Central Coast in Monterey (see
Chapter 18); in Orange County, just a stone’s throw from Disneyland 
(see Chapter 24); and in Palm Springs (see Chapter 26).
Because the Golden State is so darn big and has so many major airports,
you need to work out a basic itinerary for yourself before you book your
airline tickets. The destination chapters in this book help you do that, as
do the itineraries in Chapter 4.
Seriously consider flying into one California airport and leaving from
another. The time you save by flying into San Diego and leaving from San
Francisco, say, or flying into San Jose and departing from Palm Springs,
may justify the extra airline charges and/or rental-car drop-off charges.
What’s more, depending on your points of arrival and departure, you
may happily discover that no extra charges apply. Your best bet is to
have a couple of options and price them out with the airlines and car
companies (or put your travel agent to work) before you make a final
decision.
Tips for getting the best airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other
industry. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a
coach seat is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of
dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — often pay (or at least their com-
panies pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book
your ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to
travel midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday), you can qualify for
the least expensive price — usually a fraction of the full fare. On most
flights, even the shortest hops within the United States, the full fare is
close to $1,000 or more, but a 7- or 14-day advance-purchase ticket may
cost less than half of that amount. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
The airlines also periodically hold sales, in which they lower the prices
on their most popular routes. These fares have advance-purchase
requirements and date-of-travel restrictions, but you can’t beat the
prices. As you plan your vacation, keep your eyes open for these sales,
which tend to take place in seasons of low travel volume — for California,
that’s the winter months. You almost never see a sale around the peak
summer-vacation months of July and August, or around Thanksgiving or
Christmas, when many people fly, regardless of the fare they have to pay.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
60

Consolidators, also known as bucket shops, are great sources for interna-
tional tickets, although they usually can’t beat the Internet on fares
within North America. Start by looking in Sunday newspaper travel sec-
tions; U.S. travelers should focus on the New York Times, Los Angeles
Times, and Miami Herald.
Booking your flight online
The “big three” online travel agencies, Expedia (www.expedia.com),
Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com),
sell most of the air tickets bought on the Internet. (Canadian travelers
should try www.expedia.ca and www.travelocity.ca; U.K. residents
can go for expedia.co.uk and opodo.co.uk.) Each has different busi-
ness deals with the airlines and may offer different fares on the same
flights, so shopping around is wise. Expedia and Travelocity will also
send you an e-mail notification when a cheap fare becomes available to
your favorite destination. Of the smaller travel-agency Web sites,
SideStep (www.sidestep.com) receives good reviews from users.
Great last-minute deals are available through free weekly e-mail services
provided directly by the airlines. Most of these deals are announced on
Tuesday or Wednesday and must be purchased online. Most are only
valid for travel that weekend, but some (such as Southwest’s) can be
booked weeks or months in advance. Sign up for weekly e-mail alerts at
airline Web sites or check mega-sites that compile comprehensive lists
of last-minute specials, such as Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.
com). For last-minute trips, www.site59.com in the United States and
www.lastminute.com in Europe often have better deals than the major-
label sites.
Great last-minute deals are also available directly from the airlines them-
selves through a free e-mail service called E-savers. Each week, the air-
line sends you a list of discounted flights, usually leaving the upcoming
Friday or Saturday and returning the following Monday or Tuesday. You
can sign up for all the major airlines at one time by logging on to
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), or you can go to each indi-
vidual airline’s Web site. Airline sites also offer schedules, flight booking,
and information on late-breaking bargains.
Driving to California
Driving yourself to California can be a smart move, especially if you live
relatively close by and you’d prefer to tour the state in your own car.
The major interstates that lead into the state are as follows:
 I-5, which enters California from Oregon at the northern border and
runs south through the middle of the state all the way to San Diego
 I-80, which arrives from the east via Reno, Nevada, and runs west
through Sacramento to San Francisco
Chapter 6: Getting to California 61

 I-15, which connects Las Vegas, Nevada, with I-10 just east of 
Los Angeles
 I-40, which runs across the northern half of the southern states,
cutting through the Texas panhandle; Albuquerque, New Mexico;
and Flagstaff, Arizona, before entering California in Needles,
California (where Snoopy’s cousin Spike is from, if you’re a Peanuts
fan) — otherwise known as the middle of nowhere — and heading
west until it connects to I-15 northeast of Los Angeles
 I-10, the most popular route into Southern California, which runs
from New Orleans, Louisiana, to Los Angeles, passing through
Houston, Texas; Phoenix, Arizona; and Palm Springs along the way.
 I-8, which links Tucson and Yuma, Arizona, with San Diego

Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect at
each leg of your journey. You know your costs upfront and, in the case of
the tame ones, you don’t get many surprises. Escorted tours can take
you to the maximum number of sights in the minimum amount of time
with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, we strongly recommend pur-
chasing travel insurance, especially if the tour operator asks you to pay
upfront. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator! If the tour op-
erator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the vacation you
paid for, there’s no reason to think that it’ll fulfill its insurance obliga-
tions either. Get travel insurance through an independent agency. (We
tell you more about the ins and outs of travel insurance in Chapter 10.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the tour operator cancel the
trip if it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if
you’re unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the tour
operator cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours into a 24-hour day, or does it give you ample time to relax
by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m. every day and not
returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. at night sounds like a grind,
certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may be evasive about this, because they may not know the exact
size of the group until everybody has made reservations, but they
should be able to give you a rough estimate.
Chapter 6: Getting to California 63
Taking the train
Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) serves multiple California cities,
including San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Barbara, L.A., and San Diego.
Arriving by train from another state is much slower and not significantly cheaper than
traveling by plane. Therefore, explore this option only if you hate flying, saving a little
money means more to you than speed of travel, or you’re drawn to the romanticism of
a train journey. You’ll still need to rent a car to do any significant sightseeing, unless
you’d prefer to travel around California by train, too; for details, see Chapter 7.

 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if they don’t book enough
people. If a quota exists, find out what it is and how close the com-
pany is to reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their
answers, but the information may help you select a tour that’s sure
to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. Beer may be
included but not wine. How much flexibility do you have? Can you
opt out of certain activities, or does the bus leave once a day, with
no exceptions? Are all your meals planned in advance? Can you
choose your entree at dinner, or does everybody get the same
chicken cutlet?
Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who resell them to the public. It’s kind of like buying your vacation at a
buy-in-bulk store — except the tour operator is the one who buys the
1,000-count box of garbage bags and resells them 10 at a time at a cost
that undercuts the local supermarket.
Package tours can vary as much as those garbage bags, too. Some offer
a better class of hotels than others; others provide the same hotels for
lower prices. Some book flights on scheduled airlines; others sell char-
ters. In some packages, your choice of accommodations and travel days
may be limited. Some let you choose between escorted vacations and
independent vacations; others allow you to add on just a few excursions
or escorted day trips (also at discounted prices) without booking an
entirely escorted tour.
To find package tours, check out the travel section of your local Sunday
newspaper or the ads in the back of national travel magazines such as
Travel + Leisure, National Geographic Traveler, and Condé Nast Traveler.
Liberty Travel (% 888-271-1584; www.libertytravel.com) is one of
the biggest packagers in the Northeast, and usually boasts a full-page ad
in Sunday papers.
Another good source of package deals is the airlines themselves. Most
major airlines offer air/land packages, including American Airlines
Vacations (% 800-321-2121; www.aavacations.com), Delta Vacations
(% 800-221-6666; www.deltavacations.com), Continental Airlines
Vacations (% 800-301-3800; www.covacations.com), and United
Vacations (% 888-854-3899; www.unitedvacations.com). Several big
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
64

online travel agencies — Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz, Site59, and
Lastminute.com — also do a brisk business in packages. If you’re unsure
about the pedigree of a smaller packager, check with the Better Business
Bureau in the city where the company is based, or go online to www.
bbb.org. If a packager won’t tell you where it’s based, don’t fly with it.
If you’re considering either arriving in California by train or traveling
around the state by train — or both — check into the all-inclusive travel
packages offered by Amtrak Vacations (% 800-654-5748; www.amtrak
vacations.com).
If you’re an Amex customer, consider going through American Express
Travel (% 800-AXP-6898 or 800-346-3607; www.americanexpress.com/
travel), which can book packages through various vendors, including
Continental and Delta.
If you’re heading to Disneyland, you may want to contact the official
Disney travel agency, Walt Disney Travel Co. (% 800-225-2024 or
714-520-5050; www.disneyland.com). The company offers Disney-
focused packages that can also include a wide range of Southern
California extras, depending on your wants and needs. For more on this,
see Chapter 24.
Universal Studios Vacations offers all-inclusive L.A. vacation deals that
include a visit to its park; call % 800-711-0080 or go online to www.
universalstudiosvacations.com.
The well-conceived escorted tours of California offered by Tauck Tours
(% 800-788-7885; www.tauck.com) are more luxurious and less struc-
tured than your average escorted tour. They’re pricey but worth the
cost if you’d rather let someone else do the driving.
Be advised that most travel packagers don’t offer comprehensive
California vacations. They tend to focus on the large-volume 
destinations — San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Disneyland, and
sometimes Lake Tahoe and Palm Springs. If you want to hit other desti-
nations, you’ll likely have to (or have your travel agent) book those legs
of your trip directly. Still, don’t give up on the package route; with a little
planning, you (or your travel agent) may manage to link a few smaller
packages into the good-value vacation of your dreams.

Chapter 7
Getting Around California
In This Chapter
 Traveling around California by car (a rental or your own)
 Following the rules of the road
 Touring the Golden State by plane or train
F
orget the Golden State moniker — California is really the Driving
State. You need a car to get yourself around, no two ways about it.
Even if you choose to move from destination to destination using planes
and trains, you likely need an automobile after you get to your destina-
tion. The only California destinations that you can easily navigate via
other means of transportation are San Francisco, San Diego (some
attractions, not all), and Santa Barbara. It’s unfortunate, given that
California has perhaps the highest gas prices in the country.
Getting Around by Car
If you don’t bring your own car to California, you’ll probably need to
rent one. The following companies rent cars at locations throughout
California, including at all the major airports and in the cities:
 Alamo: % 800-462-5266; www.goalamo.com
 Avis: % 800-230-4898; www.avis.com
 Budget: % 800-527-0700; https://rent.drivebudget.com
 Dollar: % 800-800-4000; www.dollar.com
 Enterprise: % 800-325-8007; www.enterprise.com
 Hertz: % 800-654-3131; www.hertz.com
 National: % 800-227-7368; www.nationalcar.com
 Thrifty: % 800-847-4389; www.thrifty.com
Rental cars are relatively cheap in the Driving State. Of course, we can’t
guarantee what you’ll pay when you book, but you can often get a com-
pact car for between $100 and $200 a week, depending on your dates
and where you pick up your car. (Southern California rentals are usually

cheaper.) If you want a car large enough for an entire family, expect to
pay more like $200 to $300 a week, which is still quite reasonable.
We advocate flying into one airport and leaving from another so that you
can see as much of California as possible. And depending on your
pickup and drop-off points, you may find that you won’t have to pay
extra for your one-way car rental. No promises, but we’ve found that
more often than not, you won’t pay more than if you had picked up and
dropped off at the same location.
Price car rentals at the same time you price airfares to make sure that
flying into one city and out of another is cost-effective on both counts.
Check with a few companies before you make a final decision. If you get
a rate quote you like and decide that this is the way you want to go,
make your reservation (which will lock in your rate) immediately. This
will save you from getting taken to the cleaners after the fact — because
policies and prices can change at any time.
Getting the best deal on a rental car
Car-rental rates vary even more than airline fares. The price depends on
the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and when you
pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and a host of other factors.
Finding out about a few key details may save you hundreds of dollars.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask whether the rate is the same for pickup Friday morn-
ing as it is Thursday night.
 Some companies may assess a drop-off charge if you don’t return
the car to the same rental location; others, notably National, don’t.
 Check whether the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a loca-
tion in town rather than at the airport.
 Find out whether age is an issue. Many car-rental companies add
on a fee for drivers younger than 25, while some don’t rent to them
at all.
 If you see an advertised price in your local newspaper, be sure to
ask for that specific rate; otherwise, you may be charged the stan-
dard (higher) rate. And don’t forget to mention membership in
AAA, AARP, and trade unions. These memberships usually entitle
you to discounts ranging from 5 to 30 percent.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts. Not only are your favorite (or at
least most-used) airlines likely to send you discount coupons, but
most car rentals add at least 500 miles to your account.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all the
Chapter 7: Getting Around California 67

major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
Smarter Travel (www.smartertravel.com), for example — have
search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates.
In addition to the standard rental prices, other optional charges (and
some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes) apply to most car rentals.
The Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), which requires you to pay for
damage to the car in a collision, is covered by many credit-card compa-
nies. Check with your credit-card company before you go so that you
can avoid paying this hefty fee (as much as $20 a day).
The car-rental companies also offer additional liability insurance (if you
harm others in an accident), personal-accident insurance (if you harm
yourself or your passengers), and personal-effects insurance (if your lug-
gage is stolen from your car). Your insurance policy on your car at home
probably covers most of these unlikely occurrences. However, if your
own insurance doesn’t cover you for rentals or if you don’t have auto
insurance, definitely consider the additional coverage (ask your car-
rental agent for more information). Unless you’re toting around the 
Hope diamond — and you don’t want to leave that in your car trunk,
anyway — you can probably skip the personal-effects insurance, but
driving around without liability or personal-accident coverage is never a
good idea. Even if you’re a good driver, other people may not be, and 
liability claims can be complicated.
Some companies also offer refueling packages, in which you pay for your
initial full tank of gas upfront and then can return the car with an empty
gas tank. The prices can be competitive with local gas prices, but you
don’t get credit for any gas remaining in the tank. If you reject this
option, you pay only for the gas you use, but you have to return the car
with a full tank or face charges of $3 to $4 a gallon for any shortfall. If
you usually run late and a fueling stop may make you miss your plane,
you’re a perfect candidate for the fuel-purchase option.
Following the rules of the road
Know these rules of the road before you drive around California:
 All passengers must wear seatbelts at all times. No cheating in the
back seat. You must harness children under 4 years old or 40
pounds into an approved safety seat (some car-rental agencies now
rent these seats; ask when you reserve your car).
 Motorcyclists must wear helmets.
 You can turn right on red as long as a posted sign doesn’t say 
otherwise. Make sure you make a full stop first — no rolling.
 The maximum speed limit on most California freeways is 65 mph,
although some freeways carry a posted limit of 70 mph. For two-
lane undivided highways, the maximum speed limit is 55 mph,
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
68

unless otherwise posted. Speed limits vary in populated areas;
defaulting to 25 mph is smart if you’re not sure. California law
states that you must never drive faster than is safe for the present
conditions, regardless of the posted speed limit.
 You can pass on the right on the freeway as long as you act safely
and use a properly marked lane.
 Pedestrians always have the right of way both on crosswalks and
at uncontrolled intersections.
 Those kids you brought with you can come in handy. Some 
freeways, especially those in Southern California, have a High
Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane (otherwise known as a carpool
lane), which lets you speed past some of the congestion if three
people are in the car (sometimes two; read the signs). Don’t flout
the rules; if you do, expect to shell out close to $300 for the ticket.
 Always read street-parking signs and keep plenty of quarters on
hand for meters. Popular destinations and smaller towns with
parking crunches often have some of the most stringent rules and
gung-ho meter readers. Be extra-vigilant in metropolitan areas.
Save yourself some hassle and just get a roll of dedicated parking
quarters at your bank before you leave home.
 Check the Web for a complete rundown of California state driv-
ing guidelines. The complete California Driver Handbook is avail-
able online (www.dmv.ca.gov), and you can also find rules of the
road for motorcycles, RVs, and trailers.
In addition to following the rules of the road, include the following tips
among your driving practices:
 Always have a good statewide map on hand. You can get good
maps from AAA or the California Division of Tourism (you can even
download the official state map from the CDT Web site at www.
visitcalifornia.com).
 Know more about the direction you’re heading than simply
“north” or “south.” California’s freeway and highway signs indicate
direction, more often than not, by naming a town rather than a
compass point: To head east on I-10 to Palm Springs, say, you
follow the signs that say “Ontario” as you drive out of L.A., not the
ones that say “Santa Monica.” Review your map carefully so that
you know which way to go before you hit the road.
 Prepare your vehicle for the weather. If you’re heading to Yosemite
or Tahoe in winter, top off on antifreeze and bring snow chains. If
renting a car, ask the agency if chains are provided. Also, check road
conditions before you set out. Call the California Department of
Transportation (CALTRANS) at % 800-427-7623, which can fill you
in on conditions throughout the state at any time of year. You can
also check road and traffic conditions online at www.dot.ca.gov.
Chapter 7: Getting Around California 69

 Take along your cellphone or rent one. A cellphone can be an
invaluable lifeline as you drive throughout California. If you’re rent-
ing a car, you’re often able to rent a cellphone along with your vehi-
cle; ask when you call. You can also rent cellphones at airport
kiosks. Or, you can rent a phone before you leave home by calling
InTouchUSA (% 800-872-7626; www.intouchusa.com), which
rents wireless products and even evaluates your own phone’s call-
ing capabilities for free before you leave home. (Call % 703-222-
7161 9 a.m.–4 p.m.)
 Know how far you have to go. See Table 7-1 for some sample dis-
tances between California destinations.

Winging Your Way around California
If time is short and you want to cover great distances without the long
drive, consider flying between California locations. After all, an hour-
long flight can save you the entire travel day that driving between San
Francisco and Los Angeles or San Diego would consume. Even shorter
distances — L.A. to Monterey, say — can save you a good chunk of valu-
able vacation time. Airfares are generally reasonable, too, often between
$60 and $100 per leg.
The following airlines are well versed in shuttling passengers between
multiple California destinations:
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
70

 Alaska Airlines: % 800-252-7522; www.alaskaair.com
 American/American Eagle: % 800-433-7300; www.aa.com
 America West: % 800-235-9292; www.americawest.com
 Delta: % 800-221-1212; www.delta.com
 Southwest: % 800-435-9792; www.southwest.com
 United/United Express: % 800-241-6522; www.united.com
 US Airways: % 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com
For a rundown of California airports, see Chapter 6.
We can’t promise who’ll have the best deals when you’re booking, but
we’ve found that Southwest Airlines is often the cheapest and most con-
venient airline for traveling within California. Why? Three reasons:
 Tickets are sold by segments, which makes it cheap and easy to
buy one-way fares.
 Southwest’s full fares are comparatively low, so you may be able 
to change your itinerary without paying a ridiculous markup or
penalty, and you can often get a full refund (or at least a credit for a
future flight taken within one year of the original purchase) if you
can’t use the ticket.
 Internet specials often make the already low fares even lower.
Keep in mind that the airline saves money by skipping certain frills,
including seat assignments. You get a seat by using a boarding card, and
passengers are boarded in groups. 
Going the Amtrak Way
Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) runs trains throughout
California, including up and down the coast, serving destinations such
as Sacramento, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and
San Diego, and numerous points in between. Using Amtrak won’t save
you any time over driving and may not even save you money over flying.
Still, it’s an option if you’d rather not drive yourself and don’t like to fly,
or if you’re just enamored with the nostalgia of train travel.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Getting to know your options
 Finding the best room at the best rate
 Spinning the Web for a room
 Making your decision
O
n the one hand, you aren’t going to spend much time in your hotel
room if you’re doing even half the things we recommend in this
book. On the other hand, it is nice to know you have some place soft —
or cheap, depending on your priorities — to land when you drop at the
end of the day. This chapter helps you get the best deals on the right
place for your stay in California.
Getting to Know Your Options
Throughout California you have a range of accommodations to choose
from — something for every taste, need, budget, and even, in the case 
of San Luis Obispo’s Madonna Inn, fantasy. The larger the city, the
greater the range — although, perhaps not in all categories. Unlike San
Francisco, for example, Los Angeles has little in the way of adorable
B&Bs. L.A. also has little in the way of anything fabulous for those of us
whose wallets aren’t lined with gold. The smaller the town, the more
quaint the offerings — although generic chain hotels are still readily
available everywhere. Decide what’s important for you — price, style,
service — and go from there. See Table 8-1.

Table 8-1
Key to Hotel Dollar Signs

Price Range
What to Expect
Sign(s)

Less than $75
With a few precious exceptions — and we
do go on about them at great length — this
gets you basically a bed and motel-room 
furniture — unless, of course, you scored a
good deal on an otherwise pricey room usu-
ally found in a higher category. Towels are
likely to be of the depressingly thin variety,
and don’t expect top-brand toiletries. Remind
yourself that you’re there for the sunshine.
$$
$76–$150
This is a mixed-bag category. You could have
a very nice (though perhaps generic-looking)
hotel room in a fine establishment with all the
amenities. Or it could be even more posh. Or it
could be less so. Check each listing carefully.
$$$
$151–$225
The rooms move up in size and in stature —
stature of amenities, that is. You’re also likely
to be in a more convenient (and potentially
safer) neighborhood, and you’re almost sure
to have a lobby to walk through to get to your
room — another safety necessity.
$$$$
$226–$300
Now we’re talkin’. The service may be
snooty, but the linens are soft and you get
bathrobes and high-end amenities (nice
shampoo, lotion, shoe buffer). We’re also
willing to bet that the grounds are fabulously
landscaped.
$$$$$
$301 and up
In theory, you should have everything your
little heart could desire in this category, but
this is California, and sometimes you pay that
price just for the privilege of staying some-
where that pampers Jennifer Lopez. Not
being Jennifer Lopez, you may wonder what
the fuss is all about.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum rate a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency-exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 73

Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is surpris-
ingly simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be
pleasantly surprised. We encourage you not to fret about any rack rate
listed in this book. Often, reality differs dramatically.
Finding the best rate
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his business
toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free number may also result in
a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand, the cen-
tral reservations number may not know about discount rates at specific
locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special group rate
for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell the central
booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number and the toll-
free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy rates
rise and fall. You can expect higher prices during popular summer in
California, in addition to still sunny Christmastime, and any school holi-
day. Lower rates should turn up during the winter. But even within a given
season, room prices are subject to change without notice, so the rates
quoted in this book may be different from the actual rate you receive
when you make your reservation. When you call to book, be sure to men-
tion membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flier programs, or any other cor-
porate rewards programs you can think of — or your Uncle Joe’s Elks
Lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for that matter. You never
know when the affiliation may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Shopping online for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking
through the hotel’s own Web site or by booking through an independent
booking agency (or a fare-service agency such as Priceline). Of the “big
three” booking agencies, Expedia offers a long list of special deals and
“virtual tours” or photos of available rooms so you can see what you’re
paying for (a feature that helps counter the claims that the best rooms
are often held back from bargain-booking Web sites). Travelocity posts
unvarnished customer reviews and ranks its properties according to the
AAA rating system. Orbitz features a handy tool to let you search for spe-
cific amenities you may be interested in. Also reliable are Hotels.com and
Quikbook.com. An excellent free program, TravelAxe (www.travelaxe.
net), can help you search multiple hotel sites at once, even ones you
may never have heard of — and conveniently lists the total price of the
room, including the taxes and service charges.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
74

Another booking site, Travelweb (www.travelweb.com), is partly
owned by the hotels it represents (including the Hilton, Hyatt, and
Starwood chains) and is therefore plugged directly into the hotels’ reser-
vations systems — unlike independent online agencies, which have to
fax or e-mail reservation requests to the hotel, a good portion of which
get misplaced in the shuffle. More than once, travelers have arrived at
the hotel, only to be told that they have no reservation.
Many of the major sites are undergoing improvements in service and
ease of use, and Expedia will soon be able to plug directly into the reser-
vations systems of many hotel chains — none of which can be bad news
for consumers. In the meantime, it’s a good idea to get a confirmation
number and make a printout of any online-booking transaction.
In the opaque Web site category, Priceline and Hotwire are even better
for hotels than for airfares; with both, you’re allowed to pick the neigh-
borhood and quality level of your hotel before offering up your money.
Priceline’s hotel product even covers Europe and Asia, though it’s much
better at getting five-star lodging for three-star prices than at finding
anything at the bottom of the scale. On the downside, many hotels stick
Priceline guests in their least desirable rooms. Be sure to go to the
BiddingForTravel Web site (www.biddingfortravel.com) before bid-
ding on a hotel room on Priceline; it features a fairly up-to-date list of
hotels that Priceline uses in major cities. For both Priceline and Hotwire,
you pay upfront, and the fee is nonrefundable. Note: Some hotels do not
provide loyalty-program credits or points or other frequent-stay ameni-
ties when you book a room through opaque online services.
Reserving the best room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in 
the house.
 Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more.
 Ask whether the hotel is renovating. If it is, request a room away
from the renovation work.
 Inquire about the location of the restaurants, bars, and discos in
the hotel — all sources of annoying noise.
 Ask whether you’re paying more for the view. Rooms with 
views — of the water in San Francisco and Santa Monica, or any
mountain or sterling city vista — often run a bit more, so if you’re
trying to save money, ask yourself how often you look out the
window. (During a slow period, you may be able to score that view
room for less than it usually goes for, if you ask nicely enough.)
 If you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to the
front-desk staff. If they have another room, they should be happy
to accommodate you, within reason.

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
With its wealth of parks — both the theme kind, a la Disneyland, and the
natural kind, a la Yosemite — California is the ultimate family-vacation
state. Knowing on which side its bread is buttered, the Golden State
offers a wealth of family-friendly accommodations — from luxury resorts
to budget motels — restaurants, and other activities. We note the best
kid-friendly spots throughout this book.
Some destinations suit families better than do others. Skip romantic
Carmel, for example, and head for kid-friendly Monterey. Your kids will
probably prefer San Diego to Palm Springs, if you have to choose. Still,
families are as individual as snowflakes, and no single blueprint exists
for the ultimate family vacation.

Your vacation will go well if you remember to tailor your trip around 
the things you and your kids like to do. Check out the itineraries in
Chapter 4, a number of which take family travel into consideration.
Following are a few tips to help you with your family travel plans:
 Don’t be too ambitious. We can’t say this too strongly: Too much
time spent in the car moving from one place to another will result
in a trip from hell — for both you and the kids. When you can’t
avoid a long car trip, try to book a rental car with a DVD player. We
wish our parents had one when we were kids on long family driving
vacations.
 Take it slow at the start. Give the entire family time to adjust to a
new time zone or to just being on the road. The best way to do this
is to arrive at your initial destination and budget a couple of days
that don’t require strict itineraries or lots of moving around.
 Look for the Kid Friendly icon as you flip through this book. We
use it to highlight hotels, restaurants, and attractions that your
family will find particularly welcoming. Zeroing in on these listings
helps you plan your trip more efficiently.
 Bring plenty of road-trip supplies. Bring healthy snacks, car-
friendly books and games, and a pillow and blanket for nap time.
Books on tape are great for entertaining the entire family.
 Book some private time for mom and dad. Most hotels can hook
you up with a reliable baby sitter who will entertain the kids while
you enjoy a romantic dinner or another adults-only activity. Ask
about babysitting services when you make your reservations.
If you have enough trouble getting your kids out of the house in the morn-
ing, dragging them thousands of miles away may seem like an insurmount-
able challenge. But family travel can be immensely rewarding, giving you
new ways of seeing the world through smaller pairs of eyes.
Familyhostel (% 800-733-9753; www.learn.unh.edu/familyhostel)
takes the whole family, including kids ages 8 to 15, on moderately priced
domestic and international learning vacations. Lectures, field trips, and
sightseeing are guided by a team of academics.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet from
sites such as the Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com),
a comprehensive site that offers customized trip planning; Family Travel
Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com), an award-winning site that
offers travel features, deals, and tips; Traveling Internationally with Your
Kids (www.travelwithyourkids.com), a comprehensive site that offers
customized trip planning; and Family Travel Files (www.thefamily
travelfiles.com), which offers an online magazine and a directory of
off-the-beaten-path tours and tour operators for families.

Making Age Work for You: Tips for Seniors
Mention the fact that you’re a senior citizen when you make your travel
reservations. Although all the major U.S. airlines except America West
have cancelled their senior-discount and coupon-book programs, many
hotels still offer discounts for seniors. In most cities, people over the age
of 60 qualify for reduced admission to theaters, museums, and other
attractions, as well as discounted fares on public transportation.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), get discounts on hotels, airfares, and
car rentals. AARP offers members a wide range of benefits, including
AARP: The Magazine and a monthly newsletter. Anyone over 50 can join.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Age Passport that gives
seniors 62 years or older lifetime entrance to all properties administered
by the National Park Service — national parks, monuments, historic
sites, recreation areas, and national wildlife refuges — for a one-time
processing fee of $10, which must be purchased in person at any NPS
facility that charges an entrance fee (for example, Yosemite National
Park). Besides free entry, a Golden Age Passport also offers a 50 percent
discount on federal-use fees charged for such facilities as camping,
swimming, parking, boat launching, and tours. For more information, go

Accessing California: Advice for 
Travelers with a Disability
These days, a disability shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. In fact,
California was at the forefront of making sure all public buildings were
made wheelchair accessible and were equipped with accessible rest-
rooms. Most hotels and sightseeing attractions (except those grandfa-
thered by landmark status through the Americans with Disabilities Act,
or ADA) are outfitted with wheelchair ramps and extra-wide doorways
and halls. Many city-sidewalk corners have dropped curbs, and some
public-transit systems are equipped with lifts. Your best bet is to contact
local visitor bureaus, because they can provide you with all the specifics
on accessibility in their locale; see the “Gathering More Information”
sections at the end of each destination chapter in Parts II, III, and IV.
Because so many of California’s hotels are on the newer side, a good
number feature rooms dedicated to the needs of disabled travelers, out-
fitted with everything from extra-large bathrooms with low-set fixtures
to fire-alarm systems adapted for deaf travelers. Still, before you book a
hotel room, ask lots of questions based on your needs. After you arrive,
always call restaurants, attractions, and theaters before you go to make
sure they’re fully accessible.
The U.S. National Park Service offers a Golden Access Passport that gives
free lifetime entrance to all properties administered by the National Park
Service — national parks, monuments, historic sites, recreation areas, and
national wildlife refuges — for persons who are visually impaired or per-
manently disabled, regardless of age. You may pick up a Golden Access
Passport at any NPS entrance-fee area by showing proof of medically
determined disability and eligibility for receiving benefits under federal
law. Besides free entry, the Golden Access Passport also offers a 50 per-
cent discount on federal-use fees charged for such facilities as camping,
swimming, parking, boat launching, and tours. For more information, go
online to www.nps.gov/fees_passes.htm or call % 888-467-2757.
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities. Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flying
wheelstravel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts. Access-Able Travel
Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.com) offers extensive
access information and advice for traveling around the world with dis-
abilities. Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339) assists
wheelchair travelers and their families and friends.
Avis Rent a Car has an “Avis Access” program that offers such services
as a dedicated 24-hour toll-free number (% 888-879-4273) for customers
with special travel needs. Special cars feature amenities such as swivel
seats, spinner knobs, and hand controls.
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 79

Organizations that offer assistance to disabled travelers include

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay or Lesbian Travelers
In the Golden State, homosexuality is squarely in the mainstream, espe-
cially in the cities. San Francisco is a mecca for gays, with Los Angeles
running neck-and-neck with New York for a close second as the gay-
friendliest city in the United States. Even relatively conservative San
Diego has a huge gay contingent (the Hillcrest neighborhood is the
base). Palm Springs is hugely popular with gay travelers, but, by and
large, the entire state is welcoming to gays and lesbians.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA; % 800-
448-8550 or 954-776-2626; www.iglta.org) is the trade association for
the gay and lesbian travel industry and offers an online directory of gay-
and lesbian-friendly travel businesses.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries specifically designed for
gay and lesbian travelers. Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681;
www.abovebeyondtours.com) is the exclusive gay and lesbian tour
operator for United Airlines. Now, Voyager (% 800-255-6951; www.now
voyager.com) is a well-known San Francisco–based gay-owned and 
-operated travel service. Olivia Cruises & Resorts (% 800-631-6277 or
510-655-0364; www.olivia.com) charters entire resorts and ships exclu-
sively for lesbian vacationers and offers smaller group experiences for
both gay and lesbian travelers.

Taking Care of the
Remaining Details
In This Chapter
 Buying insurance and making reservations before you leave home
 Staying healthy when you travel
 Staying connected by cellphone or e-mail
 Keeping up with airline security measures
T
his chapter helps you shore up the final details — keeping you
healthy, offering advice for how to find help when you need it, and
other things we’re sure you won’t need during your fabulous and easy
trip. But it never hurts to have contingency plans.
Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available: trip-cancellation insurance,
medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost varies widely,
depending on the cost and length of your trip, your age and health, and
the type of trip you’re taking, but expect to pay between 5 and 8 percent
of the vacation itself. Here is our advice on all three:
 Trip-cancellation insurance helps you get your money back if you
have to back out of a trip, if you have to go home early, or if your
travel supplier goes bankrupt. Allowable reasons for cancellation can
range from sickness to natural disasters to the State Department
declaring your destination unsafe for travel. (Insurers usually won’t
cover vague fears, though, as many travelers discovered who tried
to cancel their trips in October 2001 because they were wary of
flying.)
A good resource is Travel Guard Alerts, a list of companies consid-
ered high-risk by Travel Guard International (www.travelinsured.
com). Protect yourself further by paying for the insurance with a
credit card — by law, you can get your money back on goods and

services not received if you report the loss within 60 days after the
charge is listed on a credit-card statement.
Many tour operators include insurance in the cost of the trip or can
arrange insurance policies through a partnering provider, a conven-
ient and often cost-effective way for you to get insurance. However,
we believe you should avoid this; you’re better off buying from a
third-party insurer if you decide to get insurance.
 For domestic travel, buying medical insurance for your trip 
doesn’t make sense for most travelers. Most existing health poli-
cies cover you if you get sick away from home — but check before
you go, particularly if you’re insured by an HMO.
 Lost-luggage insurance is not necessary for most travelers. On
domestic flights, checked baggage is covered up to $2,500 per 
ticketed passenger. On international flights (including U.S. portions
of international trips), baggage coverage is limited to approxi-
mately $9.07 per pound, up to approximately $635 per checked bag.
If you plan to check items more valuable than the standard liability,
find out whether your valuables are covered by your homeowner’s
policy, get baggage insurance as part of your comprehensive travel-
insurance package, or buy Travel Guard’s BagTrak product. Don’t
buy insurance at the airport — it’s usually overpriced. Take any
valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your carry-on luggage,
as many valuables (including books, money, and electronics) aren’t
covered by airline policies.
If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the
airport, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must
report delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of
arrival. The airlines are required to deliver luggage, once found,
directly to your house or destination free of charge.
For more information, contact one of the following recommended in-
surers: Access America (% 866-807-3982; www.accessamerica.com),
Travel Guard International (% 800-826-4919; www.travelguard.com),
Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174; www.travelinsured.
com), or Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-457-4602; www.travelex-
insurance.com).
Staying Healthy When You Travel
Getting sick will ruin your vacation, so we strongly advise against it. (Of
course, last time we checked, the bugs weren’t listening to us any more
than they probably listen to you.) You don’t have to worry about much
in California, other than a bad sunburn, although if you plan on doing
much hiking, beware of Lyme disease, and, probably increasingly, like
everywhere else, West Nile Virus. A little Off (or other bug juice of your
choice) should handle the really minimal risk of either.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 83

For domestic trips, most reliable healthcare plans provide coverage if
you get sick away from home. For travel abroad, you may have to pay all
medical costs upfront and be reimbursed later. For more on getting addi-
tional medical insurance for your trip, see the preceding section.
Talk to your doctor before leaving on a trip if you have a serious and/or
chronic illness. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart 
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298; www.
medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condition
and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-hour hot
line.
Staying Connected by Cellphone
Just because your cellphone works at home doesn’t mean it’ll work 
elsewhere in the country (thanks to our nation’s fragmented cellphone
system). It’s a good bet that your phone will work in major cities. But
take a look at your wireless company’s coverage map on its Web site
before heading out — T-Mobile, Sprint, and Nextel are particularly weak
in rural areas. If you need to stay in touch at a destination where you
know your phone won’t work, rent a phone that does from InTouch USA
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) or a rental-car location,
but beware that you’ll pay $1 a minute or more for airtime.
If you’re venturing deep into national parks, you may want to consider
renting a satellite phone (satphone), which is different from a cellphone in
that it connects to satellites rather than ground-based towers. A satphone
is more costly than a cellphone but works where there’s no cellular signal
and no towers. Unfortunately, you pay at least $2 per minute to use the
phone, and it works only where you can see the horizon (that is, usually
not indoors). In North America, you can rent Iridium satellite phones 
from RoadPost (% 888-290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com).
InTouch USA offers a wider range of satphones but at higher rates.
If you’re not from the United States, you’ll be appalled at the poor reach 
of our GSM (Global System for Mobiles) wireless network, which is used
by much of the rest of the world. Your phone will probably work in most
major U.S. cities; it definitely won’t work in many rural areas. And you may
or may not be able to send SMS (text messaging) home. Assume nothing —
call your wireless provider and get the full scoop. In a worst-case sce-
nario, you can rent a phone; InTouch USA delivers to hotels.
Accessing the Internet away from Home
You have any number of ways to check your e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a per-
sonal digital assistant (PDA) or electronic organizer with a modem —
gives you the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you
can access your e-mail or your office computer from cybercafes.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
84

Checking in publicly
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
That’s especially the case in the major (and not-so-major) California
cities. Although there’s no definitive directory for cybercafes — these
are independent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are
www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com.
Aside from formal cybercafes, most public libraries offer Internet access
free or for a small charge. Avoid hotel business centers unless you’re
willing to pay exorbitant rates.
Most major airports now have Internet kiosks scattered throughout
their gates. These kiosks, which you’ll also see in shopping malls, hotel
lobbies, and tourist-information offices, give you basic Web access for a
per-minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. The kiosks
are clunky and costly, so avoid them whenever possible.
Getting online with your home provider
To retrieve your e-mail, ask your Internet service provider (ISP)
whether it has a Web-based interface tied to your existing e-mail
account. If your ISP doesn’t have such an interface, you can use the 
free mail2web service (www.mail2web.com) to view and reply to your
home e-mail. For more flexibility, you may want to open a free, Web-
based e-mail account with Yahoo! Mail (http://mail.yahoo.com).
(Microsoft’s Hotmail is another popular option, but Hotmail has severe
spam problems.) Your home ISP may be able to forward your e-mail to
the Web-based account automatically.
In addition, major ISPs have local access numbers around the world,
allowing you to go online by simply placing a local call. Check your ISP’s
Web site or call its toll-free number and ask how you can use your cur-
rent account away from home, and how much it will cost. If you’re 
traveling outside the reach of your ISP, the iPass network has dial-up
numbers in most of the world’s countries. You’ll have to sign up with an
iPass provider, who tells you how to set up your computer for your des-
tination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com and click
on “Individual Purchase.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-811-6209
or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
If you need to access files on your office computer, look into a service
called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service provides a Web-
based interface for you to access and manipulate a distant PC from any-
where — even a cybercafe — provided your “target” PC is on and has an
always-on connection to the Internet (such as with Road Runner cable).
The service offers top-quality security, but if you’re worried about hack-
ers, access the GoToMyPC system using your own laptop rather than a
cybercafe computer.
Most business-class hotels throughout the world offer dataports for
laptop modems, and a few thousand hotels in the United States and
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 85

Europe now offer free high-speed Internet access using an Ethernet net-
work cable. You can bring your own cables, but most hotels rent them
for around $10. Call your hotel in advance to see what your options are.
Wherever you go, bring a connection kit of the right power and phone
adapters, a spare phone cord, and a spare Ethernet network cable — or
find out whether your hotel supplies them to guests.
Going the wireless route
If you are bringing your own computer, the buzzword in computer
access to familiarize yourself with is Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity), and more
and more hotels, cafes, and retailers are signing on as wireless hotspots
from where you can get a high-speed connection without cable wires,
networking hardware, or a phone line. You can get a Wi-Fi connection
one of several ways. Many laptops sold in the last year have built-in 
Wi-Fi capability (an 802.11b wireless Ethernet connection). Mac owners
have their own networking technology, Apple AirPort. If you have an
older computer, an 802.11b/Wi-Fi card (around $50) can be plugged into
your laptop. You sign up for wireless access service much as you do cell-
phone service, through a plan offered by one of several commercial
companies that have made wireless service available in airports, hotel
lobbies, and coffee shops, primarily in the United States (followed by the
United Kingdom and Japan). T-Mobile Hotspot (www.t-mobile.com/
hotspot) serves up wireless connections at more than 1,000 Starbucks
coffee shops nationwide. Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport
(www.wayport.com) have set up networks in airports and high-class
hotel lobbies. iPass providers also give you access to a few hundred
wireless hotel lobby setups. Best of all, you don’t need to be staying at
the Four Seasons to use the hotel’s network; just set yourself up on a
nice couch in the lobby. The companies’ pricing policies can be
Byzantine, with a variety of monthly, per-connection, and per-minute
plans, but, in general, you pay around $30 a month for limited access —
and as more and more companies jump on the wireless bandwagon,
prices are likely to get even more competitive.
Keeping Up with Airline Security
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
okay if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line. But
don’t rely on that. We’ve noticed, and this is strictly our own observa-
tion, that Southwest lines tend to be particularly long at Los Angeles
International and at Oakland International.
Bring a current, government-issued photo ID such as a driver’s license
or passport. Keep your ID at the ready to show at check-in, the security
Part II: Planning Your Trip to California 
86

checkpoint, and sometimes even the gate. (Children under 18 do not
need government-issued photo IDs for domestic flights, but they do for
international flights to most countries.)
In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And 
E-tickets have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. If you have an E-ticket,
you can beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks
or even online check-in from your home computer. Online check-in
involves logging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reserva-
tion, and printing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even
offer you bonus miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport,
bring the credit card you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier
card; you’ll need it to access your ticket information. Print out your
boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security check-
point with your pass and a photo ID. If you’re checking bags or looking
to snag an exit-row seat, you’ll be able to do so using most airline kiosks.
Smaller airlines are also employing the kiosk system; call your airline to
make sure these alternatives are available. Curbside check-in is also a
good way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-
in; call before you go.
Security checkpoint lines are getting shorter than they were during 2001
and 2002, but some doozies remain. If you have trouble standing for long
periods of time, tell an airline employee; the airline will provide a wheel-
chair. Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt
buckles, and remember that many leather shoes (other than sneakers)
can also contain buzzer-triggering metal. If you have metallic body parts,
a note from your doctor can prevent a long chat with the security screen-
ers. Keep in mind that only ticketed passengers are allowed past secu-
rity, except for folks escorting disabled passengers or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you can’t.
The general rule is that sharp things, gels, and liquids are okay in small
quantities, nail clippers are okay, and food must be passed through the 
X-ray machine. Bring food in your carry-on rather than checking it, as
explosive-detection machines used on checked luggage have been known
to mistake food (especially chocolate, for some reason) for bombs.
Travelers in the United States are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a per-
sonal item such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on hoarders
can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has a laptop 
in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation Security
Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check its Web
site (www.tsa.gov/travelers/index.shtm) for details.

S
an Francisco continues to be one of America’s most enticing desti-
nations. This former gold-rush rowdy may not always bask in the
sunny weather of its Southern California sisters, but where else can you
sample a touch of Asia, a bit of Parisian joie de vivre, a taste of Central
America, a hint of Italy, and a good dollop of West Coast style and eccen-
tricity in a single day? San Francisco’s secret weapon is its winning com-
bination of big-city sophistication and small-town accessibility. You can
always discover something new in the unique neighborhoods of this
walking town, from restored Victorian homes to amusing shops to some
of the greatest restaurants in the country.
The dot-com implosion, the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, 
and the general economic malaise that followed certainly left the city
reeling — but only for a while. Office space no longer goes begging and
long-awaited civic improvements have been completed. Market Street, 
at Fifth Street, now sports a spiffy new shopping center that rivals . . .
nothing, actually. The new de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park
opened to appreciative crowds in October 2005; Union Square, in the
heart of downtown, looks glorious after a much-needed nip and tuck;
and the exquisite glass Conservatory of Flowers, also in Golden Gate
Park, is back in business after a violent storm nearly destroyed it in
1995. San Francisco’s impressive brick-and-concrete baseball park, the
“miracle on Third Street,” has changed the face of a once-neglected
corner of the bay, and the waterfront, lined with palm trees, awash in
views, and traversed by vintage trolley cars, is a picture of urban glory,
starring the remodeled and revitalized Ferry Building.
What never fails to beguile visitors and locals alike are the much-loved
symbols that are synonymous with the city. The Golden Gate Bridge,
Golden Gate Park, the Palace of Fine Arts, the cable cars, and
Chinatown have changed little over the decades, thank goodness. And
despite good-natured grumbling from the natives regarding the “good
old days,” the city of San Francisco has never looked so vibrant.

Timing Your Visit
San Francisco is a year-round city, usually draped in mild to cool tempera-
tures and fog-bound mornings, especially during the summer. If weather is
a factor — warm weather, that is — come in September or early October
when the city traditionally experiences a hot spell. These, naturally, are
the busiest months in the hotel trade, right up there with summer vaca-
tion. Be sure to book lodgings ahead of time to ensure a decent place 
to stay, and inquire about air conditioning if that’s important to you —
older hotel buildings don’t have it. Winter tends to be cold and drizzly
(although we’ve enjoyed fair skies and mild temperatures in Jan), but you
can often get fantastic deals on hotel rooms after the holidays. In early
spring, the flowering plum trees are in bloom and, though the skies may
pour, you may also find drought conditions. Ya just never know.
It’s always an excellent idea to check dates with the San Francisco
Convention and Visitors Bureau (% 800-220-5747 or 415-391-2000;
www.onlyinsanfrancisco.com) to avoid scheduling your vacation
during MacWeek or any other large convention, when hotels and restau-
rants are jammed.
Getting There
Although you can meander to San Francisco by car or by rail, flying into
the region is the recommended option. And the Bay Area has two con-
venient airports to make flying an even more palatable choice:
 San Francisco International (SFO; % 650-821-8211; www.flysfo.
com), 14 miles south of downtown
 Oakland International Airport (% 510-563-3300; www.fly
oakland.com), across the Bay Bridge off I-880
More airlines fly into the considerably larger SFO, but navigating the less
crowded, two-terminal Oakland airport is easier. Plus, getting to Oakland
International from downtown San Francisco can take just a half-hour,
traffic permitting. You’ll find tourist information desks on the first floor
(baggage level) of both airports, as well as ATMs located in every termi-
nal on the upper levels.
Making your way downtown from SFO
Travel time from San Francisco International to downtown San Francisco
is dependent on the traffic; during rush hour, the trip can take 40 min-
utes or more, and at other times can run from 20 to 30 minutes. Super
Shuttle (% 415-558-8500; www.supershuttle.com) and other similar
companies offer door-to-door service into the city from the airport. The
services are located at center islands outside the upper level, and a
guide will direct you to the right area. Fares are around $15; advance
reservations are not necessary.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
92

Taxis line up at well-marked yellow columns on the center island outside
the lower level of the airport. The fare is about $35 to downtown, plus tip.
Probably the smartest new addition to the San Francisco Airport in
recent years is the BART station, which allows travelers to use public
transport to reach the city and some suburbs. Bay Area Rapid Transit,
or BART (% 510-465-2278; www.bart.gov), ferries travelers from SFO
into San Francisco, the East Bay, and the Millbrae Caltrain Station, a few
miles south of the airport. BART fares into San Francisco are $5.15. BART
airport stations are located on Level 3 of the International Terminal, or
from the domestic terminals you can take the automated AirTrain to the
Garage G/BART Station stop. If you’re renting a car, a free AirTrain takes
you to the vast building where all the counters and cars are located.
Catch the AirTrain on Level 5 in any domestic terminal parking garage.
Making your way to San Francisco 
from Oakland International
The routine is similar from Oakland International, except that all ground
transportation is on one level. Bayporter Express Shuttles (% 415-467-
1800; www.bayporter.com) pick up passengers from Terminal 1 at the
center island, and from Terminal 2 around the corner from baggage
claim. The fare for the 30- to 40-minute ride to San Francisco is $26 for
one person, $38 for two people in the same party, and $7 for kids
younger than 12. Reservations aren’t necessary.
A 30- to 40-minute taxi ride into the city runs you about $45.
BART (% 510-465-2278) also runs from Oakland into the city. Take the
AirBART Shuttle (% 510-430-9440) in front of Terminal 1 or 2, which
runs every 20 minutes. The fare is $2 for the 15- to 30-minute ride to the
Oakland Coliseum BART station. From there, transfer to a BART train
into San Francisco; the fare is about $3.35. Purchase your ticket from
well-marked kiosks inside the airport or at the BART station. If you’re
staying around Union Square, the city’s commercial hub, exit the BART
on Powell Street.
Driving to the Bay Area
Two major highways lead to San Francisco: I-5 runs north-south through
the center of the state. Drivers traveling along this route are deposited
onto I-80, which comes in from the northeast and leads over the Bay
Bridge into the city. The drive to San Francisco from Los Angeles along 
I-5 takes six hours.
The other major route is U.S. 101, which heads up from Los Angeles
through the city to Marin County, Napa and Sonoma valleys, and other
points north. A prettier, more scenic coastal route, Highway 1, takes
travelers heading north closer to Monterey and Santa Cruz, but the driv-
ing time up from L.A. is approximately eight to ten hours.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 93

Traveling by train to . . . Emeryville?
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains arrive in Emeryville,
just north of Oakland. Buses then drop passengers off at one of six stops
in San Francisco, including the Ferry Building (approximately a 30-minute
ride), at the foot of Market Street on the Embarcadero, or the Caltrain sta-
tion (approximately a 40-minute ride), at Fourth and King streets.
Orienting Yourself and Finding Transportation
San Francisco covers just 7 square miles. The streets are laid out in a
traditional grid pattern, except for two major diagonal arteries, Market
Street and Columbus Avenue. Market cuts a swath through town from
the Embarcadero up to the bottom of Twin Peaks. Columbus runs at an
angle through North Beach, starting at the Transamerica Pyramid in 
the Financial District and ending near the Hyde Street Pier. The “San
Francisco Neighborhoods” map on p. 96 offers a glimpse of the city’s
layout and its major neighborhoods.
Numbered streets are downtown; numbered avenues are in the Richmond
and Sunset districts southwest of downtown.
Other important thoroughfares include Van Ness Avenue, which begins
in the Mission District as South Van Ness and terminates at Aquatic Park;
and Geary Street, which begins at Market and winds through the city to
Ocean Beach.
San Francisco’s neighborhoods
Along with the lovely natural setting, the neighborhoods — each with its
own quirky personality — are what invest San Francisco with so much
charm. This isn’t a big city, size-wise, so you’re no more than 20 minutes
or so by taxi from all the major sites, shopping areas, and restaurants no
matter where you stay.
Union Square
The center of tourist activity, Union Square is tucked inside Sutter, Grant,
Market, and Mason streets. Big department stores, expensive boutiques,
theaters, many good restaurants, and the greatest concentration of hotels
in the city surround the actual square, which has become a pleasant place
to stroll through. If you stay here, Chinatown, Nob Hill, the Financial
District, and SoMa are all within walking distance.
A few blocks west is the Tenderloin neighborhood, a gritty patch of
poverty bounded by Sutter and Mason streets and Van Ness and Golden
Gate avenues. The only reason to linger in the ’loin is to visit Glide
Memorial Church, 330 Ellis St. (% 415-771-6300), for rousing Sunday
services. The multicultural choir sings soulful hymns that bring the con-
gregation to its collective feet. Come early to secure a seat.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
94

Chinatown
This densely packed area roughly bordered by Broadway, Taylor, Bush,
and Montgomery streets is as colorful and exotic as advertised. The
Dragon Gate entrance on Grant Avenue leads to touristy shops, but
wander up and around Stockton Street; you’ll feel as if you’re in another
country. See “The top attractions” section later in this chapter, for
Chinatown’s sightseeing and shopping highlights.
Nob Hill
Posh Nob Hill is a rather rarefied residential district, crowned by Grace
Cathedral, the magnificent Episcopal church at the top of California
Street. A string of pricey hotels cascades down the hill toward the
Financial District, along with the California Street cable car line. If
you’re prepared for the challenge of walking up and down steep grades,
Nob Hill is just a short stroll from Union Square.
The Financial District
The Financial District encompasses prime bay real estate roughly between
Montgomery Street and the Embarcadero, on either side of Market Street.
Major corporations call this area home, and the Transamerica Pyramid,
at Montgomery and Clay streets, is a skyline landmark. Seek out Belden
Place, an alley between Kearny, Bush, and Pine streets, which is full of
outdoor dining opportunities.
The Embarcadero
Liberated from the pylons and cement of the Embarcadero Freeway,
which was damaged by the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and subse-
quently torn down, this area runs along the bay from the eastern edge of
Fisherman’s Wharf to the beginning of China Basin. Embarcadero Center,
a collection of five multiuse buildings connected by bridges and walkways
at the end of Market Street from Drumm to Sansome, houses upscale
chain stores, restaurants, and movie theaters. The Ferry Building at the
foot of Market Street is filled with glorious gourmet food shops. Take the 
F streetcar from Union Square.
South of Market Street (SoMa)
Although the dot-com bust tempered the frenzy, temporarily, South of
Market Street (SoMa for short) has exploded in the past 15 years, particu-
larly along Mission Street between Second and Fifth streets. Attractions
include the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Museum of the
African Diaspora, the Cartoon Art Museum, Yerba Buena Gardens, and
the Metreon (see “The top attractions” section later in this chapter).
North Beach
North Beach isn’t an actual beach; it’s the former Italian enclave that
Chinatown is encroaching upon. This is the place to hop from one cafe
to another, to browse for books and Italian pottery, and to examine the

delectables at the various Italian delis and pastry shops. Columbus
Avenue is the main thoroughfare, but family-style restaurants and
crowded bars dot the streets from Washington to Grant, while the XXX-
rated clubs stick together on Broadway. Use the Powell-Mason cable car
to get here from Union Square.
Fisherman’s Wharf
Sixteen million tourists per year can’t all be wrong, but this mostly com-
mercial section of town is a matter of taste. Located on Bay Street
between Powell and Polk streets, the former working piers have been
turned into an embarrassment of commercialism — although you do
have to come here in order to get to Alcatraz (see “The top attractions”
section later in this chapter). Step gingerly past Pier 39 and the plethora
of schlock shops to the Hyde Street Pier, Ghirardelli Square, and the
Cannery, other legitimate reasons to spend time near the docks. Parking
is difficult and/or expensive, so take the F streetcar from Union Square.
The Marina
Many must-see sites are within walking distance of this high-priced dis-
trict, including the excellent science museum, the Exploratorium. The
Marina’s commercial blocks along Chestnut Street, between Franklin and
Lyon streets, are full of coffeehouses, restaurants, and shops. Take a
walk to the Golden Gate Bridge by way of Marina Boulevard and the
redeveloped Crissy Fields, San Francisco’s fabulous new shoreline park.
Get to the Marina by the 30-Stockton, 22-Fillmore, 41-Union, or 45-
Union/Stockton bus.
The Marina is the gateway to the Presidio, 1,500 partly wild acres on 
the westernmost point of the city that once belonged to the U.S. Army.
They’re now part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Stop at
the visitor center, in the Main Post at Fort Mason on Montgomery Street,
for maps and suggestions for hikes. Take the 29-Sunset bus to get here.
Cow Hollow
A residential paradise surrounded by Broadway, Lyon, and Lombard
streets and Van Ness Avenue, the district’s main claim to fame — among
locals and tourists alike — is Union Street, a fashionable haven of
shops, restaurants, and those young, urban professionals we all love 
to hate. To get here, take the 30-Stockton, 22-Fillmore, 41-Union, or 
45-Union/Stockton bus.
Russian Hill
Polk Street from Broadway up to around Greenwich Street is a chic
avenue with a French flair. It’s a delightful area for relaxed shopping and
snacking with some terrific little restaurants, bakeries, antiques shops,
and boutiques. From Union Square, take the California or Hyde Street
cable car.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
98

Civic Center
Bordered by Van Ness and Golden Gate avenues and Franklin, Hyde, and
Market streets, Civic Center is home to local politicians, city offices, and
cultural centers including the San Francisco Ballet, the San Francisco
Symphony, the San Francisco Opera, and the Asian Art Museum. City
Hall, on Van Ness Avenue between McAllister and Grove streets, under-
went a spectacular renovation a few years ago, and its glittering black-
and-gold dome makes a splendid landmark. You can reach this area via
the F streetcar. Note that Civic Center also attracts a sizable homeless
contingent.
The Castro
The Castro is famous for its ties to an activist gay community, and a walk
through the neighborhood will show off beautifully restored Victorian
homes and shops catering to buff guys. Shopping and people-watching
take place mainly on Castro Street between Market and 18th streets.
Check the schedule at the Art Deco Castro Theatre, and consider joining
in a Sing-A-Long Sound of Music if one’s on the calendar. Take the F
streetcar from Union Square.
Haight-Ashbury
Commonly known as the Haight and bounded by Golden Gate Park and
Divisadero, Fulton, and Waller streets, Haight-Ashbury hasn’t fully recov-
ered from what must have been a real bummer to some — the demise 
of the ’60s. Haight (rhymes with “fate”) Street — where the action is —
continues to hold a magical spell over scruffy groups of youngsters cam-
paigning for handouts.
If you’re curious enough to drop by, you’ll stumble upon a multitude of
new and used clothing stores competing for space with all kinds of com-
mercial endeavors, most of which are perfectly legal. The stretch from
Masonic to Stanyon is particularly good for vintage wearables, hip fash-
ion, and shoes. The N-Judah Muni Metro line will take you to Haight
Street.
Japantown
Japantown consists of some downright unattractive indoor shopping
centers off Geary Street between Webster and Laguna streets. It’s a
shame that this area isn’t more visually appealing, because the dismal
gray buildings attached by a pedestrian walkway house some good, inex-
pensive, noodle restaurants and interesting shops. Kabuki Springs and
Spa is a great place to have a massage and a soak. Across Sutter Street,
between Fillmore and Webster streets, look for Cottage Row, all that’s
left of the real Japantown before redevelopment gutted the neighbor-
hood. Catch the 38-Geary or 22-Fillmore bus to get here.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 99

The Mission District
This busy, largely Hispanic community spans the area from César Chávez
(formerly Army) Street to Market Street between Dolores and Potrero
avenues. The city’s most historic building, Mission Dolores, founded in
1776 (on Dolores and 16th streets), attracts visitors, as do a wealth of
inexpensive restaurants and dramatic murals that burst out from the
landscape. Valencia Street between 16th and 23rd streets has become 
a serious destination for foodies. Take BART to the 24th Street exit.
Telegraph Hill
This residential neighborhood lies just to the east of North Beach, behind
Coit Tower and the Filbert Steps. Russian Hill is just to the northwest,
where you’ll find the wiggly part of Lombard Street and Macondry Lane,
fictionalized in Armistead Maupin’s Tales of the City. You can reach
Telegraph Hill via the Powell-Mason cable car.
Pacific Heights
Pacific Heights, bordered by Broadway, Pine, Divisadero, and Franklin
streets, is where the city’s wealthy elite lounge in lavish, beautifully land-
scaped mansions. The 22-Fillmore, 12-Folsom, 27-Bryant, 47-Van Ness,
49-Van Ness/Mission, and 83-Pacific all motor through here.
The Richmond District
Largely residential, the Richmond District is partially framed by Golden
Gate Park at one edge — aah-inspiring, and a great place to walk — and
by the Pacific Ocean on another. The N-Judah Muni Metro line provides
the easiest way to get here.
The Western Addition
We mention this old neighborhood between Geary, Haight, Gough, and
Divisadero streets because people studying their maps often believe it’s
an easy walk from Civic Center to Golden Gate Park by way of Oak or Fell
streets in the heart of this neighborhood. That’s not entirely accurate.
First, it’s hilly. Second, it’s farther than it looks.
Getting around
San Francisco is relatively compact and offers acceptable public trans-
portation, so you really don’t need to drive around the city. Traffic is
heavy downtown, and one-way streets confuse drivers who are unfamil-
iar with the territory. That, combined with the lack of street parking and
the heavy-handed meter maids, makes leaving your car in a parking
garage the sensible thing to do.
If you’re starting your California trip with a few days in San Francisco
and then setting out to explore, arriving carless in the city and picking
up your rental just before you leave town is a sound idea. Renting a car
downtown is simple and smart. See Chapter 7 for more information
about renting a car.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
100

From Union Square, where most hotels are located, it’s an easy walk to
Chinatown, North Beach, SoMa, and the Financial District. Buses, Muni
streetcars, and cable cars are convenient and inexpensive ways to reach
outlying neighborhoods, but taxis usually require a phone call.
Hoofing it
Walking is the preferred method of travel in San Francisco and the only
way to catch the nuances of the neighborhoods. Be careful, however,
because vehicle/pedestrian accidents occur with alarming regularity.
Although pedestrians have the right-of-way, watch for drivers running
red lights or turning right on a red light. Make sure that bus drivers see
you entering crosswalks.
Catching cabs
Taxis are easy to hail downtown, especially in front of hotels, but you
have to call a cab to come get you almost anywhere else. Reaching the
taxi companies by phone can take a while, so keep this in mind, and
have these numbers handy:
 Desoto Cab: % 415-970-1300
 Luxor Cabs: % 415-282-4141
 Veteran’s Cab: % 415-648-1313
 Yellow Cab: % 415-626-2345
Rates are about $2.85 for the first mile and $2.25 for each additional mile.
Taking the Muni Metro streetcars
The San Francisco Municipal Railway, known as Muni (call % 415-673-
6864 for gracious directions on how to get where you want to go; www.
sfmuni.com), is much maligned by locals for inefficiency, but tens of
thousands of commuters rely daily on its buses and electric streetcars
for a lift. For information on getting an official Muni map, see the
“Transit tips” section.
Muni Metro streetcars run underground downtown and aboveground in
the outlying neighborhoods. The five streetcar lines, the J, K, L, M, and
N, make the same stops as BART (see the upcoming “Going underground
with BART” section) along Market Street, including Embarcadero Station,
Montgomery and Powell streets (both near Union Square), and Civic
Center. Past Civic Center, the routes branch off in different directions.
The N-Judah line services Haight-Ashbury and parallels Golden Gate
Park on its way down Judah Street to the ocean. The J-Church line
passes near Mission Dolores and the Castro. Our personal favorite is the
F-Market, whose antique streetcars run from the Castro Street station
down Market Street, over to Mission Street, then down the Embarcadero
to Fisherman’s Wharf. Muni cars marked “Mission Bay” end their jour-
ney at the Caltrain Station on King Street just past the glorious San
Francisco Giants’ baseball park.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 101

The fare to ride a bus or streetcar anywhere in the system is $1.50 for
adults and 50¢ for seniors and children, and includes a transfer good for
90 minutes; exact change is required. For information on multiday passes,
see the “Transit tips” section.
Riding the bus
A fleet of buses chugs throughout the city from 6 a.m. to midnight.
Street-corner signs and painted yellow bands on utility poles and on
curbs mark bus stops, and buses are clearly numbered on the front.
Depending on your destination and the time of day, buses arrive every 
5 to 20 minutes. They aren’t the quickest means of transportation, but
with 80 transit lines, they are the most complete. During rush hour 
(7–9 a.m. and 4–6 p.m.), buses are often sardine-can crowded.
Going underground with BART
Bay Area Rapid Transit (% 415-989-2278; www.bart.gov) is different
from Muni, although visitors often get the two systems mixed up
because they share the same underground stations (but different plat-
forms) downtown. Within the city limits, that’s not a problem. BART,
however, runs all over the Bay Area, and more than one unsuspecting
traveler has ended up in Oakland when he intended to exit at the
Embarcadero.
Purchase BART tickets from machines at the station. Fares to and from
any point in the city are $1.40 each way; outside the city, fares vary
depending on how far down the line you go.
Hopping aboard the cable cars
No trip to San Francisco would be complete without a ride on a cable
car. Three lines traverse the downtown area. The Powell-Hyde line —
the most scenic and exciting run — begins at Powell Street and ends at
the turnaround across from Ghirardelli Square. The Powell-Mason line
goes through North Beach and ends near Fisherman’s Wharf. The
California Street line — the tamest and least scenic — crests at Nob Hill
and ends at Van Ness Avenue. Rides are $5 one-way. You may board a
cable car only at specific, clearly marked stops. Cable cars operate from
6:30 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
Transit tips
Here are a few transit tips and information on multiday passes that will
make your life much easier and can even save you money in the process:
 Buy a copy of the official Muni map. It costs $3 and is invaluable
for public-transportation users. It shows all the bus, streetcar,
cable-car, and BART routes and stations. Maps are available at the
Convention and Visitors Bureau Information Center and cable-car
ticket booths.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
102

If you want to be proactive, you can find Muni system maps online
at www.sfmuni.com, though we don’t suggest downloading any
without a fast Internet connection.
 The one-stop-shopping number to call for local traffic or public-
transit information is % 415-817-1717. This number connects you
to whatever information line you need, be it BART or Muni routes,
or the latest on traffic conditions. You can also find public-transit
schedules on the Web at www.sfmuni.com.
 Muni Passports, which are accepted on buses, streetcars, and even
cable cars, but not BART, are a bargain for visitors. A one-day pass
is $11, a three-day pass is $18, and a seven-day pass is $24. You can
purchase passes at the Convention and Visitors Bureau Information
Center at Hallidie Plaza, at the Powell and Market or Beach and
Hyde streets Cable Car Turnaround Police booth, or online at
www.sfmuni.com. You may also purchase single-day passes on
board the cable cars.
 Save a few dollars by buying a CityPass, which gives you admission
to six major city attractions for nine days as well as seven days’
consecutive travel on all Muni transportation, including cable cars.
Buy the CityPass at the first attraction you visit or online at www.
citypass.com. For more information, see the “Exploring San
Francisco” section later in this chapter.
Where to Stay
The following listings reflect our preferences for the city’s best accom-
modations in various price categories (see the “San Francisco
Accommodations” map on p. 104 for their locations). You won’t find the
biggest hotels in town mentioned, though — we’re leaving those for the
conventioneers.
Hotel room rates fluctuate hugely depending on supply and demand.
Historically, in San Francisco, demand is high almost all year, and, in
fact, hotel occupancy rates have been increasing steadily since 2003. If
you’re seeking a break on your accommodations, vacation in the winter
months or ask about weekend packages at hotels that cater to business
travelers. Be advised that lots of hotels in older buildings, especially
around Union Square, have surprisingly tiny rooms and baths and no air-
conditioning (only a potential problem in Sept). If you plan to keep a car
downtown, prepare yourself for hefty parking fees.
Count on an extra 14 percent in taxes being tacked on to your hotel bill
and your parking garage fees.

Argonaut Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Fisherman’s Wharf
In an enviable position next to the Cannery, this perky boutique hotel
makes the innumerable chains around Fisherman’s Wharf blush in com-
parison. Many of the nautical-themed rooms have a view of either Alcatraz
or the Golden Gate Bridge, while the lesser-priced interior rooms are
touted as being quieter. Bedrooms are fairly spacious, but we were sur-
prised by the ordinary-looking bathrooms with shallow tubs. Amenities
are generous, including Aveda products, DVD players, robes, well-stocked
minibars, and coffeemakers. The hotel’s restaurant, Blue Mermaid
Chowder House, serves all day and is better than average for wharf food.
See map p. 104. 495 Jefferson St. (at Hyde Street). % 866-415-0704 or 415-563-0800.
Fax: 415-563-2800. www.argonauthotel.com. Valet parking $36. Rack rates:
$179–$299 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Best Western Tuscan Inn
$$$–$$$$
North Beach/Fisherman’s Wharf
This is the other wonderful Fisherman’s Wharf hotel. The hotel is person-
able and the just-remodeled rooms are fairly large by local standards. The
concierge is friendly and enthusiastic, and all the expected amenities are
available including complimentary beverages served in the morning and
an evening wine reception in the lobby. This is a pet-friendly hotel as well.
The Argonaut has a bit better location in our opinion (plus view rooms),
but you may find the rates here lower.

4626 or 415-561-1100. Fax: 415-561-1199. www.tuscaninn.com. Valet parking: $35.
Rack rates: $159–$239 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Chancellor Hotel
$$$
Union Square
This 137-room, nonsmoking, family-owned hotel offers a level of intimacy
and value you just won’t find in many other comparable inns. It’s also right
on the Powell Street cable-car line, a stone’s throw from Saks Fifth Avenue.
The little bathrooms are well stocked, the bedrooms are brightly deco-
rated and comfortably furnished, and management recently added a
“pillow menu,” a nice touch if you’re allergic to goose down or if you like
a soft pillow. Kids are considered, too: Each room has a Nintendo Game
System and the front desk always has cookies. For views, request front
rooms ending in 00 to 05 on as high a floor as possible. The hotel has ceil-
ing fans rather than air-conditioning.

Cow Hollow Motor Inn & Suites
$–$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
These serviceable, nonsmoking motel rooms, unfortunately accessed by
elevators inside the parking garage, are clean and quiet, thanks to a dili-
gent staff and double-paned windows, respectively. The early Sears-
Roebuck furnishings may not yet have made a style comeback, but you’ll
appreciate the in-room coffeemaker and hair dryer, relatively spacious
baths, free parking, free Wi-Fi, and low rates. Plus, the inn is around the
corner from the best blocks of Chestnut Street, where the shopping and
dining set high standards. Families can settle into one of six suites with
kitchens and a separate entrance right on Chestnut Street. Try to avoid
rooms ending in 28, which are next to noisy ice machines.
See map p. 104. 2190 Lombard St. % 415-921-5800. Fax: 415-922-8515. www.cow

suite. AE, MC, V.
Harbor Court Hotel
$$$–$$$$
The Embarcadero
Located just steps from the bay and now under Kimpton Hotel manage-
ment, this is an especially romantic and sophisticated property, lower key
than the Hotel Vitale, but equally as stylish. Rooms were all remodeled in
2005, and although they are pretty small, they’re so warmly decorated and
comfy we can imagine moving in for a long weekend. Reserve or upgrade
to a queen or king bay room, which features dramatic views of the water
and the Bay Bridge. Guests have free access to the state-of-the-art
Embarcadero YMCA pool and health club next door. Trendy Ozumo, an
excellent Japanese restaurant, is accessible from the lobby.
See map p. 104. 165 Steuart St., between Mission and Howard streets. % 866-792-

Hotel Adagio
$$
Union Square
In a previous incarnation, this 1929 Colonial Revival building housed the
tired Shannon Court Hotel, but a total facelift in 2003 turned Joan Crawford
into Cindy Crawford. The modern bedrooms and clean, masculine lines
won’t appeal to frill-seekers, but the hotel is closer in spirit to the more
expensive W and Clift hotels. A nicely fitted fitness center, wireless Internet
access, high-end bath products, complimentary afternoon tea, executive-
level guest rooms with views, and a continental breakfast bring the hotel
squarely into the here and now.

Hotel Bohème
$$$
North Beach
North Beach is the most European-like neighborhood in the city and is our
personal favorite. If you fancy stepping out of your hotel into an Italian-
style cafe for your morning latte, the Bohème is for you. The 15 recently
refreshed rooms, with pretty iron beds and vivid wall colors, are small;
bathrooms have showers only, but in-room amenities are generous. The
accommodating staff will assist with restaurant reservations, tours, and
rental cars, but you’ll have to schlep your own luggage up a flight of
narrow stairs. There’s no air-conditioning, but the windows open.
See map p. 104. 444 Columbus Ave. (between Vallejo and Green streets). % 415-433-
9111. Fax: 415-362-6292. www.hotelboheme.com. Self-parking: $31 in a garage a
few blocks away. Rack rates: $159–$179 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Hotel Del Sol
$$–$$$
The Marina
Paint, mosaic tiles, and a lively imagination can do a lot to reinvent a motel,
and you won’t find a better example of how well this works than the Del
Sol. You’ll think you’re in Southern California (after the fog lifts, anyway),
but here, pedestrians can walk around without getting startled looks from
drivers. A heated pool and a hammock suspended between palm trees
complete the hallucination. Multicolor guest rooms and suites contain
quality amenities such as designer soap. Kids are treated to free kites and
beach balls and can even check out a teddy bear from the Pillow Library.
Some rooms include kitchenettes.

Hotel Monaco
$$$–$$$$$
Union Square
Scare up a vintage Vuitton steamer trunk and a foxtail-trimmed scarf, then
sashay into the Art Deco–inspired Monaco. The medium-size rooms are
replete with canopied beds, floral prints, and modern furniture. All the
amenities — a fitness center, room service, robes, and so on — are avail-
able, along with the appropriately named Grand Cafe restaurant. It’s also
close to theaters and is pet-friendly.

Hotel Rex

At this attractive, sophisticated 94-room gem, room sizes vary from small-
ish doubles on up, so if you want extra space, be sure to request an

thoughtful amenities as CD players.

Hotel Vitale
$$$$–$$$$$
The Embarcadero
Expensive, but not over-the-top extravagant, this new property claims the
most coveted patch of earth in town, across the boulevard from the Ferry
Building. Spoiled by delicious views, an F-Market streetcar stop behind the
building, and its location within walking distance to well-regarded restau-
rants, the hotel delights inside as well. You’ll notice, first, how good the
place smells (small vials with dried lavender grace the hallways), and
attention to detail continues inside the guestrooms. Deluxe waterfront
sanctuaries feature a sexy walk-in shower rather than skimpy bathtub/
shower combos in the still-spacious, but viewless interior rooms. It’s con-
temporary, chic, and full of vitality.

The Huntington
$$$$$
Nob Hill
The Boston Brahmin in you will adore this quiet, refined oasis with its
subtle elegance, impeccable service, and the most gorgeous spa we’ve
seen in this town. The 1924 building originally housed apartments, so
guest rooms (most are suites) and baths are larger than average; by the
end of 2007, all will have been updated. Rooms above the eighth floor offer
views; the ones below are extra-spacious. Children are welcome, and the
staff, concierge included, will anticipate your every need. Manicured
Huntington Park, complete with playground, is across the street.

The Marina Courtyard Motel
$–$$
The Marina/Cow Hollow
Because this was originally an apartment building, 15 of the rentals in this
funky, flower-bedecked, courtyard-style budget motel feature fully
equipped kitchens. A granddaughter of the original owner redecorated the
medium-size studios with Italian bathroom tiles, Mission-style furniture,
and pretty quilts, making this one of the few places on Lombard Street with
even a hint of charm. Families can reserve two connecting rooms with a
Chapter 11: San Francisco 109

shared bathroom. Surprisingly, considering the location, rooms off the
street are remarkably quiet. The front desk clerk will arrange tours or
rental cars at your request. It is the definition of cheap and cheerful.

Nob Hill Lambourne
$$–$$$
Nob Hill
An intimate 20-room hotel, the relaxed and soothing, nonsmoking
Lambourne has spacious rooms with compact kitchenettes and many
amenities. Suites are available for vacationing families — and they’re beau-
ties. Massages and other on-site spa treatments can be scheduled by the
front-desk staff, and nightly turndown service substitutes vitamins for
chocolates on your buckwheat-hull-filled pillow. Continental breakfast is
included in the rates, and a fresh fruit basket is in the hallway for your
pleasure. You won’t find a better deal on Nob Hill.

The Orchard
$$$$
Union Square
Opened in 2001, the 105-room Orchard boasts some of the largest bed-
rooms and most luxurious baths in the area, as well as a charming staff to
assist you. Conservatively decorated rooms will satisfy you as a business
traveler or as a vacationer, because the rooms include CD/DVD players,
high-speed Internet access, and top amenities, including room service.
Cable cars stop just around the corner.

Petite Auberge
$$$–$$$$
Union Square
Romantics will find true love here among the florals and French-country
effects. The high-end rooms are enormous; the less-expensive rooms are
cozy and have showers only, but are equally comfortable. Along with a full
breakfast served downstairs in the homey dining room, the hotel offers
complimentary tea, wine, and hors d’oeuvres in the afternoon. It’s exceed-
ingly popular, so if you want to experience the charms of a Provençal-style
inn, book way ahead.

St. Regis Hotel
$$$$$
SoMa
With the entry of the 40-story St. Regis Hotel onto the five-star scene, you
can rest assured that pampering has reached, well, new heights. The hotel
itself (floors 22 to 40 are residences) is awash in understated, unques-
tionable great taste and comfort, from the handsome lobby bar to the lose-
yourself-in-luxe bedrooms with deep soaking tubs, huge plasma-screen
TVs, and digitized remote controls to close the window coverings or signal
the butler. The fitness center and spa are the finest in town. Views begin
from the eighth floor. Ame, the hotel’s fine-dining restaurant, is now a des-
tination in itself.

Where to Dine
Eating is not beside the point when you visit San Francisco. The number
of restaurants in the city (around 3,300) is astonishing, and the quality of
the food in many of them is equally so. You can locate the restaurants
reviewed in this section on the “San Francisco Dining” map on p. 112.
So much food and so little time . . . but there is plenty of competition for
seats. Call for reservations before arriving at any but the most casual of
restaurants. Easier still, log on to the restaurant reservations Web site
www.opentable.com and book a table through the Internet.
Want to eat at the most sought-after tables in town? Try calling the day
you’d like to go, right after the reservation line opens. The most popular
restaurants often require that guests confirm their intentions by noon,
so you may luck out and get in on a cancellation.

The Marina/Cow Hollow
SOUTHERN ITALIAN
The name refers to the highway through the Campanga region of Italy
(Naples being the major city), and the menu at this stylishly spare restau-
rant not only reflects the cuisine of the south but also uses ingredients
from the area. Favorite dishes include burrata, a delicious mozzarella with
a creamy center; various house-cured salami; and among a handful of
excellent main courses, halibut trimmed with Meyer lemons and almonds.
You’ll also find a choice lineup of authentic Neapolitan pizzas and pasta
dishes.

Civic Center/Hayes Valley
FRENCH
For a lovely meal around Civic Center, this warmly decorated dining room
is a great choice. You can’t miss with a selection from the oyster bar or a
crisp Caesar salad to start. Some days, the chef cooks like a French grand-
mére, with coq au vin, a confit of duck, or house-made sausage and pork
ready to satisfy your hunger pangs. A hot spot for preconcert dining, book
a table after 7:30 p.m. in order to savor the romantic room and seasonal
menu. Weekend brunch is busy, but drop in for lunch if you’re shopping in
the neighborhood.

The Embarcadero
CALIFORNIA
An elegant turn-of-the-century setting and generous plates of seasonal
California-French cuisine combine to ensure a rousing good time at this
deservedly popular restaurant. Entrees of particular note include the
Sonoma duck breast wrapped in applewood-smoked bacon and the thick
pork chop roasted in the wood-fired oven. Guests without reservations
can take a seat at the counter, but you should phone three or four weeks
in advance to get a prime-time table.

The Embarcadero
PAN-ASIAN
This is a beautiful restaurant on the water, a comfortable place to take in
the bay, with drinks and maybe some oysters before the sun sets. The chef-
owner, Robert Lam, uses local ingredients in recipes that pick and choose
from various Asian cuisines, which makes for unusual eating. If you’re in
the mood to try something different, order his crispy, fried whole fish with
kimchi, black bean sauce, and Chinese sausage. You won’t know what to
admire more — the shimmering water or your dinner plate.

Canteen

Union Square
CALIFORNIA
Miniscule Canteen is the domain of the much-admired Chef Dennis Leary,
whose bona fides include four years at Rubicon prior to opening this 20-
seat upscale diner. Leary does the shopping as well as all the cooking, and
his menu changes to reflect what appeals on a weekly basis. If you’re stay-
ing around Union Square, note that breakfast here is stellar, especially the
smoked salmon omelet or stuffed pancake. Work the phones to land a
dinner seat or come for lunch and see what all the fuss is about.

Mission District regulars nearly lost their empanadas when the shiny, chic
Foreign Cinema opened in 1999. The expansive dining room — plus out-
door patio where foreign films are screened on a concrete wall — would
throw anyone at first, but some shellfish from the raw bar help to lower
resistance to the inevitable changes in the neighborhood. The menu
changes regularly, but expect to find entrees such as a roast chicken sea-
soned with Spanish paprika or an imaginative King salmon “B.L.T.”

Living up to its name in every aspect, this vast, high-ceilinged, muraled

freshly cracked crabmeat, but Irene’s baked goat cheese, surrounded by
pesto and perfectly ripe tomato, started a fork fight. We reached an impasse
over the grilled flat-iron steak and the potato-wrapped sea bass, but we
agreed that based on price, atmosphere, service, and taste, this was among
the best meals we’ve eaten in town. Chef-owner Luke Sung has been rec-
ognized as a Rising Star Chef of the Year by the James Beard Foundation
two years in a row, and we can’t argue with that.

This is a particularly reliable family-style Cantonese restaurant, in a qui-
eter part of Chinatown, with a huge menu filled with familiar dishes (such
as egg foo yung), lots of seafood, and every Chinese dish you remember
from childhood (unless you were raised in China). They also serve a good
dim sum lunch. Prices aren’t high (Peking duck being the biggest extrava-
gance), service is fine, and the room is bright and lively because this place
is popular with the locals — and kids, too.

SoMa
MEDITERRANEAN
With the buoyant feel of a lively Provençal bistro, the mouthwatering scent
of the oak-fired rotisserie, and a lengthy menu of appealing dishes, Lulu
seduces on many levels. If you’re anywhere near Yerba Buena Center, don’t
think twice about having lunch or dinner at this local institution. Most
dishes should be shared, such as the daily rotisserie specials, the won-
derful rosemary-scented chicken, and antipasti plate of your own design.
Dinnertime can be pretty noisy, but you’ll be surrounded by a buzz of 
happiness.

Mission District
CALIFORNIA
Range is a prime example of the modern San Francisco neighborhood
restaurant. Opened by a kitchen-savvy husband-and-wife team (Phil and
Cameron West), their small, seasonal menu features flavor over flash,
backed by charming service. The coffee-rubbed pork shoulder is a favorite,
while Range’s delicate take on meat and potatoes — pan-roasted, thinly
sliced bavette steak (cut from the short loin) with narrow fingerlings — 
satisfies on a more primal level. Two simple yet warm dining rooms, fronted
by an attractive bar, allow for conversation, a nice touch given how often
restaurants seem designed to make it impossible.

The city’s premier Vietnamese eatery moved to what we consider a pre-

caramelized chicken, and plates of “shaking” beef. Even if dinner reserva-
tions seem impossible to come by, call at 5:30 p.m. the evening you want
to dine, in case of a cancellation. You may get lucky. You even need a reser-

This urbane, Manhattan-like dining room seats only 45 (plus 12 at the bar),
and in such close confines, you’ll have a chance to examine what the guy
next to you is eating. Chances are it’ll be delectable, as the chef/co-owner,
Robert Riescher, left the renowned Erna’s Elderberry House in Oakhurst
(see Chapter 16) for an opportunity to operate on his own. The menu
changes daily, but with luck he’ll be plating a topless ravioli dish with
tender shreds of braised lamb shank and mustard greens in a pool of onion
broth. It’s awesome.

You can always detect a palpable buzz from the smartly dressed crowd
hanging around Zuni’s copper bar drinking vodka and scarfing down oys-

bread salad for two is simply divine. Don’t opt for an outside table,
because the view on this section of Market Street isn’t all that pleasant.

Dinner as theater
Down at Pier 29 on the Embarcadero, look for a stylized 1926 Spiegeltent (a circular,
tented pavilion), the home of Teatro ZinZanni (% 415-438-2668; www.teatro
zinzanni.org). This is an immensely hilarious dinner show with a twist: The audi-
ence is part of the proceedings. Don’t worry — you won’t be asked to get up and recite.
Along with an acceptable, if not stellar, five-course meal (it reminds us of hotel wedding
suppers), diners are regaled by a talented group of performers who combine cabaret,
opera, acrobatics, comedy, and improv in most-unusual ways. The cast changes peri-
odically, and, strangely enough, Joan Baez has appeared in the show off and on; 
it’s worth investigating who’s in the lineup when you come to town. This isn’t a cheap
date — tickets range from $110 to $135 — but it’s something to consider if you’re cel-
ebrating or looking for an evening out of the ordinary. Doors open Wednesday through
Saturday at 6 p.m. for a 7 p.m. show (one hour earlier on Sun evenings).

Exploring San Francisco
CityPass (www.citypass.net), a booklet of discounted tickets to six
major attractions (Museum of Modern Art, Palace of the Legion of
Honor/de Young museums, California Academy of Sciences or Asian
Art Museum, the Aquarium of the Bay, and the Exploratorium) and a
Blue & Gold Bay Cruise, includes a seven-day Muni Passport, making it
quite a bargain if you’re ambitious enough to use all the coupons. It’s
$49 for adults, $39 for kids, and you can purchase it online or at the par-
ticipating attractions.
To locate the attractions reviewed in the upcoming sections, check out
the “San Francisco’s Top Attractions” map on p. 122.
The top attractions
Alcatraz Island
If not for the movies, Alcatraz Island (aka “The Rock”) would never have
morphed from a derelict, deserted maximum-security prison into a must-
see tourist attraction. Self-guided two-and-a-half-hour audio tours and talks
facilitated by National Park rangers are full of interesting anecdotes. The
walk uphill to the Cell House is steep, so wear comfortable shoes. A tram
runs once every hour to take wheelchair users or anyone unable to make
the walk up to the prison. In the summer, order tickets far in advance for
the ferry ride to the island — and don’t forget to bring a jacket, because
the island gets windy. Plan on at least three hours for the entire excursion.
See map p. 122. Pier 33, at Fisherman’s Wharf for location of ferry departures. 
% 415-981-ROCK. www.AlcatrazCruises.com or www.nps.gov/alcatraz.
Open: Winter daily 9:30 a.m.–2:15 p.m., summer daily 9:30 a.m.–4:15 p.m. Night tours
offered Thurs–Sun at 6:15 and 7 p.m., and at 4:20 p.m. during the winter. Ferries run
approximately every half-hour; arrive at least 20 minutes before sailing time. To get
there: F-Market streetcar, Powell-Mason cable car (the line ends a few blocks away),
or 30-Stockton bus. Admission (includes ferry and audio tour): $19 adults and kids
12–17, $17seniors 62 and older, $11 children 5–11; night-tour fares $26 adults, $23 sen-
iors and kids 12–17, $14 children 5–11.
Asian Art Museum
The Asian Art Museum has one of the largest collections of Asian art in
the Western world, covering 6,000 years and encompassing the cultures
of Japan, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. Although the collection itself
remains more than enough reason to visit, its newly renovated Beaux Arts
building has also attracted plenty of attention. It was designed by Gae
Aulenti, the Milanese architect who renovated the former d’Orsay train sta-
tion in Paris into the wildly popular Musée d’Orsay. The Asian is compact
and it won’t take you more than a few hours to see all the galleries. Cafe
Asia on the first floor is open from 10 a.m. for drinks and Asian-influenced
dishes served cafeteria-style.

The Cable Cars
These cherished wooden cars creak and squeal up and around hills as
unwitting passengers lean out into the wind, running the risk of getting
their heads removed by passing buses. San Francisco’s three existing lines
comprise the world’s only surviving system of cable cars. (Brown signs
with a white cable car on them indicate stops.) All three routes are worth
your time — and kids will demand at least one ride — but the Powell-
Mason line conveniently wends its way from the corner of Powell and
Market streets through North Beach and ends near Fisherman’s Wharf.
The Powell-Hyde line starts at the same intersection and ends up near the
Maritime Museum and Ghirardelli Square. The less-thrilling California line
begins at the foot of Market Street and travels along California Street over
Nob Hill to Van Ness Avenue.
Cars run 6:30 a.m.–12:30 a.m. Fare: $5 per person one-way, payable on board; Muni
passports are accepted. For more information, see the “Getting around” section ear-
lier in this chapter.
Chinatown
Crowded with pedestrians and crammed with exotic-looking shops and
vegetable markets whose wares spill onto the sidewalks, Chinatown is 
genuinely fascinating. If you want an authentic experience, veer off Grant
Avenue and explore the side streets and alleys. On weekends, Chinatown
is extra-jammed with shoppers examining fruits and vegetables piled on
outdoor tables. Just walking down the street is an experience.
The Golden Gate Fortune Cookies Company, 956 Ross Alley (between
Jackson and Washington streets near Grant Avenue), is a working factory
where you can purchase inexpensive fresh almond cookies and crispy for-
tune cookies (terrific gifts for the folks back home!). It’s very tight quar-
ters, but you can stand for a few minutes watching rounds of dough be
transformed and stuffed with fortunes. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Portsmouth Square, a park above the Portsmouth Square parking garage
on Kearny Street (between Washington and Clay streets), is the site of the
first California public school, which opened in 1848, and marks the spot
where San Francisco was originally settled. A compact but complete play-
ground attracts all the neighborhood preschoolers and, in the morning,
elderly Chinese who come to practice tai chi exercises. The landscape
includes comfortable benches, attractive lampposts, and young trees. The
distinctly San Francisco view includes the Transamerica Pyramid looming
above the skyline.

Chapter 11: San Francisco 123

The pedestrian bridge over Kearny Street leads directly into the third floor
of the Chinatown Hilton, where you’ll find the Chinese Culture Center, 750
Kearny St. (% 415-986-1822; www.c-c-c.org). A gift shop leads to the
sole gallery, where changing exhibits may feature, for example, photo-
graphs from pre-earthquake Chinatown, Chinese brush painting, or exqui-
sitely embroidered antique clothing and household items. Admission is
free, and the center is open Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
To get there: Take Muni bus 1-California, 9AX-San Bruno “A” Express, 9BX-San Bruno
“B” Express, or 15-Third.
Coit Tower
Erected in 1933 with funds bequeathed to the city by Lillie Hitchcock Coit,
this 210-foot concrete landmark is visible from much of the city. But take
a closer look to see the beauty of the tower. The décor inside features walls
with dramatic murals inspired by and commissioned during the Great
Depression. Be warned that the drive up Telegraph Hill and the free park-
ing lot are always a mass of cars. Ride the elevator to the top for
panoramic views of the city and the bay. This diversion will probably take
about 30 minutes from start to finish.
See map p. 122. Atop Telegraph Hill. % 415-362-0808. To get there: Take the 39-Coit
bus or walk from Lombard Street where it meets Telegraph Hill Boulevard (2 blocks
east of Stockton Street). Free parking. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. Admission to top of
tower: $4.50 adults, $2.50 seniors, $1.50 kids 6–12.
Exploratorium/Palace of Fine Arts
One of the finest hands-on science museums anywhere, this attraction
makes an interesting stop for all ages. The changing exhibits explore tech-
nology, human perception, and natural phenomena with well-written text.
Visiting with kids can be humbling if you’re science-impaired, but a staff of
alert volunteers is on hand to help with the tough questions. When you
need to decompress, stroll the lovely grounds surrounding the Palace of
Fine Arts. If the weather’s balmy, bring a picnic and stay a while.
See map p. 122. 3601 Lyon St. (at Marina Boulevard). % 415-561-0360. www.
exploratorium.edu. To get there: 30-Stockton bus to Marina stop. Parking: Free
and easy. Admission: $13 adults; $10 seniors, kids 13–17, and students over 18; $8
kids 4–12; free for kids under 4; free to all first Wed of the month. Open: Memorial
Day–Labor Day, daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Wed until 9 p.m.; Labor Day–Memorial Day,
Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Fisherman’s Wharf
Don’t be disappointed when you arrive at Fisherman’s Wharf and see lots
of people wandering around, none of whom seem to be fishing for a living.
This was once a working set of piers, but today it’s a seemingly endless out-
door shopping mall masquerading as a bona-fide destination. Some people
really enjoy examining the refrigerator magnets and cable-car bookends
stocked in one olde shoppe after another; others, dazed in the presence of
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
124

so much kitsch, hastily plan their escape. Still, because most folks make
their way to the wharf for one reason or another, here’s a rundown of what’s
there.
Even when the weather is cold and gray, tourists pack Pier 39, a multilevel
Disneyesque shopper’s fantasy (or nightmare, depending on your point of
view). Arcade halls lined with deafening video games anchor the pier on
each end, with T-shirt shops and fried food filling the void. The only plau-
sible reasons to join the mob are for the golden view of Alcatraz from the
end of the pier, and to watch the sea lions loitering on the west side of the
pier (follow the sound of barking). If you’re arriving by car, park on adja-
cent streets or on the wharf between Taylor and Jones streets. (Be advised:
The parking garage charges $5.50 per hour! Do your best to avoid these
price-gougers or just don’t bring a car here.)
The National Park Service has opened a new visitor center, Hyde and
Jefferson streets (% 415-447-5000; www.nps.gov/safr/local), inside
the Argonaut Hotel, which partners with the Maritime National Historical
Park (closed for remodeling through 2008). Along with exhibits and an edu-
cational center, the ranger-staffed desk can answer questions about spe-
cial events on the Hyde Street Pier. Admission is free and it’s open daily
from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
If you have little kids in tow (or anyone interested in history), you won’t
want to miss touring the USS Pampanito, Pier 45 (% 415-561-6662). This
submarine saw active duty during World War II and helped save 73 British
and Australian prisoners of war. The $20 family pass (for two adults and up
to four children) also gets you into the Hyde Street Pier (see the following
paragraph). Otherwise, submarine-only admission is $9 for adults, $5 for
seniors and students, and $3 children 6 to 12 (kids under 6 are free). Open
daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. in winter, and until 8 p.m. in summer.
The Hyde Street Pier, at the foot of Hyde Street (at Beach Street, 2 blocks
east of the Maritime Museum), houses seven refurbished historic ships
(six are national landmarks) on which you can roam around. Of particular
note is the Balclutha, a square-rigger with a past that began with its 1887
launch. During the year, activities that take place on the Balclutha include
concerts, sea-chantey singalongs, and children’s events. Call % 415-556-
6435 for a schedule. You’ll spend at least an hour or so touring the ves-
sels. In summer, admission is $5 adults, free for kids 17 and younger. Open
daily from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Ghirardelli Square, the former chocolate factory across the street from
the Maritime Park at 900 North Point, between Polk and Larkin streets 
(% 415-775-5500), is one of the more pleasant shopping malls in the area.
Granted landmark status in 1982, the series of brick buildings hosts a
roster of special events, including an annual chocolate-tasting benefit in
September. Street performers entertain regularly in the West Plaza. Open
daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., to 9 p.m. in summer.
One block east in what was once a peach-canning facility is the Cannery
at Del Monte Square, 2801 Leavenworth St., at Beach Street (% 415-771-
3112), with yet more shops, jugglers, musicians, and food. Open daily from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m., until 9 p.m. summer.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 125

See map p. 122. At the foot of Polk Street, on the western edge of the Embarcadero.
To get there: Powell-Hyde cable-car line to the last stop; F-Market streetcar; or 19-
Polk, 30-Stockton, 32-Embarcadero, 42-Downtown Loop, or 47-Van Ness bus. Parking:
Pricey lots and garages; street parking is difficult.
Golden Gate Bridge
It’s the quintessential San Francisco landmark. A walk across the windy,
13⁄4-mile-long span, hundreds of feet above the water, underscores the point
that San Francisco really is like no other city. Bundle up, then set out from
the historic Roundhouse visitor center/gift shop on the south end of the
bridge. The stroll is noisy and chilly, but exhilarating. The only way to
return from the other side is on foot, so assess your fatigue in the middle
of the span before continuing on toward Marin. After your stroll, climb
below the bridge to walk through the 5-acre garden.
See map p. 122. No phone. www.goldengate.org. To get there: The 28-19th
Avenue or the 29-Sunset bus will deposit you across from the viewing area, right by
a parking lot. Open: To pedestrians daily 6 a.m.–6 p.m.
Lombard Street
The part of Lombard with the moniker “crookedest street in the world”
begins at Hyde Street below Russian Hill. The whimsical, flower-lined block
attracts thousands of visitors each year. If you intend to drive this redbrick
street (it’s one-way, downhill, so take the curves slowly), go early in the
morning before everyone else revs up their Chevys. Better yet, walk down
the stairs to fully admire the flowers, the houses with their long-suffering
tenants, and the stellar view.
See map p. 122. Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth streets. To get
there: Powell-Hyde cable-car line.
Museum of the African Diaspora (MoAD)
If you walk down Third Street toward Yerba Buena Center, you can’t fail to
notice the multistory photo mosaic marking one of the latest additions to
the South of Market culture klatch. MoAD packs quite a bit into its rela-
tively small exhibition space, and although it won’t take more than an hour
to tour, you’ll find much to think about. Photographs, video, and some
very cool interactive displays and technological touches focus upon the
themes of origins, movement, adaptation, and transformation in relation
to Africa, and thus, in relation to our own selves and communities. Take
the kids.
See map p. 122. 685 Mission St. (at Third Street). % 415-358-7200. www.moadsf.
org. To get there: Take any Muni streetcar to the Montgomery Street Station or the
15-Third, 30-Stockton, or 45-Union/Stockton bus. Admission: $8 adults, $5 seniors and
students. Open: Wed–Mon 10 a.m.–6 p.m., until 9 p.m. Thurs.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
126

San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (MOMA)
It was a big deal when the city finally built a handsome, grown-up museum
to house its collection of modern paintings, sculptures, and photographs.
The interior is especially beautiful and exudes a warmth that makes view-
ing the exhibits — including works by Henri Matisse, Jackson Pollock, and
Ansel Adams — even more enjoyable.
See map p. 122. 151 Third St. (2 blocks south of Market Street, near Howard Street).
% 415-357-4000. www.sfmoma.org. To get there: Take any Muni Metro to the
Montgomery Street Station and walk 1 block south to Third Street, then 2 blocks east;
or take the 15-Third, 30-Stockton, or 45-Union/Stockton bus. Admission: $13 adults,
$8 seniors, and $7 students with ID; half-price Thurs 6–9 p.m.; free for kids under 12;
free to all first Tues of the month. Open: Thurs 11 a.m.–8:45 p.m., Fri–Tues 11 a.m.–
5:45 p.m., from 10 a.m. in summer.
Golden Gate Park and its attractions
The 1,017 rectangular acres of greenery and cultural attractions that com-
prise Golden Gate Park contain something for everyone. Locals use the
park for everything from soccer practice to wedding receptions to fly-
casting lessons. On Sundays, when John F. Kennedy Drive is closed to
street traffic, bicyclists ride with impunity and in-line skaters converge for
dance parties.
A grand park entrance on Stanyan and Waller streets will lead you to the
massive Children’s Playground and its beautifully restored carousel.
The imaginative structures and swings will occupy kids for as long as
you allow. Remodeling this entrance cut down on the rather large num-
bers of street people who used to hang out there, but you never know
whether that will change. In any case, don’t let it keep you from enjoying
the park; the street folks can look a little scary to the uninitiated, but
they’re generally harmless.
Another entrance at Ninth Avenue on Lincoln Way brings you to the
Strybing Arboretum and the Japanese Tea Garden. The California
Academy of Sciences is closed for renovations until 2008. However, the
de Young Museum has been completely rebuilt and boasts even more
space for its collections of American art. The Conservatory of Flowers, a
Victorian glass greenhouse located northeast of the Academy of Sciences
off John F. Kennedy Drive, reopened in spring of 2003. Modeled after the
conservatory in London’s Kew Gardens, it was nearly destroyed in 1995
after a horrific storm all but tore it apart; since then, $25 million has been
raised to repair and reinvent this San Francisco landmark.
Joggers and parents pushing baby strollers make regular use of the path
around manmade Stow Lake. The boathouse (% 415-752-0347) rents
paddle boats, bikes, and in-line skates by the hour, half-day, and full day.
If you aren’t driving, walking to the boathouse is a bit of a hike. The boat-
house is west of the Japanese Tea Garden on Martin Luther King Drive;
it’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 127

The N-Judah Muni Metro streetcar drops you off on Ninth Avenue and
Judah Street; walk 3 blocks to the park from there. Numerous bus lines
drive close to or into the park, including the 44-O’Shaughnessy, which
you can catch on Ninth Avenue; the 21-Hayes; and the 5-Fulton.
Golden Gate Park houses the following museums and attractions.
The Conservatory of Flowers
A fixture in guidebooks and tourist brochures, and nearly as recognizable
as the Golden Gate Bridge, the postcard-perfect Victorian Conservatory
of Flowers closed in 1995 after sustaining massive damage during a wild
storm. Prefabricated in Ireland in 1875 and erected in the park around
1878, reconstruction was finished in 2003, and the conservatory is back to
its exquisite self, with lines of delighted visitors snaking past the entrance.
Rare orchids, ferns, tropical plants, and a 100-year-old philodendron res-
cued from the wreckage are among the exhibits.
See map p. 122. Off John F. Kennedy Drive (near the Stanyan Street entrance). 
% 415-666-7001. www.conservatoryofflowers.org. Admission: $5 adults, $3
seniors and youth 12–17, $1.50 kids 5–11, under 5 free. Open: Tues–Sun 9 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
The de Young Museum
An eclectic permanent collection includes American paintings as well as
sculpture, textiles, African and Oceanic objects, furniture, and contempo-
rary crafts housed in a sprawling, copper-clad three-story complex that
opened in October 2005. If you want to make some sense of the collection,
consider taking one of the free docent tours offered daily at 10 a.m., 
11 a.m., 1 p.m., and 2 p.m. A highlight of the building is the 144-foot tower
offering unobstructed views (if the sky is clear) of the neighborhoods
beyond the park. Access to the tower is free, even if you don’t intend on
touring the museum.
See map p. 122. 50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Dr. (off John F. Kennedy Drive). % 415-863-
3330. www.deyoungmuseum.org. Admission: $10 adults, $7 seniors, $6 students
and kids 13–17, free for children under 13; $2 discount with Muni transfer. Open:
Tues–Sun 9:30 a.m.–5 p.m., until 8:45 p.m. Fri.
Japanese Tea Garden
This tranquil spot includes colorful pagodas, koi ponds, bridges, and a
giant bronze Buddha. Young children find this piece of the park particu-
larly memorable because they can climb over a steeply arched wooden
bridge. Passengers spill through the entry gate of this major tour-bus des-
tination with alarming regularity. To avoid the onslaught, arrive before 
10 a.m. or after 4 p.m. in summer. Japanese tea, accompanied by a few
paltry snacks, is served in the teahouse for $2.95 per person. Although the
garden is certainly worth the small admission fee, the food is not.
See map p. 122. 75 Tea Garden Dr. (to the left of the de Young Museum). % 415-752-
4227. Admission: $3.50 adults, $1.25 seniors and children 6–12. Open: Oct–Feb 
8:30 a.m.–dusk; Mar–Sept 8:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
128

Strybing Arboretum and Botanical Gardens
This splendid oasis contains more than 6,000 species of well-tended plants.
It’s exceptionally lovely in late winter, when the rhododendrons blossom
and wild irises poke up in corners, and no more peaceful a place exists
when the skies are drizzling. We recommend the guided tours — offered
daily at 1:30 p.m. — for anyone who finds identifying any but the most
basic of flowers and trees difficult. Plan to spend at minimum a half-hour
just wandering around.
See map p. 122. Ninth Avenue at Lincoln Way (turn left out of the tour-bus parking lot
by the Music Concourse). % 415-661-1316, ext. 314 for guided-tour information.
www.strybing.org. Admission: Free. Open: Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–4:30 p.m., Sat–Sun
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; free guided walks daily at 1:30 p.m.
Yerba Buena Gardens and Center for the Arts
Where once sat nothing but parking lots and derelicts, this 22-acre com-
plex now stands as a micro-destination. Interactive amusements include an
ice-skating rink, a bowling alley, a children’s garden and carousel, and an
arts/technology studio for older kids (Zeum). An entertainment behemoth
in a separate building across the street — the Metreon — houses restau-
rants, retail shops, an IMAX theater, and multiplex movie screens.
The center includes a collection of galleries showing a rotating exhibition
of contemporary visual and performance art by local artists, lovely gar-
dens, a stage for dance troupes including ODC/San Francisco and Smuin
Ballets/SF, and a film/video theater. If you take in all that Yerba Buena
Center has to offer, you can easily spend the entire day here. Parking’s
expensive; use public transportation, if possible.
See map p. 122. 701 Mission St. (between Third and Fourth streets). % 415-978-2700,
or 415-978-ARTS for the box office. www.yerbabuenaarts.org. To get there:
Muni Metro to Powell Street or Montgomery Street and walk 2 blocks east on Third
Street; or 14-Mission or 15-Third bus. Admission to the galleries: $6 adults and $3
seniors and students. Open: Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–6 p.m.
Zeum
This modern art/technology center is probably the only attraction spe-
cifically designed for older kids and teens that doesn’t rely on video games.
The hands-on labs give visitors the opportunity to create animated video
shorts with clay figures; learn about graphics, sound, and video in the pro-
duction studio; and interact with the changing gallery exhibits. Even bored
adolescents have difficulty resisting the Zeum offerings.
See map p. 122. Corner of Fourth and Howard. % 415-820-3320. www.zeum.org.
Admission: $8 adults, $7 seniors and students, $6 kids 5–18. Open: Wed–Sun 11 a.m.–
5 p.m. Sept–June; Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m. during the summer.
Pursuing the arts and other cool stuff to see and do
The California Palace of the Legion of Honor, in Lincoln Park 
between Clement Street and 34th Avenue in the outer Richmond 
Chapter 11: San Francisco 129

District (% 415-863-3330; www.legionofhonor.org), exhibits an
impressive collection of paintings, drawings, sculpture, and decorative
arts. The grounds around the palace are a draw as well, and there is 
a very nice cafe. The museum is open Tuesday through Sunday from 
9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., and admission is $10 adults, $7 seniors, $6 kids 13 to
17, free for kids younger than 13 (free for everyone on the second Wed 
of the month). Take the 38-Geary bus to 33rd and Geary, then transfer to
the 18-46th Avenue bus for a ride to the museum entrance.
The Cartoon Art Museum, 655 Mission St., near Third Street in SoMa
(% 415-227-8666; www.cartoonart.org), produces exhibits on all
forms of cartoon art and often showcases local cartoonists. It’s open
Tuesday through Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.; admission is $6 adults,
$4 seniors, $2 children 6 to 12.
At Fisherman’s Wharf, the Musée Mécanique (% 415-346-2000; www.
museemecanique.org) contains a fantastic collection of lovingly restored
and maintained mechanical marvels that were the forerunners to pinball
machines. Among the treasures, you can try your hand at World Series
Baseball, have your fortune told, and giggle wildly with Laughing Sal, all
for a quarter a pop. The museum is housed close to Pier 39 (actually at
Pier 45 at the end of Taylor Street), having moved from smaller, more
charming quarters near the Cliff House. Open Monday through Friday
from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
admission is free — but bring along a roll of quarters.
Taking a hike
Fort Point (% 415-556-1693), underneath the Golden Gate Bridge at the
tip of the peninsula, dates from 1857. It is an easy 31⁄2-mile stroll to Fort
Point from the Hyde Street Pier along the paved Golden Gate Promenade,
which hugs the coast as it passes through the Marina Green and the newly
relandscaped Crissy Fields through the Presidio. Alternatively, you can
reach Fort Point by taking the 28-19th Avenue or the 29-Sunset bus to the
Golden Gate Bridge and climb down from the viewing area to a short trail
leading to the fort. Open Friday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Named in honor of Sierra Club founder and conservationist John Muir,
553-acre Muir Woods (% 415-388-2595; www.nps.gov/muwo) is what’s
left locally of the redwood forests that once dominated the coast of
Northern California. Although not as sizable as Redwood National Forest
farther north, these old-growth redwoods are beautiful, and a range of
trails here suits hikers of all levels. From the Golden Gate Bridge, take
the Stinson Beach/Highway 1 exit west and follow the signs. Parking is
limited, so try setting out early in the day on weekends or go during the
week. Muir Woods is open from 8 a.m. until sunset.
Riding a bike
If you plan to ride in Golden Gate Park, your best bet for a rental is 
one of the bike stores nearby, such as Avenue Cyclery, 756 Stanyan St.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
130

(% 415-387-3155; www.avenuecyclery.com). Open daily from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m., you can rent mountain, city, or kid bikes for $5 per hour or $25
per day.
The Bike Hut at South Beach, on the Embarcadero at Pier 40 (% 415-
543-4335), is the place to find high-quality bikes to pedal along the
waterfront. It’s open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Rentals are $5 per 
hour or $20 per day.
And if you’re considering a bike trip across the Golden Gate Bridge, the
nice guys at Blazing Saddles at either the North Beach (1095 Columbus
Ave.) or Fisherman’s Wharf location (Pier 41; % 415-202-8888; www.
blazingsaddles.com) can provide you with all the information and
encouragement you need to tackle this route. The equipment for kids
and adults is shiny and well maintained. Rental prices are $7 per hour or
$28 per day and include helmets, locks, front packs, rear racks, maps,
and advice.
Walking the beach
Ocean Beach, at the end of Geary Boulevard on the Great Highway,
attracts picnicking families and teenagers looking for a place to swill
some beer. It’s great for oceanside strolls if the tide is low, and the waves
can be magnificent. Swimming is dangerous and prohibited, however.
The 38-Geary bus gets you within walking distance of the beach, or you
can take the N-Judah Muni Metro streetcar to the end of the line.
Soaking it up
For some pampering with a Japanese twist, take the 38-Geary bus to
Kabuki Springs & Spa, 1750 Geary Blvd., at Webster Street in Japantown
(% 415-922-6000; www.kabukisprings.com). This is a most respectable
communal bathhouse, where you can soak your feet, have a massage, 
or take a steam bath. Women may use the bathhouse on Sundays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays; men are accommodated on Mondays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays; Tuesdays are coed. Massages and other spa
services are by appointment daily from 10 a.m. to 9:45 p.m.
Sampling the local airwaves — live!
Kind of a poor man’s version of A Prairie Home Companion, West Coast
Live (% 415-664-9500; www.wcl.org) is a homegrown public radio
show broadcast in the Bay Area on Saturdays from 10 a.m. to noon.
Hosted by the honey-voiced Sedge Thomson, guests have included 
writers such as David Sedaris and Calvin Trillin, local musicians, and a
tiny cast of regulars. The show is broadcast from a rotating group of
venues in San Francisco and Berkeley; check the Web site for schedule
and ticket information.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 131

Seeing San Francisco by Guided Tour
An introductory tour is always a good bet if you have limited time to
explore the city. A variety of bus tours pass by the highlights and can
certainly provide an overview of the city, but there’s nothing to compare
to a few hours devoted to pounding the pavement. We also strongly rec-
ommend that you spend an hour or two out on the bay — it’s brisk,
beautiful, and will put a nice glow on your cheeks.
Puttin’ on that old soft shoe(s)
Friends of the Library sponsors City Guides walking tours (% 415-557-
4266; www.sfcityguides.org). These tours trod 26 different paths
each week, all for free — that’s right, no charge! All you have to do is
decide which tour appeals to you and show up at the proper corner on
time. You can explore the haunts of the original 49ers on the “Gold Rush
City” tour, admire the Painted Ladies (San Francisco’s collection of beau-
tifully resorted Victorian homes) on the “Landmark Victorians of Alamo
Square” tour, or get an insider’s view of Chinatown. We highly recom-
mend any of these tours.
Local cookbook writer and luminary Shirley Fong-Torres operates
Chinatown food tours that will have you classifying noodles like an
expert. Wok Wiz Chinatown Walking Tours and Cooking Center, 654
Commercial St., between Kearny and Montgomery streets (% 650-355-
9657; www.wokwiz.com), offers daily tours for $40 for adults and $35 for
kids younger than 11. Tours include a seven-course dim sum lunch.
The popular North Beach neighborhood reaches new heights of giddi-
ness on Saturdays when food writer GraceAnn Walden leads Mangia!
North Beach (% 415-397-8530; www.graceannwalden.net), a four-and-
a-half-hour, $80 walking, eating, shopping, and history tour. GraceAnn
and her followers traipse in and out of a deli, chocolate shop, bakery,
bookshop, pottery store, and two very fine churches before ending with
a multicourse, family-style lunch at one of her favorite restaurants. This
tour offers lots of samples, lots of tidbits about the Italians, and lots of
fun. Reservations are a must.
The Victorian Home Walk (% 415-252-9485; www.victorianwalk.com)
combines a trolley-car excursion with a walking tour through a number
of celebrated neighborhoods. During the two-and-a-half-hour tour, you
see an array of houses in areas where tour vans are prohibited. The cost
is $20. Tours leave daily at 11 a.m. from the lobby of the Westin St. Francis,
335 Powell St., between Geary and Post streets in Union Square.
Bay cruises
The bright yellow amphibious vehicles you may see bouncing around
bayside neighborhoods belong to Bay Quackers San Francisco Duck
Tours (% 415-431-3825; www.bayquackers.com). Its 80-minute tours
leave every two hours beginning at 9 a.m. from the Anchorage Mall at
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
132

Fisherman’s Wharf and ends up in the bay motoring around McCovey
Cove. If you time it right, you could enjoy an unusual view of a Giants’
baseball game. Tickets are $35 adults, $32 seniors/students, $25 kids
younger than 13. For $100 you can get a family ticket for two adults and
two children.
Our very own Golden Gate Transit (% 415-455-2000; www.goldengate.
org) operates ferry cruises from the Ferry Building at the foot of Market
Street to Sausalito or Larkspur in Marin. A round-trip cruise to the
pretty, but admittedly touristy, town of Sausalito sets adults back $13;
kids 6 to 18 are $6.40; kids younger than 6 are free. You have the thrill of
riding the waves past the Golden Gate Bridge, albeit without the onboard
commentary provided by the Blue & Gold Fleet (% 415-705-5555; www.
blueandgoldfleet.com; $20 for adults, $16 for seniors and kids 12–18,
$12 for kids 5–11) on their one-hour bay cruise.
Shopping ’til You Drop
Most people think of Union Square as the hub of San Francisco shop-
ping, but downtown has plenty of competition. Nearly every neighbor-
hood boasts a thriving “Main Street” of locally owned boutiques, cafes,
and bookstores. You can find shops with unique arts and crafts, clothing
stores that eschew chain-mentality fashion, even housewares havens
that reflect the style of the local clientele. Depending on where you
head, you can try on a different attitude as easily as a different outfit.
Union Square
With all big department stores within shouting distance of one another,
Union Square gets a body in the mood for retail therapy faster than you
can say, “Charge it!” Stand in the square and turn around slowly; you’ll
see Saks Fifth Avenue on the corner of Powell and Post streets (% 415-
986-4300), Neiman Marcus at Stockton and Geary streets (% 415-362-
3900), and Macy’s (% 415-397-3333) everywhere else.
A half-block north of Neiman’s on Stockton Street is Maiden Lane, which
is lined with designer shops. Gump’s, 135 Post St. (% 415-982-1616;
www.gumps.com), sells decorative goods, collectibles, and home furnish-
ings in a 1910 landmark building. Parallel to Stockton eastward is Grant
Avenue, with shoe-leather-halting stores such as Anne Fontaine, 118
Grant Ave. (% 415-677-0911), and the flagship Banana Republic, 256
Grant Ave. (% 415-788-3087).
Market Street continues its upward trajectory with the opening of the
humongous Bloomingdale’s, centerpiece of the new Westfield San
Francisco Centre. It’s next to the older one where Nordstrom’s is
located on Fifth and Market streets. Along with all the usual suspects
you find in an upscale mall, this one also has a day spa on the fifth floor,
a gourmet grocer in the basement, movie theaters, and dining establish-
ments with good pedigrees.
Chapter 11: San Francisco 133

Chinatown
Grubby curio shops line Grant Avenue, selling all manner of cheap trin-
kets and clothing. If you venture off Grant, you’ll find herbal shops and
jewelry stores filled with jade of varying quality. The merchants in the
less touristy stores don’t always speak English and may not seem
friendly, but don’t let that keep you from looking around.
Chong Imports, in the Empress of China building at 838 Grant Ave.,
between Clay and Washington streets (% 415-982-1432), stocks a little
of everything. Tai Yick Trading Company, 1400 Powell St., at Broadway
(% 415-986-0961), sells porcelain and pottery at reasonable prices;
locals swear this is the best store of its kind in town, and the owners 
are helpful and friendly. The Imperial Tea Court, 1411 Powell St., near
Broadway (% 415-788-6080), displays everything you’ll need to brew a
proper pot of Chinese tea — plus, it’s a nice place to stop and sip a cup.
Haight Street
Clothing is the big draw for shoppers — whether vintage or cutting 
edge — and you’ll locate apparel and shoes for all ages and stages. In
particular, look for Behind the Post Office, 1510 Haight St. (% 415-
861-2507), for accessories from local designers; Kids Only, 1608 Haight
St. (% 415-552-5445), for your flower child; Ambiance, 1458 Haight St.
(% 415-552-5095), for pretty dresses, stylish shoes, and somewhat retro
handbags; and Villians Vault, 1653 and 1672 Haight St. (% 415-864-7727
or 415-626-5939), for streetwear and shoes.
Hayes Street
Naming the hippest shopping street in the city would be difficult, but if
forced, we’d have to say Hayes Street. Start at Grove and Gough where
you’ll find the expanded MAC (Modern Appealing Clothing) store at 387
Grove St. (% 415-837-0615). From there, head 1 block south to Hayes
Street and start walking toward the Pacific. You can find a wealth of stuff
here, for all facets of your life, unless you live like a spartan or a monk; 
if that’s the case, you may want to stop at the Gaia Tree, 575 Hayes St.
(% 415-255-4848), for a yoga mat or maybe a facial or massage. If your
feet hurt, look for a more comfortable pair of shoes at one of the many
shoe stores here, including Paolo Iantorno, 524 Hayes St. (% 415-552-
4580), selling beautiful Italian-made creations for men and women to
decorate whatever’s below your ankles. Many of the stores on these
blocks are open Sunday afternoons.
North Beach
Completely different from the street of the same name in Chinatown 
or Union Square, Grant Avenue from Green to Greenwich streets has a
bohemian feel, with many stylish boutiques for clothes and accessories.
Biordi Art Imports, 412 Columbus Ave., at Vallejo Street (% 415-392-
8096), stocks the most beautiful hand-painted Majolica dishes and serv-
ing pieces — as close as you can get to eating off a work of art. City
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
134

Lights Bookstore, the famous Beat-generation bookstore founded by
renowned poet and Ginsberg crony Lawrence Ferlinghetti, sits on
Columbus Avenue at Broadway (% 415-362-8193), and is still a bastion
of left-of-center literature.
Union Street
Union Street between Fillmore Street and Van Ness Avenue in the Marina
District is the happy valley for folks who love wandering in and out of
specialty shops. Muni buses 22-Fillmore, 41-Union, 42-Downtown Loop,
and 45-Union/Stockton will get you here.
Carol Doda, who shaped a career out of her chest long before implants
were considered accessories, runs a lingerie shop, Carol Doda’s
Champagne and Lace, 1850 Union St. (% 415-776-6900). Outside your
sweater, cover yourself with beautiful adornments crafted by local artists
at Gallery of Jewels, 2101 Union St. (% 415-929-0259). Because man
does not live by cashmere alone, you may be interested in perusing the
Collectors Cave, 2072 Union St. (% 415-929-0231), which displays all
kinds of new and old comic books, action figures, and sports cards for
serious and not-so-serious collectors. Mudpie, 1694 Union St. (% 415-
771-9262), sells incredibly expensive children’s clothes and gifts. Sticker
shock is slightly alleviated in the downstairs salesroom.
Enjoying the Nightlife
Still have energy after all that sightseeing? Great; there’s lots to do. 
For up-to-the-minute nightlife listings, pick up a free copy of the San
Francisco Bay Guardian from sidewalk kiosks or in cafes (or check

Chapter 11: San Francisco 135
Going to market
Farmer’s market aficionados will find Saturdays at the Ferry Building at the foot of
Market Street more than satisfying. The majority of producers bring organically grown
foodstuffs, and you’ll discover unusual varieties of fruits and vegetables. The perfume
of the salt air, ripe fruit, and a whiff of lavender wafting past your nostrils is deeply
pleasurable; combined with the bay views, a busker playing standards on his saxo-
phone, and a plethora of tastes, the scene is magical. Inside the building, permanent
shops, most of which are open seven days a week, stock everything you need for a
feast plus all kinds of tempting items including books, chocolates, olive oil, kitchen
necessities, wine, and imported packaged foods. If you actually find yourself hungry,
this is where the Slanted Door (reviewed in the “Where to Dine” section earlier in this
chapter) has moved, or you can sit down at the MarketBar on the east end, stop at
Taylor’s Refreshers for fast food we approve of, or attempt to get a counter seat at the
Hog Island Oyster Bar.

Beach Blanket Babylon, baby
A veritable institution, Beach Blanket Babylon is the only-in-San-Francisco
musical revue famous for outrageous costumes and wildly inventive hats
that appear to lead lives of their own. The spectacle is so popular that even
after celebrating over 30 years of poking fun at stars, politicians, and San
Francisco itself, seats for the constantly updated shows are always 
sold out. Purchase tickets ($25–$80) through the TIX in Union Square 
(% 415-433-7827; www.theatrebayarea.org), online (www.beachblanket
babylon.com), by mail, or by fax at least three weeks in advance, espe-
cially if you want to attend a weekend performance. If you’re under 21,
you’re relegated to Sunday matinees, when liquor isn’t sold.

redundant. Nevertheless, here are some of our favorite tippling spots in
San Francisco.
Amber

time, this is your bar. It’s one of the few in town where inside smoking is

and exit at the top of Nob Hill.

town and books the hottest indie and pop bands. It’s a regular venue for
Noise Pop (www.noisepop.com), the indie music festival scheduled
around the last week in March.
628 Divisadero St. (between Grove and Hayes streets). % 415-771-1421. www.the

and edgy theater. For tickets to any performance, call the appropriate
box office directly or head online and order with a credit card.

and experimental theaters are scattered about the SoMa and Mission
districts in converted warehouses and gallery spaces. The preeminent
company in town is the American Conservatory Theater (ACT), which
produces a little of everything during its October to June season. The
sets and costumes are universally brilliant, and the acting is first-rate.
Productions take place in the lovely Geary Theater, 415 Geary St., at
Mason Street (% 415-749-2228; www.act-sfbay.org).
Opera
The San Francisco Opera season opens with a gala in September and

Chapter 12
Napa and Sonoma Valleys:
California’s Premier Wine
Country
In This Chapter
 Finding your way to and around America’s premier wine-growing regions
 Choosing a cozy lodging — and wining and dining, Napa and Sonoma style
 Savoring the best wine-tastings, tours, and attractions
 Pursuing other valley pleasures
Just an hour’s drive north of San Francisco is the gorgeous Napa
Valley, the most celebrated wine-growing region in the United States.
Less than 30 miles from end to end, this extraordinarily fertile area
brims with world-class wine-tasting rooms, excellent restaurants, and
marvelous resorts and country inns.
Visiting Napa Valley is akin to taking a trip to the south of France, with-
out the jet lag or the language barrier (or the lousy exchange rate). The
stresses and strains of regular life just fade away as you cruise gentle
Highway 29, the verdant valley’s main thoroughfare, stopping in at
wineries, pausing between tastings for a gourmet picnic and a bit of bou-
tique shopping.
Just to the west of Napa Valley along Highway 12 is the peaceful Sonoma
Valley. Sonoma Valley is quieter and less tourist-oriented — but equal to
its neighbor as a wine-growing region. First-time visitors may suspect
that there’s more to see and do in Napa, and they’ll be correct. But trav-
elers looking for a place in which to do nothing but eat, drink, and thank
their favorite deity that such a paradise exists will be happy as can be in
and around Sonoma.
You certainly don’t need to be a wine connoisseur to enjoy this section
of the state, but we guarantee that if you tour one or two of the wineries
we’ve mentioned, you’ll arrive home knowing a lot more about viticul-
ture than your average wine drinker. And if it happens that you don’t

know much about wine (except you know what you like), don’t feel
intimidated. Sure, some pretentious wine-tasting rooms do dwell among
the grape arbors, but the valleys are completely visitor-friendly and
downright welcoming to casual wine drinkers.
Another point worth mentioning: Neither Napa nor Sonoma valley will
be the bargain destination of your vacation. If you choose carefully, how-
ever, you’ll discover affordable places to stay, eat, and drink.
Timing Your Visit
Summer and autumn are the most popular seasons for touring the Wine
Country. The valleys are especially gorgeous in fall, and September and
October bustle during the grape harvest, or crush, which fills the air with
the sweet fragrance of must (the pulp and skins of crushed grapes). If
you plan to visit during these seasons, make reservations early.
As long as the weather is dry, the area is a treat during the winter and
spring, when the roads, restaurants, and tasting rooms are relatively
unclogged, and the hotels actually offer lower rates. With the vines
stripped of their heavy fruit, the valleys are not quite so beautiful, how-
ever, and touring can be a downright drag in the rain.
Weekends are always more crowded than weekdays, and the traffic
heading north on the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco on Friday
afternoons (and south on Sun afternoons) can be torture. Do what you
can to plan your visit midweek, while the weekenders are at work; not
only will you avoid the crowds and enjoy your stay more, but you’re
bound to save a few bucks on accommodations.
Although you can easily entertain yourself for a week here, three days
and two nights can provide an ideal introduction to the Wine Country.
That gives you plenty of time to start with a winery tour (you need to
take in only one to get a flavor of the wine-making process), spread out
your winery visits over the next couple of days, and work in some other
local pleasures — a hot-air balloon ride, perhaps, or some leisurely bicy-
cling or a spa treatment or two.
A single day simply can’t do the area justice and will leave you wanting
more. But if you can only spare a day out of your San Francisco time,
choose Napa Valley over Sonoma Valley. Start out from San Francisco
early, because virtually all the wine-tasting rooms shut their doors by 
5 p.m. Drive immediately to Calistoga, at the north end, and work your
way down the valley along Highway 29 to make your return to San
Francisco a bit shorter. Plan to visit no more than three to four wineries
(all anyone can really handle in a day, anyway), followed by an early
dinner before you head back to the city.
Don’t make this day trip on a summer weekend, because the bumper-to-
bumper traffic on Highway 29 will ruin it.

Getting There
You’ll have to drive if you want the best experience. If you’re a day-
tripper, you can take a guided tour from San Francisco, if need be.
Driving yourself
From San Francisco, two roads take you to the Wine Country:
 If you decide to take the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, head
east from downtown over the bridge (I-80) and north to the Napa/
Highway 29 exit near Vallejo; follow Highway 29 north into the heart
of the valley. The trip takes about 70 minutes.
 From the Golden Gate Bridge, continue on U.S. 101 north to Novato,
where you pick up Highway 37 east. Take Highway 121 (the Sonoma
Highway) north toward Sonoma and continue north on Highway 12,
or stay on 121 east to Napa, if that’s your destination, where you end
up on Highway 29. Make sure to have a map handy. This drive is
more scenic and takes about 90 minutes.
If you’re coming from the North Coast, take Highway 128 out of
Mendocino and follow the road straight into the north end of the valley,
which will take a little more than two hours.
From Lake Tahoe, pick up I-80 west and take it to Highway 12 for
Sonoma. This also will lead you in about 6 miles to Highway 29 north,
Napa’s main drag. Expect the drive to take about three and a half hours,
whether you’re coming from the north or south shore.
Along for the ride: Guided tours
If you don’t want to drive yourself to or around the Wine Country, you
can join an organized tour. Taking a tour is a good alternative if you need
a designated driver; otherwise, we strongly suggest the do-it-yourself
option. On a tour, you cover a lot of ground in way too short a time, you
don’t have the freedom to linger in places that catch your fancy, you
don’t have much of a choice as to where you eat, and you miss some
great wineries that aren’t part of the package.
That being said, the best tour operator is Great Pacific Tour Company
(% 415-626-4499; www.greatpacifictour.com), which picks you up
and delivers you back to your San Francisco hotel after tastings at two
Sonoma wineries, a restaurant or picnic lunch, and a tour of Domaine
Chandon, a sparkling-wine producer in Napa. The cost is $83 for adults,
$81 for seniors, and $71 for kids 5 to 11.
Another option is to ride the Napa Valley Wine Train (% 800-427-4124
or 707-253-2111; www.winetrain.com), basically a gourmet restaurant
on wheels that chugs 36 miles through the valley from end to end.
Lunch, brunch, and dinner tours range in price from $89 to $140 per
Chapter 12: Napa and Sonoma Valleys 143

person. These are dining and take-in-the-scenery rides only; if you’d
rather make a stop, ask about the Grgich Hills Private Winery Tour and
Tasting, a lunchtime ride ($110 per person), or the Domaine Chandon
Winery lunch excursion ($115 per person). The train sports a wine-
tasting car with an attractive bar and knowledgeable host. The three-
hour tours depart from 1275 McKinstry St. in downtown Napa, at the
south end of the valley. Reservations are essential.
If you don’t want to drive to Napa to pick up the train, Grayline (% 888-
428-6937; www.graylinesanfrancisco.com) arranges passage via bus
from San Francisco.
If you’re staying in Napa and just want some local guidance and a desig-
nated driver, Napa Winery Shuttle (% 707-257-1950; www.wineshuttle.
com), a small family-run enterprise, gets our vote for value and flexibility.
You and your shuttle driver plan the itinerary, although the company
does have some favorite wineries it likes to show off. The price is $52
per person for the day, which lasts from approximately 10:15 a.m. to 4 or
5 p.m.
Orienting Yourself
Napa Valley is compact and easy to explore. The town of Napa at the
south end is just 26 miles from Calistoga at the north end. Take a look at
the “Napa Valley” map on p. 145, and you find that the valley resembles a
ladder, with two main roads running (roughly) north-south — Highway
29, the main drag, along the west side and the Silverado Trail along the
east side — with east-west cross streets at regular intervals, every half-
mile or so. The valley is more commercial and developed at the south
end, growing increasingly bucolic and spread out as you move north.
The town of Napa is the commercial center of the Wine Country and the
gateway to Napa Valley. This is where the real people live — hence the
fast-food joints and strip malls. Stop by the visitor center (see the
“Gathering More Information” section at the end of this chapter) to pick
up a winery map, but don’t be in a big hurry to leave — there’s lots going
on in town, including Copia, the new temple to food, wine, and the arts.
Just north of Napa is Yountville. Both St. Helena and Calistoga boast more
old-fashioned charm, but Yountville wins in the convenience department.
Exciting restaurants abound, and you can’t be more centrally located.
Immediately north of Yountville is Oakville, then Rutherford, two blink-
and-you’ll-miss-them towns that really just qualify as map markers. Next
is St. Helena, about 18 miles north of Napa, an attractive little town with
upscale shops tucked away in beautifully restored wooden storefronts.
Around St. Helena, the terrain starts to open up and look like the agricul-
tural landscape it is. In another 8 miles, you reach Calistoga, California’s
version of Saratoga Springs, the east coast’s favorite spa town (the name

Napa Valley
Chapter 12: Napa and Sonoma Valleys 145

Calistoga is a cross of the two: California and Saratoga). This well-
preserved, extremely charming gold-rush town boasts the natural hot
springs that make the Wine Country a first-class spa destination, too. It’s
our favorite place to stay, although you spend a bit more time in the car
if you base yourself here. Because the driving is so gorgeous, it’s easily
worthwhile — but be aware of the distance, especially if your time is 
limited.
Be very careful while driving always-busy Highway 29. Even if you’re a
teetotaler, remember that virtually everybody else has imbibed a bit.
This two-lane road is the scene of many accidents, especially at night.
Sonoma Valley is smaller and even more rural than Napa Valley, which
guarantees that you can see it all in two days (see the “Sonoma Valley”
map on p. 147). It includes the towns of Sonoma, Glen Ellen, Kenwood,
Santa Rosa, and Healdsburg; two state parks; a few resorts, hotels, and
B&Bs scattered among the country roads; and some fine restaurants.
Where to Stay in the Wine Country
Despite a wealth of choices, high demand keeps room rates on the
pricey side. Almost all lodgings have a two-night minimum on weekends
and three nights during holidays. Make reservations as far in advance as
possible, especially for stays between May and October.
If the places we recommend are full, call Napa Valley Reservations
Unlimited (% 800-251-NAPA; www.napavalleyreservations.com), a
free central-reservations service. You can find other credible Napa Valley
reservations bureaus online at www.napavalleyonline.com.
The Sonoma Valley Visitors Bureau is located in Sonoma on the Sonoma
Plaza at 453 First St. E. (% 707-996-1090; www.sonomavalley.com). The
bureau has an “availability sheet” of rooms in case you forgot to make
reservations.
Count on 9 to 12 percent in taxes being tacked on to your hotel bill.

Best Western Stevenson Manor Inn

Calistoga
Situated just east of town, this pleasant motel offers great value in an
expensive neighborhood. The basic, but spacious, rooms are all non-
smoking, and boosted up a notch by fireplaces or whirlpool tubs, cable
TV, fridges, coffeemakers, and hair dryers, as well as on-property extras
including a pool, hot tub, and sauna and steam rooms. You can also get 
10 percent off services at the nearby Calistoga Village Inn & Spa. Guest
rooms with two queen beds won’t crowd the family, and kids younger than
12 stay free.

The Daughter’s Inn
$$$$
Napa
Downtown Napa has a good selection of B&Bs in converted Victorians, and
this family-run inn is among the best. It’s a smart choice for couples seek-
ing a little romance, but who also want a location that’s close to restau-
rants and whatever nightlife is available in the revitalized town of Napa.
The inn is completely nonsmoking and has a total of ten individually
designed, TV-free rooms — five in the mansion and five in a slightly more
private new building in the garden. The focal points in all are the cushy
beds and in-room Jacuzzis. In the heat of the summer, a more resortlike
hotel with a pool would probably be preferable, but in snuggling weather,
the Daughter’s Inn provides nearly everything you need.
See map p. 145. 1938 First St. % 866-253-1331. Fax: 707-255-3772. www.daughters

fast. MC, V.
Harvest Inn
$$$$–$$$$$
St. Helena
This Tudor-inspired complex was renovated in 1999, and all the rooms are
light, attractive, and spacious enough for a family. Recently, 20 new rooms
were added. Two pools and two Jacuzzis are set in lovely gardens against
a dramatic backdrop of mountains and vineyards. Lots of little luxuries
help justify the price, including feather beds, fireplaces, CD players, and
VCRs. The mid-valley location is central to everything.

Indian Springs

Calistoga
Booking these comfortable, old-fashioned bungalows in summer is not
easy; you have to edge out the families that come here year after year,
drawn by the excellent location and great value. (Hint: Call 48 hours ahead
to find out whether you can get in on a cancellation.) Guests can use the
Olympic-size mineral pool until late in the evening (day visitors must leave
by 6 p.m.). The wonderful spa offers a full range of treatments, including
mud baths.

Milliken Creek
$$$$–$$$$$
Napa
Cushy, chic, and romantic, the large, airy rooms in this intimate new inn
could have come straight out of Metropolitan Home. No luxury has been
overlooked, from Frette bed linens and L’Occitane bath products to can-
dlelight turndown service. The 3-acre creekside gardens are equally stun-
ning and private; you’ll find it difficult to tear yourself away, although many
excellent small wineries await along the Silverado Trail. The facility is com-
pletely nonsmoking, and children younger than 16 are not accepted.

Mount View Hotel
$$$–$$$$$
Calistoga
Ideally situated in the heart of Calistoga, this charming and attractively
restored historic hotel is a pleasing place to stay. Done in a cozy California-
country style, the rooms are comfortable and well appointed. The
secluded cottages, which have private patios with Jacuzzis, are worth the
tariff for romance-seeking couples. A pool and Jacuzzi in the cute court-
yard and a well-regarded spa round out the appeal.

Napa River Inn
$$$–$$$$$
Napa
The first boutique hotel to reach the city of Napa, the Victorian-influenced
Napa River Inn is housed in a converted 1884 warehouse complex that’s
part of a spiffy redevelopment project along the river. Sixty-six beautifully
designed and equipped rooms are situated in three buildings; our favorite
is the Embarcadero for its relative privacy. Standard rooms are dark; supe-
rior rooms have smaller bathrooms than deluxe rooms, but all include
robes, fridges, spa products, and other goodies. The location near Copia
(see the “Immersing yourself in food and wine” section later in this chap-
ter) and downtown Napa is also handy.

Renaissance décor, rooms are clustered throughout the lovely flowering
grounds, and are equipped with fireplaces, fridges, Jacuzzi tubs, coffee-
makers, and terry robes. Tennis courts and a heated pool make this a com-
fortable miniresort, good for couples exploring the area. Spa services are
available next door at the Villagio, its sister inn. Check for specials and
packages, which can make this a relative bargain.

El Pueblo Inn

Sonoma
This lovable, way-better-than-average motel is almost within walking dis-
tance of the Sonoma Plaza and is very well located for touring. Family
owned and run, it has an affable vibe, supported by comfortable, spacious
rooms in the buildings closest to reception. The corner units here have
fireplaces. Guest rooms in the original two-story building in the back are
less expensive given that the bathrooms are older and smaller. A pretty
garden and pool is next to a shaded patio and fitness room; it can get noisy
in the summer because the property abuts Highway 12. If we were bring-
ing the kids, we’d stay here without question. And if we were seeking
affordable lodgings, ditto.

Glen Ellen
A secluded and peaceful family-run B&B, the modest rooms here are small
but quaintly decorated, designed solely for relaxation. Each room has a
private entry, terry robes, and down comforters, and most have claw-foot
tubs with shower heads, but no phones or TV. If you happen to need those
modern gadgets, book one of the two spacious cottages that were recently
added to the property. A spa in the garden adds to the magic, and you can
sit on the verandas and gaze at the mountains.

money. Public and guest rooms are graciously decorated and smartly
maintained. Guests are treated to a generous breakfast, afternoon happy

hour, and cookies. With just 19 rooms, you’ll get as much attention as you
require from the staff, although actually obtaining a room in summer will
take advanced planning because this is a popular hotel for wedding par-
ties. Less than 2 blocks from the Sonoma Plaza, the location makes walk-
ing to dinner a simple treat. For romantic occasions, we’d prefer a more
secluded and luxurious hideaway such as the Kenwood Inn or Milliken
Creek, otherwise, a room here more than satisfies.

Kenwood
If price is no object, or you want an all-out splurge, this gorgeous inn —
reminiscent of villas on the Italian Riviera — is our pick over any hotel
we’ve visited in either valley. The faux-painted buildings appear almost
miragelike as you drive up the Sonoma Highway, the pale yellow stucco
blending into the landscape on a sunny day. Once inside, you’ll have no
desire to leave. Rooms have wood-burning fireplaces, feather beds, and
sensuous fabrics; the facilities — an inviting saline pool, a separately 
situated Jacuzzi, a cozy bar and cafe (for guests only), and spa rooms that
overlook vineyards — guarantee a feeling of sublime, luxurious seclusion.

MacArthur Place
$$$$–$$$$$
Sonoma
This divine, small hotel is a renovated Victorian that’s masterfully con-
nected to newer buildings. The rooms are spacious and comfy, with won-
derful four-poster beds that’ll make you think twice about getting up.
Contented guests relax at the small, well-staffed spa where the practiced
hands of a masseuse work out prevacation tension. Manicured gardens
surround a swimming pool, and a steakhouse restaurant in the 100-year-
old barn supplies room service.

Although the views from this private Swiss-inspired farmhouse encompass
the mountains and the ranch next door, it’s located less than a mile from
Sonoma’s town square. Antiques and collectibles decorate three big,
delightful cottages; inside the house, two pretty upstairs rooms have

Where to Dine in the Wine Country
With excellent restaurants at every turn, the Wine Country is a wonderful
place to eat well. However, the best dining rooms often book up ahead, so
reserve in advance. If you’re visiting on a weekend, calling before you
even leave home is a good idea.

FRENCH
Napa is experiencing a major growth spurt in hotels and especially in
restaurants, none with more to recommend it than this warm, casual
brasserie overlooking the Napa River. Part of the historic Hatt Building
development, Angèle serves typical French fare as interpreted by a chef
with access to the bounty of Northern California (although on one visit,
one of us had a craving for a hamburger, and Angèle’s was perfection on a
gourmet bun). A high level of professionalism at every turn makes this
spot a standout.

Foremost a wine shop, the wealth of bottles available here pretty much

Cindy’s Backstreet Kitchen
$$
St. Helena
CALIFORNIA
Cindy Pawlcyn (of Mustards Grill fame) opened this smaller, more low-key
eatery in 2001. Given that St. Helena gets its fair share of weekend wine
tasters, it’s a testament to her sensibility how much this two-story house
feels like a neighborhood hangout. A table in the garden is the ideal spot for
a Cobb salad or curried chicken and something cold (Cindy has a full bar
as well as fresh juice drinks). In the evening, small plates, such as rabbit
tostados or Piquillo peppers stuffed with cumin-scented beef seem made
for a local lager. Large plates include specials from the wood-burning oven,
fish of the day, and steak frites that’ll have you hunkered over your dish.
Use one of Cindy’s root beer floats, featuring homemade vanilla ice cream,
to teach kids the difference between ordinary and extraordinary.

Julia’s Kitchen

Napa
CALIFORNIA/FRENCH
Food preferences are entirely personal, but we think this bustling restau-
rant inside Copia (see “Immersing yourself in food and wine,” later in this
chapter) served the most delicious meal we ate on a working trip to the
valley. Named in honor of Julia Child, the kitchen uses organic produce
raised on the grounds, so even a simple green salad shines with bright
flavor, and life only gets better from there. The menu changes often, but we
loved the seared day-boat scallops and the roasted winter-squash skewer.
Portions are moderate, which is kind because desserts must be given their
due. You can eat here without paying an entrance fee to Copia.

A collaboration between Chef Todd Humphries (Campton Place, CIA

works handsomely with the solid menu. Humphries uses locally grown
produce and meats; you’ll usually find steak, grilled pork chops, salmon,
and pasta dishes — all of which sound a tad boring but aren’t because the
kitchen knows what it’s doing. A separate entrance or the central staircase
takes you to the downstairs bar where you don’t need reservations to eat.

Pearl

Probably the most low-key and certainly the most affordable, good restau-
rant in the valley, Pearl specializes in oysters (naturally) prepared in four
different ways (we can vouch for the barbecued ones). The Napa locals
consider this cheerful little place an adjunct to their home kitchens, so
you’ll see families tucking into healthy portions of linguini and clams, soft
tacos with two flavorful dipping sauces, or a straightforward roasted
chicken and mashed potatoes. This is absolutely the place to eat if one
more expensive gourmet meal threatens to finish you off. Enjoy patio

Touring the Wine Country
Napa Valley is home to more than 380 wineries (Sonoma has over 200),
some owned by corporations, and others the domain of individuals so
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
156

seduced by the grape that they abandoned successful careers to devote
themselves to viticulture. Although no correlation exists between the
size of a winery and the quality of the product — which has more to do
with the talents of the vintners and variables such as weather and soil
conditions — the bigger wineries offer more to visitors in terms of edu-
cation and entertainment.
Wineries in Napa (less so in Sonoma) are developing new ways to market
wine tasting as an educational/culinary event — and an expensive one at
that. In what we think is an effort to eradicate the notion that this is a
great way to cage free alcohol, most wineries charge at least a nominal
tasting fee and many are promoting sit-down food and wine pairings for
real money. Rubicon Estate (formerly Niebaum-Coppola) is a case in
point: You can’t even drive onto the property without paying $25 at the
gate per adult, just so they know you really, really want to be there (the
fee covers a tour and five tastes). Wine tasting has become serious busi-
ness in these parts.
If you want to find out more about grape growing and the blending and
bottling process, make the first winery you visit one that offers an in-
depth tour. Robert Mondavi offers an excellent introductory tour, as
does St. Supéry. Book the superb tour offered by Schramsberg if you’re
interested in the production of sparkling wine (aka champagne, although
only French winemakers from the Champagne region fundamentally
have the right to call it that).
Don’t expect a deal on wine purchased directly from the producers.
Wineries sell at full retail so as not to undercut their primary market,
wine merchants. Buy and carry only what you think you can’t get at
home. If you’re concerned that you won’t be able to locate a particular
vintage back at the ranch, most wineries offer mail-order service. 
How to tell a cab from a zin
The most prominent varieties of grapes produced in the area include
cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, and zinfandel grapes grown for red
wines, and chardonnay and sauvignon or fume blanc grapes grown for
white wines.
Of course, the best way to really tell a cab from a zin, in laidback
California wine-speak, is to read the label on the bottle. The label identi-
fies the type of grape used if the wine contains at least 75 percent of that
particular variety. The appellation of origin indicates where the grapes
were grown — either a viticulture area such as the Carneros region of the
Napa Valley, a county, or the state itself. The vintage date is important
because it explains when at least 95 percent of the grapes were crushed.
Because many wines taste better as they get older, and some years pro-
duce better grapes than others, you want to make a note of the vintage.
You can greatly enhance your knowledge of wine by tasting correctly —
and what better classroom than a French-style chateau smack in the

middle of a vineyard? Remember that wine appreciation begins by ana-
lyzing color, followed by aroma, then taste. You do this with your eyes
first, then your nose, then your mouth. Don’t be shy about asking ques-
tions of the person pouring — he’ll cheerfully answer your questions
because the more you discover about his product, the more likely you
are to become a steady customer. And that makes everybody happy!
Here are a few wine-tasting do’s and don’ts:
 Before the pour, sniff your glass. It should have a clean aroma. If
not, ask for a fresh glass.
 Never pour the wine yourself.
 Taste wines in the proper order: whites first, reds second, dessert
wines last. This reflects the order in which food is generally 
served — white wines with a first course, reds with a hearty main
course, and dessert wines with sweets.
 Swirl the wine to coat the inside of the glass. This introduces
more oxygen and helps open up the wine flavors and aromas.
 Smell the wine. Think about what the different aromas bring to
mind — spice, fruit, flowers, and so forth.
 Take a sip and coat the back of your tongue with the wine.
 Keep in mind that, along with baseball, wine tasting is one of the
few sports where spitting is not only allowed, it’s encouraged.
Just make sure you hit the target — a bucket or some other con-
tainer will be available for this purpose. Spitting is a nifty way to
sample many wines without becoming fuzzy-headed.
 Don’t mistake a tasting room for your friendly neighborhood 
bar — this is not the time to swill with drunken abandon. And
lose the chewing gum.

Dummies, by Mary Ewing Mulligan and Ed McCarthy (published by Wiley

The best Napa Valley wineries for first-time visitors
The Napa Valley is winery central, so the handful discussed here repre-
sent only the tip of the vine. But the valley contains plenty of other worth-
while wineries, so get a map (they are easily available throughout the
region — or contact one of the visitor bureaus noted in the “Gathering
More Information” section near the end of this chapter) and explore those
back roads.
In the listings in this section, we note current wine-tasting fees and tour-
ing policies; keep in mind that wineries can — and do — change their
policies. In any case, the tasting fee should always be clearly posted at
the tasting counter; if you’re not sure, ask.

they walk through the door by passing out glasses of sauvignon blanc.
After you relax, take the free half-hour tour through the production facil-

come to see the house. This stunning Michael Graves–designed winery is
a temple to modern winemaking. It’s plenty easy to while away a happy
hour or more here studying the terrific art collection, walking around the
sculpture garden, and picnicking on the vast lawn (you must reserve a

A Persian palace (think Persepolis) in Napa? No, you haven’t had one too
many, you’ve found Darioush. This eye-catching — to say the least —
building, clad in travertine stone mined in Iran, opened in 2004; the winery
itself has been producing since 1997. Tastings are offered, of course ($15
for a flight of four wines), but tours must be arranged in advance. We’d
make the call if only to peek at Darioush Khaledi’s private wine cellar. If
it’s available, try the 2004 signature Chardonnay, which has an amazing
pear-ish, creamy consistency from start to finish. Saturday through
Thursday a wine and cheese tasting is offered ($35) and every Friday is a
cheese intensive featuring Cowgirl Creamery ($65). A tip from one of the

You’ll recognize this grand Mission-style winery from the labels on
Mondavi’s popular wines. It’s a bit corporate, but excellent if you’re a

from the daily 75-minute To Kalon tour at $25 a pop (% 888-RMONDAVI,

Schramsberg
You can’t just stop by this elegant and completely unpretentious 200-acre
champagne estate — but advance booking one of the free, 90-minute by-

sparkling-wine producer in the United States, and the guided talk (followed
by a $25 tasting) is the country’s best sparkling-wine tour. You can explore
caves that were hand-dug a hundred years ago and get the lowdown on
the whole bottling process, which has hardly changed a whit since then.
Afterward, take a walk through the impeccable gardens. Book at least a

More Cool Stuff to See and Do
Tasting wine isn’t the only thing to keep you occupied on your trip to
the Wine Country. The following sections share the myriad other activi-
ties the region has to offer.
Picnicking the valleys
Sure, the restaurant scene is great — but hardly a better place on the
planet exists for picnicking than the Wine Country. A number of fabulous
gourmet grocers can supply the delicacies, and many friendly wineries
provide pastoral picnic grounds.
 Our favorite picnic supplier is the Oakville Grocery Co., 7856 St.
Helena Hwy. (Highway 29), at Oakville Cross Road (% 707-944-
8802; www.oakvillegrocery.com). Here you can put together
your own gourmet picnic from the excellent bread selection, the
deli counter (which runs from first-rate cold cuts to top-quality foie
gras), and yummy pastries.
 A lot less country store-ish is Dean & DeLuca, 607 St. Helena Hwy.
(Highway 29, north of Zinfandel Lane), St. Helena (% 707-967-9980;
www.deandeluca.com), the Big Apple’s favorite gourmet grocer.
Everything at this first-class mega-mart is beautifully displayed —
and very pricey. Still, you’ll get your money’s worth.
 Just across the street from Dean & DeLuca is V. Sattui Winery, 1111
White Lane (at Highway 29), St. Helena (% 707-963-7774; www.
vsattui.com), whose mammoth tasting room also serves as a
bountiful gourmet shop. If you buy here, you can also dine here on
the popular picnic grounds.
 It may be a bit out of your way (it’s north of Santa Rosa in
Healdsburg), but a most memorable stop is the Jimtown Store,
6706 State Hwy. 128, Healdsburg (% 707-433-1212; www.jimtown.
com). This former gas station supplies charm and country atmos-
phere along with delicious food and a fun, eclectic assortment of
wares. You can make a delicious picnic out of the boxed lunches
(try the home-baked ham sandwich with Jimtown’s sweet red
pepper and tomato spread), daily specials such as Basque ragout
or corn chowder, or the homemade spreads (spicy chipotle, Asian
peanut, fig, and olive) and breads. They even have their own
Jimtown label wine to add to your picnic basket.
Chapter 12: Napa and Sonoma Valleys 163

After you put your picnic together, where should you go? In addition to
V. Sattui, Clos Pegase, Cuvaison, Oakville Ranch, and St. Supéry are
among the many wineries that offer pleasant picnic spots (remember 
to reserve a table ahead at Clos Pegase).
Bringing a bottle of wine from one winery to enjoy at another is consid-
ered poor form. If you’re going to use a winery’s picnic grounds, buy a
bottle of wine inside first to enjoy during your alfresco meal.
Getting pampered in Calistoga
People have been taking to Calistoga’s rejuvenating mud baths — a
blend of ancient volcanic ash, imported peat, and naturally boiling min-
eral water, which simmers at a comfy 104°F — for more than 150 years.
Calistoga’s spas are generally friendly, rustic, comfortable places borne
out of a therapeutic tradition — nothing like the marble-tiled glamfests
that are most resort spas.
Treatments are relatively affordable. Expect to pay around $150 for a
mud bath and one-hour massage. You can reserve a tub, followed by a
mineral shower and a massage or a facial, at the following locations:
 Dr. Wilkinson’s Hot Springs, 1507 Lincoln Ave. (% 707-942-4102;
www.drwilkinson.com), probably the most well-known of
Calistoga’s spas
 Indian Springs, 1712 Lincoln Ave. (% 707-942-4913; www.indian
springscalistoga.com), a tad pricier but you get pool privileges
 Golden Haven Hot Springs Spa, 1713 Lake St. (% 707-942-6793;
www.goldenhaven.com), which boasts late hours and private mud-
bath rooms for couples
 Calistoga Spa Hot Springs, 1006 Washington St. (% 707-942-6269;
www.calistogaspa.com), whose mud bath/massage packages are
a very good buy
Check for Internet specials. And if mud just sounds icky to you, these
spas all offer alternatives, such as salt baths and aromatherapy wraps.
Hot-air ballooning
Soaring over the vineyards under a colorful balloon, with just a few
other souls sharing your basket, is an experience. Bonaventura Balloon
Company (% 800-FLY-NAPA or 707-944-2822; www.bonaventura
balloons.com) is one of Napa’s most trusted hot-air balloon operators,
with a range of packages available from $198 per person. Or call Napa
Valley Aloft/Adventures Aloft (% 800-944-4408 or 707-944-4408;
www.nvaloft.com), whose early-morning lift-off includes a preflight
snack and a postflight brunch with bubbly. At $195 to $250 per person
(depending on the number of persons and extras you choose), however,
you may want to keep those feet on the ground.

Heeding the call of the wild and the outdoors
Jack London State Historic Park, 2400 London Ranch Rd., near Glen
Ellen in Sonoma County (% 707-938-5216; www.parks.ca.gov), is
where the prolific author of The Call of the Wild lived before his death in
1916 at age 40. You can walk on trails to the ruins of Wolf House, London
Lake, and Bath House. A museum/library with first editions of London’s
works and personal memorabilia are on the grounds, as well. It’s open
daily from 9:30 a.m. to dusk.
Art turns up in the most unexpected places, but none more so than the
di Rosa Preserve (% 707-226-5991 ext 25; www.dirosapreserve.org).
This 217-acre indoor/outdoor gallery located 61⁄2 miles west of Napa on
Highway 121, displays over 2,000 works amid meadows, hanging from
trees, and throughout the former winery. Rene di Rosa, a former journal-
ist and viticulturist, owns the property. Guides conduct one-hour intro-
ductory and two-and-a-half-hour tours Tuesday through Saturday. You
must make a reservation for the tours; admission is $10 for the one-hour
tour and $15 for the longer version.
The Old Faithful Geyser of California, off of Highway 29 north of
Calistoga at 1299 Tubbs Lane (% 707-942-6463; www.oldfaithful
geyser.com), is one of only three “old faithful” geysers in the world.
This one has been blowing off steam at regular intervals for just about as
long as anyone can remember. The 350°F water spews out to a height of
about 60 feet every 30 minutes or so (depending on barometric pres-
sure, the moon, tides, and tectonic stresses). Is it worth the price of
admission ($8 for adults, $7 for seniors, $3 for children 6–12)? Well,
when we were standing in the ratty tract of yard surrounding the “natu-
ral wonder,” a Japanese tourist visiting with her young son turned to us
and asked plaintively, “Is this it?” Old Faithful is open daily from 9 a.m. to
6 p.m. (to 5 p.m. in winter).
Immersing yourself in food and wine
Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, 500 First St.,
Napa (% 707-259-1600; www.copia.org), opened in the fall of 2001 in the
city of Napa and has quickly become one of the must-see attractions in
the valley. Reasons for its immediate popularity are obvious: Copia cel-
ebrates the finer things in life in a modern, museum-like setting, although
it’s neither solemn nor overly reverential. One permanent exhibit, an inter-
active presentation on the role of food and wine in U.S. society, is both
accessible and amusing. In addition, a state-of-the-art theater hosts con-
certs, lectures, and films; a full roster of wine and food courses is offered
year-round; and a 500-seat concert terrace overlooking the Napa River,
surrounded by Copia’s orchard and organic gardens, provides warm-
weather amusement. A great restaurant (Julia’s Kitchen — see the “Where
to Dine in the Wine Country” section earlier in this chapter), a wine bar,
and, of course, a gift shop complete the experience. Check the Web site
for current activities during your trip and try to take in an exhibit, a class,
a concert, or a meal — or all four, if time allows! Admission is $5 adults, $4
Chapter 12: Napa and Sonoma Valleys 165

seniors and students, and free for children 12 and younger. It’s open
Wednesday through Monday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Many olive trees are planted at wineries and in groves around Sonoma
Valley. Olives have become an important crop, and olive-oil tastings are
a popular activity now. You can debate the merits of various extra-virgin
olive oils in Glen Ellen at the Olive Press, 14301 Arnold Dr. (% 888-965-
4839 or 707-939-8900; www.theolivepress.com). The press works 
24 hours a day between October and March. Watch the process from the
tasting room, while sampling the award-winning olive oil and checking
out the olive-themed merchandise.
If you have an abiding interest in cooking, sign up for a three- to four-
hour class at Ramekins, 450 W. Spain St., Sonoma (% 707-933-0450;
www.ramekins.com), a small B&B and culinary school next to the
General’s Daughter restaurant. During the day, take in the demonstration
classes; in the evening, glean culinary tips from some major Bay Area
chefs. Students have ample opportunity to sample the goods with a few
glasses of wine. Call for a catalog.
Gathering More Information
Call the Napa Valley Conference and Visitors Bureau (NVCVB) at 
% 707-226-7459, or go online to www.napavalley.com. After you arrive,
stop by the NVCVB’s office at 1310 Napa Town Center in downtown Napa
(exit Highway 29 at First Street), where you’ll find helpful counselors on
staff as well as a wealth of information.
The Sonoma Valley Visitors Bureau is located in Sonoma on the Sonoma
Plaza at 453 First St. E. (% 707-996-1090; www.sonomavalley.com). Stop

Chapter 13
Mendocino
In This Chapter
 Planning your visit to the rugged North Coast’s most refined little town
 Finding the ideal places to stay and dine
 Taking in the town and surrounding area
F
or a taste of California’s wild and wonderful North Coast, Mendocino
is the perfect place. This secluded, artsy, and enchanting town is a
West Coast version of a New England seashore village (it actually served
as the location for Cabot Cove, Maine, in the old television series Murder,
She Wrote). Mendocino is magically situated atop craggy headlands that
jut out into the Pacific, giving the town a ruggedly gorgeous coastline on
three sides. The spectacular setting — a world apart from the seaside
landscape farther south, even near San Francisco — makes it an ideal
spot for a bit of nature-inspired relaxation.
Hugely popular as a romantic getaway from the Bay Area, the town is
dedicated to the laid-back, weekending life. You won’t find a whole lot 
to do in Mendocino — and that suits weary travelers just fine. Couples
come to stroll, shop, bike, hike, and generally take it easy. Families are
welcome, naturally, although kids may not be happy campers among the
expensive shops and arts-and-crafts galleries.
Mendocino also offers a good starting point for exploration of California’s
one-of-a-kind Redwood Country (see Chapter 14).
Timing Your Visit
Summer or early fall is the best time to come. Mendocino is lovely from
May through mid-October. Don’t expect warmth, though: Average highs
run between 59°F and 66°F, and lows can dip below 50°F even in August.
Mornings are misty and generally give way to afternoon sun; fog prevails
in July and August and sometimes early September. Dress warmly and in
layers. Leave your bathing suit in your suitcase, because these waters are
never warm enough for swimming. If you travel inland, up the Redwood
Highway, expect temperatures to increase as much as 15 or 20 degrees.

Visit during the week to avoid the maximum-capacity crowds, highest
room rates, and mandated two-night minimum stays.
The weather can be a crapshoot in winter (frankly, this far up the coast,
it can be a crapshoot at any time of year). Still, winter’s not much colder
on average than summer — about 10° across the board — and you’ll
save a bundle on accommodations. You’ll also find yourself in prime
whale-watching territory if you visit between mid-December and mid-
April. If you happen to be traveling at the end of January, you can enjoy
two of our favorite California pastimes — dining on crab and tasting
wine — when Mendocino restaurants celebrate Dungeness crab season.
Don’t be surprised if you run into some rain, though.
How much time do you need? Two nights will do the trick. You may want
to stop by just for one night, to sample the vibe on your way up to the
Avenue of the Giants (see Chapter 14), but if you aren’t in a hurry, a
second night is worthwhile.
Getting There and Getting Around
Mendocino’s seclusion is a big part of its charm (see the “Mendocino
and Redwood Country” map on p. 169) — but that also makes reaching
it a slight challenge. The town is 155 miles from San Francisco and 
95 miles from the north end of Napa Valley. No major highway runs to
Mendocino; you have to battle either the slow-going mountains or the
even-slower-going coastal roads to get there.
 From San Francisco: The fastest route is to take U.S. 101 north to
Cloverdale, take Highway 128 west to Highway 1, and then go north
along the coast. The drive takes about four hours.
 From Napa Valley: The valley’s main highway, 129, meets up with
Highway 128 in Calistoga, at the north end. Follow 128 West all the
way to the coast, which takes two and a half to three hours.
Highway 128, which crosses the mountains, is a curving, nausea-inducing
route all the way from U.S. 101 to the coast, which is the bulk of the trip
no matter what your starting point. If you have a sensitive tummy and
would prefer to keep your nausea in check, take U.S. 101 to Willits, pick
up Highway 20 west to the coast, and head south on Highway 1. This
alternative route adds 45 minutes or an hour to your trip — and
Highway 20 is no joy, either — but it’s an appreciably smoother ride.
The most scenic drive from the Bay Area is to take the coastal route,
Highway 1, all the way. The drive is stunning, but expect it to take six
long hours.
After you’ve arrived in Mendocino, park your car and set out on foot.
The town is entirely walkable and easy to get a handle on. Main Street
runs perpendicular to Highway 1 along the oceanfront. Lansing is the

Where to Stay
Most lodgings require a two-night minimum stay on weekends and three
nights over holidays. Count on 10 percent in taxes being tacked on to
your hotel bill at checkout time.
Contact Mendocino Coast Reservations (% 800-262-7801 or 707-937-
5033; www.mendocinovacations.com), a free central reservations serv-
ice, if our favorites are full.
If Mendocino’s high rates are too much for you, trek 10 miles up
Highway 1 to Fort Bragg and the value-minded Harbor Lite Lodge, 120 N.
Harbor Dr. (% 800-643-2700 or 707-964-0221; www.harborlitelodge.
com). From the highway, this rustic motel hasn’t much in the way of 
curb appeal, but the spacious rooms, for $75 to $163 depending on the
season, have pretty river views. Ask for a room away from the bridge to
avoid traffic noise. Just down the road and a giant step up is the Lodge
at Noyo River, 500 Casa del Noyo Dr. (% 800-628-1126 or 707-964-8045;
www.noyolodge.com). The accommodations in this attractive Craftsman-
style B&B cost a bit more dough — anywhere from $99 to $175 double
with special rates in the winter — but rates include a lavish buffet break-
fast, authentic Victorian décor, and a much more secluded location along
the river.
Alegria Oceanfront Inn & Cottages
$$$–$$$$
Mendocino
This charming former sea captain’s home is the only accommodation in
town with direct beach access. Gorgeous ocean views, pretty gardens, and
two of the mellowest innkeepers in the business set a warm, relaxing
coastal tone. Each comfortable room has a private entrance, a coffeemaker
and fridge, a TV, and either a fireplace or a wood-burning stove. The copi-
ous redwood decks with Adirondack chairs offer views galore and are a
fine place to retire while digesting breakfast made from organic and local
products. It’s truly Mendo marvelous!

If you can get past the hokey Old West theme (and few kids can, so bring
’em), you’ll enjoy one of the best values on the coast. The motel is
designed as a frontier town — the rooms have names like the Barber Shop,

the Millinery (one of the best for ocean views), and the Livery Stable.
Inside, rooms are bright, pretty, spacious, and spotless; even the cheap-
est has a sitting area, a well-dressed king-size bed, and the Pacific in the
distance. Set on a bluff on the inland side of Highway 1, it’s a long walk or
a two-minute drive into town. Resident deer contribute to the storybook
ambience.

Little River Inn
$$–$$$$$
Little River
One of our favorite places to stay in Mendocino, the main buildings are sit-
uated off Highway 1, a few minutes’ drive from the village. With the feel of
a resort, but completely unpretentious, this family-owned and -operated
inn encompasses a 9-hole golf course and pro shop, two lighted tennis
courts, a spa, a restaurant, and a most congenial bar. Many rooms have
ocean views and range from motel-like simple to outrageously luxe with
full-on views, stereos, Jacuzzis, and hot tubs on private decks. Room serv-
ice is available, which is unique in this part of the woods.

MacCallum House Inn
$$–$$$$
Mendocino
An attractive mixture of Victorian romance and modern-day amenities
(such as wireless Internet access and a popular cocktail lounge) has
turned the MacCallum House (remodeled in 2002) into the village hot spot.
Guestrooms, some inside the mansion and the rest scattered around the
manicured grounds, have DVD players, sleigh beds with down comforters,
and private bathrooms. Suites in the barn also include sofa beds if you
need extra sleeping space. A trio of young owners — two of whom worked
in the highly regarded MacCallum House restaurant as high-schoolers —
has infused this historic inn with great energy and attention, and guests
can expect a high level of service.

Mendocino Hotel & Garden Suites
$$–$$$$
Mendocino
This 1878 hotel (a leftover from Mendocino’s logging days) is a popular
choice in the heart of town, especially if the sometimes-stifling intimacy
of a B&B isn’t your thing. A mix of antiques and reproductions evokes the
Chapter 13: Mendocino 171

gold-rush spirit, yet all modern comforts are available. Rooms are spread
throughout a 2-block complex; those in the actual hotel aren’t equipped
with televisions — and some are pretty tiny. Many of the preferable garden
rooms feature fireplaces or wood-burning stoves as well as TVs. Avoid
rooms in the back over the kitchen, because they can be noisy early in the
morning.

Stanford Inn by the Sea
$$$$–$$$$$
Mendocino
If you intend to spend the big bucks on lodging, this rustic-sophisticated,
family-owned and -managed lodge is the place to do so. It sits on extraor-
dinary tiered grounds populated by llamas, horses, and other critters in a
woodsy setting near the Big River, a five-minute drive from town. The wood-
paneled rooms are done in a supremely comfy California-country style and
boast working fireplaces, fridges, and VCRs; the suites are great for fami-
lies. The grounds feature a gorgeous greenhouse with a lap pool, sauna, and
Jacuzzi; a gym; a spa; a fantastic vegetarian restaurant (The Ravens); and
canoes and mountain bikes for rent. It’s one of the pet-friendliest hotels in
California, too. If views are important to you, ask for a room in the original
building; if you prefer more square footage, request a room in the newer
Forest Building.

$195–$305 double, $215–$785 one- or two-bedroom suite. Rates include full break-
fast, afternoon tea, and evening hors d’oeuvres. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Where to Dine
Far be it for us to encourage hotel dining, but this area has four quality
exceptions. See the hotel listings in the preceding section for contact
information.
 The MacCallum House Restaurant at the MacCallum House Inn is
wonderful for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. It’s a bit more formal than
most restaurants in town, with exemplary service and pleasing con-
tinental cuisine with California flair. Main courses run $24 to $37.
 Mendocino Hotel’s Victorian Dining Room Restaurant and Garden
Café has kept its historic feel but the cooking is up-to-date. The $49
tasting menu ($65 with wine) is quite the bargain. Otherwise, entrees
are from $19 to $38.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
172

 Stanford Inn by the Sea also has a pretty dining room, The Ravens,
which serves creative vegetarian cuisine prepared with organic
homegrown veggies; entrees cost $18 to $35.
 The Little River Inn is the place to eat during crab season in particu-
lar, when crab cakes and local Dungeness — steamed, cracked, and
served with two dipping sauces — are available. The Mediterranean-
influenced menu is well executed; entrees range from $19 to $28.
From mid-November through January, some well-known Mendocino
restaurants, including Cafe Beaujolais and the Moosse Café, close for
weeks or even months depending on demand. If you’re visiting during
the winter, phone ahead if you have your heart set on eating in these
halls of fame. But don’t worry about going hungry if your timing is off —
the hotel restaurants serve year-round.

Exploring around Mendocino
The primary occupation of most visitors to Mendocino is . . . well, noth-
ing. Most people come to stroll through town, enjoy the charming sea-
coast vibe, soak up the views, and separate themselves from some of
their disposable income.
Sampling the arts (and shops)
Gallery hoppers should head to the visitor center at the Ford House
Museum to pick up the Mendocino Gallery Guide, which offers a good
gallery map. If local lore interests you, visit the Ford House Museum,
735 Main St., at the end of Kasten Road (% 707-937-5397), and the
Kelley House Museum, 45007 Albion St., just a few doors down and
across Main Street (% 707-937-5791), both legacies from Mendocino’s
19th-century boomtown days as the logging capital of the North Coast.
A great place to start gallery-hopping is the Mendocino Art Center,
45200 Little Lake St., 1 block west of Kasten Street (% 707-937-5818),
Mendocino’s unofficial cultural headquarters. Multiple gallery exhibits are
always on display; you can find plenty of art to buy and lovely gardens.
Straightforward shopping highlights include Mendocino Gift Company,
321 Kasten St., just off Main Street (% 707-937-5298), which features the
work of local craftspeople. Also stop in at Moore Used Books/Main
Street Bookshop, 990A Main St., across from the Presbyterian church
(% 707-937-1537), a pleasing shop that used-book hounds seek out.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
174

Exploring the headlands
Basically, all the waterfront territory that surrounds town makes up
Mendocino Headlands State Park. In spring, wildflowers blanket the
spectacular area; winter is a great time to watch for California gray
whales that cruise close to shore between mid-December and mid-April.
Three miles of easy trails wind through the park; stop by the visitor
center at the Ford House (described in the preceding section) for an
access map. Easiest access is behind Mendocino Presbyterian Church,
on Main Street, where a trail leads to stairs that take you down to a small
but picturesque beach.
Drive out to Heeser Drive (via Little Lake Road) to reach more remote
areas of the park. A number of parking lots along the route lead to short
trails and magnificent views along the wild coast, which reminds us very
much of Scotland. (Aye!)
Big River Beach, the park’s finest stretch of sand, is accessible from the
highway just south of Comptche-Ukiah Road. The beach is good for pic-
nicking, walking, and sunbathing, but don’t even think about going in the
frigid water.
Big River Beach meets the mouth of the Big River, which you can explore
via top-sitting kayak or canoe. Double kayaks rent for $20 per hour ($60
for the full day) from Catch a Canoe & Bicycles, Too!, just below the
Stanford Inn at Highway 1 and Comptche-Ukiah Road (% 707-937-0273;
www.stanfordinn.com). They’ll also rent you a top-flight mountain bike
for $10 per hour ($30 a day).
Visiting Russian Gulch
Several state parks dot the rugged coastline around Mendocino. The
best of the bunch is Russian Gulch State Park (% 707-937-5804 or
707-937-4296; www.parks.ca.gov), located off Highway 1 about 2 miles
north of Mendocino. It’s more remote and forested than Mendocino
Headlands, and quite spectacular. Picnic Area Drive leads right to the
park’s main attraction, a churning collapsed sea cave with swirling tides
called the Devil’s Punchbowl that’s well worth checking out. The well-
marked, 3-mile Falls Loop Trail is an easy walk through the redwoods to
a lovely waterfall. The day-use fee ranges from $4 to $6.
Riding the Skunk Train
Riding the Skunk Train is an easy way to see the redwoods without
having to drive yourself. Founded in 1885 as a logging railroad, the
Skunk Trains (% 800-866-1690 or 707-964-6371; www.skunktrain.com)
are vintage train cars that take you through gorgeous — and otherwise
inaccessible — North Coast redwood territory. (Originally gas powered,
the trains emitted a distinctive odor that prompted locals to claim “you
can smell ’em before you can see ’em” — hence the name.) The line runs
40 miles between Fort Bragg and Willits to the north. The costs vary by
Chapter 13: Mendocino 175

route, season, and the type of train you’re riding in (be it steam, diesel,
or a motorcar), but generally run between $20 and $45 for adults and $10
to $20 for children. Book summer excursions a month in advance. The
depot is west of Main Street between Laurel and Pine streets in down-
town Fort Bragg.
Speaking of Fort Bragg . . .
Fort Bragg is the commercial hub of North Coast life (car dealerships,
fast-food joints — you get the picture). It’s also home to the Mendocino
Coast Botanical Gardens, 18220 N. Hwy. 1 (% 707-964-4352; www.
gardenbythesea.org). This lovely public garden blooms year-round
and features gentle trails with terrific ocean views — well worth a
couple of hours for green thumbs. Admission is $7.50 for adults, $6 
for seniors, $3 for kids 13 to 17, $1 for younger kids. The gardens are
open March through October daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and November
through February daily from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The main trails are wheel-
chair accessible.
You can book winter whale-watching excursions and deep-sea fishing
charters for tuna, halibut, and salmon at Fort Bragg’s Noyo Harbor. Call
the Noyo Fishing Center (% 707-964-3000; www.fortbraggfishing.
com).
Gathering More Information
Before you arrive, call the Fort Bragg/Mendocino Coast Chamber 
of Commerce (% 800-726-2780 or 707-961-6300) or point your Web
browser to www.mendocinocoast.com. You can visit the chamber’s
walk-in center in Fort Bragg at 332 N. Main St. (Highway 1), between
Laurel and Redwood streets, across from the Guest House Museum. For
other online information, the Mendocino County Alliance gives an excel-
lent overview of the area on its Web site at www.gomendo.com.
In Mendocino, stop at the Ford House Museum, on the ocean side of
Main Street near Kasten (% 707-937-5397). Free publications and maps
are available at shops and restaurants around town, and your hotel can
also supply you with a wealth of information.
For more information on Mendocino’s state parks, visit the official
California State Parks Web site at www.parks.ca.gov; follow the “Find a
Park” link to search for parks by name, county, region, or even activity.
At the visitor center, ask for a copy of the Mendocino Coastal Parks
Guide, an informative newspaper well worth the 25¢ price tag.

Chapter 14
Redwood Country
In This Chapter
 Deciding on the length of your visit
 Separating the trees from the cheese along the Avenue of the Giants
 Finding a place to stay and dining among the redwoods
You need not drive all the way up to Redwood National and State
Parks, in the far reaches of Northern California near the Oregon
border, to experience the state’s giant redwoods. Frankly, by the time
you get there, some 300 miles north of San Francisco, you’ll have already
seen enough of the towering trees to last a long while. A day excursion
from Mendocino (see Chapter 13) that takes you partway up the famed
Avenue of the Giants –– or a trip that incorporates one night in
Mendocino with a second night farther north along the route — 
provides plenty of exposure to the majestic trees. The Avenue of the
Giants is a 32-mile scenic byway that follows a portion of the old two-lane
Highway 101, and parallels the modern freeway (as well as the Eel River)
from Phillipsville at the south end to Pepperwood at the north. The
“giants” are the magnificent coast redwoods, the tallest trees on Earth,
which often exceed 300 feet in height. These trees are the longer, lankier
cousins to the stout giant sequoias of the Sierra Nevadas. The Avenue is a
relatively easy drive, curvaceous but not too challenging, that passes
through some of the most spectacular territory in California. If you drive
to Humboldt Redwoods State Park (roughly the midpoint of the route),
you’ll witness the largest stand of virgin redwoods in the world.
Unfortunately, you won’t see just pristine nature. Tourist traps blight the
route, peppering the gorgeous highway with a schlocky sideshow. From
drive-through trees to a statue of Bigfoot, many of the attractions feel
like leftovers from the Eisenhower era –– a ’50s B-movie that’s lost its
kitschy kick. The good news is that the sheer majesty of the trees makes
stomaching this cheesiness easy.
Refer to the “Mendocino and Redwood Country” map in Chapter 13 to
get your bearings and locate accommodations, dining, and attractions in
Redwood Country.
That being said, we don’t want to pay short shrift to the remainder of
the state. Should you have a desire to explore past Eureka, Highway 101
plays tag with the Pacific above Humboldt Bay through the Redwood

National and State Park to Crescent City. You’ll find miles of sandy
beaches, tide pools, hiking trails galore, elk herds roaming around
Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park (just above the town of Orick, 45 min-
utes north of Eureka), and a lovely 10-mile drive along the coast and
within the redwoods on the Newton Drury Scenic Parkway.
Timing Your Visit
Whether you visit the Avenue of the Giants on a day trip or stretch this
part of your holiday into an overnighter, try to set aside plenty of day-
light hours to truly appreciate the mammoth redwoods.
Day-tripping from Mendocino
You can make the Avenue of the Giants a day trip from Mendocino, leav-
ing in the morning and returning for dinnertime. (This timetable works
best in summer, when you have more daylight hours to enjoy.)
You don’t have to follow the entire route to get an eyeful of the tall trees.
You can stop for lunch at a number of towns along the way; getting back
on U.S. 101 is easy at about a half-dozen points if you tire of the mean-
dering roadway. If you have good day-trip stamina, you can travel as far
as Humboldt Redwoods State Park and back in a day, with time to stop
for some communing with nature. The drive is just less than 100 miles
(two and a half hours in each direction, not counting stops).
If that sounds like too much for you, just go as far as Richardson Grove
State Park, off Highway 101 before the start of the Avenue, about 68
miles (one and a half to two hours) north of Mendocino. This park
makes a great place to discover the coastal redwoods, which serve as
the area’s main tourist attraction. Also, the first leg of the drive takes
you past some spectacular coastline. Beyond the park lies more of the
same, with one-horse logging towns and souvenir stands thrown in.
However, you find some marvelous pristine stretches if you venture far-
ther, with pullouts to hiking trails and day-use areas.
Because pickings are slim along the route, putting together a picnic
lunch at Mendocino Market or Tote Fête, 10450 Lansing St., at Albion
Street, before you leave Mendocino is a good idea, especially if you’d like
more than a grilled-cheese sandwich from a lunch counter. Or stop off 
in Fort Bragg at the excellent Harvest Market, 171 Boatyard Dr., where
Highway 1 meets Highway 20, which has a gourmet deli and a sushi bar.
The drive presents plenty of picnic spots from which to choose.
Finding options for overnighters
If you want to spend more time among the trees, you can (see the
“Where to Stay along the Route” section later in this chapter). If you
want to take it slow, consider setting aside a full day to meander north
from Mendocino and up the Avenue of the Giants; then stay in a Ferndale
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
178

or Eureka B&B for a night (it’s 134 miles to Ferndale, 145 to Eureka). In
the morning, hop on U.S. 101 for a speedy return south.
If your goal is the redwoods and you don’t care about the coast — or
someone in your party forgot her Dramamine and Highway 1 just isn’t
going to cut it –– skip Mendocino altogether. The weather is much
warmer and sunnier inland, and you save time and energy (not to men-
tion a few bucks on accommodations) by sticking to U.S. 101 for north-
ern destinations. Garberville makes a great southern base (especially
the comfy Benbow Inn; see review later in this chapter) if you follow
this strategy. You can also zip your way to the top, stay in Eureka or
Ferndale, and meander down the Avenue the next day. Driving the route
northbound presents no particular advantage.
Getting There
From Mendocino, follow Highway 1 north along the shoreline to Leggett,
where you’ll pick up U.S. 101 (the Redwood Highway) northbound. The
distance to Leggett is about 53 miles, with the first 30 or so winding
along the coast; the scenery becomes truly spectacular after you pass
through Fort Bragg. It’s slow going, so be prepared. Pick up U.S. 101, and
15 miles later you’ll reach Richardson Grove State Park. The Garberville
exit is another 81⁄2 miles. Six miles beyond Garberville you can pick up the
southern end of the Avenue of the Giants, formally known as Highway 254.
If you’re bypassing Mendocino and coming from the south, take speedy
U.S. 101 all the way north to the Avenue of the Giants exit at Phillipsville
(6 miles north of Garberville). This exit is 211 miles from San Francisco
straight up the 101, 158 miles from Calistoga (at the north end of Napa
Valley) via Highway 128 to U.S. 101.
Driving the Avenue of the Giants
You can see the following highlights as you proceed north on the
Redwood Highway, U.S. 101, picking up the Avenue of the Giants,
Highway 254, at its southernmost gateway. Much more of both the sub-
lime and the obscure lie on the route: unspoiled woodland stretches
with pullouts that lead to wonderful hiking trails and day-use areas in
the woods, plus all those silly attractions. Watch for any number of one-
horse towns along the road, where you can stop to buy a casual lunch or
a carved hunk of redwood.
 At the junction of Highway 1 and U.S. 101 sits the Chandelier Tree
Drive-Thru Tree Park in Leggett (% 707-925-6363), the first of
many such attractions on the Redwood Highway. Other corn-pone
variations along the route include the “world-famous” treehouse
and the one-log house, which has been mounted on wheels and
hauled to Garberville. If you’re doing the cheeky Roadside
Americana version of this tour, don’t worry about missing any.
Chapter 14: Redwood Country 179

Each attraction sports a massive sign that’s more attention-getting
than a 10-foot-tall carnival barker.
Lest you think this drive-through tree business is anything natural,
Chandelier will dispel that notion right quick. Sometime back in the
1930s, somebody cut a car-size hole in the base of a mammoth red-
wood, and now you pay five bucks for the right to drive your car
through. This cheesy activity is not really worth the $5, but if
you’re curious, this is as good a place as any to get it out of your
system. And we defy you to bypass it with a small child in your car. 
 Any itinerary should include a visit to Richardson Grove State
Park, 15 miles north of Leggett (7 miles south of Garberville) on
U.S. 101 (% 707-247-3318 or 707-247-3415; www.parks.ca.gov).
Here’s where things really start to get good. The park includes a
terrific visitor center with a grocery store and a handy shop, where
you can pick up maps and pamphlets covering the entire region. A
short (ten-minute) interpretive loop offers an excellent introduc-
tion to the towering trees, complete with explanatory placards.
More extensive trails include an easy 1.6-mile woodland loop; stop
in at the staffed center for a map. The day-use fee is $6.
 Even if you’re not staying at the Benbow Inn, the adjacent Benbow
Lake State Recreation Area (% 707-247-3318 or 707-923-3238;
www.parks.ca.gov) makes an excellent stop for picnicking, sun-
ning, and lake swimming in summer, and includes grassy areas and
a rocky beach. The dining room over at the Benbow Inn (see the
“Where to Stay along the Route” section in this chapter) makes a
good stop for lunch (served in summer only).
 About 141⁄2 miles from Phillipsville, the first access point for the
Avenue of the Giants is Humboldt Redwoods State Park (% 707-
946-2263; www.humboldtredwoods.org). Much larger than
Richardson Grove, this 53,000-acre park is the real heart of the
Avenue. Humboldt Redwoods features the Redwood Highway’s
main visitor center, plus 100 miles of hiking trails. You can pick up a
trail map in the visitor center. If you plan to spend some serious
time here, check out the extensive Web site. The day-use parking
fee is $6.
 About 2 miles north of the visitor center, still in Humboldt Redwoods
State Park, is Founders Grove, one of the most impressive redwood
groves in the region. Its name honors the enlightened folks who
founded the Save-the-Redwoods League way back in 1917. A gentle,
half-mile interpretive loop meanders through the grove. This walk is
an enjoyable introduction to coast redwood ecology, and also takes
you past the Dyerville Giant –– a 370-foot monster of a tree that was
designated the “Champion Coast Redwood” before it fell over a
decade ago. Here it remains, lying on the forest floor, its root ball
alone measuring three stories long.

Where to Stay along the Route
If you want to spend quality time among the redwoods, you have a few
choices that offer good places to stay. Garberville remains a charm-free
bend in the road off Highway 101 near the southern gateway of the
Avenue of the Giants. The town is perfectly serviceable if you’d like to
skip the coastline altogether and head straight for the trees. You can
also stop here for a bite of lunch (see the “Where to Dine along the
Route” section later in this chapter).
The tiny but stately burg of Ferndale presents a picture-perfect ginger-
bread slice of authentic Victoriana just past the north end of the drive. A
visit to the town is well worth the 5-mile detour off U.S. 101.
Eureka is about 45 miles north of the Avenue’s northern gateway. The
largest town on the North Coast doesn’t look like much at first glance,
but if you turn west off U.S. 101 between B and M streets, you’ll discover
a charming Victorian Old Town along the waterfront.
For more choices, contact the visitors bureau (see the “Gathering More
Information” section at the end of this chapter), whose Web site offers
an excellent rundown of options throughout the area.
Hotel taxes in this neck of the woods vary; count on 7.9 to 10 percent
being tacked on to your bill at checkout time.

lovely lakefront grounds, a terrace restaurant, and attentive service. All in
all, it’s a great value –– and an ideal place to base yourself as you frolic
among the redwoods. The dining room specializes in fresh regional cui-
sine and offers a children’s menu.

Where to Dine along the Route
This area is not quite a gourmet ghetto, but you can dine supremely 
well if you like. The Carter House dining room, Restaurant 301 (entrees
$20–$35), regularly receives Wine Spectator awards, as does the restau-
rant at the Benbow Inn (see information for both in the preceding sec-
tion). Here are a couple more recommended dining choices.

player, but the delicious food takes a back seat to neither. If it’s on the sea-
sonal menu, you can’t go wrong with the grilled local lamb chops or a filet

comfy and inviting; the tables are set far enough apart to allow for intimate

f you’re looking for the Golden State’s biggest and best playground,

Lake Tahoe isn’t just any old hole in the ground; it’s one of the more

most beautiful that we’ve ever seen. Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in
North America — 22 miles long and 12 miles wide, with a surface area of
nearly 192 square miles, which means it can hold about a half-dozen
Manhattans (the borough, darling, not the cocktail).
To refer to it as “sparkling” barely does this crystalline lake justice.
Science even has an explanation for it: The water is 99.9 percent pure,
about the same purity as distilled water. It’s so clear that a white dinner
plate resting 75 feet below the surface would be visible to the naked eye.
What’s more, Lake Tahoe is the eighth-deepest lake in the world; it holds
so much water that, if you tipped it on its side, the contents would flood
the entire state of California to a depth of 14 inches.
Evergreens and snowy peaks rising from the shoreline make the lake
look that much deeper, broader, and majestic. But don’t just take our
word for it; listen to Mark Twain, who described Lake Tahoe as “the
beautiful relic of fairy-land forgotten.” Although Tahoe certainly isn’t for-
gotten anymore, Twain’s flight of fancy continues to hold true.

Timing Your Visit
When’s the best time to visit? Simple: Come in winter if cross-country or
alpine skiing is your game. This is also the time, at least during the week,
when you’ll have Tahoe to yourself. Otherwise, come in summer. Or try
autumn, the secret season in Tahoe. The colors are beautiful, the air is
crisp, activities abound, and hotel rates are low, low, low. Skip yucky
spring altogether. The snowmelt turns the terrain into mud.
Even in summer, prepare yourself for cool weather. In July, average highs
don’t hit the 80s, and evenings can dip well below 50°F. And because the
upper 12 feet of the lake warms only to about 68°F, don’t expect to splash
around in your floaties. Chances are, it’ll be all you can do to dip your
toes in.
Tahoe is a favorite weekend getaway among San Franciscans, so you’ll
always save money — and, even more important, avoid the crowds — by
scheduling your stay for Monday through Thursday.
Three nights in Tahoe will give you plenty of time to fully explore the
area and play. If you cut your stay back to two, you risk spending too
much time in the car (getting there and leaving), and not enough time in
Tahoe. Budget four nights if you want to experience both shores. For
more on this topic, check out the following section.
Choosing between Two Shores
The 30-mile drive between Lake Tahoe’s north and south shores can
become a two-hour bumper-to-bumper (or snowstormy) nightmare in
the high seasons, so choose your shore carefully. Both boast first-rate
skiing, good restaurants, lake views, and plenty of on-the-water fun —
but that’s pretty much where the similarities end.
South Lake Tahoe is more developed and generally cheaper; more hotels
mean more competition, so you’ll get better accommodations for your
money. The big Nevada casinos are at hand (in town for all intents and
purposes), so this is the shore for nightlife. Getting out on the water is
easier from the south shore, too, because it boasts more marinas, more
outfitters, plus some excellent shoreline state parks not far from town.
If Mark Twain could wax poetic about today’s Tahoe, he’d write about
the north shore. North Lake Tahoe is much, much prettier than its
southern shore. It’s more remote and countrylike, with a variety of ski
resorts and first-class accommodations — but you can still find slot
machines close by if you feel the urge. Squaw Valley, 6 miles from the
lakeshore, is one of the best outdoor recreation centers ever, poised to
become a one-stop destination, with its alpine-style village. Tahoe City
is not as commercially spoiled as South Lake Tahoe, but it’s way too
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 185

crowded for its own good in the high seasons. And if affordability is a
concern, you won’t get as much value for your dollar here.
Although we prefer the north shore, skiers find either one convenient.
Our best advice: Avoid the weekends and never drive to Tahoe on a
Friday afternoon unless you want to sit in traffic on a two-lane highway
with no escape. On weekdays, you’ll also have an opportunity to enjoy
the wonderful drive along Highway 89 at an easy pace so that you can
investigate both shores for yourself.
Getting There
Lake Tahoe straddles the California/Nevada border, a four-hour drive
east (slightly northeast, actually) from San Francisco. Here’s how to get
there:
 If you’re coming from San Francisco: Take I-80 east to Sacramento,
then U.S. 50 to South Lake Tahoe on the south shore, or stay on I-80
east to Highway 89 south to reach Tahoe City on the north shore.
 If you’re coming from Yosemite: Take Highway 120 east out of the
park to I-395 north to U.S. 50 east; at the U.S. 50/Highway 28 split,
follow U.S. 50 to South Lake Tahoe, or Highway 28 to Tahoe City on
the north shore.
The three-and-a-half-hour drive from Yosemite is doable only
between late June and the first snowfall (usually early November),
because the park’s east gate closes in winter. Otherwise, the drive
becomes a five- or six-hour trek north on winding Highway 49 to 
I-50, which can be slow going in bad weather.
 If you’re coming from points south: Take I-5 through central
California to Sacramento, and then pick up I-80 east to the north
shore or U.S. 50 east to the south shore.
Whether you take I-80 to the north shore or U.S. 50 to the south
shore, you can easily work in a side trip to the Gold Country on
your way to Tahoe. All you need is a few hours to spare and the
desire to see some small towns; for details, see the “Side-Tripping
to the Gold Country” section later in this chapter. The same goes
for Sacramento, our state capital, where you can spend a day steep-
ing yourself in history or walking in the footsteps of Governor
Ahhnold; see the “Prospecting for History in Sacramento” section
later in this chapter.
 If you’re heading to Squaw Valley: Follow Highway 89 (River
Road) at the 89/28 split in Tahoe City. Go 5 miles and turn left at
Squaw Valley Road.
Reno/Tahoe International Airport is at U.S. 395 just south of I-80 in
Reno, Nevada (% 775-328-6400; www.renoairport.com). All the
national car-rental companies have airport locations. The drive takes

Getting Your Bearings
On the south shore, two main highways meet at a prominent Y intersec-
tion in South Lake Tahoe: U.S. 50, which continues up the east (Nevada)
shore of the lake to midpoint and then shoots off east; and Highway 89,
which runs up the west (California) side of the lake to Tahoe City, and
then turns northwest away from the lake. Highway 28 picks up where 89
leaves off, running along the north shore from Tahoe City to midpoint on
the Nevada side, where it meets up with U.S. 50, completing the continu-
ous 72-mile circle around the lake. (To get your visual bearings, look for
the “Lake Tahoe” map on p. 187.)
Lake Tahoe’s biggest town is South Lake Tahoe, which runs along the
south shore. Its main drag is U.S. 50, which is called Lake Tahoe Boulevard
in town. After you cross the California/Nevada line, you’re immediately in
Stateline, Nevada. It’s easy to tell: The casinos practically trip you after
your toes pass over the border.
Follow Highway 89 about 31 miles north along the west shore, past 
camplike resorts and stunning lakefront homes, and you reach Tahoe
City, the commercial hub of the north shore. Go 6 miles northwest on
Highway 89 to breathtaking Squaw Valley, whose thriving Olympic
Village was built for the 1960 Winter Games.

188

Along with a few other casino/hotels, another prominent community sits
on the northeast shore, Nevada’s Incline Village. But we’ve concentrated
on the California side because we’re partisans — this is a book about
California, after all.
Where to Stay
For additional choices throughout the region, contact Lake Tahoe Central
Reservations (% 888-434-1262 or 530-583-3494; www.mytahoevacation.
com). The service charges $15 to $20 to make your reservations, and you
won’t get the best room prices, but the staff is knowledgeable. You can
also try TahoeReservations.com (www.tahoereservations.com), a free,
real-time service that specializes in South Tahoe. For ski packages, con-
tact Ski Tahoe (% 888-982-1088; www.skitahoe.com).
Expect to see 10 to 12 percent in taxes added to your hotel bill.
On the south shore
The big-name casinos at Stateline, Nevada, resemble unattractive office
complexes, and display none of the outrageousness of Las Vegas, but
they offer gaming, entertainment, and amenities such as indoor pools
and spa facilities. They’re fairly similar in middle-of-the-road comforts
and prices, which can range from $69 to $289 and up depending on the
day and season. These places thrive on packages, so always ask.
 Harrah’s (% 800-427-7247 or 775-588-6611; www.harrahs.com/
our_casinos/tah) is attractive and low-key, comparatively speak-
ing, and appeals to a slightly less raucous vacationer.
 Harveys (% 800-427-8397 or 775-588-2411; www.harrahs.com) is
the rock-’n’-roll casino and draws a young, sophisticated crowd.
 MontBleu (% 800-648-3353 or 775-588-3515; www.montbleu
resort.com) recently replaced the mighty tired Caesars and has
brought contemporary glamour to the area.
In addition to the more unique choices detailed in the following listings,
South Lake Tahoe also has some excellent-value motels:
 Holiday Inn Express, 3961 Lake Tahoe Blvd. (% 800-544-5288
or 530-544-5900; www.holidayinnexpresstahoe.com), has high-
quality rooms and is tucked among the trees to ensure quiet. Rooms,
including continental breakfast, run $69 to $209, family-size suites
$149 to $269.
 Motel 6, 2375 Lake Tahoe Blvd. (% 800-466-8356 or 530-542-1400;
www.motel6.com), is the best motel value in town for penny-
pinching travelers. Rooms run $30 to $105.

Wow! This stunning lodgelike B&B looks like it rambled straight out of a
Ralph Lauren advertisement, complete with gleaming knotty-pine wood-
work, bearskins, and a two-story river-stone fireplace in the soaring living

fully outfitted rooms (gorgeous bathrooms!), lots of lounging space, and
charming hosts add up to the most gracious place to stay on the south
shore, period. Geared toward adults and kids older than 16.

Recently renovated, these nine tidy little country-pine suites are cozy (read:

Owned and operated by a local family (who also owns the Inn at Heavenly),
the location is unbeatable — close to some great restaurants and the mar-
velous facilities of Camp Richardson, but far enough from the main drag to
keep your mind on the mountains. Dogs and kids are most welcome. The
staff even lends you bicycles, kayaks, float tubes, and videos.

Shooting craps actually gives us hives — unless we’re winning — but
one more casino straddling the north-shore border merits mention.

the Cal Neva Resort, 2 Stateline Rd., Crystal Bay, Nevada (% 800-CAL-
NEVA or 775-832-4000; www.calnevaresort.com; $129–$249 double), is

much flashier and have more gaming tables, the Cal Neva offers some
history and a little soul, and the spacious guest rooms have glorious
lake views.

delicately breaded calamari with a zippy dipping sauce, fish and chips, and

Squaw Valley
CALIFORNIA
The PlumpJack boys got a jump on the competition at the new Village at
Squaw Valley, opening the brasserie-style Balboa Cafe before the paint was
even dry in the first of the new condos. They serve the identical nearly
famous hamburgers here as in the San Francisco haunt of the same name,
along with a good steak frites and delicious roast chicken nicely accom-
panied with potato-mushroom gratin and our personal love, Brussels
sprouts. The décor is western eclectic, the bar is fun, and it’s the hippest
spot in Squaw, a magnet for ski bums of all persuasions. Takeout is avail-
able from a little counter next door.

and Saturday nights, and party down with their pals. The menu, though
not particularly creative, covers familiar surf/turf/pasta territory and
includes such toothsome appetizers as beer-battered coconut prawns.
Quite the scene.

Squaw Valley
CONTEMPORARY MEDITERRANEAN
The best restaurant in Squaw Valley is this first-rate resort version of the
San Francisco favorite. The Mediterranean-accented modern cuisine
revolves around seasonal ingredients, always a good sign (and if the duck-
ling trio is on the menu, order it). The room is 100 percent high-design chic
but utterly comfortable nonetheless. Service is impeccable in a not-too-
formal way, and the wine list boasts well-chosen labels at reasonable
markups. And for a fondue break between ski runs, this is the place.

AMERICAN
Two floors of tables usually ensure a short wait, if at all, at this shingled,
lodge-style family-owned restaurant. It’s noisy and casual, perfect for fam-
ilies, and servings are plentiful. A big menu offers breakfasts designed to
rev up skiers, as well as hamburgers, grilled chicken sandwiches, and chef-
type salads for lunch, and two-course dinners starring meat (the pot roast
is hard to resist) and fish. You won’t mistake it for gourmet, but you’ll prob-
ably appreciate the value and ethos.

LATIN/SPANISH
One of San Francisco’s favorite chefs, Johnny Alamilla, packed up his knives
and snowboard and relocated to Tahoe in 2005. With a partner, he opened
this sleek-yet-casual dinner house, where customers delight in both the
excellent views and his wonderful Latino-tinged cooking. Our suggestion is
to start with a mojito while deciding on either the ceviche or butternut
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 195

squash and queso fresco empanaditas. Follow the small plates with Alamilla’s
Basque-inspired cassoulet if it’s on the menu. Tahoe really lucked out here.

Enjoying Lake Tahoe
You have to get out on the water to truly appreciate the grandeur of
Lake Tahoe.
The 570-passenger M.S. Dixie II (% 775-589-4906 or 800-238-2463; www.
tahoedixie2.com), an authentic paddle-wheeler, offers lake cruises
year-round from Zephyr Cove Marina, on U.S. 50, 4 miles east of the
Nevada state line. We like the two-hour Emerald Bay Sightseeing Cruise
best; it gives you a general feel for the lake and takes you into the stun-
ning bay where you can see Fanette Island and Vikingsholm up close
without having to take the difficult walk (see the “Driving along the 
spectacular west shore” section later in this chapter). Fares are $33 
for adults, $9 for kids under 12; reservations are recommended.
If you’d like a more intimate ride, book with Woodwind Sailing Cruises
(% 888-867-6394; www.sailwoodwind.com). Trips, which originate from
Camp Richardson Resort or Zephyr Cove, start at $28 for adults, $24 for
seniors, $12 for kids 12 and under. The sunset champagne cruise is
smooch-worthy.
On the north shore, catch a ride aboard the Tahoe Gal (% 800-218-
2464 or 530-583-0141; www.tahoegal.com), which offers tours from 
the Lighthouse Mall Marina, 850 N. Lake Blvd., in Tahoe City, from May
through September. Prices start at $26 adults, $14 kids. The Happy Hour
Cruise is $15 adults and $11 kids.
Boating for do-it-yourselfers
Expect to pay in the neighborhood of $109 to $139 per hour for a power-
boat and between $100 and $140 for a jet ski; the fourth hour is often
free. Always reserve ahead.
Rental options on the south shore include:
 Zephyr Cove Resort Marina, on U.S. 50, 4 miles east of the Nevada
state line (% 775-589-4908 or 775-588-3833; www.tahoedixie2.
com), rents late-model 16- to 28-foot boats, plus runabouts, ski
boats, pontoons, pedal-boats, kayaks, and canoes.
 Tahoe Keys Boat Rentals (% 530-544-8888) rents powerboats from
Tahoe Keys Marina, conveniently located in South Lake Tahoe off
Lake Tahoe Boulevard (U.S. 50) at the end of Tahoe Keys Road.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
196

 A great place to launch a kayak is Timber Cove Marina, on Lake
Tahoe Boulevard at the end of Johnson Boulevard, which has the
largest public beach on the south shore. Rentals are available from
Kayak Tahoe (% 530-544-2011; www.kayaktahoe.com). Call ahead
to arrange for a guided tour.
 Camp Richardson Marina at Camp Richardson Resort, 2 miles west
of the U.S. 50/Highway 89 junction (% 530-541-1801 or 800-544-
1801; www.camprichardson.com), rents a full slate of boating
equipment similar to that at Zephyr Cove.
For rentals on the north shore, check out the following:
 North Tahoe Marina, 7360 N. Lake Blvd. (Highway 28, 1 mile west of
Highway 267), in Tahoe Vista (% 530-546-8248; www.northtahoe
marina.com), rents 19- to 24-foot powerboats, plus skis and tow
lines.
 Tahoe Water Adventures at the Lakehouse Mall, just off North Lake
Boulevard at the end of Grove Street, in Tahoe City (% 530-583-
3225), rents powerboats with wakeboards or skis, canoes, kayaks,
jet skis, or environmentally friendly inflatable watercraft.
Sportfishing
The most respected charter company around is Tahoe Sport Fishing
(www.tahoesportfishing.com), which operates from two south-shore
locations: Ski Run Marina, off U.S. 50 at the end of Ski Run Boulevard, 
a mile west of the state line (% 800-696-7797 or 530-541-5448); and
Zephyr Cove, on U.S. 50, 4 miles east of the state line (% 800-696-7797
or 775-586-9338). Four- to seven-hour trips run $85 to $135 per person,
including all gear, tackle, and bait. If you’re lucky enough to hook a
salmon or a big Mackinaw lake trout, the fee includes cleaning and 
sacking.
Driving along the spectacular west shore
The entire drive along Highway 89 offers spectacular scenery. It’s worth
dedicating the better part of a day to explore (be sure to make your
exploration day a bright, clear weekday to avoid traffic). Here are your
best stops, from south to north:
 The best public-access beaches are part of the Pope-Baldwin
Recreational Area, which begins just west of the Y intersection
with U.S. 50. Expect to pay $3 to $5 to park at most public beaches,
such as pretty Pope Beach and the beach at Camp Richardson.
Camp Richardson’s Beacon Bar & Grill is the ideal place to enjoy a
sunset Rum Runner (practically the official Tahoe cocktail) because
the patio is right on the sand, just a stone’s throw — literally —
from the water.
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 197

 Next up is the Tallac Historic Estates, three landmarked 1920s
homes open for tours in summer. More interesting is Visitors
Center Beach (turn right at the USFS Lake Tahoe Visitors Center
sign). Follow the Rainbow Trail, an easy ten-minute walk along a
paved walkway dotted with interpretive placards, to the Stream
Profile Chamber, which offers an eco-lesson in water clarity and
the freshwater food chain through a submerged window onto
Taylor Creek. The view is like looking into an aquarium, only it’s
the real thing — very cool. Walk ten minutes in the opposite direc-
tion from the visitor center, following the “Beach Access” sign, to a
very nice stretch of beach.
You can hike a section of the 165-mile Tahoe Rim Trail, which cel-
ebrated its 25th birthday in 2006, in a day. Download the route online
at www.tahoerimtrail.org. Stop in the visitor center to pick up a
copy of the invaluable Lake of the Sky Journal, which details other
great hikes throughout the area.
 From the Visitors Center Beach, the highway begins to climb
northward. Soon you see the aptly named Emerald Bay, a 3-mile-
long finger of sparkling green water jutting off the lake. This bay
also has the lake’s only island — tiny Fanette Island — where you
find the ruins of an old stone teahouse.
Pull into the lot marked “Emerald Bay State Park/Vikingsholm” for
the favorite lake photo-op, bar none. The walk to the lakeshore is
11⁄2 miles long, but at the end you find Vikingsholm, a Danish-style
castle built by the same (kinda wacky) lady behind the teahouse 
on Fanette Island. Back in 1928, the lake so reminded her of a
Scandinavian fjord that she decided to drive the theme home. The
castle is a sight to see — but remember, you have to walk back up
that steep 11⁄2-mile hill. The mansion is open for tours in summer
only (% 530-525-7277).
 A couple of miles farther up the road sits D. L. Bliss State Park 
(% 530-525-7277), a gorgeous spot with one of the lake’s finest
beaches (come early in summer to ensure a parking space). If
you’re a hiker, moderate-level Rubicon Trail is a worthy 5-mile hike
along Emerald Bay.
 Another 7 miles on is Sugar Pine Point State Park (% 530-525-
7982). This terrific park offers 13⁄4 miles of shoreline with sandy
beaches, more than 2,000 forested acres laced with hiking trails,
the historic Ehrman Mansion (open for guided tours in summer),
and a nature center. Parking starts at $5.
 After you reach Tahoe City, take note of Fanny Bridge, so named
for the view of derrieres as folks bend over the rail to catch sight of
the leaping trout below. It’s on Highway 89 just south of the Y inter-
section with Highway 28, next to Izzy’s Burger Spa, a great spot for
juicy burgers and thick shakes.

Golfing 
Hitting the links is a very big deal in North Tahoe. A half-dozen excellent
courses lie within easy reach of Tahoe City, including the award-winning
Robert Trent Jones, Jr.–designed links-style course at the Resort at
Squaw Creek (see the “Where to Stay” section earlier in this chapter),
honored by Golf magazine as one of the top ten resort courses in
America. For tee times here or at another course, contact North Lake
Tahoe Central Reservations (% 888-434-1262 or 530-583-3494; www.
tahoefun.org). These friendly folks can also direct south-shore vaca-
tioners to great courses, too.
Taking a heavenly ride
Heavenly operates a gondola a half-block west of Stateline, right on U.S.
50, between two new Marriott timeshare developments. The ride ($24
for adults, $22 for kids 13 to 18, $15 for kids 5 to 12) takes you 21⁄3 miles
up the mountain to an observation deck at 9,123 feet. The views are
breathtaking, but there’s not much to do up there except eat at the cafe
or continue to the top and eat at the Adventure Peak Grill. You’ll also
find a few hiking trails and a climbing wall, which confuses us but might
make the kids happy. You may get more for your money taking the cable
car at Squaw Valley High Camp.
River rafting
Truckee River Rafting (% 888-584-7238 or 530-583-7238; www.truckee
riverrafting.com) offers one cool north-shore activity: a leisurely
float along a 5-mile stretch down the Truckee River from Tahoe City to
River Ranch Pond. You even hit a couple of baby rapids for a few thrills;
kids just love it. The ride is $32 for adults, $27 for kids 6 to 12, including
all equipment and pickup at the end. Reserve ahead (and save $7 per
person); allow two to four hours for the adventure.
Playing at Squaw Valley High Camp
Squaw Valley High Camp (% 530-583-6955; www.squaw.com) is a 
wonderful place to play in summer, and a great way to experience the
Olympic Village. After a scenic cable-car ride to 8,200 feet, you can ice-
skate at the mountaintop Olympic Ice Pavilion, or swim and spa in the
Swimming Lagoon. If you’re a hiker, pick up a trail map at the base infor-
mation desk and follow any one of a half-dozen mountain trails, ranging
from easy to difficult. Mountain bikers can rent a front-suspension bike
at the Squaw Valley Sport Shop, in the Olympic Village (% 530-583-
3356), take it to the top, and explore the snowless slopes. Expect half-
day rentals around $30, and full-day rentals in the neighborhood of $40,
helmets included; call to book a bike and avoid disappointment. Round-
trip cable-car tickets are $20 adults, $16 teens 13 to 15, $5 kids 3 to 12;
swim/skate/ride packages are available.
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 199

Hitting the slopes in ski season
Tahoe is more popular as a ski resort than anything else. It’s home to the
state’s best skiing and the country’s largest concentration of downhill
slopes. The ski season usually lasts from November through April but
has been known to extend into the early summer. Most resorts welcome
snowboarders, but always check first.
Lift tickets for adults cost between $23 and $63 for a full day, depending
on the resort, with convenient Heavenly and Squaw Valley on the high
end. Resorts often issue money-saving multiday tickets, and kids and
seniors always qualify for discounts. Your lodge will probably have dis-
counted tickets on hand as well.
Contact the local visitor centers (see the “Gathering More Information”
section later in this chapter) or go to www.tahoesbest.com/Skiing for
more about the area ski resorts. Also inquire about ski packages, which
can usually save you a small fortune, especially if you ski midweek.
The top south-shore slopes
Heavenly (% 775-586-7000; www.skiheavenly.com) is off U.S. 50 at the
top of Ski Run Boulevard (turn left). It features the region’s steepest ver-
tical drop (3,500 ft.) and one of its largest ski terrains (4,800 acres), not
to mention one of the world’s largest snowmaking systems. A third of
the trails are set aside for envelope-pushers, but the rest are dedicated
to beginners and intermediates. Excellent for families, with everything
from kiddie ski schools to daycare.
Kirkwood (% 209-258-7254; www.kirkwood.com) is a 30- to 45-minute
drive outside of South Lake Tahoe on Highway 88 (from U.S. 50, take
Highway 89 south to 88 west). This resort ranks among Ski magazine’s
top ten in North America for snow, terrain, and challenge. It’s a terrific
choice for spring skiers thanks to high average snowfall. It’s now a desti-
nation resort, so inquire if you want to stay.
The top north-shore slopes
Midsize Alpine Meadows (% 800-441-4423 or 530-583-4232; www.ski
alpine.com), 8 miles west of Tahoe City, has the best spring skiing
around. Many years, Alpine Meadows is still going strong into May, 
when everybody else (even Kirkwood) has closed for the season. 
A local favorite, it maintains a committed following.
Diamond Peak (% 775-832-1177; www.diamondpeak.com) is 17 miles
east of Tahoe City in Incline Village, Nevada. Diamond Peak has taken
great care to target families, and it’s the north shore’s best resort for
kids. It’s also smaller and less expensive than most resorts. Kids as
young as 3 can learn to ski, and the resort maintains a terrific snow-play
area.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
200

If you want spectacular lake views while you ski, take to the slopes at
Homewood (% 530-525-2992; www.skihomewood.com), right on the
lake’s west shore, 61⁄2 miles south of Tahoe City. It’s small, intimate, and 
a local favorite. Weekday lift tickets are a great value.
Northstar-at-Tahoe (% 800-466-6784 or 530-562-1010; www.northstar
tahoe.com), 11 miles east of Tahoe City, is under construction midmoun-
tain with a Ritz-Carlton resort scheduled to open in 2009. Northstar, which
has always been a terrific choice for families, devotes about 75 percent of
the ski terrain to beginner and intermediate runs. Skiing will continue
during the building, of course, and new lifts should help move the crowds
more quickly and efficiently.
Ever dream of Olympic glory? Squaw Valley USA (% 530-583-6985; www.
squaw.com), 9 miles from Tahoe City, was the site of the 1960 Olympic
Winter Games. Spanning six Sierra peaks, gorgeous, excellently outfitted
Squaw Valley is Tahoe’s most state-of-the-art ski area with the most chal-
lenging array of runs. A must for serious skiers.
Cross-country skiing and snowmobiling
The north shore offers the most — and best — cross-country options.
Tahoe Cross-Country Ski Area (% 530-583-5475; www.tahoexc.org)
has 65 kilometers of groomed trails, a full-service day lodge, state-of-the-
art equipment, and a convenient location, 2 miles east of Tahoe City off
Highway 28 at Dollar Hill (turn at Fabian Way).
Northstar-at-Tahoe (% 530-562-2475; www.northstartahoe.com) has 
a new cross-country, telemark, and snowshoe center with 50 kilometers
of groomed trails. The Resort at Squaw Creek (% 530-583-6300; www.
squawcreek.com) is much smaller, with just 18 kilometers of trails, but
the Squaw Valley setting is unparalleled — and the resort was the site of
the 2004 U.S. Snowshoeing National Championships.
On the south shore, head to the 35 kilometers of trails at the Cross-
Country Ski Center at Camp Richardson Resort, on Highway 89 which 
is 21⁄2 miles north of the U.S. 50/89 Y intersection (% 530-542-6584; www.
camprich.com).
The south shore’s Zephyr Cove Snowmobile Center, on U.S. 50, 4 miles
east of the state line (% 775-588-3833; www.tahoedixie2.com), is the
largest snowmobiling center in the United States. You can rent and set
out on your own (kids as young as 5 can accompany you on a double
machine), or take a guided tour (recommended if you’re a newbie).
Reservations recommended.
On the north shore, contact Snowmobiling Unlimited (% 530-583-
7192). Tahoe’s oldest snowmobile touring company, this company leads
two- and three-hour guided tours.
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 201

Trying your luck at the casinos
One of the great advantages of a Tahoe vacation is the proximity to the
casinos — just a skip across the border in either Stateline or Crystal 
Bay, Nevada. You can throw a snowball and hit any of them from the
California side. These are the best of the bunch:
 Cal Neva Resort (% 800-225-6382 or 775-832-4000; www.calneva
resort.com), once co-owned by Frank Sinatra, has its diehard fans,
including soft-hearted us, who prefer the north-shore location and
low-key atmosphere. The showroom, built to the specifications of
Ol’ Blue Eyes himself, isn’t used much anymore and the medium-
size gaming room has only blackjack, roulette, craps, and slot
machines. However, photos of Marilyn Monroe, Sinatra, and his
cronies line the walls, providing a cool piece of history and a hint of
past glamour that may be irresistible.
 The jam-packed showroom at Harrah’s (% 800-427-7247 or 775-
588-6611; www.harrahstahoe.com) offers a wide array of entertain-
ment, from comics to big-name headliners, including many baby-
boomer faves (the Yardbirds, Pat Benatar, and so forth). The
hotel/casino has opened a new nightclub as well.
 Harveys (% 800-427-8397 or 775-588-2411; www.harrahs.com)
rocks, with video monitors and speakers blasting radio-friendly
sounds throughout the largest casino in Tahoe. With its terrific
racing and sports book, Harveys draws a young, sophisticated
crowd. The showroom focuses on cabaret-style shows and sexy
revues, while the Hard Rock Cafe hosts live music on Friday and
Saturday nights.
 MontBleu Resort and Spa (% 800-648-3353 or 775-586-7771; www.
montbleuresort.com), targets the 21-to-40 demographic with a
nightclub, slick lounge, theater, seven restaurants, and a poker
room to complement a full range of gaming tables. It’s as close to
Vegas as you can get in Tahoe.
If you hope to catch a big-name headliner, check the schedule before
you leave home and make reservations to avoid disappointment.
The casinos make sure families feel welcome. Harrah’s and Harveys,
offer sizable video arcades where classics such as Pac-Man and Donkey
Kong buzz and beep alongside the latest virtual-reality games. In addi-
tion, the casino showrooms often offer all-ages entertainment, such as
magic shows, at earlier family hours.
Side-Tripping to the Gold Country
California’s gold-rush country is rich in color and history. Dotted with
19th-century-mining-towns-turned-cutesy-B&B havens, the region is a big
weekend destination for Northern Californians. The area has plenty to
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
202

see and do, but nothing so major that you should devote the half-week
you’d need to drive the region’s main thoroughfare, Highway 49, from
end to end. Leave that for a future visit, after you’ve covered so many of
California’s highlights that you have the time to dedicate to it.
However, a portion of the Gold Country is so easy to reach on the drive
to or from Lake Tahoe that we highly recommend you dedicate half a
day to seeing its main (and most fascinating) attraction, the Marshall
Gold Discovery State Historic Park, where the gold rush began. You can
also stop in a gold-rush town or two. Keep in mind, though, that the Gold
Country can be brutally hot in summer, so dress accordingly.
Getting there
We suggest you focus on the Gold Chain Highway; this section of
Highway 49 runs roughly north-south between I-80 (the road to North
Tahoe) and U.S. 50 (the road to South Tahoe). I-80 connects with
Highway 49 at Auburn, 35 miles east of Sacramento and 78 miles (a gor-
geous one-and-a-half-hour drive) west of Tahoe City. U.S. 50 connects
with this section of Highway 49 on the south end, in Placerville (origi-
nally dubbed Hangtown for its single-minded justice system), 43 miles
east of Sacramento and 55 miles west of South Lake Tahoe.
The roughly 23-mile drive between Auburn and Placerville along the
Gold Chain Highway takes about an hour thanks to one narrow lane in
each direction and more than a few hairpin turns. Coloma, the hairs-
breadth of a town where you’ll find the Marshall Gold Discovery State
Historic Park, is roughly midway between the two.
 If you’re heading to South Tahoe: Pick up I-80 (which you may
already be on if you’re coming from the Bay Area) in Sacramento,
turn south on Highway 49 to do your exploring, and then head east
to South Tahoe after you meet up with U.S. 50. If you’re leaving
from South Tahoe, reverse the process by taking U.S. 50 west,
Highway 49 north for exploring, then I-80 west when you’re done.
 If you’re heading to North Tahoe: Take U.S. 50 east from
Sacramento, then take Highway 49 north, then I-80 east to Tahoe
City. From North Tahoe? You got it — I-80 west, Highway 49 south,
U.S. 50 west to your destination.
Marshall’s gold and Sutter’s mill
The Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park is nestled in the
golden Sierra foothills on Highway 49 between Auburn and Placerville at
Coloma (% 530-622-3470; www.parks.ca.gov). Actually, about 70 per-
cent of Coloma is the park. This is where James Marshall, a carpenter,
discovered two itsy-bitsy gold nuggets on January 24, 1848, at John
Sutter’s mill on the dusty banks of the American River. This discovery
managed to launch gold-rush mania and redirect California history in 
the process.
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 203

A working re-creation of Sutter’s mill, a few intact gold-rush-era build-
ings, and enlightening exhibits capture the pioneering spirit and excite-
ment of that day and the ’49ers get-rich-quick craze that followed. This
place is very cool, and kids will enjoy it more than you may expect. To
take maximum advantage of this historic site, start at the Gold Discovery
Museum Visitors Center, just off Highway 49 at Bridge Street. Come early
and ask the rangers about guided discovery tours and sawmill demonstra-
tions (usually Thursday through Sunday at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. in summer).
You may even get a chance to pan for gold yourself! The buildings are
open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. (4:30 p.m. in winter), and the fee is $4 to
$6 per car. Bring a picnic lunch or snack.
By the way: James Marshall, poor soul, never saw a dime of the gold in
them thar hills.

In Auburn, the area just off I-80 at Nevada Street (bounded by Court
Street, Lincoln Way, Washington Street, and Maple and Commercial
streets) is Old Town Auburn. This is an ideal example of an Old West
gold town transformed into a boutiqued downtown. Nevertheless, it still
maintains a strong historic feel with original buildings boasting false
storefronts along steep, cobbled streets. Head to the Bootleggers Old
Town Tavern & Grill, 210 Washington St. (% 530-889-2229), for a lunch
stop with an appealing local vibe.
To get some background history on the area, stop at the Placer County
Courthouse, the notable neoclassical building with a mismatched hat —
a Renaissance gold dome — at the top of the hill at 101 Maple St. (at
Court Street and Lincoln Way). Inside is the petite Placer County
Museum (% 530-889-6500), which tells the story of Auburn’s rise as a
mother-lode gold-rush town, and is a great place to pick up information
on other attractions in the area. Across Maple Street is Latitudes Bistro
(% 530-885-9535), one of the better places to eat in the area; the menu
spotlights a different area of the world each month.
Where to stay in the Gold Country
If you want to spend more time in Gold Country, the following places are
good bets for lodging:
 Located within the bounds of the Marshall Gold Discovery Park,
the Coloma Country Inn Bed & Breakfast (% 530-622-6919; www.
colomacountryinn.com) captures the spirit of the locale in a
lovely and well-appointed 1852 farmhouse.
 In Auburn, your best bet is the Holiday Inn of Auburn, on Highway
49 (% 800-814-8787 or 530-887-8787; www.holiday-inn.com).
Certain accommodations near Yosemite National Park make ideal bases
for exploring the region, especially the Groveland Hotel and hotels in
Oakhurst, such as the posh Château du Sureau. See Chapter 16 for details.

Prospecting for History in Sacramento
California’s state capital is, admittedly, not the most exciting destination
in this book. The nearest “real” city, San Francisco, has always held an
iron grip on sophistication and glamour and that won’t change no matter
who’s sitting in the governor’s office. Snobbery aside, however, the town
is absolutely worth a one-day or overnight detour, especially if you have
kids on board. Our governator, Arnold Schwarzenegger, has become a
tourist draw (not that he’s available to sign autographs), and Old
Sacramento, with a terrific train museum and riverside location, is
quaint and walkable. Just a 90-minute drive from South Lake Tahoe (two
hours from North Lake Tahoe), Sacto is a practical stop on the way to or
from Tahoe for an overnight or a side trip if you’re skipping the Gold
Country but still want to sample state history.
Getting there
Vast housing tracts and freeways surround the city, but finding your way
to Old Sacramento and the downtown area is easy. From I-5, take the 
J Street exit and follow the signs. Highway 80 from the Bay Area inter-
sects I-5 just south of downtown. If you’re driving from Tahoe, head west
on Highway 50 to Highway 80 and north on I-5.
What do the locals do on their way to visit the relatives in Sacramento?
We stop at the factory outlets in Vacaville off Highway 80. No fab designer
dubs unfortunately, but you can pick up Levi’s, all kinds of athletic shoes,
baby OshKosh, and imperfect Jelly Belly candies (as if there were such a
thing!).
Where to stay and dine
If you decide to spend the night, you’ll have a reasonable selection of
chain hotels and motels to choose from. The Hyatt Regency on L Street
is where the governor stays when he’s in town (he still lives in Los
Angeles), but our suggestion, just for the fun of it, is to book a room on
the Delta King, 1000 Front St. (% 916-444-5464 or 800-825-5464; www.
deltaking.com). A 1927 riverboat docked in Old Sacramento, the state-
rooms are tiny but cute, and the boat is outfitted with a restaurant and a
115-seat theater presenting shows nightly. Room rates are $169 to $219
for two ($550 for the Captain’s Suite).
Restaurants dot Old Sacramento and the locals are happy with all the
new places to dine around the capitol building. Rumor has it that the
guv likes the Esquire Grill, 1213 K St. (% 916-448-8900), but even if
that’s unsubstantiated, the classic American chophouse is as good as it
gets around here.
When you need a break from exploring the city’s attractions, check out
the cafeteria in the basement of the State Capitol. You won’t find a better
value in town for Tex-Mex specials; we tried the food and found it more
than satisfying. You can also pick up a sandwich for $4.95 that comes
Chapter 15: Lake Tahoe 205

with chips and a soda. The décor down there is dreadful and dark, but
you can order lunch to go and eat it outside in the beautiful park.
Exploring California’s capital city
Sacramento’s highlights center on a downtown core that includes the
State Capitol and Old Sacramento. Also worth a visit is Sutter’s Fort
State Historical Park.
Street parking is metered and will require a handful of quarters if you
choose to go that route. Otherwise, there are parking garages around
Old Sacramento. Trolleys make 40-minute round-trip drives around the
Capitol Mall and Old Sacramento; the fare is 50¢, and this is a cheap,
stress-free way to get your bearings.
Old Sacramento
When elementary school kids in San Francisco make the annual train trip
to the state capital, this is where they disembark. Old Sacramento, along
the Sacramento River, was the center of commerce around the time of the
gold rush, when Sam Brannan opened a general store here. Flooding and
fires decimated most of the buildings in the 1850s; in the 1860s, a plan to
raise the area above flood level was instituted, but eventually businesses
moved east closer to the state capitol buildings. Forty years ago, the city
decided to reinvest in the area, renovating the buildings that could be sal-
vaged and reconstructing others. Pick up a map at the visitor center on
Second Street, which includes a walking tour of these 20 blocks. Yes, this
is a tourist-driven area with way too many sweet shops, useless trinkets,
and annoyingly stupid T-shirts; on the other hand, it’s no more offensive
than Pier 39 in San Francisco or Cannery Row in Monterey. Plus, it’s kind
of pretty down there by the river.
The great attraction if you have the slightest interest in the railroad is the
California State Railroad Museum, Second and I streets (% 916-445-6645;
www.californiastaterailroadmuseum.org). A gigantic building filled
with 19th-century trains, you can watch a film that traces the history of
railroading, and clamber aboard to view the elegant dining and sleeping
accommodations. The exhibit on the Chinese laborers who essentially
built the transcontinental railroad is especially touching. Between April
and September, steam-train rides are offered on the weekends. It’s open
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $8 for adults, $3 for kids 6 to 17. 
The State Capitol Building
The last of California’s eight capitol buildings (the first five being located
in other cities) was occupied near the end of 1869, but actually completed
in 1874. The classical Roman-Corinthian structure is stately and grand,
especially compared to the modern buildings now housing the majority of
the government’s offices. The capitol sits at one end of a Victorian-styled
park with 40 acres of trees, war memorials, and a fragrant rose garden.

206

You can take guided tours on the hour or wander around the historic
offices and exhibit rooms. The Assembly and Senate galleries on the third
floor are open for viewing as well. Strangely enough, you can even walk
into the governor’s outer office and check out the big, framed photograph
of Arnold and Maria, prominently featuring the largest, toothiest grins in
California.
Tenth Street, between L and N streets. % 916-324-0333. www.assembly.ca.gov/
museum. Free admission. Open: Daily 8:30 a.m.–5 p.m.; hourly tours start at 9 a.m.
Sutter’s Fort State Historic Park
An entrepreneur with a history of failed businesses, the Swiss immigrant
Captain Johann Augustus Sutter temporarily left his wife and five children
behind in Basel, Switzerland, in 1834 to escape his creditors and seek his
fortune in America. After travels across the states, and sailing as far as
Honolulu, Sutter made his way up the Sacramento and American rivers,
landing finally just a mile from the eventual site of his fort. California 
history — notably Northern California’s — is shaped in large part by the
discovery of gold at Sutter’s Coloma mill. But Sutter, an educated, intelli-
gent, and uncommonly decent man, first built a fort in 1840 that was the
center of trade and farming in the area he named “New Helvetia.” Much of
the fort today has been reconstructed and belongs to the California State
Park system. Along with a self-guided audio tour that covers this remark-
able man’s life, you see examples of the compound’s workshops and living
quarters. Living-history events and pioneer demonstration days are often
scheduled on Saturdays throughout the year. It’s a must for kids, but we
thought the place was pretty cool ourselves.
Between K and L streets and 26th and 28th streets. % 916-445-4422. www.parks.
ca.gov. Admission: $6 adults 17 and over, $3 kids. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.

Chapter 16
Yosemite National Park
In This Chapter
 Planning your trip to America’s favorite national park
 Deciding where to stay and dine within Yosemite
 Weighing your options in the nearby gateway towns
 Exploring Yosemite — on, and preferably off, the beaten path
 Discovering the delights of Mammoth Mountain
P
repare to meet one of the most spectacular places in the world.
Yosemite National Park encompasses nearly 1,200 square miles and
a wildly diverse landscape that soars from 2,000 feet to an awesome
13,000 feet above sea level. It’s a blue-ribbon destination all the way,
home to the world’s most impressive glacier-carved canyon (Yosemite
Valley); three of the world’s ten tallest waterfalls, including North
America’s tallest (2,425-ft. Yosemite Falls); the world’s largest granite
monolith (El Capitan); and the world’s biggest and oldest trees (the giant
sequoias). However, those nature-bending records don’t even begin to
describe the wonder of Yosemite — you must come and see this breath-
taking place for yourself.
The mile-wide, 7-mile-long Yosemite Valley is the attraction-laden heart
of the mammoth park — much of the rest is unreachable wilderness.
When you arrive, you see why this valley is called the ultimate example
of a glacier-carved canyon: Its flat, open meadows and oak and mixed-
conifer woodlands come to an abrupt halt on all sides, where sheer walls
suddenly soar to the sky. The towering cliffs, craggy monoliths, rounded
domes, and tumbling waterfalls will have you craning your neck in wide-
eyed amazement. Between Memorial and Labor days, however, the mam-
moth crowds may give you a migraine, because 90 percent of the park’s
visitors congregate in the valley floor. Think of it as the Waikiki Beach of
Yosemite.
You shouldn’t miss the valley, but schedule some time to poke around
the quieter areas of the park, too, especially if you crave a more genuine
wilderness experience. Head for the serene, (largely) crowd-free High
Country in the summer. The entire Sierra Nevada doesn’t get any more
beautiful than this splendid mix of verdant subalpine meadows and
forest, crystal-blue glacial lakes, granite spires, and domes. Or make

time for Mariposa Grove, the sky-scraping stand of giant sequoias at the
lovely, woodsy, civilized south end.
The beauty of Yosemite is that it’s a foolproof park. To accommodate all
those tourists, the Park Service has become extremely visitor-friendly,
offering lots of available guidance, great facilities, and easy hikes and
river access, making Yosemite an ideal place to vacation with children.
The summer madness horning in on your communion with nature will
seem like the biggest, best summer camp in the world to a kid.
Even at the height of summer chaos you can have a genuine wilderness
experience in Yosemite. You don’t have to be a survivalist to venture out
of the valley and into one of the more remote areas of the park. Whenever
you visit, give yourself the space and time (at least two days; more is
ideal) to truly appreciate this humbling, awe-inspiring place.
Timing Your Visit
Most people visit Yosemite in June, July, and August — which means
that if you don’t have to come during those months, don’t. The Yosemite
Valley is so crowded in the summer that it seems more like a theme park
than a natural wonderland. But if your vacation falls during these
months, you don’t have to stay away.
If you’re not staying in the park, enter early (the superintendent has
been known, on a few occasions, to close the gates when the park
reaches maximum capacity) and plan to spend much of your visit in
areas other than the Yosemite Valley, where most visitors congregate.
On the upside, summer is the best time to visit Tuolumne (too-all-oh-
mee) Meadows, glorious subalpine meadows at an altitude of 8,600 feet,
and take the drive to the summit of Glacier Point, at 7,214 feet, for spec-
tacular views over the valley.
Mid-September through October is a magical season. Visitor numbers
drop, but the park remains fully accessible; the roads to Tuolumne
Meadows and Glacier Point generally don’t close until November.
If you really want the park all to yourself, visit in winter. The valley is
marvelously peaceful, and the snow provides an exquisite contrast to 
all that granite. (The average annual accumulation on the valley floor is
about 4 ft.) If the weather gods are with you, you’ll wonder why anyone
bothers to visit in the summer. Plus, accommodations are usually dis-
counted. The High Country is under about 20 feet of snow from
November through May, however, and pretty much off limits.
When deciding how much time to spend touring Yosemite, go with more
rather than less. One day, even a full one, is simply not enough. Give
yourself at least two days; three full days comes closer to the ideal.

Accessing the Park
You can enter the park through any one of four main entrances (locate
each in the “Yosemite National Park” map on p. 212):
 The most commonly used entrance (and most traffic-congested 
in summer) is the Arch Rock Entrance, on the west side of the 
park via Highway 140, through the “Hey, where’d it go?” town of 
El Portal. (This entrance closes nightly between 10:30 p.m. and 
6:30 a.m.) This gateway offers the most direct access to Yosemite
Valley, where your first stop should be the main Valley Visitor
Center after you dump your car in a day-use lot (if you’re staying
outside the park) or at your accommodations. The center is open
daily from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 On the west side, north of Arch Rock, is the Big Oak Flat Entrance,
on Highway 120, which takes you through Groveland first. It’s also
valley-convenient, but you can pass by the congested valley and
head straight for the High Country. If you’re going to bypass the
valley, be sure to stop by the Big Oak Flat Information Station
(% 209-379-1899), just inside the park gate, for information and
maps; open daily from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 You can also arrive via the South Entrance, on Highway 41, about
35 miles south of Yosemite Valley. It’s the most convenient entrance
for those coming from points south, and it boasts some of the most
wonderful vistas in the park. You’ll also use it if you stay at Tenaya
Lodge or at one of the accommodations options in Oakhurst (see
the “Where to Stay and Dine outside the Park” section later in this
chapter). The Wawona Information Station (% 209-375-9501) is
open only in summer from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. daily. Turn off
Highway 41 at Chilnualna Falls Road and take the first right after
the stables.
 The Tioga Pass Entrance, the eastern High Country gateway on
Highway 120, is open only in summer. Use this entrance if you come
from Lake Tahoe (see Chapter 15), or from Death Valley National
Park (see Chapter 26). The Tuolumne Meadows Visitor Center
(% 209-372-0263) is open daily in summer from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.
Getting there by car
From Lake Tahoe, you can take U.S. 50 west out of Tahoe to I-395 south
to Highway 120, which leads you into the park’s High Country via the
summer-only Tioga Pass Entrance. The three-and-a-half-hour drive is
doable between late June and the first snowfall (usually early Nov).
Otherwise, you have a five- or six-hour drive down winding Highway 49,
which can be extra-slow-going in bad weather.
From San Francisco, the drive is about three and a half hours. Take I-580
west to I-205 to Highway 120, and then plan the rest of your route along
highways 120, 99, or 140, depending on where you’re staying.

Chapter 16: Yosemite National Park 213

From the Central Coast, you have a couple of options, depending on
your departure point. From the Monterey Peninsula, take U.S. 101 to
Highway 152 to Highway 99 north to Highway 140 to the Arch Rock
Entrance or take Highway 99 south to Highway 145 to Highway 41 north
to the South Entrance — each roughly a five-hour drive. If you’re starting
farther south on the coast, take U.S. 101 or Highway 1 to Highway 41
(near Morro Bay) and follow it all the way to Yosemite’s south gate.
Expect to spend about five and a half hours on Highway 41.
From Los Angeles, the drive lasts about six and a half hours. Take I-5
north to Highway 99 to either Highway 41 or Highway 140, depending on
where you’re staying.
Rock slides closed a 600-foot-wide section of Highway 140 12 miles west
of the park in April 2006. At press time, the California State Department
of Transportation’s (CalTrans) temporary solution is to build two one-
lane bridges across the Merced River. This 7-mile detour will add a mini-
mum of 30 minutes drive time and there’s no date announced as to when
140 will reopen. For updated information, call % 800-427-7623, or log 
on to http://inciweb.org/incident/236 and select “Ferguson
Rockslide.”
Winging it
Fresno Yosemite International Airport, 5175 E. Clinton Ave., Fresno 
(% 559-498-4095; www.flyfresno.org), is 90 miles south of Yosemite.
From the airport, take Highway 180 to Highway 41 north to the park’s
South Entrance. These airlines fly in:
 Alaska Airlines: % 800-426-0333; www.alaskaair.com
 American: % 800-433-7300; www.aa.com
 America West: % 800-235-9292; www.americawest.com
 Continental: % 800-525-0280; www.flycontinental.com
 Delta: % 800-221-1212; www.delta.com
 Northwest: % 800-225-2525; www.nwa.com
 United/United Express: % 800-241-6522; www.united.com
You can rent a car from one of the major national car-rental companies
located at the airport (see Chapter 7 for car-rental details).
Arriving by train
Another option is to arrive in Merced, 73 miles southwest of the Arch
Rock Entrance, via Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com). You
can then book transportation or a park tour with VIA Adventures
(% 800-842-5463; www.via-adventures.com), which also offers pack-
ages that include accommodations.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
214

Entering and navigating the park
Admission to the park is $20 per car, or $10 per person if you arrive by
bus, by bike, or on foot. Your ticket is good for seven days, so keep it
handy. Reservations are not required, and you’re free to drive around
the park as you please, but these policies can change; call % 209-372-
0200, or visit www.nps.gov/yose to check the latest info before you go.
Do everybody a favor while you’re in Yosemite Valley: Park your car
once (you’ll be directed to a day-use lot if you’re not staying within park
bounds) and use the shuttle system, bikes, or your own tootsies to move
around the valley floor. Free shuttle buses loop the valley daily year-
round, as frequently as every ten minutes in high season. Park manage-
ment is so eager for you to take advantage of this alternative that they
make it a breeze to use. If you’d rather two-wheel it, bike rentals are
available for the entire family at Curry Village (% 209-372-8319) year-
round, and from April through November at Yosemite Lodge (% 209-
372-1208). Use your car only to reach other, far-flung areas of the park,
such as Glacier Point or the High Country.
The Yosemite Area Regional Transportation System (YARTS) offers bus
service from some of the gateway communities, allowing you to leave
your car behind at the motel. For example, both Cedar Lodge and
Yosemite View Lodge just outside the Arch Rock Entrance have on-site
pickups; you can also meet the bus if you’re staying farther west on
Highway 140 in Mariposa. For schedule and fare information, call % 877-
989-2787 or 209-372-4487, or visit www.yarts.com.
Preparing for Your Visit
Here are a few tips to help you get your visit off on the right foot:
 Wear appropriately sturdy shoes. Hiking boots are best, but at
least bring sneakers. Platform slides aren’t going to cut it here.
 Always bring a jacket. Even if the valley floor is hot, the air can
really cool off in the High Country. Rain is most common in the
colder months, but thunderstorms can happen at any time.
 In summer, bring a swimsuit. A hot day may tempt you to take 
a dip in the Merced River. An excellent swimming hole exists at
Stoneman Bridge, near Curry Village in the valley.
 In winter, come with the appropriate snow gear. Bring snow
boots, winter coats — the works. Don’t leave home without tire
chains in the trunk if you’re driving your own car, or inquire about
them when you book your rental vehicle.
 In the High Country, opt for an easier hiking trail than you might
normally choose. The thinness of the air at these elevations can
really tax your system and sap your energy.
Chapter 16: Yosemite National Park 215

 Heed all warnings about the bear problem. Terribly spoiled by
years of human leftovers, black bears have decided that they prefer
Big Macs, Cheetos, and PB&J sandwiches to Mother Nature’s eats.
As a result, they’ve become a real menace to personal property
(and to themselves — Yosemite’s bears are in danger of losing their
natural hunting-and-gathering instincts).
 Don’t leave food in your car. Don’t even leave a stray french fry in
the trunk. Bears have become experts at ripping open cars as if
they were tin cans (most often, they wiggle their claws into the gap
above the door and bend down). Trust us, you don’t want to have
to explain this to Avis. Statistics prove that they’re particularly
fond of white minivans — why, nobody knows. If you camp or stay
in a tent cabin, diligently use the metal food-storage boxes.
Where to Stay and Dine inside the Park
If you’re not thrilled with your lodging or campground reservation, call
back one month before your arrival date to inquire about an upgrade.
The majority of cancellations occur either 3 days or 30 days before
arrival; in fact, rooms often turn over two and three times.
Mariposa County room tax adds an extra 10 percent to your bill.
DNC Parks and Resorts manages all in-park accommodations. You can
make reservations up to one year and a day in advance. Call central
reservations at % 559-253-5635 to reserve, ideally 366 days before your
intended arrival, especially if you hope to visit between Memorial and
Labor days. The phone lines are open Monday through Friday from 
7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., and the serv-
ice accepts all major credit cards. You also can make real-time online
reservations (and find a few more details about the in-park facilities dis-
cussed in this section) at www.yosemitepark.com. Park hotels book up
further in advance than you may expect, so make reservations as early
as possible.
All rates are based on double occupancy. Expect to pay between $3 and
$11 for each extra person ($21 at the Ahwahnee). Kids can sometimes
stay free, so ask. Call the special-offer hot line at % 559-454-0555 for
discounted prices on winter stays (mid-Nov through Mar).
Ahwahnee Hotel
$$$$$
Yosemite Valley
The park’s most elegant place to sleep is this baronial, ultraromantic land-
mark lodge, handsomely decorated in Native American style. Despite the
elegance, it’s right at home in the valley — it has the same grand scale.
Afternoon tea is served in the great lounge, and breakfast, lunch, and dinner
are served in the stunning dining room. Feel free to come for lunch in your
shorts and sneakers, but dinner is a jacket- or sweater-required affair.

Curry Village
$–$$
Yosemite Valley
Sitting in the shadow of Glacier Point is Curry Village, whose accommoda-
tions include a few standard motel rooms, rustic wood-frame cabins (some
with private bathrooms, some without), and canvas-covered tent cabins
that are halfway to camping but still have wood floors, electricity, and maid
service; they share a couple of central bathhouses. The whole place has a
summer-camp-gone-to-heck vibe about it, but it’s convenient and fun if pri-
vacy isn’t a big concern. The village includes a cafeteria, a burger shack, a
coffee and ice-cream counter, and a pizza parlor, plus an outdoor swimming
pool and an activities desk with bike rentals (cross-country skis, snow-
shoes, and skates in winter). Fifty heated tent cabins are available in the
winter, when you can also make use of the outdoor ice rink.
If you book a tent cabin at Curry Village, ask when you arrive whether any
cancellations have cleared the way for an upgrade. If it’s available, chances
are good they’ll give it away for free. It never hurts to ask, especially out-
side the summer season.

Housekeeping Camp
$
Yosemite Valley
This arrangement is the closest you can get to roughing it without toting
your own tent. The camp basically consists of a collection of semi-
furnished concrete-and-canvas lean-to’s on the banks of the Merced River.
Each unit has a fire pit and grill; this is the only accommodation in the area
that allows guests to cook meals. The experience is like camping at a KOA,
with shared bathhouse, laundry, and a small grocery store.
See map p. 212. % 559-253-5635. www.yosemitepark.com. Free parking. Rack
rates: $72 up to four persons in one unit. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Tuolumne Meadows Lodge and White Wolf Lodge
$–$$
High Country (North Yosemite)
Both of these lodges have the same metal-frame canvas tent cabins that
Curry Village has, but without the chaotic squatters’ vibe. They are clean
and neat, and most cabins sleep four and have wood-burning stoves.
(White Wolf also has four cute wood cabins with private bathrooms.)
White Wolf is a bit more out of the way and has fewer facilities; breakfast
and dinner are served in the restaurant/general store. Tuolumne Meadows
is larger and has a burger stand, a grocery store, stables, a mountaineer-
ing school, a gas station, and a dining tent for breakfast and dinner.

Wawona Hotel
$$–$$$
South Yosemite
The Wawona isn’t as spectacular or luxurious as the Ahwahnee, but this
national historic landmark lies in the much quieter southern section of the
park (providing great relief from the valley crowds in summer) and boasts
great Roaring ’20s charm. The rooms contain no TVs or telephones, and
only about half offer private bathrooms. Facilities include a nice restau-
rant that serves three meals; a pool; a tennis court; and 9 holes of golf.

Yosemite Lodge at the Falls
$$–$$$
Yosemite Valley
At press time, Yosemite Lodge at the Falls was about to embark on major
construction, scheduled for a 2008 debut. The plan includes new buildings
with more of a lodge feel (as opposed to motel-like) and rerouting Northside
Drive, which will separate the auto traffic from all the people walking to the
falls. Park management does not intend to shutter the lodge during con-
struction — the idea is that new rooms will open before existing ones are
demolished. If you’re determined to stay in the heart of the valley bustle
during these works, the standard rooms are okay, but lodge rooms with a
bit more space and a view of Yosemite Falls are much preferable. None has
air-conditioning or TV. The lodge includes a food court, a lovely restaurant,
and a snack shack by the pool, all of which will stay open.
The dinner menu at Yosemite Lodge’s Mountain View restaurant and at the
Ahwahnee are nearly identical, as is the quality of the food, but the prices
are lower at the lodge.
See map p. 212. % 559-253-5635. www.yosemitepark.com. Free parking. Rack
rates: $98–$178 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
In addition, Yosemite has so many campsites that managing them is its
own cottage industry. Still, they book up very quickly, so call as early as
possible, especially for stays from May through September. Park Services
accepts campsite reservations up to five months in advance, starting on
the 15th of each month. (In other words, on Feb 15 you can begin to make
reservations for June 15–July 14.) Calling on the first day is wise if you
want your first choice.
You can find a complete rundown of the camping options, including fee
information and locations, at www.nps.gov/yose/trip/camping.htm.
You can also get the information you need by calling the reservations
line at % 800-436-7275 or 301-722-1257 daily between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
218

You can make online reservations at http://reservations.nps.gov. If
Yosemite campgrounds are full, the reservations agents will gladly refer
you to the National Forest campgrounds just outside the park.
Where to Stay and Dine outside the Park
Each of the hotels in this section is near one of the park’s main gates. 
In addition to the two motels closest to the park, Cedar Lodge and
Yosemite View Lodge (see the listings in this section), Yosemite Motels
(% 888-742-4371; www.yosemite-motels.com) also runs the just-fine
Comfort Inn Oakhurst ($80–$100 double), 15 miles south of the South
Entrance, as well as two motels in Mariposa: the Best Western Yosemite
Way Station ($87–$97 double) and Comfort Inn Mariposa ($50–$90
double). The Mariposa motels are fine choices if everything else is
booked, but you’re better off first trying to stay closer to the park.
If you stay at Cedar Lodge or Yosemite View Lodge, or at any of the
Mariposa choices discussed previously, you can leave your car behind
and use the YARTS shuttle to reach the park if you choose (see the
“Entering and navigating the park” section earlier in this chapter).
The area can get booked up in the busy season, so if our favorites are
full, contact the Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bureau (% 559-683-4636;
www.go2yosemite.net) for additional options.
Expect to eat at your hotel restaurant: Only if you stay in Oakhurst or
Mariposa will you have other restaurants to choose from. Even there,
pickings are slim — limited largely to pizza and fast food — so don’t let
dining dictate your choice of base. The exception: Erna’s Elderberry
House at the sumptuous Château du Sureau in Oakhurst.
Best Western Yosemite Gateway Inn
$–$$
Oakhurst
This perfectly nice motel, 15 miles due south of the park, offers pleasant
rooms that are big enough for families. All rooms have coffeemakers, many
have microwaves and fridges, and some have kitchens. Facilities include
an indoor pool area with a spa, sauna, and exercise equipment; an outdoor
pool and spa; and a coin-op laundry.

El Portal
Another nice motel, this one is located 8 miles outside of the Arch Rock
entrance in a hilly setting along the Merced River. Rooms are motel-standard

spa, a grocery store, and two restaurants — one a nice dining room and the
other a casual pizza parlor.

Château du Sureau
$$$$$
Oakhurst
Finding one of America’s finest inns in the rinky-dink town of Oakhurst, just
a 20-minute drive from Yosemite’s South Entrance, is wild. Staying at this
gated Relais & Châteaux villa is like being entertained by European royalty,
complete with maids to bring you tea and cookies and butlers to press your
dinner clothes. The inn is supremely gorgeous and comfy — and the staff
won’t bat an eye when you stumble in dusty after a day in the park. Even if
you’re accustomed to luxury travel, you’ll never forget this place. One of
California’s most celebrated restaurants, Erna’s Elderberry House, is on
the premises. The French Provençal–style cuisine is well worth a special-
occasion splurge, even if you don’t stay here ($92 prix-fixe).

Groveland Hotel
$$–$$$
Groveland
The charm of this sweet historic inn and the Wild West–style one-horse
town makes up for the drive (23 miles west from the Big Oak Flat
Entrance). The hotel houses the finest restaurant in town, plus a groovy
gold-rush-era saloon. Rooms are furnished with antiques and have private
bathrooms. A great in-between base if you’d also like to do a bit of Gold
Country exploring along Highway 49.

Tenaya Lodge

Fish Camp
This just-remodeled, gorgeous destination lodge draws in parkgoers as well
as conference groups with its stone’s-throw proximity to the park, terrific
facilities, on-site activities, and rustic-glamorous wilderness-lodge-goes-
modern ambience. The ultracomfy rooms are done in area-appropriate style
and boast all the latest comforts. The facilities include two pools, three
restaurants, game room, gym, spa services, and a terrific kids’ program.

Yosemite View Lodge
$$$
El Portal
Just 2 miles outside the Arch Rock Entrance, this large motel complex is
the closest you can get to Yosemite without actually staying within park
bounds. Rooms are large and very comfy; all have kitchenettes, and many
have Jacuzzi tubs, gas fireplaces, and balconies overlooking the rushing
Merced River (we recommend spending a little extra for one of these). On-

Exploring Yosemite
We highly recommend launching your visit with the two-hour guided
Valley Floor Tour, conducted aboard an open-air tram in warm weather,
a cozy bus in winter. The tour is an absolute must if your visit is limited
to one day, because it’s the only way you can see all the park’s major fea-
tures. You can see the valley highlights by tour in the morning, and then
spend your afternoon exploring the High Country or heading south to
Wawona. Tours run daily, year-round, at regular intervals throughout the
day. Tickets are $22 adults, $17 children; you can buy them at a booth
just outside the Valley Store in Yosemite Village, or at any park accom-
modations tour desk. For more information, call the Yosemite Lodge
Tour Desk (% 209-372-1240). Also ask about similar seasonal tours of
other regions of the park.
If you’re driving into Yosemite Valley from the South Entrance along
Highway 41, stop at Tunnel View for one of the park’s most stunning
vistas. Pull over along with everybody else after you pass through the
Wawona Tunnel on Route 41 for a bird’s-eye overview of the valley. You
can also catch this view on the drive south from the valley to Glacier
Point Road or the Wawona section of the park.
Yosemite Valley highlights
The mile-wide, 7-mile-long Yosemite Valley is the attraction-laden heart
of the mammoth park. Most park services are located in Yosemite
Village, which even has a post office and a sizable store.
Make the Valley Visitor Center your first stop in Yosemite Village. You
can pick up all the maps and information you need here, watch a short
introductory movie, check the schedule of orientation programs and
Chapter 16: Yosemite National Park 221

ranger-led activities, and get enough information about glacial geology
and the local flora and fauna to give you a basic understanding of the
park.
Next to the visitor center sits the Yosemite Museum, where you can find
out about life in the valley before the Europeans showed up, and the
Ansel Adams Gallery, which is wonderful for both browsing and buying
the works of the master photographer as well as contemporary photogra-
phers who have a special talent for training their lens on the natural
world. Shuttle service takes you to all corners of the valley from here (see
the “Entering and navigating the park” section earlier in this chapter).
You won’t want to miss the following Yosemite Valley highlights:
 Even before you reach the valley, you’ll see beautiful Bridalveil Fall
on your drive in; just look to the right. It’s one of the prettiest falls
in the park. You can pull into the parking lot and follow an easy,
short trail to the base of the falls. (Both Bridalveil and Yosemite
falls are usually dry in the summer.)
 To your left as you drive in, past Bridalveil, is El Capitan, the
largest piece of solid granite in the world. Pull in to the turnout at
El Capitan meadow to scour the immense face of this 3,593-foot-tall
monolith for rock climbers. (Climbers are a cinch to spot after
dark, when they turn their headlamps on.)
 From shuttle stop no. 7, just west of the visitor center, take an easy
half-mile round-trip walk to the base of Lower Yosemite Fall. As
you stand on the bridge facing the spray, you’ll really feel the
impressive force of the continent’s tallest waterfall.
 From the valley floor, look to the northeast and you can’t miss Half
Dome, Yosemite’s most famous feature — 4,733 extraordinary feet
of 87-million-year-old brawny rock.
 The Nature Center at Happy Isles, on the easternmost shuttle loop
(stop no. 16), has great hands-on nature exhibits for kids, plus
wheelchair-accessible paths that run along the banks of the Merced
River. Stop here early in your visit for information on the Valley
Junior Ranger Program, which gives kids the opportunity to earn
rewards for completing special park projects.
Glacier Point
In summer, you can drive the 32 miles from the valley floor to 3,200-foot
Glacier Point, which offers the park’s most stunning panoramic views.
Not only can you see all the valley’s highlights, but you catch views of
the High Sierras to the north and west that are beyond breathtaking.
From the valley, take Highway 41 to the Chinquapin junction and turn
left onto Glacier Point Road (turn right if you’re coming up from the
South Entrance); allow about an hour each way for the drive. Sunrise
from Glacier Point is spectacular.
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
222

If you’re visiting in winter, bring your cross-country ski gear (or rent it at
Badger Pass). You can drive as far as Badger Pass Ski Area (less than
halfway), and ski your way to Glacier Point from there. Call ahead to
inquire about overnight cross-country ski excursions to the point.
Wawona/South Yosemite
Mariposa Grove, at the quieter, woodsy southern section of the park
(about 35 miles south of the valley via Highway 41), is the most impres-
sive of the park’s three groves of giant sequoias, the world’s largest
trees. Giant sequoias are shorter but more massive than their lanky
cousins, the coastal redwoods (see Chapter 14), with distinctive bell-
bottom bases as large as 35 feet in diameter. That is one big tree — and
you’ll find a whole stand of them here! Grizzly Giant, the oldest tree in
the grove, is one of the largest sequoias in the world.
From the parking area, an easy interpretive trail leads through the grove,
with placards offering a self-guided tour. The grove also has a small
museum. From the valley, follow Highway 41 south and take the signed
turnoff; the drive takes about 75 minutes. You can also hop on a shuttle
bus to reach the grove, but the long distance from the valley makes driv-
ing more efficient for time-challenged visitors. The grove is open year-
round, but heavy snow occasionally closes the access road.
The High Country
At an 8,600-foot elevation, stunning Tuolumne Meadows bursts with
wildflowers in summer (this high up, where the snow sticks around
through June, summer seems more like spring). The 55-mile drive from
the valley takes one and a half hours along the gorgeous Tioga Road
(Highway 120; open in summer only). The magnificent drive alone is half
the fun, so allow more time to stop at the myriad overlooks. You’ll pass
lush meadows, thickly wooded forests, granite domes, and ice-blue gla-
cial lakes — the most notable being Tenaya Lake, a popular spot for
windsurfing, fishing, and canoeing.
Consider buying a copy of The Yosemite Road Guide at the visitor center
before you set out. This publication contains a good self-guided driving
tour of the route. After you arrive, stop at the Tuolumne Meadows
Visitor Center for orientation, trail, and program information.
Walking the walk: Hiking and nature trails
With 860 miles of trails, Yosemite has a hike for you, no matter what
your level of stamina and experience. Nature writers dedicate whole 
volumes to hiking the park, so you’re better off referring to a more 
complete source for the full range of options.
In addition to the walks to Yosemite Falls and Bridalveil Fall (see the
“Yosemite Valley highlights” section earlier in this chapter), here are
some of the best day hikes. Check the Yosemite Guide newspaper for
Chapter 16: Yosemite National Park 223

additional day-hiking options. A very useful “Yosemite Valley Day Hikes”
single-sheet handout is also generally available. Be smart and remember
to check conditions at the visitor center before you set out.
 The easy mile-long round-trip walk to Mirror Lake will reward you
with remarkable views. The trailhead leaves from shuttle stop no.
17 (behind the stables). You can then follow the lovely 5-mile loop
around the lake if you choose.
 The John Muir/Mist Trail is the park’s most popular hike, so set
out early or save it for later in the day. The trail leaves from Happy
Isles (shuttle stop no. 16) and climbs alongside the Merced River
(whose rushing whitewater naturalist and park godfather John
Muir called “the symphony of the Sierras”) to Vernal Fall. The ini-
tial .75-mile portion of the trail is moderately difficult and follows 
a paved but steep trail that leads to a bridge with terrific views of
the falls.
If you consider yourself to be hardy, you can continue along the
strenuous .75-mile “Mist” portion, which sharply ascends 600 more
feet (for a total elevation gain of 1,000 ft.) directly alongside the 
fall (expect spray) and includes countless granite steps (that
StairMaster experience will really come in handy here) before 
you reach the pool at the top. Allow two to four hours.
 Up at Tuolumne Meadows, try the easy 1.5-mile round-trip walk 
to Soda Springs. The trailhead leaves from just east of the visitor
center and follows a gurgling river through a peaceful section of
meadow to a bubbling carbonated spring.
 Hardcore hikers may want to tackle the 17-mile cable-hike ascent to
the top of Half Dome, a full-day affair that’s only for the hardiest.
You need leather gloves and hiking boots with serious traction. Call
the information line at % 209-372-0200 for details or consult a
ranger before you go.
To tour the park with a knowledgeable guide — an excellent idea, espe-
cially if you want to venture off the busiest trails — go with Yosemite
Guides (% 209-379-9111; www.yosemiteguides.com). They’ll lead you
on natural-history walks and birding tours, take you fly-fishing, and even
rent you a mountain bike. They have a desk at the Yosemite View Lodge
(see the “Where to Stay and Dine outside the Park” section earlier in this
chapter), but we highly recommend booking before you arrive.
Talking the talk: Ranger-led programs
In addition to guided tram and bus tours (see the “Exploring Yosemite”
section earlier in this chapter), park rangers offer a phenomenal number
of guided walks and interpretive programs. The calendar is chockfull
from morning until night with morning-light photo walks, birding walks,
bear talks, Discover Yosemite family programs, brown-bag lunch lec-
tures, fireside discussions . . . you get the picture. A number of children’s
Part III: Northern California: Redwoods, Wind, and Wonder 
224

programs are offered, and the Junior Ranger program is excellent. Some
activities carry a fee, but many are free. Check the Yosemite Guide news-
paper or inquire at the visitor center for the complete schedule.
The artist in you may want to check the schedule of free, informal, out-
door art classes offered in various media throughout the summer by the
Art Activity Center, located in Yosemite Village next to the Village Store.
You can find the schedule on the Yosemite Valley Activities page at
www.yosemitepark.com, under “Recreation.”
The highly respected Yosemite Theater (behind the Valley Visitor’s
Center) stages dramatic interpretive programs (actorly portrayals of
Spirit of John Muir, for example, or Conversations with a Tramp), as well
as occasional concerts in the evenings. Tickets are usually less than $10
for adults and less than $5 for kids. These events are hugely popular, so
buy your tickets early in the day to avoid disappointment.
Gathering More Information
Whether traveling to Yosemite, Mammoth Mountain, or both, contact
these visitor organizations for more details about your destination.
Yosemite National Park
Call the park’s 24-hour information line at % 209-372-0200, or go online
to www.yosemitepark.com. You can also use this number to check road
conditions (always a good idea). Request a copy of the official Yosemite
Guide when you call. You can find this seasonal newspaper in the park,
but it has invaluable trip-planning information — including the latest on
road construction and policy changes to mitigate traffic congestion —
that can come in handy before you go.
The Yosemite Association maintains a useful site at www.yosemite.org,
complete with an online bookstore where you can order materials to
read up on the park before you go.
For information on the surrounding area, your best source is the
Yosemite Sierra Visitors Bureau, 40637 Hwy. 41, Oakhurst (% 559-683-
4636; www.yosemite-sierra.org). In addition to providing general
visitor information, they’re happy to help with just-outside-the-park
lodging reservations. Another good site is www.yosemite.com.

Part IV
The Central Coast

In this part . . .
T
his part covers California’s Central Coast, which includes
such wonderful destinations as the Monterey Peninsula,
Big Sur, Hearst Castle, and our personal favorite (and home-
town), Santa Barbara.
Where the San Francisco Bay Area meets the Monterey
Peninsula sits Santa Cruz, California’s kinda wacky surf town.
If you ask us (and apparently you did), the Central Coast —
that stretch between San Francisco and Los Angeles — 
represents California at its very best. The drive along coastal
Highway 1 is breathtaking in more ways than one. The
Monterey Peninsula Cradles Monterey Bay, one of the richest
and most diverse marine habitats on Earth, plus a collection
of the state’s most delightful communities, from family-
friendly Monterey itself to world-class golf mecca Pebble
Beach to cozy Carmel-by-the-Sea. Be sure to dedicate a full
day to the natural splendor of Big Sur; trust us, you won’t
regret it, even if you don’t want to stay in one of the region’s
funky hotels. Hearst Castle, Cambria, fairy-tale Solvang, gor-
geous Santa Barbara, and the peaceful Ojai Valley complete
this thoroughly charming part of the state.

In This Chapter
 Deciding when to visit and where to stay and eat
 Enjoying the boardwalk — and other surfside fun
 Shopping, strolling, and riding through the redwoods
S
anta Cruz, the quintessential college town, beach town, and surf
mecca, sits just a stone’s throw from the Bay Area at the northwest-
ern end of Monterey Bay. Monterey is the prime destination along the
coast (see Chapter 18), but Santa Cruz is within easy reach of San
Francisco — perfect for Northern California vacationers who want a
taste of genuine Golden State beach life or for anyone who wants to
avoid the tourist throngs that can overwhelm Monterey in summer.
Families with kids in tow will especially enjoy the Santa Cruz Beach
Boardwalk (% 831-423-5590; www.beachboardwalk.com), the West
Coast’s only seaside amusement park. If you hail from the East Coast,
push those visions of the gritty Jersey boardwalk from your mind —
Santa Cruz’s version is everything a seaside boardwalk was meant to be.
It’s clean, family-friendly, and filled with amusements, from arcade games
(“Getcha stuffed Elmo right he-ah! Three plays for a dol-lah!”) to cotton-
candy and funnel-cake vendors to thrill rides — even an old-fashioned
wooden roller coaster that’s rickety good fun. And, in summer, the beach
scene out front is straight out of the movie Gidget.
Inland from the beach lies a charming downtown whose hippie element
has been minimized, but not eliminated, by necessary post-earthquake
gentrification. (Santa Cruz was seriously damaged in the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.) As a result, you’ll find a nice blend of affordable but
high-quality restaurants and boutiques, along with a genuine and appeal-
ing laid-back California coast vibration.

Timing Your Visit
California’s middle coastline enjoys mild weather all the time, with highs
in the mid-70s in summer and the mid-50s in winter. Late summer —
from mid-July through September, and often into October — is usually
best for sunny beachgoing and boardwalk fun. Crowds do not present a
huge problem; in fact, we like Santa Cruz best on summer weekends,
when it’s at its liveliest.
Boardwalk operation is limited to weekends in spring and fall and
restricted to holidays in winter, so be sure to check the schedule 
before you head here with the kids in the off-season.
If you want to stay in Santa Cruz, plan on one or two nights and a couple
of days to enjoy it all, with maybe a third full day to book a fishing char-
ter or kayak trip. If you’re driving between Monterey and the Bay Area,
allot at least a few hours to stop and enjoy the boardwalk and downtown
a bit before continuing on your journey.
Getting There
Santa Cruz is 76 miles southeast of San Francisco. You can choose the
quick route or the scenic route:
 The quick route: Take I-280 to Highway 85 to Highway 17, which
deposits you onto Ocean Street, leading right to the beach. At its
best, this route takes about 90 minutes, but could be much longer 
if you hit traffic.
 The scenic route: Take Highway 1 the entire way, which takes
about twice as long. One stretch of Highway 1, called Devil’s Slide,
isn’t for the faint of heart — as you may have guessed from the
name — but the rest is pretty easy driving.
If you’re heading to Santa Cruz on a weekend morning, skip the quick
route in favor of Highway 1, because Highway 17 tends to logjam with
Bay Area beachgoers.
If you’re coming from Monterey, 45 miles away, take Highway 1 north.
The drive takes about an hour.
Orienting Yourself and Getting Around
Santa Cruz is small and easy to navigate. Both Highway 17 and Highway 1
take you straight into the heart of town (see the “Santa Cruz” map on 
p. 231). Exit Highway 1 from River Street and follow it to Front Street to
reach the shopping and dining district in the heart of downtown (Pacific
Avenue is the main drag).

Proceed down Front Street to oceanfront Beach Street to reach the
beach. Head west along Beach Street until it becomes West Cliff Drive,
whose beachfront path offers gorgeous ocean views and an excellent
look at the local surfing action (and probably a few clusters of fuzzy sea
lions sunning themselves on the rocks below).
Where to Stay in Santa Cruz
To be blunt, the choices around here are mediocre, with a few excep-
tions, and low expectations would be a sensible idea. Because Santa

Cruz is a beach destination, summer rates are significantly higher than
winter rates. You’ll also pay more for the privilege of visiting over the
weekend — and expect a two-night minimum if you include Saturday in
your stay.
If you’d like more lodging options than those included here, check with
the Santa Cruz County Conference and Visitors Council (% 800-833-
3494; www.santacruzca.org).
Count on an extra 12 percent in taxes being tacked on to your hotel bill.
You’ll find plenty of inexpensive motels by the beach, none of which sport
much in the way of curb appeal, but we do approve of the Carousel Motel
(see the listing in this section). The Ocean Pacific Lodge, 120 Washington
St. (% 831-457-1234), is another economical choice offering great value
for money; rates go as low as $59.

If you’re looking for romance, book this little oasis. It’s just a two-minute
drive (or a ten-minute walk) west of downtown, but, because it sits among
an acre of gorgeous gardens, you’d hardly know it. You can choose from 13
charming rooms, all based on an art theme (the Cezanne, the Monet, the
Van Gogh, and so on). Baths have been newly renovated to include
whirlpool tubs, and fireplaces have been added to many rooms. Lovely but
not too cutesy, thank goodness — a real romantic treat.

furnished with pine pieces, microwaves, refrigerators, and TVs. Views
encompass more building than ocean, but the price is right. Vacation pack-
ages that include boardwalk tickets make it an even better value.

looking the water, is a wonderful place to relax. With a kitchen and a pri-

For a quick bite, an alfresco lunch, or an über-casual dinner on a warm night, head for

Customers choose from a handful of fillings and sauces to create a customized taco
or quesadilla, using thick, chewy, handmade corn tortillas. Large plates are also
offered, and we’re anxious to get back to try the mole. Prices are more than reason-
able; three enchiladas verde with rice and beans at $9.95 is the most expensive item
on the menu. Another bonus: The street scene is vastly entertaining.

Pearl Alley Bistro
$$–$$$
Santa Cruz
CALIFORNIA/FRENCH
Locals praise this attractive, slightly funky bistro for it’s warm ambience,
and it is also an excellent spot to enjoy an innovative meal. Expect French
classics such as bouillabaisse and bacon-wrapped sweetbreads, but don’t
be surprised when the chef takes California-style liberties in preparation,
offering such dishes as giant sea scallops served on artichoke bottoms
and aromatically seasoned with lavender and thyme. An oddity is the do-
it-yourself Mongolian barbecue, which you cook at your table on a sizzling
rock. The restaurant offers friendly service and a decent wine selection,
too.

Finding a hidden gem of a cappuccino
Full of students, artists, writers, and intellectuals — both pseudo and actual, we’re
guessing — Café Pergolesi, 418A Cedar St. at Maple Street (% 831-426-1775), gets our
vote for coolest coffeehouse within 50 miles. The quintessential Santa Cruz hangout,
a seat on the patio is the best place to study the locals in all their retro-hippie, 
granola-crunching, unselfconscious glory. Plus, the coffee is so good, we’re tempted
to tout it as the most delicious on the coast.

See map p. 231. 110 Pearl Alley (between Lincoln and Walnut avenues). % 831-429-
8070. www.pearlalley.com. Reservations recommended. Main courses: $17–$26.
AE, MC, V. Open: Sun–Thurs 5:30–9 p.m., Fri–Sat 5:30–10 p.m.
Hitting the Boardwalk
All the good-time boardwalk fun detailed in this section faces Cowell
Beach, a vast stretch of sand that really comes alive in summer. So grab
your beach towel and catch some rays alongside the bevy of beach-
goers, which range from vacationing Bay Area families to bikini-clad
coeds to volleyball-playing surfer dudes.
The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk
This landmark oceanfront boardwalk — the only beach amusement park
on the West Coast — is a retro jewel. The well-kept, beautifully maintained
wooden boardwalk (here in one form or another since 1907) offers nearly
30 rides, plus dozens of skill games, tacky souvenir shops, and food ven-
dors (hot dogs, cotton candy, funnel cake) — more than enough to enter-
tain kids of all ages well into the evening, when a rainbow of bright lights
heightens the appeal. The boardwalk boasts two national landmarks: the
wooden Giant Dipper roller coaster, a 1924 original and still a marvelous
thrill ride; and the 1911 Looff Carousel, a work of art with hand-carved
wooden horses and a magnificent pipe organ. The boardwalk also includes
a good kiddie area with nine rides. You’ll pay for rides with tickets you buy
at booths strategically placed along the boardwalk; the booths also offer
unlimited-ride passes for committed thrill-seekers. The boardwalk is
hugely popular, especially in summer, but the crowds are all part of the
fun. Buy unlimited-ride passes online and save $5; also check for online
coupons.
Along Beach Street, between Pacific and Riverside avenues. % 831-426-7433 or
831-423-5590. www.beachboardwalk.com. Admission: Free; rides $1.95–$3.90; all-
day unlimited-ride pass $26. Open: Memorial Day to Labor Day, daily 11 a.m.–late;
hours for the rest of the year vary widely, with limited holiday operation in winter, so
call or check the Web site for the schedule.
Neptune’s Kingdom and Casino Fun Center/Supercade
Think the boardwalk is limited to nostalgic entertainment? Not hardly!
These enormous, indoor, family-fun centers feature loads of millennium-
worthy fun, including the MaxFlight CyberCoaster, the world’s only rider-
programmable virtual roller coaster; laser tag; a two-story miniature-golf
course with a pirate theme; and enough classic and cutting-edge arcade
games to exhaust the National Mint’s supply of quarters.
Adjacent to the boardwalk at 400 Beach St. % 831-426-7433 or 831-423-5590. www.
beachboardwalk.com. Admission: Free; charges vary for individual games and
attractions. Open: Daily from 10 a.m.; closing hours vary; limited hours in winter.
Part IV: The Central Coast

Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf
This old-time pier isn’t as grimy or commercial as Monterey’s; it has a nice
maritime vibe, but it’s still a shade on the tacky side. Locals cast and crab
from the wooden pier, which is lined with cheesy shops, sportfishing char-
ters, and the to-be-expected mediocre seafood restaurants. Santa Cruz
Boat Rentals (% 831-423-1739) offers equipment rentals as well as bait
and tackle. Stagnaro’s Fishing Trips (% 831-427-2334) can take you deep-
sea fishing as well as on whale- and sea-lion-watching cruises. The wharf
also offers an excellent photo-op of the boardwalk. You can park here, too,
for a minimal charge, but be aware that traffic can really back up; you may
be better off putting your wheels in a street lot.
On Beach Street, just west of the boardwalk. % 831-420-5270. www.santacruz
wharf.com. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 5 a.m.–2 a.m. (most shops open daily 
7 a.m.–9 p.m.).
Surfing and Other Cool Stuff to See and Do
Follow Beach Street west from the boardwalk and it quickly turns into
West Cliff Drive, a gorgeous clifftop road lined with fine old houses on
one side and spectacular ocean views on the other.
At Lighthouse Point (within walking distance of the wharf) sits the petite
Santa Cruz Surfing Museum (% 831-420-6289; www.santacruzsurfing
museum.org), which traces surfing history from both local and broader
points of view (with a nice accent on oft-neglected female surfers). You
can easily see the collection of surfboards and other memorabilia in an
hour or less. It’s open Thursday through Monday from noon to 4 p.m.
The suggested donation is $1.
Lighthouse Point also serves as the perfect vantage for Steamer Lane,
Santa Cruz’s infamous surfing spot. If you’re lucky and the surf’s up,
you’ll see some daredevil pros riding the waves.
Kayaking the bay
Monterey Bay is a fabulous place to kayak in summer, even for begin-
ners. You’ll glide right by sunbathing sea lions and snacking sea otters
as shorebirds swoop through the air around you. Venture Quest
Kayaking (www.kayaksantacruz.com) rents kayaks to experienced 
paddlers at their wharf location (% 831-425-8445). You can schedule 
a guided bay adventure ($45 per person) by calling the Beach Street
location (% 831-427-2267). Venture Quest also offers a guided tour of
Elkhorn Slough, a calm-as-can-be, wildlife-rich estuary of Monterey Bay
($65 per person).
Browsing Pacific Avenue
One of the best things about Santa Cruz is its charming downtown,
which boasts an authentic laid-back California coast charm — not to
Chapter 17: Beach Blanket Babylon: Santa Cruz 237

mention a fair amount of shopping, most of it unique and affordable. The
main drag for browsers is Pacific Avenue, which is chock-a-block with
boutiques, bookstores, and record shops from Mission to Laurel streets.
You’ll find some gems on the side streets just off Pacific, too, such as
Annieglass, 110 Cooper St. (% 831-427-4260), an outlet store for locally
made art-glass jewelry and housewares — a real find if you’re looking 
for gifts.
Need a restroom downtown? The nice folks at Bookshop Santa Cruz,
1520 Pacific Ave. (% 831-423-0900; www.bookshopsantacruz.com),
allow access to theirs. According to one local we know, these are the
only toilets on the street open to the public. (A fantastic selection of
books is available as well.)
Marveling at the Mystery Spot
Okay, so you won’t exactly marvel at the Mystery Spot, 465 Mystery
Spot Rd. (% 831-423-8897; www.mysteryspot.com), but lovers of kitsch
will enjoy this funhouse in the woods. Ads tout it as a natural phenom-
enon where the accepted rules of gravity, perspective, compass, veloc-
ity, and height no longer exist (phooey on you, Newton!). It’s a real hoot
if you like silly stuff, and it’s open daily from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. in the
summer and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in the winter. The tour lasts only 35 min-
utes, but expect an hour-long wait in summer. Admission is $5. Just find-
ing the Mystery Spot can be a mystery: From Pacific Avenue, turn right
on Water Street and left on Market Street, which turns into Branciforte
Drive; follow the signs.
Taking a ride through the redwoods
Want a glimpse of California’s majestic redwoods and pioneering past,
but don’t have time to visit the North Coast or the Gold Country? Catch
a ride on the Roaring Camp Narrow Gauge Railroad (% 831-335-4484;
www.roaringcamprr.com), which takes riders aboard the nation’s last
steam-powered passenger railroad through the Santa Cruz Mountains 
on a 75-minute round-trip. Trips leave from Roaring Camp, a half-hour’s
drive from Santa Cruz, daily during the warmer months (weekends only
in winter). Rates are $18 adults, $12 kids 3 to 12. They also offer a beach-
to-redwoods round-trip for $20 adults, $15 kids.
A parsimonious friend of ours suggests parking on Highway 9 near the
entrance to Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park, then walking into the
park and through the little gate into Roaring Camp. You’ll save on park-
ing fees twice!
Adding some drama to the proceedings
The University of California at Santa Cruz has been home to a well-
regarded and popular summer Shakespeare Festival since 1975. The
season begins the second week of July and runs through the end of
August with weekend matinees and evening performances. Much of the
Part IV: The Central Coast 
238

festival takes place outdoors, and regulars bring blankets or cushions to
sit on, plus picnics to enjoy before the show. This isn’t a student-run
program — actors from all around the country vie for roles, and the
direction is often edgy and provocative. For information on the summer
season, ticket prices, and dates, check online at www.shakespeare
santacruz.org or call the box office Tuesday through Saturday after-
noons at % 831-459-2159.
Gathering More Information
Call the Santa Cruz County Conference and Visitors Council (% 800-
833-3494 or 831-425-1234) or point your Web browser to www.santa
cruzca.org. After you arrive, stop in at the friendly and helpful visitor
center at 1211 Ocean St., at Kennan Street.

Chapter 18
The Monterey Peninsula
In This Chapter
 Deciding when to visit — and where to stay, eat, and play
 Visiting maritime Monterey’s aquarium and other top attractions
 Hitting the links and seeing the sights in elite Pebble Beach
 Cozying up in romantic Carmel-by-the-Sea and the Carmel Valley
P
repare yourself for some of the most spectacular real estate you’ll
ever see when you visit this rocky, cypress-dotted stretch of
California coast. A mystical, foggy shoreline rich with natural beauty and
steeped in maritime history, it’s home to the largest marine sanctuary in
the continental United States, as well as some of the state’s most charm-
ing communities.
The Monterey Peninsula juts out into the ocean at the south end of
Monterey Bay. The bay is the deepest part of the ocean just off the North
American coast, twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. As a result, it
houses one of the most diverse collections of marine animals on the
planet. Sea lions, otters, pelicans, gulls, even whales are a major pres-
ence and set the tone for life here. (More than one hotel manager
reports that guests in ocean-facing rooms frequently call to complain
about the barking dogs that wake them in the predawn hours — to
which the manager explains that you can’t tell a sea lion to quiet down.)
The biggest draw on the peninsula is the town of Monterey, home to the
justifiably world-famous Monterey Bay Aquarium, one of the premier
attractions in the Golden State, and Cannery Row, the sardine-canning
center immortalized by John Steinbeck and since transformed into a
family-friendly tourist zone. The aquarium actually lies half in Monterey
and half in neighboring Pacific Grove, which we discuss in conjunction
with Monterey because the dividing line is unnecessary for our pur-
poses. From a base in either town, you can easily enjoy the charms and
attractions of both.
Sculpted out of the midsection of the peninsula is Pebble Beach, home
to some of the most beautiful woodlands, some of the priciest residen-
tial real estate, and the best championship golf resorts in the country. If
you’re looking for world-class greens, this is the place to be — but pack
that platinum card, because it doesn’t come cheap. You even have to

pay to tour this territory — $8.75 to be exact — along 17-Mile Drive, a
gorgeous private road that traverses hill and dale along a meandering
loop.
At the south end of the peninsula is Carmel-by-the-Sea, one of the sweet-
est little towns around, and home to one of California’s most stunning
beaches. This upscale haven exists to delight you even if you want to do
nothing more than eat, shop, and amble about the village. In fact, that’s
pretty much all there is to do here, but it’s a pleasant way to while away
the hours.
Timing Your Visit
The weather on the Monterey Peninsula is moderate year-round — the
average daily temperature along the coast varies only by about 12 degrees
throughout the calendar year, with average highs in the mid-60s and aver-
age lows in the low 50s. Fog can be a factor, consistently keeping the sum-
mers misty and gray, especially in the morning hours; in fact, you could
see more sunshine in January than in July. Don’t let fog-bound days keep
you away, however — the misty haze only adds to the Monterey mystique.
Still, the best time to visit is Indian summer, from August through October,
when days are sunniest and warmest. Jazz fans may want to plan their trip
around the Monterey Jazz Festival (% 831-373-3366; www.monterey
jazzfest.com), which takes over the town for a three-day weekend every
September.
Temperatures are appreciably warmer and days are sunnier inland.
Although most of the area’s prime destinations lie along the coast, if it’s
sun that you’re after, consider making Carmel Valley your headquarters.
You have to drive inland only 15 minutes or so for temps to climb well
into the 80s or 90s in July or August.
Expect hotel rates to peak in summer and on weekends. The good news
for off-season travelers: You just may end up with the best weather at
the lowest prices. The exception is late January and early February
during the celebrity pro/am golf tournament in Pebble Beach: Even the
pigeons have trouble finding accommodations at that time.
Take along a jacket, a sweater, and long pants, even if you’re visiting in
the height of summer. Shorts and T-shirts just won’t do. For the current
local forecast for the Monterey Peninsula, call % 831-656-1725.
Less than 5 miles separate Monterey on the north end from Carmel on
the south end, but this action-packed peninsula boasts lots of attrac-
tions. Exploring the area can easily fill five or six days. If your time is lim-
ited, two days is enough to examine Monterey thoroughly, but set aside
at least a half-day for the aquarium. Plan to spend a third day in Carmel
(you can enjoy a lovely stretch of the 17-Mile Drive on your way there),
lounging by the hotel pool or driving your way around a golf course.
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 241

Getting There
The Monterey Peninsula is just off Highway 1 (see the “The Monterey
Peninsula” map on p. 244), about 46 miles south of Santa Cruz, 122 miles
south of San Francisco, and 86 miles north of Hearst Castle.
 To get there from Santa Cruz: Take Highway 1 south for about an
hour; follow the exit signs into Monterey, or go another 3 miles
south to the Ocean Avenue exit to get to Carmel. (Watch for the
Ocean Avenue exit, because it doesn’t explicitly say “Carmel.”)
 To get there from San Francisco: Follow the route suggested in
Chapter 17 to Santa Cruz and pick up Highway 1 as described in the
preceding bullet.
 To get there from Cambria: Follow Highway 1 through Big Sur. This
spectacular drive is slow-going and can easily take a full day with
stops (see Chapter 19 for details).
You can fly into Monterey Peninsula Airport, located on Olmsted Road 
4 miles east of Monterey off Highway 68 (% 831-648-7000; www.
montereyairport.com). Serving the airport are
 American/American Eagle: % 800-433-7300; www.aa.com
 America West Express: % 800-235-9292; www.americawest.com
 Delta: % 800-221-1212; www.delta.com
 United: % 800-241-6522; www.ual.com
You can rent a car from one of the major national car-rental companies
located at the airport (see Chapter 7 for car-rental details).
You can also catch a ride with Yellow Cab/Carmel Taxi (% 831-646-
8294), which usually has cabs circling the airport; expect the fare into
Monterey to cost about $13.
Before you pay for a taxi, check with your hotel to find out whether it
offers a complimentary shuttle service.
Monterey and Pacific Grove
As the first capital of California (when the state was under Spanish 
rule) and the hub of West Coast nautical life, Monterey has a rich his-
tory. The Monterey State Historic Park and the nicely preserved down-
town boast beautifully restored Spanish adobes. Despite the dissolution
of the sardine-canning industry, the town still thrives on its maritime
past. Barely a day goes by without someone making a reference to the
city’s favorite literary light, novelist John Steinbeck.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
242

Don’t come expecting some bastion of historic high-mindedness, 
however — Monterey is quite comfortable maintaining its mass-market
appeal, thank you very much. In fact, some feel that the town fathers
have gone too far, succumbing to the worst impulses of tourism — 
witness campy Cannery Row and ultratacky Fisherman’s Wharf, they
say. It’s true — you have to wade through some touristy schlock in these
areas. But you can’t argue with the appeal of the wonderful aquarium
and that one-of-a-kind bay (be sure to get out on it if you can). And even
Cannery Row and the wharf are good for a brief bit of fun, as long as 
you take them with a grain of salt (or an ibuprofen). Beyond the prime
tourist zones, you’ll discover a genuine ocean community with beauti-
fully preserved architecture, stunning panoramic vistas, top-quality
restaurants, and more.
Gorgeous and peaceful Pacific Grove makes a better base if you’d rather
revel in the area’s natural wonders and don’t mind the short drive, bike
ride, or walk it takes to reach the main attractions. If convenience is
more important to you, or you want a more urban feel, book a room in
Monterey proper. But even if you stay in Pacific Grove, the distances
won’t be that much of a factor. The Pacific Grove lodgings and restau-
rants may seem out of the way, but the drive into Monterey along Ocean
View Boulevard is only around five minutes without traffic.
Orienting yourself and getting around
Monterey is divided into two main sightseeing areas:
 Downtown (centered on Alvarado Street) and adjacent Fisherman’s
Wharf, where you’ll also find Monterey State Historic Park
 The Cannery Row area (sometimes referred to as “New Monterey”),
where the aquarium is located
Cannery Row is roughly to the west/northwest of downtown and the
wharf; beyond Cannery Row is Pacific Grove, which is easily reachable
by bicycle and perfect for exploring on two wheels. The downtown–
Fisherman’s Wharf area and Cannery Row are both pedestrian-friendly,
but visitors will most likely need to drive, bike, or take public transport
between the two.
Parking can be somewhat difficult in Monterey’s tourist areas, so you
may want to park your car at your hotel when you arrive and leave it
there for the duration of your stay. (All the recommended hotels are cen-
trally located, making it easy to do just that.) If you do drive between
sites, your best bet is to park in one of the paid lots — there’s a big one
near the aquarium. If you choose to rely on metered spots, be sure to
have quarters on hand and pay attention to time.
If you visit between Memorial Day and Labor Day, use the Waterfront
Area Visitor Express (WAVE) shuttle to get around. The WAVE operates
buses between all the major tourist sites and hotel areas in Monterey

absolutely free — a particularly good bargain, considering what you
save on parking fees and headaches. For the latest information, contact
Monterey-Salinas Transit (% 831-899-2555), or visit www.mst.org.

Where to stay
You may want to try booking your room through a free reservations
service such as MontereyVisitorsGuide.com (% 888-655-3424; www.
monterey-reservations.com) or Resort 2 Me (% 800-757-5646; www.
resort2me.com). Because they’ve established relationships with local
hotels and inns, they may be able to negotiate a better rate for you than
if you call the hotel directly; your best bet is to compare. They can also
refer you to other reliable properties in the area if the choices in the sec-
tions that follow are full.
Most hotels require a two-night minimum on summer and holiday week-
ends. Count on an extra 10 percent in taxes added to your final hotel bill.
Always inquire about packages — which may include aquarium tickets
or other incentives — even at the cheapest motel.
Asilomar Conference Grounds
$$–$$$
Pacific Grove
Situated on 105 gorgeous oceanfront acres of pines and dunes, this Julia
Morgan–designed woodland conference center is open to individual book-
ings, and it’s a great bargain for families on a budget. Rustic but immacu-
lately kept stone-and-log lodges house plain guest rooms (private bathrooms,
but no phones or TVs), plus a great room for lounging. Facilities include a
heated pool, ping-pong, and billiards; a boardwalk leads to the beach and
tide pools. This is a wonderful outdoorsy, summer-camp-like retreat, with
Monterey’s attractions just minutes away. Cafeteria-style dining halls (prix-
fixe lunch $8.75, dinner $14) mean you save on meals, too.

Best Western Victorian Inn
$$$–$$$$$
Monterey
This nice motel is just 2 blocks from Cannery Row. Don’t let the Victorian
theme fool you; the office is housed in a period home, but guest rooms are
in a modern annex. Still, they’re pleasant and feature such extras as marble
fireplaces, minibars, coffeemakers, and VCRs, but no air-conditioning. Rack
rates are way too high, but snagging a better rate through Best Western is

pretty easy. Book a concierge-level room if you can, which adds cathedral
ceilings, featherbeds, a whirlpool tub, CD player, and robes to the mix.

Grand View Inn/Seven Gables Inn
$$$–$$$$$
Pacific Grove
These gorgeous sister inns are two of the most spectacular we’ve ever
seen — and they’re ideally located to boot, along the stunning coast road
and situated so that just about every room has an ocean view. The
Edwardian style of the 1910 Grand View is somewhat subtler than the
Seven Gables’s more elaborate 1886 Victorian, but it’s really a matter of
taste. Everything is impeccable, from the marble baths to the faultless
service. Romance-seeking couples simply can’t do better. Book well ahead,
especially for weekends.

The Monterey Hotel
$$–$$$
Monterey
This charming Victorian hotel is beautifully located in the retail heart of
downtown Monterey, an easy walk to Fisherman’s Wharf. Opened in 1904,
it has been impeccably restored, with beveled-glass details and mahogany
polished to a high sheen. The smallish but lovely period rooms are el-
egantly and comfortably furnished, and have posh marble-tiled bathrooms.
For the most space, book a double-double (two double beds or two queen
beds) or a junior suite, which could serve a small family nicely. The staff
is attentive and helpful. Note: The hotel has no working elevator (although
that is supposed to change), but valet service is available. Plans are under-
way (but no firm dates yet) to add a few rooms, so inquire about any con-
struction work when you phone to book.

Monterey Plaza Hotel & Spa
$$$–$$$$$
Monterey
Monterey’s finest waterfront hotel is dramatically situated to maximize the
lovely bay views, and although it’s next door to Cannery Row, it feels
worlds away. Elegant teak-paneled public areas lead to spacious, extremely
comfy guest rooms with big marble bathrooms and all the little luxuries.
Go oceanview if you can, but even guests in the cheapest inland-view

The Olympia Lodge
$–$$$
Pacific Grove
A low-budget fixture since the 1960s, this humble two-story motel is under
new management and in the middle of a serious renovation. The rooms
have been modernized with wonderfully comfortable beds, plantation
shutters, coffeemakers, and sizable TVs; although the bathrooms are in
decent shape, they, too, are being updated with new tile and whirlpool
tubs. Sometime in 2007, the lodge may even have a larger swimming pool,
a new deck, and a hot tub. The improvements will bring an increase in the
rates (although you can get a good deal in the off season), but until then
this is a hidden gem.

Rosedale Inn
$$–$$$
Pacific Grove
Here’s our favorite among Pacific Grove’s sweet cottage-style motels. The
lodgelike complex is actually much nicer than a motel. All the large rooms
are beautifully done in a comfy country style and feature cathedral ceil-
ings (with ceiling fans), VCRs, fireplaces, kitchenettes with microwaves
and minifridges, and whirlpool tubs and hair dryers in the nice bathrooms.
About half are two-room suites, each of which also has a sleeper sofa in
the living room — perfect for families. Management is super-friendly, too.
This place is a winner.

Spindrift Inn
$$$–$$$$$
Monterey
If the Monterey Plaza Hotel is too swanked-out for your tastes, but you’d
like a bay view with your breakfast, this smaller boutique property in the
center of Cannery Row is another choice. Charming, well-appointed, and
spacious rooms with fireplaces, hardwood floors, feather beds, marble
bathrooms, and stunning ocean vistas provide a cushy shelter, but pony
up for a bayview room — with a disco on the street side, nights can be
noisy.

Where to dine
Despite the kitsch that Monterey offers as an attraction destination, the
area serves up some fine fixin’s in its kitchens, some renowned even in
the restaurant-sophisticated Bay Area.
The Fishwife at Asilomar Beach
$$
Pacific Grove
SEAFOOD
This hugely popular fish house serves up affordable, filling meals in a
simple, oceanview room that bustles with a chatty mix of tourists and
locals. The seafood — which can be fresh but is often frozen — comes
grilled or golden-fried, with black beans, rice, and a choice of salsas. The
lunch menu features sandwiches, too, as well as steak and nonseafood
pastas. Make reservations, but be prepared to wait a few minutes nonethe-
less. The Fishwife is a busy place.

Isabella’s
$$$–$$$$
Monterey
ITALIAN/SEAFOOD
We had to be pushed into this Wharf fish house by a hungry companion
who didn’t share our disdain for the gentleman at the door, who was
heartily attempting to convince passersby that this was the place to eat.
Much to our surprise, we ended up agreeing with the guy. The fresh fish
was sustainably caught and simply prepared as requested; the calamari
and coconut shrimp appetizer was filling enough to serve as a main. The
harbor views in the early evening added ambience. Most beasts, fish, and
fowl show up on the huge menu in addition to lots of pasta, so the fussi-
est eater will find something to his liking. Service is attentive, but don’t
plan on lingering at your table after you finish your coffee.

One of the more stylish restaurants in town, Montrio is actually a blend of
sizzle and substance that works for couples as well as for families seeking
a good meal in grown-up surroundings. The menu, incorporating organic
produce when available, includes a hamburger and a turkey sandwich for

casual eaters, and raises the bar with crab cakes, rare steaks, or oven-
roasted portobello mushrooms for more serious diners. Our paper-topped
table included crayons, always a nice touch for busy hands.

Passionfish

Pacific Grove
CREATIVE AMERICAN
Easily one of the best restaurants in the area, dinner here is worth the
short drive if you’re bunking in Monterey. The daily changing menu is inno-
vative yet accessible; seafood lovers should investigate the grilled shrimp
or the Passionfish stew, which may feature mussels, swordfish, salmon,
and bright green spinach gnocchi in a butternut squash broth — beautiful
to behold and a joy to eat. The wine list cuts a swath through California
and beyond, service is subtle, and the crowd enjoys every bite.

Robert’s The White House
$$$
Pacific Grove
CALIFORNIA/FRENCH
Set inside a historic Victorian mansion on Pacific Grove’s main drag, Chef
Robert Kincaid provides diners with delicious food in a pretty and quaint
setting. We don’t know how he does it, but $37 buys a three-course meal
suitable for a special occasion. We skipped the appetizers (because we
prefer dessert) and chose the baked onion soup and organic field greens
gussied up with roasted beets, candied pecans, and blue cheese, both sat-
isfying. Mains were especially superb. Herb-encrusted slices of rare ahi
tuna had us talking to ourselves for days; the duck confit was crisp and
tender. A chocolate “bag” filled with a chocolate-cream milkshake sent us
away in a haze of caloric contentment. Service is a bit spotty, but the over-
all experience is a delight.

If dessert is your downfall, you can’t fall much farther than a slice from the
triple-layer cakes in the glass counter near the entrance of this cheery
downtown restaurant. Rosine’s is the place to satisfy morning and midday
cravings, with dishes to keep the entire family chewing happily. Breakfast
is straightforward and filling with eggs, bacon, pancakes, and oatmeal;
lunch consists of sandwiches and salads and, of course, slices of cake.

Sea Harvest Fish Market & Restaurants

Monterey
SEAFOOD
This friendly place, where the chef from the Post Ranch Inn (see Chap-
ter 19) does his shopping, is a fish market first and a restaurant second —
which means that you can pick your filet right out of the case. It’s grilled
or fried on the spot, and served along with soup or salad at one of the
casual tables. Fish simply doesn’t come more off-the-boat fresh. The
kitchen prepares delicious homemade Louis dressing and stellar chowder,
too. Perfect if you’d rather avoid the Cannery Row tourist traps in favor of
an authentic local meal.

CALIFORNIA/MEDITERRANEAN
This attractive historic adobe gets major points for its Southwest-style
charm and constant raves for its contemporary fare. The main dining room
buzzes with energy and flair, while Chef Brandon Miller makes the most of
the local bounty in his innovative but unfussy cuisine. The San Francisco
Chronicle calls it “possibly the best food on the Monterey Peninsula.” The
restaurant is simply wonderful in every way.

Zócalo
$
Pacific Grove
MEXICAN
We ate some pedestrian Mexican food in a well-known downtown Monterey
taqueria and were so peeved that we made it our mission to find the real
thing. On a tip from a cute chef whom we chatted up at Sea Harvest Market,
we ended up in a little storefront cafe off the main drag in Pacific Grove.
Zócalo offers every favorite — tostados, tacos, burritos, enchiladas — as
well as pozole (pork and hominy stew), which perks us up whenever we see
it on a menu. They also serve beer, wine, and a refreshing horchata, a sweet
rice drink that goes deliciously well with spicy food. Every meal out of that
kitchen is composed of really fresh ingredients, far and away superior to
what’s sold in downtown Monterey. After you eat, walk around the center
of Pacific Grove, an old-fashioned downtown with a patina of sophistication.

Monterey’s top attractions
Well, as long as you’re here anyway, you have no reason not to find out
what all the fuss is about. If you’re a connoisseur of the tacky and the
tasteless, more power to you and enjoy your visit. If you’re not, you can
at least enjoy a good chuckle at the schlock on public display.
Cannery Row
Immortalized on the page by John Steinbeck, this former aromatic row of
working sardine canneries is now a temple to the tourist dollar, rife with
mass-appeal shopping, dining, and nightlife. The fish that fed the local 
sardine-canning industry — the largest in the world, processing 250,000
tons in 1945, the year Steinbeck’s Cannery Row hit bookshelves — disap-
peared in the late 1940s from overfishing of the bay. Complaining about
what replaced the canneries is easy (and believe us, locals do), but even
Steinbeck found it to be an improvement over what was. In the ’60s he
wrote, “The beaches are clean where they once festered with fish guts and
flies. The canneries that once put up a sickening stench are gone, their
places filled with restaurants, antique[s] shops, and the like.”
Stay away if you’re averse to this kind of commercialism. But if you’re not,
you’ll find that the T-shirt shops and theme restaurants haven’t entirely
quashed the row’s maritime character. It’s a nice renovation, and recent
years have brought in a better quality of merchant to supplant some of the
cheesier businesses. Highlights include A Taste of Monterey Wine Tasting
Center (see the “Tasting the local grape” section later in the chapter), and
the Ghirardelli Chocolate Shop and Soda Fountain, in Steinbeck Plaza,
660 Cannery Row (% 831-373-0997), where you can indulge your sweet
tooth San Francisco–style.
Just off the Pacific Grove end of the row, on Ocean View Boulevard, is the
American Tin Cannery Premium Outlets (% 831-372-1442), which
boasts such big names as Reebok and Nine West among its 40 or so stores.
Just off the other (Monterey) end is the Cannery Row Antique Mall, 471
Wave St. (% 831-655-0264), housing two levels of antiques and collectibles
dealers.
What’s probably the world’s finest walking/biking path parallels the row,
connecting up with it at a couple of points; for details, see the “More cool
stuff to see and do” section later in this chapter.

Fisherman’s Wharf

Wharf will be. Larger and more commercial than Santa Cruz’s wharf and
Part IV: The Central Coast 
252

just as touristy as San Francisco’s, this wooden pier is packed with T-shirt
shops, seafood restaurants, and bay-cruise and sport-fishing operations out
to snare a tourist buck or two. That said, it’s still worth a look, primarily
because the bay views are to die for, and this is one of the best perches for
watching the frolicking seals and barking sea lions that populate the bay.
If the weather’s good, buy a chowder-filled sourdough-bread bowl and park
yourself along the pier to watch the offshore action. If it’s not, find a bay-
front seat at one of the pier’s seafood restaurants; the best of the bunch is
Italian-accented Isabella’s (see the “Where to dine” section earlier in this
chapter).
If you’re the plan-ahead type who’d like to hit the water for some sport-
fishing or whale-watching, contact the following operators.
Monterey Bay Whale Watch, 84 Fisherman’s Wharf (% 831-375-4658; www.
montereybaywhalecruise.com), offers daily year-round whale-watching
cruises. Be aware, however, that you’ll spot only the big’uns — California
gray whales — from December through March. Trips run $34 to $43 for
adults and $23 to $33 for children 4 to 12.
Chris’ Fishing Trips, 48 Fisherman’s Wharf (% 831-375-5951; www.chriss
fishing.com), has four large (51- to 70-ft.) boats leaving on daily deep-
sea hunts; cod and salmon are the main catches. Full-day trips run $55 for
adults and $25 (weekdays) or $30 (weekends) for children.
If you’d rather watch the pros haul in their daily catches, head over to
wharf no. 2 (just next door to Chris’, at the end of Figueroa Street), which
is today’s working commercial pier. To wiggle your toes in the chilly surf,
head a bit farther east to Monterey Bay Park, where the big white-sand
beach gradually slopes into sandy shallows that are just warm enough.

Monterey Bay Aquarium
One of the best, largest, and most enjoyable aquariums on the planet, the
Monterey Bay Aquarium sits on the shore of one of the most spectacular
marine habitats in the world. It’s terrific for all ages, with gliding bat rays
and other sea creatures to touch, instructive shows throughout the day
(some featuring friendly, spotlight-savvy sea lions), interactive exhibits,
and well-written placards at every display that even younger children can
understand and enjoy. Exhibits tie in closely to the immediate surround-
ings, bringing home the reality of the marine environment and the mes-
sage of conservation.
Have we mentioned how jaw-droppingly awesome this aquarium is? It dis-
plays more than 300,000 sea plants and animals representing 570 different
species. At the heart of the loftlike, indoor/outdoor complex is a three-
story tank replicating a kelp forest, which you can walk around up a spiral
ramp, viewing the leopard sharks and bay fish from all sides.
Better yet is the Outer Bay exhibit, featuring inhabitants of the open ocean
in a phenomenal million-gallon tank with the largest window on Earth.
Almost cooler than the giant green sea turtles, schools of sharp-toothed
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 253

barracuda, and the threatening-looking sharks are the jellyfish, which
move in slo-mo, translucent unison like a modern-art exhibit come to life.
The aquarium regularly mounts new exhibits, but, unlike art shows, they
stay a while. Opening in April 2007 is a special exhibit on river otters of the
world, featuring live Asian and African small- and short-clawed otters com-
muning with tree frogs, vine snakes, and other species from their natural
habitat. Little kids will be irresistibly drawn into the Splash Zone, a perma-
nent hands-on exhibition that combines live-animal displays (including tux-
edoed penguins) with staff-led learning programs and good old-fashioned
play areas.

Aquarium timesavers
The ticket lines just to get into the Monterey Bay Aquarium can be a nightmare, espe-
cially in summer. Even on a Tuesday people may wait 15 to 30 minutes throughout the
day. Do yourself a favor: Avoid the lines at the gate by arranging for admission tickets
in advance.
Many of Monterey’s hotels offer packages that include aquarium tickets. Even if you
just book a straight daily rate, call ahead and ask the front desk if they sell advance
tickets; most do. If your hotel doesn’t sell aquarium tickets, you can order them directly
from the aquarium by calling % 800-756-3737 or 831-648-4937; the flat $3-per-order
service charge is well worth the time saved. Don’t worry about mailing time; the tickets
can be left at will-call, where you’ll never encounter a wait.
Here are some tips to help you make the most of your aquarium visit:
 Allow a minimum of three hours to see the aquarium; budget four or five if you
want to see everything.
 You’re allowed to leave and come back in the same day, as long as you get your
hand stamped. We highly suggest leaving for lunch or a rest, which will give you
a break from the ever-present crowds and rejuvenate you for more looking.
 Review the “Today at the Aquarium” schedule as soon as you arrive, so that you
can budget your touring around any live programs you’d like to see (they usually
last 15–30 minutes).
 If time is limited, head straight for the Outer Bay, followed by a visit to the two-
story Sea Otter exhibit, and then a walk along the Habitats Path to the Touch Pool
for maximum satisfaction.

Monterey State Historic Park
At the gateway to Fisherman’s Wharf sit a dozen or so beautifully restored
historic adobes that served as California’s capitol under Spanish, Mexican,
and initial U.S. rule. The state now collectively protects these buildings as
Monterey State Historic Park. Even if you’re not a big history buff, check
out this area simply for the beauty of the buildings and the setting. You
can tour it in a number of ways.
Do-it-yourselfers who just want to explore a bit can stop into the Visitor
Center at the Maritime Museum and pick up the free Path of History map.
The map will lead you through the historic park and adjacent Old
Monterey (the beautifully restored downtown area), highlighting buildings
of note along the way. You won’t be able to enter the buildings, but the
exteriors alone are worth a look.
If you’d like a little more background, go the guided-tour route. A number
of tours are offered daily; call % 831-657-6348 for a schedule. We recom-
mend starting with the introductory walking tour, which provides a gen-
eral exterior overview. Follow that with a house tour or two (or a garden
tour, if you’re visiting between May and Sept) of the buildings that caught
your fancy in the course of your initial tour. Highlights include the Cooper-
Molera Adobe, which depicts family life in the mid-1800s with living-history
demonstrations throughout the 3-acre complex, and the Larkin House,
generally considered to be the finest example of Monterey Colonial archi-
tecture still standing.
You can also explore the nearby Maritime Museum of Monterey, 5 Custom
House Plaza, at the end of Alvarado Street (% 831-372-2608; www.
montereyhistory.org/maritime_museum.htm), which tells the story of
Monterey’s seafaring past, from the Spanish conquistadors through the
sardine fishers. Admission is $8 adults, $5 seniors, $2.50 teens 12 to 18,
free for kids 12 and younger.

More cool stuff to see and do
Don’t miss the Monterey Peninsula Recreation Trail, one of the most
scenic walking paths in the country. And the good news is that you don’t
have to hoof it; bikers and in-line skaters are welcome, too. You can pick
up the paved path anywhere along Monterey’s coastline and follow it
into Pacific Grove all the way to Asilomar Beach.
Past the aquarium, in Pacific Grove, you’ll ride along the beach side of
Ocean View Boulevard. If you look inland, you can admire the gorgeous
ocean-facing homes (including some stunning Victorians); on the bay
side, gorgeous purple heather and the occasional gnarled cypress sepa-
rates you from the frolicking sea lions and colorful kayaks gliding along
the water.
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 255

Go at least as far as Lovers Point Park (where Ocean View meets Pacific
Avenue in Pacific Grove), a gorgeous grassy point that juts out to sea.
With a sheltered beach and tables for picnickers, it’s the perfect place 
to take a load off and relax. From here, push on around the curve, where
the road becomes Sunset Drive, and take it past picturesque Point Pinos
Lighthouse (the oldest continually operating lighthouse in the West,
since 1854) to undeveloped Asilomar State Beach, where you can spend
a quiet day among the dunes, tidal pools, and barking sea lions. Hardy
folks can continue along the 17-Mile Drive; you’ll find a gate on Sunset
Drive just past Asilomar Avenue, and bicyclists can enter for free. (For
more on the 17-Mile Drive, see the “Cruising the 17-Mile Drive,” section,
later in this chapter.)
Rent your bike or skates from Adventures by the Sea (www.adventures
bythesea.com), which has a few convenient locations: 299 Cannery Row,
across from the Monterey Plaza Hotel (% 831-372-1807); 201 Alvarado
Mall, next to the Maritime Museum (% 831-372-1807 or 831-648-7236);
and at Lovers Point Park in Pacific Grove (summer only; no phone). Bikes
cost $6 an hour, $18 for four hours, or $24 per day; locks and helmets are
provided. Skates are $12 for two hours or $24 for the day, with all safety
equipment included. Service is very friendly, and gear is in good condi-
tion. Advance reservations are gladly accepted.
Kayaking the bay
Monterey Bay is a great place to kayak in summer, even for beginners.
You’ll glide right by sunbathing sea lions and snacking sea otters as
shorebirds swoop through the air and schools of jellyfish skirt just
below the surface of the water. (A kayaking companion once called it 
“a horror movie in the making,” but the gooey creatures are simply 
mesmerizing.)
Again, contact Adventures by the Sea (see the preceding section for
locations and contact information). Kayaks cost $30 per person for the
day, including waterproof gear and instruction to get you started. The
bay is glassy enough for fearless novices to set out on their own in
summer, but we highly recommend booking a tour if you’re the least bit
nervous, or if the surf is kicking up. The cost is $50 per person for a two-
hour tour, and you should reserve ahead.
Exploring the underwater world
If you’re an experienced scuba diver, pack your certification card — 
this national marine sanctuary is a dive you shouldn’t miss. Contact
Monterey Bay Dive Center, 225 Cannery Row (% 800-60-SCUBA or
831-656-0454; www.montereyscubadiving.com), a PADI dive center that
can arrange guided dives with pro dive masters. Call at least 48 hours in
advance to schedule your dive, sooner if possible. The office is closed
on Wednesdays.

Cooking by the bay
The Culinary Center of Monterey, 625 Cannery Row (% 831-333-2133;
www.culinarycenterofmonterey.com), encompasses nearly every-
thing food lovers could wish for, including weekend hands-on cooking
classes for adults and kids, a wine bar, retail kitchenware and cook-
books, a restaurant and gourmet take-out, all located in a bay-front
building with those stunning only-in-Monterey views from the patio. The
lengthy roster of classes covers everything from sauces to desserts
including an intriguing offering called “Cooking with Beer.” Classes run
about four hours and include copious tastings so that you don’t faint
from exertion. Even if you don’t cook on vacation, it’s fun to browse the
retail area and then sit at the bar with a glass of wine and a snack.
Closed Mondays.
Tasting the local grape
Monterey’s Wine Country has really grown up in recent years, becoming
California’s third most prominent wine-growing region, behind Napa and
Sonoma (even the New York Times has called it “The Next Napa”). Go
ahead, review the shelves at your local wine store or the next wine list
you’re handed. The number of Monterey labels there may surprise you,
as will the number of Monterey County winery names you know: Morgan,
Estancia, Jekel, Talbott, J. Lohr, Smith & Hook, Chalone, and many others.
Local vintners tend to specialize in chardonnay, pinot noir, and cabernet
sauvignon — all popular grapes that are suited to the region’s A-1 soil
and growing conditions — and they’re making some of the best wines
that the California Wine Country has to offer.
For a free map to the region’s wineries, the Monterey Wine Country Wine-
Tasting Guide, stop by A Taste of Monterey, the Monterey County Wine
and Produce Visitors Center, upstairs at 700 Cannery Row, next to the
Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. (% 888-646-5446 or 831-646-5446; www.taste
monterey.com; open daily 11 a.m.–6 p.m.). This bayfront tasting room is
a serious wine-tasting center and a great place to learn about, try, and
buy local wines — ideal for one-stop shoppers. If you want to wend your
way through the local vineyards and tasting rooms in person, ask the
friendly staff for tips on where to go.
The map is also available at local visitor centers (see the “Gathering
More Information” section at the end of this chapter).
You can arrange your Wine Country tour in advance by going online to 
the useful Web site run by the Monterey County Vintners & Growers
Association at www.montereywines.org. Here you can preview the winer-
ies you’d like to visit and order a free copy of the aforementioned wine-
tasting guide (or order an advance copy by calling % 831-375-9400).
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 257

Side-tripping to the National Steinbeck Center
The National Steinbeck Center is an easy 20-mile drive northeast from
Monterey, at 1 Main St. in Salinas (% 831-796-3833; www.steinbeck.
org). The state-of-the-art museum is well worth a visit if you’re a fan of
the county’s most beloved author, John Steinbeck (author of Cannery
Row, East of Eden, Of Mice and Men, and The Grapes of Wrath, among
others).
Even if you’re not a literary buff but you’re simply interested in the 
history of the region, you’ll find the tour engaging, because many of
Steinbeck’s works were rooted in the local culture. The tour also appeals
to film fans, because the multimedia approach makes prime use of the
many first-rate, star-studded films that were crafted from Steinbeck’s
stories.
The museum is deliberately designed to be multisensory, and it largely
succeeds. In the Agricultural Wing, which almost too playfully lays out
how your artichokes get from field to kitchen, kids may scorn voting for
their favorite vegetable, but taken as a whole, there’s much to be learned
on the subject. You can easily make your way through the museum in an
hour or two; the kids will have enough to keep them busy. The center is
open daily (except for major holidays) from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission
is $11 adults, $8.95 students and seniors, $7.95 kids 13 to 17, $6.95 kids 6
to 12. To get there from Monterey, take Highway 68 east, which will lead
you right through Old Town Salinas to the center (the biggest, brightest
building in town — you can’t miss it).
Strolling and shopping Old Monterey
Monterey’s charmingly restored downtown, inland from Fisherman’s
Wharf and centered on Alvarado Street, is well worth exploring. History
and architecture fans should pick up the Path of History Walking Tour
(see the section on the Monterey State Historic Park earlier in this chap-
ter), while shoppers should just hit the streets.
Tuesdays, Alvarado Street is blocked off from about 2 to 8 p.m. for the
weekly farmers’ market. The local fruits and vegetables are desirable, if
somewhat impractical to pack, but vendors also hawk tie-dyed T’s, hand-
made soaps, candles, olive oil, and such. Delicious-smelling barbecued
ribs, chicken, and other snacking opportunities also tempt the senses.
Wintering with the monarch butterflies in Pacific Grove
Pacific Grove is also known as “Butterfly Town, USA.” Why, you ask?
Because monarch butterflies, it seems, know a good thing when they see
it. Thousands of brilliant black-and-orange monarch butterflies converge
on the town annually in October or early November, and stay until
February or March. The best place to see them is in the Monarch Grove
Sanctuary, between Grove Acre Avenue, Ridge Road, and Lighthouse
Avenue (% 888-PG-MONARCH or 831-375-0982; www.ci.pg.ca.us/
monarchs/default.htm), where they alight in the eucalyptus trees.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
258

Tour guides are usually on hand on the weekends in season to answer
questions about the fluttering beauties.
You can also peruse a detailed display on the winged winter visitors 
at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History, 165 Forest Ave., at
Central Avenue (% 831-648-3116; www.pgmuseum.org). It’s open
Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and admission is free.
Leave your nets at home, collectors — the fine for harassing a butterfly
in Pacific Grove is $1,000.
Playing with Dennis the Menace
Families with kids should definitely budget a couple of hours to run 
and jump at the Dennis the Menace Playground (% 831-646-3866), at
Camino El Estero and Fremont Street, just east of downtown Monterey.
Designed by Dennis creator (and Pacific Grove homeboy) Hank Ketcham,
the way-cool playground boasts an old steam train to climb on, more 
colorful jungle gyms than we could count, rope-and-plank suspension
bridges, a giant swing ride, and lots more low-tech, old-fashioned fun. It’s
open daily 10 a.m. to dusk (closed nonholiday Mondays in the winter);
admission is free.
Pebble Beach: Nirvana for Golfers
Carved out of the middle of the peninsula is a whole different kind of
world, Pebble Beach, where platinum cards and nine-irons rule the day.
Rolling championship fairways, lush woodlands, and magnificent vistas
are broken only by million-dollar homes and a few ultraluxury resorts
that cater to a big-money, high-profile crowd. In golf terms, this is the 
big time — Pebble Beach is home to some of the most famous golf
courses in the world. It hosts the star-studded annual AT&T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am, which has paired club-swinging celebs with
PGA Tour stars annually (late Jan or early Feb) since 1937, and has
played host to multiple U.S. Open Championships throughout the years
(including 2000).
If you need to chat with your banker before making reservations in
Pebble Beach, you probably can’t afford to stay here. Even if you can, but
you’re the jeans-and-T-shirt type, Pebble Beach may not be for you. But
you don’t have to sleep over — or buy into the big-budget golf life — to
enjoy the marvelous scenery. Everybody can — for a nominal fee — tour
this spectacular territory along the 17-Mile Drive (see the “Cruising the
17-Mile Drive” section later in this chapter), a gorgeous private loop road.
If you don’t want to stay but do want to play a round of unparalleled
golf, you can do that, too — with a little effort and luck.

Where to stay and play at the resorts
The Pebble Beach Company (% 800-654-9300; www.pebblebeach.com)
runs all the Pebble Beach resorts, making price-shopping and comparing
amenities easy. Always ask about packages that may include greens fees
in the price. And always check with a travel agent, who may be able to
get a better package price at these superluxury resorts than you can get
on your own.
Guests at any of the Pebble Beach resorts get preferred service at all of
Pebble Beach’s facilities; facilities are accessible to nonguests on a more
limited basis. (Read: The high-paying resort guests get first dibs.) See
the “Hitting the links” section, later in this chapter, for details on the
world-class golf courses, with information on greens fees and tee-time
availability for resort guests and nonguests.
Book your tee times at the same time that you reserve your room, about
a year ahead of schedule.
Of course, you’ll be needing a nice body scrub after all that golf, and you
can get one at the 22,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style Spa, next to
Casa Palmero; call % 888-565-7615 or 831-649-7615.

Pebble Beach
One of the few resorts to hold Mobil’s highly coveted five stars — and a
winner of the Travel + Leisure’s 2006 Top 500 Hotels in the World poll —
Spanish Bay is a wonderful choice if you like big resorts. Rooms are large
and done in a super-luxurious contemporary style. We’d choose this one
over the Lodge at Pebble Beach (see the following listing) for its winning
facilities and its location in the heart of the gorgeous Scottish-style Links
at Spanish Bay. Still, it’s hard to go wrong at either property.

Pebble Beach
The Lodge is somewhat more stately and formal than its sister resort at

amenity-laden, utterly luxurious guest rooms are scattered throughout the
glorious oceanfront property — most convenient for golfers set on teeing
off on the legendary Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Cruising the 17-Mile Drive
The only private toll road west of the Mississippi, the stunning 17-Mile
Drive is well worth the $8.75 per auto price of admission.
Bicyclists can enter for free; see the “More cool stuff to see and do” sec-
tion earlier in the chapter, for details on renting bikes. The ride is easy —
mainly downhill — toward Carmel, but average folks may find it a real
chore to make the uphill climb back. If you’re not a long-distance biker,
either stick to the Pacific Grove portion of the drive or arrange for a
pickup at the Lodge at Pebble Beach or in Carmel.
The spectacular loop wends through the Monterey Peninsula, linking
Pacific Grove to the outskirts of Carmel along the coast, turns inland,
hitching up with the main highway for a moment, and then heads back
toward Pacific Grove through the Del Monte Forest. It takes you along
the stunning rocky coastline, past the most beautiful cypress trees on
the peninsula, and through unspoiled woodlands. (The gnarled, wind-
bent cypress trees that lend the peninsula such a distinct beauty are
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 261
Leisurely dining along the 17-Mile Drive
If you’re not staying in Pebble Beach but you’d like to enjoy an elegant breakfast, lunch,
or dinner here (and maybe a glimpse of a luxe resort in the process), book a table at
Roy’s at Pebble Beach ($28–$38 entrees), at the Inn at Spanish Bay (% 831-647-7423).
Roy’s is the best of Hawaii celebrity Chef Roy Yamaguchi’s mainland restaurants.
Expect well-prepared Euro-Asian cuisine with inspired sauces and pleasing California
and island twists. Entrees are pricey, but keeping the bill down is easy if you make a
meal of Roy’s signature wood-fired pizzas or choose from the extensive appetizers list;
don’t miss those killer short ribs (better than dessert!).
If you’d rather put together a picnic to enjoy along the drive, stop into the Pebble Beach
Market (% 831-622-8770), a gourmet deli at the Lodge at Pebble Beach, which has a
lawn where you can spread out and enjoy your ready-to-eat meats, veggies, cheeses,
and other gourmet goodies.

native to this region only; they can live to be 4,000 years old.) You’ll see
championship golfers and native deer cohabiting on some of the most
scenic golf greens in the world, and watch sea lions and harbor seals
bark and cavort in the whitecaps just offshore. The only buildings you’ll
see are massive — and we do mean massive — luxury homes tucked dis-
creetly among the trees, and three world-class resorts, should you wish
to seek them out (see the preceding section).
You can enter the drive through five different gates, paying your fee in
exchange for a handy-dandy full-color map and brochure of the high-
lights along the route. You’re likely to use one of these three gates:
 From Monterey or Pacific Grove, the most convenient gate is the
Pacific Grove Gate. Follow Ocean View Boulevard from Monterey
to Sunset Drive; after the road turns inland, you’ll soon see 17-Mile
Drive on your right.
 From Carmel, enter at the Carmel Gate; from downtown, turn right
off Ocean Avenue onto San Antonio Avenue (1 block before the
beach).
 If you’re just passing by the peninsula and want to take a gander at
this remarkable real estate, enter at the Highway 1 Gate, just off
the main road at the Holman Highway exit.
Allot a leisurely afternoon for the drive. If you don’t have a few hours 
to spare, you can see part of the route by using it to travel between
Monterey and Carmel (or vice-versa). The disadvantage of this plan is
that you have to choose between coastal and inland portions; we say go
coastal, but it all depends on your aesthetic sensibilities.
The map features about 20 points of interest, and you can use pullouts
at scenic points all along the drive. If you’d rather avoid a lot of stop and
go, focus on these natural highlights:
 Point Joe, on the northern end of the coast, which offers a gor-
geous vantage for spotting migrating whales between December
and March.
 About midway down the coast are Seal Rock and Bird Rock, where
you can spot countless gulls, cormorants, and other offshore birds,
plus harbor seals and sea lions, gathering just offshore.
 Fanshell Overlook offers awesome views of Fanshell Beach, where
harbor seals gather to birth their pups each spring.
 Cypress Point Lookout offers the drive’s most spectacular coastal
view and is ideal for sunset collectors.
 A little farther down the coast is the famous Lone Cypress, one of
the peninsula’s most distinctive and mesmerizing images. The mag-
nificently gnarled, windblown tree looks as if it’s growing right out
of bare rock, but its insistent roots have actually burrowed deep

through the rock’s crevices. You’re not allowed up close, but the
view from the deck beside the parking area is magnificent.
You can see the best forest-and-ocean panorama from Huckleberry
Hill, along the inland curve a little bit north of the Highway 1 Gate,
which is the highest point along the drive.
Hitting the links
We won’t lie to you — getting a tee time on one of the prime Pebble
Beach courses without booking a room at one of the resorts is nearly
impossible, even in the off-season (Nov–Mar). But try if you must.
Pebble Beach Golf Links, the Links at Spanish Bay, Spyglass Hill Golf
Course, all on the 17-Mile Drive, and Del Monte Golf Course, in Monterey,
are all administered by the Pebble Beach Company (% 800-654-9300;
www.pebblebeach.com). If you’d like to book a lesson, call the Pebble
Beach Golf Academy (% 831-622-8650), home to Laird Small, one of Golf
Digest’s Top 50 Teachers in America for 2003/04 and 2005/06.
 Pebble Beach Golf Links, at the Lodge at Pebble Beach, is the Big
Kahuna of Pebble Beach golf courses. A links legend since 1919,
this par-72, 6,719-yard rolling oceanfront beauty regularly ranks
among the top five courses in the world, and many of golf’s biggest
names have called it the finest course they’ve ever played. This is a
mature course with old-root trees and massive bunkers, at one with
the land like few courses on Earth.
Unless you’re willing to foot the bill for a Pebble Beach hotel room,
don’t get your heart set on playing here — though nonguests can
book tee times just a day in advance, which means you have to get
very lucky and catch a last-minute cancellation (nearly impossible).
And expect to pay to play, big time: Greens fees are $450 for resort
guests including a cart; they’re the same for nonguests, but
nonguests have to pay extra ($25) for a cart.
 Spyglass Hill Golf Course, at Stevenson Drive and Spyglass Hill
Road in Pebble Beach, Robert Trent Jones, Sr.’s, par-72, 6,862-yard
legend is one of the toughest golf courses in the world. Expect to
test your skills — and every club in your bag — if you get to play
here. Greens fees are $300 for guests including cart and the same
for nonguests not including cart (an extra $25). Nonguests can
book tee times up to a month in advance for this course — easier
to get on than Pebble Beach, but still tough. (Even winter tee times
book up a month in advance.)
Your best bets for garnering available tee times are the Del Monte Golf
Course and the Links at Spanish Bay, where nonguests can book up to
two months in advance. You should call as early as possible, even mark-
ing your calendar to dial at the two-month and one-month mark. If that
fails, just call back and try to snag a cancellation.
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 263

 Del Monte Golf Course, at the Hyatt on Sylvan Road and Highway 1
in Monterey, is the oldest course west of the Mississippi. This par-
72, 6,339-yard inland course has been challenging golfers since
1897, as well as wowing them with its tree-lined charm. And by
Pebble Beach terms, greens fees are reasonable: $105 plus $20 per
player for the cart.
 Designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., Tom Watson, and Frank Tatum,
the Links at Spanish Bay, at the Inn at Spanish Bay, is the foremost
Scottish linksland-style course in the United States; Tom Watson
has said, “It’s so much like Scotland, you can almost hear the bag-
pipes.” Greens fees are $240 for guests and nonguests alike, but
guests get the cart for free.
It’s an even playing field for tee times at the public Poppy Hills Golf
Course, just off 17-Mile Drive on Lopez Road (% 831-625-2035; www.
poppyhillsgolf.com), where everybody has an equal shot. Robert
Trent Jones, Jr., designed this par-72, 6,861-yard course, which is a
favorite among duffers. The course accepts reservations up to 30 days in
advance. Call as early as possible within that time frame for your choice
of tee times, but you can usually snare a slot a week in advance. Greens
fees are lower, too: $130 Monday through Thursday and $160 Friday
through Sunday and holidays, with carts running an extra $32.
Carmel-by-the-Sea and Carmel Valley
If Monterey sounds too touristy, Pebble Beach too chi-chi, and Big Sur
too woodsy or rustic (see Chapter 19), Carmel is the place for you. This
high-end haven is among the stars of the California coast, and one of the
loveliest towns in all of America. It’s more like an elite artists’ colony
than a mass-market tourist town, with galleries and boutiques galore,
quaint views or sweeping vistas at every turn, and a relaxed vibe that
whispers “away from it all” like sweet nothings in your ear.
Carmel exudes charisma by the bucketload. This village displays its
assets like a starlet in Cannes, with picture-perfect, cypress-dotted
streets gradually leading downhill to one of the most spectacular
beaches on the California coast. And 15 minutes away up Carmel Valley
Road, the ocean gives way to mountains, ranches, and resorts.
Not everyone adores Carmel, however. For one, complaints of commer-
cialism abound from those who knew it when — before Saks Fifth Avenue
and all those cute inns set up shop. And like its most famous resident,
Clint Eastwood (who served a high-profile stint as mayor a few years
back), virtually all the residents are seven-figure types. As a result, prices
are high across the board, restaurants are more upscale than casual, and
an air of elitism prevails.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
264

Carmel isn’t really suited for children; romance-seeking couples rule the
day here. If you have the kids in tow, you’ll probably be happier basing
yourself in the Carmel Valley, Monterey, or Pacific Grove, instead. You
will find, however, that no one’s more welcome in Carmel than the family
pet; this is West Coast nirvana for those who travel with Fido.
Carmel is rather quiet and not overloaded with sightseeing “attractions”
per se. Visiting is more about slowing down a bit — browsing the bou-
tiques, ambling the back streets to admire the fabulous homes, and
strolling that breathtaking beach. If you’re looking for relaxation, stay a
while. All you need is a day or so to explore the village itself, but Carmel
also makes a good base for tooling around the entire peninsula, and
even the stupendous Big Sur Coast (see Chapter 19).
Orienting yourself and getting around
Carmel-by-the-Sea is petite and easy to navigate. The town is laid out on a
basic grid pattern, with Ocean Avenue running due west from Highway 1
to Carmel Beach and serving as the village’s main drag.
Parallel to Ocean Avenue run numbered avenues: Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth
avenues to the north, and Seventh and Eighth avenues to the south.
(The town extends farther in each direction, but these streets shape
downtown.)
Perpendicular to Ocean and the numbered avenues run a number of
name streets: Mission Street, San Carlos, Dolores, Lincoln, and so on.
You can get an easy-to-follow, cartoony map of downtown labeling most
major businesses almost everywhere about town; for a preview (com-
plete with links to business Web sites), point your Web browser to www.
carmelfun.com. Carmel Valley is reached via Carmel Valley Road, just
south of Carmel-by-the-Sea on Highway 1.
This quaint village has no need for such big-city affectations as street
addresses. Thus, all addresses are given in general terms: San Carlos
Street at Seventh, Sixth between Lincoln and Monte Verde, and so on.
Everything in town is within walking distance. Most likely, you’ll be able
to park your car at your inn or motel and leave it there for the duration
of your stay. Parking has strict 30- to 90-minute time limits in the down-
town area, but moving a few blocks off Ocean Avenue into more residen-
tial territory usually yields less restricted space. A free lot sits at Third
Avenue and Torres Street, and another at the beach; a convenient pay
lot is at Eighth Avenue and San Carlos Street.
Where to stay
Carmel is so completely adorable that it’s a hugely popular weekend
destination. Book well in advance if you’re planning a visit over a Friday
or Saturday night. And be aware that most places require a two-night
Chapter 18: The Monterey Peninsula 265

minimum stay on weekends. Accommodations upvalley are a little easier
to reserve, but you’ll still want advance reservations in the summer.
You may want to try booking your room through a free reservations
service such as MontereyVisitorsGuide.com (% 888-655-3424; www.
monterey-reservations.com) or Resort 2 Me (% 800-757-5646; www.
lodgingreservations.net), or the Carmel Area Reservation Service
(% 888-434-3891 or 831-659-7061; www.carmel-california.com). You
can sometimes get a better rate through these services than you can by
calling direct, and they’ll make alternative suggestions if the suggestions
in this section are full.

Carmel’s pet-friendliest hotel is famous for being co-owned by screen
legend Doris Day, whose movie posters grace the bar. This 1929 Moorish-
Mediterranean inn is beautifully styled, but the building is old — we were

dismayed to see space heaters in the guest rooms. Some of the standard
doubles are quite small and on the spare side as well (and no. 111 is dark).
However, a 12-room addition was completed in 2005, so request one of the
new rooms or a corner king to get some space between you and your lug-
gage. You can enjoy breakfast in the lovely courtyard on nice days, and
the comfy fireplace-lit living room is a guest magnet in the evenings. The
service is accommodating, especially to dogs. You might not want to book
here without one.

Los Laureles Lodge
$$–$$$
Carmel Valley
Carmel Valley has a number of expensive resorts, but us regular folks are
quite fond of this historic ranch dating from 1830. Courtyard doubles, con-
verted from former stables that once housed the Vanderbilt thorough-
breds, are comfortable and simply decorated around warm knotty-pine
walls. Families with young children can cozy up in a Surrey Lane room,
large enough for a queen bed and pullout sofa. There’s a swimming pool,
an outdoor bar so you don’t have to supply your own piña coladas, and an
extremely good restaurant. If you bring the kids, this is an especially pleas-
ant place to stay.

Mission Ranch
$$–$$$$
Carmel-by-the-Sea
With the kindly assistance of Dirty Harry himself, Clint Eastwood, this
1850s farmhouse and its outlying buildings have been transformed into an
elegant complex worthy of Ralph Lauren. The ranch lies on the outskirts
of town, a good walk away from the village, but sheep-filled pastures and
ocean views make it almost picture-perfect. Rooms vary depending on
price and location, but all have an appealingly cozy ranchland feel. On-site
is an excellent restaurant, plus a fitness room and tennis courts. No pool,
however; it’s too cold.

Carmel-by-the-Sea
If you’re traveling on a budget, this superbly located motel is your best

tive property is spic-and-span, and management is conscientious and
friendly. The double queens are a good bet for families.

Where to dine
It’s really hard to go wrong dining out in Carmel. The locals have loads 
of discretionary income, so they can afford to demand the best. Of the
more than 60 restaurants in this tiny town, most are better than average.
This section describes our favorites — but if you pass something else
that strikes your fancy, chances are good that it won’t disappoint you.
Reservations are a must on weekends.
Little Napoli
$$–$$$
Carmel-by-the-Sea
ITALIAN
Between the charming décor (think red gingham, braids of garlic), the
excellent country-style cooking, the extensive all-Italian wine list, and the
low prices, it’s no wonder that Little Napoli inspires such local loyalty.
Expect hearty favorites such as crispy-crust pizzas, hand-stuffed cannel-
loni, and Neapolitan-style seafood. Everything’s fresh from the field or the
bay. This restaurant is terrific — and a grade-A value to boot.
See map p. 244. In the El Paseo Building, Dolores Street between Ocean and Seventh
avenues. % 831-626-6335. www.littlenapoli.com. Reservations highly rec-
ommended for dinner. Main courses: $12–$25. MC, V. Open: Mon–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–
9:30 p.m., Fri–Sun 11:30 a.m.–10 p.m. (hours vary seasonally, so call ahead).
Casanova
$$$–$$$$
Carmel-by-the-Sea
FRENCH/ITALIAN
In a town full of dreamy restaurants, this is far and away the most roman-
tic. The Mediterranean-style house (former home of Charlie Chaplin’s
Part IV: The Central Coast 
268

cook) spills over with candlelit old-world charm. But don’t let all this talk
of ambience fool you: The French-Italian menu is top-notch, the service is
excellent, and the 30,000-bottle wine cellar is an award-winner. Considering
that the meals include antipasto and dessert, prices aren’t bad, either.

Carmel-by-the-Sea
PACIFIC RIM/SEAFOOD
Chef/owner Kenny Fukumoto’s dark and intimate pan-Asian seafood house
is one of our favorite restaurants on the Monterey Peninsula. Expect 
creative, beautifully prepared seafood dishes with Japanese accents —
rare peppered ahi and yosenabe (clay-pot seafood) are shining stars on
the universally pleasing menu — plus specialties like rib-eye shabu-shabu
for nonseafood eaters.

The Forge in the Forest
$–$$$
Carmel-by-the-Sea
AMERICAN
For outdoor dining, this is the local favorite especially among dog lovers
(there’s even a menu for Barkley), but even when it’s cold enough to defeat
the patio heaters, the Forge is a fun place for lunch or dinner. The inside
dining room couldn’t be more casual, featuring a communal table and a
well-attended bar. There’s nothing sophisticated about the food either —
burgers, hot pastrami or corned beef sandwiches, delectable baby-back
pork ribs, steak, pizza, chicken, big salads, and so on — but it’s straight-
forward and tasty. Sometimes you just want to eat where the food doesn’t
require an explanation.

Jack London’s Bar & Grill

Carmel-by-the-Sea
AMERICAN
Come here when you tire of Carmel’s high prices and pretentious airs. This 30-
year-old bar and restaurant is a completely regular hangout that has never-
theless been lauded by the New York Times for its charms. The huge menu
ranges from burgers and chicken-breast sandwiches to pizzas, Tex-Mex spe-
cialties, and Black Angus steaks. It offers great bathtub-size margaritas, too.

Exploring Carmel-by-the-Sea
At the foot of Ocean Avenue sits Carmel Beach, one of the most heav-
enly beaches in the United States, if not the world. A wide crescent of
white sand skirts gorgeous, tide-pool-dotted Carmel Bay. A screen of
gnarled cypresses separates street from sand, and the emerald-green
cliffs of Pebble Beach rise in the distance. Swimming is a no-no because
the waves are too rough (and the water’s too cold year-round), but the
beach is great for strolling, picnicking, and playing fetch with Fido, who’s
allowed to run off-leash here (you’ll see lots of happy dogs cavorting in
the sand). Take time to walk along this stretch of beach no matter what
season you’re visiting; walk north for the best views.
The small parking lot at the end of Ocean gets crowded year-round, 
but you can often find additional spots along Scenic Road, from which
wooden staircases lead down to the beach at various points along the
road. (Note, however, that the only restrooms are at the parking lot on
Ocean Avenue.)
If you want a little sand space to yourself, follow Scenic Road south
around the promontory to Carmel River State Beach, a more remote,
white-sand-dune-dotted stretch that’s a paradise for birders.
Shopping and strolling
Shopping is tops among Carmel activities. Pricey apparel and home-
furnishing boutiques, jewelry stores, and art galleries line the streets 
of downtown. Don’t expect to find anything too funky; still, you can do
lots of one-of-a-kind browsing. If you’re a gallery hound, pick up the free
“Carmel Gallery Guide,” available throughout town. Be sure to peek
into Carmel’s various courtyards, which often hide some of the best
finds. The alfresco Carmel Plaza, at Ocean Avenue and Mission Street
(% 831-624-0137; www.carmelplaza.com), houses about 50 shops,
including familiar names such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Banana Republic.
Stepping into the past
Mission San Carlos Borromeo del Rio Carmelo, more commonly known
as the Carmel Mission, 3080 Rio Rd. (% 831-624-3600; www.carmel
mission.org), is one of the largest and most beautiful of the 21 Spanish
missions established by Father Junípero Serra, Spanish founder of
California’s mission chain. Built in a baroque style with a towering
Moorish bell tower, it has been in continuous operation since 1771. The
burnished terra-cotta facade and soaring, romantic curves make it worth
strolling by even if you don’t go inside. Still, if you’re a history buff, make
the effort, because Serra is buried here and his cell contains some of the
original furnishings.
It’s open for self-guided tours Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to
5 p.m. (Sun from 10:30 a.m.), with extended hours in summer. Admission
is $5 for adults, $4 for seniors, and $1 for kids 6 to 17. To reach the mis-
sion, take San Carlos Street south from town and follow the signs, or take
Rio Road west off Highway 1 and follow it for a half-mile.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
270

If you’d like to find out more about local history and color, take a two-
hour guided walk with Carmel Walks (% 831-642-2700; www.carmel
walks.com). The walks take place Tuesday through Friday at 10 a.m.,
Saturday at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., for $20 per person. Tours leave from 
the Pine Inn at Lincoln Street and Ocean Avenue; call ahead to reserve
your spot.
Sampling Big Sur’s natural beauty
The spectacular beauty of the Big Sur Coast (see Chapter 19) begins just
3 miles south of Carmel-by-the-Sea at Point Lobos State Reserve (% 831-
624-4909; www.pointlobos.org). A cypress-dotted headland, the Big
Sur Coast has been variously called “the greatest meeting of land and
water in the world” and “the crown jewel of the state parks system.” It’s
a natural wonderland, all right, with sea lions, otters, harbor seals, and
seabirds populating the ocean coves; spectacular coastal vistas (perfect
for whale-watching in winter); picnic areas; and miles of hiking trails.
The entrance fee is $8 per car, which includes a trail map. Open from 
9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Arrive early, especially on weekends; if the lot is full, you
have to wait for someone to leave before you can enter.
Gathering More Information
For peninsula-wide information before you arrive, point your Web
browser to www.monterey.com, or contact the Monterey Peninsula
Visitors and Convention Bureau on their 24-hour information hotline
(% 831-649-1770). Another useful source of information is the Monterey
County Convention and Visitors Bureau (% 888-221-1010; www.
montereyinfo.org). For Carmel-specific information, you can call 
% 888-434-3891, visit www.carmel-california.com (an advertiser-
driven site), or you can check out the official city Web site at www.
carmelcalifornia.com.
In Monterey
Stop in at the well-staffed and well-stocked Monterey Visitors Center,
near downtown at Camino El Estero and Franklin Street (1 block inland
from Del Monte Avenue). It’s open Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 6 p.m. (to 5 p.m. Nov–Mar), Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. (to 4 p.m.
Nov–Mar).
In Carmel
You can pick up information from the Carmel Business Association,
upstairs next to the Eastwood Building on San Carlos Street between
Fifth and Sixth avenues in Carmel-by-the-Sea (% 831-624-2522). You can
also call ahead to have a visitor’s guide sent to you. The office is open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Saturday from 11 a.m.
to 3 p.m. (check for Sun hours in summer).

F
ew shorelines in the world are as breathtaking as the Big Sur Coast.
Skirted by rugged shores and crescent-shaped bays, this pristine
wilderness of towering redwoods and rolling hills is tranquil, unspoiled,
romantic, dramatic, and overwhelmingly beautiful — and, as you may
assume, perfect for a true getaway. If you want quiet, this is the place.
Although, technically, a Big Sur Village exists (29 miles south of the
Monterey Peninsula on Highway 1), it’s not much more than a post office
and the Big Sur Bazaar/Deli, which sells sundries, gifts, and good take-
away Mexican food (and has the best prices on sandwiches, in case you
need a picnic). Big Sur actually refers to the gorgeous 90-mile stretch of
land between Carmel-by-the-Sea and San Simeon. The main thoroughfare
and scenic byway is Highway 1, blessed on one side by the 167,000-acre
Ventana Wilderness, with the splendid Santa Lucia mountain range rising
just beyond, and on the other by the wild, spectacular coast (see the
“The Big Sur Coast” map on p. 274). The region is at its most woodsy and
breathtaking in the northern half, but the entire coastline drive is stun-
ning.
Development is minimal, and you’ll find little more to do here than com-
mune with nature — but oh, what nature it is! Make time to enjoy it. Hike
the state parks, walk the beaches, stop along the drive to watch wind-
surfers pirouette among the waves and sea lions sun on the rocks, or
perch yourself atop the cliffs and take in the sea breeze. You won’t
believe the effect Big Sur can have on your soul: Modern life fades into
the background as you become absorbed in Mother Nature’s world.

The flip side to all this poetic waxing, however, is that Big Sur requires
some effort to enjoy. With just one winding, hairpin-plagued lane in each
direction, Highway 1 is slow going and can be tummy turning. Tourist
facilities along the route are limited, so don’t expect a gas station every
few miles or any chain motels or fast-food joints at all. The region’s
remoteness has fostered a special breed of local, quiet types who
fiercely protect their privacy, their rustic lifestyle, and the unspoiled
nature around them. A hippie vibe prevails — most residents came here
to get away from it all, and they mean to keep it that way. Stay off private
property and unmarked driveways, and stick to clearly marked pullouts,
public areas, and parks. Take a cue from the locals: Appreciate Big Sur
for what it is — glorious and unspoiled. Enjoy it, respect it, and leave no
mark. Pack out everything you bring in.
Timing Your Visit
Like much of California’s central and northern coast, Big Sur is at its
clearest, warmest, and sunniest best during early fall — September and
October. Summer is the busiest season traffic-wise and hotel-wise, so
plan ahead and expect to pay top dollar.
What’s the tradeoff for cooler weather in winter and spring? Clear skies,
little fog, no crowds, lower hotel rates, and fabulous offshore views of
the mammoth gray whales that migrate from Alaska to Mexico and back
again between November and April. For a breakdown of the seasons and
events, go to www.bigsurcalifornia.org and click on “Calendar.”
Leave yourself plenty of time to mosey along the Big Sur Coast. Even
though the distance is only about 110 miles from Carmel to San Simeon,
you can’t really drive the twisty-turny road in less than three hours. And
trust us — you don’t want to. Allow a whole day for the drive. New and
exciting views present themselves at every turn, with plenty of vista
points for stopping. An entire day gives you time to go hiking at one of
the parks along the way, plus time for a picnic or a leisurely lunch.
If you want to stay overnight to spend more hours among the trees, be
aware that the accommodations in this funky neck of the woods fall into
two categories: big-money luxurious or comfort-challenged rustic. You
won’t find any affordable country inns or reliable chain motels in
between, and TVs are not a common amenity no matter which budget
level you choose. (Cellphone reception isn’t too great, either.) If the
choices in the “Where to Stay in Big Sur” section don’t suit you, but you
still want more than a day to explore Mother Nature’s handiwork, base
yourself just to the north on the Monterey Peninsula (Carmel is particu-
larly convenient) or near Hearst Castle to the south.

Getting There
You can access all the main attractions via Highway 1. If you’re dedicat-
ing a day to the drive, set out early to take full advantage of daylight.
The slow, curving drive is a drag at night, and you can’t see the great
scenery. Leaving early is especially important if you’re heading north,
because the region’s finest parks, Pfeiffer Big Sur and Julia Pfeiffer Burns
state parks, are about two-thirds of the way up the coast.
Where to Stay in Big Sur
Camping is certainly the truest way to experience this unspoiled region.
If camping’s your thing, visit www.bigsurcalifornia.org for a com-
plete list of campground options. If camping’s not your thing, expect 
10.5 percent in taxes to be tacked on to your hotel bill.

Big Sur Lodge
$$–$$$
Big Sur
Tucked among the redwoods of Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park are these 62
rustic cabins, many large enough to house families. Well-kept, spacious,
and newly remodeled, all have private bathrooms and patios with lovely
views, but no TV, telephone, or even an alarm clock to interrupt as you
meditate on nature. Spend a bit more for a fireplace and/or kitchenette;
nights get cool, and who wants to run out for coffee in the morning? A so-
so restaurant, country store, and heated pool, plus all park amenities, are
on-site.

Deetjen’s Big Sur Inn
$$–$$$
Big Sur
Built by a Norwegian homesteader and his missus in the 1930s and now a
national historic site, Deetjen’s is quintessential Big Sur: lovely, rustic, and
funky to a fault. If you don’t mind sacrificing creature comforts for rustic-
cozy, you’ll love the oddball collection of hand-hewn cabins. The cabins do
not include phones, TVs, or central heating. Walls are single-board thin,
so don’t pass on a fire-heated room — even in summer — and don’t expect
privacy or quiet (families with kids younger than 12 must book two adjoin-
ing rooms). The restaurant is one of the local bests and a must if you love
breakfast. Book well ahead, because the inn fills up months in advance.

Big Sur
Wide expanses of glass bring the outside in to 30 gorgeous, amenity-filled
oceanfront cottages, spread out over 98 unspoiled, five-star acres at this
environmentally friendly, ultraexclusive resort. No TVs, but you’ll have a CD
player and everything else you could want — even your own private slice
of Big Sur to explore. A full menu of spa treatments is available in your room
or outdoors — you decide. The restaurant is excellent, too — probably the
best place around for a blowout meal. This place is ridiculously expensive
(not to mention a tad pretentious), but it’s worth every penny. Kids younger
than 18 are not invited to stay here.

Ragged Point
This rustic motel at the southern gateway to Big Sur serves its purpose
for travelers ready for a break, either from civilization or the road. Rooms
are clean, and the upstairs “Tier 2” models feature newer furnishings,
comfy beds, TVs, and balconies for enjoying the glorious oceanfront views.
“Tier 4” rooms are even pricier, but you’ll have better coastal vistas, a fire-
place, kitchenette, and private patio. The resort includes a gorgeous stone-
pillared restaurant with decent but expensive food and an ocean-facing
patio. The grounds are fab — stop by for the sightlines even if you don’t
stay the night.

Big Sur
The newest lodging on the Big Sur coast features 16 yurts (round, canvas-
covered structures akin to those favored by Turkish nomads). These spa-
cious yurts, however, are furnished with sinks, space heaters, and double
beds covered in fancy quilted bedspreads, and yurt no. 1 sports its own
ping-pong table! It’s camping taken up quite a number of notches. The
remainder of the resort, which is on a cliff overlooking the ocean, consists
of a swimming pool and a handsome lodge where guests can prepare their
own complimentary waffle breakfast, partake in a not-inexpensive bar-
beque dinner, relax, or shop for snack foods and drinks. Treebones
became immediately popular upon opening so make your reservations
three months in advance. And bring flip-flops for the bathhouse.

Big Sur
Across the highway from Post Ranch is Big Sur’s original luxury oasis,
spread over a whopping 243 meadowy, ocean-facing acres. The gorgeous
rooms are more high-country cozy than contemporary, and TVs, VCRs,
and CD players are among the in-room luxuries. You can’t argue with the
fabulousness of the grounds, and the 2,100-square-foot spa has amenities
ranging from massages and mud treatments to aromatherapy sessions and

lowed by wine and cheese in the lobby where you can also sign up for a
ten-minute chair massage. Dinner is served in the first-rate Cielo (see the
following section). If you’re with the kids on this trip, stay elsewhere.

Where to Dine in Big Sur
In addition to the options listed in this section, consider these excellent
choices at Big Sur’s top places to stay (reservations are recommended):
 Cielo, at the Ventana Inn & Spa (% 831-667-2331), is tops for a
sophisticated lunch stop or a special dinner. Grab a midday table
on the outdoor patio in nice weather — the views are incredible.
The California cuisine doesn’t disappoint, either. Main courses run
$11 to $17 at lunch, $24 to $30 at dinner.
 The lovely restaurant at Deetjen’s Big Sur Inn (% 831-667-2377) 
is regaled for its hearty cooking and intimate ambience. Breakfast
($7–$10) includes all your farmhouse favorites, while dinner
($17–$29) features such sophisticated but unfussy dishes as New
York steak with twice-baked potato and herb-crusted New Zealand
rack of lamb. A country delight.

High-quality ingredients and loving hands in the kitchen are part of the
ethos at this casual cafe. Come for coffee and pastries in the morning, or
arrive later for wood-fired pizzas, grilled line-caught sea bass (line-caught
means you can eat it guilt-free), caramelized onion tarts with candied wal-
nuts and a dab of blue cheese, or just some homemade cookies to take on
the road. It’s all good.

Big Sur
CALIFORNIA/LATIN AMERICAN
Considered by locals to be the place to eat (and drink), this charming diner
is beyond terrific and a bargain by Big Sur standards. The Latino-inspired
menu is delectable, featuring soft tacos du jour, a goat-cheese quesadilla
sparked up with mango-basil salsa, a selection of enchiladas, yummy tor-
tilla soup, and a glazed breast of chicken that was so tender and juicy, any
bird with foresight would gladly sacrifice herself to this kitchen. For a
fancy gourmet meal, head to the Post Ranch Inn or Cielo; for a stellar but
easygoing dinner, the Roadhouse can’t be beat.

Nepenthe’s prices are too high if you consider only the strictly average
American fare — steaks, broiled fish, burgers, quiche — but if you’re
choosing a restaurant based on the view, look no farther. The panorama is
awe-inspiring, and starlit nights are pure magic. The redwood-beamed
indoor/outdoor restaurant has a wonderful lodgelike atmosphere, and a
casual party vibe prevails. Come by for a drink if you don’t want to pay for
the food. Or, better yet, on nice days, head a level down to the alfresco
Café Kevah. Kevah’s amazing patio boasts the same stellar views, and its
casual healthy-gourmet daytime fare is a fraction of the dough.

Exploring the Big Sur Coast
We discuss the highlights in this section as you proceed along High-
way 1 southbound, strictly to match the structure of this book. However,
making the drive southbound brings no particular advantage, scenic or
otherwise.
In addition to these stops, a number of smaller parks and scenic vistas
with pullouts exist along the way.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
278

 Just 3 miles south of Carmel lies Point Lobos State Reserve (% 831-
624-4909; http://pt-lobos.parks.state.ca.us), a cypress-
dotted headland that has been variously called “the greatest meet-
ing of land and water in the world” and “the crown jewel of the
state parks system.” It’s a natural wonderland, all right, with sea
lions, otters, harbor seals, and seabirds populating the sea coves;
superb coastal vistas (perfect for whale-watching in winter); picnic
areas; and miles of hiking trails. The entrance fee is $8 per car ($4 if
you have a senior citizen on board) and includes a trail map. If you
have time for only a single stop, this is the one. But arrive early,
especially on weekends. If the lot is full, you have to wait for some-
one to leave before you can enter.
 About 13 miles south of Carmel is the Bixby Bridge, which you may
recognize, even if you’ve never been to Big Sur. Rising 260 feet over
Bixby Creek Canyon, the much-photographed overpass is one of
the world’s highest single-span concrete bridges, and one of Big
Sur’s most iconic images. Park your car in the lot on the north side
and walk across the span to take in the magnificent views.
 South of Bixby Bridge is Point Sur Lightstation, in Point Sur State
Historic Park (% 831-625-4419 or 831-667-2315; www.parks.ca.
gov). Built 361 feet above the surf and first lit in 1889 — and in con-
tinuous operation ever since — Point Sur is the only working 19th-
century lighthouse on the California coast that’s open to the public.
Three-hour tours are scheduled on weekends (Sat 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.,
Sun 10 a.m. only), with some weekday and moonlight tours added in
summer. The fee is $5 for adults, $3 for teens 13 to 18, $2 for kids 5 to
12, free for children younger than 5.
The lighthouse tour includes a steep half-mile hike each way,
including stairs, so wear sturdy shoes and a (preferably water-
proof) windbreaker to guard against the elements.
 About 20 miles south of Carmel is Andrew Molera State Park 
(% 831-667-2315; www.parks.ca.gov), the largest park on the Big
Sur Coast, and the least crowded. Miles of trails meander through
meadows and along bluffs. The 21⁄2-mile-long beach is accessible via
a lovely mile-long path flanked by wildflowers in spring. At low tide,
you can walk the entire length of the beach; otherwise, stick to the
bluff. No swimming, of course — the water’s way too cold. Between
April and October you can ride horseback on the sand with Molera
Horseback Tours (% 800-942-5486 or 831-625-5486; www.molera
horsebacktours.com). Prices are $25 to $59 for one- to two-and-a-
half-hour guided rides.
 Across from Molera State Park, you can pick up the Old Coast
Road, the original 1880s thoroughfare, when only wagons traversed
these parts. If you’re heading south, you can follow it as a rough
Chapter 19: The Spectacular Big Sur Coast 279

scenic alternative for about 8 miles by turning left before crossing
the Bixby Bridge, but if you just backtrack about a mile north from
this entrance, you get a spectacular view of the Big Sur Valley, Point
Sur Lighthouse, and the Pacific beyond. Don’t try the road in wet
weather, though; you’ll get stuck.
 Another 5 miles or so down the road (26 miles south of Carmel) is
Big Sur Station (% 831-667-2315), a terrific source for maps,
ranger advice, and other Big Sur information.
 Big Sur Station is just past the entrance to Pfeiffer Big Sur State
Park, 800 acres of wildlife-rich parkland with excellent hiking
opportunities for all levels of ability; maps are at the park entrance.
One excellent moderate walk is the 40- to 60-minute route to 60-
foot-high Pfeiffer Falls; the walk takes you through one of Big Sur’s
most impressive redwood groves. If you’re feeling energetic, add
another hour to follow the trail to the Valley View Overlook (a half-
mile from the falls) for panoramic views.
 About a mile south of the Pfeiffer Big Sur park entrance is Sycamore
Canyon Road, which leads to beautiful Pfeiffer Beach. An arch-
shaped rock formation offshore offers a distinctive view. Sycamore
Canyon Road is an unmarked route that is the only paved, ungated
road west of Highway 1 between the Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park and
the Big Sur Post Office (you should see a “Narrow Road” sign as an
additional clue). Take the sharp turn toward the coast and slowly
follow the road for about 2 winding miles to a parking lot; parking is
$5. A short path leads to the beach. Skip this trip if you’re pulling a
trailer or driving a motor home.
Although the sunsets are spectacular, locals advise that you come
to Pfeiffer Beach in the morning hours to avoid windblown sand
(the winds can kick up in the later hours).
 The Henry Miller Memorial Library (% 831-667-2574; www.henry
miller.org) is on the mountain side of Highway 1, a quarter-mile
south of Nepenthe. It is dedicated to the life and work of Miller, who
lived in Big Sur from 1944 to 1962 and wrote such classics as Tropic
of Cancer. First editions of his writings, as well as some of his art-
work, are on display. The library makes a pleasant place for a short
stop, especially for Miller fans. Admission is free. Open Wednesday
through Monday from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
 Twelve miles south of Pfeiffer Big Sur is Julia Pfeiffer Burns State
Park, a gem of a park and our absolute favorite spot for glorious
ocean views.
Everyone can follow the Overlook Waterfall Trail — it’s even
wheelchair-accessible. The flat and easy .3-mile (each way) trail
Part IV: The Central Coast 
280

leads to a cliff top with views of McWay Falls plunging into a gor-
geous cove where seals and sea otters play in the white-crested
blue-green water. Cypress trees stepping down the rocky coast in
the background create an only-in-Big-Sur mystique. In winter, park
yourself on one of the benches to look for migrating whales. The
view is particularly magnificent at sunset.
Above the parking lot is a small picnic area and trailheads to two
more of the park’s hiking trails. The .3-mile Canyon Trail is steeper
and ungraded but still not difficult, and the payoff is a lovely forest
waterfall and a bench from which to contemplate it (and rest your
weary toes). The day-use fee is $6 per car; ask the park attendant to
sell you a trail map for an additional buck.
The big attractions end after Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, but the drive
is still stunning, and scenic turnoffs abound. About 59 miles south of
Carmel, just south of the U.S. Forest Service Station in Pacific Valley, is
Sand Dollar Beach, which features a pleasant picnic area. Take the
stairs to reach the beach, which may be devoid of sand if you visit in
winter (it usually washes back in summer).
Farther south — just north of San Simeon, where the landscape opens
up to rolling, golden hills — you’ll see elephant seals sunning them-
selves on rocks and maybe a few colorful windsurfers dancing on the
waves beyond. That’s when you know you’ve almost reached the outra-
geous, infamous, legendary Hearst Castle, which is just around the
bend. We discuss the Hearst Castle in Chapter 20.
Chapter 19: The Spectacular Big Sur Coast 281
Walking Big Sur
The single best thing we’ve done in Big Sur is to take a walking tour with Big Sur
Guides (% 831-658-0199 or 831-594-1742; www.bigsurguides.com). Steve
Copeland, who started his business decades ago, knows the secrets of the area, and
his guides show you things that you’re likely to miss if you head out on your own. You
may even discover how to tame a banana slug — or at least develop some empathy
for the ugly creatures. Rates for the two-and-a-half-hour walks are around $50 per
person and include a picnic lunch.
Big Sur Guides also runs a free, one-hour guided discovery walk that leaves from the
Ventana Inn lobby daily at 10 a.m. The walk is open to anyone in the neighborhood —
you don’t have to be a guest at the hotel. You’ll likely catch a look at the inn’s overly
friendly turkey and perhaps the deer that hang about; you’ll certainly hear some
extraordinary stories about the surroundings.

Gathering More Information
Your best source for Big Sur information is the Big Sur Chamber of
Commerce Web site (www.bigsurcalifornia.org); you can also call
the chamber at % 831-677-2100. Additionally, the Monterey Peninsula
Visitors and Convention Bureau (% 888-221-1010; www.monterey
info.org) can provide you with information on Big Sur.
For more information on Big Sur’s state parks, call California State
Parks’ Big Sur Station at % 831-667-2315, or point your Web browser 
to www.parks.ca.gov. Located 26 miles south of Carmel, a half-mile
south of the entrance to Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park, Big Sur Station is 
the prime information stop for the region after you’ve arrived.

Chapter 20
Hearst Castle and Cambria
In This Chapter
 Visiting the mind-boggling castle that Hearst built
 Deciding on the best places to stay and dine nearby
 Strolling the village and bumming around the beach
P
ublishing baron and film mogul William Randolph Hearst was one of
the most influential men of the 20th century. His extensive travels
throughout Europe as a child fueled a dream to build a house as grand as
the castles he admired. In 1919, he inherited 250,000 acres of ranchland,
which had been originally known as “Camp Hill.” He instructed his archi-
tect to “build a little something” where he could escape the stress of work
and public scrutiny. It was to be his country estate, a relaxing and enjoy-
able environment for family and friends. He renamed his marvelous ranch
“La Cuesta Encantada” — The Enchanted Hill. In its heyday — the ’30s and
’40s, the so-called Golden Age of Hollywood — this real-life Xanadu was
the playground for the silver screen’s elite, among them Carole Lombard,
Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, and Harpo Marx.
The 165-room Mediterranean Revival–style estate — including its three
guesthouses, Italian- and Spanish-inspired gardens, and two fabulous
oversized swimming pools — has never been completely finished. It
houses one of the world’s finest collections of priceless antiques and
museum-quality art — a collection that millions of people may never
have seen if Hearst did not have the vision (and money) to buy countless
pieces of European art offered for sale by governments after World War II.
A recent earthquake, with an epicenter dangerously close to nearby San
Simeon, nonetheless caused no structural damage, and luckily, only a few
artifacts went tumbling (and then off to the repair shop).
From its beautiful gardens and striking architecture to its glorious art and
history, Hearst Castle is impressive. Plus, it’s a monument to the seemingly
limitless powers of money and hubris and what happens to the American
Dream when left unchecked. And, lest we forget, it inspired the greatest
movie of all time (wanna fight about it?), Citizen Kane. This is a must-see
stop in your exploration of California’s Central Coast, and it has something
for everyone. However, children younger than 6 may find walking and
climbing hundreds of steps for almost two hours a bit overwhelming.

Hearst’s sprawling compound sits high above San Simeon, which isn’t
really much of a town. But 6 miles to the south is Cambria (pronounced
cam-bree-uh), which makes an excellent base of operations. Not quite
Northern Californian and not quite Southern California, not quite
coastal and not quite inland, this charming village has a distinct and
winning personality and offers terrific opportunities for dining and
strolling.
Because of its proximity, most people use Cambria as the jumping-off
point for a visit to San Simeon. We can’t argue with the convenience, but
a case can be made for staying overnight in either Paso Robles or San
Luis Obispo, interesting small towns located to the south in the Central
Coast Wine Country (see Chapter 21). The access to wineries and better
dining alone make both attractive alternatives.
Timing Your Visit
Hearst Castle and Cambria are enjoyable in any season. The biggest con-
siderations are money and crowds.
You’ll snare the lowest hotel rates in winter, and the castle is quiet
enough that you needn’t make advance tour reservations. Spring and fall
are pleasant — you’ll have the opportunity to take the evening tour
(only offered in these seasons), and you’ll still beat the crowds if you
visit midweek.
You pay the highest hotel rates and wrestle with the biggest crowds 
in summer. You should make weekend hotel reservations, in particular,
as far in advance as possible, and we highly recommend purchasing
advance tickets for castle tours (more on this subject in the “Visiting the
Castle” section later in this chapter).
Set aside two days to enjoy the castle and the charms of Cambria. If you’re
just coming to see the castle, one day will do, but expect it to be a longish
one and sandwich it between a two-night stay.
Getting There
Cambria is right off Highway 1, smack dab in the middle of the coast. It’s
located 223 miles south of San Francisco, 105 miles south of Monterey,
130 miles north of Santa Barbara, and 230 miles north of Los Angeles.
San Simeon, home to the Hearst Castle Visitor Center, is on Highway 1, 
6 miles north of Cambria. See the “The Cambria and San Simeon Area”
map on p. 286.
 Driving from points north: If you’re following the scenic route
through Big Sur, just keep going — stay on Highway 1 until you see
signs for Hearst Castle, and for Cambria a few minutes beyond.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
284

If you’re coming directly from San Francisco or Monterey, take U.S.
101 south to Paso Robles, then Highway 46 west to Highway 1, and
Highway 1 north to Cambria and the castle.
 Driving from points south: Take U.S. 101 north to San Luis Obispo,
where you’ll pick up Highway 1 north to Cambria and the castle.
Orienting Yourself
San Simeon is less a town than a stretch of Highway 1 lined with motels
and services catering to castle visitors. The entrance to Hearst Castle
rests just north of San Simeon on the inland side of the road.
Cambria lies 6 miles south of the Hearst Castle Visitor Center. The town’s
Main Street runs roughly parallel to Highway 1 inland, connecting up with
the highway at each end of town.
Tiny Cambria actually has three distinct parts. Along Main Street is 
“the Village,” which is divided into two sections: the West Village and the
East Village. The West Village is the newer, somewhat more touristy end
of town where you’ll find the visitor information center. The more historic
East Village is a bit quieter, more locals-oriented, and a tad more sophisti-
cated than the West Village.
If you cross Highway 1 to the coastal side at the far west end of town (or
the north end, if you’re considering how the freeway runs), you’ll reach
Cambria’s third part, Moonstone Beach. Lined with motels, inns, and a
few restaurants on the inland side of the street, ocean-facing Moonstone
Beach Drive is our favorite place to stay in Cambria.
Where to Stay near the Castle
If you’re planning to explore both Hearst Castle and the Big Sur coast
from one perch, consider staying at the Ragged Point Inn & Resort, just
14 miles north of Hearst Castle near the southern gateway to Big Sur
(discussed in Chapter 19).
If Hearst Castle is your only destination, there is only one reason to
choose lodging in San Simeon instead of Cambria — money. Standard,
run-of-the-mill motels line both sides of Highway 1, which runs through
this town. But if you’re a little flexible with the time of year you plan to
visit the area, you can find some comparable bargains in a couple of the
inns in Cambria, such as the Creekside Inn or the Bluebird Inn.
In general, hotel rates are usually lowest in the winter season and at their
highest during the summer; so plan accordingly. Expect an extra 9 percent
in taxes to be tacked on to your Cambria or San Simeon hotel bill.

The Cambria and San Simeon Area
You can’t go wrong with almost any inn on Moonstone Beach Drive.
However, White Water Inn is the only inn that fails to deliver on its prom-
ised ambience and charm in comparison to the other comparably priced
inns. If atmosphere, charm, and beautiful décor are not necessities,
Mariner’s Inn at the Beach, at 6180 Moonstone Beach Dr. (% 805-927-
4624; www.marinersinncambria.com), is your best option for price and
locale.
If you want a super-cheap choice, try the Creekside Inn, 2618 Main St.
(% 800-269-5212; www.cambriacreeksideinn.com). It’s more basic
than the motels that follow and doesn’t boast the same oceanfront
perch, but the village location is extremely convenient and the rates are
considerably lower — $39 to $169 double, year-round.

Best Western Cavalier Oceanfront Resort
$$–$$$
San Simeon
This upscale oceanfront motel is a real gem, for a chain hotel. It’s well situ-
ated along the coast, with lots of oceanview rooms. Every room is very
comfortable (cozy bedding!) and outfitted with a VCR, minibar, and hair
dryer. Coastal evenings can be chilly year-round, so book a room with a
fireplace if you can. On-site extras include two heated pools, a Jacuzzi, an
exercise room, two restaurants, and a coin-op laundry, plus video rentals
next door. The motel welcomes kids and pets, too.

with VCRs, hair dryers, and minifridges — and cozy, frilly, chintzy English-
country décor. The inn also offers a complimentary, expanded continental

masquerading as an inn. The incredibly charming white cottage-style build-
ing features six oceanview minisuites, each with its own outdoor entrance,
canopy bed, marble and granite bathroom (with whirlpool tub), fireplace,
TV, and French/English country décor. This is the only bed-and-breakfast
between Carmel and Santa Barbara with a AAA four-diamond rating.

FogCatcher Inn

Cambria
This is one of our favorite Moonstone Beach inns (we know families who
return here year after year); it also has an outdoor heated pool and spa.
The English Tudor architecture, with thatched roofs and garden pathways,
makes it a standout among the seaside inns. Each room features a stone
fireplace, a refrigerator, a microwave, a coffeemaker, a TV, and an honor
bar. You feel as if you’re actually in an English seaside village.

Tucked away on a woodsy hill just minutes above the East Village is this
utterly lovely B&B, Cambria’s best. The main house is an elegant log cabin;
the nearby carriage house contains seven of the eight impeccable, unfussy
rooms. Named for the counties of Ireland and brimming with country
warmth, each room boasts beautifully chosen antiques, a wood-burning
fireplace, and a private bathroom. The innkeepers couldn’t be more agree-
able or attentive.

The Moonstone Inn
$$–$$$$
Cambria
If you’re economically challenged but you still want English-country-style
décor and comfort with a personal touch, this is your best bet (on the
lower end of the rate scale, that is). The folks at this family-owned and -run
operation are committed to giving each guest personal service. Amenities
include a complimentary breakfast served on china, silver, and crystal in
your room; a TV and VCR with free video choices; and a coffeemaker and
refrigerator. Select rooms offer fireplaces and Jacuzzi tubs. All guests are
welcome to indulge in a Jacuzzi on the oceanfront patio. It’s not the most
attractive inn externally, and the rooms have a slight musty odor, but it’s
a good deal for the locale and price.

Step back in time and indulge yourself in this 19th-century historical

after one of the local towns or a feature unique to the room. All rooms have
fireplaces, and all are charmingly decorated with antiques and floral fab-
rics. For the same money that you might spend on, say, the White Water
Inn on the beachfront (which we tell you to avoid), you can stay here. No
contest.

San Simeon
This camplike resort is nothing fancy, but it’s a great alternative to a family

everyone’s needs, the resort divides units between family and adult areas.
The well-kept grounds feature a solar-heated pool, a playground, and a 
9-hole, par-3 golf course. The grounds have no view, but they do feature
private beach access. Ask for a room away from the highway for total quiet.

CONTEMPORARY/MEDITERRANEAN
This 132-year-old house has been a restaurant for nearly 50 years; it’s cur-
rently under the proprietorship of a Greek family and features an eclectic
assortment of food, including some Greek specialties. We’ve tried the cala-
mari fritti (like buttah!), the saganaki (fried cheese, in this case feta — not
as greasy or as heavy as it sounds), and a Cajun halibut (blackened and
served with an avocado relish that cut the spiciness nicely). Desserts are
terrific. This is one of the most expensive dinner options in town, but it
also has the most extensive menu, and the food is good.

Sadly, this comfortable and charming farmhouse restaurant/bakery/gift

Well-prepared with fresh ingredients and a healthy bent, dishes range from

CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN
The kid’s menu makes the Sow’s Ear good for families, but the relaxing and
intimate ambience makes it the place to go for casual romance as well. You’ll
know that it’s special from the moment you’re presented with the addictive
signature marbled bread, baked and served in a terra-cotta flowerpot. The
beautifully prepared gourmet comfort food includes such favorites as fried
brie, shrimp scampi, barbecued baby-back ribs, and chicken and dumplings.
Don’t miss the sow’s ear grilled chicken breast with a honey-lemon sauce
and served with wild rice and julienne vegetables or the warm cinnamon
bread pudding with cinnamon frosting oozing down the sides. This restau-
rant could easily become one of our Cambria favorites.

Visiting the Castle
The only way to see Hearst Castle (which is now run by the California
State Parks system and is officially known as Hearst San Simeon State
Historical Monument) is via guided tour. The castle is open daily except
on Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day.
Getting on the bus
Four different 13⁄4-hour tours depart regularly throughout the day. Each
one includes the outdoor Greco-Roman-style Neptune Pool (which you’ll
likely recognize from photos) and the stunning indoor Roman Pool, deco-
rated from floor to ceiling with clear and colored glass tiles.
Each tour departs from the visitor center by bus and is led by a well-
trained guide. Before you board the bus, a mandatory photograph will be
taken of you for security purposes (thanks to the September 11, 2001, ter-
rorist attacks). The first tour leaves the visitor center at 8:20 a.m.; the last
one leaves at 3:20 p.m. in winter, later at other times of the year. The
Evening Tour start times are dictated by the time of sunset.
 Tour 1 (The Experience Tour) is the introductory tour and is rec-
ommended for first-time visitors. It is also the least strenuous tour,
but a sign at the boarding entrance to the bus warns that there are
150 steps to climb on this tour. It focuses on the opulent ground-
floor rooms in Casa Grande, as the main house is called, including
the movie theater, where you’ll see a few minutes of Hearst’s home
movies (starring more than a few famous faces). Speaking of
movies, the giant iWERKS film in the National Geographic Theater
is included in this tour (see the “Keeping busy between trips to 
the top” section later in this chapter). You’ll also see the art-filled
gardens and some of the luxurious guest quarters in the 18-room
Casa del Sol guesthouse.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
292

 Tour 2 should be called the Kitchens and Bathrooms Tour. It con-
centrates on the private and less formal spaces on Casa Grande’s
upper floors. These rooms include the impressive library (one of
the most memorable rooms in the house), Hearst’s private suite,
the massive and surprisingly modern kitchen and pantry, and
guest rooms with lots of fabulous bathrooms. The stories are great
on this one.
 Tour 3 focuses on the construction of Hearst Castle, which never
really ended. You’ll see a portion of the estate that wasn’t com-
pleted, all of the ten-room Casa del Monte guesthouse, and a wing
of guest suites in Casa Grande that were completed in Hearst’s final
years and show the castle’s most modern face. Great for anybody
interested in the story behind the design and construction of the
house.
 Tour 4 runs only between April and October, and it’s a good one. At
the heart of this tour is a detailed overview of the gardens and
grounds, including a hidden terrace that was never completed and
only recovered during restoration. You’ll also see more of the
Neptune Pool building; Casa del Mar, the largest and most eye-
popping of the guesthouses; and the wine cellar. Be aware that this
tour does not visit any of the interiors of the main house.
For each tour, a bus takes you on the 15-minute ride up the hill from the
visitor center to the castle and back. You cannot linger at the castle on
your own or wait for your next tour there. No matter how many tours
you take in a day, you must return to the visitor center each time and
ride the bus back to the top of the hill with your tour group, so allow at
least two hours between tours when you buy your tickets. All tours
involve a good deal of walking, including climbing between 150 and 400
steps, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes.
Specialty tours worth considering
Evening Tours are held most Friday and Saturday nights in spring and
fall, and usually nightly around Christmas. This 21⁄4-hour tour is a real
gem, and worth the extra money (see the “Getting tour tickets” section
later in the chapter) and the extra stairs. The illuminated tour offers all
the castle highlights from Tours 1, 2, and 4, and features docents in
1930s period costume who wander the grounds and occupy the rooms.
These living-history players, plus the stories told during the tours about
the famous visitors to the castle, provide the closest glimpse of what life
may have been like in Hearst’s day. In December, when the house is
decked out for Christmas, it’s pure magic. Don’t miss this tour if it’s
offered.
Accessibly Designed Tours for persons with limited mobility are offered
at least three times a day and cover the ground floor of the main house
as well as the castle gardens and grounds. Book at least ten days in
advance by calling % 800-444-4445.
Chapter 20: Hearst Castle and Cambria 293

Selecting the tour that’s right for you
We recommend that you take two of the four standard one-and-three-
quarter-hour tours; this way, you can see a few different views of the
estate without being overwhelmed. You can easily suffer from museum
overload here, however — all the over-the-top excesses can really start
looking the same after a while. Taking in two tours and the other castle
attractions makes for quite a full day.
Because you pay for each tour individually, you may want to spread
your castle visit over two half-days, especially if you quickly tire of walk-
ing, crowds, or theme-park-like bureaucracy. We strongly suggest this
approach if you decide to take more than two tours.
Getting tour tickets
Tickets for the daytime tours are $24 for adults and $12 for kids 6 to 17.
The Evening Tour is $30 for adults and $15 for kids. Children younger
than 6 are free. Prices are a few bucks cheaper during the off-season.
Booking your tour tickets in advance is always a good idea. You can buy
tickets right at the visitor center, but you have no guarantee that they’ll
be available — a day’s slate of tours can easily sell out. You pay no fee
for advance reservations, and you can make them from one hour to
eight weeks in advance. Call the California State Parks reservations
line at % 800-444-4445, where a knowledgeable operator can assist
you. Ask about packages that include big-screen movies at the new
National Geographic Theater (see the following section). You can also
order tickets via the Internet at www.hearstcastle.org. If you’re order-
ing tickets from outside the United States, call % 916-414-8400, ext.
4100. If you need more information, call % 805-927-2020.
Keeping busy between trips to the top
You’ll find plenty to keep you busy at the visitor center before, after, and
in between tours. In addition to an observation deck offering a good
view of the Enchanted Hill, two gift shops, and food vendors (think ball-
park variety and you’ll get the picture), the center also includes a sur-
prisingly good small museum. In addition, visitors can learn more about
the castle’s history, art, and architecture, and even touch examples of
the materials used in the construction of the estate at the permanent
William Randolph Hearst Exhibit.
The center’s newest attraction is Hearst Castle Experience National
Geographic Theater (% 805-927-6811; www.ngtheater.com). In this
theater, you can watch larger-than-life films, including the 40-minute
Hearst Castle: Building the Dream and other films in five-story-high
iWERKS format (just like IMAX) with seven-channel surround sound.
Shows begin every 45 minutes throughout the day. The movie is
included in the price of Tour 1, but if you want to take one of the other
tours and still see the movie separately, it’s going to cost you $8 for
adults, $6 for kids 6 to 17.
Part IV: The Central Coast 
294

Hitting the Central Coast Beaches
Just across Highway 1 from the entrance to the Hearst Castle Visitor
Center is W. R. Hearst Memorial State Beach. This pleasant day-use
beach is generally too cold for swimming, but picnic tables, barbecues,
and bathrooms make it perfect for in-between- or after-tour picnicking.
You can even do some fishing. Look for whales offshore in winter.
Just north of San Simeon is a wonderful vista point called Piedras
Blancas where you can watch elephant seals doing their natural thing
up close and personal, frolicking and sunning themselves on the rocks
year-round. If you have questions about these creatures, don’t hesitate
to ask the docents on hand. Finding this beach is easy — just stop at
the packed parking lot 41⁄2 miles north of the castle and follow the
crowds along the short, sandy walk for a good vantage. Keep your 
distance from these giant mammals, and don’t go beyond the marked
areas — not only is it unhealthy for them but it can be dangerous for
you.
In Cambria, Moonstone Beach is great for strolling and whale-watching
in season. Keep your eye on the sand for the semiprecious jasper stones
that give the beach its name.
Exploring Cambria
Strolling the streets of laid-back Cambria is a pleasant change of pace
after a day of lines and hectic sightseeing at Hearst Castle. This charm-
ing artists’ colony has little more than 4 or 5 blocks to explore, but if
you’re tired of theme-park madness, it’s worth checking out. You’ll find
the area’s best restaurants (see the “Where to Dine” section earlier in
this chapter) and shops, less of the tacky touristy variety and more that
are focused on good-quality crafts.
Before you set out, pick up the Cambria Historical Society’s “Welcome to
Cambria” brochure at your hotel, and take a simple but fun self-guided
tour of the historical buildings in the East Village. You’ll not only get a
history lesson about this quaint village, but you’ll also discover a few
places you may have overlooked otherwise, such as the blacksmith
shop at 4121 Burton Dr., or the Santa Rosa Chapel and Cemetery at
2353 Main St.
The shopping highlight of the West Village is Home Arts, 727 Main St.
(% 805-927-ART1; www.home-arts.com), which boasts an appealingly
eclectic mix of country and contemporary home fashions and gifts.
The East Village has lots of worthwhile stops. Tops among them is
Seekers Glass Gallery, 4090 Burton Dr. (% 800-841-5250 or 805-927-
4352; www.seekersglass.com), a museum-quality art-glass gallery. We
Chapter 20: Hearst Castle and Cambria 295

also love Fermentations, 4056 Burton Dr. (% 800-446-7505; www.
fermentations.com), which serves as a great introduction to the Central
Coast Wine Country through tastings, wine sales, and wine-themed gifts.

C
alifornia wine. It’s not all about Napa Valley, although those pesky
Northern California–centrics may make you think so. The Central
Coast Wine Country is at once the oldest and the newest of California’s
wine-growing areas. The old Franciscan missions strung along the coast,
and just inland by it, attest to the area’s heritage when early Spanish set-
tlers planted grapevines and olive trees. But the area’s wine production
went into decline during Prohibition. After Prohibition was repealed,
Napa and Sonoma valleys shot ahead as the leading and best-known pro-
ducers. But in the last 25 years, the Central Coast has experienced a
boom in grape production and winemaking. Not to mention PR galore in
the form of that little indie movie, the Oscar-nominated Sideways, which
bypassed higher-profile Napa for the setting of its idyllic and socially
complicated wine-tasting weekend.
With the new growth in winemaking has come general growth, much 
of it geared to visitors. A wide range of hotels and spas, golf courses,
restaurants, art galleries, museums, antiques stores, and even a Vegas-
style casino means an array of recreational options. We have to say that
we hope the boom slows down now, because this region is one of the
few unspoiled parts of California; far be it from us to deny anyone their
creature comforts, but it would be a shame to see the area go down the
high-end development road to Genericville. Little of this area — except
perhaps for the bakeries in Solvang — will thrill your kids, but adults
will be pleased by the pace and beauty of the region, and understand
why California has become such a mythic place in the collective cul-
tural mind.
The principal parts of the Central Coast Wine Country are Paso Robles
(the town of this name and the surrounding countryside), San Luis
Obispo (again, the town of the same name plus the nearby areas of Edna
Valley and Arroyo Grande), and northern Santa Barbara County (the
Santa Maria and Santa Ynez valleys). The great news for visitors is that

the areas, while distinctly different, are sufficiently close enough
together to make visiting all, or parts of all, practical on even a short
timetable. And staying in Paso Robles or San Luis Obispo is also a con-
venient option for visiting Hearst Castle (see Chapter 20), offering more
to do (or, at least, more to drink) than quaint Cambria.
Timing Your Visit
Like the rest of the Southern California coast, there is no bad time to
visit in terms of weather. It’s almost always sunny, but not too hot. Some
summer days are toasty in Paso Robles or Santa Ynez as you go farther
inland, but you can always escape to the coast.
The real issue in timing is crowds. Summers and weekends are popular
with visitors. Numerous festivals and other events also attract large
numbers. Room rates go up during high-volume periods, and two-night
minimums are common on summer weekends. The various local tourist
centers and winegrowers associations will supply information on calen-
dars of events.
Although crowded, one of the various local wine festivals may be the
perfect option for you. These festivals offer the opportunity to sample a
lot of different wines in a short time with a good chance of meeting the
winemaker or vineyard owner. Plus you’ll often find related music and
food activities that just add to the fun.
The Santa Ynez Valley is geared for tourism, and certain times are busier
than others. Definitely call in advance if you plan to stay on weekends.
The towns get very crowded from June to October, when the Pacific
Conservancy of the Performing Arts (PCPA; % 805-922-8313; www.
pcpa.org) presents outdoor theater, including comedies, dramas, and
musicals, at the Solvang Festival Theatre.
The festivities go on year-round, but things really pick up when the apples
are ready for picking from August to October. Come for Solvang Danish
Days (late Sept), the annual Celebration of Harvest (mid-Oct), Winterfest
Celebration (month of Dec), and other minifests that the visitor bureaus
will be happy to tell you about. Contact the Santa Ynez Valley Visitors
Association (% 800-742-2843; www.santaynezvalleyvisit.com) or the
Solvang Conference & Visitors Bureau (% 800-468-6765; www.solvang
usa.com) for more festival information.

(230 miles south). It’s about 30 miles from Paso Robles to San Luis
Obispo and about 100 miles to Santa Ynez in northern Santa Barbara
County. Another 35 miles farther south is the city of Santa Barbara. (See
“The Central Coast” map on p. 299.)
The only convenient way to tour in this area is by car. No public-transit
system connects all the localities, and many of the more interesting winer-
ies are inaccessible except by car. If you don’t want to drink and drive,
you can take advantage of the readily available group tours and car serv-
ices. Local winegrowers associations can offer recommendations.
To reach the Santa Ynez Valley from the north, take Highway 101 to
Highway 154 at the artist colony of Los Olivos. Tiny Ballard lies 3 miles
south off Baseline Road. The turnoff for Solvang is just beyond, west on
Highway 246, while a straight jaunt on Highway 154 will take you through
the spectacular San Marcos Pass and on to Highway 101 toward Santa
Barbara, Los Angeles, and Hollywood.
From the south, take Highway 154 off Highway 101 at Goleta (just north
of Santa Barbara), up through the San Marcos Pass. A turn west on
Highway 246 takes you into Solvang; continuing along Highway 154 takes
you through Los Olivos and onto Highway 101 toward Cambria.
And why do we keep pushing the San Marcos Pass? Because it offers
some of the most stunning vistas in the southern half of the state. Of
course, if a two-lane highway with an arch bridge makes you nervous,
this may not be the route for you, but then you’d miss the Los Padres
National Forest; sparkling Cachuma Lake, with the chance to see eagles
and hawks soaring overhead; and the varied views (the road changes
from 2,200 ft., dropping down to sea level) of sun-dappled fields, grazing
herds, and craggy hills on this 15-minute detour. Plus, in the spring,
wildflowers, especially the golden California poppy and purple lupine,
erupt in startling displays of bold, clashing colors (don’t pick them,
there’s a stiff fine!).
But if you’d prefer a more sedate route, simply bypass the pass from the
north by taking Highway 154 to Highway 246 through Solvang, then on to
Highway 101; and from the south by doing the reverse. You’ll have
missed some of the most glorious, glowing scenery in the state, so we
definitely recommend that you take the pass; you’ll be glad you did.
Paso Robles
Arriving in downtown Paso Robles (Pass-o Ro-bulls) is like taking a step
back in time and right into a movie set. The main town square is sur-
rounded by blocks of Victorian-era commercial buildings, so it looks like
every single idyllic small town in every Hollywood movie ever. The city
park is home to the public library, a neoclassical building from 1907 and
a good place to start your visit before heading out into the rolling hills
and broad valleys covered with vineyards.

Orienting yourself
Central Paso Robles sits adjacent to Highway 101 with clearly marked exit
signs. Leading out of the central area on the east side of Highway 101 is
Highway 46 East. South down Highway 101, you’ll find Highway 46 West.
Along these two roads are numerous wineries and lots of wonderful
scenery. Highway 46 West also leads to Hearst Castle some 40 miles away.

Paso Robles Inn
$$–$$$
Paso Robles
This historic inn is within walking distance of downtown shopping and
dining. Lush gardens (complete with oaks, brooks, and waterfalls) sur-
round the low Monterey-style buildings. Many rooms (some larger and
more recently renovated than others) have fireplaces, and some offer “hot
springs therapy” in the form of a Jacuzzi tub outside the room that pumps
in the (slightly sulfur-smelling) mineral water that runs beneath the inn
(excellent for your skin). Grounds include a regular pool, a salon, and a fit-
ness room. They also have a nifty restored vintage 1940s coffee shop.

suites done in blue best), and have a DVD and VCR, satellite dish, high-
speed Internet access, Jacuzzi tubs (in most), wood-beamed ceilings, the
occasional fireplace, and kitchenettes. They also offer in-room spa treat-
ments. Despite the beauty, what’s offered may not be worth the rack rates,

San Luis Obispo
The locals call this lively, artsy, small city “SLO.” At the intersection of
Highway 101 and State Highway 1, the town has a young and vibrant
atmosphere thanks in part to the presence of California Polytechnic
University–SLO (Cal Poly, for short), not to mention the unrepentant (and
we mean that in the best of ways) hippie culture. The central section of
town features restored historic buildings now converted to retail and
restaurants, many of which back up to a park with a slow-flowing stream.
Part IV: The Central Coast

Orienting yourself
Central SLO is well marked with exits from Highway 101. Ample parking
is available on the streets and in city lots. The area is easy to explore on
foot. National chain stores sit side-by-side with local shops.
To head for the Wine Country, take Broad Street or follow the signs to
the airport. Broad becomes Edna Road, which leads into Edna Valley and
Arroyo Grande. Wineries are well marked.
Where to stay
Madonna Inn
$$–$$$$$
San Luis Obispo
A beloved Central Coast landmark for nearly 50 years, this engaging and
fall-down-laughing inn offers 108 rooms, each with its own theme and color
scheme. The Caveman room is the height of ludicrous kitsch, the walls and
ceiling done to look like, well, a cave, with fur bedspread and so forth.
Don’t get us started on the room with a waterfall and the ones that look like
bordellos. We can’t talk about any of it with a straight face. It’s the ultimate
in (and perhaps the first) fantasy hotel, and it’s every bit as hilarious as
you can hope. The best rooms (the ones where the themes are laid on the
heaviest) are the most expensive, and usually booked up far in advance.
It’s an experience you must have once, but come with the right attitude
and don’t expect the Four Seasons (even though the place is quite pretty
and service very friendly). Spa services and golf are available.

Evoking the charms and colors of Provence (they overdo the theme a bit),
this B&B is so fresh and clean and sweet that we’re total suckers for it all.
From the cobblestone courtyard to the 16 distinct rooms (queens smaller
than kings, but none are huge), it’s just adorable. We like the style of the
Van Gogh room and the celery green of the Herbs de Provence room. They
discourage bringing children younger than 12.

North Santa Barbara County
North Santa Barbara County presents a picturesque blend of Arabian
horses standing beside pristine vineyards, rolling pastures dotted with
spreading oaks, graceful Victorian farmhouses and barns beside cutting-
edge wineries, all surrounded by imposing mountains. The results are
soothing and intriguing.
Orienting yourself
Highway 101 runs down the region roughly from north to south. In the
north is the Santa Maria Valley, which spreads out around the town of the
same name. To the south is the Santa Ynez Valley, which is further divided
into the Los Alamos Valley and the Santa Rita Hills. The towns and farms
don’t really have visually distinct boundaries: It all blurs together grace-
fully. Fortunately for the visitor, the pace of traffic is slow, and the friendly
residents are always handy with directions. Six towns make up the urban
side of the Santa Ynez Valley, and they lie within a 10-mile radius.
Buellton, on Highway 246 is the southernmost. Solvang, just 3 miles
northeast from Buellton, is the largest tourist draw; Highway 246
becomes Mission Drive, the town’s main thoroughfare. To get to Ballard
from Solvang, take Highway 246 (Mission Drive) to Highway 154 and turn
west on Baseline. Or follow Alisal Road out of town, where it meets
Part IV: The Central Coast  
304

Alamo Pintado Road; Ballard lies east on Baseline off of Alamo Pintado.
Staying on Alamo Pintado takes you past many wineries and drops you
in the heart of Los Olivos, on Grand Avenue.
Los Alamos, tied with Ballard for the teensiest-town award, is reached
by taking Highway 154 north to Highway 101; you’ll pass through the
town if you’re coming in from the north on Highway 101. Eponymous
Santa Ynez lies east of Solvang on Highway 246.

Ballard
A 15-room inn right in the center of Wine Country action. It’s a little too
dully decorated for our tastes — oh, it’s nicely done, don’t get us wrong,
but it doesn’t feel especially imaginative or inspired. But it is pretty, so we
should probably hush up. Breakfast and afternoon wine and appetizers are
included and winery and golf packages are available. Its restaurant is also
well regarded and known for creative country cuisine and a wide selection

down with lavender, the cushy comforters, and other touches such as
complimentary American breakfast, a gratis bottle of wine in each room,
and a free wine tasting for two at the adjoining winery. The inn also boasts
a full spa and a pool. The staff is attentive and devoted.

Stalking the Solvang smorgasbords
While in Solvang, you can always try the smorgasbords, which are, um, interesting, to
say the least (who knew ravioli was a Danish specialty?). In their desire to please
everyone (read: tourists), the Danish restaurateurs of Solvang have resorted to some
odd smorgasbord choices (such as ravioli and fried chicken) along with the traditional
frikadeller (meatballs), medisterpolse (sausages), and rodkaal (warm pickled red cab-
bage). And herring. Pickled herring to go with the pickled cabbage and pickled beets.
Herring in mustard sauce, herring in a scary, sweetish red sauce. And then more pick-
led foodstuffs (which are all very traditional, given the long winters in Denmark), sand-
wich meats, creamed cold peas, pasta salad, green salad, fruit salad, cheese — sort
of a potluck that nonplussed us. But if you can’t say no to a buffet, then go for it at Bit
O’Denmark, 473 Alisal Rd. (% 805-688-5426; lunch $11, dinner $14, children 10 and
younger $6.95; open daily 11 a.m.–9 p.m.), the New Danish Inn, 1547 Mission Dr. (% 805-

Copenhagen Dr. (% 805-688-6610; lunch $11, dinner $13; open Mon–Sun 8 a.m.–8 p.m.),
owned by the Olsens of bakery fame. All restaurants serve sandwiches and regular
food as well as the Danish all-you-can-eat specialty; most post their menus outside to
help with your choice. And ask to look at the smorgasbords; you may see something
you can’t resist!

It’s really up to Los Olivos (pop. 3,800) and the quaint town of Solvang
(“more Danish than Denmark” is the oft-heard local mantra) to provide
most of the entertainment during your trip to the valley. And they do
make an effort, and for the most part succeed. A good thing, too:
Solvang alone sees over a million tourists a year.
Founded in 1911 by Danish immigrants longing for sunny weather, the
tourist town of Solvang boasts plenty of tourist attractions of the most
leisurely sort, centered on eating and shopping. Free parking! A bakery on
every block! Thatched roofs! Windmills! Cozy shops bursting with needle-
work, clogs, trolls, and quaint handicrafts! Plus plenty of pickled foods
and butter cookies! Flying flags! Hans Christian Andersen! Antiques!
Blooming flowers! Woodcarvings of storks! No litter! The whole town looks
like a Thomas Kinkade painting, so it’s no wonder that America’s most
populist painter has an outlet located on the main drag (Thomas Kinkade
Places in the Heart Gallery, 1576 Mission Dr.; % 805-693-8337). Does all
this sound tourist-tacky kitschy? You betcha! But we direct you to plenty
of classy towns elsewhere in this book, so consider this a change of taste.
Speaking of taste, one of the biggest attractions in Solvang is the conspicu-
ous abundance of baked goods. Oh yes, delectable pastries abound — not
only Danishes (duh) but Sarah Bernhardts, kringles, kransekage, and their
equally salubrious cousins beckon from shop windows, making incredibly
visitor-friendly Solvang a great place to stop for a leg stretch and a sugar
rush between Hearst Castle and Santa Barbara. Olsen’s Danish Village
Bakery, 1529 Mission Dr. (% 800-621-8238 or 805-688-6314; www.olsens
danishbakery.com), is our favorite and justly the most famous. All of
Solvang’s bakeries offer tubs of butter cookies for sale — an excellent
road snack indeed. Go ahead, sample a little from every bakery you can
spot, and see if you concur with our suspicions that they all come from
the same central oven.
Solvang is also full of Danish import shops stuffed with Royal 
Copenhagen collectibles, lace, and carvings. Gerda’s Iron Art Gift Shop,
1676 Copenhagen Dr. (% 805-688-3750); the Royal Copenhagen Shop,
1683 Copenhagen Dr. (% 805-688-6660); and Gaveaesken, 433 Alisal Rd.
(% 805-686-5699), all offer a large selection of china, cookware, pothold-
ers, and cute Danish gift items. Lemos Feed and Pet Supply, 1511-C
Mission Dr. (% 805-693-8180), has the best-ever selection of gifts for pets
and the humans who love them. Antiques fiends will find plenty to admire
and buy at the Solvang Antique Center, 486 First St. (% 805-686-2322),
where over 50 dealers display their collections.
If you’re a thrill-seeker, almost nothing beats a hang glider ride over the
gorgeous valley (Windhaven Glider Rides at Santa Ynez Airport; % 805-
688-2517; www.gliderrides.com). Or for a different kind of frisson, try
your luck at the Chumash Casino, a fully equipped Las Vegas–style
casino on Highway 246 in Santa Ynez (% 877-248-6274; www.chumash
casino.com). We have a certain father who recently gambled there and
loved it.

Santa Barbara County, and the Santa Ynez Valley in particular, have an excellent 
reputation for producing estate-bottled wines and for providing tourists — especially
first-timers — with a nonintimidating wine-tasting experience. Los Olivos Cafe and

your way through the many fine vintages at the Los Olivos Tasting Room & Wine Shop,

bills itself as “consumable art in Los Olivos.”
If you’d prefer to visit wineries, there are more than 80 vineyards in the area, most with
tasting rooms, and all are within a half hour’s drive of each other. Try Firestone
Vineyard, 5000 Zaca Station Rd., Los Olivos (% 805-688-3940; www.firestone
wine.com), the oldest estate vineyard (built by heirs to the Firestone tire fortune) in
Santa Barbara County, with two gold-medal wins for their sauvignon blanc wine. And
yes, hunky “The Bachelor” contestant Andrew is still the sales manager and, appar-
ently, still single.
Sanford, 7250 Santa Rosa Rd., Buellton (% 805-688-3300; www.sanfordwinery.
com), was featured in Sideways when Miles attempts to teach Jack the basics of wine
tasting. The winery has become popular since the movie, so crowds can be a problem,
but the wines are reasonably priced and as overflowing as the crowds with flavor.
Rancho Sisquoc, 6600 Foxen Canyon Rd., Santa Maria (% 805-934-4332; www.rancho
sisquoc.com), offers a cozy wine-tasting experience. The pour list is extensive
(most wineries pour from four to six, but they pour over ten for the same price). The
tasting room is nothing more than a small shack in the middle of a hillside, though with
plenty of picnic tables. The smashing views make this the perfect stop for an after-
noon picnic.
Wildheart Winery, 2933-C Grand Ave., Los Olivos (% 805-688-7386; www.wildheart
winery.com), has a very nice zinfandel. The Vintner’s Festivaloccurs in late April; mid-
October is the Celebration of Harvest.For information, contact the Santa Barbara County
Vintners’ Association (% 800-218-0881; www.sbcountywines.com).
Fans of Sideways have all sorts of options available to help re-create personal favorite
moments. You can take the self-guided tour (www.santabarbaraca.com) or stay at
the Wine Valley Inn, which offers a Sideways vacation package (% 800-824-6444 or
805-688-8824; www.winevalleyinn.com; $145 Sun–Thurs, $440 Fri–Sat), including a
winery tour map, dinner at a Solvang restaurant, movie tickets, wineglasses and a bottle
of wine from the Firestone Winery. The inn also offers a variety of other tour packages,
while Personal Tours LTD can chauffeur you around in style (or in a minivan) as you visit
locations from the movie (% 805-685-0552; www.personaltoursltd.com).

The mission and museums
If you feel the need to wedge some history and culture between bites of
pastries and sips of wine, the valley is the home of the historic, tragic
Mission Santa Ines, 1760 Mission Dr. (% 805-688-4815; www.mission
santaines.org; open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5:30 p.m.), with its interpretive 
display of Chumash, religious, and Spanish artifacts, paintings, and 
documents. Built in 1804, the mission fell into disuse and disrepair after a
series of natural and man-made disasters, but near-divine intervention —
in the form of Capuchin monks — helped resurrect the mission, which
now serves Mass and hosts an annual fiesta in midsummer.
Dedicated to documenting and preserving America’s flora and fauna, the
small and utterly wonderful Wildling Museum, 2329 Jonata St., Los Olivos
(% 805-688-1082; www.wildlingmuseum.org; open: Wed–Sun 11 a.m.–
5 p.m.; $2 donation requested for admission), is solely supported by dona-
tions. Its three rooms offer a changing display of photographs and paint-
ings that depict the history of our vanishing lands and wildlife, and it’s
truly a labor of love.
Both the Hans Christian Andersen Museum, 1680 Mission Dr. (upstairs),
Solvang (% 805-688-2052; open: daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.), and the Elverhoj
Museum, 1624 Elverhoj Way, Solvang (% 805-686-1211; www.elverhoj.
org; open: Wed–Sun 1–4 p.m.), have displays made to delight children,
especially the Elverhoj, which is designed to stimulate children to 
celebrate the life of Denmark’s most famous citizen. Downstairs is the
Bookloft and Kaffe Hus, with a reading area for children.
Adventures with (really cute) animals
Miniature horses supposedly make great house pets, but you may not
want to mention that to your kids until you’re far, far away from
Quicksilver Miniature Horse Ranch, 1555 Alamo Pintado Rd., Solvang
(% 800-370-4002 or 805-686-4002; open: daily 10 a.m.–3 p.m.), because
the things are so darn cute! No more than 34 inches high, these four-
legged Lilliputians can be petted and played with during visiting hours. If
you’re enthralled with full-sized equines, visit Day Dream Arabians, 2065
Refugio Rd., Solvang (% 805-688-9106), for a presentation, tour, and the
opportunity to stroll with and feed the mares and foals.
If you’d rather visit more-exotic animals, call in advance and book a tour
at the Flying V Llama Ranch and Llama Memories Gift Shop, 6615 E.
Hwy. 246, Lompoc (% 805-735-3577; $5 per person, children under 6
free), 61⁄2 miles west of Buellton, and technically just outside of the Santa
Ynez Valley — for a chance to see and pet the gentle, graceful llamas, a
South American relative of the camel. If birds are more your bag, Ostrich
Land, 610 E. Hwy. 246, Buellton (% 805-686-9696), lets you view the 81⁄2-
foot-tall, 350-pound bipeds from a safe distance, and then buy some low-
fat ostrich meat, which surprisingly tastes like — no, not chicken! — beef.

Off the beaten track: Discovering the dunes
California was once rich in dramatic, windswept sand dunes, replete with sheltered
valleys of wildflowers and willows, and lakes full of pond turtles, red-legged frogs,
muskrats, and nesting birds. San Francisco’s dunes are now covered in part by Golden
Gate Park, while Los Angeles’s dunes were leveled to create beach towns and the air-
port. But travelers cruising the coast north of Solvang have a unique opportunity to
visit what’s now a rare sight, by stopping at the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Preserve
just north of the tiny agricultural hamlet of Guadalupe.
The preserve comprises 18 miles of the largest, most biodiverse coastal dune-lagoon
ecosystem on the planet. They have been the subject of photographers including Ansel
Adams and Brett Weston; home to the Dunites, a utopian group of artists founded in 1931;
and the setting for Cecil B. DeMille’s spectacular 1923 film, The Ten Commandments.
Designated by the Nature Conservancy as number one in its “Last Great Places on Earth”
campaign, these dunes are now permanently protected for wildlife and passive recreation.
The Dunes Center interpretative facility, 1055 Guadalupe St., Highway 1, Guadalupe
(% 805-343-2455; www.dunescenter.org), located in a restored 1910 Craftsman-
style home, is open Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. A schedule of
guided walks is available on the Web site.
The Dunes are accessible at the southern end by driving on West Main Street
(Highway 166) to a parking lot just below Mussel Rock Dunes, the highest coastal
dunes in the world. The middle of the dunes are accessible off Highway 1, 3 miles north
of Guadalupe. Turn west onto Oso Flaco Lake Road, pay a small parking fee, and walk
along a rare riparian corridor to a bridge that crosses Oso Flaco Lake. A 1-mile board-
walk leads you to the ocean through one of the best examples of coastal dune scrub
in the country.

Ojai Valley
In This Chapter

 Choosing the best places to stay and dine
 Lounging on the beaches, seeing the sights, and taking in the local culture
 Exploring Shangri-La and its artists colony
L
ooking for the perfect realization of the Southern California dream?
Stop reading now — you’ve found it. If Carmel is the gold standard
of up-coast Golden State beauty (and it is), gorgeous Santa Barbara is
the Southland version. It’s a sleepy, sunny berg, as pretty and sweet as it
can be. And it’s only miles away from another California archetype, the
mystical New Age Shangri-La, Ojai (pronounced oh-high) Valley.
The Jewel of the Coast: Santa Barbara
Santa Barbara has natural assets galore, starting with a unique stretch of
coast: Santa Barbara lies at the foot of the Santa Ynez Mountains on a
narrow strip of coastline that has the singular, jaunty confidence to run
east-west rather than north-south. So even when it’s cool, cloudy, rainy,
or smoggy all over the rest of the region, this Spanish-Mediterranean
beauty tends to sparkle in the sun like the rare jewel it is. (But forgive us
if it’s overcast or foggy when you arrive!) Offshore islands and tide
breaks even keep the Pacific waves calm and under control.
What’s more, this picture-perfect beach hamlet remains unspoiled
thanks to its distance from Los Angeles. Located about 100 miles to the
northwest, it’s a smidgen too far outside the city’s reach to be absorbed
into the megalopolis, even by L.A.’s otherworldly commuting standards.
These idyllic, sun-drenched environs don’t exactly inspire a bustling
business world or low real-estate prices — so don’t quit your job to
move here just yet. Santa Barbara is the self-proclaimed domain of the
“almost wed and almost dead” — mainly college students (at UC Santa

Barbara) and rich retirees who can afford to kick back and go with the
mellow flow. So come join these well-rehearsed relaxees for a little down-
time. You couldn’t pick a better place to do it.
Timing your visit
Any time is a good time to visit Santa Barbara; the climate is mild and
sunny year-round. With temperatures generally hovering between the
low 60s and mid-70s, Santa Barbara has little in the way of an off-season,
and the strolling and sightseeing are great anytime. Still, come before
mid-October for guaranteed beach time and perpetual sunshine, avoid-
ing weekends in summer and fall to miss the capacity crowds.
Plan on staying two nights to enjoy Santa Barbara at the pace that it 
warrants — slow. Give yourself the two-days/three-nights combo if you’re
planning to park yourself on the beach for an extended period or venture
into the surrounding Wine Country. Unless you really need some serious
relaxation time, the town can get a bit stale after a few days.
If you’re traveling with kids, Santa Barbara is family-friendly enough, but
teens may well be bored, while the little ones would prefer plenty of beach
time.
Getting there
Santa Barbara is 134 miles southeast of Hearst Castle, 35 miles southeast
of Solvang, and 102 miles northwest of Los Angeles. U.S. 101 is the fastest
and most direct route to Santa Barbara from points north or south. The
highway runs right through town.
Attention, southbound travelers: For a scenic detour that will add no
more than a few minutes to your drive, pick up the San Marcos Pass
(Highway 154) near Los Olivos, about 35 miles northwest of Santa
Barbara. Highway 154 offers a gorgeous peek at ranchlands and forests
before depositing you back onto U.S. 101 just north of Santa Barbara.
Chapter 21 has a few more details on this route.

Most of the major car-rental companies have an airport location in Santa
Barbara. See Chapter 7 for help with renting a car.
You can also catch a ride with Yellow Cab (% 805-965-5111), Rose Cab
(% 805-564-2600), or Checker Cab (% 805-560-8284), which usually
have cabs lined up outside the terminal. Expect the fare into downtown
Santa Barbara to cost $20 to $25, plus tip. If, for some reason, no cab is
on hand, call Yellow Cab or Checker Cab and they’ll send one right over.
Rose Cab schedules advance pickups only with 24 hours’ notice.
Before you pay for a taxi, find out whether your hotel offers complimen-
tary shuttle service.
Riding the rails
Amtrak (% 800-USA-RAIL; www.amtrak.com) offers daily service to
Santa Barbara along its San Diegan and Coast Starlight routes. Trains
arrive at the Amtrak station at 209 State St., just 2 blocks from the beach
(% 805-963-1015). Taxis are usually available, or you can pick up the
electric shuttle (see the following section).
Orienting yourself and getting around
Downtown Santa Barbara is laid out in a grid and is easily navigable
(see the “Santa Barbara” map on p. 316) — although keep in mind that
the coastline here generally faces south. When you’re taking in a
romantic ocean view, you’re likely gazing in the direction of Santa
Monica, not Hawaii, as you may think, which can make directions con-
fusing. Restaurant- and boutique-lined State Street is the main drag. It
runs perpendicular to the coastline — which means it goes north-
south — and serves as the east-west dividing line: Ortega Street, for
example, is East Ortega to the east of State Street, West Ortega to the
west. Cabrillo Boulevard runs along the ocean and separates the city’s
beaches from the rest of the town.
Even if you drive into town, you may want to leave your car parked for
the duration of your stay, because parking can be tough to find down-
town, and weekend traffic can be a nightmare.
Santa Barbara is a joy for strollers, and most attractions are easily reach-
able on foot. A popular method for exploring the coast is by bike or
surrey (see the “Hitting the beaches” section, later in this chapter, for
rental information). Taxi companies such as Yellow Cab, Rose Cab, or
Checker Cab (see the “Getting there” section earlier in this chapter) can
get you from your hotel to dinner and back again, or wherever else you’d
like to go.
Another option is to hop aboard the Downtown-Waterfront Shuttle.
These electric shuttles run along State Street every ten minutes and
Cabrillo Boulevard every half-hour daily from 10:15 a.m. to 6 p.m. The 
visitor-friendly shuttles are foolproof; you can pick them up at designated
Part IV: The Central Coast  
318

stops every block or two along each route. The fare is 25¢ (free for kids
younger than 5); if you’d like to transfer to the other line at the junction of
State and Cabrillo, ask the driver for a free transfer. For more information,
call the Metropolitan Transit District (MTD) at % 805-MTD-3702 or the
visitor center at % 805-965-3021, or go online to www.sbmtd.gov.
A valuable reference source is www.santabarbaracarfree.org with
information about every way to access Santa Barbara without driving.
Walking tours, information about bicycle rentals, links to all sorts of
tours, bus maps and schedules, and more are all here.
Where to stay
Santa Barbara isn’t a big city by any means, but you may want to decide
where your emphasis will be — shopping and strolling or beach-going? If
the former, you want a hotel or B&B (and there are many adorable ones
to choose from, in addition to the ones listed in this section) near State
Street. If it’s the latter, we list a number of hotels on Bath Street, each
within 2 blocks of the sand. If you’ve just turned up in town without a
reservation (generally not a good idea), walk those 2 blocks and go from
hotel to hotel — with one exception noted in this section, which we love,
and the Coast Beach Inn, which we do not recommend and have not
listed, the hotels along this street are interchangeable enough that the
place that gives you the best price is where you should stay.
Santa Barbara is so hugely popular as a weekend destination that every
lodging in town can be fully booked, so make your arrangements well in
advance if your visit includes Friday and Saturday. If you’re coming
between May and October, book even a midweek stay as far in advance
as possible. You pay the highest rates during the summer season (mid-
May through mid-Sept at most hotels). If you can’t get a room on short
notice, consider nearby Solvang (see Chapter 21).
Two free reservations services, Hot Spots (% 800-793-7666; www.hot
spotsusa.com) and Coastal Escapes (% 800-292-2222; www.coastal
escapes.com), can refer you to other reliable properties in the area if
the accommodations listed in this section are full. Hot Spots also main-
tains a walk-in center at 36 State St., between Cabrillo Boulevard and
Mason Street, but we strongly recommend having reservations before
you come to town.
Be aware that most places require a two-night minimum stay on week-
ends. And expect an extra 12 percent in taxes to be tacked on to your
hotel bill at checkout time.
Bacara Resort and Spa
$$$$$
Santa Barbara
The poshest and ritziest resort around, the Bacara is too high profile not
to discuss here, but approach it with caution. Certainly, it’s a jewel — at
least, on the surface. Located a good 20 minutes outside of Santa Barbara
Chapter 22: Santa Barbara and the Ojai Valley 319

proper, on its own isolated 78 acres (nice employees are available around
the clock to drive you about in golf carts if the distances are too great for
you), situated so that it has a drop-dead-gorgeous view of the ocean, this
Spanish-style resort is a knockout. The resort offers three infinity-style
pools, the grounds are landscaped to a fare-thee-well, and a beach is just
a short hop down a dirt path. Rooms (some with fireplaces, some with
extraordinary beach or grounds views, and some stuck at ground level that
seem all too cavelike) are a fresh and clean combo of Provençal, Spanish,
and beach styles, all blues and whites and gleaming wood, while wood
shutters separate the sunken tub and the rest of the bathroom, so you may
choose to lounge in bubbles and watch TV. In spite of these amenities, we
noticed a great deal of plaster chipped from outside walls and scuff marks
on room walls. And visitors are hit with plenty of extra charges (at this
rate, can’t they at least make the DVDs free?); the isolation may mean
romance and privacy but also a reliance on the resort’s pricey restaurants
or else a bit of a drive into Santa Barbara.

Bath Street Inn
$$–$$$$
Santa Barbara
Bath Street Inn is a top choice if you’re a value-minded B&B lover, which
means none of the 12 immaculate rooms in this Queen Anne–style
Victorian (and not-as-old annex) is as fancy or as tasteful as the higher-
priced B&Bs around. But each room has its own charms, be it a claw-foot
tub, a gas Franklin stove, or a sliver of an ocean view in the distance. Even
the smallest room has more space than other “cozy” accommodations.
The main house has three stories, so if you have mobility challenges,
choose the annex, which comes with more modern amenities, such as gas-
burning fireplaces and Jacuzzi jet tubs. Some kind of snack (such as wine
and cheese or homemade cakes and cookies) is available around the clock,
the kind of attention to detail that 30 years in the inn business (the cur-

Casa Del Mar
$$–$$$$
Santa Barbara
This establishment calls itself a bed-and-breakfast, but the breakfast is just
a well-stocked continental affair. Overall, it’s smaller than some of the
other hotels in these couple of beach blocks, with rooms that suffer from
“attack of the motel-room furniture.” Otherwise, rooms are livened up with
tile fireplaces and floors, some also have balconies, and many have sepa-
rate sitting areas. You can find free copies of the Los Angeles Times and

Saveur magazine in the lobby, plus afternoon wine-and-cheese receptions.
The inn accepts pets with some restrictions.

Eagle Inn
$$–$$$$
Santa Barbara
This inn is friendly, full of vivid murals, and with an overall spiffy Spanish
remodel, which of course doesn’t extend to the rooms, but here the color
scheme and the hotel generic furniture do not clash. All rooms are gener-
ously sized, except for the ones with queen beds, and most have either a
balcony, a gas fireplace, a kitchen, or a whirlpool tub. Bathrooms are also
prettier than at many others in the area.

El Prado Inn
$$–$$$
Santa Barbara
Full disclosure: Author Herczog is married to the family who owns this
hotel, and author Tevis has been friends with that same family since
infancy. Nepotism aside, there is much to recommend the El Prado. Start
with a basic hotel (one regularly upgraded and renovated for additional
guest comfort, earning a AAA three-diamond rating), albeit one that is
family owned and operated — which translates to friendly and personal
service — and add nice touches like a good continental breakfast, after-
noon cookies, and even lobby mascots (one cat, one dog). Then there’s
the location, which is hard to beat for downtown accessibility: 3 blocks
from the Arlington Theater and the start of the main State Street action, 8
blocks from the bustling Paseo Nuevo, and 15 blocks from the beach.
Rooms are clean and large, and the pool area is most pleasant (we love
that the hills loom as a backdrop). Insider tip: Ask for manager specials
for even lower prices.

Four Seasons Biltmore
$$$$$
Montecito
Built in 1927 and spread over 19 luxuriant acres, this Spanish Revival
resort is the place to stay if you’re looking to experience the American
Riviera in its full, four-star glory. You won’t want for anything here. The
hotel includes 213 sumptuous rooms (including 12 cottages), amenities
galore, and resort dining at its best. On the downside, the beach is not for
swimming, and downtown is a ten-minute drive away. But at a resort as
fab as this one, who wants to leave? Beginning in July 2007, guest will be

and a full-service salon with spa treatments provides nonstop pampering.
Kids are pampered, too, with bedtime milk and cookies, video-game units,
and a “Kids for All Seasons” program, which offers organized activities,
such as swimming, arts and crafts, and a painting jamboree.

Franciscan Inn
$$–$$$
Santa Barbara
This lightly Spanish-styled upscale motel has a light teal-and-mauve lobby
color scheme that unfortunately extends to the slightly musty rooms,
where it clashes like crazy with the wood furniture. Nevertheless, it’s way
better than you’d expect for the money. All rooms have VCRs and free HBO.
Spend a slight amount more for one of the spacious suites, some of which
have full kitchens and thus are terrific for families. The grounds have a nice
heated pool and Jacuzzi, plus a coin-op laundry. Movie rentals are free. The
staff is terrific, and West Beach is a block away. Book well ahead.

Harbor House Inn
$$–$$$
Santa Barbara
By far the best option on the hotel-heavy blocks of Bath Street, this hotel
has only ten rooms, but new owners stripped the rooms of icky wallpaper
and repainted in soft colors, and then filled the rooms with all sorts of
refurbished and gorgeous antiques (many of which belonged to their
grandmother). The results are striking, such a change from the cookie-
cutter hotel rooms around town, and in very good taste. We absolutely
love the charming and tasteful Room 4, which includes some particularly
lovely antiques. Most rooms have small kitchens. Free wireless Internet
access throughout the property makes up a bit for the lack of a pool. Add
in a welcome breakfast basket full of unusual goodies, plus the best prices
in the nearby couple of blocks, and no wonder locals who put up their own
families here begged us not to reveal their secret. We’re sorry. We only
hope that if business here gets overwhelming, some of the other hotels
will follow their lead and rethink their looks.

Harbor View Inn
$$$$–$$$$$
Santa Barbara
It’s pricey, but it’s worth the splurge if you’re looking for something special
by the sea. The hotel is built hacienda-style, like a mini Biltmore in the heart
of town (and facing a better beach, no less). The gorgeous, contemporary-
styled rooms are big enough to host a cocktail party; and all boast granite
bathrooms (some with oversize tubs) and patios or balconies. Ocean views
are expensive, but you won’t need one to be happy here. On-site are a
restaurant, a gym, and a lovely pool.

Marina Beach Motel
$$
Santa Barbara
It’s a mere 37 steps to the beach from this button-cute motel — just ask
the friendly owners, who’ve turned the step-count into their biggest sell-
ing point. This is another very good Santa Barbara motel bet. Rooms are
spotless, and country/beachy touches save them from the budget dol-
drums. More than half have full-size kitchens at no extra charge, so ask for
one when you book. Amenities include lovely tropical gardens, but no
pool. Bicycles are on hand for your use. Children stay free, and cribs are
available.

Santa Barbara
AAA’s only five-diamond B&B (in all of North America!) is simply spectacu-

1874 Victorian oasis feels like a world unto itself. Rooms are decorated to
perfection and overflowing with luxuries, including the homemade cake that
greets your arrival. Some of the main-house rooms have space issues (what

with being converted maids’ quarters, complete with closets turned into
bathrooms). We adore the Greenwich, Abbywood, and Plumstead cottages
(the latter is two stories) with their river-stone wood-burning fireplaces, soft
beds, and big oval Jacuzzi tubs — utterly romantic. The Tack room (in the
former barn — note the grooves left behind by horses chewing on the walls)
is somewhat manly, perfect if you prefer a more spare style with plenty 
of space. The staff provides concierge-style service, and an evening 
hors d’oeuvres spread makes dinner redundant. Spa services are available,
as are complimentary bikes for tooling around town. Very expensive, but
it’s money well spent if you’re celebrating.

in size), with perhaps a fireplace, Jacuzzi, or patio; a full breakfast (brought
right to your room for breakfast in bed!); a welcoming atmosphere (includ-

Where to dine
Reservations are always a good idea on weekends, year-round, and
weeknights in summer.
If you’re in town for the weekend, consider the all-you-can-eat Sunday
brunch ($55 per person) at the Four Seasons Biltmore (see the “Where
to stay” section earlier in the chapter). This feast is the ultimate in 
elegant pig-outs; trust us, you won’t have to eat for the rest of the day.

range from local thresher shark to flown-in Alaskan king salmon. Outdoor
seating on two sides, but the bar also boasts great harbor views. The only

MEXICAN
This legend reaches well beyond the confines of this small beach town.
People drive just to eat here, which explains why this unassuming taco
shack has earned a whopping 25 (out of a possible 30) rating from the
restaurant bible Zagat — no mean feat for a place where nothing costs over
$6.95. It also explains why the lines are so long — and deceptive. Even a
short line can mean about an hour between you and the delivery of your
food. Portions are small, so order generously — but at these prices, you
can afford to. The prices also make this a good family-friendly choice. The
soft tacos are divine, and the weekend brings freshly made tamales. A few
casual tables allow for instant satisfaction. Expect lines.

the same bargain it was.) Tacos (on house-made tortillas) come either soft
or hard, with steak filling the former only. In addition to excellent gua-

hearty), beef and chicken alambre, daily specials, and fresh hortas drinks.

demand. The kitchen specializes in an eclectic California cuisine that
makes the most of such ingredients as fresh mozzarella, sun-dried toma-
toes, roasted garlic, and mellow chiles. Salads are clever and include pret-
tily arranged combinations such as grilled eggplant accompanied by
rounds of pizzalike crostini topped with goat cheese. Pizzas are plump
with toppings such as shrimp, pesto, and roasted peppers. Entrees include
lemongrass-crusted salmon in a Thai curry sauce or honey-glazed duck
with a chambord blackberry compote. It’s located little above the main

laya, étouffée, house-smoked andouille sausage, our favorite chicken
Tchoupitoulas (chicken cooked in a Cajun hollandaise sauce), and even
Bananas Foster for dessert (though we prefer the pastry swan filled with
ice cream, floating on a lake of warm chocolate). Saturdays bring a sax
player and a singalong rendition, complete with toasting of Louis’s “What
a Wonderful World.” Free valet parking is a nice plus, as are baskets of
warm muffins. Note: The owners also own the Palace Express, which offers
a simpler, cheaper version of the menu, in the Paseo Nuevo.

A lovely, utterly marvelous establishment, perhaps the best restaurant in

English cheddar soufflé, silky Hudson Valley foie gras, venison with maple-
glazed garnet yams, and roast pork with potato-apple-onion purée. We like
writing about this food so much, we have to mention a few recent offer-
ings, such as sautéed local farmed abalone; roasted arctic char with cau-
liflower griddle cake and citrus champagne butter; filet of beef, potato
hash with white cheddar sweet corn and bacon cabernet reduction; and a
trio of appealing desserts; liquid center chocolate cake with pistachio ice
cream, and rhubarb trifle. It’s a natty place but not stuffy, and it would be
a mistake to miss it.

Sojourner Cafe
$
Santa Barbara
HEALTH FOOD
This health-food restaurant has been a local tradition since 1978, but don’t
let that scare you off. The cafe serves meat (just not red meat), and the
food prep has that vital component so often missing from similar places —
namely, flavor (probably because the stuff isn’t low-fat, thank heavens).
One complaint is that menu descriptions do not always accurately depict
what you receive. For example, the Tofu Buddha Salad (“marinated sesame
tofu over rice and greens”) is minced tofu mixed with red cabbage, and
the Greek salad looks different from the usual representatives of that dish.
If your Dijon chicken salad or pan-fried catfish with eggs and papaya-kiwi
salsa arrives in an unexpected form, it will nevertheless be as gorgeous as
you could want. Which, by the way, also describes the adorable staff.

Gouda; the fried green tomatoes; or the lobster and sweet corn chowder.
Try anything, really, as long as you save room for dessert. Though the
menu no longer includes a couple of our favorite desserts, we’ve tried all
the rest (just to maintain quality control) and we have a hard time choos-

Exploring Santa Barbara
For the best and most efficient overview, catch a ride on the Santa
Barbara Old Town Trolley (% 805-965-0353; www.sbtrolley.com).
These motorized red trolleys offer narrated 90-minute tours of the city’s
main sightseeing areas, including State Street, the beachfront, and Santa
Barbara’s mission. It’s a particularly good bet if you’re short on time and
Part IV: The Central Coast  
328

long on curiosity. The fee is $16 for adults, $9 for kids 12 and younger if
you order online; buying them at the trolley stop will run you an extra
two bucks per adults only. The trolley runs daily, and you can pick it up
anywhere along the route. Your ticket allows for on-and-off privileges all
day. Santa Barbara Car Free (www.santabarbaracarfree.org) has
information about other tour companies offering tours around town, sea
and shore nature excursions (whale-watching, kayaking, scuba, hiking,
and more), and trips into the Wine Country and beyond.
Hitting the beaches
Santa Barbara has a terrific collection of beaches. Most are flat and wide,
with calm waters, gorgeous white sands, and lots of blanket space, even
on busy summer days.
 East Beach/West Beach: These sister beaches run as a 2-mile unbro-
ken strip along Cabrillo Boulevard. Stearns Wharf, at the end of State
Street, is the dividing line: The wide white sands to the east of the
pier are East Beach, and those to the west are (you guessed it) West
Beach. West Beach is fine, but East Beach is the real beaut. A grassy
median and a palm-lined bike path separate it from the busy boule-
vard. On Sundays, a local artists’ mart pops up along here. On the
sand are volleyball courts, a picnic area with barbecue grills, good
facilities, and a landmark bathhouse from the 1920s. An excellent
choice, and the best one for families — and free parking is nearby.
Rent bikes, in-line skates, tandems for couples, and four-wheeled sur-
reys to accommodate the whole family at Wheelfun Rentals, just up
from the beach at 22 State St. (% 805-966-6733). Rates are $7 to $35
for the first hour ($12–$60 for three to five hours), depending on the
kind of wheels you want. Beach toys are available for rental, too.
 Leadbetter Beach: On Cabrillo Boulevard just west of the harbor
(turn left past La Playa School), this pretty beach runs to Santa
Barbara Point. Less protected than other beaches, Leadbetter is
popular with local surfers when the waves kick up; fortunately, the
waters generally stay calm for swimmers in summer. A great van-
tage point for watching boats cruise in and out of the harbor, the
facilities include a sit-down cafe and limited free 90-minute parking.
Stay longer and parking is $6 and up for the day.
 Shoreline Park: Long, grassy Shoreline Park sits atop the cliffs just
past Leadbetter Beach. Spectacular panoramic ocean views make it a
marvelous spot for a picnic. A lovely, bench-lined strolling path leads
to neatly kept facilities and a small playground. Parking is free.
 Arroyo Burro Beach County Park (Hendry’s Beach): Arroyo Burro
Beach County Park is well worth the 2-mile drive from downtown.
This narrow but long crescent-shaped beach nestled below the cliffs
feels secluded thanks to its distance from the main road — and its
status as a wetlands sanctuary for shorebirds adds an appealing
natural element. The sands are dark but still lovely, and locals love
Chapter 22: Santa Barbara and the Ojai Valley 329

’em for sunbathing, shelling, and swimming. This beach makes a
great choice for sunset strolling, too. The Brown Pelican restaurant
is here, plus restrooms, showers, and free parking. To get there,
follow Cabrillo Boulevard west as it turns into Shoreline Drive. Turn
right on Meigs Road, then left onto Cliff Drive; go 1 mile and turn left
into the signed lot.
Seeing the county courthouse and other highlights
The county courthouse serves as a great starting point for the Red Tile
Tour, a self-guided walk covering a 12-square-block area of historic
downtown. Pick up the map and brochure at the visitor center (see the
“Gathering More Information” section at the end of this chapter). Allow
one and a half to three hours to see everything along the route.
County Courthouse
In a city of stunning Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, the courthouse
serves as the finest example of the vernacular. Completed in 1929 and
taking up an entire downtown block, the building is utterly magnificent
and well worth a look. You can explore on your own. If the clock tower is
open, you’ll be rewarded for the climb to the observation deck with great
views of the surrounding red-tile roofs and the ocean and mountains
beyond. Don’t miss the courtyard garden. Free guided tours are offered
Monday, Tuesday, and Friday at 10:30 a.m. and Monday through Saturday
at 2 p.m. — but times can vary, so call ahead.

Old Mission, Santa Barbara
Founded in 1786, this majestic hilltop complex is considered the queen
of the California mission chain. Even if you’re not interested in the
Spanish Colonial and/or Native American history of California, it’s well
worth a look — it is, probably, the top photo-op in town! The mission set
the architectural tone for the rest of Santa Barbara and offers spectacu-
lar views all the way out to the Channel Islands. The self-guided tour
includes a cool cemetery.
2201 Laguna St. (at Los Olivos Street, at the north end of town). % 805-682-4149.

free. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

ers, as 5.5 miles of trails wind through indigenous California greenery.

Sunday at 10:30 a.m.

Santa Barbara Museum of Art
This little gem feels like a private gallery — one with works by Monet,
Picasso, Braque, Chagall, Rodin, and other masters. It contains some good
20th-century Californian and Asian art, too, and is well worth an hour. If
you don’t go inside, stop by to examine the mural recently mounted in a
special display along State Street. Be sure to read the thrilling story of its
discovery (the artist, David Alfaro Siquieros, was a very important
Mexican muralist) as part of a Pacific Palisades pool house, and the
absurdly cautious and executed journey to get it to its current display posi-
tion. (Here’s a preview: They had to move the entire pool house.)
See map p. 316. 1130 State St. (at Anapamu Street). % 805-963-4364. www.sb

free for the under-6 set; free for all on Sun. Open: Tues–Sun 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
Santa Barbara Zoo
You’ve probably been told that size doesn’t matter, so consider taking in
this charming, pint-size zoo, one of the best small zoos in the country.
Having undergone some renovations, including the transformation of the
old sea-lion exhibit into a perky penguin party palace, plus lions, elephants
and gazelles, it is ideal stop for little ones. It also is a zoo with a view — the
smashing vista goes on for days. Exploring the attractions here should take
only a couple hours.
See map p. 316. 500 Niños Dr. (east of Milpas Street; turn up Niños from Cabrillo
Boulevard). % 805-962-5339. www.santabarbarazoo.org. Admission: $10
adults, $8 seniors and kids 2–12. Parking: $3. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (arrive before
4 p.m.). Closed Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Experiencing the harbor life
At the end of State Street is Stearns Wharf, a 19th-century vintage pier
that offers great views but is otherwise pretty touristy. Head, instead, to
Santa Barbara Harbor for a genuine look at local maritime life. To get
there, follow Boulevard west, past Castillo Street, and turn left on Harbor
Way.
 Brophy Bros. Clam Bar & Restaurant is a great place to soak in the
atmosphere, not to mention some divine chowder and oysters on the
half shell (see the “Where to dine” section earlier in this chapter).
 If you want to hit the water, Stardust Sportfishing (% 805-963-3564;
www.stardustsportfishing.com) offers half- and full-day sport-
fishing trips. The Santa Barbara Sailing Center (% 800-350-9090 or
Chapter 22: Santa Barbara and the Ojai Valley 331

805-962-2826; www.sbsail.com) has a wide array of excursions,
including dinner cruises, afternoon sailing, and whale-watching
(Feb–May).
 If you’d like to cruise over to Channel Islands National Park, the fleet
at Truth Aquatics (% 805-962-1127; www.truthaquatics.com)
offers hiking, camping, and natural history trips as well as fishing,
diving, and whale-watching.
Shopping ’til you drop
The main shopping area is the Paseo Nuevo, a new mall that was nicely
built to copy the classic State Street Spanish architecture (located on
State Street between Canon Perdido and Ortega streets). You won’t find
many nonchain stores here, but it’s so pretty (splashing fountains, carts
with jewelry, and such) that even usual mall haters don’t mind.
Boutiques abound along State Street and in the offshoot blocks, where
you’ll find such local treats as the Book Den, 15 E. Anapamu St. (% 805-
962-3321; www.bookden.com), a used bookstore.
If you’re an antiques hound, seek out Brinkerhoff Avenue, a block-long
passage 11⁄2 blocks west of State between Cota and Haley streets that
brims with vintage goodies. Most shops along Brinkerhoff are closed
Monday, and they close as early as 5 or 6 p.m. on weekdays.
Also worth seeking out is El Paseo, at 814 State St. (between Cañon
Perdido and De La Guerra Street), a charming arcade lined with boutiques
and galleries that’s reminiscent of an old Spanish street. It also happens to
be the oldest shopping street in Southern California — and is across the
street from the Paseo Nuevo (hence the name).
Touring the local Wine Country
In the past few years, Santa Barbara’s Wine Country has really come into
its own, with local labels achieving national prominence and wineries
attracting visitors from around the world. To explore the local tasting
rooms — which include such familiar labels as Cambria, Firestone,
Meridian, and Au Bon Climat — stop into the local visitor center here or in
nearby Solvang (see Chapter 21) and pick up the brochure and map called
Santa Barbara County Wineries. You can also order a copy by contacting
the Santa Barbara County Vintners Association (% 800-218-0881 or 805-
688-0881; www.sbcountywines.com).
Serene Shangri-La: The Ojai Valley
The Ojai Valley has been known as Shangri-La ever since director Frank
Capra chose the area as the background for his 1947 movie Lost Horizon.
To local Native Americans, the valley had long been a sacred holy place,
Part IV: The Central Coast  
332

but it was Capra who put it on the international map. One look around
this landscape, handsomely tucked into the mountains between Santa
Barbara and Los Angeles, and you’ll understand why everyone who
visits finds it so special. For visitors to Southern California who think the
state consists of nothing but bright lights and big cities, Ojai is the per-
fect soul-soothing antidote.
In the late 19th century, settlers from the East Coast began to arrive in
Ojai in search of a healthful climate — believed to be beneficial for suf-
ferers of everything from allergies to tuberculosis — and spiritual enlight-
enment. Just as the Native Americans believed that the area possessed
sacred qualities, later visitors found the valley (with its unusual east-west
orientation) conducive to certain loftier pursuits.
Those lofty pursuits really took off in 1923 with the arrival of 
J. Krishnamurti, an Indian prophet whose work in combining eastern and
western philosophies marks him as the founder of what would become
the New Age movement. He was later joined by such luminaries as
Aldous Huxley in developing institutions of higher understanding in Ojai.
Those institutions still operate, and you can visit them.
With folks such as Krishnamurti and Huxley in residence, Ojai became a
logical choice for artists and musicians. The famed sculptor Beatrice
Wood, known as the Mama of Dada, moved here in the 1940s, followed
by many other artists. Her studio remains open to the public, as are
those of many other working artists (Wood died in 1998, at age 105). The
annual Ojai Festival, in May of every year, brings together performers
and scholars from all over the world for a series of concerts and sym-
posia celebrating both classical and modern orchestral music.
If you love the outdoors, Ojai offers an unparalleled set of opportunities
for camping, hiking, and mountain biking in Los Padres National
Forest, which borders the northern edge of town. The forest is the
largest in the national forest system and presents countless options for
recreational fun. For a less-active outdoor experience, the scenic beauty
of the Ojai Valley is alone worth the trip. Rising up to 6,000 feet above
sea level at the east end of the valley is the magnificent Topa Topa Bluff.
Every evening as the sun sets, the bluff takes on a remarkable shade of
coral, creating the “pink moment” for which Ojai is famous.
Timing your visit
Ojai is a wonderful place to visit all year long. The summer months of
July, August, and September can be hot (but not as hot as Palm Springs).
The rest of the year is quite pleasant. The city of Ojai is only 16 miles
from the ocean, and sea breezes rising up the valley and cool things off
nicely, especially in the evenings. Weekends are the busiest time, espe-
cially in spring and fall.
Chapter 22: Santa Barbara and the Ojai Valley 333

Getting there
The best way to get to Ojai is by car. Ojai is located 85 miles northeast of
Los Angeles and 35 miles southeast of Santa Barbara, about 15 miles
inland from the city of Ventura.
 From Los Angeles: Take I-5 north to Castaic, then go west on
Highway 126 to Santa Paula, then north on Highway 150 to Ojai; or
go north on U.S. 101 to Ventura, then go east on Highway 33 to Ojai.
 From Santa Barbara: Take U.S. 101 south to Highway 150, which
leads to Ojai.
Orienting yourself and getting around
Ojai is compact and laid out simply along one main road, Highway 150,
also known as Ojai Avenue. In the center of town, the principal shopping
district is clearly distinguishable by the Arcade, a block-long row of
shops with a Spanish Colonial–style colonnade of arches. Ample parking
is located behind the shops. Across the street is Libbey Park, with a
great play area for kids, tennis courts, and the Libbey Bowl, home of con-
certs and plays. Directions to everything else in the valley are generally
given in relationship to the Arcade.
The Ojai Trolley makes a circuit around town (the full ride is about an
hour) and stops at shops, schools, hotels, and more. The service oper-
ates Monday through Friday from 7:15 a.m. to 5:40 p.m. and Saturday
and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Riding the trolley costs 25¢.
Where to stay
Ojai offers a wide range of accommodations, from the most luxurious to
charming and funky to basic and affordable.
Ojai is an extremely popular destination for weekend visitors from all
over Southern California, so make reservations before your arrival if
your visit involves a Friday- or Saturday-night stay. Many of the top
establishments have two-night minimums on weekends, and minimums
or higher rates during important events or festivals. Many offer lower
rates during the week. Ojai is also popular with business travelers, with
substantial facilities for conferences and corporate meetings.

Ojai
One of Ojai’s highlights, this relatively affordable inclusive health-spa ex-

calories per day (!!) and a slate of daily exercise classes, from pool aerobics
to yoga. Spa treatments are available for an additional fee, and it’s all
served up in a bucolic mountain setting. Morning walks through the sweet
town of Ojai and amid surrounding mountains make exercise far more
enjoyable than it ought to be. Rooms vary in size and quality; the ones in
the main house can be quite tiny, while the cottages are plenty large but
have frumpy furnishings. The newer suites are smashing — good furniture,
lovely tile, private patios, Jacuzzi tubs — well worth it if you want the
whole spa pampering experience. Sure, it’s less posh than pricier places,
but it’s also less terrifyingly chic. Real people with real-people thighs are
among the loyal clientele.

addition to being rich in glitz and gloriously fun, Los Angeles
is the state’s ﬁnest museum town — no kidding. The
Disneyland Resort is the original theme park, an unadulter-
ated blast for kids of all ages. San Diego is a sunny, laidback
city with lots of kid-friendly attractions and golden beaches
galore.
Unlike other destinations in this book — which are generally
popular in summer and largely pleasant to visit year-round —
Southern California is fun to visit in any season but summer,
when scorching heat can be a bit much to bear. Still, even on
the most simmering days, you can ﬁnd respite from the heat.
The Palm Springs area is the place to go for desert cool by a
sparkling swimming pool, and if you’re looking for the perfect
day at the beach, head to easy-going Laguna. The fabled mis-
sion at San Juan Capistrano has lush gardens that burst forth
with color, celebrated by a ﬂower and garden festival in June.
And if really hot isn’t hot enough for you, head for the other-
worldly beauty of the state’s desert parks, Joshua Tree
National Park and Death Valley National Park.

W
e love L.A. — we really, really do, but that’s because we know how
to best find and experience its admittedly subtle charms. Yes, it’s
got smog (although increasingly less); yes, it has traffic (alas, more than
ever); and yes, much of the distinctive architecture has been torn down
thanks to an utter disinterest in preservation. And yes, it’s far-flung and
public transportation stinks, so you absolutely have to buck that afore-
mentioned heavy traffic to get anywhere to enjoy anything.
But. Here’s a place where you can surf and ski on the same day. Here’s a
place where your sightseeing will only be enhanced by one of the 350
cloudless days a year. Here’s a place where movie-star footprints are
enshrined, and Gettys give a great deal of money to amass one of the
finest art collections in the world. Here’s a place where you can enjoy
the L.A. Philharmonic (and other internationally known artists) for just a
few dollars (of course, for that price, way up high) out in the fragrant
night air, at the gorgeous Hollywood Bowl. Here’s a place where just a 
1-mile stretch of Hollywood Boulevard peacefully holds Thai, Mexican,
Romanian, Armenian, Vietnamese, and Persian restaurants, all of them
with some of the most wonderful food you’ve ever tasted, for a bargain
price. Here’s a place where weirdness and eccentricity are embraced —
and of course, if you can turn it into a sitcom, so much the better. Here’s
a place where you can grocery-shop right next to the actors who star in
those very sitcoms, just like they were regular folks.
El Pueblo de la Señora, la Reina de Los Angeles (“the city of Our Lady,
Queen of the Angels”) was founded by the Spanish in 1781, but truth be
told, it wasn’t really on the map until the movie folks came out here in
search of outdoor locations that didn’t suffer from snow. By World War I,
the movie business had a hold on the town, and in the 1920s and ’30s,
people came here in droves seeking their fortunes. Very few of them
were discovered sipping sodas in malt shops, a la Lana Turner, but that
didn’t stop anyone from trying.

That crush of people came with cars, and as early as 1940, the Arroyo
Seco Parkway, the first freeway, was opened. The automobile business
solidified L.A.’s total dependence on cars by crushing the then-quite-
handy public transport (the Little Red Cars trolley system). More free-
ways followed, and more people came to work in the thriving aerospace
industry (led by McDonnell Douglas) and the new television industry. It
didn’t help that every year, Pasadena put on the glorious Rose Parade
under inevitably clear blue skies, causing snowbound Midwesterners
and others to throw everything in the car and go to permanently join the
balmy fun. In no time at all, L.A. became an urban sprawl of impossible
dimensions.
And they keep on a’comin’, although a few events have quenched migra-
tion enthusiasm, at least briefly. In 1971, an earthquake measuring 6.2 on
the Richter scale rocked nearby Sylmar, but although it loomed in legend
for more than 20 years, it was nothing compared with the Biggish One,
the Northridge quake (6.8 on the Richter scale) that left nearly 60 people
dead and a portion of the freeway collapsed. Riots in the wake of the
Rodney King verdict shut down the city for several days as homes and
businesses burned and the National Guard came out to restore order.
And then there was O.J.
But thanks to its blessedly short memory, floods, fires, and football 
players haven’t stopped this town. And on one of those clear days —
after the Santa Ana winds have blown away the smog — when the sky is
a memorable blue, the mountains stand out so sharply they seem cut
out of glass, the impossibly blooming bougainvillea flaunts a floozy pink,
the air smells of gardenia, and you’re in your shirt sleeves, enjoying the
sun on your face as you sip some coffee, you think to yourself “It’s
January?” . . . and, well, you may find yourself loving L.A., too.
Timing Your Visit
People are fond of complaining that Los Angeles has no seasons. Sure,
certain flowers bloom all year long, but the seasonal changes are there —
they’re just subtle, that’s all. In the winter, trees are bare (well, not the
palm trees), and spring here looks like spring most anywhere.
If it’s going to rain — and odds are, it won’t, unless another El Niño
snakes its way out of the tropics — it’s most likely going to happen in
spring. Even then, heavy rainstorms are unusual. It can get nippy — oh,
not Minnesota, 40-below nippy — but it can get down in the 20s at night
in winter, so bring a coat. Actually, a light wrap is always a good idea,
thanks to temperatures that can annoyingly flit from 80°F during the day
to 50°F at night. Autumn can bring the Santa Anas, the surprisingly
strong, warm winds that are a bane to firefighters. Note also that the
Westside neighborhoods (Santa Monica, Brentwood, Pacific Palisades,
and even Westwood) can be 20°F (or more) cooler than Hollywood,
Pasadena, and the Valley (the latter two are the hottest places in the city
area). Go figure. Thank the ocean breezes.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
344

Most visitors come in summer, but Los Angeles is pleasant year-round.
Year-round, daytime temperatures seldom drop below the mid-60s, and
nighttime lows waffle between the 40s and 50s (bring a jacket anytime
you come), except during the height of summer, when it stays more
balmy.
Summer comes late to L.A. June is often on the cool side and plagued by
June gloom — morning fog that doesn’t burn off until early afternoon
(and June gloom can actually last into August, especially around the
beach, which doesn’t seem fair at all). On the upside, low humidity and
ocean breezes keep the climate relatively dry and comfortable, even 20
miles inland, in the heat of summer (July, Aug, and well into Sept). The
valleys can get smoggy and miserable on the hottest days — which
means you could end up broiling at Universal Studios — but are other-
wise comfortable.
Winter is a great time for avoiding crowds and escaping the bitter cold
back home. Though the weather will likely be too cool for the beach, the
occasional 80°F day will pop up, and hotel bargains are common (except
at holiday time). And the rain and winds blow away smog and haze, leav-
ing a landscape of such beauty that you suddenly understand why people
live here — and you may even want to join them.
L.A.’s attractions are spread out, and traffic can be horrendous, which
means one of two things:
 You need three full days to get a good overview of the city.
 If you’re not a city person and you know that L.A. is going to get
under your skin quickly (or you just don’t have three full days to
give), you should zero in on where your interests lie, see those
attractions in a day or two, and skedaddle outta town.
Getting There
Los Angeles International Airport, commonly called LAX (% 310-646-
5252; www.lawa.org/lax), is the city’s major gateway, and most likely
where you’ll fly in. LAX is on the ocean south of Marina del Rey at the
intersection of the 405 and 105 freeways, 91⁄2 miles from Santa Monica
and 16 miles from Hollywood. From the airport, it’s approximately a 30-
minute drive to downtown, and a 40-minute drive to West Hollywood,
depending on the traffic.
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport (% 818-840-8840; www.burbank
airport.com) is usually just referred to as “Burbank.” It’s officially Bob
Hope Airport, but call it the “Bob Hope Airport,” and people will look
puzzled. Whatever you call it, it’s 8 miles northeast of Hollywood within
a rough square bounded by the 5, 134, and 170 freeways. Burbank is far
smaller and more manageable than LAX and is definitely the most con-
venient gateway if you’re basing yourself in Hollywood. Most flights
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 345

coming into Burbank arrive from other California cities or nearby cities
like Phoenix and Vegas. From the airport, it’s approximately a 25-minute
drive to downtown and a 20-minute drive to West Hollywood, depending
on the traffic.
Long Beach Airport (% 562-570-2619; www.longbeach.gov/airport)
is a sweet, old-fashioned landing strip with a gorgeous Art Deco terminal
out of which only two domestic airlines fly. It’s tiny and, if there’s no 
traffic, conveniently close — only half an hour away from downtown.
Otherwise, the trip can be stressful and interminable.
All major car-rental companies have branches at these three airports, and
each provides shuttle service between the terminals and its off-site lot.
Getting to your hotel from LAX
If you’re staying in Santa Monica, take Sepulveda Boulevard north and
follow the signs to Lincoln Boulevard/Highway 1 (Pacific Coast Highway,
or PCH) north. To reach West L.A., Beverly Hills, or Hollywood, take
Century Boulevard to I-405 north; Santa Monica Boulevard east is the
likeliest exit, but check with your hotel to be sure.
If you won’t be renting a car at the airport, SuperShuttle (% 310-782-6600
or 323-775-6600; www.supershuttle.com) offers door-to-door shuttle
service. Expect to pay between $15 and $45 (plus tip) for the first person
in your party and $10 to $15 for each additional person, depending on
your drop-off point. Although you don’t need reservations for your arrival,
you must make them at least a day in advance for your return trip to the
airport. Note that you won’t be the only passenger on board, and that the
journey to your destination can take as much as a couple of hours,
depending on how many stops the van has to make along the way.
Taxis line up curbside at each terminal. Expect to pay between $31 and
$40 (plus tip), depending on your destination. All LAX pickups include a
$2.50 surcharge. Taxis can accommodate up to five riders.
Getting to your hotel from Burbank
Follow the signs to U.S. 101 south (the Hollywood Freeway), and exit at
Vine Street for Hollywood hotels; continue south on the 110 to the 10
west if you’re staying on the Westside or at the beach.
SuperShuttle (% 818-556-6600; www.supershuttle.com) offers door-
to-door shuttle service from Burbank; expect to pay $15 plus tip to
Hollywood for the first person in your party and $10 to $15 for each
additional person. Reserve airport pickups and returns in advance. If
you forget, taxis wait outside the terminal. Taxi fare will depend on your
final destination, but expect to pay between $20 and $30 to Hollywood.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
346

Getting to your hotel from Long Beach
Follow the signs to the 405 north, exit on Sunset Boulevard eastbound
for Hollywood. For beach and Westside hotels, take the 405 north to the
10 west.
If you won’t be renting a car at the airport, SuperShuttle (% 310-782-6600
or 323-775-6600; www.supershuttle.com) offers door-to-door shuttle
service. Expect to pay $40 (plus tip) for the first person and $10 to $15 for
each additional person, depending on your drop-off point. Although you
don’t need reservations for your arrival, you must make them at least a
day in advance for your return trip to the airport.
Taxis line up curbside at each terminal. Expect to pay at least $50 (plus
tip) to downtown, $70 to Hollywood, more if there’s traffic. Taxis can
accommodate up to five riders.
Arriving by car
If you’re driving from Santa Barbara and coastal points north, follow U.S.
101 south to I-405:
 For West L.A., Beverly Hills, or West Hollywood, exit at Santa
Monica Boulevard.
 For Santa Monica, pick up I-10 west, which will drop you right at
the ocean.
 If you’re heading to Hollywood, stay on U.S. 101 until it becomes
the Hollywood Freeway (be sure to take the Hollywood
Freeway/U.S. 101 turnoff, or you’ll end up in Pasadena before you
know it). Exit the Hollywood Freeway at Vine or Gower street.
If you’re driving from San Francisco or Monterey and prefer to bypass
the scenic coastal route, follow I-5 through the middle of the state.
Heading south on I-5, you’ll pass a small town called Grapevine, which
marks the start of the Grapevine Pass, a mountain pass that leads you
into the San Fernando Valley and L.A. Take I-405 south to Santa Monica,
West L.A., Beverly Hills, and West Hollywood; for Hollywood, follow I-5
past I-405 to Highway 170 south to U.S. 101 south (this route is called the
Hollywood Freeway the entire way).
From points east, including Palm Springs or Phoenix, take I-10 west,
which dead-ends in Santa Monica. For Hollywood, take I-110 (the Harbor
Freeway) to U.S. 101 (the Hollywood Freeway) north; for West L.A. and
Beverly Hills, follow I-10 to I-405 north.
From Disneyland or San Diego, head north on I-5 (the Santa Ana Freeway).
If you’ve been following along, you’ll know to pick up I-405 north to Santa
Monica, West Los Angeles, and Beverly Hills, and continue on to U.S. 101
for Hollywood.
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 347

Arriving by train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains arrive at Union
Station, 800 N. Alameda St. (% 213-624-0171), on the northern edge of
downtown just north of U.S. 101. From there, you can take one of the
taxis that line up outside.
Orienting Yourself and Getting Around
Los Angeles resides on the flatlands of a huge basin, sandwiched by
mountains and ocean, with downtown L.A. as its midpoint 12 miles east
of the Pacific. The sprawling city includes dozens of neighborhoods and
municipalities that are so complex that even a city planner would need
some serious time to sort it all out. A web of freeways knits everything
together, with the major ones forming a rough box around the area
where you’ll spend your time (see the “Los Angeles’s Neighborhoods”
map on p. 350):
 I-10 (the Santa Monica Freeway) runs east-west from Palm Springs
(actually from Georgia) all the way to within a few miles of the
ocean in Santa Monica.
 Highway 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway, or just PCH), is a standard
four-lane avenue called Lincoln Boulevard from just north of the
airport to Santa Monica, where it turns into a surface highway and
cuts west to hug the coast all the way to Malibu.
 I-405 (the San Diego Freeway) runs north–south through L.A.’s
Westside, roughly parallel to PCH and about 31⁄3 miles inland from
the coast.
 U.S. 101 is the Ventura Freeway as it runs east–west through the
San Fernando Valley (on the north side of L.A.), becoming the
Hollywood Freeway after U.S. 101 takes a sharp turn right, running
northwest–southeast to connect the Valley with downtown L.A.
(The Ventura Freeway continues directly east on California 134.)
 I-110 (the Harbor Freeway) starts in Pasadena (as the Pasadena
Freeway) and runs directly south. You’ll likely use the section that
runs along the western edge of downtown, connecting the
Hollywood Freeway to I-10.
 I-5 (the Golden State Freeway) runs along the eastern edge of
downtown on its way from San Francisco to San Diego.
An underlying grid of surface streets complements the freeways. The
major east–west boulevards connecting downtown to the beaches are,
from north to south, Sunset, Santa Monica, Wilshire, Olympic, Pico, and
Venice boulevards.
Locals refer to L.A. freeways both by their numbers and their names. For
example, I-10 is both “the 10” and “the Santa Monica Freeway.”
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
348

A good city map is a must; even born-and-raised Angelenos carry one in
their cars. AAA publishes the best maps of L.A., bar none. Members can
stop in at one of the local offices (see the “Fast Facts” section at the end
of this chapter). If you’re not a member, any good foldout map will do, as
long as all streets and freeways are clearly marked and the map has
address number notations.
L.A.’s neighborhoods
In L.A.’s neighborhoods, the wheat is separated from the chaff in a really
big way, boiling down the city to the neighborhoods where most visitors
(and most locals) head for sightseeing, entertainment, and general fun in
the sun. Who really wants to go to Van Nuys, anyway?
Unlike in most cities, urban life in L.A. doesn’t focus on downtown. You’ll
likely spend the bulk of your time in the beach communities, on the
city’s Westside, and in Hollywood. For a visual aid to this section, see
the “Los Angeles’s Neighborhoods” map on p. 350.
Santa Monica
Santa Monica is L.A.’s premier beach community. It’s fun, festive, and
pretty, with a deserved left-of-center reputation. It extends for 3 miles
along the coast, starting out artsy-funky around Ocean Park Boulevard
and getting ritzier as you go north. Ocean Avenue runs blufftop along
the coast, meeting Colorado Boulevard at the Santa Monica Pier,
famous for its amusements. Dining and shopping north of Colorado cen-
ters on the Third Street Promenade and along Main Street south of
Colorado. The 10 freeway drops you into the heart of the action.
Venice and Marina del Rey
South of Santa Monica is Venice, an early-20th-century planned commu-
nity with its very own canals. But the real draw is wild, wacky, funky
boho Venice Beach, which just may be the ultimate human carnival.
Main Street leads you into Venice from the north — you’ll know you’ve
arrived when it becomes Pacific Avenue — and Venice Boulevard and
Washington Avenue are the main routes from points east.
Malibu
Malibu is the ultimate symbol of beachy super-celebrity. Its vast network
of rugged canyons leads from Santa Monica north all the way to the
northern border of L.A. County. Only the Pacific Coast Highway (and an
almost-unbroken row of ocean-facing houses that are much larger — 
and pricier — than they look from PCH) separates Malibu’s canyons
from its gorgeous wide beaches. Malibu is extremely remote (one of its
great appeals for the rich and famous) and without freeway access.
Consequently, the drive to Malibu from just about anywhere else in the
city takes around an hour.

WESTSIDE & BEVERLY HILLS
HOLLYWOOD
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 351

West Los Angeles
West L.A. is basically an umbrella for the collection of middle- and
upper-middle-class communities sandwiched between Santa Monica to
the west and Beverly Hills to the east. Some of these communities lack
exact labels beyond “West L.A.,” but they’re perfectly nice nonetheless.
Among the most notable are
 Brentwood, the upscale residential area north of Wilshire Boulevard
and west of the 405 that O.J. Simpson made famous (to the chagrin
of his former neighbors).
 Westwood, home to UCLA and a restaurant- and shop-laden village
that caters largely to the college kids. It’s the area between the 405
and Beverly Hills, bounded by Santa Monica and Sunset boulevards;
the village is just north of Wilshire Boulevard.
 Bel-Air, the gated domain of the rich and famous north of UCLA
above Sunset Boulevard.
 Century City, the pocket of high-rises just west of Beverly Hills,
between Santa Monica and Pico boulevards. It has the Westside’s
only real city skyline, but is otherwise sanitized and uninteresting.
Beverly Hills
You know; it’s where the swimming pools and the movie stars are. Aren’t
they? Well, some, for sure. The traditional bastion of L.A.’s ultrarich 
and -famous is a glitzy but easily enjoyable community. The area south of
Wilshire Boulevard is largely upper-middle-class residential and home to
some surprisingly affordable hotels. North of Wilshire is the Golden
Triangle, Beverly Hills’s downtown, where you find the ritzy shops. North
of Santa Monica Boulevard is the hilly, star-studded residential area.
West Hollywood
Ground zero for L.A.’s gay and rock-’n’-roll communities, West Hollywood
houses some of L.A.’s best (or liveliest, anyway) hotels, restaurants, bars,
and clubs. It’s long and narrow, shaped kind of like a house key, and feels
either upscale or lowbrow, depending on where you are. The main drags
are Santa Monica Boulevard and the stretch of Sunset Boulevard between
Doheny Drive and Crescent Heights Boulevard known as the Sunset 
Strip — L.A.’s tattooed-and-pierced party central, packed with trendy
bars and rocking clubs.
Hollywood
The original epicenter of movie glamour had degenerated into one of the
seediest parts of town by the 1980s, but it’s a whole different story of
late. A major urban revitalization (much like the one that transformed
New York’s Times Square) began in the late ’90s and continues apace.
Hollywood Boulevard will never be a bastion of high culture — in fact,
L.A. hardly gets more touristy than this, and it never has had anything to
do with the actual movie business — but it’s cleaner, safer, and more
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
352

attractive than it has been in decades. The boulevard’s Walk of Fame
and the shopping/entertainment center Hollywood & Highland Center
are the main attractions, but the neighborhood extends from Beverly
Boulevard north into the Hollywood Hills, encompassing the famously
funky alterna-shopping strip Melrose Avenue.
Mid-Wilshire District/Miracle Mile
This corridor flanks Wilshire Boulevard east from Beverly Hills to
(roughly) Western Avenue. The highlight is the stretch of Wilshire
between Fairfax and La Brea avenues, which serves as the city’s impres-
sive Museum Row.
Los Feliz and Silver Lake
This hip haven between Hollywood and downtown is further notable as
a gateway to Griffith Park, the massive urban park that’s home to the
Griffith Observatory (remember Rebel without a Cause?).
Universal City and Burbank
These San Fernando Valley communities are the joint capitals of TV
Land, and all you need to know about the Valley. Universal City, west of
Griffith Park between the Hollywood and Ventura freeways (U.S. 101 and
California 134), houses Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal
CityWalk, the adjoining shopping-and-dining spread.
Just north of Universal City and the 134, Burbank hosts L.A.’s secondary
airport and the NBC and Warner Bros. studios, open to the masses for
TV tapings and tours.
Downtown
Boxed in by the 101, the 110, the 10, and the 5 freeways, downtown is the
business center of the city — and totally entertainment-industry-free.
After a scruffy period, the area cleaned up nicely in recent years, even
drawing some hip restaurants. As more old office buildings are bought up
and turned into living spaces (either apartments or more hotels), devel-
opers hope more culture and urban life will follow. Right now, MOCA, the
new Disney Hall, Olvera Street, the new Cathedral, and the Music Center
ought to be enough to lure you down for at least a quick peek.
Pasadena
Pasadena, blissfully free of Hollywood glam, is the premier draw of the
San Gabriel Valley (a network of pretty, upscale bedroom communities
east of the San Fernando Valley). The biggest day of the year here is
January 1, when the Tournament of Roses Parade draws national atten-
tion to the attractive ’burb. You can also find a few year-round attractions
here, such as the Norton Simon Museum of Art.
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 353

Drive, she said: Getting around
Yes, driving around L.A. is a hassle. Yes, you pretty much have to 
do it. There may be the brave tourist who will dare to use the public-
transportation system, and if you are he (or she), we say, Godspeed and
drop us a note to tell us how it went.
The complex web of freeways and surface streets may be intimidating at
first. After you get the hang of it, however, it’s not bad; driving in New
York City, or even the daunting hills of San Francisco, is worlds more dif-
ficult. Just think of L.A. as one big, bad suburb and you’ll be fine.
Do yourself a favor and keep these tips in mind as you drive — and park —
around the city:
 Allow more time than you think it will actually take to get where
you’re going. You need to make time for traffic and parking. Double
your margin in weekday rush hours, from 7 to 9 a.m. and again from
3 to 7 p.m. We’ve often found the freeways to be much more crowded
than we expect all day on Saturdays, too, especially heading toward
the ocean on a warm sunny day.
 Plan your exact route before you set out. Know where you need to
exit the freeway and/or make turns — especially lefts — and merge
in plenty of time. Otherwise, you’re likely to find yourself waving at
your freeway exit from an inside lane or your turnoff from an out-
side one. Pulling over and whipping out your map if you screw up is
never easy, and it’s darn near impossible on the freeways.
 Those kids you brought can come in handy. Most freeways have a
High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) — carpool — lane, which lets you
speed past some of the congestion if you have three people in the
car (sometimes two; read the signs). Don’t flout the rules; if you do,
expect to shell out close to 300 bucks for the ticket.
 Watch turning right on red. You can turn right on red as long as a
posted sign doesn’t tell you otherwise. Come to a full stop first —
no rolling.
 Beware of left turns. Many major intersections don’t have a left-
turn arrow, and most people run yellow lights, so it’s pretty
common for left-turners to have to do so just after the light turns
red. Conversely, if you’re going straight through an intersection,
you want to make sure there aren’t any left turners in the middle of
the intersection in front of you when the light first turns green.
 Accept the fact that you will sometimes have to pay for parking.
Your hotel will offer parking, either for free or for a charge. Many
other establishments (in some areas, most) don’t have their own
self-park lots, so free street parking is the holy grail. It’s sometimes
available, but not always. Side streets are often a good bet, but
beware of residential neighborhoods; an increasing number allow
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
354

only permit parking, and you will be towed or ticketed. Metered
street parking is much easier to find, but can still be tough to locate
in the most popular areas of Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and
Hollywood. Otherwise, expect to valet or garage it and to pay
between $5 and $25 for the privilege. Many restaurants, nightclubs,
and even some shopping centers offer curbside valet parking.
 Have plenty of quarters on hand. Angelenos scrounge for parking-
meter quarters like New Yorkers do for laundry quarters: They are
the equivalent of pure gold. Save yourself some hassle and just buy
a roll or two at your bank before you leave home.
 Always read the street-parking signs, because they often limit
your parking time. You will be ticketed if you overstay your wel-
come. Read the meters as well as street signs. On the upside, meter
fares are often waived in the evenings.
 Don’t lose your car in a parking garage. Take it from two reason-
ably intelligent, well-educated people who have done it more than
once — it happens. You know how you feel when you forget where
you parked your car at the mall? Multiply that by ten levels. Most
garage levels and subsections are letter-, number-, and color-coded.
Always make a mental note or a physical one, if need be.
If you must: By bus and metro
Sigh. We really want to encourage visitors to travel by bus or subway,
but we can’t, not in good conscience. This city is too large, for one, to be
covered by a good public-transportation system, and what is here is a
wildly inefficient one.
The award-winning Blue Buses in Santa Monica do actually work quite
well, and a case could be made for getting around via subway if all you
plan to do is go around Hollywood, Universal City, and downtown. Try it if
you dare; an all-day pass costs just $3. The Metropolitan Transit Authority
(MTA) runs the bus network in addition to the limited four-line Metro 
Rail system, really conceived as a park-and-ride system for suburban 
commuters. The “subway” (it still makes us snicker to call it that) does
work pretty well, provided you want to go to the eight (okay, there are
more than that) places it stops. For information, call % 800-COMMUTE
(800-266-6883), or go online to www.mta.net, where you’ll find a custom
online trip planner (have the exact addresses of your start and endpoint
on hand).
By taxi
Taxis don’t cruise the streets, so call well ahead for pickup. Keep in 
mind that distances are long, so the meter adds up quickly. If you need 
a cab, call L.A. Taxi Co-op (% 310-715-1968) or Independent Taxi
(% 323-666-0045).
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 355

Where to Stay in Los Angeles
In choosing Los Angeles’s best hotels, we’ve concentrated on those
neighborhoods that are the most visitor-friendly and offer the easiest
access to L.A.’s main attractions. Still, consider your major sightseeing
goals before you decide where to stay. That beach hotel that’s just right
for some may be all wrong for avid shoppers or club-hoppers.
Count on an extra 12 to 18 percent in taxes being tacked on to your hotel
bill, depending on where you’re staying. Ask what the local percentage is
when you book.
For hotels with locations in Westside and Beverly Hills, see the 
“Westside and Beverly Hills Accommodations, Dining, and Attractions”
map. For hotels with locations in Hollywood, flip to the “Hollywood
Accommodations, Dining, and Attractions” map. For hotels with locations
in Santa Monica and the beaches, go to the “Santa Monica and the Malibu
Beaches” map in the “Hitting the beaches” section later in this chapter.
Avalon Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Beverly Hills
Mae West and Marilyn Monroe once lived here, when it was an apartment
building, and Lucy and Ricky Ricardo stayed here when they went to
Hollywood in I Love Lucy. Now, it’s a small, chic hotel, aggressively styled
and inadvertently harkening back to the 1950s/Jetsons futurism — look
for all the green polished concrete and atom-age emblems. Rooms are
spare but oh so comfortable — think high-end Italian linens! Moulton
Brown–brand bathroom amenities! CD and DVD players! The bathrooms
are smallish, with inexplicable bamboo poles (for stripper practice?). The
pool demands a good bathing suit and a figure to match. Ask about rooms
240 through 244, which include furnished terraces.
See map p. 358. 9400 W. Olympic Blvd. (at Cañon Drive). % 800-670-6183 or 310-
277-5221. Fax: 310-277-4928. www.avalonbeverlyhills.com. Parking: $26. Rack
rates: $250–$505 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Best Western Hollywood Hills Hotel
$$–$$$
Hollywood
Famous for the huge sign declaring this to be the “Last Cappuccino before
the 101” and with a coffee shop (now under new ownership and design
and renamed the 101 Coffee Shop — see the “Where to Dine in Los
Angeles” section later in this chapter) that was featured in the movie
Swingers, this motel is usually crowded with local musicians, actors, and
lounge-abouts digging into the hearty, reasonably priced food. The rooms
are large, the large pool is tiled and heated, and the location is good for
public transportation and excellent for driving. Star-spotting spots are
within walking distance (Victor’s Deli and Café, Gelson’s/Mayfair Market,
Bourgeois Pig, and Cosmopolitan Books and Music), Universal Studios is
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
356

five minutes away on the freeway, and Hollywood is just down the hill. And
for the kids, Dodger Stadium and the Los Angeles Zoo are not too far.

287-1700 or 323-464-5181. Fax: 323-962-0536. www.bestwestern.com/hollywood
hillshotel. Free parking. Rack rates: $99–$210 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Best Western Ocean View Hotel
$$–$$$$
Santa Monica
A Best Western, but a top-of-the-line one, so if you’re looking for a stan-
dard modern hotel with a slippery marble foyer/lobby, look no further.
Rooms are medium-sized, comfortable, heavy on the pinky-goldy color
scheme, and instantly forgettable (although some rooms do have ocean
views, and some are handicapped accessible, which isn’t always the case
in the older Santa Monica hotels — call for availability). Palisades Park is
across the street, and the Pier and the Third Street Promenade are just a
block or so away.
See map p. 397. 1447 Ocean Ave. (across from Palisades Park). % 800-452-4888 or
310-458-4888. Fax: 310-458-0848. www.bestwestern.com/oceanviewhotel.
Parking: $15. Rack rates: $149–$279 double. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Beverly Hills Reeves Hotel
$–$$
Beverly Hills
Wow, talk about facelifts! This used to be a cheap place to stay in Beverly
Hills; now it’s a nice and cheap place to stay while vacationing in the 90210.
Bought by a caring corporation, the Reeves has a fresh coat of paint, new
carpeting, an attractive lobby, and cleaner rooms, thanks to the new
owners. Yet the shockingly low room rates remain shockingly low. There’s
no room service, but a decent continental breakfast is included, and each
room has a small TV with cable; for daily and weekly guests, maid service
and private bathrooms are included, although it’s possible to rent rooms
with shared bathrooms (and that means sharing everything). At the Reeves,
you’re within walking distance of the glitz and glitter of Rodeo Drive and
points adjacent. Instead of spending all your vacation cash on rooms, you
can shop and dine and still say you stayed in Beverly Hills. Caveat: Parking
is limited to street parking, so observe posted hours; the front desk closes
at 11:30 p.m., making this a bad choice for late-night arrivals.
See map p. 358. 120 S. Reeves Dr. (half a block from Wilshire Boulevard). % 310-
271-3006. Fax: 310-271-2276. Free parking on street 6 p.m.–8 a.m. only. Rack rates:
$89–$109 double per day, $638–$730 double per week. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Beverly Terrace Hotel
$$
Beverly Hills
This is the best hotel value in Beverly Hills. It’s located six (long) blocks
from the heart of Beverly Hills and a steep quarter-mile hike from Sunset
Strip. The exterior is fabulous 1950s glamour mirrored by the interior’s
midcentury, modern-beach-house feel. A pair of chatty cockatiels in the

although you can puff poolside. The rooms, all of which come with refrig-

The Brentwood Inn
West Los Angeles
This charming, sophisticated-yet-cozy, 20-unit cottage-style motel billow-
ing with roses is an unexpected business venture, and yet fits perfectly
into the wealthy yet relaxed section of Los Angeles called Brentwood.
Located just minutes from UCLA to the east and the beach to the west (and
scandal lovers will be pleased to learn, smack dab in the middle of the
route O.J. may have taken that fateful night), the Brentwood Inn has long
been a place where families put up out-of-town visitors. Cool turquoise and
soothing browns predominate in the rooms, which feature complimentary
wireless and flat-screen TVs, though no tubs; there are showers only. The
bedding is hypoallergenic and all rooms are nonsmoking and pet free. In
the morning, muffins and pastries are served in the lobby by the fireplace,
while a fountain bubbles on the enclosed patio.

Cadillac Hotel
$$
Venice
Built in 1905 as Charlie Chaplin’s residence, this hotel is funky but cheap,
a sort of Southern California version of the classic European pensione. A
multimillion-dollar renovation, a top-to-bottom redo, was just beginning
at press time. (Well, so they say. It was also “just beginning” a couple of
years ago. They’ve raised their prices in what one hopes is anticipation of
the actual remodel!) All rooms are being redesigned in “complete Art Deco
style,” with slightly different décor for each. It is a nice old building, with
a fun, grand old lobby. There’s wireless Internet access throughout the
building. The two-room suite with beach views at the top may be the best
bargain in town (around $199 a night). The rooftop has a sweeping view of
the bay, and you can see up to four different fireworks shows from here
on July 4th. The hotel is also just a couple blocks from the happening part
of Venice’s Main Street — and did we mention that it’s right on the beach?

Cal-Mar Hotel Suites
$$
Santa Monica
Neatly situated just 2 blocks from Montana Avenue, 2 blocks from the ocean
and 1 block from the Third Street Promenade, this all-suite hotel in an oth-
erwise residential neighborhood features reasonable rates considering the
location and the amenities: heated pool, full kitchens and dining room in
each suite, queen-size sofa beds in the living room, cribs on request, and
self-service laundry room, making it just about perfect for families. Plus, as
a guest, you have access to nearby Eaton’s gym. It’s not super-fancy (think
basic, serviceable hotel décor) but it’s very clean, convenient and friendly.

Channel Road Inn
$$$–$$$$$
Santa Monica
Nestled in Santa Monica Canyon and less than 2 blocks from the beach,
this three-story Colonial Revival Craftsman has been lovingly restored by
owner Susan Zolla. Transformed into a period-perfect bed-and-breakfast
(with modern conveniences such as in-room VCRs and a business center),
the inn features 14 unique, circa-1920 rooms where fresh-baked cookies
and handwritten notes greet guests. Each room has a private bathroom,
and each suite includes a Jacuzzi tub. Homemade lemonade sits on the
sideboard in the relaxed wicker-filled breakfast room where award-winning
egg soufflés are served. Although the canyon section of Santa Monica is
not loaded with shops, downtown Santa Monica and Montana Avenue
shopping districts are minutes away by car, and the inn provides free bicy-
cles if you want to pedal around the area.

Chateau Marmont
$$$$–$$$$$
Hollywood/West Hollywood
Although its most notorious fame comes from John Belushi’s overdose
death (in Bungalow 2 in 1982), this fabulously romantic, slightly spooky
old hotel is much favored by celebs who value naturally acquired style and
quirk. The whole thing looks like a setting for a Raymond Chandler–style
mystery, to say nothing of discreet assignations, which is probably why
legendary studio boss Harry Cohn famously said, “If you must get into
trouble, do it at the Chateau Marmont.” Once a residence hotel (and there
remain many a long-time occupant), the rooms can often be ridiculously
large, especially the suites (to say nothing of the cottages and bungalows),
which were originally intended as apartments. The furnishings and style
in said rooms may put you in mind of the slightly faded Art Deco grandeur
of the Coen Brothers’ movie Barton Fink (although beds are modern and

’20s Spanish Mission lobby, is a hot spot for star spotting. As we write this,

The Crescent
$$$–$$$$
Beverly Hills
Originally an auxiliary building for Paramount Pictures (in the 1920s, when
the studio was located in this area, actors used it for naps between
scenes), this chic hotel — formerly the charming and serviceable Beverly
Crescent — has undergone a major facelift. It’s still charming, but now it’s
also hip and sleek. Think concrete vanities in the bathrooms, flat-screen
TVs, DVD players and iPods, complimentary Wi-Fi, fluffy bathrobes, and
custom Italian linens in each room. Boe, the hotel’s restaurant/lounge,
draws the arty and powerful with its haute-cuisine version of Asian “street
food” and fusiony dishes, and serves up an Oscar-themed signature cock-
tail, the Mystic River. Yet despite the fabulosity and upscale accou-
trements, the Crescent is still very reasonably priced — especially for the
neighborhood.

Elan Hotel Modern
$$–$$$
West Hollywood
Just a block from the Beverly Center, this strives for a sleek and chic image,
difficult to do when the lobby looks out at a Taco Bell and a (well-combed)
Goodwill. Still, they seem to bring in a lot of hip-hop business, so perhaps
the image is successful enough. Essentially, the rooms have nice versions
of classic hotel/motel furniture, although the bathrooms are stylish, if
small, with fruity-smelling amenities. Note that you can get some traffic
noise if your room faces Beverly Boulevard. Instead of calling room serv-
ice, order from Jan’s Coffee Shop across the street from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.
and have them jaywalk it over for you (the crosswalk is too far away). The
hotel serves complimentary continental breakfast and has a nightly wine-
and-cheese reception. We wish a generic hotel had this much style (note
the splashes of colored tile breaking up the otherwise all-white showers)
or at least that this hotel had more generic hotel prices.

Farmer’s Daughter Hotel
$$
West Hollywood
For a long time, this was a rather notorious hot-sheets hotel, but a facelift
made it a hip kind of dive in the right way. It’s as if someone stuck a motel,
an old family hotel, and a B&B into a blender and let ’er rip. It seems to be
working; right now, it’s at the epicenter of fashionable action. The building
still betrays its motel origins, although now it’s tarted up in shades of
bright blues and teals. Rooms, cute but not plush, are done in “His” and
“Hers” styles (just a change in color scheme, plus rooster wallpaper for
the boys) and include rocking chairs and slightly dingy gingham curtains
(to evoke that farmhouse the daughter would have lived in), CD players,
and high-speed Internet access. Many have balconies that overlook either
busy Fairfax Avenue or the parking lot and concrete public spaces. The
location, across from the Farmers Market and Grove, and down the street
from the Jewish Fairfax district, is optimum, full of shopping and eating
opportunities for all budgets. All rooms are nonsmoking.

Hilton Checkers
$$–$$$
Downtown
A gorgeous limestone-facade 1927 building (the renovated Mayflower), in a
corner of L.A. that has a surprising Manhattan/San Francisco vibe, this is as
well situated as a hotel in downtown can be, right next to the Central Library,
across from the plush Biltmore, and an easy stroll to the Music Center and
Walt Disney Concert Hall, MOCA, and the fashion and jewelry districts. Nicely
styled, still fresh rooms feature great bedside lighting (a rarity), dark wood
built-in Chippendale-style cabinetry, comfortable mattresses, silky duvets,
and lovely cove molding. The windows actually open; even the rooms
fronting Grand Avenue are quiet (not much street life in these parts in the
midnight hours, and if you’re out and about, you’d be well advised to drive
or take cabs). Note that rooms ending in 02 are big enough to swing a cat,
but only just, while 07s are the largest. You get high-speed Internet access in
your room and 24-hour room service; plus, the lovely restaurant serves one
of the nicest afternoon teas in town. Service is personable, well-informed,
and friendly. Rates can be much, much cheaper than the rack rates suggest,
especially on the weekends, so it’s worth making the call, but do note that dif-
ference in the size of the rooms, if you care about that sort of thing.

Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Hollywood
This fabulous old Roaring ’20s Deco/Mission wonder keeps getting new
leases on life. Thanks to the latest beautiful restoration, with its focus on
appealing to the current crop of celebrities and beautiful people, it’s once
again a first choice A-list hangout. Somehow, it manages to walk the line
that makes it popular with both Paris Hilton and Marilyn Monroe’s ghost
(who reportedly haunts the place). It doesn’t hurt that that line lies smack
in the middle of Hollywood Upgrade Central (across the street from
Grauman’s and down the street from the Hollywood & Highland Center;
the Walk of Fame runs right in front of it), and you won’t get more style
and a better Hollywood location at a cheaper price. The rooms in the main
hotel are decorated with an elegant 1950s feel — dark wood, chocolate
brown, and cream predominate, and like the more expensive, more rock-
’n-roll-styled cabana accommodations, feature down duvets, and wireless
Internet, though the latter for a daily fee. There are views of mountains
and the Hollywood sign from one side of the hotel, and the rest of the city
from the other side. The very first Academy Awards banquet was held
here, and David Hockney just repainted the inside of the palm-tree-ringed
swimming pool, restoring his original mural. You may spot a big name or
two here, especially if you rent a cabana room which guarantees you
entrance into the very hip, celeb-packed Tropicana bar.

Hotel Angeleno
$$$–$$$$ West Los Angeles
Ooooh, who knew West L.A. could be so sexy? Once a Holiday Inn, the Hotel
Angeleno retained the building’s famously phallic exterior while turning the
interior in a chic, svelte collection of rooms with Italian bed linens, flat-
screen TVs, natural-fiber wallpaper and luxuriously tiled bathrooms (the
suites feature showers that convert to steam rooms). The modern seduc-
tive atmosphere is carried through at West, the top-floor lounge/Italian
steakhouse with a 360-degree view of the city, a white marble bar, blown-
glass chandeliers, and black-leather banquettes. The entire hotel is non-
smoking, though each room has a tiny, postage-stamp balcony for nicotine
fiends. The Television Academy of Arts and Science (the folks who put on
the Emmys) think the place glamorous enough to hold parties and recep-
tions poolside, while its prices are reasonable enough to lure travelers off
the freeway (yes, this is hardly in a glamorous location, right at the inter-
section of the 405 and Sunset). The hotel is well situated for a winding drive
up to Hollywood or down to the beach, and the Getty is right up the hill
behind you. Check the Web site for special packages for families and busi-
ness travelers.

Hotel Figueroa
$$
Downtown
Someone is taking great care with a lovely old hotel. The Figueroa has,
hands-down, the most gorgeous public spaces of any downtown hotel:
décor in a Moorish theme (think Moroccan meets Spanish), exotic fabrics,
wrought-iron and wood furniture, tiles and other decorative bits of fancy,
and soaring ceilings — how the heck did this place land here? Rooms are
not quite as splashy, but boy, did somebody try; they have successfully
tarted up what was probably a dumpy old hotel by painting the walls with
bold faux-finish paint and adding more exotic furniture and fabric. Recently,
they replaced old TVs and removed the acoustic tile, exposing some won-
derful beamed ceilings. Wireless Internet access is also available for a rea-
sonable daily rate. Given that you can get similarly priced (at least, on
weekends), more up-to-date rooms at the Hilton Checkers, this may not be
the place for you, but note that a former top executive with a national hotel
chain volunteered that this is the only place he stays when he’s in town.

The Magic Castle is a long-time clubhouse hangout for magicians and is
impossible to get into unless you’re a member (or invited by one) or unless

(There is a $20 door charge, but trust us: It’s worth it.) The gray-and-green,
spanking-clean, new rooms (embellished with magician showbills) with free
wireless Internet have plenty of elbow room; many rooms even have kitch-
enettes (grocery-shopping services are available). The on-site pool is square
and situated in the middle of the courtyard, but you also have access to the
curvy number up the street at the hotel’s sister establishment, the all-suites

parking, which is good, because you’ll need a car; this hotel isn’t precisely
walking distance to anything, although the Hollywood & Highland Center
(with shops, movie theaters, and cafes, and the Janice Dickenson Modeling
Agency) and the Metro station are not too many blocks (depending on your
perspective) away — take advantage of the complimentary continental
breakfast before you start out. It’s not the most pleasant block; however,
this area is ripe for transition, so take advantage of the charm and prices
while you can still afford them.

Maison 140

Beverly Hills
Once a boardinghouse owned by silent-screen star Lillian Gish, Maison 140
is now the sexiest, most decadently decorated hotel in the greater Los
Angeles area. From the all-black lobby with the most minimal touches of
white and red to the smallish but luxe rooms stocked with Frette linens,
chinoiserie furnishings, and Philosophy bath products (most rooms have
showers only, but you can request one with a tub), this boutique hotel
swathes you in glamorous, sybaritic elegance. The hotel’s sitting area is
home to continental breakfast in the morning and then shifts into a full bar
at cocktail hour. An off-site kitchen cooks up 24-hour room service, a small
fitness center features clean new machines, and you’re within walking dis-
tance of all Beverly Hills. Oh, this place is gorgeous!

The Mosaic Hotel

Beverly Hills
What was once a nice, moderately priced 49-room inn suddenly became
very aware of its perfect location on a quiet street in Beverly Hills and turned
itself into a very likeable boutique hotel. Think nouveau-Byzantine glass
mosaic tiling meets European-moderne for the public areas and small but
handsome and comfortable rooms with sleek black furniture upholstered in
neutrals and mossy greens plus squooshy beds and sparkling bathrooms
(be careful about which amenities are free and which are added to your bill,
though). A sleek bar is just off the lobby and a pan-Asian restaurant in the
same décor features global cuisine. The small pool is lushly landscaped and
heated year-round. Despite the chic presence, the staff is most friendly. Be
discrete in the elevator; more than one well-heeled and famous name uses
this as a post-cosmetic-surgery retreat! Again, rack rates may not be indica-
tive of real pricing, so make some calls. It’s a lovely stay.

Located more or less at the beginning of the interesting bits of Main Street,

roomy, immaculate bathrooms. Suites feature full kitchens and separate
bedrooms. No room service is offered, but laundry facilities are next door,
delis and restaurants are close by, the beach is just another couple of

erwise impossible to come by. Unless you absolutely need a posh place to

The Sheraton Delfina is a not-always-successful hybrid between the new,
hip, branded hotels and the name-brand business-style comfort expected
from the Sheraton label. Nonetheless, if you frequent Sheratons, and thus
might be in a position to get a discount or more, the location and the
wannabe-hip vibe, particularly blatant in the public areas, make this worth
considering. Rooms are snazzy, although sometimes the temperature con-
trol is a bit wonky. Bathrooms, oddly, have not been redone and as such
can come as a shock. Much more stylish than a regular Sheraton, and

Shutters on the Beach

Staying at Shutters is like staying at a really rich friend’s L.A. beach house.
In fact, you might well spot some folks who used to be on Friends or, at least,
seem oddly familiar, until you realize you recognize them from CD and maga-
zine covers. Facing Santa Monica Beach in all its gray-clapboarded glory,
this oceanfront gem is a stunner. Rooms are airy and gorgeous, with such
playful touches as rubber duckies in the whirlpool tubs and nighttime 
storybooks on the Frette-made beds. The food is terrific, and the casually
elegant service is excellent.

Downtown
Downtown’s first hipster hotel and one that is long overdue, the Standard
offers style on top of style, and is self-consciously playful if a little chilly,
although the staff is friendly enough. This is where the happening down-
town nightly scene finds a place to kick it, complete with a live DJ spin-
ning in the lobby at night. Rooms are design conscious, with platform beds
and “desks” that are really a wide shelf running under the entire 14-foot
length of the windows. In the smallest rooms (not that small — 300 sq. ft.,

Located in a quiet residential neighborhood, a short walk up a steep hill
from the Sunset Strip, this is a definite budget bargain, but only if you don’t
have serious aesthetic needs. Not that there is anything wrong with this
hotel, but its ’80s-era décor is not going to wow you. But here’s the thing:
The smallest room has a decent amount of space, including a kitchenette

or, at least, a breakfast nook, while the next level up, the junior suite, has
a sunken living/sitting area. And all accommodations have gas fireplaces
(with remote controls, naturally), which just adds to the hilarity factor.
The small rooftop pool has near-360-degree city views. When you see how
these prices compare to some of the fancier, and smaller, digs around, the
dated style probably won’t bother you a bit.

Venice Beach House
$$–$$$
Venice
If you were to take the best of what L.A. has to offer, what makes this city
its own and not some other random large city, and shrink it down and then
make it a B&B, it might look something like this. An archetypal Craftsman
home, steps away from the beach (the sandy part, anyway), surrounded
by lawn (the front gate leading right to the walk to the beach), with
bougainvillea and other blooms, it’s the dream of L.A., for sure. (The night-
mare of L.A. being the hideous modern apartment buildings that block the
home’s formerly perfect ocean views.) Each room has its own theme —
from the tiny Tramp’s Quarters (the smallest room) to the spacious Pier
Suite (with a fireplace and sitting room) — and delights (such as the wool-
plaid-upholstered walls in Abbot Kinney’s room and the fireplace in the
James Peasgood room), as well as its own drawbacks (size varies, and four
rooms share two bathrooms between them). The good parts of Main
Street, not to mention the delights of Santa Monica, are a good hike away,
so plan on having a car (although restaurants are within walking distance).

Wilshire Crest Inn

Near Beverly Hills
Wilshire Boulevard is a major artery for L.A., moving from downtown to
the beach, past museums and shopping areas with regular, swift public
transportation along its busy lanes. And the freshly painted and updated
owner-operated Wilshire Crest Inn (which is actually right off Wilshire on
a side street), a reasonably priced, attractive hotel, is perfectly situated
to take advantage of all that the boulevard offers. Rooms are good-sized
and the dining room off the lobby has complimentary pastries, bagels,
coffee, and tea in the morning, which draws visiting staff from the nearby
consulates plus guest speakers and curators from the many museums
down the road.

Where to Dine in Los Angeles
You can eat very well in Los Angeles, whether you’re feasting at gold-
plated institutions, innovative up-and-comers, or, in particular, at one of

creations for a pittance. We try to give you a cross-section of all that,
mostly in the areas of town in which you’re most likely to find yourself.

RUSTIC REGIONAL ITALIAN
Evan Kleiman, the chef/owner of this much-beloved near-institution, is
known for her dedication to the local farmers’ markets, ensuring that her
menu always reflects the seasons. (She also hosts the local public radio
station’s food show on Saturdays.) Curious experiments with produce
aside, you can expect dedicatedly authentic Italian. This may seem like a
chic cafe, but it’s quite child friendly; kids who come in are given a ball of
dough to mash and shape as they please. The dough is then cooked in the
oven and presented to them when it’s done, a process that can keep the
most wriggly kid entertained enough for the parents to enjoy a nice meal.

The operators of this instantly likable restaurant (everyone seems so

scene (Chef Gino Angelini cooked for the now-defunct Rex in downtown
L.A.); consequently, this establishment was an almost instant hit. Of course,
that success is also due to the quality of the food — genuine Italian cooking,
lovingly and thoughtfully prepared. All the pastas are heavenly, but only at
lunch will you find Nonna Elvira’s (that’s Gino’s mom) green lasagna, light
and airy, topped with flash-fried spinach, a former favorite at Rex. A chil-
dren’s menu has a few simple dishes for the less curious of palate.

MEDITERRANEAN/TAPAS
From the people who brought Lucques (see the listing later in this section)
to L.A., this brick-lined place (a little too noisy to be romantic) specializes
in “small plates.” Think tapas — not necessarily just Spanish or just appe-
tizers, but necessarily divine ones — or even sampling the wares at the
best French or Tuscan countryside grocer you can imagine. The wine list
(the establishment’s name is an abbreviation for the Appellation d’Origine
Contrôlée laws of France, which govern all wine) is a finely tuned standout,
because this is really a wine bar that serves interesting food, and all these
small plates are meant to enhance that experience.

rooted in the traditional Mexican canon, so if you’re looking for gloopy

may be disappointed, until, of course, you find out what real Mexican
home cooking is like. Despite the overall quality, we’d suggest avoiding

This adorable little cafe is most notable for breakfast, although lunch is

much smaller (we admit to having a great fondness for the kid-pleasing
chocolate-chip ones, oozing melted chocolatey goodness) — in short, all
of it portioned to share. Note: It’s a popular place, and on the small side,

CALIFORNIA/MEDITERRANEAN
Campanile is one of two restaurants most likely to be the answer to the
question, “What’s the best restaurant in L.A.?” We won’t say for sure that
Campanile can live up to the hype (but to be fair, what could?), but we will
say it’s someplace special. Chef/owner Mark Peel is a great talent, and his
ex-wife, Nancy Silverton, is the genius behind La Brea Bakery (their bread
is served all over the city), the original of which is next door. Come for
dinner, where you may eat the likes of a beautifully simple bibb lettuce and
herb salad with lemon vinaigrette and fleur de sel (one of the finest salads
we’ve ever tried), rosemary-charred baby lamb, cedar-smoked Tasmanian
salmon, pulled-pork ravioli, or even precious Persian mulberries (only
during a very short July season); or for brunch, considered the best in
town; or for Thursday night, when they try gourmet twists on the humble
grilled-cheese sandwich. And always save room for dessert; the pastry
chef is renowned.

the large menu and solidly good food. (Okay, the hipsters come because
they can get soup at 3 a.m., and because two good clubs are across the
street; plus, Canter’s own Kibitz Room hosts its own music shows — for
years, before he was anyone other than his father’s son, Jacob Dylan
played there regularly.) We’ve eaten more than our share of Canter’s

A casual spot from the culinary star behind Lucques and A.O.C., this

and then a lobster roll, and then maybe another half-dozen oysters. Oddly,
though, its most popular item is its burger, possibly the best of the double-
digit-priced ones around, and all the better for being topped with blue
cheese and served on a La Brea bakery roll. The lobster roll (butter style,
rather than mayo) has its frenetic fans, though anyone who has been to
Maine won’t be impressed with the size and price. If you’re in the area for
a movie at the ArcLight, or shopping at Amoeba records, or just sightsee-

until it falls apart at a touch, it’s what Mom would make if she were a gour-

Only in Los Angeles can a guy who had his 15 minutes of fame playing an
oh-so-shirtless construction worker in a Diet Coke commercial open up a
popular diner, and get people to pay $14 for a burger — and a good one,
at that. The place also serves up all-beef hot dogs, gourmet cupcakes made
with Scharffenberger chocolate, and thick shakes made with toasted pecan
and bourbon vanilla. Also, Lucky (Vanous, that is), often presides over the
joint. Hmm. Come to think of it, we are glad this place is here.

A star in the L.A. foodie firmament, Lucques (say “Luke” — it’s a kind of
olive, and one that is placed on your table, along with salt, sweet butter,
and wonderful bread) features California cuisine with French and
Mediterranean influences. The menu changes seasonally; a recent lunch
menu offered duck confit with celery root remoulade and a grilled pork
burger with chipotle aioli. Dinner features items such as grilled snapper
with winter vegetables, Portuguese pork and clams with chorizo, and
Lucques’s (quickly growing famous) braised short ribs. Desserts may fea-
ture bittersweet chocolate pot de crème. (A.O.C., a “small plates” restau-
rant listed earlier in this section, is from the same chef-owner.)

A charming restaurant in an old Craftsman house, Off Vine doesn’t have the
high profile it used to, and that’s a shame, because we’ve never not enjoyed
a meal here, both for taste and ambience. There’s nothing, truth be told,
shockingly innovative at Off Vine, but you aren’t going to feel cheated,
because the food is interesting enough and done well, and the prices are
reasonable. The room is pretty, as is the plant-filled courtyard. It’s roman-
tic but not intimidating, and nicely situated for the Hollywood area.

DINER
A landmark restaurant, kinda, in that it’s housed in the Best Western
Hollywood Hills Hotel, the side of which carries a large sign informing the
freeway-bound that it is the “Last Cappuccino until the 101,” a sign that has
turned up in various movies, including The Brady Bunch. The original coffee
shop the sign used to signal, featured in the movie Swingers, has since
closed; however the 101 has taken its place nicely. Check out the hours
(“Why even close at all?” wonders one loyal patron), check out the patrons
in the booth next to you (you’ve probably seen them in some movie, TV
show, rock video, or commercial), and check out the menu, featuring thick,
hearty soups; honest tuna melts; more-exotic salmon and grilled skirt steak;
plus Mexican-style specialties; wonderful banana shakes; and honest-to-

Patina
$$$$$
Hollywood
FRENCH-CALIFORNIAN
The Patina is the other restaurant (besides Campanile and newcomer
Providence) justly considered by most to be L.A.’s finest, and the first by
Joachim Splichal, whose name (and restaurant conglomerate, the Patina
Group) pops up a great deal more here. Originally based in Melrose, 
Patina moved into a corner of the newly opened Disney Hall in 2003; the
Patina Group had previously had good luck with restaurants in both 
the Music Center and MOCA. The result, visually, is the very model of a
modern restaurant. The menu will change, but here’s what we ate recently,
and see if this doesn’t read like food pornography: a “Quartet of the Sea”
(components change nightly, but we ate butter-soft hamachi with a confit
of grapefruit, miso-glazed smoked eel on marinated shitake mushrooms,
Spanish anchovies with fried capers and olive tapenade, and bluefin tuna
tartar); hand-rolled pasta alla Chitarra, with wild mushrooms and porcini
espuma (that’s foam); a large piece of plump, superb sautéed foie gras with
black pepper rhubarb compote, green pepper emulsion, and pink pepper-
corn ice cream; 11⁄4 pounds of lobster placed in a hollowed-out artichoke
heart, lightly touched with butter and artichoke foam. Note that the restau-
rant often is less in demand while a show is in progress, but quite full right

Believe it or not, some people in L.A. have never heard of Philippe’s, which
completely bemuses those who consider it an essential component of life
in this city. Founded in 1918 — which, right there, is reason enough to
come — Philippe’s claims that one day its owner dropped part of a sand-
wich roll in the juices of a roast beef and gave it to a customer who raved.
Voila! — the French dip was invented. Throw in a 10¢ cup of coffee and a
clientele that ranges from punks to opera goers, and you have a true L.A.

FRENCH/SEAFOOD
It’s nervy, taking over the space formerly occupied by what many consid-

successor to Patina (now near the Disney Hall downtown). Scoring a James
Beard nomination for Best New Restaurant in 2006, the place hit the
ground running and is one of the finest dining options in the city right now.
Because of a deep commitment to seasonal ingredients, the menu changes
frequently, but the emphasis is on innovative, French-inspired prepara-
tions of seafood. (There may well be some obscure Asian fish you have
never encountered among the evening’s offerings. Try it.) Having said that,
its foie gras preparations can make foodies weep, and we were ridiculously
happy over a crispy-skinned pork belly appetizer. Not so much a place for
romantic dining (it’s sexy, but a little noisy), but it is a place for grown-up
considerations of the possibilities of food.

(General’s Noodles are full of garlic, pork, duck, and spices; a bowlful feeds
several and can cure the common cold), and you won’t believe how good

close for considerably less money at Sushi Gen. When you’ve had Sushi

praising the place, before the order is ready. It’s not just because the roast
chicken is, well, perfect — juicy and flavorful, with a crispy seasoned skin
that has you forgetting all the health warnings about fat and instead bat-
tling your loved ones for that last piece. It’s all that, and then there’s the
garlic sauce. Trust us when we say that when we die, the food served to

Exploring L.A.’s Top Attractions
You won’t lack for exciting things to do in the City of Angels, whether it’s
seeing top museums, taking a back-stage studio tour, visiting an old movie
palace, or riding the rides at Universal Studios and Anaheim’s Disneyland
Resort. Heck, you may just come for the beaches and the year-round wel-
coming weather. This section gives you the highlights from which you can
pick and choose.
You can save a few bucks on admission fees to some major attractions by
investigating the CityPass. $50 for adults, $40 for kids 3 to 11, gets you a
Starline Tour, a Red Line Tour, and the Hollywood Wax Museum, plus a
choice of either the a guided tour of the Kodak Theatre (frequently closed
for events) or the Hollywood Museum based in the old Max Factor build-
ing. Better still, for those families intending to hit all the area theme parks,
the Southern California Pass. For $199 adults, $139 kids 3 to 11, you get a
three-day Park Hopper Pass — unlimited admission to Disneyland and
California Adventure — plus early admission to both parks, plus SeaWorld
and San Diego Zoo admissions, and front-of-the-line upgrades and admis-
sion to Universal Studios. Given that a regular Park Hopper Pass is $169,
and Universal starts at $49, this is practically a steal. You can purchase
CityPass at any of the aforementioned attractions, as well as from 
the CityPass Web site at www.citypass.com.
For attractions in the Westside and Beverly Hills, see the “Westside and
Beverly Hills Accommodations, Dining, and Attractions” map. For attrac-
tions in Hollywood, go to the “Hollywood Accommodations, Dining, and
Attractions” map. Both are located earlier in this chapter.
Universal Studios Hollywood
Situated on the real Universal lot, the one-time studio tour has grown into a
sizable theme park that can absorb an entire day. The hour-long Backlot
Tram Tour is still the heart of the matter, taking in such classic movie sites
as the Bates Motel, plus a few silly-but-fun staged “disasters,” including a
not-so-secret one starring Jaws the shark. Silliness aside, this is an actual
working studio, so you could see filming in action — although it’s not likely.
Here are just a few of the thrills and chills to choose from at Universal:
 The world’s fastest indoor rollercoaster Revenge of the Mummy . . .
The Ride, loaded with special effects, takes those with strong 
stomachs on a high-speed journey through curse-ridden ancient
Egypt as depicted in the popular series of movies.
 Another attraction is Van Helsing: Fortress Dracula, a haunted-
house-style walking tour of sets from the movie that’s supposed to
be scary, but isn’t.
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 385

 You get very, very wet on Jurassic Park . . . The Ride, a glorified
log flume with a “small world” full of robotic dinosaurs and one
very steep drop. Pay the extra buck for the poncho — or maybe
even splurge for two.
 Expect the most jostling from Back to the Future . . . The Ride,
which left us longing for a massage, or at least a vibrating chair.
The ride’s concept is that some evil guy in an ugly Hawaiian shirt
has stolen a time-traveling DeLorean (wasn’t this funnier in the
’80s?), and you’re along for the ride.
 Shrek 4-D bridges the gap between the first and second movies
with a fun 15-minute animated 3-D short featuring the original voice
actors (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and so on). It’s screened in a
theater with motion-coordinated seats (they move in time with
stuff happening on-screen) and water and wind special effects that
make the show entertaining without being too intense for people
who usually can’t handle true motion-simulator rides.
 Terminator 2: 3-D is a live-action show mixed with 3-D filmmaking
effects. It is based on plot points of the first two Terminator movies
that seem dated after the third Terminator movie and that whole
California gubernatorial thing.
 Backdraft and the Special Effects Stages take you behind the
scenes to show how fire effects, green screens, robotics, and sound
engineering turn dull moments into movie magic. Both are interest-
ing, but if the line is long, come back later.
 Animal Planet Live!, WaterWorld, The Blues Brothers, and
Spider-Man Rocks are live-action shows featuring animals, stunts,
music, and other assorted “entertainment.” The only one really
worth your time is the Animal Planet show, but it’s too short to jus-
tify the long lines getting in and out of the stadium. And the only
reason you should see the 20-minute musical version of “Spider-
Man” is to giggle as they try to work “Holding Out for a Hero,” “She
Bangs,” and “Lady Marmalade” into the story.
Come midweek if you can, preferably not in summer, to avoid long lines.
Little ones will be plenty entertained, but the park really targets kids 7 and
up. Adjoining the park is Universal’s cartoony shopping-and-dining com-
plex CityWalk (in case you haven’t spent enough dough already), which
boasts good after-park dinner options.

Hooray for Hollywood!
Right off the bat, we must explain that “Hollywood” is both a neighbor-
hood in Los Angeles and a catchall term for the motion-picture industry
that is not, contrary to popular belief, based in Hollywood. Or anywhere
near Hollywood. Nor was it ever. Well, okay, that’s not strictly true.
Columbia had studios at Sunset and Gower and still shoots TV shows
there, and many silent-movie studios were in the eastern part of Holly-
wood (Los Feliz and Silver Lake). But no studio was ever on Hollywood
Boulevard, much less at the legendary Hollywood and Vine.
Of course, the reality doesn’t explain the mythos that has arisen around
that name, term, and locale. And though locals may rarely be caught
dead on Hollywood Boulevard, sniffing that it’s either full of clueless
tourists or tourist traps, or that it’s rundown (true, but expensive efforts
are seeking to change that) or kitschy (ditto), we stand firm that all
tourists, especially first-time tourists, need to visit, puzzle over some of
the unrecognizable names in the boulevard’s Walk of Fame, and compare
their own footprints with those enshrined in cement outside Grauman’s
Chinese Theatre.
Enormous amounts of money are being thrown at the Hollywood area, in
the hopes of cleaning up the boulevard and giving it a whole new legiti-
mate personality. Right now, the results are mixed. Sure, the fabulous
Hollywood & Highland Center, home to the Kodak Theatre (which
hosts the Oscars; when it’s not hosting the Oscars, plays, concerts, and
other live entertainment — the finale of American Idol, for example — fill
the seats), along with many generic shopping-mall stores, not to mention
several fine glamorous old theaters. But the neighborhood still lacks
good, affordable restaurants. Instead, it remains an excess of tacky sou-
venir and T-shirt stores and a number of shops selling naughty lingerie
and high heels clearly meant for strippers. Sparkly glitter in the asphalt
goes only so far, you know.
The following are the most obvious and prominent Hollywood locales.
Don’t be snooty; it’s your job as a visitor to see these places at least once
(and frankly, we rather delight in having out-of-town guests, because then
we have a legitimate opportunity to make return visits ourselves). If you
hit each site listed and spend a certain amount of time at each listed site
(but don’t linger), it will take about half a day to see them all. If you want
to tour the real Hollywood (studios and scandals), get yourself a copy of
Ken Schessler’s This Is Hollywood (Ken Schessler Publishing; $5.95), a
comprehensive guide to the history of Hollywood, from landmarks to
murders and suicides. Updated regularly, it offers tours of the significant
local sites of renown and infamy.
Grauman’s Chinese Theatre
Normally, this is when we haul out phrases like “newly restored to its
former glory.” Although it’s true that Sid Grauman’s fabulous movie palace,
built in 1927 and designed to look like a Chinese temple, has been given a
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 387

massive facelift, the restoration removed some of the 1950s glitz — usually
a good thing, but in this case it turned what was a riot of Oriental stylings
into a rather dull-gray concrete structure. Authentic is not always best, we
note. Heck, even the neon dragons are gone! But at least the Mann chain
(which bought the theater some years ago) officially returned the name
Grauman (locals never did cave and call it Mann’s Chinese Theater), and
the interior remains a classic example of glorious movie-theater pomp, all
deep reds and gilt and fanciful curlicues, along with one giant screen. And
of course, there are the footprints immortalized in concrete outside the
theater. It began as a publicity stunt — oh, heck, it’s still a publicity stunt,
but thank heavens for it, because how else could we see that Mary
Pickford had such itty-bitty feet? How else could there have been one of
the best I Love Lucy shows of all time, when Lucy “borrowed” John Wayne’s
bootprints as a souvenir? (The Duke’s bootprints are still here. And they
are surprisingly small.) Yes, the stars of yesteryear, and some of today,
have enshrined their shoeprints, hand prints, and in some cases nose
prints (Jimmy Durante) and leg prints (Betty Grable) in concrete, to last
beyond their ruin. Go ahead, compare your appendages to theirs — you
know you want to. And when you’re done, see any movie at the theater (as
long as it’s on the big screen), even if it’s terrible, because it’s what the
movie-going experience ought to be.

Hollywood & Highland Center
The Hollywood & Highland Center is a little bit nightlife, a little bit attrac-
tion, and a whole lot shopping — but we’re sticking it here because it’s in
Hollywood, right in the middle of everything else you’re seeing and doing.
Plus, it is the spiffy centerpiece of what the city still desperately hopes will
be a major rejuvenation of Hollywood Boulevard. But basically, when you
get right down to it, it’s a shopping mall. A grand shopping mall, to be sure.
We glory in the detailing that includes quotes in mosaic from anonymous
actors and others about their epic struggles to “Make It,” the way the stair-
case entrance is designed to frame the Hollywood sign, the courtyard full
of stands and umbrellas and cafe tables, and, best of all, the Babylon
Court, which pays homage to D.W. Griffith’s fantastic Babylon set for his
movie Intolerance. The Kodak Theatre was built specifically as a perma-
nent home for the Academy Awards show, although it also hosts concerts
and theater road companies throughout the year. Hollywood & Highland
is also the home to Jimmy Kimmel Live (which airs late-night on ABC), and
bands often play live right there in the complex. You can also find two
nightclubs, a bowling alley, access to nearby movie theaters, restaurants,
and a self-guided audio tour of the Walk of Fame. They did a fine job with
the design, we have to admit — for a shopping mall.

The Hollywood Sign
Iconic. We so rarely get to use this word properly, so savor the moment.
What else would you call those nine 50-foot-tall white letters, perched high
up in the Hollywood Hills? They constitute one of the most instantly rec-
ognizable sights in the world. The sign dates back to 1923, and it originally
read “Hollywoodland,” the name of the development it was drawing atten-
tion to. (The last four letters came down in the ’40s.) Struggling actors,
despairing of ever getting their big break, were rumored to have made it a
favorite suicide spot, but the only person confirmed to have actually done
so was actress Peg Entwhistle, who jumped off the letter H in 1932, poor
despondent dear. You can’t drive to the sign, nor can you walk right up to
it, but you can hike up from Durand Avenue off of Beachwood Canyon. You
can get a good picture from Sunset Boulevard at Gower and also at
Bronson; otherwise, drive up Beachwood ’til it gets closer and closer and
you get the shot you want.
See map p. 362. At the top of Beachwood Canyon.
Hollywood Walk of Fame
Granite stars rimmed in brass are implanted in the sidewalk on Hollywood
Boulevard (and down Vine Street toward Sunset Boulevard), with the
names of the Greats and the once Greats (and those who had really good
publicists and some pocket change) of film, radio, television, and the
recording arts. We hate to shatter any illusions, but the stars pay for their
stars; pretty much anyone, of a rather minimal level of success, can get
nominated. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, after making sure he
or she can cough up the money, gives out a star. But so what? Walk along
Hollywood Boulevard and see how many names you still recognize (to say
nothing of seeing what strange accidental neighbors the juxtaposition of
names creates). It’s something you should do at least once.

Los Angeles
It’s goopy, it’s smelly, it’s oozing, and it’s wonderful . . . it’s the La Brea Tar
Pits. It’s a gruesome story, so let’s repeat it. Millions of years ago (okay,
40,000 — whatever), unsuspecting prehistoric critters (wooly mammoths,
saber-toothed tigers) would wander over to an attractive pool of water
and wade out in it, only to discover that the water was floating on top of
tar, in which they would then be permanently stuck. Death would follow
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 389

(starvation or suffocation), their bodies would sink down into the muck
(sometimes thus additionally condemning a predator, who had hopped on
thinking it was getting an easy meal by preying on a trapped beastie —
sucker!), and there they stayed, until the world discovered archaeologists.
The archaeologists found that if you dredge those pits (and a messy busi-
ness that is), you can find whole, beautifully preserved skeletons. And so
they dig, or exhume, or whatever you call it when you have to grope
around in tar pits, and they put what they find on display. And amazingly,
all this is located along Wilshire Boulevard, one of the busiest streets in
L.A. In fact, all the buildings in this complex (including the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art next door) are built to float, more or less, on the tar,
which remains in full forceful presence. (And it’s still sticky, even if you’re
just picking up a little bit to give to someone as a souvenir — not that we
know from personal experience or anything.) Kids love it. During the late
summer, the pits are open to the viewing public, so you can see the sci-
entists at work as they try to excavate more bones.
See maps p. 358 and p. 362. 5801 Wilshire Blvd. % 323-934-7243. www.tarpits.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art
Los Angeles
The Getty Center (see the “More terrific museums” section later in this
chapter) is worth seeing for the house, but this museum complex (itself a
wacko marriage of architectural styles) is the place to go if you want to see
first-rate art collections. Indeed, this museum contains the finest encyclo-
pedic art collection west of the Mississippi, perhaps second only to the Met
in NYC. Most impressive is the Japanese Pavilion (the only building outside
of Japan dedicated to Japanese art), which has shoji-like exterior walls that
let in soft natural light, allowing you to see the magnificent collection as it
was meant to be seen. The museum also excels at modern and contempo-
rary works, includes a mind-blowing Dada collection, and has a terrific cos-
tumes and textiles collection. Because LACMA usually draws in the
high-profile traveling collections (Van Gogh, the recent King Tut exhibit,
and so on), the special exhibitions are standouts more often than not.
LACMA can easily occupy an entire day, but we suggest not trying to see
the whole place. Instead, pick up a map upon arrival, dedicate three hours
to the areas that most interest you, and then move on to another museum
along Museum Row for something completely different.
See maps p. 358 and p. 362. 5905 Wilshire Blvd. % 323-857-6000. www.lacma.org.

Petersen Automotive Museum
Los Angeles
This quintessential Southern California museum is dedicated to — what
else? — car culture. Four floors creatively display more than 200 sets of
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
390

wheels, from the first Ford Model Ts to groovy hot rods, one-of-a-kind
movie rides, and cars of the future. This terrific museum is a real blast —
and so mythically, marvelously L.A. It is well worth a couple of hours; put
it high on your sightseeing list.

Luther King Day, Labor Day, and Memorial Day), closed on other major holidays.
More terrific museums
California ScienCenter
Downtown
This highly enjoyable institution, a long-term L.A. staple, formerly known
as the Museum of Science and Industry, got a complete makeover, which
helped bring it as up to date as a museum that focuses on the wonders of
science and industry ought to be (it’s so hard to keep pace, isn’t it?). Learn
about the human body thanks to Tess, the 50-foot woman (she’s like a giant
version of that fabled model toy), build miniature structures and find out
how earthquake-proof they are (and sample some quake-shaking yourself),
learn about physical development (from how a single cell turns into that
complex system known as a human being to the timeless fun of watching
chicks hatch), or ride a bike on a cable three stories above ground (it’s
safe, but it costs extra). There is plenty of hands-on, interactive fun, again
of the sort that probably thrills adults for its cleverness more than kids,
who are often more interested in the bright lights and loud noises than
learning. But that’s okay, you’re on vacation, and a little education is bound
to sink in anyway, even by accident. Naturally, it’s hugely popular with
school field trips, so take that into consideration when you plan your own
visit. An IMAX theater generally shows features tied to either permanent
or traveling exhibits.
700 State Dr. (in Exposition Park). % 323-724-3623. www.casciencectr.org.

Getty Center
Brentwood
If you’re not the Universal Studios type, chances are good that you’re vis-
iting L.A. to see this high-profile arts center, which opened to great acclaim
in late 1997 and houses 20th-century millionaire (sounds so quaint now,
doesn’t it?) J. Paul Getty’s enormous collection of art. The collection
includes not only the antiquities that were at the old Getty Museum, but
also early Renaissance and Impressionist paintings (including van Gogh’s
Irises), French decorative arts, illuminated manuscripts, and contempo-
rary photography and graphic arts. The galleries are state of the art and
the collections extensive, but, as a whole, not nearly as impressive as what
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 391

you can see at LACMA (which also mounts the best traveling exhibitions)
or, even better, the Norton Simon (detailed later in this section). In fact, if
it weren’t for fear of art majors everywhere gunning for us, we’d say it’s a
bit underwhelming. Then again, recent high-profile scandals over forged or
looted art have made everyone a bit wary. Ultimately, Richard Meier’s
ultramodern complex is the real draw. It presides over the landscape with
appropriate grandeur, and the views are stunning. The alfresco spaces are
as impressive as the interior ones, particularly the circular gardens.
Don’t bother coming unless you have at least three or four hours to spare.
A great way to avoid the crowds is to visit later in the afternoon, especially
on Fridays, when the center is open until 9 p.m. The sunset and after-dark
panoramic views are lovely, and the Westside and Santa Monica are con-
venient for a late dinner.
You can also make your way up PCH to the Getty’s original home, built in
the manner of a classical Roman villa, which currently houses the insti-
tute’s ancient Greek, Roman, and Etruscan collections. Beautifully reno-
vated in a process that took years, and already in a striking setting
overlooking the Pacific, it is a charming and special museum visit unlike
anything else in Los Angeles. Though the scandals touch here, too, this
collection is certainly superb.
You may want to pair your visit to the main Getty Center with a stop at 
the relatively new (and also strikingly modern) Skirball Cultural Center,
2701 N. Sepulveda Blvd., at Mulholland Drive (% 310-440-4500; www.
skirball.org), whose galleries focus on the marriage of Jewish life and
the American Dream. It’s quickly establishing a reputation for top-flight
temporary exhibits, too. Admission is $8 adults, $6 seniors and students,
and free for kids younger than 12. Open Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, and
Saturday noon to 5 p.m., Thursday noon to 9 p.m., and Sunday 11 a.m. to
5 p.m.

Museum of Contemporary Art/MOCA at the Geffen Contemporary
Downtown
See, first they decided to build L.A. a contemporary art museum, but they
needed to start the museum up before the real building was in place, so
they used a warehouse-like building near Little Tokyo. It was dubbed the
Temporary Contemporary. Then the real building (a geometric structure
that promptly won architectural awards) opened, on Grand Street, near the
Music Center, but by then everyone loved the Temporary Contemporary
so much (for one thing, it’s fun to say!) that it was made permanent. Then
David Geffen gave a great deal of money, as he is wont to do, to the 
institution and the Temporary became the Geffen Contemporary, except
many locals still don’t call it that (because it’s not as euphonious). Anyway,
the upshot is that L.A. has one museum in two locations. All mediums are
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
392

represented, from abstract to pop art to emerging new artists. Both loca-
tions offer permanent collections (Lichtenstein, de Kooning, Warhol,
Rauschenberg, Rothko, Schnabel, Stella, Pollock, and Arbus) and special
exhibits. The Geffen is more likely to have conceptual or installation art,
simply because the shape of the facility is conducive to such exhibits. Free
gallery tours, offered by most-knowledgeable docents, are regularly offered
several times most days — we highly encourage you to plan a visit around
these, because they’re among the best deals in L.A. Admission covers both
buildings, and a shuttle runs regularly between the two buildings; plan to
spend at least an hour at each, probably a bit more. Recently, MOCA
opened a small branch at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood to
satisfy those unwilling or unable to make the trek from WeHo to downtown.

Museum of Television & Radio
Beverly Hills
Ah, the timeless family-vacation dilemma: Junior is whining about having
to visit some dusty old art exhibit because he feels that it would really be
a lot more fun to watch TV. Voilà — the solution: a contemporary museum
(a branch of the institution located in New York City) where the idiot box
is enshrined and treated like the cultural touchstone it really is. This
museum has a few galleries to see, but the real heart of the matter are the
private consoles, which allow you to conjure up your favorite moments of
broadcast history, from the Beatles’s first appearance on the Ed Sullivan
Show to the crumbling of the Berlin Wall. Open screenings can range from
“Laurence Olivier: Four Crowning Achievements” to “The World of Hanna-
Barbara” — call or check the Web site for the current calendar. There’s a
two-hour limit on the consoles — but if no one is waiting, getting a second
library pass for a second two hours is easy.

Museum of the American West
Los Angeles
The Singing Cowboy, Gene Autry, loved the Wild West and the money it
made him. This museum was his gift to Southern California. It’s mostly a
romanticized view of the Old West, with emphasis on the romance of the
cowboy. The uninformed could easily come away from a visit believing
that nothing really bad happened during the country’s relentless pursuit
of Manifest Destiny, it was all for the Good of America. (You know, as in, it’s
kind of too bad we killed the buffalo, but wasn’t it fun to shoot them from
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 393

trains?) Still, although the museum is rather Hollywood pop culture, it is
most entertaining, and popular with the kids (and, alas, school groups).
Seven galleries feature all aspects of the West, including the Gallery of
Western Expansion. Combine it with other Griffith Park sightseeing (see
the “Playing in Griffith Park” section later in this chapter) for a solid half-
day of fun.

a.m.–5 p.m. (until 8 p.m. Thurs).
Museum of Tolerance
West Los Angeles
One can make the argument that tolerance or, rather, lack thereof, is at the
base of many of the most pressing issues of our day. Note that this isn’t to
say everyone has to like each other; we just have to tolerate each other by
learning to understand each other and allow for differences in appearance,
religious worship, and cultural mores. We ignore this to our peril. The
Holocaust is the most obvious example of the tragedies and horrors that
occur when this sort of understanding and acceptance fails to manifest,
and this excellent facility naturally focuses much attention on that horrific
event. The exhibits include many interactive and video displays. Located
in the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the museum covers many more related
areas — in other words, this isn’t just a Holocaust museum. It’s designed
to topple many of your preconceived notions from the very beginning,
when you have a choice of starting your tour through one of two doors —
“prejudiced” and “not prejudiced.” Guess which one simply doesn’t open
at all? Note that the museum is laid out so that you follow a mandatory
route, which can take up to three hours to complete.
See map p. 358. 9786 W. Pico Blvd. (at Roxbury Drive). % 310-553-8403. www.museum

dents with ID. Open: Mon–Thurs 11:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m., Fri 11:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Sun 11

Norton Simon Museum of Art
Pasadena
Packaged-foods mogul Norton Simon gathered a mind-blowing art collec-
tion, now housed on the Rose Parade route (and under the direction of his
widow, actress Jennifer Jones). It’s a stunning — and undisputedly excel-
lent — assemblage of European painting and sculpture spanning the 14th
through 20th centuries, with the masters extremely well represented. The
museum is well worth an afternoon excursion for serious art lovers,
although the rest of us may find it a little less than enthralling.

394

Southwest Museum
Highland Park
Opened in 1907, this was the first museum in Southern California; it is now
part of the Autry Center, which includes the Museum of the American West
and the Institute for the Study of the American West. Exhibits focus on the
grim flip side of the Old West myth presented by the Museum of the
American West (see the earlier listing). This fine, serious museum outlines
different aspects of Native American life, from clothing to religion, by cov-
ering the western tribes. There are three ways to enter this Mission-style
building: You can journey through a tunnel lined with very good dioramas
of Native Americans; you can walk up the Hopi Trail, which is very steep
and landscaped; or you can bypass it all and drive up to the tippy-top.
Local educators prefer the Southwest Museum (politically correct, sensi-
tive, and enlightened, not to mention educational) to the Museum of the
American West (rip-roaring cowboy fun), and we certainly understand and
don’t disagree. Of course, all of this got quite a shake-up when the Autry
people essentially bought the always financially struggling Southwest
Museum. Both are now under one blanket foundation umbrella. It’s too
early in the relationship to judge how this will affect either — more flash
for this one? More cred for the other? Stay tuned.
See map p. 362. 234 Museum Dr. (in the Highland Park District). % 323-221-2164.
www.southwestmuseum.org. Admission: Free. Open: Sat–Sun noon–5 p.m. and
on Mon holiday-observance days such as Martin Luther King Day, Labor Day, and
Memorial Day; closed on other major holidays.
Hitting the beaches
The following sections describe L.A.’s best beaches as they run along
PCH (Highway 1) from south to north (see the “Santa Monica and the
Malibu Beaches” map on p. 397).
Venice Beach and Ocean Front Walk
Starting at Venice Boulevard and running north to Rose Avenue is L.A.’s
beach scene at its wackiest, wildest, and sleaziest. The sand is less the
draw than the continuous carnival on the paved promenade known as
Ocean Front Walk that runs along the beach, where vendors sell dirt-
cheap merchandise, from sunglasses to silly tchotchkes, and busking
entertainers run the gamut from talking-parrot wranglers to chainsaw
jugglers. The constant crowd is the city’s most eye-popping and includes
plenty of muscle-bound pretty boys, buxom beach bunnies on in-line
skates, and tattooed biker types and their chicks.
Head elsewhere if you want to relax on the sand; come here for the local
color. Look in the blocks east of Pacific Avenue for a street parking space
or west of Pacific Avenue for a pay lot.
Santa Monica Beach and Pier
As you move north on Ocean Front Walk and cross into Santa Monica, the
scene gets appreciably prettier and more subdued. The walk opens up for
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 395

bikers and skaters, the beach is more suitable for playing and sunbathing,
the bay waters are calm, and the food options and facilities improve.
The best beach access is along Bernard Way, which runs parallel to
Ocean Avenue (called Neilson Way here) along the ocean from Marine
Street (2 blocks north of Rose Avenue) to Pico Boulevard. The scene is
very relaxed; this is where locals come to kick back. The sands are wide,
white, flat, and gorgeous, with grassy areas great for picnicking, good
facilities, a playground, and lots of parking.
If you’re looking for a livelier scene and more facilities, you may prefer
gathering midbeach on either side of the Santa Monica Pier (% 310-
458-8900; www.santamonicapier.org), at the end of Colorado Avenue.
After years of neglect, the landmark wooden amusement pier is back in
top form. It boasts a number of snack shacks and attractions, including a
turn-of-the-century carousel (% 310-458-8867) that had a featured role
in the movie The Sting. Pacific Park (% 310-260-8744; www.pacpark.
com) is a fun zone with a roller coaster, a dozen other rides, and old-
fashioned midway games. You can also stop in Playland Arcade (% 310-
451-5133) for high-tech arcade games. Below the carousel, at beach
level, is the Santa Monica Pier Aquarium, 1600 Ocean Front Walk (% 310-
393-6149; www.healthebay.org/smpa), where you can learn a thing or
two about the Santa Monica Bay marine environment (admission $5; free
for children younger than 12).
Weekends and summer daytimes are best for experiencing all that the
pier has to offer. If you’re visiting at another time, call the specific attrac-
tions that catch your interest before you go to avoid disappointment.
The pier is about a mile up Ocean Front Walk from Venice; it makes a
great round-trip stroll.
North of the pier along Ocean Avenue is Palisades Park, a lovely, grassy
bluff-top park with benches. Anyplace along here is a good place to stop
and take in the stunning ocean views; you’ll find lots of metered parking
(getting a spot is generally easier as you go north).
Rent bikes, in-line skates, boogie boards, baby joggers, beach chairs, and
umbrellas from Perry’s Beach Cafe (www.perryscafe.com), south of
the pier at 2400 and 2600 Ocean Front Walk, at Ocean Park Boulevard
(% 310-372-3138); and north of the pier at 930 and 1200 Pacific Coast
Hwy. (% 310-458-3975 and 310-260-1114). Bike and skate rentals run $8
to $14 per hour or $23 to $38 per day ($6 per hour for kids). Call for info
on skating lessons if you’re a newbie.
The Malibu beaches
An alternative to coming up through Santa Monica to reach these beaches
is to head west on Sunset Boulevard for a gorgeous, winding drive. Turn
left on Temescal Canyon Road (follow the “to PCH” signs) to reach Will
Rogers Beach; continue on Sunset all the way to PCH and turn right to
reach the others.

Santa Monica and the Malibu Beaches
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 397

 Will Rogers State Beach, which runs from Temescal Canyon Road
north to Sunset Boulevard, is where the Malibu vibe begins. The
Temescal (south) section of the beach is especially nice — wide,
flat, and pretty, with calm, swimmer-friendly surf, lifeguards, a
snack bar, restrooms, beach-toy rentals, and easy parking. Surfers
hang out at the north end, near Sunset.
 Malibu Lagoon State Beach, the curvaceous dark-sand beach and
natural wetlands north of the Malibu Pier, is extremely popular with
surfers. Swimming is allowed only in a small area near the pier,
where the waters are protected by rocky shallows. Come instead to
watch the locals hang-ten on the waves; weekends or after-work
hours are best. The entrance is just south of Cross Creek Road.
Parking will cost you a few bucks; do as the locals do and park
along the PCH to save the dough.
If you want to rent a surfboard — smart only if you already know
what you’re doing — head to Zuma Jay Surfboards, about 1⁄4-mile
south of Malibu Pier at 22775 Pacific Coast Hwy. (% 310-456-8044).
Surfboards are $20 for the day, wetsuits $10. You can also rent
bodyboards and kayaks.
 Paradise Cove is nestled well off the highway at the base of a cliff
at 28128 Pacific Coast Hwy., a mile south of Kanan-Dume Road. This
lovely private cove beach is pricey to visit but well worth the
dough if you’re looking for a pretty place to spend the day. The
beach is just a narrow curve, but a small parking lot keeps the
crowds at bay. Come early (before noon on weekends); the $25
parking charge ($5 for walk-ins) keeps out the riff-raff, but plenty of
families are more than happy to shell out for such a private haven.
The waters are especially calm and well-protected, and therefore
great for little ones. Claim your blanket space at the south end if
you plan to spend the whole day, because the north end becomes
shaded by mid-afternoon. On-site is Bob Morris’s Paradise Cove
Beach Cafe, plus picnic tables, restrooms, and nice changing
rooms with showers.
 Zuma Beach County Park is L.A.’s largest beach playground. Zuma
starts a mile north of Kanan-Dume Road (watch for the turnoff on
the right, which takes you under the highway). Beach-goers pack
the more than 2 miles of sand on warm summer weekends. They’re
drawn by the wide sand beach and comprehensive facilities, includ-
ing lifeguards, volleyball courts, swing sets, snack bars, and beach-
toy rentals. Restrooms are strategically placed along the beach, so
you’re never far from a bathroom. The wide expanse of sand (and
even wider parking lot) means that street noise isn’t a big problem,
especially when the revelers kick into high gear. Come midweek to
have plenty of sand for yourself or on the weekend to catch the
scene. Parking is $2 (at this writing, but will probably go up); 
bring exact change in the off-season, because the fee is collected
automatically.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
398

 You can separate yourself from the masses and the highway noise
by heading to Westward Beach, hidden by sandstone cliffs at the
south end of Zuma. To get there, turn left at Westward Beach Road
(at the Malibu Country Inn), two minutes after the Heathercliff Road
light (just before the right-hand turnoff for Zuma). At the end of
Westward Beach Road is a $6 parking lot for Point Dume State
Beach, another wonderful stretch of sand below the cliffs.
Playing in Griffith Park
Hilly, 4,000-acre Griffith Park (% 323-913-4688; www.laparks.org/
dos/parks/griffithPK/griffith.htm) is the nation’s largest public
municipal park and urban wilderness (five times as large as New York’s
Central Park). It was a donation of the double-barreled-named Colonel
Griffith J. Griffith, who was trying to 1) get on the city’s good side after a
messy courtroom drama involving the attempted murder of his wife, 2)
seek tax relief, and 3) remove a curse from his first wife (bad luck with
women), a Spanish land-grant heiress from whom he stole much of this
property. It’s popular with a strong cross-section of Angelenos, from 
families at play to picnicking bohos to the healthy and health-seeking,
marching up and down trails that range from easy to challenging. It has a
number of attractions worth seeking out, and makes a good place to
unwind or let the kids run off steam if you tire of the urban madness.
The park is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.
In addition to the Museum of the American West (see the “More terrific
museums” section earlier in this chapter), the park’s other biggest
attraction is the Griffith Observatory, 2800 E. Observatory Rd., at the
end of Vermont Avenue (% 323-664-1191; www.griffithobs.org). The
observatory reopened in 2006 after a years-long, $93-million makeover
that should make this white jewel on the hillside above the park gleam
more brightly than ever. When it’s reopened, you can look for most of
the innovations and upgrades inside. The gorgeous interiors, complete
with historic murals, will be restored, and the planetarium will be state
of the art. The bust to James Dean will remain (the climatic fight scene
from Rebel without a Cause was staged outside). Don’t miss the Leonard
Nimoy Event Horizon Theater, a gift from an actor who knows he owes a
debt or two to space. A trip up here, on a clear day, offers one of the
finest views of the city, and now the inside will match.
At the Travel Town Transportation Museum, 5200 Zoo Dr. (% 323-662-
5874; www.cityofla.org/RAP/grifmet/tt), kids can climb aboard vin-
tage trains. The adjacent Los Angeles Live Steamers (% 323-661-8958;
www.lals.org) can take you choo-chooing on a scale-model steam train.
Travel Town also rents bikes for two-wheel exploring (% 323-662-6573).
Also in the park is the Los Angeles Zoo (% 323-644-4200; www.lazoo.
org), which has experienced ups and downs in its career but is always a
hit with kids, and always has some extremely rare animals on display.
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 399

Hiking the trails
L.A.’s other favorite outdoor activity — no, it’s not that — it’s hiking!
There are some lovely trails, but figure you’ll never be alone, which can
be good — look carefully, movie stars may be hiding under those base-
ball caps. Will Rogers State Historic Park, 1501 Will Rogers State Park
Rd. (% 310-454-8212), off of Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades, is the
former home of the man who never met a man he didn’t like. It’s a sweet
little respite area and has easy trails through the Santa Monica
Mountains.
In Los Feliz, Griffith Park (see the “Playing in Griffith Park” section, earlier
in this chapter) has a 53-mile network of trails, including the Bronson
Canyon Trail, on the west side of Griffith Park, which goes past the Bat
Cave entrance from the old Batman TV series; the canyon itself starred in
many a TV Western. Trails close at dusk.
Runyon Canyon (Franklin Avenue at Fuller Boulevard in the Hollywood
Hills) is part of the old Errol Flynn estate, and the easy trails offer
astounding views. But they are crowded, and if you don’t like dogs (many
of which are off-leash), avoid this place, especially on weekends and after
4 p.m. daily. But keep in mind that anytime you go you may run into
famous faces catching fresh air alone or with their dogs or trainers.
Always bring a nice big bottle of water on your hikes and wear sunblock.
If you’re hiking in the spring and summer, be aware that there are snakes,
specifically rattlesnakes, and they can be very cranky when disturbed.
Wear light-colored clothes and appropriate shoes, stay on the trails, and
don’t try to pick up anything that looks like a stick.
Studio tours and TV tapings
This is Tinseltown; of course you want to see Hollywood in action! We
recommend that visitors call the studios before visiting to ensure that
they are keeping the hours listed below. 
Studio tours
In addition to the backlot tour at Universal Studios Hollywood (see the
“Exploring L.A.’s Top Attractions” section earlier in this chapter), here
are a few other studio tours worth considering.
NBC Studios
Burbank
This 70-minute, behind-the-scenes walking tour includes sets of the Tonight
Show with Jay Leno; wardrobe, makeup, and set construction demonstra-
tions; and special-effects and sound-effects sets. You should call at least
two weeks in advance for tickets.
3000 W. Alameda, Burbank. % 818-840-3538. Admission: $8.50 adults, $7.50 seniors,
$5.50 children 5–12, and children under 5 free. Open: Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–3 p.m. on first-
come basis.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
400

Paramount Studios
Hollywood
Two-hour walking tour through the landmark gates, behind the scenes and
history, includes prop room, Foley studio, and the chance to see a star, or
at least a few extras in costume. Reservations required for the twice daily
tours.
5555 Melrose Ave. % 323-956-1777. Admission: $35. Tours: Mon–Fri 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.
Sony Pictures Studios
Culver City
Home to Columbia Pictures and Columbia TriStar Television, this two-hour
walking tour guides visitors through the facets of a real working studio.
Visit the archival museum, watch movie clips in a private screening room,
sneak a peek at artists painting scenic backdrops, and visit the stage set
of current television shows. Reservations are required during the summer.
10202 W. Washington Blvd. % 323-520-TOUR. Admission: $25 adults and children 12
and older, no one younger than 12 admitted. Open: Mon–Fri (call for hours).
Warner Bros. Studio Tour
Burbank
Visitors to this working movie and TV studio observe filming whenever
possible. The two-hour tour includes a film collage (Errol Flynn to Denzel
Washington), the Warner Bros. Museum, historic back lots, cavernous
soundstages, and the “world’s most extensive costume department.”
Reservations are available for the first three tours of the day; all others
are on a first-come-first-served basis.
Gate 4, Hollywood Way and Olive Avenue. % 818-972-TOUR. Admission: $39. Open:
Mon–Fri 8:30 a.m.–3 p.m.
TV tapings
For tickets to live tapings of TV shows, contact Audiences Unlimited
(% 818-753-3470; www.tvtickets.com), which provides audiences for
over two dozen shows. The schedule is updated daily, listing available
shows up to 30 days in advance. Your best chance to ensure getting 
tickets is to request shows that are new or not big hits. The highest-
rated comedies are sold out months in advance, so don’t plan a special
trip on the off chance that you’ll get tickets to your fave show.
Audiences Unlimited also has a booth inside Universal Studios, near the
tour departure area, that provides tickets for shows taping that day. Often,
it provides bus transportation from Universal Studios to the set of the
show. For details on show requirements (some talk shows include shots 
of the audience, for example, and may require a dress code for some 
tapings), go to Audiences Unlimited’s Web site or call its voice mailbox.
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 401

You also can take advantage of the opportunity to be an audience
member at shows taped on the Paramount Lot. Call % 323-956-1777.
Tickets are released five business days prior to a taping; however, you
can call and ask what shows have seats available.
Seeing L.A. by Guided Tour
We pretty much sniff at guided tours for Los Angeles; they just load you
on a bus or some other vehicle and show you the cheesiest sights. You
can easily do that on your own. But one we recommend is Architecture
Tours L.A. (% 323-464-7868; www.architecturetoursla.com), which
offers several two-hour tours, ranging from overviews and highlights of
L.A. architecture to specific programs designed around various neigh-
borhoods and their own special look (the Pasadena tour might special-
ize in Greene and Greene, for example, and the Silver Lake tour gives you
plenty of Neutra and Schindler). Customized tours are also available.
The owner has a master’s degree in architecture history, and tours are
conducted in a luxurious van with two sunroofs for maximum visibility.
Shopping ’til You Drop
Ardent shoppers won’t lack for diversions in Los Angeles. What follows
are L.A.’s finest hunting grounds. For a visual reference, see the “Los
Angeles’s Shopping Neighborhoods” map on p. 404.
Santa Monica
For the average tourist, this charming beach town offers the best shop-
ping possibilities, with a range from affordable to movie-star wealthy,
and all of it in pleasant walkable settings.
Third Street Promenade
This sunny pedestrian-only walk is a real crowd-pleaser, with something
for everyone: record shops, bookstores (mostly chains), and familiar
clothing chains and one-off boutiques. It’s a browser’s delight, and most
stores stay open for after-dinner shopping. Take the 10 freeway to
Fourth Street and park in a structure between Fourth and Second
streets.
Main Street
This hip, casual strip is the place to find the beach vibe in Santa Monica
shopping. The nice mix of national favorites, one-of-a-kind boutiques,
and sidewalk cafes between Rose Avenue and Strand (north of Ocean
Park Boulevard) makes for a lovely stroll. Check out the Web site at
www.mainstreetsm.com.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
402

Bergamot Station
Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave. (% 310-829-5854), is the city’s top
stop for contemporary art, with 20 beautifully browsable galleries run-
ning the gamut from Japanese paper to jewelry, painting, and sculpture.
Take the 405 to Cloverfield/26th Street, turn right on Cloverfield
Boulevard, and right on Michigan; parking is free and plentiful.
Montana Avenue
This grown-up shopping strip at the upscale north end of town is won-
derful for one-of-a-kind browsing. The best boutiquing is just east of
Ninth Street, where you’ll find lots of casually elegant clothing boutiques
for women. Visit www.montanaave.com for a rundown.
Beverly Hills’s Golden Triangle
This world-famous corner of couture is more accessible than you may
think. You may not be able to afford it, but good for you if you can!
Anchoring the retail area north of Wilshire Boulevard between Santa
Monica Boulevard and Rexford Drive are three high-fashion department
stores, NYC’s Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue, plus Texas cou-
turier Neiman Marcus, sitting like ducks in a row between 9500 and 9700
Wilshire.
Rodeo Drive is the most famous — and most exclusive — of the shop-
ping streets, with two Euro-style, piazza-like couture malls (2 Rodeo and
the Rodeo Collection), plus top designer boutiques such as Chanel, Van
Cleef and Arpels, and many more. But you’ll find plenty of reasonably
priced booty throughout the easily walkable area, too. For a list, see
www.beverlyhillsbehere.com. Though the city of Beverly Hills offers
two hours free parking in their underground lots, those can fill up
quickly, so expect to pay for a parking-lot space — bring quarters!
West Third Street
Right in the shadow of the famous Beverly Center mall (% 310-854-0071;
www.beverlycenter.com), which sits like a prison at Beverly and La
Cienega boulevards, is one of the city’s most appealing shopping streets.
Running east from La Cienega, West Third’s shops are whimsical, accessi-
ble, and just upscale enough, such as Traveler’s Bookcase, no. 8375 
(% 323-655-0575), and the Cook’s Library, no. 8373 (% 323-655-3141),
two of the best specialty bookstores around; and Freehand, no. 8413 
(% 323-655-2607), a first-rate crafts gallery. You should find meter park-
ing, although perhaps a couple blocks or more from precisely where you
want to be. Mall rats will enjoy the Grove (% 888-315-8883 or 323-900-
8080; www.grovela.com), with its dancing water show, 14-screen theater
designed to look like an Art Deco movie palace, and plenty of upscale
chain stores and eateries located at Third and Fairfax, just east of the
Farmers Market.

West Hollywood
Sunset Plaza is one of the oldest and poshest shopping districts in Los
Angeles. It lines both sides of Sunset Boulevard, from 8720 Sunset to
8589 Sunset, anchored on the southwest by the former Le Dome, home
away from home for many a now-bereft celebrity, and the celebrity caf-
feination spot Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on the northeast (Britney Spears,
Mark Wahlberg). There you’ll find superstar retailer Tracey Ross, 8595
Sunset Blvd. (% 310-854-1996), whose clients include some of the
brightest stars in Hollywood. Jeweler Philip Press, 8601 Sunset Blvd. 
(% 310-360-1180), offers fine platinum, colored stones, and diamonds,
while Armani Exchange, 8700 Sunset Blvd. (% 310-659-0171), and other
boutiques beckon. With over a half-dozen restaurants offering sidewalk
brunching, lunching, and dining (expect smokers on the patios), Sunset
Plaza provides a wealth of people-watching and a cosmopolitan flair. But
don’t park here unless you’re shopping here; guards are vigilant and
they will tow.

Chapter 23: Los Angeles 405
Hollywood
The hip, moneyed, and otherwise find the most righteous duds and
trends here.
Melrose Avenue
L.A.’s wildest shopping strip starts out sophisticated at La Cienega
Boulevard with Marc Jacobs (% 323-653-5100) and gets progressively
more rock-’n’-roll as you move east. This area is great for star sightings,
and the first place you should start is the Fred Segal boutique minimall,
at Crescent Heights (% 323-651-1800), where the famous faces come
and go at a fast and furious pace. East of Fairfax is where the Angelina
Jolie/Courtney Love skanky/cool style kicks in with an emphasis on fad-
dish shoes, cheap styles, and funky toys.

La Brea Avenue
The unsung stretch between Wilshire and Santa Monica boulevards is
terrific for fashionable and retro-fascinated shoppers. Best is mammoth,
eternally hip American Rag, Cie., 150 S. La Brea, north of Second Street
(% 323-935-3154), for high-end vintage wearables and vintage-like new
wear. Antiques shops and other curious furniture stores are thick along
this strip.
Hollywood Boulevard
Come here for dusty memorabilia shops full of vintage movie posters,
autographed lobby cards, dog-eared scripts, and the like. You’ll pay top
dollar for top quality at Hollywood Book & Poster, 6562 Hollywood
Blvd. (% 323-465-8764). Ignore the silly T-shirt and souvenir stores,
unless you absolutely promised someone a piece of kitsch.
Universal City
Just over the Cahuenga Pass from Hollywood, Universal City is both the
name of a sporadically interesting neighborhood (a section of Burbank)
and the complex that includes Universal Studios and Universal CityWalk.
Although there are a few older restaurants worth seeking out, the bulk of
your time will be spent at the theme park and shopping mall, leaving
little time for such explorations. 
Universal CityWalk
Adjacent to Universal Studios is a kid’s dream of a mall (% 818-622-4455;
www.citywalkhollywood.com). It’s a fake version of a real urban setting,
but kids love it. CityWalk also offers some good dining and nightlife
options — but, at $8, the parking fee is inexcusable. Take the 101 to
Universal Center Drive or Lankershim Boulevard.
Living It Up after Dark
To see what’s on, get the Sunday Los Angeles Times for its “Calendar”
section, or the free L.A. Weekly and New Times L.A. Also check “The
Guide” at the back of the glossy monthly mag Los Angeles. Use the Web
resources (see the “Gathering More Information” section, later in this
chapter) if you want to plan from home.
The major and the minor: Theater
One of the great surprises about L.A. is the high quality of its live-theater
scene. All those wannabes have to do something before they get their big
break on the CW, right? Actually, movie and TV actors often feel the urge
to conquer the stage after their celluloid successes — or to exercise their
atrophied live-acting chops.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
406

The Los Angeles Stage Alliance (% 213-614-0556; www.lastage
alliance.com) offers half-price Web tix to many major and minor
shows, some the same day and others a few days in advance. Here’s how
it works: Go online and choose the show you want, enter your credit-
card number, and the tickets will be waiting for you at the box office.
Full-price tickets for major stagings generally vary from $25 to $75, but
smaller productions can be as cheap as $10; you pay half, plus a service
charge between $2 and $5.
The major
Of course, Los Angeles has theater on a larger level, and that brings us
to downtown’s venerable Music Center (the Performing Arts Center of
Los Angeles County; www.musiccenter.org). Actually, it’s four separate
theaters: the gleaming Disney Concert Hall, 111 S. Grand Ave. (% 323-
850-2000), the new home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic, a Frank
Gehry–designed wonder of a building complete with state-of-the-art
acoustics, which you should drive or walk past even if you don’t attend
a concert; the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave. (% 213-
972-0711), which usually hosts classical music and opera; the Ahmanson,
135 N. Grand Ave. (% 213-628-2772; www.taperahmanson.com), the
mid-size theater that runs about four plays a year; and the smaller Mark
Taper Forum, 135 N. Grand Ave. (% 213-628-2772; www.taperahmanson.
com), with nearly in-the-round-seating. Along with the new Kirk Douglas
Theatre in Culver City, they are known as the Center Theater Group.
Another terrific stage is the Geffen Playhouse, 10886 Le Conte Ave.,
Westwood (% 310-208-5454; www.geffenplayhouse.com).
The minor
This town contains so many small theaters that your best bet is to start
with Los Angeles Stage Alliance (% 213-614-0556; www.lastage
alliance.com), which has all the current listings. You can also find ads
for plays in the L.A. Weekly. Companies worth seeking out include the
Colony Studio Theatre (% 818-558-7000; www.colonytheatre.org),
generally considered to be L.A.’s finest small company; the scrappy and
irreverent Actors’ Gang Theater (% 310-838-GANG; www.theactors
gang.com), which counts Tim Robbins among its founders; the West
Coast Ensemble Theater (% 323-525-0022; www.wcensemble.org),
known for smart stagings of familiar but well-chosen musicals and
dramas; and L.A. Theatre Works (% 310-827-0889; www.latw.org),
more often than not showcasing big-name actors in productions at the
Skirball Cultural Center.
A little night music at the Hollywood Bowl
If you seek out one special venue before all others, make it this legendary
alfresco bandshell at 2301 N. Highland Ave., at Odin Street (% 323-850-
2000; www.hollywoodbowl.org). Recently entirely renovated — this is
the fourth version of its iconic shell form — the Bowl is set in the hills
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 407

above Hollywood in a natural amphitheater. It’s a magical place to see a
show under the stars, including the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra
(in residence all summer). The season runs from June through September
and always includes a jazz series, summer fireworks galas, and other
events.
Box seats are usually sold to season subscription holders, so single-
ticket buyers generally end up in the bleacher seats or on the lawn. The
bleachers are packed tight for sold-out events, and the setup is not
overly comfortable. The magic of the evening more than compensates,
but if you prefer more space, opt for the lawn. (That extra blanket in the
closet of your hotel room will finally come in handy.)
One of the great Bowl traditions is picnicking before or during the show.
Most concertgoers bring their own gourmet spread and wine. If you’d
rather not bother, order a portable feast (with or without wine) from the
Bowl’s Food Services Department, now under the ownership of Patina,
one of L.A.’s best restaurants (see the “Where to Dine in Los Angeles”
section earlier in this chapter). It’s expensive — around $17 for the
cheapest cold entree all the way up to around $50 for a three-course
meal — but the Patina Group’s reputation for fine food and the conven-
ience of picking it up right there make it worth considering. Order by
phone (% 323-850-1885) at least a day prior.
To get there, take the 101 to the Highland Avenue exit. Parking is
extremely limited, so your best bet is to reserve a parking space in
advance, or use one of the Park-and-Ride or shuttle services, for which
you can purchase advance tickets. If you’re feeling hearty, note that the
Hollywood & Highland Center is about a mile and a half away, downhill.
You can park there for a $2 validation (buy a cookie or something at a
local shop, just to be fair) and hoof it up, thus avoiding the often ghastly
lines that form trying to exit the over-crowded Bowl parking lots. Call
the Bowl at % 323-850-2000, Ticketmaster at % 213-480-3232, or go
online to www.hollywoodbowl.org and click on “Getting to the Bowl”
for details.
The symphony in Los Angeles
We won’t say there’s just one game in town, but that’s sort of true (cer-
tainly, it’s hard to get anyone other than the critics to recall any other
options), and its name is the Los Angeles Philharmonic, 135 N. Grand
Ave. (% 213-850-2000; www.laphil.com), led by Finnish poster-boy
Esa-Pekka Salonen and offering an annual slate of regular performances,
celebrity-artist recitals, chamber music, and visiting artists-in-residence.
Prices vary according to the kind of performance but can be as cheap as
$12 (up in the heavens) and as expensive as $80.
The Philharmonic is now ensconced in its magnificent new home, the
Walt Disney Concert Hall. Designed by Frank Gehry, this is L.A.’s first
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert

real landmark building, a sinuous, sensuous, gleaming-silver, curvy
marvel that evokes a galleon ship, sails a’ billowing. You must see it,
even if you don’t attend a concert — but you should: The interior is
nearly as breathtaking as the outside, while the acoustics are so state of
the art that local music critics are running out of adjectives to describe
and praise it.
Opera in Los Angeles
It may not be La Scala (but then, what is?), but the Los Angeles Opera,
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave. (% 213-972-8001; www.
losangelesopera.com), regularly stages some extraordinary shows,
generally earning across-the-board raves. No wonder; besides the depth
of musical talent, the company has regular access to superb visual
artists, always creating sets and staging that sparks serious talk (even if
that talk runs to controversy, as with a recent stark, modern staging of
Bach’s Mass in B Minor). One complaint may be that the company relies
too heavily on tried-and-true classics, but then again, they also stage
and perform said classics magnificently. Placido Domingo is the opera’s
Artistic Director, and has been known to turn up as guest conductor, and
none other than Hollywood director Billy Friedkin (yes, The Exorcist guy)
recently directed Bartok’s Bluebeard’s Castle, so you can see the com-
pany does have a curious range.
Play it big and play it loud
For the less sedate, from rock to world and all points between, you’ll
likely find it playing at the Gibson Amphitheatre (formerly Universal
Amphitheatre — nostalgic locals still call it that) or the Greek Theatre.
The difference between them, more or less, is that the former is indoors,
and the latter outdoors. Note that parking for the Gibson means parking
at Universal CityWalk, and often a long walk it is from your lot to your
seat, so forego the high heels unless you’re really skilled at strolling in
stilettos.
Given our druthers, we like the Greek, 2700 N. Vermont Ave. (% 323-665-
1927; www.greektheatrela.com); built in the ’20s, it’s graceful and
pretty and set in the middle of Griffith Park, although its parking lot is a
nightmare. (We’ve taken to parking around Los Feliz Boulevard and walk-
ing the 3⁄4-mile up to the Greek. You’ll have company, so it’s safe enough.)
Bring a sweater, in case it gets chilly.
For those about to rock
Ah, yes, L.A. rocks. The city is thriving with new and veteran rock clubs,
and the music scene is hotter than Riverside asphalt (ouch!). The area
with the highest concentration of good rock clubs is the Sunset Strip in
West Hollywood. It’s well lit at night, and most venues have valet parking
as well as a variety of cover charges (call for details).

Avalon
Hollywood
This Art Deco ex-vaudeville theater on Vine across from the famed Capitol
Tower recently underwent a multimillion-dollar renovation that removed
some of the nostalgic charm but added some creature comforts. Once
known as the Hollywood Palace (as such, the site of a ’60s TV variety
show) and later just the Palace (primarily used for music events, with
Nirvana, Prince, and many other major acts having played there), it now
offers rock events, and on Fridays and Saturdays hosts popular dance-club
events into the wee hours, along with dining, several full bars, and a pri-
vate club-within-a-club called the Spider Room.
1735 N. Vine St. % 323-462-8900. www.avalonhollywood.com.
Key Club
West Hollywood
At the west end of the Sunset Strip is the ultrasnappy Key Club. This post-
modern rock club was built at the site of a legendary L.A. rock club called
Gazzarri’s (think the early Doors but later Van Halen), and in a few short
years has become a very popular destination for live music and late-night
dancing.
9039 Sunset Blvd. % 310-274-5800.
Largo
Hollywood
People are so devoted to this live-music supper club that if you duck out of
the show early, you may get the stink-eye. It’s understandable — musical
mad-hatter Jon Brion, who produced the Magnolia soundtrack, and such
artists as Fiona Apple perform quirky sets each Friday to a star-studded
audience. Monday nights is comedy with name performers (Sarah Silverman
shows up regularly as well as Patton Oswald), and a variety of musical and
comedy acts, ranging from unknowns to the likes of Margaret Cho fill out
the rest of the week. You may want to make dinner reservations to assure
seating, though standing room is an option even when the tables are full.

The Roxy
West Hollywood
Since the early ’70s, this Sunset Strip club has been part of the celebrated
Hollywood rock triumvirate that included the Whisky a Go-Go and the
Troubadour. Although its history includes storied shows by Neil Young,
Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, and many others, these days the Roxy
tends to host unknown local acts trying to break into the business.

Safari Sam’s
Hollywood
The reincarnation of a mid-’80s local live-music staple, this 465-person venue
features local and touring acts ranging from punk rock and New Wave pro-
genitors such as Agent Orange and the Plimsouls to touring up-and-comers,
along with theme clubs such as the retro-fashioned Dandy where attendees
sport garb from the 1820s to the 1930s. The space also features a restaurant
and art gallery. A fine addition to the L.A. club scene — welcome back!

Spaceland
Silver Lake
The Silver Lake nightclub that started it all still rocks. The live-music venue
born out of an old discothèque is permanently art-damaged and not terri-
bly fancy, but that’s part of its charm. Surprise guests show up often during
the week, and artists such as Beck, Daniel Lanois, and Fiona Apple have
performed spontaneous sets.
1717 Silver Lake Blvd. % 323-661-4380. www.clubspaceland.com. 
The Troubadour
West Hollywood
Just down the hill from the Sunset Strip is this veteran nightclub offering
cutting-edge live music. The wood-grain interior is a relic from the days
when this cozy Hollywood club showcased the Byrds and the Eagles in the
’60s and ’70s. It was also a key stop for such quintessential L.A. acts as Van
Halen in the ’70s and Motley Crüe in the ’80s. In recent years, the booking
has been something of a hodgepodge, but it’s a good bet that some local,
national, and international alt-rock acts on their way up will stop here, as
well as some surprises: The Red Hot Chili Peppers played here under an
assumed name to show off the Stadium Arcadium album to their friends
before leaving on their 2006–2007 world tour.
9081 Santa Monica Blvd. % 310-276-6168. www.troubadour.com.
The Viper Room
West Hollywood
The music legacy of the Viper Room is unparalleled. Since its ’93 debut,
this black-hot nightclub formerly owned by that red-hot actor Johnny
Depp has featured world-class talent on a weekly basis. You never know
who’s going to show up on stage — or in the audience.

Snazzy bars
There’s nothing like a night on the town at one of Hollywood’s gorgeous
bars. We handpicked some of our favorites, narrowing the list from many
choices based on style, comfort, and easy access.
One of Hollywood’s hottest bars is Beauty Bar, 1638 Cahuenga Blvd. 
(% 323-464-7676; www.beautybar.com), a luscious pink confection
with DJs nightly. The bar, designed to look like an old-school beauty
parlor (the original in New York was an actual beauty parlor), serves real
martinis and real manicures (on weekends by appointment).
The Velvet Margarita Cantina, 1612 Cahuenga (% 323-469-2000; www.
velvetmargarita.com) — a huge, campy, sexy, semi-Goth-themed
Mexican bar/restaurant with black-light paintings, velvet Elvis portraits,
a ceiling made of silver mariachi hats, and purple velvet booths — fea-
tures (what else) tequilas and margaritas. It also serves food and has
thoughtfully single-priced the appetizers and entrees to make splitting
the bill easier on its lubricated patrons.
If you’re going to either of these, parking is directly across the street, but
you run the risk of a jaywalking ticket or, worse, getting creamed by a
speeding car. Use the crosswalks 200 feet to the north or the valet park-
ing in front of the venues!
What if you could shop for shoes while sipping on a cocktail? Well, Star
Shoes, 6364 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood (% 323-462-7827), can grant
you your wish. The beautiful bar doubles as a shoe store, with eye-
popping displays of vintage shoes enticing customers in off the street.
There’s a dance floor for late-night frolicking and an easy-breezy atti-
tudeless atmosphere. Open nightly.
As much a club as it is a bar, Ivan Kane’s Forty Deuce, 5574 Melrose Ave.
(% 323-465-42424), was the flashpoint for the revival of burlesque, the
classy bump and grind that put the tease back in striptease, and made it
safe for the whole family. Okay, maybe not, but the gals here put on such
a good show that any number of celebs (and we mean high-level names
such as Brad and Justin) can be found gathered around the runway,
shamelessly urging them on. Particularly skilled DJs keep the beat going
when the girls are offstage. Expect a cover charge and bad sightlines,
unless you reserve a table, which will set you back even more.
During the warm-weather months, the Cat & Fiddle, 6530 Sunset Blvd.,
Hollywood (% 323-468-3800), is a favorite watering hole for the beer-
drinking set. The British pub features a large outdoor patio, with live
music on weekends. The staff is particularly nice, and the authentic fish
and chips lure people back year after year. It’s a good place for a large
party. Open nightly; 21 and older at night, all ages during the day.
The legendary Lava Lounge, 1533 N. La Brea Ave., Hollywood (% 323-
876-6612; www.lavahollywood.com), opened its doors a month before
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
412

the great quake of January ’94, and it’s still shaking. The tiki-themed bar,
which erupts with live music Wednesday through Saturday nights, once
called Quentin Tarantino and Jon Favreau (of Swingers fame) regulars,
and now it’s serving up a whole new breed. The exotic drinks are
adorned with plastic monkeys and mermaids, and you can’t beat that
with a swizzle stick. Open nightly; 21 and older.
Stop by the Dresden Lounge, 1760 Vermont Ave., Los Feliz (% 323-665-
4294; www.thedresden.com), and give a thumbs up to Marty and Elayne,
the jazz combo popularized in the movie Swingers. We’ve known that
lovely couple for a long time now, and frankly, they’re tired of being asked
to play “Stayin’ Alive.” Do us a favor: Ask Elayne to play “Autumn in New
York”; she’ll blow you a kiss. Marty and Elayne perform Monday through
Saturday; 21 and older in lounge.
At ten years old, the Three Clubs, 1123 N. Vine St., Hollywood (% 324-
462-6441), was among the first of the new wave of hipster bars that took
Hollywood by storm in the late ’80s and ’90s. It still has that sizzle, with
its dark interior, friendly bartenders, and casual-cool clientele. Some
nights you may find a DJ lurking in the back room, where it’s really fun to
lurk. Twenty-one and older.
At this writing, the latest steaming hot hangout was tiny Hyde Lounge,
8029 Sunset Blvd. (% 323-656-4933), which means that by the time you
read this, it will either be a must-stop for any serious partying visitor, or
it will have cooled into nonexistence. If it’s still as sizzling as when we
wrote this, expect supreme difficulty gaining entrance (all the more to
whet your appetite), including valets who might not even take your car
until they’re assured you’re in the door. Feeling inferior? Frankly,
because we don’t have names like Nichole Richie, Lindsay Lohan, Paris
Hilton, and others who have acted up and out during this club’s early
days, so do we. If you get in, enjoy the floor show they’ll likely provide.
The Tropicana at the Hollywood Roosevelt, 7000 Hollywood Blvd. 
(% 323-466-7000), was the hottest bar until Hyde opened, but it’s prob-
ably likely to stick around longer, thanks to the oh-so-L.A. poolside den
vibe. As always, it can be a hard bar to crack if you aren’t super famous,
though renting a cabana room at the hotel guarantees entree. If watching
the likes of Jeremy Piven, Owen Wilson, Kirsten Dunst, the Hilton sisters,
and assorted sordid Hollywood types gives you the thrills, we suggest
you get there early — and avoid Thursday nights when the velvet rope is
notoriously solid.
Drinks with a view
There are any number of reasons to visit the Highlands, 6801 Hollywood
Blvd., Hollywood (% 323-461-9800), a grand nightclub and restaurant at
the new Hollywood & Highland Center, home to the Academy Awards and
the Kodak Theatre. First, the bilevel club is located on the fourth floor of
Hollywood & Highland and offers a terrific view of Hollywood Boulevard.
Second, its Friday- and Saturday-night dance parties are fueled by top
Chapter 23: Los Angeles 413

local and touring DJs. The club includes three outdoor decks and plenti-
ful parking at the complex. And when you get tired of boogieing, you can
window-shop at swanky and trendy Hollywood & Highland boutiques.
Cover varies ($15–$20 on weekends); 21 and older.
One of the legendary L.A. haunts, Yamashiro, 1999 Sycamore Ave.,
Hollywood (% 323-466-5125; www.yamashirorestaurant.com), still has
our favorite view. The classic Japanese restaurant overlooks Hollywood in
all its glory, and if you arrive in time for sunset, you can settle in for the
night and watch the colors of the sky fade from pink to ink. It’s terribly
romantic and worth the long, winding drive up the hill. No cover; open
nightly.
Gay faves
Just a couple of blocks from the hard-rocking hetero nightlife of the Sunset
Strip lies the heart of gay Los Angeles, Santa Monica Boulevard and what
is affectionately (most of the time) known as Boys’ Town. Most of West
Hollywood is gay-friendly, but the area near San Vicente Boulevard boasts
the hottest of the hot meeting places, stores, restaurants, and of course
nightclubs.
No matter what year or what day of the week, Rage, 8911 Santa Monica
Blvd., West Hollywood (% 310-652-7055; www.ragewesthollywood.
com), rages. The long-running gay dance club is a scorcher of a scene,
although it’s aggressively young, pretty, and trendy, so you may want to
stop at the gym and do a few thousand ab crunches before you go. Rage
books a wide variety of DJs, who spin everything from progressive house
to alternative rock. Cover varies; 21 and older.
Micky’s, 8857 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood (% 310-657-1176;
www.mickys.com), is sort of “Rage Lite,” with all the big crowds, packed
dance floor, and pretty men, but a little less stand-and-pose attitude.
Cover varies; 21 and older most nights.
Other notable Boys’ Town bars include the Abbey, 692 N. Robertson
Blvd., West Hollywood (% 310-289-8410; www.abbeyfoodandbar.com),
a trendy java joint and restaurant by day and a busy indoor/outdoor
cruise bar at night, growing all the more popular thanks to its new
owner, a local club impresario; Revolver, 8851 Santa Monica Blvd., West
Hollywood (% 310-659-8851), a video bar hosting very popular karaoke
events several nights a week; and just to prove it’s not all about the
boys, there’s Girl Bar at the Factory, 652 La Peer Dr., West Hollywood
(% 310-659-4551), L.A.’s hottest lesbian nightclub. The spacious dance
party boasts women DJs, go-go dancers, and promoters. It’s a weekly
girl-power powwow (although Fridays only and with a $10 cover).
One of the most popular West Hollywood bars is actually located a couple
of miles up the street from the Boys’ Town epicenter, but it’s worth the
trek. Fubar, 7994 Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood (% 323-654-0396;

The Happiest Place 
on Earth: The Disneyland
Resort!
In This Chapter
 Planning your visit
 Getting there
 Finding the perfect places to stay and eat
 Practicing proven tips for touring the legendary park
 Exploring the resort’s newest attractions
I
s it really the “Happiest Place on Earth?” Who can say (there are
places in Bali that are very happy, indeed), but we have to admit, we
get happy just writing the word Disneyland.
Sure, the one in Florida may be bigger, and the one in France may have
Pirates singing in French (quelle hoot!), but this is the original. “Walt’s
Folly,” the naysayers called it, because they predicted an embarrassing,
costly failure, bless them. It didn’t fail, naturally. And decades after its
conception, it remains the top sight of Southern California. With or with-
out a kid, we recommend visiting at least once.
Disneyland is no longer just Disneyland; it is now the Disneyland Resort,
which encompasses Walt’s original amusement park, the ambitious theme
park California Adventure, three hotels, and the big dining/entertaining/
shopping complex known as Downtown Disney. Downtown Disney is
actually located outside the park (although it’s considered part of it), but
you may find yourself walking through it to get to Disneyland (on the left)
or California Adventure (on the right), depending on your arrival point.
Downtown Disney has no entrance fee and no gate, but you have to pay
for parking if you drive in. Anyone who wants to leave the resort to visit
Downtown Disney can have a hand stamped for re-admittance to the
parks. To lure teens and the college crowd, Downtown Disney offers clubs
and other late-night attractions; to lure moms and dads, there are fancy
restaurants and shopping.

It would be easy to dismiss the park as commerce over fantasy, because
Disneyland has always been about product tie-ins (although really slick
about it — a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down, don’t you
know). But in every inch of the place, a tremendous amount of thought,
detail, research, and, yes, imagination is still given. No matter how it
evolves, Disneyland remains a place of delight, a place where even in the
midst of souvenir stands and overpriced snacks, a kid can burst into gig-
gles of pure joy because a mouse waved at him. And every time we go,
we still play the game of who can spot the Matterhorn first, and shiver
with pleasure when it appears, because that means we’re almost there.
Choosing When to Visit
The best time to visit may be when you have vacation and the kids are
off from school. If you’re flexible with your schedule, though, a number
of factors can influence your decision, because the Disneyland Resort
has seasons of its very own.
 Busiest times: Disneyland is busiest in summer (between Memorial
Day and Labor Day), but it can also be crowded on holidays
(Thanksgiving week, Christmas week, President’s Day weekend,
Easter week, and Japan’s Golden Week in early May) and weekends
year-round. All other times make up the off-season.
During the busy summertime, Tuesday through Thursday is the
best time to come; Friday and Saturday are the most crowded days.
 Fireworks, shows, and parades: If you want to see all the shows
and parades, you have to visit during the high season, because
scheduling is sporadic on off-season weekdays. Disneyland’s famed
fireworks displays happen mostly in summer with, occasional
exceptions. Christmas also brings its own special magic to
Disneyland, when the park is dressed up for the holidays, complete
with giant decorated trees, wreaths everywhere, and visits with
Santa and the Candlelight Parade, wherein carolers from all over
the Southland lead visitors in a special recital of “The Christmas
Story.” Special celebrity guests have included James Earl Jones and
Dick Van Dyke.
Currently, Fantasmic, a nighttime musical stage show, which incor-
porates fireworks, projected water screens, moving water crafts
and other special effects as it chronicles Mickey Mouse’s battle of
good against evil, takes place over Rivers of America. This mystical
and magical extravaganza is awesome but can be scary for the
more timid tykes.
Also, for the time being, the favorite old-school Electrical Parade
(it used to run along Main Street many, many years ago and was, at
the time, the ultimate spectacular) has returned to California
Adventure after a short stint in Tokyo.

 Summer scorchers: Consider the summer heat when deciding
when to go. Scorching days in July, August, and September can
make waiting to board a ride feel like a death march, with everyone
crowding into available shady spots, and super-long lines to buy
cold drinks. Visiting during these months can be fine; just plan to
take advantage of the indoor attractions during the midday heat.
Your reward later on will be a pleasantly balmy evening, when
being outdoors becomes a delight.
 Crowd-free days: If you want to avoid crowds, visit on a weekday,
preferably in November, December, or January (excluding
Thanksgiving and Christmas weeks). You run the risk that some
rides may be closed for maintenance (never more than three or
four at a time), but visiting during this low, low season is the best
way to maximize a single day. Going for a Sunday/Monday combina-
tion at this time of year almost guarantees that you’ll hit everything
you want while also getting to enjoy the shows and parades.
 First-quarter rains: Southern California gets most of its precipita-
tion between January and April, but only a sustained downpour
should affect your Disney plans. If the forecast predicts rain, bring
both a collapsible umbrella and a waterproof rain poncho (or
splurge on the cute Mickey Mouse ponchos that suddenly appear
when the first raindrop falls). Even if you get wet, you’ll enjoy the
lightest crowds of the year! (The locals know the truth: The very
best time to visit Disneyland is a drizzly, slightly cold winter day
midweek — provided you’re not with kids younger than 4.)
Deciding How Long to Stay
You want to devote at least one (very) full day to the original park. If
you’re planning to visit during one of the peak periods, crowds and wait
times will limit the attractions you’re able to enjoy in a single day, so
plan to spend the night and re-enter Disneyland fresh the following
morning. If California Adventure holds any interest for you, set aside two
days to experience both parks.
Park Hopper passes (see the following section) are a great deal for the
money, and the passes don’t require you to visit on consecutive days 
(if you want to break up your Disney stay with a day at the beach, for
example). If you’re traveling with small children, you want the multiday
option, regardless of the season. Although surviving a marathon Disney
day is a badge of honor for older kids, you know that naptime crankiness
will eventually rear its ugly head with the young ones.
All in all, we suggest allotting two or three full days for the Disney attrac-
tions, which gives you enough time to immerse yourself in the fantasy
before moving on to the next leg of your California visit. (If you’re stay-
ing elsewhere in Southern California but would like two days at the park,
plan on spending the night at the park rather than driving back again the
next day. You’ll be glad you did.)

Getting the Lowdown on Admission
At press time, admission to either Disneyland or California Adventure —
including unlimited rides and all festivities and entertainment — was $59
for adults and kids ages 10 and older and $49 for kids ages 3 to 9 (kids
younger than 3 enter free). Keep in mind, though, that these prices can
go up at any time.
Disney currently offers multiday Park Hopper passes, which allow
unlimited access to both Disneyland and California Adventure. A three-
day pass is $160 for adults and $130 for kids ages 3 to 9. Five-day passes
cost $210 and $180, respectively. (Two- and four-day passes are also
available.) Though the passes must be used within 13 days of the first
day of use, the days spent at the park need not be consecutive, so the
Park Hopper route is the most practical way to go. We go into further
detail in the “Exploring the Resort” section later in this chapter, but
there are good reasons to have access to both parks, provided you don’t
pay full price for California Adventure.
Disney offers regular deals on ticket prices, especially during the slow
winter months (when Park Hopper passes go for less money), so make
sure you check their Web site or call in advance.
Expect to pay a parking charge of between $8 and $10, which may be
included in some admission packages. Always ask whether parking is
part of any package you buy from Disney.
Opening the starting gate
The Disneyland Resort is open every day of the year, but operating
hours vary widely. Call for the information that applies to the time frame
of your visit (% 714-781-4565). You can also find exact open hours, ride
closures, and show schedules online at www.disneyland.com.
Generally speaking, the park is open from 9 or 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. on week-
days, fall to spring; and from 8 or 9 a.m. to midnight or 1 a.m. on week-
ends, holidays, and during summer vacation periods. California Adventure
tends to close two to four hours earlier than Disneyland. If you’d like to
receive a copy of the park’s “Vacation Planner” brochure to orient yourself
before you go, call % 800-225-2024.
Buying in advance can be an enormous time, and sometimes money,
saver. If you plan to arrive during a busy time (either when the gates
open in the morning or between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.), purchasing your
tickets in advance and getting a jump on the crowds at the ticket coun-
ters is your best bet. You can buy your tickets through the Web site, at
Disney stores throughout the United States, or by calling the mail-order
line (% 714-781-4043). Many area hotels also sell tickets at regular cost
(including whatever special deal is being offered at the time).

Discovering the art of the (package) deal
If you intend to spend two or more nights in Disney territory, investigat-
ing the available package options can pay off. Start by contacting your
hotel (even those in Los Angeles or San Diego) to find out whether they
offer Disneyland Resort admission packages. Some of the airline vaca-
tion packagers include admission to Disneyland in their inclusive pack-
ages (see Chapter 6 for more information).
In addition, check with the official Disney agency, Walt Disney Travel
Co. (% 800-225-2024 or 714-520-5060; www.disneyland.com), whose
packages are value-packed time and money savers with lots of built-in
flexibility. As this book went to press, they were offering a free child’s
Park Hopper pass with every paid adult Park Hopper Pass, so you can
see that bargains are to be found there. You can request a glossy catalog
by mail or log onto the Web site and search for “Vacation Packages” to
peruse package details, take a virtual tour of participating hotel proper-
ties, and get online price quotes for customized, date-specific packages.
Hotel choices range from the official Disney hotels to one of 35 neighbor-
ing hotels in every price range. A wide range of available extras includes
admission to other Southern California attractions and guided tours
(such as Universal Studios or a Tijuana shopping trip) and behind-the-
scenes Disneyland tours, all in limitless combinations. Rates are highly
competitive, especially considering that each package includes multiday
admission, early park entry, and free parking (if you choose a Disney
hotel), plus keepsake souvenirs and coupon books. If you want to add
air transportation or car rental, the Walt Disney Travel Co. can make
those arrangements, too.
Getting to the Disneyland Resort
The Disneyland Resort is located in the heart of Anaheim in Orange
County, about 30 miles south of Los Angeles and 98 miles north of San
Diego. To get there from either city, follow I-5 until you see signs for
Disneyland; dedicated off-ramps from both directions lead directly to
the park’s parking lots and surrounding streets.
From the Palm Springs area, follow I-10 westbound to Highway 60 west. In
Riverside, pick up Highway 91 west to Anaheim, and then take Highway
57 south. Exit at the Ball Road off-ramp and turn right (west), proceeding
21⁄2 miles to Disneyland. The drive totals 110 miles.
If you’d rather wing it, Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) is the
region’s major airport, about 30 miles away. You can rent a car at the air-
port and drive to Anaheim, or you can take advantage of the many
public-transportation services at LAX (see Chapter 23 for details).
If you’d rather fly directly into Anaheim from another state or another
California city, the nearest airport is John Wayne International Airport
Chapter 24: The Happiest Place on Earth: The Disneyland Resort! 421

in Santa Ana, 15 miles from Disneyland at the intersection of I-405 and
Highway 55 (% 949-252-5200; www.ocair.com). Most national airlines
and major rental-car agencies serve the airport. To reach Anaheim from
the airport, rent a car and take Highway 55 east, then follow I-5 north to
the Disneyland exit.
An entire family can also catch a ride with Yellow Cab (% 800-535-
2211), whose cabs queue up at the Ground Transportation Center on the
lower level; reservations are not necessary. Expect the fare to Disneyland
to run about $30. If only two of you are making the trip, however, con-
sider using Super Shuttle (% 800-BLUE-VAN; www.supershuttle.com),
which charges $10 per person to the Disneyland area. Advance reserva-
tions are recommended.
Before you pay for a taxi or shuttle service, ask when you make your
reservation whether your Anaheim hotel offers airport transportation.
Deciding Where to Stay
The official Disney hotels are our favorites, both for convenience and
ambience. But lots of reasons exist to stay at one of the many other
hotels and motels that line the surrounding blocks, not the least of
which is that sometimes all 2,200-plus Disney guest rooms are full.
Staying in official Disney digs
Can’t decide whether to stay off-campus or splurge on one of the official
Disney hotels? The main advantages of going 100 percent Disney are
 The Disney monorail: Circumnavigating the theme park, the mono-
rail also stops at each official hotel (and soon at California
Adventure as well). So when you get weary of hoofing it, simply
hop aboard and zip straight to your room. Dedicated ticket booths
and entry turnstiles at the monorail stations mean you can also
avoid the main-entrance crush.
 Just plain fun: The official properties are just plain fun to stay at.
Each gets the patented Disney treatment, with fantasy settings and
imagination-stimulating diversions. Rooms, too, bear the Disney
touch: bathroom amenities, for example, are plastered with Disney
characters — and simply scream “free souvenir”!

Disneyland
The Disneyland Hotel is the original Disney hotel, bless its heart, and for a
while, it was the only Disney hotel. It was once so very, very grand and fun
to stay at, but now that we’ve seen the Grand Californian, it’s hard to go
back. The hotel had a recent, and overdue, renovation, so rooms are fresh
once again. Rooms have a vague Fantasyland theme, with Cinderella’s
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
422

castle on the headboards, glow-in-the-dark Tinkerbells around the tops of
the walls, armoires with sketches of the original Disneyland on them, and
Mickey hands supporting the bathroom sconces. Although whimsical, the
hotel is just a bit more grown-up than a hotel that ought to be geared for
kids should be. (They have weekday newspaper delivery, for pity’s sake.
Good for adults, but where’s the kiddie love? A video arcade isn’t enough.)
But that’s okay: There is still a Peter Pan–themed pool area, complete with
water slide and pirate ship, as well as Goofy’s Kitchen, an “all-you-care-to-
eat” buffet hosted by all the traditional Disney characters (many experi-
enced Disney-goers say this is the best place for the up-close-and-personal
experience). Note that rooms in the Bonita tower are the largest and 
quietest.

Disney’s Grand Californian
$$$$–$$$$$
Disneyland
It’s a thing of lavish and loving beauty, a drop-dead gorgeous hotel that
has been painstakingly researched and designed. The curmudgeonly might
snark that it has the potential to give one an Arts and Crafts–overload
headache. To heck with them. Styled to evoke Yosemite’s landmark
Ahwahnee Hotel (it’s the Mock-wahnee, if you will), it has incredible period
detail, from the cavernous, multistoried lobby with the giant roaring fire-
place right down to the door fixtures and even the trash cans in each
room. Several times a day, a storyteller thrills kids with campfire tales
geared toward California; it’s a charming free service parents must take
advantage of. The rooms are Arts and Crafts smashes, with pocket doors,
nature themes (branches and leaves), lush amenities, and even a lack of
maid carts in the hallways (baskets deliver the fresh linens in the morn-
ing). Suites are even better, but all rooms have robes, cribs, irons and
boards, dual vanities, and coffee pots. The beds are comfy and firm,
although the towels could be a bit softer and the bathrooms a bit bigger,
to tell the truth. Aren’t we ungrateful? We just love this place to pieces —
Disney should be justly proud of themselves. Even the locals tend to ven-
ture here for a night or two. Come take a look at it even if you don’t stay
over, and feel free to use its very own entrance into California Adventure.

This hotel, the second of the Disneyland hotels — and the smallest of the
three (500 rooms) — has the lowest profile. Basically, the only reason to
stay here is, well, because the other Disney hotels are full. There’s nothing
wrong with it; it even has a theme, finally, if you can call something as

vague as “ocean fun” a theme. Recently renovated rooms (which seem
larger than some at the Grand Californian) have a sort of beachy vibe with
nautical fittings, bleached wood, striped fabrics, and a disturbing bubble-
print carpet. The lobby has a (deliberate) ocean smell, and a kiddie TV
room is decorated to evoke the beach with beige carpet, beach chairs, and
a TV monitor (that runs nonstop cartoons) encased in a giant painting of
a sandcastle. The third-floor pool is rooftop, which can be kind of cool, but
it pales to its sibling hotels, although there is a water slide.

Bunking beyond the resort
You can usually find more economical rooms at the many hotels lining
the streets surrounding the park than at those within the park. Naturally,
they’re not as lavish and entertaining as the Disney hotels; but if saving
money is your prime concern, the off-campus hotels offer such advan-
tages as free shuttles, free parking, and free breakfast. Depending on the
season and on availability, the rack rates can be deeply discounted. Be
sure to check online and/or by telephone to get the best deal possible.
Disney has an arrangement with a number of hotels in the area called
the “Good Neighbor Package.” You can purchase Disneyland tickets from
the participating hotel at the regular price, thus saving a wait in a poten-
tially very long line at the parks. If Disney is offering any special ticket
discounts at that time, the hotels offer the same discount.
Some hotels offer free shuttles to the park, while others are on the
Anaheim Resort Transit line (% 888-364-ARTS; www.atnetwork.org/
art_routes.html), a shuttle service that picks up at clearly marked
stops near or at hotels and goes to Disneyland, returning regularly from
the Disneyland main shuttle drop-off area. The shuttles run every 20
minutes along Ball Road, Katella Avenue, and Harbor Boulevard. Rates
are $3 for unlimited rides all day, $1 for children 3 to 9 (kids younger
than 3 ride free). Tickets are available at hotels along the routes and at
the shuttle drop-off in Disneyland.

Don’t be put off by the initial appearance; from the outside, this hotel com-
plex looks like an unappealing strip mall. But there’s a lot going on among
its 9 acres, which provide plenty of lawn space for playing, not to mention
an Olympic-sized swimming pool. Inside, a surprisingly large marble lobby
has a small business center, a bar, and a Mexican-themed grill where kids
younger than 9 eat free, plus a pool table which children can use. Making
it even more family-friendly is a laundry room — with glass doors and win-
dows so families can keep an eye on each other. The ample rooms are in
two-story garden-style bungalows, which make the place feel more like

Camelot Inn & Suites

Anaheim
Of all the many hotels on Harbor Boulevard, this is the only one with any
kind of interesting architecture, sort of old-world Tudor (okay, prefab, but
still) rather than typical concrete block. All rooms are being upgraded, and
the new color scheme should make them look lighter and fresher. The
rooms are adequately sized and come complete with microwaves and a
small fridge, which makes this a fine choice for families looking to save
some money on dining. A terrace-level pool and Jacuzzi are on the fourth
floor, more or less facing Disneyland. It’s an extremely friendly place
(winner of the 2002 President’s Award for commitment to customer serv-
ice), with a fireplace going in the lobby and a decent continental breakfast.
And it’s right at the corner of Disney Way, so you can’t beat the location.
Millie’s, the coffee shop next door (good home cooking; see the review in
the following section), offers 24-hour room service.

This is more or less the heir to those fairy-tale-themed motor courts that
sprung up outside the Disneyland gates after the park opened in 1955.
There is something to be said for staying in a place that tries to look like
an old cartoon village (complete with cobblestones, balconies, flowers,
and vines), and certainly it’s a sweet, fun, and family-friendly place. Recent
upgrades include new carpeting and tile in the rooms, grind-and-brew cof-
feemakers, and a complimentary in-room breakfast (as opposed to nearby
competitors who have continental breakfasts in the lobby); a small work-
out room and Internet access were recently added. Two premium rooms
offer a queen-size bed instead of doubles elsewhere in the establishment.
With a little pool (and a kiddie wading pool), it feels more like a retreat
than one would expect smack dab on a major boulevard. Because it’s inde-
pendent, you have to pay a bit more than you would for a room at its chain-
hotel neighbors.

Holiday Inn Anaheim at the Park
$$
Anaheim
The most upscale non-Disney hotel on our list is a couple of minutes from
the park, but it does offer a shuttle. Rooms are large, with a separate living
area, and although the hotel is generic, the furniture offers better-quality
wood (not veneer pasteboard, let’s say). Bathrooms are also bigger than
those found in the more moderately priced hotels listed. Basically, you’re
paying for more space and somewhat better amenities. This is more a
hotel for grown-ups visiting the park who want only a certain amount of
childhood fun — a resort hotel but without the theme or any kind of
Disney stamp. Special deals (senior discounts, lower rates during slow
times) pop up all the time, so ask. Dataports and cable are free here,
whereas at other places, they’re nonexistent or cost extra. A limited spa
offers workouts, massages, and the like; the workout room is open 24
hours. KidSuites feature bunk beds and a queen bed, and kids younger
than 12 eat for free in the cafe as long as their accompanying adult has
paid for their own meal.

Comfortable, reliable, unsurprising except that it’s a bit nicer than you

a regular cable-car-looking trolley that shuttles guests to and from the
park. The recently renovated rooms are spacious, light, and airy. Each has
a small fridge. Two garden pools (one especially for kids) top it off. They
have room service with Mimi’s Café (open 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.), a French/New
Orleans family-style restaurant offering American cuisine. There’s also a

Dining Out
You’ll go broke before you go hungry at the Disneyland Resort. You can
find food everywhere: a dozen sit-down restaurants and cafeterias inside
the park, and seven more full-service restaurants between the Disneyland
and Paradise Pier hotels (with two more in the works at the Grand
Californian Hotel). And that doesn’t count snack carts, casual walk-up
stands, and packaged-food shops. As you would expect, you can also
find a number of good restaurants conveniently located outside the park
and near your hotel.
Dining at the resort
Most dining facilities inside Disneyland are overrated, overcrowded, and
overpriced, redeeming themselves only by convenience. The exceptions
are the offerings at California Adventure, described in the following sec-
tion, and the dining/entertainment complex known as Downtown Disney,
described in the “Downtown Disney” section. All park restaurants accept
American Express, Discover, MasterCard, and Visa. Your options aren’t as
bad as the day when Twinkies and space punch (and not much else) were
served in Tomorrowland, but hamburgers and carbs still rule the day, and
although it all works as fuel, it hardly works as haute cuisine (and don’t
get us started on those fake beignets offered in New Orleans Square). On
the other hand, it tickles us that those giant dill pickles are still inexplica-
bly offered as snacks at stands in Adventureland and in the Bountiful
Valley Farm section of California Adventure. Here are some exceptions
worth seeking out:
 Disney has made an effort to accommodate guests who want to eat
more healthily. Several fresh-fruit-and-vegetable carts (albeit not
cheap) are scattered throughout Disneyland (we spotted them on
Main Street and in Adventureland and Critter Country), offering
melon, pineapple, grapes, and assorted raw veggies and dip, along
with kosher pickles, bottled water, and that healthy beverage,
Coca-Cola. For other healthy snack options, head to Adventureland
for refreshments at the Tiki Juice Bar and Indy Fruit Cart, which
offer tropical juices and unembellished fresh fruit for a natural
sugar boost and healthier options.
 If you’re a low-carb eater, you’ll appreciate the Bengal Barbeque 
with a choice of fish, chicken, beef, or veggie kabobs served with
(salty/sugary) sauces. Hardcore anti-carbists can forgo the basting
or order the bacon-wrapped asparagus: quick, cheap (by Disneyland
standards) protein pick-me-ups. Giant turkey legs a la carte (so
Henry VIII, isn’t it?) can also be found at a couple of carts — usually
one on Main Street near Sleeping Beauty’s Castle and one between
the Matterhorn and Small World.
Chapter 24: The Happiest Place on Earth: The Disneyland Resort! 427

 Located throughout Disneyland — and (thank goodness!) plotted
on the official park map — are churro carts, which dispense these
absolutely addictive cylindrical Mexican donuts (rolled in sugar)
beginning at 11 a.m.
 The food itself may be unremarkable (or even pretty bad, although
there are great fans of the authentic Monte Cristo sandwich), but
the Blue Bayou Restaurant, the only restaurant in the park that
requires reservations (stop by early in the day to make yours), is
worth a look. It meticulously re-creates a classic New Orleans
verandah, complete with lush, vine-wrapped ironwork, lazily chirp-
ing crickets, and (nonalcoholic) mint juleps. Its misty, sunless
atmosphere comes from being literally inside the Pirates of the
Caribbean ride, so boatloads of pirate-seeking parkgoers drift by
during your meal.
 The Royal Street Veranda in New Orleans Square offers those same
faux-beignets, but also some decent (if hardly authentic) gumbo in
a sourdough bowl.
Breakfast places fill up as soon as the park opens. Because these are
expensive and uninspired, we say skip it; have some cereal before you
arrive and get right to the rides. In fact, try to avoid prime eating hours
as much as you can, because everyone else will be noshing at that time
as well.
California Adventure
Do the bulk of your eating, if possible, at California Adventure, where the
options are better in terms of quality and crowds. If you have the Park
Hopper pass, head on over to California Adventure, especially if you’re an
adult who doesn’t want hot dogs. Even the fast food seems a bit more
inventive and interesting over there. Among the highlights is Golden Vine
Winery, which offers two dining options: a more casual trattoria down-
stairs, and a formal dining room upstairs that offers prix-fixe tasting
menus. Both are surprising entries in an amusement park (actual mature
dining options), and both serve excellent, grown-up food. Patronize them,
please, so there’s a chance that more such ventures will open in the
future. Pacific Wharf Café is modeled after restaurants found in San
Francisco — tourist traps, of course, but at Disneyland, what the heck? It
sits on the edge of the mock harbor (full of hungry ducks), and you can
get real sourdough bread and clam chowder, maybe in a sourdough bowl
(made on park premises; after, you can go over to the Boudin Bakery and
watch loaves bake). Cocina Mexican Grill offers decent Mexican food
made with fresh tortillas on the premises. A visit to the tortilla press is riv-
eting fun for small children. The prix-fixe menu and need for reservations
may keep you from wanting to commit to Ariel’s Grotto, but if any mem-
bers of your party are princess-obsessed, this is the place to take them,
because everyone from — you guessed it — Ariel to Alice mills around
this wharf-top venue ready to sign autographs and pose for pics.

428

Downtown Disney
The big dining/entertaining/shopping complex known as Downtown
Disney is another part of the Disneyland Resort, but it has no entrance
fee and no gate, so it’s considered to be “outside the park.” If you want
to leave the resort to visit Downtown Disney, you can have your hand
stamped for re-admittance to the parks. You really can’t go wrong dining
at one of the restaurants in Downtown Disney, unless, of course, you’re
on a strict budget. In that case, you may want to resort to fast food or
chain restaurants.
In addition to the restaurants listed in this section, you can try the
theme restaurants (ESPN Zone, House of Blues, Rainforest Café). All
the restaurants have outdoor balcony or patio seating facing the
Downtown Disney traffic, so the people-watching potential is very high.

MEDITERRANEAN RIM
One of three Pinot Group restaurants (the Pinot Group was founded by the
creator of L.A.’s Patina — see Chapter 23) in Downtown Disney, this one
specializes in more coastal Mediterranean dishes, such as bouillabaisse,
cassoulet, braised lamb, lots of rotisserie items, and light pastas. It’s set in
a lovely two-story space, with a Deco facade and a strong wood décor

The original La Brea Bakery is just that — a bakery, in Los Angeles, on 
La Brea. There, Nancy Silverton nearly single-handedly brought about a
revolution of sorts, bringing the concept of artisan bread to the masses. Or
so it became when she turned her bakery into a conglomerate and house-
hold name. The bread here is indeed amazing, as are the pastries and the
grilled sandwiches with ham or turkey and cheese or the (breadless)
salads, which fare far better. There’s also a walk-up window with a full
range of coffee drinks, sandwiches, pastries, and salads, all of which cost
a bit less than the sit-down service.

Important Dining, with a price tag to match, but what a treat. Clearly,
you’re meant to think you’re in the heart of California Wine Country, where
they take dining (to say nothing of wine) very seriously, indeed. Menus
change seasonally, but here are some highlights from a recent list: scal-
lops with a sauce of lemon, lobster, and vanilla; pheasant with merlot-date
essence; truffled risotto cake stuffed with fontina with rock shrimp
Bolognese. Wasted on kids, you say? Perhaps, but note that they have a
children’s menu, with things such as simple buttered noodles, quesadillas,
and pizzas — so Mom and Dad can have gourmet fun and won’t have to
fret about Junior’s finicky eating habits. Oh, and they have 22 sommeliers,
so, naturally, you can guess what that wine list looks like.

Ralph Brennan’s Jazz Kitchen

CREOLE/CAJUN
New Orleans comes to Disney — well, it already did, over at the park in
the New Orleans Square — in the form of a building that looks as though
it was lifted straight off Royal Street in the French Quarter (in fact, 
they copied the iron grillwork on the outside from the Royal Street Café).
The “Brennan” in the name is that of the finest New Orleans restaurant
family — the same ones who bring you Commander’s Palace (perhaps the
best restaurant in that food-mad city). Fittingly, this is the best restaurant
in Downtown Disney. Start with a minisampler of soup, with perfect
gumbo, and then move on to the fried soft-shell crabs, if in season, or the
filet mignon Rockefeller, if not. The latter floats on a sauce of butter and
pernod, with sautéed spinach flecked with bacon, and buttermilk mashed
potatoes piped into oyster shells. If it’s lunchtime, get the couchon de lait
(Cajun roast pork) po’ boy sandwich, or better still, the BBQ shrimp, which
is actually done in a peppery butter sauce and demands to be soaked up
with French bread. The jambalaya, gumbo, and seafood are all heavenly.
All in all, this is our first choice for Downtown Disney dining.

Dining outside the parks
Even with (or perhaps in spite of) all the choices inside the parks, you
can find a decent meal to appeal to the whole family at locations outside
the Disneyland Resort. Here are a few of our favorites.

MEXICAN
Mexican food, family-style and family-friendly — and authentic (well, in
that Southern Californian Mexican way). Located about a half mile from
Disneyland (in a strip mall), it has nothing on the menu over $14, and that’s
for the paella (rice with all kinds of meats and seafood in it). The award-
winning menu (with the occasional charming mistake: “Barbacoa — oven
cooked in a red chile sauce”; doesn’t that sound like the oven itself is
cooked in red chile sauce?) covers the ground from shrimp al mojo de ajo
(in garlic sauce) to taco combo platters to Texas BBQ pork ribs. It’s a local
favorite (always a good sign), with a casual cafe style. Come early because
there will be a line for dinner, or come for breakfast!

CHINESE
With an attractive Chinese décor, this restaurant is slightly more upscale
than you may think from the name. It’s not daring Chinese food — more
like Chinese food for timid tourists — but it’s tasty, well prepared, and gen-
erously portioned.

HOME COOKING
Miss home cooking? Sure you do. We won’t say this is like your mom used
to make (or your grandma, more likely — moms don’t often cook like this
anymore) because we don’t know her, but we hope it is, because it’s that
good. For breakfast, we seriously recommend the “world-famous” cinna-
mon rolls. Omelets are fresh and fluffy and come with fresh biscuits and
buttermilk gravy, the sort we just don’t get often enough here in Southern
California. For dinner, try the pot roast — at $10, you get a huge portion
of falling-apart meat (no knives required!) served over carrots and pota-
toes (both mashed and otherwise) with soup or salad and cornbread. That
one portion may serve an entire family, unless you’re with a lot of
teenagers. Force yourself to eat dessert; they have an Oreo fudge berry
sundae. Skip the nearby Denny’s and IHOP and come here.

service). % 714-535-6892. Reservations not necessary. Main courses: $5–$8 for

Exploring the Resort
You’ve done your homework, you’ve packed the right park-going
clothes, and you’ve got a game plan in order. Now it’s time to hit the
parks. See the “The Disneyland Resort” map on p. 433 to get started.
Plan to get to the gates of either park a few minutes, at least, before
opening. This means, if you’re driving down, get an early start, because
you need to take into account early-morning rush-hour traffic, plus the
drive itself, and the parking, and the getting to the gate from the parking
lot, all before 9 a.m. That alone may be reason enough to stay in the
Anaheim area.
The ticket booths are located precisely between the entrances to
Disneyland and California Adventure (one on the left, the other on the
right). You can expect to go through security and have your bags
searched, which adds still more time to the entering process.
Get off the tram at Downtown Disney and walk away from the park toward
the Disneyland Hotel (or self-park in the Downtown Disneyland lot instead
of the theme-park lots). On your right is the Monorail Station and booth
where you can buy tickets to Disneyland. The Monorail drops you off in
Tomorrowland. By using this entrance to Disneyland, you can beat the
crowds and avoid the long lines — though your bags will still be searched.
If you have limited time, here is a suggested game plan:
 If you have only one day: Get to the park early and start by riding
the most popular rides (described throughout this section) first —
or obtaining FASTPASS tickets early (see the following paragraph) —
so that you don’t waste precious time in line.
 If you have two or more days: You have the luxury of enjoying
some Disney extras not essential enough to pack into a single day.
Avoid the midday-rides crush by strolling along Main Street U.S.A.,
shopping for Disney souvenirs, and ducking into Great Moments
with Mr. Lincoln, the patriotic look at America’s 16th president,
Walt Disney’s first foray into audio-animatronics.
One of the finer innovations in recent Disney history, the automated
FASTPASS system allows visitors to buy advance tickets to certain rides,
permitting them to return in, say, one to two hours (having gone on
some other rides or eating a snack in the meantime), bypass the regular
line, and more or less hop right on. Not all rides have this option, but
the most popular ones in both Disneyland and California Adventure do,
and although it doesn’t eliminate lines entirely — after all, other people
have the same return time as you — it does help you do the park more
efficiently; Disney allows only a limited number of people to be in the
FASTPASS queue at the same time. Get your FASTPASS tickets at the
FASTPASS machines located at or near the entrances to the attractions
where the pass is offered. You will be assigned a one-hour window of

time during which you can board the attraction. Look for the signs
directing you to the FASTPASS queue (not the Standby queue); it can be
a bit confusing, so read the signs carefully or just ask. Note that you’re
allowed to use only one FASTPASS at a time — for example, you have to
use the Haunted Mansion pass before you can get a pass for another
ride. There is absolutely no reason not to take advantage of this option
as often as you can. And by the way, it’s free.
The 2005 50th anniversary of Disneyland brought all kinds of celebra-
tions, from special parades to new attractions (or renovations of old
favorites, such as Space Mountain), and more, some of which have

stayed longer than had initially been scheduled. We don’t know how
long they’ll remain, but perhaps you’ll still get to experience a couple.
Tips from the pros
Avoid common pitfalls by avoiding the mistakes of others:
 Wear your most comfortable walking shoes. You’ll spend many
hours walking, standing, and putting lots of strain on your legs and
feet. Running or tennis shoes are best. Open-toed shoes are fine,
especially on hot days; just make sure they have impact-cushioning
soles and support your feet.
 Expect a dramatic temperature drop after dark, even in summer.
Bring a sweatshirt or jacket, perhaps even long pants; you can
store them in a locker, leave them in the car, or tote them in a back-
pack. Too many visitors have shown up in shorts and tank tops,
only to discover that by 10 p.m. they’re freezing their buns off!
 Don’t forget such bare necessities as sunscreen (the park gets a lot
of direct sun); camera film (more than you think you’ll want; film
costs more in the park) and spare batteries; extra baby supplies;
bottled water or a sports bottle you can refill at drinking fountains;
and snacks (if the kids get hungry in line, or you just balk at the con-
cession prices). Although anything you may forget is available for
purchase inside Disneyland, you’ll cringe at the marked-up prices.
 Purchase tickets in advance (over the Internet or phone, or through
your hotel). Not only do Disney Resort hotels sell tickets, but so do
many area hotels, through an arrangement with Disney, as a service
to their guests. This saves you from standing in what can be slow
and long ticket lines. Visit the Web site at www.disneyland.com.
 Make sure your child is ready to play. It is certainly not a given
that all children love, or will love, Disneyland. Some rides may
simply be too intense (fast, dark, subtle) for certain ages or person-
alities. We strongly urge you to seriously consider your own child’s
tolerance level and individual tastes, phobias, and neuroses before
bringing him to this fabulous, but pricey, destination.
 Ask about ride restrictions before you come. Some rides have age
and height restrictions; check in advance so that your kids aren’t
crestfallen to find that they can’t ride a particular ride when they
get to the park. For most attractions, you have to be 7 years or
older to ride alone, for example. On the bright side, Bjorn-restricted
bundles of joy are welcome on most of the rides. For the more
active, high-speed rides, such as Space Mountain, Splash Mountain,
and Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, kids are required to be at least
40 inches high and 3 years old. Ask Disney employees about a
Switch Pass if one or more of your kids aren’t tall enough for the
adventure that you want to go on. (This pass allows one or two
group members to watch a child who cannot ride an attraction
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
434

Chapter 24: The Happiest Place on Earth: The Disneyland Resort! 435
while the rest of the group waits in line and rides the ride. Once the
majority of the group is done the one or two group members who
watched the child can take the Child Switch Pass and walk up the
exit to get on the attraction without any wait!)
Disneyland
As the clock strikes 9 a.m., the gates open, and the crowd floods in. 
You start on Main Street, the famous replica of an ideal American small
town — Mark Twain’s mid–19th century with a little Beaver Cleaver
thrown in. (Actually, all buildings in the park are two-thirds size, the
better to make kids feel at ease, and adults sentimental.) We urge you,
even if you’ve never been here before, not to linger — everyone else is
bolting to their favorite rides, and every minute you dally, the lines are
getting longer.
Main Street feeds into the central area of Disneyland, from which several
main “lands” branch off, like the fingers on a hand: Fantasyland,
Tomorrowland, Frontierland, Adventureland, New Orleans Square,
Critter Country, and Mickey’s Toontown. Where you go at this point
depends on your preferences. We detail each area in this section, high-
lighting the most popular rides, to help you decide which you should
target first. From experience, however, we can say that among the most
perennially popular rides, park-wide, are the Pirates of the Caribbean,
Haunted Mansion, Indiana Jones, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear,
and Roger Rabbit.
Although many visitors tackle Disneyland systematically, beginning at
the entrance and working their way clockwise around the park, the most
effective method historically has been to arrive early and run to the
most popular rides first, where midday lines can last an hour or more.
Adventures with kids
If you have small kids with you, concentrate on Fantasyland (behind
Sleeping Beauty’s Castle), a kids’ paradise with fairy-tale-derived rides
such as King Arthur Carousel, Dumbo the Flying Elephant, Mr. Toad’s
Wild Ride, Peter Pan’s Flight (be prepared; though this is a pretty neat
ride, for some inexplicable reason, this seems to be one of the slowest
queues in the park), Alice in Wonderland, Pinocchio’s Daring Journey,
and the Disney signature ride, It’s A Small World.
Elsewhere in the park, little ones will enjoy clambering through Tarzan’s
Treehouse, experiencing the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and
Friends, and doing space wheelies on Astro Orbitor, which is tamer
than the name implies (not worth a long wait for grown-ups). Mickey’s
Toontown is a wacky, gag-filled world inspired by the Roger Rabbit films,
featuring endless amusement for young imaginations. The interactive
Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters gives kids and grown-ups the opportunity
to best each other’s scores as they blast targets with ray guns.

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
436
Adventures for thrill-seekers
If high-speed thrills are your style, follow the Indiana Jones Adventure
into the Temple of the Forbidden Eye, with hair-raising perils that
include the familiar cinematic tumbling boulder — very realistic in the
front seats!
Most of Disneyland’s best action roller coasters are “mountain” themed.
Perennial favorite Space Mountain is a pitch-black indoor roller coaster
that assaults your ears and equilibrium. Splash Mountain is a water
flume with a big, wet splash at the end (be prepared!). The Matterhorn
Bobsleds offer a zippy coaster ride through faux-alpine caverns and fog
banks, while runaway train cars careen through a deserted 1870s gold
mine on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.
Diverging from the mountain theme, stationary Star Tours encounters a
space-load of misadventures on the way to the Moon of Endor. This Star
Wars–inspired Tomorrowland virtual ride manages to achieve real
queasiness with motion seats and video effects.
Longtime faves
Some of Disneyland’s highlights are long-time favorites that have stood
the test of time. Two all-time best bets are in New Orleans Square: The
intriguingly spooky Haunted Mansion showcases the brilliance of
Disney Imagineers and boggles your mind with too many details to
absorb in just one visit. Keeping even regular Disney attendees on their
toes is the fact that the ride changes depending on time of year. From
somewhere around the first week or two of October until perhaps mid-
January the Mansion undergoes a nifty transformation that incorporates
Tim Burton’s Nightmare Before Christmas. We love it both ways!
Look ma — no lines!
That’s what you think. Nearly every Disney ride is fiendishly designed to look as if
there’s no line in front of it — either by having the line snake in such a way that its true
length is obscured, or by having most of it hidden inside the ride structure itself. You
walk up and think, “Hey, there’s no line — let’s try this ride!” only to get inside and find
out that quite a few people and a lengthy wait are ahead of you. It’s a clever psycho-
logical trick we fall for each and every time. The upside is that many of the newer rides
have some kind of visual device, little sights, details, or other amusements (talking
cars before Autopia, say, or a “set” that makes you think you’re “backstage” at Roger
Rabbit) that can help while away the time. It’s a good idea to bring a book or a maga-
zine, though, and if you have kids in tow, make sure they have a book or comic to keep
themselves occupied during the wait.

Chapter 24: The Happiest Place on Earth: The Disneyland Resort! 437
The recently renovated Pirates of the Caribbean presents an enchanted
world of swashbuckling and rum-running as you glide through via a real-
istic southern bayou. Coming full circle, the ride that inspired the movie
now incorporates its spawn, so expect to see a few animatronic Captain
Jack Sparrows along the way as well as an awfully cool misty waterfall
effect. Though some Disney purists were up in arms about the new
changes, we feel that they’re innocuous enough to not interfere with the
original intent and long-time charm of the ride.
Parade and show-going tips
The park’s parades and shows draw huge crowds into relatively small
areas. Parades usually run twice a day, in the afternoon and mid-evening.
If a parade doesn’t interest you, make a point to steer clear of these
areas during and immediately after the parade; use this time to take
advantage of shorter ride lines in Frontierland (Big Thunder Mountain
Railroad), Tomorrowland (Space Mountain), and New Orleans Square
(Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean).
California Adventure
Ah, this is the “new” park, which opened to great fanfare in 2001. 
The first major new development at Disneyland since, hmm, maybe
Toontown — except this is so much bigger. Toontown was just a new
land; this is a whole new park.
After going on — and on and on and on — about the general overall per-
fection of Disney, we now have to say that California Adventure may
have been a major misstep. And unless you get one of those multiday
Park Hopper passes, you can safely save your money and skip the new
park altogether. (Although there are constant efforts to add newer and
better attractions to California Adventure to make it a more worthy rela-
tive of the original Disneyland.)
Don’t get us wrong; the park is gorgeous. Disney design would produce no
less. Every detail, as always, is extensively researched and exquisite —
heck, we can think of few sights that are as visually appealing as Paradise
Pier at dusk. But did you notice the name? Do you know what the theme
is? That’s right: California. It’s a miniversion of California in (need we point
out?) California. It boasts a mock version of Yosemite, a highly stylized
version of San Francisco, and a wishful-thinking version of Hollywood
Boulevard. We cannot stress how weird and wrong this idea is, but we can
illustrate it by observing that you, the visitor, may well go from the real
Hollywood Boulevard, to the cartoon version here in the same day. And
though this may be terrific for prompting discussions of the Platonic ideal
and archetypes, it just doesn’t sit well as an amusement park, at least one
that is based in, we’ll just mention it again, California.
But never mind that. A more egregious sin (one that could easily be a by-
product of the overall failure to meld design and place) is that the entire
park lacks the same magic of Disneyland — which is, after all, based on

mythologies or faraway lands and times, rather than a re-creation of
something that lies right outside the gates. Consequently, it’s artificial 
in a Vegas way, not a Disney dazzle way. Plus, it’s a much more generic
amusement park; there aren’t many rides for the space, and those that
are here often disappoint or are completely ordinary, lacking the special
Disney touch. Also, the park seems less efficiently laid out; after a
couple of waits in line and a walk from one section to another, you’ve
used up a couple of hours with little to show for it.
Which is not to say that there isn’t plenty to enjoy (and increasingly
more as they work on it), but California Adventure is much more a stroll-
around-and-admire park than an amusement park, much better for
adults weary of lines or rides in general. And if the place didn’t cost a
whole separate expensive admission, we would probably think more
kindly of it than we do. Which is where that Park Hopper pass comes in;
it pays for itself in just a couple days of Disneyland admission alone.
With it, families can readily take advantage of the admittedly better food
options here and the smaller crowds.
California Adventure for kids
Grizzly River Run is a thoroughly enjoyable water ride; expect to get
either somewhat damp or soaked through. The Redwood Creek
Challenge Trail, given a new slightly New Age/spiritual theme to tie in
with the animated flick Brother Bear, is part of a kids’ playground area,
allowing them to run around, climb on ropes or on rock-climbing walls,
and just generally get their ya-yas out in an area designed to look like
Yosemite (“oh, it’s faux-semite,” observed one attendee). Also featured is
the Soarin’ Over California ride; riders pile into rows of seats that are
then lifted up so that they may sway and tilt, hang-glider style, while
watching an IMAX-type film. It’s one of the better rides, although prone
to long lines and a tad disappointing if you thought you were going to do
more of an actual hang-gliding-type activity.
Paradise Pier is essentially Disney’s version of a traditional amusement
park. It’s Carnie Central, with the sort of rides that fly around on chains
or whiz into the air and generally make you sick to your stomach. Except
for the super-fun roller coaster California Screamin’, it’s nothing you
haven’t ridden before and, as such, hardly a must-do. Then again, how
lovely that in this manic, high-tech, short-attention-span world, there are
still kids who get a thrill riding a merry-go-round or Ferris wheel that
alternates stationary and swinging buckets.
Addressing the many concerns about the lack of old-fashioned Disney
magic, the newish A Bug’s Land caters mostly to the smaller set (note
how everything is scaled to make each visitor feel bug-sized; good per-
spective for adults), but it’s so darn sweet, and more to the point, so
Disney-clever (which is very clever indeed) that all but the most jaded
teens will get a kick out of it. Ride Heimlich’s Chew-Chew Train, as the
Teutonic caterpillar from A Bug’s Life chomps his way through various
foliage (smell the watermelon as he plows through it), and enjoy other
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
438

insect-themed activities. If the line isn’t too long, the brand-new Monsters,
Inc. Mike & Sulley to the Rescue ride will be thoroughly enjoyed by the
young’uns, though not so interesting to anyone else.
California Adventure for adults
For adults, there is honest-to-gosh wine tasting at the Golden Vine
Winery, where you can learn about wine-making (right out of Napa
Valley) and even taste the juice of the grape. There is also a replica of
the rotunda of San Francisco’s Palace of Fine Arts (like Cinderella’s
Castle, it makes a great meeting spot), and a copy of the Pacific Wharf,
where you can watch bread being made or, better still, a tortilla-making
machine in action (and you get a free tortilla, fresh off the machine, just
for coming in).
California Adventure for superstar wannabes
The Hollywood Pictures Backlot is possibly the most dubious portion
of the park. We’ve already mentioned how very odd it is to see this
highly stylized, cartoon version of Hollywood Boulevard (which, as we
mention in Chapter 23, has no real association with the motion-picture
industry). The Tower of Terror is part of a (so-far successful) effort to
rehabilitate California Adventure’s image — in other words, here’s
another clever ride (the best in this park), in this case, a trip through a
crumbling hotel-like structure, complete with a movie about the hotel’s
murky and horrible past. And then, well, hang on tight when you get into
that elevator — it’s a hard, fast drop down. Otherwise, this side still
doesn’t have much to do, although the Muppet 3D Adventure is sweetly
enjoyable and Turtle Talk with Crush invites interactive chat with the
animated turtle from Finding Nemo — how do they do that, anyway?

San Juan Capistrano and

In This Chapter
 Seeing the sights at San Juan Capistrano
 Enjoying the sun, sand, and special events at Laguna Beach
T
wo favorite getaway destinations for Los Angelenos are San Juan
Capistrano and Laguna Beach, both close to the city in distance but
far away in feel. San Juan Capistrano is located 15 minutes southwest of
Laguna Beach, so you can hit both in the course of a short trip. We sug-
gest that you visit the historic sights of San Juan Capistrano during the
day, have lunch at one of the restaurants described in this chapter, and
stay in one of Laguna’s fine lodgings at night. You can spend a most
enjoyable few hours getting to know the area.
San Juan Capistrano
It’s easy to understand why San Juan Capistrano’s famed swallows
return to the town’s 10-acre mission every March 19, but the real ques-
tion is why would they ever want to leave in the first place? Although
spectacular unto itself, this “Jewel of the Missions,” as it has become
known, with its botanical courtyards and narrative displays, was
founded November 1, 1776, and is only a tiny portion of what makes San
Juan Capistrano special.
Getting there by car
San Juan Capistrano marks the halfway point between Los Angeles and
San Diego, about 70 minutes from the heart of each city. Exit I-5 at
Camino Capistrano and head due west about 3 blocks to break up the
monotony of the San Diego to Los Angeles (or vice versa) drive.

What to see and do
This diverse community offers glimpses into the past, present, and
future, with architecture ranging from the 18th-century Montanez
Adobe (31781 Los Rios St.) to renowned architect Michael Graves’s post-
modern Regional Library (31495 El Camino Real).
The Mission San Juan Capistrano (Ortega Highway/California 74; % 949-
234-1300; www.missionsjc.com; admission: $6 adults, $5 seniors, $4
children 3–12, free for children younger than 3; open: daily 8:30 a.m.–
5 p.m.) is the seventh of the 21 California coastal missions. Centuries-old
adobe walls shelter gardens and fountains. The ruins of the Great Stone
Church (begun in 1796, completed in 1806, collapsed by an earthquake
in 1812), with its 125-foot native-stone bell tower, are undergoing preser-
vation to stem the structure’s decay. The mission is best known for its
swallows, which, according to legend, return to nest here each year on
March 19, St. Joseph’s Day. Legend aside, swallows can be seen here
year-round.
Adjacent to the Mission, off of Verdugo and just across the railroad
tracks, is Los Rios Street, the oldest remaining residential street in all of
California. If you brought the young’uns with you for your San Juan Cap
adventure, reward their good behavior with a trip to the quaint Zoomars
Petting Zoo and Bird Park, 31791 Los Rios St. (% 949-831-6550).
Zoomars is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., rain or shine. The admis-
sion price of $2 will give your child access to over 100 friendly animals
(ranging from guinea pigs and bunnies to emus and llamas) to pet.
Adults 13 and older pay $3 and there are pony rides, train rides, and
snacks (for humans as well as the animals) available at an additional
charge. Not the most exciting stop, but kids love it and the place always
provides that perfect photo-op.
Nestled between a couple of distinctive gift stores lies the Ramos House
Cafe, 31752 Los Rios St. (% 949-443-1342; open Tues–Sun 8:30 a.m.–
3 p.m.; weekends have a prix-fixe brunch), undoubtedly one of the yum-
miest breakfast and lunch spots in Southern California. The owner lives
in the 1881 house with a converted commercial kitchen and treats his
guests to contemporary American cuisine (with Southern influence)
underneath the mulberry tree on the rustic open patio.
One former U.S. president (the reliable rumor is it was Richard Nixon) so
loved the local flavor served up in the Mexican kitchen of the National
Historical Landmark El Adobe, 31891 Camino Capistrano (% 949-493-
1163; open: daily 11 a.m.–9 p.m.), they actually named the President’s
Choice combination dinner after his favorite trio of dishes. If you simply
don’t have time for a leisurely meal, Pedro’s Tacos, 31721 Camino
Capistrano (% 949-489-7752; open: daily 10 a.m.–8 p.m.), across the
street from the mission, serves delicious, authentic, not to mention won-
derfully inexpensive, Mexican fare.

Sushi fans, jump back on the I-5 North, exit a few miles up at Crown
Valley where you’ll make a right, and then an immediate left into a peach
and green stucco center called the Kaleidoscope. Riptide, 27741 Crown
Valley Pkwy. (% 949-282-0182; www.rockinrestaurants.com), with its
“Rockin” theme — kinda like Benihana on steroids and sugar — seems
like it would be all image, but the substance is surprisingly outstanding.
Fresh sushi, including a host of exotic rolls, stellar teppan performances,
a well-rounded dinner menu, and a gluttonous Polynesian Sunday brunch
make this destination a bright light in suburbia. Reservations are a must
on the weekend.
Laguna Beach
In spite of all of the attention it has received courtesy of Kristin, LC,
and the rest of the cast of MTV’s Orange County–based reality series,
Laguna Beach has long been a quiet and romantic getaway for Southern
Californians, and for many a good reason. Number one, with its clean
beaches, beautiful homes, and terrific landscape, the place is simply 
gorgeous. Number two, though it’s pretty much a sleepy little town, the
artists’ community here ensures that you’re never at a loss for things to
do. And finally, it’s just a short road trip from most Southern California
metropolises.
When to go
The height of tourist season is between Memorial Day and Labor Day,
because everyone yearns to engage in Laguna’s magnificent summer
events as well as frolic on the sand in the warm sun. Room rates go up
(not tremendously, but enough to notice if your stay is longer than a
night or two), and the village becomes a wee bit more congested than in
the winter. Keep in mind, however, that Southern California usually gets
hit with what we call June gloom — overcast mornings that tend to burn
off by mid- to late afternoon. Does this detract from the town’s beauty?
Heck no! And if you’re a tanning fiend, you can still get good color
because UV rays are intensified through the clouds. On the other hand,
although California’s mild winter may not be necessarily conducive to
bathing trunks and bikinis, it can be inviting to beachcombers who enjoy
taking long walks in cool, fresh air.
Getting there by car
Laguna Beach is about a 20-minute drive from John Wayne Airport in
Orange County. Simply exit the airport (take the soft left) and merge
(right) onto the 405 (San Diego) freeway south. Continue down the 405.
Veer onto the 133 south toward Laguna Beach. This highway becomes
Laguna Canyon, which then becomes Broadway and takes you directly
to Coast Highway.
If you’re driving from Los Angeles, the directions remain the same,
except you’ll spend about 40 minutes longer on the 405 south.
Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
442

Coming from San Diego, take I-5 north until you reach the CA-1 exit
toward Beach Cities. This exit takes you under the freeway and onto
Coast Highway (CA-1). Continue north on CA-1 through Dana Point. After
a scenic 15-minute drive, you’ll be in South Laguna Beach.
Getting around
As is true in much of California, relying solely on your feet may not be in
your best interest. If you’re staying in the village, you’ll be fine, but if you
like to explore, you’ll want to have a car. Be forewarned: Although most
hotels are kind enough to provide complimentary parking, if you park at
a meter, be sure to pay attention to the signs and feed the meters as
posted, usually a quarter for ten minutes.
Where to stay
Seclusion is the name of the game for lodging in the Laguna Beach area,
and these accommodations offer plenty of it.

$$$–$$$$$
Dana Point
If you’re in the mood for a more secluded territory than Laguna Beach, you

exquisite attention to detail for which this place is known. Even if you can’t
afford to sleep here (and quite frankly, who can?), you’ll want to peek in or
even try the resort’s award-winning restaurants — Studio, the Loft (can you
say French Laundry’s chef from Napa?), and Mosaic Bar & Grill — but only

Where to dine
Laguna Beach does a pretty good restaurant business, given its proxim-
ity to the southernmost regions of the Los Angeles area, and you can
find quite a variety. The following are our local favorites.
Cedar Creek Inn
$–$$$
Laguna Beach
AMERICAN
For nearly 20 years this warm and inviting restaurant, situated in a historic
building in the Lumberyard Mall, has been serving Laguna residents lunch,
dinner, and Sunday brunch. One of the many likeable points about this
place is that you have the freedom to make it as casual or as formal as you
like depending upon with whom and how you dine. The wonderfully potent
Jalapeño-Jack Pasta can be enjoyed at the same table as the market-price
swordfish, or the Monte Cristo sandwich either indoors or on the tree-
covered brick patio. We have yet to try anything here that hasn’t made our
tummies happy. The bar side includes an award-winning grill menu, as well
as live music Wednesday through Sunday evenings with late-night and light
dining daily until 11 p.m.

Dizz’s As Is

South Laguna Beach
INTERNATIONAL
Located a few miles south of the village, this local favorite since 1977
serves up an eclectic mix of mouth-watering international cuisine with
French-Belgian flair. Upon being seated at one of the cozy tables, you and
your party will be given a stack of pages describing the special entrees of
the evening. The generous portions will leave you wondering how you can
possibly fit in a bite of one of the delectable desserts, but to leave without
trying the chocolate crème brûlée is just not right.

Kick back, get yourself a rum-infused libation, and enjoy an evening in a
friendly, festive, and fun island atmosphere. Savory aubergine choka (a
Trinidadian grilled-vegetable dish); spicy Cajun prawns sweetened by a
pineapple, mango, pepper, and passion-fruit salsa; or any of the other
appetizing treats segue deliciously into the authentic Caribbean entrees.

est Mexican tasties in Laguna (with two locations). Whether you try a
carne asada burrito, an avocado-lime salad with chicken, or any one of
their vegetarian specialties, your taste buds will dance with glee. Perfect

CALIFORNIA CUISINE
A restaurant in such a prime locale with such a beautiful view doesn’t have
to be this good — but lucky for us, it is. On the lower level of the Surf &
Sand Resort & Spa, practically on top of the ocean, this ridiculously roman-
tic nook is devoted to the art of fine cuisine. Their filet is so tender you
question why they even bothered bringing you the steak knife when, truly,

ITALIAN
This is South Laguna Beach’s quintessential restaurant of romance.
Modeled after an Italian villa, it offers a cozy, charming atmosphere with
a fireplace and ocean views. The extensive wine list and divine Italian-
Mediterranean menu embrace Ti Amo’s philosophy that the marriage of
food and wine is the key to good health and living. Who are we to argue
with that kind of logic? And the Chocolate Sin dessert is even more won-
derfully wicked than it sounds.

Although it’s far from shocking that the artsy community’s vegetarians
would flock to Zinc for breakfast and lunch as often as possible, the tasty,
surprisingly healthy food is what inspires the carnivores to visit just as
often. Beachgoers, get food to go from the counter or their market.

Laguna events
Laguna residents love to take advantage of their weather-type amenities
and celebrate their festivals. Here are a few of the more interesting
options to consider in the area.
Laguna Beach Art Walk
On the first Thursday of every month, locals and visitors alike converge
upon the eclectic group of galleries that line Laguna’s Pacific Coast
Highway for the Laguna Beach Art Walk. Although some proprietor-
ships rely solely on the merit of the artists’ work to bring in a crowd,
others resort to bribery in the form of a light snack and beverages rang-
ing from Evian to chardonnay. Adding to the festival feel is music, some-
times live and sometimes canned. With all the inviting restaurants, a
beautiful stretch of beach, and a dose of culture in such close proximity,
your vacation should start on the first Thursday night of a month.
Admission is free. Free trolley service from approximately 6 to 9 p.m.
starts at the Laguna Art Museum. For more information, call % 949-497-
0716 or go to www.firstthursdaysartwalk.com.
The Festival of Arts and Pageant of the Masters
Presented in July and August since 1932, California’s oldest annual art
show, the Festival of Arts, is held in a scenic 6-acre Laguna Canyon park,
at 650 Laguna Canyon Rd. For a nominal entrance fee ($7 general, $4 stu-
dents and seniors), this celebration of the area’s most esteemed artists
offers an introduction to their work, as well as the opportunity to pur-
chase original artworks to add to your personal collection.
Running concurrently with the festival since 1935 is the renowned
Pageant of the Masters. Set in an outdoor amphitheater accompanied
by live narration and a professional orchestra, this nightly show features
real people in elaborate costumes and settings re-creating classical and

Lookin’ for a tequila sunset?
Whether you’re with that special someone, with a group of great friends, or just taking
in the sights solo, there’s something to be said for relaxing in a perfect setting as the
sun meanders down past the edge of the earth. Las Brisas, 361 Cliff Dr. (% 949-497-
5434), has outdoor seating, fantastic drinks, a mediocre bar menu, and worse dining,
but the view is magnificent. Tasty Mexican food accompanied by great margaritas can
be found in South Laguna Beach at Coyote Grill, 31621 S. Pacific Coast Hwy. (% 949-
499-4033). Watch the sunset and hang out for hours with the locals while enjoying
drinks and appetizers at La Casa del Camino’s casual yet sublime Roof Lounge, 1289
S. Pacific Coast Hwy. (% 949-497-2446), or class it up at Surf & Sand Resort & Spa’s
Splashes Bar, 1555 S. Pacific Coast Hwy. (% 949-497-4477), and then stroll along the
beach — you’ll be literally steps away from it as you sip your chardonnay.

contemporary works of art. It sounds hokey, we know, but it’s not — it’s
actually quite remarkable, and we bet it elicits a wow from even of the
most jaded. The highly coveted tickets to these events go on sale in
December, many months prior to the July opening. They range in price
from $15 to $65, if you’re able to get them from the box office (% 949-
497-6582), and believe the ticket agents when they tell you that there
are no bad seats. Binoculars are a must regardless of where you’re
seated, because they’re the only way to home in on the fine details. If
you’re unable to get tickets the old-fashioned way, fret not — you have a
few alternatives. The box office generally releases a limited number of
tickets each show date, so plan to line up early and cross your fingers. A
reliable way is to try a hotel concierge desk. The most foolproof —
though expensive — way to get tickets is to use a ticket broker: Good
Times (% 714-432-7383) may be able to help you.

they change annually — go the Web site at www.foapom.com or call

Sawdust Art Festival
Over 150 local artists, artisans, and craftspeople exhibit and sell their
wares at the annual summer Sawdust Art Festival. Each booth or display
has a personality of its own — and it’s a fine way to dispense with the
year’s Christmas shopping as you wander across, yes, the sawdust (you
were expecting gold dust?) from wooden booth to wooden booth, check-
ing out pottery, jewelry, painting, and sculpture. Be sure to seek out the
entertainment, craft displays, and cafes. The festival also returns for a
brief stint for four winter weekends — perfect for more holiday shopping!
The Sawdust Art Festival is located at 935 Laguna Canyon Rd. For infor-
mation, call % 949-494-3030 or go to www.sawdustartfestival.org.
Vistas, views, and adventure
Whether you’re a mountain biker, a couple in search of the ideal sunset,
a walking enthusiast trying to burn off what you’ve been indulging in, or
part of a family with children, the Alta Laguna Park will intrigue you.
Begin by heading east on Park Avenue (the first light south of Forest at
Coast Highway). You’ll drive up a steep hill and pass many architectural
delights until you can no longer drive forward at Alta Laguna; at that
point, make a left. Continue over two speed bumps, and then pull into
the parking lot on your right-hand side. After parking, exit the lot the
way you came, only this time by foot, and make a right. On a clear day,
as you reach the picnic tables, you’ll be able to see the coastline extend-
ing all the way from Palos Verdes to the north down to southernmost
San Diego. Offshore, Catalina Island will seem much, much closer than
26 miles across the sea. If you’re yearning for exercise, head in the other
direction through the toddler-friendly playground to the miles of trails
overlooking the expansive canyons and parks of South Orange County.
The park closes at dusk.

isitors have a love-hate relationship with Palm Springs. If you love
desert landscapes, bikinis, bronzed complexions, and an easygoing
vibe, you’ll likely fall into the former category. If you want more culture
and less hot sun, you’ll probably fall in the latter.
Long a place for the rich and the elderly to while away their time, Palm
Springs has a new ring-a-ding-ding hipness for Gen X, lured by the spa-
and-sun lifestyle, while golfers have always loved it. And it has become
one of the top tourist destinations for gay and lesbian travelers, with
more than 40 resorts catering exclusively to the clientele.
The majesty of the surrounding landscape is undeniable: soaring palms
and flowering cacti, the surprising natural lushness and vivid hues of the
landscape, the brilliant blue of the daytime sky and the pink-purple glow
that dusk ushers in, and jagged mountains that rise from the flat desert
floor not too far in the distance. The scale alone is enough to impress.
But the main drag of Palm Springs is frozen in time in a ’50s-meets-
modern-day-strip-mall boredom. And although there are plenty of ways
to sit back and relax, if you’re looking for more stimulation than can be
found by a pool with a frothy drink, look elsewhere.
On the other hand, in this fast-paced, hectic world, what could be better
than a little peace and quiet? Palm Springs is the place to experience the
kind of renewal that only comes from getting away from it all. Whether

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
452
you draw inner peace from communing with spectacular nature or
renewing your acquaintance with a gleaming set of irons, Palm Springs
has the answer for you. And bring the kids: Virtually all the big resorts,
and a few smaller ones, welcome them with open arms — and who’s
happier than a kid frolicking the day away in a sun-splashed pool?
Timing Your Visit
Unlike most of the rest of California, the Palm Springs off season is
summer. From mid- or late May through September, daytime highs soar
into the 100s. We’re talking 110°F or more during July and August. And
one memorable, apocalyptic day, it was 135°F. Those kinds of numbers
can keep away all but the most faithful of sun worshipers — or those
looking for serious hotel deals.
“In-season” is everything else: From October through April, average
highs range between 69°F and 92°F. Keep in mind, however, that you
can’t always count on pool weather during these months; anyone who
knows the desert will tell you that 70°F doesn’t really feel like summer
with virtually no humidity in the air and a sprinkling of clouds in the sky.
The coolest months are usually December through February, when highs
seldom get past the low 70s and nighttime temps dip into the 40s (per-
fect weather if you’re a golfer who doesn’t relish the notion of a broiling
midday sun). Fall and spring are best — that’s when it feels like a regular
summer, with highs generally in the 80s and nights in the 50s or 60s.
Spring and early summer can bring serious winds, gusting about like
nobody’s business.
With the “season” comes the crowd, especially urban-escaping week-
enders and snowbirds (annual refugees from colder climes, often
retirees, who head back home — just like their feathered friends —
’round about Apr). Luckily, the area seldom feels overcrowded. Still, if
you have your heart set on a certain hotel, or you want prime tee times,
plan ahead, especially if your visit falls over a weekend. Spring break —
usually sometime before or around Easter — is worth avoiding if you
can help it.
If you’re not averse to packing an economy-size bottle of sunscreen 
and dealing with a little sizzling heat, off-season — summer — can be a
bargain-hunter’s bonanza. Nothing is very crowded, and hotel rooms go
for a song: You can get terrific accommodations for as little as $49, and
luxury resorts sell $300-a-night rooms for less than $150. Of course, it’s
not a great time to take full-day hikes in the desert, but if your plan is 
to lie under the umbrella poolside, taking a cooling dip every once in a
while, summer is just fine. Even as a golfer, you can enjoy yourself in
summers, as long as you book 6 or 7 a.m. tee times. After the sun goes
down, summer evenings are lovely. Still, know what you’re in for if you
plan a July or August stay: The weather is going to be hot, hot, hot.

Chapter 26: Ring-a-Ding-Ding: Palm Springs 453
If you’re treating this as a vacation from your vacation, a chance to
unwind, you’ll probably need at least three days — it takes a couple of
days alone to really relax! But don’t plan on staying more than two
nights if you’re easily bored.
If you want to work in a side trip to Joshua Tree National Park or Death
Valley National Park (see the “Joshua Tree and Death Valley: A Trip to
the Dry, Hot Desert Parks” section later in this chapter), you should set
aside enough time in your schedule for it.
Getting There
The Palm Springs resorts are 108 miles east of Los Angeles and 141 miles
north of San Diego.
 From L.A., it’s a straight shot east on I-10. Take the Highway 111
turnoff into Palm Springs, which drops you directly onto North
Palm Canyon Drive, the main thoroughfare. The drive takes about
two hours with normal traffic, but be warned that a Friday after-
noon “getaway” can take four hours in bumper-to-bumper gridlock.
If you’re heading to Palm Desert, stay on I-10 past the Highway 111
junction. Exit at Monterey Avenue and turn right. The distance is
122 miles from L.A. to Palm Desert.
 From San Diego, take I-15 north to I-215, then head east on
Highway 60 until you connect to I-10 in Banning. From I-10, take the
Highway 111 turnoff into Palm Springs, which drops you directly
onto North Palm Canyon Drive, the main thoroughfare. The drive
takes about two and a half hours.
If you’re heading from San Diego to Palm Desert, the route changes
a bit. Take I-15 north to Temecula, where you’ll pick up Highway 79
to Highway 371 to Highway 74, which leads you into Palm Desert
from the south. This nice 122-mile drive takes about two and a half
hours. If you’d rather stick to the interstate, follow the directions to
Palm Springs and allow three hours.
Flying right into Palm Springs is also easy. Pleasant Palm Springs
International Airport is just a mile from the heart of downtown at 3400
E. Tahquitz Canyon Way, at El Cielo Road (% 760-318-3800; www.palm
springsairport.com). The following airlines fly in year-round:
 Alaska Airlines: % 800-426-0333; www.alaskaair.com
 American: % 800-433-7300; www.aa.com
 Continental: % 800-525-0280; www.continental.com

454
 United Express: % 800-241-6522; www.united.com
 US Airways: % 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com
Additional smaller carriers such as Harmony and Sun Country fly into
Palm Springs on a seasonal basis. Check the airport Web site for more
details. All the national car-rental companies have airport locations 
(see Chapter 7 for more about renting a car). You can also set up a ride
with one of the desert’s many taxi companies, such as Palm Springs
Taxi (% 760-323-5100) or Yellow Cab of the Desert (% 760-345-8398).
However, we strongly suggest renting a car, unless you plan on parking
yourself at a destination resort or at one of the inns a walk away from
Palm Springs’s Palm Canyon Drive, and intend to do zero exploring.
Orienting Yourself
The desert resorts are a breeze to navigate after you get a handle on
what’s where. They cover a roughly 25-mile-long stretch of desert run-
ning parallel to I-10, from Desert Hot Springs in the northwest to Indio in
the southeast. With the exception of Desert Hot Springs (only worth a
visit if you’re visiting Two Bunch Palms; see “Ahhh — the spa” later in
the chapter), all the big resort communities lie on the south side of I-10,
laid out in an angled grid pattern far enough away from the interstate
that through traffic doesn’t interfere (see the “The Palm Springs Desert
Resorts” map on p. 455).
Palm Springs, the oldest community, is the heart of the desert resort
action. North Palm Canyon Drive is downtown Palm Springs’s main drag,
where many — but not all — of the restaurants and mall and boutique
shopping are. Tahquitz Canyon Way (say Tah-kwitz not Tah-keetz to
avoid sounding like a tourist) meets North Palm Canyon at the town’s
primary intersection, tracking a straight line from the airport into the
heart of town.
Most of the luxury resorts and championship golf courses are in newer
communities to the east of Palm Springs, notably Rancho Mirage, Palm
Desert, and La Quinta. The main connecting road between them is East
Palm Canyon Drive, known as Highway 111 as soon as you leave Palm
Springs. Palm Desert is the desert communities’ other tourism-oriented
commercial hub. Its central intersection is Highway 111 and Monterey
Avenue, with El Paseo (often likened to Beverly Hills’s Rodeo Drive), 
1 block to the south, serving as the main dining-and-shopping drive.
Where to Stay in Palm Springs
We can’t stress it enough: The off-season and other slow times offer
tremendously discounted rates, so if you can plan your trip accordingly,
you can get some great bargains. Be sure to check hotels’ Web sites,
when applicable, where some of these said bargains may be lurking.

If our recommendations are full, try for one of the gazillion other places
to stay through the free reservation services offered by the Palm Springs
Bureau of Tourism (% 800-347-7746; www.palm-springs.org), which
is particularly helpful for gay-oriented lodging.
An extra 10 to 11 percent in taxes will be tacked on to your hotel bill at
checkout time.
Note that in fall 2006, the Colony Palms Hotel, 572 N. Indian Canyon Dr.
(% 800-557-2187; www.colonypalmshotel.com), touted as a “more inti-
mate” version of L.A.’s celebrity- and history-laden Chateau Marmont,
will open. With just as rich a history, not to mention a serious makeover,
expect it to be just as celebrity-friendly, and überhip.
A Place in the Sun Garden Hotel
$$–$$$
Palm Springs
Named because local legend has it that this classic 1950s motor-court
hotel was built to house the crew of the Montgomery Clift/Liz Taylor/
Shelley Winters classic as it shot nearby, this is a kicky way to recapture
old Palm Springs getaways. Sixteen separate bungalow and studios (includ-
ing kitchenettes) are grouped around a saline pool (touted for its health
benefits, a nice retro touch back to when Palm Springs was a weekend
retreat for the well-heeled who needed a touch of health-spa rejuvenation),
which, along with a pet-friendly policy, makes this a good family option.
Rooms themselves are updated and comfortable, but sport too much of a
motel décor to be truly chic. Breakfast (continental on weekdays, more
extensive on the weekends) is served outside in the gazebo.

Caliente Tropics
$$$$
Palm Springs
Devotees of Tiki subculture will go mad for this Polynesian paradise, lov-
ingly restored in 2001 to its original ’60s-era thatched roof grandeur.
Originally built by Ken Kimes, Sr. (husband and father to con artists and
convicted murderers Sante and Kenny Kimes — we can’t help it; we love
our true-crime connections), the resort was a haven for famous faces
including Elvis, Nancy Sinatra, and Victor Mature. After years of decline,
the entire hotel has been revived, and now three wings of 90 rooms and
suites surround a lush pool and garden area, anchored by a full-blown Tiki
lounge (under which was once a nightclub frequented by the Rat Pack,
now filled in with concrete due to earthquake code) and two restaurants.
The rooms are bamboo wonders with comfy and colorful furnishings and
all the amenities you’ll need, including TV with pay-per-view, minifridges,
coffeemakers, hair dryers, high-speed Internet, and more. The hotel hosts
frequent Tiki events (who knew there were such things?) and are espe-
cially pet-friendly. The entire property is nonsmoking.

Casa Cody
$–$$
Palm Springs
Founded by Buffalo Bill’s cousin back in the ’20s, Casa Cody is a charming
and surprisingly modern place to stay. Two dozen lovely rooms, all deco-
rated with Southwestern panache, are set hacienda-style around two pools
and a Jacuzzi. Studios and suites have equipped kitchens, and some have
fireplaces and/or private patios. This is a terrific value — and a great loca-
tion, too, with Palm Canyon shopping and dining a mere stone’s throw away.

Cabazon
This hotel, the casino, and the resort were created by many of the same
people responsible for the hip and happening Palms in Las Vegas. The $250-
million property features a 23-story tower with over 300 large rooms, each
done in luxurious but modern décor including flat-panel TVs, DVD players,
coffee service, high-speed Internet, and much more. The top of the tower
features a two-story glass penthouse with a restaurant and nightclub, while
the base has a 150,000-square-foot casino, more restaurants and nightclubs
(including Palms carry-overs N9NE and Raina, sister to the Sunset Strip’s
legendary Key Club), a luxury spa, and a resort-level pool deck. Oddly, Los
Angeles’s famed punk band X played a show here recently, which either
says something about the band, or something about the kind of clientele
(aging hipsters?) the resort wants to attract. If you want Vegas but don’t
want to actually go to Vegas, you have a great alternative here.

Palm Springs
Its location, 2 blocks from downtown and right next door to the Spa
Casino, is the first reason you should notice this 260-room property, but
the wealth of amenities and very upscale rooms could very well seal the
deal. Every room has a patio or balcony, minibar (sorry, now known as a
“snack center”), TV with pay-per-view and video games, wireless and high-
speed Internet capability, and coffeemakers to name a few. There’s an over-
whelmingly well-equipped fitness center (aren’t you supposed to be on
vacation?), lush gardens surrounding a large pool and two Jacuzzis, an on-
site restaurant, a lounge, and spa facilities. Pay the extra $7 or so for the

Resort Value Pack, which includes parking, unlimited fitness-center access,
Internet, airport shuttle, tennis, phone calls, two-for-one meal coupon, and
more, saving yourself a bunch of dough in the process.

Hyatt Regency Suites

Palm Springs
Located in the heart of downtown, the 193 suites are larger than most in
town, with a small sitting area complementing the sleeping quarters. Each
comes fully equipped with the expected bells and whistles, and though
not exactly luxurious, they are tidy and nicely furnished. Everything is
located off a soaring six-story marble atrium that also features a bar with
limited food service and billiards tables, two full-service restaurants, a gift
shop, a small exercise room, a small spa and salon, and even a putting
green by the valet parking. A big pool deck looks out over a golf course
and the mountains that the kids will love and a pool bar that you will. Rates
can be surprisingly low, which, combined with the terrific location, makes
this a first-rate choice.

Ingleside Inn

Palm Springs
If these walls could talk, you would know a lot more about your favorite
movie star (the host-owner has rubbed shoulders with everyone from
Sinatra to Travolta over the past 25 years). Old Hollywood is preserved in
the heart of the desert — with rich fabrics, dark woods, antiques, art, and
fireplaces. In a word, elegant. No two rooms are alike in this historic full-
service inn, which has welcomed celebrities for more than 60 years. Enjoy
cocktails by the pool (oddly located across the driveway) or watch the
sun set on the wooden porch swing. Dine on Continental cuisine at
Melvyn’s, the hotel’s sophisticated restaurant.

Movie Colony Hotel

Palm Springs
This fab resort hotel is in a renovated ’50s motel, where the original style
is chock-full of the sort of kitsch fun that appeals to retro-lovin’ Gen-X
types, or anyone with a sense of humor (unless midcentury modern, even
served up with a wink, makes you break out in hives). Rooms take after
the W model of sleek boutique hotel, but with a retro wink. It’s a complete
hoot, and a likely place to find self-aware young Hollywood types loung-
ing by the pool.

Orbit In Oasis
$$–$$$$
Palm Springs
This modern revival wonder would be too hip for its own good if the theme
hadn’t been executed so faithfully and spotlessly. Two mid-’50s gems a few
hundred yards from each other had been left to decay in the merciless
desert sun until they were rescued and restored using all the original fix-
tures and architecture from the period. The result is an eye-catching
throwback to the era, complete with groovy furniture (we swear we had
those nightstands in our living room in 1962), funky artwork (Rat Pack
record covers, historical photos of the property), and cool music playing
on the in-room sound systems. Even the bathrooms are period, with pink
tile and ceramic fixtures in some rooms — fun to look at, but they are
small. Rooms come in a variety of sizes and layouts, and each has high-
speed Internet, robes, TV, VCR, and private patio. The Oasis has a saltwater
pool, an outdoor bar/lounge/social area, a Jacuzzi, and complimentary
just-about-everything, including bicycles. The Hideaway has a regular pool
and no Jacuzzi but adds a gorgeous indoor lounge/meeting area with a
giant stacked-slate fireplace. The hipsters would probably love this place,
but the good news is you can, too.

Palm Desert
This family-run motel is a great bet if you want to be near world-class golf
or El Paseo shopping without paying resort prices. The rooms are clean,

big enough to sleep four; some of the poolside units are even bigger and
boast VCRs and/or fully equipped kitchens. A pool and Jacuzzi area is
simply but pleasingly landscaped.

The Parker Palm Springs

Palm Springs
The former Merv Griffin resort reborn to follow the evolution of Hollywood
royalty, this resort good-naturedly allowed itself (and its ilk) to be skew-
ered on the Emmy-nominated HBO series The Comeback. Comfy but some-
times tiny rooms, hip but sometimes remote décor, and best of all, the
jostling for the best position by the pool — it was all there. And yet, so is
everyone else, drawn by all the resort opportunities (four pools, including
two indoor separated by gender, tennis, spa, even croquet!) and the gen-
erally posh and pampering atmosphere. It’s definitely grown-up playtime,
and you never know what famous — or used-to-be-famous-and-looking-for-
a-comeback — face might be reclining on the adjacent lounge chair.

Spa Resort and Casino

Palm Springs
Because most of Palm Springs is on the Agua Caliente Indian reservation,
this is probably the only town in California with a casino right in the center
of it. Of course, the casino and all its attendant restaurants are just an
amenity. The main attractions for a long time (and a long time to come)
are the unique hot-water mineral wells that power the spa portion of the
resort’s name, with two huge pools (one mineral, one regular), two thera-
peutic Jacuzzis, and a state-of-the-art spa with every treatment known to
man (including their signature Five Waters — wet sauna, dry sauna, euca-
lyptus aromatherapy, mineral-water tub, and cool-down relaxation room).
Each of the 228 basic hotel rooms has a balcony or a patio, offering beau-
tiful views of the surrounding mountains, and has all the comforts needed
to make this a great getaway spot.

Two Bunch Palms
$$$–$$$$$
Desert Hot Springs
If you’re coming to the desert to do the spa thing, here’s your heaven. Push
thoughts of bouffanted ladies in designer sweat suits out of your mind —
Two Bunch is intimate, easygoing, and understated, the kind of low-key
oasis where multimillionaire movie execs and splurging suburban house-
wives are at one in their quest to de-stress. Spread over 56 lush acres, this
eclectic low-rise complex has been here since the 1930s (Al Capone used
it as a hideout). Accommodations range from simple but comfortable
guest rooms to full-on villas. Frankly, the accommodations are nothing spe-
cial; the real draw is the phenomenal menu of spa treatments, the oh-so-
soothing natural mineral grotto, and the unparalleled service. More than
divine — sublime.

Villa Rosa Inn

This hidden and charming gem is under new management, has undergone

Amenities include a TV, refrigerator, pool towels, morning paper, and con-
tinental breakfast with fruit plucked from the inn’s fruit trees.

Palm Springs
Hideaways don’t get more romantic than this restored 1930s Mediterranean
villa, which once played host to names such as Gable, Lombard, and
Einstein. Set against the mountains just a stone’s throw from Palm Canyon
Drive, it’s both conveniently located and deliciously private. Eight luxuri-
ous rooms overflow with antiques, sumptuous textiles, and other impec-
cable appointments, plus modern comforts including TVs and dataports.
Gorgeous gardens and a fine pool complete the perfect picture. A stay here
makes a worthy special-occasion splurge.

Wyndham Palm Springs
$$–$$$$
Palm Springs
Its location next to the convention center is a great choice for business
travelers, but take note of it if you’re traveling with a family. The hotel has
the biggest pool and recreation area in town (5,000 sq. ft. and 24,000 sq. ft.,
respectively), beautiful public areas that include an on-site restaurant
(serving Tuscan cuisine), and a lounge with a pool table and other games.
The 410 rooms in no way leave a long-lasting impression, with their
vaguely Mediterranean décor, but they’re big and comfortably furnished.
All rooms have convertible sofas, minifridges, high-speed Internet, two
TVs with pay-per-view movies, and more — and many have balconies or
patios, allowing for some great views. Only about a half-mile farther from
downtown than some of the other big-name resorts, the walk there should
be a pleasant one — unless it’s 110°F outside.

Where to Dine in Palm Springs
The Palm Springs area boasts lots of excellent restaurants, but don’t
expect much in the way of innovation. Strangely, the trend is toward tra-
ditional styles of cuisine, which may strike some as too formal or heavy
for the desert. But desert dwellers really love classic French food served
on white linen and bone china by tuxedoed waiters. That said, diversity
abounds — it’s just a matter of knowing where to look.
Cuistot
$$$–$$$$
Palm Desert
CALIFORNIA-FRENCH
Here’s the desert’s best restaurant — no small claim in an area that invites
so much disposable income. Expect dazzling French cuisine with enough
innovation and lightness of touch to give it a distinct California flair, with
unpretentious, welcoming service, and the kind of perfectly calibrated
lighting that makes diamonds sparkle just that much more. Inside seating
is preferable to the patio thanks to the winning ambience of the contem-
porary room. A real star — perfect for celebrating.

Hamburger Mary’s
$$
Palm Springs
DINER
One of about a dozen locations nationwide, this sassy little joint is sort of
a gay-friendly version of T.G.I. Friday’s, with posters of Liberace, Debbie
Reynolds, and any movie with the word Mary in it decorating the walls.
Tops on your list should be the burgers. How can you resist a half-pounder
stabbed with garlic cloves and doused in red wine called Buffy the
Hamburger Slayer? The chicken-ranch sandwich comes slathered in a
tangy hot sauce along with cool ranch, making a fun flavor combo, and is,
like much of the offerings, bigger than your head. No human being should
be able to consume this much food at one sitting, but it sure is fun trying.
Soups, some inventive salads (steak and potato, crispy caramel chicken),
wraps, hot and cold sandwiches, and a couple of entrees (fajitas, steak,
chicken potpie) round out the menu, with most items less than $10. Oh,
and even if you don’t think it’ll go with your meal, don’t miss the aptly
named Mary’s Tasty Fries, coated in a zesty seasoning powder and piled
higher than a drag queen’s wig. Yum.

Generations of Southern Californians who journeyed to Lake Arrowhead

they have a branch here is a marvelous addition to a Palm Springs get-
away. A fine, small deli offers plenty of prepared and preparable picnic and
other snacks (especially nice because so many local hotel rooms come
with kitchenettes). Their sheepherder’s bread, a crusty yet fluffy loaf, is a
must-try, not to mention a frequent take-home, though we remain partial
to the glazed donuts dipped in chocolate, a combination we wish more
donut shops would consider. From cakes to beer, it’s a useful stop.

$$$–$$$$
Palm Springs
FRENCH
For more than 30 years, this elegant little restaurant, in a restored, historic
home tucked up by the mountain, has widely been considered the best of
the best in Palm Springs, and for good reason. The tuxedo-clad staff, the
white tablecloths, the elegant dining rooms, the gorgeous outdoor dining
patio (always pleasant thanks to the quietly humming swamp coolers), and
even the piano player (“Strangers in the night, exchanging glances . . .”) all
act as a throwback to the days when going out for a good meal was an
event not to be taken lightly. The menu changes often — in fact, it’s pre-
sented on giant dry-erase boards brought to your table — but the French-
influenced cuisine offers enough variety to delight all taste buds. The veal
medallions smothered in an earthy truffle sauce with mushroom ravioli
are stunning, a melt-in-your-mouth experience that made us want to
cleanse our palates between forkfuls to get that first bite feeling over and
over again. Wine connoisseurs take note: The phone-book-sized wine list
covers every base from recognizable domestic to fascinating international
varieties, including a ten-bottle course of such rare vintage that it costs a
cool $25,000 for the privilege.

Gay Palm Springs
Palm Springs has become a major destination for gays and lesbians, with
more than 40 hotels devoted exclusively to the community. What we
include in this section is a small representation of some of the better
and/or more interesting resorts (shown on the map earlier in this chap-
ter), offering a wide variety of styles, prices, and atmospheres. Most are
clothing optional and although some are traditional hotels in all aspects
of the word, you may find things happening in the pool that you won’t
see at the Hyatt. If strict rest and relaxation is more important to you
than being amongst “family,” then check out one of the resorts listed 
earlier in this chapter.
Where to stay

East Canyon
$$$–$$$$$
Palm Springs
This former ’50s-era apartment building was transformed a few years back
into one of the most luxurious of the gay resorts, complete with 300-count
linens, giant bathrooms, tastefully restrained décor, and an on-site day spa.
With only 12 relatively expensive rooms (ranging from two-queen-bed stan-
dards to a suite with square footage and furnishings to rival big-name luxe
resorts), the service is friendly and personal, and the clientele more intent
on relaxing than partying. This is the only gay resort that is not clothing
optional at the pool or Jacuzzi area, lending a quiet air of civility often
missing from the rest of the pack. It’s not really within walking distance to
many of the other gay resorts or bars, so consider it an oasis in the gay
desert, if that’s what you’re looking for.

Inn Exile

Palm Springs
This is one of the most popular resorts in the Warm Sands area, drawing
a diverse crowd that trends a little younger than most places in the neigh-
borhood. The sprawling modern Southwestern compound is mostly con-
crete, rock, and stucco — not a lot of greenery here — but it does feature
four pools (including a long, shallow “promenade” pool), two Jacuzzis, a
steam room, a lounge with snacks and a billiard table, a fully stocked exer-
cise studio, and a small on-site cafe for pizza, salads, coffee, and more. The
31 guest rooms come in a variety of sizes and shapes, from simple studios
to one-bedroom suites with fireplaces, but all have TVs, VCRs, fridges, and
microwaves. Some rooms are modernized versions of old rooms, and, as
such, the bathrooms in them are very small. Everything is well maintained,
clean, and modern — a refreshing change next to some of the places in
this market. The frisky-o-meter is off the charts here, but in a way that
seems much more tasteful than some of the other more carnal hotels.
Friendly staff and clientele make this a sure option if you’re looking for a
frolicking good time.

Warm Sands Villas
$$–$$$
Palm Springs
If you want to be in the heart of the gay resort area but don’t want to deal
with the noise and “activity” that most of those resorts bring with them,
there is no better choice than Warm Sands Villas. Built in the ’30s and ’40s
as a desert getaway for the rich and famous (Clark Gable and Shirley

Temple were said to be regulars here), the entire facility has been brought
up to date with modern furnishings that are simple but functional, and com-
fortable to boot. Many rooms have kitchenettes and a few have fireplaces;
all have TVs with built-in VCRs, free cable, and “educational channels.” The
only downside we see is that some units have bathrooms that should be
measured in inches rather than feet. The rooms, the gorgeous lawns and
lush landscaping, the charming Jacuzzi, the unique rooftop sun deck, and
the giant pool are all lovingly cared for, and the clientele tends to the over-
30 set, making this a quiet getaway in the midst of the madness.

Finding the nightlife
Because the gay resorts are the primary meeting grounds — many
people BYOB and resort-hop — the gay bars in town are not as “must-
see” as those in some other meccas. But you certainly have a lot to
choose from if you feel the need to get away from the pool. Here are two
of the best:
 Hunter’s, 302 E. Arenas Rd. (% 760-323-0700; www.huntersnight
clubs.com), is probably the most popular, a big two-room space,
with music videos and the like in one and a dance floor command-
ing the second. A nice outdoor patio with misters is perfect for a
warm evening cocktail and cruise of the traffic on Arenas Road,
where you’ll find several bars and gay-themed businesses. Hunter’s
is event-heavy, with a Wednesday night underwear contest that is
now legendary.
 Tool Shed, 600 E. Sunny Dunes Dr. (% 760-320-3299; www.toolshed-
ps.com), a dark dungeon of a leather bar packed tight with devo-
tees and a few wide-eyed naves who choose it because it’s within
walking distance of the gay resorts.
Several other bars can be found in town, mostly of the neighborhood
variety, but also more themed bars as well. You can get more informa-
tion on most of them at the Desert Gay Tourism Guild (www.palm
springsgayinfo.com).
Exploring Palm Springs and the Resorts
A surprising number of activities exist out here, but if you just want to
hang around the pool or pamper yourself with a spa treatment, we won’t
blame you at all.
Touring the top attractions
You can locate these top attractions on the map earlier in this chapter.

Palm Springs Aerial Tramway
Probably Palm Springs’s best-known traditional sightseeing attraction is
this cool funicular, which takes you on a 10- to 12-minute ascent 21⁄2 miles
to near the top of Mount San Jacinto, the second highest point in Southern
California. It’s quite a remarkable ride, straight up the side of the moun-
tain through five different climate zones — somewhat akin to moving from
Mexico to Alaska inside of minutes. The ride is perfectly stable, and sleek
new Swiss funicular cars rotate to give you 360-degree views along the way.
Still, it’s not for anyone who’s afraid of heights, because the car ascends
at a very steep angle — that cable looks mighty small, even to brave
hearts, after you’re far enough off the ground to notice. Otherwise, the
entire family will love it.
At the top is the 14,000-acre Mount San Jacinto State Park and Wilderness
Area, an alpine setting, complete with 54 miles of hiking trails, plus a three-
story ’60s-ski-lodge-style building housing a minimuseum, a fine dining
restaurant called the Peaks, and an adequate cafeteria called the Pines
(skip the Ride ’n’ Dine package unless you’re planning on spending the
day). You can spend the whole day here or just come up for the panoramic
views and head back down on the next tram out. Temperatures are typi-
cally 40 degrees cooler than on the desert floor, so bring a sweater in
summer, a full-fledged coat in winter. Snow covers the ground in the cold
months; locals bring the kids up for sledding and other snowy fun. An
adventure center (% 760-325-1449) rents snowshoes and cross-country
skis. Bring your AAA card or check for an online coupon to soften the blow.

3 p.m.) $34 adults, $22 kids.
Palm Springs Desert Museum
This small but well-endowed museum is Palm Springs’s secret weapon in
the culture wars, standing brave and tall against the schmaltz that tends
to dominate the desert. Highlights include terrific Western and Native
American art collections, as well as natural-science and history exhibits
focusing on the local Coachella Valley desert and its first people, the
Cahuilla tribe. The well-curated special exhibits stick to similar themes.

The Living Desert
Part museum, part zoo, and all learning center, this wildlife and botanical
park is dedicated to introducing the wonders of the local ecosystem to
those who consider the desert a flat, colorless, inhospitable wasteland.
Chapter 26: Ring-a-Ding-Ding: Palm Springs 469

You can walk or take a tram ride through re-creations of several distinct
desert zones, seeing and learning about the local geology, plants, insects,
and wildlife as you go. Critters run the gamut from tarantulas to mountain
lions, with bighorn sheep, roadrunners, and golden eagles in the mix.
Although you can’t beat seeing the real desert with the help of an outfit-
ter (see the “Desert excursions” section later in the chapter), this is a great
alternative if you’re not so inclined or if you have a family with little ones.

a wave-action pool, an inner-tube ride, and lots more wet ’n’ wild fun.

It’s adjacent to the airport, so flying demonstrations are a regular part of
the program. Many of the tour guides are veterans, so expect lots of good
real-life stories, too.
See map p. 455. 745 N. Gene Autry Trail (between Ramon and Vista Chino roads). 
% 760-778-6262. www.palmspringsairmuseum.org. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Admission: $10 adults, $8.50 seniors and military, $5 kids 6–12, free for children 5 and
under.
VillageFest
If you can time your visit to include a Thursday night, you can catch this
once-weekly street fair and farmers’ market. The main drag in Palm Springs
is closed down for several blocks worth of food, music, art, entertainment,
and a few delirious oddities (“Meet the Author!”; “Ask the Rabbi!”). The
whole thing has the air of a Midwestern small-town celebration, where
neighbors greet each other with a “hey” as they chow down on homemade
creations. Okay, perhaps it’s not as Mayberry as all that, but it’s pretty
darn fun, anyway.

Casino hopping, Palm Springs–style
Palm Springs seems designed to make you want to just sit down in the
shade and relax for a while. But if you’re like us, sitting is entertaining
only for so long unless something exceptionally good is on TV or you
have a really fabulous book. So what do you do in Palm Springs if you
don’t like to golf and you’ve already done the few attractions worth visit-
ing in the city? Gamble, of course, silly!
California allows Las Vegas–style gambling on Native American reserva-
tions throughout the state. Because the bulk of the Palm Springs area is
either on or near one of many tribal reservations, the city has been one
of the hot spots for the multibillion-dollar state gaming market. Six major
casinos are in the area, and we took a driving tour of all of them back to
back. (There was nothing good on TV.)
 We started at the Spa Resort and Casino, 401 Amado Rd. (% 800-
258-2WIN; www.sparesortcasino.com), in the heart of downtown
Palm Springs. The casino portion was co-developed by the folks at
MGM Mirage (Bellagio, MGM Grand, and others), and although they
don’t have a hand in running it, their imprint is all over the place.
Lovely, rambling Spanish Mission architecture on the outside and
tastefully understated décor on the inside make the place a virtual
replica of about half a dozen Vegas casinos we know and like.
Gamblers can choose from 900 slots and video poker of varying
denominations from 5¢ to $5, all with the handy ticket-in/ticket-out
technology. Table games such as blackjack, roulette, and Let It Ride
ring the center of the room, while a lounge with live entertainment,
an upscale Asian restaurant, and a good and inexpensive buffet line
the outside.
 Next we jumped on Highway 111 north out of town to I-10 and
drove a few miles to Cabazon, the home of the Casino Morongo
Resort, 49500 Seminole Dr. (% 800-252-4499; www.morongocasino
resort.com). Anyone who is familiar with Vegas, including us, will
drive up to the place thinking, “This looks a lot like the Palms.”
There’s a good reason for that: Many of the people involved in cre-
ating that Vegas hot spot worked on Casino Morongo. At more than
150,000 square feet, it’s larger than most Vegas gambling halls but
looks instantly familiar, with plenty of recognizable slots and all the
typical table games presented in a tastefully sleek and modern
package.
 Back in the car, we headed east on I-10 about 26 miles to the Ramon
Road exit in Rancho Mirage, where we found the Agua Caliente
Casino, 32–250 Bob Hope Dr. (% 760-321-2000; www.hotwater
casino.com), at the end of the off ramp. This is the sister casino to
the Spa in Palm Springs, and although it’s not quite as nice as its

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
472
newer sibling, you still will probably never be able to tell you aren’t
in Vegas after you get inside the doors. Several restaurants, bars,
and lounges keep you amused if all the slots, video poker, and
blackjack tables aren’t doing it for you.
 The next leg of the journey took us on another 20-mile-or-so drive
east on I-10 to Indio — not a bad drive, especially if done at off-peak
hours. Get off at Golf Center Parkway, cross over the freeway, and
take a frontage road to find Fantasy Springs Casino, 84–245 Indio
Springs Pkwy. (% 800-827-2946; www.fantasyspringsresort.
com). Expanded from a relatively simple casino in 2006, Fantasy
Springs now includes a 250-room hotel, several restaurants and
lounges, a bowling center, and a larger casino with the latest slots
and video poker plus the traditional table games.
 Once again to I-10, only this time we got off the freeway almost as
soon as we got on, taking the 86S bypass route to the Dillon Road
exit a couple of miles down the pike. Go under the freeway and
you’ll see Spotlight 29, 46–200 Harrison Place, Coachella (% 866-
377-6829; www.spotlight29.com). It was called Trump — yes, that
Trump — before reverting back to its original tribal given name.
Fear not: The sleek, modernist revival building actually looks much
more appealing up close than it does zooming by on the nearby
interstate. Inside, the retro-chic design continues through the giant
casino with tons of slots, table games, a huge poker room, several
restaurants, a food court with a McDonald’s, and a showroom fea-
turing a rotating list of B- or even C-list entertainers.
 The final casino on the list is one you can feel free to skip if 
you’ve had enough — and really, who can blame you at this point?
Augustine Casino, 84–001 Avenue 54 (% 888-PLAY2WIN; www.
augustinecasino.com), is about 7 miles down a dark and desolate
(at least at night) two-lane highway in Coachella. It’s smaller than
the others, unimaginatively designed with machines and tables
crammed in too tightly, and it seemingly caters to mostly hard-core,
stone-faced video-poker junkies. Unless you’re one of them, there’s
no need to visit. Instead, get back on I-10 going west. Go back to the
Ramon Road exit and take that west about 8 miles to the heart of
downtown Palm Springs.
So, how did we do on our gambling junket? Well, California casinos are
notoriously stingier than Vegas casinos (if you can believe it), and we
now have evidence of it. On this particular tour, we did poorly every-
where, except for Spotlight 29, and only moderately so then. However,
on subsequent visits we did quite well at both Casino Morongo and the
Spa Casino, so perhaps it’s not all bad news.
Hitting the links
If fairways and five-irons draw you to the desert, your best bet is to stay
at one of the area golf resorts, such as La Quinta or Rancho Las Palmas,
where you can play on some of the country’s best championship golf

courses without leaving the grounds (see the “Where to Stay in Palm
Springs” section earlier in the chapter). La Quinta, in particular, is home
to some of the finest fairways around; in fact, three of the four are
ranked in Golf magazine’s “Top 100 Courses You Can Play.”
Other resorts you may want to consider include Hyatt Grand Champions
(% 800-633-7313 or 760-341-1000; www.hyatt.com) and Westin Mission
Hills (% 888-625-5144 or 760-328-5955; www.westinmissionhillsgolf.
com). Westin’s Resort Course is a stellar Pete Dye design that’s more for-
giving than most of his legendary courses. Expect greens fees to be
between $80 and $175; twilight rates cut fees nearly in half.
If you want to experience desert golf but you’re not up to splurging on
one of the big boys, consider Tahquitz Creek, 1885 Golf Club Dr., off East
Palm Canyon Drive between Gene Autry Trail and Cathedral Canyon
Drive, Palm Springs (% 800-743-2211 or 760-328-2375; www.tahquitz
creek.com), whose two diverse courses run by the Arnold Palmer
Group appeal to mid-handicappers. Greens fees range from $45 to $70,
and discounted twilight rates are available.
Another good bet is Palm Springs Country Club, 2500 Whitewater Club
Dr., off Vista Chino Road (% 760-323-2626; www.palmsprings.com/
golf/pscc.html), home to the oldest public course in Palm Springs,
and especially popular with golfers on a budget. Greens fees start
around $35 and go even lower for twilight hours.
Tee times at many courses can’t be booked more than a few days in
advance (a problem for hotel nonguests who want to play at the big
resorts), but several companies can make advance arrangements for
you, the best of which is Golf à la Carte (% 877-887-6900; www.palm
springsgolf.com). Palm Springs Tee Times (% 760-324-5012; www.
palmspringsteetimes.com) may be able to book you in at a discount
as much as 60 days in advance.
Always ask about golf packages when you’re making hotel reservations,
because many area properties — even the most unassuming motels —
offer packages that include tee times.
If you arrive in the desert without prebooked tee times, Stand-By Golf
(% 760-321-2665) specializes in same-day and next-day tee times.
The visitor bureau is dedicated to making golfers happy and can provide
you with tons of additional golf information (see the “Gathering More
Information” section later in this chapter). Their great Desert Golf Guide
is available to purchase online at www.desertgolfguide.com, which
also offers a complete list of the many tournaments held in the area
(mainly Nov–Apr), including celebrity pro-ams, if you’re more the spec-
tating type than a hands-on golfer. Another excellent source is Golfer’s
Guide (www.golfersguide.com).

474
Ahhhh — the spa
The desert is the perfect place to indulge in some serious pampering.
Without a doubt, our top place to relax is at Two Bunch Palms, 67–425
Two Bunch Palms Trail, Desert Hot Springs (% 800-472-4334 or 760-329-
8791; www.twobunchpalms.com). You can enjoy this place even if you
don’t stay over. Book one of the little-advertised Day Spa packages, which
include two one-hour treatments, lunch or dinner, and full access to the
grounds for six to nine hours, plus taxes and gratuities for (at press time,
at least) $395 to $435 plus the cost of a taxi back to your hotel when it’s
all over, because human gelatin just can’t drive. Call seven days in
advance to make your reservations. For further information, see the
“Where to Stay in Palm Springs” section earlier in the chapter.
For something a little more down to earth, book a treatment or two 
at the Spa Hotel and Casino, 100 N. Indian Canyon Dr., Palm Springs 
(% 888-293-0180 or 760-778-1772; www.sparesortcasino.com), run by
the Aqua Caliente tribe on a square block of reservation land in the
heart of town. The natural therapeutic hot-spring waters are the same
that local Native Americans have been using for hundreds of years, but
now they’ve built a sleekly modern, full-service spa around ’em.
Desert excursions
In addition to the following options, you may also consider a day trip 
to Joshua Tree National Park (see the “Joshua Tree and Death Valley: 
A Trip to the Dry, Hot Desert Parks” section later in this chapter).
Taking a guided tour
To the untrained eye, the desert can look like a lot of nothing. Put your-
self in the hands of a knowledgeable and enthusiastic guide, however,
and it’s a whole different story — an entire, fascinating world you never
knew existed will open up to you like a rare flower.
Ol’ Blue Eyes slept here
In the mood for some sanctioned gawking? Then hitch a ride on a nice air-conditioned
bus for one of the Palm Springs Celebrity Tours, in the RimRock Plaza Center, at Gene
Autry Trail and Highway 111 (% 760-770-2700). Some actual history is thrown into the
mix, but most of the tour is dedicated to seeing the stars’ homes. The company also
offers a streamlined one-hour version for $25 adults, $23 seniors, and $12 kids 14 and
under. But if you’re gonna do it, go for the whole enchilada: The two-and-a-half-hour
tour heads into Rancho Mirage and Palm Desert to take in the grandest estates of the
biggest celebs — yep, including Sinatra — at a cost of $32 adults, $30 seniors, and
$14 for kids. Make advance reservations.

Chapter 26: Ring-a-Ding-Ding: Palm Springs 475
Hands down, the area’s best tour operator is Desert Adventures Jeep
Eco-Tours (% 888-440-5337 or 760-340-2345; www.red-jeep.com),
whose off-road eco-tours, offered in signature seven-seater red Jeeps, are
led by naturalist guides. The company is extremely reliable, and the
experienced guides are great at communicating their vast knowledge of
desert ecology, geology, history, and lore as well as earthquake science
in a manner that’s both smart and enjoyable. They’re expert at giving
meaning to what you see around you.
Still, the experience isn’t for everyone. For one thing, the open Jeep is
bouncy and dusty, and the weather can get really hot in summer.
(Springtime, in particular, is a great time to go, because the weather is
ideal and the wildflowers are in bloom.) If you have mobility issues, ask
whether the tour can comfortably accommodate you. Kids, on the other
hand, will love the rough-and-ready “on safari” feeling, although the
tours don’t accept children younger than 6.
Offerings change periodically, so call or check the Web site to see what’s
on while you’re in town. Most tours include a visit to the legendary San
Andreas Fault, with detailed explanations of how tectonic forces work
and a look at evidence of recent and ongoing fault activity. If you have
cultural interests, you can choose to tour an authentically re-created
ancient Cahuilla village to find out how Native Americans carved a life
out of the barren land. Tours that include desert walks are also offered
for hikers. Tours last three or four hours and vary in price from $79 to
$129 ($5 off for seniors and kids younger than 12). Reservations are
required; call at least a day in advance.
Hiking
The reservation land that comprises Indian Canyons (% 800-790-3398
or 760-323-6018; www.palmsprings.com/points/canyon), at the end of
South Palm Canyon Drive (3 miles south of the turnoff for East Palm
Canyon/Highway 111), is terrific hiking territory. At press time, four
stunning canyons were open to hikers of all levels; stop at the Trading
Post for detailed trail maps. Admission is $8 adults, $6 seniors and stu-
dents, and $4 for kids 6 to 12. Open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; tours are
offered daily at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. Call ahead in summer; the canyons are
closed from June through Labor Day.
A visit to the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum, in the Village Green
Heritage Center, 219 S. Palm Canyon Dr., at Arenas Road (% 760-323-
0151; www.accmuseum.org), pairs up well with a visit to Indian Canyons.
Of particular note is the beautiful collection of basketry. Admission is
free. From Labor Day through Memorial Day, the museum is open
Wednesday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday noon to 
5 p.m.; during summer, hours are Friday and Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
and Sunday noon to 5 p.m.

Shopping
If you’re looking to spend money, you’ll have no trouble in Palm Springs.
Boutiques are abundant along Palm Canyon Drive and the side streets in
the heart of Palm Springs. If you’re an antiques and collectibles hunter —
especially if you have groovy midcentury-modern tastes — you’ll enjoy
the many ’50s finds along North Palm Canyon, north of the downtown
action.
Over in Palm Desert, you’ll find Beverly Hills–style boutiquing along El
Paseo, which curves south off Highway 111 between Fred Waring Drive
and Cook Street and is lined with about 200 higher-end shops.
The Gardens on El Paseo is a lovely open-air mall at El Paseo and
Larkspur Drive (% 760-862-1990; www.thegardensonelpaseo.com),
with offerings that run the gamut from Ann Taylor to terrific one-of-a-
kind shops and galleries. One of our favorites is the Tommy Bahama’s
Emporium (% 760-836-0288), a terrific source for island and desert
resort wear.
Living It Up after Dark
For the latest bar and club happenings, pick up the free weekly Desert
Sun Weekend, easily available around town. Also check out the Desert
Guide, available at the visitor centers (see the “Gathering More
Information” section, later in this chapter).
Nightlife revolves largely around North Palm Canyon Drive, at the heart
of downtown Palm Springs. Restaurants and bars spill out onto the
street until late, so your best bet is to just wander down the street and
pop into whichever establishment pleases you.
The rollicking street festival known as VillageFest takes over Palm
Canyon Drive, between Amado and Baristo roads, on Thursdays from 
7 to 10 p.m. (6–10 p.m. Oct–Apr). The all-ages fun offers arts-and-crafts
vendors, food booths, and street entertainers.
The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies, 128 S. Palm Canyon Dr. (% 760-327-
0225; www.palmspringsfollies.com), is a Vegas-style extravaganza
filled with show tunes from the ’30s and ’40s and lively production num-
bers complete with leggy showgirls. This silly show is so popular that it
has run for over a decade; reserve in advance. Tickets run from $42 to
$95 for the two-and-a-half-hour show; matinees are slightly lower.
For more highbrow entertainment, see what’s on at the McCallum
Theatre, at the Bob Hope Cultural Center, 73000 Fred Waring Dr., Palm
Desert (% 760-340-ARTS; www.mccallum-theatre.org).

Joshua Tree and Death Valley: A Trip 
to the Dry, Hot Desert Parks
Sure, Palm Springs is hot and dry. But it’s just steps away from a wet
martini, served poolside under shady palms, and within crawling dis-
tance of a frosty air-conditioned hotel suite. If it’s really dry and really
hot you crave, however, you’re in the right neighborhood. California’s
desert parks are great places to experience the wonders of the desert
outside the carefully pruned environs of Palm Springs resort living. As
national parks, they preserve refuges of rare beauty, where living things
thrive in a seemingly hostile environment. Here are two wilderness areas
where you can fully experience the desert’s rough-edged grandeur.
Joshua Tree National Park
Joshua Tree National Park got its name from the oddball tree that’s
actually a yucca. The park encompasses two quite different desert envi-
ronments: In the northwestern section — where you’ll enter the park —
is the Mojave Desert, the cragged, hilly land where rugged boulders set
the tone and the Joshua tree lives. Head southeast through the park, and
the elevation drops and the landscape morphs into the hotter, drier,
Colorado Desert, which looks more like the desert you expect, dotted
with cacti and creosote. Oases here point to natural water sources and
serve as gathering spots for the park’s wildlife — a range of critters,
from roadrunners to golden eagles to bighorn sheep. The park was hit
by two serious wildfires (started by lightning strikes) in July 2006, but
though many acres were burned, from nature’s viewpoint, fire can be as
invigorating as it is devastating. Old growth is burned away, allowing the
chance for newer plants and even species to emerge. It was hardly the
first time the park has endured such a thing, and it was fairly small by
comparison with the nearly 19,000-acre wildfire in 1999. The main con-
cern is for the trees themselves; it takes about 100 years to replace a
Joshua tree.
 When to come: Spring or fall.
 How much time to set aside: A full day’s trip from Palm Springs.
Leave early in the morning; the park entrance is a good hour from
the resorts.
 Getting there: None of the three access points is close to Palm
Springs. The South (Cottonwood Spring) Entrance is off I-10, about
53 miles east of Palm Springs, but we don’t suggest you use it.
Instead, use either the West Entrance, at the village of Joshua Tree,
or the North (Oasis of Mara) Entrance in Twentynine Palms. To
reach both entrances from Palm Springs, take Gene Autry Trail to 
I-10 west; after 6 miles, take the turnoff for Highway 62 (the
Twentynine Palms Highway), which curves around the west and
north sides of the park. The distance is about 44 miles to the West
Entrance, 55 miles to Twentynine Palms and the main gate.
Chapter 26: Ring-a-Ding-Ding: Palm Springs 477

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
478
At the corner of National Park Drive and Utah Trail, a half-mile
south of Highway 62 in the funky desert town of Twentynine Palms,
is the Oasis Visitor Center, the park’s official main visitor center,
open daily from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. The park has no restaurants or
stores, so pick up any supplies you’ll need in Twentynine Palms.
 Where to stay: The park offers no lodgings, but Twentynine Palms
has a few basic options within 5 miles of the North Entrance. Or
choose from nine basic campgrounds scattered throughout the
park. Find further details, including fee information, online at www.
nps.gov/jotr.
 What to see: The best bet if you’re a day-tripper looking for the full
Joshua Tree experience is to enter the park at either the West or
North entrance and explore the northern loop (Park Boulevard)
first. Then follow the Pinto Basin Road to the lush southeast
Cottonwood section of the park where you can exit the park, go
south to I-10, and be back in Palm Springs for dinner. This drive will
take you past all the major highlights and through both desert cli-
mate zones. (The distance through the park from the North
Entrance to the Cottonwood gate is 41 miles.)
 Worth knowing: Despite the optimism in the introductions, the
series of major brush fires in 2006 may have affected some of the
details listed earlier. Be sure to call ahead or visit the National Park
Service Web site to find out if any areas of the park are closed
before you visit.
 For more information: Contact the Park Superintendent (% 760-
367-5500; www.nps.gov/jotr). The Joshua Tree National Park
Association’s site at www.joshuatree.org is even more useful.
Death Valley National Park
Death Valley National Park may not be on your agenda on your first trip
to California. No easy way exists to get there, it’s not close to anything,
and services are minimal. Still, plenty of people manage to work Death
Valley into their vacation plans. You can’t deny the draw of such extremes:
The hottest, the highest, the largest, the lowest, the driest — you want it,
Death Valley’s got it. The landscape is both savage and spectacular.
 When to come: Most people prefer to visit the park in the temper-
ate months, from October through April. Heat-seeking desert lovers
come in the summer when the crowds thin out and daytime tem-
peratures soar well past 100°F.
 How much time to set aside: Death Valley is the largest national
park in the lower 48 states. Because you need to set aside two days
for driving alone, a visit to Death Valley requires a minimum of
three days. Four is smarter.
 Getting there: Even though Death Valley is basically due east of the
Central Coast, some pesky mountains and a couple of national

Chapter 26: Ring-a-Ding-Ding: Palm Springs 479
forests conspire to make you go south — way south — to get there.
From Southern California, take I-15 (which connects with I-10
midway between L.A. and Palm Springs) to Baker, where you con-
nect with Highway 127 north to Highway 190 east. The drive is 
300 miles or six and a half hours. Or you can take I-14 north from
the L.A. area (it connects with I-5) to Highway 178 to Highway 190,
which takes roughly the same amount of time.
 What to see: Death Valley has been called a “windshield wilder-
ness” because the best way to see the park is by car. Two-lane
roads wind through a remote landscape devoid of commercial
activity. Note that you should only tackle many of the park’s back-
country roads in a four-wheel-drive vehicle or a light truck.
The place to start is Death Valley Visitor Center, in the middle of
the park at Furnace Creek, 15 miles inside the eastern boundary 
at the junction of highways 190 and 178, open daily from 8 a.m. to 
6 p.m. If you’re traveling out of the Furnace Creek Visitor Center,
take the 24-mile drive through Furnace Creek Walsh badlands to
Dante’s View, a scenic overlook with a park basin panorama amid
enveloping mountain ranges. Or take Artist’s Drive, which coils
through colorful canyon terrain. In the northwest section of the
park is Scotty’s Castle, a 1920s mansion built in the desert as a
vacation retreat. It’s got a pool fit for a desert — all 270 feet of it.
Reserve ahead for tours of the house and grounds.
 Where to stay: The valley holds four places to stay. Among them,
the elegant Furnace Creek Inn ($260–$400 double) is a beautifully
restored 1930s desert oasis with a formal dining room (% 760-786-
2361; www.furnacecreekresort.com). For camping information
and reservations, call % 800-365-2267 (http://reservations.
nps.gov).
 For more information: Contact the Death Valley National Park
Service (% 760-786-3200; www.nps.gov/deva). Admission to the
park is $20 per car and is good for seven days; keep your stub.
Gathering More Information

S
an Diego is California’s grown-up beach town. Year-round sunshine,
postcard-perfect beaches, vibrant Spanish-Mexican heritage, and
three fantastic family-oriented attractions (four, if you count LEGOLAND
in nearby Carlsbad) make an appealing combination, especially for fami-
lies and anyone with a kidlike sensibility and a need to kick back. In fact,
count on one or more of the city’s animal-themed fun spots — the San
Diego Zoo, SeaWorld, and the Wild Animal Park — to be at the top of
your sightseeing agenda.
Little more than an overgrown Navy base just a few decades ago, San
Diego still feels more provincial than some might like, but that’s part of
its appeal. An influx of new residents has forced San Diego to start keep-
ing up with culinary styles and cultural trends. Though some insist it’s
the next South Beach (with a much, much nicer climate, might we add),
it’s still not exactly bright lights/big city. The most radical changes thus
far have taken place throughout the Gaslamp Quarter (heck, even the
Hard Rock has a super-hip condo-hotel underway on Sixth) and are radi-
ating north with Mission Beach and Pacific Beach glamming things up a
wee bit.
The astonishing growth rate threatens to bring Los Angeles–style ills
(traffic, noise, pollution) into the oasis best known for squeaky-clean
fun. Still, the easygoing pace and sunny beach-town optimism here
remains worlds apart from L.A.’s congestion and commitment to trends
and appearance.

bet. Average daytime highs range seasonally from 65°F to 78°F, with
nighttime lows between 46°F and 66°F. The sun shines all year-round,
except (believe it or not) in June and July, when ocean fog rolls in during
the wee morning hours and burns off slowly, sometimes not until mid-
afternoon. A puny 91⁄2 inches of rain falls annually, primarily between
mid-December and mid-April.
Summer means crowds of people on the sand, in the restaurants, at the
major attractions, and occupying hotel rooms reserved months before.
The best time to visit is in the fall — September through early December —
when the crowds have vanished, winter snowbirds are still months away,
and the possibility of rain is nearly nil. You can still comfortably bare it all
at the beach through October. No matter when you visit, though, pack a
swimsuit because “freak” warm weather (often in Nov or Jan) is common.
The few weeks between Thanksgiving and mid-January constitute the
city’s only bona fide low season, in time for lucky holiday travelers.
If you’re a fan of music, food, and chaos, you may want to venture out
early to mid-August for Street Scene (www.street-scene.com). This 
20-plus-year-old tradition recently moved from the cordoned-off-for-the-
event Gaslamp Quarter to just outside of Qualcomm Stadium and brings
with it lots of stages showcasing a diverse array of just-emerging to well-
known artists, the Taste of San Diego, and a number of minifestivals.
Disappointingly, this has turned what was a charming street festival into
something less distinguishable from any number of other outdoor rock-
stadium festivals. If this seems like more of an irritant than a bonus, stay
far, far away from Qualcomm during this time.
You’ll likely want to spend two to four nights in town, depending on your
sightseeing goals (which are governed, mainly, by how many animal
parks you want to visit). You can get acquainted with the rest of the city
in just a couple of days.
Getting There
As a top destination, San Diego is accessible by plane and train, as well
as by automobile. So take your pick.
By plane
San Diego International Airport (% 619-231-7361; www.san.org),
locally known as Lindbergh Field, is right on the water on Harbor Drive,
just 3 miles from downtown. Most of the major domestic carriers fly into

the airport, and all the major car-rental agencies maintain offices at the
airport.
Chances are very good you’ll want to have a rental car (for more on driv-
ing in San Diego, see the “Getting Around” section later in the chapter). If
not, taxis line up outside the airport and charge around $12 (plus tip) to
take you downtown.
 To reach downtown from the airport, take Harbor Drive south to
Broadway, the main east–west thoroughfare, and turn left.
 To reach Hillcrest or Balboa Park, exit the airport toward I-5 and
follow the signs for Laurel Street.
 To reach Mission Bay (home of SeaWorld), take I-5 north to 
I-8 west.
 To reach La Jolla, take I-5 north to the La Jolla Parkway exit, turn-
ing onto Torrey Pines Road.
If you’re the plan-ahead type and would prefer to arrange for shuttle
service, contact Cloud 9 (% 800-9-SHUTTLE or 858-9-SHUTTLE; www.
cloud9shuttle.com). Expect to pay $11 to $13 for downtown and
Hillcrest and $29 to La Jolla (quoted rates are for the first person; addi-
tional members of your party pay less).
San Diego hotels commonly offer airport shuttle service — usually 
free, sometimes for a nominal charge — so ask before you make other
arrangements. Make sure the hotel knows when you’re arriving and get
precise directions on where they’ll pick you up.
By car
I-5 is the route from Los Angeles, Anaheim, and coastal points north. The
drive is about 120 miles, or two hours flat, from L.A., and 97 miles from
Disneyland.
I-15 leads from inland destinations and the deserts to the north. As you
enter San Diego, take I-8 west to reach the main parts of the city. From
Palm Springs, take I-10 west to Highway 60, then I-215 south to I-15
south. The distance is 141 miles, about two and a half hours.
I-8 cuts across California from points east such as Phoenix, crossing I-5
and ending at Mission Bay.
By train
Amtrak (% 800-872-7245; www.amtrak.com) trains arrive at Santa Fe
Station, 1050 Kettner Blvd. (at Broadway), within walking distance of
many downtown hotels and 11⁄2 blocks from the Embarcadero (water-
front). Taxis line up out front, the trolley station is across the street, and
a dozen local bus routes stop on Broadway or Pacific Highway, a block
away.

Orienting Yourself
Thinking of San Diego without envisioning the water is impossible. You’ll
probably never be more than 5 miles from the bay while in San Diego,
and you may never even lose sight of the blue Pacific.
The bay is San Diego Bay — not to be confused with Mission Bay, which
is a protected body of water, fed by the sea but isolated from it by thin
strips of land. Mission Bay is north of San Diego Bay. The airport lies
between the bays, a stone’s throw from most city neighborhoods.
The neighborhoods are well-defined by the undulating geography of
foothills, shallow canyons, and coastline: Downtown grew up on the
waterfront, wrapping around San Diego’s huge natural bay, which
brought in crucial shipping commerce and, later, the influential U.S.
Navy presence. Downtown, the historic Gaslamp Quarter sits several
blocks inland from the bayfront Embarcadero, and the uptown neighbor-
hood of Hillcrest has prime bay views from about a mile away.
Almost — but not quite — an island, Coronado lies smack-dab in the
middle of San Diego Bay. The communities of Ocean Beach, Mission
Beach, and Pacific Beach — as their names imply — sit directly on the
water, up the coast from the city proper, with La Jolla (la hoy-ya) occupy-
ing its own hilly peninsula at the northernmost edge.
You’ll probably spend freeway drive time on I-5, which runs through 
San Diego north-south, jogging a bit around downtown before it leads
straight to the border. East-west I-8 passes above Hillcrest and Old Town
on its way to Mission Bay.
Here’s a quick rundown of what you can expect in San Diego’s main
neighborhoods (see the “San Diego’s Neighborhoods” map on p. 486).
Downtown
You’ll probably be directed early on to the original downtown (see the
map, “Downtown San Diego”), especially the commercial Gaslamp
Quarter. With the spring 2004 introduction of retro Petco Park, home to
Major League Baseball’s San Diego Padres, this area is undergoing an
extreme makeover of its own. Its new-and-improved personality is rede-
fined every few months as more and more businesses open their doors.
Once known as a raunchy red-light district, the Quarter — loosely
bounded by Broadway, Island Avenue, and First and Fifth avenues — now
boasts splendid late-19th- and early-20th-century buildings housing trendy
restaurants and upscale nightspots. It really vibrates on weekends and
game nights when folks come to hang out in the bars and cafes. (And, by
the way, the gas lamps have been converted to electricity. Dang.)
Along Harbor Drive between Ash and Market streets is the Embarcadero,
San Diego’s waterfront, with hotels, attractions, and plenty of activity,

from commercial fishing to a busy cruise-ship terminal, as well as home-
port for the Star of India, the world’s oldest seafaring ship.
North of the downtown core (between downtown and the airport), Little
Italy is quickly gaining a reputation as the art and interior-design region
recognized as TADD (The Art and Design District). It stretches along
India and Columbia streets and Kettner Boulevard between Cedar and
Kalmia streets. And yes, it still boasts the best pizza and cannoli in town!
Hillcrest
San Diego’s early elite rode home in horse-drawn carriages to uptown
neighborhoods with nicknames such as “Banker’s Hill” and “Pill Hill”
(the doctors’ ’hood). Preservation-minded residents, including an active
and fashionable gay community, have restored Hillcrest’s charms after
years of neglect. It’s now our favorite part of the basic city of San Diego
(see the “Hillcrest/Uptown” map on p. 490). Think of Hillcrest as the
local equivalent of L.A.’s West Hollywood or New York’s SoHo. Loosely
bounded by Washington and Hawthorn streets to the north and south,
deep, hilly ravines to the west, and Sixth Avenue at the east, Hillcrest
stretches along the edge of San Diego’s green jewel, Balboa Park (see the
“Balboa Park” section later in the chapter).
Old Town
Its official name is Old Town State Historic Park and it’s closed to ve-
hicular traffic. Nestled into a wedge north of the airport where the I-5
and I-8 freeways intersect (see the “Old Town” map on p. 491), the com-
pact, Spanish-era core of San Diego is a genuine historic area that has
been bastardized by commercialism. It’s the equivalent of L.A.’s Olvera
Street, so you may appreciate the opportunity to experience the vestige
of history that remains. The interactive and educational aspects have
been steadily improving (making it a decent place to bring kids), and
you may enjoy the history lesson and the notable 19th-century build-
ings. The shopping is kitschy but fun and pretty much avoidable unless
you’re prowling for souvenirs, but even locals come here for Mexican
food.
Coronado
Located in the middle of San Diego Bay west of downtown, the “island”
of Coronado is actually a peninsula, best known for the landmark Hotel
Del Coronado, the Victorian grand dame most famous for its costarring
role — alongside Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon, and Tony Curtis — in
Some Like It Hot. Coronado is home to the U.S. Naval Air Station, a village
of pretty cottages, charming shops along Orange Avenue, and a lovely
duned beach. It’s sleepy and completely adorable, and walking the gold-
glitter beaches (it must be pyrite) is a pleasure. You can reach it from
the “mainland” via the soaring Coronado Bay Bridge, a thrilling span to
drive.

Mission Bay
This labyrinth of protected waterways may look artificial, but Mission
Bay is really a natural saltwater bay that selective dredging has
enhanced for use as an aquatic playground. Condos, cottages, and a few
choice hotels line the shore, along with paved paths for joggers, in-line
skaters, and bicyclists. SeaWorld is located on prime bayfront property.
The bay, bounded on the south and east by the San Diego River and I-5,
is separated from the ocean by a narrow strip of land known as Mission
Beach, a funky community of artists, free spirits, and surfers. This is a
great place to stay if you want to be close to both the beach and down-
town’s attractions (see the map, “Mission Bay and the Beaches”).
Pacific Beach
Looking for superlative dining or sophisticated culture? Then don’t
come to Pacific Beach. This water-hugging neighborhood north of
Mission Bay is laid-back to the extreme, featuring acres of family-friendly
beach and dozens of casual pub-style restaurants where, with a few
exceptions, the cuisine takes a back seat to the sunset view (and happy-
hour discounts). Ocean Front Walk is a paved promenade featuring an
eye-popping human parade akin to L.A.’s Venice Ocean Front Walk. This
is another great place to stay for easy access to both the beach and
downtown.
La Jolla
Both chic and conservative, this wealthy Rodeo Drive–meets–the
Mediterranean community is surrounded by beach and boasts outstand-
ing restaurants and pricey shopping in “the village.” The scenic spot that
appears on most postcards is stunning La Jolla Cove. The cliffs above
the cove hold grassy Ellen Browning Scripps Park, a perfect spot for
picnicking.
Chapter 27: San Diego 489
The duchess from Coronado
From 1917 to 1921, a woman named Wallis Spencer lived in San Diego, primarily on
the peninsula of Coronado, and was a well-known social figure about town. Eventually,
Wallis divorced her husband, married a man named Simpson, and moved to England,
where she once more became a well-known social figure around town and, eventu-
ally, the girlfriend of the then Prince of Wales. The prince later became King Edward
VIII, but gave up his throne to marry her. Yes, the eventual Duchess of Windsor was a
local, for a time (her friends placed a $75 transatlantic call to her when the royal scan-
dal hit), and you can stay in her former house, which is now part of the Hotel Del
Coronado property. Just imagine, if she had stayed put on Coronado, how different
things may have been: no Diana, no Fergie, and, when the Queen Mum died, just a
simple paragraph about the death of a long-lived, minor royal.

On the down side, La Jolla is insulated from most of San Diego, because
it’s at the northernmost edge of the city with no convenient freeway
access. In rush hour, getting from the village to I-5 can take half an hour,
plus a ten-minute drive to downtown. This makes La Jolla a poor base if
you’re planning to hop in the car every morning for far-flung sightseeing,
but ideal for experiencing the “California Riviera” vibe that this jewel is
known for. If you choose to stay elsewhere, La Jolla is worth an after-
noon and evening for window-shopping and excellent dining. To reach
Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla’s main artery, take I-5 north to La Jolla
Parkway, or I-5 south to La Jolla Village Drive.
Getting Around
Chances are good that you’ll want to have a car in San Diego. The city 
is pretty spread out, but it’s one of California’s easiest cities to drive.
Streets are clearly marked (and often in grids, but beware of the many

one-way streets), and traffic is relatively light except for brief morning
and evening rush hours. Although the public-transit system isn’t as
worthless as L.A.’s, it’s not as comprehensive as San Francisco’s.
Driving is a nuisance in certain areas, most notably the Gaslamp Quarter,
Pacific Beach, and La Jolla. When you visit these spots, park your car on
the street or in a parking garage and walk, instead. If you stay in one of
these neighborhoods and don’t plan to venture much beyond it other
than where public transportation can take you efficiently, you can easily
make do without a car. But if you want to explore more of the city or
visit the Wild Animal Park or LEGOLAND, mass transit will leave you in
the lurch.
If you’re planning to do without wheels, consult a map and pick your
hotel carefully so that you won’t feel stranded.
Tips for driving and parking
Pay careful attention to freeway exits, because the names can differ from
one direction to the other. For example, to reach La Jolla, you take La
Jolla Parkway from I-5 north, but La Jolla Village Drive from I-5 south.
Finding a place to stow a car is pretty easy in San Diego, but it may
strain your supply of small change. Parking meters are plentiful in most
areas: Posted signs indicate operating hours — generally between 8 a.m.
and 6 p.m., even on weekends — and most meters accept only quarters.
In the Gaslamp Quarter, where parking is ridiculously scarce, consider
parking in Horton Plaza’s garage (G Street and Fourth Avenue), which is
free to shoppers (with validation) for the first three hours.
Spaces are elusive in downtown La Jolla, because street parking is free
and public lots are scarce.
By bus and by trolley
The San Diego Metropolitan Transit System or MTS (% 619-685-4900
or 619-233-3004; www.sdcommute.com) operates city buses and trolleys.
The terrific San Diego Trolley system runs bright-red trains south to the
Mexican border (a 40-minute trip) and north to Old Town and Mission
Valley, a sprawling slice of suburbia with mega shopping centers, and
the trolleys can help you avoid the nasty parking situation at Petco Park.
Within the city, trolleys stop at many popular locations, and the fare is
$1.50 for one station, $1.75 for two, $2 for three stations, and $2.25 for
four to ten stops; the fare to the Mexican border (the San Ysidro stop) is
$2.50. Children younger than 5 ride free; seniors and riders with disabili-
ties pay $1 for all rides.
Trolleys operate on a self-service fare-collection system; purchase your
ticket from machines in the station before boarding. Trains run every 
Chapter 27: San Diego 493

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
494
15 minutes during the day, every half-hour at night. Trolleys generally
operate daily from 5 a.m. to about 12:30 a.m.
Unfortunately, the trolleys don’t come close to covering the entire city. If
they go where you’re going, hooray! If not, take the bus.
Rectangular blue signs mark bus stops at every other block or so on
local routes. Most fares range from $1.75 to $4, depending on the dis-
tance and type of service (local or express). Exact change is required 
($1 bills are accepted). Get a transfer from the driver when boarding.
For recorded MTS information, call % 619-685-4900. To talk to a real
person, call % 619-233-3004 daily between 5:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m.
Because the MTS controls both the buses and trolleys, they do a pretty
good job of providing you with information on using them in conjunc-
tion. The Transit Store, 102 Broadway, at First Avenue (% 619-234-
1060), is a complete information center, supplying passes, tokens,
timetables, and maps. The store is open weekdays from 8:30 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from noon to 4 p.m.
The Day-Tripper pass allows unlimited rides on the public-transit
system (buses and trolleys). Passes are good for one, two, three, and
four consecutive days, and cost $5, $9, $12, and $15, respectively. You
can get Day-Tripper passes from the Transit Store, online, and at all 
trolley-station ticket vending machines.
Some hotels offer complimentary shuttles to popular shopping and/or
dining areas around town. Check to see whether yours does.
By taxi
Taxis don’t cruise the streets, so call ahead for quick pickup. If you’re at a
hotel or restaurant, the front-desk attendant or maitre d’ will call for you.
Among the local companies are Orange Cab (% 619-291-3333), San
Diego Cab (% 619-226-TAXI), and Yellow Cab (% 619-234-6161).
Ferry on over to Coronado
The pedestrian-only Coronado Ferry (% 619-234-4111) is a charming
way to get a quickie harbor cruise, and a boon if you’re concerned about
fighting street traffic on crowded summer weekends. It leaves from the
Broadway Pier on the Embarcadero (at the foot of Broadway) every
hour; the one-way fare is $3 per person. The ferry docks at Coronado’s
Ferry Landing Marketplace.
Where to Stay in San Diego
The San Diego lodging scene has multiple personalities. Downtown
hotels cater to conventions and baseball games, so they tend to have
reduced weekend rates when the Padres are on the road or during the

Chapter 27: San Diego 495
off-season. Seaside hotels, on the other hand, sometimes offer deals mid-
week, and always have lower prices after summer ends. We’ve noticed
that many of the hotels in older buildings seem to have the sorts of
problems you would encounter in similar places in Europe — they’re
often dark and creaky, and the plumbing can be unreliable. This holds
true even for some very-high-end hotels in older buildings, so if you
require brand-spanking-new, stay at a newer facility.
If you’re planning to visit between Memorial Day and Labor Day, make
your reservations several months in advance, especially if you want a
hotel on the beach.
Some people worry about air-conditioning in hotels, but San Diego’s
cooling ocean breezes make that a minor concern. Still, if you’re visiting
between July and September and are particularly sensitive, ask about
air-conditioning when booking. And just in case your trip involves a bit
of business as well, almost all downtown and Gaslamp hotels feature
complimentary high-speed Internet access.
Count on an extra 10.5 percent in taxes being tacked on to your hotel
bill.
Blue Sea Lodge
$$–$$$$$
Pacific Beach
What it lacks in glamour, the Blue Sea Lodge more than makes up for in
location and price. This active Best Western with center-stage pool is lit-
erally steps from the Pacific Beach sands. Most rooms sport at least a par-
tial ocean view while the beachfront digs have full water views and LCD
TVs. The in-room microwaves and minifridges in conjunction with the
close proximity of a few little grocery stores also counts as a plus.

Gaslamp Quarter
If you want to enjoy the contemporary ambience of the W but just don’t
have the dough, this is the perfect alternative. Fun and funky, with hallway
carpets reminiscent of Alice and her travels through Wonderland, 
the recently remodeled, colorful rooms have the modern creature com-
forts you want, including mighty-plush robes and CD players for relaxed
lounging.

Catamaran Resort Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Pacific Beach
Lush palm groves and night-lit tiki torches amplify the Polynesian theme
at this large, activity-oriented bayfront resort — imagine Gilligan’s Island
with in-room coffeemakers and poolside cocktails. Tower rooms offer the
best views, while the low-rise rooms feel the most resortlike. In keeping
up with the development that seems to have taken over San Diego, the
Catamaran opened a shiny new spa that some insist is a marked improve-
ment over the Cannibal Bar that used to reside in its space. After dark, the
Pacific Beach party scene is just a couple of blocks away.

go west on Grand Avenue, then 4 blocks south on Mission Boulevard. Parking: Self-
parking $11, valet parking $14. Rack rates: $185–$595 double. Rates often drop based
on occupancy; packages are also available, such as the B&B deal, which includes
breakfast and room tax for as little as $139 per night. AE, DC, DISC, MC, V.
Crystal Pier Hotel
$$$$–$$$$$
Pacific Beach
Built on an ocean pier, these 26 wooden cottages (circa 1936, but recently
renovated) are San Diego’s most unusual lodgings. Like tiny vacation
homes, they’re as darling as can be and book up fast for summer. Each has
a private patio, living room, bedroom, full kitchen, and breathtaking sunset
views. Beach gear is available for rent, but BYO beach towels — though
plenty of boardwalk vendors carry pretty towels that are also relatively
cheap.

night minimum stay). DISC, MC, V.
Empress Hotel
$$–$$$
La Jolla
Located in La Jolla Village, this former residence hotel is a more affordable
La Jolla alternative to La Valencia or Lodge at Torrey Pines. Although fairly
standard, the recently renovated rooms are spacious and nicely appointed
with snuggly bathrobes, in-room Starbucks, a couple of water bottles, and
comfy beds. Fresh cookies welcome afternoon guests, and a continental
breakfast is served daily on the terrace.

Gaslamp Plaza Suites
$$
Gaslamp Quarter
As San Diego’s skyline keeps extending upward, don’t forget that this
former office building was San Diego’s very first skyscraper. This 60-room
boutique hotel is not without its quirks: It’s impeccably restored, complete
with exquisite period detail (wood, marble, etched glass, brass) in the
public areas, but the rooms are puzzlingly done in a mock-Regency style
with Asian art prints — and to make things even more confusing, each is
named after a prominent literary figure. Some standard rooms are better
lit than the one-bedroom suites, although the higher-priced suites are
better yet again. The cheapest rooms are too tiny for anyone with personal-
space issues. The complimentary breakfast is surprisingly generous. All in
all, if this were a Euro-pension-type hotel, we might cut it more slack.

Old Town
At this Best Western all-suite hotel perched above Old Town, walkways
thread through attractive courtyards bearing a rustic Mexican Colonial
ambience. This hotel is tops in its price range, with extensive in-room
amenities, tons of on-site services including a pool and fitness area, and
plenty of fun ’n’ food within easy walking distance.

coffee bar, and high-speed Internet access, as well as a fitness center open

prisingly reasonable and good. For a few extra bucks, go for a loft or suite

ing with blond hardwood walkways. Pretty snazzy, we must say.

Holiday Inn on the Bay
$$$–$$$$
Downtown
Sprawling along the Embarcadero, this predictable but appealing and well-
maintained chain hotel offers 600 rooms in a variety of buildings; choose
the tower for cool bay or city views. Airport-convenient, the hotel boasts
a bevy of on-site dining options and swimming pools, plus the restaurants
and recreation of the bay boardwalk across the street, making families
happy as clams.

Horton Grand
$$$–$$$$
Gaslamp Quarter
Two historic hotels (one a former brothel) were linked to form this likable
facility just steps from hot nightlife. Each of the Victorian rooms is indi-
vidually decorated with period furniture and comes complete with a gas
fireplace and pull-chain toilet, while the suites have full-fledged kitch-
enettes. We recommend going for a room with a courtyard balcony,
because the view is lovely. If you have an affinity for the supernatural,
you’ll appreciate this: Rumor has it, the Horton Grand has friendly spirits
roaming the grounds — most notably in room no. 309 (book really early if
this is where you want to spend Halloween).

Hotel del Coronado
$$$$–$$$$$
Coronado
This grand old seaside Victorian is our favorite place to stay in San Diego.
Opened in 1888, it’s loaded with personality and storybook architecture.
You can see the landmark red turrets from miles away — and you may rec-
ognize them when you do, because the hotel had a supporting role in the
classic movie Some Like It Hot (it stood in for the Miami resort where most
of the shenanigans took place). Rooms range from compact to extravagant.

Chapter 27: San Diego 499
Those in the original building overflow with antique charm and perfectly
modern appointments (we prefer those), while Ocean Towers rooms sport
a contemporary look. Views vary; ocean views go for more money, but
parking-lot views are actually of a stretch of the island and not half bad. 
A pristine white-sand beach (glittering with pyrite gold dust) awaits, along
with swimming pools, tennis courts, day-spa facilities, nice dining facili-
ties, and a worthwhile guided tour. Service is superb, with staff catering to
any need or whim. At Christmastime, the hotel is festooned with thou-
sands of tiny white lights that can be seen from miles around. We love it
and would stay here forever.

Hotel Solamar
$$$$–$$$$$
Gaslamp Quarter
An emphasis on nautical art and local artists, coupled with the perfect
blend of style, warmth, and attitude, grants the Solamar everything it
could possibly need to be au courant without resorting to pretense. Even
the staff is helpful, attentive, and unassuming. Intriguing and inviting, the
urban beach house aesthetics are permeated with an air of romance that
manages to embrace the family travelers as well. Home to the Kimpton
hotel’s wine hour from 5 to 6 p.m. daily, the lobby’s living room is divided
into a library and a fireplace-centric conversation area, which take their
warm glow from chandeliers comprised of platforms of softly lit candles.
The airy guest rooms feature a chocolate and aqua palette, plush beds,
animal-print robes, rich mahoganies, and the kind of spalike, Italian-glass-
tiled bathroom you’d want in your own home (really, it looks like a Kohler
ad). For extra luxury, go for a Spa King room with the Fuji-soak tub and
separate shower. You must have a drink or two at Jbar — and lobby level
dining at Jsix is a bonus!

This remarkable value is conveniently located near downtown attractions
and draws folks who seek out economy without compromise (that is, no
youth hostels). Though not large, guest rooms make the most of their
space and feature minimalist modern furniture that’s durable without look-
ing cheap. Extras include fridges and microwaves, plus Little Italy shop-
ping and dining just outside. Ask for a city or bay view; the nearby train
tracks may bother you if you’re an extra-light sleeper, but most guests
never even notice the noise.

La Valencia Hotel
$$$$$
La Jolla
Within its bougainvillea-draped walls and wrought-iron garden gates, this
clifftop bastion of gentility has been La Jolla’s crown jewel since it opened
in 1926. Although the bathrooms can be smallish, every fabric and fur-
nishing is of the finest quality, and the service is exceptional. The hotel
overlooks La Jolla Cove and features the clubby Whaling Bar, heady with
expensive Scotch. Long a hideaway for Hollywood celebs, its colorful
dome was used as a civil-defense lookout during World War II.

Lodge at Torrey Pines
$$$$$
La Jolla
At the northernmost tip of La Jolla is this breathtaking (really, truly, no lie)
escape from reality. What is it about Craftsman architecture that is just so
dreamy? The rooms feature custom-designed furniture, 300-thread-count
sheets, fabrics and carpets featuring William Morris–style designs, and
bath products infused with local botanicals crafted specifically for the
hotel. As if the five-diamond establishment isn’t enough on its own, it over-
looks the 18th hole of the famed Torrey Pines Golf Course (host of the 2008
U.S. Open) and the ocean. Also in the vicinity is the Torrey Pines State
Reserve, which offers miles of trails for hikers, environmentalists, and
anyone that simply wants to enjoy some serenity. And we haven’t even
mentioned the dining or spa. In a word, spectacular, and worth a peek even
if you can’t stay.

Marina District (Gaslamp Adjacent)
The two towers of the Grand Manchester Hyatt, the largest hotel in

Loma, and beyond, and are connected by a seriously fancy lobby. Along the
Embarcadero and set apart from the downtown hustle and bustle, the tra-

Old Town
This is a basic but sweet motel, so don’t expect much from the rooms,
although they are clean. The Spanish-style public areas are unexpectedly
nice, however, and the pool will only get better as the landscaping
matures. Grounds are well kept, TVs have HBO, and it’s conveniently
located across the street from access to the Old Town Historical District
and the trolley to the rest of the city. Yes, it sits on a busy highway, sur-
rounded by industrial blech, but with the low rates, plus AAA discounts
galore, you’re hard-pressed to do better if you’re on a budget.

Gaslamp Quarter
Although the contemporary Petco-friendly Omni couldn’t be more wel-

beautiful pool, Gaslamp location, and kid-welcoming features make it a
rather alluring family and vacation destination as well. If you’re a Padres
ticket holder you must take advantage of the hotel’s sky bridge that takes
guests over Tony Gwynn Way (aka Seventh Street) and directly into the
park — with in-and-out privileges. And for those without tickets, the
awfully pretty and plush rooms, a number of which look directly into the
park, come stocked with peanuts and Cracker Jacks.

Mission Bay
Situated on its own island in Mission Bay, this complex is as much a theme

can have so much fun at this resort that you may never want to leave. With
so many activities for the younger set, even parents can enjoy their vaca-
tion. Single-story duplex bungalows dot 44 acres of tropical gardens and
swim-friendly beaches. All have private patios (many facing duck-filled
lagoons) and plenty of thoughtful conveniences. Recent renovations kept
the low-tech ’60s charm but lost the tacky holdovers; rooms now sport

Downtown
This place is downright cool, and yet, surprisingly friendly. Although the
word hip is overused and sounds rather dated, its nuance perfectly coin-
cides with these nifty digs. White down comforters and inviting robes mark
the breezy blue rooms that are filled with a ton of creature comforts, not
to mention fancy-label amenities. The second-floor Beach bar is named not
for the ocean’s proximity, but for the sand dunes in which your toes
mingle, and the lobby’s Living Room, featuring upscale beverages and
house music, has the trendsetters (in San Diego, who’d’a thunk it?) flock-
ing on weekend nights. Rice, the hotel’s signature restaurant, serves up an
eclectic mix of global contemporary cuisine and features a bourbon–
brown sugar cured salmon appetizer. Yum!

Where to Dine in San Diego
So far, San Diego doesn’t compete with New York or San Francisco on the
culinary playing field, but its growing sophistication has sparked a new
spirit of experimentation and style. There are many little cafes in the
Gaslamp and especially in the Hillcrest districts, and you may well 
consider taking a chance on any one of them.

You’ve gotta love any eatery whose only sister restaurant is in Florence,

whichever you prefer. That fun fact aside, the food here is wonderfully
authentic and quite tasty, too. If you’re a gnocchi person, you cannot miss
the Topini al Radicchio Rosso, which combines potato dumplings with the
restaurant’s house tomato sauce, Italian red cabbage, mascarpone, and
Parmesan. With an outdoor patio merely steps from Petco Park, it’s defi-
nitely worth checking out before or after a game.

Convention-al accommodations
Many a traveler ventures to San Diego with one destination in mind: the Convention
Center. Situated between the Embarcadero and the train tracks, the center is merely
steps from great lodging and a few extra feet beyond that from the Gaslamp Quarter.
Super-light sleepers take note: Though the disruptions are few and far between, every
now and again sleeping quarters this close to the Convention Center are also privy to
the rumbles and the whistles of passing trains.

BREAKFAST/LUNCH
From the street, this little breakfast and lunch spot looks like any 
other little spot within a cool, contemporary facade until you notice the
people — lots of people — lining up to enjoy chef/owner Terryl Gavre’s
lusciously creative menu in which she has mastered the art of creating
foods rich with subtle flavors. From the Pumpkin Waffle and Eggs Italia to
the Posole (a rich, spicy chicken stew) and Caesar salad, every morsel is
crafted in-house. And yes, that was Terryl on Food Nation with Bobby Flay
demonstrating her peanut-butter-and-banana-stuffed French toast. By the
way, the nifty coffee cup and spoon chandeliers were designed and built
by Gavre because she ran out of money when she was building the restau-
rant 15 years ago and had to send back the light fixtures.
There’s Mexican, Mexican, and 
also Mexican
Yep, those are pretty much your dining choices when you come to Old Town. What’s
more, we have to point out that it’s all largely predictable Southern California Mexican.
Which is fine — many a homesick expat Californian dreams of exactly the sort of meals
offered here. It is said that each restaurant and shop within the Plaza del Pasado (for-
merly the Bazaar del Mundo) represents a particular period of time in history — the
Mexican Period (1821–46), the Transitional Period (1846–56), or the American Period
(1856–72). We can’t quite say that we were able to distinguish the differences, how-
ever locals have favorites they swear by. We think you can pretty much just pick the
one with the shortest line or the nicest courtyard. Most are open daily for lunch and
dinner from 10 a.m. or so until closing. Among your options are Casa De Reyes repre-
senting the Mexican Period (% 619-220-5040), the Transitional Period Jolly Boy 
(% 619-291-3200), and Cosmopolitan Hotel and Restaurant, formerly Casa de Bandini,
2754 Calhoun St. (% 619-209-3525), defining the American Period with, amongst other
things, a mighty delish carnitas salad. Outside of the Plaza, Old Town Mexican Café,
2489 San Diego Ave. (% 619-297-4330), tends to be rather popular.

SPANISH
It’s a Spanish restaurant! It’s a tapas bar! It’s a nightclub! It’s all of these and

fuse together to form a fun space that feeds its guests with myriad won-
derful flavors. To experience it all, order a bunch of different tapas, because
a few of these tasty little Spanish appetizers can make a full meal. Don’t
forget the sangria! A lively atmosphere in the tapas bar makes for a good
time, but if you’re interested in hearing what your dinner companions have
to say, try the dining room, then salsa the night away downstairs.

incher could feed three — unless those are three football players!), making
this one of the best meal deals in town. They roast their own beef and
turkey, and pile the cold cuts high in any combination you like. We suggest
trying a house specialty, like the Slaw B. Joe (shredded roast beef, pro-
volone, coleslaw, and Russian dressing) or the Bobby (turkey, stuffing,
cranberry sauce — it’s like Thanksgiving on a roll!). Perfect for a picnic or

Solana Beach
ECLECTIC
An easy jump off the freeway on your way to or from San Diego, and prob-
ably worth the short drive from the city, this modern, gaily decorated
establishment has a number of curious, clever dishes, but our favorite is
the shrimp dumplings, served in a port-wine butter sauce that will have
you calling for more of the good house bread to soak it up. Fresh fish
dishes dominate the menu, from lobster tacos to grilled mahimahi, but car-
nivores will be happy to discover that the burger comes on a fluffy roll and
is stuffed with herb butter. Note that lunchtime sandwiches can be ordered
at dinner even though they aren’t on the menu.

Mission Hills
ECLECTIC
Named for the mythical line on which, geographically, you find Morocco,
Japan, India, and yes, San Diego, this is a delightfully sophisticated but not
intimidating little place just a few blocks away from the Hillcrest district.
On a recent trip, we started with b’stilla (the Moroccan dish of chicken,
sugar, and cinnamon wrapped in phyllo) and a wonderful salad dressed
with preserved lemon vinaigrette. From there, we had pan-seared halibut
with a yellow tomato coulis (perfect), salmon with a roasted-sesame crust
on braised veggies (even better), and an Asian duck breast and five-spice
sauce (the best of all). Desserts are made with style and care (do try the
vanilla-rose ice cream, a special Middle Eastern treat).

Primavera Ristorante

Coronado
ITALIAN
This is one of a number of cute little cafes and restaurants on Coronado,
especially along the main drag heading to and from the Hotel Del. It’s a 
popular place for dinner, a cheaper nice-night-out option than some of the
hotel dining rooms, with fresh fish and pasta entrees (we prefer the latter;
simpler seems to be more successful here). It’s classy, but not over-
whelmingly so, and most friendly. Next door is its pastry cafe, which,
despite the Italian name, emphasizes French pastries — come here to get
your éclair fix.

Local-surfer-made-good Ralph Rubio brought home the simple recipe
common to Mexican fishing villages — batter-dipped, deep-fried fish fillets
folded in corn tortillas and garnished with shredded cabbage, salsa, and
tangy white sauce — and launched the you-can’t-eat-just-one Baja-fish
tacos craze. Wash ’em down with an ice-cold something. Locations are all

Sushi Bar Kazumi
$$–$$$
Hillcrest
JAPANESE
If you don’t come early to this tiny cafe, you may have to battle locals for a
seat. The owner and his son oversee the sushi bar; the former is so dedi-
cated that he gets visibly pained when asked to make some silly roll. Why
put him through that when you can have this master sushi chef (who serves
only fish that meets his exacting standards) or his lovely, knowledgeable
son, choose your fish for you? You may end up trying Japanese snapper, sea
urchin, or giant clam. If raw fish isn’t your game, try one of their regular
meals, reminiscent of what you would find in corner diners all over Japan.

ITALIAN/MEDITERRANEAN
Enjoy the Italian Mediterranean ambience of this romantic restaurant,
where diners are encouraged to relax and linger over such rich dishes as
the lobster pot pie, which features 1⁄2-pound Maine lobster tail, carrots,

organic corn, asparagus, potatoes, and green beans all nestled together
under a pastry puff crown. The menu always has plenty of secondi (second
courses) of meat and fish, as well, and every pasta dish is available in an
appetizer portion (how considerate!). The wine list is a perennial Wine
Spectator award-winner.

Zenbu
$$–$$$$
La Jolla
JAPANESE
Though it would seem to be simply a place for locals, with its minimall set-
ting and all, Zenbu has San Diegans schlepping from all across the county.
Why? Well, first and foremost the fish, prepared to the nines in such silly-
named rolls as the Johnny and the Jackie Chan, is amazingly fresh. In fact,
the owner commissions the fish farming himself to get the freshest catch —
and whatever doesn’t come in from his own boats, he handpicks from the
best purveyors. And it’s not just the formerly finned that spawns greatness
here as the mere thought of their Wasabi-Seared Tenderloin inspires a
Pavlovian response. Somebody hand us a napkin — and another round of
Saketinis, please. By the way, it also happens to be awfully hip and cool
inside with its contemporary Japanese atmosphere.

Catch a wave — before you 
even hit the sand!
Fun with or without the family is easy to be had at the Wave House (www.wave
house.com) in Mission Beach. Tom Lochtefeld, one of the masterminds behind
Raging Waters (the water park made famous by Bill and Ted) has created something
even more ingenious: A wave machine! Not one of those funky little desk jobbies —
we’re talking two grand-scale replicas of the real thing! Extreme-sports enthusiasts
and novices alike enjoy taking their turns on the Bruticus Maximus (where 800 horse-
power come together to create the perfect 10-foot barreling wave) and the (tamer)
FlowRider, respectively. Beyond the technology, there are also outdoor kava bars,
yummy food, open-air barbeques, a fire ring, hammocks, tropical palms, and an adja-
cent fitness center. Bring the kids to the Wave House during the week, but you may
want to leave them home on the weekends as the more adult kids roll in to party hearty.
As if the Wave House isn’t enough on its own, it’s surrounded by the 7-acre Belmont
Park (www.belmontpark.com), the historic amusement park complete with a big,
ol’ wooden roller coaster, carnival rides and games, cotton candy, an Olympic-size
swimming pool, souvenir vendors, and everything else you’d expect at the boardwalk.

Exploring San Diego
What do San Diego and central Florida have in common? They both fea-
ture big-name family attractions, the spend-all-day kinds of places
around which you’re probably planning your stay. This section contains
everything you need to know about them, plus suggestions for filling any
free time after you’re done.
The “Big Four” — the animal and theme parks
Each of these parks can eat up at least half a day — a lot more if you
have kids.
San Diego’s main family attractions have joined forces, offering combo
ticket deals that reward you with big savings for taking on what we like
to call the Vacation Endurance Challenge. Here’s how it works: You get to
visit both the San Diego Zoo and Wild Animal Park (deluxe zoo pack-
age, Wild Animal Park admission) for $54 adults and $34 for kids 3 to 11.
The two-park ticket includes one visit to each attraction, which you
must use within five days of purchase.
What’s that? You say you want more? Add SeaWorld to your plans with a
three-park ticket (deluxe zoo package, Wild Animal Park admission, and
SeaWorld admission) for $100 adults, $77 kids 3 to 11. With this one, you
get unlimited use at all three parks for five days from date of purchase —
wow! If you’re feeling really ambitious and want to hit LEGOLAND, too,
the four-park ticket runs for $163 adults and $122 kids 3 to 11. Deals
change often, so check with the parks.
Note also that many hotels in the area offer advance tickets for all the
parks at a discount, as well as other deals that include trolley rides,
harbor cruises, and the like.
SeaWorld
One of the best-promoted attractions in California, this 165-acre aquatic
playground is a showplace for marine life, made politically correct with an
only nominally “educational” atmosphere that we wish the park took fur-
ther. At its heart, it’s a (genuinely) fun-filled family entertainment center
with performing dolphins, otters, sea lions, walruses, and seals. Several
successive 4-ton black-and-white killer whales have functioned as the
park’s mascot, Shamu.
The hands-on area called Shamu’s Happy Harbor encourages kids to play
and get wet. One of the newer attractions is Journey To Atlantis, a “water”
coaster with a six-story plunge and lots of special effects, as well as a

Chapter 27: San Diego 513
130,000-gallon Commerson’s dolphin pool — the only public exhibit of
these rare dolphins in the Western Hemisphere. Shows for short attention
spans run continuously throughout the day, and you can rotate through
the various theaters; best is the silly, plot-driven sea-lions-go-to-Gilligan’s-
Island show. Other draws include Wild Arctic, an extremely cool virtual-
reality trip to the frozen North, complete with polar bears, beluga whales,
walruses, and harbor seals, that’s well worth making time for; and Shamu
Close Up, where you can watch the whales in their off hours through
underwater windows while keepers explain what you’re seeing. If that’s
not close enough for you, see if you can make a reservation to dine with
Shamu (a buffet meal served next to his enclosure where you can eye him
and his trainers while you dine).
See map p. 486. 500 Sea World Dr., Mission Bay. % 619-226-3901. www.sea

West Mission Bay Drive exit to Sea World Drive. Admission: $54 adults, $44 kids 3–9.
Plenty of Web site and AAA deals are to be had so do your homework before you go.
Open: Hours vary dramatically by season and by day — again, check the Web site.
San Diego Zoo
More than 4,000 animals reside at this world-famous zoo, founded in 1916.
Even if other zoos have caught up to it in terms of animal awareness in the
intervening century, this granddaddy is still highly respected in the field.
Every new exhibit features an even more high-tech method for simulating
the climate, flora, and other conditions of the residents’ natural habitat,
and the preservation of endangered species is a primary concern. It also
happens to be a whole lot of fun.
The 1996 loan of two magnificent giant pandas from the People’s Republic
of China brought the zoo more attention than ever, and in 1999, Bai Yun
and Shi Shi became the parents of Hua Mei, an adorable baby panda who’s
quite an achievement of reproductive research (pandas rarely conceive in
captivity). Shi Shi and Hua Mei have since returned to China, but in August
2003, Bai Yun gave birth to the lovable Mei Sheng who had been conceived
naturally with the zoo’s latest import, Gao Gao. Born in August 2005, 
Su Lin is the current big baby draw. The pandas are the big attention-
getters — and deservedly so — but the zoo contains many other rare and
exotic species, with the cuddly koalas drawing the next biggest crowds.
The zoo offers two types of bus tours: a 35-minute guided tour and an
on/off bus ticket you can use throughout the day. Both provide a narrated
overview and allow you to see 75 percent of the park. We strongly encour-
age first-timers, especially parents with young kids, to spend the extra few
bucks on the bus, because the zoo covers a lot of acreage, much of it ter-
raced and extremely hilly. You can then use your energy to revisit the crea-
tures that you like best, and to see those not covered on the tour, such as
the pandas. Even by starting with the bus tour, you’ll have a hard time vis-
iting everything in the course of a long day, so wear your most comfortable
sneakers. Come extra-early or later in the afternoon and plan on spending
the evening in summer, because the animals tend to hibernate in the heat
of day. And don’t miss the hippos — if you get lucky, you’ll see them frol-
icking, which is a sight to behold.

San Diego Wild Animal Park
Originally begun as a breeding facility for the San Diego Zoo, the San
Diego Wild Animal Park (WAP) now holds around 3,200 animals — many
endangered species — all roaming freely over the park’s 1,800 acres.
Approximately 650 baby animals are born every year in the park.
The real beauty of the park is that you, not the animals, are the caged ones.
The park has a network of paths (with catchy but meaningless names like
“Kilimanjaro Safari Walk” and “Heart of Africa”) that skirt many of the
enclosures. Only glass separates you from the cats in Lion Camp, the
park’s new naturalistic exhibit that immerses visitors within the lion
pride’s territory — you arrive in a Range Rover, and the lions are less than
20 feet away, just hanging out.
The best way to see the animals, however, is by riding the Wgasa Bush
Line Railway (aka the tram), which is included in the admission price; for
the best views, sit on the right-hand side. During the 50-minute ride, you’ll
pass through vast landscapes resembling Africa and Asia. Trains leave
every 20 minutes from the station in Nairobi Village, the commercial hub
of the park, which has souvenir stores and refreshment vendors. (The food
is mediocre and overpriced, so think about smuggling in your own snacks.)
Otherwise, Nairobi Village is not much more than a small, traditional zoo
whose best feature is the nursery area, with irresistible young’uns frol-
icking, being bottle-fed, and sleeping.
If you really want to experience the vast landscape and large animals that
make the WAP so special, take a photo caravan tour ($90–$130 per person,
plus park admission). The photo-taking is secondary — for us, anyway —
to the enjoyment of crossing the fence to meet rhinos, ostriches, zebras,
deer, and giraffes on their home turf. You can even feed the giraffes along
the way — an amazing experience. Advance reservations are recom-
mended.
See map p. 486. 15500 San Pasqual Valley Rd., Escondido (30 miles northeast of San
Diego). % 760-747-8702. www.sandiegozoo.org/wap/index.html. To get
there: I-15 north to Via Rancho Parkway; follow signs for about 3 miles. Admission:
$29 adults 12 and over, $18 kids 3–11, free for kids under 3. Open: Daily 9 a.m.–4 p.m.
(grounds close at 5 p.m.); extended hours in summer and Dec.
LEGOLAND
Opened in 1999, this Euro-infused theme park is the ultimate monument
to the world’s most famous plastic building blocks. Three other enor-
mously successful LEGOLANDs exist, in Germany, Denmark, and England,
but this is the only one in America.

Chapter 27: San Diego 515
The 2006 introduction of Pirate Shores — four new fun water-play attrac-
tions consisting of a pirate ride equipped with water cannons designed to
drench your friends and family in battle, a miniflume log ride, and two
water-play structures — invites guests to don sunscreen, bathing suits,
flip-flops and a “heck with it all, let’s have some fun” attitude. Little kids,
big kids, and parents alike can be seen cavorting and running for cover in
this awfully damp section of the park. Do yourself a favor and bring a
change of clothes and towels for any member of your crew who’ll be 
partaking — and if you want to stay dry, stay far, far away.
Although the majority of rides (short on duration and thrills) and other
playgrounds are strictly for kiddies or older kids who actually get a kick
out of hanging with their younger sibs, the addition of minicoasters such
as the Dragon and the LEGO Technic Test Track as well as Pirate Shores
have been major turning points in entertaining the over-10 set. Still, the
admission price is hefty for what you get. Most rides average a height min-
imum of 34 to 36 inches — some go as high as 40 to 42 inches — and, boy,
are they strict. One nifty touch is that many of the ride queues feature play
areas where the younger set may indulge in Legomania while the parents
wait in line — much, much better than restraining a squirmy 2-year-old!
The single best part, scale models of international landmarks (the Eiffel
Tower, Sydney Opera House, and so on, all constructed out of real LEGO
bricks), will appeal to grown-ups who don’t mind just looking at stuff.
Although the official guidelines imply that the park is geared toward chil-
dren of all ages, if you’re traveling with a bunch of ’tweens who pride them-
selves on their newfound coolness, be forewarned that they may very well
find it a snooze. Still, with its fresh and yummy (although not inexpensive)
food, LEGOLAND is a lovely place for parents to relax while the kiddies get
tuckered out.
See map p. 486. 1 Lego Dr., Carlsbad (30 miles north of San Diego). % 877-534-6526
or 760-918-5346. www.legolandca.com. To get there: I-5 north to Cannon Road
exit east, following signs for Lego Drive. Admission: $57 adults, $44 kids 3–12 and
seniors but check the Web site for AAA discounts and other specials. Preferred park-
ing for Volvos. (We aren’t kidding.) Open: Winter and off-season Mon, Thurs–Sun 
10 a.m.–5 p.m.; summer and holidays daily with extended hours.
Balboa Park
Balboa Park is one of San Diego’s must-see attractions. Not only does it
house the world-famous San Diego Zoo (see the preceding section), but
this 1,200-acre verdant wonderland — which bills itself as the largest
urban cultural park in the country — serves as the cultural and recrea-
tional heart of the city. Spanish-Moorish buildings originally built for the
1915 Panama-California Exposition house most of the city’s museums, sur-
rounded by a series of cultivated gardens, small forests, tropical oases,
and shaded groves coaxed from a formerly scruffy brown canyon. Lest it
all sound too refined for you, the park boasts ample places to play, as well
(see the “Balboa Park Attractions” map, p. 516).

Balboa Park Attractions

Balboa Park lies at the northern edge of downtown, bordered on the
west by Sixth Avenue. From downtown, 12th Avenue leads directly in,
becoming Park Boulevard and passing the entrance to the zoo. From
Sixth Avenue, Laurel Street becomes El Prado, the park’s main thorough-
fare; many of the park’s major museums, along with the visitor center,
are lined up along this avenue. The park contains plenty of parking lots,
although you may not have your first choice on busy days. That’s all
right, though, because walking from place to place is part of the fun.
Distances are easily manageable, but if the hills start to dog you, hop
aboard the free trams that run regularly through the park. (The one
exception to the distance rule is the zoo. It sits far enough away that
you’ll want to use its parking lot.)
Sure, San Diego has other museums in town, but because you have lim-
ited time (not to mention limited patience), make sightseeing easy on
everyone by choosing from among the park’s 14-plus museums, which
offer more museum fix than you’ll need in the course of your visit. The
best of the bunch are described in this section; for a complete list of
park attractions, go to www.balboapark.org or, after you arrive, pick
up a map at the well-staffed Balboa Park Visitors Center, 1549 El Prado
(% 619-239-0512). Note, however, that many park attractions are closed
on Mondays.
In the courtyard behind the center you’ll find the Prado (% 619-557-
9441), an upscale Nuevo Latino restaurant set within the historic walls
of the House of Hospitality. If you’d prefer something lower on the food
chain price-wise, snack bars and casual cafes are scattered throughout
the park.
All the park’s museums are free one Tuesday each month. The museums
participate on a rotating schedule so that three or more waive their
entrance fees every Tuesday. If you plan to visit more than three of the
park’s museums, buy the Passport to Balboa Park, a coupon booklet that
allows one entrance to each of 11 museums that charge an entry fee (the
others are always free) and is valid for one week. You can purchase the
$30 passport at any participating museum, the visitor center, or online.
Museum of Photographic Arts
If names such as Ansel Adams, Margaret Bourke-White, Imogen Cunning-
ham, Edward Weston, and Henri Cartier-Bresson pique your interest, don’t
miss this 3,600-plus image collection, one of the few in the United States
devoted exclusively to photography. Set aside an hour or two.
See map p. 516. 1649 El Prado. % 619-238-7559. www.mopa.org. Admission: $6
adults; $4 students, seniors, active military; free for kids under 12 (with adult). Free
second Tues of the month. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m. (until 9 p.m. on Thurs).
Reuben H. Fleet Science Center
A must-see for kids of any age — yep, including grown-up kids — this 
tantalizing collection of hands-on exhibits is designed to provoke the 
Chapter 27: San Diego 517

imagination while teaching scientific principles. Although we don’t see the
educational element in Comet Impact, a motion-simulation adventure that
resembles Disneyland’s Star Tours ride, it is quite fun. The Fleet also
houses a 76-foot domed OMNIMAX theater, an excellent place to experi-
ence larger-than-life IMAX films. You’ll need one and a half to three hours
to explore all the exhibits, not counting IMAX movie time.
See map p. 516. 1875 El Prado. % 619-238-1233. www.rhfleet.org. Admission
(includes IMAX film, Deep Sea ride, and exhibit galleries): $15 adults, $13 seniors,
$12 kids 3–12; free first Tues of the month. Open: Daily at 9:30 a.m.; closing varies by
day and season.
San Diego Air & Space Museum
The number-two kid-pleaser in town (after the Fleet Science Center — see
the preceding entry), this enormously popular museum provides an
overview of national and local aviation history, from hot-air balloons to
the space age, with plenty of biplanes and fighters in between. In 1935, the
Ford Motor Company built the stunning cylindrical hall, which houses an
imaginative gift shop with goodies such as freeze-dried astronaut ice
cream. Plan on spending one and a half to two and a half hours.
See map p. 516. 2001 Pan American Plaza. % 619-234-8291. www.aerospace

6 or for active duty members of the military. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–4:30 p.m., until 
5:30 p.m. in the summer.
San Diego Automotive Museum
Even if you don’t know a distributor from a dipstick, you’ll ooh and aah
over the classic, antique, and exotic cars here. Every one is in such pris-
tine condition you’d swear it just rolled off the line, from the 1886 Benz to
the 1981 DeLorean. You can easily see the collection in a little over an hour.

Tues of the month. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
San Diego Model Railroad Museum
It may not be high culture as we know it, but this museum is cool and cute,
and well worth 30 to 60 minutes of your time, even if you don’t consider
yourself a train buff. Six permanent, scale-model railroads depict Southern
California’s transportation history and terrain with an astounding atten-
tion to detail. Kids will love the hands-on Lionel trains, and visitors of all
ages will appreciate the interactive multimedia element.

San Diego Museum of Art
With one of the grandest entrances along El Prado, this museum also
boasts outstanding collections of Italian Renaissance and Dutch and
Spanish baroque art, along with an impressive collection of Toulouse-
Lautrec’s works. The museum often shows prestigious traveling exhibits,
and the interactive computer image system allows you to locate highlights
and custom-design a tour. Plan on spending one to three hours here.
See map p. 516. 1450 El Prado. % 619-232-7931. www.sdmart.com. Admission: $10
adults, $8 seniors, $7 students with ID, $4 kids 6–17. Free third Tues of the month.
Open: Tues–Sun 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (until 9 p.m. on Thurs).
Other attractions to consider in Balboa Park include the following:
 Along El Prado, just beyond the Lily Pond, is the Botanical
Building, a 250-foot-long wooden lath conservatory from the 1915
Exposition that looks like something out of a Victorian costume
drama and houses about 1,200 tropical and flowering plants.
Admission is free.
 The largest outdoor pipe organ in the world is at Spreckels Organ
Pavilion, south of El Prado (% 619-702-8138; www.sosorgan.com),
an ornate, curved amphitheater offering free Sunday concerts at 
2 p.m. year-round and free evening concerts in July and August.
Scanning the winter seas for whales
Whale-watching is a hugely popular pastime between mid-December and mid-March.
California gray whales hug the shore on their annual migration from Alaskan feeding
grounds to breeding lagoons in Mexico — and back again, with calves in tow. If you’ve
ever been lucky enough to spot one of these gentle behemoths, you understand the
thrill.
 Grab binoculars and head to Cabrillo National Monument (% 619-557-5450;
www.nps.gov/cabr) on Point Loma, where an elevated, glassed-in observatory
offers a prime vantage point. Take I-5 or I-8 to Highway 209/Rosecrans Street and
follow signs to the monument; admission is $5 per car or $3 per person on foot.
It’s open from 9 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.
 On the UCSD campus in La Jolla, the outdoor plaza at the Birch Aquarium at
Scripps Institution of Oceanography (% 858-534-3474; www.aquarium.ucsd.
edu) offers an excellent whale-watching perch. Take I-5 to La Jolla Village Drive,
go west for a mile (past Torrey Pines Road), and turn left at Expedition Way.
 If you want to get a closer look, head out to sea with Classic Sailing Adventures
(% 800-659-0141 or 619-224-0800; www.classicsailingadventures.com).
Four-hour expeditions (one each in morning and afternoon) cost $65.

The sound is stupendous, and the whole experience serves to
amplify (pun intended) the old-fashioned Sunday-in-the-park qual-
ity of your visit.
 The Japanese Friendship Garden (% 619-232-2721; www.niwa.org;
open Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m., Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–4 p.m), adjacent to the
organ pavilion, is a serene, meticulous oasis. From the elaborately
carved gate, a crooked path (to confound evil spirits, who move only
in a straight line) threads its way past nearly 100 carefully arranged
plantings, a stream with colorful koi, and a traditional zen garden.
Admission is $3 for adults, $2.50 for seniors, $2 for students and mili-
tary with ID, free for kids younger than 7.
Old Town State Historic Park
Whether you’re a history buff looking for an authentic slice of early
California or a hungry theme-park refugee in search of a Mexican combo
plate and a cheesy souvenir, chances are very good that you’ll end up in
Old Town — and you should.
The birthplace of San Diego — indeed, of California — Old Town was
founded by Spanish friars in 1769, along with Mission San Diego. The
town of San Diego grew up around the mission and its military presidio,
which thrived here until the early 1870s. After San Diego’s commercial
core moved closer to the harbor (to “New Town,” now the Gaslamp
Quarter), Old Town was abandoned. In 1968, the park was established to
preserve the structures that remained and rebuild several atop their
original foundations. As the years have gone by, sensitivity to historical
accuracy has improved greatly, making the park a combination of
Disneyesque attractions and eerily authentic sites.
If you can get past the touristy veneer and into the true spirit of this
pedestrian-only 6-block historic district, you’ll step back to a time of
one-room schoolhouses and village greens, when the people who lived,
worked, and played here spoke Spanish. Depending on your interest
level — whether you want only to cover the main points of interest or
see everything and have lunch — you can spend anywhere from one to
five hours here.
Old Town is bounded by Congress, Juan, Wallace, and Twiggs streets. To
get there: Take I-5 to Old Town Avenue exit; parking is free in the many
lots scattered around the park’s perimeter, and the large lot for Old
Town’s trolley station (another option) holds more spaces, at the north-
west end. Admission is also free, although donations are encouraged.
Old Town is open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Stop first at the Robinson Rose Visitor Center, the visitor center for Old
Town State Park, on San Diego Avenue (% 619-220-5422), to get your
bearings, join up with a walking tour (daily at 11 a.m. with an additional
2 p.m. tour Sat–Sun), or simply check out the old wagons, carriages, and
stagecoaches. Other notable stops include

 La Casa de Estudillo, the 1827 adobe home of a wealthy family, fur-
nished with typical upper-class furniture of the period
 Robinson-Rose House, built in 1853 and containing a scale model
of Old Town the way it looked in 1872, before a fire destroyed much
of the district
 The San Diego Union Building, where a forerunner to today’s
Union-Tribune began publishing in 1868
 The reproduction Silvas-McCoy House, currently under construc-
tion as an interpretive visitor center for Old Town
One of Old Town’s top draws is its Mexican restaurants. See the “There’s
Mexican, Mexican, and also Mexican” sidebar, earlier in the chapter, for
our top recommendations. See the “Shopping at the Top” section, later
in the chapter, for the lowdown on Old Town shopping.
Hitting the beaches
San Diego’s justifiably famous beaches are its second-biggest visitor
draw (after the animal parks). Beach weather lasts virtually all year. 
Any sunny day is perfect for a walk, a little in-line skating, or a picnic.
Coronado Beach
If you’re spending any time on Coronado, don’t miss this wide, sparkling-
sand paradise of a beach, framed by the fabulous Hotel Del Coronado
and extending along Ocean Avenue up to grassy Sunset Park. It’s a flat,
benign beach (that can glitter with gold pyrite flakes) perfect for sun-
bathing, strolling, and wading. Street parking (some metered) is plentiful
even in summer, and the beach includes lifeguards, restrooms, and a
picnic area with a few fire rings. The islands visible from here — “Los
Coronados” — are 18 miles away and belong to Mexico.
Ocean Beach
This beach sits just across the channel from Mission Bay. To reach it,
take West Point Loma Boulevard all the way to the end. The northern
end of Ocean Beach Park is known as Dog Beach after the pooches that
frolic on the sand. Surfers generally congregate around Ocean Beach
Pier, mostly in the water but often at the snack shack on the end.
Riptides (dangerous currents) are strong here, so venturing in beyond
waist depth is not a good idea. Facilities include restrooms, showers,
picnic tables, and plenty of metered parking spots; the funky shops and
food stands of Newport Avenue are a couple blocks away.
Mission Beach and Pacific Beach
These neighbors along Mission Boulevard share a popular boardwalk:
Ocean Front Walk, a fun, free-for-all human parade. To the south,
Mission Beach features several dozen blocks of narrow but popular
sandy beach known for a youthful surf culture and beginner-friendly

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
522
waves. Grassy Belmont Park sits at midpoint (at West Mission Bay
Drive), offering rides and carnival-style entertainment.
Pacific Beach begins around Pacific Beach Drive, where the scene is
only slightly more sophisticated, and the surfers a little more experi-
enced. Waves break pretty far out, making this one of San Diego’s best
swimming beaches. One exception is Tourmaline Surfing Park, at the
northernmost end of Pacific Beach, where the sport’s old guard gathers
to ride the waves. Swimming is prohibited, but come to watch the 
masters in action.
You can find metered spots spaced along Mission Boulevard’s side
streets, and maybe even a few curbside spaces, if you’re lucky. Both
beaches have lifeguards and well-spaced restroom facilities.
Just east of Mission Beach is Mission Bay, whose labyrinth of calm
waters and pretty peninsulas are ideal for exploring. Check with Seaforth
Boat Rental, 1641 Quivera Rd. (% 619-223-1681; www.seaforthboat
rental.com), which offers half- and full-day rentals on powerboats, sail-
boats, personal watercraft (PWCs), motorized skiffs, kayaks, or paddle-
boats. If you don’t want to get your feet wet, bikes are available for rent
at the Marriott Hotel (% 619-234-1500, ext. 6535) for $12 to $30 an hour,
$30 to $50 a day. They also rent surreys starting at $20 an hour. You do
not have to be a guest to rent. Bike Tours San Diego (% 619-238-2444)
offers guided tours that vary in price depending on area covered; they
also just rent bikes (about $22–$35 per day). For in-line skates or tradi-
tional quads, Mission Beach Club, 704 Ventura Place, at Ocean Front
Walk (% 858-488-5050), can set you up with skates and all necessary
safety gear.
La Jolla Cove
This scenic jewel appears regularly on La Jolla postcards and is worth
the drive even if you’re staying closer to downtown. Framed by grass-
carpeted bluffs and sheltering a snorkel-friendly marine preserve just
below the surface, the cove is also a terrific spot for swimmers of all
abilities. It’s on the small side, so avoid peak summer weekends if you
can; the free parking spaces along Coast Boulevard tend to fill quickly, 
as well, but it’s an easy walk from anywhere in the village.
Many visitors never know about the seals that hang out about 4 blocks
south of La Jolla Cove at Children’s Pool Beach, a tiny cove originally
named for the toddlers who could safely frolic behind a man-made sea-
wall. These days, the sand is mostly off-limits to humans, who congre-
gate along the seawall railing or onshore to admire the protected seals
who sun themselves on the beach or on semi-submerged rocks. You can
get surprisingly close — truly a mesmerizing sight.

Chapter 27: San Diego 523
Taking a Guided Tour by Trolley 
(And Other Means)
Not to be confused with the public-transit trolley trains, the fully nar-
rated Old Town Trolley (% 619-298-8687) is a constant favorite. You
can get a comprehensive look at the city — or just the parts that interest
you — aboard the old-fashioned motorized trolley car as it follows a 
30-mile circular route. Hop off at any one of a dozen stops (ticket sales
reps are on hand at each), explore at leisure, and reboard when you
please (check ahead of time — their operating schedule is different from
day to day). Stops include the Embarcadero, Horton Plaza, Gaslamp
Quarter, Coronado, San Diego Zoo, Balboa Park, and Heritage Park. The
tour costs $30 for adults and $15 for kids 4 to 12 (free for kids 3 and
younger) for one complete loop, no matter how many times you hop 
on and off; if you get on and stay on, the ride takes about two hours.
The old soft shoe(s)
Many parts of San Diego are quite walkable. The following are places
that offer good walking tours:
 The Gaslamp Quarter Historical Foundation (% 619-233-4692;
www.gaslampquarter.org) offers two-hour tours of San Diego’s
liveliest neighborhood. Tours of the Gaslamp neighborhood depart
on Saturdays at 11 a.m. from the William Heath Davis House
Museum, 410 Island Ave., at Fourth Avenue. A $10 donation is
requested ($8 for seniors, military personnel, and students).
Private group tours of six or more can be arranged.
 The San Diego Natural History Museum Canyoneers (% 619-255-
0203; www.sdnhm.org/canyoneers) offer outdoor enthusiasts
interpretive nature walks. Follow volunteers who are trained to
teach appreciation of plants and animals in Southern California.
Check the Web site for schedules and locations.
 Coronado Touring (% 619-435-5993) is a great way to learn a ton
about charming Coronado. The 90-minute tour is upbeat and
informative, including a delicious dose of local scandal and gossip.
Tours leave at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from the
Glorietta Bay Inn, across the street from Hotel Del Coronado; the
price is $12. Reservations are suggested, because walk-ins are sub-
ject to availability.
Bay cruises
When the weather’s fine — which is most of the time — nothing says
“San Diego” like a little waterborne sightseeing. Hornblower Cruises
(% 800-668-4323 or 619-686-8715; www.hornblower.com) is the local
big cheese. In addition to one- and two-hour narrated tours of San Diego

Part V: The Southland Cities and the Desert 
524
Bay, the company offers evening dinner/dance cruises, Sunday brunch
cruises, and whale-watching trips in winter. Prices start at $17 for harbor
cruises, $45 for meal cruises; kids are half-price.
Shopping at the Top
If you like to do your shopping in a mall, head to Horton Plaza in the
Gaslamp Quarter, bounded by Broadway, First and Fourth avenues, and
G Street (% 619-239-8180; www.westfield.com). Although this multi-
level complex is rather whimsical, the stores are conventional. The quar-
ter is also known for its excellent art galleries, including Many Hands,
302 Island Ave. (% 619-557-8303; www.manyhandscraftgallery.com),
a cooperative with 35 artists working in a variety of crafts. Le Travel
Store, 745 Fourth Ave., between F and G streets (% 619-544-0005; www.
letravelstore.com), offers a good selection of luggage, travel books
and maps, and groovy travel accessories.
Depending on your tastes, you may think the Embarcadero’s Seaport
Village, 849 W. Harbor Dr. (% 619-235-4014; www.spvillage.com), is
quaintly appealing or completely contrived. This faux–New England–
style village is big for souvenir shopping and dining with a view. It’s
worth the trip, though, for a ride on the 1890 Looff carousel imported
from Coney Island, New York.
Hillcrest
Compact Hillcrest is an ideal shopping destination. You can browse a
unique and sometimes wacky mix of independent boutiques, book-
stores, vintage clothing stores, memorabilia shops, chain stores, bak-
eries, and cafes. Start at the neighborhood’s hub — the intersection of
University and Fifth avenues — and prepare yourself to drop a few dol-
lars on parking (either meters or lots). Shops here tend to stay open
later than in other parts of the city, and Tuesday nights, many local mer-
chants offer 15 percent off all purchases.
Highlights include Babette Schwartz, 421 University Ave. (% 619-220-
7048; www.babette.com), a provocative pop-culture emporium named
for a local drag queen. The Village Hat Shop, 3821 Fourth Ave. (% 619-
683-5533; www.villagehatshop.com), features headgear from straw
hats to knit caps to classy fedoras, plus a minimuseum of vintage 
headwear.
If you love used and rare books, you’ll want to poke around on Fifth
Avenue between University and Robinson. This block is also home to 
Off the Record, 2912 University Ave. (% 619-298-4755), a new-and-used
record store with an alternative bent and the city’s best vinyl selection.
If vintage clothing is your passion, don’t miss Wear It Again Sam, 3823
Fifth Ave. (% 619-299-0185), a classy step back in time.

Chapter 27: San Diego 525
Old Town
Yes, it’s touristy (the local shopkeeper’s motto is “ka-ching!”), but when
you’re looking for a classic souvenir of the cheesy variety — you know,
San Diego–labeled T-shirts, baseball caps, snow domes, or those mov-
able pens — this is the place to go. Milking the “old” even further, many
of these shops boast a quasi-historic general-store theme. Look for
artist’s workshops and bona fide galleries tucked away from the com-
mercialism, where higher quality commands higher prices.
With mariachi music and Mexican archways setting the stage for import
shops with wares from Central and South America, colorful Plaza del
Pasado, 2754 Calhoun St. (% 619-297-3100; www.plazadelpasado.
com), is a magnet. You won’t find anything rare (or bargain-priced), but
browsing can be fun.
La Jolla
Shopping is a major pastime here. Women’s clothing boutiques tend to
be conservative and costly, especially those lining Girard and Prospect
streets. The many home-décor stores make for great window shopping,
as do the ubiquitous jewelers — where Swiss watches, tennis bracelets,
precious gems, and pearl necklaces sparkle in windows on every street.
Affordable, trendy, boutiquish looking clothes, however, can be found at
Pink Zone, 7880 Girard Ave. (% 858-456-2508), where the friendly staff
can help whip up the perfect disposable outfit. Pink Zone has locations
in Pacific Beach and Gaslamp, too.

If you’re a collectibles hound, this enormous antiques mall is guaranteed to leave you
with dusty hands and a lighter wallet: Cracker Factory Antiques, 448 W. Market St., at
Columbia Street, downtown (% 619-233-1669). Merchandise ranges from kitschy 
collectibles to “real” antiques (you know, Louis the Whichever stuff).

Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; tickets are available day-of-show only
(except for Sun and Mon shows, sold on Sat). They do not take credit
cards. Call % 619-497-5000 for more information and the daily offerings,
or go online to www.sandiegoperforms.com and click on “Arts Tix.”
Parking tip: The Horton Plaza garage is most convenient, and Arts Tix
will validate.
The play’s the thing
It’s well worth making the effort to catch a show at the Shakespearean-
style Old Globe Theatre or its adjacent theaters, the open-air Lowell
Davies Festival Theater and the intimate in-the-round Cassius Carter
Centre Stage. Not only do these venues occupy a magical setting within
lovely Balboa Park, but they attract expertly cast classics along with
thought-provoking regional and experimental offerings. The season runs
from January through October, with two to four plays going at any one
time. Ticket prices range from around $23 to $59, with discounts for stu-
dents and seniors. Call % 619-239-2255 or the 24-hour hotline at % 619-
234-5623, or go online to www.oldglobe.org.
The La Jolla Playhouse, on the University of California–San Diego
(UCSD) campus at 2910 La Jolla Village Dr., at Torrey Pines Road 
(% 858-550-1010; www.lajollaplayhouse.com), stages six produc-
tions each year, usually from April or May through November. Each one
has something outstanding to recommend it, whether a nationally
acclaimed director or a highly touted revival. Tickets range from $28 to
$57. Any unsold tickets are available for $15 in a “public rush” sale ten
minutes before the curtain goes up.

Don’t have time for Vegas? 
Reservations recommended!
Have you noticed all of those casino billboards scattered around town? Have you also
noticed that the majority of these establishments have Native American names
attached to them? California allows Las Vegas–style gambling on Native reservations
throughout the state. The casino rules vary slightly from those in Nevada, but the
stakes are just as fun!
Barona Resort and Casino (% 619-443-2300; www.barona.com) and Harrah’s
Rincon Casino & Resort (% 760-751-3100; www.harrahs.com) are attracting more
and more folks daily. Less than an hour from downtown, local favorite Pala Casino
Resort and Spa (% 877-946-7252 or 760-510-2189; www.palacasino.com) consis-
tently raises the proverbial bar because it’s so darned nice — the hefty caliber of
entertainers who take its stage isn’t hurting it either.

Cover charges and/or ticket prices vary widely for these hot spots, so
it’s best to call ahead to find out details — you’re going to want to call
ahead anyway to find out who’s playing.
Belly Up
Another reason to head north to Solana Beach is the still-going-strong-
after-over-30-years Belly Up, perhaps San Diego’s best live venue, with acts
ranging from locals to terrific out-of-towners, from rock to roots to regular
Sunday-night salsa.

The Casbah
It may be a total dive, but this blaring downtown club has a well-earned
rep for showcasing alternative and rock bands that are, were, or will be
famous. Consider buying advance tickets to avoid disappointment.

Croce’s Nightclubs
This loud, crowded gathering place is the cornerstone of the Gaslamp
Quarter nightlife. Two separate clubs a couple doors apart offer traditional
jazz (Croce’s Jazz Bar) and rhythm and blues (Croce’s Top Hat) nightly.
The music blares onto the street, making it easy to decide whether to go
in or not. The cover is waived if you eat at the restaurant (see the “Where

Dizzy’s
This no-frills performance space focuses on one thing and one thing only:
showcasing talented jazz musicians. There is no alcohol, no smoking patio,
and though they generally have cold water and soda for the price of a
donation, music lovers are welcome to bring in snacks and drinks from
local proprietors like PJ’s Coffee & Tea Co. (at the corner of Fifth and K)
who serves up an eye-opening cup o’ joe and tasty treats. No age limit.

fortable. The genre is no genre; everyone from B.B. King to Dokken to local-
girl-made-good Jewel has performed here (recently, James Brown, Rollins

Altitude
On the 22nd floor of San Diego Marriott Gaslamp Quarter is this sublime

California. Hot music, elegant surroundings, a view right into Petco, and
two full bars keep partiers lining up at the street level elevators. If you
want to keep the vibe going, the beautifully furnished hotel features chic
retro rooms reminiscent of Lucy and Ricky’s Hollywood travels, ultracomfy

Nunu’s Cocktail Lounge
This is a perfect neighborhood place, provided you and your neighbors
are more the cocktail-lounge hipster types. (We mean all this as a positive
thing.) Though neither snooty nor tony — although someone sure paid
attention to the details here — it’s both increasingly fashionable (in terms
of popularity — in terms of décor, it’s over the top in its efforts to please
all tastes). All things considered, it’s just the right place to stick $5 in the
jukebox and drink through your selections. They’re noted for their

Chapter 27: San Diego 531
A side trip to Tijuana
Tijuana (tee-wah-nah), the fourth largest city in Mexico, lies just half an hour south of
San Diego. If you asked us, of course, we wouldn’t go there on a bet. And yet, we would
tell you to go. Why? Well, for starters, you’ve never been, and at all times, we’re in
favor of new experiences, to say nothing of any opportunity to cross any border. It’s just
that Tijuana is hardly the best that Mexico has to offer, and it’s hardly the most authen-
tic Mexican experience. It’s a tourist trap of mass-produced crafts, knockoffs, and
other dubious goods, and in between, there is mucho drinking going on (it’s a sacred
destination for rowdy frat boys). But it’s an experience, to be sure, and easy to be had.
Getting to Tijuana from San Diego is simple and inexpensive, but beware: The crossing
at the border takes longer and longer. Driving is also a bad idea because of the 
following:
 U.S. auto insurance, as well as many rental-car agreements, isn’t valid across the
border.
 Traffic is terrible in Tijuana.
 Getting through customs and back across the border can be more difficult if you’re
on your own.
 Having an accident in Mexico, major or minor, is a bad idea.
Note: Although a passport won’t be required of U.S. citizens traveling overland from
Mexico until January 1, 2008, carrying yours will speed up your return across the
border. Be sure to at least have your driver’s license handy.
Leave your car behind instead and hop aboard the San Diego Trolley (% 619-685-4900
or 619-233-3004; www.sdcommute.com), nicknamed the “Tijuana Trolley” for good
reason. Get off at the last stop in San Ysidro. From there, just follow the signs to walk
across the border. The one-way fare for the 40-minute trip is $2.50, and the trolleys run
constantly, with the last return from San Ysidro after midnight. On Saturday nights (or
should we say Sun mornings) there are two or three trolleys that run between mid-
night and 5 a.m. — because the schedule changes frequently, call and confirm as after
a night in Tijuana, the trolley stop is probably the last place you want to hang out. Or
leave your car at one of many border parking lots, which cost $8 to $10 for the day.
Most lots are just a block or two away from the pedestrian walkway into Tijuana.
Exercise caution, especially after dark, and don’t be one of the last cars left.
After you’re in Tijuana, getting around by walking or taking a taxi is easy. Tijuana’s main
event is bustling Avenida Revolucion, the city’s original bawdy center for illicit fun.
Changing times and civic improvement have toned it down a bit; shopping and drink-
ing are now the main order of business. If a marketplace atmosphere and bargaining
are what you’re looking for, head to Mercado de Artesanias (Crafts Market), at Calle
2 and Avenida Negrete, where vendors of pottery, clayware, and other crafts fill an
entire block.
Before you go, get information and maps from Baja California Tourism Information,
7860 Mission Center Court #202, in Mission Valley (% 800-522-1516, 800-225-2786, or

ness. In Chapter 28, you discover where you can get down

Chapter 28
The Ten Wackiest 
Annual Events
In This Chapter
 Having a one-of-a-kind California experience
 Jumping frogs, racing worms, and building sandcastles
 Celebrating garlic, showing weeds, telling tales — all the doo-dah-day
C
alifornia, in case you haven’t heard, can be a kooky place. After all,
strangeness is one of the Left Coast’s most appealing qualities. The
yearly festivities listed in this chapter — which hold their own on the
annual statewide calendar next to such respected traditions as the
Tournament of Roses Parade and the Monterey Jazz Festival — throw
reserve to the wind and allow you to join in the nutty fun. Or you’re wel-
come to just point and hoot from the sidelines, if you prefer.
Peg Leg Smith’s Liars Contest
This tall-tale-telling competition (held the Sat nearest to April Fool’s Day,
of course) is the legacy of wooden-limbed yarn-spinner Thomas Long
“Peg Leg” Smith, who, in 1829 or thereabouts (dates tended to be some-
what fluid in Peg Leg’s world), found a few gold-specked rocks in the
desert. Rather than actually looking for more, Peg Leg spent the next 35
years weaving an increasingly Bunyan-like tale about his lost Borrego
Springs gold mine into Old West legend.
Storytellers and listeners make the trek to Borrego Springs in San Diego
County. The annual gathering at the Peg Leg Monument in Anza Borrego
Desert State Park honors Peg Leg’s chutzpah. You’re welcome to join the
fun around the campfire and just listen or do some spinning yourself, as
long as your tale has something to do with gold mining in the Southwest,
doesn’t last longer than five minutes, and contains nothing that any rea-
sonable listener may actually mistake for the truth.
For details, contact the Borrego Springs Chamber of Commerce
(% 800-559-5524 or 760-767-5555; www.borregosprings.org).

Calaveras County Fair and 
Jumping Frog Jubilee
Inspired by Mark Twain’s joyful short story “The Celebrated Jumping
Frog of Calaveras County,” this yearly competition (held the third week-
end in May) is the Olympics of frog jumping. Really. Frog jockeys (yep,
that’s what they’re called) converge on Angels Camp in California’s Gold
Country from all over the globe with their lean-’n’-mean amphibians in
tow, competing for cash prizes as large as 5,000 smackeroos. The races
are a hoot, and the accompanying three days of festivities — including
the crowning of Miss Calaveras (a human teenage beauty, not a frog) —
are festive and fun. If you and your leaper dream of riches and glory,
however, start training now: The current world frog-jumping record is 
21 feet, 53⁄4 inches, set in 1986 by Rosie the Ribiter of Santa Clara. Sadly,
the Pacific red-legged frog immortalized in Twain’s story (which is what
got his career, er, hopping) is an endangered species. Contact the
Calaveras County Fairgrounds (% 209-736-2561; www.frogtown.org).
Ferndale Cross-Country 
Kinetic Sculpture Race
One of the country’s coolest annual events is this ingenious race. Each
Memorial Day weekend, wild and crazy people in wild and crazy people-
powered sculptures race for three days and 38 miles across land, sand,
and sea, from Arcata to the Victorian-cute town of Ferndale, in the
Redwood Country’s Humboldt County.
The mobile art must be entirely people powered, must measure no more
than 8 by 14 feet, and cannot be inherently dangerous to driver or spec-
tator. Otherwise, anything goes and usually does; in the 30-plus-year his-
tory of the race, contraptions have ranged from giant watermelons to
amphibious armadillos. For more information, call % 707-845-1717 or
visit www.kineticsculpturerace.org.
International Worm Races
Launched in 1966 by a descendant of Mark Twain, this hugely popular
event wins first prize for sheer ridiculousness. The “race” track is a 
4-foot-square board with a 2-foot target painted on it. Two to five 
worms — either night crawlers or reds — are placed on the bull’s-eye,
and the first to inch its way across the edge of the outer circle wins. The
day’s grand champion wins a $500 cash prize (which begs the question,
what do worms do with money, anyway?).
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
536

The ultimate worm-on-worm challenge takes place at Redbud Park in
Clearlake (north of Napa Valley) immediately following the annual Lions
Club Fourth of July Parade. Don’t have your own red worm or night
crawler to enter? No problem! You can rent fully trained worms from the
worm “stable” (whatever that is) just prior to race time. Call % 707-994-
3600 for details and entry forms or visit www.clearlakechamber.com/
wr.html.
Gilroy Garlic Festival
The city of Gilroy (east of Santa Cruz and south of San Jose) proclaims
itself the Garlic Capital of the World and celebrates its cash crop with
this ultrastinky food fest. This is one of the biggest, best, and most well-
attended food festivals in the entire Golden State, ideal for garlic addicts
(and you know whether you are). In addition to garlicky eats from all
over the culinary map — garlic ice cream, yum! — the late-July festival
features arts-and-crafts vendors, live bands, the Miss Gilroy Garlic pag-
eant (a dubious honor if ever there were one), and a mouthwash table
(just kidding). Attention, cooks: Enter the Great Garlic Cook-Off, and you
could go home a thousand bucks richer. Call % 408-842-1625 or visit
www.gilroygarlicfestival.com for further details.
Pageant of the Masters
Think The Last Supper was too flat, the Mona Lisa too stiff, The Blue Boy
a tad too, well, two-dimensional? Then this is the event for you. Watch
master artworks spring to life in this truly bizarre yet awe-inspiring 
performance-art gala, first launched in artsy Laguna Beach in 1932 and
going strong ever since. This serious affair (it runs through most of July
and Aug) features trained actors working on intricate artist-designed
sets to create living, breathing tableaux that remain remarkably faithful
to the original, with dramatic narration and full orchestral accompani-
ment in a lovely alfresco setting. This pageant is fantastic, in the truest
sense of the word.
You can, and should, order your pageant tickets way in advance by call-
ing % 800-487-3378 or 949-497-6582. Come early in the day so you can
also enjoy the Festival of the Arts, an outdoor art show featuring first-
rate artists working in all media. You can find additional details on the
excellent Web site (www.foapom.com).
U.S. Open Sandcastle Competition
What’s more fun than sandcastles? Nothing — especially when they’re
astoundingly complex, larger-than-life sand sculptures of everything
Chapter 28: The Ten Wackiest Annual Events 537

from Noah’s Ark to lobsters (complete with melted butter- and lemon-
shaped sand on the side) to scenes from the San Diego skyline. This
world-class competition in Imperial Beach (south of San Diego) may be
the best of California’s many beach events — the huge crowds think so.
The throng comes out in full force not only for the main competition but
also for the pancake breakfasts, food and music vendors, parade, and
kids’ sandcastle-building competition. Even if you don’t make it for the
actual event in July, you may be able to view the leftovers in the weeks
that follow — as long as rain doesn’t wash ’em away, that is. Call % 619-
424-6663 or 619-424-3151 or point your Web browser to www.usopen
sandcastle.com.
Underwater Pumpkin-Carving Contest
Underwater pumpkin carving seems even a couple of notches less prac-
tical than underwater basket weaving, yet plenty of sporting divers have
turned up in La Jolla for this 20-plus-year-old Halloween event each year.
Nobody takes it very seriously — one year the panel of judges was the
staff of a local dive shop, the next year five kids off the beach — but 
it’s always a fun party, and the surfacing jack-o’-lanterns are mighty
impressive. Even though the bulk of the action takes place below sea
level, the event is still fun to watch. For details, call Ocean Enterprises
at % 858-565-6054.
Weed Show
No, this festival doesn’t focus on that kind of weed. Still, you’ll think the
locals have been smokin’ it, what with the mind-boggling sculptures they
create in the name of art using found objects and, yes, weeds. Lest you
think this desert event (held in the vicinity of Joshua Tree National
Park), sponsored by the Twentynine Palms Historical Society, is small
potatoes, think again: More than 250 entries are usually up for critique in
multiple-judged categories during this weekend-long event in early
November. Call % 760-367-2366 for the exact date and additional details
(including entry forms) or point your Web browser to www.msnusers.
com/29palmshistoricalsociety.
Doo Dah Parade
This outrageous Thanksgiving-weekend event — referred to in host
Pasadena as the “other” parade — was born way back in 1978 as a zany
spoof of the city’s New Year’s Day annual Tournament of Roses prome-
nade. Doo Dah has since grown into a left-of-center institution all its
own, but age hasn’t cost it an ounce of silliness.
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
538

Participants usually include the Synchronized Precision Briefcase 
Drill Team (whose twirling skills are unparalleled), drag-queen cheer-
leaders (representing West Hollywood, of course), the BBQ and Hibachi
Marching Grill Team, and many more — plenty to make the Ministry 
of Silly Walks mighty proud. Radio personality Dr. Demento often serves
as Master of Ceremonies. The ashes of one longtime fan have been
crowned Doo Dah Queen in Perpetuity, and they ride on their own float.
You get the idea. But be aware that the traditional throwing of tortillas at
participants has been discouraged. Spoilsports. Call % 626-440-4029 or

Top Ten Gifts for
Cheapskates
In This Chapter
 Leaving more than your heart in San Francisco
 Contributing to California’s worthless trinket economy
 Remembering (fondly?) the folks back home
W
e don’t know about you, but buying gifts for the folks back at the
ranch who know we’ve been on vacation is sometimes more of a
chore than a pleasure. Besides the fact that no one in the western world
really needs another T-shirt, those souvenirs add up (and subtract from
our shoe allowance). Understanding, however, that some people expect
a little something, here are our best suggestions for portable, fun, some-
what useful gifts — and they’re all (or almost all) under $10. This catalog
of must-haves comprises only San Francisco–related knick-knacks —
imagine the kind of list we could compile statewide!
Playing Bridge
Not to be outdone by the museum gift shops, our own Golden Gate
Bridge hawks a variety of branded items sure to remind your nearest
and dearest of one of the wonders of the modern world. We particularly
like the $6 Golden Gate Bridge playing cards, printed with trivia about
the construction and history of this beautiful landmark. A close second
is the $7 kitchen towel, the gift of choice from thrifty shoppers. If you
run out of time and can’t get to the gift shop, you can actually purchase
these things online at http://store.goldengate.org.
Riding High
This truly is a cheapskate souvenir, but being the practical sort, we find
it elegant in its simplicity and usefulness. For a mere $5 at the Powell
Street or Hyde Street Cable Car ticket booths, you can purchase one of

four limited-edition souvenir cable-car tickets. The cards each picture a
historic cable car and are good for a one-way ride. Collect all four and
someone with a scrapbook will treasure them.
Smelling Salts
The Ferry Building Marketplace is full of places to find great gifts, but go
on a Saturday when the Farmers’ Market is in full tilt. Behind the building
look for the Eatwell Farms booth and check out the attractive $5 jars of
lavender salt or rosemary salt. They smell divine and add extra oomph
to salads and roasts. Your friends who cook will be most impressed.
Bringing Good Fortune
The biggest producer of fortune cookies in town is Mee Mee Bakery,
1328 Stockton St. between Broadway and Vallejo streets in Chinatown
(% 415-362-3204; www.meemeebakery.com). Hand over $9.75 and 
you can delight . . . someone . . . with a giant fortune cookie. Okay, at
roughly 5 inches in diameter, maybe it’s not an actual giant, but it’s 
still fairly large. Mee Mee also sells bags of chocolate- and strawberry-
flavored fortune cookies for $6.50 per pound and almond cookies for
$4.50 per pound. If you want to splurge on something more creative, 
for $25 per 100 cookies, the bakery will put your own custom fortunes
inside the crispy little devils.
Lighting the Way
Intellectuals and all your friends who belong to book clubs will be thrilled
to receive anything from City Lights (% 415-362-8193), San Francisco’s
iconic bookstore in North Beach. Good budget-minded gifts are the very
cool $8 black-and-white posters featuring the storefront, or those with
Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady looking rather James Deanish.
Writing Clearly
You can’t have too many postcards, but there’s something stressful
about picking them out — after all, postcards are like greeting cards.
They say something about the person who spent 20 minutes deciding
between the one with the cat and the one depicting Einstein. Save your
friends grief and gift them with a book of 30 San Francisco postcards
featuring the photographs of Michal Venera. At $9.95 this is a deal. Find
San Francisco 30 postcards at Chronicle Books Metreon Store, 101
Fourth St. (% 415-369-6271) or Cody’s Books at 2 Stockton St., near
Market Street (% 415-773-0444).
Chapter 29: Top Ten Gifts for Cheapskates 541

Spilling the Beans
You may not believe this, but B.S. (Before Starbucks), people in the Bay
Area were drinking strong, delicious coffee! And many continue to do 
so. They purchase it at any of a number of Peet’s Coffee & Tea stores,
including the newest one in the Ferry Building (at the foot of Market
Street on the Embarcadero), the shop in the Russ Building at 217
Montgomery St., or in the Marina at 2156 Chestnut St. A gift your coffee-
loving pals will truly appreciate is a pound of Peet’s French Roast, as
this stuff is so strong it can bench-press the competition. Starting at
around $12 per pound, it crosses the cheapskate limit, but not by much.
Besides, it’s worth it. And this is one souvenir gift that you can keep on
giving — or keep for yourself — by ordering from Peet’s online store
(www.peets.com).
Ringing Your Bell
Useless ornaments . . . ah, where would commerce be without snow
globes, pewter models, and plastic barista figurines? Well, San Francisco
can supply its fair share and at the top of our list is a spiffy tin cable car.
A mere $8.75, this little beauty actually moves using friction, and it ting-
a-lings like the real thing while skittering over linoleum. These are
among the many fine doodads available online and at the Cable Car
Museum gift shop, 1201 Mason St. (% 415-474-1887; www.cablecar
museum.org). Admission to the museum is free and it’s open every 
day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Nibbling Bliss
San Francisco has long attracted chocolate-makers to its shores, not for
any reason we know of, but there was Ghirardelli to start and Joseph
Schmidt (of the beautiful truffles) and most recently a former doctor and
a former winemaker who have together produced some serious dark
chocolate under the Scharffen Berger label. Free one-hour tours of the
handsome brick factory located at 914 Heinz Ave., in Berkeley (% 510-
981-4050; www.scharffenberger.com), are offered by appointment
daily at 10:30 a.m., 2:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. for people 10 and over.
Scharffen Berger sells two gifts that we would be genuinely pleased to
receive: the $8 cylinder filled with chocolate-covered champagne
grapes and the $6 rectangular acrylic package of a dozen 5-gram
squares (the mint flavor, if you’re wondering).
Spreading the Love
Ten bucks may not seem like much to spend on a gift, but how often do
you fork over that kind of money for a small jar of jam? Berkeley’s June
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
542

Taylor does not make ordinary preserves from ordinary fruit; thus, her
divine products created from organic fruits in small batches don’t sell for
chicken feed. And that’s why an 8-ounce jar of her white nectarine con-
serve or tangerine marmalade (among many flavors that will cause your
bread to sit up and take notice) is such a thoughtful and extravagant
offering. June Taylor’s jams can be purchased at Yum, 1750 Market St.
(% 415-626-9866), the Ferry Plaza Farmers’ Market at the Embarcadero
and Market Street, and other locations that you can find by clicking at

good state map before you leave home, but
keep in mind that you’ll often get the best
local maps after you arrive, especially in
smaller towns.
Safety
For general safety issues, use your
common sense, just as you would at home
or anywhere else. Avoid deserted and
poorly lit areas, especially at night. Always
lock the doors of your rental car and don’t
keep anything valuable inside; any thief
worth his salt can get into your locked car
quicker without a key than you can get in
with one.
Be alert in hotels and don’t let strange folks
into your hotel room unless they are clearly
personnel that you expect or have sum-
moned. Don’t hesitate to call the front desk
to verify an employee’s identity; nothing’s
too silly where your safety’s concerned.
And be sure to store your valuables and
cash in the in-room or behind-the-front-
desk safe; don’t just leave them in your
hotel room.
If you have a cellphone, bring it with you,
or rent a phone after you’re in California to
avoid paying high roaming charges. You’ll
likely be doing a lot of driving, and having a
cellphone with you can make all the differ-
ence in the world if your car breaks down
or you get lost.
In the unlikely event of an earthquake,
keep these basics in mind: Don’t run out-
side; instead, move away from windows

and toward the building’s center. Crouch
under a desk, table, or other sturdy piece
of furniture or stand in a doorway. If you
must leave the building, use the stairs, not
the elevator. If you’re in the car, pull over
to the side of the road and stay in your 
car — but don’t pull over until you’re away
from bridges, overpasses, telephone poles,
and power lines. If you’re out walking, stay
in the open, away from trees, power lines,
and buildings.
Smoking
California has the best and worst smoking
laws in the United States, depending on
your point of view. Basically, the rule is
this: If you’re indoors, you’re not allowed to
light up.
Smoking is prohibited in virtually all indoor
public spaces — yes, including restau-
rants (hence the proliferation of patio
dining, where smoking is usually allowed).
Many bars and clubs openly defy the law,
however.
A good number of hotels, especially
smaller places, also prohibit in-room smok-
ing, so be sure to ask, if it matters to you.
Taxes
California’s statewide sales tax is 7.25 
percent. Some cities tack on an additional
percentage up to 1.25 percent. The base
hotel tax is 10 percent, with some munici-
palities adding an additional surcharge
(which is noted in the hotel section of each
chapter of this book).
Time Zone
California lies in the Pacific time zone,
which is eight hours behind Greenwich
mean time, and three hours behind the
East Coast. The entire state practices day-
light saving time from April to October.
Weather
To check the weather forecasts online, log
onto www.weather.com or www.cnn.
com/weather. Also note that many local
visitor bureaus have weather links, so you
may want to check each city or region’s
official site (listed in the “Gathering More
Information” section of each destination
chapter) to get a local link.
