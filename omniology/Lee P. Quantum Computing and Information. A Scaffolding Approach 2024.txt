Preface
This book serves as a part of a series of textbooks initially crafted for the Master 
of Science in Quantum Computing Program at Fei Tian College, Middletown, New 
York. The series aspires to offer a pedagogically sound, systematic approach to 
teaching and learning quantum computing. It includes the following titles:
• Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Computing
• Quantum Computing and Information: A Scaffolding Approach (current book)
• Quantum Algorithms and Applications: A Scaffolding Approach
While each book functions as a standalone guide to its respective topic, collectively 
they furnish a comprehensive understanding of quantum computing.
Designed for beginning graduate students and senior undergraduates, this book 
also includes markers to aid both entry-level and more advanced readers.
Quantum Computing and Information (QCI) is a complex discipline, comprising 
an intricate web of knowledge that spans advanced mathematics, quantum mechanics, 
and sophisticated algorithms. Navigating this multidimensional landscape requires 
an approach to learning and teaching that acknowledges the inherently linear nature 
of reading and lectures, while also addressing the multi-faceted structure of the 
subject matter.
Effective teaching—and, by extension, effective learning—is not merely the 
transmission of information but a dynamic process of constructing understanding 
within a cognitive framework. This involves connecting new knowledge with existing 
cognitive structures, akin to weaving new threads into an ever-expanding web of 
understanding in the brain.
The scaffolding approach, central to this text, is inspired by educational theories 
such as Lev Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development and Jerome Bruner’s instruc­
tional strategies, refined through the authors’ extensive experience in academia. It 
recognizes that learning in such a complex field as QCI involves navigating a path 
that gradually ascends from foundational concepts to advanced applications.
This book operationalizes the scaffolding approach through several key strategies:
• Progressive Introduction of Concepts: The content is structured to ensure 
learners are adequately prepared for each new concept, mirroring the idea of 
assembling a multidimensional puzzle piece by piece.
• Grounding in Simple Examples: Initially, straightforward examples and intu­
itive explanations are used to anchor new topics, which gradually evolve into 
more abstract and generalized concepts.
viii

• Spiral Learning: Key ideas are revisited from multiple perspectives and in 
varying contexts, embodying the spiral nature of learning where concepts are 
deepened and expanded upon with each iteration.
• Active Engagement: Exercises and problems are integrated to promote deep 
learning through practical application, allowing learners to apply and test their 
understanding in meaningful ways.
• Cognitive Load Management: The book is designed with clarity in mind, 
featuring abundant illustrations and tables to complement the text, thereby 
reducing the cognitive load and demystifying complex mathematical and 
theoretical constructs.
By incorporating these elements, the scaffolding approach in this text not only 
imparts knowledge but also cultivates the skills necessary to navigate the multifaceted 
and interlinked domains of QCI. It reflects a sophisticated blend of the art and 
science of teaching, tailored to the unique challenges of this cutting-edge field.

The book is divided into four primary sections:
• Part I lays the groundwork for understanding quantum systems, commencing 
with simpler entities like photons and advancing to more complex systems 
such as qubits and qudits.
• Part II transitions from understanding individual quantum systems to ma­
nipulating them using quantum gates, acting as a bridge to more advanced 
quantum operations.

About Quantum Computing and Information
Introduction
Quantum Computing and Information (QCI) herald a paradigm shift in computa­
tional and information sciences, leveraging quantum mechanical principles to tackle 
complex problems across diverse fields such as cryptography, finance, and material 
science. Quantum computing, a cornerstone of QCI, focuses on utilizing quantum 
mechanics for computation, encompassing the development of algorithms, processors, 
and software. Extending beyond computing, quantum information pertains to the 
processing, storage, and transmission of information, while quantum sensing utilizes 
quantum properties for precise measurements. As QCI transitions from theoretical 
exploration to practical applications, its potential to revolutionize industry and 
academia becomes increasingly apparent.
Potential and Challenges
Quantum computing promises unprecedented speed in performing calculations for 
certain problem types, far exceeding classical computing capabilities. Algorithms 
like Shor’s and Grover’s exemplify quantum computing’s superiority in tasks such 
as integer factorization and database searching. Yet, this potential is tempered 
by challenges in scalability, quantum noise, and operational costs. As we venture 
into systems with 100 qubits and beyond, the inadequacy of classical computers to 
simulate quantum systems becomes evident, highlighting the quantum advantage.
The NISQ Era and Beyond
Currently, we find ourselves in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, 
characterized by quantum processors that hold the promise of computations beyond 
classical simulation yet lack comprehensive error correction capabilities. This era 
has spurred the development of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms to optimize the 
computational p ower of NISQ devices amid noise and limited qubit coherence.
Transitioning from the NISQ era, we are beginning to witness the emergence 
of Quantum Utility. This new phase is not merely quantified by the number 
of qubits but by the capacity for reliable, significant computations that address 
real-world problems, marking a critical step from academic inquiry to industrial 
application. Quantum utility signifies the commencement of quantum computing’s 
tangible benefits, driven by technological advancements that address enterprise-level 
challenges.
Workforce and Education
The burgeoning interest in QCI has precipitated a growing demand for professionals 
versed in quantum technologies. In response, educational institutions are integrating 
quantum computing into their curricula, anticipating a rise in the quest for quantum 
talent. Accessible software platforms will likely play a key role in democratizing 
quantum computing education, akin to the role of machine learning platforms today.
xiv

Required Expertise
The interdisciplinary nature of QCI necessitates expertise in linear algebra, quantum 
mechanics, computer science, and aspects of electrical engineering, among others. 
Proficiency with quantum programming languages and platforms such as Qiskit, 
Cirq, Q#, or Braket becomes increasingly important. As the field evolves, so too 
will the requisite skill set.
Learning Pathway
For those new to the field, a structured learning approach is recommended. Starting 
with foundational concepts like linear algebra and quantum mechanics before pro­
gressing to practical applications in quantum algorithms and programming ensures a 
solid base. Keeping abreast of the latest developments through journals, conferences, 
and academic courses is essential in a rapidly advancing field.
Are You Ready?
QCI represents not just a technological leap but a fundamental reimagining of 
computation and information processing. At this pivotal moment, the future of 
computing is poised for transformation, laden with challenges but rich in opportunity. 
The invitation is clear: embrace this cutting-edge technology, arm yourself with the 
necessary knowledge, and contribute to a future powered by the vast potential of 
QCI.
A Pioneering Vision for Quantum Computing
Nature isn’t classical, and if you 
want to make a simulation of na­
ture, you’d better make it quantum 
mechanical, and it’s a wonderful prob­
lem, because it doesn’t look so easy.”

Quantum mechanics (QM) serves as the cornerstone for understanding the funda­
mental nature of our universe. It is the theoretical framework that governs the 
behavior of matter and energy on microscopic scales. Its principles have profound 
implications for emerging fields such as quantum computing, quantum communica­
tion, and quantum information. However, the abstract and counterintuitive nature 
of QM can present significant challenges for those unfamiliar with traditional physics 
and mathematics.
Photons offer a gateway into the world of quantum mechanics that is both 
accessible and illustrative. As the simplest system that embodies the core principles 
of QM, photons provide an opportunity to bypass the mathematical complexities 
often associated with this field. Photon phenomena can be easily visualized, enabling 
a more intuitive understanding. Moreover, photons play a crucial role as a key 
physical platform for quantum computing and quantum communication. This makes 
them not only a pedagogical tool but also a practical one, bridging theory and 
application.
The purpose of this chapter is to introduce the first three principles of Quantum 
Mechanics through the lens of photon behavior. The aim is to emphasize the basic 
concepts and principles essential to quantum computing, providing an easier learning 
path for readers who have not come from a physics background. By grounding the 
discussion in tangible photon phenomena, the chapter will seek to demystify QM, 
laying a solid foundation for further exploration and study in the interconnected 
fields of quantum computing, communication, and information.
1.1 Introducing Quantum Mechanics
1.1.1 A Brief History
At the turn of the 20th century, classical physics had successfully explained many 
macroscopic phenomena, including Newtonian mechanics, electromagnetism, ther­
modynamics, and more. Yet, certain physical observations, such as the photoelectric 
effect and the black body radiation problem, could not be explained within this 
classical framework.
Quantum mechanics emerged as a revolutionary theory that could account for 
these discrepancies. It became the fundamental theory describing matter, energy, 
and motion at atomic and subatomic scales. Technologies such as semiconductor 

1.1 Introducing Quantum Mechanics

devices, lasers, and nuclear energy, and emerging fields like quantum computing, are 
rooted in quantum mechanics.
Key figures in the development of quantum mechanics include Planck, Einstein, 
Heisenberg, Bohr, Born, Schrodinger, and Dirac. Theories and notations named 
after these pioneers continue to be vital in current research and applications.
Quantum physics supersedes its classical counterparts, rendering classical physics 
as a special case of quantum mechanics. However, a full unification between quan­
tum mechanics and general relativity remains an open question, with theories like 
superstring theory attempting to bridge this gap.
1.1.2 Principles of Quantum Mechanics
Figure 1.1: Role of Quantum Mechanics in Quantum Computing
As depicted in Fig. 1.1, the core components of quantum computing and information 
are grounded in specific quantum mechanical phenomena. Phenomena such as 
quantum superposition, entanglement, and interference are essential, but these 
complex behaviors are themselves derived from more fundamental principles of 
quantum mechanics.
Often referred to as postulates or axioms, these principles are the foundational 
pillars of quantum mechanics, analogous to how Newton’s laws form the foundation of 
classical mechanics. Below is a brief introduction to the five principles, contextualized 
within the realm of quantum computing:
1. Quantum States: A quantum state is a complex vector that contains all 
the information about a quantum system. Quantum bits, or qubits, replace 
classical bits in quantum computing, and the state of a qubit is described 
as a superposition of the 0 and 1 states. This means a qubit can represent 
both states simultaneously, a feature that is unique to quantum systems. This 
principle enables parallel computation and has the potential to vastly increase 
computational efficiency for specific problems.

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons

2. Quantum Observables: In quantum mechanics, observables are measurable 
physical quantities represented by Hermitian operators. In quantum computing, 
these operators extract specific outcomes from a system’s quantum state during 
measurement.
3. Quantum Measurements: Quantum measurements facilitate information ex­
traction from a quantum system, collapsing the state into one of the possible 
outcomes. This principle is essential in quantum algorithms, where mea­
surements obtain the final result, and it is fundamental in quantum error 
correction.
4. Quantum Evolution: Quantum evolution governs the change in quantum states 
over time according to the Schrodinger equation. In quantum computing, 
quantum gates control this evolution, and algorithms are constructed using 
sequences of these gates.
5. Quantum Composition: Quantum composition involves building complex 
quantum systems from simpler ones. In quantum computing, this principle 
enables the creation of intricate quantum circuits from basic quantum gates, 
fostering the design of complex algorithms and enhancing the understanding 
of quantum computational processes.
These principles underpin the theoretical foundation of quantum computing, 
shaping the design, function, and comprehension of quantum algorithms, circuits, 
and systems. For those in the fields of quantum computing and quantum information, 
understanding these principles is vital, as they directly inform the practical aspects 
of computation and algorithm design.
In this chapter, we will focus on the first three principles, with the remaining 
two explored in subsequent chapters.
1.1.3 Our Approach
We strive to make Quantum Mechanics accessible to non-physics majors, tailored 
specifically for quantum computing and information (QCI), without sacrificing the 
rigor of core concepts. Our scaffolding approach unfolds the myriad of QM concepts 
gradually but systematically across three chapters (1-3) focused on photons, 2-spins, 
and qubits/qudits.
Traditional courses in quantum mechanics often commence with complex mathe­
matical formulations of differential equations, applicable to a wide range of quantum 
systems. While this approach is mathematically rigorous, it does not align well with 
the specialized needs for understanding QCI.
In contrast, our approach uses linear algebra and emphasizes two-level quantum 
systems, particularly qubits, focusing on principles and techniques that are essential 
to quantum computing. By using tangible examples involving photons and electron 
spins, we render these abstract concepts more accessible. This methodology ensures 
an intuitive grasp of the subject matter without compromising academic rigor.
Furthermore, we acknowledge that QCI is an interdisciplinary field, bridging 
the domains of quantum physics, computer science, and mathematics. By situating 
the subject matter within this broader interdisciplinary context, we offer a more 
comprehensive perspective that extends beyond the scope of a conventional course 

1.2 Understanding Photons
6
in quantum physics, thereby preparing the reader for the multifaceted landscape of 
QCI.
1.2 Understanding Photons
1.2.1 What Are Photons?
Photons are the particles of light. In fact, they constitute the particles of all 
electromagnetic waves, including radio waves, microwaves, visible light, X-rays, 
gamma rays, and more. You may wonder, “We have never heard that radio waves 
have photons; do they?” The answer is yes. In the case of radio waves, since their 
frequency is low and the wavelength is large, ranging from meters to 100 meters, we 
find ourselves in the classical regime where the quantum effects of the photons are 
not apparent.
However, quantum effects become crucial in the behavior of electromagnetic 
radiation under certain conditions, such as interactions at small scales (atomic 
and subatomic), high energy regimes, and strongly confined systems. Under these 
circumstances, classical electromagnetic theories fall short in describing phenomena 
like energy quantization and wave-particle duality. In fields like quantum computing 
and quantum communication, it’s not just that quantum effects are prominent; they 
are intentionally harnessed and manipulated, requiring a quantum treatment of light 
as well.
In the quantum regime, the energy of the electromagnetic waves is quantized, 
and the energy of each packet or photon depends on the frequency (v = w/2n), not 
on the amplitude, of the electromagnetic radiation:
E = hv = hw 
(1.1)
where h is the Planck constant, and h = h/2n is the reduced Planck constant.
In our everyday classical regime, an electromagnetic wave can be viewed as 
a flux of photons. For example, when looking at a computer screen, our eyes 
receive somewhere between 1014 to 1016 photons per second. However, in quantum 
computing and communication, we can transmit, receive, and measure a single 
photon at a time.
1.2.2 Polarization of Photons
In classical electromagnetism, polarization refers to the orientation of the electric 
field vector’s oscillations in an electromagnetic wave. A polarized light wave consists 
of electric and magnetic fields oscillating in specific directions as the wave propagates. 
Linear polarization, where the electric field vector oscillates along a single axis, is 
common, but circular and elliptical polarization also exist. Various optical devices 
such as polarizers can manipulate or analyze classical light wave polarization.
In the quantum realm, polarization takes on a more abstract representation. The 
polarization of a photon corresponds to an intrinsic property related to its angular 
momentum. A photon is treated as a quantum particle, and its polarization is a 
two-dimensional complex vector, corresponding to a quantum state. Unlike the 
continuous oscillations of the electric field in the classical description, the quantum 
description deals with discrete outcomes. Quantum polarization can still be linear,

electric field vector as seen in the direction of propagation.

circular, or elliptical, and is vital in various quantum technologies such as quantum 
cryptography and quantum computing. Quantum polarization states can also be 
superposed and entangled, giving rise to distinctly quantum behaviors with no 
classical analogs.
Figure 1.2 illustrates light polarizations in the classical realm as waves of electric 
field vibration and as flux of photons in the quantum realm. The relationship between 
classical and quantum polarization descriptions lies in their conceptual connection 
and experimental consistency. While the classical view describes continuous wave 
properties, and the quantum view deals with particle-like attributes, polarization 
measurements in both realms yield consistent results. The quantum polarization 
state of a photon can be related to the corresponding classical wave’s electric field 
orientation. This connection enables us to use photons as a model system to introduce 
the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics conveniently.
Table 1.1 lists key polarization states examined in this chapter, corresponding to 
Fig. 1.2. Additionally, elliptically polarized light is the most general state and can be 
considered as a linear combination of various orthogonal polarizations. Unpolarized 
light is a uniform statistical combination of these orthogonal states.

1.2.3 A Curious Light Polarization Experiment
Figure 1.3 depicts an experiment involving light polarization. In the background, 
there are some unpolarized light sources. Two polarizers are placed in front of the 
light sources, with one (H) oriented horizontally and the other (V) vertically. When 
observing either of these polarizers alone, we notice that about half of the light is 
transmitted. However, in the region where the two polarizers overlap, the light is 
entirely blocked.
A third polarizer (D), oriented at 45°, is then inserted between polarizers H 
and V. Intuitively, one might expect this third polarizer to block even more light, 
and that all the light would still be completely blocked where the three polarizers 
overlap. This intuition holds in the regions where H and D or V and D overlap, with 
about 25% of light being transmitted. Surprisingly, however, in the region where all 
three polarizers overlap, approximately 12.5% of the light is now transmitted. This 
situation does not occur if the third polarizer is placed on top or beneath H and V 
or if it is also oriented horizontally or vertically.

This intriguing behavior can be understood within the classical regime using 
traditional electromagnetic theory. In fact, you can demonstrate the experiment 
using Polaroid films as polarizers.
In the quantum regime, where it is possible to experiment with one photon at 
a time, the result is exactly the same. This raises a puzzling question: if H and V 
polarizations alone can block all photons, why do some photons pass after inserting 
another polarizer in between?
Quantum mechanics provides a comprehensive explanation for this experiment, 
even quantitatively. We will proceed to explain this experiment in terms of quantum 
mechanics, but first, we need to introduce some fundamental principles of quantum 
mechanics.
1.3 The Quantum State Postulate
1.3.1 Classical Variables to Quantum Vectors
The foundational principle of quantum mechanics is the principle of the quantum 
state. To understand this, let’s first contrast it with classical physics, where the 
state of systems is described by recognizable physical quantities.
In a classical mechanical system, such as a ball moving through space, the state 
is characterized by position, velocity, and acceleration. In the case of a classical 
electromagnetic wave, the state is described by the E and B vectors, representing 
the electric and magnetic field strengths.
Quantum systems deviate substantially from their classical counterparts. Instead 
of conventional quantities like position or velocity, the state of a quantum system is 
represented by a special vector known as the state vector or wave function.
For a two-level quantum system like photon polarization, the state vector is 
two-dimensional with components a and fl, both of which are generally complex 
numbers. Unlike classical vectors, where components are real numbers, the squared 
magnitudes of a and fl relate to the probability of specific measurements. This 

1.3 The Quantum State Postulate
10
probabilistic nature requires the state vector to be normalized, meaning the sum of 
the squares of these components equals one.
Postulate 1: Quantum State
(Simplified version) The state of a quantum system is completely described by a 
normalized complex vector.
For instance, in a two-level system such as photon polarization, the quantum 
state is a two-dimensional vector, typically expressed as
a
V
| 4} =
(1.2)
To declare |^) as normalized means:
(*  | *)  = | a |2 + | V |2 = 1 ■
(1.3)
While photon polarization involves a two-dimensional state vector, the dimension­
ality of state vectors in other quantum systems can be much larger, even extending 
to infinity.
The vector representing a quantum state is often referred to as the state vector, 
or simply, the state. In some contexts, especially in infinite-dimensional space, it 
is also called the wavefunction.
Throughout this text, we use the Dirac notation for vectors and operators, offering 
a concise and powerful way to represent quantum states and operations. In this 
notation, |^) represents a column vector (where ^ is a label), while (^| is its 
adjoint (the complex conjugate transpose, (^| = |^)^). The inner product between 
|$) and |^) is expressed as ($|^). For further resources on Dirac notation and 
linear algebra, please refer to Appendix C.

1.3.2 Rectilinear Polarization States
Let’s first take vertical and horizontal Rectilinear polarizations as examples to eluci­
date the Quantum State Postulate. We will begin by selecting vertical polarization 
as our reference state and assigning it the simplest normalized two-dimensional 
vector:

0
|V> =
(1.4)
The content inside |-) serves merely as a label. For instance, vertical polarization 
can be expressed in various ways such as |vertical), |$), or |V).
What is the state vector for horizontal polarization, denoted as |H)? Experimen­
tal evidence (refer to § 1.2.3) shows that vertically polarized photons will not pass 
through a horizontal polarizer, indicating that vertical and horizontal polarizations 
are mutually exclusive.
In quantum terms, mutually exclusive states correspond to disjoint measurement 
outcomes. Such states cannot coexist; if a system is in one of these states, it cannot 
simultaneously be in another. This exclusivity leads to the orthogonality of the 
states, meaning their inner product is zero: (V|H) = 0.
Implication 1.1: Orthogonal States
Mutually exclusive quantum states are orthogonal; that is, their inner products 
are 0. Since these states are both normalized and orthogonal, they are referred 
to as orthonormal.
Given this orthogonality, the simplest normalized vector representing |H) and 
orthogonal to | V) is
0

| H ) =
(1.5)
1.3.3 Basis States
We recognize in linear algebra that a complete set of orthonormal vectors can serve as 
a basis. In our context, the vectors |V) and |H) are orthonormal. Additionally, since 
these vectors are linearly independent, they span the entire two-dimensional space, 
thus forming a complete set. The completeness ensures that any possible vector in 
the space can be represented as a linear combination of these vectors, allowing them 
to function as basis states. This leads to the expression of any polarization state, 
|P), as
| P} = a | V} + V | H} =
a
V
(1.6)
where a and V are complex numbers satisfying the normalization condition |a|2 + 
|V|2 = 1.
Implication 1.2: Superposition States
A general quantum state exists as a linear superposition of basis states.

1.3 The Quantum State Postulate
12
In forthcoming sections, we will elaborate on this idea using examples of diagonal 
and circular polarizations. However, before delving into those specifics, let’s discuss 
the nature of our chosen basis states further.
We have designated the set {| V), |H)} as our standard basis for the system. In 
the parlance of quantum computing, this standard basis is also commonly referred 
to as the computational basis, represented by {|0), |1)}. For our photon polarization 
system, the equivalence between these sets is formalized as
|0> = | V), |1> = |H).
(1.7)
Therefore, Eq. 1.6 can be reformulated in terms of the computational basis as
|$} = a |0) + fi |1).
(1.8)
Equations 1.6 and 1.8 can be likened to the representation of a two-dimensional 
real vector v = ate + by for easier visualization.
1.3.4 Diagonal Polarization States
Let’s look at diagonal polarization. We said earlier that photon polarization is a 
system that’s very easy to visualize in quantum mechanics. Let’s illustrate why we 
can, in fact, use regular vectors to represent the polarization states. As shown in 
Fig. 1.4, the vertical polarization | V) is along the y axis, the horizontal polarization 
|H) is along the x axis, and the diagonal polarization |D) would be along the y = x 
line. Thus, you would expect the diagonal polarization state to be proportional to a 
combination, or in quantum mechanics terms, a superposition of the vertical state 
and the horizontal state, represented by |D) ~ (| V) + | H»•
Figure 1.4: Relationship between H/V and D/A Polarizations
We have already assigned vectors to the vertical and horizontal polarizations, so
the diagonal polarization should be proportional to
Only we have a problem;
this vector is not normalized, meaning if you take the inner product of this vector
with itself, which gives you 12 + 12 = 2, it is not 1. So, in order to make this vector 
normalized, we need to divide it by \/2. This correction leads us to the actual
representation of the diagonal state:
or in Dirac notation,

|D} = 72 0 V} + IH » ■
(1-10)
Now, let’s look at the anti-diagonal polarization state |A); it is 135°, along the 
y = — x line- This polarization state, you can imagine it should be |A) ~ (I V ) —| H)), 
which is

need to divide it by \/2, therefore
IA} = 72 (I V } — I H » = —

(1-11)
The D and A polarizations are also mutually exclusive, reflected as | D) and | A) 
being orthogonal, i-e-, (D|A) = 0-
■ Example 1.1 Let’s verify (D|A) = 0- In matrix representation,
(D | A} = --. [1 1] — [—1J=o ■
In Dirac notation,
(D|A) = -12 «V| + (H|) -12 (|V) — |H))
= 1« V | V) — (V | H) + (H | V) — (H | H))
= 2(1 — o + o — i) = o ■
■
Since | D) and | A) are orthonormal, they also form a basis for photon polarization 
states- A general polarization state can be represented in this basis as
|P) = y | D) + 5 | A), 
(1-12)
where y and 5 are complex numbers satisfying |y|2 + 1512 = 1- 
In particular,
|V} = -2 (|D> + |A)), 
|H) = -12 (|D) — |A)) ■

In the context of quantum computing, |D) and | A) correspond to the |+) and 
|—) states, which we will study later-

using both matrix representation and Dirac notation.
1.3.5 Circular Polarization States
So far, we have only examined linear polarizations. In linear polarization, the 
polarization vector stays fixed as the photon propagates. But in circular polarization, 
as depicted in Fig. 1.2, the polarization vector rotates as the photon propagates. 
With right circular polarization |R), the turning of the polarization vector is right­
handed as we look in the direction of propagation. When the photon travels one 
wavelength, the polarization vector will turn by 360^ clockwise.
Let’s look at how we can construct a state vector for this quantum state. We’ll 
utilize the xy coordinate system, as for photon polarizations, we have the luxury 
to do so. The difference between linear polarization |D) and circular polarization 
|R) is that for |D), the horizontal vector and the vertical vector are always in phase, 
but for |R), the state vector goes through the y axis first then turns to the x axis; 
or equivalently, the x (|H)) lags the y (|V)) component by a 90^ phase.
So we need to introduce a phase factor. A 90^ lagging phase corresponds to a 
phase factor e-in/2 = — i. Therefore, we expect the state vector |R) to be
| R} = 712 (| V}- i | H }) = 712 1
—i
(1.14)
Again, the \/2 factor comes from the normalization requirement.
Of course, we could also argue that the y component leads the x component 
by a 90^ phase, and correspondingly |R) = 12 (i |V) + |H)). This expression and 
Eq. 1.14 should be physically equivalent. Note that the two differ just by a global 
phase factor i:
(i |V) + |H)) = i (|V) — i |H}).
This leads to the following observation:
Implication 1.3: Global Phase
Global phase of a quantum state vector does not have physical significance. That 
is, ei^ |^) represents the same quantum state as |^), where $ is a real number 
representing a phase angle.
What about left-handed circular polarization? It is the opposite to right polar­
ization, with the H component leading the V component by a 90^ phase. So the 
state vector (up to a global phase) is
। L}=712 d V}+i ।H })=7121
(1.15)

Exercise 1.3 Verify that |L) and |R) are normalized and orthogonal with each 
other, using both matrix representation and Dirac notation.
Similar to | H) and | V), and | D) and | A), | L) and | R) also form a basis for photon 
polarization states, because they are orthonormal. A general polarization state can 
be represented in this basis as
|P} = m |L} + v |R}. 
(1.16)
Exercise 1.4 Represent |V) and |H) in terms of |L) and |R).
1.3.6 General Polarization States
We have established that any polarization state, denoted by |P), can be represented 
in the form (see Eq. 1.6):
| P) = a | V) + p | H). 
(1.17)
Here, a and P are complex numbers subject to the normalization condition 
|a|2 + |P|2 = 1. These coefficients can be parameterized by two real angles 0 and $ 
as:
a = cos 0, P = sin 0ei^. 
(1.18)
The normalization condition is naturally satisfied due to cos2 0 + sin2 0 = 1, 
allowing for an arbitrary phase ei^ between |V) and |HThus, |P) becomes:
|P) =cos 0 | V) + sin Qei^ |H]. 
(1.19)
This general form accounts for elliptical polarization, as illustrated in Fig. 1.5. 
Rectilinear, diagonal, and circular polarizations emerge as special cases, as summa­
rized in the table below.

We have previously seen that |P) can be alternatively expressed in different bases 
(Eqs. 1.12 and 1.16).
1.3.7 The Quantum State Postulate
In § 1.3.1 we have introduced the Quantum State Postulate in complex vector space, 
which is adequate for quantum computing in most cases. More generally, quantum 
states reside in a Hilbert space.
Postulate 1: Quantum State
The state of a quantum system is completely described by a normalized complex 
vector in a Hilbert space.
A Hilbert space (H) is a vector space equipped with an inner product that is 
complete, meaning that it contains all its limit points. Its dimension is N = 2n for 
a system of n qubits, and can even be infinite. But for our purpose in quantum 
computing, we can consider a Hilbert space H as a complex vector space, denoted 
as CN.
For a two-level system, the quantum state can be described by:
a
V
| 4} =
(1.20)
Here a,0 € C satisfying (^|^) = ||^)|2 = 1, and the state space is C2.
1.4 The Quantum Observable Postulate
As we delve into the intricate landscape of quantum mechanics, we encounter a key 
juncture where the State Postulate seamlessly gives way to the Measurement Postu­
late. Central to navigating this landscape are observables, fundamental quantities 
that lie at the core of understanding measurable properties within quantum systems. 
The Quantum Observable Postulate, our starting point, stands as the foundation of 
this exploration.

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons 
17
In the context of Quantum Computing, where harnessing quantum phenomena 
holds immense potential, measurement assumes paramount importance. Measure­
ment serves as the gateway through which we extract information from quantum 
systems, shaping the very essence of Quantum Computing.
Our journey begins with the Observable Postulate, followed by the subsequent 
unveiling of the Measurement Postulate. Each step reveals distinct facets of the 
quantum realm. Through a series of subsections, we unravel the transition from 
classical macroscopic quantities to the enigmatic world of quantum observables. 
Along this path, we delve into illustrative examples, unravel the intricacies of 
mathematical representation, and unveil the profound interplay between observables 
and quantum states. This section, serving as both a guide and an exploration, 
establishes the groundwork for a deeper voyage into the boundless potential of 
Quantum Computing.
1.4.1 Macroscopic Quantities to Quantum Observables
The principle of quantum states has been introduced through illustrative examples 
involving photon polarization. According to this principle, the state of a quantum 
system finds complete description within a normalized state vector. It is worth 
noting the term ‘completely,’ which we’ve hitherto left unexplored. Additionally, 
we’ve established that the components of these state vectors are generally complex 
numbers.
One might inquire: how do physical attributes like light intensity, energy, position, 
and velocity fit into this framework? These attributes are categorized as quantum 
observables (also referred to as measurables), and they constitute the focus of our 
forthcoming exploration.
In quantum mechanics, observables are represented by Hermitian operators, 
symbolized as M in the subsequent discussion. In this context, M can signify 
properties such as position or light intensity. These operators take the form of 
matrices, possessing eigenvalues and eigenvectors that relate to the measurable 
outcomes attainable from the quantum state system.
Postulate 2: Quantum Observables
Any physically measurable quantity is represented by a Hermitian operator 
(matrix) M.
The eigenvalues of M, denoted as {Xi}, represent the possible outcomes when 
measuring M.
For each eigenvalue Xi, the corresponding eigenvector | Xi) is the state that 
yields that particular measurement outcome with certainty.
The Observable Postulate is illustrated in Fig. 1.6. This postulate states that 
any physically measurable quantity in quantum mechanics can be associated with 
a Hermitian operator known as an observable, represented here by M. When this 
operator acts on its eigenstate |Xi), the outcome is the state itself scaled by a 
corresponding eigenvalue Xi . For a d-dimensional system (i.e., the operator M is 
a d x d matrix), there are d such pairs of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and the 
index i runs from 1 to d, accounting for each dimension of the system. Eigenvalues

may be degenerate, meaning different eigenvectors can correspond to the same 
eigenvalue. For further details on eigenvectors and eigenvalues in the context of 
quantum observables, see Appendix C and Ref [9].
This concept may appear quite mathematical, but it will become clearer with 
examples that we will explore next. In quantum computing, this postulate informs 
how we can extract information from qubits. The readout is essentially a measure­
ment, and thus the postulate helps in understanding how algorithms will behave 
when translated into physical operations.
Since quantum observables are Hermitian operators (matrices), let’s first review 
the properties of those in order to understand this postulate:
• Definition of Hermitian operator: M^ = M.
• Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues, ensuring that measurements yield 
real-numbered outcomes.
• The eigenstates associated with distinct eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are 
guaranteed to be orthogonal. (A mathematical nuauce: while the eigenvalues 
are unique, the eigenvectors corresponding to them are not. Specifically, non­
degenerate eigenvectors can differ by an overall phase factor, which has no 
observable physical consequence.)
• Hermitian operators possess a complete set of eigenstates, allowing any quan­
tum state to be expanded as a linear combination of these eigenstates.

1.4.2 Observables for Rectilinear Polarizations
Let’s examine linear polarizations again. According to the observable principle, the 
reason we can measure these states with definite answers (pass or blocked) means 
that there is an observable for each case. That observable is a particular Hermitian 
matrix, and the eigenvectors of this matrix should be the vectors corresponding to 
those definite states. We will demonstrate how this works.
Let’s start with the vertical polarization |V), and we use the vertical observable 
MV to measure it:
MV = 10
00
(1.21)
We know when we use a vertical polarizer to measure a photon with vertical 
polarization, we get a definite yes answer. If we assign a value 1 to yes (pass) and 0 
to no (blocked) to the measurement outcome, we expect |V) to be an eigenvector of 
MV with an eigenvalue 1:
MV | V} = 11V} = | V},
(1.22)
which you can easily verify. Similarly, when we use a vertical polarizer to measure a 
photon with horizontal polarization, we get a definite no answer. There is no maybe 
answer. We expect |H) to be an eigenvector of MV with an eigenvalue 0:
MV | H} = 0 | H} = 0.
(1.23)
This demonstrates an important concept derived from the Quantum Observable 
principle:
Implication 2.1: Quantization of Measurement Outcomes
Unlike classical systems where observables can take continuous ranges of values, 
quantum observables often have discrete eigenvalues.
The same concept also underlies why atoms have discrete energy levels, and that 
qubits exist as two-level systems. It is explained by the observable principle because 
only possible outcome of a quantum measurement is one of the eigenvalues of the 
corresponding observable operator. These eigenvalues are often discrete numbers.
Similarly, if we use a horizontal polarizer to measure vertical and horizontal 
polarizations, we are using an observable MH (which is complimentary to MV):
MH = 00
01
(1.24)
Mh | V}=0, 
Mh | H} = | H}.
(1.25a)
(1.25b)

1.4 The Quantum Observable Postulate

1.4.3
Observables for Diagonal Polarizations
Now, let’s look at the diagonal polarizations |D) and |A). They are also mutually 
exclusive quantum states, and the two vectors are orthonormal. We will measure 
them using a diagonal polarizer, represented by an observable operator MD . This 
round, instead of verifying the observable matrix, let’s derive it, which involves 
essential skills for anyone working on quantum computing. Let
MD = ab
c d,
and we require
Md |D} = |D}, i.e.,
Md |A} = 0,

The preceding demonstration of MV and MD leads to another implication of the 
Observable Postulate:
Implication 2.2: Measurement Basis
The choice of observable determines the basis in which the measurement outcome 
is to be expressed.
1.4.4
Exercise 1.9 Derive the observable operator Ma for measuring |D) with outcome 
0 and |A) with outcome 1, similar to how MD is derived in Eq. 1.27.
Observables for Circular Polarizations
The circular polarizations |L) and |R) are also mutually exclusive quantum states. 
There should be an observable operator ML which has |L) as eigenvector with 
eigenvalue 1, and |R) with eigenvalue 0; and vice versa for the complimentary 
observable MR .
This round, we will demonstrate a more general method to derive the matrices 
of ML and MR . According to the spectral decomposition theorem, a Hermitian 
matrix can be expressed as the sum of its eigenvalues times the outer products of 
the eigenvectors:
M = 
Xi |Xi)(Xi|. 
(1.29)

The above derivation of ML is a key skill for anyone learning quantum computing. 
Through ML we have also demonstrated that even though an observable operator 
may contain complex numbers, its associated eigenvalues are real numbers, owing to 
a property of Hermitian matrices.
Exercise 1.10 Using both the matrix representation and Dirac notation, verify
that
Ml | L } = | L },
Ml | R} = 0.
Exercise 1.11 Derive the observable operator Mr for measuring |L) with outcome 
0 and |R) with outcome 1, similar to how ML is derived in Eq. 1.30.
1.4.5 Basis Equivalence and Dirac Notation
Quantum states and observables are not tied to a specific basis; rather, their vector 
or matrix representation changes when expressed in different bases. According 
to the Observable Postulate, each observable’s eigenvectors serve as a basis for 
quantum states. These bases, formed by the eigenvectors of Hermitian operators, 
are mathematically interchangeable for describing quantum systems.
Dirac’s bra-ket notation offers a consistent, basis-agnostic framework for rep­
resenting these quantum entities. For a succinct review of Dirac notation in the 
context of linear algebra, refer to Appendix C.
Basis-Independence in Dirac Bra-Ket Notation
The Dirac bra-ket notation abstractly and universally represents quantum states 
and operators, highlighting their inherent basis-independence.
We previously examined photon polarization states and their associated ob­
servables. Table 1.2 consolidates their vector and matrix representations in both 
rectilinear and diagonal bases.
As a demonstration of the power of the Dirac notation, let’s derive the matrix of 
ML in the {|D), |A)} basis. We treat the equations in Table 1.2 as basis-independent 
relations, and work through the algebra to obtain ML in terms of |D) and |A):

Exercise 1.12 In our standard formulation, matrices MV, MD, and ML have 
eigenvalues of 1 (pass) for the first eigenvector and 0 (blocked) for the second. 
Consider an alternative assignment where the second eigenvector has an eigenvalue 
of -1 instead of 0. Derive the matrices MV, MD, and ML under this new scheme, 
and represent them in the |V), |H) basis. You will discover the Pauli matrices.
While quantum computing commonly employs orthonormal basis states tied to 
specific observables, it’s worth noting that mathematically, basis states need only 
to be linearly independent and complete; orthonormality is not a requirement.
1.5 The Quantum Measurement Postulate
The Observable Postulate and the Measurement Postulate constitute fundamental 
tenets within the realm of quantum mechanics. These postulates delineate the 
behavior of quantum systems and the intricate process of measurement. Specifically, 
the Observable Postulate stipulates that every observable quantity, such as position 
and light intensity, is symbolized by a Hermitian operator in quantum mechanics. 
On the other hand, the Measurement Postulate details the methodology of measuring 
an observable quantity within a quantum system.
In the ensuing discussion, we will delve into the intricacies of the Measurement 
Postulate, dissecting it into two key components: measurement probability and state 
collapse. These principles form the bedrock of quantum mechanics, providing insight 
into the interdependencies between measurements, states, and probabilities. We 
will elucidate these concepts using the context of photon polarization, employing it 
as a visual aid to comprehend the embodiment of these principles within quantum 
systems.
Quantum measurement is a complex subject that continues to evolve with advance­
ments in quantum computing and quantum information science. The standard 
quantum measurement postulates presented in this section serve as foundational 
concepts. These will be extended in § 3.4 to encompass a general measurement 
framework, including more complex scenarios such as Positive Operator-Valued 
Measures (POVMs), thereby offering increased flexibility and broader applicability.
1.5.1 Measurement Probability
The Observable Postulate informs us that if a quantum state takes the form of an 

1.5 The Quantum Measurement Postulate
24
eigenstate | Xi) of an observable M, the measurement outcome will unequivocally 
yield Xi. In essence, distinguishing eigenstates of an observable remains unambiguous.
However, when we endeavor to measure a general quantum state—such as 
a superposition state |^) as presented in Eq. 1.17—that does not conform to an 
eigenstate of M , multiple outcomes come into play, inherently characterizing quantum 
measurements as probabilistic phenomena.
Postulate 3a: Measurement Probability
The outcome of measuring an observable M on a quantum state | ^) corresponds 
to one of its eigenvalues. The probability associated with each eigenvalue Xi is 
given by | (Xi|^) |2 (the Born rule).
This postulate offers a multi-faceted understanding of quantum measurement, 
leading to several significant implications, as detailed below:
Implication 3.1: Non-deterministic Outcomes
Quantum measurements inherently entail probabilistic outcomes—a distinct 
contrast to classical physics where measurements are deterministic provided 
knowledge of both initial conditions and governing equations.
Implication 3.2: Quantum State and Measurement Probabilities
The Born rule establishes the mathematical framework that links quantum states 
to the probabilities of measurement outcomes.
Implication 3.3: Total Probability
Quantum state vectors maintain normalization across all bases, aligning with the 
fundamental requirement that probabilities of mutually exclusive events must 
collectively sum to 1.
Photon Polarization Experiments
The experiments shown in Fig. 1.7 exemplify the Born rule. Photons are prepared 
in the vertical polarization |^) = |V). In part (a), they are measured with a vertical 
polarizer. The passing probability is | (V|^) |2 = | (V|V) |2 = 1, thus 100% of the 
photons pass through.
In part (b), where the photons are measured with a horizontal polarizer, the 
passing probability becomes | (H |^) |2 = | (H |V) |2 = 0, and consequently, no 
photons pass through.
In part (c), when the photons are measured with a diagonal polarizer, the passing 
probability is | (D|^) |2 = | (D|V) |2 = 0.5. As a result, 50% of photons pass through 
while the rest are blocked. This is reflected in the figure by the doubled spacing 
between the photons.

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons
25
Exercise 1.13 What is the passing probability of vertically polarized photons 
| ^) = | V) when measured with a device that passes left circular polarization ML ?
1.5.2 State Collapse
In classical physics, measurements can often be conducted in such a way that the 
system remains undisturbed. The deterministic framework of classical physics enables 
these non-invasive measurements. However, quantum mechanics is fundamentally 
different. Owing to the quantization of energy and other properties, along with the 
limitations imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, any measurement in 
a quantum system inevitably involves a disturbance to that system. For example, 
measuring an electron’s position necessarily affects its momentum. This departure 
from classical intuition is one of the defining traits of quantum mechanics.
This divergence between classical and quantum paradigms leads us to an essential 
feature of quantum theory: the postulate of measurement state collapse. In quantum 
systems, a measurement forces a transition in the state of the system. Specifically, 
according to Postulate 3b, when an observable M is measured on a quantum state 
| ^), the state collapses to one of the eigenstates | Xi) corresponding to the measured 
eigenvalue Xi. This state collapse is immediate and irreversible.
Postulate 3b: Measurement State Collapse
After the measurement, the quantum state collapses to the eigenstate associated 
with the measured eigenvalue.

1.5 The Quantum Measurement Postulate
26
The immediate implication of this postulate is that measurements in quantum 
mechanics are fundamentally non-reversible processes.
Implication 3.4: Irreversible Effect
Measurements permanently alter the quantum state, forcing it into one of the 
eigenstates of the measured observable. This non-reversibility is non-classical 
and affects the system’s subsequent dynamics.
In other words, the act of measurement irrevocably changes the quantum state. 
Once the system is in an eigenstate of the observable M , subsequent measurements 
with the same observable will consistently yield the same result.
Implication 3.5: Subsequent Measurements
Once a measurement has been made, the system’s state collapses to a definite 
eigenstate. Therefore, any repeated measurements with the same observable will 
yield identical results.
The Copenhagen Interpretation and von Neumann Framework
The measurement state collapse postulate aligns with the Copenhagen interpre­
tation of quantum mechanics, primarily attributed to Niels Bohr and Werner 
Heisenberg. John von Neumann later provided a mathematically rigorous version of 
this perspective, delineating deterministic unitary evolution from non-deterministic 
measurement-induced collapse. While several interpretations of quantum mechanics 
exist, in this text, we adopt the von Neumann framework. Further discussions on 
various interpretations can be found in § 9.2.
Examples
Repeated Measurements with Photon Polarization
Figure 1.8: Repeated Identical Measurements

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons 
27
Figure 1.8 serves as a concrete example of this principle. Initially, the photons 
are unpolarized, implying a mixture of different polarization states. (We will discuss 
such mixed quantum states and their representation by density matrices in a later 
section.) When the photons pass through the first vertical polarizer, their states 
collapse to vertical polarization. Subsequent measurements with vertical polarizers 
will then result in a 100% transmission rate, without blocking or altering the photon 
states.
Cross-Polarizer Experiments
(b)
(a)
Figure 1.9: Measuring Photons Through Crossed Polarizers
Armed with the Measurement Postulate, we can elucidate the perplexing cross­
polarizer experiment discussed in § 1.2.3. Fig. 1.9 shows the quantum rendition of 
this experiment, where light is treated as a photon stream.
In part (a), we introduce unpolarized photons to a vertical polarizer. Approx­
imately 50% of the photons pass, consistent with a representation of unpolarized 
photons as being 50% in | V) and 50% in |H). Photons that do pass are forced into 
the vertical polarization state | V). Subsequent measurement using a horizontal po­
larizer yields a zero probability of passage, | (H|V) |2 = 0, aligning with experimental 
findings.
In part (b), a diagonal polarizer is inserted between the vertical and horizontal 
polarizers. The probability of photons in state |V) passing this diagonal polarizer 
is | (V|D) |2 = 50%. The photons that pass are then in state |D). Measuring these 
photons with a horizontal polarizer gives a passage probability of 50%, resulting in 
an overall probability of 50% x 50% x 50% = 12.5%, which matches the experimental 
observations.

1.5 The Quantum Measurement Postulate
28
The crux of this experiment lies in the Measurement Postulate-induced state 
collapse to |D) upon passing the diagonal polarizer. Absent this quantum mechanical 
feature, the photons would not navigate through all three polarizers in part (b), 
especially considering they are entirely blocked by just two polarizers in part (a).
1.5.3 * Statistical Average
In quantum mechanics, physical observables are represented by Hermitian operators 
M . The macroscopic measurements we make yield the statistical average of these 
observables, calculated in accordance with the postulates discussed earlier.
Consider the eigenvectors |Xi) of M. They form an orthonormal basis, allowing 
us to express a general quantum state as
| ^= 
ci | Xi}, 
(1.33)
where the coefficients ci are complex numbers satisfying 
|ci|2 = 1.
Upon measuring a superposition state using the operator M, the result is 
probabilistic. The possible outcomes are the eigenvalues Xi , each occurring with 
a probability Pi = | (Xi |^) |2. The statistical average of these outcomes can be 
calculated as:
(M} = 
PiXi = ^p KXi|^)|2Xi. 
(1.34)
Interestingly, this can be simplified to a basis-independent form:
Implication 3.6: Statistical Average
The statistical average (expected value, or expectation value) for measuring an 
observable M on a quantum state |^) is given by:
(M} = (^|M|^. 
(1.35)
To build intuition for this expression, consider the case where |X0) = |0), |X 1) = 
|1), and |$} = a |0) + fi |1).
(M} = | a |2 X 0 + | fi |2 X 1
= (^|0) (0|^] X0 + (^|1) (1 ^] X 1
= (^| (X0 |0><0| + X 111><1|) |^)
= (^ |M | ^,
where we have used the spectral decomposition property of Hermitian matrix M :
M = ^2 Xi |Xi)(Xi |. 
(1.36)
The general proof is similar to our simple example:

Example with Photon Polarization: Malus’ Law
Figure 1.10: Measuring Photons: Malus’ Law
To illustrate Eq. 1.35, we consider a scenario involving vertically polarized 
photons measured with a polarizer oriented at an angle 0, as depicted in Fig. 1.10. 
The state of the photon after passing through the polarizer can be described by
10} =cos 0 | V} + sin 0 | H} =
cos 0 
sin 0
(1.37)
The associated observable operator for the polarizer is given by
Me = 10) {01 =
cos2 0 
cos 0 sin 0
cos 0 sin 0 
sin2 0
(1.38)
To find the statistical average of Me , we apply Eq. 1.34:
(M} = K01V)|2 • 1 = cos2 0. 
(1.39)
Alternatively, using Eq. 1.35, we obtain
(M} = {V | Me | V) = cos2 0.
(1.40)
Both methods yield the statistical average as cos2 0, which confirms Malus’ Law: 
the output-to-input intensity ratio is cos2 0. Since light intensity is proportional to 
photon flux, this result provides a quantum-mechanical rationale for Malus’ law.

1.5 The Quantum Measurement Postulate
30
One may ask why we should prove Malus’ law using quantum mechanics when 
it can be explained using classical electromagnetic theory. There are several com­
pelling reasons. Firstly, using photons as an example helps develop a foundational 
understanding of quantum mechanics. Secondly, the quantum theory of photons is 
essential for exploring advanced quantum phenomena such as photon entanglement. 
Lastly, this example serves to illustrate how classical physics emerges as a statistical 
limit of quantum physics.
Exercise 1.14 Suppose we measure circularly polarized photons |L) with the 
polarizer Mg. Calculate the statistical average for this case.
Exercise 1.15 Suppose we measure | V) photons using a specialized device D rather 
than a polarizer. This device yields a +1 for photons polarized at an angle 0 and 
—1 for the orthogonal polarization at 0 + n/2. Calculate (D).
1.5.4 Quantum Interference
Quantum mechanics fundamentally challenges our classical understanding of waves 
and particles with its concept of wave-particle duality. This is beautifully encap­
sulated by the phenomenon of interference. Unlike classical interference, which 
involves the superposition of wave amplitudes, quantum interference incorporates 
the quantum State Postulate, which permits particles like photons to exist in super­
position states, and the Observables and Measurements Postulates, which govern 
the measurement of these superpositions.
Quantum Interference
Quantum interference is the phenomenon where particles like photons exist in 
superposition states and interfere with themselves upon measurement.
The simplest manifestation of quantum interference is the two-path interference. 
This phenomenon occurs when particles like photons or electrons have the potential 
to traverse two or more paths simultaneously and interfere with themselves. This 
mechanism serves as a cornerstone for studying quantum interference, entanglement, 
and the implementation of qubits.
1 
Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
The Mach-Zehnder interferometer, depicted in Fig. 1.11, is an exemplary experimental 
setup to observe photon two-path interference. Upon entering the interferometer, 
the photon encounters a beam splitter (labeled BS1), which is essentially a half 
mirror - with 50% transmission and 50% reflection. This device effectively splits 
the photon into two paths: the transmitted path A and the reflected path B .
i It is important to note a single photon can travel along two paths simultaneously, 
a phenomenon related to particle-wave duality. It is not that some photons travel 
in path A while others travel in path B. This has been extensively verified using 
“quantum eraser experiments” [ ].

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons
31
Figure 1.11: Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
The post-splitting superposition state is given by
| S) = -=(| A) + | B)),
(1.41)
where |A) and |B) represent the photon states along paths A and B, respectively.
Following the first beam splitter, the photon is in a superposition state and may 
accrue a phase shift 0 along path B relative to path A. This phase shift modifies 
the state to
|D) = -=(|A) + ei> |B)).
(1.42)
After traversing paths A and B , the photon encounters the second beam splitter 
(BS2). BS2 mixes the photon state from paths A and B and sends it to Detector 1 
and Detector 2. The photon detectors, coupled with BS2, effectively measure the 
photon state in the basis ^(|A) +1B)) = |S) and ^(|A) — |B)), commonly denoted 
as |+) and |—) in quantum computing. (The beam splitter itself is functionally 
equivalent to a Hadamard gate, a topic to be elaborated on later.) Specifically, the 
observable operator associated with Detector 1 in the figure is Ms = | S){S |, which 
leads to the following probability for detecting the photon in state | S):
P = K S | D )|2 =
i 
2 
i
2(1 + e^) =cos2 2.
(1.43)
Notice that P shows a sinusoidal dependence on ^. If ^ = n, the detection 
probability drops to zero, illustrating the principle of destructive interference.

1.6 The Uncertainty Principle
32
Exercise 1.16 Using the quantum formulation of two-path interference, calculate 
the interference pattern in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer if (a) only the first 
beam splitter, and (b) both beam splitters, have a split ratio of 40-60 instead of 
50-50.

Double-Slit Experiment
A related demonstration of photon two-path interference is the double-slit experiment, 
as depicted in Figure 1.12, where a single photon is fired at a barrier with two 
slits. Even though it’s a single photon, it acts as if it has gone through both slits 
simultaneously, creating an interference pattern on a detector screen beyond the 
barrier.

1.6 The Uncertainty Principle
The Measurement Postulate in quantum mechanics leads to several profound im­
plications, one of which is the Uncertainty Principle. Though historically known 
as the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP), it can be interpreted as a direct 
corollary of the Measurement Postulate.
The Uncertainty Principle has two forms. The first form distinguishes between 
compatible and incompatible observables. The second form presents the principle as 
a mathematical inequality. We will focus on the first version here, given its relevance 
to quantum computing.

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons 
33
1.6.1 Compatible versus Incompatible Observables
When performing a quantum measurement, the measured value is always an eigen­
value of the associated observable operator. Subsequently, the quantum state 
collapses to the corresponding eigenstate. Eigenstates of an operator represent states 
where measurement outcomes are certain, occurring with probability 1.
Two observables can either be compatible or incompatible, indicating whether 
both can be measured with 100% accuracy. This is often referred to as simultaneous 
measurements, although not necessarily at the same moment in time. Incompatibility 
between observables implies that measurements of one observable disturb those of 
the other. The Uncertainty Principle encapsulates this condition as follows:
The Uncertainty Principle
If operators A and B, representing two observables, do not commute, i.e., 
[A, B] = 0, then these observables cannot be measured simultaneously with 
perfect accuracy (i.e., with probability 1). In other words, they are incompatible.
Proof. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that A and B can be measured 
simultaneously with perfect accuracy. Then, there must exist a complete set of 
simultaneous eigenstates {| fai)}, satisfying:
A | fai} = ai | fai}, B | fai} = bi | fai}, 
(1.44)
where ai and bi are the eigenvalues of A and B respectively.
If A and B possess simultaneous eigenstates | fai), we have:
AB |fai) - BA |fai) = aibi |fai) - biai |fai) = 0• 
(1-45)
This implies that the commutator [A, B] = AB - BA = 0, contradicting our 
initial assumption [A, B] = 0.
Therefore, if A and B do not commute, they cannot have simultaneous eigenstates 
and thus cannot be measured simultaneously with perfect accuracy. 
□
Implications of the Uncertainty Principle
Oberservables A and B can be measured simultaneously
O [A, B] = 0
O A and B share eigenvectors {|fai)}
O A = Ei ai |fa)(fa|, B = Ei bi |^i)(fa.|-
Examples with Photon Polarization
To better understand the Uncertainty Principle in action, we can consider photon 
polarization as an illustrative example.

1.6 The Uncertainty Principle
34
Vertical and Horizontal Polarization
Suppose we aim to measure the vertical polarization |V) and the horizontal polar­
ization |HDo these observables commute? Indeed, they do:
A = Mv = 0
00
B = MH = 00
0
1
[A, B] = AB - BA = 0.
This means we can measure both | V) and |H) with 100% certainty.
Vertical and Diagonal Polarization
Now, consider measuring the vertical polarization | V) and the diagonal polarization 
|D >:
A = MV =
10
00
1
1
B = MD = 1 1
D 2 1
[A, B] =AB-BA=0.
Since [A, B] = 0, the observables for | V) and |D) are incompatible. In practice, 
if we measure | V) with 100% certainty, subsequent measurements for | D) will show 
both pass and block with 50% probability.
Applications in Quantum Communication: BB84 Protocol
In the context of the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, consider a 
string of photons with varying polarizations.
• Case 1: Vertical and Horizontal - A sequence like {H, V, V, V, H, V, H, ...} 
can be measured with either a vertical or horizontal polarizer, confirming the 
polarization of each photon with 100% certainty.
• Case 2: Diagonal - For a sequence {D, A, D, A, A, A, D, ...}, a 45^ or 135^ 
diagonal polarizer can measure the polarization states, since the states are 
orthogonal.
• Case 3: Mixture - If the sequence mixes vertical, horizontal, and diagonal 
polarizations, like {H, V, D, V, H, A, D, H, ...}, perfect measurement is not 
possible. This stems from the incompatibility of the observable operators for 
|V) and |D), as shown above.
Exercise 1.18 Show that the measurements of left circular polarization | L) and the 
diagonal polarization | D) are incompatible by demonstrating that their observable 
operators do not commute. Explain what happens when photons in state |D) are 
measured for circular polarization and diagonal polarization.
1.6.2 * The Uncertainty Inequality
The Uncertainty Principle can also be formally expressed in terms of standard devi­
ations of measurements for the operators A and B. This formulation is particularly 

Chapter 1. Quantum Mechanics Through Photons 
35
historical, often presented in the context of position and momentum or energy and 
time.
A A • A B > 11([ A,B ])|, 
(1.46)
where A A = \/ {A 2) — {A )2 and similarly for A B. Here, [ A, B ] = AB — BA 
represents the commutator of A and B .
This inequality form of the Uncertainty Principle is not an arbitrary construct; it 
stems from the mathematical foundation provided by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: 
| (u|v} |2 < (u|u} {v|v}■
Although the underlying mathematics are intriguing, we will not delve into those 
details in this text.

1.9 Summary and Conclusions
Foundational Principles
In this chapter, we have delved into the foundational principles that govern quantum 
computing and quantum information science (QCI). Our discussion emphasized the 
importance of understanding these principles, not just for theoretical clarity but 
also for practical applications.
We began by examining quantum states, described by normalized complex 
vectors in a vector space, setting the stage for the introduction of quantum bits 
or qubits. We explored the critical concept of superposition, which underlies the 
parallel computational capabilities unique to quantum systems.
We then transitioned to the discussion of quantum observables, represented 
by Hermitian operators. These operators define physically measurable quantities, 
and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are intimately related to the outcomes and 
probabilities of quantum measurements.
Next, we addressed the essential rules governing quantum measurements, focusing 
on the Born rule for calculating probabilities and the concept of state collapse 
post-measurement. We underscored the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum 
mechanics and the irreversible effect of measurements on quantum states.
Further, we discussed ancillary but important concepts such as quantum in­
terference, the uncertainty principle, and the lack of physical significance for the 
global phase of a quantum state. These discussions enriched our understanding 
of the subtleties and complexities involved in quantum mechanics and quantum 
computation.
General Framework
While our approach has been tailored towards two-level quantum systems like qubits, 
the principles discussed are general and applicable to higher-dimensional quantum 
systems as well. Throughout the chapter, we have presented examples using photons 
to make the concepts more relatable, without compromising on academic rigor.
Our framework positions QCI as an interdisciplinary field, combining insights 
from quantum physics, computer science, and mathematics. This multidisciplinary 
lens offers a more comprehensive understanding, preparing the reader for the rich 
and diverse landscape of quantum computing and information.
Upcoming Topics
In the upcoming chapters, we will initially focus on half-integer spins, another 
physical realization of a qubit system. Following this, we will introduce a general 
theoretical framework for qubits. Subsequently, we will explore the remaining

In this chapter, we explore the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics as they 
pertain to spin systems. Understanding the intricacies of spin is vital, particularly 
for fields that heavily rely on quantum mechanics, such as quantum computing. 
Along the way, we will introduce two essential tools: the Pauli matrices and the 
Bloch sphere.

2.1 Spin, Angular Momentum, and Magnetic Moment
42
2.1 Spin, Angular Momentum, and Magnetic Moment
In classical physics, objects like a spinning tennis ball possess angular momentum. 
This angular momentum is a vector quantity directed along the axis of rotation, 
and its magnitude can take continuous values. However, for quantum particles such 
as electrons, protons, and neutrons, as well as composite particles like atoms, the 
scenario is fundamentally different. The angular momentum of these particles is 
quantized and can only take discrete values. Moreover, these particles can have a 
permanent, non-zero angular momentum, as if they are perpetually spinning. This 
intrinsic form of angular momentum is known as spin.
Spin is a pervasive phenomenon in physics with a plethora of applications, 
including but not limited to electron microscopy, magnetic resonance, and quantum 
computation.
2.1.1 Fermions, Bosons, and Anyons
Particles can be classified into two broad categories based on their spin: fermions 
and bosons. Fermions have half-integer spins (1, 2, ...) while bosons possess integer 
spins (0, 1, 2, ...). Essentially all particles of conventional matter in our observable 
universe, including electrons, protons, and neutrons, are fermions. Photons, which 
are particles of light, have an integer spin of 1, classifying them as bosons. This 
distinction between integer and half-integer spins arises from the principles of special 
relativity, which dictate how particles’ wave functions transform under the Lorentz 
group.
In addition to fermions and bosons, there is another intriguing class of quasipar­
ticles known as anyons. Unlike fermions and bosons, which adhere strictly to integer 
or half-integer spin values, anyons exhibit more exotic behaviors in two-dimensional 
systems. Their spins can take on a range of values between integers and half-integers, 
leading to unconventional quantum statistics. Anyons are currently of great interest, 
especially in the burgeoning field of topological quantum computing, where they are 
considered as potential carriers of quantum information.
2.1.2 1/2 Spin
Particles with a spin of 1, such as electrons and some atomic nuclei, are of particular 
interest in the domain of quantum computing. As illustrated in Fig. 2.1, these 
particles exhibit two discrete quantum states, commonly termed as up and down 
states. These are mathematically represented by |f) and |j), or equivalently |0) and 
|1). The angular momentum corresponding to these states is Su = | and Sd = — |, 
where h is the reduced Planck constant.
In addition to serving as two-level quantum systems that can act as qubits, the 
mathematical framework that describes spin- 1 systems can easily be generalized to 
model qubits, forming a cornerstone for quantum computing algorithms.
One fascinating aspect of spin- 1 particles is their unusual rotational behavior. 
Unlike classical objects that return to their original state after a 360^ rotation, spin-2 
particles require a 720^ rotation for their wavefunction to return to its original state. 
This intriguing property, fundamentally linked to the topology of quantum states, 
significantly departs from classical expectations.

Given its significance in quantum computing, our subsequent discussions will 
concentrate primarily on spin- 2 systems.
2.1.3 Magnetic Moment
For charged quantum particles like electrons and protons, the intrinsic spin is 
associated with a magnetic moment. Mathematically, this magnetic moment is 
proportional to the spin, denoted as /t a S. This relationship is fundamental to 
technologies that exploit magnetic interactions, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI), quantum computing, and quantum sensing.
2.2 Spin-1/2 States and Pauli Matrices
2.2.1 Spin-1/2 States and Observables
Spin, as an intrinsic form of angular momentum, is represented by a vector in three­
dimensional space. For particles with spin-2, this vector assumes two quantized 
values, | and — |, in any chosen direction, where h is the reduced Planck constant. 
In the z-direction, these states are typically referred to as up and down, denoted as 
|0) = |f) and |1) = |j}, which constitute the computational basis. Mathematically, 
these states are defined as:
1
0
|0> =
|1> =
01.
(2.1)
The observable Sz , associated with measuring spin in the z-direction, has these 
states as its eigenstates, and | and — | as the corresponding eigenvalues. Sz can be 
represented through its spectral expansion as:
Sz = h |0><0| — h |1K1| = h Z,
where Z is the Pauli Z matrix, represented as
10 
0 —1
(2.2)
(2.3)

2.2 Spin-1/2 States and Pauli Matrices
44
In quantum computing contexts, we often work directly with Z instead of Sz , 
given that they differ only by a factor of |.
Similarly, in the x-axis, the state vectors are expressed as:

The associated observable is the Pauli X matrix:
X = |+X+| - l-)(-l =10
In the y-axis, the state vectors are:
|+ i) = -12(|0> + i |1)) = -12 [i
l-i} = 72(|0>- i |1» = -2 [-1 i
(2.5)
(2.6a)
(2.6b)
|+ i) and |— i) are often written as |i +) and |i-), 
The associated observable is the Pauli Y matrix:
or |i) and |—i) in other texts.

Exercise 2.1 Derive the matrix forms of Pauli matrices X and Y based on their 
bra-ket representations.
The specific forms of these state vectors are not arbitrary but are the result of 
insightful contributions from physicists, notably Pauli. These forms will be further 
justified in the subsequent discussion about general spin directions.
2.2.2 Properties of Pauli Matrices
Pauli matrices serve functions beyond acting as spin observables; they play a 
pivotal role in various domains of quantum computing and quantum physics. As 
such, a thorough understanding of their properties is crucial. These properties are 
highlighted below, with more details in Appendix D. (For succinct presentation of 
certain relations, Pauli matrices are often denoted as a 1 = X, a2 = Y, a3 = Z. In 
the following, we use a to represent any one of them.)
1. Hermitian Property: a^ = a.
2. Unitary: a^a = I.
3. Involutory Property: a2 = I.
4. Commutation Relation: [aj,ak] = 2iejklal, where Sjkl is the Levi-Civita 
permutation symbol.

Chapter 2. Fundamentals of Spin Systems
45
5. Anti-Commutation Relations: {ai,aj} = 2SijI, where Sij is the Kronecker 
delta function.
6. Algebraic Completeness: Pauli matrices (together with I) provides a complete 
basis for general matrices in C2x2.
7. Spin Angular Momentum: Pauli matrices represent the spin angular momentum 
operator in the x, y, and z directions with the correct rotation properties.
Why Complex Numbers?
One may wonder why one of the Pauli matrices contains i. Is it fundamentally 
necessary or just a matter of convenience? It turns out the presence of i is necessary 
for the Pauli operators:
1. to satisfy anti-commutation relation.
2. to generate the correct rotation properties of angular momentum for spin- 2 
particles.
3. to provide a complete, orthogonal basis for 2 x 2 Hermitian matrices.
Exercise 2.2 Given the eigenvectors |0) and |1) of Pauli matrix Z, |+) and |-) of 
X, and |+i) and |- i) of Y, prove that
(0| z 0 = 1, 
(1| z |1) = -1,

Provide a physical interpretation of these results in terms of measuring the X, 
Y, and Z components of spins oriented in various directions.
2.3 
 General Spin State Representation
*
In this subsection, we explore the representation of spin states and observables along 
a general direction in three-dimensional space. This direction is specified by u, a real 
unit vector with Cartesian components ux , uy , and uz , where u2x + uy2 + uz2 = 1. In 
spherical coordinates (see Fig. 2.2), u is described by the polar angle 0 and azimuthal 
angle $:
u =

2.3.1 * Defining the Spin Observable for Any Direction
The Pauli matrices X, Y, and Z represent the Cartesian components of the observable 
of an angular momentum, a three-dimensional vector. Consequently, the spin

observable along the direction of u can be expressed as:
S = uxX + uy Y + uz Z = sin 0 cos 0X + sin 0 sin 0Y + cos 0Z. 
(2.9)
Substituting X , Y , and Z with their respective matrices, we find:
S = Ou

(2.10)
To validate the definition of S in Eq. 2.9, the expected value (S) (see § 1.5.3) for 
a spin state should align with the Cartesian components of u:
(+| S |+) = ux = sin 0 cos 0, 
(-| S |- = - ux, 
(2.11a)
(+i |S|+ i) = uy = sin0 sin 0, (-i |S|-i) = -uy, 
(2.11b)
(0| S |0) = uz = cos 0, 
(1| S |1) = - uz. 
(2.11c)
These relations can be verified through the bra-ket notation using the results 
from Exercise 2.2 or by directly computing them in matrix form.
Exercise 2.3 Verify Eq. 2.11.
2.3.2 * Spin State in Any Direction
The eigenvectors of S in Eq. 2.10 are the spin states in the u and -u directions:

Spin State and Polarization State Correspondence
Even though spin and photon polarization are two distinct physical phenomena, they 
share many mathematical similarities because they both describe two-level quantum 
systems. In fact, various spin states can be mapped to photon polarization states, 
as listed in Table 2.2. The corresponding observables manifest as different matrices, 
because we assigned 1, 0 for photon polarization, while 1, —1 for spin states.
In this section, we extended the representation of spin states and spin observables 
to an arbitrary direction in three-dimensional space. Understanding these general 
representations sets the foundation for studying more advanced topics in quantum 
mechanics.

2.4 The Bloch Sphere
Recalling the expression for the generic spin state |+ u) from Eq. 2.12, we find that 
each state is specified by the polar angle 0 and azimuthal angle $. It is then natural 
to map each point on the surface of a unit sphere to a corresponding spin state |+ u 
Conversely, each possible spin state can also be represented as a point on this sphere. 
This sphere, known as the Bloch Sphere, serves as a geometrical representation for 
any qubit state |^), as shown in Fig. 2.3.

state |^) to a point on a unit sphere. The state |^) is parameterized by the 
polar angle 0 and azimuthal angle $:
|$} = cos 0 |0) + sin °-ei^ |1) = 
cos 2^ . 
(2.14)

[sm 2 ei:>
The expression for |^) in Eq. 2.14 is the same as for |+ u) but applies universally 
to any qubit state.
Note that we typically restrict 0 € [0 ,n] and $ € [0, 2n), recognizing that states 
(—0, $ + n) and (—0, $ — n) are equivalent to (0, $).
2.4.1 Key States on the Bloch Sphere
As depicted in Fig. 2.3, certain key states correspond to specific points on the Bloch 
sphere. Specifically, the north and south poles along the z-axis are associated with 
the |0) and |1) states, respectively. Eigenstates of the Pauli X operator, namely |+) 
and |—), map to points along the x-axis, while eigenstates of the Pauli Y operator, 
|+ i) and |— i), align along the y-axis.
It is worth noting that orthogonal states are positioned at antipodal points on 
the sphere, separated by an angle of 180^, rather than the 90^ one might intuitively 
expect. For instance, the orthogonal complement of a state |^) represented by (0,0) 
is found at (n — 0,n + 0) or (0 + n,0), up to a global phase of —1. This arrangement 
reflects the intriguing property of quantum spin, where a full rotation requires a 
720^ turn, not the classical 360^.
2.4.2 Representation of Pauli X, Y, and Z on the Bloch Sphere
The Pauli operators X , Y , and Z induce specific rotations on the Bloch sphere. For 
instance, the action of X on a state |0), transforming |0) to X |0), corresponds to 
a 180^ rotation about the x-axis. Similarly, applying Y and Z corresponds to 180^ 
rotations about the y-axis and z-axis, respectively. These rotations are illustrated 
in Fig. 2.4.
Note: A 180^ rotation on the Bloch sphere is associated with the action of the 
Pauli operators X , Y , or Z . Technically, this rotation is equivalent to applying a 
Pauli operator up to a global phase factor. However, such a global phase factor does 
not change the observable properties of a quantum state.
On the Bloch sphere, the effects of these rotations manifest as flips between 
certain basis states. Specifically, X swaps the states |0) and |1), and |+ i) and |— i); 
Z swaps |+) and |—), and |+i) and |—i); while Y swaps |0) and |1), and |+) and 
|— >•
Exercise 2.7 Verify the above transformations using bra-ket algebra, for example, 
confirm that X |+ i) = |—i), Y |+) = |—), and Z |—) = |+).
2.5 Spin Measurement
In this section, our focus shifts to the measurement of spins. While modern methods

2.5 Spin Measurement
50
are designed to suit various quantum computing platforms, the Stern-Gerlach (SG) 
experiment serves as a canonical approach for understanding spin measurement. 
This experiment provides vital insights into the quantization of angular momentum 
and serves as a foundational framework for more advanced measurement techniques. 
We begin by examining the key aspects of the SG experiment.
2.5.1 The Stern-Gerlach Experiment
The Stern-Gerlach experiment, a cornerstone in the study of particle spin, is pred­
icated on directing a beam of particles, such as electrons or atoms, through an 
inhomogeneous magnetic field (Fig. 2.5). Given the magnetic moments of these 
particles (§ 2.1.3), their different spin orientations cause them to deviate along the 
magnetic field gradient and register on a detection screen.
As depicted, the experiment primarily measures the Z observable, due to the 
magnetic field gradient being mainly along the z-axis. The observable Z has two 
eigenvalues, which correspond to the spin-up and spin-down states. While the initial 
spin state of the particles is random, the measurement collapses it to either spin-up 
or spin-down. Therefore, two distinct spots appear on the screen, in stark contrast 
to the continuous distribution one would expect for classical angular momentum.

Chapter 2. Fundamentals of Spin Systems
51
Figure 2.5: Stern-Gerlach Experiment
The original experiment, carried out by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach in 
1922 using silver atoms, conclusively revealed two separate spots, thus providing 
unequivocal evidence for the quantization of angular momentum and magnetic 
moment. This groundbreaking discovery laid the essential groundwork for the 
development of quantum theories.
The necessity of a magnetic field gradient in the SG experiment can be attributed 
to the dipole nature of the magnetic moment, which has the same orientation as 
the spin. In a uniform field, the potential energy depends on the orientation but 
is position-independent. A gradient in the magnetic field thus gives rise to a force 
that causes the observed deflection.
A Fascinating Story
Stern described an early episode (Source: Physics Today):
“After venting to release the vacuum, Gerlach removed the detector flange. But 
he could see no trace of the silver atom beam and handed the flange to me. With 
Gerlach looking over my shoulder as I peered closely at the plate, we were surprised 
to see gradually emerge the trace of the beam. ... Finally, we realized what [had 
happened]. I was then the equivalent of an assistant professor. My salary was too 
low to afford good cigars, so I smoked bad cigars. These had a lot of sulfur in them, 
so my breath on the plate turned the silver into silver sulfide, which is jet black, so 
easily visible. It was like developing a photographic film.”
The anecdote underscores a significant point about scientific research: sometimes, 
the path to discovery is not straightforward and may even be filled with seemingly 
trivial or random events that turn out to be pivotal. It serves as a testament 
to the resilience and ingenuity that are often required in the scientific journey. 
It is not just high-tech equipment or sophisticated theories that make for great 
science, but also an open mind, attention to detail, and the ability to adapt and 
learn from unexpected situations. In some instances, as comically illustrated by 
Stern’s account, the constraints or limitations we face might inadvertently lead 
us to meaningful insights, reaffirming the adage that “necessity is the mother of 
invention.”

2.5 Spin Measurement
52
2.5.2 Cascaded Stern-Gerlach Experiments
The Measurement Postulate can be well demonstrated using cascaded Stern-Gerlach 
experiments, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6. These cascaded setups are conceptually 
analogous to the cross-polarizer experiments detailed in § 1.5.2.
Figure 2.6: Cascaded Stern-Gerlach Experiments
In part (a), a beam of particles with random spin orientations is directed through 
a Stern-Gerlach apparatus (SGA) oriented along the z-axis. This first SGA measures 
the spin with respect to the Z observable and bifurcates the beam into two separate 
paths, each corresponding to one of Z’s eigenstates, |0) and |1), in a 50 : 50 ratio. 
The |0) beam is then directed to a second SGA, also oriented along the z-axis. At 
this stage, no particles will be detected in the |1) output, confirming that the first 
measurement collapsed the spin state to |0), which is orthogonal to |1).
Part (b) varies from part (a) by having the second SGA oriented along the x-axis. 
The measurement outcomes are |+) and |—), the eigenstates of the X observable. 
Given that | (0|+) |2 = | (0|-) |2 = 0.5, approximately 25% of the particles will be 
found in the |+) state.
In part (c), an additional SGA oriented in the x-axis is inserted between the two 
Z-oriented SGAs. Now, about 12.5% of particles are observed in the |1) output of the 
final SGA. This is because the middle X-oriented SGA forces the spins into |+) and 
|—) states, which then feed into the final Z-oriented SGA. This SGA subsequently 
splits the |+) state into |0) and |1) with a 50 : 50 ratio. The net probability of 
finding a particle in the |1) state is 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5 = 0. 125 or 12.5%, mirroring the 
behavior seen in the cross-polarizer experiments.
2.5.3 * Modern Spin Experiments
In quantum mechanics, measurement refers to the extraction of classical information 
from a quantum system. While early experiments such as Stern-Gerlach provided 
initial insights into quantum spin, contemporary approaches have significantly 
evolved, particularly with the advent of quantum computing. One of the leading 

Chapter 2. Fundamentals of Spin Systems
53
candidates for building qubits in a quantum computer is the use of spin-based qubits, 
which often rely on more advanced techniques for precise spin manipulation and 
measurement [58].
Spin-Based Qubits
Spin-based qubits are typically built using semiconductor quantum dots or trapped 
ions. The benefit of using these systems is that they offer a higher level of control 
and scalability. The challenge lies in accurately manipulating and measuring the 
spin states without undesirable interactions, which would disrupt the quantum 
information stored in the qubits.
Spin Precession and Rabi Oscillations
Two fundamental phenomena often employed in modern spin experiments are spin 
precession and Rabi oscillations. Spin precession refers to the motion of a quantum 
spin vector around an external magnetic field, much like the way a gyroscope 
precesses around an axis. Rabi oscillations involve driving transitions between 
different quantum states using an oscillating external field, commonly a microwave 
field. We will study these two phenomena in §§ 4.5.1 and 4.5.2.
Both phenomena are invaluable for spin manipulation in quantum computing. 
Spin precession allows for the precise control of qubit states by modulating the 
external magnetic field. On the other hand, Rabi oscillations are essential for 
implementing quantum gates, which are the basic operations in quantum computing 
algorithms.
Measurement Techniques
When a spin-1/2 particle, such as an electron, is measured along a specific axis, 
the orientation of its spin relative to that axis determines the outcome of the 
measurement. If the spin state is aligned with the measurement axis, the result is 
deterministic, yielding a definitive spin value (up or down along that axis). This 
principle underlies many modern spin experiments and is essential for confirming 
the theoretical predictions of quantum mechanics.
Advanced measurement techniques such as spin resonance and quantum non­
demolition measurements are also integral to the robustness of modern spin experi­
ments. These methods allow for the highly sensitive detection of spin states while 
minimizing the disturbance to the quantum system, thus enabling the extraction of 
reliable classical information.
Modern spin experiments have come a long way from their early counterparts, 
employing sophisticated methods for spin manipulation and measurement. These 
developments not only deepen our understanding of quantum mechanics but also 
pave the way for practical applications like quantum computing.
2.6 Summary and Conclusions
In this chapter, we laid the groundwork by introducing the essential elements of 
quantum spins, their states, and associated observables. A natural segue led us 
to explore the Pauli matrices, which serve as key observables for spin-1/2 systems. 
The significance of this subject matter is multifold; not only do spins constitute 
the basis for spin-based qubits, a prominent category of qubit implementations, 

Problem Set 2
54
but their study also fortifies our comprehension of the first three Postulates of 
Quantum Mechanics—namely, the state postulate, the observable postulate, and 
the measurement postulate.
Summary of Key Points
Our investigation started with an exploration of angular momentum, drawing 
distinctions between its classical and quantum characterizations. Through the 
resolution of eigenvalue equations for the Pauli matrices, X , Y , and Z , we were able 
to identify the eigenstates and eigenvalues, thereby building a robust mathematical 
framework for spin-1/2 systems.
Further, we engaged in a thorough discussion on general spin states and observ­
ables that can be aligned in any spatial direction. The geometric representation 
of these states was made transparent through the Bloch sphere, a construct vital 
for understanding the geometry of quantum states. The chapter closed with an 
examination of spin measurement techniques, from the pioneering Stern-Gerlach 
experiment to its modern-day variants, emphasizing their crucial role in the domain 
of quantum computing.
Implications and Applications
This chapter’s insights are not purely academic; they have wide-ranging practical 
implications, particularly in the burgeoning field of quantum computing. Techniques 
like Larmor precession and Rabi oscillations serve as the backbone of stable and scal­
able quantum circuits. Moreover, the principles elucidated herein have applicability 
that extends into additional sectors such as quantum cryptography and quantum 
communication.
Closing Remarks
Mastering the quantum behavior of spins provides us with a refined vocabulary for 
describing microscopic phenomena. This enriched understanding not only challenges 
traditional classical viewpoints but is also instrumental in the rapidly advancing 
realm of quantum technologies. In upcoming chapters, we aim to construct a more 
general theoretical framework that encompasses the descriptions and dynamics of 
qubits, laying the groundwork for deeper inquiries into the subject.

the cornerstone of quantum computing and quantum information systems. While 
the preceding chapters introduced key concepts using specific examples such as 
photons and electron spins, this chapter generalizes these ideas to accommodate all

forms of qubits. We also extend our discussion to include qudits, or general d-level 
quantum systems, where relevant.
Two focal topics—change of basis and quantum measurement theory—will be 
explored in depth. Quantum state tomography will be highlighted as a real-world 
application to demonstrate these principles.
This framework serves as an essential link, facilitating a smooth transition from 
fundamental concepts to more advanced topics in the quantum realm.
3.1 
Physical Qubit Systems
In the preceding chapters, we discussed photon polarization and 1 spins as forms 
of physical qubits, which are two-level quantum systems. However, there are 
several other platforms being actively explored for qubit implementation in quantum 
computing. Some of these are intrinsically multilevel systems but offer two states 
that can be effectively isolated, thereby enabling their use as qubits.
The following table (Table 3.1) provides a list of qubit platforms, along with the 
method of information encoding and the basis states relevant to each system. This 
table aims to give an overview of the breadth of qubit platforms currently under 
investigation, thus showcasing the versatility and adaptability of qubit systems.
These qubit implementations are currently subjects of intense research and 
development, each with its own set of advantages and limitations [52]. Factors such 
as noise rates, controllability, scalability, and cost vary significantly among different 
qubit platforms. While some may offer excellent controllability, others might excel in 
terms of low noise or cost-effectiveness. As the field of quantum computing continues 
to mature, it remains an open question which of these qubit implementations will 
emerge as the most practical and widely adopted for large-scale quantum information 
processing.
Exercise 3.1 Conduct an investigation into the qubit systems enumerated in 
Table 3.1 as well as others you come across. Your investigation should focus on 
the following aspects for each qubit system:
• Current state-of-the-art developments
• Advantages and disadvantages, including noise rates, controllability, scala­
bility, and cost
• Leading companies and research groups actively working on these platforms
Compile your findings into concise summaries for each qubit system to gain a 
comprehensive understanding of the current landscape of quantum computing.

3.2.1 General Qubit States
The State Postulate posits that the state of a quantum system is encapsulated 
by a unit vector within a Hilbert space. For qubits, this space constitutes a two­
dimensional complex vector space, denoted as C2 .
In the realm of quantum computing, the basis states for an individual qubit are 
typically represented as |0) and 11), reminiscent of the classical binary states 0 and 1. 
A general qubit state can be depicted as a linear combination of these basis states:
|^} = a |0) + fi |1). 
(3.1)
In this expression, a and fi are complex coefficients. Due to the necessity for the 
state vector to be normalized, we have the constraint |a|2 + |fi|2 = 1. This arises 
from |a|2 and |fi|2 representing the probabilities of measuring the qubit in states |0) 
and |1), respectively, and their cumulative sum equating to 1.
1 
Global Phase and Relative Phase
The phase of a complex number, represented as rei^, is indicated by the $ value. 
Introducing a global phase to a quantum state applies an identical phase factor to 
both basis states, which leaves the measurement probabilities of each state unaltered. 
Therefore, a state such as:
|^'} = ae
*
 |0) + fiei |1),
is congruent to |^), since both |aei^ |2 and |fiei^ |2 equate to their non-phased 
counterparts. Consequently, global phase lacks physical significance. However, 
relative phase is of importance as it can influence measurement outcomes across 
varied bases.
2 
Expressing Qubit States with Real Numbers
Acknowledging that global phase is non-consequential and that the state vector 
is normalized, it is feasible to convey a general qubit state using a mere two real 
parameters. Adopting the notations a = cos 2 and fi = sin 2 eiJ, we obtain:
| ^)=cos 2 |0)+sin 2 ei*  |1). 
(3.2)
With this parameterization, both the normalization condition and the relative 
phase factor are inherently satisfied.
Equation 3.2 mirrors |+u) from Eq. 2.12, illustrating a 2-spin oriented in the 
direction (0, $). Now this has been derived devoid of any explicit reliance on the 
intrinsic nature of the qubits.
Exercise 3.2 Show that the state |$) = a |0) + fi |1) represents a 2-spin oriented 
in the direction: &=(2Re(afi*), 2Im(afi*), |a|2 -| fi|2). 
(3.3)
3.2.2 The Orthogonal Partner
The state which stands orthonormal to |^) is:

3.2 Qubit and Qudit States
60
| ^ ±) = P * |0)- a * |1), 
(3.4)
ensuring both (^±|^±) = 1 and (^|^±) = 0. Here P* denotes the complex conjugate 
of P. It is worth noting that the analogous state ei^ |^±), especially — |^±), is also 
orthonormal to |^). In its (0,0) representation, we have:
|0±) = — sin 2 0 + cos 2ei^ |1), 
(3.5)
which corresponds to |—u) in Eq. 2.12.
Exercise 3.3 Given the states:

|^2) = -2|0)+

|&3) = — 2|0)—

prove that:
| (0 1|02} |2 = | (02|03} |2 = | (03|0 1} |2 = 1 ■
3.2.3 The Bloch Sphere
In § 2.4, we introduced the Bloch sphere in the context of electron spin. Beyond 
spin, the Bloch sphere provides a versatile visualization for general qubit states. 
Each point on this sphere represents a distinct qubit state, denoted as |0}. The 
vector emanating from the origin to this point, symbolized as u, is the Bloch vector. 
This vector is defined by two angles: the polar angle 0 and the azimuthal angle 0. 
Likewise, the state vector |0) is parameterized using these same angles. Fig. 3.1 
elucidates these definitions alongside highlighting key points on the sphere.
The expectation values of the Pauli spin operators X, Y, and Z in the state |0) 
(refer to Eq. 3.2) are given by:
{X) = sin 0 cos 0, 
{Y) = sin 0 sin 0, 
{Z) = cos 0^
(3.6a)
(3.6b)
(3.6c)
These coincide with the components of u, allowing |0) to be interpreted as repre­
senting the angular momentum of the spin in three dimemsions.
| Exercise 3.4 Prove Eq. 3.6.
An important detail to note is the presence of the term 2 within the formulation 
of |^). Moreover, it’s intriguing to observe that orthogonal states, such as |+) and 
|—), occupy antipodal positions on the sphere. This implies they are separated by 
an angle of 180^, contrary to the 90^ separation that might be more intuitively

* Qudit States
Qutrits and qudits denote quantum systems with more than two levels. While qubits 
are ubiquitous in quantum computing, qutrits (three-level systems) and qudits 
(general d-level systems) offer more intricate and potentially versatile quantum 
states. Various quantum systems, including superconducting qubits, Rydberg atoms, 
and NV centers, possess more than two inherent states. However, control, calibration, 
and maintaining coherence of these states become substantially more complex and 
demanding.
Despite these challenges, there’s growing enthusiasm in the research community 
to explore qudits as they present potential pathways for advanced quantum compu­
tational techniques. As the study progresses and whenever it benefits pedagogical 
discussions, the standard qubit framework will be broadened to include discussions 
on qudits.
In addition, an n-qubit system is mathematically equivalent to a d = 2n qudit. 
This equivalence means that formulations developed for qudits can also be applied 
to multiple qubits that are combined and treated as a single quantum system, 
broadening the applicability and relevance of qudit-based theoretical frameworks.
The general state of a qudit can be expressed as:
It) = E cj Ij), 
(3.7)
j=0
where Cj e C. This state’s normalization constraint is given by:

Exercise 3.5 * For the state |^) in Eq. 3.11, identify at least one vector from the 
set of d — 1 vectors that are orthonormal to it.
3.3 Change of Basis
Understanding qubit states and operators across different bases is fundamental to 
quantum computing. The importance of bases can be distilled into two primary 
considerations:
1. Perspectives for Quantum States: Alternate bases often illuminate novel 
perspectives on quantum states, offering insights pivotal for specific quan­
tum operations or algorithms. In this context, while the underlying physical 
quantum states and observables remain constant, their vector or matrix repre­
sentations undergo transformation. This idea can be likened to the classical 
concept of reference frames in Newtonian physics. Inspecting quantum states 
from varied “viewpoints” mirrors the act of changing the basis for the state 
vectors.
2. Quantum State Evolution as Basis Transformation: The operations of quantum 
gates or other unitary transformations on quantum states can be mathemat­
ically interpreted as a change of basis in the respective vector spaces. In 
quantum computing, we often work in the computational basis, but the quan­
tum state itself exists in a Hilbert space that can be represented in any 
orthonormal basis. Unlike the previous scenario, here the physical quantum 
states undergo genuine changes.

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits
63
The rudiments of basis change were introduced in § 1.4.5, utilizing photons as 
exemplars. This section will expand upon those foundational concepts, aiming to 
furnish a rigorous framework for changes in basis. In § 4.1, we will investigate the 
unitary time-evolution that can be viewed as a change of basis.
3.3.1 Changing Between |0) and |1) to |+) and |—) Bases
To build intuition, let’s examine a straightforward scenario.
1 
Quantum States in Two Bases
A single qubit’s quantum states are two-dimensional, necessitating a basis of two 
orthogonal, normalized states. The standard computational basis utilizes states |0) 
and |1). Meanwhile, the {|+), |—)} basis (often referred to as the Hadamard basis) 
defines them as:
+ = -12(|o> + |i», — = ^2(|0) — |i»-
(3.12)
A general qubit state in the computational basis, |^) = a |0) + fi |1), can be 
expressed in the {|+), | —)} basis as:
| 4} = a + fi
-2
+ + a-—2f |—) -
(3.13)
This provides new coefficients for the states in the revised basis.
Exercise 3.6 Express the 0, $ parametrized |^) given in Eq. 3.2 in the |+), |—) 
basis.
2 
Basis Transformation Operator
Transitioning from one orthonormal basis to another in quantum mechanics cor­
responds with a unitary operator, as unitary transformations preserve the inner 
product and hence the orthonormality of the basis. (See Appendix C for the defi­
nition and properties of unitary operators.) The basis transformation operator U 
for transitioning from {0, |1)} to {|+), |—)} corresponds to a quantum evolution 
where |0) transforms to |+) and |1) to |—). This operator takes a linear combination 
of states |0) and |1) to the corresponding combination of |+) and |—). Hence,
+ = U 0 , — = U |1). 
(3.14)
Consequently, the operator U is:
U = |+><0| + |—X1| - 
(3.15)
Proof. The definition of U provides:
+ = U |0>^|+><0| = U |0><0|, 
(3.16a)
— = U |1)^|—)(1| = U |1><1| - 
(3.16b)

3.3 Change of Basis
64
Combining the two equations gives:
|+><0| + |-X1| = U (|0><0| + |1><1|) - 
(3.17)
Utilizing the completeness property |0)(0| + |1)(1| = I, we deduce Eq. 3.15. □
Expanding Eq. 3.15, we obtain another expression for U that directly mirrors its 
matrix form:
U = -12(|0X0| + |0><1| + |1)(0|-|1)(1|) -
(3.18)
Exercise 3.7 Validate that U = ^ 1 
Eq. 3.14.

Applying U 1 to |+), |—) brings them back to |0), |1). Given that U is unitary 
(meaning U-1 = Ut):
0 = Uf |+), |1) = Uf - - 
(3.19)
Exercise 3.8 Verify that U in Eq. 3.15 is unitary using the bra-ket notation.
Hint: Ut = |0><+| + |1)(-|.
4 Basis Rotation
As depicted in Fig. 3.2, a basis change can be visualized as a rotation within the 
Hilbert space’s coordinate system. While the vector |^) stays physically unchanged, 
its components with respect to the new basis vary. This variation effectively presents 
the same quantum state but in a different mathematical form.
Figure 3.2: Basis Rotation {|0), |1)} ^ {|+), |—)}
Similar to how a geometric rotation preserves vector length and relative angles 
in the coordinate system, a basis change via a unitary transformation keeps the 
inner product intact. This preservation is the reason a change of basis is often 
conceptualized as a basis rotation.

Exercise 3.9 For a given quantum state |^) = 1 |+) + P^3 |—), compute its 
representation in {|0), |1)} basis.
6
Computing Vector Components through Projection
In addition to the matrix representation of the transformation operator U and its 
application to state vectors, there is an intrinsic method for calculating the amplitudes 
of a quantum state in a specific basis. This approach involves decomposing (or 
projecting) the state |^) into an orthonormal basis. For the standard basis {|0), 11)}, 
the state can be expressed as
|*)  = (0|*)|0) + (1|*)|1), 
(3.21)
where the components of |^) are the projections (0|^) and (1|^). With |^) = 
a |0) + P 11), these yield a and P as expected.
Similarly, for the basis {|+), |—)}, the state can be expressed as
|t> = <+|t>|+> + <-|t>H ,

* Change of Basis: Qudits
After acquainting ourselves with the fundamental principles and operations of basis 
change using the example {|0), 11)} ^ {|+), |—)}, we now extend them to general 
qudit systems, where the index (e.g., i or j below) extends to {0, 1, . . . , d — 1}.
Definition and Operator

3.3 Change of Basis
66
Given two complete and orthonormal bases {|bi)} and {|bii)}, their orthogonality 
and completeness relations are:
(bi|bj) = (bi|bj) = Sij, £ |bi)(bi| = £ |bi)(bi| = I. 
(3.24)
To change from the basis {|bi)} to {|bii)}, a unitary operator U is defined such 
that |bi) = U | bi). Specifically, U is:
u = E Ibi)(bi| = £ (bj|bi)|bj)(bi|. 
(3.25)
Exercise 3.10 Derive the formulas of U in Eq. 3.25 from its definition |bi) = U |bi).
Hint: see the proof for the {|0), |1)} ^ {|+), |—)} case.
2 Vectors and Matrices under Change of Basis
While physical properties, such as quantum states and observables, remain invariant 
across distinct bases, their vector or matrix representations are transformed by U 
upon a basis change.
A general qudit state |^) can be expressed in either of the bases:
|t> = E ci |bi) = £ ci |bi>. 
(3.26)
The coefficients or vector components of |^) are obtained as:
ci = (bi |^, ci = (bi |^. 
(3.27)
Considering {ci} as a column vector |c) and {cii} as |c'), we have:
|c) = U |c'), 
|c'} = Uf |c). 
(3.28)
Inner products are scalars and, therefore, remain constant across different bases:
(u'|v') = {u|v}, 
(3.29)
given that |u') = U^ |u} and |v') = Uf |v) according to Eq. 3.28.
Exercise 3.11 Prove the invariance of the inner product under a unitary transfor­
mation (see Eq. 3.29).
For an observable A, (u |A |u) represents the expected value (statistical average) 
of A in the state |u) (see § 1.5.3). It is also a scalar and, therefore, should remain 
constant across different bases. This requires the matrix form of A to transform 
according to:
A' = Uf AU.
(3.30)

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits
67
With this transformation, (u|A |u) is indeed invariant under a unitary transfor­
mation:
(u '| A '| u'} = (Uf u | Uf AU | Uf u} 
(3.31a)
= (u | UUf AUU f| u} 
(3.31b)
= (u|A|u}. 
(3.31c)
In § 3.4.4, we will demonstrate the basis independence of (u |A |u) through an 
example.
Exercise 3.12 Demonstrate that, if two observables commute in the original basis 
([A, B] = 0), they will also commute in the transformed basis ([UAU^, UBUt] = 
0).
3.3.3 * Change from Computational Basis to Eigenvector Basis
The action of transitioning to the eigenvector basis of a Hermitian operator is termed 
as “diagonalizing the operator”. This nomenclature stems from the fact that, in 
the eigenvector basis, the operator is represented as a diagonal matrix with its 
eigenvalues on the diagonal. Such a transformation finds significant applications in 
quantum computing. Prominent among these are the quantum phase estimation 
and Hamiltonian simulation algorithms. Furthermore, as discussed in § 3.4.5, 
measurements in quantum computing often employ such basis transformations.
Given H is a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues {Xi} and normalized eigenvec­
tors { $i}:
H |fa} = Xi |fa}, 
(3.32)
{fa} form a complete, orthonormal basis.
To change basis from the computational basis {|i)} to the H eigenbasis {|fa)}, 
we can use the unitary basis transformation operator U given by:
|fa) = U |i), U = 
|fa){i|. 
(3.33)
As a consequence of the spectral decomposition theorem, the matrix form of H 
is diagonal in the {| ^i)} basis:
H = Xi |^i)(^i|, 
(3.34)
while the matrix form of UtHU is diagonal in the computational basis:
UfHU = 
Xi |i}{i|. 
(3.35)
i

3.4 * General Formulation of Quantum Measurement
68
Eigenbases for Pauli Operators
The eigenbases of the Pauli operators play an important role in quantum computa­
tions and measurements.
• The eigenbasis for Pauli Z is the computational basis itself, consisting of the 
eigenvectors |0) and |1).
• The eigenbasis for Pauli X consists of the states |+) and |—). The unitary 
transformation relating this basis to the computational basis is the Hadamard 
operator H , defined as
111
\/2 1.1 -1
(3.36)
It can be verified that |+) = H |0) and |—) = H |1). In addition, the diagonal­
ization relationship Z = HXH holds. This basis is sometimes referred to as 
the X basis or the Hadamard basis.
Note that here, H corresponds to U from Eq. 3.33, and X corresponds to H 
from Eq. 3.32. We have repurposed H as it is the conventional symbol for the 
Hadamard operator.
• The eigenvectors of the Pauli Y operator are |+i) and |— i). For the eigenbasis, 
we often use the equivalent vectors |+i) and i |— i) for the convenience of 
calculation. The unitary operator that transforms from this eigenbasis to the 
computational basis is Rx (—n), also denoted simply as Rx. This operator is 
defined as (see § 5.2.5):
£[J i
Rx
(3.37)
One can verify that |+ i) = Rx |0) and i |— i) = Rx |1). Furthermore, the 
diagonalization relationship Z = RxYRx holds.
Exercise 3.13 Given the Hermitian operator:

(a) Find its eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors.
(b) If a system is in a state |^) = |0), express this state in the eigenbasis of A.
(c) Consider measuring the state |^) = |0) in the eigenbasis of A which is 
equivalent to measurement using A as observable. What are the probabilities 
associated with each eigenvalue?
3.4 * General Formulation of Quantum Measurement
Quantum measurement plays an essential role in quantum computing. It serves 
as the bridge that transfers information from the quantum realm to the classical 
world. Moreover, quantum measurement is an indispensable tool for investigating 
decoherence, a major source of error in contemporary quantum computing systems. 
Although intricate, mastering this topic is essential for understanding quantum 

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits 
69
system operations. In this section, we will formulate a general quantum measurement 
framework based on basic principles of observable and measurement in quantum 
mechanics discussed in Chapters 1 and 2.
3.4.1 Review of Basic Principles on Quantum Measurements
The Observable Postulate and the Measurement Postulate are two fundamental 
postulates in quantum mechanics that describe the behavior of quantum systems 
and the act of measuring those systems.
The Observable Postulate states that every observable quantity in quantum 
mechanics is represented by a Hermitian operator. An observable quantity is a 
physical property of a quantum system that can be measured, such as position, 
momentum, energy, or spin. The Hermitian operator associated with an observable 
quantity is called an observable operator, and its eigenvalues represent the possible 
outcomes of a measurement of that observable quantity.
The Measurement Postulate, on the other hand, describes the process of mea­
suring an observable quantity of a quantum system. According to the Composition 
Postulate, the act of measuring an observable quantity of a quantum system will 
cause the system to collapse into one of the eigenstates of the observable operator 
associated with that observable quantity, and the corresponding eigenvalue will be 
the result of the measurement. This collapse is also known as the wavefunction 
collapse, and it is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics.
These postulates lay the groundwork for understanding quantum measurement in 
its most straightforward form. However, modern quantum computing and quantum 
information often employ more advanced measurement schemes such as POVM 
(Positive Operator-Valued Measure), weak measurements, and nondestructive mea­
surements. In order to accommodate such complex scenarios, it is necessary to 
extend these standard postulates into a general quantum measurement framework.
3.4.2 * A General Measurement Framework
Quantum measurements are typically characterized by a set of measurement operators 
{Mi }, representing potential measurement outcomes.
1 
Measurement Probability
Given a quantum system in state |^), the probability of realizing outcome i upon 
measurement is:
Pi = (^ |Mi Mi |^. 
(3.38)
This formula mirrors the squared magnitude of the vector Mi |^), denoted as 
IIMi It)II2.
The product Mi! Mi is positive semidefinite, that is, a Hermitian matrix with 
non-negative eigenvalues, ensuring all probabilities Pi > 0.
Exercise 3.14 Demonstrate that a matrix defined as Mi! Mi is positive semidefinite.

3.4 * General Formulation of Quantum Measurement
70
For the total probability to sum up to 1, i.e., 
Pi = 1, the operators {Mi} must
adhere to the completeness condition:
Em/M = I.
(3.39)
Exercise 3.15 Show that when Mi meets the completeness requirement Eq. 3.39, 
the sum Pi Pi equals 1.
In this broad portrayal of quantum measurement, the operators {Mi} need not 
be orthogonal.
2 
Measurement Average
If a numerical value Xi corresponds to each Mi, the expected value of A is:
(A} = EpiXi = E (^|Mi Mi|^} Xi. 
(3.40)
3 
Post Measurement State
A salient feature of quantum measurement is the alteration of the quantum state 
upon measurement. After the measurement, the system transitions to:
. . 
Mi | ^
| fr. ■ 
(3.41)
Pi
The factor VP in the denominator guarantees the normalization of |^i), ensuring 
it remains a legitimate quantum state.
4 
Measurement Probability via State Overlap
The likelihood of observing a specific measurement result can be deduced from the 
overlap (inner product) of the pre- and post-measurement states:
Pi = K fr | * )|2. 
(3.42)
Exercise 3.16 Using Eq. 3.41, confirm that the probability of measuring |^) and 
subsequently obtaining |^i) is given by Eq. 3.42.
5 
Non-Unitary Transformation
It is pertinent to point out that Eq. 3.41 does not generally represent a unitary 
transformation, underscoring a distinctive trait of quantum measurement. Should we 
perform back-to-back measurements with the identical Mi on the post-measurement 
state (assuming no intermediate state alterations, excluding general POVM mea­
surements), outcomes will be consistent, and the state remains unperturbed.

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits 
71
6 
POVM Measurements
The measurement framework outlined here can be extended to the Positive Operator­
Valued Measure (POVM) formalism. In the POVM context, the focus is on the 
measurement outcomes rather than the state of the system after the measurement 
has been performed. Thus, {Mi Mi} is replaced with a set of POVM operators {Ei}, 
each being a positive semidefinite Hermitian operator that corresponds to a potential 
measurement outcome, with Ei = I . Note that given Ei , its decomposition
Ei = Mii Mi is non-unique. All the preceding equations in this section are still valid 
except Eq. 3.41.
3.4.3 * Projective Measurements for Observables
In light of our general formulation, measurements pertaining to a quantum observable 
emerge as a special case known as projective measurement.
Consider an observable H , represented by a Hermitian operator. This operator 
possesses a collection of real eigenvalues Xi with corresponding eigenvectors | $i 
These eigenvectors construct a complete orthonormal basis. Accordingly, the mea­
surement operators Mi become the projection operators associated with the basis 
states | $i}:
Mi =ni = |fa)(fa |. 
(3.43)
Being projection operators, beyond the completeness relationship in Eq. 3.39, 
the set {Mi } adheres to the orthogonal and idempotent properties:
MiMj = §ij Mi. 
(3.44)
| Exercise 3.17 Validate Eq. 3.44.
Exercise 3.18 Employing the relationship 5^ |fa){fa | = I, verily that Eq. 3.39 is
valid for projective measurements.
Subsequently, the probability formula in Eq. 3.38 for acquiring outcome Xi is 
recast as:
Pi = {* |n i | *)  = K * | fa )|2. 
(3.45)
Likewise, the formula for the expected value of M in Eq. 3.40 transforms to:
(H) = £ PiXi = (^|H|^, 
(3.46)
making use of the spectral decomposition property H = ^^ Xi | fa) (fa |.

3.4 * General Formulation of Quantum Measurement
72
Exercise 3.19 Confirm that Eq. 3.40 yields Eqs. 3.45 and 3.46.
Finally, the post-measurement state from Eq. 3.41 simplifies to 10i). In this sense, 
the projection operator essentially selects the respective basis state, i.e., projects 
the original state onto the basis state.
Our discussions highlight that when the measurement operators {Mi } are projec­
tion operators linked to the eigenstates of an observable, the overarching measurement 
framework naturally aligns with observable-centric measurement.
3.4.4 * Basis-Dependent Measurements
Basis dependence is an essential facet of quantum measurement. When quantum 
systems are measured in different bases, their outcomes differ based on the chosen 
basis.
To elucidate, a quantum state measured in a specific basis is essentially being 
measured against that basis’s states. For instance, when measuring the state 
|^) = a |0) + 0 |1) in the computational basis, it splits into post-measurement states 
|0) and |1), with associated probabilities of |a|2 and |0|2. This phenomenon is 
depicted in Fig. 3.4, part (a).
In a similar vein, if |^) is measured in the {|+), | —)} basis, as illustrated in part 
(b), it results in post-measurement states |+) and | —) with probabilities 1 a +P1 and 
I a - P |2
2 
.
Figure 3.4: Measurements in {|0), |1)} and {|+), | —)} Bases
Traditionally, distinct bases measurements correspond to different observables. 
For the purpose of quantum computing, let’s assign +1 and -1 as standard mea­
surement values. Thus, the pertinent observables can be expressed as:
M0,1 = |0><0| — |1)(1| 
= Z, corresponding to the {|0), |1)} basis; 
(3.47a)
M+,- = |+)(+| — |—X-| = X, associated with the {|+), |—)} basis. 
(3.47b)
Given this convention, the measurements in the provided example can also be 
dubbed as the Z and X measurements.
When an observable M undergoes measurement in different bases, its expected 
value, (M), remains constant (see § 3.3.2). In the above example, the expected value 
of X calculated in the {|+), |—)} basis through probability argument is

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits 
73
(X} = (+1) P+ + (-1) P- = |a +2 $ |2 - |a —2 $ |2 = a$ * + a * $. 
(3.48)
But as demonstrated in § 1.5.3, (X) is given by (^|X|^), which is independent 
of the measurement basis. Indeed, one can verify that (^ | X | ^) = a$ * + a * $ by 
computing the inner product directly in the computational basis.
Exercise 3.20 The expected value of Z calculated through a probability argument 
is:
(Z) = (+1)Po + (-1)Pi = |a|2 - |$|2.
(3.49)
Verify (^|Z|^) yields the same value in both the computational and {|+), |-)} 
bases.
3.4.5 * Measuring in Alternative Bases
In quantum computing, the computational basis is the de facto standard for mea­
surements, primarily due to the native support from most quantum hardware. Yet, 
certain scenarios call for measurements in non-computational bases. In such in­
stances, unitary transformations, or basis rotations, are employed to shift to the 
desired basis before carrying out the measurement.
Suppose one wishes to measure a qudit state, denoted as |^), within an orthonor­
mal basis {|&)}. The initial task is to identify a suitable unitary transformation, 
represented by U , that facilitates the transition from the targeted measurement 
basis {|&i)} to the computational basis {|i)}, up to a global phase factor:
U = 
|i){& |. 
(3.50)
Upon establishing U, the subsequent step involves measuring the state U |^) 
within the computational basis. Interestingly, the outcome probabilities yielded from 
this process mirror those obtained by measuring |^) directly in the {| &i)} basis. The 
congruence of the results can be verified as follows:
Pi = |( i | U | ^ )|2 
(3.51a)
2
= 52 < i | j >< & | ^ 
(3.51b)
j
= |(&i|^)|2 . 
(3.51c)
{|^i>}
{|i>}
^
If) — U — 
= Pi
An essential distinction to highlight is that, post-measurement, the state achieved 
in the computational basis, |i), does not coincide with the anticipated state, |&i 
within the chosen measurement basis. Nevertheless, within the quantum computing 
context, this incongruence is typically inconsequential since the primary emphasis 

3.4 * General Formulation of Quantum Measurement
74
is on obtaining the measurement readout. If a scenario necessitates the post­
measurement state, employing U^ effectively transforms |i) into the desired state:
Uf |i) = E I<hXj |i) = |ti. 
(3.52)
This strategy for conducting measurements in non-standard bases finds a notable 
application in the Bell measurement, a topic we shall delve into in § 8.4.
3.4.6 * Sampling Errors
In quantum computing, we often execute a quantum circuit repeatedly to obtain 
the empirical expectation values of certain observables (see § 1.5.3). Due to the 
finite number of runs for the circuit, empirical values may deviate from theoretical 
exp ectation values. This deviation is known as the sampling error.
In this subsection, we will use the Pauli operators (X , Y , Z) to demonstrate 
this important aspect of quantum measurement. The Pauli operators are unique in 
that they are both unitary and Hermitian, enabling them to serve as both quantum 
gates and observables.
1 
Z Measurement
A measurement in the computational basis is equivalent to measuring the Z observ­
able. In this scenario, the readout can be assigned a value of +1 for |0) and —1 for 
|1), as illustrated in the subsequent diagram. Through a collection of such readouts, 
we can calculate the empirical expectation value and variance of Z , and estimate 
the sampling error, as will be discussed next.
±1
| $}---- ^ ($ | Z | $')
2 Expected Value
Assume a quantum state |^) = a |0) + fl 11). The theoretical expectation value for 
the Z observable is
(Z) = (j> | Z | j>} = | a |2 — | fl |2 = 2| a |2 — 1, 
(3.53)
since |a|2 + |fl|2 = 1.
To compute this empirically, the circuit is run N times with each measurement 
readout zi e {±1}. The empirical expectation value is then:
(Z> 
zi. 
(3.54)
i=1
3 Standard Deviation
Sampling error pertains to the deviation of the empirical (Z) from the theoretical 
value. The standard deviation serves as an estimate for this error.

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits 
75
The theoretical variance of the observable Z in the state | ^) is given by
(AZ)2 = (Z2) - (Z)2 . 
(3.55)
Given that (Z2) = |a|2 + |P|2 = 1, the theoretical variance for the Z observable 
in this state becomes
2 
2 
2 
22 
2
(AZ) =1 -(Z) =1 - (|a| -|p|) =4|ap|. 
(3.56)
And consequently, the theoretical standard deviation is:
AZ = 2|ap|. 
(3.57)
Figure 3.5: Plot of AZ as a function of |a|
The relationship between AZ and |a| is depicted in Fig. 3.5. This curve 
elucidates the statistical nature of quantum measurement. When |a| = 0.5, the 
standard deviation AZ reaches its maximum value of 1, while the mean (Z) is zero. 
In addition, when |^) is a basis state—corresponding to cases where either a = 0 or 
p = 0—the standard deviation AZ is zero. This behavior is in agreement with the 
established principle that basis states can be measured with zero uncertainty.
4 
Sampling Error of the Mean
The sampling error for the expected value (Z) is usually characterized by the 
standard error of the mean (SEM), expressed as:
SEM< z = —=
(3.58)
where AZ is the standard deviation of the individual measurements and N is the 
total number of measurements. Thus,
SEM( Z > = 201
(3.59)
As the number of measurements N becomes large, the standard error of the mean 
(SEM) approaches zero. This indicates that the empirical average (Z) converges to 
the true expected value.

3.4 * General Formulation of Quantum Measurement

Exercise 3.21 Consider a collection of N qubits, each in the state |^) = a |0) + fi 11). 
If the goal is to measure the expected value (Z) with a 99% accuracy, what is the 
minimum value of N required to achieve this level of precision?

X Measurement
Measuring the X observable corresponds to making measurements in the {|+), |—)} 
basis. If the quantum state is expressed as |^) = a |+) + b |—), the equations 
developed for Z measurement remain applicable. However, the coefficients a and b 
are related to a and fi via:
a = 712(a + fi), b = T2(a -fi).
(3.60)
The relationship between a and b with a and fi allows us to translate the 
expected values and standard deviations calculated in the {|+), |—)} basis to the 
computational basis, and vice versa.
Exercise 3.22 Derive formulas for the theoretical standard deviation (AX) for 
the X observable in terms of a and fi.
As elaborated in § 3.4.4, meauring in the {|+), |—)} basis can be done by 
transforming the quantum state with the basis-change unitary operator (here the 
Hadamard operator H) before measuring in the computational basis. Through 
repeated readouts, we can calculate the empirical expectation value X and estimate 
its sampling error, similar to our preceding discussion for Z .

3.4.7 * Advanced Topics in Quantum Measurements
The preceding quantum measurement framework can be extended to include more 
complex scenarios such as POVMs, weak measurements, and nondestructive measure­
ments, which allow for greater flexibility and applicability in quantum information 
science.
POVM: In quantum information and computation, POVMs are often used to 
model more complex measurement scenarios, including noisy or partial measurements. 
They are particularly useful in the context of open quantum systems, where they 
describe the various possible outcomes of measurements on systems interacting with 
their environment.
Weak Measurement: Traditional measurement collapses the state vector into 
one of the eigenstates of the observable. Weak measurements, on the other hand, 
only slightly perturb the quantum state, yielding only partial information about the 
observable. Weak measurements can be understood as a statistical limit of a series 
of less invasive measurements.

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits
77
Nondestructive Measurements: The Measurement Postulate implies that a mea­
surement fundamentally changes the state of the system. Nondestructive measure­
ments try to sidestep this by obtaining information about the quantum state without 
significantly altering it, which is particularly useful in quantum error correction and 
certain quantum computation protocols.

3.5 
 Application to Quantum State Tomography
*
The topic of this section is quantum state tomography, a powerful technique used to 
reconstruct the state of a quantum system. We apply the frameworks developed in 
this chapter on quantum states, basis transformation, and quantum measurements 
to this process, providing a cohesive case study.
Quantum state tomography involves reconstructing unknown quantum states 
based on measurement outcomes. As an illustrative example, let’s assume we have 
N = 2000 qubits, all in an identical, yet unknown state, |^). These qubits are 
divided equally between Alice and Bob, with each receiving Na = 1000 qubits. Alice 
measures her qubits in the computational basis, {|0), |1)}, and observes Na0 = 241 
qubits in the |0) state. Conversely, Bob uses the {|+), |—)} basis and detects 
Nb + = 852 qubits in the |+) state.
3.5.1 * Extracting Parameters from Alice’s Measurements
From § 3.2, we know that a general qubit state expressed in the {|0), |1)} basis can 
be represented as:
|^) = cos 2 |0) + sin 2ei^ |1). 
(3.61)
Given this, the measurement probabilities for the states |0) and |1) are, respec­
tively, P0 = cos2 2 and P1 = sin2 2. Using these probabilities, 0 can be deduced 
from the difference P0 - P1 :
cos0 = P0 - P1. 
(3.62)
From Alice’s data, we deduce:
241 P ~ 1000 - 241
1000, 
1 ~ 
1000
(3.63)
This results in an approximate value of 0 ~ 2. 12 radians.
3.5.2 * Extracting Parameters from Bob’s Measurements
Given the state in the {|+), |—)} basis, the expression becomes:

3.6 Summary and Conclusions
78
cos | + e!i^ sin I cos | — ei^ sin I 
I4=T------ 2 + +-----T------ 22 I— ■ 
(3.64)
From this expression, using the difference in probabilities P+ — P- , we can derive 
cos $ sin 0:
sin 0 cos $ = P+ — P- ■ 
(3.65)
Exercise 3.23 Derive Eq. 3.65 starting from Eq. 3.64.
From Bob’s observations, we gather:
P ~ 852 P ~ 1000 - 852 
+ ~ 1000, 
- ~ 
1000
(3.66)
With 0 previously derived from Alice’s measurements, we can calculate $ using 
Eq. 3.65, arriving at 0 ~ 0■604.
3.5.3 * Reconstructing the Quantum State
With the deduced values of 0 and $, the original quantum state can be reconstructed 
using Eq. 3.61:
|^} ra 0■ 49110) + 0■ 871 e0•604i |1) ■ 
(3.67)
Exercise 3.24 * Sampling Errors (See § 3.4.6)
Quantum measurements inherently exhibit stochastic behavior, leading to only 
approximate acquisition of P0, P1, P+ , and P- through repeated measurements. 
This phenomenon is termed sampling error. The precision of these values is 
related to the sample size N, i.e., the number of measurements. Such sampling 
intricacies are endemic to quantum computing.
(a) Deduce the average sampling errors for P0, P1, P+, and P- in terms of N, 
Na, Nb, etc.
(b) Calculate the average sampling errors for 0 and $.
(c) For the illustrated scenario, how large should N be to ensure the errors in 
0 and $ remain within a 0 ■ 1% threshold?
3.6 Summary and Conclusions
Comprehensive Framework for Qubits and Qudits
In the current chapter, we embarked on a journey to build a comprehensive framework 
for qubits and qudits. Serving as the backbone of quantum computing and quantum 
information systems, qubits and their generalized counterparts, qudits, are integral 
to our understanding of quantum phenomena. The chapter’s aim was to transcend 
the limitations of specific examples like photons and electron spins, and to present a 
universal model that caters to the broad spectrum of qubit manifestations.

Chapter 3. A Framework for Qubits and Qudits
79
The topics of change of basis and quantum measurement theory were given 
special emphasis, not only for their theoretical significance but also for their practical 
applications in quantum computing. This chapter’s examination of quantum state 
tomography illustrated the tangible applications of the aforementioned principles, 
highlighting their relevance in real-world scenarios.
Physical Manifestations and Mathematical Models
The diverse platforms that are actively being researched for qubit implementation 
underscore the versatility and adaptability inherent to quantum systems. We 
presented an overview of these platforms, drawing attention to their distinct methods 
of information encoding and their specific basis states.
Despite these various physical representations, a unified mathematical model 
for qubits emerged, anchored firmly in the tenets of quantum mechanics. This 
mathematical abstraction enables us to draw parallels across different qubit systems, 
underscoring the universal principles that underpin them.
Basis Rotations and Unitary Transformations
A considerable portion of this chapter was allocated to understanding quantum 
states and operators across diverse bases. The importance of bases in quantum 
mechanics was likened to reference frames in classical physics, offering readers a 
familiar touchstone. At the heart of our discourse is the concept that changing 
a basis aligns with a unitary transformation. We explored the transformation of 
vectors, operators, inner products, and operator averages in-depth.
This detailed inspection of basis changes proves invaluable in two key areas: 
firstly, alternate bases often shed light on nuanced insights into quantum states, 
proving essential for understanding quantum operations or algorithms. Secondly, 
operations triggered by quantum gates or other unitary transformations can be 
construed as a change of basis within the associated vector spaces. While both 
scenarios revolve around a change of basis, the nuances distinguishing them are 
subtle.
A General Formulation for Quantum Measurement
Our dialogue transitioned towards a generalized formulation of quantum measure­
ments, rooted in the observable and measurement postulates of quantum mechanics. 
This discussion sets the stage for future explorations into decoherence, as well as 
advanced measurement strategies like POVM and weak measurements prevalent in 
contemporary quantum computing and quantum information contexts.
A salient insight was recognizing that the observable-based measurements, de­
tailed in previous chapters, represent a specific case within the expansive framework 
of quantum measurement: the projective measurement.
Additionally, we embarked on a comprehensive examination of measurements 
across varying bases, augmenting our understanding of the quantum observation 
process through diverse reference frames.
Upcoming Topics
Having established a robust foundation on qubits and qudits, their physical em­
bodiments, and the mathematical structures characterizing them, we are poised to 
explore the dynamics of quantum systems. The forthcoming chapter will address the 

Problem Set 3

temporal evolution of quantum states. Governed by the Schrodinger equation, the 
dynamics of qubit systems holds the key to understanding the mechanisms by which 
quantum information is processed, manipulated, and observed, especially through 
the lens of quantum gates and circuits.
Our journey will initially concentrate on the dynamics of a single qubit. This will 
set the stage to navigate the complexities of multi-qubit systems, entanglements, and 
interactions. These foundational discussions will be instrumental as we transition to 
more advanced realms, such as quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, and 
the architectural design of extensive quantum systems.

In the preceding chapters, we have explored how a qubit’s state is represented by 
its state vector. As we extend our discussion to include the dynamics of qubits, we 
encounter the question of how a qubit’s state evolves over time. Such evolution can 
result from various interactions, like the application of a quantum gate or quantum 
annealing processes. These interactions drive the changes we observe over time, 
which are described as the dynamics of quantum systems.

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
83
In the realm of quantum mechanics, dynamics pertains to the evolution of 
quantum states as a result of physical interactions. The equations and principles of 
quantum mechanics provide the framework for understanding this evolution. They 
allow us to predict and analyze how quantum states change, interact, and develop 
over time, which is fundamental to both the theoretical understanding and practical 
applications of quantum physics.
The dynamics of a quantum system is principally governed by the Evolution 
Postulate of quantum mechanics, a fundamental theorem dictating how quantum 
states evolve temporally. For qubit systems, this evolution is predominantly governed 
by the Schrodinger equation. Mastery of this fundamental equation is paramount to 
comprehending the intricate mechanisms by which quantum information is processed, 
manipulated, and observed in a wide array of quantum systems.
In this chapter, the exploration will introduce the general concepts of the dy­
namics of quantum system, using examples of a single qubit. Subsequent chapters 
will broaden this examination to encompass systems of multiple qubits, probing 
their interactions, entanglements, and the means by which their dynamics can be 
both controlled and exploited for potent computational tasks. This foundational 
comprehension of the dynamics of qubits will act as a nexus to more advanced 
subjects such as quantum algorithms, quantum error correction, and the architecture 
of large-scale quantum systems.
4.1 The Evolution Postulate of Quantum Mechanics
The Time Evolution Postulate is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics, 
describing how quantum states change over time.
Postulate 4: Time Evolution
The time evolution of the state of a closed quantum system is governed by a 
unitary transformation.
Mathematically, we can express this Postulate as:
|^(t)} = U(t) |^(0)), 
(4.1)
where |^ (t)) is the quantum state of the system at time t, U (t) is the time-evolution 
operator that describes how the state at time t = 0 evolves to the state at time t, 
and |^ (0)) is the initial state of the system.
The necessity of the time-evolution operator being unitary in a closed quantum 
system stems from the conservation of total probability, which must remain equal 
to one. Essentially, a quantum state vector must always be normalized since its 
components represent probability amplitudes, and their square sum must equal 
one. As the quantum state naturally evolves over time, this normalization must be 
preserved. Unitary transformations fulfill this requirement by maintaining the inner 
product, thus ensuring the coherence and consistency of the behavior of the system.

4.2 * The Schrodinger Equation 
84
4.1.1 Properties of Unitary Transformation
Unitary transformations are fundamental to quantum mechanics as they govern 
the evolution of the states of closed quantum systems. They are also essential in 
quantum computing, possessing several key properties that enable quantum state 
manipulation. For simplicity, we will denote U (t) as U in the following discussion.
1. Preservation of Inner Products: The overlap of two quantum states, |t) and 
|^), remains invariant under the same unitary evolution. Explicitly,
(Uf|u^) = {t| uf u |*)  = {t|*).  
(4.2)
A consequence of this property is that an orthonormal basis remains orthonor­
mal under a unitary evolution.
Moreover, as | (11^) |2 represents the probability of measuring state 11) in 
state |^), or vice versa, such probabilities remain unchanged under unitary 
evolution, preserving the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.
2. Reversibility: Unitary transformations are reversible, meaning that they can 
be undone by applying the inverse transformation using u-1.
3. Linearity: Superposition principle holds during the unitary evolution. A 
unitary transformation applied to a superposition of quantum states results in 
a superposition of transformed states.
4. Unit Eigenvalues: The eigenvalues of a unitary transformation are complex 
numbers with an absolute value of 1.
5. Orthonormal Row and Column Vectors: The column vectors of a unitary 
matrix form an orthonormal set, and the same applies to the row vectors when 
transposed.
Unitary transformations can be interpreted as a change of basis in Hilbert space, 
effectively rotating the quantum state vector while preserving the structure of the 
space. In particular, quantum gates apply unitary transformations to quantum 
states. While computations are commonly performed in the computational basis, 
quantum states exist in a Hilbert space representable in any orthonormal basis. See 
§ 3.3.2 for an in-depth discussion on the change of basis concept.
4.2 
 The Schrodinger Equation
*
The Schrodinger equation is a cornerstone of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, 
governing the time evolution of quantum states in systems like electrons in atoms, 
quantum dots, and superconducting qubits. This equation links the time-dependent 
evolution of a quantum state to the system’s Hamiltonian operator, often simply 
referred to as the Hamiltonian, H . The Hamiltonian represents the total energy 
observable of the system and thus acts as a crucial connection between the abstract 
quantum state and measurable physical quantities, like energy levels.
The Schrodinger equation is expressed as:
ihd |^(t)) = H(t) |^(t)), 
(4.3) 

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
85
where |^(t)) is the quantum state vector at time t, and h is the reduced Planck 
constant.
While we will not delve into solving this equation here, we will focus on key 
concepts and results essential to understanding quantum gates, quantum hardware, 
and providing a foundation for further study.
Hermitian Property of the Hamiltonian
As a consequence that the solution of the Schrodinger equation must represent a 
unitary evolution given by Eq. 4.1, the Hamiltonian H must be a Hermitian operator. 
We will provide a proof of this property at the end of this section (see § 4.7).
From a physical point of view, the Hermitian condition for the Hamiltonian 
is necessarily true, since H represents the total system energy, and as such, its 
eigenvalues must be real numbers.
4.2.1 * The Time-independent Schrodinger Equation
In the simplest case where the Hamiltonian H does not change with time, the 
Schrodinger equation is expressed as:
ih dt | ^(t= H | ^(t■ 
(4-4)
This equation has a general solution of the form:
|$(t)) = e-iHt |^(0)), 
(4.5)
which can be verified by differentiating both sides over t (see § 4.7).
The exponential term
U (t) = e - i Ht 
(4.6)
is the unitary time-evolution operator, and it determines how the quantum state 
|^(0)) at the initial time evolves to the state |^(t)) at time t.
Here the exponential function of operator A is defined as
eA = exp( A) = V 1 An, 
(4.7)
n!
n=0
where A is a normal operator, meaning AA^ = A^A. Normal operators include 
Hermitian and unitary operators.
Properties of the Exponential Operator
The exponential operator eA has several important properties:
Product Property
In general, eA+B = eAeB . However,
eA+B = eAeB, 
if [A,B]=0■ 
(4.8)
We will provide a proof of this prop erty at the end of this section (see § 4.7).

4.2 * The Schrodinger Equation 
86
Unitary Property
If A is Hermitian, then eiA is unitary. A proof is outlined below:
(eiA) (eiA)f = eiAe-iA + 
(4.9a)
= eiAe-iA 
(4.9b)
= eiA-iA = e0 = I. 
(4.9c)
This property confirms that U (t) in Eq. 4.6 is unitary, consistent with the Time 
Evolution Postulate that the state of a closed quantum system is governed by a 
unitary transformation.
Generalized Euler Formula
Consider the case where A2 = I (i.e., A is involutory) and 0 is a real number. In 
this scenario, the following relationship holds:
ei6A = cos 0I + i sin 0A. 
(4-10)
This equation can be analogized to the Euler formula, ei6 = cos 0 + i sin 0. A 
detailed proof of this property is provided at the end of this section (see § 4.7). 
Readers are encouraged to study the mathematics behind this proof, as the techniques 
and concepts involved are highly relevant to the field of quantum computing.
Exercise 4.1 Express eiX as a single 2 x 2 matrix, where X is the Pauli-X matrix.
Exercise 4.2 * Express ei(I+Z)/2 to a single 2 x 2 matrix, where Z is the Pauli-Z 
matrix and I is the identity matrix.
4.2.2 * The Time-dependent Schrodinger Equation
When the Hamiltonian varies with time, denoted as H (t), the formulation of the 
time-evolution operator becomes more complex. For cases where H (t1) commutes 
with H (t2) for any t1 and t2 within the time domain of interest, the solution to the 
time-dependent Schrodinger equation is given by
i i t t 
... .
U(t) = expl — - H H(1')dtt
(4.11)
In scenarios where H(t1) and H(t2) do not commute, the solution is expressed 
using a time-ordered exponential, known as the Dyson series:
U(t) = T exp
(4.12)
Here, T represents the time-ordering operator, which organizes the terms in the 
exponential based on their time arguments, arranging factors corresponding to later 
times to the left of those associated with earlier times.
It can be shown ([8]) that the time-evolution operator U(t) is unitary even 
when H(t) is time-dependent, as it preserves the inner product and the norm of 

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
87
state vectors. This ensures that the probabilities remain well-defined and conserved 
throughout the evolution.
While the Dyson series is fundamental to a comprehensive understanding of time­
dependent quantum mechanics, it is not crucial for a general quantum computing 
audience. For practical applications in quantum computing and simulation, the 
Trotterization approximation is often more relevant.
4.2.3 * Trotterization
Trotterization, also known as the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, is a method used 
in quantum mechanics to approximate the evolution of quantum systems with non­
commuting terms in their Hamiltonians. This technique is particularly useful in 
quantum computing for simulating complex quantum systems, where exact solutions 
are often computationally infeasible.
When dealing with a time-varying Hamiltonian H (t), the Trotterization formula 
can be used to approximate the time-evolution operator U (t). Consider dividing 
the total evolution time T into N small intervals, At = T/N. The Trotterization 
formula for a time-dependent Hamiltonian is:
U (T) « 
exp - - iH(tn )A, 
(4.13)
n 
n=1
where tn = nAt represents the time at the nth interval. This product is ordered such 
that factors corresponding to later times are placed to the left of those associated 
with earlier times.
This formula approximates the time-ordered exponential (Eq. 4.12) by assuming 
the Hamiltonian remains approximately constant over each interval At. Each term 
in the product is an exponential of the Hamiltonian evaluated at a specific time 
tn, scaled by At. The accuracy of this approximation increases as N — ro (i.e., as 
At —— 0).
Trotterization is also useful for Hamiltonians containing non-commuting terms, 
common in many real-world quantum systems. For example, consider a Hamiltonian 
of the form H = H1 + H2 , even when time-independent. In such cases, the 
exact solution to the Schrodinger equation can be challenging to compute, as 
ei(H1 +H2) = eiH1 eiH2. Trotterization allows us to approximate the time-evolution 
operator over a small interval At:
N
. 
(4.14)
The effectiveness of Trotterization depends on the size of At and the nature of 
the Hamiltonian. For rapidly changing or highly non-commutative Hamiltonians, 
more sophisticated versions, such as higher-order Suzuki-Trotter expansions, might 
be necessary.

Exercise 4.3 Consider a Hamiltonian H = aX + 0Z, where X and Z are the 
Pauli matrices, and a, 0 e R. Write an approximate solution to the Schrodinger 
equation using Trotterization.

4.3 Stationary Nature of Energy Eigenstates 
88
4.3 Stationary Nature of Energy Eigenstates
As a consequence of the time-independent Schrodinger equation, energy eigenstates 
are stationary, as explained below. This property plays an important role in many 
areas of quantum physics and quantum computing.
Let | Ek) be the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian operator H, with the correspond­
ing energy eigenvalues Ek . Since H is Hermitian, Ek has real values. When these 
eigenvalues are discrete, they are commonly referred to as the energy levels of the 
system.
4.3.1 Time Evolution Operator in the Basis of Energy Eigenstates
According to the spectral decomposition theorem in linear algebra, H can be 
expressed as:
H = E Ek I Ek HEk I ■ 
(4.15)
Each term in the sum projects the state vector onto the k-th energy eigenstate 
| Ek) and scales it by the corresponding energy eigenvalue Ek.
The time-evolution operator U (t) can be expressed as:
U (t) = e- Ht = £ e- Ekt |Ek)(Ek | ■ 
(4.16)
k
This equation describes the time-evolution operator U(t) as a sum over all energy 
eigenstates with the corresponding energy eigenvalues. Each term in the sum evolves 
the k-th energy eigenstate |Ek) by a phase factor e k. This equation can be 
viewed as the solution to the time-independent Schrodinger equation in the basis of 
the energy eigenstates.
4.3.2 Stationary Energy Eigenstates
Equation 4.16 shows that if a system is initially in an energy eigenstate |^ (0)) = |Ek), 
then its time evolution is simply a phase factor multiplying the initial state:
|*( t)] = U(t) |*(0)  = e-Ekt |Ek} ■ 
(4.17)
This means that if a system is prepared in an energy eigenstate, it will remain in 
that state with a time-dependent phase factor. Such a state is called a stationary 
state. Stationary states are quantum states that do not change with time, except 
for an overall phase factor.
If the system is not in an energy eigenstate initially, then its time evolution will 
involve a superposition of energy eigenstates, and the amplitudes of these energy 
eigenstates will evolve in time according to the corresponding phase factors. For 
example, say the system is initially in a superposition of |E0) and |E 1):
|^(0)) = a |Eo) + p |E 1} ■ 
(4.18)
At time t, the system state |^(t)) is given by

remain constant, as |e

The above discussion highlights the stationary nature of energy eigenstates in an 
ideal quantum system, where the probability distributions of these states remain 
constant over time, assuming the system is perfectly isolated and not subjected to 
any external forces or interactions.
However, in practice, real quantum systems are never completely closed or isolated. 
They invariably interact with their surroundings to some extent, leading to deviations 
from the idealized stationary behavior. These interactions can cause transitions 
between different energy states and introduce phenomena such as decoherence and 
dissipation, significantly influencing the system’s behavior.

4.3.3 The Ground State and Excited States
The ground state, |E0), represents the lowest energy state the system can occupy. 
In non-ideal, real-world quantum systems, this state is typically the most stable 
configuration, often realized as the system’s natural state in the absence of external 
energy inputs. It serves as the foundational reference point for defining other possible 
states of the system, known as the excited states. These excited states, having 
higher energy levels than the ground state, can be populated due to environmental 
interactions or external stimuli, highlighting the dynamic nature of quantum systems 
in realistic settings.
An excited state, |E 1) for example, is any state of a system that has a higher 
energy than the ground state. A qubit or particle has to absorb energy of the 
amount E1 - E0 to be “excited” from the ground state to this less stable state. This 
energy can be supplied through various means, such as by applying an external 
electric or magnetic field, or by exposing the system to electromagnetic radiation 
(e.g., microwave or laser) of angular frequency
E1 - E0
(4.20)
The excitation energy can also be provided, usually unintendedly, through thermal 
energy, which is why some quantum hardware operate at low temperatures.

4.3 Stationary Nature of Energy Eigenstates 
90
A superposition state, which is a combination of several possible states, can be 
achieved through careful control of the energy input and the system’s interactions.
An excited state or superposition state is inherently unstable because it represents 
a higher energy configuration of the system. When a system is in an excited state, 
it has multiple pathways to release the excess energy and return to the ground 
state. This process is known as relaxation. The mechanisms for relaxation can vary, 
including the emission of photons or phonons, collisions with other particles, or 
other interactions that allow the system to shed its excess energy. The tendency to 
return to the ground state also give rise to the short lifetime of qubits - referred to 
decoherence in quantum computing.
These concepts lay the foundation for understanding a wide range of quantum 
behaviors and are central to fields like quantum computing hardware, where control 
of ground and excited states enables the manipulation of qubits for computational 
purposes.
4.3.4 Qubit as a Two-Level System
A qubit is a two-level system, meaning it involves only two energy eigenstates: 
the ground state |E0) and the first excited state |E 1). These states form the 
computational basis:
|0> = |Eo), 
|1>=|E 1) - 
(4.21)
In quantum computing, qubits are typically initialized in the ground state |0). 
Quantum gates are designed to manipulate the qubits by inducing transitions 
between energy eigenstates or creating superpositions. The stationary nature of 
energy eigenstates ensures that, in an idealized and isolated quantum system, the 
qubits remain in their initial states until a quantum gate or external force acts upon 
them.
In a practical quantum system, such as a superconducting qubit, energy levels 
are often more complex than a simple two-level system. These levels might include 
|E0), |E 1), and |E2), for example, where only |E0) and |E 1) are actively used for 
the qubit operation, and the existence of |E2) is considered undesirable.

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
91
To mitigate potential problems, the system is meticulously engineered so that 
the energy levels |E0), |E 1), and |E2) are unequally spaced, i.e., E 1 — E0 = E2 — E 1. 
This careful design ensures that energy specifically targeting the transition between 
|E0} and |E 1) will not inadvertently affect the transition between |E 1) and |E2). 
By minimizing the interaction with the undesirable level |E2), the system gains 
greater stability and control, critical factors for the effective functioning of quantum 
computation. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.1.

4.4 Universal Quantum Computing and Annealing
In the rapidly advancing field of quantum computing, two predominant paradigms 
have emerged as foundational approaches to quantum computation: gate-based 
universal quantum computing and quantum annealing. While gate-based universal 
quantum computing is designed for a broad range of algorithms and can theoretically 
solve any computable problem, quantum annealing is particularly tailored for solving 
optimization problems by finding the minimum of a given objective function. The 
principle of unitary evolution of quantum states forms the foundation for these 
quantum computing paradigms, which we elucidate in the following subsections.
4.4.1 Gate-based Universal Quantum Computing
Gate-based quantum computers mo dulate qubit states using a series of predesigned 
unitary operations, known as quantum gates. Similar to classical digital computers 
where data processing occurs through logic gates, gate-based quantum computers 
process information by sequentially applying quantum gates to an initial state, 
iteratively evolving it into the final state that represents the computation result.
Quantum gates can be conceptualized as discrete counterparts to the continuous 
time-evolution operators in the Schrodinger equation. Implementing a quantum gate 
mandates a controlled alteration of the qubit’s Hamiltonian such that the intended 
transformation applies to its state. This control could entail utilizing external 
elements like electromagnetic radiation (e.g., microwave pulses) or modulating 
other system-specific parameters (e.g., for superconducting qubits, trapped ions, or 
quantum dots).
Given a Hamiltonian H designed for the gate’s function and an active time 
interval At, the unitary evolution operator U(At), as informed by the Schrodinger 
equation, is represented as:
|*(At)) = U(At) |$(0)>. 
(4.22)
Assuming the gate Hamiltonian H remains consistent over At, U (At) can be 
articulated as:
(4.23)
iH, i i 
iHAt
U (A t) = e ——.

Exercise 4.6 Consider a one-qubit quantum gate defined by the Hamiltonian 
H = | Z. Derive the unitary evolution operator U(At) over an interval At and 
elucidate the influence of this gate on an arbitrary qubit state.
4.4.2 Adiabatic Quantum Computation and Quantum Annealing
Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC) is based on the adiabatic theorem of 
quantum mechanics, wherein the gradually varied time evolution of a quantum 
system’s Hamiltonian transitions the system from its initial to a desired final state.
1 
Adiabatic Quantum Computation (AQC)
AQC leverages the inherent unitary evolution of quantum states governed by the time­
dependent Schrodinger equation. According to the adiabatic principle, if a quantum 
system is initially in an eigenstate (usually the ground state) of a Hamiltonian and 
the Hamiltonian changes sufficiently slowly, and without encountering level crossings, 
the system will remain predominantly in the instantaneous eigenstate of the evolving 
Hamiltonian, avoiding transitions to other energy states. The probability of the 
system deviating from the desired eigenstate and ending up in other states decreases 
exponentially with the slowness of the change in the Hamiltonian.
The approach involves encoding a computational problem into a quantum system, 
where the ground state of this system corresponds to the problem’s solution. The 
process starts with an initial, simple Hamiltonian, Hinitial , with an easily identifiable 
ground state. This Hamiltonian then undergoes a slow (adiabatic) evolution to a 
final Hamiltonian, Htarget , encoding the solution to the problem.
The Hamiltonian evolution is described by:
H(t) = (1 - s(t))Hinitial + s(t)Htarget, 
(4.24)
where s(t) is a scheduling parameter varying from 0 to 1 during the process, smoothly 
transitioning from Hinitial to Htarget .
Consider, for example, a spin qubit in a time-dependent magnetic field. The 
initial Hamiltonian Hinitial = Z has a ground state |0), corresponding to the spin 
aligned with the magnetic field in the z direction. As the field slowly rotates to the 
x direction, represented by Htarget = X, the qubit’s ground state evolves to |+), 
provided the change is adiabatic. In more complex systems with many interacting 
qubits, the final Hamiltonian Htarget is not as straightforward and represents the 
complex problem to be solved.
2 
Quantum Annealing: An Implementation of AQC
Quantum annealing is an implementation within the AQC framework. Unlike 
methods relying on quantum gates, it allows the system to naturally evolve under 
its quantum-mechanical dynamics. The term “annealing” refers to the process in 
which the Hamiltonian is adiabatically changed, akin to the metallurgical technique 
of slowly cooling materials to reach a stable state.
Implementing quantum annealing requires precise control over physical param­
eters characterizing the system’s Hamiltonian. For instance, in superconducting 
quantum annealing systems, the Hamiltonian is implemented by adjusting magnetic 

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
93
fields and couplings between qubits. By carefully tuning these parameters, the 
system is guided through the desired Hamiltonian evolution.
Quantum annealing computers are particularly effective for problems modeled 
by the Ising model, which can represent many optimization challenges. We will 
delve deeper into the Ising model in § 6.5.3 and explore its application in quantum 
annealing and other quantum algorithms in § 11.2.

* Larmor Precession and Rabi Oscillations
This section focuses on Larmor precession and Rabi oscillations, two cornerstone 
phenomena that shed light on the behavior of quantum systems subject to external 
fields. The dynamics of qubit systems is guided by the Schrodinger equation, which 
outlines their unitary evolution. Larmor precession and Rabi oscillations serve as 
archetypal cases to better grasp this evolution. By exploring these phenomena, 
we aim to demonstrate effective strategies for solving the Schrodinger equation. 
Their significance is further underscored by their relevance to quantum computing, 
especially in the practical aspects such as hardware design and quantum gate 
implementation.
1
* Larmor Precession
Larmor precession, or spin precession, occurs when a quantum particle with intrinsic 
angular momentum, or spin, is placed in an external magnetic field. The interaction 
between the particle’s magnetic moment and the external field causes the particle’s 
spin to precess, or rotate, around the direction of the magnetic field.
In the context of quantum computing, Larmor precession is often used as a 
mechanism to manipulate and control the state of a qubit. By applying the external 
magnetic field for a designed time interval, the qubit’s spin can be precisely controlled, 
allowing for the implementation of specific quantum gates and operations. Larmor 
precession is also used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to create images of the 
body’s internal structures, and in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy 
to analyze the properties of molecules and materials.
Solution to the Schrodinger Equation
The Hamiltonian, representing the energy of interaction, of a spin with an external 
magnetic field B in the z-direction can be expressed as:
-%Z-
H=
(4.25)
where w is the Larmor frequency (see details explained at the end of this subsection).
The dynamics of the system is governed by the Schrodinger equation (Eq. 4.4), 
which has a solution in the form of the time-evolution operator U (t) given by 
Eq. 4.6. Due to the property Z2 = I for Pauli matrix Z, we can simplify the matrix 
exponential in U (t) into a regular matrix (refer to Eq. 4.10):

while the polar angle 0 remains constant.

sphere, as illustrated in Fig. 4.2. The angular frequency of the rotation is the Larmor 
frequency w. This type of motion is known as precession, hence the name Larmor 
precession.
Larmor precession can be likened to the behavior of a spinning top. Just as a top 
precesses around the vertical direction when not perfectly upright due the influence 
of gravity, a spin in a magnetic field precesses around the field direction if it’s not 
aligned with the field. This precession is caused by the interaction between the spin’s 
magnetic moment and the magnetic field, similar to the gravitational torque on the 
top. In the case of an open system, various interactions with the environment, often 
undesirable, can cause the spin to gradually align more closely with the magnetic 
field direction over time.
3 
Implementation of the Rz (y) Gate
Larmor precession can be utilized to precisely control a spin-based qubit by aligning 
the magnetic field at an angle 0 relative to the spin direction, and then activating 
the magnetic field for a time interval At. The spin direction will precess by an angle 
Y = wAt. This is exactly the Pauli-Z rotation gate Rz(Y), discussed in § 5.2.5.

 The Hamiltonian
*
The Hamiltonian for a spin in an external magnetic field B, which is the interaction 
energy between the magnetic moment of the spin jl and the magnetic field, is given 
by:
H = -1 • B. 
(4.30)
The magnetic moment 1 of a spin is proportional to its spin angular momentum 
S:
1 = YS, 
(4.31)
In the case of a magnetic field aligned with the z-axis, the interaction energy 
becomes:
H= -1zB = -yBSz. 
(4.32)
The z-component of spin angular momentum, Sz , can be expressed in terms of 
the Pauli matrix Z as:
Sz = ' Z. 
(4.33)
Combining these relations, we obtain:
H = — 
= — 'WZ. 
(4.34)
where w = yB is referred to as the Larmor frequency. This is the same as Eq. 4.25.

# A Clarification of the Sign of the Hamiltonian
In our discussion so far, we have focused on a generic exploration of Larmor 
precession involving a spin in a magnetic field oriented along the z-direction, 
assuming the spin particle is possively charged. For an electron, the Hamiltonian in 
Eq. 4.34 has an opposite sign: H = Z• An astute reader might note a seeming 
inconsistency: the ground state for an electron in this scenario would be 11), not 
|0). To dispel any confusion, we delve into the nuances of different conventions in 
traditional quantum mechanics and quantum computing, as well as the distinctions 
between various physical systems.
• The lowest energy state, or ground state, corresponds to the magnetic moment 
being aligned with the magnetic field. For electrons, which possess a negative 
charge, this alignment translates to their spin being antiparallel to the 
magnetic field, traditionally referred to as spin-down in quantum mechanics. 
Conversely, for nuclei containing positively charged protons, the ground state 
corresponds to the spin being parallel to the magnetic field, or spin-up.
• In quantum computing, the state |0) is commonly associated with spin-up 
and is conventionally designated as the ground state. This choice is more a 
matter of computational convenience and is not necessarily consistent with 
all physical qubit systems.
• Furthermore, Larmor precession can be viewed as a perturbation to a base 
Hamiltonian that defines the ground state. This perspective is particularly 
relevant when Larmor precession serves as a model for the manipulation 
and control of qubit states. The application of a magnetic field (or other 
fields) introduces this perturbation, resulting in the characteristic precessional 
motion of the spin.
This clarification aims to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum mechanics 
and practical quantum computing conventions, enhancing the understanding of 
these fundamental concepts.
4.5.2 * Rabi Oscillations
Rabi oscillations are a phenomenon that occurs when a two-level quantum system 
(e.g., a qubit or spin-1/2 particle) is subjected to an oscillatory driving field. This 
phenomenon is named after the physicist Isidor Isaac Rabi, who first observed it in 
the context of atomic transitions. The oscillation occurs when the frequency of the 
external driving force is resonant with the energy difference between the two energy 
eigenstates. In this case, the probability of finding the electron in one of the energy 
levels oscillates periodically with time, completing one full oscillation within a Rabi 
cycle.
Rabi oscillations play a crucial role in many areas of quantum physics, such 
as atomic physics, quantum optics, and quantum computing. In the context of 
quantum computing, Rabi oscillations can be used to manipulate qubits by driving 
transitions between their computational basis states (e.g., |0) and |1)). In this case, 
carefully controlled electromagnetic pulses can be applied to induce Rabi oscillations, 
which allow for precise control of the superposition state of the qubit.
1 Solution to the Schrodinger Equation
The Hamiltonian of the two-level quantum system (under the rotating wave approxi­
mation, see below) is given by

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
97
H = Y,
(4.35)
where Y is the Pauli-Y matrix and Q is known as the Rabi frequency, which 
characterizes the strength of the coupling between the system and the external field.
Larmor precession and Rabi oscillations, while physically distinct phenomena, 
share mathematical similarities, particularly in their involvement of a single Pauli 
operator in the Hamiltonian.
In quantum computing, Larmor precession is often modeled to represent z-axis 
rotations of the qubit state, while Rabi oscillations are typically associated with 
x- and y-axis rotations. In our main discussion, we choose the Y Pauli operator 
in the Hamiltonian to demonstrate the creation of the |+) superposition state.
As a heads-up, it’s noteworthy that the implementation of the most essential 
two-qubit gates, such as the CNOT and the ZZ gates, involves ZX and ZZ 
interactions. These interactions and their roles in multi-qubit systems will be 
explored in Chapters 6 and 7. The physical principles underlying these interactions 
are similar to those of Larmor precession and Rabi oscillations discussed here.
The dynamics of the system is governed by the Schrodinger equation (Eq. 4.4), 
which has a solution in the form of the time-evolution operator U (t) given by Eq. 4.6. 
Due to the property Y2 = I of the Pauli matrix Y, we can simplify the matrix 
exponential in U (t) into a regular matrix:

Implementation of the Rotation Gates
Rabi oscillations, which involve the periodic exchange of population between quantum 
states, serve as a cornerstone for precise qubit control in quantum computing. They 
are essential for implementing various quantum gates and facilitating quantum 
information processing.
By applying a driving field for a time interval At, the qubit state undergoes a 
rotation by an angle y = QAt about the y-axis. This operation corresponds to the 
Ry(y) gate. In fact, the unitary operator U(At) in Eq. 4.36 aligns exactly with the 
matrix representation of Ry (y) (refer to § 5.2.5 for details).
Through Rabi oscillations driven by Hamiltonians involving the X operator, the 
Rx gate can also be implemented. Other fundamental gates such as X , Y , H , S, 
and T can be realized by employing combinations of the Rx , Ry , and Rz gates, a 
topic to be discussed in Chapter 5.
Intuitively, Rabi oscillations can facilitate transformations of a qubit from the 
state |0) to |1) (analogous to an X gate operation) or to |+) (analogous to a Hadamard 
gate operation). Furthermore, this mechanism can be extended to coupled states 
between qubits, thereby enabling entanglement operations.
4 
The Hamiltonian
The Hamiltonian for Rabi oscillations has a general form

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems
99
H = ~^( (cos ^X + sin $Y),
(4.39)
where $ is a phase factor that determines the specific combination of the Pauli 
matrices X and Y involved in the Hamiltonian. In the special case where $ = 0, 
we have the X term; if $ = n/2, we have the Y term. In the above discussion, for 
simplicity, we used only the Y term to illustrate the fundamental concepts.
The specific Hamiltonian for a real physical system depends on the direction of 
the external driving field, and its phase of oscillation.
Exercise 4.8 Given the Hamiltonian H = Ap X, find a solution to the Schrodinger 
equation with initial condition |^(0)) = |1). Calculate the probability P0(t) = 
I <0|*( t)> |2.
5
* The Rotating Wave Approximation
The Hamiltonian for Rabi oscillations, representing the energy of a two-level system 
in a high-frequency oscillatory field, can become quite complex due to the field’s 
time-varying nature. The Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) is a technique 
used in quantum mechanics to simplify this Hamiltonian, as described in [8]. It is 
particularly useful for analyzing interactions between a quantum system and an 
oscillating external field, such as laser or microwave radiation. The RWA is most 
valid near resonance, where the frequency of the external field closely matches the 
system’s natural transition frequency, denoted by hw ~ E 1 — E0.
In the RWA, the Hamiltonian is transformed into an interaction representation, 
separating the free evolution of the system from its interaction with the driving field. 
The key step in RWA is to neglect the rapidly oscillating terms in the interaction 
Hamiltonian, which effectively average out to zero over time, focusing only on terms 
that oscillate at the difference frequency between the driving field and the natural 
frequency of the system.
This simplification yields an effective two-level Hamiltonian, as exemplified in 
Eq. 4.39, focusing primarily on resonant transitions. Within this framework, the 
effective Hamiltonian for Rabi oscillations can be viewed as a perturbation to the 
base Hamiltonian of the quantum system. This approximation greatly facilitates the 
analysis of quantum dynamics and phenomena, making the mathematical treatment 
more manageable, as demonstrated in our example. However, it’s important to note 
that the RWA may not always be applicable, especially when far from resonance 
or when the terms omitted by the approximation become significant. As with any 
approximation in physics, its applicability must be carefully assessed within the 
sp ecific physical context.
4.6 * Further Exploration
These topics are seldom covered in the context of quantum computing, except in 
specialized quantum simulations. They are included here for background information 
only. For further details, interested readers are directed to Ref. [8].

4.6.1 * Time Evolution Equations for Relativistic Systems
A common misconception is that quantum mechanics is synonymous with the 
Schrodinger equation. However, this equation is not universally applicable to all 
quantum systems. In the realm of relativistic systems, which involve high energies 
or particles moving at speeds close to the speed of light, different equations govern 
their time evolution.
For fermions, particles with half-integer spin, the Dirac equation is used to 
describe their evolution over time. The Dirac equation is given by:
in di । ^ (t= HD | ^ (t, 
(4‘40)
where HD is the Dirac Hamiltonian operator.
For bosons, particles with integer spin, the Klein-Gordon equation is used to 
describe their evolution over time. The Klein-Gordon equation is given by:
□ j + mc2- $ = 0, 
(4.41)
n2
where □ = --^— — V2 is the d’Alembertian operator, a second-order differential 
c2 dt2
operator defined in spacetime, m is the mass of the particle, c is the speed of light, 
and n is the reduced Planck constant.
4.6.2 * Open Quantum Systems
In quantum mechanics, the Evolution Postulate and the Schrodinger equation are 
traditionally used to describe the dynamics of closed quantum systems, which are 
isolated from external influences or interactions. However, in the realm of quantum 
computing, qubits often undergo controlled interactions with external fields, such as 
microwave, lasers, or magnetic fields. This situation might appear to conflict with 
the closed-system framework, but it can be reconciled using perturbation theory.
In such scenarios, the external controls are typically treated as perturbations 
to the system’s Hamiltonian. This approach allows for an analysis of the system’s 
evolution under the influence of these controls. Indeed, Larmor precession and Rabi 
oscillations, as discussed in this chapter, are examples of how quantum computing 
often employs such controlled interactions. By modeling these interactions as 
perturbations, the foundational principles of quantum mechanics are extended 
to encompass the interaction of qubits with external control mechanisms. This 
extension is crucial for the precise control and manipulation of qubit states, forming 
a cornerstone of quantum information processing. It is this nuanced application of 
the Schrodinger equation and perturbation theory that bridges the gap between 
the theoretical model of closed-system dynamics and the interactive environment 
essential to quantum computation.
In quantum mechanics, open quantum systems that interact with their environ­
ment typically undergo non-unitary evolution. Such systems are comprehensively 
described by frameworks like quantum master equations or quantum trajectories, 
which account for time-dependent system-environment interactions. A notable 
instance of non-unitary evolution is the measurement process, where the state 
vector collapses to an eigenstate of the observable being measured. Additionally, 

Chapter 4. Dynamics of Quantum Systems 
101
decoherence, a phenomenon where qubit states lose coherence due to uncontrolled 
environmental influences and noise, represents another form of non-unitary evolution. 
These non-unitary processes can be effectively modeled using Completely Positive 
Trace-Preserving (CPTP) maps, providing a mathematical framework essential in 
quantum information theory. We will delve into CPTP maps and quantum channels 
in § 12.2.7.

* Deferred Proofs
1
Hermitian Property of the Hamiltonian
As a result of the unitary evolution postulate (Eq. 4.1), the Hamiltonian operator 
H in the Schrodinger equation (Eq. 4.3) must be Hermitian. This can be seen as 
follows:
Consider an infinitesimal time interval At. Eq. 4.1 can be expressed as:
|^(At)) - |$(0)) = (U(At) - I) |^(0)). 
(4.42)
At the same time, the Schrodinger equation Eq. 4.3 gives us
|j>(At))-|j>(0)) = -iAth |^(0) . 
(4.43)
Comparing the two equations above, we obtain:
U(At) = I - i At H. 
(4.44)
Since U (At) is unitary,
I = U(At)U(At)t = II - iAH^ 11 + iAHt = I - iAtH + iAtHt. (4.45)

Here since At is infinitesimally small, we have ignored the (At)2 term.
Apparently, for the above equation to hold, we must have H = Ht , which 
indicates H is a Hermitian operator. Conversely, we can also show if H is Hermitian, 
the time evolution operator U as a solution to the Schrodinger equation is unitary.

3 Exponential Product Formula (Eq. 4.8)
We will prove that
eA+B = eAeB, 
if [A, B] = 0. 
(4.8)
If [A, B] = 0, meaning A and B commute, we can freely exchange the order of A 
and B in their product, AB = BA.
Given the definition of eA in Eq. 4.7, we first consider the expansion of eA+B :
1
A+B = E n!( A+B)n.
Using the binomial theorem, (A + B)n can be expanded as:
n

Then

Thus, we have shown that eA+B = eA eB when A and B commute.
4 Derivation of Eq. 4.10
We want to prove that, if A2 = I and 0 is a real number, then 
et6A = cos 0I + i sin 0A.
(4.10)
Given the definition of the exponential of an operator,
eieA

we separate the series into even and odd terms:

. 
(4-53)
Given A2 = I , we can simplify the terms.
For even powers, (idA)2n = (i2)nd2nA2n = (—1)nd2nl.
For odd powers, (idA)2n+1 = (idA)(-1)nd2nA2n = i(—1)nd2n+1 A.
Thus, the series can be rewritten as:

Therefore, we have proved that ei6A = cos di + i sin dA when A2 = I.
4.8 Summary and Conclusions
Temporal Evolution of Quantum States
In this chapter, we delved into the complex dynamics of quantum systems, centering 
on the key inquiry: How do qubit states evolve over time? The foundational 
principles of quantum evolution govern both the operation of quantum gates and the 
process of quantum annealing. To elucidate these principles further, we employed 
the case study of a single qubit as a representative example.
Core Principles in Quantum Mechanics
Anchoring our discussions was the Time Evolution Postulate, a cornerstone in 
quantum mechanics, which posits the deterministic unitary evolution of closed 
quantum systems. This provided the scaffolding to introduce the Schrodinger 
equation, the vital equation connecting the temporal evolution of quantum states 
with their energy via the Hamiltonian. The stationary nature of energy eigenstates, a 
direct implication of the time-independent Schrodinger equation, was also delineated, 
elucidating the distinction between ground states and excited states and their 
pertinence in quantum computing.
Quantum Computing Paradigms
The realm of quantum computing has witnessed the emergence of two cardinal 
paradigms: Gate-based universal quantum computing and adiabatic quantum com­
puting, including quantum annealing. Their distinctions and foundational underpin­
nings were examined, underscoring their unique methodologies and applications, all 
rooted in the principle of unitary evolution of quantum states.
Insights into Quantum Systems

mechanics, were explored to furnish insights into the behavior of quantum systems

under the influence of external fields. These served as pedagogical tools, illuminating 
essential techniques for tackling the Schrodinger equation, particularly relevant to 
the domain of quantum hardware.
Perspective on Quantum Systems
The chapter culminated with an exploration into topics not directly applied in 
quantum computing, yet important for a holistic understanding of the subject. 
These encompassed relativistic time evolution equations and the domain of open 
quantum systems.
Upcoming Topics
In the next chapter, we will explore quantum gates, which are central to quantum 
computing. Building on our foundational understanding of quantum mechanics, we 
will study the basic single-qubit gates before advancing to topics like multi-qubit 
gates, entanglement, quantum teleportation, and the E91 quantum key distribution 
protocol. These discussions will connect our theoretical understanding of quantum 
mechanics with practical quantum computing applications.

This chapter marks the beginning of our exploration into the world of quantum 
gates, the critical building blocks of quantum computing systems.
The principles of quantum computing are deeply intertwined with the fundamental 
tenets of quantum mechanics. The relationship between the two can be likened to 
how Newtonian mechanics underpins the launching of satellites. Both fields require 
an in-depth understanding of the respective theoretical principles and meticulous 
engineering to ensure precise real-world application.
Just as launching a satellite involves grasping Newtonian principles like gravity 
and motion to craft the right trajectory and propulsion systems, creating quantum 
gates and circuits requires understanding the key principles of quantum mechanics, 
such as superposition and entanglement. This knowledge enables us to control qubits 
and construct quantum algorithms for tackling complex computational problems. In 
both contexts, we leverage basic physical theories to devise practical solutions.
In previous discussions, we have laid down the foundational principles of quantum 
mechanics—including quantum states, measurements, and unitary evolution—and 
we have developed a solid understanding of qubits. Now, we’re ready to extend our 
exploration into the fascinating world of quantum gates.
We’ll commence our exploration with single-qubit gates and their various applica­
tions. This groundwork will then pave the way for more advanced topics, including 
multi-qubit gates, entanglement, quantum teleportation, and the E91 quantum key 
distribution protocol.
5.1 Quantum Versus Classical Logic Gates
Just as classical logic gates are fundamental to classical computing, quantum gates 
form the cornerstone of quantum computing. Both types of gates serve as stan­
dardized and highly optimized components within their respective computational 
paradigms. Quantum gates are specifically designed to manipulate quantum states, 
thereby facilitating the execution of quantum algorithms. These gates can be viewed 
as specialized solution cases of the Schrodinger equation, tailored for quantum 
computational tasks. Although implemented differently across various qubit plat­
forms, the operational functionality of quantum gates has remained consistent. This 
mirrors the evolution of classical gates, which have transitioned from vacuum tubes 
to transistors and other technologies, yet their core principles of simplified state 
representations and logical operations have remained unchanged.

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates

5.1.1 Quantum Gates as Unitary Operators
Quantum gates introduce a distinct capability not found in classical computing: the 
ability to operate on superpositions of states. This unique feature arises from the 
principles of quantum mechanics that govern qubit behavior. The time evolution of 
a closed quantum system, as described by the Schrodinger equation, is characterized 
by unitary operators. Consequently, each quantum gate represents a unitary trans­
formation, capable of acting on superpositions of quantum states and producing 
superpositions of outcomes.
As explored in § 4.4.1, the action of a quantum gate is analogous to the application 
of a specially designed Hamiltonian H over a specified time interval At. The physical 
implementation of a quantum gate, thus, depends on the precise engineering of this 
Hamiltonian.
The evolution of a quantum system’s state, in accordance with the Schrodinger 
equation, is generally expressed as:
|^(At)) = U(At) |^(0)), 
(5.1)
where U (At) is the unitary operator that describes the gate operation.
In quantum gate and circuit discussions, it’s common to omit the At term. Thus, 
Eq. 5.1 is often represented as:
|* 1) = U |*0). 
(5-2)
Here, |^0) = |^(0)) denotes the system’s state prior to the gate operation, 
|^ 1) = |^(At)) symbolizes the state post-operation, and U = U(At) characterizes 
the operator signifying the gate’s action.
5.1.2 Reversibility Requirement
One of the key attributes of quantum gates, stemming from their nature as unitary 
operators, is reversibility. Specifically, unitary operators possess a notable property: 
the inverse of a unitary operator is its conjugate transpose, denoted as U-1 = U'L 
Consequently, by applying the inverse operation U-1, which is also unitary, one can 
effectively reverse the original quantum operation.
This aspect of quantum gates contrasts sharply with classical logic gates. Classical 
gates are not inherently reversible, as classical mechanics does not enforce the 
reversibility requirement inherent to quantum mechanics. Because of this not all 
classical gates have quantum counterparts.
For single-bit classical gates, we can identify four possible ones:
1. Identity (or “do nothing”): 0 maps to 0 and 1 maps to 1.
2. NOT (or bit-flip): 0 maps to 1 and 1 maps to 0.
3. Constant 0: Both 0 and 1 map to 0.
4. Constant 1: Both 0 and 1 map to 1.
It’s clear that the third and fourth gates are non-reversible, as they both map 
two possible inputs to a single output. In quantum mechanics, these gates would 
violate the principle of unitarity.

5.1 Quantum Versus Classical Logic Gates 110
Additionally, some well-known multi-bit classical gates are irreversible and hence, 
cannot be directly implemented as quantum gates:
• AND Gate: This gate has two input bits and one output bit. An output of 0 
could arise from inputs 00, 01, or 10. Only the output 1 uniquely corresponds 
to the input 11. (See
)
 Fig. 5.1.
• OR Gate: Analogous to the AND gate, the OR gate’s output of 1 can originate 
from inputs 01, 10, or 11. An output of 0 is unique to 00.
• Other Gates such as NAND, NOR, and XOR: These gates also exhibit irre­
versibility for certain outputs.
While these classical gates can’t be directly translated to quantum gates, alter­
native methods exist to emulate their functionality in quantum computing. One 
prevalent strategy involves using extra output bits (often termed as ancilla bits) 
to retain all input-bit information. This topic will receive further exploration in 
subsequent chapters.

5.1.3 No-Cloning Requirement
Owing to the unitary nature of quantum evolution, there exists a pivotal principle 
in quantum computing and quantum information: the no-cloning theorem:
The No-Cloning Theorem.
It is fundamentally impossible to create an exact replica of an arbitrary, unknown 
quantum state solely using any physically realizable quantum operation while 
retaining the original state.
This theorem implies that one cannot perfectly clone or duplicate a qubit without 
altering its original state. As a consequence, operations like FANOUT (see Fig. 5.1), 
which are pervasive in classical digital circuits, are not feasible in quantum computing. 
On a positive note, the no-cloning principle underscores the robust security in 
quantum cryptography, exemplified by protocols such as the BB84.
A proof of this theorem is outlined at the end of this chapter (§ 5.7).
5.1.4 Linearity
Quantum gates, represented by complex unitary matrices, act linearly on quantum 
states. This linearity property, pivotal to quantum mechanics, ensures that any 
linear combination (superposition) of states is again a quantum state. It allows 
quantum gates to operate on superpositions, resulting in quantum parallelism and 
entanglement, which are among the core strengths of quantum computing.

5.1.5 From Quantum Gates to Circuits
Quantum circuits are constructed by composing sequences of quantum gates to 
implement quantum algorithms. The inherent nature of these circuits is unitary, 
provided they consist exclusively of quantum gates. This composition guarantees 
that the resulting operation remains unitary, thereby preserving the quantum state’s 
norm and coherence within a closed system.
However, the scope of quantum circuits extends beyond solely unitary gates. 
Non-unitary operations, such as measurements and state resets, play a crucial role in 
quantum computing. While unitary gates facilitate the evolution of quantum states 
within a closed system, non-unitary operations enable interaction with the external 
environment. This leads to phenomena such as state collapse or decoherence. Such 
operations are indispensable for extracting information from quantum systems and 
are integral to certain steps in quantum algorithms, thereby introducing additional 
complexity and capabilities to quantum circuits that surpass those of classical logic 
gates.
The synergy of unitary and non-unitary operations within quantum circuits 
captures the full breadth of quantum computing capabilities. These range from 
maintaining coherent superpositions to executing measurements that provide classical 
information. As we progress in this chapter and in subsequent ones, we will delve 
into the intricate process of constructing quantum circuits and examine how they 
form the foundation of complex quantum algorithms.
5.2 Common Single-Qubit Gates
Now we are ready to turn to the common quantum gates involving a single qubit. 
As shown in Table 5.1, these include the Pauli-X, Y , Z gates, the Hadamard (H) 
gate, the phase gates, and the rotation gates. By combining these gates in different 
ways, quantum circuits can solve complex problems and perform tasks that are 
infeasible for classical computers, such as factoring large numbers or simulating 
quantum systems.
5.2.1 Approaches of Analysis: X Gate Example
The action of a qubit gate can be represented and analyzed in various ways, which 
are frequently used in different applications. It’s essential to be familiar with all of 
them. As an illustrative example, we will explore the X gate.
The X gate, also known as the Pauli-X gate, is a fundamental quantum gate, 
acting as the quantum counterpart to the classical NOT gate. It maps |0) to |1) and 
vice versa. Therefore, it is also known as the bit-flip gate.

5 Rotation on Bloch Sphere
In the Bloch sphere representation, the X gate corresponds to a 180^ rotation about 
the x-axis. As shown in Fig. 2.4, the state vector |^) moves 180^ along the dotted 
circle centered around the x-axis.
6 Boolean Representation
In addition to matrix and bra-ket representations, many quantum gates can also be 
expressed using Boolean representations. We will explore this in detail in § 7.3.
5.2.2 Pauli Gates
We have just delved into a detailed examination of the X gate, introducing various 
analytical tools in the process. These tools can be extended to the entire family of 
Pauli gates, which comprise the X , Y , Z , and I gates.
The Z gate, known as the phase-flip gate, imparts a n phase to the |1) state. 
Additionally, it serves as the flip gate for the |+) and |—) states, transitioning |+) 
to |—) and vice versa.
The Y gate integrates both the bit flip and phase flip. Interestingly, it can be 
shown that ZX = iY , a derivation we invite the reader to explore in the exercises 
below.

The I gate stands for the identity gate, represented by the identity matrix. 
While it has no transformative effect on the qubit state and doesn’t require phys­
ical implementation, its frequent use in circuit analysis justifies its inclusion for 
completeness.
All Pauli gates are involutory, meaning applying a Pauli gate twice restores the 
qubit state to its original form. For example, X2 = I.
For quick reference, essential formulas related to these gates and others we will 
explore subsequently can be found in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. While we won’t delve into 
all the formulas here, we encourage readers to tackle the exercises provided below.
Exercise 5.3 Show that Z acts as the flip gate for |+) and |—), meaning Z |+) = | —) 
and Z | —) = |+), using both matrix and bra-ket representations.
Exercise 5.4 Show that Y(a |0) + P 11)) = i(a |1) — P |0)) employing both matrix 
and bra-ket representations.
5.2.3 The Hadamard H Gate
The Hadamard (H) gate is fundamental in quantum computing. It is commonly 
used to create superposition states as it transforms |0) to |+), and |1) to |—):

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates 115
H |0> = |+) = -12(|0> + |1», 
H |1) = - = —2(|0) — |1))■
(5.11a)
(5.11b)
For this reason, the {|+), |—)} basis is often referred to as the Hadamard basis.
Being involutory, H2 = I . This means applying H twice restores the qubit state 
to its original form:
Lastly,
H |+) = 0 , H- = |1) ■
(5.12)
H(a |0) + fl |1)) = a |+) + fl - ■
(5.13)
Exercise 5.5 Show that H |+) = |0) and H |—) = |1) using both matrix and 
bra-ket representations.
5.2.4 The Phase Gates
Phase gates are instrumental in introducing a relative phase between the basis states 
of a qubit. Among these gates, the most commonly utilized are the S, T , and P 
gates.
The S gate, often termed the “phase gate,” adds a phase of n/2 (or 90°) to the 
11) state. It can also be represented as the square root of the Z gate:
S |0) = 0 , S 1 = i 1, S = y/Z.
(5.14)
The T gate introduces a more nuanced phase of n/4 (or 45°). It is effectively 
the fourth root of the Z gate:
T |0) = |0), T |1) = ein4 |1), T = 4Z.
(5.15)
The general phase gate, P($), allows for a custom phase $ to be added to the 
|1) state:
P($) |0) = 0 , P($) |1) = ei*  |1) ■
(5.16)
These gates are foundational for tasks such as phase kickback and quantum 
Fourier transform. By adjusting the relative phase, they offer an extra degree of 
freedom and control in quantum algorithms.
Exercise 5.6 Show that S2 = Z and T4 = Z.
Exercise 5.7 Demonstrate how the S, T, and P(^) gates transform the general 
qubit state a |0) + ^ |1) using the bra-ket notation.

5.2 Common Single-Qubit Gates

5.2.5 The Rx, Ry, and Rz Rotation Gates
Rotation gates play a crucial role in quantum computing, offering a method to 
rotate qubit states around various axes of the Bloch sphere (see Fig. 5.2). The three 
primary rotation gates are Rx , Ry , and Rz , corresponding to rotations about the x, 
y , and z axes, respectively.
1. The Rx (0) gate rotates a qubit state around the x-axis by an angle 0:
Rx (0 )= e - i2 X
cos 2 
— i sin 2
—i sin 2 
cos 2
(5.17)
Exercise 5.8 Demonstrate that the matrix of Rx (0) is unitary. Is it also Hermitian?
2. Similarly, the Ry (0) gate rotates a qubit state around the y-axis:
' ft
cos n
Ry (0) = e
sin 2
— sin 2
n 2

(5.18)
- i £ Y
, i 2 Y =
3. The Rz (0) gate performs a rotation around the z-axis:

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
117
Rz (0 )= e - i2 Z
e - i 2 
0
0 
ei 2
(5.19)
A key property of these rotation operators is:
Ri (0)a = Ri (ad),
(5.20)
where a e R and i e {x, y, z}.
Figure 5.3: Demonstration of Non-Commutative Nature of 3D Rotations
It is imperative to understand that rotations in three-dimensional space are 
non-commutative when applied in different sequences. As depicted in Fig. 5.3, 
rotating around the x-axis followed by the z-axis (part a) does not result in the 
same orientation as when the rotation sequence is reversed (part b). This can be 
mathematically expressed as RzRx = RxRz , or equivalently [Rz , Rx] = 0.
The equations for Rx, Ry, and Rz closely resemble the solutions for spin precession 
(Eq. 4.26) and Rabi oscillations (Eq. 4.36). Hence, both phenomena serve as 
effective means to implement these gates.
The Pauli gates, Hadamard gate, and Phase gates can all be expressed as 
special cases of rotation gates, albeit with a potential global phase difference. The 
relationships between them are given by:
X = iRx (n),
(5.21a)
Y = iRy (n),
(5.21b)
Z = - Rz (n),
(5.21c)
S = ei4 Rz (2),
(5.21d)
T = e 8 Rz (4),
(5.21e)
H = iRx(n) Ry (2) = iRy G2) Rz(n) ■
(5.21f)
Equation 5.21 offers insight into understanding single-qubit gates as rotations 
on the Bloch sphere. For instance, the Hadamard gate can be interpreted as a 

5.2 Common Single-Qubit Gates
118
rotation of 90^ around the y-axis, followed by a 180^ rotation around the x-axis. 
Alternatively, it can also be seen as a 180^ rotation around the z-axis, followed by a 
90^ rotation around the y-axis.
Exercise 5.9 Derive the expression for the X gate as a special case of the Rx 
rotation gate.
Exercise 5.10 Among the gates listed in Table 5.1, identify which gates are 
Hermitian (i.e., U = U^), which are involutory (i.e., U2 = I), and which satisfy 
both conditions.
5.2.6 * The Unified Rotation Gate
Figure 5.4: The Unified Rotation Gate (Ru) on the Bloch Sphere
We can further unify Rx , Ry , and Rz into a single rotation operator Ru . Below 
is how it’s defined (refer to Fig. 5.4).
Given any real unit vector in three-dimensional space represented by U = 
(ux , uy , uz ), where the condition u2x + u2y + uz2 = 1 holds, we can define the unitary 
operator
&U = UxX + Uy Y + Uz Z.
(5.22)
In the context of spherical coordinates with polar angle 0 and azimuthal angle $, 
the components are given by
ux = sin 0 cos $, uy = sin 0 sin $, uz = cos 0. 
(5.23)
This results in:
au = sin 0 cos 0X + sin 0 sin 0Y + cos 0Z 
(5.24a)
cos 0 sin 0e i^ 
sin 0ei^ — cos 0
(5.24b)

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
119
In this context, we use Y to denote the rotation angle, reserving 0 for the polar 
directional angle.
For a rotation about the axis u by an angle Y:
Ru ( Y,0,$ ) = e - iY °u
= cos YI - i sin Y
_ cos 2 — i sin Y cos 0
—i sin Y sin 0ei‘
—i sin Y sin 0e i^ 
cos Y + i sin 2 cos 0
(5.25a)
(5.25b)
(5.25c)
It might be evident to the astute reader that all single-qubit gates can be 
represented as a special case of Ru . Then, why not just use Ru and eliminate all 
others? Primarily because Ru is parameterized by three values (0, $, and y) and is 
challenging to implement physically.
Exercise 5.11 Express Rx, Ry, and Rz in terms of Ru(Y,0,$) and verify that 
their matrix representations are equivalent.
5.3 From Gate Sequences to Quantum Circuits
Quantum gates, foundational to quantum circuits, dictate the progression of quantum 
computations on qubits. These circuits visually depict quantum algorithms, offering 
a clear understanding of their design and sequence. As we’ve delved into single-qubit 
gates, our next logical step is to explore sequences of these foundational gates within 
quantum circuits.
5.3.1 The Circuit Model of Quantum Computing
The circuit model of quantum computing emerges as a leading framework for 
understanding and implementing quantum algorithms and operations. Drawing 
parallels with classical circuits, which process information using a series of logical 
gates, quantum circuits use quantum gates to manipulate qubits. These quantum 
computations can be visually represented through circuit diagrams, delineating each 
gate and its sequence, thereby facilitating an intuitive grasp and design of quantum 
algorithms.
This model is tailored for universal quantum computing, enabling it to theoreti­
cally execute any quantum algorithm. However, it’s important to recognize that the 
circuit model isn’t the only quantum computational model out there. The quantum 
Turing machine model serves as another key model, offering a more abstract per­
spective of quantum computation. While rich in theoretical insights, its high-level 
nature tends to make it less suited for practical applications compared to the circuit 
model.
Diverging from these models is the concept of quantum annealing. This paradigm, 
exemplified by systems like D-Wave, excels in rapidly searching for optimized 
solutions within vast solution spaces, making it particularly effective for certain 
optimization problems. However, quantum annealing has its own set of limitations 
and does not replace the capabilities of universal quantum computers.

5.3 From Gate Sequences to Quantum Circuits 
120
A comprehensive study of quantum computing, such as ours, naturally commences 
with the circuit model for universal computing due to its practical relevance, visual 
clarity, and wide applicability. This foundational understanding paves the way for 
diving deeper into other quantum computational paradigms and appreciating their 
unique strengths and challenges.
5.3.2 Quantum Circuit Diagrams
Quantum circuits are graphically depicted through circuit diagrams. For illustration, 
Fig. 5.5 will be used to elucidate some salient aspects of quantum circuit diagrams.
(a) A sequence of 
single-qubit gates
(b) A simple two-qubit 
circuit with measurements
Figure 5.5: Examples of Quantum Circuits
1 
Wires
Often referred to as “wires,” the horizontal lines depict the temporal evolution of 
individual qubits in the circuit. Each wire denotes a single qubit and charts its state 
alteration through various gate operations.
2 
Gates
Symbols, frequently housed within rectangles or squares, represent the gates and 
are set upon the wires of the qubits they influence. These symbols signify quantum 
operations responsible for the metamorphosis of qubit states.
3 
Left-to-right Sequence
Gates are arranged from left to right on the wires, encapsulating the chronological 
sequence of operations. Progressing from left to right mirrors the advancement in 
time, with the sequence of gates being pivotal, orchestrating the comprehensive state 
transformation of the qubits.
4 
Order of Operator Multiplication
The composition of a sequence of gates is represented as the matrix product of the 
related gate matrices. Owing to conventional mathematical notation, the sequence of 
these matrices is in inverse order relative to the sequence of the gates. For instance, 
in Fig. 5.5 (a), the progression from a Z gate to an X gate results in the matrix 
product XZ.
5 
Input and Output
Positioned on the left of the circuit diagram, the initial states (often initialized to 
|0» are one form of input to the circuit. However, the input is not solely limited to 
such initializations; it also encompasses other elements such as query oracles and 
gate parametrization (to be discussed in Chapter 11). Conversely, the final states 
on the right side of the circuit diagram represent the output after all quantum gates 

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
121
and operations have been applied. Measurement operations, typically represented 
by rectangles enclosing a meter sign, are introduced at this stage to extract classical 
data—indicated by double wires—from the quantum states of the qubits.
6 
Computation in Place
It is important to understand that quantum circuits differ fundamentally from their 
classical counterparts, such as printed circuit boards or integrated circuits. In a 
quantum circuit, the gates and wires are not tangible physical entities in the same way. 
Instead, only the qubits and their control mechanisms are physically implemented. 
The wires in the diagram represent the temporal continuity of qubit states, and the 
quantum gates denote specific transformations of these states, directed by external 
controls.

the initial state |0)?
(b) Quantum circuits involving unitary gates are reversible. Draw the inverse 
circuit for the above sequence. Hint: the inverse of a circuit consists of the 
inverses of the original gates applied in reverse order.
5.3.3 Gate Sequences
Equipped with our knowledge of quantum gates, we can delve into gate sequences and, 
crucially, their equivalences. Intriguingly, gate sequences can often be represented 
by a single, equivalent gate. This capability is vital for optimizing quantum circuits, 
especially when these circuits must be executed on real quantum hardware with 
resource constraints. Moreover, mastering the equivalences of gate sequences is 
foundational for analyzing complex quantum circuits.
In the subsequent discussions, we highlight some pivotal equivalences involving 
single-qubit gates. This list will be extended as we venture into multi-qubit gates in 
§ 7.4.
1 
Pauli Gate Relations
The diagram below demonstrates that the combination of a Z gate followed by an 
X gate is equivalent to a Y gate, up to a global phase: ZX = iY .
X - Z — ^ 
— Y
Further relations among the Pauli gates include: XZ = -iY , XY = iZ, Y X = 
-iZ , Y Z = iX , ZY = -iX . See Appendix D for more.
2 
Involutory Relations
The diagram below shows that applying an H gate twice yields the identity operation 
(I ), leaving the qubit state unchanged. Applying it thrice reduces to just applying it 
once, as a result of the involutory property of the Hadamard gate: H2 = I .

Other gates exhibit similar involutory relations: X2 = I , Y 2 = I , and Z2 = I .

4 Constructing the Hadamard Gate
In practice, the Hadamard gate is often realized using other basic gates. For 
instance, H = iRx(n)Ry(2) = iRy(n)Rz(n). This realization allows us to construct 
the Hadamard gate as illustrated below:
- Ry (n/2)- Rx (n)-

5 Constructing the Y Gate
In practice, the Y gate is often realized using other basic gates. For example, 
Y = Rx (-2) ZRx (n).

Exercise 5.13 Draw circuit diagrams corresponding to the gate relations HXH = 
Z, HYH = -Y, and HY = -YH, SXSt = Y.
5.4 Quantum Random Number Generator
Quantum applications that use only single-qubit gates are relatively simple, as 
they do not involve entanglement or complex interactions between multiple qubits. 
Nonetheless, they can help us build an understanding of basic quantum concepts 
and operations. Next, we explore are some examples, starting with QRNG.
A Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) is a device that generates 
truly random numbers by exploiting the inherent randomness and unpredictability 
of quantum mechanical processes. Unlike classical random number generators, which 
either rely on deterministic algorithms or on external sources of entropy, QRNGs 
harness the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics to produce genuine 
randomness that is independent of any underlying patterns or biases.

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates 123
QRNG Using Photons
A common method to implement a QRNG is by using a single-photon source and a 
beam splitter, illustrated in Fig. 5.6(a). In this setup, individual photons are emitted 
and sent through the beam splitter. The beam splitter has a 50% chance of reflecting 
the photon and a 50% chance of transmitting it. Detectors are placed at both the 
reflected and transmitted paths, and the path taken by the photon is measured. At 
this juncture, we are measuring individual photons, positioning us firmly within the 
quantum regime, rather than the classical optics regime. Given that the photon’s 
behavior at the beam splitter is inherently random due to quantum mechanics, the 
detector outcomes generate a truly random binary sequence.
|0) — H - 
= 0/1
(a) QRNG with Photons
Figure 5.6: Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)
(b) QRNG with Qubits
QRNG Using Qubits
Another approach to QRNGs is to exploit the quantum superposition and measure­
ment process. A qubit is prepared in a superposition of its basis states, typically by 
applying a Hadamard gate to the initial state, as shown in Fig. 5.6(b). The qubit is 
then measured in the computational basis, collapsing the superposition to either 0 
or 1 with equal probability. The measurement outcome serves as a random bit. The 
circuit is run repeated to produce a string of random bits of desired length.
Equivalence
The equivalence between these two methods can be understood by comparing 
the role of the beam splitter in the photon approach to that of the Hadamard 
gate in the superposition-measurement approach. The beam splitter places an 
incoming photon into a superposition of potential paths (reflected or transmitted), 
introducing quantum uncertainty. Similarly, the Hadamard gate places a qubit into 
a superposition of its basis states. When the photon or the qubit is observed or 
measured, this superposition results in inherent quantum randomness due to the 
unpredictability of the outcome. Both mechanisms, therefore, harness quantum 
superposition to generate random bits.
Exercise 5.14 * The QRNG devices discussed above generate binary sequences 
that correspond to random numbers with a uniform distribution. Discuss how you 

5.5 The BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol
124
would transform these uniformly distributed random numbers into numbers that 
follow a Gaussian distribution and a Poisson distribution. Consider the following 
in your discussion:
(a) Describe any algorithms or mathematical transformations you would use to 
achieve these distributions from a uniform distribution.
(b) Discuss any practical considerations or limitations that might arise when 
implementing these transformations, especially in the context of using a 
quantum device.
(c) Discuss how the properties of quantum randomness impacts the quality or 
characteristics of the generated numbers compared to classical methods.
5.5 The BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol
Another application that primarily uses single-qubit gates is the BB84 Quantum 
Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol. As we will discuss next, this protocol serves as 
a beautiful showcase of the real-world application of quantum measurements and 
quantum gates.
5.5.1 Fundamentals of Cryptography
1 
Cryptography
Cryptography comprises techniques for safeguarding communication and data against 
adversaries. Cryptographic systems fall into two main categories:
• Secret (or symmetric) key cryptography, where both parties utilize a shared 
key for encryption and decryption.
• Public (or asymmetric) key cryptography, which employs a dual-key system 
with public and private components. While data encrypted using the public 
key can only be decrypted using the private key, the significant overhead 
usually makes this method more suitable for exchanging secret keys.
2 
Key Exchange Protocols
Key exchange protocols serve as intermediaries to facilitate the secure sharing 
of secret keys between parties. Classical key exchange protocols often employ 
asymmetric cryptographic techniques. Notable examples include:
• Diffie-Hellman key exchange is based on the difficulty of the discrete loga­
rithm problem in a finite field. Both parties use their respective private and 
shared public parameters to generate an identical shared secret, which is 
computationally infeasible to deduce from the public parameters.
• RSA key exchange utilizes the RSA algorithm, an asymmetric cryptographic 
technique. The public key encrypts the shared secret, and only the private 
key can decrypt it. RSA relies on the computational difficulty of integer 
factorization.
• Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key exchange operates similarly to the 
original Diffie-Hellman but employs elliptic curve cryptography, providing 

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
125
equivalent security with shorter key lengths, thus being computationally more 
efficient.
• Lattice-based key exchange is a more recent approach, considered to be resistant 
to attacks from quantum computers, hence termed “quantum-safe.” These also 
usually employ asymmetric cryptographic principles.
It is worth mentioning that asymmetric cryptographic techniques, especially 
in protocols like RSA and Diffie-Hellman, are often used specifically for the key 
exchange process. Once the key has been securely exchanged, communication 
might then switch to a symmetric key cryptographic scheme, which is generally less 
computationally intensive.
3 
Quantum Computing and Cryptography
The advent of quantum computing poses significant threats to traditional crypto­
graphic protocols. Shor’s algorithm, for example, can efficiently factor large integers 
and compute discrete logarithms, effectively breaking RSA and Diffie-Hellman pro­
tocols. This vulnerability has led to an ongoing effort in the field of post-quantum 
cryptography, which aims to develop cryptographic protocols that are secure against 
quantum attacks. Some of the emerging options include lattice-based, code-based, 
and multivariate polynomial cryptography [14].
4 
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)
QKD leverages quantum mechanics to deliver a categorically secure public-key 
cryptosystem. QKD protocols can even detect potential eavesdroppers.
Notable QKD protocols include:
• BB84, proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984, serves as one 
of the foundational QKD protocols.
• E91, which relies on entangled qubit pairs to establish a secure communication 
channel.
• B92, a less complex yet also less efficient variant of BB84.
• SARG04, an error-resilient protocol that draws inspiration from BB84.
• COW, which is compatible with existing telecommunications infrastructure 
and also takes inspiration from BB84.
5.5.2 Introduction to the BB84 QKD Protocol
The BB84 QKD protocol is renowned as the inaugural and a quintessential QKD 
protocol. It facilitates Alice and Bob in establishing a confidential shared key, 
suitable for secure communication via classical encryption methods. By exploiting 
quantum mechanics properties, including the no-cloning theorem, the BB84 protocol 
underscores the potential of quantum physics for bolstering communication security.
Within this protocol, Alice constructs a series of qubits (typically photons) with 
bases and states determined randomly. She transmits these qubits to Bob through 
a quantum channel, who then measures the received qubits using randomly opted 
bases. Subsequently, they utilize a public classical channel to compare their bases, 
retaining matches and dismissing mismatches. This shared set of measurement 
results becomes their secret key.

5.5 The BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol 
126
The protocol’s security stems from the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (HUP, 
see § 1.6) and the no-cloning theorem (see § 5.1). Owing to the HUP, an eavesdropper 
cannot simultaneously and precisely measure both bases, given their non-orthogonal 
nature. The no-cloning theorem affirms the inability to perfectly replicate unknown 
quantum states, impeding an eavesdropper’s attempt to intercept and relay qubits 
undetected. Consequently, any eavesdropping introduces errors, detectable during 
the error-checking phase, which alerts Alice and Bob to the need for restarting the 
transmission.
5.5.3 Procedure of the BB84 QKD Protocol
Typically, employing photon polarization, the BB84 protocol comprises five pivotal 
steps, elucidated in Fig. 5.7:
Figure 5.7: Fundamental BB84 QKD Protocol
1 
Photon Generation and Distribution
Alice uses a QRNG to generate a random bit sequence. For each bit, she also 
randomly chooses either the rectilinear (HV) or diagonal (DA) basis. She then 
encodes the bits into photon polarizations based on the chosen bases:
• H polarization for bit 0 in the rectilinear basis

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
127
• V polarization for bit 1 in the rectilinear basis
• D polarization for bit 0 in the diagonal basis
• A polarization for bit 1 in the diagonal basis
The rectilinear basis, synonymous with the computational basis, aligns the H and 
V polarizations with |0) and |1) states, respectively. The diagonal basis mirrors 
the {|+), |—)} basis, associating the D (45^) polarization with |+) and the A 
(135°) polarization with |—).
Alice then dispatches the photons to Bob through a quantum medium, which 
could be a free space light beam or an optical fiber.
2 
Measurement
Upon receiving each photon, Bob employs a randomly chosen basis (also either 
rectilinear or diagonal) to measure each photon’s polarization. If Bob’s basis aligns 
with Alice’s, he discerns the intended bit. Otherwise, his measurement might diverge. 
This disparity is illustrated in Fig. 5.7.
3 
Basis Announcement
Via a classical public channel, Bob notifies Alice of his measurement bases without 
disclosing the results.
4 
Key Shifting
Comparing bases, Alice and Bob retain results from matching bases and eliminate 
the rest. They then split the remaining sifted bits for eavesdropping detection 
and as a shared secret key. Typically, these groups might span 128 and 2048 bits, 
respectively. However, Fig. 5.7 only illustrates this with 4 bits for each group.
5 
Eavesdropping Check
Alice and Bob examine the first sifted key group to identify potential eavesdropping, 
as demonstrated in the column labeled “Eaves. Check” in Fig. 5.7. Any detected 
breach compels them to discard the key, initiating a new BB84 QKD session.
5.5.4 Detection of Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping refers to the act of intercepting or copying the quantum states of qubits 
(typically photons) during a quantum communication process. An eavesdropper, 
often referred to as Eve, may attempt to gain information about the transmitted 
key by measuring these qubits. However, the fundamental principles of quantum 
mechanics naturally limit her ability to do so without detection.
The Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle (HUP) posits that one cannot measure 
both the rectilinear and diagonal polarization states of a qubit with arbitrary 
precision at the same time. This is due to the inherent non-orthogonality of the two 
bases. Consequently, when Eve measures the qubits using an incorrect basis, she 
invariably disturbs the states, introducing potential errors in the transmitted key.
Furthermore, the No-Cloning Theorem (see § 5.1.3) emphasizes that it is un­
feasible to produce identical copies of an unknown quantum state. This theorem 

5.5 The BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol
128
considerably hinders Eve’s chances of intercepting and replicating quantum states 
without alerting the communicating parties.
There are a few notable scenarios wherein Eve might try to eavesdrop:
1. Eve selects the incorrect basis, leading to an altered qubit:
• Should Bob opt for the correct basis, the introduced error by Eve becomes 
detectable.
• On the other hand, if Bob selects an incorrect basis, the result is inherently 
random, thus keeping Eve concealed.
2. Eve picks the correct basis, leaving the qubit unaffected:
• If Bob subsequently chooses the correct basis, Eve remains undetected 
while successfully acquiring one bit of the key.
• Conversely, if Bob selects the wrong basis, the outcome remains unpre­
dictable, and Eve’s presence stays hidden.
Given these conditions, the probability of detecting Eve when using n check bits 
can be expressed as:
P(Detection of Eve with n check bits) = 1 — 
. 
(5.26)
For ensuring a security confidence level of 99.9%, Alice and Bob would need to 
implement error-checking by comparing a subset of 30 bits from the key to discern 
any potential eavesdropping activities.
Exercise 5.15 Describe the BB84 protocol for Quantum Key Distribution. Your 
description should include:
(a) The process of key generation and distribution between Alice and Bob.
(b) The role of the quantum and classical channels.
(c) The method used to detect eavesdropping by a third party (Eve).
(d) The procedure for key sifting and reconciliation.
5.5.5 BB84 QKD Implementation with Qubits
The BB84 protocol, which we have previously explained using photon polarization, 
can also be generalized to employ any qubit system in principle.
1 
Key Steps
The key steps of the BB84 protocol using general qubits are outlined below, mirroring 
the same steps in the photon implementation.
1. Alice prepares qubits randomly in one of four states (|0), |1), |+), |—)) and 
sends them to Bob. The key information is encoded in two bases:
• Computational basis: {|0), |1)}, where |0) encodes bit 0 and |1) encodes 
bit 1.

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates 129
• Hadamard basis: {|+), |—)}, where |+) encodes bit 0 and |—) encodes 
bit 1.
2. Bob measures the received qubits using a randomly chosen basis.
3. Alice and Bob reveal the bases they used for preparing and measuring the 
qubits through a classical communication channel.
4. They keep the bits where both Alice and Bob used the same basis and discard 
the rest. The remaining bits form the shared secret key.
5. They examine a segment of sifted key to identify potential eavesdropping.
2 
Implementation with Quantum Gates
Alice
Bob
Figure 5.8: BB84 QKD Implementation with Qubits
In this generalized implementation, illustrated in Fig. 5.8, the BB84 protocol 
uses qubits in four states: |0), |1), |+), and |—). By convention, single lines represent 
qubits (or quantum channels), while double lines represent classical bits (or classical 
channels). Alice employs the following methods to prepare her qubit states:
• |0): The qubit is always initialized in the |0) state.
• |1): Apply an X gate after initialization.
• |+): Apply a Hadamard (H) gate after initialization.
• |—): Apply an X gate followed by an H gate after initialization.
Alice’s X and H gates are controlled by two independent Quantum Random 
Number Generator (QRND) devices. A gate is switched into effect if the output bit 
from its corresponding QRND is 1; otherwise, it does not change the qubit state.
Similarly, when Bob receives a qubit, he selects a random basis using a QRND- 
controlled H gate. The circuit is meant to run repeatedly to produce a random 
binary string of desired length.

5.5.6 * Further Exploration
The BB84 QKD protocol leverages the fundamental properties of quantum mechanics 
to establish a secure communication channel. While classical encryption techniques 
can be rendered ineffective by the advancement of computing capabilities (especially 
quantum computers), the security of the BB84 protocol is grounded in the immutable 
principles of quantum mechanics, making it a future-proof solution for secure 
communication.
However, practical implementations of the BB84 protocol do face challenges 
such as photon loss, noise, and equipment imperfections. Continuous research and 
development efforts are necessary to address these issues and ensure the successful 
deployment of QKD systems in real-world scenarios. For readers interested in

5.6 The Quantum Coin Game
Prepare to explore an exciting game: the fair coin game, with Alice and Bob putting 
a quantum twist on it! This is not merely a game between these two players but 
an intriguing introduction to the world of quantum algorithms. You, the reader, 
are invited to follow along as we unravel the fascinating potentials of this quantum 
challenge.
5.6.1 The Game Rules
To ensure fairness and adaptability in the quantum version of the game, we will use 
the “Coin in Box” version of the game. Here are the game rules:
Figure 5.9: Fair Coin Gate - Setup and Rules
1. Alice Preparation: Alice places the coin in a state of her choice (heads or tails 
on top) in a box that covers the coin. (Note this is a special coin. Even by 
touching the coin, it is impossible to determine which side is up.)
2. Bob Operation: Bob reaches into the box and has the choice to flip the coin 
over or not. Alice cannot see what he is doing.
3. Alice Operation: Alice reaches into the box and performs an operation of her 
choice (flip or not flip). Bob cannot see what she is doing.
4. Uncover and Check: The coin is uncovered, and the result is read.
• If it is Heads, Alice wins.
• If it is Tails, Bob wins.
Is it a fair game? In the classical version, you bet.
Now let’s consider the quantum version of the game:
Figure 5.10: Quantum Coin Gate - Setup and Rules
The rules are the same as the classical version mentioned above. However, the 
following changes are made:

5.6 The Quantum Coin Game
132
1. The coin is now represented by a qubit, with |0) representing Heads and |1) 
representing Tails.
2. A flip operation corresponds to the application of a NOT gate, which swaps 
the states |0) and |1).
3. A non-flip operation corresponds to the application of the Identity (I) gate.
4. In addition to the flip and non-flip operations, Alice and Bob are allowed to 
use other single-qubit gates (labeled G1 , G2, and G3 in
 in their 
strategies.
 Fig. 5.10)
5. In the Preparation step, the qubit is initially in state |0). However, Alice can 
apply a quantum gate to change it to another state.
6. The final Uncover and Check step is replaced by quantum measurement. If 
the measurement outcome is |0), Alice wins; if it is |1), Bob wins.
In this quantum version of the game, players can use the principles of quantum 
mechanics to devise new strategies and possibly gain an advantage over their 
opponent.
5.6.2 Alice Always Wins!
In the quantum case, Alice can win each time by using the Hadamard (H) gate. 
Here’s the strategy:
Figure 5.11: Strategy in Which Alice Always Wins
1. Alice applies the Hadamard gate, putting the qubit in an equal superposition 
state |+) = (|0) + |1», namely, H |0) = |+).
2. Regardless of whether Bob applies the I gate or the X gate, the qubit remains 
in a superposition state. However, in either case, the qubit state is unchanged, 
because 11+) = |+) and X |+) = |+).
3. Alice applies the Hadamard gate again, converting |+) back to |0) since 
H + = |0).
4. They measure the final state. However, since the final state will always be |0), 
Alice will win every time.

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
133
By introducing the Hadamard gate into the game strategically, Alice ensures 
that the final state of the qubit is always Heads (|0)), allowing her to win the game 
every time!
5.6.3 Bob’s Strategy Shift
Assuming Alice keeps her current strategy of using the Hadamard gate, Bob can 
adapt his strategy to change the game’s outcome in his favor. Here’s how Bob can 
use other gates to beat Alice:
Figure 5.12: Strategy Shift: Bob Beats Alice
1. Alice applies the Hadamard gate, putting the qubit in an equal superposition 
state |+).
2. Bob applies the Pauli-Y gate to the qubit instead of X or I . After applying 
the Y gate, the qubit state becomes — i^1=(|0) — |1)), which is | —), since the 
global phase (-i) can be ignored.
3. Alice applies the Hadamard gate again. The resulting qubit state is |1) because 
H — = |1>.
4. They measure the final state. Since the outcome is |1), Bob wins.
By using the Y gate strategically, Bob can change the outcome of the game and 
beat Alice!
5.6.4 Alice Overcomes Bob’s New Gambit
If Bob continues using his new strategy with the Y gate, Alice can also revise her 
strategy to beat Bob again. How can that be done? She can compose a new gate G 
using a gate sequence.
Figure 5.13: Strategy Revised: Alice Wins Again
Exercise 5.17 Assuming Bob continues using his new strategy with the Y gate, 
Alice would revise her strategy to beat Bob again. What gate can she use to 
achieve this? Here is a hint: XHYH |0) = i |0).

5.7 * The No-Cloning Theorem: Proof Outline
134
You can imagine that, since they have mastered quantum gates and sequences, 
Alice and Bob could revise their strategies continuously, playing happily thereafter.
5.7 *The No-Cloning Theorem: Proof Outline
The no-cloning theorem, as introduced in § 5.1.3, asserts that it is impossible to 
produce an exact replica of an arbitrary unknown quantum state using any physically 
realizable quantum operation. This section provides a proof of the theorem. Given 
that the proof involves concepts of multi-qubit gate operation, it is recommended 
that readers come back to this section after familiarizing themselves with these 
concepts in Chapter 7.

Figure 5.14: Illustration of the No-Cloning Theorem
Let’s consider unitary operations first: a hypothetical quantum cloning machine 
represented by a unitary operator U. This operator acts on a quantum state |^), 
which we wish to clone, and an ancillary state |0), prepared for the cloning process. 
After applying U, our goal is to obtain two identical copies of | ^).
Additionally, the cloning system may involve extra qubits. Assuming these qubits 
are initially in the |0) state without loss of generality, the cloning process can be
described by:
U(|^} ® |0) ® |0)®n) = |^} ® |^} ® |f (^)), 
(5.27)
where | f (^)) represents the state of the extra qubits after cloning.
To demonstrate the impossibility of such cloning, we proceed by contradiction. 
Assume that the same operator U can clone the states |0), 11), and |+) = — (|0)+11))- 
This leads to the following equations:
U(|0> ® |0) ® |0)®n) = |0) ® |0) ® |f (0)>, 
(5.28a)
U(| 1> ® 0 ® |0)®n) = |1) ® |1) ® |f (1)>, 
(5.28b)
U(|+> ® 0 ® |0)®n) = |+) ® |+) ® |f (+)>. 
(5.28c)
By the linearity of U, adding the first two equations and multiplying by 1 gives:
U(|+> ® |0) ® |0)®n) = 1(|00> ® | f (0)) + |11> ® |f (1))). 
(5.29)
However, the third equation implies:
U(|+> ® 0 ® |0)®n) = 2(|00> + |01> + |10> + |11» ® | f (+)). 
(5.30)
The right-hand sides of Eqs. 5.29 and 5.30 represent different quantum states, 
because measuring the first two qubits in the former yields two possible outcomes 

Chapter 5. Single-Qubit Quantum Gates
135
(|00) and |11)), while the latter yields four different outcomes. This contradiction 
confirms that it is impossible to create an exact replica of an arbitrary unknown 
quantum state using only unitary quantum operations.
The proof of the No-Cloning Theorem, demonstrated for unitary transformations 
above, can be extended to include Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) 
maps, which encompass measurements and other quantum operations. This extension 
is outlined in § 12.2.9. Thus, the No-Cloning Theorem is not limited to unitary 
operators alone; it establishes that it is impossible to create an identical copy of an 
arbitrary unknown quantum state using any physically realizable quantum operation.
5.8 Summary and Conclusions
Understanding Quantum Gates
Throughout this chapter, we navigated the integral concept of quantum gates, which 
are foundational to quantum computing. Just as Newtonian mechanics underpins 
satellite launches, core quantum mechanics principles play a pivotal role in shaping 
and managing quantum gates. We expanded on our prior knowledge of quantum 
mechanics and qubits, venturing into the world of quantum gates.
Our introduction began with single-qubit gates, giving us a grasp on their varied 
applications. This groundwork paves the way for deeper insights into multi-qubit 
gates, entanglement, quantum teleportation, and the E91 quantum key distribution 
in future discussions.
Distinguishing Quantum from Classical Gates
We emphasized the difference between quantum gates and their classical counterparts. 
Classical gates modify classical bits, while quantum gates act on qubits, allowing the 
creation of quantum circuits adept at processing and storing quantum information. 
These discussions shed light on the divergences and parallels between classical and 
quantum computing.
Our look into single-qubit gates, like the Pauli and Hadamard gates, showcased 
the extensive possibilities unlocked when these gates are paired together, enabling 
quantum circuits to address challenges daunting for classical systems.
Real-World Quantum Applications
We explored applications such as the Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) 
and the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) Protocol. These applications 
highlighted the practical significance of quantum gates, enhancing our understanding 
of quantum measurements and their uses. The Quantum Coin Game served as a 
practical demonstration of the potential within quantum algorithms.
The Next Step: Multi-Qubit Systems
After solidifying our understanding of single-qubit gate principles and applications, 
we are ready to delve into multi-qubit systems. This forthcoming exploration 
will establish the foundation for multi-qubit gates and the enigmatic concept of 
quantum entanglement. While classical mechanics employs straightforward addition 
to describe systems, we will see how quantum mechanics uses the tensor product 

Problem Set 5

to represent states of joint quantum systems, offering a more complex interaction 
framework.
Looking Ahead
The next chapter will spotlight multi-qubit systems, an essential preface to advanced 
topics such as multi-qubit gates and quantum entanglement. Our focus will be on 
the composition principle in quantum mechanics, offering clarity on how quantum 
systems are distinctively represented compared to the classical sum-based approach. 
We’ll aim to understand the nuances of quantum particle interactions and their 
progression over time, preparing us for an in-depth study of multi-qubit gates in 
subsequent chapters.

In this chapter, we explore the exciting and complex realm of multi-qubit systems. 
This crucial understanding is a stepping stone towards more advanced topics in 
quantum computation, such as multi-qubit gates and quantum entanglement. The 
defining principle governing these composite quantum systems is the composition 
principle in quantum mechanics, a concept that markedly separates the quantum 
world from classical mechanics.

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems 
139
In classical Newtonian mechanics, individual subsystems and their interactions 
are described with straightforward addition. For instance, the combined effect of 
individual forces acting on a system can be depicted as the simple sum of these 
forces, as portrayed by the equation ma = F.
On the other hand, quantum mechanics approaches this differently. It utilizes 
state vectors and quantum operators to encapsulate the behavior and interactions 
of subsystems. According to the composition principle in quantum mechanics, the 
joint state of multiple quantum subsystems is captured by the tensor product of 
their individual states. This crucial distinction sets quantum mechanics apart from 
the additive principle that governs classical systems.
The tensor product principle allows us to understand the intricate dance of 
quantum particles and their time evolution. Moreover, it is an essential tool to 
describe entanglement, one of the most fascinating and puzzling phenomena of 
quantum physics.
In this chapter, we delve into the intriguing world of multiple qubits, setting the 
stage for a deeper investigation of multi-qubit gates in the subsequent chapter.
6.1 Systems of Two Qubits
Embarking on the journey of multi-qubit systems, we initially focus on the two-qubit 
system. The understanding gleaned from two-qubit systems will build our intuition 
and elucidate the more complex principles of multi-qubit systems, while concurrently 
demonstrating the underlying connection with single-qubit systems.
6.1.1 Review of Single Qubit States
The state of a single qubit can be represented as a two-dimensional complex vector:
|^} = a |0) + p |1). 
(6.1)
Mathematically, we express this as |^) € C2, with C2 symbolizing a complex 
Hilbert space of two dimensions. In the context of quantum computing, where 
we focus on finite dimensions, a Hilbert space is essentially a vector space that is 
equipped with an inner product.
The state vector |^) is normalized, which means:
(^ | ^) = | a |2 + | P |2 = aa * + PP * = 1. 
(6.2)
When we measure the qubit in the basis {|0), 11)}, we obtain |0) with probability 
|a|2 and |1) with probability |P|2.
The vectors |0) and |1) form the standard (or computational) basis of the state 
space C2 . They are orthonormal, which means:
<i | j) = 5i,j. 
(6.3)
Here i, j € {0, 1}, and Sij is the Kronecker delta, which is defined as Sij = 1 if 
i = j and Sijj = 0 otherwise.

6.1 Systems of Two Qubits
140
6.1.2 Two-Qubit States: Developing Intuition
Now consider two independent qubits, A and B . Their state vectors are represented 
as
|i:A} = a |0A} + P |1 A}, |^B} = Y |0B} + 5 |1 B}, 
(6.4)
where a,P,Y, 5 are complex coefficients such that |a|2 + |P|2 = 1 and |y|2 + 1512 = 1.
We can view the two qubits as a combined quantum system, which should be 
consistent with our view of them as two separate systems. Let’s check this out.
According to the principles of quantum mechanics, the state vector of the 
combined two-qubit system, given that the two qubits are independent, is represented 
as the tensor product of the individual states:
|$ab} = |^a} ® |^b} = (a |0A} + P |1 A)) ® (Y |0B} + 5 |1 B)). 
(6.5)
By expanding this equation, we find:
|^AB} = aY |0A} ® |0B} + a5 |0a} ® |1 B} + Py |1 a} ® |0B} + P5 |1 a} ® |1 B}. (6.6)
1 
Normalization Verification
To validate the quantum state |^AB), let’s confirm it is normalized:
( ^ab | ^ab ) = | aY |2 + | a512 + | Py |2 + | P512
= (|a|2 + |P|2)(|Y|2 + |5|2)
= 1. 
(6.7)
2 
Single-Qubit Measurement Verification
Suppose we measure qubit A and obtain |0A). This process should select the terms 
with |0A) in our state vector, i.e., aY |0A) ® |0B) + a5 |0A) ® |1 B). Interpreting the 
complex coefficients as probability amplitudes for |0A) ® |0B) and |0A) ® |1 B), the 
associated probability is
P|0 a ) = | aY |2 + |a5 |2
= |a|2(|Y|2 + |5|2)
= |a|2. 
(6.8)
This result matches our expectation when considering qubit A independently. 
The same method can be applied for measuring |1 A), |0B), and |1 B). The probability 
interpretation remains consistent in all cases.
3 
Two-Qubit Measurement Verification
Assume we measure qubit A and obtain |0A), and simultaneously measure qubit 
B and obtain |0B). The joint probability of these two measurement outcomes in 
independent systems would be |a|2|Y|2. In a combined quantum system, these 
measurements select the term aY |0A) ® |0B) from the state vector. The probability 
is given by the square of the coefficient, which also results in |aY |2 , thereby providing 
a consistent representation.

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
141
4 
Orthonormal Basis Verification
To extend our state vector to represent generic two-qubit states, including interacting 
qubits, we require the terms |0A) ® |0B), |0A) ® |1 B), etc., to form an orthonormal 
basis.
For this, we can express the basis states in matrix form:
|0) = 1 , 
|1) =
(6.9)
By applying the tensor product rules for matrices, we get:
|0 A) ® |0 B) =

These equations clearly indicate that the set {|iA) ® |jB)} (i,j e {0, 1}) is 
orthonormal, meaning each pair of vectors is orthogonal, and each vector has unit 
length.
The two-qubit state space is four-dimensional. Since the above set contains four 
independent elements, it also spans the entire vector space and hence, it forms a 
complete orthonormal basis for this state space.
5 
Tensor Product of Operators
In our discussion so far, we have successfully established that the state vector of 
two independent qubits can be represented as the tensor product of their individual 
state vectors. But how does this formalism extend to the operators that act on these 
state vectors?
Consider two operators: UA acting on |^A) and UB acting on |^B). For our 
combined two-qubit state, it is natural to anticipate the combined operator as the 
tensor product UA ® UB, resulting in the state (UA ® UB) |^AB). This expectation 
is supported by the tensor product property:
(UA ® UB)(|^A} ® |^B)) = (UA |^A)) ® (UB |^B)). 
(6.11)
This relationship confirms the anticipated behavior of tensor product operators 
on combined state vectors.
6 
Shorthand Notation
For succinctness, we will use |00) instead of |0A) ® |0B) from this point forward, 
where the first position represents qubit A, and the second position represents qubit 
B . Other combinations will follow the same convention. Therefore, our earlier state 
vector in Eq. 6.6 simplifies to:
|^AB) = aY |00> + aS |01> + ^y 110> + $S |11>. 
(6.12)

6.1 Systems of Two Qubits 
142
The four basis states are now represented as |00), |01), |10), and |11). Their 
orthonormal condition can be expressed as:
(ij | kl) = Sik 5ji,
(6.13)
where i, j e {0, 1}, and Sij is the Kronecker delta function.
Exercise 6.1 Consider the state
|*)  = -12(0 + |1» ® -L(|0)- 2i |1»
(a) Express |^) in terms of |00), |01), |10), and |11).
(b) Compute the probability of the first qubit being in state |1).
(c) Compute the probability of the first qubit being in state |0) and the second 
qubit being in state |1).
6.1.3 General States vs. Product States
1 
General Two-Qubit States
In our system of two qubits, the state space is four-dimensional with basis states 
|00), |01), |10), and |11). This allows us to construct a general two-qubit state as a 
linear combination of these basis states:
|^> = jzL Cij |ij> = c00 |00> + c01101> + c 10 |10> + c 11 |U) ■ 
(6.14)
Here, cij are complex coefficients such that |cij |2 = 1. Therefore, a general 
state for a two-qubit system is a vector in the four-dimensional complex Hilbert 
space C4.
2 
Product States
The state |^AB) = |^A) ® |^B) referred to in Eq. 6.12 is a specific instance known 
as a product state.
A product state is defined as one where the state vector can be expressed as the 
tensor product of the state vectors of the individual qubits. It represents a system 
of independent qubits.
3 
Non-Product States
Apart from product states, there exist states that cannot be expressed as a tensor 
product of individual qubit states. An example of such a state is the Bell state, also 
known as an EPR pair:
M = -12(|00) + |11» ■ 
(6.15)
This state cannot be written as a tensor product of individual qubit states.

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
143
Proof. If we assume that —2 (|00) + |11)) could be expressed by Eq. 6.12, we find 
that aY = 06 = —2 and a6 = 0y = 0. However, these two conditions are impossible 
to satisfy simultaneously. 
□
Non-product states like these exhibit entanglement, a unique quantum phe­
nomenon where the state of one qubit is interconnected with the state of the other, 
which we will study extensively later.
Exercise 6.2 Demonstrate that |^-) = -12(|01) — |10)) is a non-product state.
Exercise 6.3 Prove that 1 (|00) — 110) — |01) + 111)) is a product state and identify 
the two component states.
6.2 * Measurements of Two-Qubit Systems
We introduced a broad framework for quantum measurement in § 3.4. This section 
delves deeper by extending this framework to encompass the measurements of 
composite quantum systems, specifically those involving multiple qubits.
To provide a clear perspective, we will primarily focus on a composite quantum 
system comprising two subsystems, A and B. However, it’s essential to note that the 
principles we discuss are readily extendable to more intricate systems consisting of 
multiple subsystems. These subsystems can be formed by qubits or other advanced 
quantum particles. When addressing the measurements of such composite systems, 
the tensor product structure of the state space becomes crucial, as do potential 
correlations between the subsystems. In the subsequent sections, we will elucidate 
the two predominant types of quantum measurements suited for these composite 
systems.
6.2.1 * Local Measurements on Subsystems
In quantum mechanics, a local measurement refers to a measurement performed 
on one subsystem of a composite system, leaving the other subsystem(s) physically 
undisturbed. The measurement operation applies only to the subsystem of interest, 
and the outcome pertains solely to the state of this subsystem.
For a composite system composed of subsystems A and B , the local measurement 
operators for a measurement on subsystem A or B can be expressed as Mi ® IB 
and IA ® Mi respectively, where Mi represents the measurement operators of the 
subsystem in focus and IA and IB are identity operators on subsystems A and B .
The sequence in which local measurements are made is not essential, as each 
measurement operates independently on its respective subsystem. Mathematically, 
Mi ® IB and IA ® Mi commute. The primary aim of local measurements is to 
uncover properties of the individual subsystem.

Entangled States vs. Product States
Entangled States
For entangled states, the state of the composite system cannot be fully described 

6.2 * Measurements of Two-Qubit Systems
144
by the states of its individual subsystems. When a measurement is made on one 
subsystem of an entangled pair, our description of the overall system, and hence of 
the other subsystem, must be updated. This can affect the potential outcomes of 
subsequent measurements on the other subsystem.
For instance, consider a two-qubit entangled state like the Bell state |$+) = 
12 (|00) + |11)). If a measurement on subsystem A yields the result |0), the entire 
system collapses into state |00), thus determining that any subsequent measurement 
on subsystem B would yield |0). Conversely, if the measurement on subsystem 
A results in |1), the entire system collapses into state |11), and a subsequent 
measurement on B would yield |1). This reflects the profound correlation that is 
characteristic of entangled states, underlining the fact that while no direct interaction 
occurs between the subsystems during a local measurement, the measurement can 
nevertheless affect our description and future measurement predictions of the other 
subsystem.
Product States
In contrast to entangled states, for product states such as |^AB) = |^A) ® |^B), 
the system can be entirely described by the states of its individual subsystems, 
and the measurement outcome on one subsystem does not affect our understanding 
or predictions of the other subsystem. Furthermore, in this case, we can apply 
measurement operators directly to the individual subsystem states. For instance, 
(Mi ® Ib) |^AB) simplifies to (Mi |^a}) ® |^b).
If we perform a measurement on subsystem A and find it in some state |^A), 
this does not impact the state or potential measurement outcomes for subsystem 
B, which remains in its original state |^B). Consequently, for product states, the 
measurements on individual subsystems are truly independent, and each subsystem 
can be analyzed separately without the need to consider their correlations. This 
decoupling of subsystems is a hallmark of product states. It illustrates that even 
though the universe is composed of many quantum systems, we can treat each one 
independently if it is isolated from the rest.

Local Measurements in the Computational Basis
To gain a deeper understanding and operational proficiency on measurements on 
composite quantum systems, it is necessary to study the related mathematics. Let’s 
start with local measurements in the computational (or standard) basis.
When measuring in the computational basis, the single-qubit measurement 
operators corresponding to the outcomes |0) and |1) are:
Mi = |i}(i|, 
(6.16)
where i e {0,1}. Note that these are projection operators with the property 
Mi2 = Mi .
The two-qubit measurement operators for measuring on qubit A and qubit B 
are:
MiA = |i)(i|® I, MiB = I ®|i)(i| ■ 
(6.17)
When performing local measurements on the general two-qubit state given by

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
145
|^= jS Cij |ij> ’ 
(6-14)
we first apply the two-qubit measurement operators on |^):
M0A |^} _(|0)(0|0 I)
52 cij |ij} _ c00 |00> + c01 |01>, 
i,j e{0,1}
(6.18a)

_ c 10 |10) + c 11 | 11) ,
(6.18b)
M0b |^) _(10 |0><0|)- -- 
_ c00 |00> + c 10 |10>,
(6.18c)
M1 b |^) _(10 |1><1|)-... 
_ c01 |01> + c 11 |11> -
(6.18d)
Then, we can calculate the associated probabilities according to Eq. 3.38:
P0A _ IIM0A |^)||2 _ IIc00 |00) + c01 |01)||2 _ |c00 |2 + |c01|2,
(6.19a)
P1A _ ---
_ |c 10|2 + |c 11|2,
(6.19b)
P0B _ ---
_ |c00|2 + |c10|2,
(6.19c)
P1B 
---
_ |c01|2 + |c 11|2-
(6.19d)
Next, we will focus on measuring qubit A and obtaining |0). Other scenarios are 
similar. The post-measurement state is calculated according to Eq. 3.41:
। , _ _ Moa |^_ coo |00) + c01|01) _ 0 0 (c00 |0) + c0111))
VP0A 
-\Z|coo |2 + |c01 |2 
-\Z|c00 |2 + |c01 |2
(6.20)
This clearly shows the system collapses to a product state upon measurement, 
with qubit A in |0) and qubit B in |yiB|0A) _ N(c00 |0) + c0111)), where N represents 
normalization, in this case, dividing by |c00|2 + |c01|2.
The state of qubit B can also be calculated through the partial product:
|‘-B|0a} _ N (0A |^, 
(6.21)
where the index A in (0A | indicates that it interacts only with the state of qubit 
A in |^) through inner product, while leaving the state of qubit B unchanged. (In 
matrix operation, (0A|^) is equivalent to ((0| 0 I) |^).)
At this point, if we measure qubit B and get outcome |1), the system will collapse 
to |01). The probability for this outcome (A getting |0) and B getting |1)) is
P1B,0A _ P0A |c01 /y/1c00 |2 + |c01121 _ |c01|2- 
(6.22)
As you can see, the joint probability for the outcome |01) depends only on c01 
as expected, and it does not depend on the order of the measurements on qubits A 
and B .
The results so far is illustrated in Fig. 6.1.
If we assign the value A0 _ 1 to |0) and A 1 _ —1 to |1), as is the case when 
measuring spin, we can calculate the expected value (statistical average) of A using 
Eq. 3.40:

3 Local Measurements in Alternate Bases
After familiarizing ourselves with the mechanics of measurements in the computa­
tional basis, we will now extend our discussion to local measurements in other bases. 
We will focus on one of the most common alternative bases: the Hadamard basis, 
with basis states |+) and |—), defined as:
+ — -1=(|0) + |1», 
|—) — -=(|0) — |1» ■
(6.25a)
(6.25b)
Consider the following observable:
M — |+X+| — HH ■
(6.26)
We can verify that M is a Hermitian operator, thereby qualifying it as an 
observable. When we use M to measure a qubit, the outcome will be either |+) or 
|—), the eigenstates of M. This observable associates the eigenvalue +1 with the 
outcome |+), and the eigenvalue —1 with the outcome |—).

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems 
147
Let’s now use M to measure one of the Bell states, which are entangled states:
| *)  = -—=(|00) + |11»■
To facilitate this, we will use the following properties:
(+|0) = <+|1> = <-|0) = -1=, <-|1) = --=
(6.27)
(6.28)
We apply M to the first qubit. In this process, we first derive the following 
intermediate quantities (un-normalized states):
Similarly,
|^+a) = (|+)( + | ® I) |^)
= -1=(|+><+||0> 110) + |+x+||1> 111>)
= 11+>® (0 +11»

(6.29b)
(6.29c)
(6.29d)
| * - A ) = (|—X — |® I) | *)  = -1= | — — > ■
(6.29e)
The probability of obtaining the outcome |+) is |||^+A)||2 = 2. Upon measuring 
and obtaining the outcome |+), the state of the first qubit collapses to |+). Simulta­
neously, the state of the second qubit also collapses to |+), resulting in the two-qubit 
system being in the product state |++). Likewise for the outcome |—).
The expected value of M when measured on the first qubit is:
($ | M ® I | $ ) = ( $|(| $+A ) - | $ - A ))) = 0 ■
(6.30)
Exercise 6.5 Consider M = a |+)(+1 + b |— )(-|, and |^) = cos a |00) + sin a |11), 
where a,b,a e R.
(a) Show that M is an observable.
(b) Describe the measurement outcomes, associated probabilities, and post­
measurement states of the second qubit when the first qubit is measured 
with M.
(c) Compute the expected value of M: (^|M|^).
In quantum computing, measurements are typically conducted in the computa­
tional basis due to its native support on quantum hardware. To measure |^) in the 
|+), |—) basis, we first need to convert it to the computational basis. This can be 
achieved by applying Hadamard gates:
H |+) = |0), H |-) = |1), 
H |0) = |+), H |1) = - ■
(6.31a)
(6.31b)

6.2 * Measurements of Two-Qubit Systems
148
After this transformation, we perform local measurements on the two qubits. 
For instance, if the measurement readouts are both 0, we deduce that the original 
state in the |+), |—) basis was |++). This logic can be similarly applied to other 
sets of readouts. The process is illustrated in Fig. 6.2.

4 * An Advanced Example
This example features advanced mathematical concepts and techniques. While 
first-time learners may opt to skip it initially, revisiting this content is recom­
mended for a deeper understanding of Bell inequalities discussed in subsequent 
sections.
Consider qubit A measured along a direction defined by the polar angle a and 
the azimuthal angle 0 on the Bloch sphere. Effectively, it is measured using the 
basis {|a), |a±)}:
| a>=cos 2 |0)+sin 21,
|a4 = - sin 2 |0) + cos a |1).
(6.32a)
(6.32b)
The associated observable is:
Ma = |a){a| - |a±)(a±|.
(6.33)
Similarly, qubit B is measured along a different direction defined by the polar 
angle 2 on the Bloch sphere. The measurement basis {|b), |b±)} is:
|b} = cos 2 |0) + sin 2 |1), 
(6.34a)
|b±) = - sin 22 |0) + cos 2 |1}. 
(6.34b)
The associated observable is:
Mb = | b)(b |-| b ±)( b ±|. 
(6.35)
Let’s consider the combined observable which represents the product (or correla­
tion) of two local measurements:
Mab = Ma ® Mb.
(6.36)
To measure the state |^) = —(|00) + |11)), we start with the expected values of 
Ma across the one-qubit basis states:

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
149
(0| Ma |0) = cos a, 
(1| Ma |1) = - cos a, 
(1| Ma |0) = sin a, 
(0| Ma |1) = sin a.
(6.37a)
(6.37b)
(6.37c)
(6.37d)
Now calculate the expected values of Mab across the two-qubit basis states:
< 11| (Ma ® Mb) |11> = (1| Ma |1) (1| Mb |1) = cos a cos P,
< 00| (Ma ® Mb) |00> = (0| Ma |0) (0| Mb |0) = cos a cos P,
< 11| (Ma ® Mb) |00> = (1| Ma |0) (1| Mb |0) = sin a sin P,
< 00| (Ma ® Mb) |11> = (0| Ma |1) (0| Mb |1) = sin a sin P.
Finally, we obtain:
{^|Mab |^) = cos a cos P + sin a sin P = cos(a — P).
(6.38a)
(6.38b)
(6.38c)
(6.38d)
(6.39)
6.2.2 * Joint Measurements
In a joint measurement, the measurement operator simultaneously acts on all 
subsystems under consideration. For instance, in a two-qubit system, we may 
measure a property that involves both qubits, and the measurement operator is 
a 4 x 4 matrix. The probabilities and post-measurement states are calculated by 
applying the joint measurement operator to the entire composite system state.
1 
Parity Measurement
Consider two qubits in a system. They can be in the states |00), |01), |10), or |11). 
Our task is to measure the system and distinguish |00) and |11) as a group, and 
|01) and 110) as another, while leaving the state of the system unchanged.
This objective can be achieved using a parity measurement, which determines 
whether the total count of |1) states is even or odd. To be specific, |00) and |11) 
have even parity since there are either 0 or 2 |1) states. Conversely, |01) and |10) 
have odd parity due to the presence of one |1) state.
The parity measurement operator, when applied to the combined state of two 
qubits, is:
PZ = Z ® Z = |00><00| + |11><111 — |01><011 - |10><10|.
(6.40)
The states |00) and |11) are eigenvectors of PZ with an eigenvalue of 1, whereas 
|01) and |10) are eigenvectors with an eigenvalue of —1. Thus, a measurement 
reading of 1 indicates even parity and —1 indicates odd parity. Since these states 
are eigenvectors of PZ , the measurement leaves them unchanged.
Building on this, the mechanism can also be extended to superposition states. 
Consider the two superposition states:
|^even) = a |00) + P |11) , 
|4odd) = Y |01> + 5 |10) .
(6.41a)
(6.41b)

6.2 * Measurements of Two-Qubit Systems
150
These states are also eigenvectors of PZ :
PZ |tyeven) — |tyeven) , 
PZ |^odd) — - |^odd) ■
(6.42a)
(6.42b)
When measuring a general state of the form | ^) — ^^ cij | ij) using PZ, the 
state collapses to either |^even) or |^odd), corresponding to measurement readings 
of 1 or -1, respectively. However, if the system is already in |^even) or |^odd), the 
PZ measurement leaves the state undisturbed, highlighting the essence of parity 
measurement.
Parity measurements can discern groups of qubit states because the measurement 
operator has degenerate eigenvalues, leading to corresponding subspaces in its 
eigenspace. Specifically, the degenerate eigenvalues of 1 and —1 correspond to 
two different subspaces: one spanned by the even parity states |00) and |11), and 
the other by the odd parity states |01) and |10). These subspaces are used to 
classify the qubits into groups without changing their states.
Analogous to PZ , there is a phase-parity measurement, which measures in the 
{|+), |-)} basis and counts the number of |+) states. Its operator is represented as:
Px — X ® X — |++)(++| + |——)(——| — |+—)(+—| — |—+)(—+| ■ 
(6.43)
Parity measurements are crucial in numerous quantum algorithms and protocols. 
For instance, they are foundational in quantum error correction for detecting both 
bit and phase flip errors. Additionally, they are employed in certain quantum 
teleportation protocols, wherein the parity of two qubits informs the requisite 
correction operation for the teleported qubit.
To execute a parity measurement on an actual quantum device, one generally 
needs the capability to conduct controlled operations (such as a CNOT gate) to gen­
erate entanglement between the qubits. Subsequent individual qubit measurements 
then yield the parity of the initial state. This will be explored further in the context 
of error correction in § 12.4.
2 
Bell Measurement
A Bell measurement, also known as a Bell state measurement or entanglement 
measurement, is a type of quantum measurement that is particularly important for 
quantum information processing tasks such as quantum teleportation and superdense 
coding. In essence, a Bell measurement is a joint measurement on a two-qubit system 
that distinguishes between the four mutually orthogonal entangled states, called 
Bell states. More specifically, a Bell measurement results in one of four possible 
outcomes and transforms the state of the two qubits into one of the four Bell states 
corresponding to the measurement outcome.
While a Bell measurement can be described theoretically, performing a Bell 
measurement on a real quantum computer is non-trivial. It requires a sequence of 
quantum gates that effectively transform the Bell basis into the computational basis. 
This typically involves a CNOT gate, with the first qubit as the control and the 
second as the target, followed by a Hadamard gate applied to the first qubit. Finally, 

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
151
individual measurements are performed on each qubit. The measurement results 
then allow us to determine which of the four Bell states the system was in. We will 
explore this further in Chapter 8 when we investigate entanglement and Bell states 
in detail.
Exercise 6.6 This is a key exercise that tests your basic understanding of quantum 
measurements. Ensure you can complete it independently.
Consider a system of three qubits (A, B, and C), in the state
1 $} = ZL cijk |ijk} ,
(6.44)
i,j,k e{0,1}
where |ijk) represents the joint computational basis states of the qubits A, B, 
and C, and cijk are complex coefficients.
(a) Calculate the probability of measuring the third qubit (C) in the state |0).
(b) If qubit C is measured and collapses to |0), determine the resulting joint 
state of qubits A and B. Also, describe the state of the three-qubit system.
(c) Assuming a Bell measurement is performed on qubits A and B and the 
outcome is |$+) = 1= (|00) + 111)), find the probability of this outcome and 
describe the post-measurement state of the three-qubit system.
6.3 Multi-Qubit System States
Having introduced the fundamental concepts of composite quantum systems with 
two-qubit examples, we will now expand our discussion to encompass n-qubit systems, 
also referred to many-body systems in quantum mechanics. The dimension of the 
state space for such a system is N = 2n , and correspondingly, an operator in this 
space would be an N x N matrix. This is a major factor contributing to the potential 
exponential computational capacity of quantum computers.
How large can n and N be in practical quantum computing? When n = 300, we 
find that N = 2300, which is approximately 1090. This figure surpasses the estimated 
number of atoms in our observable universe. As of 2024, quantum computers 
with up to n = 1000 qubits already exist. Theoretically, these computers possess 
immense computational capacity. However, in practice, they are plagued by errors 
and instability due to qubit decoherence. Facilitating error correction necessitates 
additional qubits. It is estimated that to have a quantum computer with 1000 
error-free logical qubits, we would need approximately a million (n = 106) physical 
qubits.
The Role of Entanglement in Quantum Computing
In an n-qubit system, if all qubits are independent, their collective product state 
can be described using just 2n complex numbers. However, when the qubits 
are entangled, describing their state requires up to 2n complex numbers. This 
significant increase in representational complexity is a key to why quantum 
computers can potentially achieve substantial speedups over classical computers.

6.3 Multi-Qubit System States
152
Thus, entanglement is not just a feature of quantum systems; it is a crucial 
prerequisite for the enhanced computational power of quantum computing.
6.3.1 The Composition Postulate of Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics leverages state vectors and quantum operators to delineate the 
behavior of quantum systems and their interactions. The Composition Postulate 
in quantum mechanics stipulates that the collective state of two or more quantum 
systems is described by the tensor product of their individual states. More succinctly, 
the joint state space of two or more quantum systems is the tensor product of their 
individual state spaces.
Postulate 5: Composite Systems
When two or more quantum systems are combined, their joint state space is 
described by the tensor product of the state spaces of the constituent systems.
The tensor product provides a mechanism to combine two Hilbert spaces, HA 
and HB , into a larger Hilbert space, denoted as HAB . As per the Composition 
Postulate, the joint state space of the combined system AB is described by the 
tensor product of the individual state spaces:
Hab = Ha ® Hb .
(6.45)
This implies that the basis states of HAB are derived from the tensor product 
of the basis states of the individual spaces. Let’s say the basis states for system A 
are | ai) and for system B are | bj). Consequently, the basis states for the combined 
system AB are:
|aibj} = |ai} ® |bj}.
(6.46)
If the dimension of HA is m, and that of HB is n, the resulting dimension of 
HAB is mn.
6.3.2 Basis States
For an n-qubit system, the state space is described by the tensor product of the 
individual qubit state spaces. A single qubit is described by a two-dimensional 
complex Hilbert space. Therefore, an n-qubit system will be described by an 
N -dimensional complex Hilbert space, where N = 2n .
The basis for an n-qubit system is a set of orthonormal states that span the 
Hilbert space of the composite quantum system. A standard choice for the basis of 
an n-qubit system is the computational basis (also known as the standard basis). 
The computational basis is formed by taking the tensor product of the individual 
qubit basis states, as follows:
For a single qubit, the basis states are |0) and |1). For n-qubits, take the tensor 
product of the individual qubit basis states to create a set of N orthonormal basis 
states.

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
153
1 
Binary Representation
In the binary representation, each basis state corresponds to a binary string of length 
n, with each digit representing a qubit in the state |0) or |1). For example, for a 
two-qubit system, the basis states are |00), |01), |10), and |11). The computational 
basis states for an n-qubit system are represented by:
|0 •• • 00), |0 ••• 01), |0 ••• 10), ••• , |1 ••• 11), 
(6.47)
where each binary string corresponds to a unique basis state.
These binary strings can be thought of as names, or tags, of the basis states. 
The vector of each basis state is a column vector of dimension N, with a ‘1’ at the 
position indexed by the corresponding binary number. For example,
|0 ••• 00) = [1 0 
••• 
0 0] T ,
|1 ••• 11) = [0 0 
••• 
0 1] T .
These basis states are orthonormal, because each basis state has exactly one ‘1’ 
in it, each at a different position.
A general n-qubit state can be written as:
| ^) = 
^2 
Cx 1 x 2 ••• xn | x 1 x 2 ••• Xn ) , 
(6.48)
or in this compact form:
|^> = E Cx ।x> • 
(6-49)
This binary representation is particularly useful when working with the ten­
sor product structure of the n-qubit Hilbert space, as each binary string directly 
corresponds to the tensor product of individual qubit states.
2 
Decimal Representation
There is also the decimal representation which uses decimal numbers ranging from 0 
to N - 1 (where N = 2n) to label the basis states:
|0), |1), |2), ••• , | N - 1), 
(6.50)
and a general n-qubit state can be written as
AT-1
|^) ^^2 Ck |k} • 
(6-51)
k=0
In this representation, each basis state is labeled by a decimal number, which 
corresponds to the decimal equivalent of the binary string representation. The total 
number of basis states is still N. For example, for a 2-qubit system, the basis states 
are |0), |1), |2), and |3), which correspond to the binary notations |00), |01), |10), 
and |11), respectively-

6.3 Multi-Qubit System States
154
For those who are reading about this for the first time, it’s important to note 
that the contents inside the |-) are merely labels. In the computational basis, each 
basis state is a vector of length N = 2n, having exactly one ‘1’ in its structure, 
with the rest being zeros. See Eq. 6.10 for an example of two qubits.
This decimal representation is convenient when working with the Hilbert space 
as a whole, especially when dealing with quantum gates or other linear operators 
that act on the entire Hilbert space rather than individual qubits.
6.3.3 Product States, Entangled States, and Correlated States
We have already introduced the concepts of product and entangled states within the 
context of two-qubit systems. In the case of composite quantum systems comprising 
n-qubits, quantum states can be broadly classified into pure states and mixed 
states. Pure states include product states and entangled states. Mixed states can be 
correlated or uncorrelated.
1 Product States
A product state for an n-qubit composite quantum system is a state that can be 
expressed as the tensor product of the individual states of each qubit. Mathematically, 
an n-qubit product state can be written as:
| ^ 1 ^ 2 ••• 'fin) = | fi 1) ® | fi 2) ® • • • ® | fin), 
(6.52)
where |fii) signifies the state of the i-th qubit. In this scenario, the qubits are 
not entangled, meaning their states can be described independently of each other. 
Product states are separable, indicating that they can be factored into individual 
qubit states.
There can also be product states where only some qubits are independent of the 
rest, such as in the case of |fi 1) ® |fi2 • • • fin
Verifying Properties of Tensor Products
To confirm the mathematical consistency of product states and operations 
involving them, consider the following properties of tensor products:
Due to the following property of tensor product,
(A1 ® A 2 • •• ® An)(B1 ® B 2 ••• ® Bn) = (A1B1) ® (A 2 B 2) ••• ® (AnBn), (6.53)
we know the composite state is normalized if the component states are, because
(^ 1 ^ 2 • •• ^n | ^ 1 ^ 2 • •• ^n } = (^ 1| ^ 1) ® ^ 2| ^ 2} ••• ® (^n | ^n } = 1. 
(6.54)
Furthermore, operators can be ‘distributed’ into the tensor products:
(A1 ® A 2 • • • ® An | ^ 1 ® ^ 2 • • • ® ^n ) = (A1 | ^ 1)) ®(A 2 | ^ 2)) • • -® (An | ^n )) . (6.55)

2 Entangled States
Entangled states are characterized by the inability to describe the quantum state of 
one qubit independently of the other qubits in the system. Entangled states exhibit 
stronger correlations than classical correlations, reflecting their inherently quantum 
mechanical nature. These states cannot be expressed as a product of individual 
qubit states and display nonlocal correlations that are fundamental to quantum 
information processing, including quantum communication, quantum cryptography, 
and quantum computing.
A prominent example of an entangled state is the GHZ state (Greenberger-Horne- 
Zeilinger state):
|GHZ) = -12( |00 • •• 0) + 111 • •• 1)). 
(6.56)
This state is non-factorizable into a product of individual qubit states, and the 
measurement outcomes on one qubit demonstrate nonlocal correlations with the 
measurement outcomes on the other qubits.
As an aside, let’s use the following “compact” expressions of the GHZ state to 
illustrate some interesting notations associated with the tensor product:
|GHZ) = — 
|0) + ® |1>J 
(6.57a)
2 i=1 
i=1
= — (|0)®n + |1>®”) . 
(6.57b)
These expressions illustrate the use of the tensor product symbol, ®, in the 
context of a state space composed of multiple qubits. The use of 0n=1 and ®n 
effectively conveys the tensor product of n qubits, each in the state |0) or |1).
Exercise 6.7 Consider an n-qubit GHZ state given by Eq. 6.57, where n > 2. 
Determine the state of the rest of the system after the following measurements:
(a) The first qubit is measured with an outcome |0).
(b) The first qubit is measured with an outcome |+), where |+) = —2(|0) +11)).
(c) The first two qubits are measured with an outcome corresponding to the 
projection onto the state —2 (|00) + |11)).
(d) The first two qubits are measured with an outcome corresponding to the 
projection onto the state —2 (|01) + 110)).
3 * Correlated States
Correlated states describe composite system states wherein the properties of one 
qubit are statistically linked to the properties of other qubits in the system. These 
correlations can arise due to interactions between the qubits, shared environments, 
or common preparation procedures. Correlated states can be either entangled or 
classically correlated.

6.3 Multi-Qubit System States 
156
Classically correlated states, while not entangled, still exhibit correlations between 
the qubits. These correlations are akin to classical correlations in statistical systems, 
wherein knowledge of one qubit provides information about other qubits, but each 
qubit can still be described by individual quantum states.
An example of a classically correlated n-qubit state is (expressed as a density 
matrix):
pn = p 1 |00••• 0)(0••• 0| + p2 |11 ••• 1)(1 ••• 1|, 
(6.58)
where p1 and p2 are probabilities that satisfy p1 + p2 = 1.
Correlated states are a special case of mixed states, which we will explore in 
§ 12.2.
6.3.4 * Identical Particles
i While the discussion on fermions and bosons is not broadly applicable to general 
quantum computing, it does hold relevance in specialized scenarios such as 
quantum chemistry simulations. Furthermore, anyons directly link to emerging 
platforms in quantum computing. This section is thus intended to provide both 
context and an overview of particle statistics in quantum systems.
The Composition Postulate in quantum mechanics, as previously described, 
applies to distinguishable quantum systems. In these systems, like qubits, each unit 
can be uniquely identified, and the joint state space is the tensor product of the 
individual state spaces.
For unbound, indistinguishable particles, the joint state space is still constructed 
using the tensor product of the individual state spaces. However, the overall state 
(wavefunction) of the combined system must satisfy certain symmetry requirements, 
which depend on whether the particles are fermions or bosons.
Fermions and bosons are elementary particles that follow different statistical 
behaviors due to their intrinsic properties. Fermions, particles with half-integer 
spin such as electrons, protons, and neutrons, follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Bosons, 
which have integer spin, like photons and certain atomic nuclei, follow Bose-Einstein 
statistics.
In contrast, qubits, even if they are based on half or integer spin particles, are 
localized in space, making them distinguishable from one another. Hence, their 
combined quantum states are formed according to the regular Composition Postulate, 
without needing to account for the symmetrization (for bosons) or antisymmetrization 
(for fermions) rules that apply to free, indistinguishable particles.
When combining indistinguishable quantum systems, the Composition Postulate 
is modified as follows:
• Fermions: Fermions adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which prevents two 
fermions from simultaneously occupying the same quantum state. Therefore, 
the combined state of multiple identical fermions must be antisymmetric under 
the exchange of any pair of fermions. This can be mathematically expressed 
using a Slater determinant or through second quantization formalism, which 

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
157
6.4
6.4.1
ensures that the overall wavefunction changes sign upon the exchange of any 
two fermions.
• Bosons: Bosons, unlike fermions, can simultaneously occupy the same quantum 
state. The combined state of multiple identical bosons must be symmetric under 
the exchange of any pair of bosons. This symmetry can be expressed using 
symmetrization operators or second quantization formalism, which guarantees 
that the overall wavefunction remains unchanged upon the exchange of any 
two bosons.
• Anyons: Anyons are a class of quasiparticles in two-dimensional systems 
that do not strictly follow Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein statistics. Instead, 
their wave functions acquire a complex phase upon exchanging positions, 
providing a unique behavior that lies between fermionic and bosonic statistics. 
This property makes them particularly intriguing for quantum computing. 
Anyonic systems, such as those realized in certain quantum Hall systems, are 
actively researched as platforms for topological quantum computing. In this 
computational paradigm, the quantum information is stored in the topological 
features of the system, making it robust against local errors. The anyonic 
braiding operations, where anyons are moved around each other, can serve as 
fault-tolerant quantum gates, significantly contributing to the robustness and 
scalability of a quantum computer.
* Measurements of Multi-Qubit Systems
The principles developed through two-qubit systems extend to multi-qubit systems 
for measurements, as outlined in § 6.2. We now enrich this understanding with 
additional insights and generalized formulae.
* Measurements on a Single Qubit
Assume we have an n-qubit system in a general superposition state:
I $} = 
52 
Cx 1 x 2 ••• xn I x 1 x 2 ••• Xn } ’ 
(Copy of 6.48)
If we measure the first qubit in the computational basis, the post-measurement 
state of the entire system will exist as a superposition of states where the first qubit 
is either in state |0) or in state |1), depending on the measurement outcome.
Assuming |0) is the measurement result, the associated probability is
P01 = 
E 
I c 0 x 2-xn I2. 
(6.59)
x 2 , •■■ ,xn 6{0,1}
The post-measurement state of the entire system would comprise a superposition 
of all states with the first qubit in state |0), normalized by the probability of obtaining 
|0>:

(6.60b)

6.4 * Measurements of Multi-Qubit Systems
158
After the measurement, the first qubit becomes disentangled from the rest of the 
system. Here |^'n—1) represents the post-measurement state of the remaining n — 1 
qubits:
| ^n — 1) — 
I------ c0 c, 
c 0 X 2--- Xn |x 2 ••• xn ) •
P PqX x 2 , ••• ,xn 6{°, 1}
(6.61)
Let’s introduce the partial product notation:
(y (j) | X 1 X 2 ••• Xj ••■ Xn ) = (y | Xj ) | x 1 x 2 • • • Xj — 1 Xj+1 • • • Xn ) • 
(6.62)
Note that in this notation, the bra (y(j) | does not match in length with the ket 
|x 1 x2 • • • xnInstead, the index j in (y(j)| indicates that it interacts only with the 
corresponding |Xj) through the inner product, while leaving the states of all other 
qubits unchanged. This concept can be generalized to situations where there are 
multiple y’s.
Then the probability of measuring the first qubit with outcome |0) can be 
expressed in this shorthand form:
Po(1) — ||<0(1)|^>||2 • 
(6.63)
And the post-measurement state |^'n—1) is given by:
| C—1) —
.’ 
(0(1)| ^) •
(1)
P0
(6.64)
An analogous treatment can be done for the case where we obtained |1) as the 
measurement result, but it won’t be elaborated here.
Exercise 6.8 Consider the methodology outlined in Eqs. 6.60 to 6.64 for the case 
of measuring the first qubit and obtaining the outcome |0).
Your task is to replicate this analysis, but now assume that it’s the last qubit 
being measured, and the measurement outcome is |1).
6.4.2 * Measurements on a Group of Qubits
To extend our previous discussion, where only the first qubit was measured, let’s 
consider dividing the system into two sections, each referred to as a ‘register’: one 
with m qubits and the other with k = n — m qubits. If we perform a measurement 
on the m-qubit register, the post-measurement state of the entire system, depending 
on the measurement outcome, will be a superposition of states corresponding to 
that outcome, normalized appropriately. This process is often referred to as partial 
measurement.
For instance, the probability of obtaining a certain outcome |a 1 a2 • • • am) for 
measuring the first m qubits is given by, in the partial product notation:
p — 11/a(1)a(2) ••• a(m)|^112

Figure 6.4: A Partial Measurement Paradigm for Quantum Algorithms
As an application of the partial measurement formulation discussed above, we 
examine a foundational model of measurement frequently employed in quantum 
algorithms.
Implementation of a Function
In Fig. 6.4(a), we show how a function f (x) is commonly implemented as a unitary 
transformation Uf. The first m-qubit register, labeled |x 1), |x2), ■ ■ ■, |xm), encodes 

6.4 * Measurements of Multi-Qubit Systems 
160
the input x. You can think of x as an m-bit string or a number made of the m 
binary digits.
The output of the function is the second register of k qubits, labeled |y 1), |y2), 
..., |yk). Similarly, you can regard these as representing the binary digits of the 
numerical output of f (x). The function can also be understood in vector form:
[y1, y2,. . . , yk]T = f ([x1, x2, . . . , xm]T). 
(6.68)
The function f can be a one-to-one or many-to-one function. Below are some 
examples:
1. IsPrime Function: The output is one bit. y = 1 if x is a prime number, and 
y = 0 otherwise.
2. Mod-N Function: The output needs at least log2 N qubits, representing y = x 
mod N. Here, N is an integer smaller than 2k .
Note that the output is put into a separate second register, while the input is 
preserved in the first register. It is designed this way so that the transformation is 
Uf invertible (in fact, unitary), as required by quantum mechanics.
2 
Uniform Superposition Input
Employing a superposition state as the input is a powerful tool of quantum computa­
tion, as demonstrated in Fig. 6.4(b). The Hadamard gate, denoted by H, transforms 
|0) into |+) = ^12(|0> + |1))- This operation equips the input register at ^1 with a 
uniform superposition of al l m-qubit basis states, which is mathematically formulated 
as:
|in = |+)®m = £ |x}, 
(6.69)
x e{0,1} m
and the combined system state at the input is given by:
|*1) = £ Ix)®|0)®k . 
(6.70)
Due to the linearity of the transform Uf , the output register becomes:
|out> =12 |f(x)}, 
(6-71)
xe{0,1}m
and the combined system state at the output is given by:
|*2>  = E 
I x >®| f (x)). 
(6.72)
3 
Measuring the Output
When we measure the output register, we obtain one of the possible values of 
f(x), which we denote as y. Note that each measurement yields a y randomly. 
According to Eq. 6.66, the system collapses into a state where the second register 
is |y). Simultaneously, the first register is projected onto a superposition of only 

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
161
those states |x) for which f (x) = y. This effectively singles out, within the first 
register, the superposition of all states corresponding to the pre-image of y under f. 
This superposition, which mathematically represents the solution set to the equation 
f (x) = y, is denoted by |x):
|x) = E 
|x). 
(6.73)
X e{0,1} m 
f (x )=y
Below are some examples:
1. IsPrime: If f(x) is the IsPrime function given above, and the measurement 
outcome is 1, then |x) contains all the prime numbers less than 2m. Conversely, 
if the measurement outcome is 0, |x) contains all the non-prime numbers less 
than 2m .
2. Modular Exponentiation: f(x) = px mod N , where N and p are coprime 
integers with p < N . This function is periodic with some period r, such that 
f(x) = f(x + nr) for any integer n.
Upon measuring the output and obtaining a value y, if f (x0) = y for some x0, 
then |x) is a superposition of the form |x0) + |x0 + r) + |x0 + 2r)+|x0 + 3r)+---- ,
due to the periodicity of f (x). Applying the quantum Fourier transform to |x) 
can reveal the period r . Discovering this period r enables an efficient method 
to factorize N , which is the foundational principle of Shor’s algorithm.
This measurement paradigm is a key component in many quantum algorithms, 
including those of Simon and Shor, as well as in schemes for public-key quantum 
money (§ 11.3.2).
Exercise 6.9 Consider the Mod-N function with N = 5 and m = 5, i.e., y = x 
mod 5 with 0 < x < 32. Assuming you have already prepared the system in 
a state of uniform superposition over all possible x values, apply the partial 
measurement paradigm as detailed in § 6.4.3.
(a) What are the possible measurement outcomes?
(b) If the measurement outcome is y = 1, what is the set of values for x?
6.4.4 * Measurements in Alternate Bases
While most quantum computing devices natively support measurements in the 
computational basis, there are scenarios demanding measurements in other bases. In 
such cases, one would typically apply a basis rotation just before the measurement.
Consider an n-qubit state, |^). If we wish to measure it in an orthonormal basis, 
denoted by {|0i)}, the necessary unitary transformation U can be constructed as:
U =E| i >< & ।, 
(6-74)
i=0
where |i) refers to an n-qubit computational basis state in decimal notation.

6.5 * Time Evolution of Multi-Qubit States
162
As demonstrated in § 3.4.5, a measurement of U |^) in the computational basis 
is equivalent to measuring |^) in the basis {|0i)}. This concept is illustrated in 
Fig. 6.5.
The probabilities from the measurement form a distribution over the possible 
outcomes, which represents the likelihood of the state |^) being projected onto each 
of the basis states, {|$i)}:
Pi = |< h | * )|2 ■
(6.75)
An equivalent perspective is to consider the probabilities associated with U |^) 
with respect to the computational basis:
Pi = | <i|U|t) |2■

Consider the scenario where this measurement is performed repeatedly on the 
circuit. After accumulating a significant number of repetitions, one can derive a 
statistical average of the readouts.
Given this context, your tasks are as follows:
(a) Determine the expression for the measurement result, articulating it in 
terms of an inner product.
(b) Discuss the interpretation of the derived measurement result.
6.5 * Time Evolution of Multi-Qubit States
We have learned that Schrodinger equation governs the time evolution of the state 
of a quantum system, such as a qubit or an atom. In the context of multi-qubit 

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems 
163
systems, the Schrodinger equation governs the time evolution of the joint state 
vector of the system, given by Eq. 6.48.
6.5.1 * Two-Qubit System
The Hamiltonian of a system of two qubits, A and B , is composed of individual 
Hamiltonians for each qubit and a possible interaction term:
HAB = HA ® IB + I A ® HB + Hint • 
(6.77)
Here, HA and HB are the Hamiltonians of qubits A and B , and IA and IB are 
the identity operators in their respective Hilbert spaces. The term Hint takes into 
account of the interaction between the two qubits, which depends on the specific 
physical implementation of the qubits and the type of interaction between them.
The Schrodinger equation for the two-qubit system is given by:
inddt |(t)) = HAB |(t)) • 
(6.78)
This equation governs the time evolution of the joint state vector |^AB (t)) in 
the presence of interactions between the two qubits.
The solution to this time-dependent Schrodinger equation can be expressed 
formally in terms of a time-ordered exponential:
|^ab(t)} = e-iHABt/h |^ab(0)> • 
(6.79)
This is a direct application of the time-evolution operator. Note that this solution 
assumes that the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time.
6.5.2 * Multi-Qubit System
For an n-qubit system, the Schrodinger equation and Hamiltonian generalize natu­
rally. The Hamiltonian of an n-qubit system is composed of individual Hamiltonians 
for each qubit and all possible interaction terms:
H = 
' Hi ® I-i + 
' Hij ® I-ij + • • • • 
(6.80)
i=1 
i<j
Here, Hi are the individual Hamiltonians associated with the i-th qubit. These 
Hamiltonians govern the local dynamics of each qubit, which could be due to an 
external field or some local potential. I-i denotes the identity operators on all other 
qubits except the i-th qubit. By using the identity operator on these other qubits, 
we ensure that the Hamiltonian Hi only acts on the i-th qubit and leaves the other 
qubits unaffected.
Hij are the interaction Hamiltonians between the i-th and j-th qubits. These 
represent the influence of one qubit on another and could describe a variety of 
interactions, such as spin-spin interactions or couplings mediated by some external 
field. Again, I-ij are the identity operators on all other qubits except the i, j-th 
qubits, ensuring that the interaction Hamiltonian Hij only affects the qubits it is 
meant to.

6.5 * Time Evolution of Multi-Qubit States
164
Note that this is a general form of a multi-qubit Hamiltonian and the exact form 
of Hi and Hij will depend on the specific quantum system being described. For 
example, in the Ising model discussed below, the Hij terms are given by Jij Zi Zj .
The ellipsis at the end of the equation indicates that this structure can be 
extended to incorporate interactions among larger groups of qubits, should your 
specific system require it. However, in many practical cases, one often restricts 
to single-qubit and two-qubit interactions due to their physical realisability and 
computational manageability.
The Schrodinger equation for the n-qubit system becomes:
ih dt । ^ (t= H | ^ (t■ 
(6-81)
If the Hamiltonian does not explicitly depend on time, the above equation has a 
solution given by:
|^(t)} = U(t) |^(0)), 
(6.82)
where U (t) is the time-evolution operator:
U (t) = e -iHt/h ■ 
(6.83)
6.5.3 * Example: The Ising Model
The transverse field Ising model (TFIM), Ising model for short, is a well-known model 
in condensed matter physics that describes a system of spins under the influence 
of a transverse magnetic field. In the context of quantum computing, it serves as 
a canonical example of a multi-qubit system whose ground state can be efficiently 
prepared on a quantum computer, and therefore, it can be used for various quantum 
optimization and simulation algorithms.
The Hamiltonian of the TFIM is given by:
H = <2 JijZiZj - rExi^
(6.84)
There are two terms that make up the Hamiltonian of the transverse field Ising 
model:
(1) 
i<j Jij Zi Zj : This is the Ising interaction term. Here the sum is taken over 
all pairs of neighboring spins i and j on a lattice. The i < j in the sum ensures the 
pairs are not double counted. Jij denotes the strength of interaction between the ith 
and j th spins. Zi and Zj are the Pauli Z operators that operate on the spins at the 
ith and jth locations, respectively. Thus, Zi Zj represents the operation performed 
on the spins at the ith and jth locations, i.e., it operates on the state |i) |j). See 
Fig. 6.6.
In the above notation, ZiZj is a shorthand for Zi ® Zj, acting on spins i and j.
Similarly, Xi is a shorthand for Xi ® I-i, where I-i denotes the identity 
operators on all other qubits except the i-th qubit.

Chapter 6. Multi-Qubit Systems
165
Figure 6.6: Illustration of Ising Interaction
(2) 
-r i Xi: This is the transverse field term, where the sum runs over all spins 
i on the lattice. The parameter T denotes the strength of the transverse magnetic 
field. The Pauli X operator, represented by Xi , operates on the spin at the ith 
location and flips it. The negative sign indicates that the transverse field tries to 
align the spins along the x-axis, opposing the Ising interaction.
The two terms do not commute, making the exact time evolution of this system 
non-trivial. However, using methods such as Trotterization, one can efficiently 
simulate the time evolution of the TFIM on a quantum computer.
The Ising model provides a bridge between physical systems and computational 
problems, allowing the use of quantum devices to solve problems of practical interest. 
We will explore its applications in § 11.2.
6.5.4 * Example: CNOT Gate Implementation
The CNOT gate is a two-qubit operation. In many high-level descriptions, the intri­
cacies of this operation are simplified using quantum gates depicted by their unitary 
transformations. However, for professionals engaged in quantum hardware imple­
mentation, comprehending the foundational concepts dictated by the Schrodinger 
equation remains essential.
The formal definition of the CNOT operator is provided in § 7.1.1:

= 2(I ® I + Z ® I +1 ® X - Z ® X).
(6.85a)
(6.85b)
(6.85c)
In the context of Hamiltonian evolution, the key element in the CNOT operator 
is the term 1 (Z ® X), symbolizing the interaction between the two qubits.
The typical Hamiltonian, instrumental in realizing the CNOT gate, is represented
as:

6.6 Summary and Conclusions
166
HCNOT = - -^t (Z 0 X).
(6.86)
Utilizing this Hamiltonian, we can substantiate that during a time evolution 
spanning At and accompanied by singular qubit rotations, the two-qubit system 
undergoes a transformation analogous to the CNOT gate action.
To validate this, let us revisit a generic matrix property: for any normal matrix 
A with A2 = I, it holds that e* eA = cos OI + i sin OA. In the context of our scenario, 
(Z 0 X)2 = I 0 I, where I 0 I is the 4 x 4 identity matrix. Thus, we can infer:

The exploration of multi-qubit systems in this chapter serves as a cornerstone for 
more advanced topics in quantum computation. As we transitioned from the familiar 
realm of classical Newtonian mechanics with its additive principles, we dove into the 
quantum domain governed by the tensor product principle. This principle emerges 
as the defining aspect of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical 
mechanics.
Our journey began with an examination of the two-qubit system, gradually 
expanding our scope to systems of n qubits. By doing so, we highlighted the

exponential complexity in terms of state space and computational capabilities. While 
practical applications remain limited due to challenges such as qubit decoherence, 
the theoretical underpinnings suggest immense potential, especially when error 
correction methods mature in the future.
Measurements in Multi-Qubit Systems
An integral part of this chapter was dedicated to understanding measurements in 
multi-qubit systems. We revisited the quantum measurement framework, extending 
its application to composite quantum systems, especially those with multiple qubits. 
The distinction between local measurements on subsystems and joint measurements 
was elaborated upon. Emphasis was placed on the tensor product structure of state 
space and the associated correlations between subsystems.
Time Evolution and Quantum Interactions
By invoking the Schrodinger equation, we shed light on the time evolution of multi­
qubit systems. Exploring both two-qubit and n-qubit systems, we grasped the 
intricacies of their evolution. Practical applications and examples, such as the 
Ising model and the CNOT gate implementation, further illustrated these abstract 
principles.
Practical Implications and Challenges
While the theoretical implications of multi-qubit systems are profound, practical 
challenges such as qubit decoherence pose hurdles. This interplay between theory 
and practicality will be significant as quantum computing progresses, with error 
correction emerging as a fundamental area of research.
Upcoming Topics
As we venture into the subsequent chapters, our focus will shift to multi-qubit 
quantum gates. These gates, vital for quantum computing, operate on multiple 
qubits simultaneously and embody properties distinct from single-qubit gates. We 
will explore commonly used multi-qubit gates, universal gate sets, gate sequences, 
and introduce new tools like the Boolean representation of quantum gates and 
circuits. This transition will lay a firm foundation for advanced topics in quantum 
computing and information processing.

corresponding to one of the Bell states, specifically |^-) = 112(|01) — 110)).
Your task is to construct equations that determine the probability of this 
measurement outcome and the resulting post-measurement state of the system.

m-bit binary strings. This function is a component of Simon’s algorithm.
Assuming you have already prepared the system in a state of uniform superpo­
sition over all possible x values, apply the partial measurement paradigm as 
detailed in § 6.4.3. Describe the resulting state |x) upon measurement of the 
system. (The Simon’s algorithm hinges on getting information of s from |x) 
using a subsequent Hadamard transform.)

example 0101 • • • ), the XOR transform is defined as follows:

Multi-qubit gates serve a critical function in quantum computing, primarily due 
to their ability to create and manipulate entangled states. These states, which are 

Chapter 7. Multi-Qubit Quantum Gates
171
essential for executing universal quantum algorithms, cannot be generated using 
single-qubit gates alone. Unlike single-qubit gates that apply unitary transforma­
tions to individual qubits, multi-qubit gates extend their action to multiple qubits 
simultaneously. They act on an n-qubit state space, making their corresponding 
matrix representation a 2n x 2n matrix, where n denotes the number of qubits 
involved.
Despite the unique and critical role they play, multi-qubit gates maintain the key 
property of being unitary operators. They preserve the inner product between state 
vectors, ensuring that the laws of quantum mechanics, particularly the conservation 
of probability, remain unbroken after their application. This unitary nature makes 
them consistent with the overall framework of quantum mechanics and quantum 
computation.
This chapter starts by examining commonly used multi-qubit gates in quantum 
computing and universal gate sets. Building on these foundational concepts, we 
delve into the study of gate sequences, including a rigorous exploration of sequences 
that produce equivalent transformations on qubits. To aid this exploration, we 
introduce a novel tool: the Boolean representation of quantum gates and circuits. 
These topics are fundamental to the field of quantum computing and information 
processing and set the stage for further inquiry.
7.1 Common Multi-Qubit Gates
We will begin with an in-depth exploration of multi-qubit gates commonly used in 
quantum computing. Subsequently, we will delve into related topics such as parallel 
quantum gates and classically controlled gates.
Multi-qubit gates often encountered in quantum computing include the Controlled 
NOT (CNOT), Controlled Z (CZ), SWAP, Toffoli (also known as CCNOT), Fredkin 
(also known as CSWAP) gates, the general Controlled-U (CU) gate, and the two-qubit 
rotation gates. In the CU gate, U represents any single-qubit unitary transformation. 
These gates play essential roles in quantum circuits and quantum algorithms, enabling 
the creation of entangled states and execution of conditional operations based on 
the state of one or more control qubits.
The highlighted terms in the operators in Table 7.1 denote the changes in the 
basis mappings induced by the gates.
The matrix representation of the gates in Table 7.1 is provided in Eq. 7.1.

Exercise 7.2 Investigate why Controlled-H is not a commonly used quantum gate.
7.1.1 CNOT Gate
Let’s use the CNOT gate, which is the most useful multi-qubit gate, to examine how 
its operator and matrix work. For the CNOT gate shown in Table 7.1, qubit 1 is 
the control qubit, and qubit 2 is the target qubit. When the control qubit is |1), an 
X (i.e., NOT) gate is applied to the target qubit, flipping its 0 and 1.
For example, the basis state 110) is transformed to |11). This corresponds to the 
term |11)(10| in the operator of CNOT. For the CnOt matrix (see Eq. 7.2), we 
label the rows with |00), |01), |10), and |11), and the columns with (00|, (011, (10|, 
and (11|. Then |11)(10| corresponds to the 1 at the row |11) and column (10|. This 
is summarized as the third row in the following Table:

The CNOT gate is idemponent, i.e., CNOT2 = 14, where 14 = I ® I is the 4 x 4 
identity matrix. This means applying the CNOT gate twice in succession results in 
no change in the system.
A distinctive feature of quantum gates compared to classical logic gates is that 
quantum gates can work with superposition states. Let’s examine a general two-qubit 
state:
|^} = a |00> + p |01> + y 110> + S 111).
(7.3)
The term |11)(10| in the operator of CNOT picks out y |10) from |^) and 
transforms it to y 111). Similarly, for other terms in the operator. Thus
CNOT |^) = a |00) + P |01) + y 111) + S 110).

(7.5)
The term “control qubit” in the context of the CNOT gate might suggest that 
the state of the control qubit remains invariant. However, this is not always true,

7.1 Common Multi-Qubit Gates
174
especially when the control qubit is in a superposition. Consider the {|+), |—)} 
basis. When applying the CNOT gate to the basis states, we observe:
CNOT |++) = |++),
(7.6a)
CNOT |+— = |—},
(7.6b)
CNOT |-+) = |-+),
(7.6c)
CNOT |—} = |+— .
(7.6d)
It is evident from these results that, in the {|+), |—)} basis, the state of 
the “target qubit” remains unchanged, while the “control qubit” can change 
based on the operation. Therefore, multi-qubit gates should always be regarded as 
operating on the all the qubits as an integrated system, rather than affecting them 
independently.
Exercise 7.3 Verify Eq. 7.6.
7.1.2 Flipped CNOT Gate
Let’s consider the CNOT gate with qubit 2 as control qubit and qubit 1 target qubit. 
We name it CNOT' or CX'. Now when the second qubit is |1), an X (i.e., NOT) 
gate is applied to the first qubit, flipping its 0 and 1.

Exercise 7.4 Demonstrate that, in contrast to the fact that CNOT is not equal 
to CNOT7, the gate CZ is equal to CZ'. Here, CZ' represents the CZ gate with 
qubit 2 serving as the control qubit and qubit 1 as the target qubit. In fact, 
because of this property, the CZ gate is also referred as the ZZ gate.
7.1.3
* General Controlled-U Gate
A Controlled-U (or CU) gate applies a generic unitary gate U to the target qubit 
if the control qubit is |1). The CNOT, CZ, CCNOT, and CSWAP gates listed in 
Table 7.1 are special cases of Controlled-U gates. The target and control can also be 
more than one qubit. For example, the CCNOT gate has two qubits for the control, 
and the CSWAP gate has two qubits for the target.
1
Mathematical Representations
Mathematically, the Controlled-U gate can be represented as:
CU = I0 U0 , 
(7.9)
where U is a generic unitary matrix, and I is the identity matrix.
In the following, for simplicity, we only consider the case where the target and 
control are single qubits, so U and I are 2 x 2 matrices.
The above matrix for CU has a corresponding operator form:
CU= |0>(0|® I + |1><1|® u, 
(7.10)
which, when expanded, yields the operator in Table 7.1.
The fact that the CU gate applies U to the target qubit when the control qubit 
is |1) can be expressed as:
CU |0>|*)  = |0>|*),  
(7.11a)
CU |1>|^= 1 U |*).  
(7.11b)
Exercise 7.5 Demonstrate that the representations of the CU gate are equivalent: 
Eq. 7.9, Eq. 7.10, Eq. 7.11, and the operator form in Table 7.1.
The skills involved in this exercise is foundational for working with quantum 
algorithms. Make sure you can do this exercise independently.

Properties
The Controlled-U gate has a number of important properties:

7.1 Common Multi-Qubit Gates
176
Unitarity
The Controlled-U gate is unitary if U is unitary.
Since Pauli operators are unitary, so are CNOT and CZ.
Proof. The matrix representation of CU is given by Eq. 7.9. The Hermitian 
conjugate of CU, denoted by CUt, is:
CU = I U0 
. 
(7.12)
Since U is unitary, UUt = I. Therefore,
cu •Cut=[0 U][I Ut] = [0 0]=I- 
(7.13)
which proves that CU is unitary if U is unitary. 
□
Not a Parallel Gate
The CU gate cannot be decomposed as a tensor product W 0 U where U and W 
are non-identity unitary matrices.
This property implies that the application of a Controlled-U gate involves 
interaction between qubits.
A gate with an operator of the form W 0 U is a parallel gate, which will be 
discussed in § 7.1.6.
Proof.
The matrix representation of CU is given by Eq. 7.9. Now, assume for the sake 
of contradiction that we could write CU as a product operator, W 0 U. Then, this 
would imply that
W0U=
w00U
w10U
w01U
w11U
(7.14)
for some matrix W. Comparing this with the matrix of CU in Eq. 7.9, we have the 
following system of equations:
w00U = I, 
(7.15a)
w01U = 0, 
(7.15b)
w10U = 0, 
(7.15c)
w11U = U. 
(7.15d)
For w01 U to be the zero matrix, w01 must be zero since U is a unitary matrix.
Similarly, w10 must be zero. This leads us to
W0U= w00U 0
0 w11 U
(7.16)
Comparing this with the matrix of CU, we can see that this form can represent 
the CU gate only if w00 = 1, w11 = 1, and U = I.
Therefore, we conclude that the CU gate is not a simple product operator like 
W 0 U.

3 Controlled-U with Phase
For a standalone U gate, its global phase does not have any physical effect; that is, 
U and ei^ U are equivalent as quantum gates. However, for a controlled-U gate, the 
global phase of U does matter, because
1 ei" U = e*  1 U
(7.18)

distinct from their original versions:

7.1.4 Classically Controlled-U Gate
Controlled gates like CNOT, CZ, and CU are quantum controlled gates that operate 
based on the states of control qubits. However, there also exist classically controlled 
gates, which perform actions dictated by classical logic. These gates involve the 
inclusion or exclusion of certain gates in the instruction sequence for the quantum 
computer based on classical control signals.
Classically controlled gates function similarly to their quantum controlled coun­
terparts. However, there is a key difference. In a quantum controlled gate, the 
control qubit can be in a superposition state, whereas a classically controlled gate is 
driven by a classical bit (0 or 1), often determined by the measurement outcome of

7.1.5 * Two-Qubit Rotation Gates
Two-qubit rotation gates are essential components in quantum algorithms, facilitating 
complex interactions between qubits. These gates generalize the notion of single­
qubit rotations and find applications in quantum algorithms like VQE and VAOA, 
which will be discussed in § 11.2. They can be represented as follows:
Rpq(O) = e-i2P®Q, P,Q e {X, Y, Z}. 
(7.21)
Recall that for any normal matrix A with A2 = I, it holds that eieA = cos OI + 
i sin OA. In the present case, (P 0 Q)2 = I 0 I, where I 0 I is the 4 x 4 identity 
matrix. Thus, we can infer:
Rpq (O) = cos 2(I 0 I) — i sin 2(P 0 Q) ■
(7.22)
For example, the Rzz (O) gate, also commonly termed the parameterized ZZ gate, 
is defined as:
Rzz(O) = ZZ(O) = cos 2(I 0 I) — i sin 2(Z 0 Z)

7.1.6 * Parallel Gates
A gate with an operator of the form W 0 U is referred to as a parallel gate. When 
acting on unentangled qubits, W and U act in parallel on their respective qubits, 
behaving as two independent gates, as illustrated in Eq. 7.25 and Fig. 7.2. In 

Chapter 7. Multi-Qubit Quantum Gates
179
this case, if W or U equals the identity operator I , the parallel gate reduces to a 
single-qubit gate.
(W ® U)(|^} ® |$)) = (W |^)) ® (U |$)). 
(7.25)
Equation 7.25 is applicable for product states, where |^) and |$) are unentangled.

| * W ® Ul_ U | *}
| ^ H wH w | ^ > 
| 0 M^U | t>
^
Figure 7.2 
: Parallel Gate on Unentangled State
Parallel gates are considered “trivial” multi-qubit gates, which is why the common 
multi-qubit gate discussed in § 7.1 has not included any of those. However, there 
is an important non-trivial application of parallel gates: when we want to apply a 
gate to part of an entangled state |^), for example, applying U to the second qubit 
of a Bell state, we are effectively applying the parallel gate I ® U to the combined 
system, even though we may still draw a single qubit gate on the second qubit, as 
illustrated in Fig. 7.3.

We often use a shorthand notation for (I ® U) |^ab): Ub |^ab), where Ub stands 
for U applied to qubit-b. This notation is convenient when we work with basis states, 
for example,
(I ® X)-l2(|00) + |11» = X2-l2(|00) + |11» 
(7.26a)
= -12(|0> X |0) + |1) X |1» 
(7.26b)
= “12(|01> + |10». 
(7.26c)
7.2 Universal Sets of Qubit Gates
In classical computing, complex operations are implemented as sequences of simpler 
operations. A combination of the NAND gate and the FANOUT circuit element 
can construct digital circuits capable of performing all computational tasks, forming 
what is known as a universal set of gates for classical computing. However, the 
NAND and FANOUT gates are not reversible. If we restrict ourselves to reversible 
gates, achieving universality with only one- and two-bit gates becomes impossible. 
Notably, a set consisting solely of the Toffoli gate can serve as a universal gate set 
for classical reversible computation.

7.2 Universal Sets of Qubit Gates
180
Quantum computing employs gates as unitary transformations, which leads to 
an infinite number of possible gates for single, two, and multi-qubit operations on 
a quantum computer. This is in stark contrast to classical computing, which only 
has four functions mapping one bit to another, for example. Despite this apparent 
infinity, there exist universal sets of quantum gates, composed of a few specific gate 
types, that are capable of implementing any quantum computation. As a result, we 
can construct complex quantum circuits using only a limited number of gates from 
these universal sets to execute non-trivial quantum computations. This explains 
why the sets of common quantum gates typically include only a select few types.
In real-world quantum computing, we often focus on approximating desired 
computations to a controllable degree of accuracy. Hence, we define a universal gate 
set as follows:
■
 Definition A universal gate set is a set of quantum gates that can approximate 
any unitary transformation on any number of qubits to an arbitrary degree of 
accuracy.
In simpler terms, a universal gate set allows us to approximate any desired 
quantum operation with a sequence of gates from the set, up to a predetermined 
error bound.
Universality is crucial in quantum computing because it allows us to solve any 
computational problem by using a fixed set of quantum gates, just as we can solve 
any computational problem in classical computing using a fixed set of classical gates.
So, what are the requirements for a universal set of quantum gates? At a 
minimum, they must allow us to reach any point on the Bloch sphere (including 
those with complex amplitudes), and they must be able to create both superposition 
states and entanglement states.
Below are a few examples of universal gate sets. Importantly, the choice of 
gate set depends on sp ecific factors such as the quantum computing architecture, 
physical implementation, and system error rates. Although a universal gate set 
can approximate any quantum computation, it might not always provide the most 
efficient solution for certain tasks. Each gate set presents its own set of advantages 
and challenges. As such, research is ongoing to identify the optimal gate sets for 
various quantum computing platforms and applications.
7.2.1 CNOT + Arbitrary Single-Qubit Rotations
The combination of the CNOT gate and single-qubit unitary rotation gates accom­
plishes the requirements for a universal set. This gate set is universal because it can 
generate any single-qubit unitary transformation and create entanglement between 
qubits. (For a rigorous proof, see Refs. [18, 7].)
Single-qubit unitary rotations allow us to reach any point on the Bloch sphere, 
corresponding to any state the qubit can be in. Typically, two non-commuting 
rotation gates (representing rotations around different axes of the Bloch sphere) are 
sufficient to generate arbitrary rotations. A common choice involves the rotation 
gates around the x and z axes, denoted as Rx and Rz respectively, as defined in 
§ 5.2.5.

Chapter 7. Multi-Qubit Quantum Gates
181
In addition to the CNOT gate, frequently used gates in this universal set include 
X , Z , and H . While these are essential, other single-qubit gates may also be 
required for specific applications or implementations. The versatility and power of 
this universal set lie in its ability to perform both fundamental quantum operations 
and more complex algorithms across various quantum computing platforms.
7.2.2 Clifford Group + T
The Clifford Group, T gate set is a commonly utilized universal gate set, especially 
important in the context of fault-tolerant quantum computing, where fault-tolerance 
refers to the ability of a system to correct errors that occur during quantum 
computations. The Clifford group here encompasses the Pauli gates (X, Y , Z), the 
Hadamard gate (H), the phase gate (S), and the CNOT gate. These gates can be 
implemented efficiently and with fault-tolerance in many quantum error-correcting 
codes.
The T gate, representing a n/4 rotation around the z-axis of the Bloch sphere, 
is not a part of the Clifford group. It is specifically included in this set to efficiently 
approximate all single-qubit rotations, thus ensuring universality. In comparison 
to the Clifford gates, the T gate is more challenging to implement fault-tolerantly, 
thereby making it a major contributor to the computational cost of a quantum 
algorithm in fault-tolerant settings.
The T gate is harder to implement fault-tolerantly because it requires precise 
control over the qubit state, which can be challenging due to issues such as quantum 
decoherence and gate errors. This distinction has led to the concept of the T -count, 
which measures the number of T gates used in a quantum algorithm, serving as 
an indicator of the algorithm’s computational expense in a fault-tolerant quantum 
computing paradigm. The universality of this gate set, coupled with its fault-tolerant 
characteristics, underpins its widespread usage.
7.2.3 Toffoli + H
The gate set comprised of the Toffoli gate (also known as the CCNOT gate) and 
Hadamard (H) gate forms a universal gate set for quantum computation. The 
Toffoli gate is a three-qubit gate, and is the most elementary quantum gate that is 
capable of executing deterministic universal classical computation. See § 7.5.1 for 
more details.
This gate set can produce any unitary transformation on any number of qubits, 
making it universal for quantum computation. It allows for the effective utilization of 
all inherent quantum mechanical properties such as superposition, entanglement, and 
quantum interference, providing the computational advantage sought in quantum 
computing.
The main practical challenge with this gate set lies in the implementation of 
the Toffoli gate. Because the Toffoli gate is a three-qubit gate, it often requires 
more complex quantum operations and higher error rates compared to single- and 
two-qubit gates. To implement a Toffoli gate, one might need to use a combination of 
simpler gates, which increases the gate count and thereby the possibility of errors.

7.3 Boolean Representation of Quantum Gates

Boolean Representation of Quantum Gates
In this section, we introduce a powerful tool for analyzing quantum gates and 
circuits: the Boolean representation of quantum gates and circuits. At its core, this 
representation offers an efficient method for us to examine a quantum circuit for each 
of the basis states separately. The results for each basis state are then combined 
to form a complete picture of the circuit’s behavior for a general quantum state, 
leveraging the linearity property of quantum transformations. We also refer to this 
approach the logic operation approach.
Properties of XOR Operations
Consider x as a Boolean variable where x e {0, 1}, and let x = 1 — x. When x = 0, 
|x) represents |0), and |x represents |1). When x = 1, |x) represents |1), and |x) 
represents |0).
The XOR operator, denoted as ®, corresponds to a bitwise modulo 2 addition:
x ® y = (x + y) mod 2. 
(7.27)
Because 2x = 2y = 0 mod 2, we also have
x ® y = 
(x — y) mod 2 = 
(y — x) mod 2. 
(7.28)
The XOR operation results in ‘1’ when the number of ‘1’s in the operands is odd;
otherwise, it returns ‘0’. (For example, 1 ® 1 ® 0 ® 1 = 1, and 1 ® 1 ® 1 ® 1 = 0.)
The following lists some key properties of XOR operations:
x ® 0 = x,
(7.29a)
x ® 1 = x,
(7.29b)
x ® 1 = x,
(7.29c)
x ® x = 0,
(7.29d)
x ® x) = 1,
(7.29e)
x ® y = x ® y = x ® y = 1 ® x ® y,
(7.29f)
(-1) x ® y = (-1) x® y = (-1) x+y,
(7.29g)
(-1) x ® y = (-1) x® y = (-1)1+ x+y,
(7.29h)
x ® y = x + y — 2xy.
(7.29i)
Exercise 7.8 Verify the last three relations in Eq. 7.29 for all combinations of 
x = 0, 1 and y = 0, 1.

7.3.2 Boolean Representation of Common Quantum Gates
The Boolean representation of a quantum gate can be thought of as a formula that 
succinctly characterizes the transformation applied by the gate to all possible basis 
states. This is similar to the use of Boolean algebra and truth tables in classical 
computing, with significant differences which we will explain in § 7.3.3.
The Boolean representation of some common quantum gates is given in Table 7.2.

Table 7.2: Boolean Representation of Common Qubit Gates
A note on the notation in Table 7.2. In the case of the CNOT gate, the expression 
|x(x ® y)) should be interpreted as |x) ® |(x ® y)). This might appear unusual 
due to the omission of the tensor product operator for brevity. The juxtaposition 
of x and (x ® y) within the ket notation does not imply multiplication. In this 
context, |x(x ® y)) represents states such as |00), |11), etc., with the first and 
second qubit values being x and x ® y, respectively.
In the Toffoli gate representation, the output of the third qubit is |xy ® z) 
in |xyz) ^ |xy(xy ® z)). Here, the operation xy within the “()” denotes stan­
dard multiplication, not a tensor product. This is because |xy ® z) in this case

represents a single qubit state.
Consider the Z gate as an example. Its Boolean representation is |x) ^ (—1)x |x). 
This formula means that for x = 0, we have |0) ^ |0); and for x = 1, |1) ^ — |1). 
Given the superposition state a |0) + fl 11), we can apply the Z gate by leveraging 
the linearity of quantum transformations, which allows us to handle each term 
separately. Therefore, we obtain a |0) + fl |1) ^ a |0) — fl 11), accurately reflecting 
the transformation function of the Z gate.
Exercise 7.11 Demonstrate that the Boolean representation of gate CZ is equal to 
that of CZ\ Here, CZ' represents the CZ gate with qubit 2 serving as the control.
Exercise 7.12 Formulate the Boolean representation of the parallel gate I ® X 
and compare with the CNOT gate.
Exercise 7.13 Formulate the Boolean representation of the parallel gate I ® Z 
and compare with the CZ gate.
7.3.3 Understanding Boolean Representation
While Boolean representation is a powerful technique for analyzing quantum circuits, 
it can sometimes lead to confusion during interpretation. To elucidate some key 
aspects and avoid potential pitfalls, we will examine specific examples next.
1 Forming Superposition
Boolean representation informs us the transformation of each basis state by a 
quantum gate or circuit. The results for each basis state are then combined to form 
a complete picture of the circuit’s behavior for a general quantum state. Note that 
when multiple qubits are involved, the basis states are tensor product states.
■ Example 7.1 Let’s use CNOT as an example to illustrate how the above process 
works. The symbol and formula for CNOT in Table 7.2 capture the transformation 
of CNOT on all combinations of the basis states as follows:
|00> ^ |00> 
|01> ^ |01> 
|10> ^ |11> 
|11> ^ |10>
11 * |0) 0 ♦ |0) |1)^—11> |1>—|—|1> 
|0)^- |0> |1)^- |1> |0)^- |1> |1)^- |0>
Figure 7.4: Expansion of the Boolean Representation of CNOT
Combining these cases in a superposition, we obtain the general transformation 
of the CNOT gate:
a |00> + fl |01> + Y110> + 6 |11> ^ a |00> + fl |01> + Y 111> + 6 110>.

|x) vs. |^)
If a qubit has an output |x), we can treat |x) as the general quantum state |^), 
provided that qubit is disentangled from the rest of the system.
Care should be taken when dealing with multi-qubit systems. If |x) is entangled 
with another qubit, then we cannot directly substitute |x) with the general state 
|^) as |x) must be treated as a part of the multi-qubit basis states. Let’s illustrate 
this caveat with the following example.
■ Example 7.2 A common question for the Boolean representation of CNOT gate is: 
If |x) = |^), doesn’t the following diagram imply that we can duplicate an arbitrary 
state |^), thereby violating the no-cloning theorem?
| x)  | x) ? | 4}  | 4} 
0 —| x > ^ |0) —| ^)
The answer is NO. The replacement of |x) with |^) is invalid here since the two 
qubits are entangled. Thus, we need to instantiate the left part of the diagram 
twice, once with x = 0 and again with x = 1, and then perform a linear combination. 
Therefore, the diagram should be corrected as follows:
| x)  | x) 
0 
0 | x)
^ 
a |0> + ^|1^~}a |00> + ? |11>
■
3 
 Identifying Product States
*
In the context of Boolean representation, where qubits are denoted as |x), |y), etc., 
we need to be cautious in discerning product states. A quantum state, even if it 
seems to present as a product state, may not be a true product state, as shown in 
the following example. The crux lies in understanding that only if a quantum state 
consistently preserves its form as a product state across all combinations of x and y 
values, inclusive of their signs, can it be treated as a genuine product state. In the 
absence of this uniformity across all basis states, the seeming product state is not a 
true one.
■ Example 7.3 This example comes from the discussion of quantum teleportation 
in § 10.3.3. At some stage in the process, the three-qubit system is in the state:
|^1) = ~^(| xx 0) + | xxl)). 
(7.30)
At a first glance, you might think that the first qubit is separated from the system, 
because it seems that |^1) can be written as a product state |x) ® ^12(|x0) + |xi)).
But this conclusion is wrong. Because of the presence of x, the seemingly product 
state does not keep the same form for x = 0 and i.
To interpret Eq. 7.30 correctly, we need to run it twice, once for with | x) = 0 
and the other with |x) = 11), and then do a linear combination of the two resulting 
equations with weights a and ^. Thus, Eq. 7.30 represents

|*1) = -12 (a(|000> + |011» + P(|110> + 1101))),
(7.31)
which cannot be decomposed as the tensor product of a |0) + P |1) with another 
state. 
■
Exercise 7.14 What is the output state from the following circuit when the input 
state is |x} = a |0) + P |1) and |y} = y |0) + 5 |1)?

have done for CU.
7.4 Equivalent Gate Sequences
In this section, we delve into a fundamental aspect of quantum circuits: gate 
sequences, and more importantly, their equivalence. The sequence of gates, much 
akin to the building blocks of a structure, forms the simplest embodiment of a 
quantum circuit. A fascinating attribute of these sequences is their ability to combine 
into a single gate equivalent, paving the path for simplification and optimization 
of quantum circuits. This becomes crucial in practical scenarios when the circuits 
need to be executed on actual quantum hardware where resources are limited and 
hence, optimization is key. Moreover, the understanding of equivalent gate sequences 
forms the bedrock for the analysis of more intricate quantum circuits, for instance, 
quantum gate teleportation. Mastering the techniques and skills required to dissect 
and interpret these sequences is a pivotal part of one’s journey in quantum computing. 
As we proceed, we’ll learn more about these sequences, their inherent properties, 
and the tools needed to comprehend their nuances.

7.4.1 Order Independence in Separate Qubit Operations
The figure below shows a sequence often implied without proof. Two linear operations, 
W and V , pertaining to two qubits a and b, respectively, are order independent. 
Here, W and V can represent either quantum gates or measurements.

---- ----- ^ 
^ 
[==
b—rn 
—pfi— 
—pF—
(W Q I)(I Q V) 
(I Q V)(W Q I) 
W Q V
Mathematically, applying W to qubit a without affecting qubit b is equivalent 
to applying W Q I to the joint state of the two qubits. Similarly, applying V to 
qubit b only is equivalent to I Q V. In this case, W and V commute regardless of 
their commutation properties within their respective systems. This is because the 
operations act on different Hilbert spaces and do not interfere with each other. In 
other words,
(W Q I)(I Q V) = (I Q V)(W Q I), or [W Q I, I Q V] = 0. 
(7.32)
Because of this property, we often express the whole operation as W Q V or 
WaVb.
Proof. Since (w 0 I)(I q v) = WI Q IV = W Q V, 
(7.33a)
(IQ V)(W Q I)= IW Q VI = W Q V, 
(7.33b)
we have
[WQI,IQV] = (WQI)(IQV) - (IQV)(WQI) 
(7.34a)
= W Q V - W Q V 
(7.34b)
= 0.

7.4.2 Gate Sequence: A First Example
Gate equivalence can be analyzed using three approaches: matrix product, operator 
product, and logic operation. Mastering these approaches can greatly aid in opti­
mizing quantum circuits and algorithms. The choice of approach, whether more 
intuitive or effective, hinges on the nature of the gate sequence.
We will illustrate these approaches with a prominent example of gate equivalence, 
depicted in the diagram below. When sequentially applied, the trio of CNOT gates 
(with the central one flipped) effectively emulates the operation of a SWAP gate, 
which interchanges the states of two qubits.

7.4.5 * Deferred Measurement Principle
In this section, we will explore a type of gate sequence equivalence that involves 
measurements. This is enabled by the deferred measurement principle, which allows 
us to measure control qubits early in a quantum computation. As a result, quantum 
controlled gates can often be replaced with their classically controlled analogs. 
Fig. 7.5 provides an example of equivalent circuits that make use of this principle.

The Deferred Measurement Principle.
Measurements can be moved from an intermediate stage of a quantum circuit 
to the end. If the results of these measurements are used at any point in the 
circuit, classically controlled operations can be replaced by quantum controlled 
operations.
Mathematically, the deferred measurement principle signifies that the two circuits 
in Fig. 7.6 are equivalent, indicating that control (for a quantum Controlled-U 
gate) and measurement (whose outcome is utilized in the corresponding classically 
controlled U gate) commute.

Figure 7.6: Deferred Measurement Principle
Proof. * To prove the equivalence of the two circuits in Fig. 7.6, we need to show 
that their output states, i.e., |*1 c) and |*1 q), are identical.
The measurement operator for both circuits is:
where i is the measurement outcome, 0 or 1.
Mi = | i}{i |® I,
(7.48)
The operator for a quantum controlled U gate, CU, is provided in Eq. 7.10; and 
cCU for a classically controlled U gate is in Eq. 7.20.
For the circuit on the left with a quantum controlled U gate:
|*1 q} = CUMi |*o)
= (|0)(0|® I + |1>(1|® U )(| i){i |® I) |*o)

= |(|1><1|® U) |*o
> for i = 1.
(7.49a)

(7.50a)

(7.50c)

Therefore, we conclude that |*1 c) = |*1 q).

7.4.6
* Operator Sum Relations
In quantum circuits, gates are applied sequentially, corresponding to the multi­
plication of the respective matrices, not their addition. This distinction means 
that certain equivalences between gates, while mathematically accurate, cannot be 
translated directly into equivalent sequences of quantum gates.
A notable example of this is that some quantum gates can be expressed in terms 
of Pauli operators:
H = -1=( X + Z),
(7.51a)
CNOT = 1(I ® I +1 ® X + Z ® I - Z ® X),
(7.51b)
CZ = 1(I ® I +1 ® Z + Z ® I - Z ® Z),
(7.51c)
SWAP = 1( I ® I + X ® X + Y ® Y + Z ® Z).
(7.51d)
These relations are not directly translatable into quantum circuits in general 
as they are sums of operators, not compositions. However, They can still provide 
useful insights into the underlying operation of the gates. As an example, let’s find 
an equivalent for the following gate sequence using the above equations:
[fl7-

 Exploratory Topics
*
In this section, we delve into advanced topics that might not be essential for those 
new to quantum computing but can provide additional insights and depth for more 
advanced readers.
7.5.1 * Expressing Common Gates with the Toffoli Gate
In this subsection, we investigate the properties of the Toffoli (CCNOT) gate, as 
shown in Table 7.2. The Boolean representation of the Toffoli gate is given as
Toffoli: |xyz) ^ |xy(xy ® z)). 
(7.55)
The classical logic functions such as NOT, AND, and FANOUT can be ex­
pressed in terms of the Toffoli gate alone as demonstrated in Table 7.5. An OR 
gate can be represented using several stages of Toffoli gates following the relation 
OR(x, y) = NOT(AND(NOT(x), NOT(y))). This demonstrates that we have a 
quantum equivalent for basic classical logic functions. An additional ancillary qubit, 
introduced in the Toffoli gate, makes this translation possible.
By establishing a connection with the universal set of classical logic gates—NOT, 
AND, and FANOUT—we can translate any classical logic circuit into a quantum 
circuit using only the Toffoli gate. This implies that a quantum computer can emulate 
the performance of a classical computer, at minimum, if hardware is available.
However, to utilize the full potential of quantum computing, we need gates that 
facilitate superposition and entanglement. The Toffoli gate can act as a CNOT gate, 
making it suitable for entanglement operations. When coupled with the Hadamard 
(H ) gate, which allows for superposition, we obtain a universal set of quantum gates. 
This powerful combination, discussed in § 7.2.3, signifies that the Toffoli gate and 
Hadamard gate together can be utilized for any quantum computation.

7.5.2 * Advanced Quantum Gate Examples
Suppose we need a quantum gate to perform for the following function:
| x H I- | x x
| y)- G- | y }
|zM_ I- I z ® xy/}
Is this gate realizable as a quantum gate? In order to examine this, let’s work 
out the mappings of the basis states:
|000> H |000>, 
|001> H |001>, 
|010> H |010>, 
|011> H |011>,
|100> H |101>, |101)h|100) , 
|110>h|110> , 
|111>h|111> .
We notice the basis states 1100) and 1101) are changed, while the others remain 
unchanged. This mapping corresponds to the following matrix for the gate:
G=
I4 
0
0
00
U0
0 I2
where 14 is the 4 x 4 identity matrix, 12 is the 2 x 2 identity matrix, and U is a 2 x 2 
matrix defined by:
01
10
(7.56)
We recognize U = X . Apparently G is a unitary matrix. So it is realizable as a 
quantum gate.
What kind of gate is G? The changed basis states, 1100) H 1101) and 1101) H 
1100), imply that the third qubit z is flipped only when the first qubit x = 1 and 
the second qubit y = 1. From this we conclude that G can be named the CCNOT 
gate, with a symbol:
| x) 
| y)
| x } 
| y)
|z) 
eb | z ® xy}
This gate can be regarded as a variation of the original CCNOT (Toffoli) gate in 
Table 7.2.

7.6 Summary and Conclusions
Multi-Qubit Operations
The heart of this chapter revolved around multi-qubit gates, the operational bedrock 
upon which complex quantum circuits are constructed. These gates, acting on 
the tensor product of state spaces of the involved qubits, stand distinct from their 
single-qubit counterparts. One prominent aspect is their ability to generate and 
manipulate entangled states. While these gates possess the power to intricately 
intertwine qubits, they, like single-qubit gates, still represent unitary evolutions, 
ensuring conservation of total probability post-application.
Delving into the specifics, we embarked on a comprehensive study of familiar 
multi-qubit gates such as CNOT, CZ, and CU, highlighting their pivotal roles in 
quantum circuit design and algorithms. The structure and application of these gates 
were emphasized, setting the groundwork for intricate quantum computing tasks.
Universal Quantum Computing Framework
Drawing a parallel to classical computing, where complex operations evolve from 
simpler ones, the chapter transitioned to universal sets of qubit gates. The univer­
sality concept in quantum computing stems from the necessity to approximate any 
quantum operation using a restricted gate set. By introducing the reader to diverse 
universal gate sets and elaborating on their prerequisites, the chapter emphasized 
the importance of adaptability in the quantum realm, especially when harnessing 
limited gate types for non-trivial quantum computations.
Analytical Tools and Techniques
A central tenet of the chapter was the introduction of the Boolean representation 
of quantum gates and circuits. This methodology allows for efficient analysis 
of quantum circuits, considering each basis state independently, then combining 
them for a holistic understanding, thereby harnessing the linearity of quantum 
transformations. This technique not only aids in conceptual clarity but also proves 
instrumental in dissecting complex quantum circuits.
Venturing into gate sequences, we underlined the notion of equivalence in gate 
sequences. Recognizing sequences that combine to form a singular gate equivalent is 
essential for understanding complex quantum circuits, as well as for optimization, 
particularly when addressing real-world quantum hardware constraints.
Advanced Explorations
In this chapter, we also introduced some exploratory topics to provide a deeper 
understanding of quantum gates and their nuances. While these discussions might 
be seen as advanced, they aim to provide a foundational understanding for readers 

Problem Set 7

interested in further exploring the subject of quantum mechanics.
Upcoming Topics
In the forthcoming chapter, we journey into the realm of Bell states. These states, 
defined amidst the backdrop of the intriguing EPR paradox and Bell’s theorem, stand 
as beacons elucidating quantum mechanics’ complexities. As quintessential examples 
of quantum entanglement, Bell states not only accentuate quantum superposition and 
nonlocal correlations but also form the backbone of numerous quantum information 
processing tasks. This sets the stage for an enriching discourse on the EPR paradox 
and the myriad applications of quantum entanglement.
Problem Set 7
7.1 Work out the operator and matrix for a variant of the CNOT gate, denoted 
as CNOT. In this gate, qubit 1 serves as the control qubit and qubit 2 as 
the target qubit. However, in contrast to the regular CNOT gate, an X (i.e., 
NOT) gate is applied to the target qubit, flipping its states 0 and 1, when the 
control qubit is in state |0) rather than |1).
7.2 Intuitively, you should be able to achieve the function of CNOT in
 
by adding an X gate on the control qubit of a regular CNOT to flip the |0) 
and |1), and appending another X gate to restore the flip:
 Problem 7.1
— X ^X- ? 
i—— ^
In terms of operators, this means
CNOT = (X ® I) • CNOT •(X ® I).
Prove or disprove the above equation using the CNOT operator and/or matrix 
you have obtained in Problem 7.1.
7.3 A CU gate applies a generic unitary gate U to the target qubit if the control 
qubit is |1). A CU gate applies U to the target qubit if the control qubit is 
|0). Work out the operator and matrix for CU.
7.4 Derive the operators corresp onding to the quantum gates defined by the 
following block matrices, where U is a 2 x 2 unitary matrix, and I the 2 x 2 
identify matrix. For each gate, discuss its properties similarly to the approach 
used for CU in § 7.1.3. Analyze the patterns within each operator, formulate 
a description analogous to that of CU, and devise a corresponding circuit 
diagram.

Bell states were first defined in the context of the famous “EPR paradox,” a thought 
experiment devised by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in 1935 to argue that quantum 
mechanics was incomplete. It wasn’t until 1964 that John Bell formulated what 
is now known as Bell’s theorem, which showed that the kind of “hidden variables” 
suggested by EPR could not explain the predictions of quantum mechanics, and 
therefore quantum mechanics is a complete theory.

8.1 Maximally Entangled States
202
The Bell states were then used to test Bell’s theorem experimentally, and the 
results of these tests have been overwhelmingly in favor of quantum mechanics. 
These tests, and the Bell states they rely on, are a major reason why physicists today 
accept quantum mechanics as a correct and complete description of the microscopic 
world.
Bell states are a set of four distinct entangled quantum states of two qubits. They 
are the simplest and most widely recognized examples of quantum entanglement — 
a remarkable quantum phenomenon wherein the properties of one qubit become 
intricately connected to the properties of another, irrespective of their spatial 
separation.
Bell states, being maximally entangled, serve to elucidate fundamental aspects 
of quantum mechanics such as quantum superposition and nonlocal correlations. 
Furthermore, Bell states play an indispensable role in a myriad of quantum computing 
and quantum information processing applications, including quantum teleportation, 
quantum cryptography, and quantum error correction.
In this chapter, we delve into a detailed exploration of Bell states, setting the stage 
for our discussion on the EPR paradox and applications of quantum entanglement 
in subsequent chapters. This also allows us to put into practice the concepts and 
techniques we have thus far studied concerning quantum gates.
8.1 Maximally Entangled States
8.1.1 Definitions
The four Bell states are:
4- 
p oo) = -2(|00) + |11»,
I' 
p oi) = -2(|01) + |10»,
|4-)S|Pio) = -2(|00)-|11)), 
|I-)S| p 11) = -!2(|01)-|10)).
(8.1a)
(8.1b)
(8.1c)
(8.1d)
These states are all non-product states, representing different types of correlations 
between the qubits.
In the context of quantum physics, the |I-) state is often referred to as a 
“spin singlet” while the other three states, “spin triplets”. The reason for this 
terminology is that, when we interpret the qubits as spin-1/2 particles, the |I-) 
state corresponds to a pair of particles with a total combined spin of 0. Conversely, 
the other three states represent a combined particle pair with a total spin of 1.
Exercise 8.1 Show that 1 (|00) + |01) + 110) + 111)) is a product state.

Chapter 8. Bell States
203
Exercise 8.2 Show that |$+) = 
(|00) + |11)) is a non-product state.
8.1.2 Maximum Entanglement
Bell states are maximally entangled states of two qubits. Consequently, when we 
perform local measurements on the qubits in a Bell state, the measurement outcomes 
are perfectly correlated (or anti-correlated) due to their entanglement.
The measurement operators acting on the first qubit in the standard basis:
M0 = |0)(0| ® I for measurement outcome |0), 
(8.2a)
M1 = |1)(1| ® I for measurement outcome |1). 
(8.2b)
Let’s take the |$+) Bell state as an example. If we measure the first qubit and 
find it in state |0), we have effectively applied the M0 measurement operator:
M0 M = (|0)(0|® I) ^(R +111».
(8.3)
This results in the post-measurement state |00):
-2 (|00> + |n»
measure 1st qubit to be |0)> |00>.
(8.4)
As a result, we can be certain that the second qubit will also be in the state |0).
Similarly, if we measure the first qubit and find it in the state |1), the second 
qubit will also be in the state |1), because:
-2(|00> + |11»
measure 1st qubit to be |1)»|11>.
(8.5)
This demonstrates perfect correlation between the measurement outcomes of the 
individual qubits in state |$+), measured along the z direction. Similarly, |$-) also 
exhibits perfect correlation, while |^+) and |^-) exhibit perfect anti-correlation. 
Later on (in § 9.8), you will discover that this strong correlation also exists in other 
directions.
8.2 
 Bell Basis
*
In this section, we delve deeper into the mathematical properties of Bell states, 
specifically examining their orthonormality and completeness. The orthonormality 
of Bell states stems from the fact that the inner product of distinct Bell states is 
zero, whereas the inner product of a Bell state with itself is one. Their completeness, 
on the other hand, ensures that any two-qubit state can be represented as a linear 
combination of Bell states. As such, the set of Bell states forms an orthonormal basis 
for the two-qubit Hilbert space, a fundamental concept in quantum information 
theory and quantum computing. In the subsequent subsections, we’ll explore these 
properties and their implications in more detail.

8.2 * Bell Basis 204
8.2.1 * Orthonormality and Completeness
The four Bell states are orthonormal because their inner products are either zero 
(when the states are different) or one (when the states are the same), which is proved 
in § 8.6. In the |Hij) notation, this is expressed as:
(Hij | Hki} = SikSji, 
(8.6)
where Sik and Sjl are Kronecker deltas and i,j,k,l e {0, 1}.
Furthermore, {|Hij)} is a complete basis set, as demonstrated by
£ | Hij}(Hij | = I, 
(8.7)
i,j e{0,1}
where I is the 4 x 4 identity matrix. This means that the Bell states span the entire 
two-qubit Hilbert space. Thus, the Bell states form an orthonormal basis for the 
two-qubit Hilbert space.
i The set of Bell states serves as an orthonormal basis for two-qubit states, much 
like the set |+), |—) forms an orthonormal basis for single-qubit states.
8.2.2 * Two-Qubit States in Bell Basis
Any arbitrary two-qubit quantum state can be expressed as
|^) = a |00> + H |01> + Y 110> + S 111). 
(8.8)
Given that the Bell states form a complete basis for two-qubit states, we can 
also express |^) as a linear combination of these states:
|t> = E cij |Hij), 
(8.9)
where cij are complex coefficients. These coefficients must satisfy the normalization 
condition:
E | cij |2 = 1. 
(8.10)
i,j e{0,1}
We can calculate the coefficients cij using the inner product between the Bell 
states and |^):
cij = (Hij |4}. 
(8.11)
We can combine Eqs. 8.9 and 8.11 as a single equation using projectors |Hij){Hij |:
|^> = E IHijXHij |*}
. 
(8.12)
In terms of the coefficients a, H , Y , and S , the coefficients cij are:

The Bell state generator we’ll discuss in subsequent sections can be understood as 
a circuit that transforms the computational basis into the Bell basis. Conversely, 
the Bell state analyzer can be seen as performing the reverse transformation, from 
the Bell basis back to the computational basis.
Exercise 8.3 Derive the equations for the coefficients a, fi, y, and 3 in terms of 
the amplitudes cij. This will provide the inverse relation of Eq. 8.13.
8.3 Bell State Creation
This section focuses on the practical creation of Bell states, which is a fundamental 
operation in quantum computing and quantum information theory. In an ideal 
quantum computer, Bell states can be readily generated using universal quantum 
gates like the Hadamard (H) and the controlled NOT (CNOT) gates. We will first 
investigate the basic methods of generating Bell states using these quantum gates. 
However, in practice, especially when working with systems like photons, we often re­
sort to physical phenomena such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) 
to create entangled pairs of particles, which form the Bell states. Throughout this 
section, we will explore these methods and the underlying physics, providing a com­
prehensive understanding of Bell state creation in both theoretical and experimental 
scenarios.
8.3.1 Basic Bell State Generator
Bell states can be generated using qubit gates. For example, the Hadamard gate 
and the CNOT gate can be used together to create the Bell state $+ from an initial 
state |00) as follows.
Apply a Hadamard gate (H) to the first qubit. This creates a superposition 
state:
(H ® I) |00> — —=(|00) + |10»■
(8.15)

8.3 Bell State Creation

Apply a CNOT gate to the two-qubit state, with the first qubit as the control 
and the second qubit as the target. This entangles the qubits and generates the Bell 
state:
CNOT -1=(|00) + 110» = -1=(|00) + 111» -
All four Bell states can be created using qubit gates as in Fig. 8.1:

Clarification of Quantum Circuits and Math Formulas
In quantum circuit diagrams, time generally flows from left to right, and operations 
(gates) are applied to qubits as you move along this direction. However, when you 
represent the operations mathematically as matrices, the sequence of operations 
follows the convention of matrix multiplication, which is right-to-left.
This discrepancy can sometimes be confusing for those new to quantum 
computing. But it’s an important aspect to understand for accurate interpretation 
of quantum circuits and corresponding mathematical expressions.

Adding X gates for the input state preparation, we can create all four Bell states

Alternatively, we can use the Z gate to generate a n phase shift (i.e., negative 
sign) in the output to create |$-) and |^-) as shown in Fig. 8.3. Remember that 
applying a Z gate to a qubit changes its |1) to — |1). (Applying the Z gate to either 
the first or the second qubit yields the same Bell states, as the difference is only in 
global phase which is not measurable in a quantum system.)

Photon Pair Creation with SPDC
Direct application of Hadamard and CNOT gates to photons is not readily fea­
sible. Instead, entangled photons are generated through spontaneous parametric 
down-conversion (SPDC) or other nonlinear optical processes. SPDC is a widely 
used method for producing pairs of entangled photons for a variety of quantum 
communication and computation experiments.
In SPDC, as illustrated in Fig. 8.4 a single high-energy photon passes through 
a nonlinear crystal and occasionally splits into two lower-energy photons that are 
entangled. The entangled photons can be created in various Bell states, depending 
on the experimental setup and the properties of the nonlinear crystal.
Figure 8.4: Photon Pair Creation with SPDC
For polarization-entangled photon pairs created by SPDC, the Bell state is
|*-> = -12 (M1 ®|t>2 — |t>1 ®|^>2) ,
(8.17)
where |-h}1, |$)1, |^}2 and |$)2 represent the horizontal and vertical polarizations 
of the two photons in the pair.
If we interpret |^} as |0) and |$) as |1), then Eq. 8.17 yields the same |^-) as 
in the standard notation presented in Eq. 8.1.

succinctly expressed in a single equation:

8.4 Bell Measurement
This section delves into Bell measurements, which hold a pivotal position in quantum 
information processing due to their ability to distinguish between different Bell states. 
These measurements operate by projecting a two-qubit state onto the Bell basis, 
effectively resulting in one of the four Bell states. Such a process forms the core of 
numerous quantum protocols like quantum teleportation, superdense coding, and 
quantum key distribution. Moreover, we will take a look at how Bell measurements 
can be practically implemented using a quantum circuit known as a “Bell analyzer.”
8.4.1 Joint Measurement
The orthonormality of the Bell states (discussed in § 8.2) allows us to distinguish 
between different Bell states through measurements. If a quantum state is prepared 
in one of the Bell states, it can be unambiguously determined through a joint 
measurement on both qubits, known as a Bell measurement or a Bell state analysis.
A Bell measurement differs from the local measurements discussed in § 8.1.2 
in that it is a type of joint quantum measurement (see § 6.2.2) performed on a 
two-qubit system. This implies the necessity of having both qubits at the same 
location or some form of quantum communication between the two qubits, which 
characterizes the non-local nature of Bell measurements.
If we perform a Bell measurement on a general two-qubit state | ^) given by
|^) = a |00> + fi |01> + Y 110> + 6 111) 
(8.19a)
= E cij |Pij), 
(8.19b)
i,j e{0,1}
we will obtain one of the Bell states |ffij) with probability |cij |2, where i,j e {0, 1}. 
The quantum state will then collapse into that Bell state. The coefficients cij are 
given by Eq. 8.13 in terms of a, ^, y, and 6.
Effectively, a Bell measurement can be thought of as projecting the two-qubit 
state |^) onto one of the four Bell states and performing the measurement in the 
Bell basis. The measurement operator for outcome |ffij) is the projection operator:

Chapter 8. Bell States
209
Mij = | Pij X Pij | •
(8.20)
The set of all measurement operators {Mij | i,j e {0, 1}} forms a complete 
measurement set. That is, the sum of all measurement operators is the identity 
operator on the two-qubit Hilbert space (see Eq. 8.7). Compare these operators to 
the single-qubit local operators (e.g., |0)(0| ® I) used in § 8.1.2.
After a Bell measurement, all subsequent measurements on the unaltered system 
will yield the same outcome, as the state has been collapsed into the corresponding 
Bell state.
8.4.2 Basic Implementation: Bell Analyzer
A Bell measurement can be implemented by the circuit in Fig. 8.6. The Bell 
measurement circuit (or Bell analyzer) is the inverse of the Bell state generation 
circuit shown in Fig. 8.1. After the CNOT and Hadamard gates, we measure the two 
qubits in the computational basis. The first qubit gives us i and second j . Together 
we obtain one of four labels 00, 01, 10, or 11 indicating the measurement outcome 
| Pij }■
Figure 8.6: Bell Measurement
| ^) {
Bell

j
It’s worth noting that the Bell analyzer can be utilized with any two-qubit state, 
not just Bell states. In the case of an arbitrary two-qubit state, the measurement 
results could be any combination of i and j , with each outcome occurring with a 
probability of |cij |2 . Here, i and j correspond to the indices of the Bell state to 
which the system collapses.
8.4.3 Post-Measurement State
In Fig. 8.6, we presume that our primary concern is the classical measurement 
results, i.e., the two-bit outcomes 00, 01, 10, or 11, and the resultant quantum state 
is disregarded. Nevertheless, there might be circumstances in which we want to 
use the Bell state |flj) that the system collapses into after the measurement in 
subsequent portions of the quantum circuit. In such cases, we would need to recreate 
that state, as illustrated in Fig. 8.7.
Note with this full implementation, the Bell measurement not only provides 
insight into the state of the system but also engenders a state change. If the qubits 
were initially not entangled, the measurement procedure will bring about their 
entanglement.
8.5 Bell State Conversion
Bell states can be converted from one to another using Pauli gates. In fact, this 
conversion can be achieved by applying a Pauli gate to one of the qubits locally. 
The ability to convert between Bell states forms an important aspect of quantum

in this field. This section sheds light on such conversions. It details converting |p00) 
to other Bell states and vice versa.
8.5.1 Converting |p00) to Other Bell States
Let’s take |p00) = |$+) as our reference state. Fig. 8.8 shows several ways to convert 
|p00) to other Bell states.

Figure 8.8 : Converting |p00) = |$+) to Other Bell States
The expression | p 11) = (Z ® X) | p00) is sometimes written in shorthand form 
as |p 11) = Z 1 X2 |p00), where Z 1 refers to Z applied to the first qubit, and X2 
meaning X applied to the second qubit. This convention also applies to other 
similar expressions.
Exercise 8.7 Demonstrate |p 11) = (ZX ® I) |p00) which underlines the last 
conversion circuit in Fig. 8.8.
8.5.2 Converting Other Bell States to |^q0)
Similarly, Fig. 8.9 shows several ways to convert other Bell states to |p00). These 
are the inverse operations of the transformations in Fig. 8.8. You notice the forward 
conversion and reverse conversion are the same for the first five cases. This is because 
X 2 = I and Z2 = I . In the last case, the order of X and Z is different between 
forward and reverse conversion, because XZZX = I.

(8.21d)
Now, let’s prove Eq. 8.6, the orthonormality of the Bell states.
For normalization, let’s calculate the inner product of each Bell state with itself: 
(P001P 00) = 1(<00|00> + <00|11> + <11100> + <11111>) = 1(1 + 0 + 0 + 1) = 1,
(P01IP01) = 1«00|00> - <00|11> - (11|00) + <11111» = 1(1 - 0 - 0 + 1) = 1,
(P101P10) = 1((01|01) + <01| 10) + <10|01> + <10|10» = 1(1 + 0 + 0 +1) = 1,
(P111P11) = 1«01101) - <01|10> - <10|01> + <10|10» = 1(1 - 0 - 0 + 1) = 1.
For orthogonality, let’s calculate the inner product of distinct Bell states:
(P011P 00) = |«01100) + (01|11) + <10|00) + <10|11>) = 1(0 + 0 + 0 + 0) = 0,
(P011P10) = 1((01|00) - <01|11> + <10|00> - <10|11» =1(0 - 0 + 0 - 0) = 0,
(P011P11) = 1((01|01) - <01|10> + <10|01> - <10|10» =1(1 - 0 + 0 - 1) = 0,
(P101P00) = 1«00|00> + <00|11) - (11|00) - <11111» = |(1 + 0 - 0 - 1) = 0,
(P101P11) = 1«00|01> - (00|10) + (11|01) - <11110» =1(0 - 0 + 0 - 0) = 0,
(P001P11) = 1«00|01> - (00|10) + (11|01) - <11110» = 1(0 - 0 + 0 - 0) = 0.
All the inner products of distinct Bell states are equal to 0, which indicates that 
the Bell states are orthogonal to each other.
| Exercise 8.9 Prove the completeness of Bell basis, i.e., Eq. 8.7.
8.7 * Generalization: GHZ States
Bell states, or EPR pairs, involve two entangled qubits. Generalizing Bell states to 
more than two qubits can lead to more complex types of entanglement. There are 
numerous ways to entangle more than two qubits, and these lead to different classes 
of multi-qubit entangled states.
GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states are a class of multi-qubit states that 
demonstrate stronger forms of quantum entanglement than can be seen with two 
qubits. The simplest GHZ state involves three qubits and is given by the superposition 

Chapter 8. Bell States
213
12 (|000) + |111)), where each term in the superposition involves all qubits being in 
the same state.
When we increase the number of qubits, we encounter more types of multipartite 
entangled states, such as the W states, e.g., 113(|001) + |010) + |100)). It’s worth 
noting that these different classes of entangled states cannot always be converted 
into each other without some probability of failure, which suggests they demonstrate 
fundamentally different types of quantum correlation.
* Further Exploration
The concept of GHZ states, as well as their applications in quantum information 
theory and quantum computation, extends beyond the basic explanation given in 
this text. For those seeking to deepen their understanding, the following topics are 
suggested for further exploration:
1. Going Beyond Bell’s Theorem [48]: In this seminal paper, Greenberger, Horne, 
and Zeilinger introduce the concept of GHZ states, which exemplify a more 
profound form of quantum entanglement than Bell states.
2. Quantum Computation and Quantum Information [7]: This comprehensive 
textbook by Nielsen and Chuang covers the entire field of quantum information, 
including the detailed theory of multi-qubit entangled states such as GHZ and 
W states.
3. Observation of Three-Photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger Entanglement [27]: 
In this experimental paper, Bouwmeester et al. demonstrate the creation of a 
three-qubit GHZ state, putting the theoretical predictions into practice.
8.8 Summary and Conclusions
Bell States and Quantum Entanglement
Throughout this chapter, we have ventured into the realm of Bell states and their 
profound implications. By studying Bell states, we were able to demystify complex 
quantum phenomena like quantum entanglement and to understand them in a precise 
mathematical framework. We emphasized the indispensable nature of Bell states in 
the realm of quantum computation and information processing.
Theoretical Foundations and Practical Implementations
We subsequently dissected the properties of Bell states, establishing their role as the 
quintessential representation of two-qubit entanglement. The concepts of orthonor­
mality and completeness of Bell states were meticulously explored, highlighting their 
significance in quantum computing and information.

theoretical constructs, employing quantum gates, and real-world scenarios utilizing 
physical phenomena like spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).

adaptability of these entangled states in quantum operations.
Generalizations and Future Directions
In closing the chapter, we introduced the reader to the more general entangled states 
such as the GHZ states. These states serve as a natural extension of the Bell states, 
embracing more than two qubits. Such generalizations enrich our understanding of 
multi-qubit entanglement and open doors for further research and applications.
Upcoming Topics
In the succeeding chapter, we will venture deeper into the enigmatic domain of 
quantum entanglement, specifically focusing on Bell inequalities. These inequalities 
will be our tool to probe the disparity between quantum mechanics and the prin­
ciples of local realism. By delving into experimental tests that validate quantum 
entanglement and the consequent negation of local hidden variables, we shall further 
unravel the mysteries of the quantum realm. Additionally, we will explore the 
pragmatic applications of quantum entanglement, particularly in the domains of 
secure communication and cryptographic protocols.

Similarly, there is such a unitary operator local to Bob. Thus, all Bell 
states are equivalent in this sense.

equivalent of the binary states.
The other Bell states can be generated using the transformation:

(i,j,k,l € {0, 1}),
with Uijkl defined as the application of specific Pauli and identity operators 
on the base Bell state. The operators are:

9.1 Classical Correlation vs. Quantum Entanglement
218
In this chapter, we are going to embark on an exploration of the captivating 
world of quantum entanglement and Bell inequalities. Quantum entanglement is a 
phenomenon that challenges our conventional wisdom, especially the notion of local 
realism, which postulates that physical systems have predetermined properties and 
cannot interact faster than light.
One of the most famous examples that highlight the puzzling nature of quantum 
entanglement is the century-old Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. This 
thought experiment raised questions about how complete and accurate quantum 
mechanics is, and sparked many discussions among scientists.
In recent years, scientists have tested quantum entanglement using Bell inequali­
ties. These inequalities are tools used to distinguish between predictions made by 
quantum mechanics and the principles of local realism. Experiments that have con­
firmed quantum entanglement have greatly expanded our knowledge of the quantum 
world.
Beyond being a mere intellectual puzzle, quantum entanglement boasts tangible 
applications, becoming integral to emerging technologies. The E91 protocol, for 
instance, harnesses entanglement for secure communication through cryptographic 
keys and employs Bell inequalities to detect eavesdropping.
This chapter will thoroughly examine the historical background, theories, and 
experimental achievements of quantum entanglement and Bell inequalities. In the 
next chapter, we will study their real-world applications.
9.1 Classical Correlation vs. Quantum Entanglement
Quantum entanglement is a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics where 
particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be 
described independently of the state of the other, even when they are separated 
by large distances. The physics underlying quantum entanglement is distinct from 
classical correlation.
To illustrate this distinction, consider a machine that emits pairs of balls in 
opposite directions, as depicted in Fig. 9.1. Envisage two individuals, Alice and Bob, 
each catching one of these balls. The balls are arranged such that when Bob catches 
a black ball, he knows that Alice must have caught a white one, and vice versa. 
This correlation can manifest in both classical and quantum realms but arises for 
different reasons.
9.1.1 Classical Correlations
In the classical domain, correlations can occur in various scenarios:
• Balls with contrasting colors: The machine dispenses pairs of balls with 
contrasting colors that are predetermined. In this scenario, Alice and Bob 
always catch balls of opposite colors because they were already arranged that 
way. This is similar to the predetermined coin-pair scenario: If a pair of coins 
is tossed such that when one shows heads, the other must show tails.

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities
219
Figure 9.1: Classical Correlation versus Quantum Entanglement
Gray balls with shared ink: Initially, the balls contain an equal mixture of black 
and white pigments, hence appearing gray. Upon observation, the pigments 
separate, flowing to one of the balls, with the direction of the flow being 
random. As a result, one ball randomly turns black, and the other turns white. 
In this scenario, the colors are not predetermined, and a transfer of pigment 
between the balls is necessary for them to assume their respective colors.
Communicating intelligent balls: Consider two balls capable of sensing their 
surroundings and communicating wirelessly. They can coordinate to display 
different colors based on the environment (e.g., who catches them and how 
they are caught).
The examples above illustrate anti-correlation. Correlation can also be direct. For 
instance, with fair coins, if Alice’s coin shows heads, so does Bob’s, and the same 
applies for tails.
9.1.2 Quantum Entanglement
Transitioning to the quantum realm, let’s consider the two balls as particles, or 
qubits. The scenario in Fig. 9.1 can occur if the qubits are in a Bell state, represented 
as |^-) = ^12(|01) — |10)). Here, we associate the white color with state |0) and 
black with state |1).
When Alice measures her qubit, she employs the projection operator
M0a = |0>(0|® I,
(9.1)
which collapses the Bell state to M0a |^ ) = |01). (The normalization factor is not 
relevant here and is therefore omitted.) Subsequently, Bob’s qubit is in state |1).

9.1 Classical Correlation vs. Quantum Entanglement
220
Likewise, if Bob measures his qubit first and observes |0), he uses the projection 
operator
M0b = I ®|0><0|, 
(9.2)
which collapses the Bell state to M0b |^-) = |10). At this point, Alice’s qubit is in 
state |1).
This demonstrates that the measurement outcomes of Alice and Bob are anti­
correlated. However, a key difference from classical correlation lies in the quantum 
measurement principle. The states of the individual qubits in the entangled pair are 
not defined until they are measured. This is shown in Fig. 9.1, where the balls are 
gray before being caught, symbolizing their undefined states. When Alice measures 
her qubit, she obtains either |0) or |1) with equal probability, but whichever she gets, 
Bob will always observe the opposite. This resembles the “grey balls with shared 
ink” classical scenario, except that no communication or transfer of matter is needed 
between the qubits.
Similar logic applies to other Bell states. For |$+) and |$-), the measurement 
outcomes are correlated; for |^+) and |^-), they are anti-correlated.
The above discussion on entanglement is quite abstract. You might be wondering, 
how are these “gray balls” created in the phyisical world? In quantum computing, 
entanglement between qubits is achieved through a variety of physical implementa­
tions, each exhibiting the behavior described earlier. The following examples should 
help provide a more tangible understanding.
• Photon Pairs Generated With SPDC: Spontaneous parametric down-conversion 
(SPDC) is a process where a single photon decays into two entangled photons 
with lower energy. These entangled photon pairs show quantum correlations 
and can be sent to distant locations.
• Entangled Atomic States: Quantum entanglement can also include other 
particles, such as atoms. Entangled atomic states can be produced by changing 
the internal energy levels of atoms using techniques like stimulated Raman 
adiabatic passage (STIRAP).
• Superconducting Qubits: In quantum computing, superconducting qubits 
can be entangled through interactions controlled by microwave resonators or 
other coupling methods. This enables the creation of quantum logic gates and 
algorithms.
• Trapped Ions: Trapped ion systems create entangled states by controlling the 
motion and internal energy levels of ions held in electromagnetic traps. These 
systems are used for quantum computing and simulation.
• NV Centers: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are defect structures 
that can hold electron spins for a long time. These spins can be entangled 
using methods such as resonant microwave driving and optical control.
• Quantum Dots: Quantum dots are tiny semiconductor structures that can hold 
and control individual electrons or excitons. Entangled states can be created 
in quantum dots through methods like parametric fluorescence or electron spin 
interactions.

9.2 The EPR Paradox
Quantum mechanics posits that particles were not predetermined to be in a certain 
state but were actually in a superposition of multiple states until observed. For 
instance, in the context of the example given earlier, before observation, each particle 
could be thought of as being both black and white at the same time (analogous to 
being gray). The moment they are observed, they randomly collapse into one of the 
states, instantaneously determining the state of the other particle, no matter how 
far apart they are.
This seems to contradict our classical intuitions about cause and effect and the 
nature of reality. How can one particle be influenced by an observation made on 
another particle at a distance without any signal passing between them? According 
to relativity, a signal cannot travel faster than light, but quantum mechanics doesn’t 
seem to require a signal for this entangled behavior. Moreover, how can it be that 
the outcomes of our observations are random and probabilistic?
Albert Einstein, along with his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, 
found this counterintuitive. In 1935, they argued that quantum mechanics does not 
provide a complete description of reality. This argument came to be known as the 
EPR paradox, named after the initials of the three scientists.
I cannot seriously believe in quantum theory 
because the theory cannot be reconciled with 
the idea that physics should represent a reality 
in time and space, free from spooky actions at a 
distance.
Do you really believe that the moon isn’t there when 
nobody looks?
Quantum mechanics is very worthy of regard. But 
an inner voice tells me that this is not yet the right 
track. The theory yields much, but it hardly brings 
us closer to the Old One’s secrets. I, in any case, am 
convinced that He does not play dice.”

Interpretations and Philosophical Implications of Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics is both an experimentally verified and mathematically 
rigorous theory, yet it opens avenues for philosophical debates. It questions our 
understanding of reality, the role of observers, and concepts like determinism and 
causality. Prominent physicists like Niels Bohr and Richard Feynman have noted 
the inherent challenges in fully comprehending the theory. There are currently 
several interpretations of quantum mechanics leading to different philosophical 
implications.
Copenhagen Interpretation: The Copenhagen interpretation, which we have 
implicitly followed so far, postulates that after a quantum measurement, the state 

9.2 The EPR Paradox
222
vector collapses to the measured eigenstate. In this view, quantum mechanics is 
fundamentally a theory of probability amplitudes, allowing for phenomena like 
superposition and entanglement.
Realist Interpretation: Contrastingly, the realist interpretation suggests that 
quantum mechanics is deterministic, and any uncertainties arise due to hidden 
variables. Albert Einstein was a strong advocate of this view, encapsulated in his 
phrase “God does not play dice.” However, modern experiments, including those 
recognized by the 2022 Nobel Prize, have largely ruled out this interpretation.
Other Interpretations: Various other interpretations exist, including many­
worlds, information-based interpretations, and decoherence-based views. Each 
offers a unique perspective on the underlying principles of quantum mechanics.
9.2.1 Hidden Variable Theory, Realism, and Locality
EPR proposed an alternative to standard quantum mechanics that employs hidden 
variables. They assumed that particles always contained information, which might 
be hidden, about their states and that this information determined their states even 
before being observed. Essentially, this information caused the correlation between 
particles.
In this context, “hidden variables” refer to unobservable factors hypothesized to 
exist to account for the behavior of quantum systems in a deterministic way. The 
concept of hidden variables is associated with local realism, which encompasses two 
philosophical ideas: realism and locality.
Realism: This is the belief that objects possess definite properties and values even 
when they are not being observed or measured. In the context of hidden variables, 
realism implies that the properties of a quantum system (such as position, spin, or 
polarization) have well-defined values at all times, even when not being measured. 
These values are thought to be determined by hidden variables.
Locality: This refers to the idea that physical processes occurring at one location 
do not depend on the properties of objects at other locations that are spacelike 
separated (i.e., separated by a distance greater than the speed of light multiplied by 
the time it takes for information to travel between them). In the context of hidden 
variables, locality means that the outcomes of measurements on spatially separated 
particles are independent of each other and are determined solely by the local hidden 
variables associated with each particle.
In § 9.1.1, two examples - balls with contrasting colors and predetermined coin 
pairs - adhere to the principle of local realism. However, the other two examples 
- gray balls with shared ink and communicating intelligent balls - violate this 
principle.
However, the notion of local hidden variables faced challenges from Bell’s in­
equalities. Proposed by physicist John Bell in 1964, Bell’s inequalities are a set of 
mathematical inequalities that, if violated by experimental data, indicate that the 
underlying theory cannot be explained by local hidden variables. The violation of 
Bell’s inequalities by experimental data suggests that entangled quantum systems 
exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics.

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities
223
Subsequent experiments consistently demonstrated violations of Bell’s inequalities, 
suggesting that the behavior of entangled particles does not align with the concept 
of local hidden variables. This, in turn, provides strong support for the predictions 
of quantum mechanics and has profound implications for our understanding of the 
fundamental nature of reality.
Key Takeaways
Classical correlations and quantum entanglement both involve connections be­
tween separate systems, but the nature of these connections is fundamentally 
different. Classical correlations under the assumption of local realism can be 
explained by predetermined states, whereas quantum entanglement involves an 
inherent, non-classical correlation that exists even without prior conditions or 
communication.
In the next section, we will explore in more detail how Bell’s inequalities have 
shaped the modern understanding of quantum mechanics and its intriguing proper­
ties.
9.3 Bell Inequalities
Bell inequalities provide a mathematical framework that 
allows experiments to differentiate between the predic­
tions of local hidden variable theories and those of quan­
tum mechanics in the context of the EPR paradox. There 
are several forms of Bell inequalities, each applicable to 
various scenarios and types of observables. The origi­
nal Bell inequality was defined for dichotomic observ­
ables (i.e., observables with two possible outcomes). The 
Bell-CHSH inequality is a specific case derived by John 
Clauser, Michael Horne, Abner Shimony, and Richard 
Holt in 1969, which is an extension of the original Bell in­
equality and is designed for scenarios with two entangled 
particles and dichotomic observables.

In this text, we will focus on the Bell-CHSH inequality, as it is one of the most 
widely studied and experimentally tested forms of Bell inequalities. It serves as a 
cornerstone in our understanding of the fundamental differences between classical 
and quantum correlations, and it provides a clear demonstration of the nonlocal and 
counter-intuitive nature of quantum entanglement.
9.3.1 Bell-CHSH Inequality
First time readers and undergraduate students may skip the following derivation 
until Eq. 9.7.
1 Simplified Form
The Bell-CHSH inequality is derived based on the assumptions of local realism, using 
classical probability theory. The derivation starts by defining measurement settings 

9.3 Bell Inequalities
224
for a pair of objects (colored balls, or particles in the hidden variable theory), A 
sent to Alice and B sent to Bob.
Each object can be measured along two different measurement settings or bases, 
such as polarization directions, represented by a and a' for Alice, and b and b' for 
Bob. Assume that Alice randomly chooses between a and a', and Bob randomly 
chooses between b and b', to measure each pair of objects.
Let’s define A(a) and B(b) as the outcomes of the measurements for Alice and 
Bob, respectively, with respect to the settings specified by a and b. Similarly, A(a') 
and B (b') for a' and b'.
We assume the outcomes of these measurements are either +1 or -1, that is:
A(a),A(a'),B(b),B(b') e {-1, 1}. 
(9.3)
Now, let’s consider the following quantities:
A(a) [B(b) - B(b')], 
A(a') [B(b)+ B(b')].
Since the outcomes of the measurements are either +1 or -1, depending on if 
B(b) and B(b') have the same sign or opposite signs, one of the above quantities is 
0 while the other is bounded to [-2, 2].
Thus, the sum of the above quantities is also b ounded to [-2, 2]:
-2 < A(a) [B(b) - B(b')] + A(a') [B(b) + B(b')] < 2. 
(9.4)
2 Statistically Verifiable Version
However, Inequality 9.4 is not directly verifiable. This is because for each pair of 
objects, Alice randomly chooses between a and a' to measure, and Bob between b 
and b'. There are four combinations, and they need to measure at least four pairs to 
test the inequality thoroughly. To address this, we can derive a statistically verifiable 
version as follows.
Let’s introduce A, the “hidden variables,” which encompass all factors, such 
as initial conditions and environmental influences, that determine the states and 
properties of the objects. These factors may be inherently random. In classical 
probability theory, this is represented as a probability distribution function P (A). It 
is also assumed that the choice of measurement setting (such as a or a' for Alice) 
is independent of the hidden variables and does not influence the properties of the 
objects being measured, thus there is a single P (A) function.
Now A(a), A(a'), B(b), and B(b') all depend on A, and we denote them as 
A (a, A), A (a' ,A), B (b,A), and B (b' ,A).
The expected value of the product of two measurement outcomes, which describes 
the correlation of measurements under two settings, is given by:
E (a,b) = 
P (A) A (a, A) B (b,A). 
(9.5)
These expected values can be obtained through repeated measurements on many 
identically prepared pairs of particles and averaging the outcomes.

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities
225
Now, we sum inequality (9.4) over the hidden variable A with its probability 
distribution P (A):
-2 < 
P(A) [A(a, A) [B(b, A) - B(b', A)] + A(a', A) [B(b, A) + B(b', A)]] < 2.
A 
(9.6)
Using the definition of the expected value, we can rewrite the inequality as:
-2 < S < 2, or, |S| < 2, 
(9.7)
which is the Bell-CHSH inequality, where
S = E(a, b) - E(a, b') + E(a', b) + E(a', b') 
(9.8)
is referred to as the Bell-CHSH quantity.
Points to Note
Quantum mechanics is not involved in the derivation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. 
It is purely based on classical probability theory and the hidden variable (i.e., local 
realism) assumption. As such, the inequality sets constraints on the correlations 
between measurements of two particles under any local hidden variable theory. 
If the inequality is violated, it suggests that the system in question does not 
adhere to local realism but instead exhibits the nonlocal correlations that are 
characteristic of quantum entanglement.
9.4
9.4.1
Bell-CHSH Inequality with Classical Correlation
Balls with Contrasting Colors
To build intuition, let’s start with a classical analogy using “balls with contrasting 
colors.” We will consider pairs of balls where each ball is either black or white. We 
define +1 for white, and -1 for black.
Imagine that Alice and Bob each receive one ball from a pair, and they have 
some method to measure or analyze the colors of the balls. We denote Alice’s 
measurement settings as a and a', and Bob’s settings as b and b'.
Assume that Alice and Bob randomly choose between their respective settings 
to measure each pair of balls.
Here, the hidden variable A represents the set of inherent properties of the balls 
which determine their color. For instance, it could be some internal parameters set 
before Alice and Bob receive them.
We assume perfect anti-correlation, meaning if one ball in the pair is white, the 
other is guaranteed to be black. Mathematically:
P(A) = 01,,
if A ^ one ball white and the other black, 
otherwise.
(9.9)
The correlation functions in the Bell-CHSH quantity all equal -1, because only 
the terms involving AB = -1 are non-zero in the following calculation:

9.4 Bell-CHSH Inequality with Classical Correlation
226
A
E(a, b) = 
P (A)A(a, A)B(b, A) = -1,
(9.10a)
E(a', b') = 
P(A) A(a', A)B(b', A) = -1,
(9.10b)
E(a, b') = 
P(A) A(a, A)B(b', A) = -1,
(9.10c)
E (a', b) = 
P (A) A (a', A) B (b, A) = -1.
(9.10d)
The Bell-CHSH quantity becomes
S= -1+1-1-1 = -2. 
(9.11)
This value of |S| satisfies the Bell-CHSH inequality, |S| < 2.
Note that in this classical example, the outcome can be explained using local 
realism, where the color correlation is predetermined by some hidden variable (A). 
This is in contrast to the quantum case, which we will discuss next, where the Bell- 
CHSH inequality can be violated, indicating the presence of nonlocal correlations or 
entanglement.
Exercise 9.1 Derive S for the perfectly correlated classical case, where the color 
of Bob’s ball always matches that of Alice’s for the same pair.
9.4.2 Gray Balls with Shared Ink
The Bell-CHSH inequality is not violated as long as the colors of the balls are inde­
pendent of the measurement settings. However, this scenario becomes problematic 
when considering simultaneous measurements. If Alice and Bob make measurements 
at the exact same time while being separated by a distance, the pigments would 
not have enough time to transfer between the balls to determine their colors. This 
means that the outcomes are not available at the time of measurement, rendering 
this scenario unsuitable for testing the Bell-CHSH inequality. It fails to account for 
the type of correlations observed in entangled quantum systems, as it relies on a 
physical transfer of pigment that cannot occur instantaneously over a distance.
9.4.3 Adaptable Intelligent Balls
Consider a scenario where the balls possess robotic-like features, allowing them to 
sense their environment and independently choose which color to display based on 
the measurement settings they observe.
We still have the measurement settings (a, a', b, b') as different ways Alice and 
Bob decide to measure or analyze the colors of the balls (e.g., using a net, an 
umbrella, gloves, or bare hands.) However, in this scenario, Alice and Bob can delay 
their choice of measurement settings until after the balls are dispensed and just 
before they make the measurements.
As the balls are intelligent and can adapt independently, they observe how Alice 
and Bob prepare to measure them and individually set their colors to create the 
following outcomes:

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities

• E(a, b) = 1 (Alice: bare hands; Bob: net ^ Balls: both white.)
• E(a, b') = —1 (Alice: bare hands; Bob: umbrella ^ Balls: black and white.)
• E(a’,b) = 1 (Alice: gloves; Bob: net ^ Balls: both white.)
• E(a’,b') = 1 (Alice: gloves; Bob: umbrella ^ Balls: both black.)
Now, the Bell-CHSH quantity becomes:
|S| = |1 — (—1) + 1 + 1| = 4. 
(9.12)
As you can see, in this example, the value of |S | is 4, which violates the Bell- 
CHSH inequality (| S | < 2). This violation occurs because the intelligent balls do 
not adhere to the principle of realism; their colors are not predetermined but change 
based on the measurement settings at the time of the measurement. Furthermore, 
the balls need to communicate in order to decide whether they will display identical 
or opposite colors, which violates the locality assumption and makes it impossible 
to test a pair of balls simultaneously.
This analogy helps us understand the puzzling nature of quantum entanglement, 
where particles seemingly violate local realism in a similar way. However, as you 
will see in the subsequent sections, in the quantum case, the Bell inequality is 
violated under simultaneous measurements, even when the particles are separated 
by large distances. This violation is considered evidence of the non-classical nature 
of quantum entanglement, which cannot be explained by any classical theory based 
on local hidden variables.
In the subsequent discussion on experimental verification, we will explore Bell 
test experiments that are ‘loophole-free’, and are specifically designed to eliminate 
possibilities similar to those of the adaptable intelligent balls.
9.5 Bell-CHSH Inequality with Quantum Entanglement
9.5.1 Violation of the Bell CHSH Inequality: A Special Case
In this section, we will illustrate how the Bell CHSH inequality can be violated with 
a specific arrangement of measurement settings for Alice and Bob using entangled 
qubits. A comprehensive mathematical treatment of Bell CHSH inequality for Bell 
states will follow in the next section.
One key feature that separates quantum mechanics from classical probability 
theory is the way expected values of measurements are determined in quantum 
mechanics - they are governed by the inner products of measurement observables.
Let’s consider two entangled qubits, A and B, in the Bell state |^-) = ^(|01) — 
110)). This state is often used in experiments testing Bell inequalities with photons. 
If Alice employs Ma to measure her qubit and Bob uses Mb , the expected value of 
the joint measurement, analogous to the classical counterpart in Eq. 9.5, is given by:
E(a,b) = <^-| (Ma ® Mb) |^-). 
(9.13)
Now, let’s consider the following measurement observables for Alice and Bob:

These measurement observables are associated with measurement angles on the 
Bloch sphere a = 0, a' = 2, 0 = 4, and 0' = 3n, as depicted in Fig. 9.2.
Observe that
(0| Z 0 = 1, (1| Z |1) = -1,

demonstrating that the Bell-CHSH inequality is violated. This violation is a sig­
nature of quantum entanglement and shows that local hidden-variable theories are 
insufficient to account for the correlations observed in quantum systems.
An Analog for the Bell Inequality Violation
Consider a triangle with sides a, b, and c. Naturally, the sum of any two sides, say 
a + b, is greater than the third side, c. However, the relationship a2 + b2 > c2 is 
not universally true.
In the classical domain, if we associate probabilities with the lengths a, b, and 
c, the inequality a + b > c represents the Bell inequality holding true.
Contrastingly, in quantum mechanics, the linearly additive quantities are proba­
bility amplitudes instead of probabilities. Thus, when probabilities are associated 
with a2, b2, and c2, the inequality a2 + b2 c2 showcases the potential violation of 
the Bell inequality.
Exercise 9.2 Derive the Bell CHSH quantity S for the state |01) with the mea­
surement settings specified in this subsection. Note this state also gives rise to 
perfect anti-correlation when measured in the computational basis. Check if the 
Bell CHSH inequality is violated.
9.5.2 Violation of the Bell CHSH Inequality: General Case
We will defer the more general aspects of the Bell CHSH inequality and its violation 
in Bell states to § 9.8, given its mathematical complexities.

Key Takeaways
Bell inequalities provide a mathematical framework that allows for experiments 
to differentiate between these two cases: hidden variable theories and quantum 
theory of entanglement. These inequalities establish limits on the correlations 
that can be observed if the entangled particles followed local hidden variable 
theories. Experiments testing Bell inequalities have consistently shown that 
the predictions of quantum mechanics are correct, and the correlations between 
entangled particles are better explained by the non-local, instantaneous nature 
of quantum mechanics rather than local hidden variable theories.
9.6 Experimental Verification
Experimental verification of Bell’s inequality, also known as Bell tests, refers to 
tests of local realism against the predictions of quantum mechanics using entangled 
particles. These experiments are designed to measure the correlations between the 
outcomes of spatially separated particles to check whether they obey the constraints 
set by Bell inequalities, such as the Bell-CHSH inequality. If the inequalities are 
violated, it implies that local realism is incompatible with the observed behavior, and 
the particles exhibit nonlocal correlations characteristic of quantum entanglement.
9.6.1 * Basic Experimental Setup
A basic experimental setup to test the EPR paradox is illustrated in Fig. 9.3. 
The entangled photon pairs are generated through spontaneous parametric down­
conversion (SPDC), which is a widely-used method to produce pairs of entangled 
photons for various quantum communication and computation experiments. In 
SPDC, a single high-energy photon (labeled as pump laser) passes through a nonlinear 
BBO crystal, and occasionally, it splits into two lower-energy photons that are 
entangled. The entangled photons can be created in various Bell states, depending 
on the experiment setup and the properties of the nonlinear crystal. The state is 
commonly ^- = ^ (|01) - 110)), which means in terms of photon polarization:
* — = -2 (|^>1 ® |$2 - |t)1 ® |^>2) , 
(9.22)
where |^)1, |$) 1, |^}2> and |$)2 represent the horizontal and vertical polarizations 
of the two photons in the pair.
The two photons in each pair are sent to Alice and Bob, respectively, who are 
located at spatially separated locations. The transmission media can be free space 
or optical fiber, spanning distances up to hundreds of kilometers.
Both Alice and Bob pass their respective photons through a beam splitter (labeled 
BS in Fig. 9.3), which is essentially a half mirror. The beam splitter sends the 
photon in two different paths, corresponding to measurement bases a and a' for 
Alice, and b and b' for Bob, randomly. The splitter can also be replaced by an optical 
switch, which can be controlled by Alice or Bob to select the measurement bases.
The angles of the measurement bases (a, a' for Alice and fl, fl' for Bob) are 
adjusted using half-wave plates (HWP). The photon then arrives at a polarization 
beam splitter (PBS). The PBS sends the photon to different detectors according to

its polarization. The measurement results (always +1 or -1) are fed into a computer 
to analyze the correlations and calculate the Bell-CHSH quantity.
The experimental setup described above allows testing the Bell-CHSH inequality 
by measuring correlations between the polarization states of entangled photon pairs. 
By varying the settings of the measurement bases, one can obtain different values of 
the Bell-CHSH quantity S and check for violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality.
Early Experiments
Early experiments aimed at verifying Bell’s inequality played a crucial role in 
establishing the empirical basis for quantum entanglement. Notable among these 
are:
Aspect experiments (1981-1982) [16], [17]: Alain Aspect and his team conducted 
a series of groundbreaking experiments using entangled photons to test the Bell- 
CHSH inequality. They employed the technique of time-coincidence measurements, 
which involves ensuring that detections are only counted when they could be paired 
as originating from the same event, and observed strong correlations between the 
polarization states of the photons, which violated the Bell-CHSH inequality. These 
results provided strong evidence in favor of quantum mechanics over local hidden 
variable theories.
Weihs et al. (1998) [89]: In this experiment, Gregor Weihs and his team tested 
the Bell-CHSH inequality with entangled photon pairs over a distance of about 
400 meters. They used a high-efficiency source of entangled photon pairs and fast­

9.6 Experimental Verification
232
switching polarization analyzers. Their results showed a significant violation of the 
Bell-CHSH inequality, ruling out local hidden variable theories even for particles 
separated by large distances.
9.6.3 Loophole-free Measurements
There are several loopholes, or measurement flaws, that have been identified in 
earlier Bell test experiments:
Detection (or Fair Sampling) loophole: This loophole arises when the detectors 
used in the experiment have low efficiency or when there is a bias in the detection 
process. It suggests that the observed correlations could be a result of selective 
sampling rather than genuine quantum entanglement.
Communication (or Locality) loophole: This loophole arises when there is insuffi­
cient space or time separation between the measurement events, allowing for the 
possibility of classical communication between the detectors or the particles during 
the experiment.
Freedom-of-choice loophole: This loophole arises when the choice of measurement 
settings is not truly random or when there is a possibility that the measurement 
settings could be influenced by some unknown variables correlated with the particles.
“Loophole-free” Bell test experiments are designed to test the predictions of 
quantum mechanics against local hidden variable theories without being affected by 
any of the known loopholes.
Hensen et al. (2015) [54]: This experiment, also known as the “loophole-free Bell 
test,” addressed some of the potential loopholes in previous experiments, such as 
the detection loophole and the locality loophole. Unlike the previous experiments 
that used entangled photons, Hensen and his team used entangled electron spins 
in diamond nitrogen-vacancy centers separated by 1.3 kilometers, which offered 
different experimental advantages. They observed a statistically significant violation 
of the Bell-CHSH inequality, providing strong evidence against local realism.
Giustina et al. (2015) [45] and Shalm et al. (2015) [80]: These two experiments, 
conducted independently by different research groups, addressed the detection 
loophole and the locality loophole simultaneously. Both experiments used entangled 
photons and highly efficient detectors, ensuring that the observed correlations could 
not be explained by local hidden variable theories. The results of both experiments 
showed a clear violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality.
By separating the entangled particles by a significant distance and switching the 
measurement settings quickly, these experiments aimed to rule out the possibility of 
any local interaction or communication between the particles that could influence 
their correlated outcomes. This addresses the locality loophole, which suggests that 
entangled particles might exchange information or be influenced by a common cause 
in their local environment, thereby explaining the observed correlations.
9.6.4 Key Experimental Findings and Implications
The loophole-free experiments offer compelling evidence for the nonlocal character 
of quantum entanglement, a fundamental aspect in the comprehension of quantum 

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities 
233
phenomena. The consistent experimental confirmations of Bell’s inequalities are an 
important cornerstone in the development of quantum mechanics.
These experiments have profound implications for our understanding of the 
fundamental nature of the universe. They challenge the premise of local realism, 
which posits that physical properties are predetermined by the local environment 
and unaffected by measurement, and that no physical influence can travel faster 
than light. In contrast, the experimental results align with quantum mechanics, 
which predicts nonlocal correlations and intrinsic randomness.
Rejecting local realism leads to two possibilities: either accepting the concept of 
superluminal communication, akin to speculative notions found in science fiction 
but lacking scientific basis, or embracing the idea of quantum entanglement being 
inherently nonlocal. The latter is widely accepted in the scientific community, 
reinforcing the paradigm shift in our understanding of quantum interactions and 
their implications for the nature of reality.
Furthermore, the intrinsic randomness observed in quantum measurements, as 
quantified by Born’s rule (§ 1.5.1), underscores a departure from classical determinism. 
Born’s rule, which assigns probabilities to the outcomes of quantum measurements, is 
not a reflection of our ignorance about the system’s state but a fundamental aspect of 
quantum mechanics. This probabilistic nature reveals that, unlike classical systems 
where uncertainty often stems from incomplete knowledge, quantum randomness is 
an inherent feature of the universe.
9.6.5 2022 Nobel Prize in Physics
The Nobel Prize in Physics 2022 was awarded jointly to Alain Aspect, John F. 
Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger for experiments with entangled photons, establishing 
the violation of Bell inequalities and pioneering quantum information science.
Alain Aspect, John Clauser, and Anton Zeilinger are three prominent physicists 
who have made significant contributions to the experimental verification of quantum 
entanglement and the testing of local realism through Bell inequalities. Their 
work earned them the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2022. Aspect’s groundbreaking 
experiments in the 1980s provided strong evidence in favor of quantum mechanics 
over local hidden variable theories. Clauser, along with Stuart Freedman, performed 
one of the first experimental tests of Bell’s inequality in the early 1970s, which showed 
results consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics. Zeilinger has been a 
pioneer in the field of quantum information and has conducted numerous experiments 
on entanglement, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of quantum mechanics. 
The groundbreaking work of these physicists has been instrumental in shaping our 
current understanding of the nonlocal nature of quantum entanglement and the 
fundamental nature of the universe.
As highlighted by the 2022 Nobel Prize, the experimental verification of Bell’s 
inequalities has been central to the development and confirmation of quantum 
theory. It has challenged our classical intuitions and has opened new avenues for 
understanding the fundamental aspects of the physical world. As our understanding 
and technological capabilities evolve, future experiments may offer new insights into 
the nature of quantum entanglement and its implications for our understanding of 
the physical world. Additionally, the practical applications of entanglement in the 
fields of quantum computing, quantum communication, and quantum cryptography 

9.7 The No-Communication Theorem
234
make this area of research not only fundamentally interesting but also highly relevant 
to emerging technologies.
9.7 The No-Communication Theorem
Quantum entanglement and the violation of Bell’s inequalities raise questions re­
garding the possibility of transmitting information faster than the speed of light, 
a concept often dubbed “superluminal communication.” While entangled particles 
exhibit nonlocal correlations, it’s essential to recognize that these correlations do not 
allow for instantaneous information transfer between distant observers. Nonlocal 
correlations cannot be exploited for superluminal communication, preserving the 
fundamental principle that information cannot travel faster than light, and thereby 
maintaining the core tenets of special relativity and causality. This is formally stated 
as the no-communication theorem which is a key result in quantum information 
theory:
The No-Communication Theorem.
During the measurement of an entangled quantum state, it is fundamentally 
impossible for one observer to communicate information to another solely through 
the act of measurement.
Let’s consider a scenario where two observers, Alice and Bob, each hold one 
qubit of a two-qubit entangled state. If Alice measures her qubit, the state of her 
qubit collapses to a specific value. However, this does not immediately change the 
state of Bob’s qubit in any way that Bob can observe.
The no-communication theorem, despite the nonlocality of quantum mechanics, 
holds true primarily because the measurement outcome in quantum mechanics is 
intrinsically random. While Alice’s measurement collapses the overall state from her 
perspective, Bob, without additional information, can only see a random outcome 
when he measures his qubit. He cannot distinguish whether the randomness is due 
to quantum uncertainty or because of Alice’s prior measurement.
To illustrate this further, consider the Ekert 91 (E91) quantum key distribution 
(QKD) protocol (see § 10.6 for details). In this protocol, Alice and Bob use entangled 
pairs of qubits to generate a shared secret key. At first glance, it might seem as 
if Alice can instantaneously communicate secret key bits to Bob, especially if they 
have previously agreed on a sequence of measurement bases. However, the key they 
generate is a string of random bits, which carries no information about Alice’s state. 
It’s only after Alice communicates with Bob through a classical channel (which 
cannot exceed the speed of light) to discuss the measurement results that the key 
becomes useful.
A proof of the No-Communication Theorem is given in § 12.2.9.
9.7.1 Myths and Misconceptions
It is important to note that quantum entanglement is a well-defined concept within 
the realm of quantum mechanics, and it should not be conflated with unrelated 
phenomena. There are several myths and misconceptions surrounding quantum 
entanglement, often stemming from a misunderstanding of the underlying principles 

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities
235
of quantum mechanics or from misapplying quantum phenomena to everyday life. 
Here are a few examples:
• Instantaneous communication through entanglement: Although entanglement 
can create strong correlations between particles regardless of the distance 
between them, it cannot be used to transmit information instantaneously, 
as this would violate the principle of causality and the speed of light limit 
imposed by special relativity. The process of measurement and the collapse of 
entangled states still follow the constraints of relativistic causality.
• Macroscopic objects can be easily entangled: Entanglement is typically ob­
served at the level of subatomic particles, and it becomes increasingly difficult 
to maintain and observe entanglement as the size of the system increases. 
While there have been some experimental demonstrations of entanglement in 
larger systems, entangling macroscopic objects like everyday items or living 
organisms is extremely challenging due to decoherence and environmental 
factors.
• Entanglement as a source of paranormal phenomena: Some people may claim 
that quantum entanglement is responsible for various paranormal phenomena, 
such as telepathy or psychic powers. There are also claims of quantum 
entanglement between people and their spirit, between dreams and reality, 
and so on. However, there is no scientific evidence to support such claims. 
Entanglement is a well-established concept in quantum mechanics, but it has 
not been shown to have any connection to paranormal phenomena.
9.8 * Derivation of Bell-CHSH Quantity for Bell States
In this section, we present a more general, step by step analysis of the Bell CHSH 
inequality. We use the Bell state |^-) for this purpose; other Bell states follow 
similarly.
9.8.1 * Derivation via Measurement Bases
1 
Measurement Bases and Observables
Suppose a qubit is measured along a direction defined by the polar angle a and the 
azimuthal angle 0 on the Bloch sphere. Effectively, it is measured using the basis 
{|a), |a4}:
|a) = cos ;2 |0) + sin a |1), 
(9.23a)
|a±) = — sin 2 0 + cos 2 |1). 
(9.23b)
The associated measurement observables can be represented as:
Ma = |a)(a| - |a±Xa±|. 
(9.24)
In the Bell CHSH inequality, there are four bases and four measurement observ­
ables involved, similar to the above. For each pair of qubits, Alice selects one of the 
two bases, {|a), |a±)} or {|a'), |a'A_)}, to measure qubit A:

9.8 * Derivation of Bell-CHSH Quantity for Bell States 
236
|a} = cos a |0) + sin a |1), 
|a±) = - sin 2 |0) +cos a |1), 
(9.25a)
| a') = cos 2 |0) + sin 2 |1), 
| a 'J = - sin a |0) + cos a |1). 
(9.25b)
Similarly, Bob chooses between the bases {|b), |b±)} and {|b'), |bL_)} for measuring 
qubit B:
|b} = cos 2 |0) + sin 2 |1), 
|b±) = - sin 2 0 + cos 2 |1), 
(9.26a)
|b'} = cos 2 |0) + sin y |!), 
|bD = - sin 2 |0) + cos y |!). 
(9.26b)
These four measurement bases correspond to the angles a, a', 2, and 2' on the 
Bloch sphere.
The corresponding measurement observables are:
Ma = | a)(a | -■ |a±)(a±|,
(9.27a)
Ma' = |a '}( a 1 -|aD(aL|,
(9.27b)
Mb = | b)(b | - |b±)(bL ,
(9.27c)
Mb> = |b')(b'| --|bD(bL|.
(9.27d)
When Alice measures qubit A and Bob measures qubit B, they employ joint 
measurement observables like the following:
Mab = Ma ® Mb.
(9.28)
2 
Measurement Expected Values
To check the Bell-CHSH inequality, we will calculate the expected values of the 
products of the outcomes, or correlation functions, E(a, b), E(a, b'), E(a',b), and 
E(a', b'). Note in quantum mechanics, expected values are computed using inner 
products, which is a fundamental distinction from classical mechanics:
E(a,b) = (tf-| (Ma ® Mb) |^-),
(9.29a)
E(a,b') = (^-| (Ma ® Mb,) |^-),
(9.29b)
E(a',b) = (^-| (Ma/ ® Mb) |^-),
(9.29c)
E(a',b') = (^-| (Ma, ® Mb,) |*-).
(9.29d)
After some algebraic manipulations (see § 9.8.1.5), we obtain:
E(a, b) = - cos(a - 2),
(9.30a)
E(a, b') = - cos(a - 2'),
(9.30b)
E (a' ,b) = - cos(a' - 2),
(9.30c)
E(a', b') = - cos(a' - 2').
(9.30d)
The result in Eq. 9.30 is remarkable in its own right. It implies that the measure­
ment correlations solely depend on the difference between the measurement angles, 

Chapter 9. Entanglement and Bell Inequalities
237
rather than their individual values. For example, if a = 0, then E(a,b) = — 1, 
signifying that the state |^-) exhibits isotropic anti-correlations. This is further 
supported by the equation:
|*-) = -12(R — R)
= 72(| aa — | a± a‘
This is quite different from correlated classical spins. In fact, this is an underlying 
reason for the violation of the Bell inequality.
3 
The Bell CHSH Quantity
Inserting the expressions from Eq. 9.30 into the Bell-CHSH quantity in Eq. 9.8 we 
obtain:
S = E(a, b) — E(a, b') + E(a', b) + E(a', b') 
(9.31a)
= — cos( a — 0) + cos( a — 0') — cos( a' — 0) — cos( a' — 0'). 
(9.31b)
Exercise 9.3 Derive expressions of the Bell-CHSH quantity S (similar to Eq. 9.31) 
for the other three Bell states.
4 
Violation of the Bell CHSH Inequality
Upon examining Eq. 9.31, we observe that it is feasible to select angles a, a', 0, and 
0’ such that | S | exceeds 2, thereby violating the Bell-CHSH inequality. Specifically, 
by setting a = 0, 0 = n, a' = n, and 0' = 3n (as depicted in Fig. 9.2), we find that: 
|SI = 2 1^2 — (—^2) + ^2+ ^2| =2^2 > 2• 
(9.32)
This result illustrates that the Bell-CHSH inequality can be violated by entangled 
qubits in a quantum scenario, which implies that local hidden-variable theories are 
insufficient in fully accounting for the correlations in quantum systems.
The measurement observables Ma, Ma, Mb, and Mb can be expressed as linear 
combinations of Pauli operators. For the angles specified above, they correspond 
to Pauli operators or their simple linear combinations given by Eq. 9.14.
Exercise 9.4 Consider the product state
|++) = |+) ® |+) = 2(|00> + |11> + |01> + |10» •
Derive S for this state as a function of a and 0. Investigate if the Bell CHSH 
inequality can be violated with this state.
5 
Derivation of Eq. 9.30
Start with the expected values of Ma across the one-qubit basis states:

9.8 * Derivation of Bell-CHSH Quantity for Bell States
238
(0| Ma |0) = cos a,
(9.33a)
(1| Ma |1) = - cos a,
(9.33b)
(1| Ma |0) = sin a,
(9.33c)
(0| Ma |1) = sin a.
(9.33d)
Now calculate the expected values of Ma ® Mb across the two-qubit basis states:
<11| (Ma ® Mb) |11> = (1| Ma |1) (1| Mb |1) = cos a cos P,
(9.34a)
(001 (Ma ® Mb) |00> = (0| Ma |0) (0| Mb |0) = cos a cos P,
(9.34b)
<11| (Ma ® Mb) |00> = (1| Ma |0) (1| Mb |0) = sin a sin P,
(9.34c)
<00| (Ma ® Mb) |11> = (0| Ma |1) (0| Mb |1) = sin a sin P,
(9.34d)
<01| (Ma ® Mb) |01> = (0| Ma |0) (1| Mb |1) = — cos a cos P,
(9.34e)
<10| (Ma ® Mb) |10> = (1| Ma |1) (0| Mb |0) = — cos a cos P,
(9.34f)
<01| (Ma ® Mb) |10> = (0| Ma |1) (1| Mb |0) = sin a sin P,
(9.34g)
<10| (Ma ® Mb) |01> = (1| Ma |0) (0| Mb |1) = sin a sin ft.
(9.34h)
Finally, calculate the expected values of Ma ® Mb for the Bell states:
M (Ma ® Mb) |$+) = cos a cos P + sin a sin P = cos(a — P),
(9.35a)
($-| (Ma ® Mb) |$-) = cos a cos P — sin a sin P = cos(a + P),
(9.35b)
(* +| (Ma ® Mb) |$+) = — cos a cos P + sin a sin P = — cos( a + P),
(9.35c)
(* - | (Ma ® Mb) |^-) = — cos a cos P — sin a sin P = — cos(a — P).
(9.35d)
9.8.2 * Derivation Using Pauli Operators
This subsection outlines a general derivation of the Bell CHSH inequality using Pauli 
matrices (X, Y, Z). This approach is based on expressing measurement operators as 
linear combinations of the Pauli matrices. Even though more abstract, this approach 
is a powerful technique that can be used to analyze more general scenarios beyond 
the Bell inequalities.
1 
Outline of the Derivation
The measurement operator in the direction specified by a 3D unit vector a = 
(ai ,a2 ,a3) is given by:
Ma = a • a
(9.36a)
= a 1 a 1 + a 2 a 2 + a 3 a 3,
(9.36b)
where a 1 = X, a2 = Y, and a3 = Z are the Pauli operators.
Suppose Alice measures her qubit along directions a and a', and Bob b and b'. 
Then the measurement correlation functions are given by:
E(a, b) = (* -| (Ma ® Mb) |^-}, 
E(a, b') = (^-| (MA ® Mb,) |^-), 
E(A, b) = (^-| (Ma, ® Mb) |^-), 
E(a', b') = (^-| (Ma, ® Mb,) |^-).

(9.37b) 
(9.37c)

With much algebra (see subsection below), it can be shown:
E(a, b) = —a • b 
(9.38a)
= -(a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3) 
(9.38b)
= — cos $ Ab, 
(9.38c)
where 0Ab represents the angle between a and b.
And similarly for the other correlation functions. These results mirror Eq. 9.30.
The Bell CHSH quantity is:
S = E(a, b) — E(a, b') + E(a', b) + E(a', b') 
(9.39a)
= — cos $Ab + cos $ab' - cos $A'b - cos $a'b' ■ 
(9.39b)
Now we can pick non-coplanar measurement directions to demonstrate the 
violation of Bell CHSH inequality. A particular choice is:
a' = (0, 1, 0),
a = (1, 0, 0) ,
(9.40a)
(9.40b)
(9.40c)
(9.40d)
This yields S = -^= which is smaller than 2\/2 but still greater than 2.

Derivation of Eq. 9.38
Let us consider the correlation function E(a, b):
E(a, b) = ($-| (MA 0 MB) |^-} 
(9.41a)
= (^-1 ((a 1 a 1 + a2a2 + a3a3) 0 (b 1 a 1 + b2a2 + b3a3)) |^-) 
(9.41b)

= ^^2 aibj ^- (ai 0 aj) ^- ■ 
(9.41C)
i=1 j=1
Now, it can be shown that
<^-| (ai 0 aj) |^-) = — Sij■
(9.42)
While we will not delve into the detailed algebra required to prove this equation 
here, it is important to note the following insight. This equation indicates that there 
is a perfect anti-correlation in the Bell state |^-) when Alice and Bob measure their 
qubits along the same direction, meaning they will always obtain opposite outcomes. 
However, if the measurement directions are orthogonal, the correlation function is 
zero.
Substituting this result back into Eq. 9.41, we obtain:

E(a, B) = 
aibi <^-| (ai Z ai) |^“)
= -a1 b1 - a2 b2 - a3 b3 ,
(9.43a)
(9.43b)
which matches Eq. 9.38.
We can derive E(a, B) for other Bell states similarly. Here is a summary:
(S+| (Ma z Mb) |$+) =
a1b1 - a2b2 + a3b3,
(9.44a)
($+1 (Ma Z Mb) |tf+) =
a1b1 + a2b2 - a3b3,

9.10 Summary and Conclusions
The Enigma of Quantum Entanglement
The chapter set forth a profound exploration into the realm of quantum entanglement, 
an inherently quantum phenomenon that sets quantum systems apart from their 
classical counterparts. The inseparable correlation exhibited by entangled particles 
challenges classical notions, particularly local realism, leading to far-reaching impli­
cations in both the theoretical and experimental domains of quantum mechanics. 
Through an examination of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, the chap­
ter underscored the tension between quantum mechanics and classically intuitive 
perspectives on reality.
Bell Inequalities: Bridging Theory and Experiment
Central to the discourse on quantum entanglement are the Bell inequalities, which 
serve as invaluable mathematical tools to distinguish quantum correlations from 
classical ones. Specifically, the Bell-CHSH inequality, a particular form of Bell 
inequalities, emerged as a focal point in our discussions. Experiments testing these 
inequalities have consistently highlighted the nonlocal correlations between entangled 
particles, emphasizing that these correlations are intrinsically quantum and cannot 
be explained by local hidden variable theories. The reaffirmation of the nonlocal 
nature of quantum entanglement by loophole-free measurements has further solidified 
the understanding that quantum mechanics provides a more accurate description of 
reality than classical intuitions might suggest.
The No-Communication Theorem
While quantum entanglement might seem like a conduit for faster-than-light commu­
nication given its nonlocal characteristics, the no-communication theorem elucidates 
that this is not the case. This theorem effectively ensures that quantum mechan­
ics remains consistent with relativity, barring the instantaneous transmission of 
information through quantum measurements.
A Methodical Delve into Bell-CHSH Inequality
For those academically inclined, the chapter probed deeper into the mathematical 
intricacies of the Bell-CHSH inequality using Bell states, exemplifying the conceptual 
richness and rigor of the subject.
Upcoming Topics
As we progress into the next chapter, our emphasis will shift from the theoretical 
underpinnings of quantum entanglement to its versatile applications. We will 
journey through key concepts like superdense coding and quantum teleportation, 
unravelling how quantum entanglement can be harnessed to facilitate groundbreaking 
advancements in quantum communication and computation. The indispensable role 
of quantum teleportation, in particular, will be accentuated, given its foundational

importance in the realm of quantum technologies.
This transition from the foundational understanding of entanglement to its 
practical applications in the next chapter will provide a holistic view, bridging the 
gap between abstract quantum principles and their real-world implications.

(d) How do the findings of Bell-test experiments relate to the no-superluminal

is not applicable in the quantum realm. Which one is it, or are both 
concepts challenged?

with both Bell inequality violations and a form of realism?
(i) Is it possible to have a local but non-realistic theory that accurately 
describes quantum mechanics?

CHSH inequality is violated.
9.4 The CHSH Game is a thought experiment involving two players, Alice and 
Bob, who are separated by a great distance and cannot communicate with each 
other. The game is played with a referee who provides inputs and determines 
the outcome.
Rules of the Game:
• Inputs: The referee randomly gives Alice and Bob each a single bit (0 or 
1) as input.
• Outputs: Alice and Bob each provide a single bit (0 or 1) as output, 
without knowing the other player’s input.
• Winning Condition: Alice and Bob win the round if the following rule is 
satisfied: The XOR of their outputs must equal the AND of their inputs. 
In other words, their outputs should be different (01 or 10) only when 
both received a 1 for inputs.
Strategies and Winning Probabilities:
• Classical Strategy (Local Hidden Variables): In the classical world, Alice 
and Bob could pre-agree on a strategy or have some locally shared 
information (“hidden variables”) to coordinate their answers.
• Quantum Strategy (Entanglement): Alice and Bob share an entangled 
pair of qubits and perform specific measurements based on their inputs.
Your tasks are to demostrate:
(a) The best classical strategy leads to a maximum winning probability of 
75%.
(b) With the quantum strategy, they can achieve a winning probability of 
approximately 85%!

9.5 Three-Qubit Bell Inequality. Charlie prepares many pairs of coins and 
sends one coin of each pair to Alice and the other to Bob. These coins are 
set to land randomly as Heads (H) or Tails (T), each maintaining perfect 
correlation or anticorrelation with its paired coin.
Alice and Bob each have three landing pads for the coins, labeled A1 , A2 , 
A3 for Alice and B1 , B2 , B3 for Bob, respectively. Each coin lands on a pad 
matched with the pad of its pair of the other participant (i.e., a coin on A2 is 
matched with the coin on B2), revealing either Heads (H) or Tails (T).
Alice and Bob verify the perfect correlation of their coin pairs by confirming 
that:
P(A1 =B1) =P(A2 =B2) =P(A3 =B3) = 1,
and perfect anticorrelation by confirming that:
P(A1 =B1) =P(A2 =B2) =P(A3 =B3) = 1.
They also compute a correlation C from many observations:
C=P(A1 =B2)+P(A2 =B3)+P(A3 = B1).
Here, P (Ai = Bj ) denotes the probability that Alice’s coin on pad Ai and 
Bob’s coin on pad Bj show the same face, i.e., both are Heads (H, H) or both 
are Tails (T, T). Show that:
(a) If different pairs of coins are also perfectly correlated, then C = 3.
(b) If the coins alternate between being perfectly correlated and perfectly 
anticorrelated across the pairs, then C = 1.
(c) In the general case, C satisfies C > 1.
Here, C > 1 represents a version of Bell’s inequality for three qubits. In 
classical systems, the outcomes for pairs of coins are bound by the statistical 
constraint C > 1. Yet, quantum entanglement allows for the violation of this 
classical limit. Show that:
(d) If Alice and Bob use entangled qubit pairs instead of classical coins, and if 
Alice’s measurements are set at angles 0)°, 120°, and — 120)° (corresponding 
to A 1, A2, and A3), while Bob’s are at 180°, —60°, and 60)° (corresponding 
to B1, B2, and B3), they can achieve C = 0.75, violating the classical 
bound of C > 1.

is the most fundamental, and we will delve into it in extensive detail. However, we 
will begin our journey with superdense coding, as it is the most straightforward to 
understand given its operation on the basis states of only two qubits.

quantum entanglement-based applications.

10.2 Superdense Coding
10.2.1 Introduction
Basic information theory dictates that by sending n bits, one cannot communicate 
more than n bits of information. Superdense coding, however, is a quantum commu­
nication protocol that defies this limit by enabling the transmission of two classical 
bits of information using only a single qubit. This remarkable achievement is made 
possible through the use of quantum entanglement, local operations, and classical 
communication channels. In the absence of prior entanglement, the sender is limited 
to conveying no more than one bit of information per qubit, a constraint fundamen­
tally outlined in Holevo’s Theorem (§ 13.3.2). Superdense coding opens the door to 
potential advancements in communication efficiency, secure data transmission, and 
distributed quantum computing.
Superdense Coding: Core Intuition
Superdense coding utilizes: (1) the transformation of any Bell pair into another 
by applying a Pauli gate to one of the qubits locally (see § 10.1.3); and (2) the 
orthogonality of Bell states, which enables their perfect discrimination through 
measurement, as discussed in § 8.2.
10.2.2 Step-by-Step Analysis
1 Bell State Preparation
The procedure of supserdense coding encompasses four primary steps, as depicted in

(10.4)
2 Encoding
Alice wants to send two classical bits of information, ij , to Bob. Depending on the 
two bits she wants to send, Alice applies some Pauli gates to her qubit, according to 
Table 10.3. For ‘00’, no gates are applied. For ‘01’, the Z gate is applied. For ‘10’, 
the X gate is applied. For ‘11’, both the X and Z gates are applied. These gates 
transform the original Bell state |$+) = |ft00) to another Bell state, which is the 
system state after encoding:

3 Decoding
Alice sends her qubit to Bob. Bob now has both qubits. He applies a CNOT gate 
with the received qubit as control and his own as the target, followed by a Hadamard 
gate on the control qubit. Bob then measures both qubits in the computational basis. 
Bob thus effectively performs a Bell measurement, and recovers the two classical 
bits Alice intended to send.

Exercise 10.1 Explain how to perform superdense coding if Alice and Bob share 
a different Bell state at the start (e.g., |$-), |'+), or |'-))- What operations 
should Alice use to encode her two bits of information?
Why is superdense coding potentially more efficient than classical transmission 
if both methods involve two bits? In superdense coding, one of the qubits can 
be shared with the receiver before the message is decided. So, when it’s time to 
communicate the message, only one qubit needs to be sent. This method converts 
high-latency bandwidth into low-latency bandwidth. The receiver measures two 
qubits, but the first one could have been received long before the message was 
decided. This technique can effectively double the communication rate, given enough 
pre-shared entanglement.
10.2.3 * Further Exploration
There are variations and extensions to the concept of superdense coding. These 
variations encompass the type and dimension of the quantum states utilized, the 
number of participants, and the operations applied to the states. Aspired learners 
are encouraged to delve into these topics to gain a comprehensive understanding.
1. Higher-dimensional Systems and Quantum Networks [50]: The protocol 
of superdense coding has been extended beyond mere qubits. Its evolution 
is discussed from discrete and continuous variables to quantum networks. 
This progress report elucidates the foundational theoretical principles behind 
quantum dense coding and spans its variant protocols to its applications in 
quantum secure communication.
2. Probabilistic Superdense Coding [71]: The feasibility of performing superdense 
coding with nonmaximally entangled states is examined in this study. The 
authors highlight that it’s possible to transmit two classical bits probabilistically 
by sending just one qubit.
3. Distributed Quantum Dense Coding [32]: In this paper, the notion of dis­
tributed quantum dense coding is introduced. This is a generalization of 
quantum dense coding that incorporates more than one sender and receiver. 
The research proposes a classification scheme of quantum states based on their 

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
251
utility in dense coding. The study particularly emphasizes that in the bipartite 
scenario, bound entanglement is not conducive for this endeavor.
10.3 Quantum Teleportation
Quantum teleportation facilitates the transfer of quantum information (the state of a 
qubit) from one point to another without physically transmitting the qubit itself. This 
remarkable accomplishment is realized via entanglement, classical communication 
channels, and local operations. Quantum teleportation has potential applications in 
secure communication and distributed quantum computing.
Quantum teleportation is the only known method capable of transferring quantum 
information between systems without data loss. Due to quantum superposition, 
it’s impossible to measure and replicate all properties of a quantum system for 
reconstruction elsewhere. In quantum mechanics, a system exists in a combination 
of multiple potential states. Upon measurement, the system collapses to a single 
state, erasing information about other possibilities. Quantum teleportation, however, 
enables the replication of a qubit state, including its superposition, in another qubit. 
This process results in the destruction of the original state in the source qubit, thus 
adhering to the no-cloning theorem.
Quantum teleportation not only forms a key foundation in quantum computing, 
but also serves as an exemplary case study for contrasting and comprehending differ­
ent analytical methods. If you aim to pioneer in the field of quantum computation 
or potentially conceive innovative algorithms similar to quantum teleportation, it is 
essential to have a comprehensive understanding of these varied methods. Through 
this exploration, our goal is to arm you with the analytical tools necessary for further 
pioneering and advancement in this domain.
10.3.1 Introduction
Quantum teleportation is a complex process that facilitates the transfer of quantum 
information from one point to another, without physically moving the quantum 
system itself. At its heart, this procedure encompasses four primary steps, as 
depicted in Fig. 10.4.
1. Establishing Entanglement: The sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) share 
an entangled quantum state, typically a pair of qubits in a Bell state.
2. Bell Measurement: Alice conducts a Bell measurement on her part of the 
entangled pair and the qubit she wishes to teleport, collapsing these qubits 
into one of four Bell states. This action annihilates the original state of the 
qubit Alice intends to teleport.
3. Classical Communication: Alice conveys the outcomes of her measurement to 
Bob via a classical communication channel.
4. State Reconstruction: On receiving this information, Bob applies a specific 
quantum gate to his part of the entangled pair, contingent on Alice’s measure­
ment result. This step reproduces the original quantum state of the qubit that 
Alice intended to teleport on Bob’s qubit.

Figure 10.5: Fundamental Quantum Circuit for Teleportation
Several strategies exist for analyzing and comprehending quantum teleportation, 
and our objective is to explore three separate but interrelated approaches: the basis 
state approach, the logic operation approach, and the Bell measurement approach. 
Each of these methods showcases essential toolsets and provides unique insights 
into this foundational concept, thereby proving invaluable in the analysis of more 
advanced quantum algorithms.
10.3.2 Basis State Approach
This approach involves examining the teleportation circuit separately for each of 
the basis states |0) and |1). Utilizing the principle of linearity inherent to quantum 
transformations, we can subsequently combine these separate analyses to understand 
the teleportation of a general quantum state |^) = a |0) + 0 11), which Alice wishes 
to transmit.
This method allows us to derive the state of all three qubits at each step without 
invoking advanced concepts such as Bell measurements. However, a downside of this 

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
253
approach is that the fundamental physical principles become somewhat obscured 
within routine algebraic manipulations.
1 Deferred Measurement Principle
To simplify the analysis, we will employ the principle of deferred measurement 
(introduced in § 7.4.5). This principle states that measurements can be shifted 
from an intermediate stage of a quantum circuit to the end. Furthermore, if the 
measurement results are used at any point in the circuit, the classically controlled 
operations can be replaced by quantum controlled operations.
Leveraging this principle, we can substitute classically controlled X and Z gates 
with quantum CX (i.e., CNOT) and CZ gates, as illustrated in Fig. 10.6. The 
subsequent analysis uses this version of the quantum teleportation circuit.

2 Establishing Entanglement
The initial state vector of the system after the Bell state preparation is:
|*o)  =
(|000> + |011»
(|100> + |111»
for basis state |0), 
for basis state |1).
(10.5)
3 Alice Applies CNOT Gate
Now Alice applies a CNOT gate with her qubit (first qubit) as the control and her 
entangled qubit (second qubit) as the target:
I*1>  =
(|000> + |011»
(|110> + |101»
for basis state |0), 
for basis state |1).
(10.6)
4 Alice Applies H Gate
Then Alice applies a Hadamard gate to her qubit:
|_ 
f 2 (|000> +1011> +1100> + |m»
1 2} U (|010> + |001>-|110>-|101»
for basis state |0), 
for basis state 11).
(10.7)
5 Bob Applies CX Gate
Then Alice measures the second qubit and Bob applies an X gate to the third qubit 
if the measurement result is 1. This is equivalent to applying a controlled-X (same 
as CNOT) gate, which flips the third qubit if the second qubit is 1.
|*3>  =
2 (|000> +1010> + |1gg> +1110»

for basis state |0), 
for basis state 11).
(10.8)

10.3 Quantum Teleportation

Bob Applies CZ Gate
Finally, Alice measures the first qubit and Bob applies a Z gate to the third qubit 
if the measurement result is 1. This is equivalent to applying a controlled-Z gate, 
which changes the sign of the state vector if both the second and third qubits are 1.

for basis state |0), 
for basis state |1),
for basis state |0), 
for basis state |1).
(10.9)
(10.10)
If we use |x) to represent the basis states, where x e {0,1}, we can combine the 
above equation as:
|*4
> = 1(0 + |1» ® (|0> + |1» ®|x). 
(10.11)
At this stage, it becomes evident that the third qubit has become disentangled 
from the first two qubits, since its state is now a component of a product state. 
Specifically, it is in the state |x). Since |x) can represent any basis state and quantum 
transformations are linear by nature, Eq. 10.11 will still hold if we replace |x) with 
a general qubit state |^). In fact, |^4) = |+) |+) |^). This indicates that Alice has 
successfully teleported her qubit state |^) to Bob.
10.3.3
* Logic Operation Approach
This method builds on the basis state approach but deviates by directly deriving 
equations for the combined state |x), rather than considering individual basis 
states. This is achieved by employing mathematical operations using the Boolean 
representation technique, similar to Boolean algebra used for classical logic gates.
The Boolean representation of quantum gates and circuits is detailed in § 7.3. 
Below is a brief summary.
With |x) and |y) representing |0) and |1), i.e., x,y e {0,1}, and x = 1 — x, 
y = 1 — y, the Boolean representation of some popular gates is summarized in 
Table 10.4.

Here, ® denotes the exclusive OR (or XOR) Boolean operator, which corresponds 
to bitwise modulo 2 addition. Below are some useful identities related to XOR:

(10.12a)

(10.12b)

(10.12c)
x ®1 = 1® x = x
(10.12d)
x ® x = 0
(10.12e)

(10.12f)

(10.12h)
(—1) x ® y = (—1) x® y = (-1)1+x+y.
(10.12i)
With the above mathematical tool, let’s revisit the steps from the basis states 
approach, referring to Fig. 10.6.
1 
Establishing Entanglement
The initial state vector of the system is:
|*o)  = ^=(| x 00) + | x 11)). 
(10.13)
2 
Alice Applies CNOT Gate
Now Alice applies a CNOT gate with her qubit (first qubit) as the control and her 
entangled qubit (second qubit) as the target:
I*,) =-2x (0 ®x )0>+|x (1 ®x )1» 
<10-14a)
= -1=(|xx 0) + |xx1». 
(10.14b)
Did the CNOT operation entangle the first and second qubit? Yes. Even though 
|*i)  = |x) ® ^(|x0) + |x1)) appears to be a product state, it is not. It represents 
^= (a |0) (|00) + |11)) + fl |1) (110) + |01))) which cannot be decomposed as the 
tensor product of a |0) + fl |1) with another state.
3 
Alice Applies H Gate
Then Alice applies a Hadamard gate to her qubit (first qubit). To make the equations 
shorter, let’s rewrite |*1)  as:
|*i)  = | x )®—=(| x 0) + | x1)). 
(10.15)
After the application of the H gate:
|*2) = -= (|0) + (-1)x |1» ® -1=(|x0) + |®1» 
(10.16a)
= 1(|0x0) + |0x1) + (-1)x |1 x0) + (-1)x |1 x1)). 
(10.16b)

10.3 Quantum Teleportation
256
How many qubits are currently entangled? Three. Although Eq. 10.16a seems 
to represent a product state, the inclusion of the (—1)x factor renders it not a 
genuine product state.
4 
Bob Applies CX Gate
Then Alice measures the second qubit and Bob applies an X gate to the third qubit 
if the measurement result is 1. Due to the deferred measurement theorem, this is 
equivalent to applying a CX (i.e., CNOT) gate.
I^3> = 1 (|0x(x ® 0)) + |0x(x ® 1)
+ (-1)x |1 x(x ® 0)) + (-1)x |1 x(x ® 1)» 
(10.17a)
= 2(|0xx) + |0xx) + (—1)x |1 xx) + (—1)x |1 xx)). 
(10.17b)
5 
Bob Applies CZ Gate
Finally, Alice measures the first qubit and Bob applies a Z gate to the third qubit if 
the measurement result is 1:
|^4> = 1(|0xx} + |0xx} + (—1)x(—1)x |1 xx)
+ (—1)x(—1)x |1 xx)) 
(10.18a)
= 2(|0 xx) + |0 x x) + |1 xx) + |1 x x)) 
(10.18b)
= 2(|0) + |1)) ® (|x} + |x» ® |x} 
(10.18c)
= 2(|0> + |1» ® (|0> + |1» ®|x). 
(10.18d)
At this stage, it becomes evident that the three qubits become disentangled, and 
the third qubit is |x). Alice has successfully teleported her qubit state |^) to Bob.
Exercise 10.2 Try to replicate the above analysis steps. This time, however, 
assume that Alice and Bob share a different Bell state, |^-), at the start.
10.3.4 * Bell Measurement Approach
We will now examine the quantum teleportation process by utilizing Bell measure­
ment, discussed § 8.4, as an analytical tool. Despite incorporating the advanced 
concept of Bell measurement, this approach provides the clearest physical intuition 
about the construction of the teleportation circuit in Fig. 10.5.
1 
Establishing Entanglement
Alice wants to send a quantum state |^) = a |0) + ^ |1) to Bob. They share an 
entangled pair of qubits in the Bell state |$+) = ^^g(|00) + |11)). The initial state 
vector of the system can be written as:

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
257
|*o)  = -12(a |0) + V |1» ® (|00> + |11»
= -12(a |000> + a |011> + V |100> + V |111»
= -12(a |00> + V |10» |0) + -12(a |01> + V |11» |1).
(10.19a)
(10.19b)
(10.19c)
In the last step, we have singled out the 3rd qubit since we are going to measure the 
first two qubit in the next step.
2 
Bell Measurement
Alice applies a CNOT gate with her qubit as the control and the entangled qubit as 
the target. Then she applies a Hadamard gate to her qubit. Finally, she measures 
the two qubits, effectively performing a Bell measurement on them.
The four Bell states form an orthonormal basis for two-qubit states. By perform­
ing Bell measurements, Alice projects the two-qubit states onto the Bell states.
The measurement operators, for the overall system of three qubits, are given by:
Mij = | Vij HVij | ® I,
(10.20)
where i, j e {0, 1}, Vij are the Bell states given by Eq. 10.1, and I is the identity 
operator applied to the 3rd qubit.
After the measurement, depending on the measurement result (i, j), the system 
will be in the state:
|*i)  = Mij |*o)  
(10.21a)
= -2(| VijXVij| ® I)((a |00> + V 110» |0) + (a |01> + V |11» |1» 
(10.21b)
= -12 |Pij){Pij| (a |00> + V |10» 0
+ -12 |VijXVij | (a |01> + V |11» |1) 
(10.21c)
= |Vij} ® |^ij}, 
(10.21d)
where |■fiij) is defined in Table 10.2, copied below for convenience:
|$oo) = a |0) + V |1),
(10.22a)
|^oi) = a |1) + V |0),
(10.22b)
|^io) = a |0) - V |1),
(10.22c)
|^ii) = a |1) - V |0).
(10.22d)
How is |^i) in this equation related to the |^i) in Eq. 10.6? The latter is a linear 
combination of the four cases of the former - see Eq. 10.23.

10.3 Quantum Teleportation

Classical Communication
Alice transmits the measurement outcomes (i, j , representing two bits of information) 
to Bob through a classical communication channel. It is important to note that 
the original qubit state encapsulates more information than merely two bits; it’s 
characterized by two complex numbers, a and P. Furthermore, exact values cannot 
be obtained from a single measurement, as performing a measurement invariably 
disrupts the original quantum state.
4 State Reconstruction
Based on the two bits (i, j) resulting from Alice’s measurements, Bob will apply the 
necessary correction gates to his qubit: a Z gate is applied if i = 1, and an X gate 
is applied if j = 1.

The final state vector of Bob’s qubit becomes |^) = a |0)+P |1). Now Bob’s qubit 
is in the same state as Alice’s initial qubit, completing the quantum teleportation 
process.
For measurement outcome ‘11’, both an X and a Z gate are applied. Their 
sequence does not matter in this case, as swapping their order only incurs a global 
phase shift (XZ = — ZX), which is unobservable in quantum mechanics. However, 
if subsequent stages involve interference with other qubits, the order may become 
crucial due to the potential impact on relative phases. In such scenarios, the 
correct sequence is X before Z, i.e., in operator terms, ZX.
Exercise 10.3 Try to replicate the above analysis steps. This time, however, 
assume that Alice and Bob share a different Bell state, specifically |^-), at the 
outset. What differences do you observe from the initial scenario?
Quantum Teleportation: Core Summary
This analysis captures the essence of quantum teleportation. The initial state 
vector can be decomposed into the orthonormal Bell basis as follows:
|*o)  = ^(a 0 + P |1» ® (|00> + |11»,
= 2 
|Pj® |^ij. 
(10.23)

259
where |flj) represents the Bell states, as defined in Eq. 10.1, and |^ij) is defined 
in Table 10.2 and Eq. 10.22a.
When Alice measures the first two qubits in the Bell basis {flij}, each of the 
Bell states occurs with equal probability. If she obtains |flij) (where i, j e {0, 1}), 
the state of the system collapses to | flij) ® |^ij), and the third qubit takes on 
the state |^ij).
The third qubit can then be adjusted based on Alice’s measurement results 
(i, j) to reconstruct the original state a |0) + fl |1).
10.3.5 * Further Exploration
The concept of quantum teleportation extends beyond the basic protocol discussed 
in this text. Many variations and enhancements center around the nature and 
dimensionality of the quantum states used, the number of parties involved, and 
the types of operations executed on the states. For those seeking to deepen their 
understanding, the following topics are suggested for further exploration:
1. Quantum Teleportation of Composite Systems and Entanglement [7]: : This 
topic deals with the teleportation of composite systems, which can involve 
multiple entangled qubits. Understanding this concept is fundamental in 
advancing complex quantum information processing protocols.
2. Superdense Teleportation [47]: : This variant combines principles of quantum 
teleportation and superdense coding to enable the transfer of more information 
than either standalone protocol. This involves the teleportation of a two-qubit 
state using two classical bits and a shared entangled pair of qubits.
3. Higher-dimensional Quantum Teleportation [26]: : While the fundamental 
quantum teleportation protocol involves qubits, researchers have broadened 
this framework to include qudits. Higher-dimensional quantum systems can 
potentially provide richer quantum information and more robust entanglement.
4. Multiparty Quantum Teleportation [0]: : Beyond the traditional two-party 
setup, quantum teleportation can be extended to multiple parties. This 
development could involve numerous participants each transmitting information 
through a shared multipartite entangled state.
5. Teleportation of an Arbitrary Two-Qubit State [75]: : This work expands the 
scope of quantum teleportation to two-qubit states, linking this to multipartite 
entanglement. The insights provided enhance the understanding of complex 
quantum information transfer and potential improvements in telep ortation 
protocols.
6. Continuous-Variable Quantum Teleportation [44]: : This variation uses 
continuous-variable systems, such as the position and momentum of a particle. 
As these systems can assume any value within a certain range, this approach 
often involves quantum states of light and can potentially provide higher 
fidelity in teleportation.

10.4 Entanglement Swapping 
260
10.4 Entanglement Swapping
Entanglement swapping, also known as quantum relay, is a fundamental procedure 
in quantum information science that allows two quantum systems to become en­
tangled without direct interaction, purely through the use of entanglement and 
local operations. It plays an instrumental role in quantum repeaters and quantum 
networks, enhancing secure long-distance communication and creating a web of 
quantum devices.
Entanglement swapping is a powerful technique in overcoming the physical 
limitations inherent in creating direct entanglement between distant particles. En­
tanglement is typically established by allowing two quantum systems to interact 
directly. However, as the distance between the two systems grows, the feasibility of 
this interaction rapidly diminishes due to environmental interference. Entanglement 
swapping breaks down the barrier of distance, allowing quantum systems to become 
entangled without the necessity for direct interaction.
Understanding entanglement swapping is essential for those delving into the field 
of quantum networking and quantum cryptography. Its concept, combined with 
other quantum protocols such as quantum teleportation, enables the creation of 
secure and efficient quantum communication systems. In this section, we aim to shed 
light on the intricacies of entanglement swapping and its pivotal role in quantum 
information science.
10.4.1 Introduction
Entanglement swapping is a procedure that leads to the entanglement of two quantum 
systems that have never interacted before. It is executed through a sequence of steps 
as outlined in Fig. 10.7.
1. Initial Entanglement: Two pairs of entangled quantum states are created, 
typically qubits in a Bell state. The first pair is shared between Alice and a 
mediator (Charlie), and the second pair is shared between Charlie and Bob.
2. Bell Measurement: Charlie conducts a Bell measurement on his two qubits 
from the entangled pairs, collapsing these qubits into one of four Bell states.
3. Classical Communication: Charlie communicates the outcomes of his measure­
ment to Bob via a classical communication channel.
4. State Reconstruction: Upon receiving Charlie’s measurement result, Bob 
performs certain quantum operations on his qubit depending on the result. 
This step results in Alice’s and Bob’s qubits becoming entangled, thereby 
completing the entanglement swapping process.
In our example, the state reconstruction is done on Bob’s qubit. Depending on 
the specific requirements of the quantum operation or communication, the state 
reconstruction can be performed on Alice’s qubit, Bob’s, or both. The choice of 
where to perform the state reconstruction can have implications for the efficiency, 
security, and other characteristics of these quantum protocols.

10.4.2 * Step-by-Step Analysis
Let’s delve into the entanglement swapping protocol by going through each step. 
This process involves creating entanglement between two qubits without direct 
interaction, utilizing local operations, and classical communication.

10.4 Entanglement Swapping
262
1 
Initial Entanglement
Consider two entangled pairs of qubits: Alice’s pair A consisting of qubits a1 and 
a2 , and Bob’s pair B consisting of qubits b1 and b2. These pairs can be in any 
entangled state, but for simplicity, we’ll consider them to be in the Bell state 
l*+> = v2 (|oo> + |n»-
The initial state vector of the system can be written as:
|^0 ) a 1 a 2 b 1 b 2 = Ma 1 a2 ® Mb 1 b2 
(10.24a)
= — (|00> + |11» ® -12 (|00> + |11» 
(10.24b)
= 1 (|0000> + |0011> + |1100> + |1111» . 
(10.24c)
For the purpose of the entanglement swapping protocol, we will treat a2 and b1 
as one group, and a1 and b2 as another. This grouping aligns with the steps of the 
protocol, where a2 and b1 are sent to Charlie for a Bell measurement, while a1 and 
b2 become the final entangled pair. To reflect this in our notation, we will rearrange 
the order of the qubits in our state vector representation. Note that this is merely a 
mathematical adjustment and does not involve any physical changes to the qubits. 
In the new representation, the state vector is:
|*0 >a2b 1 a 1 b2 = 2 (|0000> + |0101> + |1010> + |1111» . 
(10.25)
2 
Bell Measurement
Alice and Bob each send one qubit, a2 and b1 respectively, to Charlie. Upon receiving 
the qubits a2 and b1 , Charlie performs a Bell measurement. This measurement 
process is achieved by first applying a CNOT gate with a2 as the control qubit and 
b1 as the target, followed by a Hadamard gate on a2 . This transforms the two-qubit 
state into a superposition of the Bell states. Subsequently, Charlie measures both 
qubits in the computational basis. For simplicity in this analysis, we treat Charlie’s 
CNOT gate, Hadamard gate, and measurement devices as a single unit, which we 
refer to as the Bell-measurement unit.
The Bell measurement projects the two-qubit state onto one of the Bell states 
|ffij). The measurement operators are:
Mij = |Pij XPij |a2b 1 ® Ia 1 b2 . 
(10.26)
After the measurement, depending on the result, the system will be in one of the 
following states:
|*1)ij = Mij |*0>a2b 1 a 1 b2 . 
(10.27)
The result of this equation has the following form:
|*0
ij = |Pij )a2b 1 ®|^)a 1 b2 . 
(10.28)
After some algebraic manipulation, we obtain |^) a 1 b2 as in the following table:

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
263
Outcome ij
State of a2 and b 1 (| flij } a 2 b 1 )

72 (|00>-|11»
11
|fl 11) = |^-) = 72 (|01)-|10»
72 (|01)-|10»
Examining the above table, we discover that after the measurement with outcome 
ij, qubits a 1 and b2 are also in the Bell state |flij)! This relationship, which is the 
heart of entanglement swapping, is captured by the following equation:
|^1)ij = |flij]a2b 1 ® |flij]a 1 b2 ■
(10.29)
3 
Classical Communication
Even though qubits a 1 and b2 are in the Bell state | flij), the measurement outcome 
ij appears randomly, limiting the usefulness of the entanglement. Next, Charlie 
transmits the measurement outcomes ij to Bob through a classical communication 
channel for him to make corrections to the Bell state.
4 
State Reconstruction
To transform the state of qubits a 1 and b2 from |flij) to |^2) = |fl00), Bob applies 
the necessary correction gates to his qubit b2 according to the two bits ij from 
Charlie’s measurements: an X gate when j = 1 and a Z gate when i = 1.

When Charlie measures qubits a2 and b 1 in the Bell basis {flij}, each of the 
Bell states occurs with equal probability. If he obtains |flij) (where i, j e {0, 1}), 
the state of the system collapses to | flij) ® | flij), and qubits a 1 and b2 also take

on the state |ffij). They can then be adjusted based on the measurement results 
(i,j) to reconstruct the original entangled state |000).
10.4.3 * Further Exploration
The concept of entanglement swapping, similar to quantum teleportation, can be 
extended beyond the basic protocol outlined in this text. Numerous variations 
and enhancements focus on the nature and dimensionality of the quantum states 
used, the number of parties involved, and the types of operations executed on the 
states. For those interested in deepening their understanding, the following topics 
are suggested for further exploration:
1. Quantum Repeaters with Entanglement Swapping [30]: Explores the use of 
entanglement swapping in quantum communication infrastructure. Quantum 
repeaters help overcome distance limitations in quantum communication by 
using entanglement swapping to establish entanglement between distant parties.
2. Multi-party Entanglement Swapping [94]: Involves more than two parties, 
with multiple mediators performing Bell measurements and classical com­
munications. This potentially enables large-scale quantum networks with 
distributed entanglement.
3. Higher-dimensional Entanglement Swapping [25]: Extends entanglement 
swapping from qubits to qudits, or higher-dimensional quantum systems. This 
extension can potentially enhance quantum information capacity and the 
robustness of entanglement.
4. Entanglement Swapping with Mixed States [63]: While most entanglement 
swapping schemes use pure entangled states, variations that incorporate mixed 
states exist. These protocols, though more complex, may be more practical 
as mixed states are commonly encountered in real quantum systems due to 
decoherence and noise.
5. Entanglement Swapping in Various Systems [95]: This research explores 
entanglement swapping in pure and noisy systems, analyzing the relationship 
between initial and final state entanglement using metrics like concurrence 
and negativity. The study reveals that the initial state’s entanglement can 
influence the final state’s average entanglement, with measurement bases and 
entanglement intensity playing critical roles.
10.5 Quantum Gate Teleportation
Quantum gate teleportation refers to the process of performing a quantum operation 
(a quantum gate) on one or more qubits that are not locally accessible, leveraging 
the properties of entanglement and quantum teleportation.
Quantum gate teleportation can be viewed as entanglement-assisted computation, 
in contrast to the concept of entanglement-assisted communication found in standard 
quantum teleportation. The primary aim is to perform a computational operation 
during the teleportation process itself.
Quantum gate teleportation is particularly beneficial in scenarios where direct 
manipulation of the qubit could lead to decoherence or when the qubits are spatially 

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
265
separated. It can also enable the realization of distributed quantum computing, 
where quantum gates can be performed on qubits located in different quantum 
computers, thus enabling more extensive and powerful quantum networks.
10.5.1 * Single-Qubit Gate Teleportation
We will first consider single-qubit gate teleportation, where the goal is to apply a 
single-qubit unitary operation U to a quantum state |^) during teleportation.
Figure 10.9: Basic Process of Quantum Gate Teleportation
Single-qubit gate teleportation follows a process similar to standard quantum 
teleportation, encompassing four main steps, as shown in Fig. 10.9. Instead of using 
the standard Bell state |$+), Alice and Bob begin with the shared state (I ® U) |$+), 
in which the unitary operation U is applied to Bob’s part of the entangled pair. 
After Alice sends her measurement results, Bob performs correction operations, 
much like in standard teleportation, albeit with adjusted correction gates. The final 
state he obtains is U |^) instead of simply |^). This modification ensures that the 
teleportation procedure not only conveys the state |^) but also effectively applies 
the operation U to |^), resulting in the final state U |^) on Bob’s end.
Figure 10.10 presents a quantum circuit for single-qubit gate teleportation that 
aligns with this procedure. We’ll delve into this circuit in detail shortly.
1 Transition from Standard to Gate Teleportation
Let’s now explore an intuitive connection between single-qubit gate teleportation and 
standard quantum teleportation. This exploration offers insight into the discovery 
process of protocols like gate teleportation. It also lays a foundation for understanding 
more complex protocols, such as CNOT gate teleportation, which we’ll discuss later.
Refer to Fig. 10.11. The segment prior to the dashed visual separator is the 
standard teleportation circuit from Fig. 10.5. At this circuit’s output, the third 
(bottom) qubit is in state |^). Upon application of a unitary gate U, the qubit’s 
state becomes U |^). This final state mirrors that of single-qubit gate teleportation, 
wherein gate U is applied to the teleported |^) (as depicted in Fig. 10.10).

To transform the circuit in Fig. 10.11 into the gate teleportation circuit as 
shown in Fig. 10.10, we need to shift the gate U to the left of the controlled-Z 
and controlled-X gates. This transformation is facilitated by the concept of gate 
sequence equivalence, which is demonstrated in the following table:
Gate Sequence Equivalent Seq. Operator Equivalence
This concept of gate sequence equivalence clarifies the transformation of the 
correction gates from X and Z to XU = UXUt and ZU = UZUt respectively in 
Fig. 10.10.
i Although quantum circuit diagrams apply gates from left to right, the corre­
sponding operator (matrix) multiplication operates in reverse order, from right to 
left.
Standard versus Gate Teleportation: Summary
In quantum teleportation, Alice and Bob share an entangled Bell state, |$+), 
allowing Alice to teleport an unknown state |^) to Bob. This is achieved by 
Alice measuring her qubits in the Bell basis, resulting in one of four possible 
outcomes which, on Bob’s end, manifest as states |^), X |^), Z |^), or ZX |^). 
Bob corrects his state to |^) by applying the corresponding Pauli operator, I, 
X, Z, or XZ, informed by Alice’s classical measurement.

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
267
Quantum gate teleportation extends this concept by teleporting a single-qubit 
gate U. Here, Alice and Bob share (I ® U) |$+) instead. The teleportation 
procedure leaves Bob with one of four states: U |^), UX |^), UZ |^), or UZX |^). 
Bob then corrects his state to U |^) by applying the corresponding operator, I, 
UXUt, UZUt, or UXZUt, depending on Alice’s classical measurement.
Quantum teleportation is equivalent to quantum gate teleportation with 
U = I.
2 * Step-by-Step Analysis
While we’ve successfully derived the gate teleportation circuit by modifying the 
standard teleportation circuit, it’s worthwhile to conduct a detailed, step-by-step 
examination of the gate teleportation process. This will serve to reinforce our 
understanding. Think of single-qubit gate teleportation as an extension of the Bell 
measurement approach to quantum teleportation, which we discussed in § 10.3.4. 
The equations that follow will closely mirror those found in the aforementioned 
section.
1. Initial State
Alice wants to send a quantum state |^) = a |0) + P |1) to Bob, and have the state 
transformed by gate U during the process.
Alice and Bob share the state (I ® U) |$+), where U has been applied to Bob’s 
part of the entangled pair. The initial state vector of the system can be written as:
|^o) = -2(a 0 + P |1» ® (I ® U)(|00> + |11» 
(10.31a)
= -12(a 0 + P |1» ® (|0> U 0 + |1) U |1» 
(10.31b)
= -=(a |00> + P 110»U |0) + -=(a |01> + P |11»U |1). 
(10.31c)
Here in the last step, we have singled out the 3rd qubit since we are going to
measure the first two qubit in the next step.
2. Bell Measurement
Alice applies a CNOT gate with her qubit as the control and the entangled qubit as 
the target. Then she applies a Hadamard gate to her qubit. Finally, she measures 
the two qubits, effectively performing a Bell measurement on them.
The four Bell states form an orthonormal basis for two-qubit states. By perform­
ing Bell measurements, Alice projects the two-qubit states onto the Bell states.
The measurement operators, for the overall system of three qubits, are given by:
Mij = |PijHPij | ® I, 
(10.32)
where i, j e {0, 1}, and Pij are the Bell states.
After the measurement, depending on the measurement results, the system will 
be at one of the following states:

3. Classical communication
Alice transmits the measurement outcomes ij , representing two bits of information, 
to Bob through a classical communication channel.
4. State Reconstruction
Based on the two bits ij resulting from Alice’s measurements, Bob will apply the 
necessary correction gates to his qubit as shown in the following table.

Consider the case where ij = 01. Bob’s initial state is UX |^), and we aim 
for it to become U |^) after correction. This is achieved by applying UXUt, as 
UXUtUX |^} = UXX |^} = U |^), given X2 = I.
After correction, Bob’s qubit resides in state U |^). This illustrates gate tele­
portation, where the gate U effect is transferred to Bob’s qubit without direct 
application to |^).
Exercise 10.4 In quantum gate teleportation, the U gate is typically applied before 
the Bell measurement step. However, since the U gate is applied to a different 
qubit from those involved in the Bell measurement, its application can be delayed 
until after the measurement. This modified sequence of operations is illustrated 
in Fig. 10.12. To confirm this modification is valid, repeat the analysis as done 
above for the regular sequence of operations.

Quantum Gate Teleportation: Core Summary
The initial state vector can be decomposed into the orthonormal Bell basis as 
follows:
|*o)  = ^^2(a 0 + P |1» ® (I ® U)(|00> + 111»,
= 2 E IPij>® U |^ij), 
(10.34)
where |Pj) represents the Bell states, and |■fij) is defined in Table 10.2 
and Eq. 10.22a.
When Alice measures the first two qubits in the Bell basis {Pij}, each of the 
Bell states occurs with equal probability. If she obtains |Pj) (where i, j e {0, 1}), 
the state of the system collapses to | Pj) ® U | •fij), and the third qubit takes on 
the state U |^j). It can then be adjusted based on Alice’s measurement results 
(i, j) to reconstruct the state U(a 0 + P |1)).
3 * Teleportation of Single-Qubit Gates in the Clifford Group
You might wonder why we would teleport a gate U if the correction gates UXU^ 
and UZU^ also contain U. It might seem more straightforward to teleport |^) and 
then directly apply U . However, the process becomes simplified when U belongs to 
the Clifford group.
By definition, a single-qubit Clifford gate maps any Pauli operator to another 
Pauli operator under conjugation (up to a phase). This means that if U is in the 
Clifford group, UPU^ is a Pauli operator for any Pauli operator P.
There are 24 single-qubit Clifford gates, including I, X , Y , Z , H, HX, HY , 
HZ, S, SX, SY , SZ, and others. Because of their properties under conjugation, 
Clifford group gates simplify the process of quantum gate teleportation.
Beyond this, the Clifford group also plays a crucial role in error correction within 
quantum computing. The examples below illustrate how teleportation is streamlined

10.5 Quantum Gate Teleportation
270
when the gate to be teleported belongs to the Clifford group.
X Gate Teleportation
If we choose U = X as the teleportation gate, we find that the properties of the 
X gate allow us to simplify the correction gates to basic Pauli matrices. This is 
due to the transformation properties of the X gate: UXUt = XXXt = X and 
UZUt = XZXt = — Z. In essence, these correction gates are the same as those 
used in standard quantum teleportation, as detailed in § 10.3.4.4, albeit with an 
additional global phase factor.

The Hadamard gate (H) is one of the single-qubit Clifford gates. With U = H,

The S gate, also known as the phase gate, is a member of the Clifford group. With

gates become simple Pauli matrices as in the following table.

T Gate Teleportation
The T gate, also known as the n/8 gate, given by T = SS, is not a Clifford gate. It 
doesn’t map Pauli matrices to Pauli matrices under conjugation. Therefore, in the 
case of U = T, the correction gates won’t simplify to single Pauli gates. Instead, we 
need to use the full form TXTt, TZTt , and TXZTt . However, these compensations 

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement
271
can be simpler to implement than the T gate itself. This property forms the basis 
for constructing fault-tolerant T gates.
Exercise 10.5 Find the correction gates for the teleportation of the Pauli Y gate 
and Z gate.
10.5.2 * Teleportation of Two-Qubit Gates
The gate teleportation process can be extended to include two-qubit unitary gates, 
such as the CNOT gate, or a combination of single and two-qubit gates, such as a 
Bell state generator. In this section, we explore two variations of two-qubit gate 
teleportation schemes: teleportation of one two-qubit gate and one qubit, which we 
refer to as 2-1; and teleportation of one two-qubit gate and two qubits, which we 
refer to as 2-2.
1 2-1 Gate Teleportation
Figure 10.13: Basic Process of 2-1 Gate Teleportation
The 2-1 gate teleportation process is depicted in the diagram shown in Fig. 10.13 
and in the quantum circuit in Fig. 10.14.
In this scenario, Alice has a qubit |^) that she wants to teleport to Bob. Charlie 
has a two-qubit gate U and another qubit |$}. On Bob’s end, we aim for him to 
have U(|^® |$)) without directly accessing |^) or U.
To achieve this, Charlie prepares a Bell pair with qubits A and B . He sends 
qubit A to Alice. Alice performs a Bell measurement on |^) and qubit A, and sends 
the measurement results (two classical bits) to Bob via classical communication 
channel. Charlie also applies U to qubit B and | $), and sends both to Bob. Upon 
receiving the measurement results, Bob applies the appropriate correction gates to 
the qubits he received from Charlie, and successfully recovers U(|^® |$}).

The segment prior to the dashed visual separator is the standard teleportation 
circuit from Fig. 10.5. At this circuit’s output, the third qubit is in state |^). 
Upon application of a unitary gate U on both | ^) and | $), the final state becomes 
U(|^) ® |$}). This final state mirrors that of 2-1 gate teleportation in Fig. 10.14.
To transform the circuit in Fig. 10.15 into the gate teleportation circuit as 
shown in Fig. 10.14, we need to shift the gate U to the left of the controlled-Z and 
controlled-X gates. This transformation is facilitated the following gate sequence 
equivalence, similar to the single-qubit gate teleportation scenario:
U(X ® I) = U(X ® I)(UfU) = (U(X ® I)Uf)U = XuU, 
(10.35a)
U(Z ® I) = U(Z ® I)(UfU) = (U(Z ® I)Uf)U = ZuU, 
(10.35b)
where XU = U(X ® I)U^ and ZU = U(Z ® I)Ut. This explains the correction gates 
XU and ZU in Fig. 10.14.
Although quantum circuit diagrams apply gates from left to right, the correspond­
ing operator multiplication operates in reverse order, from right to left.

The initial state vector can be decomposed into the orthonormal Bell basis as 
follows:

where |ffij) represents the Bell states, and |■fij) is defined in Table 10.2 
and Eq. 10.22a.
When Alice measures the first two qubits in the Bell basis {flj}, each of the 
Bell states occurs with equal probability. If she obtains |0j) (where i, j e {0,1}), 
the state of the system collapses to |ffij) ® U(|^j) ® |$}), and the third and 
fourth qubits take on the state U(|^ij) ® |$}). It can then be adjusted based on 
Alice’s measurement results (i, j) to reconstruct the state U(|^) ® |$}).
2. CNOT Gate Teleportation
You may question the necessity of teleporting a gate U when the correction gates, 
such as U(X ® I)U*, already contain U. It might appear more logical to teleport 
|^) first and then apply U directly. However, the procedure may be simplified when 
U is a specific two-qubit gate. In this section, we’ll consider the CNOT gate as U.
For U = CNOT, it can be demonstrated through matrix multiplication (or 
through logic operation analysis - see next section) that
Xu = U(X ® I)U* = X ® X, 
(10.37a)
Zu = U(Z ® I)U* = Z ® I. 
(10.37b)
Therefore, for U = CNOT, Fig. 10.14 simplifies to Fig. 10.16, in which the 
correction gates do not involve CNOT, achieving its true teleportation.
Exercise 10.6 Verify Eq. 10.37 for U = CNOT through multiplication of the 
matrices of CNOT, X, and Z.
Exercise 10.7 Following the procedure for the derivation of the CNOT teleporta­
tion circuit in Fig. 10.16, design a practical circuit for the teleportation of CNOT 
with the last qubit (i.e., |$)) as its control.
2 2-2 Gate Teleportation
Now we examine the teleportation of two qubits, |^) and |^), along with a two-qubit 
gate U. This operation is depicted in the diagram shown in Fig. 10.17 and quantum

circuit in Fig. 10.18. In this scenario, Daniel prepares two Bell pairs: Pair A consists 
of qubits a1 and a2 , and Pair B consists of b1 and b2 . He sends a1 from Pair A to 
Alice, and b2 from Pair B to Bob. He then applies a two-qubit gate U to a2 and b1 , 
and sends them to Charlie.
Alice and Bob each possess an additional qubit, c1 and c2 , respectively, each in 
states | ^) and | $}. Their goal is to teleport these qubits while applying the U gate 
to them.
To accomplish this, Alice performs a Bell measurement on qubits c1 and a1 , while 
Bob does the same for c2 and b2 . They then transmit their respective measurement 
results to Charlie via a classical communication channel.
Upon receiving the measurement results, Charlie applies the appropriate correc­
tion gates to qubits a2 and b1 .
At the end of this process, Charlie is left with qubits a2 and b1 in the state 
U |^) |$}. This indicates that the states |^) and |$) have been teleported with 
the U gate applied to them. This sequence of operations effectively teleports the 
application of a U gate between two qubits originating from different locations.
1. Transition from Standard Teleportation
Similar to the illustration of transition from standard teleportation to single-qubit 
gate teleportation in § 10.5.1.1, let’s do the same for two-qubit gate teleportation.
In Fig. 10.19, the segment prior to the dashed visual separator are two standard 
teleportation circuits in parallel, from Fig. 10.5. At the output, the qubits a2 and b1 
are in the states |^) and |$), respectively. Upon application of a U gate, the qubit’s 
state becomes U | ^) | $}. This final state mirrors that of intended gate teleportation, 
wherein a U gate is applied to the teleported |^) and |^) (as depicted in Fig. 10.18).
To transform the circuit in Fig. 10.19 into the gate teleportation circuit as 
shown in Fig. 10.18, we need to shift the gate U to the left of the controlled-Z 
and controlled-X gates. This transformation is facilitated by the concept of gate 
sequence equivalence, which is demonstrated in the following table:
Here X 1 = X ® I, Z 1 = Z ® I, X2 = I ® X, and Z2 = I ® Z. (For example, X2 
represents the operator ofan X gate acting on the second qubit.) This concept of gate

sequence equivalence underlies the definition of the correction gates X 1 U = UX 1 Ut, 
Z 1 U = UZ 1 Ut, X2U = UX2Ut, and Z2U = UZ2Ut in Fig. 10.18.
2. CNOT Gate Teleportation
For the CNOT gate, the correction gates can be simplified. We can take advantage 
of the gate sequence equivalence shown in Table 10.6. For a detailed discussion of 
these sequences, see § 7.4.3. As you’ll notice, in this scenario, the U correction gates 
are simplified to an additional X gate and Z gate, beyond the original four.
With the equivalent gate sequences in table Table 10.6, we have finally arrived 
at the quantum circuit for CNOT gate teleportation in Fig. 10.20. The two extra 
gates due to gate sequence equivalence 2 and 3 are highlighted with shading. This is 
a highly practical circuit as the correction gates no longer involve U directly.

10.5.3 * Further Exploration
The concept of quantum gate teleportation extends beyond the basic protocol 
discussed in this text. For those seeking to deepen their understanding, the following 
topics are suggested for further exploration:
1. Generalized Quantum Gate Teleportation [46]: This work introduces a method 
for creating a variety of quantum gates by teleporting qubits through specific 
entangled states. It delves deep into the theoretical framework and outlines 
potential applications, notably emphasizing a quantum computer model that 
employs single qubit operations, Bell measurements, and GHZ states.
2. Experimental Teleportation of a Quantum Controlled-NOT Gate [56]: This 
paper presents an empirical study where a CNOT gate is teleported. The 
experimental approach and the resulting observations offer valuable insights 
into the practical implications and challenges of gate teleportation.
3. Optimal Scheme for Teleportation of an n-qubit Quantum State [82]: This 
research introduces a quantum circuit tailored for teleporting an n-qubit 
quantum state. The scheme is noted for its optimization in terms of quantum 
resource utilization.

4. Teleportation of a Quantum Gate Between Two Logical Qubits [36]: A 
seminal piece that experimentally demonstrates the teleportation of a CNOT 
gate between two logical qubits. The research employs real-time adaptive 
control, making the teleportation deterministic. Additionally, it underscores 
the significance of error-correctable encoding for maintaining high process 
fidelity.
5. Fault-Tolerant Universal Quantum Gate Operations [74]: This paper pro­
vides a detailed account of fault-tolerant universal gate operations on logical 
qubits within a trapped-ion quantum computer. The research showcases the 
advantages of the “flag fault tolerance” paradigm and culminates in a demon­
stration of a fault-tolerant logical T gate. The findings pave the way for further 
advancements in error-corrected universal quantum computation.
6. Enhanced Quantum Teleportation with Logical States [60]: This recent 
paper proposes a novel approach to quantum teleportation, focusing on the 
transmission of multi-qubit physical states into error correctable multi-qubit 
logical states. The work also touches upon an efficient quantum error correction 
scheme, highlighting its potential in future fault-tolerant quantum technologies.
10.6 E91 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol
In cryptography, encryption entails the transformation of information (plaintext) 

10.6 E91 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol

into a format only accessible by intended recipients through a shared secret key. The 
security hinges on the secure distribution of this key. Conventionally, transmitting 
messages through classical channels leaves them vulnerable to undetected eavesdrop­
ping. Quantum mechanics offers an alternative, providing the ability to transmit 
messages while detecting any eavesdropping.
In 1984, Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard introduced the BB84 protocol 
which utilized four quantum states across two bases. Here, Alice sent particles in 
one of the four states, and Bob randomly selected bases to measure them. (The 
BB84 protocol is detailed in § 5.5.)
Building on BB84, Artur Ekert proposed the E91 Quantum Key Distribution 
(QKD) protocol in 1991. This protocol employs quantum entanglement, local 
operations, and classical communication channels to securely exchange cryptographic 
keys, with applications in secure communication and quantum-secured networks. A 
distinctive feature of the E91 QKD protocol is its intrinsic security, as any attempt 
to intercept the entangled photons alters their quantum states, leading to detectable 
anomalies in the shared key. Consequently, Alice and Bob can identify and discard 
compromised keys due to eavesdropping.
10.6.1 Procedure of the E91 QKD Protocol
The E91 QKD protocol encompasses five primary steps, as depicted in Fig. 10.21. 
We will explain these steps in detail next.
1 
Bell Pair Generation and Distribution
A Bell pair source generates pairs of entangled qubits, typically in the Bell state 
|^-). One qubit from each pair is sent to Alice, and the other to Bob.
In the E91 protocol, unlike BB84 where Alice sends qubits to Bob, a central 
source creates and distributes the entangled qubits. This configuration is considered 
more practical for real-world implementations, especially over long distances, where a 
central source such as a satellite can distribute entangled qubits to multiple receivers.
2 
Measurement
Upon receiving the qubits, Alice and Bob independently and randomly choose one 
of three predetermined measurement bases to measure their respective qubits.
The three bases for Alice are:
• a 1 corresponds to measuring in the Z basis (0° on the Bloch sphere).
• a2 corresponds to measuring in a basis that is 45° rotated from the Z basis on 
the Bloch sphere, often denoted as W = 12 (Z + X).
• a3 corresponds to measuring in the X basis (90° on the Bloch sphere).
For Bob:
• b1 corresponds to measuring in the W basis (45° on the Bloch sphere).
• b2 corresponds to measuring in the X basis (90° on the Bloch sphere).
• b3 corresponds to measuring in a basis that is 135° rotated from the Z basis 
on the Bloch sphere, often denoted as V = 12 (Z — X).

Figure 10.21: Basic E91 QKD Protocol
The BB84 QKD protocol utilizes four measurement settings, two for each par­
ticipant, while the E91 protocol uses six, with three for each participant. The 
additional settings in E91 facilitate eavesdropper detection through Bell inequality 
tests, minimizing the need to reveal key information during the process. This will 
become clear after we examine the subsequent steps.
For spin-1/2 systems, the angles on the Bloch sphere equal to the angles of the 
physical orientation of the Stern-Gerlach apparatus. For photon polarization, 
however, the physical angles of the polarizers are half the angles on the Bloch 
Sphere, that is, for Alice a 1 corresponds to 0°, a2 22.5°, and a3 45°; and for Bob, 
b 1 22.5°, b2 45°, and b3 67.5°.
3 
Basis Announcement
After the measurements, Alice and Bob announce the bases they used for each 
measurement over a public classical channel. They do not disclose their measurement 
results at this stage.

10.6 E91 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol 
280
4 
Key Sifting
Using the announced bases, Alice and Bob independently sift their data to retain 
only the measurement results performed in pairs of compatible bases (a2 , b1 and 
a3 , b2). For these pairs, the measurement results of Alice and Bob are anticorrelated 
when measuring an entangled state; i.e., if Alice obtains a result of 1, Bob obtains a 
result of 0, and vice versa (one of them must invert their measurement results).
They retain the results measured with compatible bases as a sifted key. These 
are indicated in the “Used for Key” column in the table of Fig. 10.21.
5 
Eavesdropping Check
Alice and Bob use a subset of their measurement results to perform a Bell’s inequality 
test, designed to detect potential eavesdropping.
The subset includes results from bases a1 , a3, b1 , and b3, i.e., excluding the 
results from a2 and b2 . These are indicated in the “Used for Checking” column in 
the table of Fig. 10.21.
The specific choice of angles for the bases a 1, a3, b 1, and b3 is designed to maximize 
the value of the Bell CHSH quantity, which reaches | S| = 2%/2 for maximally 
entangled states. Normally, without eavesdropping, the measured photons are in 
a Bell state and |S| = 2\/2. However, if an eavesdropper has tampered with the 
qubits, then |S| < 2^2.
By comparing a portion of their measurement results (announced over a classical 
channel), Alice and Bob can identify any violations of Bell’s inequality. If the 
violations exceed the quantum limit, they conclude that eavesdropping has occurred, 
and the generated key is unsafe.
6 
Key Generation
If the channel is deemed secure following the eavesdropping check, Alice and Bob use 
the remaining sifted key data from the compatible bases for secure communication. 
They can also apply error correction and privacy amplification techniques to enhance 
the security of this key.
10.6.2 Comparison to the BB84 Protocol
Both the E91 and BB84 protocols are Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols 
that aim to establish a secure key between two parties, typically referred to as Alice 
and Bob. Despite their shared goal, the two protocols differ significantly in their 
mechanisms and practical implications. (We have explored the BB84 protocol in 
§ 5.5.)
1 
Basis of Security
• The E91 protocol is rooted in quantum entanglement and Bell’s inequalities. 
Alice and Bob each receive one of an entangled pair of qubits. The quantum 
correlations between measurements on these entangled pairs are exploited to 
detect the presence of an eavesdropper.
• The BB84 protocol is based on Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle. An eaves­
dropper (Eve) cannot measure the quantum states sent by Alice without 

Chapter 10. Key Applications of Entanglement 
281
causing a disturbance. This disturbance can be detected by Alice and Bob 
during the error-checking phase.
2 
Detection of Eavesdropping
• In E91, eavesdropping is detected by a decrease in the correlation between 
Alice’s and Bob’s measurement outcomes, indicating a violation of Bell’s 
inequalities. This can be observed without any further communication between 
Alice and Bob beyond sharing their measurement results.
• In BB84, Alice and Bob detect eavesdropping by comparing a subset of their 
key bits. If Eve tries to measure the qubits, she introduces errors because of 
the uncertainty principle, which Alice and Bob can detect.
3 
Number of Bases Used
• The E91 protocol uses three bases for encoding and measuring qubits. Alice 
and Bob randomly select one of the three bases to measure their qubits for 
each run.
• The BB84 protocol utilizes two non-commuting bases for encoding and mea­
suring qubits. Alice randomly selects one of these bases to encode each bit of 
the key, and Bob randomly selects one of the bases to measure each bit.
4 
Practicality for Real-world Applications
• The E91 protocol, with its reliance on entangled pairs of qubits, can be techno­
logically challenging to implement, especially in terms of creating, maintaining, 
and transmitting entangled qubits over long distances. Additionally, the re­
quirement to measure in three different bases may add to the complexity. 
However, in scenarios where a trusted source can distribute entangled photons, 
such as satellite-based quantum communication, E91 can have advantages in 
terms of security and efficiency for long-distance quantum key distribution.
• The BB84 protocol is often considered more practical for short-distance real- 
world applications as it requires only the preparation and transmission of single 
qubits and the capability to measure in two bases. These tasks are relatively 
easier to achieve with current technology, making BB84 more straightforward 
for implementation. However, the protocol necessitates a more interactive 
communication process between Alice and Bob to detect eavesdropping, which 
can be a limitation in certain scenarios.
10.6.3 * Further Exploration
The concept of the E91 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol, as well as its basis in 
entanglement and the broader context of quantum cryptography, extends beyond the 
basic protocol discussed in this text. For those seeking to deepen their understanding 
of the E91 protocol, its foundations, and its comparisons with other quantum 
cryptographic schemes, the following are suggested for further exploration:
1. Quantum Cryptography Based on Bell’s Theorem [39]: This is the original 
paper by Artur Ekert, in which he introduced the E91 protocol. It lays the 
foundation for Quantum Key Distribution based on entanglement and Bell’s 
inequalities.

2. Quantum Key Distribution Network for Multiple Applications [78]: This 
paper discusses the implementation of a quantum key distribution network 
where different protocols, including E91, are employed for various applications. 
It demonstrates the flexibility and real-world utility of the E91 protocol in a 
network setting.
3. Experimental Demonstration of a Measurement-Device-Independent Quan­
tum Key Distribution [76]: This paper introduces and demonstrates an 
experimental implementation of measurement-device-independent quantum 
key distribution, which can be seen as an advancement over the E91 protocol, 
by removing the need to trust the measurement devices.
4. Quantum Cryptography: Public Key Distribution and Coin Tossing [21]: 
Though primarily centered around the introduction of the BB84 protocol, this 
seminal paper by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard also offers a basis 
for understanding the context in which the E91 protocol was developed.
5. Quantum Key Distribution in Cryptography: A Survey [13]: This article 
explores the integration of quantum key distribution (QKD) in cryptographic 
infrastructures. Highlighting QKD’s promise of information-theoretic security, 
the review underscores its application in renewing symmetric cipher keys 
and enabling secure key establishment in networks, while addressing inherent 
challenges and research avenues.
10.7 Summary and Conclusions
Entanglement in Applications
This chapter has taken readers on a comprehensive exploration of the myriad applica­
tions of quantum entanglement in quantum computing and quantum communication. 
Beginning with an overview of the essential role entanglement plays in these domains, 
we ventured into a systematic analysis of some of the key protocols that harness the 
power of entanglement.
Our journey began with the elucidation of superdense coding, an elegant method 
that demonstrated the efficacy of quantum communication. Transitioning from 
communication to computation, the concept of quantum teleportation showcased the 
unique capability of transmitting quantum states without the actual physical transfer 
of qubits, highlighting the distinction between classical and quantum paradigms.
Entanglement swapping, a nuanced yet fundamental process, further underscored 
the versatility of entanglement in establishing quantum connections over long dis­
tances. Such a technique is paramount in the construction of quantum networks, 
which will potentially revolutionize global communication in the quantum era.
We delved deeper into computation with the discussion of quantum gate telepor­
tation. This approach opens doors to distributed quantum computing, heralding a 
paradigm where quantum gates can be operationalized across spatially dispersed 
quantum systems.
Finally, we transitioned back into the realm of quantum communication with the 
E91 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol. Rooted in entanglement and the 
principles of quantum mechanics, this protocol emphasizes the enhanced security

quantum systems offer in the face of eavesdropping threats, distinguishing quantum 
cryptographic techniques from their classical counterparts.
Bridging Theory and Practice
Throughout this chapter, our approach has been two-pronged: we have grounded 
our discussions in the theoretical constructs of quantum mechanics while constantly 
alluding to their real-world implications. By doing so, we intend to foster an 
appreciation for both the abstract beauty of quantum phenomena and their tangible 
applications in next-generation technologies.
Entanglement, as a quintessential quantum resource, stands at the confluence of 
many quantum applications. Through the varied techniques and protocols discussed, 
we aim to have imparted a nuanced understanding of its potential and the avenues 
it opens up in quantum information science.
Upcoming Topics
Our subsequent chapter promises to immerse readers into the intricate world of 
quantum algorithms. We will juxtapose quantum algorithms against their classical 
counterparts, shedding light on the unique advantages and challenges they present. 
Starting with the pedagogical Deutch Jozsa algorithm, we will then transition into 
the realm of optimization with algorithms such as CUBO, QAOA, and VQE, which 
have immediate real-world applications. We will conclude the chapter with a dive 
into the Quantum Measurement Bomb, an algorithm that underscores the central 
role of measurements in quantum computing. As we venture into these topics, we 
will continually build on the foundational principles expounded in the previous 
chapters, reinforcing and expanding your quantum computing knowledge.

An algorithm generally refers to a defined set of instructions or procedures that a 
computer adheres to in order to solve a particular problem. When these algorithms 
are designed to run on quantum computers, they are termed quantum algorithms. 
The objective behind quantum algorithms often centers around executing calculations 
more efficiently than classical computers, or addressing computations that are 
practically infeasible for classical computers due to inherent physical limitations (e.g., 
execution time or memory capacity). In this text, we classify quantum algorithms 
into three primary categories: Foundational Quantum Algorithms, NISQ Hybrid 
Algorithms, and Innovative Quantum Algorithmic Concepts.

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
289
Quantum Utility Era
As of circa 2023, quantum computing is primarily operating with Noisy Intermediate­
Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. These devices, though limited in scale and afflicted 
by quantum noise, represent a critical transition phase. They possess computational 
capabilities that begin to exceed those achievable by classical computer simulations.
In this evolving landscape, we are entering the quantum utility era, a phase 
where quantum computing starts to yield substantial computational advantages for 
particular tasks. This marks the onset of quantum computing’s practical impact, 
as it begins to offer tangible solutions to real-world problems, despite the inherent 
challenges of quantum noise and device limitations.
Evolving Hybrid Algorithms
As quantum computing transitions from the NISQ era to the emerging era of quantum 
utility, quantum-classical hybrid algorithms are evolving to harness the strengths 
of both quantum and classical computing paradigms. These algorithms are pivotal 
for optimizing the performance of both NISQ devices, with their limited qubits 
and susceptibility to errors, and more advanced utility-scale quantum systems. By 
strategically integrating quantum computations with classical processes, these hybrid 
algorithms aim to enhance computational reliability and efficiency, adapting to the 
evolving capabilities of quantum hardware.
Foundational Quantum Algorithms
Historically, quantum algorithms that showcased the fundamental advantages of 
quantum over classical computation, such as Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms, were 
developed with the assumption of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers for 
their operation. Such algorithms, which exploit the superposition and entanglement 
properties of qubits, are termed Foundational Quantum Algorithms. These algo­
rithms serve as pivotal pedagogical tools and epitomize the profound possibilities of 
quantum computation.
Innovative Quantum Algorithmic Concepts
Beyond the established paradigms of NISQ and foundational algorithms lies a cat­
egory of innovative quantum algorithmic concepts. These include algorithms and 
ideas that may have been conceived in the early stages of quantum computing or 
represent novel approaches in the field. They extend the boundaries of quantum 
computational research, exploring new methodologies and challenging existing as­
sumptions. Among these are the Quantum Bomb Test Algorithm and Quantum 
Money, which offer insights into quantum measurements, probabilistic algorithms, 
and quantum cryptography.
Our Game Plan
In this chapter, we will explore representative quantum algorithms from each of the 
aforementioned categories:
Deutsch Jozsa Algorithm: A foundational quantum algorithm, it showcases 
the potential advantages of quantum computation. While its tangible real-world 
applications may be elusive, we will examine the intuition, working principles, and 
the generalization of this cornerstone algorithm.
CUBO, QAOA, VQE, AQC: As hallmarks of the NISQ era, these algorithms

have proven adept at addressing a myriad of optimization and quantum simulation 
challenges. Notably, this includes challenges solvable by quantum annealing devices. 
As a focal point, we will delve into the max-cut problem.
Quantum Measurement Bomb Algorithm and Quantum Money: Representing 
innovative quantum algorithmic concepts, these examples provide insights into 
various distinctive aspects such as quantum measurements, probabilistic algorithms, 
and quantum cryptography.
Through our exploration of these algorithms, we aim to provide readers with 
a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of quantum computing, 
tracing its past achievements, present capabilities, and future potential.
11.1
The Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
The Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm stands as one of the earliest and most elementary 
instances of a quantum algorithm. While it lacks direct practical applications, it 
exemplifies the potential advantage of quantum computing over classical computing 
in specific tasks.
11.1.1
Problem Statement
Consider a binary function f : {0, 1}n ^ {0, 1}, which takes an n-bit string input 
and returns a single bit as output. The function is guaranteed to have one of two 
behaviors:
1. Constant: f(x) is the same for all inputs; that is, either f(x) = 0 or f(x) = 1
for all x.
2. Balanced: For half of the possible inputs (not necessarily the first half), 
f(x) = 0, and for the other half, f(x) = 1.
The algorithm employs an oracle, a blackbox mechanism representing the function. 
One can query the oracle to understand the input-output relationship of the function, 
but the internal mechanics remain concealed. The objective of the algorithm is to 
determine with certainty whether the function is constant or balanced across its 
inputs.
In a theoretical context, the oracle is conceptualized as the black-box function 
input to the computation. The algorithm simply assumes its existence without 
concern for its internal structure. However, for pedagogical completeness, we 
provide a possible implementation of this oracle in § 11.1.5, which will aid readers 
in gaining a deeper understanding of the algorithm’s operation.

and n = 2.

constant or balanced necessitates a worst-case scenario of at least 2n-1 + 1 oracle

queries.
In contrast, the DJ algorithm showcases the power of quantum computing by 
achieving this differentiation with just a single oracle query, presenting an exponential 
speedup in comparison to its classical counterpart. This disparity in performance 
underscores the profound advantage introduced by quantum parallelism.

As shown in Fig. 11.1, the DJ algorithm involves the following procedure:
1. Initialize all qubits to |0).
2. Apply a Hadamard transform to create a superposition of all possible input 
states.
3. Query the phase oracle, introducing a phase (-1)f (x) to each state in the 
superposition.
4. Execute the second Hadamard transform.
5. Measure the qubits. A constant function always produces the state |000...0), 
while a balanced function results in any state except |000...0).
We will elaborate on the procedure of the DJ algorithm next. While the DJ 
algorithm might not possess direct practical applications, the strategies and principles 
elucidated here lay foundation for understanding of more sophisticated quantum 
algorithms, notably Simon’s, Shor’s, and Grover’s algorithms.

Here |^u) is a uniform superposition of the 2n basis states, from |000...0) to 1111... 1).
Exercise 11.2 Compute 
H |1). Is this also a uniform superposition of the
computational basis?

The Phase Oracle
In the context of our quantum circuit, querying the function f (x) necessitates its 
representation as a unitary transformation, capable of handling superposition states. 
An innovative realization of this unitary representation is termed the “phase oracle”, 
denoted by Uf . (A detailed account of the oracle’s implementation will be provided 
in § 11.1.5.)
Each potential input string for the function f (x) maps to a distinct basis state, 
| x), within the n-qubit system. The primary role of the phase oracle is to impart a 
phase shift of n to a given |x) if its corresponding f (x) = 1:
Uf |x} = (-1)f (x) |x}, for x e{0, 1}n. 
(11.3)
After applying the oracle, the state becomes:
|*2> = 7= E (—1)f(x) ।x>. 
(11.4)

-^= (|00...0) + i 111... 1)). Compute the output state.

Hadamard Transform and Measurement
In typical scenarios, one would express the state |^3) as a result of applying the second 
Hadamard transform to |^2). However, within the context of the DJ algorithm, 
articulating this explicitly is unnecessary. Our primary focus lies in discerning the 
probability associated with the measurement outcome of |000...0) in the state |^3).
The component |000...0) in |^3) originates from the uniform superposition of all 
basis states in |^2), denoted as |^u) in Eq. 11.2.
Therefore, the probability of obtaining the outcome |000...0) hinges on the overlap 
between states |^u) and |^2):
Po = | (* u|*2) |2. 
(11.5)
Upon inspection, we find that if f (x) is a constant function, the state |^2) retains 
its uniform superposition, leading to P0 = 1. Conversely, for a balanced function 
f (x), half the terms in |^2) carry a negative sign. This results in perfect destructive 
interference and consequently, P0 = 0. This distinction serves as the central insight 
behind the DJ algorithm.

11.1.4 * Generalized Deutsch-Josza Algorithm
In the traditional Deutsch-Josza (DJ) algorithm, measurement is performed against 
the |000...0) basis state to classify functions as either constant or balanced. Extending 
these measurements to encompass all computational basis states, however, provides 
deeper insights into the function’s periodicity. While this generalization aligns with 
the principles of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm mathematically, it also enhances 
our understanding of how the DJ algorithm connects to the broader concept of the 
Fourier transform. This extension not only broadens the scope of problems that 
can be tackled but also underscores the fundamental relationship between quantum 
computing algorithms and Fourier analysis.

Building Intuition
Each computational basis state can be associated with a unique periodic function. 
For elucidation, consider the Hadamard transform H4, illustrated in Table 11.1. 
Here, the basis state |0001) is tied to a function with a period of 2. Conversely, states 
|0010) and |0011) indicate functions with a period of 4, with |0011) introducing a 
phase shift distinct from the square wave of |0010). Similarly, states from |0100) 
through |0111) denote functions with a period of 8. Furthermore, these functions are 
orthogonal to each other. In fact, they serve as the basis functions of the Hadamard 
transform, analogous to the pure harmonics in the Fourier transform.

possible x values?

Problem and Solution
Quantum mechanics posits that orthogonal states can be distinctly identified through 
measurements. Inspired by this observation, we propose a more encompassing version

11.1 The Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm 
294
of the DJ algorithm:
Given a function in the basis function set of the 2n-dimensional Hadamard 
transform, f : {0, 1}n Z {0, 1}, mapping an n-bit string to a single-bit outcome, f 
is certain to display circular periodicity with periods spanning from 1 (for a constant 
function), through 2, 4, ..., 2i, ..., 2n. Our primary goal is to discern this periodicity.
While a classical method requires at least n function queries, quantum computing 
leverages the generalized DJ algorithm to accomplish this in merely one query.
The quantum methodology still relies on the original DJ circuit illustrated in 
Fig. 11.1. Given a measurement outcome of |y), the period is 2n-k, where k denotes 
the count of leading 0s in y’s binary representation.
3 
Proof
The Hadamard transform maps the computational basis state |x) into a superposition 
state of |y):
|x> HZ -n E (-1)x• y Iy>, 
(11.6)
22 ye{0,1}n
where x • y represents the binary dot product of x and y, i.e., x • y = 
xiyi, with
i=1
xi,yi e {0, 1}.
The multi-qubit state across different junctures of the DJ circuit, shown in 
Fig. 11.1, evolves as:
0n-n |^1>S|^u} = 2 £ |x} 
(11.7a)
2 
x e{0,1}n
-f |*2)  = -= £ (-1)f(x) |x) 
(11.7b)
2 21 xe{0,1}n
HZ |*3) = ± £ } (-1)f (x)®(x•y) |y). 
(11.7c)
Exercise 11.5 Explain why (—1)f (x)+x'y = (—1)f(x)®(x•y), as utilized in the final 
transformation of Eq. 11.7.
A key insight of the extended DJ algorithm is that if f(x) is
f (x) = x • y
(11.8)
for a particular y e {0,1}n, then f (x) ® (x • yj) =0. This results in the corresponding 
|y) component in |^3) to have a full amplitude of 1:
_L £ (—1)f (x)®x•y |y} = _1_ £ 
|y} = |y} . 
(11.9)
x e{0,1} n 
x e{0,1} n
It follows that |^3) solely contains |yj); all other components nullify due to the 
normalization condition. Therefore, measuring |^3) invariably yields |yj).

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
295
To comprehend why f (x) = x • y symbolizes a circular periodic function, consider 
|y) = |00...01...) with k initial 0s. The leading digits in |x) corresponding to the 
leading 0s in |y) do not influence x • y, making the periodicity of f (x) equal to 2n-k.
4 Measurement in Alternative Basis
The measurements are not confined solely to computational basis states. Any set 
of 2n orthonormal basis states is compatible with the generalized DJ algorithm. 
However, shifting to an alternative basis might yield functions lacking straightforward 
properties like apparent periodicity. Moreover, transitioning to an alternative basis 
necessitates an extra unitary transformation before measurement.
To illustrate, consider grouping the 2n basis states into 2n-1 distinct pairs, which 
need not be consecutive. Given a pair, say |i) and |j), two orthogonal states can 
be derived: 1= (|i) + |j)) and 1= (|i) — |j)). Together, these states constitute a 
new orthogonal basis. Measuring against 1 (|i) + |j)) unequivocally identifies the 
function f (x) = x • (i ® j).
5 Spectral Measurement with the DJ Circuit
To further generalize the DJ algorithm, we leave the nature of the function f(x) 
unconstrained. Employing repeated measurements on the DJ circuit, as shown in 
Fig. 11.1, allows us to collect data over numerous iterations. This process enables us 
to derive an empirical probability distribution for each of the 2n possible outcomes 
and construct a length-2n vector representing the spectral distribution of the function 
f (x).

Figure 11.2: Quantum Circuit for Spectral Measurement
Furthermore, while the DJ algorithm traditionally employs the Hadamard trans­
form to facilitate measurements of the spectral distribution in relation to square 
waves, a more sophisticated approach involves replacing the secondary Hadamard 
transform with the Fourier transform, denoted as F . This substitution provides a 
more accurate representation of the spectral density of f (x), as visually depicted in 
Fig. 11.2. Moreover, we can extend the numerical range by substituting f(x) with a 
function characterized by a wider output range, moving beyond the binary confines 
of {0, 1}.
The theoretical probability distribution, representing the spectral density of f (x), 
is given by:

Px(Uf ) = |(x|FUf |*u)|2 , 
(11.10)
• Generalized DJ
In the generalized DJ, or equivalently, the BZ algorithm, where f (x) = x • y 
(Eq. 11.8), and Uf |*u) is represented by |*3) (as defined in Eq. 11.7), Eq. 11.10 
can be rewritten as:
where |*u) is the uniform superposition, as defined in Eq. 11.2, and x e {0, 1}n, or 
equivalently, x e [0, 2n — 1] in decimal representation.
DJ Algorithm Revisited
Now, let’s analyze how Eq. 11.10 operates in the context of the DJ scenarios, where 
F is the Hadamard transform Hn .
• Constant functions
Based on Eq. 11.3, for the constant-0 function, Uf |x) = |x) for any |x), 
leading to Uf |*u) = |*u). Similarly, for the constant-1 function, we have 
Uf |*u) = — |*u). Therefore, for constant functions, Uf |*u) = ± |*u). Since 
Hn |*u) = |0), the equation simplifies to:
Px (Uconstant) = |± (x | Hn |* u )|2 = |± (x |0>|2 = 1 for x = 0, 
(11.11)
x constant 
ni u
0 for x = 0.
• Balanced functions
For a balanced function, Uf |x) = |x) for half of the x values, and Uf |x) = — |x) 
for the other half. Consequently, Uf |*u) becomes a vector, half of whose 
components are y= and the other half — ^=. We denote this state as |*b).
It’s worth noting that |*b) has no overlap with |*u), which has all its compo­
nents equal to -^1=. Furthermore, since Hn |0) = |*u), we have:
Px (Ubalanced) =

11.1.5 * The Phase Oracle
We now focus on the phase oracle, a quantum unitary realization of a specific 
instance of the binary function f (x). This notion of a phase oracle extends to 
several quantum algorithms, not just DJ. Two critical facets require elucidation: the 
quantum realization of f (x), and the phase-kickback mechanism.

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler 
297
1 Unitary Representation of a Function
Harnessing quantum parallelism necessitates that the oracle is constructed as a 
unitary transformation, capable of handling superposition states. We will exemplify 
this with a specific instance detailed in the succeeding exercise.
Exercise 11.6 It is known that the parity function f (x) = XOR(x) = x 1 ® x2 ®
• • • ® xn is a balanced function (see Problem 11.2).
Now establish that inverting any number of input bits in the above function 
results in another balanced function, for instance, f (x) = x1 ® x2 ® • • • ® xn.
Figure 11.3 displays a circuit implementing the function f (x) = x1 ® x2 ® x3 ® x4 
across five qubits. The fifth qubit conveys the outcome, |f (x)). The operation ® is 
realized via CNOT gates, while X gates achieve the inversions.

Exercise 11.7 Confirm that the circuit illustrated in Fig. 11.3 outputs |f (x)) on 
its auxiliary qubit, where f (x) = x1 ® x2 ® x3 ® x4.
2 Phase Kickback
A limitation of the oracle in Fig. 11.3 is its dependence on an auxiliary qubit to 
relay the function result. For the DJ algorithm, the function result must be reflected 
as changes in the original qubits. This can be achieved by initializing the auxiliary 
qubit as |—), typically done with an X gate followed by an H gate, as depicted in 
Fig. 11.4.

This adjustment ensures the auxiliary qubit remains |—), but introduces a phase 
of -1 to the original qubits if f(x) = 1, a phenomenon termed as phase kickback.

11.2 QUBO, VQE, QAOA, and AQC
298
The root cause behind this behavior stems from the properties of the CNOT gate 
(see § 7.1.1):
CNOT |0)H = |0)H ,
(11.14a)
CNOT |1)H = -|1)H .
(11.14b)
Consequently, the state of any input, |xi), transitions to (-1)xi |xi).
Following all the CNOT operations, the entire system reaches the state:
(-1)x11X1) (-1)x2 |X2) (-1)x3 |X3) (-1)x4 |X4) - .
Subsequent X gates negate the inversion effects on xl and X4. This results in:
(-1)f(x) |x)|->.
The phase kickback is now complete.
Though the phase (-1)f(x) may seemingly be aligned with either |x) or |-), its 
dependence on x restricts the alignment with the former for superposition states. 
For instance:
uf J2(|oooo> +11000» - = -12(|0000) - |1ooo» -.
Given its limited utility within the oracle, the auxiliary qubit, commonly termed 
an ancilla qubit, can be disregarded outside the oracle.
The phase oracle can also be implemented with CZ gates instead of CNOTs, as 
showcased in Fig. 11.5.

11.2 QUBO, VQE, QAOA, and AQC
In an era where computational demands continually escalate and classical computing 
paradigms show limitations, the exploration of novel computational methods has 
become imperative. As we transition from limited Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum 
(NISQ) devices to the burgeoning era of quantum utility, these quantum systems 

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler 
299
emerge as a promising avenue. Despite their limitations, NISQ and emerging utility- 
era quantum computers exhibit potential to outperform classical counterparts in 
areas like optimization, quantum simulation, and machine learning[23].
Quantum Computing Applications in the NISQ/Unity Era
In the NISQ and emerging quantum utility era, quantum computing, particu­
larly through hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, is poised to benefit real-world 
applications in several key areas:
• Optimization: Essential for complex problem-solving in finance, logistics, and 
more.
• Quantum Simulation: Useful in material science, drug discovery, and battery 
efficiency.
• Machine Learning: Enhancing data processing, pattern recognition, and 
predictive analytics.
Due to the limited scope of this text, our focus will be on Optimization. Quantum 
simulation requires an advanced understanding of quantum mechanics, and quantum 
machine learning necessitates a comprehensive knowledge of classical machine 
learning.
Central to this pursuit is the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization 
(QUBO) problem. As a combinatorial optimization paradigm, QUBO finds applica­
tions spanning a broad spectrum from finance and economics to advanced machine 
learning endeavors. Owing to its NP-hard nature, several classical challenges from 
theoretical computer science, such as max-cut, graph coloring, and the partition 
problem, have been mapped into the QUBO framework. Furthermore, this mapping 
extends to sophisticated machine learning models like support-vector machines, 
clustering algorithms, and probabilistic graphical models.
NP-hard Problems
Loosely speaking, the term NP-hard designates a class of problems that are partic­
ularly challenging to solve in polynomial time. This means that as the size of the 
problem increases, the time required to find an exact solution grows much more 
rapidly than a polynomial function of the problem size. These types of problems 
frequently arise in various real-world applications, such as logistics and cryptography, 
where finding an optimal solution is crucial yet computationally demanding.
In the quest to solve QUBO, two prominent quantum-classical hybrid algorithms 
emerge: the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the 
Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The QAOA leverages quantum mechanics 
to generate approximate solutions to combinatorial problems by alternating between 
unitary transformations. On the other hand, VQE aims to find the ground state 
energy of a given Hamiltonian by using a parameterized quantum circuit and 
iteratively refining its parameters.
Moreover, given QUBO’s intrinsic relationship with Ising models, it is recognized 
as a key problem class in adiabatic quantum computation (AQC). Herein, solutions 
are procured through a specialized physical process known as quantum annealing.
To elucidate the core principles and subtleties of these algorithms and com­

11.2 QUBO, VQE, QAOA, and AQC
300
putational strategies, we will hone in on the Max-Cut problem as our illustrative 
example.
Achieving Quantum Advantages with VQE and QAOA
VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) and QAOA (Quantum Approximate 
Optimization Algorithm) exhibit three key traits that make them promising for 
realizing quantum advantages, particularly on near-term, noisy, intermediate-scale 
quantum (NISQ) devices: hybrid nature, efficiency, and adaptability.
The hybrid structure of VQE and QAOA enables effective utilization of both 
classical and quantum resources, making them well-suited for NISQ devices. These 
algorithms partition the computational workload between a classical optimizer and 
a quantum processor. This division allows for a fallback to classical techniques for 
error mitigation and tasks that may not yet be efficiently manageable on current 
quantum hardware. Such a distributive strategy is particularly beneficial during 
the transitional phase leading to fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.
Efficiency in VQE and QAOA manifests through their judicious use of quantum 
resources and their capability to yield good approximations using limited qubits 
and shallow circuits. Both algorithms employ parameterized quantum circuits 
with depths usually falling within the coherence times of existing NISQ systems. 
This minimizes the error probabilities associated with longer computations and 
maximizes the computational capabilities of current quantum hardware, an essential 
feature for near-term applications.
The adaptability of these algorithms stems from their iterative mechanisms 
and parameter fine-tuning capabilities. This not only confers robustness against 
quantum errors but also offers flexibility in addressing a wide range of optimization 
and eigenvalue problems. Both VQE and QAOA can be adapted to specific problem 
characteristics, enabling the inclusion of specialized heuristics or alternative cost 
functions. This level of adaptability enhances their applicability across various 
domains, further substantiating their relevance in the context of near-term quantum 
computing.
A variety of concepts and acronyms are introduced in this section. For easy 
reference, see Table 11.2.
11.2.1 The Max-Cut Problem
The Max-Cut problem, originated from graph theory, is an examplary QUBO 
problem. Given an undirected graph with a set of vertices and edges, the objective 
is to partition the vertices into two disjoint sets (or equivalently, color the vertices 
with two distinct colors) such that the number of edges connecting these sets (or 
having differently colored endpoints) is maximized. This scenario is illustrated in 
Fig. 11.6 comprising five vertices.
A useful analogy is visualizing each vertex as a city and each edge as a road 
connecting two cities. The Max-Cut problem can then be understood as optimally 
segregating these cities into two regions to maximize the number of interconnecting 
roads.
Another analogous representation is the influence maximization challenge in social 
networks. Envision a system of interconnected individuals influencing one another. 
Each individual corresponds to a vertex, while their interactions are represented by

edges. This model effectively captures marketing dynamics where the strength of 
influence between individuals, represented by edge weights, governs their purchasing 
decisions. For a marketing strategy offering free products to select individuals, the 
central goal becomes determining the ideal subset of these individuals to optimize 
revenue.
Being NP-hard, the Max-Cut problem implies that as graph size grows, the 
computational time to determine the precise solution can expand exponentially, 
rendering classical methods ineffective for substantial graphs. Nonetheless, due to its 
significance as a representative for numerous optimization challenges, this problem, 
despite its deceptive simplicity, underscores the computational intricacies inherent 
in obtaining optimal solutions, establishing it as a prime candidate for quantum 
computational techniques such as QAOA and quantum annealing.
1 Problem Formulation
The weighted max-cut problem can be formally defined as follows:
For an undirected graph G = (V, E) comprising n nodes, where V denotes 
the vertex set and E symbolizes the edge set, edge weights are given by wij for 
(i,j) e E .A cut bifurcates the primary set V into two subsets, labelled 0 and 1, 
respectively. The function to optimize, in this context, is the aggregate weights on 
edges connecting distinct subsets across the cut. By attributing xi = 0 or xi = 1 to 
each node i, the objective becomes maximizing the global profit function:
C(x) = y? Wij (Xi ® Xj), 
(11.15)
where ® denotes the XOR function. Specifically, xi ® Xj = 1 if xi = Xj, meaning 
that nodes i and j belong to different subsets; the value is 0 otherwise.
In the simplified marketing archetype, wij characterizes the likelihood that indi­
vidual j will purchase a product if i has received it as a free sample. Notably, the 
value of wij can exceed 1 or even be negative. A value greater than 1 could reflect 
scenarios where individual j is motivated to buy multiple products, while a negative 
value could indicate dissuasion. The objective is to maximize the cumulative pur­
chasing probabilities, which equates to revenue optimization. If the anticipated profit 
probability exceeds the initial sample costs, the strategy is considered profitable.

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
303
In an extended model, nodes themselves possess weights, denoted by wi , mirroring 
the probability that an individual receiving a free sample repurchases the product. 
Incorporating this facet, the objective function evolves to:
C(x) = E wij (Xi ® Xj ) + E WiXi ■
(11.16)
The objective function for the extended Max-Cut problem (Eq. 11.16) is mathe­
matically equivalent to that of a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization 
(QUBO) problem.
Exercise 11.8 Formulate the profit function C(x) for the max-cut problem in 
Fig. 11.6, assuming wij = 1 and wi = 0.
11.2.2 * The Ising Model
The Ising model, introduced in § 6.5.3, describes a system of spins under the influence 
of a transverse magnetic field. It provides a bridge between physical systems and 
computational problems, allowing the use of quantum devices to solve problems of 
practical interest.
To derive a solution to the weighted max-cut problem via a quantum computer, 
an initial step is the mapping of this problem to an Ising Hamiltonian. We map the 
binary variables xi, Xj G {0,1} in Eq. 11.16 to zi, Zj G {-1,1} (since the eigenvalues 
of Z are {-1, 1}):
xi ^ 2(1 - zi), 
Xi ® Xj ^ 2(1 - zizj)■ 
(11-17)
Replacing zi and zj with the corresponding Pauli operators Zi and Zj , we deduce 
that:
C(Z)= E wij (I - ZiZj) + E wi (I - Zi) 
(11.18a)
(i,j )e E 
i e v
= -2 E wijZiZj - iE wiZi + const, 
(11.18b)
where const is a Z -independent term and can be ignored.
i | C(Z) is a matrix while C(x) is a number.
Hence, the weighted max-cut problem can be equated to minimizing the Ising 
Hamiltonian:
H =i E wijZiZj + 2 E wiZi, 
(11.19)
which corresponds to identifying the ground state of the spin system portrayed by 
the Ising model.

i | In the above notation, ZiZj is a shorthand for Zi ® Zj, acting on qubits i and j.
The eigenvalues +1 and -1 of the Z operator signify the two separate sets into 
which the vertices are partitioned. When the ZiZj product equals -1, this denotes 
that vertices i and j are placed in different sets, and the corresponding edge is a cut 
edge. Conversely, if ZiZj results in +1, this implies that vertices i and j belong to 
the same set, and the edge is an uncut edge.
Exercise 11.9 Express Eq. 11.19 explicitly as an 8 x 8 matrix, for a system of 
three nodes on a triangle, assuming wij = 1 for all edges and wi = 1 for all nodes.
Exercise 11.10 Formulate the Hamiltonian H for the max-cut problem in Fig. 11.6, 
assuming wij = 1 and wi = 0.
The Ising model can subsequently be tackled using a diverse array of quantum 
algorithms, including the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) 
and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), or via quantum annealing apparatuses 
like the D-Wave systems.
Applications of the Ising Model
The applications of the Ising model are extensive, surpassing just the Max-Cut:
Combinatorial Optimization Problems: Beyond the max-cut problem explored 
here, challenges such as the traveling salesman problem and other NP-hard problems 
can be transposed onto an Ising framework.
Machine Learning: The Ising model’s reach extends to quantum machine learning, 
particularly in modeling Boltzmann machines, which are identified as stochastic 
recurrent neural networks. Herein, the parameters of the Ising model encapsulate 
the weights and biases of the Boltzmann machine, and the model’s equilibrium 
state offers a probabilistic representation of the data.
Quantum Error Correction: Grounded in the Ising model, topological quantum 
error correction codes emerge as promising candidates for trustworthy quantum 
computation. The toric code, a two-dimensional Ising variant with additional con­
straints, facilitates the comprehension and realization of quantum error correction.
Condensed Matter Physics: The quantum version of the Ising model plays an 
instrumental role in simulating quantum phase transitions, a subject capturing 
significant interest within the domain of condensed matter physics. More specifically, 
the Ising model provides insights into the transitionary phases between distinct states 
of matter induced by quantum perturbations. This encompasses the exploration of 
phenomena like ferromagnetism, anti-ferromagnetism, and other unconventional 
states of matter.
11.2.3 * Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)
The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm 
designed to harness the capabilities of quantum computers. While its initial develop­
ment targeted quantum chemistry applications—often considered the most practical 
use-case for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers—the algorithm’s 

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler 
305
scope extends beyond this, making it also suitable for solving optimization problems.
At the heart of VQE is the mapping of the problem onto a Hamiltonian. The 
ground state of this Hamiltonian encodes the solution. The variational principle 
ensures that for any chosen trial state, V (0), its energy expectation value will always 
be greater than or equal to the ground state energy, E0 . Thus, by iteratively 
optimizing the parameters of the trial state, the VQE approximates the ground state 
energy and the associated quantum state.
1 
The Variational Principle
The variational principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics, formally 
stated as:
(V(0)|H|V(0))> Eo,
(11.20)
where E0 represents the ground state energy.
This principle lays the groundwork for the VQE algorithm. In quantum systems 
with many qubits, the state space becomes intractably large for exhaustive energy 
minimization. However, a quantum computer can efficiently prepare trial states and 
evaluate their corresponding energy expectation values. Following these quantum 
computations, a classical optimizer adjusts the parameters 0 in order to minimize 
the energy, thus approximating the ground state of the system.
When maximizing a profit function is the objective, it is equivalent to minimizing 
the negative of that function.
2 Ansatz
The ansatz in VQE refers to the trial quantum state, V(0), parameterized by an 
array of parameters 0 . It is an educated guess of the solution, based on certain 
heuristics or insights. Implemented as a parameterized quantum circuit, the quality 
of the ansatz is crucial to the accuracy of the VQE. If the chosen ansatz is not 
expressive enough to approximate the ground state of the problem, the optimization 
is unlikely to yield accurate results.
3 Measurement
The ansatz is run repeatedly for m times. For each run, the n qubits are measured 
n t e computat ona as s; t e -run y e s n measurement va ues z1 , z2 , ..., zn , 
where zik) = 1 for measurement outcome |0), and —1 for |1). Essentially, we are 
measuring each qubit with the Z observable.
Then the expected value of the Hamiltonian is estimated according to Eq. 11.19:
1 m __ ... I m ...... .............
/v | h |v\ =___ W^wz(k) 
+______ V 5^ w-z(k) z(k) 
(1121)
\v|H |v) =2m / y y wizi +2m ^2.^ wijzi zj ' 
(11-21)
Note the above calculation is only valid for the Ising model, where the Hamiltonian 
involves Z solely and is hence diagonal in the computational basis. The general case 
is more complicated, to be discussed at the end of this subsection.

Figure 11.7: VQE Ansatz and Iteration Procedure
The VQE follows an iterative procedure (Fig. 11.7) comprising:
1. Crafting a parameterized quantum circuit that serves as the ansatz, |^(0)).
2. Measuring the ansatz qubits on a quantum computer and processing the 
outcomes classically to estimate the expected value (^(0)|H|^(0)).
3. Employing a classical optimizer to propose adjustments to the ansatz’s param­
eters.
The iterations continue until convergence, or when the change in the expected 
value is below a predefined threshold.
The weights wi,j are not directly incorporated into the variational parameters 0; 
instead, 0 is utilized to construct the trial ground state vector within the quantum 
circuit framework. The weights wijj are used to compute the expected value of 
the Hamiltonian on a classical computer. An optimization routine, executed on a 
classical computer, then uses this calculated expected value to iteratively adjust 
0. This process aims to minimize the expected value of the Hamiltonian, thereby 
accurately approximating the ground state with an optimal 0.
5 
 General Case
*
In the general case, such as when VQE is used in chemistry simulation, computation 
of the expected value (^(0)|H |^(0)) is non-trivial. The Hamiltonian must first be 
decomposed into Pauli strings, Pi :
H = ^cciPi, Pi e{I,X,Y,Z}®n. 
(11.22)
With the Pauli basis being orthogonal and having a norm of 2, the coefficients ci 
can be expressed as:

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler 
307
ci = 2n tr(HPi). 
(11.23)
Consequently, the expected value of H is:
($|H|$) = ^c ci ($|Pi |$). 
(n.24)
Sampling the Pauli Operators
When dealing with a Hamiltonian H that comprises not just the Z operator but also 
X and Y , distinct measurement strategies are employed. Direct measurements in 
the computational basis suffice for evaluating (^|Z|^). However, to obtain expected 
values for X and Y , one must rotate the basis prior to measurement, using the 
Hadamard gate for X and Rx(— n) for Y, as described in § 3.4.5.
In this more general context, calculating the overall expected value (^|H|^) 
involves measuring each term in the Hamiltonian’s Pauli basis expansion (Eq. 11.24). 
Each term generally necessitates a unique run of the quantum circuit (or ansatz), 
meaning up to 4n runs could be required in the worst-case scenario. However, many 
practical quantum problems feature Hamiltonians with far sparser representations, 
thereby reducing the number of circuit runs needed to achieve a reliable estimation 
of the Hamiltonian’s expected value.
6 
The Ground State
For the Max-Cut problem, since the Hamiltonian is diagonal in the computational 
basis, its eigenstates will also be computational basis states. Hence, the ground state 
that minimizes the cost function will correspond to a computational basis state.
In the general case, this may no longer be the case. The ground state may be a 
superposition state in the computational basis.
11.2.4 * Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is based on the 
Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) framework. It is specifically designed to 
solve combinatorial optimization problems such as Max-Cut. The primary objective 
is to identify the quantum state that minimizes the expected value of a Hamiltonian 
which encapsulates the cost function of the problem at hand.
While QAOA shares the iterative nature of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver 
(VQE), it employs a specialized ansatz, as depicted in Fig. 11.8.
1 
Structure of the QAOA Ansatz
The QAOA ansatz employs an alternating sequence of unitary transformations, 
which are derived from two Hamiltonians: the cost Hamiltonian HC and a mixing 
Hamiltonian HB . Specifically, the ansatz consists of repeated blocks of two types of 
unitary transformations, Uc (y) and UB (fi), expressed as:
UB (fi) = e -iH, Uc ( y ) = e - iYHC, 
(11.25)
where fi and y are variational parameters optimized through classical means.

11.2 QUBO, VQE, QAOA, and AQC

Figure 11.8: QAOA Ansatz and Iterative Procedure
2 
Cost Hamiltonian
The cost Hamiltonian, HC , encodes the objective function of the optimization 
problem. It assigns an “energy” or “cost” to specific configurations of the system. 
The goal for combinatorial optimization problems is to find the configuration that 
minimizes this energy. A representative expression for HC in the context of Max-Cut 
is:
He = 2 E WijZiZj + 2 E WiZi, 
(11-26)
Here, V and E are the sets of vertices and edges in the graph G = (V, E). wij and 
wi are the weights for edges and vertices, and Zi is the Pauli-Z operator on the i-th 
qubit-
3 
Mixing Hamiltonian
The mixing Hamiltonian HB facilitates transitions between different cut configura­
tions, thereby aiding the system in exploring the space of potential solutions- A 
common choice for HB is:
Hb = E Xi, 
(11-27)
where Xi is the Pauli-X operator on the i-th qubit-
4 
Interplay and Iteration
The interplay between HC and HB lies at the heart of QAOA’s functionality- While 
HC encodes problem-specific penalties or rewards, HB keeps the quantum state in a 
superposition of various configurations- By iteratively applying these Hamiltonians 
and fine-tuning the variational parameters, QAOA aims to direct the quantum 
system toward HC ’s ground state- The optimal depth p is generally determined 

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
309
through empirical studies, balancing the need for algorithmic performance against 
computational resources. This ground state corresponds to the problem’s optimal or 
near-optimal solution.
5 
Example Application to Max-Cut
Consider a simple Max-Cut problem depicted in Fig. 11.6. The graph has vertices 
V = {1,2,3,4,5} and edges E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}, with all 
edge weights set to unity, and node weights to zero.
The solution is obviously a cut shown by the dashed curve: with only one un-cut 
edge (1, 3), and nodes partitioned into {1, 3, 4} and {2, 5}. But we will walk through 
the QAOA process as a demonstration of its concepts and procedure.
Its cost Hamiltonian can be expressed using the Ising model as:
He = 1 E ZiZj. 
(11.28)
When the product of ZiZj is -1, it means the vertices i and j are in different sets 
(a cut edge), contributing negatively to the total energy. Therefore, minimizing (He) 
corresponds to maximizing the number of cuts, the goal of the Max-Cut problem.
The unitary block Ue (y) is given by:
Ue(Y) = e-iYHC = IJ e-iYZiZj = II ZZj (’ 
(11.29)
where each factor in the product is a ZZ( 2) gate (see § 7.1.5) acting on qubits i and 
j.
The unitary block UB ($) is given by:
UB ($) = e-iHB = H e-iX = 0 Rxi ($) ’ 
(11-30)
where each factor in the product is an Rx ($) gate acting on qubit i.
The building block for the QAOA ansatz comprising Ue (y) and UB ($) is shown 
in Fig. 11.9.
After sufficient number of iterations, the algorithm arrives at a ground state 
expected value (He) = -2. The resulting ground state is |01001) (or equivalently 
110110)), yielding a partition of {1, 3, 4} and {2, 5} as anticipated.
Exercise 11.11 Formulate the cost function and the Ising Hamiltonian for the 
six-node Max-Cut problem shown in the figure below. Assume all the edge weights 
are 2. Node weights are 1 for even nodes and —1 for odd nodes. Solve the problem 
to find the optimal cut using QAOA, implemented in Qiskit, Cirq or a similar 
platform. Provide the final (i.e., most probable) state vector and the measure of 
the quality of the cut.

* Traveling Salesman Problem
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a seminal problem in the realm of QUBO. 
It involves finding the shortest route through a list of cities, ensuring that each city 
is visited exactly once before returning to the starting city. This can be represented 
as a weighted graph where the cities are vertices and the distances between them 
serve as weighted edges, as shown in Fig. 11.10. Much like the Max-Cut problem, 
TSP is NP-hard, meaning that computational time grows substantially with an 
increase in the number of cities.
Owing to its wide range of applications in fields such as logistics and transporta­
tion, the TSP has attracted attention from both classical and quantum optimization 
techniques. Despite its seeming simplicity, the problem is deeply rooted in com­
binatorial optimization, underlining the value of quantum approaches for solving 
complex problems.
Problem Formulation
The TSP is mathematically framed as follows: one seeks to minimize the tour 
distance in a graph G = (V, E), where n nodes represent cities and dij denotes the 
distance between nodes i and j . The tour distance for a cycle is defined as:
n n
L(x) = 
dij xij ,
i=1 j=1,j=i
(11.31)
where xij e {0, 1} indicates if the tour goes from node i to j, with xij = 1 if so.

Constraints
To ensure that each city is visited exactly once, the following constraints are imposed:
Sj = ^2 xij = 1 for j = 1, 2, ■■■, n, 
(11.32a)
i,i=j
Si = ^2 xij = 1 for i = 1, 2, ■■■, n. 
(11.32b)
The first equation states that for each city j , there must be exactly one city i 
such that xij = 1. This ensures that a path enters each city exactly once.
The second equation states that for each city i, there must be exactly one city j 
such that xij = 1. This ensures that a path exits each city exactly once.
3 
Objective Function
The objective function, which includes both the tour distance and the constraints, 
is:
C(x) = L(x) + A 
(1 - Sj)2 + A ^2 (1 — Si)2 ’ 
(n-33)
j=1 
i=1
with A as a free parameter large enough to enforce the constraints, generally 
A > max (dij).
This combined objective function is quandratic in xij :
C(x) —

wijxij ■ 
(11.34)

Quantum-Classical Hybrid Solution
The TSP can also be solved using hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the 
Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Due to the problem’s 

11.2 QUBO, VQE, QAOA, and AQC
312
complexity, the above TSP implementation requires n2 qubits, as opposed to the n 
qubits needed for Max-Cut. Modern quantum computing platforms often provide 
libraries to simplify this formulation.
For a more in-depth understanding, the reader is directed to the following 
references:
• Efficient traveling salesman problem solvers using the Ising model with simu­
lated bifurcation [98].
• Clustering approach for solving traveling salesman problems via Ising model­
based solver [37].
Exercise 11.12 Work through the six-node TSP example shown in Fig. 11.10. 
Formulate the cost function and the Ising Hamiltonian, and then solve the problem 
using QAOA. Use Qiskit, Cirq or a similar platform for implementation. Provide 
the final (i.e., most probable) state vector and the shortest tour distance. (If your 
platform does not have the capacity for simulating TSP with six nodes, reduce 
the number to five or four.)
11.2.6 Adiabatic Quantum Computation and Annealing
Quantum annealing is a specialized approach tailored for optimization problems. 
We will discuss this further using Max-Cut as an example.
1 
From Universal Quantum Computing to Quantum Annealing
In the ever-evolving landscape of quantum computing, two primary paradigms 
have gained prominence: gate-based universal quantum computing and quantum 
annealing.
Gate-based universal quantum computers employ a series of quantum gates to 
control qubits. This model’s universality makes it apt for diverse computational 
problems, from integer factorization to quantum system simulations. Algorithms 
like Deutsch-Jozsa, VQE, and QAOA, as well as Shor’s and Grover’s algorithms, 
belong to this paradigm. Some algorithms are not discussed here due to the scope 
of this text.
Adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) is another form of quantum computing, 
as introduced in § 4.4. Here, the problem is mapped to a quantum system whose 
ground state represents the solution. Starting from an initial, easily-understandable 
Hamiltonian, the system is slowly evolved to a final Hamiltonian that encodes the 
solution.
Quantum annealing is a subset of AQC tailored for optimization problems. It 
avoids the need for precise quantum gate sequences, allowing the system to evolve 
under its natural quantum mechanics.
This natural evolution makes quantum annealing particularly useful for optimiza­
tion problems in various domains like machine learning, finance, and logistics. The 
lack of need for exact gate sequences can ease the construction of larger quantum 
systems, although some problems may not be well-suited for this approach.

2 
Solving Max-Cut with Quantum Annealing
In AQC, we begin with the quantum system in its ground state, corresponding to 
the lowest energy eigenstate of an initial Hamiltonian Hinitial . The Hamiltonian is 
then evolved towards a target Htarget , which encodes the optimization problem. The 
evolving Hamiltonian, H (t), is given by:
H(t) = (1 - s(t))Hinitial + s(t)Htarget, 
(11.35)
where s(t) transitions from 0 to 1 during the annealing process. According to the 
adiabatic theorem, a slow evolution ensures the system remains in its ground state, 
facilitating a smooth transition from Hinitial to Htarget and ultimately arriving at 
the solution.
A commonly used Hinitial in quantum annealing the transverse-field Ising Hamil­
tonian, given by:
Hinitial = -r £ Xi, 
(11.36)
i=1
where r represents the strength of the transverse magnetic field, and Xi is the Pauli 
X operator acting on the i-th qubit.
The corresponding ground state is a uniform superposition of all computational 
basis states, represented as:
|^initial) = 0 |+) = 
|i} - 
(11.37)
i=1 
i=0
The target Hamiltonian, Htarget , is given by:
Htarget = ^ ^2 wjZiZj + 2^2 wiZi, 
(11.38)
where ZiZj represents Zi ® Zj, with Pauli Z acting on qubits i and j. (See Eq. 11.19.)
Once these Hamiltonians are defined, the quantum annealing machine takes 
over the computation. The annealing process initiates by preparing the quantum 
system in the ground state of Hinitial . The system then evolves under the influence 
of the time-dependent Hamiltonian H (t), which is a mixture of the initial and target 
Hamiltonians controlled by the parameter s(t).
The annealing schedule, often predefined, controls the evolution of s(t) from 0 
to 1. As the system evolves, it naturally explores the energy landscape, guided by 
quantum fluctuations. The slow change ensures that the system remains near its 
ground state throughout the process, due to the adiabatic theorem.
At the end of the annealing schedule, the quantum state of the system approxi­
mates the ground state of Htarget . This state is then measured, yielding a classical bit 
string that represents a near-optimal solution to the encoded optimization problem. 
Subsequent repetitions of this process can improve the quality of the solution through 
statistical sampling.

11.2 QUBO, VQE, QAOA, and AQC
314
It’s worth mentioning that while the annealing process is heuristic in nature, it has 
shown promising results in various optimization problems, offering a complementary 
approach to gate-based quantum computing.
Exercise 11.13 Solve the six-node Max-Cut problem shown in the figure below 
using a quantum annealing platfrom such as D-Wave NetworkX. Assume all the 
edge weights are 2. Node weights are 1 for even nodes and —1 for odd nodes. 
Provide the final state vector and calculate the value of the cut as the measure of 
its quality. Compare your solution with the QAOA counterpart.
Exercise 11.14 Solve the six-node sraveling salesman problem shown in Fig. 11.10 
using a quantum annealing platfrom such as D-Wave NetworkX. Provide the 
final state vector and the shortest tour distance. Compare your solution with the 
QAOA counterpart. (If your platform does not have the capacity for simulating 
TSP with six nodes, reduce the number to five or four.)
3 
Conditions for Quantum Speedup and Limitations
In adiabatic quantum computation, and more specifically in quantum annealing, as 
Hinitial evolves towards Htarget (see Eq. 11.35), the energy gap between the ground 
state and the first excited state of the quantum system varies over time. This gap can 
become very small, potentially even reaching zero, a point known as a level crossing. 
The efficiency of the algorithm is closely tied to the behavior of the minimum energy 
gap, denoted as G.
The required annealing time t is inversely proportional to the square of G, 
expressed as t rc 1 /G2. Should G decrease exponentially with the size of the 
problem, or the number of qubits n, in the form G rc e-an for some positive constant 
a, then t will increase exponentially. This exponential increase in time negates any 
potential quantum speedup, as the system would then require an impractically long 
time to evolve.
For quantum annealing to be efficient and to offer a potential quantum speedup, 
the energy gap G must decrease polynomially with the problem size n. If G scales 
as G rc 1/nk for some constant k, the annealing time t would then increase only 
polynomially, remaining manageable and enabling a substantial quantum speedup 
compared to classical algorithms.
It is important to recognize that the behavior of the energy gap G can significantly 
vary depending on the specific problem and its representation within the Hamiltonian 
of the quantum system. While some problems may naturally exhibit a polynomially 
decreasing gap, others may have an exponentially shrinking gap, rendering them 
unsuitable for efficient quantum annealing. Notably, the well-known NP-Hard 
problem, 3SAT, has been shown to present an exponentially decreasing energy gap, 
thus categorizing it among the less favorable problems for quantum annealing. In 

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
315
addition, for many practical problems, the behavior of their minimum energy gap 
is unknown beforehand, making it challenging to schedule the annealing process 
effectively and validate the results.
As of 2023, quantum annealing hardware, such as systems produced by D-Wave, 
typically operates on stoquastic Hamiltonians. A stoquastic Hamiltonian is one 
where all the off-diagonal elements in the standard computational basis are real and 
non-positive, which leads to certain computational simplifications. This limitation 
constrains the types of problems that quantum annealing can effectively address.
11.3 Quantum Bomb and Quantum Money
In this section, we explore the diversity of quantum algorithms through the study of 
two distinctive examples: the quantum bomb test algorithm and quantum money. 
These algorithms, while less commonly cited than DJ (Deutsch-Jozsa) and BV 
(Bernstein-Vazirani), Simon, or Shor, demonstrate the breadth and versatility of 
quantum computing. They elucidate a variety of intricate aspects, including quan­
tum measurements, probabilistic computational methods, and post-quantum crypto­
graphic techniques.
11.3.1 The Quantum Bomb Test Algorithm
This algorithm was initially conceptualized in a 1993 thought experiment by A. 
Elitzur and L. Vaidman[40]. It provides a compelling showcase for the unique 
principles of quantum measurements, distinguishing them sharply from their classical 
counterparts. This algorithm is also a cornerstone in the study of interaction-free 
measurements in quantum mechanics.
1 
The Scenario
Consider a situation where you are presented with an assortment of indistinguishable 
boxes. While some contain quantum bombs, others are empty or ‘duds’. The 
quantum bombs are sensitive to a single photon in horizontal polarization. The task 
at hand is to ascertain whether a given box contains a bomb without detonating it.
In the classical realm, any attempt to test the box’s contents would result in a 
conundrum: if the box does not explode, you cannot conclusively determine whether 
it contains a bomb. If it explodes, you obviously know it was a bomb, but the object 
is destroyed. Essentially, it is a mission impossible in the classical realm.
2 
Measuring in the Computational Basis
To cast the problem within the quantum measurement framework, let’s represent a 
dud by an identity gate I. A measurement of an input state |0) will result in the 
output state |0), and similarly for |1).
A bomb, on the other hand, acts as a measuring device that triggers if it 
encounters the input state |1). Although not a unitary transformation, such a device 
can be physically implemented without involving an actual bomb. For instance, a 
polarization splitter in photonics could execute this conditional action.
3 
Measuring in the {|+>, |-)} Basis
When considering quantum properties, the scenario changes drastically. By introduc-

316
(a) Dud 
(b) Bomb
Figure 11.11: Quantum Bomb Tester - Classical Scenario
Figure 11.12: Quantum Bomb Tester - Measuring in the {|+), |—)} Basis
ing the bomb to a superposition state and measuring it in a different basis, we open 
up new possibilities. In particular, we can initialize our circuit with |0) and use two 
Hadamard gates to sandwich either the dud or the bomb. The initial Hadamard gate 
transforms |0) into |+). The subsequent Hadamard gate changes the measurement 
basis to {|+), |—)}.
In this setup, the bomb has a 50% probability of exploding and a 50% chance of 
remaining intact. If it doesn’t explode, a subsequent measurement will yield either 
|0) or |1) with equal probability. For the dud, the output remains as the input, 
invariably resulting in the measurement outcome |0).
Thus, there exists a net 25% chance of identifying a bomb without causing it 
to detonate. Even though not perfect, a significant improvement over the classical 
scenario!
4 
The Quantum Bomb Test Algorithm
We now elaborate on an algorithm designed to detect the presence of a quantum bomb 
with an arbitrarily low probability of detonation. This algorithm is encapsulated in 
the quantum circuit depicted in Fig. 11.13.
The input state employed for this algorithm is as follows:
|s) = cos s |0) + sin s |1), 
(11.39)
where s is a small angle defined by s = 2N, with N representing a large integer.

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
317
Repeated N Times
Figure 11.13: The Quantum Bomb Test Algorithm
To achieve this input state, |s), we apply the R(s) gate to an initial state of |0):
R (s ) =
cos s 
sin s
- sin s 
cos s
(11.40)
In the case of a dud, the qubit evolves as R(s)N |0) = cos(Ns) |0) + sin(Ns) |1) 
before measurement. The outcome will yield |1) with a probability of sin2(Ns) = 1, 
correctly identifying the dud.
In the case of a bomb, upon measurement, the probability of receiving |1) and 
thus triggering the bomb is sin2(s) ~ s2, as per the small-angle approximation. If 
this does not occur, the qubit will collapse to |0), and the circuit will iterate.
After N iterations, the probability of triggering the bomb by that point is 
2
approximately 4nN, which can be made arbitrarily low with a large enough N. 
Conversely, the likelihood of identifying the bomb without triggering it, given by 
cos2N (s), is approximately 1 — 4nN, and can be made arbitrarily close to 1.
Key Takeaways
The Quantum Bomb Test Algorithm elucidates several key concepts:
1. Similar to certain classical probabilistic algorithms, quantum algorithms 
can be designed to perform specific tasks with arbitrary precision, involving 
tradeoffs in resource usage or running time, albeit never achieving absolute 
certainty.
2. While quantum algorithms are typically conceptualized as a sequence of 
unitary gates culminating in measurements—a concept that might be 
referred to as the unitary computing model—they may also benefit from 
incorporating intermediate non-unitary branching devices.
3. Interaction-free quantum measurements, allowing for the detection or 
inference of an object’s presence without directly interacting with it, can 
be conducted with arbitrary precision, showcasing a unique aspect of 
quantum measurements that has no direct analogue in classical physics.

11.3.2 * Basics of Quantum Money |$)
Quantum money employs quantum mechanical principles to create coins (or ban­
knotes) that are inherently secure against counterfeiting. This notion was pioneered 
by Wiesner in 1983 and has since seen extensions and variations by subsequent 
researchers.
Unlike traditional digital currencies, which derive their security from compu­
tationally hard problems, quantum money exploits unique features of quantum 
mechanics. In particular, the no-cloning theorem establishes that an arbitrary 
unknown quantum state cannot be perfectly cloned. This quantum feature offers 
a security paradigm that transcends what is feasible with classical approaches. 
Nonetheless, the development of publicly verifiable quantum money remains an 
elusive, open challenge.
Two primary types of quantum money exist: private-key and public-key. Each 
has its own set of advantages, disadvantages, and appropriate use-cases, with both 
types leveraging quantum mechanics for enhanced security.
While digital currencies like Bitcoin are well-established in the financial world, 
quantum money is currently an active area of research, particularly significant in 
the field of quantum cryptography, exploring new frontiers in secure transactions.
1 Key Concepts
Money State
The money state, denoted as |$), is a multi-qubit state 
embodying a quantum coin. It is designed to resist cloning, 
leveraging the no-cloning theorem. It encodes quantum 
information critical for the authentication and verification 
of the value of quantum money.
|$s) = 0 |1>i)
i=1
A Quantum Coin 
(s, |$»
The number of qubits in |$), denoted n, is chosen as a tradeoff between security 
and efficiency, e.g., 256.
Serial Number
The serial number, represented as s, is a classical identifier uniquely associated with 
each money state. While the serial number is publicly readable, the corresponding 
quantum state, which constitutes the money, is usually secret and challenging to 
replicate. In various quantum money protocols, the serial number is employed to 
query information about the money state and is not directly used in the verification 
and authentication processes.
Private Key
The private key is confidential information held by the issuing bank (or mint), 
essential for authenticating or verifying a quantum money state. In private-key 

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
319
schemes, the private key allows for the validation of the money state’s authenticity 
when correlated with its serial number. In public-key schemes, the private key is 
involved in generating the serial number and money state. In all schemes, the bank 
rigorously protects the private key to prevent unauthorized access and potential 
counterfeiting.
Public Key
The public key is disseminated openly, enabling the public to authenticate a quantum 
money state. Public-key schemes enable decentralized verification without requiring 
the bank’s involvement in each transaction. Despite its public accessibility, the 
public key is designed not to reveal enough information to counterfeit the money 
state.
2 
Private-Key Quantum Money
Private-key quantum money schemes necessitate the involvement of the issuing 
bank for authentication, ensuring centralized control. Here, the no-cloning theorem 
guarantees the integrity and uniqueness of the quantum money state. The basic 
protocol is outlined below:
1. Money State Generation: The bank generates a serial number s and generates 
a corresponding private key Ks that remains confidential. Based on the private 
key, the bank prepares a quantum money state, |$s).
2. Issuance to Customer: The bank transfers |$s) and its serial number s to a 
customer.
3. Centralized Verification: The bank alone can validate the quantum money 
state using the private key Ks , which contains the required measurement 
angles for measurement.
4. Transaction Confirmation: Upon successful verification, the transaction is 
approved.
Private-key quantum money offers a more straightforward implementation but 
introduces scalability issues, as the bank needs to be part of every transaction, 
similar to a credit card payment. The scheme also shares challenges common to 
public-key systems, such as the need for quantum memories and error correction.
3 
The Wiesner Quantum Money
The Wiesner quantum money, introduced in 1983[90], is a private-key scheme 
that utilizes a simple yet effective approach for secure quantum currency. In 
this scheme, each quantum coin, represented by (s, |$s)), is associated with a 
corresponding private key Ks G {0, 1, +, —}n. The subset {0, 1} corresponds to the 
computational basis states {|0), 11)} in |$s), and {+, —} corresponds to the Hadamard 
basis states, {|+), |—)}. For example, Ks = (0, +, 1, 0, —, +,...) corresponds to 
|$s) = |0 + 10 —+...).
To verify a coin, the bank measures each qubit of |$s) in the appropriate basis 
using Ks , checking for the correct outcome. This process ensures the integrity of 
the authentic coin’s state |$s). Conversely, measurements against an incorrect Ks 
on a counterfeit coin will alter |$s) due to state collapse, rendering replication or 
verification without Ks impossible.

11.3 Quantum Bomb and Quantum Money
320
In the original scheme, the issuing bank maintained a database of all (s, Ks) 
pairs. Modern adaptations often derive Ks from s using a secure hash function 
combined with a secret key (or salt) held by the bank, thereby eliminating the need 
for such a database. However, this approach introduces potential security concerns 
associated with the classical hash function, as it is not unconditionally secure.
The Wiesner scheme bears resemblance to the BB84 QKD protocol discussed in 
§ 5.5. In fact, it served as an inspiration for the development of BB84 in 1984.
It is fascinating to examine how quantum money can be forged (which we refer 
to as attacks) and the possible countermeasures. Through examining these, we can 
gain significant insight into the issues and protocols of quantum security.
Measure and Replicate Attack
Suppose a counterfeiter measures each qubit of a quantum coin in the computational 
basis. Since the money state consists of {|0), |1)} with a 50% probability, and 
{+ , | —)} with a 50% probability, the results would be correct for half of the qubits.
The counterfeiter can then duplicate as many coins as he likes. But what is the 
chance for his forged coin to pass authentication at the bank? For each qubit, if 
the correct basis is indeed {|0), |1)}, he gets a PASS, which has a probability of 
2. If the correct basis happens to be {|+), |—)}, measuring a computational basis 
state in the Hadamard basis has a 2 chance to obtain the authentic result. So the 
overall passing probability for each qubit is 1 + 2 • 1 = 4. For n = 256 qubits, 
the overall passing probability is (|) 10-32. Therefore, the counterfeiter has to 
replicate approximately 1032 coins for this simple attack to be profitable, which is 
deemed impractical.
A possible countermeasure for the bank is limiting the rate of authentication 
trials per serial number, say to 1 per second. Note the bank should not simply 
blacklist a serial number after seeing a bad authentication, because doing so would 
allow a bad actor to cancel another person’s quantum money.
Qubit-by-Qubit Learning Attack
Suppose the bank returns a quantum coin to the customer even if the authentication 
FAILs. In this scenario, a counterfeiter can devise an attack by learning the qubits one 
by one [69]. The attacker modifies the state of a single qubit (the i-th) in a legitimate 
coin to, say, |0), and sends this tampered coin to the bank for authentication. If 
the correct state should be |1), the coin will be rejected with a probability of 100%. 
If the correct state is |+) or | —), there is a 2 chance of the coin being rejected. 
Therefore, the probability for a coin with an incorrect qubit state to be rejected is 
1 + 2 • 1 = 2, and 1 for it to not be rejected.
3 
32

Since the authentication process does not alter the other qubits, which are in the 
eigenstates of the measurement bases, the counterfeiter can repeat this process. After 
m trials, the probability for a qubit with the wrong state to be rejected by the bank 
is at least 1 — (|) . For example, with m = 10 trials, the attacker can determine 
with high probability if the new state of the coin is incorrect. By systematically 
testing all four states, |0j, |1), |+), and |—), the attacker can ascertain the state of 
the i-th qubit. This process can be repeated to learn the states of all the qubits, 
requiring a total of mn trials. As the number of trials is linear with n, this strategy 
represents a highly practical attack.

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
321
From this analysis, it is evident that to prevent such attacks, the bank should 
not return a failed authentication coin to the customer.
The Adaptive Attack
Suppose the bank destroys any coin (or blacklists its serial number) if authentication 
FAILs, but returns the coin to its customer if authentication PASSes. A clever attack 
exploiting this situation is derived from the quantum bomb test algorithm (refer 
to § 11.3.1)[31]. Here, an authentication-FAIL (resulting in the coin’s destruction) 
is analogous to the bomb in the quantum bomb test. The coin undergoes N 
measurements for each test, but the total probability of triggering an authentication 
2
failure and destroying the coin is capped at nN, which can be made arbitrarily small 
for a sufficiently large N .

Figure 11.14: Adaptive Attack on Wiesner Quantum Money
The attack scheme, illustrated in Fig. 11.14, assumes the attacker can attach 
an ancilla qubit a to the money state |$) and apply a quantum gate (e.g., CNOT) 
between it and any qubit |^i) in |$). Before each authentication, the ancilla qubit 
is rotated by a small angle s = 2N and then CNOT’ed with |^i). The state of the 
ancilla qubit just before the first CNOT gate is:
|s 1) = cos s |0) + sin s |1). 
(11.41)
After the CNOT gate, the combined state of the ancilla and the i-th money 
qubit is:
|^combined) = CNOT(|S 1) ® |^i))

The probability of the bank’s subsequent authentication measurement yielding a 
FAIL is:
p(FAIL) =
sin2 s ra (n)2 for 
sin2 s ra (n)2 for

(11.43)
,0 for |^i} = |—) .
It becomes apparent that |^i) = |+) or | —) corresponds to a dud, while |^i) = |0) 
or |1) corresponds to a bomb. If the authentication succeeds, which is highly probable, 
the money state reverts to | ^i). For |^i) = |0) or |1), the ancilla and coin qubit were 
entangled, causing the ancilla to collapse back to |0). For |^i) = |+), the ancilla 
remains unchanged, while for |^i) = |—), it changes to coss |0) — sins |1).
If the coin survives m measurements, the ancilla state becomes:
|0) for |^i} — |0), 
|0 for |^i} = |1), 
cos ms |0) + sin ms 11)

(11.44)

At this juncture, the attacker measures the ancilla qubit. If the result is 11), it 
indicates that the i-th money qubit is definitively |+). However, the attacker cannot 
discern whether the correct basis is {|0), |1)} or {|+), |—)}. To determine this, the 
attacker replaces the CNOT gate with a controlled-negative-NOT gate (refer to 
§ 7.1.3), thus discerning if the qubit is in the |—) state. With a total of 2nN trials, 
2
the attacker has a high probability, approximately 1 — nN, of learning the correct 
measurement bases without detection. This strategy enables the measurement of 
each qubit in its correct basis to deduce the entire money state.
This attack demonstrates that Wiesner’s money scheme can only be secure if the 
bank replaces validated coins.
If an attacker can replicate a quantum coin with a high probability, does this violate 
the no-cloning theorem? No, because the theorem pertains to the deterministic 
replication of an arbitrary quantum state.
Exercise 11.16 Work out the attack procedure for the adaptive attack on Wiesner’s 
coin using controlled-Z and controlled-negative-Z gates.

Challenge-and-Response Authentication
Private-key quantum money protocols, akin to modern credit card systems, require 
centralized authentication, imposing significant demands on quantum networking 
and communication infrastructure. To mitigate these challenges, several alternative 
protocols have been proposed, including challenge-and-response and public-key 
systems.
Consider Wiesner’s quantum money for illustrating 
the challenge-and-response authentication process. It 
initiates with the coin owner transmitting the serial 
number s to the bank via a classical, potentially in­
secure, channel. The bank then generates a random 
challenge string Cs e {0, 1, +, —}n. This string, for­
matted like the private key Ks , shares a 50% overlap 
with it. The owner measures the money state $ with 
respect to Cs and relays the outcomes back to the bank. 
The bank then authenticates the coin by comparing 
these measurements with the recorded states of the 
overlapping qubits.
This approach is reminiscent of the key-sifting protocol in the BB84 quantum key 
distribution (QKD) method (see § 5.5). A significant limitation for quantum money 
using this approach, however, is the degradation of qubits with each authentication 
attempt. Specifically, half of the qubits in the coin are compromised during the 
process. To counter this, quantum coins could be designed to associate multiple 
identical money states with a single serial number, while the bank maintains records 
of the invalidated states.
Informationally Secure vs. Computationally Secure
This challenge-and-response authentication protocol, as well as the BB84 and 
E91 QKD protocols, are informationally secure.
Informationally secure systems guarantee security based on the principles 
of information theory, ensuring that a cryptographic system remains secure 
regardless of the computational power available to an adversary. This means 
that even with unlimited computing resources, an attacker cannot gain any 
useful information. The one-time pad is a classic example of an informationally 
secure system.
In contrast, computationally secure systems rely on the assumption of limited 
computational resources. Their security is based on the difficulty of solving 
certain mathematical problems, like factoring large numbers, within a practical 
amount of time or resources. Most modern cryptographic systems, such as 
RSA and ECC, are computationally secure. Their security could potentially be 
compromised by future advancements in computing power.

Public-Key Quantum Money
Basic Protocol
The essence of public-key quantum money lies in creating a money state that can 
be efficiently produced by the bank (mint) and verified by the merchant, yet is 

11.3 Quantum Bomb and Quantum Money 
324
infeasible to duplicate under both quantum and classical computational security 
frameworks.
This system combines quantum computing with classical cryptography to enable 
a secure and decentralized protocol. The fundamental steps are:
1. Money State Generation: The bank generates a quantum coin (banknote) with 
a distinct serial number s, a quantum money state |$s), and a corresponding 
verification protocol Ps . These components must satisfy:
(a) The quantum state |$s) consistently passes the verification test defined 
by Ps .
(b) The verification protocol Ps is non-destructive, preserving the state |$s) 
post-verification.
(c) It is computationally infeasible for a potential counterfeiter, even with 
access to both |$s) and Ps, to replicate the quantum state such that both 
originals and duplicates pass Ps .
The bank publishes a registry of valid serial numbers {s} along with their 
associated verification protocols {Ps }.
2. Issuance to Customer: The bank issues the quantum coin |$s), along with its 
serial number s, to a customer.
3. Public Verification: The authenticity of |$s) can be verified by anyone through 
two criteria: (1) confirming that the serial number s is publicly listed and (2) 
validating that |$s) satisfies the publicly accessible protocol Ps.
4. Transaction Confirmation: The quantum money is accepted by the recipient, 
and the transaction is deemed complete, if both criteria are successfully met.
While conceptually appealing, the practical implementation of public-key quan­
tum money faces hurdles, such as the need for durable quantum memories and 
efficient, error-tolerant quantum operations. Furthermore, developing a practical 
realization of the tuple (s, |$s) ,Ps) that fulfills all the stated requirements, even 
under computational security, remains a formidable challenge.
A Basic Implementation Scheme
Implementing public-key quantum money is an intricate task, involving quantum 
computing, advanced mathematics, and cryptography. We present a simplified, 
abstract protocol to highlight key concepts and challenges. Each step here is 
non-trivial:
1. Set Partition: Begin with a vast set of quantum states, such as:
B = {|i)}, with i e [1, 2n], where n = 1024. 
(11.46)
Choose a large subset T of B, but significantly smaller than B, for instance,
T C B, 
|T| = 2 2. 
(11.47)
Define a many-to-one function f :
f : B ^ T,
(11.48)

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
325
such that f 1 (t) has a substantial number of preimages for any t e T, say,
N = B = 2 n. 
(11.49)
ITI 
V '
2. Oneway Function: Ensure that computing f(b) is feasible in polynomial time, 
whereas finding f-1 (t) is infeasible, even with quantum resources, for large n.
3. Money Generation: Under the aforementioned conditions, the bank generates 
money states and serial numbers as follows:
a. Create a uniform superposition of all states in B:
I*0>  = 
■' 
E Ib>|0), 
(11.50)
V 1B1 b e b
where |0) is an n-qubit register initialized to zero.
b. Compute f into the second register:
I*1>  = 
£ Ib>I f (b» . 
(11.51)
IBI beB
c. Measure the second register to obtain a value s, collapsing the state to 
(see § 6.4.3 for a detailed explanation):
I*2>  = -= E Ib>Is>. 
(11.52)
N beB
f (b)=s
The random measurement outcome s from {f (b)} can be used as the 
serial number, with the first register of I^2) as the money state I$s):
I$s> = -^ E Ib>. 
(11.53)
N beB 
f(b)=s
Since f-1(t) is assumed to be computationally hard, I$s) is infeasible to 
compute from s.
4. Public Verification: An authentic I$s) is a uniform superposition of all I b)’s 
for which f(b) = s. Verification involves two key aspects:
a. Alignment with the Serial Number: The money state I$s) should be such 
that when f is applied to each I b) in the superposition, the output consis­
tently equals s. This can be implemented as an eigenvalue relationship 
f (I$s, 1)) = s I$s, 1), where f is the quantum version of f.
b. Fidelity of the Superposition: In the scheme presented here, I$s) must 
be a full, uniform superposition of all Ib)’s such that f (b) = s, not just a 
single state or a different superposition.

11.3 Quantum Bomb and Quantum Money 
326
The bank consolidates this verification method into a verification operator Ps , 
and publishes its formula along with the serial number s. The verification 
protocol must be implemented such that replicating the quantum state |$s) is 
computationally infeasible, even with access to both s and Ps .
For instance, knot-invariance based quantum money, as in [41], utilizes Alexan­
der polynomials for the function f . It employs a superposition of all possible 
Reidemeister moves — elementary transformations preserving knot invariance 
— to ensure that |$s) is a full, uniform superposition.
6 * Current Development
Quantum Money Protocols
A variety of quantum money protocols have been proposed, with many experiencing 
subsequent cryptographic breaks. Key contributions in this area (as of 2023) include:
• Farhi, Gosset, Hassidim, Lutomirski, Shor, 2009: based on knot invariants [41].
• Aaronson and Christiano, 2012: predicated on subspaces [12] (proven broken).
• Mark Zhandry, 2017: rooted in complexity-theoretic foundations [96] (proven 
broken).
• Kane, Sharif, Silverberg, 2018, 2021: utilizing quaternion algebra [57].
• Shor, Khesin, Lu, 2021, 2022: founded on lattice cryptography [59] (proven 
broken).
For a more comprehensive understanding, consult the following works:
• Another round of breaking and making quantum money [67].
• Cryptanalysis of three quantum money schemes [24].
Quantum Lightning
Quantum lightning [96] is a concept related to quantum money, representing an 
even stronger version of it. In a quantum money scheme, the bank (or mint) issues 
quantum banknotes that are hard to counterfeit due to their quantum properties. 
The mint is the only entity that can produce these valid banknotes, and anyone can 
verify their authenticity.
In contrast, quantum lightning takes this concept further by ensuring that not 
even the mint can duplicate the banknotes once they are issued. Each quantum 
banknote in a quantum lightning scheme is unique and cannot be reproduced, not 
even by the issuer. This feature offers a higher level of security and uniqueness for 
each banknote.
Quantum lightning is still a theoretical concept and part of ongoing research 
in quantum cryptography. It presents significant challenges in terms of practical 
implementation and security proof.
Post-Quantum Cryptography
Cryptosystems fundamentally rely on mathematically challenging problems. Such 
problems vary widely and lead to a diverse set of cryptosystems, including RSA, 
discrete logarithm, lattices, multivariate equations, knapsack problems, decoding 
challenges, among others.

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler 
327
Although most of these schemes are characterized by lengthy public keys, RSA 
and discrete logarithm based systems have gained popularity primarily due to 
their shorter key lengths. This advantage is often attributable to the structured 
mathematics underlying these schemes. Ironically, this very structure renders 
them vulnerable to quantum attacks, particularly through the application of Shor’s 
algorithm.
In light of this, lattice-based cryptography has emerged as a frontrunner in 
post-quantum cryptographic research. It offers a balanced combination of security, 
efficiency, and speed.
For additional resources on this subject, refer to:
• Post-quantum cryptosystems for Internet-of-Things: A survey on lattice-based 
algorithms [14].
• The science and information organization [42].
• Evaluation and comparison of lattice-based cryptosystems for a secure quantum 
computing era [77].
Significance of the Field
The advent of quantum computing has cast a dual shadow on the field of 
cryptography. On one hand, Shor’s algorithm poses a significant challenge by 
threatening the integrity of classical encryption schemes through efficient integer 
factorization. On the other hand, quantum computing furnishes a suite of 
novel techniques that bolster encryption and security protocols. This positions 
quantum computing not merely as a disruptive force but also as an enabling 
technology. A prime example of such an innovation is quantum money.
Quantum money transcends its role as a singular cryptographic construct 
and serves as an elemental foundation for various unclonable cryptographic 
architectures. It underpins more elaborate protocols like quantum copy protection 
and chainless blockchain systems. Consequently, mastering the subtleties of 
quantum money serves as a seminal vehicle for a comprehensive understanding 
of quantum cryptography at large.
The study of quantum money bears significance that extends well beyond 
the conventional bounds of encryption and security. It functions as a versatile 
instrument for securing a wide array of digital assets, rendering them virtually 
induplicable. This places quantum money at the confluence of quantum com­
puting, cryptography, and information theory, and opens up new horizons for 
secure, efficient, and verifiable transactions in the quantum epoch.
Such multifaceted relevance elevates the subject of quantum money from a 
point of theoretical interest to a pivotal research area that has the potential to 
reshape the landscape of secure transactions and information exchange in the 
future.

Transitioning from foundational algorithms, we examined the state of the art in 
quantum computing as of early 2024, spanning from NISQ devices to the nascent 
era of quantum utility. We focused on Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithms, 
highlighting their role in navigating the limitations of NISQ technologies and the 
emerging utility-era systems.

The chapter then transitioned to explore algorithms particularly relevant to the 
NISQ era, focusing on solving the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization 
(QUBO) problem. We introduced the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) 
and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), both tailored 
to operate within the constraints of current-day quantum devices. By employing 
these algorithms, we attempted to solve problems of practical significance, like the 
Max-Cut problem, thereby demonstrating their utility in real-world applications.

11.6 The Number Partitioning Problem (NPP) poses the following question: 
Given a set ofN positive numbers S = {ni, . . . , nN}, can this set be partitioned 
into two disjoint subsets, such that the sums of the numbers in each subset 
are equal? For instance, is it possible to evenly divide a collection of assets 
with values ni , . . . , nN between two individuals?
This problem can be modeled using an Ising Hamiltonian expressed as:
H = 
niZi 
,
i=i
where Zi represents the spin variable associated with the i-th number, taking 
values of either +1 or -1.
A solution to the NPP corresponds to a configuration of the Ising model 
where H = 0. Such a configuration ensures that the sum of the numbers ni 

Problem Set 11
330
corresponding to the +1 spins is equal to the sum of the numbers for the -1 
spins. Consequently, if the ground state energy of the system is H = 0, the 
set S can be partitioned as described in the problem statement.
Your task is to create an array of N random integers and determine whether 
a fair partition is possible. You are to find solutions using QAOA or VQE, 
implemented on platforms such as Qiskit or Cirq, or via a quantum annealer. 
Choose a value of N that is practical for the quantum computing resources 
available to you, ensuring that N > 10 to render the problem significant.
11.7 The Graph Coloring Problem (GCP) is a well-known challenge in both 
computer science and discrete mathematics. It entails the assignment of colors 
to the vertices of a graph in such a way that adjacent vertices are not colored 
the same, with the aim often being to minimize the total number of colors 
used. This problem finds practical applications in a variety of fields, including 
scheduling, resource allocation, frequency assignment in mobile networks, and 
register allocation in compiler design.
Formulating as a CUBO Problem
The GCP can be effectively formulated as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem 
(CSP), which is then convertible into a Combinatorial Unconstrained Binary 
Optimization (CUBO) problem, as detailed in § 11.2. This conversion involves 
several steps:
(a) Define Binary Variables: For a graph comprising V vertices, and with 
the intention to use K colors, a binary variable xi,k is defined for each 
combination of vertex i and color k. Here, xi,k = 1 indicates that vertex 
i is assigned color k, and xi,k = 0 otherwise.
(b) Objective Function: The CUBO formulation for the GCP prioritizes 
optimization in the absence of direct constraints on the binary variables. 
The main goal here is to minimize a particular metric or to satisfy certain 
conditions that are implicitly encoded within these variables. In the 
case of the GCP, it is crucial to encode constraints ensuring that no two 
adjacent vertices share the same color.
(c) Incorporate Constraints: Constraints are integrated into the objective 
function in the form of penalties. The primary constraints are as follows:
• Ensure each vertex is assigned just one color: xi,k = 1 for all i. 
k=1
• Prevent adjacent vertices from sharing the same color: xi,k + Xj,k < 1 
for every edge (i, j) in the graph, applicable across all colors k.
Introducing penalty terms for these constraint violations allows the GCP 
to be modeled as a CUBO problem, with the objective of minimizing the 
total penalty to ideally achieve a value of zero when a valid coloring is 
found. This strategy is akin to the approach employed in solving the 
Traveling Salesman Problem, as elucidated in § 11.2.5.
Mapping to the Ising Model
The Ising model, as introduced in § 11.2.2, describes ferromagnetism through 
a mathematical framework but extends its utility to quantum computing. It 

Chapter 11. Quantum Algorithms: A Sampler
331
characterizes systems using discrete spin variables, which can assume states of 
either +1 or -1, with the system’s energy defined by the interactions among 
these spin pairs and any external magnetic fields.
Mapping the CUBO formulation of the GCP onto the Ising model involves 
the following procedures:
(a) Variable Transformation: The binary variables xi,k are transformed into 
spin variables Zi,k, following the relation xi,k = (Zi,k + 1)/2. This step 
converts the binary {0, 1} representation into spin states {-1, +1}.
(b) Energy Function: Constraints and the objective function from the CUBO 
model are translated into an energy function within the Ising model. 
Consequently, each component of the CUBO objective that relies on 
binary variables is mapped to a corresponding term in the Ising energy 
function, dependent on spin variables. The penalty terms for constraint 
violations manifest as interaction terms among spins.
(c) Minimization Objective: The ultimate aim is to identify the spin config­
uration (the Ising model solution) that minimizes the energy function, 
which correlates with the optimal or a feasible solution for the original 
GCP.
QAOA, VQE, and quantum annealers, as discussed in §§ 11.2.4 and 11.2.6, 
are proficient in minimizing such Ising models, thus facilitating the resolution 
of GCPs on quantum computing platforms. In the simple encoding scheme 
explained above, referred to as the ‘one-hot encoding’, for a graph with n 
vertices and the goal of employing k distinct colors, a total of kn qubits are 
needed.
Quantum algorithms such as QAOA VQE, and quantum annealing discussed 
in §§ 11.2.4 and 11.2.6, are effective in minimizing Ising models that represent 
combinatorial optimization problems like the GCP. The one-hot encoding 
scheme, as described above, allows quantum computing platforms to address 
GCP by allocating a unique set of qubits to represent each possible color for 
every vertex. This approach requires a total of kn qubits for a graph with 
n vertices to be colored using k distinct colors. More efficient schemes, such 
binary encoding for the colors, also exist.
Your Tasks
You are tasked with generating a random graph containing n vertices and 
exploring its colorability with 3 distinct colors. You should formulate this 
problem according to the guidelines provided and seek solutions employing 
QAOA or VQE, utilizing platforms such as Qiskit or Cirq, or through a 
quantum annealer. Select an n that is feasible given the constraints of the 
system at your disposal, yet ensure n > 6 for the exercise to be meaningful.
11.8 Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb-Test Algorithm The following topics build upon 
the core idea of the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-tester (detailed in § 11.3.1 and 
§ 11.3.2.3)—gathering information without direct interaction—to push the 
boundaries of what’s possible within quantum mechanics. Researchers continue 
to explore these concepts not only theoretically but also experimentally, which 
could lead to new technologies and protocols in quantum information science.

Problem Set 11
332
Investigate two of the following topics, and prepare a presentation on each, 
discussing its concept, principles, applications, and current status.
(a) Quantum Zeno Effect: The Quantum Zeno Effect can be seen as an 
extension where frequent observations prevent the evolution of a quantum 
state. It has been proposed that by frequently checking for the presence 
of the bomb (the system’s state), one can effectively freeze its evolution, 
leading to a form of interaction-free measurement.
(b) Counterfactual Quantum Computation: This application allows for com­
putation to occur without running the computer in the traditional sense. 
It uses the principles of quantum superposition and interference to infer 
the result of a computation without actually performing all the steps 
physically.
(c) Counterfactual Quantum Communication: This method of transmit­
ting information without particles traveling between the sender and 
receiver exploits quantum entanglement and the principles behind the 
Elitzur-Vaidman bomb-tester to achieve communication that is effectively 
“interaction-free.”
(d) Chained Quantum Zeno Effect: A series of interaction-free measurements 
can be chained together to create a more complex system that can perform 
tasks such as imaging or communication with a lower chance of interaction 
than the original setup.
(e) Counterfactual Cryptography: Inspired by the bomb-tester, this extension 
involves secure communication where the presence of an eavesdropper can 
be detected without any qubits carrying the information directly from 
the sender to the receiver.

In this chapter, we undertake a comprehensive examination of Quantum Error 
Correction (QEC) in the realm of quantum computing. We commence by discussing 
the mathematical underpinnings of density operators, before transitioning to an 
exploration of both coherent and incoherent errors. The chapter culminates with

12.1 Preliminary Concepts
334
an analysis of Shor Codes, a pioneering approach in quantum error correction. The 
primary objective is to equip the reader with a thorough understanding of the errors 
that afflict quantum systems and the methodologies available to amend them. This 
knowledge is essential for advancing both the theoretical and practical facets of 
quantum computing.
12.1 Preliminary Concepts
Error correction in quantum computing is a multifaceted topic that necessitates a 
foundational understanding of certain core concepts.
1 The Noise Problem: An Illustrative Example
To elucidate the impact of noise, consider a quantum computer programmed to 
generate the Bell state |$+) = 
(|00) + |11)):
w-k 
0 —
= i 
j<]=j
In an ideal setting devoid of noise, measurements would invariably yield ij = 00 
and 11 with equal probabilities. Contrarily, a real-world, noise-impacted system 
might also produce outcomes such as 01 and 10, albeit with lower probabilities like 
1%. Such deviations manifest due to noise, which disrupts the quantum state and 
results in aberrant measurement outcomes.
2 
Decoherence, Noise, and Error: Definitions and Distinctions
The terms “decoherence,” “noise,” and “error” are often used interchangeably, yet 
each has a distinct meaning in quantum computing.
• Decoherence: Decoherence arises from the inevitable interaction between a 
quantum system and its surrounding environment, leading to a loss of quantum 
coherence (i.e., superposition). It is often modeled using density operators and 
is responsible for the transition of quantum states from pure to mixed.
• Noise: Noise encompasses all undesired transformations that quantum states 
may undergo during computation, stemming from various factors such as 
decoherence, control errors, and thermal fluctuations. Quantum channels and 
their associated Kraus operators are often employed to model noise.
• Error: An error in quantum computing refers to the deviation between the 
actual and expected outputs of a computation. Such errors typically stem 
from noise and are categorized as either coherent, which are correctable 
through calibration, or incoherent, which are less predictable and therefore 
more challenging to manage.
3 
From NISQ to Fault Tolerance
The evolution of quantum computing is characterized by distinct phases, each 
representing a leap forward in capability and application. Currently transitioning 
from the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the field is moving towards 
an interim phase known as the “era of quantum utility,” eventually leading to the 
ultimate goal of full fault tolerance.

The NISQ Era
Quantum computing is currently marked by limitations in qubit count and coherence 
times. Amid the ongoing quest for quantum advantage, research is mainly focused 
on algorithmic strategies that are compatible with these NISQ constraints.

The Era of Quantum Utility
As we step into the quantum utility era (circa 2024), quantum computing begins to 
assert its potential as a transformative technology. This phase is characterized by 
quantum computers not only solving problems that exceed the capabilities of brute 
force classical simulations but also surpassing classical systems that employ problem­
specific approximation methods. This era is not merely a testament to quantum 
computing’s theoretical prowess but also marks its evolution as an indispensable 
tool for scientific exploration.
The quantum utility era is distinguished by its ability to deliver reliable and 
substantial computations for large-scale problems, which were previously deemed 
infeasible without quantum intervention. With the maturation of quantum hardware, 
we are now witnessing quantum systems reliably handling simulation tasks involving 
more than 100 qubits. This milestone is underscored by the emergence of numerous 
“utility scale experiments,” which collectively signify a paradigm shift. These 
experiments represent not just a leap in quantum computational capacity but also 
highlight the role of quantum systems in offering novel solutions and perspectives in 
tackling complex problems. References such as [19, 35, 43, 62, 81, 92, 93] elucidate 
these advancements.
As we navigate through this era, the expectation is not just the enhancement of 
computational capabilities but the realization of significant, practical computational 
advantages. Quantum systems, in this phase, are anticipated to deliver not just 
solutions but also tangible utility, addressing real-world challenges and enriching the 
landscape of computational science.

12.1 Preliminary Concepts
336
Quantum Utility, Advantage, and Supremacy
Quantum Utility refers to the stage where quantum computers begin to solve 
complex, real-world problems, offering useful solutions beyond the capabilities of 
classical computers.
Quantum Advantage is achieved when a quantum computer outperforms classical 
computers for specific practical tasks, delivering solutions with superior speed, cost­
effectiveness, or accuracy.
Quantum Supremacy is the threshold where a quantum computer solves a 
problem that is infeasible for classical computers within a reasonable time frame. 
While it’s a significant demonstration of the potential of quantum computing, 
the specific problems solved may not have immediate practical applications or 
commercial viability.
Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing
The Accuracy Threshold Theorem is a foundational principle in quantum error 
correction (QEC), suggesting that Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC) is 
attainable when the error rate per physical qubit and gate operation is suppressed 
below a certain critical threshold, denoted by eth. Achieving error rates below 
this threshold enables the effective logical error rate to be substantially reduced, 
potentially to arbitrarily low levels.
The precise threshold value, eth , is contingent upon the specific error-correcting 
code employed and the noise model assumed. Present-day quantum devices generally 
exhibit error rates between 10-2 and 10-3. Recent advances in error-correcting 
codes and error management strategies, like the conversion of general errors into 
more tractable erasure errors, have fostered optimism that achieving error rates 
around 10-3 could soon render practical error correction viable. Nonetheless, further 
reduction of the error rate would significantly alleviate the overhead, particularly 
reducing the ratio of physical qubits required per logical qubit.
4 
Strategies for Error Handling
Several strategies are employed to manage errors as we transition from NISQ devices 
to fully fault-tolerant quantum computing:
• Error Suppression: This approach involves modifying control signals or in­
corporating additional ones to suppress errors at their source, ensuring that 
quantum processors produce the intended outcomes more reliably.
• Error Mitigation: Techniques such as Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) and 
Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) aim to reduce or neutralize the impact 
of noise on the calculated expected values. While error mitigation has shown 
promise in systems with the order of 100 qubits, it faces an exponential increase 
in overhead as the system size grows, rendering it less feasible for very large 
quantum systems.
• Error Correction: The cornerstone of fault-tolerant quantum computing, error 
correction involves a set of operations and measurements designed to identify 
and correct errors without compromising the quantum information. The 
overhead for error correction scales polylogarithmically with the size of the 
quantum system, making it a viable strategy for scaling to larger, fault-tolerant 
quantum computers.

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer 
337
• Error Simulation: Simulating errors provides critical insights into the perfor­
mance of quantum algorithms under realistic, noisy conditions. This strategy 
supports the refinement of both quantum hardware and error correction proto­
cols, facilitating the development of more robust quantum computing systems.
5 
Challenges of Quantum Error Correction
Error correction in quantum computing presents a fundamentally more complex 
challenge than in classical computing. This arises from a few key properties inherent 
to quantum mechanics:
• Superposition: Quantum bits (qubits) can exist in a superposition of states, in 
contrast to classical bits that are strictly binary. This added layer of complexity 
widens the scope for potential errors, as undesirable changes in the relative 
probabilities of the states could occur.
• Entanglement: The phenomenon of entanglement means that the state of one 
qubit can be inexplicably linked with the state of another. Consequently, an 
error in one qubit can reverberate through its entangled partners, making error 
detection and correction more intricate.
• No-Cloning Theorem: The no-cloning theorem (see § 5.1.3) states that it is 
impossible to duplicate an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This princi­
ple negates the common classical error correction practice of data copying, 
rendering it unviable for quantum data.
• Measurement Disturbs Superposition: The act of measuring a qubit disrupts 
its superposition, collapsing it into one of its basis states (0 or 1). The mere 
action of checking a qubit for an error can irreversibly alter its state, potentially 
eliminating the superposition necessary for computation.
6 
The Path Forward
As we navigate the evolving landscape of quantum computing, several interrelated 
challenges emerge as central to advancing the field:
• Quantum Error Correction and Fault Tolerance: These remain foundational 
to the viability of quantum computing. Current research efforts are aimed at 
minimizing qubit overhead and developing innovative error-correcting codes 
that can more efficiently protect quantum information against errors.
• Enhancing Quantum Coherence and Control: Achieving extended coherence 
times, high-fidelity gate operations, effective decoherence control, and overall 
clock speed is crucial. These factors are not only vital for successful error 
correction but also for executing large-scale quantum algorithms. Addition­
ally, specific error types such as coherent, calibration, state preparation, and 
measurement errors fall outside the purview of traditional QEC and must be 
addressed through other means to ensure overall system reliability.
• Scalability and System Integration: As we aim to increase the number of qubits, 
the challenges of scalability and system integration become more pronounced. 
This pillar focuses on the architectural and connectivity solutions required to 
manage an expanding quantum system effectively.
• Quantum Software and Algorithm Development: Parallel to hardware ad­
vancements, the creation of sophisticated quantum software and algorithms is 

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps
338
essential. This research avenue is dedicated to building the computational tools 
and frameworks necessary to harness the full potential of quantum computing.
These four aspects collectively define the critical path from the NISQ era to 
large-scale, practical, and fault-tolerant quantum computing.
12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps
To model a diverse range of quantum operations, including both pure and noisy 
quantum states, a more comprehensive representation beyond state vectors and 
unitary gates is needed. Such generalization is particularly useful for capturing the 
effects of noise, decoherence, or entanglement with an external environment. Density 
operators, also known as density matrices, and the associated mixed quantum states, 
serve as this general mathematical framework. This framework serves as an essential 
tool in quantum information and communication.
12.2.1 Definitions
1 For Pure Quantum States
Until now, we have utilized state vectors, denoted as |^), to describe quantum 
systems. However, these systems can also be characterized using a density operator 
p. For a quantum system isolated from its environment and in a pure state, the 
density operator is simply the outer product of the state vector |^) with itself. 
Formally, we define it as:
P = | $ X $ | ■
(12.1)
■ Example 12.1 Consider |+) = —2 (|0) + |1)). The corresponding density operator 
is:
111
P =21 1
(12.2)
■
■ Example 12.2 For |^) = a |0) + P 11), the density operator is:
p=
|a|2
Pa *
ap * 
| P |2
(12.3)
■
The state vectors |^) and ei^ |^), with $ a real number, yield identical density 
operators, thereby demonstrating that density operators inherently account for the 
physical irrelevance of the global phase in quantum state vectors.
Exercise 12.1 Show that for a pure state, p2 = p, i.e., p is a rank-1 projection 
operator.
Exercise 12.2 Derive the density operator for the Bell state |$+) = -12(|00) +111)).

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
339
2 For Mixed Quantum States
There are instances where the exact state of a quantum system cannot be definitively 
ascertained. Such a system may exist in any of n pure quantum states | ^i), each with 
a classical probability pi . In these cases, the density operator provides a convenient 
representation:
P = EPi |1>i)(1>i| ■ 
(12.4)
Here, the density operator for the mixed quantum state serves as a weighted 
average of the density operators for its constituent pure states.
■ Example 12.3 Suppose a lab prepares an ensemble of quantum states: |0) with a 
probability of 7 and |1) with a probability of 7. This defines a mixed state described 
by:
34
P =7 |0><0| + 7 |1><1| ■ 
(12.5)
Note that this is completely different from the pure state 7 |0) + 7 |1) (not 
normalized) or 3 |0) + 5 |1) (normalized). 
■
As demonstrated in the following exercise, n can be different from d, the dimension 
of the Hilbert space of |^i). However, p is always a d x d matrix.
Exercise 12.3 A machine produces the state |0) 25% of the time, the state |1) 
25% of the time, and the state |+) 50% of the time. Find the density operator of 
the qubit.
■ Example 12.4 — The Uniform Mixed State. The density operator for a mixed 
state with equal probabilities (50%) of being in |0) and |1) is given by:
110
P =20 1
(12.6)
For a d-dimensional qudit, the density operator for the uniform mixed state is
P—dI x d
(12.7)
Remarkably, the density operator for a mixed state with 50% probability in + 
and 50% probability in |—) yields the same matrix. The same holds true for a mixed 
state with 50% probability in an arbitrary state |^) and 50% in its orthogonal state 
| ^ ± )•
Hence, the density operator for the uniform mixed state is basis-invariant. This 
characteristic can be contrasted with the density operator for |+), as discussed in 
Example 12.1, which is not basis-invariant. 
■

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps 
340
Exercise 12.4 Show that the mixed state with 50% probability in an arbitrary 
state |^) and 50% in its orthogonal state |^±) has a dentity operator p = 2 I.
Density Operator of Density Operators
A density operator can also be expressed as a linear combination of other density 
operators. For example, consider two density operators p1 and p2 , which themselves 
could be representing mixed states. A new density operator can be formed as:
p' = q 1P1 + q 2 P 2, 
(12-8)
where q 1 + q2 = 1 and q 1 ,q2 > 0. In this case, p' is a convex combination of p 1 and 
P2 . Each of these density operators, P1 and P2 , could in turn be a weighted average 
of density operators for pure states. Then p' is also ultimately a weighted average of 
density operators for pure states.
3 Distinguishing Pure and Mixed States
The above example underscores an important point: although |+) and the uniform 
mixed state both yield probabilities of 50% for measurements in the computational 
basis, they can be distinguished in other bases. For instance, |+) can be identified 
unambiguously in the {|+), |—)} basis, whereas the uniform mixed state cannot. In 
general, pure states and mixed states can be distinguished in this manner.
Another criterion for distinguishing pure and mixed states is based on the value 
of the “purity” parameter:
0 <y = tr(p2) < 1. 
(12.9)
For a pure state, we have p2 = p, leading to y = 1. On the other hand, for a mixed 
state, y < 1; for a d-dimensional uniform mixed state, y reaches its minimum at d.
12.2.2 Interpretation and Properties
1 
Diagonal and Off-diagonal Elements
The diagonal elements of a density operator p denote the probabilities of the system 
being observed in each of the basis states after a measurement. Specifically, the 
element pii = {i | p | i) gives the probability of detecting the system in the state | i).
The off-diagonal elements, pij for i = j , encapsulate the coherences between states 
|i) and |j), characterizing the system’s quantum superpositions. These elements 
may be complex, and both their magnitudes and phases are important, carrying 
information about the coherence of the superposition states.
The underlying reason for the above properties is demonstrated in Example 12.2 
for pure states. This reasoning also applies to mixed states, as they are statistical 
mixtures of pure states, preserving these diagonal and off-diagonal characteristics in 
their density operators.
2 
Diagonal Form
In its eigenbasis, a density operator p becomes diagonal, with eigenvalues representing 
the probabilities of the system residing in each eigenstate:

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer 
341
P = 
Xi |Xi}(Xi|. 
(12.10)
Each engenstate of p is a pure state | Xi). The diagonal form of p represents the 
probability distribution of the system state across these eigenstates.
This diagonal form highlights the system’s probabilistic nature:
• In a pure state, P has exactly one diagonal element equal to 1, reflecting 
absolute certainty about the system’s quantum state.
• For a mixed state, P has multiple non-zero diagonal elements, with each 
representing the probability of the system being found in a particular eigenstate.
Exercise 12.5 The state of a quantum system is such that it is 50% in the state 
|+) and 50% in the state |0). Find the diagonal form of its density operator.
3 
Basic Properties
Density operators exhibit several key characteristics that confirm their suitability 
for physical interpretations:
1. Hermiticity: p = p'L This property guarantees that the eigenvalues of p, which 
are the probabilities in its eigenbasis, are real.
2. Unit Trace: tr(p) = 1. This reflects the total probability axiom, as the trace 
of p sums the probabilities for all possible outcomes of a measurement, which 
must equal one.
3. Positive Semi-Definiteness: For any vector |$) in the Hilbert space, ($|p|$) > 0. 
This ensures that all eigenvalues of p are non-negative, thus validating that 
probabilities derived from p are always non-negative.
These properties are foundational, ensuring that density operators provide a 
consistent and physically plausible framework for quantum states, aligned with 
the postulates of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the converse is also true: any 
operator (or matrix) satisfying these properties can represent a quantum state, be it 
pure or mixed.

Composition Property
Consider two independent systems, represented by pA and pB . The density operator 
of the composite system can be expressed as a tensor product of their individual 
density operators, pAB = pA ® pB. A proof is outlined below:
pA ® pB = XX papb d bA * bA D ® d bB' > bB' D

(12.13c)
Note that this composition property holds true only for independent systems. In 
the case of dependent systems, such as entangled systems, the joint density operator 
pAB of a general bipartite composite system may not be expressible as the tensor 
product of two individual density operators.

Probabilities and Expected Values
The density operator provides a complete description of the quantum state, enabling 
the determination of outcome probabilities for any system measurement. Observable 
operators facilitate the extraction of measurable properties from this state, with 
physical quantities typically represented as statistical averages or expected values of 
these observables.
Measurement Probabilities
The probability of a system described by the density operator p being found in any 
pure state |b) is given by the expected value of the projection onto that state:
P = (b 1 p1 b) ■ 
(12.14)
This equation is valid for any pure state |b), not just the basis states {|bi)} in 
which p is expressed. We suggest that the reader verify this as an exercise.

compute the probability of measuring the system in the state |+) using Eq. 12.14.
# Similarity Between Mixed States
In general, there is no direct probability measure of one mixed state within 
another, but there are measures of similarity and distinguishability:
Fidelity
The fidelity between two density matrices p and p' is a common measure of similarity.
It is defined as:
F(P,P') = (trVVPP'Vp^ . 
(12.15)
Fidelity equals 1 if and only if p = p', and it decreases as the states become 
more distinguishable.
Trace Distance
Another measure is the trace distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of 
two quantum states. It is given by:
D(p,p') = 1tr|p - p'|, 
(12.16)
where | A | = VAtA. The trace distance ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 means the 
states are identical and 1 means they are completely distinguishable.
2 Expected Values of Observables
For a pure quantum state represented by | ^), the expected value of an observable A 
is calculated as:
{A} = {$1 A 1 $} ■
(12.17)
In the case of mixed quantum states, the situation is more intricate as the system 
may exist in multiple states |^n) with corresponding classical probabilities pn. The 
expected value for a mixed state is essentially the weighted average of the expected 
values for its constituent pure states:
(A} = 52 pn ^n । A । ^n ’
(12.18)
It is noteworthy that the expected value for an observable in a mixed state can 
be concisely expressed using the trace operation on the density operator p:
(A} = tr( Ap).
(12.19)
Proof. The following steps show that tr(Ap) = (A):

Compare to (X), {Yand (Z) for the pure state |+).
12.2.4 * General Single-Qubit States in the Bloch Sphere
1 
General Single-Qubit States
Since the Pauli matrices {I, X, Y, Z} form a complete orthogonal basis in C2x2, an 
arbitrary single-qubit density operator can be decomposed as:
p = 1( al + xX + yY + zZ), 
(12.21)
where the coefficients are given by the inner products of {I, X, Y, Z} with p (defined 
as A • B = tr(A^B)):
a = tr(pI), x = tr(pX), y = tr(pY), z = tr(pZ). 
(12.22)
According to Eq. 12.19, tr(pA) equals to the expectation values of A. Therefore,
a = (I) = 1, x = (X) ,y = (Y) ,z = (Z). 
(12.23)
Thus, we have the following important identity for single-qubit states:
p = 2(I + (X) X + (Y) X + (Z) X) 
(12.24)
Exercise 12.9 The state of a quantum system is such that it is 50% in the state 
|+) and 50% in the state |0). Determine the Pauli representation of this quantum 
state.
2 
Representation in the Bloch Sphere
According to Eq. 12.21, a single qubit state, pure or mixed, is uniquely identified 
by a vector r = (x, y, z), known as the polarization vector of the qubit. For a pure 
state representing a spin in the direction specified by spherical coordinate angles 
(0,^), the expectation values are given by (see § 3.2.3):

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
345
Figure 12.2: Mixed State Inside the Bloch Sphere
x = sin 0 cos $, y = sin 0 sin $, z = r cos 0. 
(12.25)
Generalizing this, we can interpret r geometrically as:
r = (r sin 0 cos $, r sin 0 sin $, r cos 0). 
(12.26)
where r2 = x2 + y2 + z2 < 1.
Therefore, while a pure state corresponds to a point on the Bloch sphere (see 
§ 2.4), a mixed state can be represented as a point inside the Bloch sphere, as 
illustrated in Fig. 12.2.
Intuitively, the length of the polarization vector (or Bloch vector), r, gives an 
indication of the “average” behavior of the mixed state. Specifically, r provides a 
measure of the “purity” of the state, varying between 0 and 1. A length of r = 1 
corresponds to pure states, while r < 1 corresponds to mixed states. The closer r is 
to zero, the more mixed the state is.
Mathematically, Eq. 12.24, the density operator of an arbitrary qubit state, can 
be expressed succinctly as:
P =2(I + r • a), 
(12.27)
and Eq. 12.23, the expectation of a in this state, as:
(a} = r, 
(12.28)
where
a =( a i = X,a 2 = Y,a 3 = Z).

the Bloch vector is at the origin of the Bloch sphere. Therefore, the uniform 
mixed state is the maximally mixed qubit state.
Exercise 12.11 Explain why there is a factor 1 in Eqs. 12.21 and 12.27.
* Unitary Evolution
Unitary Transformations
Recall (in Chapter 4) that in a closed quantum system governed by a Hamiltonian 
H, a pure quantum state |^) evolves according to the equation
|t)^ U |t, 
(12.30)
where the unitary operator U is defined as:
U = e -iHt/h. 
(12.31)
Consequently, the density operator p for a mixed state transforms as:
P ^ P' = £PnU |^n)(^n | Ut - 
(12.32)
This can be simplified to:
p ^ p' = UpUt. 
(12.33)
Exercise 12.12 The state of a quantum system is such that it is 50% in the state 
|+) and 50% in the state |0). An X gate is applied to the system. Using the 
above transformation, find the new density operator for the system.
■ Example 12.5 — Application of Pauli Gates. Consider the application of an X 
gate to a general quantum state p = 2 (al+xX+yY+zZ) in the Pauli-decomposition 
representation. Note that x, y, z coincide with the expected values (X), (Y), (Z) 
(see Eq. 12.24). The Pauli X gate, representing a n rotation around the x-axis, 
leaves (X) unchanged but flips the signs of (Y) and (Z). Therefore, X transforms 
(x, y, z) to (x, -y, -z), or,
X 1(al + xX + yY + zZ)X = 2(al + xX - yY - zZ)- 
(12.34)
Extending this to a general rotation around the x-axis, Rx (0) transforms the 
state (x,y, z) to (x,y cos 0, z cos 0).

operator ZX, individually transform a quantum state represented by its Bloch 
vector r = (x, y, z)?

347
2 * The von Neumann Equation
The time evolution of a density operator in a quantum system is governed by the 
von Neumann equation, which is a generalization of the Schrodinger equation for
mixed states. For a pure state |^(t)), governed by the Schrodinger equation:
ihddt |$(t)} = H |$(t)}, 
(12.35)
the corresponding von Neumann equation for the density operator p is given by:
i h dp = [ H,p ], 
(12.36)
derived as follows:
dp = d (|^|) 
(12.37a)
= (ddt |*)}(

| + |*)( d {^|) 
(12.37b)
= -iH | ^ ^ |+ h | ^ ^ | H 
(12.37c)
i
= -- [ H,P ] ■ 
(12.37d)
Given the linearity of quantum mechanics and density operators, this derivation 
extends naturally to mixed states, which are statistical ensembles of pure states, 
validating the von Neumann equation for mixed states as well.
If the Hamiltonian is time-independent, the von Neumann equation has the 
solution
p (t) = e - iHt/h p (0) eiHt/h, 
(12.38)
which mirrors the unitary evolution of density operators (Eq. 12.33).
For a single qubit, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed in the Pauli basis, similar 
to Eq. 12.27:
H = 2(HoI + H • a), 
(12.39)
where a is given by Eq. 12.29.
Then the von Neumann equation leads to:

* Measurements
Transitioning from the ket representation to density operators offers a more en­
compassing description of quantum states. This subsection explores how quantum 
measurement theory (§ 3.4) is adapted to align with the density operator framework. 
We will discuss the characterization of post-measurement states, the emergence of 
mixed states from measurements, measurements in an orthonormal basis, and the 
concept of POVM (Positive Operator-Valued Measure) measurements.
Post-Measurement State
The action of a measurement on a quantum system can be captured through operators 
(see § 3.4.2). For a pure state |^) and a measurement operator Mj, the state after 
measurement is given by:
| ., > Mj |t) 
(12 42)
1 * ’ Mj |t>11 ■ 
( 
)
For a mixed state represented by a density operator p, the transformation is as 
follows:
P ^ P' =
En PnMj |^n^n | Mj 
tr [E n PnMj | ^n )(^n | Mj]
(12.43)
Note that the normalization of a density operator is designed to produce a unity 
trace. This ensures that the probabilities of all possible outcomes of a measurement 
sum to 1. Simplifying using the procedure to prove Eq. 12.20, we obtain:
, 
Mj PMj
P ^ P ' = -------- -
pj
(12.44)
where pj is the normalization factor or the probability of measuring Mj :
Pj = tr (Mj pMj) ■ 
(12.45)

Exercise 12.14 The state of a system, initially 50% in the state |+) and 50% in 
the state |0), is measured in the {|0), |1)} basis, and the outcome |0) is obtained. 
What is the new density operator of the system?
Ensemble of Measurement Outcomes
Instead of considering a single measurement operator Mj , we now extend our focus 
to a complete set of such operators {Mj} (see § 3.4.2) that satisfy the completeness 
condition
Mj Mj = I 
(12.46)
j
The resulting ensemble of measurement outcomes is a mixed state represented 
by a density operator as follows:

Pm = E Pj—-----j ■ 
(12-47)

pj
Here, pj is the probability of measuring Mj given by Eq- 12-45- Apparently, pj 
cancels out, yielding the following crucial relationship:
pM = 
Mj pMj, ■ 
(12-48)
j
The ensemble of measurement outcomes encapsulates the probabilistic nature of 
quantum measurements- The density operator pM represents the statistical mixture 
of all possible states that a quantum system can be in after being subjected to a 
measurement process- It offers a mechanism to represent the measurement and 
superposition principles of quantum mechanics statistically, thereby providing a 
complete picture of the system’s possible states after a measurement-
The concept of the ensemble of measurement outcomes is closely related to the 
phenomenon of measurement-induced decoherence, a process that describes how 
quantum superpositions are reduced to classical mixtures as a result of measurement- 
A quantum system can exist in a superposition of states- When a measurement is 
performed, this superposition appears to collapse to a specific state corresponding to 
the measurement outcome- However, from a more comprehensive perspective, what 
happens is that the system becomes entangled with the measurement apparatus, 
leading to decoherence- The density operator pM describes the state of the system 
after this decoherence has occurred-
Exercise 12.15 The state of a system, initially |+), is measured in the {|0), |1)} 
basis. What is the density operator of the post-measurement ensemble?
3 Measurements in an Orthonormal Basis
Now consider the special case where {Mj } is the set of projection operators corre­
sponding to an orthonormal basis {|tj)}:
Mj = | tjXtj | ■ 
(12-49)
Applying the relationship from Eq. 12.48 for these projectors, we obtain the 
post-measurement mixed state as follows:
Pm = ^2 |tj><tj | P |tj><tj | 
(12-50a)
j
= ^2 <tj | P |tj> |tjXtj | 
(12-50b)

(i2-50c)

where
Pj = {& | p | &} 
(12-51)
is the probability of obtaining the outcome corresponding to | tj }■

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps
350
State Collapse
The matrix pM is diagonal in the basis {|$j)}, containing the probabilities pj as 
its diagonal elements, while all off-diagonal elements are zero. If p was not initially 
diagonal in this basis, then pM will differ from p. This difference is a consequence 
of the measurement process: a projective measurement collapses the system into a 
statistical mixture of the states |$j) weighted by their respective probabilities pj, 
effectively destroying any initial coherences between different basis states present 
in p. Hence, post-measurement, the system’s state is a diagonal mixture of the 
measurement basis states. The system’s final state coincides with the original p if 
and only if p was already diagonal in the chosen measurement basis.
4 POVM Measurements
Measurements in quantum mechanics can be more generally described using Positive 
Operator-Valued Measures (POVMs). A set of POVM operators {Ej } satisfies two 
key conditions: each Ej is positive semidefinite (Ej > 0), and the sum of all POVM 
elements equals the identity operator ( j Ej = I). These conditions guarantee that 
the calculated probabilities will sum to one. In this framework, each Ej corresponds 
to a distinct measurement outcome. The probability pj of observing outcome j is 
given by:
pj = tr(pEj). 
(12.52)
This probability can also be interpreted as the inner product (p,Ej) between the 
density operator p and the POVM element Ej .
In the traditional formulation of quantum measurements using a set of mea­
surement operators {Mj}, each POVM element Ej is expressed as Ej = Mj Mj. 
However, POVM measurements generalize this concept. The set of POVM operators 
{Ej } can have a different cardinality from the dimension of the quantum state p, 
and the POVM elements are not required to be orthogonal. This broader framework 
is more aligned with the principles of quantum information theory.
12.2.7 * CPTP Maps and Quantum Channels
1 
Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) Maps
Unitary evolution, as given by Eq. 12.33, and the quantum measurement process, 
described by Eq. 12.48, both transform the density operator of a quantum state. 
Since density operators must maintain a unit trace and be positive semidefinite, 
such transformations are referred to as Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving 
(CPTP) maps. In general, a CPTP map is an operation that transforms a density 
operator to another which can have a different dimensionality.
Definition
A CPTP map E is a transformation that satisfies the following properties:
• Completely Positive: A map E is said to be positive if for any density operator 
p, the map E(p) preserves the positive semidefiniteness of p, ensuring the 
physical validity of the transformed state.
A map E is defined as completely positive if, when extended to any larger system 
that includes the original system as a subsystem, it preserves the positive

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
351
semidefiniteness of all states in this larger system. Formally, for any density 
operator p of the combined system (the original system plus an auxiliary 
system), the extended map (E ® I)(p) is positive, where I is the identity map 
on the auxiliary system.
• Trace-Preserving: For any density operator p, tr(E (p)) = tr(p). This property 
ensures that the total probability (sum of probabilities of all outcomes) is 
conserved in the transformation.
• Linearity: E (ap + ba) = aE(p) + bE(a) for any density operators p, a, and 
scalars a, b.
Applications
CPTP maps offer a comprehensive framework for describing the dynamics of quantum 
states, and are a fundamental tool in quantum computation and information theory. 
They encompass a wide range of physical processes:
• Unitary Evolutions: Unitary operations, such as the action of quantum gates, 
are reversible and a special case of CPTP maps.
• Quantum Measurements: These maps model the process of quantum measure­
ment, including the decoherence effect, as in Eq. 12.48.
• Simulation of Open Systems. CPTP maps can model open quantum systems 
where interactions with external environments are significant. They facilitate 
the inclusion of auxiliary systems in the analysis, which serve to represent 
environmental effects. In this context, an auxiliary system functions as a 
supplementary quantum system, considered in conjunction with the primary 
system to simulate the combined effect of the environment and the system 
dynamics.
• Reduction of Systems via Partial Trace: CPTP maps can represent the process 
of tracing out part of a quantum system, effectively reducing it to a subsystem. 
The partial trace operation ensures that the reduced state remains a valid 
density operator.
• Other Quantum Operations: These maps include a broad class of quantum 
operations, such as those involving interactions with an environment. These 
operations can lead to various effects like quantum noise, dissipation, and more 
general quantum dynamics beyond purely unitary transformations or simple 
measurements.
2 
Quantum Channels
CPTP maps can be modeled using quantum channels, which are often represented 
by Kraus decompositions or operator-sum representations. A Kraus decomposition 
provides an intuitive and computationally convenient method to express a CPTP 
map by breaking it down into a set of operations on the quantum state. Thus, a 
quantum channel, describing the evolution of a quantum state under a CPTP map, 
is represented as:
E (p ) = E sj Kj pKj, 
(12.53)

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps
352
where the Kj are Kraus operators that describe the quantum channel, and sj is the
probability that the transformation represented by Kj occurs. Here Kj 
have to be a square matrix.
does not
These operators must satisfy the modified completeness relation:
£ Sj Kj Kj = I, 
j
(12.54)
ensuring that the map E is trace-preserving.
An alternative representation, which has the probability sj factored into the 
operator Kj: ^STjKj ^ Kj, and thus does not explicitly use the probabilities Sj, is 
given by:
E (P) = £ Kj pKj,
(12.55)
with the completeness condition:
E Kj Kj = I. 
j
(12.56)
We have seen that quantum measurement can be represented as a Kraus decom­
position in Eq. 12.48. Below are additional examples:
■ Example 12.6 — Bit-Flip Noise Channel. A bit-flip error flips the state of a 
qubit from |0) to |1), or vice versa, with some specified probability, s. It can be 
modeled by applying an X gate, randomly with probability S, as illustrated below:
[— (p=s) —
P 
N (p)
— (p =1 - s) —| I \—.
The Kraus representation for the associated noise channel is:
N(P) = (1- s)IPI + sXPX = (1- s)P + sXPX.
(12.57)
We will delve into such random noise channels in the next section.
■
■ Example 12.7 — Complete Dephasing Noise Channel. Consider the general 
qubit state | ^) = a |0) + P |1) with density operator
■ ,a 11 
F|a|2 aP*
p=। ^x ^ ।=[a *p । ? p] ■
(12.58)
If we measure it in the standard basis, but actually “forget” the outcome, we can 
see that the resulting state will output |0) with output probability |a|2, and output 
|1) with probability |P|2. Thus, the output is:
|a|2 
0
N(P) = 
0 
|p|2 .
(12.59)
The effect is to zero out all the off-diagonal terms in P, thus destroying all 
coherence. This process is often referred to as complete dephasing.

Figure 12.3: Stinespring Dilation: Unitary Embedding of a CPTP Map
Stinespring dilation provides a way to visualize and understand general quantum 
operations (CPTP maps) as unitary evolutions in a larger space, which includes 
the system and the environment. Stinespring dilation and Kraus decomposition are 
mathematically equivalent, yet they provide distinct perspectives on the nature of 
quantum operations.
Stinespring dilation can be illustrated using the quantum circuit in Fig. 12.3. 
In this schematic, qubits in group A are considered the input qubits of the system, 
while those in group E function as ancillary qubits, simulating an environment. The 
combined system A + E is subject to a unitary transformation U . Following this 
transformation, the qubits are categorized into groups A' and E', which correspond 
to the transformed states of A and E, respectively. The qubits in E' are subsequently 
measured (typically in the computational basis) and then discarded (traced out), 
while the remaining qubits in A' constitute the output of the CPTP map.
This process is encapsulated by the Stinespring Dilation Theorem, which asserts 
that any CPTP map can be implemented as a unitary operation on an expanded 
Hilbert space that includes an ancillary system, followed by tracing out some degrees 
of freedom—specifically, those associated with the environment. This theorem 
demonstrates that operations which appear non-unitary, such as decoherence or 
measurement, can be modeled within the framework of unitary quantum mechanics 
by accounting for interactions with an ancillary system or external environment.
Formally, the Stinespring Dilation Theorem states that given a CPTP map 
E acting on a state p in system A, there exists an ancillary system E, a unitary 
operation U, and a state |^) in the combined system such that:
E(p) =trE (U(p ® |^)(^|)Uf) , 
(12.60)

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps
354
where trE denotes the partial trace (discussed in § 12.2.8) over the ancillary system 
E, effectively capturing the essence of the CPTP map’s action on the state p.
A common question arises: If unitary operations are inherently reversible, does 
that imply CPTP maps, including processes like decoherence, are also reversible? 
The answer is “No.” The key lies in the irreversible act of tracing out the environment 
subsystem E' after the unitary operation. This step, essential for modeling the effect 
of the environment, discards information, making the process inherently irreversible. 
Thus, despite the unitary transformation’s reversibility in the combined system 
A + E, the practical application of CPTP maps remains irreversible due to the loss 
of access to the environment’s state post-interaction, highlighting a fundamental 
quantum-to-classical transition.
12.2.8 * Partial Trace and Reduced Density Operators
The concept of the partial trace of density operators in quantum mechanics bears a 
strong analogy to marginal probability in classical probability theory (see § 13.1.4). 
Both methodologies enable focusing on a subset within a larger system by summing 
over and thereby effectively disregarding the other components of the system.
Partial trace serves a complementary role to tensor product. While tensor product 
is used to construct a composite quantum system from individual states, partial 
trace allows us to extract and examine the state of a specific subsystem, effectively 
removing information about other parts of the system.
Partial trace is a fundamental tool for describing parts of larger quantum sys­
tems. Its applications range widely, including understanding quantum entanglement, 
studying the effects of environmental interactions on quantum systems (such as 
decoherence), and analyzing quantum information processes.

Definition
Consider a bipartite composite system represented by a density operator pAB . The 
partial trace of pAB over subsystem B is defined as:
Pa = tr b ( Pab ) = X? I A ® < i IB) Pab (I a ® I i) B) , 
(12.61)
or, in the partial product notation (see Appendix C),
trb (Pab) = 
(i|b Pab |i}B , 
(12.62)
where {| i) B} is any orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space of subsystem B. In this 
case, the result of the partial trace, PA , is also referred to as the reduced density 
operator of subsystem A.
The reduced density operator PA represents the state of subsystem A after 
averaging over the degrees of freedom of subsystem B . This operation effectively 
encompasses all possible outcomes of partial measurements on subsystem B , pro­
viding a statistical description of subsystem A irrespective of the specific state or 
measurement outcome of subsystem B .
Similarly, the partial trace over subsystem A, or the reduced density operator of 
subsystem B , is defined as:

Examples
In the following, we will explore partial trace through several examples. We begin 
with a visual representation of matrix elements in a two-qubit system to establish a 
foundational understanding. Subsequently, we examine the partial trace in different 
contexts: a correlated mixed state to demonstrate how classical correlations are 
handled, and a Bell state to reveal the intriguing nature of quantum entanglement. 
We then extend our exploration to consider the effects of local operations in entangled 
systems, which leads us to a deeper understanding of quantum nonlocality.

Here, for clearer visualization, we have used binary indices 00, 01, 10, 11 (instead of 
1, 2, 3, 4) to label the matrix elements.
To compute PA , the reduced density operator for qubit A, we perform the partial 
trace of PAB over subsystem B . This process can be visualized as combining elements 
of PAB that correspond to the same state of qubit A. For each state of qubit A, we 
add together the elements of pAB where qubit B is in either state |0) or |1):

P 0010 + P 0111
P1000 + P1101 P1010 + P1111
(12.66)
Here, the element P0000 + P0101, for example, represents the sum of probabilities 
where qubit A is in state |0), irrespective of the state of qubit B. It corresponds 
to (0|B (p0000 |00><00|) |0)B + (1|B (p0101 |01><011) |1)B in Eq. 12.62. This ‘partial 
tracing’ effectively removes the detailed information about qubit B , leaving us with 
the reduced state of qubit A.
Similarly, the reduced density operator for qubit B, PB , can be obtained by 
summing the matrix elements corresponding to the states of qubit A:
PB = trA(PAB) =
P0000 + P1010 
P0001 + P1011
P0100 + P1110 
P0101 + P1111

Exercise 12.18 Consider a two-qubit product state |^) = |++), where |+) =
72 (|0> +11».
(a) Express |^) in terms of |0) and |1) and compute the density operator 
Pab = |++X++|.
(b) Compute the reduced density operators pa and pB from the partial trace 
of pab . Verify that pa = pB = |+)(+|.
(c) Verify that Pab = pa 0 pB.
This exercise is designed to show that the reduced density operators derived 
from partial tracing align with our expectations for simple product states.
■ Example 12.9 — Partial Trace of a Correlated Mixed State. Consider a two- 
qubit system with the density operator PAB given by:
PAB = 1100><00| + 1 |11><11|,
(12.68)
representing a mixed state with classical correlations between the two qubits. It is 
not an entangled state.
We want to find the reduced density operator for qubit A. The partial trace over 
qubit B is calculated as:
trB(Pab) = (0|B Pab |0)B + (1|B Pab |1)B .
(12.69)
Substituting the value of PAB , we get:

trB(Pab) = (0|B (2 |00><00| + 2 |11><11|) |0)B

Therefore, the reduced density operator for qubit A is:
I
PA = 2 ’
(12.70d)
(12.71)
which indicates that qubit A is in a maximally mixed state. Similarly, pB = 2. ■
■ Example 12.10 — Partial Trace of a Bell State. The Bell state |$) = -J2 (|00> + 
|11)) has a density operator given by:
PAB = 2(|00) +111»«00| + <11|).
(12.72)
Expanding the terms yields:
PAB = 2(|00><00| + |00><11| + |11><00| + |11><11|) .
(12.73)
Let’s now calculate the partial trace over the B subsystem, using the computa­
tional basis as our orthonormal basis {|i)}:
PA = trB (PAB)
(12.74a)
= 2 U0|B PAB |0)B + (1B PAB 1B) 
= 1(|0)(0| + |1><1|)
(12.74b)

.

(12.74d)
Similarly, PB = 2.
Apparently, both PA and PB represent a uniform mixed state with 50% probability 
of |0) and 50% probability of 11), a surprising result considering that the joint state 
of A and B is a pure, entangled state. This illuminates the non-intuitive properties 
of quantum entanglement, where subsystems can be mixed even when the global 
system is in a pure state.
Comparing with Example 12.9, we see that the reduced state of a subsystem 
can be maximally mixed, regardless of whether the overall system is in a correlated 
mixed state or an entangled pure state. Thus, in quantum mechanics, the properties 
of parts of a system do not always straightforwardly reflect the properties of the 
whole system.

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps 
358
Can we differentiate between this Bell state and the classically correlated mixed 
state in Example 12.9? The distinction becomes clear with the application of the Bell 
inequality and the Bell test experiments. For a more comprehensive understanding 
of these concepts, refer to Chapter 9.

Exercise 12.19 Compute pA and pB for the Bell state |^) = (|00) + |11)), as 
in Example 12.10, but now using the {|+), |—)} basis, where |+) = 112(|0) + |1)) 
and - = 12(|0)-|1)).
■ Example 12.11 — Local Operations in Entangled Systems. Let’s continue from 
the previous example, and consider the scenario where Alice and Bob are spatially 
separated and share a Bell pair described by the density operator in Eq. 12.72. 
Suppose Bob performs a local operation on his qubit, such as a measurement or a 
state change. We analyze whether Alice can perceive this action through her part of 
the Bell pair using the concept of the partial trace.
Case 1: Local Unitary Operations
Suppose Bob performs a local unitary operation UB on his qubit. The state of the 
system after this operation is given by:
pAb = (Ia ® UB)pab (Ia ® UB). 
(12.75)
Alice’s reduced state, obtained by tracing out Bob’s subsystem, is pA = trB(pAB)■ 
Since the trace operation is invariant under unitary transformations, trB (pAB) = 
trB (pAB). Therefore,
p A = pA = 2, 
(12.76)
indicating that Alice’s reduced state is unaffecte. Although the unitary operation 
changes the state of Bob’s qubit, it does not collapse the quantum state, nor does it 
change the entanglement properties in a way observable to Alice.
Case 2: Local Measurements
Now, consider Bob performs a local measurement. This collapses the state of the 
system into one of the eigenstates corresponding to the measurement outcome. 
However, without further communication, Alice would not know which eigenstate 
Bob’s qubit has collapsed to. So she would experience a mixed state corresponding 
to the statistical ensemble of both measurement outcomes, given by the density 
operator in Eq. 12.68. As we have worked out in Example 12.9, Alice’s reduced 
density operator is 2.
Thus, Alice’s observable statistics remain consistent with the reduced density 
operator calculated before Bob’s actions. She cannot distinguish whether her 
mixed state is due to the original entanglement or the collapse caused by Bob’s 
measurement, highlighting the non-observability of Bob’s local measurements from 
Alice’s perspective without additional classical communication.
This example illustrates a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: local 
operations on part of an entangled system do not have observable consequences on 
the distant part of the system, and entanglement itself does not allow for superluminal

communication. This underscores the principles of the no-communication theorem 
in quantum mechanics. 
■
■ Example 12.12 — GHZ State and the Monogamy of Entanglement. Consider 
the GHZ state |GHZ) = (|000) + |111)), which extends the concept of entanglement 
to three qubits, held by Alice, Bob, and Charlie respectively. Unlike pairs of qubits in 
the Bell state, the three qubits in the GHZ state are mutually entangled; measuring 
one qubit instantly determines the states of the other two. Its density operator is 
given by:
PABC = 2(|000) + |111»(<000| + <111|) - 
(12.77)
What happens if we observe just Alice and Bob’s qubits without Charlie’s? To 
find out, we perform a partial trace over qubit C , yielding:
Pab = 2 |00><00| + 2 |11><11| - 
(12.78)
Surprisingly, pAB resembles the density operator of a classically correlated 
mixed state, not the entangled Bell state one might expect. This shows that 
the entanglement in the three-qubit GHZ state is fully manifested only when all 
three qubits are considered together; with only two, we observe merely classical 
correlations.
This phenomenon is often referred to as the monogamy of entanglement, high­
lighting its “all-or-nothing” nature. As a result, the triple cannot share additional 
entanglement with any external system. Attempting to entangle a fourth qubit with 
the GHZ state would inevitably weaken its intrinsic entanglement. The principle of 
monogamy underlies the security of certain quantum cryptography protocols, where 
any eavesdropping attempt on part of an entangled state disrupts the entanglement 
in a detectable manner.
Another interesting three-qubit entangled state is the W state, |W) = ^3 (|001) + 
|010) + 1100)). In the W state, there is partial entanglement between each pair of 
qubits, but none are maximally entangled. Readers are encouraged to explore this 
further by performing a partial trace on the density operator of the W state. ■
12.2.9 * Extension of No-Cloning and No-Communication Theorems
The no-cloning and no-communication theorems, initially introduced within the con­
text of unitary operations in closed quantum systems, are equally applicable to more 
general quantum operations defined by Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) 
operations. These operations encompass measurements and other non-reversible 
effects, thereby broadening the applicability of these fundamental theorems. In this 
subsection, we outline proofs of the no-cloning and no-communication theorems 
within the framework of CPTP operations.
1 
The No-Cloning Theorem: A Proof Outline
The No-Cloning Theorem (see § 5.1.3) asserts that it is impossible to create an 
identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state. A proof was provided under 
unitary transformations in § 5.7. The proof can be extended to CPTP maps, which 
can include measurements and other quantum operations.

12.2 * Mixed States, Density Operators, and CPTP Maps
360
Consider an arbitrary quantum state, |^). Assume there exists a CPTP map E 
that can clone any quantum state, such that E(|^){^|) = |^){^| 0 |^){^|. The map 
E must simultaneously clone |0), |1), and |+) = — (|0) + |1)):
E(|0)(0|) = |0><0|® |0><0|, 
(12.79a)
E(|1><1|) = |1><1|®|1><1|, 
(12.79b)
E(|+X+|) = |+X+|®|+><+| ■ 
(12.79c)
However, if we add the first two equations and multiply the result by 2, we 
do not get the same result as the third equation. This discrepancy highlights the 
contradiction and proves that a universal cloning machine cannot exist within the 
framework of CPTP maps, thus proving the no-cloning theorem.
2 
The No-Communication Theorem: A Proof Outline
The No-Communication Theorem (see § 9.7) states that during the measurement 
of an entangled quantum state, it is fundamentally impossible for one observer to 
communicate information to another solely through the act of measurement. Here is 
an outline of the proof of this Theorem, building on the previous example.
Suppose we have a composite quantum system described by a joint density 
operator pAB. Let E be a completely positive, trace-preserving (CPTP) map that 
acts only on subsystem B. Physically, E can represent a quantum operation (such 
as a measurement or a unitary operation) performed by Bob on his subsystem.
Now, consider the reduced density operator of subsystem A. Before Bob’s 
operation, it is given by trB (pAB). After Bob’s operation, the state of the total 
system becomes:
pAB = (I ®E)(pAB), 
(12.80)
where I is the identity map acting on subsystem A.
The reduced density operator of subsystem A is then
trB (PAB) = trB [(I ® E)(PAB)] ■ 
(12.81)
A CPTP map E maintains the trace of a density operator, i.e., tr(E p) = tr(p). 
When taking the partial trace over B , we are effectively summing over the degrees of 
freedom of subsystem B. Since E is trace-preserving and only acts on B, the overall 
trace of the entire system over B remains unchanged. Thus, we have
trB[(I ® E)(pAB)] = trB(pAB)■ 
(12.82)
Therefore,
tr B ( p AB )=tr B (pAB) ■ 
(12.83)
This result indicates that the reduced density operator of subsystem A (i.e., 
Alice’s subsystem) remains unchanged regardless of what operation Bob performs 
on subsystem B . Consequently, Bob cannot send any information to Alice through 
his actions on his subsystem.

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
361
This proof assumes that Alice and Bob’s subsystems do not interact during the 
process. If there is an interaction, information can be transferred, but it cannot 
occur faster than light as required by the theory of relativity.

Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing
In quantum computing, especially in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) 
era, errors can be broadly divided into coherent and incoherent errors, which are 
the focus of the section. These errors manifest differently in the dynamics of the 
quantum system and, consequently, have different implications for error correction 
and fault tolerance. This section also introduces merit parameters that serve as 
quantitative metrics for characterizing the impact and prevalence of these errors.
1
* Coherent Errors
Coherent errors typically stem from inaccuracies in control parameters such as pulse 
amplitude, duration, and frequency. They often manifest as unitary transformations 
that deviate from the ideal transformations. Below, we discuss two main types of 
coherent errors: gate calibration errors and cross-talk errors.
Gate Calibration Errors
Gate calibration errors arise when there is a discrepancy between the ideal and 
the actual implementations of a quantum gate. These errors are frequently due to 
inaccuracies in control parameters such as pulse amplitude, frequency, or timing.
To illustrate, consider a simple X -gate applied to a qubit initially in the state 
|0). In an ideal situation, the gate would transform the qubit into the state |1). 
Repeated applications of an ideal X -gate would result in the qubit state oscillating 
between |0) and |1), as shown in Fig. 12.4.

The X-gate is typically implemented as a n rotation around the x-axis: X = 
iRx (n) (see §§ 4.5.2 and 5.2.5). However, calibration errors can occur. For instance, 
the amplitude of the control pulse may be slightly higher than required, resulting 

12.3 Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing

in an actual operation Rx (n + e). When we repeat this off-calibration X-gate, the 
resulting qubit state will not simply oscillate between |0) and |1), but may evolve 
into a superposition state. This is illustrated in Fig. 12.5.

Exercise 12.20 Deduce the value of the calibration error e based on the graph in 
Fig. 12.5. Hint: (Rx(n + e))n = Rx(nn + nE). When nE accumulates to n, the 
final state is a uniform superpostion, yielding (Z) = 0.
As demonstrated in the preceding example, the impact of gate calibration 
errors can be exacerbated in circuits with increasing depth (n). Specifically, as n 
grows, these errors may accumulate, leading to significant deviations in the final 
computational results from the expected outcomes.
2 Cross-Talk Errors
Cross-talk errors occur due to unintended interactions between qubits that are either 
adjacent or otherwise coupled. These interactions can introduce undesired rotations 
and entanglement, thereby affecting the fidelity of gate operations.
Consider, for instance, an unwanted ZZ coupling governed by the following 
two-qubit Hamiltonian:
(12.84)
HZZ = -
where w represents the coupling strength, and ZZ denotes Z ® Z.
This Hamiltonian leads to a unitary evolution given by Rzz (wt), which can be 
viewed as an unwanted ZZ(0) gate with 0 = wt:
Rzz (wt) = cos -2^I + i sin -^ ZZ-
(12.85)
Such an interaction results in a phase walk-off in the computational basis. To 
measure this effect, we sandwich the Rzz (wt) unitary between Hadamard gates, as 

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
363
depicted in Fig. 12.6. In the absence of coupling (w = 0), the measurement on the 
first qubit yields (ZI) = 1, corresponding to the expected outcome |00).
However, with coupling, the measurement outcome changes to (ZI) = cos wt, indi­
cating the emergence of unwanted phase shift that deteriorates over time. (Similarly 
for (IZ) measured on the second qubit.)

Exercise 12.21 Plot (ZZ) as function of wt.
* Incoherent Errors
Incoherent errors are fundamentally stochastic in nature and primarily arise due to 
uncontrolled interactions between the quantum system and its external environment. 
Unlike coherent errors, which can be modeled deterministically, incoherent errors 
are statistically represented using density operators and noise channels.

12.3 Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing
364
There are numerous types of incoherent errors that affect both single-qubit 
and multi-qubit systems. In the following subsections, we will focus on three key 
examples: bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors. We will also outline the 
noise channel representations for other types of errors. The concepts and formulas 
presented here are essential for understanding and simulating noise in quantum 
computing.
Pure States, Mixed States, Noise, and Noise Channels
Here is a recapitulation of some key concepts from § 12.2.
Pure States: In quantum mechanics, a pure state is described by a unique ket 
vector |^) in a Hilbert space. For a pure state, the associated density operator p 
is a projection operator given by p = |^^ |. A pure state is free from ‘quantum 
noise,’ meaning that repeated quantum measurements, under identical conditions, 
yield the same probabilities for each possible outcome, which in the case of certain 
observables can produce deterministic results in quantum computing.
Mixed States: In contrast, a mixed state is a statistical ensemble of multiple 
potential quantum states. It is represented by a density operator p that is not 
expressible as |^^| for any ket |^). A mixed state introduces classical uncertainty, 
leading to non-deterministic results in quantum computing because the system can 
be in any of the states of the ensemble with a certain probability.
Noise and Errors: In quantum systems, “noise” often refers to processes that con­
vert pure states into mixed states. Such processes include decoherence, dissipation, 
and interaction with the environment, among others. This random noise manifests 
as computational errors, which can affect the outcomes of quantum computations.
Noise Channels and Kraus Representation: Noise and errors in quantum 
computing are commonly modeled through quantum channels, which act as trace­
preserving transformations on density operators. This is also known as the Kraus 
representation:
N (P) = 
sj Kj pKj,
where {Kj} are the Kraus operators and {Sj} are the corresponding probabilities.
This representation serves as a powerful framework for both understanding and 
mitigating the impacts of noise in quantum systems.
1 Bit-Flip Error
A bit-flip error inverts the state of a qubit from |0) to |1) or vice versa with a 
predetermined probability s. This error can be modeled by applying an X gate 
randomly with probability s. The corresponding noise channel for a bit-flip error is 
represented as
Nbit-flip( P) = (1 — s) P + sXPX. 
(12.88)
As discussed in Example 12.5, an X gate transforms a general quantum state, 
represented by the Bloch vector (x, y, z), into (x, -y, -z). By combining both terms 
in Nbit-flip (P), we obtain:
Nbit-flip (x, y, z) = (x, (1 - 2s)y, (1 - 2s)z) . 
(12.89)

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
365
Hence, the influence of bit-flip errors can be visualized as a contraction of the 
terminal points of the qubit states in the Bloch sphere along the y and z axes by a 
factor of 1 - 2s, as depicted in Fig. 12.7.
Figure 12.7: Bit-Flip Error in the Bloch Sphere
N (p)
To elucidate the impact of bit-flip errors further, consider their combined effect 
with a sequence of X (or Rx(n)) gates, as presented in Fig. 12.4. The resulting 
Kraus representation becomes:
Nx-and-BF( P) = XNbit-flip( P) X = (1 — S) XpX + Sp, 
(12.90)
or, when expressed in terms of Bloch vectors,
NX-and-BF (x, y, z) = (x, (2S - 1)y, (2S - 1)z) . 
(12.91)
Upon n repeated applications of this transformation, one obtains:
NXn-and-BF(x,y,z) = (x, (2S - 1)ny, (2S - 1)nz). 
(12.92)
Assuming the initial state is |0), corresponding to (0, 0, 1), we have:
NXn-and-BF(0,0,1) = (0,0,(2S-1)n). 
(12.93)
Therefore,
(Z) = (2s - 1)n = (-1)n(1 - 2s)n. 
(12.94)
The above equation is graphed in Fig. 12.8 with S = 1%. While the unaltered 
application of the X gate results in an oscillation between the qubit states |0) and 
|1) (see Fig. 12.4), the presence of bit-flip errors induces a damping effect on the 
amplitude of this oscillation by the factor (1 - 2s)n.

Phase-Flip Error
A phase-flip error results in a sign change in the |1) state of a qubit, and is represented 
by the random application of the Pauli-Z operator with a predetermined probability 
s. The Kraus representation of the phase-flip error is given by:
Nphase-flip(P) = (1 — s)p + sZpZ. 
(12.95)
The Z gate modifies a general quantum state represented by the Bloch vector 
(x, y, z) into (—x, — y, z). Integrating both terms in Nphase-flip(p), we find:
Nphase-flip (x, y, z) = ((1 - 2s)x, (1 - 2s)y, z) . 
(12.96)
Thus, phase-flip errors can be visualized as a contraction of the terminal points 
of the qubit states along the x and y axes in the Bloch sphere by a factor of 1 — 2s, 
as depicted in Fig. 12.9.

Depolarizing Error
Depolarizing error describes the transition of a qubit from a pure state into a 
completely mixed state comprising |0)(0| and |1)(1|. In this process, the qubit loses 
both its phase information and the superposition between its basis states. The 
Kraus representation of depolarizing error is:
Ndephase(P) = (1 - s)P + s (XpX + YpY + ZpZ), 
(12.97)
3
where the parameter s quantifies the noise strength.
This error manifests as a uniform contraction of the terminal points of the qubit 
states within the Bloch sphere, as illustrated in Fig. 12.10.

Dephasing Error
Dephasing error occurs when the relative phase between the basis states |0) and 
|1) becomes randomized. The phase-flip error can be considered a special case of 
dephasing error. Dephasing error can be modeled mathematically by applying a 
random phase using the Rz (0) gate to the qubit state:
Ndephase(P) = (1 - S)P + sRz (0)pR (0), 
(12.98)
where s is the probability of the noise, and 0 is a random variable in [0 ,n).
A more abstract definition that does not specify the random process (or equiv­
alently, averaging over all 0 values) leading to the dephasing but focuses on the 
overall effect is:
Ndephase(P) = (1 - s)P+ s diag(P), 
(12.99)
where diag(P) represents zeroing out off-diagonal elements of P and retaining only 
the diagonal elements.
The complete dephasing channel in Example 12.7 can be considered as the special 
case of s = 1.

12.3 Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing

Amplitude Damping Error
Amplitude damping error models the irreversible decay of the qubit state |1) to the 
state |0). For example, in a quantum computer, the state |1) typically has a higher 
energy than the state |0), prompting the system to relax from |1) to |0). The Kraus 
representation is as follows:
Namp-damping (P) = K1 PK\ + K 2 PK2, 
(12.100)
where K1 =
0
V1 — s
, K2 =
0
0
, and s is the probability of decay.
Note that amplitude damping error is not a simple random occurrence of two 
unitary transformations; instead, the probabilities are embedded within the Kraus 
operators.
6 
Pauli Channel
This is a general single-qubit noise channel. Pauli X , Y , and Z matrices serve as 
Kraus operators to model this channel:
NPauli (P) = (1 — sx — sy — sz)P + sxXPX + syY PY + szZPZ, 
(12.101)
where sx , sy , and sz are the probabilities of each Pauli error. Restrictions on these 
probabilities are not imposed unless specified.

Two-qubit Bit-Flip Error
This channel describes the bit-flip process in a two-qubit quantum state. It is an 
extension of the single-qubit bit-flip error. The Kraus representation of this error 
channel is given by:
Nbit-flip-2(P) = (1 - S)P + S(IXpIX + XIpXI + XXpXX), 
(12.102)
3
where s is the strength of the noise. The last three terms represent the flip of the 
first qubit, the second qubit, and both, respectively. The factor of 3 in the Kraus 
representation ensures that each of the bit-flip error terms contributes equally to 
the overall noise process.
8 
Two-qubit Dephasing Error
This channel describes the dephasing process in a two-qubit quantum state. It is an 
extension of the single-qubit phase-flip error. The Kraus representation is:
Ndephase-2( P) = (1 — s) P + S (IZpIZ + ZIpZI + ZZpZZ ), 
(12.103)
3
where s is the strength of the noise. The factor of 1/3 in the Kraus representation is 
conventional and allows for equal contributions from each term.
9 
Two-qubit Pauli Channel
This is a general two-qubit noise channel that can model loss of quantum phase, 
superposition between basis states, and entanglement. The Kraus representation is:

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
369
Npauii-2(p) = Yi SiKipKi, 
(12.104)
where Ki is one of the sixteen two-qubit Pauli matrices, formed by taking tensor 
products of single-qubit Pauli matrices, and Si is the probability of the corresponding 
Ki.
12.3.3 * Other Types of Errors
Apart from coherent and incoherent errors, there are specific errors that occur during 
the initialization and readout stages of quantum computation. State preparation 
and measurement (SPAM) errors are often critical as they can set the stage for or 
amplify subsequent errors during the computation process.
1 
State Preparation Errors
Occurring during the initialization phase, state preparation errors arise when an 
intended initial state like |0) is realized as a different state such as |1). These errors 
can be either coherent or incoherent.
State preparation errors can be modeled using a density matrix representation. 
If the intended initial state is |^), the actual state can be described as:
pactual = (1 s) |^){^| + sperror, 
(12.105)
where s is the error rate and perror is the density matrix representing the error state.
2 
Readout Errors (Measurement Errors)
Readout errors, also known as measurement errors, manifest during the readout 
process. A state such as |0) might be mis-measured as |1). Similar to state 
preparation errors, readout errors can also be either coherent, arising from systematic 
biases, or incoherent, occurring randomly.
Mathematically, readout errors can be modeled using a confusion matrix C , 
where the element Cij represents the probability of measuring state |j) when the 
actual state is |i). For a two-level system, the confusion matrix can be expressed as: 
C=
1 -s0 
s1
s0 
1 - s1
(12.106)
where s0 and s 1 are the probabilities of incorrectly reading the states |0) and |1), 
respectively.
12.3.4 Performance Merit Parameters
Merit parameters in quantum computing provide a quantitative framework to 
assess the capabilities and limitations of quantum systems. In contrast to classical 
computers, which are relatively homogenous in technology, quantum computers are 
developed across various and rapidly advancing hardware platforms. Standardized 
performance metrics are crucial for comprehensively understanding, comparing, and 
validating the operations of these diverse quantum technologies.

12.3 Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing 
370
While the number of qubits is frequently cited as a primary comparison metric, 
implying that more qubits equate to a more potent system able to manage larger or 
more complex algorithms, this perspective oversimplifies the intricacies of quantum 
computation. Given the susceptibility of current quantum computing hardware 
to noise and consequential error rates that can inhibit performance, a combined 
assessment of the quantity and the quality of qubits yields a more nuanced evaluation 
of different quantum systems.
These merit parameters encompass temporal, spatial, and computational di­
mensions from a physical standpoint. Operationally, they are examined at various 
levels: qubit, circuit, Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), and the overall system. 
Furthermore, metrics concerning fault-tolerance and scalability are critical. They 
offer insights into the long-term practicality and effectiveness of quantum computing 
architectures, particularly those that aim for fault-tolerant operations and scalable 
designs.
1 Temporal Metrics
Relaxation Time: T1
The relaxation time T1 measures the rate at which an excited qubit returns to its 
ground state due to energy relaxation, also known as amplitude damping. This 
parameter determines the effective lifetime of the excited state.
An exponential decay model for the relaxation of the excited state can be 
represented as:
p(t) = e-t/T1 p(0) + (1 - e-t/T1) |0)(0|, 
(12.107)
where p(t) denotes the system’s state at time t. As t ^ to, the qubit eventually 
stabilizes in the state |0).
In quantum error correction, the effects of energy relaxation are typically ab­
stracted and modeled as bit-flip errors (§ 12.3.2.1 and § 12.4.1), capturing the 
transition from excited to ground states. The exponential decay of the excited state 
corresponds to a constant rate of occurrence for bit-flip errors over time, which can 
be modeled by a Poisson distribution.
Coherence Time: T2
The coherence time T2 quantifies the duration over which a qubit maintains a 
coherent superposition before dephasing errors transform it into a mixed state. This 
factor is critical because quantum computation relies on maintaining the phase 
coherence of qubits for quantum interference and entanglement.
For a generic pure state |^) = a |0) + P |1), the density matrix is:
p=
|a|2
Pa *
ap * 
| P |2
(12.108)
Dephasing can be modeled by an exponential decay of the off-diagonal elements:
|a|2 
ap*e-t/T2
pa*e-t/T2 
|p|2
(12.109)
As t ^ to, the qubit evolves into a mixed state p = |a|2 |0)(0| + |P|2 |1)(11.

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer 
371
For the purposes of quantum error correction, dephasing effects are commonly 
represented through phase-flip error channels (§ 12.3.2.2 and § 12.4.2), which model 
the loss of phase coherence between superposition states.
Qubit Lifetime: Tq
The qubit lifetime Tq is the aggregate period during which a qubit remains in a 
computationally useful state. Simplistically, Tq can be approximated by min(T1, T2). 
Typically, T2 is shorter than T1 , as phase coherence is susceptible to any environ­
mental fluctuations that can perturb the qubit states, even in the absence of energy 
exchange.
This metric is affected by various elements, such as the quality of qubit fabrica­
tion, the efficiency of error correction strategies, and the specific quantum computing 
architecture employed. Different qubit technologies exhibit a wide range of gate 
lifetimes and other key temporal parameters. For instance, superconducting qubits 
often display qubit lefetimes ranging from microseconds to milliseconds. In con­
trast, systems based on optical qubits, like trapped ions, can sustain coherence for 
significantly longer durations, spanning from seconds to minutes in some cases.
Gate Time: Tgate
The operational speed of a QPU is intrinsically related to the duration of its gate 
operations. The gate time Tgate is the time required to execute a single quantum 
gate operation.
Coherence Time to Gate Time Ratio
The ratio of coherence time Tq to gate time Tgate holds practical significance. If 
Tgate is considerably shorter than Tq , a larger number of successive gate operations 
can be executed before coherence is lost. Consequently, the achievable depth of 
quantum circuits on a QPU is generally limited by this ratio.
For instance, while optical systems may exhibit greater coherence times, their 
control pulse durations are also longer. This means that the ratio of qubit coherence 
to gate operation times may not necessarily be more advantageous than that of 
superconducting or semiconducting systems, which operate with pulses on the 
nanosecond (ns) timescale.
2 
Spatial Metrics
Connectivity or Topology
Connectivity, or topology, in quantum computing describes the manner in which 
qubits within a system are interconnected, facilitating quantum operations between 
them. This aspect is important in determining how easily multi-qubit gates can be 
executed.
High connectivity eases the implementation of quantum algorithms by reducing 
the need for additional SWAP gates, which are otherwise necessary to bring non- 
adjacent qubits into interaction range. However, increased connectivity can also 
complicate the physical design of the system and introduce additional error sources, 
such as cross-talk.
Connectivity types range from nearest-neighbor (where qubits interact only with 
adjacent ones) to all-to-all (permitting direct interaction between any pair of qubits). 
The connectivity pattern is closely tied to the quantum computer’s architecture and 

12.3 Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing
372
shows significant differences across technologies. For example, solid-state devices 
like superconducting circuits and semiconducting qubits are typically limited in 
connectivity due to the constraints of physical wiring or resonators. These systems 
often have just two or three directly connected neighbors. Entangling distant qubits 
in such architectures requires additional operations, like SWAP gates or teleportation, 
to transfer quantum information.
In contrast, trapped ion and optical systems are not constrained by a two­
dimensional circuit layout, thereby offering greater flexibility in qubit addressing 
and entanglement. These technologies can often achieve an all-to-all connectivity, 
facilitating more direct and versatile qubit interactions for algorithm execution and 
logic processing. However, it is important to note that the physical movement of 
ions necessary for these interactions in trapped ion systems can be time-consuming, 
potentially impacting the overall operation speed of the quantum computer.
Cross-Talk
Cross-talk in quantum computing refers to the inadvertent interactions between 
qubits that are not intended to be coupled at a particular moment. Such interference 
typically stems from electromagnetic disturbances, stray couplings, or leakage in 
control signals.
This phenomenon can inadvertently alter the states of qubits not actively partic­
ipating in a specific operation, potentially leading to errors and reduced fidelity in 
quantum computations. To combat cross-talk, strategies such as meticulous design of 
the physical layout, shielding, implementation of decoupling sequences, and precise 
calibration routines are utilized. Advanced control methods are also employed for 
dynamic compensation of cross-talk effects.
As quantum systems scale up, understanding and mitigating cross-talk becomes 
increasingly vital for developing reliable and fault-tolerant quantum circuits. The 
challenge lies in achieving high connectivity while simultaneously maintaining qubit 
coherence and minimizing cross-talk and other error sources in quantum computer 
design.
3 
Computational Metrics
Fidelity
Fidelity quantifies the precision with which a quantum gate or circuit performs in 
comparison to its ideal theoretical model. A fidelity value of 1 signifies flawless 
execution, whereas values less than 1 reflect discrepancies from the ideal operation.
The expected output of an ideal quantum gate or circuit is typically a pure state, 
denoted as |^ideal). However, due to noise and other factors, the actual output might 
be a mixed state, represented by pactual. The fidelity in this scenario is defined as:
F = {^ideal|pactual1 ^ideal) - 
(12-110)
This formulation encompasses both the desired unitary operations and the non- 
unitary effects of noise. For cases where the actual output is also a pure state 
|^actual), fidelity simplifies to F = | (^ideal|^actual) |2.
Fidelity can be assessed at both the gate and circuit levels. Generally, circuit 
fidelity tends to decrease with increasing circuit depth due to error accumulation, as 
expressed by:

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
373
F « FG, 
(12.111)
where F is the overall circuit fidelity, FG represents the average gate fidelity, and D 
is the circuit depth.
Notably, the fidelity of two-qubit gates, such as CNOT or ZZ, frequently deter­
mines the upper limit of the system’s overall fidelity. This is because two-qubit gates 
generally present more challenges in achieving high precision.
Error Rate
Error rate quantifies the probability of an error occurring during a quantum operation, 
which could be a single gate or a sequence of gates. Techniques such as randomized 
benchmarking are often used to estimate this rate.
Fidelity (F) and error rate (s) are complementary metrics. They are related by:
e = 1 - F. 
(12.112)
Circuit Depth
Circuit depth refers to the maximum number of sequential gate operations that can 
be performed before the system accrues an unacceptable level of errors. As a rough 
approximation, circuit depth (D) and the gate-level error rate (eG) are inversely 
related:
D ra —, 
(12.113)
eG
indicating that higher error rates limit the feasible depth of quantum circuits.

System-Level Composite Metrics
In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, single-number composite metrics 
offer a holistic approach to evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems. 
These metrics aim to distill the complex, multi-faceted characteristics of quantum 
systems into a single, comprehensive figure, facilitating a more straightforward 
comparison and understanding of quantum processors from an application-level per­
spective. While beneficial for providing an overarching view of a quantum computer’s 
capabilities, these metrics are continually evolving, reflecting the dynamic nature of 
quantum technology and its diverse applications. Below are a few representative 
examples.
Quantum Volume
Quantum Volume (QV), introduced by IBM, serves as a composite metric designed 
to provide a unified framework for evaluating and comparing quantum processors. 
It accounts for factors such as the number of qubits, coherence, gate fidelity, and 
connectivity.
QV is determined by the size of the largest square circuit that can be successfully 
run on a QPU. The term “square” refers to a circuit where the number of qubits 
(width) is equal to the number of layers of two-qubit gates (depth). The protocol for 
determining QV involves running a series of circuits that increase in complexity, both 
in terms of width and depth, and identifying the largest circuit that the quantum 
computer can reliably execute. These circuits consist of layers of qubit permutation 

12.3 Error Mechanisms in Quantum Computing
374
(SWAP) and random single and double qubit gates. If the number of qubits in the 
largest successfully executed square circuit is n, then QV is given by 2n .
QV, being dependent on both circuit depth and width, inherently relates QPU 
performance to its topology, error rates, and overall size. As such, QV is increasingly 
used as a gauge of QPU performance, offering a holistic and comprehensive view 
through a single value.
CLOPS
While Quantum Volume (QV) provides insight into the potential capabilities of 
a quantum computer, it does not fully capture the operational speed at a system 
level. This is particularly relevant for quantum-classical interfacing in full appli­
cations, where algorithms require multiple calls to a QPU. The efficiency of the 
runtime system, which facilitates quantum-classical communication, is crucial for 
high performance.
CLOPS, or Circuit Layer Operations Per Second, measures the speed and 
capability of a quantum computer to solve problems of a certain complexity. It 
defines how many QV circuits a quantum processor can process within a given 
timeframe, thus providing an operational speed measure in practical scenarios. 
CLOPS emphasizes the practical throughput of executing quantum algorithms, 
taking into account the efficiency of quantum-classical communication and the 
runtime system.
A pertinent metric in this context is “teraquops”, the quantum counterpart of 
“teraops” in classical computation. It signifies the number of quantum operations 
(quops) a quantum system is capable of performing each second, scaled to a tera­
order of magnitude (trillions of operations per second). This metric gauges the raw 
computational power and speed of quantum systems, complementing the throughput­
centric perspective provided by CLOPS.
Algorithmic Qubits
Quantum Volume (QV) is a widely recognized metric, yet there is a growing consen­
sus that it may not fully encompass the nuances of quantum computational power, 
especially for specific algorithms or practical use cases. Concerns have been raised 
that QV might not accurately reflect the performance of quantum computers in 
scenarios that do not require deep circuits or extensive qubit connectivity. Fur­
thermore, QV may not represent the capabilities of various quantum computing 
platforms, such as quantum annealers or trapped ion systems, as effectively as it 
does for superconducting qubit systems.
In response, the concept of Algorithmic Qubits (AQ) has been proposed as an 
alternative metric. Unlike QV, which assesses a QPU’s ability to execute increasingly 
complex quantum circuits, AQ focuses on the “algorithmic strength” of a quantum 
computer by considering error rates, qubit coherence, gate fidelity, and the overall 
system architecture in relation to specific quantum algorithms.
AQ provides valuable insights into the practical usability of a quantum processor 
for executing complex algorithms, offering an application-oriented perspective. It 
indicates the number of qubits that can be effectively used for algorithmic tasks, 
factoring in error correction and mitigation techniques necessary for meaningful 
computational outcomes. AQ thus complements QV, aiding in the selection of the 
most appropriate quantum processor for specific algorithmic requirements.

Fault-Tolerance and Scalability Metrics
Fault-tolerance and scalability metrics are instrumental in providing insights into 
the viability and efficiency of fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. By 
analyzing these metrics, researchers and engineers are equipped to identify opti­
mal architectures and error correction strategies, thereby facilitating the practical 
realization of robust and high-performance quantum computers.
These metrics primarily encompass an analysis of noise structure, the relationship 
between physical noise levels and fault-tolerant thresholds (quantified by the A factor), 
the scaling properties of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC), the complexity of 
QECC decoding, and the computational resource requirements essential for achieving 
fault tolerance. The specific metrics of interest include:
The A Factor
The A factor is an essential metric, defined as the ratio of the threshold error rate 
for a given QECC, ethreshold, to the actual physical error rate of quantum operations, 
e physical:
A _ Ethreshold
ephysical
(12.114)
A higher A factor is indicative of physical error rates being substantially below 
the threshold, thereby facilitating effective error correction and extending coherence 
times within the system.
Application Footprint
The application footprint of a specific quantum computing architecture is a measure 
that quantifies the resource requirements for a quantum computing task. It is gauged 
in terms of the number of physical qubits necessary to realize a certain number 
of logical qubits with a target error rate (e.g., 10-12) or to address a particular 
computational problem (e.g., factoring a 2048-bit integer).
This metric elucidates the scalability of a quantum computing architecture, un­
derscoring the trade-offs between the overhead of error correction and computational 
capability. It is invaluable for evaluating the feasibility of employing large-scale 
quantum algorithms for real-world applications.
Subthreshold Scaling
Subthreshold scaling is a metric that examines the performance dynamics of a QECC 
as the physical error rate falls below the threshold error rate. This analysis yields 
insights into the efficiency and dependability of the error correction code, particularly 
as the system’s size and complexity expand. This metric is crucial for assessing the 
long-term sustainability and performance viability of QECCs.
QECC Decoding Complexity
The complexity of decoding QECCs varies significantly among different types. For 
instance, surface codes demand minimal additional processing for error correction. 
In contrast, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes necessitate extensive compu­
tational resources for real-time decoding, which presents challenges for scalability. 
This measure of decoding complexity serves as an indicator of the resources re- 
quired—specifically in terms of time, memory, and classical computational effort—to 
effectively identify and correct errors in a quantum computing system.

12.4 Introduction to Error Correction Codes
376
Capability to Suppress a Broad Spectrum of Errors
Some errors, particularly coherent errors such as those encountered in state prepara­
tion, gate calibration, and measurement, cannot be effectively corrected by current 
QECCs. Nevertheless, for a quantum computing system to scale effectively, it is 
crucial to develop strategies capable of suppressing a comprehensive range of errors 
that undermine computational accuracy.
12.4 Introduction to Error Correction Codes
Achieving fault tolerance is an essential yet elusive goal for the advancement of 
quantum computing. Theoretically, full fault tolerance—often considered the Holy 
Grail in the field—becomes attainable once the actual error rate falls below a certain 
threshold. However, this comes at the expense of requiring a significant qubit 
overhead, making effective error correction a primary research focus.
Impossible!
Figure 12.11: Structure of Practical Error Correction Code
Quantum error correction follows a systematic procedure known as an error 
correction code. As illustrated in Fig. 12.11, this procedure encompasses the 
encoding of logical qubits into a larger set of physical qubits, the detection and 
identification of errors, and the application of corrective operations. Subsequently, 
decoding is performed to retrieve the corrected logical information. The ultimate 
objective is to approximate a nearly perfect logical qubit by employing a sufficiently 
large array of physical qubits.
In this section, we introduce the fundamentals of 
quantum error correction codes through the study of Shor 
codes, an archetypal example in the field. Shor codes use 
a blend of quantum entanglement, local operations, and 
principles from classical error correction to bolster the 
fidelity of quantum information processing. Beyond its 
utility in fault-tolerant quantum computing, Shor codes 
also find applications in secure quantum communications.
We will focus on the comprehensive nine-qubit Shor 
code. To fully grasp the sophistication behind Shor’s 
code, we start by examining two simpler but foundational

codes: the three-qubit bit-flip code and the three-qubit 
phase-flip code. Shor’s code is a masterful combination 
of these elementary codes, enabling it to correct both 
bit-flip and phase-flip errors simultaneously, and thus 
effectively addressing any one-qubit error.
12.4.1 Three-Qubit Bit-Flip Code
The three-qubit bit-flip code is a quantum error correction code designed to guard 
against single bit-flip errors. The quantum circuit diagram for this code is depicted 
in Fig. 12.12.
Computation in Place
In quantum circuits, gates do not exist simultaneously as they might on a classical 
printed circuit board or integrated circuit. Contrarily, in the quantum realm, 
neither gates nor wires manifest as palpable physical entities. What’s physically 
implemented are only the qubits and their corresponding external controls. In this 
context, the wires represent the temporal continuity of the qubit states, and the 
quantum gates denote specific transformations of these qubit states, directed by 
the external controls.
For a more information, refer to § 5.3.2.
1 
Encoding
The encoding process shown in Fig. 12.12 utilizes three data qubits q1 , q2, and q3 
and two CNOT gates. In this context, |x) represents the basis states |0) and |1). 
After encoding, it becomes either |0L) = |000) or |1 L) = |111). A generic single 
qubit state |^) = a |0) + 0 |1) is mapped to a logical qubit state as:
|$1) = |^L} = a |0L} + fl |1 L} = a |000> + /3 1111>. 
(12.115)
It’s essential to note that |^L) = |^^). This means that while |^) spreads across 
three qubits via entanglement, it isn’t replicated thrice. Making such copies would 
violate the no-cloning theorem.

12.4 Introduction to Error Correction Codes 
378
2 
Logical Gates
When employing an error-correction code, qubit gates, such as the Pauli X and Z , 
must be translated into logical gates that act on the encoded logical state. These 
logical gates may affect multiple data qubits, but their operation does not take the 
system out of the code space, i.e., the space spanned by the logical basis states 
{|000), 1111)}. Consider a unitary gate U:
U(a 0 + p |1)) = y |0) + S |1). 
(12.116)
The logical U gate, given by UL , transforms the state of the system into:
|^2) = y |000> + S |111>. 
(12.117)
Exercise 12.22 Show that XL = XXX functions as the logical bit-flip operator 
for the three-qubit bit-flip code.
This task exemplifies the concept of transversal gates, which involve applying 
physical gates individually to each qubit of a quantum error-correcting code word, 
without necessitating multi-qubit operations that could potentially propagate 
errors.
3 
Noise Channel
The gate operation of UL can be a long, complex process during which errors might 
occur. Bit-flip errors can be modeled as random applications of the X gates on data 
qubits. For instance, applying X to q2 (or equivalently, IXI to all three qubits) 
flips the bit in q2. This noise alters the state of the data qubits to:
^3) = y |010> + S |101>. 
(12.118)
4 
Syndrome Measurement
The syndrome measurement circuit identifies any modifications to the qubits resulting 
from noise. It employs two ancilla qubits. The first, a1 , checks the parity of data 
qubits q1 and q2 with two CNOT gates. If q1 and q2 share the same state, either 
|0) or |1), the dual CNOT gates negate each other, and the measurement produces 
s 1 = 0. Thus, in the absence of noise, the state y |000) + S 1111) invariably results in 
s1 = 0, regardless of y and S values.
If a bit flip in q2 has occured, q1 and q2 now have contrasting states, and 
the measurement on a1 returns s1 = 1, highlighting the core principle of parity 
measurement which discerns the parity of two data qubits without perturbing their 
states.
In a similar vein, the second ancilla, a2 , measures the parity of data qubits q1 
and q3 , generating a classical bit s2 . This parity information, represented by the 
ancilla outputs {s1, s2}, is termed the error syndrome. Table 12.1 summarizes the 
possible error syndromes, corresponding errors, and their corrective measures.

Error Correction and State Recovery
Upon detecting the error syndrome, the error can be rectified by applying an X 
gate to the relevant qubit as specified by Table 12.1. This action flips the aberrant 
qubit back to its noise-free state. Now the system state is recovered:
|^4) = |^2) = y |000> + 5 1111). 
(12.119)
Utilizing the deferred measurement principle, as detailed in § 7.4.5, the classically 
controlled X gates can be substituted with CCNOT gates.
6 
Sequential Gate Operations
A quantum computation task is typically carried out with a sequence of gates. As 
errors accumulates above a certain threshold, error detection and state recovery are 
executed. This is represented as repeating the gate-noise-syndrome-recovery block 
in Fig. 12.12.
7 
Decoding
The decoder’s role is to transform the logical qubit state y |000) + 5 1111) back to 
Y |0) + 5 |1), which is U |^). This is achieved by applying two CNOT gates in the 
inverse sequence of the encoder.
8 
Undetected Errors
It is important to address certain limitations of the Shor three-qubit bit-flip code. 
Referring to Table 12.1, we have made the assumption that only a single qubit 
experiences a bit-flip error. However, the syndrome 01 can be a result of bit-flip 
errors on both q1 and q2 , corresponding to the error operator XXI. Similarly, the 
syndrome 11 can emerge from the error operator IXX , and the syndrome 00 might 
be due to XXX . Such double or triple bit-flip errors, although theoretically possible, 
are less frequent. Their probability is of the order O(s2) or lower, making them less 
likely when compared to single bit-flip errors, especially when the single qubit error 
rate s is sufficiently low.
Moreover, the Shor three-qubit bit-flip code is specifically designed to counteract 
bit-flip errors. Consequently, errors involving phase flips, represented by IIZ , IZI , 
or ZII, are not detected. Each of these transforms the state Y |000) + 5 |111) to 
Y |000) — 5 1111), with the parity unaffected. This limitation underscores the necessity 
of the phase-flip code.

12.4 Introduction to Error Correction Codes
380
Exercise 12.23 Reflect on the potential benefits of incorporating a third ancilla to 
measure the parity of q2 and q3. Could it enhance the capability to detect more 
types of errors?
Exercise 12.24 Investigate if the Shor three-qubit bit-flip code can detect and 
correct errors that results from random applications of Y gates. Aim to construct 
a table akin to Table 12.1 and an error correction code analogous to Fig. 12.12.
12.4.2 Three-Qubit Phase-Flip Code
The Shor phase-flip code is similar to its bit-flip counterpart, as illustrated in 
Fig. 12.13. The application of a Hadamard rotation transforms bit-flip operations 
to correct phase flips.
Figure 12.13: Quantum Circuit for the Three-Qubit Phase-Flip Code
The Three-Qubit Phase-Flip Code maps the initial qubit state |$) = a |0) + P |1) 
to a three-qubit state as follows:
|^0 = |^)L = a |+ L) + P |-L} = a |+ + +) + P |------- } , 
(12.120)
where + = -±2 (|0) + |1)) and |— = -±2 (|0) - |1)).
After the application of the logical gate UL , the system state becomes:
|*2)  = Y |+ + +) + 3 |------- }.
(12.121)
Exercise 12.25 Show that for the three-qubit phase-flip code, ZZZ functions as 
the logical bit-flip operator XL.
A phase-flip error can be modeled as random applications of Z gates on data 
qubits, since Z |+) = |—) and Z |—) = |+). For instance, applying Z to q 1 (equivalent 
to ZII) flips the phase in q1. This noise alters the state of the data qubits to:
|*3> = Y |- + +) + 3 |+ --).

Using the Hadamard gates, we can translate y |—++) + 6 |+------) into Y 1100) +
6 |011) and revert it. This process enables the CNOT gates to detect any noise- 
induced modifications to the qubits. For instance, in our scenario, the error manifests 
as a syndrome 11.

The error can be rectified by applying a Z gate to the affected qubit (in our 
scenario, q1), restoring the system state to:

The decoder circuit, represented by D in Fig. 12.13, mirrors the encoder circuit.
It decodes |^4) back to y |0) + 6 11), equivalent to U |^).
Similar to the three-qubit bit-flip code, the three-qubit phase-flip Code is not 
equipped to detect double or triple phase-flip errors, nor any bit-flip errors.
Exercise 12.26 Modify the circuit in Fig. 12.13 for the three-qubit phase-flip code 
to employ classically controlled X gates instead of classically controlled Z gates 
for error correction.
12.4.3 * Nine-Qubit Shor Code
The nine-qubit Shor code, introduced by Peter Shor in 1995, represents one of the 
pioneering quantum error-correcting codes. This code is devised by concatenating the 
three-qubit bit-flip and three-qubit phase-flip codes, as demonstrated in Fig. 12.14. 
This construction allows for the correction of any single-qubit errors, which will be 
elaborated upon subsequently.
1 Encoding
The encoding process integrates both the phase-flip and bit-flip codes, encoding the 
logical qubits of the phase-flip code using the bit-flip code.
The initial CNOT and Hadamard gates perform phase-flip code encoding on 
the qubits q1 , q4, and q7 . Following this first-level encoding, the state of the entire 
nine-qubit system evolves as:
0 ^ -18(|0) + |1» |00> (|0> + |1» |00> (|0> + |1» |00>, 
(12.124a)
|1) ^ -8(|0> - |1» |00> (|0> - |1» |00> (|0> - |1» |00>. 
(12.124b)

Figure 12.14: Quantum Circuit for the Nine-Qubit Shor Code
The CNOT gates that follow execute bit-flip code encoding on qubits qi through 
q9. This operation transitions the basis states to their corresponding logical states:
|0) ^ |0l) = -=(|000) + I111)) (|000> + I111)) (|000> + |111>), 
(12.125a)
|1) ^ |1 l} = ^1=(|000> - |111» (|000> - |111» (|000> - |111»- 
(12.125b)
A quantum state generally represented as |^) = a |0) + P |1) is encoded into:
|^i) = |^l} = a |0l} + P |1 l} -
(12.126)
Exercise 12.27 Elucidate the reason that the encoding procedure, as presented 
in Fig. 12.14, does not directly result in 0 ^ |+ + + + + + + + +) and |1) ^ 
|------------------------- ), but rather adheres to the transformation depicted in
Eq. 12.125. Reference: § 7.3.3.
2 
Logical Gates
When employing an error-correction code, qubit gates must be translated into the 
corresponding logical gates (i.e., logical operations) that act on the encoded logical 
states. Consider a unitary gate U:
U(a |0) + /3 |1))= y |0) + 5 |1) -
(12.127)
The logical U gate, denoted by UL, is to be compatible with the error correction 
code, meaning it transforms a logical basis state to another logical basis state or a 
superposition of such states. After applying UL, the system state is given by:
|tyj) = Y |0L) + 5 |1 L)
= -Y=(|000> + |111» (|000> + |111» (|000> + |111»
+ -5_(|000> - |m>) (|000> - |111>) (|000> - |1U>)-
(12.128a)
(12.128b)

Designing logical gates poses significant challenges. The following exercises offer 
an introductory exploration. The Clifford group, which includes Pauli gates (X, 
Y , Z), the Hadamard gate (H), the phase gate (S), and the CNOT gate, can be 
efficiently implemented with fault tolerance in various quantum error-correcting 
codes. For more discussion, refer to § 7.2.2.
Exercise 12.28 The operator Z 1 Z4Z7 interchanges the amplitudes of the logical 
qubit states, effectively acting as a logical X gate (XL). Demonstrate how 
applying Z 1 Z4Z7 to the state a |0L) + fl |1 L) results in a |1 L) + fl |0L).
Similarly, a logical Z gate (ZL) modifies the phase between the logical states. 
Show that applying ZL = X 1 X2X3 to a |0L) + fl |1 L) transforms it into a |0L) — 
fl |1 L}, thus serving as a logical Z gate.
The nine-qubit Shor code supports multiple implementations of both XL and 
ZL. Identify two additional operators for each that fulfill the logical X and Z 
functions, respectively.

Error Syndrome Measurement and Correction
As shown in Fig. 12.15, the nine-qubit Shor code utilizes three blocks of the 
three-qubit bit-flip code. Each block can detect and correct a bit-flip error within 
its group of three qubits. Similarly, for phase errors, the Shor code employs the 
three-qubit phase-flip code on three encoded qubits, one from each of the three 

12.4 Introduction to Error Correction Codes
384
blocks. This structure, combined with the associated Hadamard gates, can detect 
which block (if any) had a phase-flip error and correct it.
We will examine a few typical scenarios with examples next.
4 
Bit-Flip Error
When a bit-flip error occurs, for instance, on q5 , the system state becomes:
Y 
3
|*3>  = —^ (•••) (|010> + |101» (•••) + —=(•••) (|010> - |101» (•••)- 
(12.129)
For clarity, in the preceding equation and in subsequent discussions, the changed 
bit is highlighted, and the unchanged blocks are represented using (• • •).
This bit-flip error is detected by the second block of the bit-flip code, yielding 
the error syndrome s3s4 = 10. Consequently, the corrective X gate is applied to q5, 
returning the system state to |*4) = |*2).
5 Phase-Flip Error
When a phase-flip error takes place, for instance, on q5 , the system state evolves to:
Y3
|*3>  = -—=(•••) (|000> - |111» (•••) + —=(•••) (|000> + 1111» (•••)- 
(12.130)
This phase-flip error is identified by the phase-flip code, generating the error 
syndrome s7s8 = 10. As a result, the corrective Z gate is applied to q4, bringing the 
system state back to |*4) = |*2).
Note that the Shor code cannot distinguish which of the qubits q4, q5 , or q6 
has experienced a phase-flip. This inability to differentiate is referred to as error 
degeneracy, a phenomenon where different errors yield the same syndrome. However, 
this lack of specificity in pinpointing the exact qubit does not hinder the ability 
to correct the error. The Shor code can effectively correct the phase flip without 
needing to know which of the qubits was affected.
6 General Single-Qubit Error
Consider a single-qubit error acting on q5 such that:
|0)^ a |0) + b |1), 
(12.131a)
|1)^ c |0) + d |1) - 
(12.131b)
The resulting system state can be represented as:
3
|*3)  — —— (• • •) (a |000) + b 1010) + c 1101) + d 1111)) (• • •) 
8
+—Y=(- ••) (a |000) + b |010) - c 1101) - d 1111)) (•••)-
(12.132)
To categorize bit-flip and phase-flip errors, we introduce the following relation­
ships: p+ q — a, p - q — d, u + v — b, and u - v — c. The terms are then rearranged 
as outlined in Table 12.3.

Table 12.3: Error Syndrome for the Nine-Qubit Shor Code
As delineated in Table 12.3, a general single-qubit error can manifest in one of 
four scenarios:
1. No error.
2. Bit flip, corrected using an X gate.
3. Phase flip, corrected using a Z gate.
4. Both bit and phase flip, corrected using both X and Z gates.
Exercise 12.29 Construct an error syndrome and correction table similar to 
Table 12.3, assuming a general single-qubit error has occurred in qubit q7, instead 
of q5. For each scenario, identify the appropriate correction gate(s) in Fig. 12.15.
A pertinent question arises: how is it possible for a general error characterized 
by continuous coefficients a, b, c, and d to be effectively corrected using only four 
discrete scenarios? The answer is rooted in the fundamental properties of quantum 
measurements. When one conducts bit- and phase-flip parity-check measurements 
on the system, it collapses the system’s state to one wherein either a bit or phase flip 
has transpired, or it hasn’t, contingent on the outcome of the measurement. This 
inherent quantum behavior equips us with the capability to address a spectrum of 
errors merely by executing bit- and phase-flip checks.
Alternatively, we can analyze nine-qubit Shor code using a Pauli noise channel 
(see § 12.3.2), which is expressed as:
NPauli( P) = (1 — sx — sy — sz ) IPI + sxXPX + syY PY + sz ZPZ, 
(12.133)
where sx , sy , and sz are the probabilities of each Pauli error. We find that scenario 
(1) above corresponds to I in the Pauli channel, scenario (2) to X, (3) to Z, and (4) 
to Y.
7 
Decoding
The decoder’s role is to transform the logical qubit state y |0L) + 5 |1 L) back to 
Y 0 + 5 11), which is U |^). This is achieved by applying the CNOT gates and H 
gates in the reverse order of the encoder.
8 
Sequential vs. Oneshot Operation
A quantum computation task is typically carried out with a sequence of gates. As 
errors accumulate above a certain threshold, error detection and state recovery are

purpose by repeating the blocks between |^2) and |^4).

Figure 12.16: Nine-Qubit Shor Code Simplified for Oneshot Operation
The Shor code can also be used for quantum communication in which quantum 
states are transmitted subject to noise. In this case, the repetition of the middle 
blocks is often unnecessary, and the circuit can be simplified, as illustrated in 
Fig. 12.16. In particular, the error correction process can be postponed until after 
the decoding, which eliminates the need for ancillary qubits.
9 
Limitations
We have seen that the Shor code can correct an arbitrary error on a single qubit. 
When considering simultaneous multi-qubit errors, the situation becomes more 
complex. Nevertheless, these scenarios are less frequent. Their probability is on 
the order of O(s2), making them less probable compared to single bit-flip errors, 
especially when the single qubit error rate s is sufficiently small.
While repetition codes, such as the Shor code, elucidate the principle of error 
correction, they are often too inefficient for practical application. This has motivated 
the search for more efficient codes. A notable example is the seven-qubit Steane 
code. To delve deeper into such error correction codes, additional mathematical 
tools, like the stabilizer formalism, are required. These will be introduced in the 
subsequent subsection.
Exercise 12.30 For the simplified version of the nine-qubit Shor code depicted 
in Fig. 12.14, derive the system state at different stages (|^1) through |^5)) for 
each type of single-qubit error: bit-flip, phase-flip, and general errors.
12.4.4 * Parity Measurements, Stabilizers, and Code Distance
Fundamental to the study of quantum error-correction codes are the inter-related 
concepts of parity measurements, stabilizer codes, and code distance.
1 
Parity Measurements
Parity measurements constitute a type of joint measurement on multiple qubits, 
as discussed in § 6.2.2. For a two-qubit system, PZ = Z ® Z can distinguish 

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
387
between the even parity states |^even) = a |00) + 0 |11) and odd parity states 
|^odd) = y |01) + S 110). Similarly, PX = X ® X can be used to measure phase parity.
In the discussion of the Shor code in preceding sections, we have employed 
parity measurements. Specifically, PZ is used for the error syndrome measurement 
associated with bit flips, while PX facilitates the error syndrome measurement 
related to phase flips.
The stabilizer formalism discussed next can be viewed as a generalization of the 
concept of parity measurements.
2 
The Stabilizer Formalism
The stabilizer formalism is a framework that enables the efficient description and 
manipulation of quantum states and operations pertinent to quantum error correction. 
Rather than representing these entities in Hilbert space, the formalism treats them 
in the operator picture as elements of a stabilizer group. This framework proves 
essential in analyzing advanced error correction codes.
Stabilizers are a set of operators that commute with each other and stabilize 
a given quantum state, meaning they leave the state invariant under their action. 
Formally, if |^) is a quantum state and S is an operator belonging to the stabilizer 
group, then S |^) = |^).
The stabilizer formalism is useful because it allows for a compact representation 
of certain quantum error-correcting codes. For instance, in the three-qubit bit-flip 
code, the encoded logical state has the form |^)L = a |000) + ^ 1111). The set of 
these error-free states, referred to as the code space, are described by the associated 
stabilizers ZZI, IZZ, and ZIZ. All states within the code space are simultaneous 
+1 eigenstates of these stabilizers.
Stabilizer place constraints on the permissible states of the code space. When 
an error affects a qubit, it alters the eigenvalues of the stabilizers. Measuring these 
stabilizers allows one to diagnose which qubit is in error and subsequently correct 
it, without disturbing the error-free logical states, which are eigenstates of the 
stabilizers.
For example, the error syndrome detection for the three-qubit bit-flip code shown 
in Fig. 12.12 employs two parity measurements: one between the first and second 
qubits, and another between the first and third qubits. These parity measurements 
correspond to measuring the stabilizers ZZI and ZIZ , respectively. Using only two 
out of the three stabilizers is sufficient because the product of any two stabilizers 
yields the third.
For the nine-qubit Shor code, the stabilizer group consists of operators that act 
on nine qubits, including:
ZZIIIIIII, ZIZIIIIII, IIIZZIIII, IIIZIZIII, 
IIIIIIZZI, IIIIIIZIZ, XXXXXXI I I, I I IXXXXXX.
The above operators form the minimal set of independent stabilizers that uniquely 
define the code space, often referred to as stabilizer generators. Every state in the 
code space is a +1 eigenstate of each of these stabilizers. These stabilizer generators 
are specifically the operators that are measured in the error syndrome detection 
circuit, as illustrated in Fig. 12.15. Their measurements make it possible to identify 

12.4 Introduction to Error Correction Codes
388
and correct both bit-flip (X) and phase-flip (Z) errors without disturbing the encoded 
quantum information.
Exercise 12.31 Explain why these are not stabilizers for the nine-qubit Shor code: 
ZIIZIIIII, ZZZIIIIII, XXXIIIIII, and ZZZZZZIII.
Exercise 12.32 Explain why these are stabilizers but not included as generators in 
the table above for the nine-qubit Shor code: IZZIIIIII, andXXXIIIXXX.
3 
Code Distance
The code distance, often denoted as d, is a metric in quantum error correction 
that signifies the minimum number of qubit errors required to transform one valid 
encoded state (codeword) into another without detection by the code’s syndrome 
measurements.
The three-qubit bit-flip code can correct a single bit-flip error, such as XII. It 
can also detect a double bit-flip errors like XXI, even though cannot correct it 
due to syndrome ambiguity with the single bit-flip error IIX . Therefore, the code 
distance for bit-flip errors is d = 3. On the other hand, the code is not designed to 
detect or correct phase-flip errors, rendering its code distance for phase-flip errors as 
d= 1.
In contrast, the nine-qubit Shor code is designed to correct for one arbitrary 
error on any of the nine qubits. It would take at least three such arbitrary errors 
to go undetected. Therefore, it has a code distance of d = 3 for both bit-flip and 
phase-flip errors.
12.4.5 * Further Exploration
The field of quantum error correction (QEC) is critical in advancing the development 
of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Given that real-world quantum 
devices invariably encounter various types of noise and errors, a robust understanding 
and effective mitigation of these imperfections are fundamental. For those interested 
in delving deeper into error correction strategies and noise reduction techniques 
in quantum computing, the following topics and references are recommended for 
extended exploration:
1 
Advancements in Efficient QEC
The development of quantum error-correcting codes has been a cornerstone in 
the advancement of quantum computing. The first such code, known as Shor’s 
9-qubit code, laid the foundation for subsequent innovations. Following this, Andrew 
Steane introduced a more efficient code, known as Steane’s code, which could detect 
and correct any single-qubit error using only 7 physical qubits to encode 1 logical 
qubit[84]. Further progress was made by Raymond Laflamme and colleagues, who 
developed codes that required as few as 5 qubits[64].
Surface codes represent another significant class of quantum error-correcting codes. 
Characterized as topological quantum error-correcting codes, they are implemented 
on a two-dimensional lattice of qubits[34]. The error correction in surface codes 
leverages the lattice’s topology. Although surface codes generally necessitate a larger 

Chapter 12. Quantum Error Correction: A Primer
389
number of qubits than the likes of Steane’s or Laflamme’s codes, they are highly 
valued for their high fault tolerance and adaptability to two-dimensional grid layouts 
with nearest-neighbor qubit interactions.
Recent advancements in quantum error correction have seen the emergence of 
new codes, notably within the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) family, that 
promise a tenfold increase in efficiency compared to traditional methods[29]. These 
innovative LDPC codes achieve effective error correction with a reduced qubit 
requirement, marking a pivotal step towards the realization of scalable and practical 
quantum computing. This evolution reflects the ongoing progress in quantum error 
correction, moving from the original Shor’s 9-qubit code to increasingly resource­
efficient solutions.
An emerging strategy in quantum error correction is the concept of erasure 
conversion. This method transforms various quantum errors into erasure errors, 
whose locations are known, thereby simplifying their correction. Recognized for its 
potential to reduce error correction complexity and overhead, erasure conversion is 
seen as a key strategy for enhancing quantum computing efficiency. This approach 
could significantly streamline the error correction process, marking a crucial step 
towards scalable and practical quantum computing[49, 91].

Holonomic and Topological Quantum Computation
Holonomic quantum computation (HQC) and topological quantum computation 
(TQC) are advanced approaches to quantum computing. Both leverage specific 
non-local properties of quantum systems for quantum operations, offering inherent 
resistance to certain types of errors.
The underlying principle of HQC involves exploiting the global properties (or 
geometry) of quantum systems, rather than their local properties (such as the 
quantum state). In HQC, computation is realized by cyclically moving the system 
within its parameter space (for instance, on the surface of the Bloch sphere). During 
this movement, the system acquires geometric phases (or Berry’s phases) correspond­
ing to the solid angles enclosed by its trajectory. As a result of relying on global 
properties, HQC displays a commendable resilience against local errors.
On the other hand, TQC derives its computational capability from the braiding 
of anyons. These anyons are exotic quasiparticles present in two-dimensional systems, 
distinguished from both fermions and bosons (see § 6.3.4). The topological nature 
of the quantum state, upon which the computation is built, ensures that local 
disturbances have minimal impact on the results. Such topological protection 
provides a potential pathway for fault-tolerant quantum computation.
As of early 2024, while HQC principles have seen experimental validation across 
several qubit systems, TQC remains more elusive. Although TQC boasts a robust 
theoretical foundation, its experimental realization presents significant challenges. 
Notably, the controlled observation and braiding of anyons remain at the forefront 
of quantum research.

12.5 Summary and Conclusions
Essentials of Quantum Error Correction
In this chapter, our emphasis was on elucidating the nuances of quantum error 
correction, a domain that has emerged as vital for the progression and practicality of 
quantum computing. Given the inherent sensitivity of quantum systems to noise and 
their potential to lose coherence, understanding errors, their causes, and methods to 
rectify them is paramount.
We began our journey by emphasizing the importance of preliminary concepts, 
shedding light on the challenges posed by noise and decoherence. By drawing 
distinctions between decoherence, noise, and errors, we underscored the unique 
features and manifestations of each, leading to a clearer understanding of the 
quantum noise problem.
Density Operators and Mixed States
Transitioning from state vectors, we introduced the mathematical framework of 
density operators, a powerful tool to capture the subtleties of mixed quantum 
states. The relevance of density operators in modeling diverse quantum operations, 
especially in the context of noise and decoherence, was highlighted.
We navigated through their fundamental properties, delving into the computation 
of expected values, the representation of qubit states, and their interpretation on 
the Bloch sphere. This not only expanded our understanding of quantum states but 
also provided a lens to appreciate the richness of quantum mechanics.
Error Mechanisms and Error Correction
Our discourse then veered towards the core focus: the diverse error mechanisms in 
quantum computing. We identified and elaborated on coherent errors, characterized 
by their systematic nature, and incoherent errors, which arise due to stochastic 
interactions with the environment. Through examples such as bit-flip, phase-flip, 
and depolarizing errors, we accentuated the varied manifestations of these errors 
and the challenges they pose.
To combat these challenges, we embarked on an exploration of quantum error 

Problem Set 12

correction codes. Here, the emphasis was on introducing and dissecting the principles 
and techniques that serve as our arsenal against quantum errors. We delved into the 
Shor codes, highlighting their significance in the realm of quantum error correction, 
and underscored the importance of parity measurements, stabilizers, and code 
distance in this context.
Bridging Theory and Practice
The overarching narrative of this chapter bridges the theoretical underpinnings of 
quantum mechanics with the pragmatic challenges faced in quantum computing. By 
intertwining the mathematical formalism of density operators with real-world error 
mechanisms, we have endeavored to prepare the reader for both theoretical research 
and hands-on experimentation in quantum error correction.
The journey through this chapter offers a holistic perspective on the challenges 
and solutions in the domain of quantum error correction, laying the groundwork for 
the subsequent discussions and further explorations in this dynamic field.
Upcoming Topics
The upcoming chapter provides an exploration of quantum information theory. It 
begins by contrasting quantum probability with classical probability, highlighting 
unique quantum aspects like entanglement. The chapter then discusses quantum en­
tropy and information, comparing these with classical concepts. Finally, it delves into 
advanced topics like the quantum data processing inequality and the Holevo theorem, 
emphasizing their theoretical and practical importance in quantum communications.

The field of information theory underwent a significant shift with the introduction of 
quantum mechanics. The principles that govern the world of atoms and photons pro­
vided a new perspective for reimagining the foundation of information. This chapter 
begins an explorative journey from the familiar territory of classical information to 
the mysterious and less intuitive realm of quantum information.
Classical information theory, rooted in the seminal work of Claude Shannon, 
laid the foundation for understanding the transmission, processing, and encoding 
of information within a probabilistic framework. Central to this theory is the 
concept of Shannon entropy, which quantifies the uncertainty or information content 

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information 
397
in a classical system. Classical systems, governed by deterministic laws, utilize 
probabilities to address the incomplete knowledge about the system. Despite their 
deterministic nature, probabilistic methods in classical information theory are crucial 
for managing uncertainties inherent in information transmission and processing.
In contrast, quantum information theory is deeply intertwined with the inherent 
probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, a fundamental departure from classical 
theories. In quantum mechanics, probabilities do not merely represent a lack of 
knowledge but are an intrinsic aspect of quantum states. This intrinsic probabilistic 
nature is encapsulated by the Born rule, which governs the probabilities of various 
outcomes when measurements are made on quantum states. Consequently, quantum 
information theory offers a richer framework for encoding and processing information, 
taking into account the phenomena of superposition and entanglement. Analogous to 
Shannon entropy in classical systems, von Neumann entropy extends these concepts 
to the quantum realm, accommodating the unique properties of quantum states and 
their non-classical correlations.
The significance of quantum probability and entropy transcends the mere exten­
sion of classical concepts into the quantum domain. They are the cornerstone for 
understanding quantum coherence and correlations, which have no classical counter­
part. Quantum entropy not only measures information but also captures the degree 
of entanglement—a unique resource for quantum computing and communication. 
The interplay between quantum probability, entropy, and information fosters new 
potential for advancements that include the enhanced efficiency of quantum algo­
rithms, the establishment of secure communication channels, and the development 
of quantum error correction techniques.
In exploring the fundamentals of quantum information, we lay the groundwork 
that will enable researchers and practitioners to actively engage in and further 
the quantum revolution in computation, communication, and measurement. This 
foundational knowledge is essential for those who aspire to drive the forthcoming 
era of technological innovations in quantum information science.
Prerequisite Review: Mixed States and Density Operators
Mixed states and density operators are detailed in § 12.2. Here is a brief summary 
of the concepts and formulas essential for this chapter.
• A mixed quantum state is a statistical ensemble of multiple potential pure 
states. It encapsulates both quantum uncertainty and classical uncertainty. 
A mixed qudit state with probability pi of |$i) G Cd, i = 1,... ,n, can be 
described by a density operator:
p = £ Pi |^)(^i |. 
(13.1)
i=1
• Properties of density operators:
- Hermitian: p^ = p
- Positive Semidefinite: (^| p |^) > 0 for all |^) G Cd
- Unit Trace: tr(p) = ' pii = 1
i=1
• A density operator has a diagonal form in its eigenbasis, corresponding to 
the canonical states of the quantum system:

398
p = 
Xi |XiXXi|, 
(13.2)
i =1
with Xi > 0 and 5 ' Xi = 1.
• Applying a unitary transformation U G Cdx d transforms p as
p ^ UpU+. 
(13.3)
• Measuring p in orthonormal basis {|fa)} yields outcome |fa) with probability:
Pi = (fa| p |fa) =tr(p |faXfa|). 
(13.4)
Following the measurement, the ensemble of measurement outcomes is given 
by
d
pm ^52 Pi 1 ^i^i 1 , 
(13.5)
i =1
which is diagonal in the measurement basis. This represents the equivalence 
of state collapse in the context of mixed states.
In the more general POVM measurement framework, a measurement outcome 
corresponds to a POVM operator Ei, and the probability pi of observing 
outcome i is given by:
Pi =tr( pEi). 
(13.6)
• For a composite system consisting of two independent subsystems, A described 
by pa and B by pB , the combined density operator is given by
pAB = pA ® pB. 
(13.7)
• Partial trace of a density operator provides a way to focus on a subset of 
a larger system by summing over (and effectively ignoring) the rest of the 
system. The partial trace over subsystem A, or the reduced density operator 
of subsystem B, is given by
pA = trB (pAB ) = 
i| B pab |i) B , 
(13.8)
where {| i) B} is any orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space of subsystem B.
Density Operator: Pillar of Quantum Probability and Information
The density operator plays key roles in quantum probability and information, as a 
versatile and foundational construct in quantum mechanics, underpinning concepts 
such as von Neumann entropy and quantum information.
• The density operator p, being Hermitian, can be diagonalized to reveal a 
probability distribution over its constituent eigenstates. Each eigenvalue Xi 
of p corresponds to the probability of finding the system in the associated 
eigenstate | Xi). This structure allows p to represent both pure and mixed 
states in a unified framework.

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
399
• In quantum communication, the density operator can represent mixed states 
arising from noise and environmental interactions, essential for quantum error 
correction and channel capacity.
When a state p is measured in an orthonormal basis {|fa)}, the resulting post­
measurement ensemble is captured by a new density operator pm . Diagonal 
elements of pm , given by {fa | p| fa), form a probability distribution over the 
measurement basis states, reflecting the outcome probabilities. (See discussion 
around Eq. 12.48.)
• Quantum coherence, encapsulated in the off-diagonal elements of p in a given 
basis, is fundamental to quantum computation and information processing. 
It represents the superposition of states and is a key resource for quantum 
algorithms, enabling quantum parallelism and interference.
• Purity and entropy, critical in quantum thermodynamics and information 
theory, are derived from the density operator’s properties. Purity, indicating 
the degree of mixedness of a state, is given by tr(p2), while von Neumann 
entropy, measuring the informational content, is — tr(plog p).
13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials
Quantum information science is deeply rooted in the principles of probability theory. 
In this section, we examine the fundamental components of probability theory as they 
apply to quantum information science. Beginning with a discussion of each concept 
within the classical framework, we then establish parallels with their quantum 
mechanical counterparts. This comparative analysis enhances our understanding of 
the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum systems.

13.1.1 Distinctive Features of Quantum Probability
While quantum probability encompasses the general structure of classical probability, 
it introduces several key features that set it apart, fundamentally altering our 
understanding of probabilistic phenomena.

13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials
400
1 
Complex-Valued Probability Amplitudes
In classical probability, probabilities are real numbers between 0 and 1. Quantum 
mechanics, however, uses complex-valued probability amplitudes. These amplitudes, 
when squared, give the probabilities of various outcomes. The use of complex 
numbers allows for the phenomenon of quantum superposition, where a quantum 
state can simultaneously exist in multiple states. This superposition is a cornerstone 
of quantum mechanics, leading to interference effects that have no counterpart in 
classical probability.
2 
Entanglement
Entanglement introduces correlations between quantum systems that are non-existent 
in classical systems. When two particles are entangled, their quantum states 
become so interlinked that the state of one particle correlates with the state of the 
other, regardless of the distance separating them. This leads to joint probability 
distributions that cannot be decomposed into independent probabilities of each 
entangled component. This nonlocal property of entangled systems profoundly 
affects the interpretation and calculation of probabilities in quantum systems.
3 
Non-commutativity of Quantum Observables
Another fundamental aspect of quantum probability is the non-commutative nature 
of quantum observables. When two operators do not commute, the precise sequence 
of measurements affects the observed probabilities. This is exemplified by the 
Heisenberg uncertainty principle (see § 1.6), which states that certain pairs of 
observables, like rectilinear and circular polarizations, cannot be simultaneously 
measured with arbitrary precision. The non-commutativity of observables can lead 
to complex probability distributions and correlations that cannot be replicated in 
classical probability theory.
13.1.2 Sample Space, Events, and Probability Distribution
1 Classical Probability
Random Experiments
In classical probability, a random experiment or trial is defined as a process with 
a definitive set of possible outcomes, which cannot be precisely predicted in ad­
vance. Such an experiment can be replicated under consistent conditions, with each 
repetition being independent of the others.
Sample Space
The sample space, denoted Q = {s 1, s 2,..., sn}, encompasses all conceivable out­
comes of an experiment, with each si representing a unique outcome. This space 
can be finite or countably infinite for discrete cases and must fulfill two criteria:
1. Exhaustiveness: It should encompass all potential outcomes.
2. Mutual Exclusivity: No two outcomes should simultaneously occur in a single 
trial.
Events
An event, denoted as E, is any subset of the sample space, E C Q. An event E 
occurs if the outcome of the random experiment is contained within E. An event 

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information 
401
may be an elementary event (consisting of a single outcome) or a compound event 
(comprising multiple outcomes).
■ Example 13.1 The roll of a six-sided die constitutes a random experiment, with 
the sample space represented by Q = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.
The event of rolling an even number on the die is E = {2, 4, 6}. The event of 
rolling an odd number on the die is O = {1, 3, 5}. E and O are exhaustive and 
mutually exclusive. 
■
Probability Distribution
A probability distribution assigns a probability to each experiment outcome. These 
assignments adhere to:
1. Non-Negativity: Probabilities are always non-negative.
2. Normalization: The sum of all outcome probabilities equals 1.
3. Additivity: The probability of the union of two distinct events is the sum of 
their individual probabilities.
■ Example 13.2 For a fair die, the probability distribution over Q is uniform:
pi = p({i}) = 6 for each i e Q. 
(13.9)
Thus, the probability of event E (rolling an even number) is:
p (E) = p ({2}) + p ({4}) + p ({6}) = 1 + 6 + 1 = 1. 
(13.10)
■
2 Quantum Generalization
Sample Space: Spectrum of an Observable
In quantum mechanics, the classical concept of a sample space is reinterpreted as the 
spectrum of an observable, represented by a Hermitian operator H . The eigenvalues 
{Xi} of this operator represent the possible results we can obtain when measuring 
the observable. Each eigenvalue has a corresponding eigenvector (or a subspace 
when there’s degeneracy), which represents the quantum state the system will be in 
if we obtain that specific measurement outcome (see § 3.4).
More generally, a quantum sample space can be represented by an orthonormal 
basis in the Hilbert space of the system, where measurements are conducted.
Events: Quantum Measurements
In the quantum realm, events are paralleled by measurements. For an observable 
H, distinct eigenvalues correspond to orthogonal eigenstates {|Xi)}, analogous to 
classical mutually exclusive events. These eigenstates form a complete basis set in 
the Hilbert space, akin to a complete set of events.
More generally, quantum measurements can be described by POVM (Positive 
Operator-Valued Measure) operators {Ei }. While some scenarios allow Ei to 
correspond to projective measurements like |Xi){Xi |, associated with the eigenstates 
of observables, POVMs offer a more generalized framework and can represent a 

13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials
402
broader set of outcomes. For example, two POVM operators could represent the 
aggregate events of rolling an even or odd number on a die.
Probability Distribution: The Born Rule
The Born rule dictates the probabilities of measurement outcomes in quantum 
mechanics, forming the basis for quantum probability distribution. The probabilistic 
behavior of a quantum system is fully characterized by its state vector |^) for pure 
states or density operator p for mixed states. The state vector |^) is associated 
with the inherent quantum randomness of measurements, while p accounts for both 
quantum and classical randomness due to statistical mixtures of states.
The probability pi of observing a particular outcome Xi of an observable is given 
by:
!
| (Xi|^) |2 = (^ |Xi)(Xi| ^) for a pure state, 
[Xi|p|Xi) = tr(p |Xi)(Xi|) for a mixed state.
For POVM measurements, outcome probabilities for each Ei are:
!
(^ | Ei | ^) for a pure state, 
tr(pEi) for a mixed state.
(13.11)
(13.12)
13.1.3 Random Variables and Expected Values
1 
Classical Probability
A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value (or other mathematical 
constructs) to each outcome in the sample space of a random experiment. For 
example, a random variable X representing the result of rolling a die conventionally 
assumes values in the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, but it may also assume values in some 
other set, e.g., {-3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3}. The assignment may even be many-to-one, e.g., 
{o, e, o, e, o, e}.
As introduced above, a probability distribution assigns a probability to each 
outcome in a sample space. While a probability distribution originates from the 
concept of a sample space, it can also be defined in the context of random variables. In 
the latter case, a probability distribution describes how probabilities are distributed 
over the different possible values that the random variable can take. In the above 
example of rolling a die, the probability distribution can be expressed as p(X = 
x) = 6 for x = 1, 2,..., 6.
When a random variable employs a many-to-one assignment to map outcomes 
in the sample space to numerical values, it effectively aggregates those outcomes 
under the assigned values. This aggregation may result in a probability distribution 
for the random variable that differs from the original distribution of outcomes in 
the sample space.
For example, let X represent whether the outcome of rolling a die is even 
or odd. It takes the value e for outcomes {2, 4,6} and o for {1, 3, 5}. Now, 
P (X = e) = P (X = o) = 1 •
Events can also be described in terms of random variables. For example,

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
403
I
E = {X < 3} is an event representing the outcome of rolling a die taking on a 
value at most 3.
The expected value (or expectation value) quantifies the statistical average of 
a random variable, weighted by its probability distribution, indicating the central 
tendency of the distribution. For instance, the expected value of a fair die’s roll is
.6,
E [ X ] = 
x • P (X = x) = 3 ■ 5 ■
(13.13)
2 
Quantum Generalization
An observable in quantum mechanics can be considered a generalization of a classical 
random variable because it describes the possible outcomes of a measurement (a 
random process) and their associated probabilities. However, unlike classical random 
variables, which directly map outcomes to real numbers, the outcomes of measuring 
an observable are determined by the eigenvalues of its operator, and the probability 
of each outcome is given by the state of the system before measurement.
Much like in the classical case, the expected value of an observable tells us about 
the average result we’d see if we measured it many times, given the quantum state 
of the system. The expected value of an observable H is given by:
<H) =
{^ | H |^) for a pure state, 
tr(pH) for a mixed state■
(13.14)
The variance of an observable H , which is equal to the square of the standard 
deviation and quantifies the spread of measurement outcomes (see § 3.4.6), is 
calculated as:
(AH)2 = (H2) - (H)2 =
(^ | H2 |^— ^ | H |^)2 for a pure state, 
tr(pH2) — (tr(pH))2 for a mixed state■
(13.15)
Exercise 13.1 Consider a two-qubit system where 50% of the system is in the 
uniform mixed state described by the density operator 41, with I being the 4 x 4 
identity operator, and 50% of the system is in the Bell state —= (|00) + |11)). The 
system is measured with the observable H = Z ® Z, where Z = aZ denotes the 
Pauli-Z operator. Calculate:
(a) The density operator of the system, p.
(b) The eigenvalues and eigenstates of the observable H.
(c) The probability of obtaining each eigenvalue of H as the measurement 
outcome.
(d) The expected value of the measurement, (H).
(e) The variance of the measurement outcomes, (AH)2.

13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials
404
Key Takeaways
In quantum probability, quantum observables fulfill the role of random variables. 
The density operator encapsulates both classical and quantum randomness of 
a system. Measurements correspond to probabilistic events and are made with 
respect to the eigenbasis of an observable, serving as the sample space. The 
probability distribution is governed by the Born rule.
13.1.4 Multiple Random Variables
1 Classical Probability
Analyzing multiple random variables involves understanding their interactions and 
the consequent impact on their probabilities. Although we focus on two random 
variables, for simplicity, these principles extend to more variables.
Probabilities of Two Random Variables
Consider two random variables, X and Y, defined over the same sample space Q. We 
examine specific events associated with these variables, represented by the outcomes 
x for X and y for Y . The probabilities linked to these events are outlined as follows:
• Joint Probability: The probability of x and y occurring together is denoted 
as p(X = x,Y = y), p(x A y), or simply p(x, y), where p(x, y) = p(y, x). The 
joint probability distribution, denoted as p(X, Y), represents p(x, y) for all 
possible values of x and y .
• Conditional Probability: This is the probability of event x given event y, 
denoted as p(x|y). Note that p(x|y) may not equal p(y|x). We also extend 
this concept to the conditional probability distributions, p(X|Y) and p(Y|X).
• Marginal Probability: The probability of an event associated with one random 
variable, irrespective of the other variable, is calculated by summing over all 
outcomes of the other variable:
p(x) = 
p(x, Y = y). 
(13.16)
This process, known as “marginalization,” can also be expressed for the 
probability distribution:
p (X ) = E p (X,Y = y) • 
(13-17)
• Probability of the Union: The probability that at least one of the events x or 
y occurs is denoted as p(x U y).
Relationships Between Two Events
• Independent Events: The occurrence of one event does not affect the other. For 
example, the outcomes of two rolls of a die are independent. The probabilities 
for independent events satisfy:
p(x, y) = p(x) • p(y), p(x |y) = p(x) •
(13.18)

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
405
• Dependent Events: One event influences the occurrence of the other, such 
as drawing cards from a deck without replacement. Their probabilities are 
related by the chain rule:
p (x, y) = p (y, x) = p (x | y) • p (y) = p (y | x) • p (x). 
(13.19)
This leads to Bayes’ Theorem:
p(x|y) = p (y | x) • p (x) 
p (y)
(13.20)
• Mutually Exclusive Events: These events cannot occur simultaneously, imply­
ing:
p(x,y) = 0, p(x U y)= p(x)+ p(y). 
(13.21)
• Overlapping Events: These events can occur together (p(x A y) =0) and satisfy 
the inclusion-exclusion principle:
p(x u y) = p(x) + p(y) - p(x, y). 
(13.22)
This is visually represented in a Venn diagram as shown in Fig. 13.1.
Figure 13.1: Venn Diagram for Probability Relationship
Normalization Conditions
The sum of the probabilities for all possible outcomes of a random variable X equals 
1, indicating that some outcome in the sample space will occur with certainty. This 
normalization condition extends to joint and conditional probabilities:
p(x) = 1, 
x E^
EE p (x,y ) = 1, 
x€^ y€^
p(x|y) = 1.

The normalization for conditional probability (Eq. 13.23c) is valid for any given 
y e Q where p(y) > 0.

■ Example 13.3 — Classical Joint Distribution and Marginal Probability. Con­
sider two random variables, X and Y, each taking values in Q = {1, 2,..., 6} for 
fair dice.
Given two events: x is rolling a 1 on die one, and y is rolling a 3 on die two. The 
joint probability p(x, y), the probability of both x and y occurring together, is given 
by the product of the probabilities of x and y , as the dice rolls are independent:
p (x, y) = p (x) • p (y) = 1 • 6 = 36. 
(13.24)
The probability of the union of events x and y, p(x U y), representing either event 
occurring, is given by:
p(x U y)= p(x) + p(y) - p(x,y) = 6 + 1 - 36 = 36■ 
(13.25)
Now, we impose the condition that X + Y is even. In this case, X and Y are 
no longer independent. The joint probability distribution p(X, Y) becomes uniform 
over the subset of Q x Q where the sum of the dice is even, including pairs such as 
{(1, 1), (1,3), (2, 2), (2, 4),...}, each with a probability of 18. However, p (X,Y) is 
not uniform over Q x Q, as p(X, Y) = 0 if X + Y is odd.
If Alice “holds” X and Bob “holds” Y, using the marginalization formula for 
Alice’s marginal distribution
p (X ) = E p (X,Y = y), 
(13.26)
we discover that p(X) is still uniform over Q, each outcome having a probability of 
6. Similarly, for Bob’s p(Y).
This shows that if X and Y are dependent, the marginal distributions can be 
uniform over Q, despite their joint distribution p(X, Y) not being uniform over Q x Q. 
We will see a similar phenomenon with a quantum EPR pair in Example 13.4.

2 Quantum Generalization
The concepts of classical multi-variable probability are extended to the quantum 
realm, introducing additional complexities. This complexity arises primarily from 
the non-commutative nature of quantum observables, where, unlike their classical 
counterparts, the order of measurement affects the outcome. Furthermore, quantum 
states of composite systems often exhibit entanglement, a phenomenon where the 
state of each component cannot be described independently of the others. Addi­
tionally, measurements on these systems can be either local, affecting individual 
subsystems, or joint, involving multiple subsystems simultaneously (see § 6.2.2). 
We will use examples to build connections with classical probabilities and illustrate 
these complexities.
Exercise 13.2 Prerequisite Review: To understand quantum probability and 
information concerning multi-qubit states, readers are highly recommended to 
review Exercise 6.6, replicated below for convenience.
Consider three qubits (A, B, and C) in the state

|^= 
cijk 1 ijk•
(a) Find the probability of measuring the third qubit (C) with an outcome |0).
(b) After qubit C is measured and collapsed to |0), what is the joint state of 
qubits A and B? What is the state of the three-qubit system?
(c) Suppose a Bell measurement is performed on qubits A and B with an 
outcome |$+) = —2 (|00) + |11)). What is the probability of this outcome? 
What is the post-measurement state of the three-qubit system?
Commuting vs. Non-Commuting Observables
A real-valued quantum random variable corresponds to an observable X , which is a 
Hermitian operator. The eigenvalues of X represent its possible outcomes.
As detailed in § 1.6, if two observables X and Y belonging to the same quantum 
system do not commute, i.e., [X, Y] = 0, there is generally no state in which both 
X and Y have definite values simultaneously; they do not share an eigenvector. In 
practical terms, two such variables are mutually uncertain and are not simultaneously 
measurable.
For instance, consider the non-commuting Pauli operators aX and aZ for a single 
qubit in state |+) = —2(|0) + |1)). The measurement of one observable affects the 
system in a way that the subsequent measurement of the other becomes completely 
uncertain. (See exercise below.)
Thus, in quantum mechanics, the concept of joint and conditional probabilities 
for non-commuting observables does not apply in the same way it does for commuting 
observables or in classical probability theory.
Exercise 13.3 Consider the non-commuting Pauli operators aX and aZ for a 
single qubit in state |+) = -12 (|0) + |1)). Compare two measurement sequences: 
measuring aX and then aZ on the qubit, and measuring aZ and then aX. Describe 
how the first measurement affects the state of the system and thereby the outcome 
of the second measurement. Discuss the meaning of (aXaZ) in this context.
Exercise 13.4 Consider two commuting Hermitian operators U and V on a 
single-qubit system: U = V = aZ, where aZ is the Pauli-Z operator. Verify if 
(UV) = [U) [V) for the following states:
(a) |4} = |0).
(b) |>  = + = -2(|0> + |1».
*
(c) P = 1 I.
Marginal Probability Through Partial Trace
The reduced density operator calculated through the partial trace, discussed ex­
tensively in § 12.2.8, is the quantum counterpart of classical marginal probability. 
Both methodologies enable us to focus on a component within a composite system 

13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials
408
by summing over and thereby effectively disregarding the other components of the 
system.
■ Example 13.4 — Marginal Probabilities in an EPR Pair. Let’s re-examine the 
archetypal case where Alice and Bob share an EPR pair, |I+) = —2(|00) + |11)). 
(See Example 12.10 for more details.)
To calculate the marginal probability, we start with the density operator for 
|$+):
Pab = ‘MOI’' ■ 
(13.27)
The reduced density operator for Alice, obtained by tracing pAB over B, captures 
the marginal probability of her qubit:
. 11.^ 1 [1 
Pa =trb (pab ) = 2 o
0
1
(13.28)
This is a maximally mixed state, with a uniform probability distribution over |0) 
and |1), in fact in all measurement bases.
Bob’s reduced density operator is identical to Alice’s, also showing a uniform 
probability distribution over |0) and |1). 
■
Probabilities in a Product State
Let’s now examine local measurements of a composite state of two qubit A and B. 
In this case, two observables, X and Y , pertaining to qubit A and B , respectively, 
commute regardless of their commutation properties within their respective systems. 
This is because the operations act on different Hilbert spaces and do not interfere 
with each other. (See § 7.4.1.)
If the state is a product state, measurements on one qubit are independent of 
measurements on the other, similar to the classical independent events.
■ Example 13.5 — Joint and Conditional Probabilities in a Product State. 
Consider two qubits A and B in the product state |^) = |++), where |+) = 
- (0 + |1»-
(1) Measuring in Computational Basis
Suppose we measure each qubit in the computational basis. That is, we have 
two random variables X = aZA on qubit A and Y = aZB on qubit B, where aZ is 
the Pauli-Z operator.
(a) Probability of measuring qubit A in state |0) and qubit B in |1):
p(|0>, |1» = p(|01)) = | <01| + +)|2 = 4.
This probability can also be expressed in terms of the eigenvalues as p(1, -1).
(b) Conditional probability of measuring qubit A in |0) given qubit B is in |1):
P (0 A ||1> B )= P (|0> A ) = 2, due to independence.

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
409
(c) Joint probability distribution of X and Y:
p(X, Y) = p(X) • p(Y) = 2 • 1 = 1 for each outcome in {|00), |01), |10), |11)}.
(d) Conditional probability distribution of X given Y:
p(X|Y) = p(X) = 2, for each outcome in {|0), |1)}.
(e) Probability of either qubit A being in |0) or qubit B being in |1):
p(|0> U |1)) = 4, corresponding to the three outcomes {|00), |01), |11)}.
(f) Expected values (where X = aZA and Y = a zb ):
(X) = p (|0»(1)+ p (|1))(-1) = 0.
(XY) = p(|00»(1 • 1) + p(|01»(1 • (-1)) + p(|10))((-1) • 1) + p(| 11»(1 • 1) = 0.
(X + Y) = p (|Q0»(1 + 1)+ p (|01»(1 -1)+ p (|10))(-1 + 1)+ p (|11))(-1 -1) = 0.
Since measuring an observable X on system A and an observable Y on system 
B are independent events, p(X, Y) = p(X) • p(Y), p(X|Y) = p(X), and p(X U Y) = 
p (X)+ p (Y) - p (X,Y).
(2) 
Measuring in {|+), |-)} Basis
Now we measure each qubit in the {|+), |-)} basis. The corresponding random 
variables are X = aXA on qubit A and Y = aXB on qubit B, where aX is the 
Pauli-X operator.
(a) Probability of measuring qubit A in state |+) and qubit B in |-):
p (|+>, |-» = |<+ -| + +)|2 = 0.
(b) Conditional probability of measuring qubit A in |+) given qubit B is in |-):
p(|+)a 11-)B) is undefined since qubit B cannot be in |-).
(c) Joint probability distribution of X and Y :
p(X, Y) = p(X) • p(Y) = 1 for outcome |++) and 0 for {|+—), |—+), |—)}.
(d) Conditional probability distribution of X given Y :
p(X|Y) is defined only if Y is |+), in which case, p(X|Y) = 1 for X-outcome 
of |+), and 0 for |-).
(e) Probability of either qubit A being in |+) or qubit B being in |-):
p(|+) U |-}) = 1, because qubit A is definitively in |+).
(f) Expected values (where X = aXA and Y = aXB):
< x ) = p (|+»(1)+ p (|-))(-1) = 1.
(XY) = p (|++»(1 • 1) + ... = 1.
(X + Y) = p (|+—+))(1 + 1) + ... = 2.
i This example demonstrates that quantum probabilities depend on the basis (or 
observable) of measurement, and that conditional probabilities may be undefined 
for specific outcomes.

(3) 
Calculating Probabilities from Density Operators
In straightforward cases like this example, probabilities can be directly com­
puted. For more complex scenarios, however, we often rely on density operators to 
determine these probabilities. To built intuition, let’s re-calculate some of the above 
probabilities and expected values using density operators.
The density operator of the composite system is given by pAB = |++)(++1. The 
density operator of qubit A is pA = trB(pAB) = |+X+|- Similarly, for pB. Since 
this is a product state, pAB = pA ® pB.
(a) p(|0>, |1)) = (011pAB |01> = 4.
(b) p(|+), |+)) = (+ + |pAB| + +) = 1.
(c) p(|+), |-)) = (+ - |pAB| + — =0.
(d) p(|—B) = HpB|— = 0. Hence, p(|+)A ||—B) = p(|+^,| ?)is undefined. 
p(| /B)
(e) Expected values:
( azA ) = tr( az pA) = 0.
(azAazB) = tr(azAazBpAB) = 0. 
(azAazB = azA ® azB)
(azA + azB} = tr(( azAIB + IAazB) pAB) = 0.
(axA) = tr( ax pA) = 1.
(axAaxB) = tr( axAaxB pAB) = 1.
(axA + axB) = tr(( axAIB + IAaxB) pAB) = 2.
■
Probabilities in Entangled Systems
Unlike the product state in Example 13.5, the entanglement embodied in states leads 
to outcomes that are intertwined in a way that is not possible in classical physics. 
We will use an example to illustrate how entanglement leads to inseparability of the 
joint state and to probabilities that exhibit non-classical correlations.
■ Example 13.6 — Joint and Conditional Probabilities in a Bell State. Consider 
two qubits A and B in the Bell state |$+) = ^12(|00) + |11)). The joint and reduced 
density operators are examined in Example 13.4.
(1) 
Local Measurements in Computational Basis
Local measurements of each qubit in the computational basis are equivalent to 
observing the outcomes of the Pauli-Z operator applied to each qubit. We define 
two random variables X = azA for qubit A and Y = azB for qubit B .
(a) Probability of measuring both qubits in state |0):
p(|0>, |0)) = | <00|$+> |2 = 2.
(b) Joint probability distribution of X and Y :
p(X, Y) = [2,0, 0, 2] for outcomes [|00), |01), |10), |11)].

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
411
Note that p(X,Y) = p(X)p(Y). This demonstrates that the joint state 
of an entangled system is inseparable into individual states, leading to 
probabilities that cannot be factored as in classical independent events.
(c) Conditional probabilities given qubit B is in state |1):
First, p(|1>b) = (1|Pb|1) = 2. Then,
P (0 A ||1> B ) = p (|01» 
p(|1>b) = 0,
p(|1>A ||1>B)= p (|11» 
p(|1>B) = 1.
Without the condition of qubit B in 11), we would have p(|0)A) = p(11)A) = 2.
These conditional probabilities demonstrate correlation. The measurement 
outcome of one qubit affects the probabilities of outcomes for the other 
qubit.
(d) 
Expected values:
(X} = p(|0>)(1) + p(|1))(-1) = 0. Or equivalently, (azA} = tr(azpA) = 0.
(XY) = p(|00»(1 • 1) + p(|01»(1 • (-1)) + p(|10))((-1) • 1) + p(| 11»(1 • 1) = 1. 
Or equivalently, (aZAaZB) = tr(aZAaZBpAB) = 1. Note that, in this case, 
(XY) = (X) [Y), indicating correlation.
(X + Y) = p (|00»(1 + 1)+ p (|01»(1 -1)+ p (|10))(-1 + 1)+ p (|11))(-1 -1)=0.
(2) Joint Measurements in the Bell Basis
The Bell basis, {|$+), |$-), |^+), |^-)}, is an orthonormal basis for two-qubit 
states (see § 8.2). Measuring both qubits jointly in this basis yields a probability 
distribution of 1 for |$+) and 0 for all other basis states. 
■
Exercise 13.5 Consider a two-qubit system composed of 50% in the uniform 
mixed state 11 and 50% in the Bell state 12(|00) + |11)). We perform local 
measurements of each qubit in the computational basis which is equivalent to 
observing the outcomes of the Pauli-Z operator (az) applied to each qubit. We 
define two random variables X = aZA for qubit A and Y = aZB for qubit B. 
Calculate:
(a) The density operator of the system pAB.
(b) The reduced density operators pA and pB.
(c) The joint probability of measuring both qubits in state |0): p(|0), |0)).
(d) The conditional probabilities given qubit B is in state |1): p(|0)A 111)B) and 
p(|1>A ||1>B).
(e) The expectation values (X}, {Y}, {XY}, and (X + Y}.

Key Takeaways
In the quantum realm, multiple random variables are represented by observables, 
whose non-commutative nature influences their measurements. Entanglement in 
composite systems introduces complex dependencies between variables, making 
quantum probabilities differ fundamentally from classical counterparts. The 
concept of marginal probability is extended through reduced density operators, 
enabling focus on specific subsystems. The nature of quantum probability is 
further nuanced by the distinction between product and entangled states, with 
the latter showing non-classical correlations.
13.1.5 Random Processes
A random or stochastic process is essentially a collection of random variables, each 
indexed by time or space, that describe the evolution of systems in a stochastic, or 
probabilistic, manner. This concept is central in understanding systems that evolve 
unpredictably over time or space.
1 
Classical Stochastic Processes
Classical stochastic processes are mathematical models used to describe classical 
systems that evolve over time in a way that is at least partially random. Here are 
some common examples:
• Random Walk: This is a fundamental stochastic process where an object 
moves step by step, with each step being random. In its simplest form, at each 
time step, the object moves either one unit up or one unit down with certain 
probabilities. Random walks are used to model various phenomena, including 
stock market fluctuations and particle movements in liquids.
• Markov Chains: A Markov chain is a stochastic process where the probability 
of moving to the next state depends only on the current state and not on the 
sequence of events that preceded it. Markov chains are used in a variety of 
fields, including economics, game theory, and biology.
Random walk is a special case of Markov chain where each step is taken 
randomly and independently, typically with equal probability, in a specific 
state space like a lattice or a grid.
• Queueing Models: Used extensively in operations research, these models study 
the behavior of queues (or lines). They help in understanding and predicting 
queue lengths and waiting times, important in designing and managing facilities 
like call centers, hospitals, and manufacturing plants.
2 
Quantum Stochastic Processes
Quantum stochastic processes extend these concepts into the quantum domain, 
featuring unique quantum mechanical principles like superposition and entanglement. 
For example:
• Quantum Walk: Analogous to classical random walk but in the quantum 
realm, quantum walk exhibits features such as superposition and entanglement, 
leading to behavior distinct from their classical counterparts.

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
413
• Quantum Markov Processes: Quantum Markov Processes, as the quantum 
counterparts of classical Markov processes, characterize the evolution of quan­
tum states by extending the classical notion of memorylessness to quantum 
systems. In these processes, the progression of a quantum state is depicted 
through a sequence of Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) maps. 
These maps ensure each transition from one state to another is independent of 
prior states or transitions, thereby maintaining the Markov property. Further­
more, CPTP maps can incorporate effects such as measurements, noise, and 
decoherence, important in accurately representing quantum systems.
• Quantum Queueing Models: Emerging in the context of quantum commu­
nication and computing, these models apply quantum mechanical principles 
to queueing theory. Quantum Queueing Models can be used for the efficient 
management of quantum information processes, such as the transmission of 
qubits in quantum networks and the execution of operations in quantum 
computing. They deal with challenges unique to quantum systems, like the 
no-cloning theorem and quantum entanglement, offering new ways to optimize 
quantum resource management and information processing.
3 
Simulation Techniques in Quantum Stochastic Processes
Simulations help us understand quantum stochastic processes by offering tools to 
model and study complex quantum behaviors where analytical solutions are often 
intractable. Among the main methods employed are:
• Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) Simulations: QMC methods use stochastic 
sampling to solve quantum mechanical problems, particularly valuable in 
studying many-body systems. These simulations help calculate properties like 
ground state energies and molecular structures.
In QMC, random samples are used to estimate the properties of a quantum 
system, effectively turning a complex quantum problem into a statistical one. 
Techniques like Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and Diffusion Monte Carlo 
(DMC) employ different strategies for handling the probabilistic aspects of 
quantum mechanics.
• Time-Dependent Schrodinger Equation: This fundamental equation in quan­
tum mechanics describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes 
over time. While QMC employs random sampling, the Schrodinger equation 
models the probabilistic evolution of quantum states over time.
• Quantum Operations Sequence: This approach models quantum stochastic 
processes through a sequence of quantum operations, including measurements 
and unitary transformations.
13.1.6 * Example: One-Dimensional Quantum Walk
In this subsection, we delve into the one-dimensional quantum walk as a repre­
sentative example of quantum probability and quantum stochastic processes. We 
will contrast its characteristics with those of classical random walks, highlighting 
the distinctive features of quantum mechanics that come into play in the quantum 
variant.

13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials 
414
1 Classical 1D Random Walk
The one-dimensional random walk is a simple yet instructive model. It can be 
visualized as a walk along a line, with each step being of the same length. Starting 
at the origin, a fair (unbiased) coin is flipped before each step. A heads (H) results 
in a step forward, while tails (T) leads to a step backward.
The problem of interest is determining the probability of being at a specific point 
n after N steps, given that the starting point is 0. We denote this probability as 
fN (n).
Since the walker must be at some position after N steps, the sum of these 
probabilities for all possible positions n must equal 1, i.e., 
fN (n) = 1.
The pattern in these probabilities becomes clearer when factoring out 21y:

To better understand these probabilities, one can enumerate the sequences of 
coin flips leading to each position. For instance, in a three-step walk (N = 3), the 
sequence HHH will end at n = 3, while HHT, HTH, and THH will end at n = 1. 
The negative positions correspond to the reverse combinations of H and T. With 
23 = 8 possible three-step walks, the probabilities for the different positions are: 
f3 (-3) = 1/8, f3 (-1) = 3/8, f3 (1) = 3/8, f3 (3) = 1/8.
These probabilities correspond to the coefficients in Pascal’s Triangle, and they 
are the same as those in the binomial expansion of (a+b)N . Therefore, the probability 
function is given by:
N
N+n 
2 /
fN (n) = 21N
N
(N+n)! (N-n)
(13.29)
where n is an integer such that — N < n < N and N + n is even.

Quantum Simulation of Classical 1D Random Walk
We can simulate a classical 1D random walk using a quantum circuit, as illustrated 
in Fig. 13.2.
The first qubit represents the state of a fair coin, denoted as |coin). The second 
register of d qubits records the position of the walker, denoted as |pos). This register 
is initialized to 1100... 0), representing position n = 0. The offset ensures that n = 0 
is centered in the set {0, 1}d. We choose a sufficiently large d such that 2d > 2N.
The state of the d + 1 qubits is given by

(13.30)
A quantum random number generator (QRNG, see § 5.4) simulates the coin 
flip. A single-bit QRNG is implemented as a qubit initialized in the state |0) or 
|1), rotated by a Hadamard gate, followed by a measurement in the computational 
basis. After each measurement, the qubit state collapses to |0) or |1), so the QRND 
is ready for use again.
We construct a quantum gate S, acting on the d +1 qubits, such that if |coin) = |0) 
(representing Heads), n is incremented; if |coin) = |1) (representing Tails), n is 
decremented:
S = |0>(0| ® 
|n + 1)(n| + |1><11 ® 
|n - 1)(n| ■ 
(13.31)
Exercise 13.6 Verify that the shift operator S, given in Eq. 13.31, is unitary.
We repeat the QRNG and S operations N times and measure the last d qubits. 
The probability of finding the d-qubit state corresponding to position n yields the 
function fN (n):
fN(n) = | (n|pos) |2■
(13.32)
The results of a simulation with N = 50 and d = 7 are graphed in the lower 
part of Fig. 13.2. The graph mirrors Eq. 13.29, a binomial probability distribution 
centered around n = 0 with a spread of VN.

1D Quantum Walk
Finally, we are ready to explore the 1D quantum walk. Unlike a classical random walk, 
a quantum walk is fundamentally deterministic in its evolution, with probabilistic 
outcomes emerging from quantum measurement. For this reason, we omit “random” 
in its name.

13.1 Quantum Probability Essentials 
416
Consider a quantum particle as the walker, initially at the origin on a number 
line. In each step of a quantum walk, the particle enters a superposition of moving 
one step left and one step right. After multiple steps, the particle does not merely 
occupy a single position; rather, it has a probability amplitude for every position 
it could have reached. These amplitudes from different steps interfere, leading 
to a probability distribution distinct from classical random walks. Notably, some 
off-center positions may exhibit higher probabilities than the center position n = 0 
due to constructive interference.
The quantum circuit for simulating this phenomenon is shown in Fig. 13.3. The 
key difference from the classical walk simulation (Fig. 13.2) is that we no longer 
measure the QRNG after each step. This lack of measurement allows the system 
state to maintain superposition and demonstrate interference effects.

Figure 13.3: Quantum 1D Walk
A simulation with N = 50 and d = 7 produces a result graphed in the lower part 
of Fig. 13.3. Unlike the bell-shaped binomial distribution of the classical walk, the 
quantum walk yields a distinctly shaped distribution, exhibiting higher probabilities 
for positions further from the start point due to quantum interference.
To elucidate this behavior, we demonstrate the evolution of the system state 
under Eq. 13.31 in Table 13.1, started with the coin state |0). Noticeably, by the third 
step, interference shifts the probability distribution, making it asymmetrical. This 
asymmetry arises because the terms — |1, —1) +11, —1) cancel each other, eliminating 
their probability contribution at x = —1. Conversely, the terms |0, 1) +10, 1) combine 
to form 2 |0, 1), contributing a probability of 4.
It is important to note that the initial coin state significantly influences the 
shape of the fN (n) curve. This initial state can be a general state represented as 
a 0 + P |1>.
Exercise 13.7 Construct a table showing the evolution of system states for a 1D 
quantum walk over the first three steps, following the dynamics described by 
Eq. 13.31. Assume the initial state of the coin is 11). Your table should be similar 
to Table 13.1, detailing the coin and walker states, as well as the probability

Applications
Although the one-dimensional quantum walk has been introduced primarily as an 
illustrative example of quantum probability and quantum stochastic processes, the 
generalized concept of quantum walks is a rich and complex topic with significant 
applications in quantum computing and quantum information theory. These appli­
cations exploit the unique properties of quantum walks, including superposition and 
interference. The following are some key areas where quantum walks are applied:
• Quantum Algorithms: Quantum walks are a powerful tool for designing 
quantum algorithms. They can explore computational spaces more efficiently 
than their classical counterparts due to quantum superposition and interference. 
Algorithms based on quantum walks have been shown to offer speedups for 
certain problems. For example, the quantum walk-based search algorithm can 
search an unsorted database quadratically faster than any possible classical 
algorithm.
• Quantum Simulation: Quantum walks can simulate various quantum systems, 
particularly in studying transport phenomena in quantum systems. They are 
instrumental in simulating the behavior of electrons in materials, which helps 
in understanding and designing new quantum materials and devices.
• Quantum Computing Models: The concept of quantum walks underpins certain 
models of quantum computation, like the Continuous-Time Quantum Walk 
(CTQW) model. These models provide alternative frameworks to the standard 
gate-based quantum computing model and are more natural for certain types 
of problems and physical implementations.
• Quantum Communications: In the realm of quantum communication, quantum 
walks are used to model and analyze quantum networks, potentially leading 
to more efficient protocols for quantum information transfer. Quantum walks 
also have applications in developing new cryptographic protocols.
13.2 Quantum Entropy and Information
The concept of entropy, a cornerstone in information theory, measures the uncertainty

or information content associated with a random variable. In the quantum regime, 
this notion extends to encapsulate the uncertainty in quantum states.
In information theory, “information” is defined in a way that is quite different 
from its everyday usage. It’s not about the message, meaning, or knowledge, 
but rather about the uncertainty or unpredictability of a message source. For 
instance, if a message is very predictable, it contains less information than a 
highly unpredictable one. This is quantified using the concept of entropy, usually 
represented in bits. The higher the entropy, the more information a message 
carries.
13.2.1 Classical Shannon Entropy
Consider a classical random variable X with a sample space Q. Each outcome x in 
Q occurs according to a probability distribution p(X). The information content (or 
self-information, to distinguish with joint information) I (x) of a particular outcome 
x is defined as:
I(x) = - log p(x).
(13.33)
The logarithmic base determines the unit of information; for base 2, the unit is bits.
The log function in the definition ensures that information is additive. Con­
sider two independent events x and y with probabilities p(x) and p(y), respec­
tively. The joint probability of both events occurring is the product p(x)p(y). 
This relationship leads to the total information content for both events being 
I(x, y) = - log(p(x)p(y)) = I(x) + I(y).
The Shannon entropy is defined as the expected value (statistical average) of the 
information content of a random variable over all possible outcomes:
H(X) = E[I(x)] = - 
p(x) log p(x). 
(13.34)
Thus, in information theory, “information” is quantified as the reduction in 
uncertainty about a random variable and is measured by the change in entropy, 
when a message is received.
6 log 77 = log 6 ~ 2 ■ 58
■ Example 13.7 — Roll of a Six-sided Fair Die. Consider the roll of a six-sided 
fair die, with Q = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and a uniform probability distribution for each 
A
outcome. The Shannon entropy in this case is H(X) = -
x=1
bits. This value represents the average uncertainty or information content associated 
with the outcome of a roll. In information theory, it indicates that, on average, 
about 2.58 bits is needed to optimally encode the outcome of a die roll in a large 
series of rolls. 
■
In the context of information theory and probability simulation, we often use the 
phrase “draw from probability distribution p ”. For example, consider a simple 
probability distribution p over Q = {a, b}, where p(a) = 0■ 6, p(b) = 0■ 4. A “draw 
from p” means randomly selecting either a or b, with a 60% chance of selecting a

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
419
| and a 40% chance for b in any single draw.
■ Example 13.8 — Simulating a Draw from a Distribution. Suppose we have a 
probability distribution p over a finite set of outcomes. In a computational simulation, 
H (p) represents the least number of truly random bits (coin flips) needed on average 
to generate a draw from p. This is especially accurate when simulating a large 
number of draws, as the average number of bits used converges to H (p).
For instance, consider p = (1, 1, 1) for the sample space {a, b, c}. To generate a 
draw from p using minimum number of coin flips, if we get Heads (with a probability 
of 2), we select a, done; if we get Tails, we flip a second coin, and select b or c 
according to Heads or Tails (each with overall probability of 4). Thus, on average, 
it takes 1 • 2 +2 • 4 = 1.5 coin flips to generate a draw. This is consistent with the 
Shannon entropy calculation, H(p) = 1.5 bits. 
■
■ Example 13.9 — Storing a Draw with Optimal Compression. For a probability 
distribution p, the average number of bits required to store a draw from p, using 
the best possible compression scheme, is also given by H (p). This stems from the 
fact that Shannon entropy defines the limit of lossless compression. For each draw 
from p, one can store the sequence of random bits used to generate that particular 
outcome. Over many such draws, the average length of these stored bit sequences 
will approximate H (p).
As an example, consider again p = (2, 4, 4) for the sample space {a, b, c}. To 
encode a string drawn from this distribution, we use the shortest code 0 for the most 
frequent letter a, and then 10 for b, 11 for c. On average, we need 1.5 bits per letter. 
This is consistent with the Shannon entropy calculation, H(p) = 1.5 bits. ■
Exercise 13.8 Calculate the entropy in bits for each of the following random 
variables, representing pixel values in an image:
(a) Assume we have an image where each pixel’s color is represented by a unique 
combination of Red, Green, and Blue channels, each of which can take any 
integer value from 0 to 255 with uniform probability. Calculate the entropy 
of a single pixel.
(b) Now we remove the red color in the image, i.e., the Red channel is always 
zero, and only the Green and Blue channels vary from 0 to 255 with uniform 
probability. Calculate the entropy of a single pixel under this condition.
(c) Finally, assume the color space of the image is limited: the Red channel 
varies from 0 to 63, the Green channel from 0 to 127, and the Blue channel 
from 64 to 255, all with uniform probability. Calculate the entropy of a 
single pixel for this scenario.
Note: Assume each color channel is independent of the others.
Basic Properties
Shannon entroy has a number of important properties:
1. 
0 < H(p) < log(d), where d is the dimension of the sample space.

13.2 Quantum Entropy and Information
420
2. H (p) = 0 if p = 1 for some event and 0 for the rest, representing a deterministic 
process.
3. H(p) = log(d) if p is uniform, (d,..., d), representing maximum randomness.
13.2.2 * Quantum von Neumann Entropy
In quantum probability theory, observables are a non-commutative generalization of 
random variables, with their set of eigenvalues playing the role of the set of possible 
outcomes. A given density operator p generalizes the role of a probability distribution 
by completely encapsulating the probabilistic state of a quantum system, allowing 
us to compute statistical quantities such as the expected value of an observable A:
(A} = tr(pA) = {p,A}. 
(13.35)
To compute the von Neumann entropy, which serves as a measure of uncertainty in 
quantum systems, analogous to Shannon entropy in classical probability, we consider 
A = - logp as an observable. The von Neumann entropy S(p) of a quantum system 
described by a density operator p is defined as:
S(P) = - (logP} = — tr(Plog P)■ 
(13.36)
This expression can be simplified using the spectral decomposition of p. In the 
eigenbasis of P, where P is diagonal, the entropy takes the form:
S(P) = — E Xi log Xi, 
(13.37)
where each eigenvalue Xi represents the probability of the quantum system being in 
the corresponding eigenstate. This result is invariant under basis changes, thanks to 
the basis-independence of the trace operation.
The von Neumann entropy quantifies the amount of information present in a 
quantum system. It has a number of properties similar to those of Shannon entroy:
1. 0 < S (P) < log(d), where d is the dimension of p.
2. S(P) = 0 if some term in {Xi} is 1 and the rest 0, representing a pure state.
3. S(P) = log(d) if {Xi} is uniform, representing a maximumly mixed state.
■ Example 13.10 — Pure States. For the pure state |^) = a |0) + 0 |1), the density 
operator is:
_ | a |2 afl *
P = pa* |$|2_ ■
The eigenvalues of P are 0 and 1. Therefore, the von Neumann entropy for P is:
S(P) = 0log0+ 1log1 = 0. 
(13.38)
Here we take 0 log0 = 0 in the limiting sense: lim x logx = 0.
x ^0+
In fact, the entropy for any pure state of any dimension, including Bell states, is 
0, reflecting the absence of uncertainty or information entropy in a pure state. This

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
421
is because p — |^^| of a pure state |^) is a rank-1 matrix, i.e., with only 1 linearly 
independent column vector or row vector. For such a matrix, one of the eigenvalues 
is always 1 (due to the normalization of quantum states), and all others are 0. 
■
■ Example 13.11 — The Uniform Mixed State. For a d-dimensional qudit, the 
density operator for the uniform mixed state is:
p — d IdXd-
This density operator is already diagonal. Its von Neumann entropy is:
S (p) = —£ 11 log d = log d- 
dd

(13.39)
■
Exercise 13.9 A machine randomly produces qubits in a mixed state, where the 
state is |0) with probability p and |1) with probability 1 — p for 0 < p < 1. Define 
the density matrix p of this mixed state. Compute the von Neumann entropy 
S(p) of the qubits. Determine the value of p that maximizes S(p), and find the 
maximum value of S (p).
13.2.3 * Classical Joint Entropy and Mutual Information
Building on our understanding of Shannon entropy, this subsection delves into 
information measures involving multiple random variables. We introduce and 
examine the concept of mutual information, which plays a key role in understanding 
the interdependencies and shared information between random variables. We will 
focus on the case of two random variables, with the principles being extendable to 
more complex scenarios involving additional variables. These measures not only 
broaden our perspective on information theory but also lay the groundwork for their 
quantum counterparts.
1 
Joint Entropy
In classical information theory, given two random variables X and Y , the joint 
entropy, H(X, Y ), is defined in terms of the Shannon entropy of the joint probability 
distribution p(x, y) (see § 13.1.4):
H(X,Y) — — X Y p(x, y) logp(x, y), 
(13.40)
which quantifies the total uncertainty in the joint system of X and Y , encompassing 
all combinations of random events x and y.
Since p(x, y) — p(y, x), it follows that H(X, Y ) is symmetric, i.e., H(X, Y ) — 
H(Y, X).
If X and Y are independent, then p(x, y) — p(x)p(y), resulting in:
H(X,Y) —H(X)+H(Y).
(13.41)

13.2 Quantum Entropy and Information 
422
2 
Conditional Entropy
The conditional entropy of Y given X is defined in terms of the conditional probability 
distribution p(y|x). For a specific outcome X = x, the conditional entropy is 
determined using the Shannon formula:
H(Y |x) = - Y p(y|x) logp(y|x). 
(13.42)
The full conditional entropy of Y given X is defined as the expected value of 
H(Y |x) over all possible outcomes of X:
H (Y | X )= £ p (x) H (Y | x)
(13.43a)
= - 
p(x)p(y|x) log p(y|x)
(13.43b)
= - 
p(y, x) log p(y|x),
(13.43c)
which represents the average uncertainty in Y given knowledge of X , averaged over 
all possible outcomes of X .
Similarly, the conditional entropy of X given Y is:
H(X|Y) = - Y X p(x, y) log p(x|y). 
(13.44)
3 
Relationships
Figure 13.4: Venn Diagram for Shannon Entropy Relationships
Due to the chain rule in probability (Eq. 13.19):
p(x, y) = p(y, x) = p(x|y)p(y) = p(y|x)p(x), 
(13.45)
joint and conditional entropies satisfy the identity:
H(X,Y) = H(Y, X) = H(Y |X) + H(X) = H(X|Y) +H(Y). 
(13.46)
Or, equivalently:

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
423
H(Y |X) = H(Y,X) - H(X), 
(13.47a)
H(X|Y) = H(X,Y) -H(Y). 
(13.47b)
These identities illustrate that the conditional entropy measures the additional 
uncertainty about one variable when the other is known. These relationships can be 
illustrated using a Venn diagram as in Fig. 13.4.
In Fig. 13.4, the exclusive region of H(X) relative to H(Y) is represented by 
H(X) - I(X; Y), equal to H(X|Y).
Conversely, in Fig. 13.1, the exclusive part of p(x) relative to p(y) is shown as
p(x) — p(x, y), which differs from p(x | y).
Readers are encouraged to explore the reasons behind this distinction.
4 
Mutual Information
Mutual information is defined as a measure of the amount of information that one 
random variable contains about another. Mathematically, it is given by:
I(X; Y) =H(X)+H(Y) -H(X,Y). 
(13.48)
In this notation, the semicolon (instead of a comma) is used to emphasize that 
mutual information is a measure of the dependence between the two variables, rather 
than a joint distribution of them.
The mutual information I(X; Y) quantifies the shared information between two 
random variables, X and Y . It represents the reduction in uncertainty about one 
variable given knowledge of the other. Specifically, if X and Y are independent, 
I(X; Y) = 0, indicating that knowledge of X provides no information about Y, and 
vice versa. It has been established that I(X; Y) > 0 for all cases, which implies that 
gaining knowledge about one variable cannot decrease our information about another; 
such knowledge can only maintain or increase the amount of shared information.
In the Venn diagram in Fig. 13.4, I(X; Y) is the intersection between the two 
circles representing H(X) and H(Y), while H(X, Y) is their union. Notably, both 
I(X; Y) and H(X, Y) are symmetric: I(X; Y) = I(Y; X) and H(X, Y) = H(Y, X).
Exercise 13.10 Verify the following equivalent expressions for mutual information:
I (X; Y) = H (X) + H (Y) — H (X, Y)
(13.49a)
= H (X) — H (X | Y)
(13.49b)
= H (Y) — H (Y | X)
(13.49c)
= Vn(x uHog p(x^y) 
^y: p(x,y)log p(x)p(y) -
(13.49d)
Mutual information also exhibits additivity for independent variables under 
certain conditions. For instance, if the joint distribution of two pairs of random 
variables (X, Y) and (W, Z) can be factorized as p(X, Y, W, Z) = p(X, Y)p(W, Z), 
indicating that (X, Y) is independent of (W, Z), then the mutual information between 
these two sets of variables is additive: I(X, W ; Y, Z) = I(X; Y) + I(W; Z).

13.2 Quantum Entropy and Information 
424
■ Example 13.12 — Perfectly Correlated Systems. Suppose that X is a random 
variable whose entropy H(X) is 8 bits, and that Y (X) is a deterministic function 
that takes on a different value for each value of X .
(a) The entropy of Y , H(Y ), is also 8 bits because Y is a one-to-one function of 
X.
(b) The conditional entropy of Y given X, H(Y |X) = 0, since X uniquely deter­
mines Y .
(c) The conditional entropy of X given Y , H(X|Y ) = 0, because Y uniquely 
determines X due to the function being one-to-one.
(d) The joint entropy H(X, Y ) is H(X) + H(Y |X) = 8 bits, which is just the 
entropy of X since Y provides no additional uncertainty.
(e) The mutual information I(X; Y ) = H(X) + H(Y ) - H(X, Y ) = 8, consistent 
with the fact that knowing X provides full information about Y and vice versa.
(f) Thus, for two perfectly correlated systems, 
I(X;Y) =H(X,Y) = H(X) =H(Y), and 
H(X|Y) = H(Y |X) =0.
■
■ Example 13.13 — Partially Correlated Systems. Similar to Example 13.12, X 
is a random variable whose entropy H(X) is 8 bits. Now, Y (X) is a deterministic 
function but is no longer invertible; that is, different values of X may correspond to 
the same value of Y (X).
(a) Since now different values of X may correspond to the same value of Y (X), 
the new distribution of Y has lost entropy because it has less variability and 
therefore H(Y ) < 8 bits.
(b) The conditional entropy of Y given X, is still H(Y |X) = 0 bits, since X still 
uniquely determines Y .
(c) Now, knowledge of Y no longer uniquely determines X , and so the conditional 
entropy H(X|Y ) is no longer zero because there is some uncertainty about X 
even after knowing Y : H(X|Y ) > 0.
(d) The joint entropy H(X, Y ) is still H(X) + H(Y |X) = 8 bits, which is just 
the entropy of X since Y provides no additional uncertainty. Even though 
H(X|Y) > 0 and H(Y) < 8, we still have H(Y)+H(X|Y) =8.
(e) The mutual information I(X; Y) = H(X)+H(Y)-H(X,Y) =H(Y) < H(X), 
measuring the amount of information shared between X and Y which is now 
smaller than 8 bits.
(f) Thus, for two partially correlated systems, 
H (X) ,H (Y) < H (X,Y) < H (X) + H (Y), 
0 < H(X|Y) < H(X), 0 < H(Y|X) < H(Y), and 
0<I(X;Y) < H(X), H(Y).
■
■ Example 13.14 — Independent Systems. Similar to Example 13.12, X is 
a random variable whose entropy H(X) is 8 bits. But now Y(X) is completely 

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information 
425
random, i.e., given a value of X = x, Y takes on a random value y from a probability 
distribution with the same entropy as X .
(a) We are given H(Y ) = H(X) = 8 bits, even though Y and X are now indepen­
dent.
(b) The conditional entropy of Y given X, is H(Y |X) = 8 bits, since X does not 
influence Y .
(c) Similarly, the conditional entropy of X given Y , is H(X|Y ) = 8 bits as well.
(d) The joint entropy H(X,Y) is H(X) + H(Y |X) = H(Y)+H(X|Y) = 16 bits.
(e) The mutual information I(X; Y ) = H(X) + H(Y ) - H(X, Y ) = 0, signifying 
that no information is shared between X and Y .
(f) Thus, for two independent systems,
H(X,Y)=H(X)+H(Y),
H(X|Y) = H(X), H(Y |X) =H(Y), and
I(X;Y)=0.

ples 13.12 to 13.14.
13.2.4 * Quantum Joint Entropy and Mutual Information
Having established a solid foundation in both the von Neumann entropy and classical 
information measures, we now turn our attention to quantum information measures 
involving two random variables. This generalization provides a deeper insight into 
how quantum mechanics redefines informational relationships and interdependencies.
Given a bipartite quantum system AB described by a density operator pAB 
which encodes the probabilities of the system, the pair of random variables X and 
Y are replaced by pAB. The two subsystems are described by the reduced density 
operators pA = trB(pAB) and pB = trA(pAB). (See § 12.2.8 for details.)
1 
Joint and Conditional Entropies
The standard definitions of joint and conditional von Neumann entropies adopt the 
form of the classical relations, with S(pAB) in place of the classical joint entropy, 
S(pA) substituted for H(X), and S(pB) substituted for H(Y). Thus,
S(A,B) = S(pAB) = - tr(pAB log pAB), 
S(A) = S(pa) = - tr(pa log pa), 
S(B) = S(pB) = - tr(pB log pB).
(13.50a)
(13.50b)
(13.50c)
Since conditional density operators are rarely used, the conditional von Neumann 
entropies are defined directly according to the classical entropy relationship Eq. 13.47:
S(A|B) = S(pAB) - S(pB), 
S(B|A) = S(pAB) - S(pA).
(13.51a)
(13.51b)

13.2 Quantum Entropy and Information
426
2 
Mutual Information
Mutual information is defined similarly to the classical case, but with quantum 
entropies. For two quantum systems A and B, the mutual information I(A; B) is 
given by:
I(A; B) = S(pa) + S(pb) - S(pab). 
(13.52)
The terms S (pA) and S (pB) represent the individual uncertainties of systems A 
and B, respectively, while S(pAB ) represents the uncertainty of the joint system. The 
mutual information I(A; B) quantifies how much the knowledge of one system (say A) 
reduces the uncertainty about the other system (B), thus signifying the total amount 
of correlation between two quantum systems, reflecting the interconnectedness of 
their quantum states.
Notably, since pA and pB are derived from pAB through partial trace, the joint 
and conditional entropies, as well as the mutual information, are all encoded in pAB .
3 
Relationships
The relationships among quantum entropies and information can be depicted using 
a Venn diagram, as shown in Fig. 13.5. However, it’s important to note that such 
diagrams cannot capture the phenomenon of negative quantum conditional entropy, 
which occurs in entangled states.
Note: Quantum conditional entropy can be negative in the case of entangled 
states, which is not captured by the diagram. Refer to the text for details.
Figure 13.5: Venn Diagram for von Neumann Entropy Relationships
In the case where the systems A and B are independent, pAB = pA ® pB, 
S(pAB) = S(pA) + S(pB), and I(A;B) = 0.
4 
Negative Conditional Entropy
A surprising aspect of quantum conditional entropy is that it can be negative for 
entangled states, a phenomenon that has no counterpart in classical information 
theory. This is exemplified in Example 13.15.
In classical systems, conditional entropy quantifies the reduction in uncertainty 
about one part of the system when another part is known, and it is always non­
negative. This reflects that knowledge about a system can only decrease or leave 
unchanged the uncertainty associated with its parts. Conversely, quantum systems 

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
427
exhibit a unique property where conditional entropy can become negative. This 
occurs due to quantum entanglement, indicating that the interconnections between 
subsystems are so profound that knowing the state of the whole system actually 
implies a greater certainty (less uncertainty) than the sum of what is known about 
the individual parts. Such negative conditional entropy is exclusive to quantum 
mechanics, underscoring the fundamentally non-classical behavior introduced by 
entanglement.
However, even though quantum conditional entropy can be negative, quantum 
mutual information is still always non-negative: I(A; B) > 0. (A proof of this 
inequality is beyond the scope of this text.)
■ Example 13.15 — Conditional Entropy of an EPR Pair. Consider the archetypal 
case where Alice and Bob share an EPR pair, |$+) = 1=(|00) + |11)). Its joint 
density operator is pAB = |$+)($+|.
As derived in Example 13.4, the reduced density operator for both Alice and Bob 
is pA = pB = trB (pAB) = trA(pAB) = I/2, representing maximally mixed states.
Consequently, the entropies are S(pAB) = 0 for the pure joint state, and S(pA) = 
S(pB) = 1 for the maximally mixed reduced states. This leads to a surprising result 
in the conditional entropies:
S(A|B) = S(pAB) - S(pB) = -1,
S(B|A) = S(pAB) - S(pA) = -1.
The negative values of S(A|B) and S(B|A) signify the presence of entanglement 
and the departure from classical probabilistic correlations.
The mutual information is
I(A; B) = S(pA) + S(pB) - S(pAB) = 2,
signifying that the total amount of entanglement-based correlation is equivalent to 2 
bits of information.
This is in contrast to classical systems, where the mutual information between 
two perfectly correlated random variables X and Y would be I(X; Y ) = H(X) = 
H(Y ). The factor of 2 in I(A; B) = 2S(pA) for Bell states indicates that quantum 
correlations from entanglement can be stronger than any classical correlation.
In general, if pAB represents a pure state with S(pAB) = 0, then it holds that 
S(pA) = S(pB). For a product state, where pAB is separable into pA and pB , 
both are pure states and hence S(pA) = S(pB) = 0. Conversely, for a maximally 
entangled state like a Bell state, S(pA) = S(pB) attains its maximum value of 1. 
Thus, S(pA) = S(pB) is often referred to as the entanglement entropy for a pure 
state, quantifying the degree of entanglement.

pair |$+) = -12(|00) + |11)) with 50% probability, and another entangled state

Key Takeaways
In quantum information theory, von Neumann entropy fulfills the roles of the 
classical Shannon entropy. Joint entropy in bipartite quantum systems, derived 
from the joint density operator pAB, quantifies the total uncertainty associated 
with the combined state of the two systems. Mutual information, derived from 
the joint and reduced density operators of these systems, measures the amount 
of information shared between them, reflecting the degree of their quantum 
correlations. Notably, quantum conditional entropy can be negative in entangled 
systems, which underscores the non-classical nature of quantum entanglement, a 
distinctive feature absent in classical information theory.
13.3 * Core Theorems in Quantum Information
In the preceding chapters, we have explored two theorems fundamental to the 
field of quantum computation and information theory. The no-cloning theorem, 
as outlined in § 5.1.3, asserts that it is impossible to create an identical copy of 
an arbitrary unknown quantum state. This theorem highlights a fundamental 
restriction on quantum information imposed by quantum mechanics. In addition, 
the no-communication theorem (§ 9.7) establishes that superluminal communication, 
or faster-than-light transmission of information, is not feasible, despite the presence 
of non-local correlations inherent in quantum entanglement.
This section ventures into more advanced territories of quantum communications. 
We will explore two significant theorems that further shape our understanding of 
quantum information—the quantum data processing inequality and the Holevo 
theorem—as well as the property of strong subadditivity of von Neumann entropy. 
Our focus will be on elucidating the background and implications of these theorems 
and principles, offering insights into their roles in the broader landscape of quantum 
information science. While the mathematical underpinnings of these concepts 
are profound, we aim to emphasize their conceptual significance and practical 
implications, thereby making these advanced topics accessible to a broader audience.

This topic is detailed in § 12.2.7. Below is a brief summary of the relevant concepts.
A Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) map is an operation that 
transforms one density operator into another while preserving trace and positivity. 
It includes both unitary and non-unitary transformations, is applicable to closed 
and open quantum systems, and allows for changes in dimensionality.
CPTP maps are often modeled using quantum channels, also known as Kraus 
decompositions. A quantum channel can be expressed as:
E (p )= 
Kj pKj, 
(13.53)

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
429
where Kj are the Kraus operators that describe the quantum channel. These 
operators embody the transformations the system undergoes, and the sum of their 
effects ensures the preservation of the trace and positivity of the density operator. 
The specific dynamics of the channel determine the form and number of the Kraus 
operators.
13.3.1 * The Data Processing Inequality
The Data Processing Inequality (DPI) is a fundamental concept in information 
theory, both classical and quantum. It dictates how information is transformed and 
preserved within systems undergoing various processes. This subsection explores 
the DPI, focusing first on its quantum formulation.
1 
The Quantum Data Processing Inequality
The von Neumann entropy is invariant under any unitary transformation U :
S (UpU t) = S (p).
(13.54)
This invariance signifies that entropy remains constant through reversible information 
processing in closed quantum systems.
For more general transformations, quantum systems undergo completely posi­
tive, trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, also known as quantum channels in quantum 
information theory. A CPTP map E transforms a density operator p into another 
density operator E (p), preserving the positivity and total probability. (See § 12.2.7 
for more details.)
The von Neumann entropy does not decrease under CPTP maps [66]:
S(E(p)) > S(p).
(13.55)
This relationship (which encompasses Eq. 13.54) is known as the quantum 
Data Processing Inequality (DPI). The proof of this inequality is mathematically 
sophisticated, involving advanced concepts in quantum theory, and falls outside the 
purview of this discussion. For a detailed exploration, readers are encouraged to 
consult the references provided at the end of this chapter.
■ Example 13.16 — Measuring a Bell State. Suppose we have a Bell state 
|$+) = -12(|00) + |11)) with zero entropy. Upon measuring one qubit in the 
computational basis, the state collapses to a mixed state, either |00) or |11) with 
equal probability, resulting in an entropy of 1. 
■
■ Example 13.17 — Bit-Flip Noise. Consider a qubit state |^) = |0), which intially 
has zero entropy:
p = |0><0|, S(p) = 0.
(13.56)
A bit-flip noise channel E acts on each qubit with probability p, flipping |0) to 
11) and vice versa:
E ( p ) = (1 — P) p + P°x p^x ,
(13.57)

13.3 * Core Theorems in Quantum Information

where aX is the Pauli-X (bit-flip) operator. The resulting state E (p) is a mixed 
state with increased entropy:
E(p) = (1 - p) |0><0| + p |1><1|, 
(13.58a)
S(E(p)) = -[(1 - p) log(1 - p) + p log(p)]. 
(13.58b)
S (E (p)) has a maximum value of 1 at p = 0.5.

Key Takeaways
The quantum DPI indicates that the entropy of a quantum system cannot decrease 
under the application of CPTP operations. These operations encompass quantum 
noise, decoherence, and other non-unitary processes commonly encountered in 
open quantum systems, as well as unitary operations in closed quantum systems.
2 
Implications
The quantum DPI is fundamental in understanding the behavior of quantum systems, 
especially in the context of quantum information theory and quantum thermody­
namics.
The increase in von Neumann entropy under CPTP maps reflects several funda­
mental aspects of quantum systems. This includes their tendency to lose coherence 
and approach an equilibrium characterized by maximally mixed states, indicative of 
maximal entropy and reduced quantum information. Additionally, it highlights the 
irreversibility of certain quantum processes, the inherent uncertainties in quantum 
states, and the dynamics of quantum entanglement, particularly in multipartite 
systems where increased local entropy can signal entanglement. From an information- 
theoretic perspective, this entropy increase also represents a degradation in the 
system capacity to retain and process quantum information.
Quantum thermodynamics is an interdisciplinary field that merges the princi­
ples of quantum mechanics with those of thermodynamics. It extends traditional 
thermodynamics to the quantum realm, exploring how quantum properties like super­
position and entanglement influence and are influenced by thermodynamic processes. 
Key areas of interest include understanding the thermodynamics of small systems at 
quantum scales, energy exchanges in quantum systems, the thermodynamic cost of 
quantum information processes, and the second law of thermodynamics in quantum 
systems. This field provides important insights for developing quantum technologies 
like quantum computers, quantum batteries, and quantum heat engines.
In this context, quantum DPI is often compared to the second law of thermody­
namics because both describe a non-decreasing property of the system entropy. In 
classical thermodynamics, the second law states that the total entropy of a closed 
system does not decrease over time, reflecting the natural tendency towards disorder 
or equilibrium in isolated systems. However, while the second law is a statement 
about closed classical systems, the quantum DPI often applies to open quantum 
systems undergoing CPTP operations.
3 
Classical DPI Versus Quantum DPI
In classical information theory, the behavior of entropy under different types of 
transformations diverges from quantum systems (refer to Examples 13.12 to 13.14):

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
431
1. When using deterministic and invertible functions g, the entropy H (X) remains 
unchanged, i.e., H (g(X)) = H(X). In this scenario, each outcome of X 
uniquely corresponds to an outcome of g(X) and vice versa, preserving the 
level of uncertainty in the system.
2. With deterministic but non-invertible functions g , entropy may decrease
(H(g(X)) < H(X)). This reduction occurs because non-invertible functions 
can map multiple outcomes of X into a single outcome of g(X), thereby 
diminishing the uncertainty and, consequently, the entropy.
3. In the case of stochastic functions g, we observe an increase in entropy
(H(g(X)) > H(X)) due to the additional randomness introduced by g, which 
heightens the system’s uncertainty.
Thus, the classical counterpart of the quantum DPI, namely H (g(X)) > H(X), 
is not universally applicable. Deterministic but non-invertible functions in classical 
systems can actually decrease the entropy through many-to-one mappings. In 
contrast, general quantum transformations are described by CPTP maps, which 
inherently ensure that the von Neumann entropy does not decrease.
13.3.2 * The Holevo Bound and Channel Capacity
This subsection explores a foundational theorem (the HSW theorem) that defines 
the capabilities of quantum channels in information transmission. It focuses on 
Holevo’s theorem and its implications for channel capacity, providing key insights 
into the potential and limitations of quantum communication networks.
1 
Background
Imagine Alice wishes to send information, encoded in a classical random variable X , 
to Bob. Using n classical bits, she can transmit a maximum of n bits of information. 
But what happens if she employs qubits instead? Unlike a classical bit, which 
represents two discrete states, a pure qubit state can represent any point on the 
Bloch sphere. For instance, Alice could encode a random n-bit string s e {0, 1}n 
into a single qubit state as:
nx 
nx
|^>x = cos N1°^+ sin N I1),
(13.59)
where x is the decimal representation of the bit string and N = 2n .
When Alice sends a qubit to Bob, either directly or through quantum teleporta­
tion, it is natural to question whether Bob can fully recover x (or the n-bit string 
s). Unfortunately, the answer is negative. To derive classical information from 
the qubit, Bob must perform a measurement. Upon measuring the qubit, Bob will 
find it in state |0) with probability p0 = cos2 (Nx} and in state |1) with probability 
1 — p0. To accurately determine Nx, and thus the information encoded by Alice, 
Bob would need to measure a large number of identically prepared qubits. However, 
the quantum no-cloning theorem prohibits creating exact copies of an unknown 
quantum state, which precludes Bob from generating the necessary multiple qubits 
for precise measurement. Alice could send Bob multiple copies, but the very act 
would significantly reduce the information transmission efficiency. Consequently, 
Alice’s capacity to encode a wealth of information into a single qubit state does not 
translate into Bob’s ability to retrieve it, primarily due to the probabilistic nature 
of quantum measurements and the constraints of quantum cloning.

13.3 * Core Theorems in Quantum Information
432
The Holevo Bound addresses this issue by quantifying the maximum efficiency of 
information transmission using qubits. Surprisingly, the Holevo Bound dictates that 
an n-qubit stream can convey at most n bits of classical information. This bound 
confirms that irrespective of the quantum information encoded (as represented by 
the states of the qubits), an observer is limited to extracting at most n bits of 
classical information from the measurement of these n qubits.
The optimal efficiency of classical information transmission using a qubit is 
achieved only when the information is encoded using a set of orthogonal states. 
Given that a qubit has only two orthogonal states, it can transmit at most one bit of 
classical information per measurement. However, when encoding information with 
non-orthogonal states, or in scenarios involving quantum correlations, the amount 
of accessible classical information per qubit may be less than 1 bit.
Thus, the Holevo Bound demonstrates that despite a qubit’s ability to exist in a 
continuum of states due to superposition, it cannot convey more than 1 bit of classical 
information to an observer performing any permissible quantum measurement.
In superdense coding (see § 10.2), it is shown that a qubit can transmit two bits 
of information, achievable through the pre-sharing of an entangled pair. Nevertheless, 
this still equates to two bits of classical information being transmitted using two 
qubits.
This result, known as the Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem, 
sets an upper limit on the amount of classical information transmissible via a 
quantum system.
2 
The HSW Theorem
The Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem is anchored in the scenario 
of a quantum communication channel, wherein a sender (Alice) aims to transmit 
classical information to a receiver (Bob) via quantum states. In this setup, X 
denotes the classical information Alice seeks to convey, encoded within quantum 
states {px}, while Y encapsulates the classical information Bob decodes from his 
measurements of these states. The mutual information, I(X; Y), quantifies the 
reduction in uncertainty about X (Alice’s message) afforded by knowledge of Y 
(Bob’s measurement outcomes), representing the accessible information.
Preceding the HSW theorem, the Holevo Bound addresses a related yet simpler 
query: given a collection of quantum states {px }, each with a probability p(x), 
what is the maximal quantity of classical information that can be obtained from 
measurements? The Holevo Bound posits that the accessible information, I(X; Y), 
is constrained by:
I(X; Y) < p(x)p^ - p(x)S(px), 
(13.60)
where S(p) signifies the von Neumann entropy of the state p. This limitation is met 
when the quantum states {px} are mutually orthogonal, such as {|0)(0|, |1)(11}.
The HSW theorem extends the Holevo Bound to establish the limits of information 
transmission through quantum channels. As depicted in Fig. 13.6, the HSW theorem 
builds on this by considering:

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
433

Figure 13.6: Schematic of the Quantum Information Transmission Process
• Alice encoding classical information from a random variable X with a proba­
bility distribution p(x) into a set of quantum states {px}.
• These quantum states are transmitted to Bob via a quantum channel described 
by a Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) map E.
• Bob performs measurements to decode the information, which results in a new 
random variable Y containing the classical information he extracts.
The HSW theorem posits that the mutual information I(X; Y ) is bounded by 
the Holevo channel capacity x, formulated as:
x = miiiax, | S(£p(x)E(px)) ~ ^2p(x)S(E(px))), 
(13.61)
{p(x) ,Px} y ■x 
“x
where the maximization runs over all ensembles of states {px} and their probability 
distribution p(x).
This theorem sets an upper bound on the classical capacity of a quantum 
channel, illustrating that quantum mechanics, despite allowing for elaborate state 
representations, limits the classical information extractable from a quantum system. 
It also emphasizes the role of quantum entropy in determining the capacity of 
quantum channels.
The HSW theorem is a cornerstone in the field of quantum information theory. Its 
implications are significant, particularly in quantum cryptography and the creation 
of efficient quantum communication protocols.
Implications of Holevo’s Bound on Quantum Computing
A system of n qubits can encode quantum information in a composite quantum 
state represented by 2n complex numbers. This expansive encoding capacity 
underlies the remarkable parallel computational power of quantum computing. 
However, transitioning from quantum computations to retrievable classical results 
necessitates measurements, introducing inherent constraints. Holevo’s bound 
limits the amount of information that can be extracted to n classical bits.
Quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch-Jozsa or Shor’s, ingeniously exploit 
quantum interference to efficiently condense the outcome of quantum com­
putations into these n bits. This condensation process ensures that critical 
information from the quantum computation is compacted into a form suitable for 
output measurements. These algorithms showcase the delicate balance between 
maximizing quantum processing capabilities and navigating the fundamental 
constraints of information extraction during the quantum-to-classical transition.
The derivation of the HSW theorem is complex, rooted in the depths of quantum 
information theory, and extends beyond the introductory nature of this text. Those

seeking a comprehensive understanding are advised to refer to the literature listed 
at the end of this chapter.
3 Revisiting the Holevo Bound
Having explored the theoretical underpinnings of the HSW theorem, let’s revisit our 
initial discussion about the Holevo Bound. To understand why a quantum channel 
cannot transmit more than 1 bit of classical information, we analyze the Holevo 
channel capacity, as expressed in Eq. 13.61. The first term represents the entropy 
of the average state of the ensemble after passing the channel. For a single qubit, 
this is at most 1 bit when the state is maximally mixed. The second term is the 
weighted average of the entropies of the individual quantum states. When each state 
E(px) is pure, its entropy is 0, and consequently, the second term sums to 0.
Therefore, the maximal value of x is achieved when the average state of the 
ensemble is maximally mixed, yielding an entropy of 1 bit, and simultaneously, each 
individual state is pure, contributing no entropy. This scenario results in xmax = 1 
bit.
13.3.3 * Subadditivity and Strong Subadditivity
The subadditivity and strong subadditivity properties of von Neumann entropy 
mathematically encapsulate how entropy behaves in quantum operations, forming 
a crucial underpinning for various key theorems. Notably, these properties are 
instrumental in the proofs of the quantum data processing inequality (DPI) and the 
Holevo-Schumacher-Westmoreland (HSW) theorem, both of which are central to our 
understanding of quantum communication and information processing.
1 
Subadditivity (SA)
For any composite quantum system AB , subadditivity asserts that the total entropy 
of the system does not exceed the sum of the entropies of its constituent subsystems. 
Mathematically, this is expressed as:
S(PAB) < S(PA)+ S(PB), 
(13.62)
where pAB is the density operator of the composite system AB , and pA and pB are 
the reduced density operators of the subsystems A and B , respectively.
This principle of subadditivity indicates that the total entropy of combined 
quantum systems is constrained by the sum of the individual entropies of each 
system.
A related inequality that sets the lower bound of S(PAB) is the Araki-Lieb 
inequality:
S(PAB) >|S(PA) - S(PB)| 
(13.63)
An important implication of subadditivity is that in a quantum system, the 
mutual information—a measure of the total correlations between subsystems A and 
B—is always non-negative:
I(A; B) = S(PA) + S(PB) - S(PAB) > 0.
(13.64)

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
435
2 
Strong Subadditivity (SSA)
Strong Subadditivity (SSA) of von Neumann entropy further generalizes the concept 
of subadditivity to tripartite quantum systems, encompassing three subsystems A, 
B , and C . The SSA is mathematically expressed as:
S(Pabc) + S(Pb) < S(Pab) + S(Pbc), 
(13.65)
where pABc is the density operator for the combined system and pAB ,pBc are the 
density operators for two of the bipartite subsystems.
This inequality encapsulates a more intricate interplay of entropic relationships 
in a composite system. It implies that the total entropy of the entire system ABC 
plus the entropy of one of its parts (B) is no greater than the sum of the entropies 
of two overlapping subsystems (AB and BC).
While the proof of the classical version of SSA is relatively straightforward, 
proving the quantum SSA presents significant challenges. This increased difficulty 
arises from the non-commutative nature of the density operators that describe 
quantum subsystems. Despite these challenges, several distinct proofs have been 
developed to establish SSA in quantum systems.
SSA is a powerful tool in quantum information, providing a deeper understanding 
of entropy dynamics in complex quantum systems and forming a theoretical basis 
for key theorems in quantum communication and information processing.

13.5 Summary and Conclusions
Chapter Overview
This chapter on quantum information delves into three core areas: quantum prob­
ability, quantum entropy and information, and advanced theorems. It starts by 
contrasting quantum probability with classical probability, highlighting unique 
quantum features like entanglement. The discussion then shifts to quantum en­
tropy, comparing it with classical Shannon entropy, and examines quantum mutual 
information. Finally, the chapter explores advanced concepts like the quantum

436
data processing inequality, the Holevo theorem, and subadditivity in quantum sys­
tems, emphasizing their importance in quantum communication and theoretical 
underpinnings.
Quantum Probability Essentials
The first section delves into the essentials of quantum probability, highlighting its 
distinctive features compared to classical probability. Key concepts such as complex­
valued probability amplitudes, entanglement, and non-commutativity of quantum 
observables are explored. The section provides a foundational understanding of how 
quantum probability resembles and differs from classical probability. This exploration 
lays the groundwork for understanding quantum entropy and information.
Quantum Entropy and Information
Next, the chapter shifts focus to quantum entropy and information. It provides 
a comprehensive understanding of classical Shannon entropy and its quantum 
counterpart, von Neumann entropy, highlighting their roles in quantifying uncertainty 
in classical and quantum systems. Additionally, the concepts of classical joint 
entropy, mutual information, and their quantum analogs are explored. Through 
these discussions, the section offers insights into how quantum mechanics reshapes the 
understanding of informational relationships and interdependencies, demonstrating 
the unique nature of quantum information.
Core Theorems in Quantum Information
The final part of the chapter delves into core theorems and concepts central to 
quantum information theory. It begins with an exploration of the quantum data 
processing inequality, which posits that the entropy of a quantum system cannot 
decrease under the application of CPTP operations. This principle underlines the 
non-decreasing nature of entropy in quantum processes, reflecting phenomena such 
as the loss of coherence, the irreversibility of certain quantum operations, and the 
constraints on information extraction from quantum systems.
The discussion then moves to the Holevo theorem, which sets fundamental limits 
on the amount of classical information that can be transmitted using quantum 
states through quantum channels. This theorem is essential in understanding the 
boundaries of quantum communication.
Additionally, this section covers the properties of subadditivity and strong 
subadditivity of von Neumann entropy. These mathematical formulations are useful 
in analyzing the entropic characteristics of composite quantum systems.
This part of the chapter weaves together these advanced concepts, providing 
insights into their theoretical importance and practical implications in the broader 
landscape of quantum information science.

13.2 For classical Shannon entropy, we have the property that H(X) < H(X,Y), 
reflecting the intuition that the uncertainty of a single variable X cannot 
exceed that of the joint system X and Y . This exercise explores whether 
a similar property holds in the quantum realm with von Neumann entropy, 
specifically, whether S(pA) < S(pAB) for the following cases:
(a) A Bell state |$) = 12(|00) + |11)).
(b) A classically correlated state pAB = 1 (|00)(00| + |11)(11|).
13.3 Coherent information is defined as I(A)B) = S(pB) — S(pAB). It is known 
to be a measure of quantum correlations. Positivity of coherent information 
indicates that quantum correlations are present. Use the following cases to 
demonstrate this.
(a) A Bell state |$) = 12(|00) + |11)).
(b) A product state |^) = 112(|0) + |1)) ® (|0) + |1)).
13.4 Consider a mixed state described by the density operator p. Since p is 
Hermitian, it can also be regarded as an observable. Set H = p in Eq. 13.14 
for expected value and Eq. 13.15 for the variance. Simplify these equations 
and discuss their physical meanings, particularly in the context of the purity 
of the state.
13.5 Consider a two-qubit (A and B) system composed of 50% in the uniform mixed 
state 41 and 50% in the Bell state 112(|00) + |11)). We define two random

They represent measuring qubit A in the {|+), |—)} basis, and qubit B in the 
computational basis.

(h) Calculate the reduced density operators pA and pB.
(i) Calculate the joint entropy S(pAB), and the entropies of the subsystems 
S (pA) and S (pB).
(j) Calculate the mutual information I(A; B).
13.6 Consider two quantum systems A and B , each in a maximally mixed state of 
dimension d:

Prove that the entropies S(pA) and S(pB) are both log d, and that the joint 
entropy S(pAB) and mutual information I(A; B) are also log d, indicating 
perfect classical correlation in the joint system.
13.7 Consider a mixed state represented by the density operator p = p |0)(0| + (1 — 
p) |1)(1|, where the state is |0) with probability p and |1) with probability 1 — p 
for 0 < p < 1.
Apply the following CPTP map representing a depolarizing channel:
E(p) = (1 - s)p +Sl,
where s is the probability of depolarization, and I is the identity operator.
Your tasks are:
(a) Calculate the von Neumann entropy of the initial state p.
(b) Apply the depolarizing channel E to p and find the resulting state.
(c) Calculate the von Neumann entropy of the state after applying the map.
(d) Compare the entropies before and after applying E to illustrate that 
entropy does not decrease.
13.8 
 Prove the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) from the Strong Subadditivity 
(SSA) property.
*
The data processing inequality in quantum information theory asserts that 
the entropy S of a quantum state p cannot decrease under the action of 
a Completely Positive Trace-Preserving (CPTP) map E. Formally, this is 
expressed as:
S(E(p)) > S(p)■

Chapter 13. Fundamentals of Quantum Information
439
To prove the data processing inequality using the strong subadditivity of 
quantum entropy,
S(pabc) + S(Pb) < S(Pab ) + S(Pbc),
follow these steps:
a. Consider a tripartite system described by the state PABC , with PA being 
the subsystem of interest and PBC an environment subsystem used in the 
Stinespring dilation for a CPTP map E (see § 12.2.7.1). Here, PABC = 
| ^X^ Iabc represents a unitary dilation on an expanded system, and 
PA = trBC (PABC) is the initial state of subsystem A.
b. Apply the CPTP map E to the subsystem PC of PABC, resulting in a new 
state p 'ABC = (I a ® Ib ® Ec )( pabc ).
c. Trace out the environment subsystem (BC) in pabc to obtain E (pA) = p'A, 
where p'A is the state of subsystem A after the application of the CPTP 
map, illustrating the Stinespring dilation theorem in action.
d. Utilize the strong subadditivity property and the non-increasing nature of 
entropy under partial trace to connect S(pABc) and S(pBc) with S(pA) 
and S(E(pA)).
e. Apply strong subadditivity to demonstrate that S(E(pA)) > S(pA), 
thereby establishing the data processing inequality.
13.9 
 Prove the Holevo Bound using Strong Subadditivity.
*
The Holevo Bound is a fundamental result in quantum information theory 
that establishes an upper limit on the amount of classical information that 
can be transmitted securely using quantum states. Specifically, it limits the 
accessible information that can be extracted from a quantum ensemble.
Given an ensemble of quantum states {px} with probabilities {p(x)}, the 
Holevo Bound states that the mutual information between the classical variable 
X representing the choice of quantum state and the quantum variable Y 
representing the measurement outcomes is bounded by:
X({P(x) ,px }) = S 
x p(x)px - x p(x)S(px ),
where X is the Holevo quantity, S(•) denotes the von Neumann entropy, and 
x p(x)px is the average state of the ensemble.
To prove the Holevo Bound using the Strong Subadditivity (SSA) property, 
follow these steps:
a. Begin by considering a quantum ensemble X = {p(x), px}, where each 
quantum state px is prepared with probability p(x). Construct a tripartite 
system pABc , where A represents the classical variable X encoded in 
a quantum state, B is the quantum system prepared in the state px 
corresponding to X , and C is an ancillary system intro duced to purify 
the state of AB .

Problem Set 13
440
b. Express the average state p = XPx p(x)px and consider the purification 
Pabc such that pAB = £xp(x) |x)A (x| ® px and p = tra,c(pabc).
c. Apply the strong subadditivity property, S(pABc) + S(pB) < S(pAB) + 
S(pBC), to the constructed quantum ensemble and purification, taking 
into account that the purification pABC makes S (pABC) = 0 and S(pAB) 
represents the entropy of the classical-quantum state.
d. Use the definition of the Holevo quantity x(X) and relate it to the 
entropies in the strong subadditivity inequality. Specifically, show how 
x(X) can be expressed in terms of S(pAB) and S(pB), considering that 
S(pB) = S(p) due to the purification process.
e. Conclude that the Holevo quantity x(X), representing the accessible 
information from the quantum ensemble, is bounded by the difference 
S(p) - x p(x)S (px ), thereby proving the Holevo Bound.

B Trigonometry
Definitions and Basic Properties
Note: n is an integer. sin 0 is also denoted as sin(0). The inverse of x = sin 0, 
8 = arcsin x, is also written as 0 = sin-1 x. The extended inverse arcsin2(y,x), or 
asin2(y, x), extends the range to [—n, n] by considering the signs of x and y. Similarly, 
for other trig functions.
