expanding into a large, horriﬁc monstrosity, lining the skyline and blotting the
sun. It had a site and a name. The site was Earls Court. Its name was "PC
Show".
I would like to take this opportunity to thank companies and freelancers for making
my PC Show this year slightly better than being roasted on the spike of eternal pain
(as it was last year). It wasn't a mammoth event, but at least my clothes weren't singed.
Those who haven't noticed, this is our Christmas issue (and what an issue), but I
think I'll use the rest of this space to promote the next issue; it certainly deserves promoting.
As from next month, YC will be a different magazine to the one that we have all
become used to over its ﬁve years o f existence. One major move is the inclusion of
a free cassette every issue, full of games, games, and more games. The interior will change
in content too. Your Programmer will depart (alas, alack, and other words beginning
with ala), but to replace it will be an abundance of new regular columns,
There will be new staff too, to make sure our games coverage will be the most up-
to-date available, with tonnes of hot exclusives. So make sure you've got an order with
your newsagent now, we wouldn't want you to miss out now, would we?
Rik Henderson
All the staff wish our readers a splendiferous Christmas.

PC Show 1989
This year's PC Show was a
gross disappointment for the
record crowds that turned
up to be stunned by the in-
dustry's Christmas fare, As
each year goes by, more
companies are abandoning
the principle o f  showing
computer games and getting
hooked o n  cramming as
many arcade machines into
their smaller and smaller
stands.
Ocean had an impressive
position which formed the
entrance to the leisure sec-
tion of the hall. Fronted by
two Fifties Cadillacs, the
main feature was a  video
wall showing forthcoming
attractions, including The
Untouchables
US Gold!i crowd pleaser
was an Outrun Ferrari, while
Mindscape went for an early
Harley Davidson w a s  this
the alternative Motor Show?
Without a  doubt, the
show-stealer was Domark!v
Hard Driving', a strong tip
for the Christmas number
one, This conversion of Ten-
gens. coin-op has the added
attraction o f an action re-
play which allows you to
relive the moment the car
crumpled. The stunt track is
particularly exhilerating.
This year the leisure sec-
tion couldn't ﬁll the area
allotted to it. Many of the
big players were either miss-
ing or represented by mini-
mum-area stands. Where
were Mirrorsoft. Alternative
or Code Masters? You could
be forgiven fo r  missing
Microprose's stand which
could have been set up in a
telephone booth - consider-
ing the size of the company
it was an insult to their cus-
tomers. Perhaps the booth
was meant to attract atten-
tion to the company's take
over o f Telecom. A t least
Activision had a few Ghost-
busters doing the rounds.
I think the effect of the
whole Show could best be
seen by the way the massive
crush at lunchtime thinned
Out before mid-afternoon,
and almost emptied an hour
before the event closed_

Show Wars
Who would have thought
that this year's PC Show
would be the last? Come to
think of it, it was rather like
a wake. Some of the glitter
of its past glory was still
there but it was as tarnished
as last year's tinsel.

King Hell
Demonic is the only way to
describe Rik Mayall's per-
formance at US Golds' VIP
sideshow. Every day, after
the Show closes, the exhibi-
tors hit the town for various
alcoholic frolics. There's
usually one event that stands
head and shoulders above
the others and this year it
was US Gold's turn,
The select 'assembly at
London's Limelight club
were treated to a preview of

ceded to prove what a horny
little devil he is with an act
which w a s  l i b e r a l l y

would remove him from any
bulletin board in the coun-
try. The performance was
superb though it still needs
to be tightened up to give
US Gold's latest video
(yawn) after which company
boss G e o f f  B r o w n
announced a  personal
appearance b y  Michael
Jackson. Not THE Michael
Jackson but a moonwalking
clone from Deptford.
Then th e  Hallelujah

Nothing happened. Then the

jokes and swearing are more
the preserve o f  Bernard
Manning than the laughing
stock in trade of an alterna-

If I remember nothing
more about the Show it will
be US Gold's evening treat.
What's the score?
Mieroprose boss, Maj or
(Wild Bill) Stealey had a lot
on his mind during the
Show. Frantic nocturnal
phone calls to the States as
much as four times a night.
Was the company going
down the john? Had the
Russians attacked Micro-
prose HQ? Surely some dis-
aster had beset the company.
But no, his frantic calls re-
lated to his second greatest
obsession, baseball! All he
wanted was to keep up with
the action as it happened.

Would-be games machine
manufacturers, Konix, seem
to be getting plenty of sup-
port from the software in-
dustry but the Show leaves
a couple o f questions un-
answered. Considering the
Konix Christmas push will
start in November, it would
be expected that everything
would be up and running on
the Ko n i x stand. Well,
everything was up -  the
games, the novel controller
and the large frame to mount
everything on. The problem
was that only the games were
running.
Nowhere was there a
ﬁnished, fully working and
fully visible machine. The

Levelled Out
Britain's senior adventurers,
Level 9 Computing, is pull-
ing out o f  the adventure
market after the release of
Scapeghost.
According to  1,9 de-
signer, Pete Austin, "People
have been declaring the
death o f  the adventure
market for years so Scape-
ghost is an appropriate ﬁnal
release. It comes from be-
yond the grave."
The company has been
producing adventures since
1981 and it is sad to see them
go. Perhaps part o f  the
problem lies way back when
Melbourne House produced
1
The Hobbit and took the
software market by storm.
L9 resisted following the
new style of adding graphics
to adventures, a  concept
pioneered by Sierra Online
many years earlier. Since
then Magnetic Scrolls has
further advanced the popu-
lar adventure while L9 has
maintained the opposing
view that complexity o f
gameplay is the main thing.
Whatever the reason for
the move, we thank Level 9
for hours of fun and we look
fonvard to their new venture
as an arcade-style games
company using their new
development kit, HUGE, for
16 bit programming.

WILF
This is the oldest of the six
titles dating back to  1984
which, in terms of computer
games, makes it practically
a museum piece. The great
magician Ulrich has disco-
vered that there is an object
in existence o f such great
power that he must posses
it. Unfortunately, the frag-
ments of the Dragon Amulet
are scattered through the
fabric o f  time itself and
Ulrich is an old man.
Enter Wilf, his protege.
You have been charged with
recovering the various frag-
ments for your master. The
only help that he can give
you is to ﬁx a pair of wings
to your back, allowing you
to ﬂy over the many hazards.
The game is divided into
several time zones and you
have to ﬁnd a way through
the cave system, collecting
bits of the amulet until a time
gate appears transporting
you to  another period o f
history.
The game involves little
more than moving round the
screen, avoiding bumping
into the many obstacles.
There isn't even any combat
to keep you on your toes.
Wilf is deﬁnitely beginning
to show his age now. Ever-

graphics, sound and game-

BOMBJACK
II
Imagine PacMan crossed
with a platform game and
you will have some sort of
idea of what Bomb Jack II
is all about. There are forty
different screens -  sp l i t
between a  reptile infested
lava pit and outer space —
each consisting of a number
of platforms. On these plat-
forms are a  number o f
bombs to be collected but
inevitably, they are pro-
tected b y  p a tr o l l i n g
monsters.
Jack has to ﬁnd a route
round the platforms either
dodging the baddies o r
repeatedly stabbing them
until they disappear from the
game. Wait too long and the
lizard men in their various
incarnations leave their reg-
ular patrols and start chas-
ing round the screen. There
are bonuses to be collected
if you manage to defuse all
i
order.
Unlike the original game,
you cannot leap willy-nilly
round the screen. Instead,
you can only move sideways
onto a platform on the same
level, or up and down to one
immediately above or below
you. This means that not
only does your timing have
to be pretty good, but you
also have to pay considera-
ble attention t o  y o u r
intended route.
As far as the game goes,
that just about sums it up.
Despite some fuzzy gra-
phics, Bomb Jack II is highly
addictive and, if the sequel
is not quite as good as the
original, this is deﬁnitely the

from a  Wicked Witch's

Your ultimate aim is to
ﬁnd the witch's castle and

undead forces she com-

encounter you must battle
your way through a forest,
ﬁghting o ff wariors and

TURBO
ESPRIT
"Race your Lotus Esprit
round the city chasing drug
barons" claims the blurb. It
is only when you get behind
the controls of your car that
you discover that it handles
more like a Model T Ford
as it chugs along.
Four smugglers' cars and
an armoured vehicles are at
large somewhere on the
city's streets and it is up to
you to ﬁnd them. You must
then take them out by either
blasting them or continually
bumping into them until
they surrender. There are
pedestrians and other inno-
cent cars to  avoid i f  you
don't want to incur penalty
points and you can also write
your car off by driving into
a brick wall. My favourite
bit though is that you have
to stop fo r trafﬁc lights!
Imagine i t, a  high speed
chase, guns blazing and the
lights suddenly turn to red.
Do you really believe that
everybody is going to stop
and wait for them to turn
to green again?
There are four cities to
choose from, each laid out
in typical American grid
formation. You can call up
a map to show your location
as well as that of the enemy
cars. Messages inform you
that the armoured car has
just been spotted on E 19 or
whatever. The problem is
that you have to wait ages
before you actually arrive on
the scene. The balance of this
game is all wrong.
Dreadful graphics, con-
trol and gameplay only serve
to emphasise the faults
inherent in Turbo Esprit. I
didn't like it when it was ﬁrst
released and things have not
improved with time.

Deep Strike quickly dis-

a single ﬁghter pilot trying

there are all the barrage
balloons and some decidedly
anachronistic tanks and ﬁeld
artillery, all trying to blast
you out of the skies.
You can climb, dive and
bank as you try to avoid the
enemy. You have no sights
on your plane so all shooting
amounts to guesswork. That
is i f you want to shoot in
the ﬁrst place. You have a
decidedly small amount o f
ammunition and should you
decide to defend yourself to
any great extent, you will
ﬁnd that you have run out
of bullets before you are half
way to your target.
This is a below average

then this double pack could
be your answer. It contains
an easy game system, tough
computer opponents, even a
pack of cards and a cribbage

Cribbage is one of the
most popular card games
and has often been compute-

for cribbage games have
been included in the pages
of this magazine; what
makes this one different?
You can play two or four
handed crib and you have
seven different opponents
each with their own style of
playing. It also manages to
cram the board, your cards
and the play on the screen
so you can follow exactly
what's happening.
If Cribbage King is good,
Gin King is a real surprise
package. Its a  game that

is very tricky thus combining

For a beginner the pro-

other computer players
including basic strategy and

YOUR COMMODORE
You can play the game
at four different levels from
high school t o  pro, that
means the game will get
faster, the players stronger
and tougher. In fact, there's
a chance when there's a
penalty that a ﬁght might
start which is displayed for
all the crowd to see on the
above rink TV system. This
system is also used by the
referees to call penalties and
for goal celebrations.
The action is only part
of the game as good coach-
ing or strategy can win a
game. In  this part o f the
game you must decide when
to swap the team, or line, on
ice for one of two substitute
lines with different ﬁtness
levels and skills. You can
also call one of ﬁve plays to
send your team up the ice
in a set formation or decide
vihether to attack or defend
when you're short of a player
due to a penalty.
Add to  that l o t, fu l l
player and team stats, sud-
den detah overtime and slow
motion action replay and
you have a cracking hockey
game. The only drawback
that I can see is that there
isn't a  league to  play i n
although, l  suppose, you
could make up your own.

Is it a ghost story? Is it a detective
story? Gordon Hamlett takes on the
part of Inspectrel

ou 'cannot remember
how it was that you
came to be at a fun-
eral_ nor whose i t is B u t
when you sneak a look at
the name on the card on the
wreath you get the shock of
your life. Although in these
particular circumstances,
that phrase can hardly be
said to be apt. The funeral
is your own!
You are, or rather were

policeman hot on the trail of
a gang o f drug smugglers.
Someone or something went
wrong though and the gang
was tipped o ff. On l y a
chance encounter stopped
your assistant from being
similarly dispatched but she
has now been taken pri-
soner. What really hurts
though, i s that your ex-
colleagues at the funeral are
blaming you for what hap-
pened. Can you clear your
name in only three nights
and also bring the criminals
to justice? And all this when
you are only a ghost!
As night falls, so you
start to encounter some of
your kindred spirits_ The late
publican soon befriends you
and offers to  show you
round. The other ghosts
would help you too but they
have problems of their own;
the colonel is worried about
the vandals in the graveyard,
a 'happily' married couple
are bickering about who
owns the wreath and so on.
As well as helping them,
you have to learn about and
practice your new ghostly
skills -  levitating objects,
walking through walls etc.
One of the problems is that
you cannot carry very much
in your ethereal state and so
the manipulation of objects
is not as straightforward as
in other adventures. When
you are struggling to hold on
to a leaf, what hope is there
that you can open stone
cofﬁns? Strong light causes
you to weaken rapidly and
as you progress in the game,
so you encounter other typ-
ical undead problems such
as how to get past running
water.
The game comes in three
parts, each getting progres-
sively harder_ You only have
a certain amount of time to
accomplish your tasks as
you have to be back in your
new home before sunup. The
game features Level 9's
excellent parser and cer-
tainly, I  had no difﬁculty
with the vocabulary. The
pictures are excellent and
add very nicely t o  th e
atmosphere.
The story is wonderfully
original and I think that this
must be the best Level 9
game for a long time. As it
is to be their last adventure
before trying their hand at
something new, they have
certainly managed to go out
on a  high note_ Highly
recommended.

cause, assisted b y his old
mate Alan Sharam. Now,
with their abilities combined
with Virgin Games' boss,
Nick Alexander, Virgin
Mastertronic has a  new
vitality.
Virgin Games hadn't
really done very much since
Dan Dare but it blossomed
earlier this year with the
brilliant Silkworm and the
highly successful Double
Dragon. More fruits are now
starting to appear in time for
the Christmas consumers
and Double Dragon I I  is
spearheading the attack.
At the end o f Double
Dragon, Billy and Jimmy
Lee made Marion a  free
woman again, but her cap-
tors, the Black Warriors
were not totally eliminated.
One member escaped and
she, with her new Tong, have
dispatched Marion to that
great pagoda in the sky. Billy
and Jimmy are a bit peeved
off and have sworn revenge
and will be out for vengeance
in November. Eight bit or 16
bit, the choice is yours.
Taito's Ninja Warriors is
another Ninja binger cur-
rently in the Virgin M aster-
tronic pipeline and due for
release in December. Rebel
leader, Marc, has built two
Ninja robots to defeat the
world's latest dictator,
Rangier. These Ninja War-
riors are under your control
as they make bangler's crim-
inal army see stars (little,
pointed metal ones). Can I
save the world sure I can.
Continental Circus has
nothing to do with jugglers
but, from what I saw at the
YOUR COMMODORE
Show, you do need a lot of
balls to  get through this
roadrace. As race games go
it has little to lead me to
recommend i t  over th e
hordes o f  games o f  this
genre. As good as some,
better than many, it will have
a hard time battling against
Domark's excellent Hard
Driving' or the reputation
preceding the launch of US
Gold's Outrun
By far the biggest news
from the Virgin Master-
tronic stand at the Show was
their Christmas Coin-op
Collection Competition.
With p r i z e s  to ta l l i n g
E30,000, it's the biggest gam-
ble that the company has
ever taken - either before or
after the take over.
The competition is based
around Virgin Games Silk-
worm, Gemini Wing, Shi-
nobi, Continental Circus,
Double Dragon II and Ninja
Warriors. To qualify, tokens
must be collected from any
three of these games before
January 1990. Submitting
the game and answering a
'simple' question puts an
entry in the grand draw and
the ﬁve winners will each
receive £1,000 worth of their
chosen software (not neces-
sarily Virgin Mastertronic
stock), o r  £500 worth o f
software plus an Amiga for
the intelligent or an Atari ST
for those who don't recog-
nise a bargain when they see
one - by the way, I noticed
one friendly loon at the show
scrawled 'HI' between the S
and T  o f the Atari logo.
Although we don't condone
such disgraceful behaviour -
good on yer, sport. And to
show no ill intent against
Atari, what do you call
Silkworm on the ST? Virgin
on the ridiculous.
The rest o f  the prize
money for the competition
comprises 10 second prizes
of .C500 of software and £250
worth for each of the 20 third
prize winners.

The sequel to last year's Christmas
number one leads Ocean's challenge

bolt is the sequel to
the chart topping
Operation Wolf, It is already
a big hit in the arcades and
aims to repeat the success of
its predecessor, thus claim-
ing the lucrative Christmas
number one spot for Ocean
for the second time in a row.
When the reports ﬁrst
started coming in it was clear
that ﬂight number 102 from
Paris to Boston had been hi-
jacked. I t  had changed
course fo r somewhere i n
Africa and information
r eceived reveals that the
plane has landed in hostile
territory and the terrorists
have issued their demands.
Weary from your last
Operation Wolf mission you
are persuaded to launch a
rescue mission, only this

Twenty
time you don't have to go
alone as you can take one
of your buddies with you
Which is just as well as this
is going to be a tough mis-
sion behind enemy lines. So
the game actually consists of
a series of small missions or
stages that lead to the ﬁnal
battle onboard ﬂight 102.
Your ﬁrst task is to ﬁnd
out where the plane had
landed and you need some
information. To get this you
must b a ttl e  y o u r  w a y
through an array of enemy
troops (that ﬁre guns and
hurl grenades and knives at
you) until you can meet up
with your contact wrho will
direct you to mission two -
which is an attempt to attack
and seize the enemy's supply
and arms dump.
Eventually, y o u  w i l l

board the plane and engage
in a pitch battle with the
terrorists who use the seats
as cover, Your only hope is
to ﬁght your way to the ﬂight
deck and hope the pilot
survives the battle, so he can
ﬂy you and the hostages to
safety,
Operation Thunderbolt
has many things in common
with its prequel but also
boasts a whole new range of
action features, Secnes and
missions alternate between
Op Wo l f style sideways
scrolling screens and the new
3D views where you ﬁght as
you move into the screen.
The troops, tanks, para-
troopers and helicopters of
Op Wolf are back in action,
but they are also joined by
jet ﬁghters and new weapons
(including rocket launchers
and knives) to dodge and
destroy. The players still
have a limited number o f
machine gun cartridges and
grenades that can be topped
up b y collecting supplies,
and you can also collect new
equipment such as a laser
sight for increased accuracy
and a bullet proof vest to
• save your dwindling force.
The biggest single differ-
ence to  the game is the
addition of a second player
that not only doubles your
ﬁrepower against the enemy
but also produces incredible
rivalry as shot to hit percen-
tages are compared and
supplies and equipment are
vied for.
Look out for this one as
Operation Thunderbolt is
going to be a monster hit.

Wayne is the mild
mannered head o f  th e
Wayne Foundation but at
night, when evil stalks the
streets of Gotham City, he
becomes the sinister masked
vigilante known only as
Batman.
Crusading against crime
from the rooftops o f  the
sickened ci ty, Batman's
main aim is to eliminate Gus
Grissom's criminal empire
and in particular Jack Nap-
ier, his psychotic second in
command who, following an
accident in his own chemical
factory, becomes twisted
both mentally and physi-
cally, and transfroms into
the Joker. Your battle with
the Joker takes you through
ﬁve stages of the game that
follow scenes from the hit
movie.
The Axis chemical plant
is the setting for the ﬁrst
stage, in which you must
negotiate the network o f
ladders and ramps with help
from your Batrope, and ﬁght
the Joker's henchmen with
your Batarang. It is on the
ﬁnal scene of this level where
Jack Napier falls into a vat
of chemicals and becomes
the Joker.
In scene two you have
just rescued Vicky Vale from
the clutches of the Joker and
are making good y o u r
escape. However, this isn't
going to be easy as you not
only have to avoid the Jok-
er's men, but also the police
cars and road blocks. Drive
fast, and follow the direc-
tions highlighted b y  the
Batdirectional computer.

Smilex which kills on con-
tact. Level four takes you
back onto the streets o f
Gotham City only this time
in the Batwing. The Joker
has massive balloons full of
Smilex gas that he is about
to release on unsuspecting
crowds. Your task is to use
the Batwing to cut the ropes
that secure these balloons so
they ﬂoat o ff harmlessly.
However, one wrong move
and the balloons could burst

The ﬁnal duel between
Batman and the Joker comes
at the top of Gotham City
cathedral. This is similar to
the ﬁrst encounter in level
one except our hero must
also watch out for crumbling
ﬂoors and rapid rats.
With the ﬁlm's success
behind it the game cannot
fail. However, under the
hype, costume and drama it
is simply a shoot-em-up with
two platform game elements
and, in level 3, a Master-
mind.

Gordon Hamlett waits for a full moon
before taking a look at Activision's
lates release.
I N I
What's a  were-
wolf? Shut up and
comb your face! It is a well
known fact that the Gods on
Mount Olympus did n o t
always live a life of perfect
harmony. Indeed, th e y
seemed to be constantly at
loggerheads w i t h  o n e
another. The only advantage
was that being gods, they
didn't actually have to get
their o w n  hands d i rty.
Instead, they would just toss
a few thunderbolts around
and inﬂuence the lives of a
couple of mortals to go and
do their dirty work for them.
Anyway, it appears that
the goddess Athena (should
be Athene) has got herself
captured by Nelf the Evil
Lord o f  the Underworld
(why invent a name? What's
wrong with calling him Dis
or Pluto?). Zeus decides to
rescue her but instead o f
doing it himself, empowers
you, a dead centurion, (note
the subtle switch from Greek
to Roman mythology
methings t h a t  whoever
wrote this was not a classi-
cist) with the strength o f
some of the most fearsome
beasts in the kingdom.
So it is that you embark
on this adventure, shape-
shifting as you become more
and more powerful. Your
various guises include that of
a strongman. were-wolf,
bear, were-dragon, were -
tiger and golden wolfman.
Despite my mocking it,
the storyline sounds reason-
ably inventive. I t  is only
when you actually start to
play the game, that you
realise that you've been here
before. Yes, the game is yet
another beat-em-up, and not
a very good one at that.
As you wander along
each section, so there are
hordes of zombies and the
like fo r you to  kill. The
problem is that this is all too
easy. Each of your incarna-
tions has a special weapon-
super strong punch, ﬁre
breathing and so on. All you
have to do is to ﬁnd out how
best to use that weapon. For
example, on the ﬁrst level,
crouching down and punch-
ing will see o ff all your
opponents. The only excep-
tion are the creatures that
spring at you. These are the
important ones, since when
you destroy one o f these,
they release a  'spirit ball'
which bounces round the
screen. Catching this effects
your metamorphosis.
The rest of the game is
pretty dire too. The graphics
are dreadful - very fuzzy and
unclear. Scrolling too leaves
a lot to be desired. You sped
most of the game on the right
hand edge o f  the screen
waiting for the background
to catch up. All in all, this
game's a very poor effort and
should be left well alone.

going to be tough. It will not
be simply a case of using the
right object i n  the right
place_ Even knowing exactly
what he is doing, the author
reckons that it will take him
about seven hours to com-
plete the game so what hope
is there for us lesser mortals.
Finally, a  game sche-
duled for release early next
year is 1st Person Pinball, a
version of the arcade game.
This game is unusual in so
much as you can switch from
the usual top down 2-D view
of the table to a 3-D pers-
pective of the game as seen
from the ball's point of view.
As a dedicated pinball freak,
there is a  serious lack o f
decent games on the Amiga.
Hopefully, 1st Person Pin-
ball should be just what the
doctor ordered.

routine supply mission
to Cygnus 61 when sud-
dently, everything went very
wrong. Firstly, you managed
to crash your ship on landing
and now have to ﬁnd mate-
rials to  get i t ﬁxed and
secondly, the colonists seem
to have disappeared which
isn't all that surprising as the
base is now overrun b y
mutating aliens.
The base in question is
represented on screen as a
series of scrolling 3D rooms
and corridors which forms
the main part of the screen
display. Around this are ﬁve
smaller display's that include
movement icons, what you
are holding in each hand,
your backpack and a per-
sonal display showing your
current state of health and
a picture of you that you can
customise using the pro-
grams DNA machine so that
your on screen persona can
match yourself, a  hero or
favourite Your Commodore
reviewer. One particularly
impressive feature o f  the
game is that when you are
getting something out o f
your backpack that screen
ﬁlls the main screen area and
the player status screen
becomes a mini version of
the 31) view that still scrolls
and displays all monsters
and objects so you can carry
on with the action.
Apart from the variety of
background displays o f
which the enclosed air ducts
are my favourite, the range
of weapons featuring laser
riﬂes, stun pistols, grenades
and alien seeking robomines
and the objects such as a
proximity detector that you
can ﬁnd, the main appeal of
the game is its range of aliens
and the way they change and
mutate. One example is best
described in its adult form
as an insectoid lobster but
begins as a  harmless egg
which can be easily fried
with a single blast of a laser
gun. Once it hatches it turns
into a worm like larvae that
scurries away to hide from
you, where i t wraps itself
into a cocoon and metamor-
phosises into the insectoid
lobster that comes looking
for you.
Not all creatures are that
complex as the game also
features a rather unpleasant
green blob that when blasted
turns into two green blobs!
In this game you have to
learn which weapons to use
against which creature and
it isn't always easy to do this
when you're ﬂeeing from a
horde of monsters.

MACRO
ASSEMBLER
Be the master of your
machine code program
with this extensive 3
pass macro assembler
By I. Goffe
M
have been available for the
Commodore 64 since the
arrival of the machine, but sadly many
such pieces of software are scarce in
the shop today. I have noticed a steady
revival of assemblers, thanks largely
to magazine such as this, it is especially
true o f the 6510+ assembler in the
May/June issue of its sister magazine
Commodore Disk User, which offers
many more facilities than its commer-
cial counterparts. My Macro assem-
bler is intended to  be yet another
valuable tool to  the machine code
programmer, with the added bonus of
macro, and conditional assembly; this
allows much more structure to  be
implemented into your own machine
code programs.
Presented here is a sophisticated 3-
pass 6502/6510 Macro Assembler that
supports many advanced features,
including:
Full macro assembly with parameter
passing;
Linkable source ﬁles;
Including directly from disk;
Symbol table/ buffer space memory
conﬁgure;
Conditional assembly (IF, THEN,
ELSE);
Symbol table cross-referencing;
Selective assembly output;
Full DOS support;
Extendable capabilities.
The assembler can be conﬁgured
to work with either disk, or cassette
ﬁling.
The Assembler - Getting
Started
The assembler code runs from S6E00-
SA000. To initialise the assembler from
a cold start type: SYS 28160, this re-
directs the RESTORE key to allow
you to enter the assembler command
mode with a single stroke key press.
If you should change the RESTORE
key vector use SYS 28160, which will
re-initialise once more, The use of a
cold start also clears the current
symbol, macro directory, and macro
library areas.
Once a cold start has been issued
as above, the program title will be
displayed, at this point as Basic wedge
was to be used to enter the assembler
command mode, but I  wanted the
system to be able to run alongside an
extended Basic if there are no memory
conﬂicts. I opted for the idea of being
able to call up the main assembler
command mode by pressing a single
key which emulate the Basic command
'SYS 28215' which calls u p  the
assembler command mode via a warm
start.
To summarise, pressing RES-
TORE whilst in the basic editor will
automatically do the Basic command
'S YS 28215' to jump into the assembler
via a warm start.
Extra Note on Compatability
with Action Replay
Some ROM routines which are called
inside the assembler seem to corrupt
Nv he n the assembler is ﬁrst run, to get
around this problem follows these
steps...
11. Type SYS 64738 to jump into a
normal reset
2. Press the reset button on the back
of the cartridge to exit back to the
'FASTLOAD' interpreter which will
allow the assembler to operate. In this
case all FASTLOAD/ Warp loading
can be used in conjunction with the
assembler, making source ﬁle 110
extremely fast and effective,
The RESTORE key does not work
correctly with TASILOAD' installed,
so a manual 'SYS 28125' needed to
be typed to jump into the assembler
command mode.
Entering Source Files
The source ﬁles are maintained in the
standard Basic editor, so you will not
need the assembler present for actually
entering the source. As in Basic only
lines 0-63999 are valid.
The source must follow a  set
format, however, true ﬁeld-tabulation
is not required for LABEL, OPCODE,
OPERAND but some form of correct
syntax needs to be followed. In general
the syntax would be one of:
LABEL OPCODE OPERAND;
LABEL
OPCODE;
OPCODE OPERAND,
Note that if a label is not followed
by an opcode then a comment (1) is
expected. A comment can be used in
any available ﬁeld. A space is needed
in between the 'ﬁelds', and where
applicable quotes must be set out in
the text correctly,
eg):
10 LDA 1 0  ! space between LDA
and 1 0
20 LABEL ! a comment is needed i f
no following opcode
30 DINCLUDE "name" ! opening and
closing quotes needed,

used for speed, so be careful when using this
option. Any labels previously deﬁned before a
symbol table is loaded are not checked for re-
deﬁned errors, in this case the ﬁrst reference in
the table is used. Any subsequent re-deﬁned
errors are issued when deﬁning labels outside
of this directive.

decimal. More than one origin can be
stated in the source, but only the last
one can be used in the direct object
save command in the editor.
The 3 Passes
A three pass assembler has been
incorporated i n  o rd e r f o r  t h e
assembler to be more versatile, this is
especially true in the case of forward
referencing, eg) in equate lines. To
show this a small source ﬁle to pass
values from label to label is shown.

warm start by either pressing RES-
TORE after a cold start, or a direct
command of SYS 28215, you will be
presented with a prompt ( 
-
 this
is the editor command mode, and is
where you type in the editor com-
mands listed in the table below. These
allow you to operate various features
of the assembler eg) assembling and
maintaining source ﬁles. A  complete
summary o f  the editor commands
available, and general syntax follows.
Each command is called up by entering
a single stroke command letter. Any
arguments used in the commands are
separated from the command letter by
a single space. Each argument thereaf-
ter is separated by a comma.

Editor Commands Summary
A
SYNTAX/ ARGUMENTS ni a
Will assemble the source ﬁle in
memory. During assembly pressing
RUN/ STOP will abort to the com-
mand level. Upon aborting the line at
which assembly was aborted will be
displayed, and i f applicable the ﬁle
which it was reading at the time, this
is also true for any error reports during
assembly time.
If any ﬁles are read into the
assembler during assembly including,
and reading, macro deﬁnitions then
the disk status will be displayed to
signify that data is being read in from
disk instead of memory.
This is shown on screen by two
sprites in the shape of disks, the left-
most one will change colour only on
the reading of a new ﬁle, so i f more
than one ﬁle is to be included in the
source for example, then the ﬁrst ﬁle
"ﬁlename"
show as a white sprite (colour I),
the second ﬁle when being read will
show as a red sprite, etc, this is the
same on all passes as the colours are
automatically reset,
The right-most disk-sprite will
ﬂash to show that data is being read
in externally.
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS nla
This command exits back to Basic,
or from the return destination i f
another program calls the assembler
SYNTAX/ ARGUMENTS a
Causes a listing to screen o f the
disk directory, without corrupting the
basic program, as is the case of the
LOAD "$",8 command from Basic.
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS Any valid
expression
Following this command you can
evaluate any expression that can be
used inside the assembler, this includes
all the valid operators, and pre-deﬁned
symbols from the current symbol
table.

SYNTAX/ ARGUMENTS string to
ﬁnd (no quotes needed)
Finds any occurence of the given
string in the current edited source ﬁle.
The strings that are found will be
shown by their relevant line numbers.
Pressing RUN/STOP at any time
aborts from this mode.
0
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS P r e -
deﬁned RUN value from source
Goes to the address speciﬁed by
the RUN directive. A  new assembly
resets to a no-run mode, only a new
RUN value which is given whilst
assembly takes place will allow this
command to operate.
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS n/ a
This command displays a summary
of this set of command-letters.
SYNTAX,ARGLTMENTS "ﬁlename"
Saves the last object code with
start, and end addresses taken from
the orign (*) - this only applies to the
last origin used, if there has been more
than one value given as: *
S Y N T A X /  A R G U M E N T S
"ﬁlename"
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS l i n e
number (no value , start of ﬁle)
Lists to screen the current source
ﬁle, from the line speciﬁed.
SYNTAX/ ARGUMENTS n/ a
Lists the present macro library.
Once this command is issued a direc-
tory of the macro-deﬁnitions currently
in the macro library is given one
ﬁlename at a time.
After each name is displayed the
keyboard is polled for a key press,
pressing 'L' at this point lists out the
macro in its expanded form, whilst any
other key brings up the next ﬁle in
the macro directory. When all of the
macro directory has been displayed the
number of spare bytes in the macro
library is given, note that such space
wasters as comment lines are deleted
in order to compect the data given to
the macro library as much as possible.
SYNTAX/ ARGU MENTS
Appends a source ﬁle, once loaded
the ﬁle is automatically renumbered.
0
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS n/a
OLD -  brings back a previously
NEW'd program, or one erased after
a reset
Q
SYNTAX/ A RGUMENTS
"ﬁlename"
Saves out a copy of the current
symbol table for use with the SY M
directive to  cross-reference between
ﬁles. It is also useful if a debugger was
to be written for the system to take
advantage of symbolic output.
SYNTAX ARGUMENTS start line,
step
Renumbers a ﬁle with the given
start, and line step values
As the I command, but saves from
the addresses taken from the LOAD
directive.
SYNTAX/ ARGUMENTS
"ﬁlename"
Lists a source ﬁle directly from disk
to the screen, no memory is used, and
therefore the current source ﬁle is not
over-written.
LI
SYNTAX/ARGUMENTS start line,
step
Jumps into Basic, with an auto-line
numbering entry enabled. The start
line, and step are given, and after each
press of RETURN the next line for
editing is displayed, entering a null-
line exits from the AU TO mode.
Jumping back via a warm start will
bring you back to the command mode.

SYNTAX/ ARGUMENTS n/ a
All the features of the 1541 DOS
have been incorporated into the
assembler. Once in this mode you will
see the prompt 'DOS' to let you know
that you are in DOS support mode.
Following this is the usual prompt,
typing any normal DOS command in
at this sgage eg. NEWO: ANYDISK,
64 to format a disk would be accepted,
the error channel is automatically
displayed after any command. I f
RETURN is pressed the error channel
will be displayed and updated, pressing
'X' will exit back to the main editor.
Labels
A label o r  symbol i n  the macro
assembler can be o f 2 forms, ﬁrstly
it can be deﬁned as a constant by using
the symbol:
10 RESET z 64738 ! 16 bit constant
20 ZEROPAGE = 10 ! 8 bit constant
It can also refer to a location in
the source ﬁle to be jumped to  or
operated upon in some way:
10 LABEL ! location within the source
ﬁle
20 BEQ PANEL branch to it
30 COUNT BYT 0 ! holds an 8 bit
number
40 COUNTHI WOR 0 ! deﬁne as word
(16 bit)
50 L D A COUNTHI l o  byte o f
COUNTHI
Labels which have not correctly
been given a value will be sufﬁxed with
an "*" in the symbol table.
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
Storing Object Code
The directive L OAD  is extremely
useful when the address that you want
to store your code at is inaccessible
with the assembler present. For exam-
ple if you wish to run a routine from
the default screen address (1024), any
data that is POKEd to it would o f
course be over-written by on-screen
messages before you have time to save
it. You would therefore store it at a
suitable area o f RAM, eg). LOAD
$C000, but give the origin address as
*=1024, you could then signify a
relocatable load address of 1024.
Note that the LOAD directive is
needed AFTER the *  is set, if the *
is given after a LOAD then the origin
will over-ride the LOAD, and store
data from the base of the origin,
eg), =  $2000 ! Labels and jumps will
take values from here
LOAD $C000 ! but code will be stored
from $C000 onwards
(Note the above order)
When assembly has been success-
fuly completed the object code start
and end addresses will be displayed,
and if a LOAD directive has been used,
then the storage address will also be
shown. The execution address will also
be displayed i f RUN command has
been used.
In the following text the 'TOP
LEVEL SOURCE' ﬁle relates to the
ﬁle actually i n  the Basic editors
memory.
Using DINCLUDE and
DEFINE
If including (DINCLUDE) or reading
in a macro deﬁnition (i) you must use
the command within the TOP LEVEL
SOURCE ﬁle, therefore all included
ﬁles must not try to include a ﬁle from
inside itself. Similarly, they should not
try to deﬁne a macro deﬁnition (E),
ie. D IN C L U D E and M A C R O -
NAME directives cannot be used in
a ﬁle that already been included with
the DINCLUDE directive itself.
If an attempt is made to do the
above, then a 'NESTED' error will be
issued. The errors are 'NESTED
INCLUDE' when an include uses a
'DINCLUDE' d i r e c ti v e , a n d
'NESTED I N C L U D E /  MACRO'
when a macro deﬁnition is used within
an included ﬁle.
Extending/Larger
Source Files
At sometime during writing source
ﬁles you will appear to have used up
all available source ﬁle memory. To
get around this, two pseudo-opcodes
have been used to chain or link more
than one ﬁle together for continuous
asembly.
LINK "ﬁlename" is used to chain the
next ﬁle for assembly, while symbols
are still retained from the previous ﬁle
RELINK "ﬁlename" is used to restart
from the ﬁrst ﬁle in the link for the
next pass, there is no limit on the
number of ﬁles linked, only on the
symbol table space that is used up, and
the 'physical' address being poked to.
LINKing reads the whole ﬁle into
the editor workspace completely
overwriting the previously edited ﬁle.
The only advantage over including
directly from disk is that ﬁles can be
read into the workspace much faster.
It also allows some form of com-
patability with the L N K command
found o n  Supersoft's M I K  RO
assembler.
A more powerful command is the
DINCLUDE directive which allows
direct including from disk. It is another
way of assembling an expanded source
ﬁle by allowing more than one ﬁle to
be assembled as in the LINK com-
mand. But it has the added advantage
of not overwriting the source ﬁle
currently in memory, this allows you
to store you object code i n  more
available memory which the included
source ﬁle would have been occupying
if it were read into the editors works-
pace as a complete edited ﬁle.
Using Macros
MACRO DEFINITIONS
A MACRO DEFINITION is stored
as a single source ﬁle on disk, and each
is loaded in separately to make up the
MACRO LIBRARY_ A  MAC R O
LIBRARY is used to give details of
what the current macro library holds.
Macro deﬁnitions consists of any
portion of a source ﬁle that you only
have to  write once — as a  macro
deﬁnition a n d  a 'call' to that macro
will expand it to a totally relocatable
part of the main source ﬁle.
Therefore if you need to keep using
the inst;ructions CLC, L D X  $ 1 0 ,
LDY# SIO, JSR SEFF0 to set the
cursor coordinates to  (10,10) i t is

rather time consuming, and a waste
of source ﬁle space to keep keying in
the same code. Instead you could
deﬁne it as a macro deﬁnition called
CENTRE -  to achieve this type the
commands as you would a normal
source ﬁle, and save the ﬁle with SAVE
"CENTRE",8.
Each time you wish to use the given
instructions instead of typing out the
same code you can 'call up' or 'invoke'
the macro 'CENTRE' and the instruc-
tions L D X  # $10, L D Y #$ 10, JSR
SEFF0 will be generated into your
source ﬁle. See the section on how to
invoke the macro ﬁles, and add them
to the macro library.
Added Macro Features
A couple of features are included to
make the macro deﬁnitions more
meaningful. The ﬁrst feature is to allow
true parameter passing upon invoking
a macro.
parameter Passing i n  a
Macro Deﬁnition
The macro deﬁnitions can accept
parameters by using the '  character
to preceed a  parameter number
between 0 and 9.
eg) LDA /  0
STA/ I
in the macro deﬁnition would change
/0 into the text passed by parameter
0, and / 1 with parameter 1.
See the section on macro invoka-
tion for more details of how to pass
parameters within macros.
Localised Symbols
All labels within a macro deﬁnition
will be read in as a local symbol, this
is achieved by adding a unique 2-digit
code to the symbol within the deﬁni-
tion. e.g. the symbol LABEL! within
a macro deﬁnition will be given as
ABLABEL I on the ﬁrst 'call' to the
macro, ACLABEL I the next time, etc,
this is so that the symbol LABEL' is
not redeﬁned everytime a macro is
invoked, and also direct references can
be given to labels within individual
macros.
Every reference within the macro
deﬁnition to  a  label automatically
refers to one within a particular macro
(a local reference). If you wish to refer
to a label outside of the current macro
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
deﬁnition you must signify that it is
a global reference -  this is achieved
by preﬁxing the label with a full stop.
The following is the source inside
a macro deﬁnition:
BEQ LOOP !  refers to  the label
'LOOP' inside the current macro
deﬁnition.
JMP .MAIN  !  refers to  the label
'MAIN' outside of the current macro
deﬁnition.
Adding a  Macro Deﬁnition to the
Macro Library
In order to invoke any macro it must
ﬁrst be stored within the macro library.
A previously saved macro deﬁnition
can be added to the library by preﬁxing
the macro name with a E, symbol:
10 EMACRONAME
Note that there is no space between
E and the ﬁlename. The macro deﬁ-
nition must be given to the macro
library BEFORE it is invoked.
Listing the Files in the Macro Library
To summarise what macro deﬁnitions

Invoking Macros
This is the term used to expand the
macro deﬁnitions into the source ﬁle.
Once a  macro deﬁnition has been
stored in the macro library it can be
invoked in the source ﬁle by using the
symbol to  preceed the macro
ﬁlename to be invoked.
10 imachroname ! adds the macro to
the macro library
20 macroname ! invokes (expands) the
macro
Parameter Passing During Macro
Invocation
The macros to be expanded can be
called u p  with parameters as dis-
ucussed i n  the section o n  macro
deﬁnitions.
To invoke the following macro
deﬁnition:
10 LDAtt/ 10
20 STA/ 1
Save i t  t o  disk w i th  S A V E
"POKE, MAC",8
The above example is to deﬁne a
rather simple POKE x,y type of macro
deﬁnition but servies its purpose. Once
it is saved type NEW to clear the
current source ﬁle and type in the
following:
10 *$C000 ! sets origin
20 f.POKE.MAC ! gives deﬁnition to
macro library
30 POKE.MAC 5,53280 ! pass the
poke value, address
40 RTS
It can be seen that parameter 0 is
5 (the source will now contain LDA
5), and parameter I is 53280 (source
contains STA 53280)
A parameter can take any form
whatsoever, °Nodes; varius operands,
or any valid expression. Each parame-
ter is separated by a comma w s o  if
you are passing text, as in "HELLO,
MY NAME IS" the comma would tell
the assembler that it is the end of that
parameter so be careful!
The number o f parameters allo-
cated to a parﬁcular macri as 10 (0-
9), however more than this is allowed
if ASCII codes which follow "0"-"9"
are given, but 0-9 should be used as
standard. Because all labels within a
macro deﬁnition are operated on as
localised, any parameter passed to it
will need to preﬁxed with a full stop
if they refer to a global label outside
of the deﬁnition.
Example of a Top Level Source File
10 RED = 2 ! global label outside of
a macro deﬁnition
20 C O L O U R  .RED ! preﬁx with
a a s  we are using the global label
RED within the macro deﬁnition.
You will he told if you try to invoke
a macro that is not present in the
macro library. I f  a  parameter is
required by a macro deﬁnition and one
isn't g i ve n  o n  invoking i t ,  a
'PARAMETER MISSING' error will
be issued. This is because no comma
will be looked for (as it is param.0)
and data that was expected to be in
the buffer will be used. The above is
of course a rarity, but worthwhile to
mention. Any parameter given to a
particular macro deﬁnition will only
be veriﬁed once it has been expanded
into the source ﬁle.

Where to Invoke Macros
You cannot 'nest' a macro, ie. call a
macro from within a macro deﬁnition
- i f you do a 'NESTED MACRO
CALL' error will be given. It is possible
to invoke a  macro deﬁnition from
within an included ﬁle. I f  an error
occurs when invoking a macro, the line
of the invocation will be shown. But
the text given will be from the offend-
ing syntax from within the macro ﬁle.
At this point a comment symbol will
appear preceeding the text, it is not
a "bug", but the way in which the
assembler handles the data from inside
a macro. I  just thought that I'd
mention it!
Error Messages and Reports
There is a comprehensive set of error
messages which are detailed below. In
each case they are used when a direct
command is issued, or when an error
is found during assembly, in this case
the offending line number is shown
together with the ﬁle i n  which i t
occured. The error messages comprise
of an error number, along with a
summary of the error.
00 IN VAL ID  C OMMAN D  -  A n
invalid command has been typed in
at the command level. Use the 'H '
command to  see a summary o f the
editor commands available.
01 INVALID HEX DIGIT - A digit
has been used after the '$' which is
not in the range 0-F, or t:
number o f hex digits has not been
used.
03 NO OPCODE PRESENT - A line
is found to have no opcode or directive
to work with.
03 LABEL REDEFINED - A  label
has been deﬁned more than once in
the same source ﬁle.
04 I L L E G A L  A D D R E S S IN G
MODE - There has been an attempt
to use a 6510 instruction that is in the
incorrect context. Eg. LDA (SOC), X
will produce this error.
05 NOT ZERO PAGE -  A  16 bit
number has been used where an 8-bit
expression was expected, for example
in immediate addressing mode, or in
the BYT directive.
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
06 LABEL UNDEFINED - There is
found to be a reference to a label that
you have not deﬁned.
07 INVALID INDEX -  An  index
letter othat then X or Y has been used.
LDA $FB,Z will produce this error.
08 BRANCH TOO FAR - A relative
branc has been used which exceeds the
relative (-128,1+127) byte limit.
09 UNDEFINED MACRO CALL -
The macroname is trying to invoke
a macro that has not been deﬁned
using the f, syntax.
10 MACRO PARAMETER MISS-
ING - A pre-deﬁned macro deﬁnition
is expecting a parameter to be passed
to it when invoking it.
11 FILENAME NOT FOUND/ I/O
ERROR - This is the general failure
of a command which reads data from
a storage device. If the ﬁle is not found
you will be told, and when you have
inserted the correct disk any key will
allow the load operation to continue.
Pressing RUN/STOP will abort, and
give the above error message. This
allows for extremely large linked or
included ﬁles to be chained -  as they
don't have to be present on the same
disk, so you are not limited by the disk
space.
12 INVALID BINARY NUMBER -
A number following the '%' preﬁx does
not contain a full set of 8 I's or O's,
or if other characters which are not
'0' or 'I' are used.
13 DEVICE OFF LINE - The OUT
directive has selected a  device fo r
output that is not connected to the
computer, or is not switched on.
14 NESTED MACRO CALL -  A
macro that is being called or invoked
is trying to invoke a macro.
15 NESTED INCLUDE FILE - An
included ﬁle is trying to use a DIN-
INCLUDE directive within itself.
16 NESTED INCLUDE/MACRO -
An included ﬁle is trying to deﬁne a
macro withn itself ie. Ename command
inside an included ﬁle.
17 EXPRESSION OVERFLOW - An
expression is found to be over the 16-
bit range ie. (0 or) 65535.
18 SYMBOL TABLE FULL T h e
symbol table limit has been reached
- the conﬁgure program allows the
start and limit addresses to be changed
as required.
19 MACRO DIRECTORY FULL -
As above, but refers to the macro
directory.
20 MACRO LIBRARY FULL -  As
above but for the macro library.
The above example shows the
conditional statements in action. I t
gives A  = 0 i f ﬂag = true, A  = I i f
ﬂag is false.
The instructions STA 53280 and
RTS will be assembled whatever the
previous conditions permitted. I f
assembly is turned o ff any further
conditional statements must be on a
separate line from a label.
Take the following to be when the
condition is currently in no-assembly
mode.
LABEL ENDIF ! will skip this line
as LABEL is not to be deﬁned, but
the single line of END1F will work
ﬁne: le)
ENDIF ! alone is required.
On any new usage of the editors
'A' command the conditional ﬂag is
automatically set to true assembly
on.
Syntax of Expressions
When hexadecimal numbers are used
they must follow either Sxx or Sxxxx
where x is a valid hexadecimal digit.
Any other combination of hex digits
will fail any checks. Only 8 bit binary
is allowed but all 8  bits must be
speciﬁed after the '%'.
Additional Notes
Note that the assembler is set up for
disk usage from device 8. Using disk
as the medium allows the macro/
include/ SYM cmds to function. These
features o f the assembler cannot be
used with cassette. The remainder of
the assemblers functions remain intact
for cassette users. Disk commands
list from disk directory are of course
disk speciﬁc.

Editor commands which use ﬁle-
names can be used with or without the
quotes eg. S "name" will be read the
same as S name. However pseudo-
opcodes in the source ﬁle which use
ﬁlenames must be given with the open
quote, but you may skip the closing
quote.
More than one error may be found
on a line, but may be related eg. BNE
ALAB -  will give "BRANCH TOO
FAR" and also "L ABEL  UNDE-
FINED" if ALAB is not present, as
it is trying to branch to an unknown
destination.
Getting it all in
Four Basic loaders are used to POKE
in the main assembler code. These are
named BLOCK I -  BLOCK 4. RUN
each of these programs in order, and
when the message BLOCK 4 OK is
displayed enter as direct commands:
POKE 43,0: POKE 44,110: POKE
45,0: POKE 46,160: SAVE "MACRO
ASSEMBLER",8 (Cassette users read
,8 as ,1).
Now reset, and load the assembler
Thirty Eight
C611 P R O G R A M M I N G
code back with L OAD  "MACRO
ASSEMBLER",8,I (cassette ,1,1).
When READY, appears type
NEW followed b y SYS 28160 to
initialise the assembler with a  cold
start.
The conﬁgure program can be
typed in and saved as usual with SAVE
"CONFIG",8. This must have the
main assembler code present before
RUNning.

When linking from cassette, you
will be told to insert a ﬁle and press

rewinding etc. Linking from disk is
automatic.

SOURCE ﬁle is the only ﬁle in which
a DINCLUDE directive can be used.
Its function is best used to set up a
type of batch ﬁle, a small ﬁle which
'calls' the main bulk of the source, a
typical batch ﬁle could be:
10 ! TOP LEVEL SOURCE FILE
20 OUT 3 ! sends output to screen
30 SYM "KERNALSYM" ! reads
symbols for the KERNAL routines
40 LOPEN. MAC ! deﬁne a macro
called "OPEINLMAC"

Give your Expert
Cartridge a boost with
this handy routine
By It Drummond
MEMORY
RESTORER
A
users!
Have you ever tried to
back-up a program, only to ﬁnd half
way through loading it, the computer
suddenly resets or crashes?
Here is the solution to this aggra-
vating problem: Memory Restorer.
How To Use
Program the Expert as normal and
type 'N ' to  reset. Load Memory
Restorer by typing:
LOAD "MEMOR Y RESTORER"
(add ,8 for disk)
and then RUN it.
When instructed switch o ff the
Expert and press reset. Now load the
program to be copied, switch on the
Expert, press RESTORE (press ESM
if light is lit), and save as normal (type
'Z "program name").
How It Works
The 'N' command in the Expert clears
the whole memory so that its compac-
tor is as efﬁcient as possible. Unfor-
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
tunately, some programs detect this
change and cease loading. This prob-
lem can be overcome by restoring the
memory to its original power-up state
(alternate 32 byte blocks of 255 and
0).
How To Enter
Switch the computer on and off (Or
enter Expert and type 'N), and then
enter this line:
POKE 44,16 : POKE 4096,0 : NEW
This raises the bottom of the Basic
memory, so that the restorer can be
poked in below it.
Now type i n  the Basic loader
entitled 'restorer base' and RUN it.
Correct any errors, and RUN it again.
When i t is ﬁnished, you will be
asked which device you wish the
program to be saved to. Press 'I' for
tape or '2' for disk.
Well, that's it. The Restorer should
enable you to load some previously
unLOADable programs, but i t still
does not guarantee success in freezing.
If you have any problems o r
suggestions to make, please contact me
through Your commodore. or MBX
me on Compunet. (RCM).

Create your own Basic
loaders without effort
for all those data
statements
By J. Kinley
I
piece o f machine code program-
ming you've devoted many hours
of your life to writing is ﬁnally bug-
free and running beautifully. Filled
with a longing to share your creation
with your fellow man, you survey your
arsenal of machine code development
aids - editors, assemblers, loaders and
the rest. If only you had an easy
of turning your work back into a nice,
simple Basic loader that other users
could type in._
Loaderbuild is just the utility
you've been looking for. This program
will take machine code (or any other
numerical data) stored in the memory
of your CM, and turn it into a Basic
loader. This has a list o f potential
applications. Maybe you want to
submit your code to a magazine for
publication? A Loaderbuild loader is
an ideal form of presentation. Your
code will be turned into D A T A
statements, with a checksum for each
line, as an aid to anyone typing the
loader into their own machine. You
could also make use of Loaderbuild
to share your programs with a friend
who lacks your own development
facilities. Perhaps you could use it just
to keep your work i n  an easily
accessible form. For whatever reasons,
most machine code programmers
should ﬁnd Loaderbuild a useful
addition to their collection of utilities.
The listing of the "DEMO" pro-
gram is an example o f  a  loader
constructed by Loaderbuild. The start
address fo r the machine code is
automatically inserted into line 140,
and the number o f  D A TA  lines
calculated and entered into line 150.
The machine code data in question
is then written into DATA statements,
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
LOADERBUILDER
starting from line 200, with 16 items
to each line. I f  necessary, the last
DATA line is made up to full length
with zeros. Every DATA statement is
given a checksum as a guard against
typing errors if the loader is keyed into
another computer.
If you want to try "DEMO" out,
enter it into your CM then RUN it.
There will be a brief pause while the
DATA items a re  POKEd  i n to
memory, in this case from location
49152 onwards. Now use SYS 49152
to run the machine code. OK, not very
exciting, but serves to demonstrate the
idea!
Using Loaderbuild
Loaderbuild is written in Basic. No
problem if your machine code is in a
'safe' area of the computer (such as
above location 49152). However, i f
your code is in an area normally used
by Basic, then don't forget to reset top
or bottom of Basic as necessary before
letting Loaderbuild loose i n  your
machine.
In case you don't know how, the
limits of the Basic area are set using
the following POKEs:-
POKE 51, (bottom o f BASIC, low
byte)
POKE 52, (bottom of BASIC, high
byte)
POKE 55, (top of BASIC, low byte)
POKE 56, (top of BASIC, high byte)
If you make any adjustments,
follow them with a CLR to get the
computer used to the idea.
Now load 'LOADERBUILD' and
RUN it.
The program will ask you to input
start and ﬁnish addresses for the code
to be worked on. You can enter this
information in either decimal, or in
hex (preceded with the customary $
sign).
Next tell the program the name
under which the new loader is to be
stored on disk -  and that's it, the
computer does the rest.
To use your loader, reset top and
bottom o f  Basic i f  necessary (see
above), then simply LOAD i t from
disk, where it will have been saved
under the name you gave it, and RUN
in the usual way.
How Loaderbuild Works
Lines 1000-2210
The input section for start and
ﬁnish addresses, and loader name.
Calls subroutines at line 6000 to check
against invalid entries, and 7000 to
handle any input errors.
Lines 3000-3300
Sets up the Basic lines of the loader
and writes them to disk, Inserts start
address into loader, and calculated
number of DATA lines. Note variables
KL and KW These are pointers to the
start of the next line in Basic, and must
be calculated for each line. The actual
Basic lines are i n  coded D A T A
statements, starting from line 10000.
Repeated calls are made to subroutines
at 8000 (which ﬁnishes construction of
each Basic line and numbers it), and
9000 (which writes a Basic line to disk).
Lines 4000-4090
Compiles D ATA statements, 16
items to a line. Fills last line with zeros
as necessary. Calls subroutine at 5000,
which ﬁnishes construction o f  the
Basic DATA statement.
Lines 5000-5090
See 4000-4090. Calls subroutine at
9000 to write BASIC line to disk.
Lines 6000-6260
Checks start and ﬁnish addresses
for following conditions:-
Illegal characters
Entry too long
Invalid memory location
Also converts hex entries into
decimal.
Lines 7000-7080
Prints error message and waits for
a key to be pressed before continuing.
Lines 8000-8150 & Lines 9000-9050
See lines 300-3300
Lines 10000-10150
DATA statements containing
BASIC lines. A l l  keywords are i n
tokenised form, ﬂagged with #  sign.

Screen Saver

H
system remain switched o n
and unattended during a pro-
gramming session? Probably long
enough to gradually wear down the
C.R.T. (Cathode Ray Tube) in your
monitor.
During all this time the poor CRT
is getting sunburnt by the electron gun!
One solution is to  switch o ff the
monitor during such intervals. This is
not recommended due to the current
surges occuring at each switching on
or o ff which could corrupt your
program.
Here is a "soft" solution. It is a
simple interrupt driven routine devised
to limit the damage. It will "black" the
screen if the keyboard is ignored for
about one minute.
How It Works
C64 P R O G R A M M I N G
SCREEN
SAVER
Every lisoth of a second the program
checks i f a key has been pressed. I f
not, i t decrements a counter, ii the
counter has run down to zero then it
saves the border colour, sets it to black,
and "switches off" the screen. This is
done by turning o ff bit 4  location
SD011 (53265), which changes the
whole screen to the border colour.
The next time a key is pressed, the
same bit is turned back on, which
restores the screen. The saved value
of the border colour is restored too,
and the counter is reset to its starting
value, calculated for a delay of approx-
imately one minute.
The routine occupies memory from
SCFAA (53162) to SUFF
To Use It
Type in Screen Saver, and save i t
before attempting to run it because it
will destroy itself once the machine
code is poked in memory.
Before starting programming, or
loading a program, load "screen saver"
and run it. There is one little drawback,
the border colour can't be changed
once the routine is operating. Also
note that "Screen Saver" will not work
with any program which changes the
interrupt vector at $0314. Pressing
RUN-STOP/RESTORE will disable
the routine. To restart: SYS 53162.

here to save the world again"; "They're back to save the world";
the possibilities o f crummy by-lines are seemingly endless. Yes,
after ﬁve quiet years the Ghostbusters, heroes of the world's biggest-grossing
comedy ever, are back. But for Columbia Pictures, eager fork box-ofﬁce success
to mop up the worry left by a string of ﬂops, it hasn't been easy...
In 1982 Ivan Reitman (currently one o f Hollywood's hottest come .
properties after success such as 'Legal Eagles', 'Screwballs', 'Stripes', 'Animal
House' and 'Twins') pulled together 'Saturday Night L i * '  star Bill Murray,
'Blues Brothers' maestro Dan Aykroyd, talented actor/ writerldiectorl producer
Harold Ramis and Academy Award darling Sigourney 'Aliert(s)' Weaver for
a big-budget ﬁlm comedy aboutfour psychic investigators who start a rather
Ily exorcism business, Ghostbusters Inc. The ﬁ
d011ars to make, went on to gross $220 million, pretty much guaranteeing ..
a sequel in one form or another, particularly in the light of Hollywood's current
obsession with Roman numerals ('Friday 13th Part Ix', 'A Nightmare on Elm
Street. VI', 'Batman II', 'Blade Runner II' (being ﬁlmed on the 'Batman' set),
'AlienIV*(wits Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Sigourney Weaver already signed),
'Spaceballs III: The Search fo r Spaceballs II' and 'Star Wars I: The Clone
Wars' art%,all in the,pipeline). However after the worldwide furore of the ﬁrst
piepre's suCcess had died down, everything went quiet. Ex-Columbia Pictures
head David Puttnam showed a noted lack of enthusiasm for 'Ghostbusters
II', even to the point of considering making it with an all-new low-budget
cast. Putinam's much-publicised enmity with star Bill Murray, the leader of
the Ghostbusters, obviously didn't help, and it wasn't until late 1987, when
Puttnam was deposed as studio boss, that 'Ghostbusters II' cropped up again.
Puttnarn's replacement, a Hollywood power player named Dawn Steel, recalls
it as "one of the ﬁrst things we talked about" at her interview for the corporation's
presidency. Not surprising, since it was obviously crucial to the ailing studio
that the movie got made. Six ﬂops in one year (1988) - including the anticipated
smash success 'Punehline' (with Tom Hanks and 'Sally Field), which grossed
only $21 million l e f t  Columbia Pictures with a lot o f problems, both in
ﬁnancial terms and in the box-ofﬁce credibility stakes.
Despite the usual sure-ﬁre success of sequels to big movies, the sheer volume
of genre movies on the Summer market might just have left "Ghostbusters
II' comfortably proﬁtable but not, ultimately, a massive hit. Studio boss Steel
called the movie "the most important sequel in the history of Columbia Pictures"
and it's easy to see why. It was a predictable but necessary evil for the
corporation; one requiring a big investment and, therefore, a big risk. The
ﬁlm had got to be made. The formula had to be repeated, The cast and crew
from the original movie had to be involved. But how were they all going
to be got together?
The story of how it happened begins much like the plot of 'Ghostbusters
II' itself, in which the protagonists of the original have left 'busting behind
and gone back to some semblance of normal life. The same was true of most
of the east and crew from 'Ghostbusters'• u r r a y  had appeared in several

dismal ﬁlms (including 'Scrooged' in 1987) and had subsequently dropped out
of sight; Aykroyd's 'Spies Like Us', 'Doctor Detroit', 'Dragnet' and 'The Couch
Trip' were all awful; !Zunis had written, directed and/or appeared in several
teen movies, with some success; director Ivan Reitman was ﬁlming
Schwarzenegger and DeVito (tipped to be Penguin in 'Batman II') in 'Twins';
female lead Weaver was enjoying critical success herself, earning Oscar
nominations for 'Aliens', 'Gorillas in the Mist' and 'Working Girl'. The man
who brought them all together was none other than Michael Ovitx, 'the King
of Hollywood' (actually head of the famous Creative Artists Agency of Los
Angeles).
What happened at their lunchtime meeting in Jimmy's (a Beverly Hills
showbiiz restaurant) was the ﬁrst step towards making 'Ghostbusters W. As
Murray recalls, 'Walking into the meeting no-one really felt we's make the
movie. But in the course of lunch we had so many laughs and so much fun
that it became clear we'd really enjoy working together again." A year o f
deal-making later, the sequel was rolling with virtually the entire cast of its
predecessor, even down to the 'Busters' long-suffering (ex)-secretary (played
by Annie Potts) and accountant-cum-attorney (Rick Moranis). The delectable
Sigourney Weaver reprises her role as Dane, Bill Murray's on-off girlfriend
in the ﬁrst movie, since when Dana has married, had a child and divorced
and actually gets the group 'busting ghosts again when strange things start
happening to her baby boy, Oscar. She admits to being "a bit bewildered"
by her comedian co-stars, saying "It's like being put in a class with awful
boys, who spend all their time throwing spitballs and dunking your braids
into the inkwell. It's a streak of masochism for me. I just ﬁnd it wonderful."
The ﬁlm is being shot on a $30 million budget, kept low by Murray, Aykroyd,
Ramis and Reitman working for a proﬁt-share wage rather than their customary
up-front fee, an idea suggested by Reitman after testing it with Schwarzenegger
and DeVito on 'Twins'. Dawn Steel is quoted as saying that 'Ghostbusters
II' could have cost "close to $50 million" had the stars taken their wages in
advance. "We'd much rather pay a piece of the proﬁts than huge salaries,"
she says. "That way we're saying 'take the risk with us. Then we're partners.'"
Risk? Surely a sequel to a $220 million movie isn't risky? "It's pretty scary,"
Steel demurs, "because the Summer is so jammed with product" Indeed,
'Batman', 'Star Trek V' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' were all
vying for a piece of 'Ghostbusters II's audience.
Ms Steel and the others involved in the ﬁlm needn't have worried, as it
turned out. 'Ghostbusters II' opened to  a phenomenal audience reaction,
smashing all the box-ofﬁce reconds 'Indy III' had broken mere weeks before
('Batman' and 'Lethal Weapon 2' were to bust the records again only weeks
later...) At the time of writing, nearly three months before it opens on this

side of the pond, 'Ghostbusters II' has earned a cool S 100 million (which.
statistics fans, is half the entire take of 'Ghostbusters' in one twentieth of the
time), despite lukewarm reviews everywhere. Aykroyd and Ramis would again
write the script, giving themselves the unenviable task of bringing the 'busters
back with a fresh story. "None of us had ever done a sequel," Ramis says,
"although we'd had offers on virtually every ﬁlm we'd worked on. But then
we started thinking if we could come up with a concept that seemed worthy,
that really progressed us in some way, that had something new to say, then
ve'd do it." Aykryod and Ramis, along with Reitman, "played with many
different permutations of what happened to the Ghostbusters after the ﬁrst
movie, and we ﬁnally settled on something that would seem meaningful for
all of us, and that's what we pursued."
The ﬁlm opens with the four 'busters gone bust (sic), having been made
to pay for the mess they made in the ﬁrst movie. Peter Venkman (Murray)
is hosting a psychic-phenomena cable-TV show called 'Wow! People'; Ray
Stantz (Aykroyd) and Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson) are reliving their
Ghostbusting days at childrens' birthday parties; Ego Spengler (Remis) has

buried himself into his work, obsessed with his research into the effect o f
human behaviour on ectoplasmic slime, The script drags them back together
for a battle against slime and spirits revived by negative human behaviour.
To beat the spooks this time the team have to convince everyone in New
York that they have to be nice to each other for forty-eight hours, otherwise
the sticky stuff will take over the city. "The moral issue was important to
us," says Ramis. The ﬁnal showdown takes place at - where else? - the Statue
of Liberty, with 'Star Wars' effects wizards Industrial Light & Magic returning
to provide the ﬁlm with the ghosts and ghouls. Visual effects supervisor Dennis
F E A T U R E  •
Muren was asked, among other things, to come up with a river of slime and
spooks that were "interesting! In addition to being vaporous and ﬂying around,
the ghosts can change their shape easily as they move with a lot o f what
we call 'squash and' stretch." Sounds fun.
Yup, the Ghostbusters are back. A clever new symbol, some wicked-looking
new proton packs, a brilliant theme song by Bobby Brown, every bit as catchy
as Ray Parker Jr.'s 1984 smash title song, a slinky new dress for Ms. Weaver,
a souped-up new Ectomobile (the Ghostbusters' Cadillac-ambulance private
transport) with dozens of roof-lights and new computerised signboards, 100..000
gallons of slime, plus a gengeful villain in the form of Slimer all ad up to
make 'Ghostbusters II' every bit as much fun as the ﬁrst picture. And there
is no reason to suspect that this outing for the dynamic quattro will be the
last, for I'll bet that 'Ghostbusters II' will go on to make even more money
than 'Ghostbusters'. Shares in Columbia Pictures will be rocketing again, and
plastic proton packs will be appearing in toy stores all over, sending the
merchandise manufacturers' dividends up as well.

I got there in good time. "Take some photos", he said so I lugged my camera
along as well,
You can imagine the looks I got when I entered the steamy, overﬂowing
hall. As I walked past, heads turned to regard this spectacle of a man with
a camera as though I had three heads and a Nikon. I pushed my way through
the hordes of people until I could see what was happening at the front. Looking
around the overﬁlled room, I saw people, more people and more people, and
then a computer! And another, and a printer, a monitor, stacks of boxes
and even more kit than I've got at home - rather a lot.
Advancing towards a smart looking Star LC-10 printer I brushed past
a friendly chap who said that the auction was about to start in a minute
or two and I had better get myself a catalogue. He waved a vvodge of paper
at me. I  thanked him and struggled towards a seething mass o f people
congregated at the front of the hall. Joining a queue, a man with a moustache
sat himself down on a chair on the stage, cleared his throat and spoke into
a microprhone. "The sale will start in ﬁve minutes. May I remind everyone
that if you want to bid for anything in today's sale, you must register at the
front," he pointed to the queue I was standing in.
At the front, I was given a card to ﬁll in with my name and address,

for it they could track me down. The top of the slip was torn off and handed
to me. Scrawled on it was "378", my bidders number. "Are you taking photos
for anything in particular?", a man in a red jersey asked as I  requested a
catalogue. I  told him of my involvement with a certain computer magazine
as I handed over LI for the catalogue. As he noticed this he gave me the
money back and told me to enjoy myself.
The crowds had now retired to a bundle of seats directly in front of the
stage and the gangways along the sides were now more navigable. Looking
around there were benches and more benches liteally overﬂowing with computer
bits and bobs. Behind the seats were more rows of benches. On one sat various
portable computers with odds and ends hiding between, on another the odds
and ends ruled and complete machines were a minority. It soon became evident
that there were not enough benches and equipment was begining to spill over
onto the ﬂoor. Still people swarmed around virtually everything, lifting it,
shaking it, switching things on and trying them out. This kind of behaviour
is encouraged by the auctioneers so that you know exactly what you are buying
and wheter it works or not. You have no come back on the equipment, and
everything is sold "as is".
10:30am and the sale began with lot one, a set of IBM guide to operations
software. My initial reaction was, who the hell wants that, but it soon became
apparent that quite a few people did. Lots two to ten were the same as lot
one and by the time the last one was sold the price had dropped considerably.
Next came three lots of IBM BASIC software which gathered little interest.
The ﬁrst 40 items in the sale were all software, and the ﬁrst bit of hardware
was a IBM AT compatible mouse -  whoopedo! As I leaned against a wall,
with no prospect of sitting down for a good two hours, I thought just how
boring this experience could be. I scanned the 13 pages of the catalogue and
discovered, to my horror, that there were 1203 lots on sale that day, with
many additionals on separate sheet which I  pick
30 odd lots had been sold and I was not looking forward to the prospect
of staying for the rest of the day.
At the bottom of the ﬁrst page were lots 65 to 104 which were a collection
of various D-RAM chips. These came and went at ridiculously low prices
considering the current value -  nine 256K chips for just £28. Turning the
page, I  scanned down through the list of things and found myself ticking
off items which I was interested in. "Lot 119 is a new Amstrad PC1640 system
with 20MB hard drive and ECD monitor. Who will bid E600?" No takers.
"t500" those sitting began to ﬁdget but no bids were made. "f400" the
auctioneer's voice took on that "stingy sods" tone. Getting fed up with the
inactive audience he reduced the price to -
mumbling and the buyers were obviously becoming interested. I heard someone
close to me say "If it goes to £200 I'll have it." -  me too I thought, and
it did, "E200", the auctioneer was obviously becoming bored with this.
A hand shot high into the air, i t was mine! Then someone close by
raised his hand. "L220, do I see ,E240?“ another hand rose and the bidding
became fast and furious. I would have had better luck with an arcade coin-
op. The system was ﬁnally sold for ,C425.
Lot 146 and a Star LC-I0 printer. Bidding began at just £40 and rose
to only £95. I bidded for this too, but considered £95 just a little too much
for a whim and gave in on ths too. By the time lot 148 came up - a NEC
P6 24-pin - I was in the swing of things and really begining to enjoy myself.
At the end o f the day I came home with 30 blank 3.5 inch discs, these
cost just £6 per ten, a telephone, Psion Organiser II, an Atari 8-bit cassette
recorder - I  only paid £3 for this so me  printer ribbons and a steel under-
desk keyboard shelf.
The auction I  attended was organised by John Russell & Co. who are
based in Croydon, Surrey. However, there are various other companies around
the country who organise computer auctions, the more notable ones are listed
below, others advertise in various journals. All items in the auction, unless
stated otherwise in the catalogue, are subject to VAT which is added to your
bill.
The auction turned Out to be great fun, I came away wanting to go to
the next one - so I'm off this Saturday to Mitcham and to the next auction.
I probably won't buy anything, but it's fun all the same. It's interesting to
talk to different people, and many bidders are regulars so you can make new
friends and enjoy your hobby that little bit more. A n

THE
HYPE
1
 989 started with the comic industry reeling from the success achieved
by The Watchmen and Dark Knight and the world gearing itself up for
the arrival of BATMAN.
Of course by this time you're all quite sick of reading about Batman!
Bathype and the great Bat yawn in general, but no round-up of last year would
be complete without it. And, I'm afraid, a little scene setting is in order before
we get to know each other better.
Bathype was an exercise in damage limitation and image control rivalling
Chinese efforts post-Tiananmen Square. The message Batman h  coming
penetrated right to the depths of our consumer hearts. By August I Ith, the
only licensed image you could buy of a character ﬁfty years old were those
that came directly from Tim Burton's ﬁlm. Firstly, Robin was killed of a
in a perfunctory little epic called A Death In The Family (DC), that grabbed
world headlines. Fifty years of teen icon were buried in a howl of commercial
anguish. "What are we gonna do with all these luncboxes with Robin on them
now?" cried more than one distraught DC exec.
Warner insisted that anything that contradicted their desired 'R' rated
Batman should be witheld from the schedules; thus Grant Morrison/Dave
McKean's Arkham Asylum, wherein the lunatics - the Joker, Two Face, the
Penguin et al -  take over, was pulled and censored, ﬁnally released when
the video was safely in the corner shop. Alas, we shall never see Morrison's
interpretation of The Joker, complete with stilletos, stockings and Madonna-
like basque - lost forever to the demands of marketing and the sensitive American

palate. However, enough did escape the censors to make this the only Bat
artifact worth having.
Finally, Warners instructed by law suit and copyright that there were to
be no images that contradicted the greater Warner way; ie. anything that let
you in on the fact that Batman was something over 5'3, and the Joker something
less than 14 stone.
And the movie? Who really cared that it was only a partial success (and
a large part of that being Jack Nicholson) when everyone made such a killing?
When the party's over
Bathype did have one positive effect, along the way the message gradually
became Comics Are Coming. New comics for a new age. Some serious fun.
Fleetway publishers of 2000 AD, were ﬁrst off the mark with Crisis, but
this was about as hip as The Tin Machine until the introduction of Milligan!
McCarthy's Skin, As far as the UK went, the year really went to Deadline
with its electric mix of girls, guns and kind hearts. The world's ﬁrst dance
comic, brought us Tank Girl and a host of original, young, cartoonists that
literally exploded off the page.
We might also have traced a little of the Crisis Band Aids, in Alan Moore
and Bill Sinkiewicz's Brought To Light, except this was a harrowing tale that
counted the cost of American foreign policy in swimming pools of blood.
Deﬁnitely a highlight of last year. As was the ﬁrst part of Moore's From
Hell serialised in the horror anthology Tabboo (Spider Baby Graﬁx) a scalpel-
like examination of Ripper mythology.
Other delights of last year were to be found in the resurgence of independent
publishing in this country. Like the independent record companies, these
independents can go into unexplored areas with an enthusiasm and energy
that big companies with their unwieldy corporate structures can't hope to match.
Downside, a soap opera set in a future East End council estate, and Velocity,
a withering satire drawn from the junk culture are but two to watch out for.
On the other side of the pond, Love and Rockets (Fantagraphics Books)
by Gilbert and Jame Hernandez, continued to lead the way with its gently
surreal soaps set in the barrios of Los Angeles, and the mythical Mexican
village of Palomar. Meanwhile America continued to snap up the best of British
talent; Jamie Delano's Hel'blazer (DC) drew its horror from the nightmare
of the Thatcher decade, and Kevin O'Neill and Pat Mill's Marshal Law (Epic)
gave a ﬁnal slashing to the rotten core of the superhero.
The year ended on a high for me with the discovery of Munoz and Sampayo's
Sinner (Fantagraphics Books), a comic that fuse Hollywood noire with 50's
expressionism, to examine the human heart.
1989; there was more to life than Batman.

Rik Henderson, the man
with an enormous
wobbly dictaphone,
visits Britain's latest
tourist attraction, the
Rock Circus
Above and right: Jerry Lee Lewis and Art
Garfunkel.
FEATURE 1
I
were going strong in the charts, the parties were fantastic. Bob was there,
so was Jimi, and Janis made a short appearance before we were all locked
up. You should have seen the papers, oh how we chortled.
Unfortunately the imagination can get somewhat wild, and scenes like this
live only in the mind of a humble journo, like myself. Bob Marley, Jimi Hendrix
and Janis Joplin are sadly deceased, so to come face to face with them is
something only Burke and Hare could do. Rock Circus, however, exists to
recﬁty this fact, and allows you to come within breathing distance of exact
replicas of gone, but not forgotten, stars.
•
on the 7th August 1989, is part of the Tussauds Group of tourist attractions
(hest known for their Madame Tussaud's and London Planetarium). And it
is easy to see where the inspiration has stemmed from. It features many waxworks
of the most famous of the rock stars, and could be likened to the Chamber
of Horrors, with the genre being the major change.
Upon entrance visitors are supplied with headsets. These pieces of equipment
allow wearers to hear only the sound emitting from the area designated to
a particular exhibit. This is done via infra red signals that are picked up by
the headset and converted into sound. Unfortunately this provokes one small
problem which I discovered, if your headset is slightly off-line the beam will
not be picked up, and therefore no sound will be heard. This is rectiﬁed by
a small adjustment in head angle, so it's not a major worry.

It would be nigh-on impossible to include every intluencial rock star from
the 40s-90s, but Rock Circus has had specialist help from Paul Gambaccini
in choosing the ones that would best represent the industry. Some of the stand-
alone exhibits are very well thought-out indeed.
In the centre of the lower ﬂoor (there being three ﬂoors in total) there
is a large revolving stage with Elton John, Stevie Wonder, and Little Richard,
all playing pianos, and in the centre, at the end of the 7 minute show, appears
Elvis Presley in all his splendor (with hamburger ﬁlled stomach and all). And
all around the edges, and on the second ﬂoor, are smaller scenes.
It is the ﬁnal show that is deﬁnitely the most worth seeing as it is situated
in the largest revolving theatre in Europe, and it features audio animatronie
ﬁgures (much like certain Group Editors). These are bionic ﬁgures that are
controlled by a whapping great computer system. Unfortunately, although the
show is very good indeed (especially when the volume on your headset is
turn up to full blast), the bionic stars sometimes act in a way not too disimilar
to a Gerry Anderson creation. But all said and done, it is quite spooky to
see models that move in time to music; and in an elaborate way too.
Not so much an education, not so much a feature of excitement, more
a cross between the two, Rock Circus cost LIO million to erect and can be
yours for a few hours for only E4.20 (E3.15 for children and concessions).
Worthwhile, yes; revolutionary, probably!

READERS OFFER
Do you wish that more
C16 & Plus/4 programs
were available on disk
and cassette? Well
here's your chance to
purchase every program
we have ever published.
C16 & Plus/4
Software Offer
D
ue to the length and complexity of the programs that are printed in
Your Commodore, many people ﬁnd that once they have typed them
in they do not work. Usually, this is not the fault of the magazine,
but rather, due to the program being typed in incorrectly.
To help readers we do provide a Software for Sale service where the programs
from several issues of Your Commodore are supplied on a single tape or disk.
There have been four such compilations so far and we have now added a
ﬁfth, containing all the most recent published programs.
C16 and Memory Expansion
The CI6 and Plus/4 computers are almost identical, except for the fact that
the CI6 has far less memory than its big brother, the Plus/ 4. This compatibility
means that programs for one of these computers will work on the other, as
long as enough memory is available. The exception to this being programs
that access the in-built software of the Plus/ 4, for example, the TRANSCRIPT
program on the C I6C compilation.
How much is the Software?
The price of the software is £5.00 for cassette and E7.00 for disk, this includes
instructions. Orders should be sent to the address on the order form for Readers
Services.
Orders should be accompanied by a cheque or postal order for the correct
amount made payable to Argus Specialist Publications.
We welcome orders from overseas readers. However, we do have to add
a further £1.00 in order to cover the increased postal charges.
