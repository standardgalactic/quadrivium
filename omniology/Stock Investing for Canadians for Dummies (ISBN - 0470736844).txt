About the Authors
Andrew Dagys, CMA, is a best-selling author who has written and co-
authored several books, including Investing Online For Canadians For 
Dummies (CDG Books Canada, 2000; Wiley, 2001) and The Financial Planner 
For 50+ (Prentice Hall, 2000). Andrew has contributed columns to Canadian 
Living, Forever Young, and other publications. He has appeared on Canada 
AM and several popular CBC broadcasts to offer his insights on the Canadian 
and world investment landscapes.
An avid investor, Andrew uses online resources to advantage to identify com­
pelling investment opportunities. For years, his business, The Treetop Group, 
has helped match some of those opportunities with the financial needs of 
his Canadian clients. Andrew also enjoys speaking to business and general 
audiences about the latest investment trends, always in the context of cur­
rent world realities, and about new developments in high technology that can 
empower Canadians to enhance their lifestyles. He lives in Toronto with his 
wife, Dawn-Ava, and their three children — Brendan, Megan, and Jordan.
Andrew looks forward to your comments and can be reached at

through popular national seminars such as “The $50 Wealthbuilder” and 
“Stock Investing Like a Pro.” Paul has been quoted or referenced by many 
media outlets, including Bloomberg, MarketWatch, Comcast, CNBC, and a

he has written the books The Unofficial Guide to Picking Stocks (Wiley, 2000) 
and Zero-Cost Marketing (Todd Publications, 1995). In recent years, Paul accu­
rately forecast many economic events, such as the rise of gold, the decline

Dedication
Andrew dedicates this book to his supportive wife, Dawn-Ava, and their won­
derful children — Brendan, Megan, and Jordan. He thanks God for them all. 
He commends those Canadians who have the courage to invest wisely in the 
face of a challenging and rapidly changing world.
Paul dedicates this book to his beloved Fran, Adam, and Joshua and his 
loving, supportive family — he thanks God for you. He also dedicates this 
book to the millions of investors who deserve more knowledge and informa­
tion to achieve lasting prosperity.

Authors’ Acknowledgements
Once again, Andrew thanks his editor, Robert Hickey, who gave him the 
opportunity to write this book. More important, Robert was instrumental 
through his dedication to excellence in making this book even stronger than 
the previous edition. Andrew also thanks his copy editor, Kelli Howey, for her 
fantastic editorial work. She navigated through a significant amount of new 
material and provided thoughtful insights and creative recommendations. 
Alanna McCracken provided a thorough technical review, ensuring that all 
information in the book was accurate and current.
Andrew appreciates the efforts and contributions of Lindsay Humphreys, 
Project Editor. She kept the project moving along. Additional thanks go to all 
of the dedicated people at Wiley Canada who work hard behind the scenes.
Finally, Andrew thanks Robert Harris, with whom he has had a long-standing 
and highly enjoyable business relationship. He especially thanks Robert for 
allowing him the privilege of entering the world of writing in Canada.
Paul thanks Georgette Beatty, his project editor, who has guided him from 
day one. Her patience, professionalism, and guidance have kept him sane and 
productive. Todd Lothery, Paul’s copy editor, is a pro who took Paul’s bundle 
of words and turned them into worthy messages.
Paul’s technical editor, Juli Erhart-Graves, is a great financial pro whom he 
appreciates. She made sure his logic is sound and his facts are straight.
Paul’s gratitude again goes out to his fantastic acquisitions editor, Stacy 
Kennedy, for making this thir3rd edition happen. For Dummies books don’t 
magically appear at the bookstore; they happen because of the foresight and 
efforts of people like Stacy. Wiley is fortunate to have her (and the others 
also mentioned)!
Fran, Lipa Zyenska, Paul appreciates your great support during the writing 
and updating of this book. It’s not always easy dealing with the world, but 
with you by his side, he knows that God has indeed blessed him. Te amo!
Lastly, Andrew and Paul want to acknowledge you, the reader. Over the 
years, you’ve made the For Dummies books what they are today. Your devo­
tion to these wonderful books helped build a foundation that played a big 
part in the creation of this book and many more yet to come. Thank you!

Introduction
S
tock Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition, has been an 
honour for us to write. We are grateful we can share our thoughts, infor­
mation, and experience with such a large and devoted group of Canadian 
readers.
This edition is our most important one so far because so much change, 
volatility, and uncertainty have become part of today’s stock market. It’s not 
your grandparents’ stock market anymore! Recently, all too many well-known 
stocks have ceased to exist — including the “safe” stocks your grandma and 
grandpa used to buy — because the companies behind those stocks went 
bankrupt. You know many of the names because they featured prominently 
in 2009’s headlines.
In today’s world landscape, the opportunities for great gains (and even 
greater losses) have reached an extreme. In some ways, our current market 
reminds us of Dickens’ famous novel opener: “It was the best of times, it was 
the worst of times . . .” In terms of what faces us now — economic uncer­
tainty, terrorism, war, political instability, rising inflation, persistent unem­
ployment, and so on — these seem like the worst of times. Yet when we think 
of the tools, strategies, and investing vehicles available for you to build (and 
protect) wealth, it’s clear these can be the best of times.
At the time of this writing, we still do not know in which direction the stock 
market will likely go. We never really do. As you see in this book, stock mar­
kets march to the beat of many drums, including economic ones. No one 
knows when we will truly emerge from the Great Recession that sank the 
stock market to a painful low in March 2009. If we have already emerged, 
then any Canadian who invested near those 2009 lows has likely done very 
well since then, and everyone can still benefit from a rising stock market. 
However, if the rebound in the Canadian and world economy was just a head 
fake — or if terrorism, political strife, or other nerve-fraying world events 
arise to undermine economic recovery — then expect the stock markets to 
dip again, perhaps even re-testing the low levels we’ve already experienced.
What can or should Canadian stock investors do? Like with so many of life’s 
lessons, being successful at stock investing takes diligent effort, experience, 
and knowledge. Even if you suffer an unfortunate loss in the stock market, 
that in itself affords a valuable learning experience — but only if you under­
stand why the loss occurred in the first place. We can definitely help you 

2
Stock Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
understand stock investing fundamentals, and help you avoid some of the big 
mistakes others have already made. We can also help you better understand 
and hopefully not repeat any past stock investing mistakes you yourself may 
have made. It is our pleasure and purpose to help you succeed!
In the face of all of this uncertainty, today’s most effective stock investors 
will be those who are nimble, prepared to make quick decisions, and per­
ceptive to changes that are relevant to stock investing. This book helps you 
get to that state, and shows you how to make important connections to the 
events and drivers that move stocks in one direction or another. In all the 
years that we’ve counselled and educated investors, the single difference 
between success and failure, between gain and loss, boils down to one word: 
knowledge. Welcome to this book — and welcome to the intriguing and excit­
ing world of stock investing!
About This Book
The stock market has been a cornerstone of the Canadian investor’s pas­
sive wealth-building program for more than a century and continues in this 
role. This decade has been one wild roller-coaster ride for stock investors. 
Fortunes have been made and lost. Even with all the media attention, all the 
talking heads on radio and television, and the reams of books promising great 
profits, the investing public still didn’t avoid losing trillions in a historic stock 
market debacle. Sadly, even the so-called experts who understand stocks 
didn’t see the economic and geopolitical forces that acted like a tsunami on 
the market. With just a little more knowledge and a few wealth-preserving 
techniques, more investors could have held onto their hard-earned stock 
market fortunes. Cheer up, though: This book gives you an early warning 
on those megatrends and events that will affect your stock portfolio. Other 
books may tell you about stocks, but this book tells you about stocks, what 
affects them, and other stock investing fundamentals.
This book is designed to give you a realistic approach to making money in 
stocks. It provides the essence of sound, practical stock investing strate­
gies and insights that have been market-tested and proven from nearly 100 
years of stock market history. We don’t expect you to read it cover to cover, 
although we’d be delighted if you read every word! Instead, this book is pri­
marily designed as a reference tool. Feel free to read the chapters in what­
ever order you choose. You can flip to the sections and chapters that interest 
you or those that include topics you need to know more about.
Stock Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is different from the 
“get rich with stocks” titles that have crammed the bookshelves in recent 
years. It doesn’t take a standard approach to the topic; it doesn’t assume that 
stocks are a sure thing and the be-all, end-all of wealth building. In fact, at 
times in this book, we tell you when not to invest in stocks.

3
 Introduction
This book can help you succeed not only in up markets but also in down mar­
kets. Bull markets and bear markets come and go, but the informed Canadian 
investor can keep making money no matter what. To give you an extra edge, 
we’ve included information about the investing environment for stocks. 
Whether it’s politics or hurricanes (or both), you need to know how the big 
picture affects your stock investment decisions.
Conventions Used in This Book
To make navigating through this book easier, we’ve established the following 
conventions:
	
✓	Boldface text points out keywords or the main parts of bulleted items.
	
✓	Italics highlight new terms that are defined.
	
✓	Monofont is used for Web addresses.
When this book was printed, some of the Web addresses needed to run 
across two lines of text. Note that we did not add hyphens to indicate the 
breaks; when using these Web addresses you can just type in exactly what 
you see, pretending the line break doesn’t exist.
What You Don’t Have to Read
Sidebars (grey boxes of text) in this book give you a more in-depth look at 
certain topics — they further illuminate a particular point, but aren’t crucial 
to your understanding of the rest of the book. Feel free to read the sidebars 
or skip them.
You can also pass over the text that accompanies the Technical Stuff icon 
(see the section “Icons Used in This Book”). Text associated with this icon 
gives some technical details about stock investing that are certainly interest­
ing and informative, but even if you don’t read it you will still come away with 
the information you need.
Foolish Assumptions
We figure you’ve picked up this book for one or more of the following reasons:
	
✓	You’re a beginner and want a crash course on stock investing that’s an 
easy read.

4
Stock Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
	
✓	You’re already a stock investor, and you need a book that allows you to 
read only those chapters that cover specific stock investing topics of 
interest to you.
	
✓	You need to review your own situation with the information in the book 
to see whether you missed anything when you invested in that hot stock 
your brother-in-law recommended.
	
✓	You need a great gift! When Uncle Gus is upset over his poor stock picks, 
give him this book so he can get back on his financial feet. Be sure to get 
a copy for his broker, too. (Odds are the broker was the one who made 
those picks to begin with.)
How This Book Is Organized
We’ve taken care to lay out information in a straightforward format. The 
parts progress in a logical approach that any Canadian interested in stock 
investing can follow very easily.
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing
This part is for everyone. Understanding the essentials of stock investing 
and investing in general will only help you, especially in these uncertain eco­
nomic times. Stocks may even touch your finances in ways not readily appar­
ent. For example, stocks aren’t only in individual accounts; they’re also in 
mutual funds and Canadian pension plans.
An important point is that stocks are really financial tools that are a means to 
an end. Investors should be able to answer the question, “Why am I consider­
ing stocks at all?” Stocks are a great vehicle for wealth building, but only if 
investors realize what they can accomplish and how to use them. Chapter 2 
explains how to assess your current financial situation and personal goals, 
and Chapter 3 defines common approaches to stock investing.
One essential of stock investing is recognizing and understanding risk. All 
too many Canadians ignore risk, and they do so at their peril. Chapter 4, on 
risk, is one of the most important chapters serious stock investors should 
read. You can’t avoid every type of risk out there (life itself embodies risk). 
However, this chapter can help you recognize it and find ways to minimize 
it in your stock investing program. Chapter 5 rounds out the essentials by 
showing you how stock market performance is measured.

 Introduction
Part II: Before You Invest
When you’re ready to embark on your second career as a stock investor, you 
need to use some critical resources to gather information about the stocks 
you’re interested in. Fortunately, you live in the information age. We pity the 
investors from the 1920s who didn’t have access to so many resources, but 
today’s investors are in an enviable and very empowered position. This part 
tells you where to find valuable and timely information and how to use it 
to be a more knowledgeable investor. Chapter 6 is a great starting place for 
your information gathering; we show you how to stay on top of financial news 
and read stock tables, among other topics.
When you’re ready to invest, you’ll invariably have to turn to a Canadian 
broker. Several types of brokers are out there, so know which is which. The 
wrong broker can make you . . . uh . . . broker. Chapter 7 helps you choose. 
We also explain how stocks can be used for both growth and income pur­
poses, and discuss the characteristics of each; see Chapters 8 and 9 for more 
information.
New to this edition is Chapter 10, which gives you the lowdown on how a 
grasp of basic economics can make you more successful with your stock 
investing strategy. What with the economy being front row centre in the 
media these days, we thought we’d show you how the economy ties in to 
stock investing. In Chapter 11, we also show you how politics affects the 
stock market as well as individual stocks.
Part III: Picking the Winners
Where do you turn to find specific information about a company’s financial 
health? We tell you about the financial documents to review to make a more 
informed decision. We also show you how to make sense of the data.
Looking through company financial information is critical to stock investing, 
and we clarify what financial statements really mean. One of the things some 
investors all too often fail to do is to extract the story told by these financial 
statements. Instead, they rely on others to do this homework for them — finan­
cial analysts with different agendas or levels of knowledge. Many analysts still 
fail to see instances of questionable accounting tricks that so many companies 
continue to espouse. The bottom line is that if you want it done right, learn to 
do it yourself. Read a company’s valuable financial information — it’s the key 
to picking winners! Chapters 12 to 14 take you on that journey.
Chapter 15 urges you to keep an eye on what company insiders are doing, 
and we explain what it may mean if a company’s management is buying or 
selling the same stock you’re considering. In Chapter 16, we revisit risk and 
introduce even more risks you should know about. Together, these chapters 
will help you avoid making stock investing mistakes.

6
Stock Investing For Canadians For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
We also show you in Chapter 17 how important it is to analyze industries 
before investing in individual stocks. We close out this part with Chapter 18, 
which presents for your consideration some relevant and timely emerging-
sector opportunities.
We compare buying stock to choosing goldfish — if you’re looking at a 
bunch, you want to make sure you pick the healthiest ones to buy. With 
stocks, you also need to pick companies that are healthy. Part III helps you 
do that.
Part IV: Investment Strategies
Even the stocks of great companies can fall in a bad investing environment. 
This is where it pays to be aware of the “macro” picture. If stocks were gold­
fish, the macro would be the pond or the goldfish bowl — and even healthy 
goldfish can die if the water is toxic. Therefore, monitor the investing envi­
ronment for stocks. Part IV reveals tips, strategies, and resources that you 
shouldn’t ignore.
Investing is a long-term activity but stocks can also be short-term opportuni­
ties; therefore, we discuss stock trading in Chapter 19. In Chapter 20 we pro­
vide guidance on selecting an investing strategy that’s right for your personal 
and financial situations.
You may be an investor, but that doesn’t mean you have deep pockets. 
Chapter 21 tells you how to buy stocks with low (or no) transaction costs. 
If you’re going to buy the stock anyway, why not save on commissions and 
other costs?
After you spend your time, money, and effort to grow your money in the 
world of stocks, you have yet another concern: holding on to your hard-
earned gains. This challenge is summarized in one word: taxes. Sound tax 
planning is crucial for everyone who works hard. After all, taxes are the big­
gest expense in your lifetime (right after children!). See Chapter 22 for more 
information on how the Canada Revenue Agency treats stock investing.
Part V: The Part of Tens
We wrap up the book with a hallmark of For Dummies books — the Part of 
Tens. These chapters give you a mini crash course in stock investing, includ­
ing tips on how to profit with stocks before the crowd does (Chapter 23) and 
how to protect those profits (Chapter 24). We also provide a list of ten red 
flags for stock investors (Chapter 25), along with ten challenges and opportu­
nities that face stock investors (Chapter 26).

 Introduction
Part VI: Appendixes
Don’t overlook the appendixes. We pride ourselves on these resources we pro­
vide to our students and readers so they can make informed investment deci­
sions. Whether the topic is stock investing terminology, economics, or avoiding 
capital gains taxes, we include a treasure trove of resources to help you.
In Appendix A, we explain key financial ratios. These important numbers 
help you better and more quickly determine whether to invest in a particular 
company’s stock. And whether you prefer a bookstore, the library, or the 
Internet, Appendix B gives you some great places to turn to for help.

Where to Go from Here
You may not need to read every chapter to make you more confident as 
a stock investor, so feel free to jump around to suit your personal needs. 
Because every chapter is designed to be as self-contained as possible, it 
won’t do you any harm to cherry-pick what you really want to read. But if 
you’re like us, you may still want to check out every chapter because you 
never know when you may come across a new tip or resource that will make 
a profitable difference in your stock portfolio. We want you to be successful 
so we can brag about you in the next edition!

T
he latest market turmoil and uncertainty tell investors 
to get back to square one. Your success is dependent 
on doing your homework before you invest your first dol­
lar in stocks. Most investors don’t realize that they should 
be scrutinizing their own situations and financial goals at 
least as much as they scrutinize stocks. How else can you 
know which stocks are right for you? Too many people 
risk too much simply because they don’t take stock of 
their current needs, goals, and risk tolerance before they 
invest. The chapters in this part tell you what you need to 
know to choose the stocks that best suit you.

tock investing was the hot thing during the late 1990s — a trend just like

market is a prolonged period of falling prices — in this case, stock prices). 
This decade has been a wild roller-coaster ride that saw the market hit new 
highs in 2008, although it was down in ugly fashion in 2009. During this time, 
the public figured out that stock investing isn’t for wild-eyed amateurs or 
dart-throwers (or the worst . . . wild-eyed amateur dart-throwers!).
We wrote much of this Canadian 3rd edition with current events and market 
conditions on our radar screen. The year 2009 witnessed some ominous 
events that will make stock investing very interesting (to say the least) for 
the foreseeable future. Don’t let that scare you, though; informed investors 
have made money in all sorts of markets — good, bad, and even ugly.
As we write this the jury is still out whether North America will remain in 
a low interest rate environment; or whether we’ll step into a new inflation­
ary spiral like we did in the 70s when governments printed and pumped too 
much money into the North American economy. It seems for now that today’s 
rise in money supply is being offset by deflation, thanks in part to persistent 
unemployment, offshore competition, and weak domestic economic output. 
As Canadians navigate through these new economic realities, it will become 
very important to select good stocks that can actually benefit from any given 
economic state. Recognizing the overall environment you’re investing in is 
something we’ll help you with, and it will help you preserve your nest egg 
and even make you wealthier.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
The purpose of this book is not only to tell you about the basics of stock invest­
ing, but also to let you in on some solid strategies that can help you profit from 
the stock market. But before you invest your first dollar you need to understand 
the basics of stock investing, which we introduce in this chapter.
Understanding the Basics
The basics are so basic that few people are paying much attention to them. 
Perhaps the most basic — and therefore most important — thing to grasp is 
the risk you face whenever you do anything (like putting your hard-earned 
money in an investment like a stock). When you lose track of the basics, you 
lose track of why you invested to begin with. Find out more about risk (and 
the different kinds of risk) in Chapters 4 and 16. (Yes, two chapters — under­
standing risk is that important!)
When the late comedian Henny Youngman was asked, “How is your wife?” he 
responded, “Compared to what?” This also applies to stocks. When you’re 
asked, “How is your stock?” you can very well respond that it’s doing well, 
especially when compared to an acceptable yardstick such as a stock index 
(like the TSX, or the S&P 500). Find out more about indexes in Chapter 5.
	
The bottom line in stock investing is that you shouldn’t immediately send 
your money to a brokerage account or go to a Web site and click “buy stock.” 
The first thing you should do is find out as much as you can about what stocks 
are, and how and when to use them to achieve your wealth-building goals. 
Chapters 2 and 3 help you assess your current financial situation and help you 
understand common approaches to stock investing.
Now is the time to get straight exactly what a stock is. A stock is a type of 
security that indicates ownership in a corporation and represents a claim 
on part of that corporation’s assets and earnings. The two primary types of 
stocks are common and preferred. Common stock (what we cover throughout 
this book) entitles the owner to vote at shareholders’ meetings and receive 
any dividends the company issues. Preferred stock doesn’t usually confer 
voting rights, but it does include some rights that exceed those of common 
stock. Preferred stockholders, for example, have priority in certain condi­
tions, such as receiving dividends before common stockholders in the event 
the corporation goes bankrupt or becomes insolvent.
Preparing to Buy Stocks
Gathering information is critical in your stock-investing pursuits, and is best 
done two times: before you invest, and after. Obviously, you should become 
more informed before you invest your first dollar, but you also need to stay 

13
 Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Stock Investing
informed about what’s happening to the company whose stock you buy, and 
also about the industry and the general economy. To find the best informa­
tion sources, check out Chapter 6.
	
When you’re ready to invest, you need a brokerage account. How do you know 
which broker to use? Chapter 7 provides some answers and resources to help 
you choose a broker.
Knowing How to Pick Winners
When you get past the basics, you can get to the meat of stock picking. 
Successful stock picking isn’t mysterious, but it does take some time, effort, 
and analysis. And the effort is worthwhile, because stocks are a convenient and 
important part of most investors’ portfolios. Read the following sections and be 
sure to leapfrog to the relevant chapters to get the inside scoop on hot stocks.
Recognizing stock value
Imagine that you like eggs and you’re buying them at the grocery store. In this 
example, the eggs are like companies, and the prices represent the prices you 
would pay for the companies’ stock. The grocery store is the stock market. 
What if two brands of eggs are similar, but one costs 50 cents a carton and the 
other costs 75 cents? Which would you choose? Odds are you’d look at both 
brands, judge their quality, and — if they’re indeed similar — take the cheaper 
eggs. The eggs at 75 cents are overpriced. The same is true of stocks. What if 
you compare two companies that are similar in every respect but have differ­
ent share prices? All things being equal, the cheaper price has greater value for 
the investor.
But the egg example has another side. What if the quality of the two brands 
of eggs is significantly different, but their prices are the same? If one brand 
of eggs is stale, of poor quality, and priced at 50 cents and the other brand is 
fresh, of superior quality, and also priced at 50 cents, which would you get? 
We’d take the good brand because they’re better eggs. Perhaps the lesser 
eggs are an acceptable purchase at 10 cents, but they’re definitely overpriced 
at 50 cents. The same example works with stocks. A poorly run company 
isn’t a good choice if you can buy a better company in the marketplace at the 
same — or a better — price.
	
Comparing the value of eggs may seem overly simplistic, yet it provides an egg-
cellent depiction of the heart of stock investing. (Sorry, we couldn’t resist.) Eggs and 
egg prices can be as varied as companies and stock prices. As an investor, you must 
make it your job to find the best value for your investment dollars. Otherwise, you 
end up with egg on your face. (You saw that one coming too, right?)

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Understanding how market capitalization 
affects stock value
You can determine a company’s value (and thus the value of its stock) in 
many ways. The most basic way is to look at the company’s market value, 
also known as market capitalization (or market cap). Market capitalization is 
simply the value you get when you multiply all the outstanding shares of a 
stock by the current price of a single share.
	
Calculating the market cap is easy. If a company has 1 million shares outstand­
ing and its share price is $10, the market cap is $10 million.
Small cap, mid cap, and large cap aren’t references to headgear; they’re refer­
ences to how large a company is as measured by its market value. The five 
basic stock categories of market capitalization are:
	
✓	Micro cap (under $250 million): These stocks are the smallest and 
hence the riskiest available.
	
✓	Small cap ($250 million to $1 billion): These stocks fare better than the 
micro caps and still have plenty of growth potential. The key word here 
is “potential.”
	
✓	Mid cap ($1 billion to $10 billion): For many investors, this category 
offers a good compromise between small caps and large caps. These 
stocks have some of the safety of large caps while retaining some of the 
growth potential of small caps.
	
✓	Large cap ($10 billion to $50 billion): This category is usually best 
reserved for conservative stock investors who want steady appreciation 
with greater safety. Stocks in this category are frequently referred to as 
blue chips.
	
✓	Ultra cap (over $50 billion): These stocks are also called mega caps and 
obviously refer to companies that are the biggest of the big. U.S. stocks 
such as General Electric and Exxon Mobil are examples. (No ultra caps 
exist in Canada — not even Research In Motion qualifies.)
	
From a safety point of view, a company’s size and market value do matter. 
All things being equal, large-cap stocks are considered safer than small-cap 
stocks. That’s because larger companies generally have better operational 
controls than smaller ones, so their risks are more mitigated. However, small-
cap stocks have greater potential for growth. These tend to be leaner, meaner, 
and more responsive to market and customer needs. They often exploit 
opportunities more quickly.

15
 Chapter 1: Welcome to the World of Stock Investing
Compare these stocks to trees: Which tree is sturdier, a giant B.C. redwood 
or a small oak tree that’s just a year old? In a great storm, the redwood holds 
up well, while the smaller tree has a rough time. But you also have to ask 
yourself which tree has more opportunity for growth. The redwood may not 
have much growth left, but the small oak tree has plenty of growth to look 
forward to.
For beginning investors, comparing market cap to trees isn’t so far-fetched. 
You want your money to branch out without becoming a sap.
	
Although market capitalization is important to consider, don’t invest (or not 
invest) based solely on it. It’s just one measure of value. As a serious investor, 
you need to look at numerous factors that can help you determine whether 
any given stock is a good investment. Keep reading — this book is full of infor­
mation to help you decide.
Sharpening your investment skills
Canadian investors who analyze a company can better judge the value of 
its stock and profit from buying and selling it. Your greatest asset in stock 
investing is knowledge (and a little common sense). To succeed in the world 
of stock investing, keep in mind these key success factors:
	
✓	Understand why you want to invest in stocks. Are you seeking appre­
ciation (capital gains) or income (dividends)? Look at Chapters 8 and 9 
for information on these topics.
	
✓	Get a good grounding in economics. It could save your financial life! 
In Chapter 10, we include some basic (but very interesting) points on 
economics. We suspect that as a group stock investors are woefully 
underinformed in economics now more than ever, and are therefore at 
greater risk (translation: they’re prone to bad stock decisions!). Check it 
out — you’ll be glad you did.
	
✓	Stay on top of political trends. Stocks succeed or fail in large part 
because of the political environment in which they operate. Politics (see 
Chapter 11) is definitely something you should know about in the con­
text of stock investing.
	
✓	Do some research on the numbers behind a company. Look at the com­
pany whose stock you’re considering to see whether it’s a profitable and 
financially stable business worthy of your investment dollars. Chapters 
12, 13, and 14 help you scrutinize the all-important financial reports of 
companies.

16
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
✓	Investigate the people running the companies you’re considering 
investing in. Sometimes, what people tell you to do with stocks is not as 
revealing as what people are actually doing. This is why we like to look 
at company insiders before we buy or sell a particular stock. To find out 
more about insider buying and selling, read Chapter 15.
	
✓	Choose a winning industry to choose a winning stock. You’ll frequently 
see stock prices of mediocre companies in hot industries rise higher and 
faster than solid companies in floundering industries. Therefore, choos­
ing the industry is very important. Find out more about analyzing indus­
tries in Chapter 17.
	
✓	Understand and identify megatrends. Doing so makes it easier for you 
to make money. This edition spends more time on — and provides more 
resources for — helping you see the opportunities in emerging sectors 
and avoid the problem areas (see Chapter 18 for details).
Boning Up on Strategies and Tactics
Successful investing isn’t just what you invest in; it’s also the way you invest. 
We’re very big on strategies that take into account your risk tolerance, stage 
of life, preferred type of brokerage account, and tax situation.
	
✓	Recognize that the turbulent markets you’ve witnessed recently are 
likely to continue for some time. Choosing between investing over the 
long term (buy and hold) and trading stocks over a shorter time frame 
(buy and sell quickly) may be necessary. Even though we are not huge 
proponents of stock trading, we agree that during these volatile times 
it may be appropriate to a limited extent. Delve into basic stock trading 
concepts in Chapter 19.
	
✓	Use investing strategies like the pros do. In other words, how you go 
about investing can be just as important as what you invest in. Chapter 
20 highlights techniques for investing to help you make more money 
from your stocks.
	
✓	Understand how to strategically place orders to buy and sell stocks 
with the broker you select. Chapter 21 shows you how to be effective in 
executing orders.
	
✓	Keep more of the money you earn. After all your great work in getting 
the right stocks and making the big bucks, you should know about keep­
ing more of the fruits of your investing. We cover taxes in stock invest­
ing in Chapter 22.

Stock market insanity
Have you ever noticed a stock going up even 
though the company is reporting terrible 
results? How about seeing a stock nosedive 
despite the fact that the company is doing well? 
What gives? Well, judging the direction of a 
stock in a short-term period — over the next 
few days or weeks — is almost impossible.
Yes, in the short term, stock investing is irra­
tional. The price of a stock and the value of its 
company seem disconnected and crazy. The 
key phrase to remember is “short term.” A 
stock’s price and the company’s value become 
more logical over an extended period of time. 
The longer a stock is in the public’s view, the 
more rational the performance of the stock’s 
price. In other words, a good company con­
tinues to draw attention to itself; hence, more 
people want its stock, and the share price 
rises to better match the company’s value. 
Conversely, a bad company doesn’t hold up to 
continued scrutiny over time. As more and more 
people see that the company isn’t doing well, 
the share price declines. Over the long run, a 
stock’s share price and the company’s value 
eventually become equal for the most part.

Chapter 2
Taking Stock of Your Current 
Financial Situation and Goals
In This Chapter
▶	Preparing your personal balance sheet
▶	Looking at your cash-flow statement
▶	Determining your financial goals
Yes, you want to make the big bucks. Or maybe you just want to get back 
the big bucks you lost in stocks during the bear market (a long period of 
falling prices) of 2000–02, or perhaps in the tumultuous volatility of 2008–09. 
(Investors who followed the guidelines from the 1st and 2nd editions of this 
book did much better than the crowd!) Either way, you want your money 
to grow so that you can have a better life. But before you make reserva­
tions for that Caribbean cruise you’re dreaming about, you have to map out 
your action plan for getting there. Stocks can be a great component of most 
wealth-building programs, but you must first do some homework on a topic 
you should be very familiar with — yourself. That’s right. Understanding your 
current financial situation and clearly defining your financial goals are the 
first steps in successful investing.
Let us give you an example. Paul met an investor at one of his seminars who 
had a million dollars worth of Procter & Gamble (PG) stock, and he was 
nearing retirement. He asked Paul if he should sell his stock and be more 
growth-oriented, investing in a batch of small-cap stocks (that is, stocks of a 
company worth $250 million to $1 billion; see Chapter 1). Because he already 
had enough assets to retire on at that time, Paul told him he didn’t need to 
get more aggressive. In fact, Paul said that he had too much tied to a single 
stock, even though it was a solid, large company. What would happen to his 
assets if problems arose at PG? It seemed obvious to tell him to shrink his 
stock portfolio and put that money elsewhere, such as paying off debt or 
adding investment-grade bonds for diversification.

20
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
This chapter is undoubtedly one of the most important chapters in this book. 
At first, you may think it’s more suitable for some general book on personal 
finance. Wrong! Unsuccessful investors’ greatest weakness is not understand­
ing their financial situation and how stocks fit in. Often, we counsel people to 
stay out of the stock market if they aren’t prepared for the responsibilities of 
stock investing — they haven’t been regularly reviewing the company’s finan­
cial statements or tracking the company’s progress.
	
Investing in stocks requires balance. Investors sometimes tie up too much 
money in stocks, putting themselves at risk of losing a significant portion of 
their wealth if the market plunges. Then again, other investors place little or 
no money in stocks and therefore miss out on excellent opportunities to grow 
their wealth. Investors should make stocks a part of their portfolios, but the 
operative word is part. Let stocks take up only a portion of your money. A dis­
ciplined investor also has money in bank accounts, investment-grade bonds, 
precious metals, and other assets that offer growth or income opportunities. 
Diversification is the key to minimizing risk. (For more on risk, see Chapters 4 
and 16.)
Establishing a Starting Point
Whether you’re already in stocks or you’re looking to get into stocks, you 
need to decide how much money you can afford to invest. No matter what 
you hope to accomplish with your stock investing plan, the first step to take 
as a budding investor is figuring out how much you own and how much you 
owe. To do this, prepare and review your personal balance sheet. A balance 
sheet is simply a list of your assets and your liabilities, and what each item is 
currently worth, so you can arrive at your net worth: total assets minus total 
liabilities. We know that these terms sound like accounting mumbo jumbo, 
but knowing your net worth is important to your future financial success, so 
we urge you to just do it!
Composing your balance sheet is simple. Pull out a pencil and a piece of 
paper. For the computer savvy, a spreadsheet software program accom­
plishes the same task. Gather all your financial documents, such as bank and 
brokerage statements and other such paperwork — you need figures from 
these documents. Then follow the steps that we outline in the following sec­
tions. Update your balance sheet at least once each year to monitor your 
financial progress. (Is your net worth going up or not?)
	
Your personal balance sheet is really no different from balance sheets that 
huge companies like CN (Canadian National Railway Company) prepare. (The 
main difference is a few zeros, but you can use our advice in this book to 
work on changing that.) In fact, the more you find out about your own balance 
sheet, the easier it is to understand the balance sheets of companies in which 
you’re seeking to invest.

21
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
Step 1: Making sure you have 
an emergency fund
First, list cash on your balance sheet (see the next step for more on listing 
your assets). Your goal is to have, in reserve, at least three to six months’ 
worth of your gross living expenses in cash. The cash is important because 
it gives you a cushion. Three to six months is usually long enough to get you 
through the most common forms of financial disruption, such as losing your 
job and needing time to find a new one.
	
If your monthly expenses (or outflow) are $2,000, you should have at least 
$6,000 — and probably closer to $12,000 — in a secure, Canada Deposit 
Insurance Corporation (CDIC)–insured, interest-bearing bank account or other 
relatively safe interest-bearing vehicle, such as a money market fund. Consider 
this account an emergency fund and not an investment. Don’t use this money 
to buy stocks.
Too many Canadians don’t have an emergency fund, meaning that they put 
themselves at risk. Walking across a busy street while wearing a blindfold is 
a great example of putting yourself at risk, and in recent years investors have 
done the financial equivalent. Investors piled on tremendous debt, put too 
much money into investments (such as stocks) that they didn’t understand, 
and had little or no cash savings to fall back on. One of the biggest problems 
of this decade was that savings were sinking to record lows while debt levels 
were reaching new heights. People then sold many of their stocks because 
they needed funds for — you guessed it — paying bills and debt.
	
Resist the urge to start thinking of your investment in stocks as a savings 
account generating over 20 percent per year. This is dangerous thinking! If your 
investments tank, or if you lose your job, you will have financial difficulty. This 
cash-flow trouble, in turn, will affect your stock portfolio (you might have to sell 
some stocks in your account just to get money to pay the bills). An emergency 
fund exists to help you through a temporary cash crunch.
Step 2: Listing your assets in 
decreasing order of liquidity
Liquid assets aren’t references to beer or cola (unless you’re Molson, Labatt, 
Sleeman, or Cott). Instead, liquidity refers to how quickly you can convert a 
particular asset (something you own that has value) into cash. If you know 
the liquidity of your assets, including investments, you have some options 
when you need cash to buy some stock (or pay some bills). All too often, 
people are short on cash and have too much wealth tied up in illiquid invest­
ments such as real estate, leading to what the Governor of the Bank of Canada 
would call a “liquidity crisis.” Illiquid is just a fancy way of saying that you 

22
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
don’t have the immediate cash to meet a pressing need. (Hey, we’ve all had 
those moments!) Review your assets and take measures to ensure you have 
enough liquid assets (along with your illiquid assets).
	
Listing your assets in order of liquidity on your balance sheet gives you an 
immediate picture of which assets you can quickly convert to cash and which 
assets you can’t. If you need money now, you can see that cash in hand, your 
chequing account, and your savings account are at the top of the list. The 
items last in order of liquidity become obvious; they’re things like real estate 
and other assets that can take a long time to convert to cash.
	
Selling real estate can take many months, especially in a buyer’s market like the 
one most Canadian provinces are currently experiencing. Investors who don’t 
have adequate liquid assets run the danger of selling assets too quickly — possi­
bly at a loss — because they scramble to accumulate the cash for their short-term 
financial obligations. For stock investors, this scramble may include prematurely 
selling stocks that they originally intended to use as long-term investments.
Table 2-1 shows a typical list of assets in order of liquidity. Use it as a guide 
for making your own asset list.

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
The first column of Table 2-1 describes the asset. You can quickly convert 
current assets to cash — they’re more liquid; long-term assets have value, but 
you can’t necessarily convert them to cash quickly — they aren’t very liquid.
Please take note. Stocks are listed as short-term in the table above. The 
reason for this is that this balance sheet is meant to list items in order of 
liquidity. Liquidity is best exemplified in the question, “How quickly can I 
turn this asset into cash?” Because a stock can be sold and converted to cash 
very quickly, it is a good example of a liquid asset. (However, that is not the 
main purpose for buying stocks.)
The second column gives the current market value for that item. Keep in 
mind that this value is not the purchase price or original value; it’s the 
amount you would realistically get if you sold the asset in the current market 
at a given moment.
The third column tells you how well that investment is doing compared to one 
year ago. If the percentage rate is 5 percent, that item increased in value by 5 
percent from a year ago. You need to know how well all your assets are doing. 
Why? To adjust your assets for maximum growth or to get rid of assets that 
are losing money. Assets that are doing well are kept (in fact, you may want to 
increase your holdings), and assets that are down in value are candidates for 
removal. Perhaps you can sell these losers and reinvest the money elsewhere. 
In addition, the realized loss has tax implications (see Chapter 22).
Figuring the annual growth rate (in the third column) as a percentage isn’t 
difficult. Say that you buy 100 shares of the stock Gro-A-Lot Corp. (GAL), and 
its market value on December 31, 2008 is $50 per share, for a total market 
value of $5,000 (100 shares × $50 per share). When you check its value on 
December 31, 2009, you find out the stock is at $60 per share, meaning your 
shares now have a total market value of $6,000 (100 shares × $60 per share). 
The annual growth rate is 20 percent. You calculate this by taking the amount 
of the gain ($60 per share – $50 per share = $10 gain per share), which is 
$1,000 (100 shares × the $10 gain), and dividing it by the value at the begin­
ning of the time period ($5,000). In this case, you get 20 percent ($1,000 ÷ 
$5,000). What if GAL also generates a dividend of $2 per share during that 
period; now what? In that case, GAL generates a total return of 24 percent. To 
calculate the total return, add the appreciation ($10 per share × 100 shares = 
$1,000) and the dividend income ($2 per share × 100 shares = $200), and then 
divide that sum ($1,000 + $200, or $1,200) by the value at the beginning of 
the year ($50 per share × 100 shares, or $5,000). The total is $1,200 ($1,000 of 
appreciation + $200 total dividends), or 24 percent ($1,200 ÷ $5,000).

24
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
The last line of Table 2-1 lists the total current market value of current and 
long-term assets. The third column answers the question, “How well did this 
particular asset grow from a year ago?”
Step 3: Listing your liabilities
Liabilities are simply the bills that you’re obligated to pay. Whether it’s a 
credit card bill or a mortgage payment, a liability is an amount of money you 
have to pay back eventually (with interest). If you don’t keep track of your 
liabilities, you may end up thinking that you have more money than you 
really do.
Table 2-2 lists some common liabilities. Use it as a model when you list your 
own. List the liabilities according to how soon you need to pay them; for 
example, credit card balances tend to be short-term obligations, and mort­
gages are long-term debts.

$4,000
20%
Personal loans
$13,000
10%
Mortgage

Total Liabilities
$117,000
The first column in Table 2-2 names the type of debt. Don’t forget to include 
student loans and auto loans if you have any of these. Never avoid listing a 
liability because you’re embarrassed to see how much you really owe. Be 
honest with yourself — doing so helps you improve your financial health.
The second column shows the current value (or current balance) of your 
liabilities. List the most current balances to see where you stand with your 
creditors.
The third column reflects how much interest you’re paying for carrying that 
debt. This information is an important reminder of how debt can be a wealth 
zapper. Credit card debt can have an interest rate of 19 percent or more, and 
to add insult to injury, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) doesn’t even allow 

25
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
these interest fees to be tax deductible. Using a credit card to make even 
a small purchase costs you if you maintain a balance. Within a year, a $50 
sweater at 19 percent ends up costing $59.50 when you add in the potential 
interest you pay.
	
When you compare your liabilities in Table 2-2 and your personal assets in 
Table 2-1, you may find opportunities to reduce the amount you pay for inter­
est. Say, for example, that you pay 15 percent on a credit card balance of 
$4,000 but also have a personal asset of $5,000 in a bank savings account 
that’s earning 2 percent in interest. In this case, you may want to consider 
taking $4,000 out of the savings account to pay off the credit card balance. 
Doing so saves you $520: The $4,000 you have in the bank is earning only $80 
(2 percent of $4,000), while you are paying $600 on the credit card balance (15 
percent of $4,000).
	
If you can’t pay off high-interest debt, at least look for ways to minimize the 
cost of carrying the debt. The most obvious ways include the following:
	
✓	Replacing high-interest cards with low-interest cards: Many companies 
offer incentives to consumers, including signing up for credit cards with 
favourable rates that can be used to pay off high-interest cards.
	
✓	Replacing unsecured debt with secured debt: Credit cards and personal 
loans are unsecured (you haven’t put up any collateral or other asset to 
secure the debt); therefore, they have higher interest rates because the 
creditor considers this type of debt to be riskier. Sources of secured debt 
(such as home equity line accounts and brokerage accounts) provide 
you with a means to replace your high-interest debt with lower-interest 
debt. You get lower interest rates with secured debt because it’s less 
risky for the creditor — the debt is backed up by collateral (your home 
or your stocks).
	
The Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada reported that 103,621 
people declared bankruptcies in Canada for the 12-month period ending 
March 31, 2009. In 2005, that figure was about 85,000. (In the U.S., the personal 
bankruptcy figure hit 1.6 million people in the 12-month period ended March 
31, 2009. It has hovered around the one-million mark during the past decade.) 
Clearly, many Canadians continue to get tripped up in debt traps and need 
to make a serious 180-degree turn with respect to their saving habits. Every 
Canadian should make a diligent effort to control and reduce any personal 
debt, or risk his or her personal wealth being wiped out during periods of 
economic decline. Those who do not keep their debts to a minimum will prob­
ably have to sell off their stocks just to stay solvent. Remember, Murphy’s Law 
states that you will sell your stock at the worst possible moment. Don’t go 
there!

Step 4: Calculating your net worth
Your net worth is an indication of your total wealth. You can calculate your 
net worth with this basic equation: Total assets (Table 2-1) less total liabili­
ties (Table 2-2) equals net worth (net assets or net equity).
Table 2-3 shows this equation in action with a net worth of $169,090 — a 
very respectable number. For many investors, just being in a position where 
assets exceed liabilities (a positive net worth) is great news. Use Table 2-3 as 
a model to analyze your own financial situation. Your mission (if you choose 
to accept it — and you should) is to ensure that your net worth increases 
from year to year as you progress toward your financial goal.

Debt is one of the biggest financial problems 
in North America today. Companies and indi­
viduals holding excessive debt (to buy assets 
or finance growth) contributed to the stock 
market’s massive decline in March 2009 and 
the current overall economic weakness. If 
individuals managed their personal liabilities 
more responsibly, the general economy would 
be much better off. Even when the Canadian or 
American economy looks unstoppable, sooner 
or later you have to pay the piper. This may 
mean working longer and harder than you had 
hoped. Remember: Stock prices may go up and 
down, but debt stays up until it is either paid 
down or the debtor files for bankruptcy. As of 
2009, American and Canadian debt combined 
has surpassed a mind-boggling $51 trillion — 
which means that consumers, businesses, and 
governments will continue to be financially 
challenged during this decade and into the 
next. Yes, the stock market will be affected!

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
Step 5: Analyzing your balance sheet
Create a balance sheet based on the prior steps in this chapter to illustrate 
your current finances. Take a close look at it and try to identify any changes 
you can make to increase your wealth. Sometimes reaching your financial 
goals can be as simple as refocusing the items on your balance sheet (use the 
above table as a general guideline). Here are some brief points to consider:
	
✓	Is the money in your emergency (or rainy-day) fund sitting in an ultra-
safe account and earning the highest interest available? Bank money 
market accounts or money market funds are recommended. The safest 
type of account is a Canadian or U.S. Treasury money market fund. The 
Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) backs Canadian banks, 
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) backs American 
banks. Canadian and U.S. Treasury securities (which usually comprise 
money market funds) are backed by the “full faith and credit” of their 
respective federal government.
	
✓	Can you replace depreciating assets with appreciating assets? Say you 
have two stereo systems. Why not sell one and invest the proceeds? You 
may say, “But I bought that unit two years ago for $500, and if I sell it 
now, I’ll only get $300.” And that’s your choice. You need to decide what 
helps your financial situation more — a $500 item that keeps shrink­
ing in value (a depreciating asset) or $300 that can grow in value when 
invested (an appreciating asset).
	
✓	Can you replace low-yield investments with high-yield investments? 
Maybe you have $5,000 in a bank GIC earning 3 percent. You can cer­
tainly shop around for a better rate at another bank, but you can also 
seek alternatives that offer a higher yield, such as Canada Savings Bonds 
or short-term bond funds.
	
✓	Can you pay off any high-interest debt with funds from low-interest 
assets? For example, if you have $5,000 earning 2 percent in a taxable 
bank account and a $2,500 debt on a credit card charging 18 percent 
(nondeductible), you may as well pay off the credit card balance and 
save on the interest.
	
✓	If you’re carrying debt, are you using that money to gain an invest­
ment return that is greater than the interest you’re paying? Carrying 
a loan with an interest rate of 8 percent is acceptable if that borrowed 
money is yielding more than 8 percent elsewhere. Suppose that you 
have $6,000 in cash in a brokerage account. If you qualify, you can actu­
ally make a stock purchase greater than $6,000 by using margin (essen­
tially a loan from the broker). You can buy $12,000 of stock using your 
$6,000 in cash, with the remainder financed by the broker. Of course, 
you pay interest on that margin loan. But what if the interest rate is 
6 percent and the stock you’re about to invest in has a dividend that 
yields 9 percent? In that case, the dividend can help you pay off the 
margin loan and you keep the additional income.

28
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
✓	Can you sell any personal stuff for cash? You can replace unproductive 
assets with cash from garage sales and auction Web sites.
	
✓	Can you use your home equity to pay off consumer debt? Borrowing 
against your home has more favourable interest rates, and this interest 
is still tax deductible. (Be careful about your debt level. See Chapter 20 
for warnings about debt and other concerns.)
	
	Paying off consumer debt by using funds borrowed against your home 
is a great way to wipe the slate clean. What a relief it is to get rid of your 
credit card balances! Just don’t turn around and run up the consumer 
debt again. You can get overburdened and experience financial ruin (not 
to mention homelessness). Not a pretty picture.
The important point to remember is that you can take control of your 
finances with discipline (and with the advice we offer in this book).
Funding Your Stock Program
If you’re going to invest money in stocks, the first thing you need is . . . money! 
Where can you get that money? If you’re waiting for an inheritance to come 
through, you may have to wait a long time, considering all the advances being 
made in healthcare lately. (What’s that? You were going to invest in healthcare 
stocks? How ironic.) Yet, the challenge still comes down to how to fund your stock 
program.
Many investors can reallocate their investments and assets to do the trick. 
Reallocating simply means selling some investments or other assets and rein­
vesting that money into stocks. It boils down to deciding which investments 
or assets you can sell or liquidate. Generally, consider those investments and 
assets that give you a low return on your money (or no return at all). If you 
have a complicated mix of investments and assets, you may want to review 
your options with a financial planner. Reallocation is just one part of the 
answer; your cash flow is the other part.
Ever wonder why there’s so much month left at the end of the money? 
Consider your cash flow. Your cash flow refers to what money is coming in 
(income) and what money is being spent (outflow). The net result is either a 
positive cash flow or a negative cash flow, depending on your cash manage­
ment skills. Maintaining a positive cash flow (more money coming in than 
going out) helps you increase your net worth tremendously (mo’ money, mo’ 
money, mo’ money!). A negative cash flow ultimately depletes your wealth 
and wipes out your net worth if you don’t turn it around immediately. The 
following sections show you how to analyze your cash flow. The first step is 
to do a cash-flow statement.

29
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
Don’t confuse a cash-flow statement with an income statement (also called a “profit 
and loss statement” or an “income and expense statement”). A cash-flow statement 
is simple to calculate because you can easily track what goes in and what goes out.
With a cash-flow statement (see Table 2-6), you ask yourself three questions:
	
✓	What money is coming in? In your cash-flow statement, jot down all 
sources of income. Calculate your income for the month and then for the 
year. Include everything — salary or wages, interest, dividends, and so 
on. Add them all up to get your grand total for income.
	
✓	What is your outflow? Write down all the things that you spend money 
on. List all your expenses. If possible, categorize them into essential and 
nonessential expenses — this lets you get an idea of all the expenses that 
you can reduce without affecting your lifestyle. But before you do that, 
make as complete a list as possible of what you spend your money on.
	
✓	What’s left? If your income is greater than your outflow, then you have 
money ready and available for stock investing. No matter how small the 
amount seems, it definitely helps. We’ve seen fortunes built when people 
started to diligently invest as little as $25 to $50 per week or per month. 
If your outflow is greater than your income, then you better sharpen 
your pencil. Cut down on nonessential spending and/or increase your 
income. If your budget is a little tight, hold off on your stock investing 
until your cash flow improves.
Step 1: Tallying up your income
Using Table 2-4 as a worksheet, list and calculate the money you have coming 
in. The first column describes the source of the money; the second indicates 
the monthly amount from each respective source; and the third indicates the 
amount projected for a full year. Include all income, such as wages, business 
income, dividends, interest income, and so on. Then project these amounts 
for a year (multiply by 12) and enter those amounts in the third column.

Monthly $ Amount
Yearly $ Amount

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
This is the amount of money you have to work with. To ensure your good 
financial health, don’t spend more than this amount. Always be aware of and 
carefully manage your income.
Step 2: Adding up your outflow
Using Table 2-5 as a worksheet, list and calculate the money that’s going out. 
What amount of money are you spending, and on what? The first column 
describes the source of the expense; the second indicates the monthly 
amount; and the third shows the amount projected for a full year. Include all 
the money you spend on essential expenses, including credit card and other 
debt payments; household expenses, such as food, utility bills, and medical 
expenses; and miscellaneous expenses, such as shinny hockey arena fees. 
Also include money spent for nonessential expenses such as video games 
and porcelain busts of John Diefenbaker. (All right, perhaps hockey fees 
aren’t all that essential!)

 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
Payroll taxes is just a category in which to lump all the various taxes that the 
government takes out of your paycheque. Feel free to include each individual 
tax on its own line, if you prefer. The important thing is to create a com­
prehensive list that is meaningful to you. You may notice that the outflow 
doesn’t include items such as payments to a Registered Retirement Savings 
Plan (RRSP), Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA), or other savings vehicles. 
Yes, these items do impact your cash flow, but they’re not expenses. The 
amounts that you invest (or that your employer invests on your behalf) are 
essentially assets that benefit your long-term financial situation, as opposed 
to an expense that doesn’t help you build wealth.
Step 3: Creating a cash-flow statement
Okay, you’re almost finished. The last step is creating a cash-flow statement 
so that you can see (all in one place) how your money moves — how much 
comes in and how much goes out, and where it goes.
Plug the amount of your total income (from Table 2-4) and the amount of 
your total expenses (from Table 2-5) into the Table 2-6 worksheet to see your 
cash flow. Do you have a positive cash flow — more cash coming in than 
going out — so that you can start investing in stocks (or other investments), 
or are expenses overwhelming your income? Doing a cash-flow statement 
isn’t just about finding money to fund your stock program. First and fore­
most, it’s about your financial well-being. Are you managing your finances 
well, or not?

Recall our earlier warning that Canada’s personal bankruptcy levels recently 
reached a record high, and the U.S. also has sustained record numbers of 
personal bankruptcies — in these cases, personal debt and expenses far 
exceeded whatever income was generated. This should serve as yet another 
reminder to all Canadians to watch their cash flow. Keep your income grow­
ing and your expenses and debt as low as possible.

32
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Step 4: Analyzing your cash flow
Use your cash-flow statement to identify sources of funds for your invest­
ment program. The more you can increase your income and the more you 
can decrease your outflow, the better. Scrutinize your data. Where can you 
improve the results? Here are some questions to ask yourself:
	
✓	How can you increase your income? Do you have hobbies, interests, or 
skills that can generate extra cash for you?
	
✓	Can you get more paid overtime at work? How about a promotion or a 
job change?
	
✓	Where can you cut expenses?
	
✓	Have you categorized your expenses as either essential or nonessential?
	
✓	Can you lower your debt payments by refinancing or consolidating loans 
and credit card balances?
	
✓	Have you shopped around for lower insurance or telephone rates?
	
✓	Have you analyzed the tax withholdings in your paycheque to make sure 
you aren’t overpaying your taxes (just to get your overpayment back 
from the Canada Revenue Agency next year as a refund)?
Another option: Finding investment 
money in tax savings
It’s always a good idea to sit down with your tax adviser and try to find ways 
to reduce your taxes. A home-based business, for example, is a great way to 
gain new income and increase your tax deductions, resulting in a lower tax 
burden. Your tax adviser or professional accountant (someone with a CA, 
CMA, or CGA designation) can make recommendations that will work for you.
	
One tax strategy to consider is doing your stock investing in a tax-sheltered 
account, such as an open or locked-in self-directed RRSP. Another option is a 
Tax Free Savings Account (TFSA). Again, check with your qualified tax adviser 
for deductions and strategies available to you. For more on the tax implica­
tions of stock investing, including TFSA rules, see Chapter 22.

33
 Chapter 2: Taking Stock of Your Current Financial Situation and Goals 
Setting Your Sights on 
Your Financial Goals
Consider stocks to be tools for living, just like any other investment — no 
more, no less. Stocks are the tools you use (one among many) to accom­
plish something — to achieve a goal. Yes, successfully investing in stocks 
is the goal you’re probably shooting for if you’re reading this book. Take a 
moment to complete the following sentence: “I want to be successful in my 
stock investing program to accomplish _______.” You must consider stock 
investing as a means to an end. When people buy a computer, they don’t (or 
shouldn’t) think of buying a computer just to have a computer. People buy a 
computer because doing so helps them achieve a particular result, such as 
being more efficient in business, playing fun games, or having a nifty paper­
weight (tsk, tsk).
	
Know the difference between long-term, intermediate-term, and short-term 
goals and then set some of each. Long-term refers to projects or financial goals 
that need funding five or more years from now; intermediate-term goals need 
funding two to five years from now; and short-term goals need funding less 
than two years from now.
Stocks, in general, are best suited for long-term goals such as these:
	
✓	Achieving financial independence (think retirement funding)
	
✓	Paying for future postsecondary education costs
	
✓	Paying for any long-term expenditure or project
Some categories of stock (such as conservative or blue-chip) may be suitable 
for intermediate-term financial goals. If, for example, you will retire four years 
from now, conservative stocks are appropriate. If you’re optimistic about 
the stock market and confident that stock prices will rise, then go ahead and 
invest. However, if you’re negative about the market (you’re bearish, or you 
believe that stock prices will decline), you may want to wait until the econ­
omy starts to forge a clear path.
Stocks generally aren’t suitable for short-term investing goals because stock 
prices can behave irrationally within a short period of time. Stocks fluctuate 
from day to day, so you don’t know what the stock will be worth in the near 
future. You may end up with less money than you expected. For investors 
seeking to reliably accrue money for short-term needs, short-term bank GICs 
or money market funds are more appropriate.

34
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
In recent years, investors have sought quick, short-term profits by trading and 
speculating in stocks. Lured by the fantastic returns generated by the stock 
market in the late 1990s, investors saw stocks as a get-rich-quick scheme. It is 
very important for you to understand the differences between investing, 
saving, and speculating. Which one do you want to do? Knowing the answer to 
this question is crucial to your goals and aspirations. Investors who don’t 
know the differences tend to get burned. Here’s some information to help you 
distinguish among these three actions:
	
✓	Investing is the act of putting your current funds into securities or 
tangible assets for the purpose of gaining future appreciation, income, 
or both. You need time, knowledge, and discipline to invest. The invest­
ment can fluctuate in price but has been chosen for long-term potential.
	
✓	Saving is the safe accumulation of funds for a future use. Savings don’t 
fluctuate and are generally free of financial risk. The emphasis is on 
safety and liquidity.
	
✓	Speculating is the financial world’s equivalent to gambling. An inves­
tor who speculates is seeking quick profits gained from short-term price 
movements in that particular asset or investment.
These distinctly different concepts are often confused, even among so-called 
financial experts. For your purposes, though, please make sure you know 
the differences among investing, saving, and speculating before you invest in 
stocks. In fact, avoid speculating altogether when you are starting out in the 
world of stock investing.

“I
nvesting for the long term” isn’t just some perfunctory investment 
slogan. It’s a culmination of proven stock market experience that goes 
back many decades. Unfortunately, investor buying and selling habits have 
deteriorated in recent years due to impatience. Today’s investors think that 
short term is measured in days, intermediate term is measured in weeks, and 
long term is measured in months. Yeesh! It’s no wonder that so many folks 
are complaining about lousy investment returns. Investors have lost the prof­
itable art of patience!
What should you do? Become an investor with a time horizon greater than 
one year. Give your investments time to grow. Everybody dreams about 
emulating the success of someone like Warren Buffett, but few emulate his 
patience (a huge part of his investment success).
Stocks are tools you can use to build your wealth. When used wisely, for the 
right purpose, and in the right environment, they do a great job. But when 
improperly applied, they can lead to disaster. In this chapter, we show you 
how to choose the right types of investments based on your short- and long-
term financial goals. We also show you how to decide on your purpose for 
investing (growth or income investing) and your style of investing (conserva­
tive or aggressive).

36
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Matching Stocks and Strategies 
with Your Goals
Various stocks are out there, and so are various investment approaches. The 
key to success in the stock market is matching the right kind of stock with 
the right kind of investment situation. You have to choose both the stock and 
the approach that match your goals. (Refer to Chapter 2 for more on defining 
your financial goals.)
Before investing in a stock, ask yourself, “When do I want to reach my finan­
cial goal?” Stocks are a means to an end. Your job is to figure out what that 
end is — or, more important, when it is. Do you want to retire in ten years or 
next year? Must you pay for your kid’s university education next year or 18 
years from now? The length of time you have before you need the money you 
hope to earn from stock investing determines what stocks you buy. Table 3-1 
gives some guidelines for choosing the kind of stock that’s best suited to the 
type of investor you are and the goals you have.

vehicles such as savings 
accounts and money market 
funds.

37
 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
Dividends are payments made to an owner (unlike interest, which is payments 
to a creditor). Dividends are a great source of income, and companies that 
issue dividends tend to have more stable stock prices as well. For more infor­
mation on dividend-paying stocks, see the section “Investing for a Purpose” 
in this chapter, and Chapter 9.
	
Table 3-1 gives you general guidelines, but keep in mind that not everyone can 
fit into a particular profile. Every investor has a unique situation, set of goals, 
and level of risk tolerance. Remember that the terms large cap, mid cap, and 
small cap refer to the size (or market capitalization, also known as market cap) 
of the company. All factors being equal, large companies are safer (less risky) 
than small companies. For more on market caps, see the section “Investing for 
Your Personal Style” later in this chapter.
Investing by Time Frame
Are your goals long-term or short-term? Answering this question is important 
because individual stocks can be either great or horrible choices, depending 
on the time period you want to focus on. Generally, the length of time you 
plan to invest in stocks can be short term, intermediate term, or long term. 
The following sections outline what kinds of stocks are most appropriate for 
each term length.
	
With stock performance history as an indicator, investing in stocks becomes 
less risky as the time frame lengthens. Stock prices tend to fluctuate on a daily 
basis, but they have a tendency to trend up or down over an extended period 
of time. Even if you invest in a stock that goes down in the short term, you’re 
likely to see it rise — and possibly go above your initial investment — if you 
have the patience to wait it out and let the stock price appreciate.
Focusing on the short term
Short term generally means one year or less, although some people extend 
the period to two years or less. You get the point.
Everyone has short-term goals. Some are modest, such as setting aside 
money for an exciting vacation in Barbados this year or paying for unwel­
come car repair bills. Other short-term goals are more ambitious, such 
as accruing funds for a down payment to purchase a new home within six 
months. Whatever the expense or purchase, you need a predictable accu­
mulation of cash soon. If this sounds like your situation, stay away from the 
stock market!

38
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
Because stocks can be so unpredictable in the short term, they’re a bad 
choice for short-term considerations. We continue to marvel in disbelief when­
ever we hear slick market analysts saying things like, “At $25 a share, XYZ is a 
solid investment, and we feel that its stock should hit our target price of $40 
within six to nine months.” You just know that someone will hear that and say, 
“Gee, why bother with 3 percent at the bank when this stock will rise by more 
than 50 percent? I better call my broker.” The stock may indeed hit that target 
amount (or even surpass it), or it may not. Most of the time, the stock doesn’t 
reach the target price, and then the investor is disappointed. The stock could 
even go down! The reason why target prices are frequently (usually) missed is 
that the analyst is only one person and it’s difficult to figure out what millions 
of investors will do in the short term. The short term can be irrational because 
so many investors have so many reasons for buying and selling that it’s diffi­
cult to analyze. If you want to use the money you invest for an important 
short-term need, you could lose very important cash quicker than you think.
	
Short-term stock investing is very unpredictable. You can better serve your short-
term goals with stable, interest-bearing investments such as guaranteed investment 
certificates (GICs) and certificates of deposit (CDs), available at chartered banks.
During the raging bull market of the late 1990s, investors watched as some 
high-profile stocks went up 20 to 50 percent in a matter of months. Hey, who 
needs a savings account earning a measly interest rate when stocks grow like 
that! Of course, when the bear market hit from 2000 to 2002 and those same 
stocks fell 50 to 85 percent, a savings account earning a measly interest rate 
suddenly didn’t seem so bad.
	
Stocks — even the best ones — fluctuate in the short term. In a negative envi­
ronment, they can be very volatile. No one can accurately predict the price 
movement (unless you have some inside information), so stocks are definitely 
inappropriate for any financial goal that you need to reach within one year. 
Revisit Table 3-1 for suggestions about your short-term strategies.
Considering intermediate-term goals
Intermediate term refers to financial goals that you plan to reach within five 
years. If, for example, you want to accumulate funds to put money down for 
investing in real estate four years from now, some growth-oriented invest­
ments may be suitable.
Although some stocks may be appropriate for a two- or three-year time period, 
not all stocks are good intermediate-term investments. Different types and 
categories of stocks exist. Some stocks are fairly stable and hold their value 
well, such as the stock of very large or established dividend-paying companies. 
Other stocks have prices that jump all over the place, such as the stocks of 
untested companies that haven’t been in existence long enough to develop a 
consistent track record.

39
 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
	
If you plan to invest in the stock market to meet intermediate-term goals, con­
sider large, established companies or dividend-paying companies in industries 
that provide the necessities of life (like the food and beverage industry, or 
electric utilities). In today’s economic environment, we very strongly believe 
that stocks attached to companies that serve basic human needs should have 
a major presence in most stock portfolios. They’re especially well-suited for 
intermediate investment goals.
	
Just because a particular stock is labelled as being appropriate for the inter­
mediate term doesn’t mean you should get rid of it by the stroke of midnight 
on this date five years from now. After all, if the company is doing well and 
going strong, you can continue holding the stock indefinitely. The more time 
you give a well-positioned, profitable company’s stock to grow, the better 
you’ll do.
Preparing for the long term
Stock investing is best suited for making money over a long period of time. 
When you measure stocks against other investments in terms of five to (pref­
erably) ten or more years, they excel. Even investors who bought stocks 
during the depths of the Great Depression saw profitable growth in their 
stock portfolios over a ten-year period.
In fact, if you examine any ten-year period over the past 70 years, you see 
that stocks almost always beat out other financial investments — such as 
bonds or bank investments — when measured by total return (taking rein­
vesting and the compounding of capital gains and dividends into account)! 
Short-term investing = Speculating
Our case files are littered with examples of 
long-term stock investors who morphed into 
short-term speculators. We know of one fellow 
who had $80,000 and was set to get married 
within 12 months and then put a down payment 
on a new home for him and his bride. He wanted 
to surprise her by growing his nest egg quickly 
so they could have a glitzier wedding and a 
larger down payment. What happened? The 
money instead shrunk to $11,000 as his stock 
choices pulled back sharply. Ouch! How does 
that go again? For better or for worse . . . uh . . . 
for richer or for poorer? We’re sure they had to 
adjust their plans accordingly. We recall some 
of the stocks he chose, and now, years later, 
those stocks have recovered and gone on to 
new highs.
The bottom line is that investing in stocks for 
the short term is nothing more than speculating. 
Your only possible strategy is luck.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
See Chapters 8 and 9 for more about growth and income. As you can see, 
long-term planning allows stocks to shine. Of course, your work doesn’t stop 
at deciding on a long-term investment. You still have to do your homework 
and choose stocks wisely because, even in good times, you can lose money 
if you invest in companies that go out of business. Part III shows you how to 
evaluate specific companies and industries and alerts you to factors in the 
general economy that can affect stock behaviour. Appendix B provides plenty 
of resources you can turn to.
	
Because you can choose between many different types and categories of 
stocks, virtually any investor with a long-term perspective should add stocks 
to his or her investment portfolio. Whether you want to save for your child’s 
university fund or for future retirement goals, carefully selected stocks have 
proven to be a superior long-term investment for multitudes of Canadians.
Investing for a Purpose
When the lady was asked why she bungee jumped off the bridge that 
spanned a massive ravine, she answered, “Because it’s fun!” When someone 
asked the fellow why he dove into a pool that was chock-full of alligators and 
snakes, he responded, “Because someone pushed me.” Your investment in 
stocks shouldn’t happen unless you have a purpose that you understand, like 
investing for growth or investing for income. Even if an adviser pushes you 
to invest, be sure she gives you an explanation of how that stock choice fits 
your purpose before you dive in.
We know of a very nice, elderly lady who had a portfolio brimming with 
aggressive-growth stocks because she had an overbearing broker. Her pur­
pose should’ve been conservative, and she should’ve chosen investments 
that would preserve her wealth rather than grow it. Obviously, the broker’s 
agenda got in the way. Stocks are just a means to an end. Figure out your 
desired end and then match the means. To find out more about dealing with 
brokers, see Chapter 7.
Making loads of money quickly: 
Growth investing
When investors want their money to grow, they look for investments that 
appreciate in value. Appreciate is just another way of saying “grow.” If you 
have a stock that you bought for $8 per share and now its value is $30 per 
share, your investment has grown by $22 per share — that’s appreciation. 
We know we would appreciate it!

41
 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
Appreciation (also known as capital gain) is probably the number-one reason 
why people invest in stocks. Few investments have the potential to grow your 
wealth as conveniently as stocks. If you want the stock market to make you 
loads of money relatively quickly (and if you can assume some risk), head to 
Chapter 8, which takes an in-depth look at investing for growth.
	
Stocks are a great way to grow your wealth, but they’re not the only way. 
Many investors seek alternative ways to make money, but many of these 
alternative ways are more aggressive and carry significantly more risk. You 
may have heard about people who made quick fortunes in areas such as com­
modities (like wheat, pork bellies, or precious metals), options, and other 
more sophisticated investment vehicles. Keep in mind that you should limit 
risky investments to only a small portion of your portfolio, such as 10 percent 
of your investable funds. Experienced investors, however, can go as high as 
20 percent. As we mention earlier in this section, Chapter 8 goes into greater 
detail about growth investing.
Making money steadily: Income investing
Not all investors want to take on the risk that comes with making a killing. 
(Hey . . . no guts, no glory!) Some people just want to invest in the stock 
market as a means of providing a steady income. They don’t need stock 
values to go through the ceiling. Instead, they need stocks that perform well 
consistently.
If your purpose for investing in stocks is to create income, you need to 
choose stocks that pay dividends. Dividends are typically paid quarterly to 
shareholders on record.
Distinguishing between dividends and interest
Don’t confuse dividends with interest. Most people are familiar with inter­
est, because that’s how you grow your money over the years in the bank. 
The important difference is that interest is paid to creditors, and dividends 
are paid to owners (meaning shareholders — and if you own stock, you’re a 
shareholder, because stocks represent shares in a publicly traded company).
	
When you buy stock, you buy a piece of that company. When you put money 
in a bank (or when you buy bonds), you basically loan your money. You 
become a creditor, and the bank or bond issuer is the debtor and, as such, 
must eventually pay your money back to you with interest.

42
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Recognizing the importance of an income stock’s yield
When you invest for income, you have to consider your investment’s yield 
and compare it with the alternatives. The yield is an investment’s payout 
expressed as a percentage of the investment amount. Looking at the yield is a 
way to compare the income you expect to receive from one investment with 
the expected income from others. Table 3-2 shows some comparative yields.

To understand how to calculate yield, you need the following formula:
Yield = payout ÷ investment amount
Yield enables you to compare how much income you would get for a pro­
spective investment with the income you would get from other investments. 
For the sake of simplicity, this exercise is based on an annual percentage 
yield basis (compounding would increase the yield).
Jones Co. and Smith Co. are both typical dividend-paying stocks; presume in 
the example presented by Table 3-2 that both companies are similar in most 
respects except for their differing dividends. How can you tell whether a $50 
stock with a $2.50 annual dividend is better (or worse) than a $100 stock with 
a $4.00 dividend? The yield tells you.
Even though Jones Co. pays a higher dividend ($4.00), Smith Co. has a higher 
yield (5 percent). Therefore, if you had to choose between those two stocks 
as an income investor, you would choose Smith Co. Of course, if you truly 
want to maximize your income and don’t really need your investment to 
appreciate a lot, you should probably choose Brown Co.’s bond because it 
offers a yield of 6 percent.

43
 Chapter 3: Defining Common Approaches to Stock Investing
	
Dividend-paying stocks do have the ability to increase in value. They may not 
have the same growth potential as growth stocks, but at the very least they 
have a greater potential for capital gain than bank CDs or bonds. Dividend-
paying stocks (income investing) are covered in Chapter 9.
Investing for Your Personal Style
Your investing style isn’t a blue-jeans-versus-three-piece-suit debate. It refers 
to your approach to stock investing. Do you want to be conservative or 
aggressive? Would you rather be the tortoise or the hare? Your investment 
personality greatly depends on the term over which you’re planning to invest 
and on your purpose (refer to the previous two sections in this chapter). The 
following sections outline the two most general investment styles.
Conservative investing
Conservative investing means that you put your money in something proven, 
tried, and true. You invest your money in safe and secure places, such as 
chartered banks and government-backed securities. But how does that apply 
to stocks? (Table 3-1 gives you suggestions.)
Conservative stock investors want to place their money in companies that 
exhibit some of the following qualities:
	
✓	Proven performance: You want companies that show increasing sales 
and earnings year after year. You don’t demand anything spectacular, 
just a strong and steady performance.
	
✓	Market size: Companies should be large cap (short for large capitalization). 
In other words, they should have a market value exceeding $10 billion in 
size. Conservative investors surmise that bigger is safer.
	
✓	Market leadership: Companies should be leaders in their industries.
	
✓	Perceived staying power: You want companies with the financial clout 
and market position to weather uncertain market and economic condi­
tions. It shouldn’t matter what happens in the economy or who gets 
elected as prime minister.
	
As a conservative investor, you don’t mind if the companies’ share prices 
jump (who would?), but you’re more concerned with steady growth over the 
long term.

44
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Aggressive investing
Aggressive investors can plan over the long term or look only to the inter­
mediate term, but in any case they want stocks that resemble Aesop’s fabled 
hare — they show the potential to break out of the pack.
Aggressive stock investors want to invest their money in companies that 
exhibit some of the following qualities:
	
✓	Great potential: The company must have superior goods, services, 
ideas, or ways of doing business compared to its competition.
	
✓	Capital gains possibility: You don’t even consider dividends. If any­
thing, you dislike dividends. You feel that the money that would’ve been 
dispensed in dividend form is better reinvested in the company. This, in 
turn, can spur greater growth.
	
✓	Innovation: Companies should have technologies, ideas, or innovative 
methods that make them stand apart from other companies.
	
Aggressive investors usually seek out small-capitalization stocks, known as 
small caps, because they have plenty of potential for growth. Take the tree 
example, for instance: A giant redwood may be strong but may not grow much 
more, whereas a brand-new sapling has plenty of growth to look forward to. 
Why invest in stodgy, big companies when you can invest in smaller enter­
prises that may become the leaders of tomorrow? Aggressive investors have 
no problem investing in obscure companies because they hope that such com­
panies will become another IBM, CN, or Research In Motion. Find out more 
about growth investing in Chapter 8.

Recognizing the Risks

I
nvestors face many risks, most of which we cover in this chapter. The 
simplest definition of risk for investors is “the possibility that your invest­
ment will lose some (or all) of its value.” Yet you don’t have to fear risk if you 
understand it and plan for it. You must understand the oldest equation in the 
world of investing — risk versus return. This equation states the following:
If you want a greater return on your money, you need to tolerate more 
risk. If you don’t want to tolerate more risk, you must tolerate a lower 
rate of return.
This point about risk is best illustrated from a moment in one of Paul’s invest­
ment seminars. One of the attendees told Paul that he had his money in the 
bank but was dissatisfied with the rate of return. He lamented, “The yield on 
my money is pitiful! I want to put my money somewhere where it can grow.” 
Paul asked him, “How about investing in common stocks? Or what about 
growth mutual funds? They have a solid, long-term growth track record.” He 
responded, “Stocks? I don’t want to put my money there. It’s too risky!” Okay, 
then. If you don’t want to tolerate more risk, then don’t complain about earn­
ing less on your money. Risk (in all its forms) has a bearing on all your money 
concerns and goals. That’s why it’s so important that you understand risk 
before you invest.
This man — as well as the rest of us — needs to remember that risk is not a 
four-letter word. (Well, it is a four-letter word, but you know what we mean.) 
Risk is present no matter what you do with your money. Even if you simply 
stick your money in your mattress, risk is involved — several kinds of risk, in 

46
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
fact. You have the risk of fire. What if your house burns down? You have the risk 
of theft. What if burglars find your stash of cash? You also have relative 
risk. (In other words, what if your relatives find your money?)
Be aware of the different kinds of risk we describe in this chapter, and you 
can easily plan around them to keep your money growing.
Exploring Different Kinds of Risk
Think about all the ways that an investment can lose money. You can list all 
sorts of possibilities. So many that you may think, “Holy cow! Why invest 
at all?”
Don’t let risk frighten you. After all, life itself is risky. Just make sure that you 
understand the different kinds of risk that we discuss in the following sections 
before you start navigating the investment world. Be mindful of risk and find 
out about the effects of risk on your investments and personal financial goals.
Financial risk
The financial risk of stock investing is that you can lose your money if the 
company whose stock you purchase loses money or goes belly up. This type 
of risk is the most obvious, because companies do go bankrupt.
	
You can greatly enhance the chances of your financial risk paying off by doing 
an adequate amount of research and choosing your stocks carefully (which 
this book helps you do — see Part III for details). Financial risk is a real con­
cern even when the economy is doing well. Some diligent research, a little 
planning, and a dose of common sense help you reduce your financial risk.
In the stock investing mania of the late 1990s, millions of investors (along 
with many well-known investment gurus) ignored some obvious financial 
risks of many then-popular stocks. Investors blindly plunked their money 
into stocks that were bad choices. Consider investors who put their money 
into 360 Networks, a Canadian company involved in the build-out of fiber 
optic networks. This company had no profit, was poorly-run, and was way 

47
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
over-indebted. The financial condition of 360 Networks soon went into a full 
spin and it collapsed in late 2001. Anyone holding shares soon found that 
they were worthless as the company was delisted from the Toronto Stock 
Exchange. Canadian investors had lost millions.
Internet and tech stocks littered the graveyard of stock market catastrophes 
during 2000–01 because investors didn’t see (or perhaps didn’t want to see) 
the risks involved with companies that didn’t offer a solid record of results 
(profits, sales, and so on). When you invest in companies that don’t have a 
proven track record, you’re not investing, you’re speculating.
Fast forward to 2007–08. New risks abound as the headlines rail on about the 
credit crisis on Wall Street and the subprime fiasco in the wake of the U.S. 
housing bubble popping. Think about how this crisis impacted investors 
worldwide as the market went through its stomach-churning roller-coaster 
ride. A good example of a casualty you didn’t want to be part of was the U.S. 
investment bank Bear Stearns (BSC), which was caught in the subprime buzz 
saw. Bear Stearns was sky-high at $170 a share in early 2007, yet it crashed to 
$2 a share by March 2008. Yikes! Its problems arose from massive overexpo­
sure to bad debt, and investors could have done some research — the public 
data were revealing! — and avoided the stock entirely. Fast forward even 
further to 2009. As you have undoubtedly heard, Bear Stearns was ultimately 
joined by scores of similar and well-known companies in severe distress. 
Almost all were jockeying for government bailouts.
Investors who did their homework regarding the financial conditions of com­
panies such as the Internet startups (and later Bear Stearns, among others) 
would have discovered that these companies had the hallmarks of financial 
risk — high debt, low (or no) earnings, and plenty of competition. They 
steered clear, avoiding tremendous financial loss. Investors who didn’t do their 
homework were lured by the status of these companies and lost their shirts.
Of course, the individual investors who lost money by investing in these 
trendy, high-profile companies don’t deserve all the responsibility for their 
tremendous financial losses; many high-profile analysts and media sources 
also should have known better. This decade may someday be a case study 
of how euphoria and the herd mentality (rather than good, old-fashioned 
research and common sense) ruled the day (temporarily). The excitement of 
making potential fortunes gets the best of people sometimes, and they throw 
caution to the wind. Historians may look back at those days and say, “What 
were they thinking?” Achieving true wealth takes diligent work and careful 
analysis.

48

In terms of financial risk, the bottom line is . . . well . . . the bottom line! A 
healthy bottom line means that a company is making money. And if a com­
pany is making money, then you can make money by investing in its stock. 
However, if a company isn’t making money, you won’t make money if you 
invest in it. Profit is the lifeblood of any company. See Chapter 12 for the 
scoop on determining whether a company’s bottom line is healthy.
Interest-rate risk
	
You can lose money in an apparently sound investment because of something 
that sounds as harmless as “interest rates have changed.” Interest-rate risk 
may sound like an odd type of risk, but in fact it’s a common consideration 
for investors. Be aware that interest rates change on a regular basis, causing 
some challenging moments. Banks set interest rates, and the primary institu­
tions to watch closely are the Bank of Canada and the Federal Reserve (the 
Fed) in the U.S., which are, in effect, national central banks. Both institutions 
raise or lower their interest rates, actions that in turn cause banks to raise or 
lower interest rates accordingly. Interest-rate changes affect consumers, busi­
nesses, and, of course, investors.
Here’s a generic introduction to the way fluctuating interest-rate risk can 
affect investors in general: Suppose you buy a long-term, high-quality corpo­
rate bond and get a yield of 6 percent. Your money is safe, and your return is 
locked in at 6 percent. Whew! That’s 6 percent. Not bad, huh? But what hap­
pens if, after you commit your money, interest rates increase to 8 percent? 
You lose the opportunity to get that extra 2 percent interest. The only way to 
get out of your 6 percent bond is to sell it at current market values and use 
the money to reinvest at the higher rate.
The only problem with this scenario is that the 6 percent bond is likely to 
drop in value because interest rates rose. Why? Say that the investor is Bob 
and the bond yielding 6 percent is a corporate bond issued by Lucin-Muny 
(LM). According to the bond agreement, LM must pay 6 percent (called the 
face rate or nominal rate) during the life of the bond and then, upon maturity, 
pay the principal. If Bob buys $10,000 of LM bonds on the day they’re issued, 
he gets $600 (of interest) every year for as long as he holds the bonds. If he 
holds on until maturity, he gets back his $10,000 (the principal). So far so 
good, right? The plot thickens, however.
Say that he decides to sell the bond long before maturity and that, at the time 
of the sale, interest rates in the market have risen to 8 percent. Now what? 
The reality is that no one is going to want his 6 percent bond if the market is 
offering bonds at 8 percent. What’s Bob to do? He can’t change the face rate 
of 6 percent, and he can’t change the fact that only $600 is paid each year 

49
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
for the life of the bond. What has to change so that current investors get 
the equivalent yield of 8 percent? If you said, “The bond’s value has to go 
down” . . . bingo! In this example, the bond’s market value needs to drop to 
$7,500 so that investors buying the bond get an equivalent yield of 8 percent. 
(For simplicity’s sake, I left out the time it takes for the bond to mature.) 
Here’s how that figures:
New investors still get $600 annually. However, $600 is equal to 8 percent of 
$7,500. Therefore, even though investors get the face rate of 6 percent, they 
get a yield of 8 percent because the actual investment amount is $7,500. In 
this example, little, if any, financial risk is present, but you see how interest 
rate risk presents itself. Bob finds out that you can have a good company 
with a good bond, yet you still lose $2,500 because of the change in the inter­
est rate. Of course, if Bob doesn’t sell, he doesn’t realize that loss. (For more 
on the how and why of selling your stock, review Chapter 20.)
	
Historically, rising interest rates have had an adverse effect on stock prices. 
We outline several reasons why in the following sections. Because Canada and 
especially the U.S. are top-heavy in debt, rising interest rates are an obvious 
risk that threatens both stocks and fixed-income securities (such as bonds).
Hurting a company’s financial condition
Rising interest rates have a negative impact on companies that carry a large 
current debt load or that need to take on more debt, because when interest 
rates rise, the cost of borrowing money rises, too. Ultimately, the company’s 
profitability and ability to grow are reduced. When a company’s profits (or 
earnings) drop, its stock becomes less desirable, and its stock price falls.
Affecting a company’s customers
A company’s success comes when it sells its products or services. But what 
happens if increased interest rates negatively impact its customers (specifi­
cally, other companies that buy from it)? The financial health of its custom­
ers directly affects the company’s ability to grow sales and earnings.
For a good example, consider Magna International (MGA) during 2007–09. 
The company had soaring sales and earnings during several years leading 
up to 2007 as the North American automotive industry continued brisk sales 
of cars and needed automotive parts from Magna. After 2007, the worldwide 
automotive industry entered a steep slowdown in sales (due to the global 
credit crisis, tighter auto loan credit requirements, rising interest rates, 
and so on). Investors took special notice of the fact that almost all automo­
tive sector companies had loads of debt on their balance sheets. This debt, 
including interest, had to be paid off. The entire auto sector went into an 

50
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
agonizing decline, and the fortunes of Magna followed suit because its suc­
cess is directly tied to auto sales. By late 2008, Magna’s sales were slipping 
and earnings were dropping as the automotive industry sank deeper into its 
depression. This was bad news for stock investors. Magna’s stock went from 
more than $96 in 2007 to $20 by March 2009. Ouch! The brakes didn’t quite 
work that time.
Affecting investors’ decision-making considerations
When interest rates rise, investors start to rethink their investment strate­
gies, resulting in one of two outcomes:
	
✓	Investors may sell any shares in interest-sensitive stocks that they 
hold. Interest-sensitive industries include real estate, the debt-saddled 
automotive sector, and the very sickly U.S. financial sector. Although 
increased interest rates can hurt these sectors, the reverse is also gener­
ally true: Falling interest rates boost the same industries. Keep in mind 
that interest rate changes affect some industries more than others.
	
✓	Investors who favour increased current income (versus waiting for the 
investment to grow in value to sell for a gain later on) are definitely 
attracted to investment vehicles that offer a higher yield. Higher interest 
rates can cause investors to switch from stocks to bonds or GICs.
Hurting stock prices indirectly
High or rising interest rates can have a negative impact on any investor’s total 
financial picture. What happens when an investor struggles with burdensome 
debt, such as a second mortgage, credit card debt, or margin debt (debt from 
borrowing against stock in a brokerage account)? He may sell some stock 
to pay off some of his high-interest debt. Selling stock to service debt is a 
common practice that, when taken collectively, can hurt stock prices.
As this book goes to press, the stock market and the U.S. economy face 
perhaps the greatest challenge since the Great Depression — debt. Because 
Canada’s fortunes are tied to the U.S., the same is somewhat true for us. In 
terms of gross domestic product (GDP), the size of the U.S. economy is about 
$15 trillion (give or take $100 billion), but the debt level is about $57 trillion 
(this includes personal, corporate, mortgage, and government debt). (In 
Canada, the amounts are about one-tenth as much.) This already enormous 
amount doesn’t include $55 trillion of government employment insurance, 
welfare, and health care liabilities. Additionally (yikes! there’s more?), some 
U.S. financial institutions hold more than $100 trillion worth of derivatives — 
very complicated and sophisticated investment vehicles that can backfire. 
Derivatives have, in fact, sunk some large organizations (such as Enron and 
Bear Stearns), and investors should beware of them. Just check out the com­
pany’s financial reports. (Find out more in Chapter 13.)

51
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
	
Because of the effects of interest rates on stock portfolios, both direct and 
indirect, successful investors regularly monitor interest rates in both the gen­
eral economy and in their personal situations. Although stocks have proven to 
be a superior long-term investment (the longer the term, the better), every 
investor should maintain a balanced portfolio that includes other investment 
vehicles. A diversified investor has some money in vehicles that do well when 
interest rates rise. These vehicles include money market funds, variable-rate 
GICs, and other variable-rate investments whose interest rates rise when 
market rates rise. These types of investments add a measure of safety from 
interest rate risk to your stock portfolio. (We discuss diversification in more 
detail later in this chapter.)
Market risk
People talk about “the market” and how it goes up or down, making it sound 
like a monolithic entity instead of what it really is — a group of millions 
of individuals making daily decisions to buy or sell stock. No matter how 
modern our society and economic system, you can’t escape the laws of 
supply and demand. When masses of people want to buy a particular stock, it 
becomes in demand, and its price rises. That price rises higher if the supply 
is limited. Conversely, if no one’s interested in buying a stock, its price falls. 
Supply and demand is the nature of market risk. The price of the stock you 
purchase can rise and fall on the fickle whim of market demand.
Millions of investors buying and selling each minute of every trading day 
affect the share price of your stock. This fact makes it impossible to judge 
which way your stock will move tomorrow, or next week. This unpredictabil­
ity and seeming irrationality is why stocks aren’t appropriate for short-term 
financial growth.
A good example of market risk with a stock is Apple (AAPL). Had you bought 
AAPL in January 2007, you could have gotten it for about $75 a share and 
watched it rise joyfully upward to hit $205 a share by December. At that point 
some giddy investor may be thinking, “It’s time to pop the champagne!” Hold 
on a second! Within three months of that top, AAPL had a dizzying plunge to 
under $120 by March 2008. It’s typical for stocks to take a relatively long time 
to climb, but they can fall in a relatively short time. In that example, a long-
term, patient investor would still be up, but some short-term folks who jump 
in and jump out would have been burned.
Markets are volatile by nature; they go up and down, and investments need 
time to grow. Market volatility is an increasingly common condition that we 
have to live with. Investors should be aware of the fact that stocks in general 
(especially in today’s marketplace) aren’t suitable for short-term goals (one 

52
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
year or less; see Chapters 2 and 3 for more on short-term goals). Despite the 
fact that companies you’re invested in may be fundamentally sound, all stock 
prices are subject to the gyrations of the marketplace and need time to trend 
upward.
	
Investing requires diligent work and research before putting your money in 
quality investments with a long-term perspective. Speculating is attempting to 
make a relatively quick profit by monitoring the short-term price movements 
of a particular investment. Investors seek to minimize risk, whereas specula­
tors don’t mind risk because it can also magnify profits. Speculating and 
investing have clear differences, but investors frequently become speculators 
and ultimately put themselves and their wealth at risk. Don’t go there!
Consider the married couple nearing retirement who decided to play with 
their money to see about making their pending retirement more comfortable. 
They borrowed a sizable sum by tapping into their home equity to invest in 
the stock market. (Their home, which they had paid off, had enough equity 
to qualify for this loan.) What did they do with these funds? You guessed it: 
they invested in the high-flying stocks of the day, which were high-tech and 
Internet stocks. Within eight months, they lost almost all their money.
	
Understanding market risk is especially important for people who are tempted 
to put their nest eggs or emergency funds into volatile investments such as 
growth stocks (or mutual funds that invest in growth stocks, or similar aggres­
sive investment vehicles). Remember, you can lose everything.
Inflation risk
Inflation is the artificial expansion of the quantity of money so that too much 
money is used in exchange for goods and services. To consumers, inflation 
shows up in the form of higher prices for goods and services. Inflation risk 
is also referred to as purchasing power risk. This term just means that your 
money doesn’t buy as much as it used to. For example, a dollar that bought 
you a sandwich in 1980 barely bought you a candy bar a few years later. For 
you, the investor, this risk means that the value of your investment (a stock 
that doesn’t appreciate much, for example) may not keep up with inflation.
Say you have money in a bank savings account currently earning 4 percent. 
This account has flexibility — if the market interest rate goes up, the rate 
you earn in your account goes up. Your account is safe from both financial 
risk and interest-rate risk. But what if inflation is running at 5 percent? At that 
point you’re losing money.

53
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
At the time of this writing, inflation is a very real and a very serious concern 
and it should not be ignored. We deal more with inflation in Chapter 10.
Tax risk
	
Taxes (such as income tax or capital gains tax) don’t affect your stock invest­
ment directly. Taxes can obviously affect how much of your money you get to 
keep. Because the entire point of stock investing is to build wealth, you need 
to understand that taxes take away a portion of the wealth that you’re trying 
to build. Taxes can be risky because if you make the wrong move with your 
stocks (selling them at the wrong time, for example) you can end up paying 
higher taxes than you need to. Because Canadian tax laws change so fre­
quently, tax risk is part of the risk-versus-return equation, as well.
It pays to gain knowledge about how the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) rules 
can affect your wealth-building program before you make your investment 
decisions. Chapter 22 covers the impact of taxes in greater detail.
Political and governmental risks
If companies were fish, politics and government policies (such as taxes, laws, 
and regulations) would be the pond. In the same way that fish die in a toxic 
or polluted pond, politics and government policies can kill companies. Of 
course, if you own stock in a company exposed to political and governmental 
risks, you need to be aware of these risks. For some companies, a single new 
regulation or law is enough to send them into bankruptcy. For other compa­
nies, a new law could help them increase sales and profits.
What if you invest in companies or industries that become political targets? 
You may want to consider selling them (you can always buy them back later) 
or consider putting in stop-loss orders on the stock (see Chapter 21). For 
example, tobacco companies were the targets of political firestorms that 
battered their stock prices. Whether you agree or disagree with the political 
machinations of today is not the issue. As an investor, you have to ask your­
self, “How does politics affect the market value and the current and future 
prospects of my chosen investment?” (See Chapter 11 for more on how poli­
tics can affect the stock market.)
Taking the preceding point a step further, we’d like to remind you that 
politics and government have a direct and often negative impact on the 
economic environment. And one major pitfall for investors is that many mis­
understand even basic economics. Considering all the examples we could 

54
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
find in recent years, we could write a book! Or . . . uh . . . simply add it to this 
book. Chapter 10 goes into greater detail to help you make (and keep) stock 
market profits just by understanding rudimentary (and quite interesting) eco­
nomics. (Don’t worry; we keep the dry stuff to a minimum!)
Personal risks
Frequently, the risk involved with investing in the stock market may not be 
directly involved with the investment or factors related to the investment; 
sometimes the risk is with the investor’s circumstances.
Suppose that investor Ralph puts $15,000 into a portfolio of common stocks. 
Imagine that the market experiences a drop in prices that week and Ralph’s 
stocks drop to a market value of $14,000. Because stocks are good for the 
long term, this type of decrease is usually not an alarming incident. Odds are 
that this dip is temporary, especially if Ralph carefully chose high-quality 
companies. Incidentally, if a portfolio of high-quality stocks does experience a 
temporary drop in price, it can be a great opportunity to get more shares at a 
good price. (Chapter 21 covers orders you can place with your broker to help 
you do that.)
Over the long term, Ralph would probably see the value of his investment 
grow substantially. But what if, during a period when his stocks are declining, 
Ralph experiences financial difficulty and needs quick cash? He may have to 
sell his stock to get some money.
This problem occurs frequently for investors who don’t have an emergency 
fund or a rainy-day fund to handle large, sudden expenses. You never know 
when your company may lay you off or when your basement may flood, leav­
ing you with a huge repair bill. Car accidents, emergency repairs, and other 
unforeseen events are part of life’s bag of surprises — for anyone.
	
You probably won’t get much comfort from knowing that stock losses are tax 
deductible — a loss is a loss (see Chapter 22 for more on taxes). However, you 
can avoid the kind of loss that results from prematurely having to sell your 
stocks if you maintain an emergency cash fund. A good place for your emer­
gency cash fund is in either a bank savings account or a money market fund. 
Then you aren’t forced to prematurely liquidate your stock investments to pay 
emergency bills. (Chapter 2 provides more guidance on having liquid assets 
for emergencies.)

55
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Emotional risk
	
What does emotional risk have to do with stocks? Emotions are important risk 
considerations because the main decision makers are human beings. Logic 
and discipline are critical factors in investment success, but even the best 
investor can let emotions take over the reins of money management and cause 
loss. For stock investing, you’re likely to be sidetracked by three main emo­
tions: greed, fear, and love. You need to understand your emotions and what 
kinds of risk they can expose you to. If you get too attached to a sinking stock, 
then you don’t need a stock investing book — you need Dr. Phil!
Paying the price for greed
In 1998–2000, millions of investors threw caution to the wind and chased 
highly dubious, risky dot-com stocks. The dollar signs popped up in their 
eyes (just like slot machines) when they saw that easy street was lined with 
dot-com stocks that were doubling and tripling in a very short time. Who 
cares about price/earnings (P/E) ratios and earnings when you can just buy 
stock, make a fortune, and get out with millions? (Of course, you care about 
making money with stocks, so you can refer to Appendix A to find out more 
about P/E ratios.)
Unfortunately, the lure of the easy buck can easily turn healthy attitudes 
about growing wealth into unhealthy greed that blinds investors and discards 
common sense (such as investing for quick short-term gains in dubious hot 
stocks rather than doing your homework and buying stocks of solid companies 
with strong fundamentals and a long-term focus, as we explain in Part III).
Recognizing the role of fear
Greed can be a problem, but fear is the other extreme. People who are fear­
ful of loss frequently avoid suitable investments and end up settling for a low 
rate of return. If you have to succumb to one of these emotions, at least fear 
exposes you to less loss.
Also, keep in mind that fear is frequently a symptom of lack of knowledge 
about what’s going on. If you see your stocks falling and don’t understand 
why, fear will take over and you may act irrationally. When stock investors 
are affected by fear, the tendency is to sell their stocks and head for the exits 
and/or the life boats. When an investor sees his stock go down 20 percent, 
what goes through his head? Experienced, knowledgeable investors see that 
no bull market goes straight up. Even the strongest bull goes up in a zigzag 
fashion. Conversely, even bear markets don’t go straight down, they zigzag 
down. Out of fear, inexperienced investors will sell good stocks if they see 
them go down temporarily (the “correction”), while experienced investors 
see that temporary down move as a good buying opportunity to add to their 
positions.

Looking for love in all the wrong places
Stocks are dispassionate, inanimate vehicles, but people can look for love in 
the strangest places. Emotional risk occurs when investors fall in love with 
a stock and refuse to sell it, even when the stock is plummeting and shows 
all the symptoms of getting worse. Emotional risk also occurs when inves­
tors are drawn to bad investment choices just because they sound good, are 
popular, or are pushed by family or friends. Love and attachment are great in 
relationships with people but can be horrible with investments. To deal with 
this emotion, investors have to deploy techniques that take the emotion out. 
For example, you can use brokerage orders (such as trailing stops and limit 
orders), which can automatically trigger buy and sell transactions and leave 
some of the agonizing out. Hey, disciplined investing may just become your 
new passion!
Minimizing Your Risk
Now, before you go crazy thinking that stock investing carries so much risk 
you may as well not get out of bed, take a breath. Minimizing your risk in stock 
investing is easier than you think. Although wealth building through the stock 
market doesn’t take place without some amount of risk, you can practise the 
following tips to maximize your profits and still keep your money secure.
Gaining knowledge
Some people spend more time analyzing a restaurant menu to choose a $10 
entrée than analyzing where to put their next $5,000. Lack of knowledge consti­
tutes the greatest risk for new investors, but diminishing that risk starts with 
gaining knowledge. The more familiar you are with the stock market — how it 
works, factors that affect stock value, and so on — the better you can navigate 
around its pitfalls and maximize your profits. The same knowledge that enables 
you to grow your wealth also enables you to minimize your risk. Before you 
put your money anywhere, you want to know as much as you can. This book 
is a great place to start — check out Chapter 6 for a rundown of the kinds of 
information you want to know before you buy stocks, as well as the resources 
that can give you the information you need to invest successfully.
Staying out until you get a little practice
If you don’t understand stocks, don’t invest! Yeah, we know this book is 
about stock investing, and we think that some measure of stock investing is a 
good idea for most people. But that doesn’t mean you should be 100 percent 
invested 100 percent of the time. If you don’t understand a particular stock (or 
don’t understand stocks, period), stay away until you do understand. Instead, 

57
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
give yourself an imaginary sum of money, such as $100,000, give yourself 
reasons to invest, and just make believe (an exercise called “simulated stock 
investing or trading”). Pick a few stocks that you think will increase in value, 
track them for a while, and see how they perform. Begin to understand how the 
price of a stock goes up and down, and watch what happens to the stocks you 
choose when various events take place. As you find out more and more about 
stock investing, you get better and better at picking individual stocks, and you 
haven’t risked — or lost — any money during your learning period.
	
A good place to do your imaginary investing is at Web sites such as 
Marketocracy (www.marketocracy.com) and Investopedia’s simulator 
(http://simulator.investopedia.com). You can design a stock portfo­
lio and track its performance with thousands of other investors to see how 
well you do.
Putting your financial house in order
Advice on what to do before you invest could fill a whole book all by itself. 
The bottom line is that you want to make sure you are, first and foremost, 
financially secure before you take the plunge into the stock market. If you’re 
not sure about your financial security, look over your situation with a finan­
cial planner. (You can find more on financial planners in Appendix B.)
	
Before you buy your first stock, here are a few things you can do to get your 
finances in order:
	
✓	Have a cushion of money. Set aside three to six months’ worth of your 
gross living expenses somewhere safe, such as in a bank account or 
money market fund, in case you suddenly need cash for an emergency 
(see Chapter 2 for details).
	
✓	Reduce your debt. Overindulging in debt was the worst personal eco­
nomic problem for many Canadians in the late 1990s, and this has con­
tinued in recent years. When the U.S. housing bubble popped, millions 
of foreclosures were the result as homeowners piled on too much debt. 
In Canada, foreclosures and powers of sale have also increased, but not 
as dramatically as in the U.S.
	
✓	Make sure your job is as secure as you can make it. Are you keeping 
your skills up to date? Is the company you work for strong and growing? 
Is the industry you work in strong and growing?
	
✓	Make sure you have adequate insurance. You need enough supple­
mental insurance to cover you and your family’s needs in case of illness, 
death, disability, and so on. Although Canada’s provincial health care 
plans cover many medical expenses, they may not be enough for certain 
types of illnesses.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Diversifying your investments
	
Diversification is a strategy for reducing risk by spreading your money across 
different investments. It’s a fancy way of saying, “Don’t put all your eggs in one 
basket.” But how do you go about divvying up your money and distributing it 
among different investments? The easiest way to understand proper diversifi­
cation may be to look at what you shouldn’t do:
	
✓	Don’t put all your money in one stock. Sure, if you choose wisely and 
select a hot stock you may make a bundle, but the odds are tremen­
dously against you. Unless you’re a real expert on a particular company, 
it’s a good idea to have small portions of your money in several different 
stocks. As a general rule, the money you tie up in a single stock should 
be money you can do without.
	
✓	Don’t put all your money in one industry. We know people who own 
several stocks, but the stocks are all in the same industry. Again, if 
you’re an expert in that particular industry, it could work out. But just 
understand that you’re not properly diversified. If a problem hits an 
entire industry, you may get hurt.
	
✓	Don’t put all your money in one type of investment. Stocks may be a 
great investment, but you need to have money elsewhere too. Bonds, 
bank accounts, Treasury securities, real estate, and precious metals 
are perennial alternatives to complement your stock portfolio. Some 
of these alternatives can be found in mutual funds or exchange-traded 
funds (ETFs). An exchange-traded fund is a fund with a fixed portfolio 
of stocks or other securities that tracks a particular index but is traded 
like a stock. Check out Globe Investor (www.globeinvestor.com/
partners/free/etf/) for more information about Canadian ETFs.
	
Okay, now that you know what you shouldn’t do, what should you do? Until 
you become more knowledgeable, follow this advice:
	
✓	Keep only 10 percent (or less) of your investment money in a single stock.
	
✓	Invest in four or five (and no more than ten) different stocks that are 
in different industries. Which industries? Choose industries that offer 
products and services that have shown strong, growing demand. To 
make this decision, use your common sense (which isn’t as common as 
it used to be). Think about the industries that people need no matter 
what happens in the general economy, such as food, energy, and other 
consumer necessities. See Chapter 17 for more information about ana­
lyzing industries.

59
 Chapter 4: Recognizing the Risks
Weighing Risk against Return
How much risk is appropriate for you, and how do you handle it? Before you 
try to figure out what risks accompany your investment choices, analyze 
yourself. Here are some points to keep in mind when weighing risk versus 
return in your situation:
	
✓	Your financial goal: In five minutes with a financial calculator, you can 
easily see how much money you’re going to need to become financially 
independent (presuming financial independence is your goal). Say that 
you need $500,000 in ten years for a worry-free retirement and that your 
financial assets (such as stocks, bonds, and so on) are currently worth 
$400,000. In this scenario, your assets need to grow by only 2.25 percent 
to hit your target. Getting investments that grow by 2.25 percent safely 
is easy to do because that’s a relatively low rate of return.
	
	The important point is that you don’t have to knock yourself out trying 
to double your money with risky, high-flying investments; some run-
of-the-mill bank investments will do just fine. All too often, investors 
take on more risk than is necessary. Figure out what your financial goal 
is so that you know what kind of return you realistically need. Flip to 
Chapters 2 and 3 for details on determining your financial goals.
	
✓	Your investor profile: Are you nearing retirement, or are you fresh out 
of college? Your life situation matters when it comes to looking at risk 
versus return.
 
• If you’re just beginning your working years, you can certainly toler­
ate greater risk than someone facing retirement. Even if you lose 
big time, you still have a long time to recoup your money and get 
back on track.
Better luck next time!
A little knowledge can be very risky. Consider 
the true story of one “lucky” fellow who played 
the lottery in 1987. He discovered that he had a 
winning ticket, with the first prize of $412,000. 
He immediately ordered a Porsche, booked a 
lavish trip to Hawaii for his family, and treated 
his wife and friends to a champagne dinner at 
a posh Hollywood restaurant. When he finally 
went to collect his prize, he found out that he 
had to share first prize with over 9,000 other 
lottery players who also had the same winning 
numbers. His share of the prize was actually 
only $45! Hopefully, he invested that tidy sum 
based on his increased knowledge about risk.

60
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
 
• However, if you’re within five years of retirement, risky or aggres­
sive investments can do much more harm than good. If you lose 
money, you don’t have as much time to recoup your investment, 
and the odds are that you’ll need the investment money (and its 
income-generating capacity) to cover your living expenses after 
you’re no longer employed.
	
✓	Asset allocation: We never tell retirees to put a large portion of their 
retirement money into a high-tech stock or other volatile investment. 
But if they still want to speculate, we don’t see a problem as long as they 
limit such investments to 5 percent of their total assets. As long as the 
bulk of their money is safe and sound in secure investments (such as 
Canada Savings Bonds), we can sleep well (knowing that they can sleep 
well!).
	
	Asset allocation harkens back to diversification, which we discuss ear­
lier in this chapter. For people in their 20s and 30s, having 75 percent of 
their money in a diversified portfolio of growth stocks (such as mid-cap 
and small-cap stocks; see Chapter 1) is acceptable. For people in their 
60s and 70s, it’s not acceptable. They may, instead, consider investing 
no more than 20 percent of their money in stocks (mid caps and large 
caps are preferable). Check with your financial adviser to find the right 
mix for your particular situation.

the Market with Indexes
In This Chapter
▶	Defining index basics
▶	Looking at the Dow and other indexes
▶	Exploring indexes for practical use
“H
ow’s the market doing today?” is the most common question that 
interested parties ask about the stock market. “What did the Dow 
do?” “How about Nasdaq?” “The TSX?” Invariably, people asking those ques­
tions expect an answer regarding how well the market performed that day. 
“Well, the Dow fell 157 points to 12,500, while the TSX was unchanged at 
8,749.” The Dow, Nasdaq, and TSX are indexes, statistical measures that rep­
resent the value of a batch of stocks. You can use indexes as general gauges 
of stock market activity. From them, you get a basic idea of how well (or how 
poorly) the overall market (or a portion of it) is doing. In this chapter, we 
focus our attention on the major North American stock market indexes and 
how to use them.
Knowing How Indexes Are Measured
	
The oldest stock market index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA, or 
simply “the Dow”), which was created by Charles Dow (of Dow Jones fame) 
in 1896. The Dow covered only 12 stocks then, but the number increased to 
30 stocks in 1928, and it remains the same to this day. Because Dow worked 
long before the age of computers, he kept the calculations of his stock market 
index simple and did them arithmetically by hand. Dow added up the stock 
prices of the 12 companies and then divided the sum by 12. Technically, this 
number is an average and not an index (hence the word “average” in the 
name). For simplicity’s sake, we refer to it as an index. Besides, the number 
gets tweaked nowadays to account for things such as stock splits. (For more 
on stock splits, see Chapter 15.)

62
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
However, indexes and averages get calculated differently. The primary differ­
ence is the concept of weighting. Weighting refers to the relative importance of 
the items when they’re computed within the index. Several kinds of indexes 
exist, including:
	
✓	Price-weighted index: This index tracks changes based on the change 
in the individual stock’s price per share. For example, suppose you 
own two stocks: Stock A, worth $20 per share, and Stock B, worth $40 
per share. A price-weighted index allocates a greater proportion of the 
index to the stock at $40 than to the one at $20. If the index contained 
only these two stocks, the index number would reflect the $40 stock as 
being 67 percent (two-thirds of the total), while the $20 stock would be 
33 percent (one-third of the total). The Dow is a good example of a price-
weighted index.
	
✓	Market-value-weighted index: This index, also known as a capitalization-
weighted index, tracks the proportion of a stock based on its market 
capitalization (or market value, also called market cap).
	
	Say that in your portfolio, you have 10 million shares of a $20 stock 
(Stock A) and 1 million shares of a $40 stock (Stock B). Stock A’s market 
cap is $200 million, while Stock B’s market cap is $40 million. Therefore, 
in a market-value-weighted index, Stock A represents 83 percent of 
the index’s value because of its much larger market cap. Examples of 
market-value-weighted indexes are the Nasdaq Composite Index and the 
S&P/TSX Composite Index. (We discuss the Nasdaq and the S&P/TSX 
indexes later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Broad-based index: The sample portfolios in the preceding bullets 
show only two stocks — obviously not a good representative index. 
Most investing professionals (especially money managers and mutual 
fund firms) use a broad-based index as a benchmark to compare their 
progress. A broad-based index provides a snapshot of the entire market. 
The S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 are good examples of broad-based 
indexes (they also happen to be market-value-weighted indexes; see 
descriptions of both indexes later in this chapter).
	
✓	Composite index: This index is a combination of several averages or 
indexes. An example is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite, 
which tracks all the stocks on the NYSE. Another example is the Nasdaq 
Composite Index, which is a market-capitalization composite index of 
3,000 companies on Nasdaq.
	
✓	Performance-based index: This index includes not only the apprecia­
tion of the stocks represented in the index but also the dividends (and 
other cash payouts) issued to shareholders. The DAX (the most widely 
followed German index, composed of 30 major German companies) is a 
performance-based index.

 Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market with Indexes
Checking Out the Indexes
Although most people consider the Dow, Nasdaq, and Standard & Poor’s 
500 to be the stars of the financial press, you may find other indexes equally 
important to follow because they cover other significant facets of the market, 
such as small-cap and mid-cap stocks, or specific sectors and industries.
	
For example, if you invest in an Internet stock, check the Internet Stock Index 
to compare how your stock is doing when measured against the index. You 
can find indexes that cover industries such as transportation, brokerage firms, 
retailers, computer companies, and real estate firms. For a comprehensive 
list of indexes, go to www.djindexes.com (a Dow Jones & Co. Web site). 
The most reliable and most widely respected indexes are produced not only 
by Dow Jones but also Standard & Poor’s and the major exchanges/markets 
themselves, such as the TSX, New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the American 
Stock Exchange (AMEX), and Nasdaq. Smaller exchanges also issue or provide 
indexes (such as the Philadelphia Exchange). You can find Web sites for differ­
ent exchanges in Appendix B.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average
The most famous stock market barometer is my first example in the previ­
ous section — the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). When someone asks 
how the market is doing, most investors quote “the Dow.” This index is price-
weighted and tracks a basket of 30 of the largest and most influential public 
companies in the stock market. We list the stocks tracked on the Dow and 
discuss the Dow’s drawbacks in the following sections.

Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
The drawbacks of the Dow
	
The Dow has survived as a popular gauge of stock market activity for over a 
century because it was the first such statistical snapshot of the stock market, 
which helped it become quickly entrenched as a widely followed and quoted 
barometer. Although it’s an important indicator of the market’s progress, the 
Dow does have one major drawback: it tracks only 30 companies. Regardless 
of their status in the market, the companies in the Dow represent a limited 
sampling, so they don’t communicate the true pulse of the market. For exam­
ple, when the Dow surpassed the record 10,000 and 11,000 milestones during 
1999 and 2000, the majority of (non-index) companies showed lacklustre or 
declining stock price movement. (See the “Dow Jones milestones” sidebar in 
this chapter for more information.)
	
The roster of the Dow has changed many times during the 100-plus years of its 
existence. The only original company from 1896 is General Electric. Dow Jones 
made most of the changes because of company mergers and bankruptcies. 
However, Dow Jones also made some changes simply to reflect the changing 
times. In September 2008, as AIG Corp.’s stock was plummeting because of the 
credit crisis on Wall Street, it was quickly removed from the Dow and replaced 
with Kraft Foods. At that time, AIG fell from $25 per share to $3 per share within 
days. Had AIG stayed in the Dow, the Dow would have shown a larger drop, 
but it maintained a higher level because of the quick replacement. Investors 
unaware of such moves can be fooled regarding the market’s health — another 
drawback of the Dow.

 Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market with Indexes
The Dow isn’t a pure gauge of industrial activity, because it also includes 
a hodgepodge of nonindustrial companies such as J.P. Morgan Chase and 
AMEX (banks), Home Depot (retailing), and Microsoft (software). During this 
decade, true industrial sectors like manufacturing had difficult times, yet the 
Dow rose to record levels.
Given the Dow’s shortcomings, serious investors also look at the following indexes:
	
✓	Broad-based indexes: The S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 are more real­
istic gauges of the stock market’s performance than the Dow. (We dis­
cuss these indexes later in this chapter.)
	
✓	Industry or sector indexes: These indexes are better gauges of the 
growth (or lack of growth) of specific industries and sectors. If you buy 
a gold stock, for example, you should track the index for the precious 
metals industry.
	
Dow Jones has several averages, including the Dow Jones Transportation 
Average (DJTA) and the Dow Jones Utilities Average (DJUA). Dow Jones man­
ages both of these indexes more strictly than the Dow, so they tend to be a 
more accurate barometer of the market they represent. Find out more about 
the Dow Jones indexes at www.djindexes.com.
The Toronto Stock Exchange/TMX
In 2000, the Toronto Stock Exchange became a for-profit company. Soon after, 
the Toronto Stock Exchange bought out the Canadian Venture Exchange, 
and the new group of exchanges was renamed the TSX. This transformation 
ended almost 125 years of using the term “TSE.” In mid-2008 the sharehold­
ers of TSX Group changed its name to the TMX Group. As of March 2009, the 
combined resources and entities of the predecessor exchange now some­
times use the name TMX.
	
The TMX Group’s business lines — in various Canadian cities — operate in 
the currency and derivatives markets as well as in equities, fixed income 
instruments, and energy:
	
✓	The Toronto Stock Exchange group offers stock issuers access to a 
public equity market that is world-class.
	
✓	The TSX Venture Exchange group serves the public-venture capital 
market, which provides access to growth capital for new companies.
	
✓	The Montreal Exchange component provides interest rate, index, and 
equity derivatives trading and owns a majority interest in the influential 
Boston Options Exchange (BOX).
	
✓	The Natural Gas Exchange (NGX) is a leading exchange for the trading of 
natural gas and electricity contracts.

trading system that also provides fixed income indexes in Canada.
In Canada, the S&P/TSX 60 Index includes 60 large-capitalization stocks (from 
the Toronto Stock Exchange) for Canadian equity markets. The index is mar­
ket-capitalization-weighted, weight-adjusted for things like share float (shares 
readily available to the public), and balanced across ten industry sectors. 
S&P/TSX 60 constituents are selected for inclusion using Standard & Poor’s 
guidelines concerning company capitalization, liquidity, and fundamentals.
	
The S&P/TSX 60 serves as the benchmark for related products such as 
exchange-traded funds and index options. Approximately $9 billion in index 
products are indexed to the S&P/TSX 60 index. The S&P/TSX 60 is part of the 
S&P Global 1200, a world equity index that covers more than 30 countries.

Standard & Poor’s 500
The Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) tracks 500 leading publicly traded com­
panies considered to be widely held. The publishing firm Standard & Poor’s 
created this index (we bet you could’ve guessed that). Because it contains 
500 companies, the S&P 500 more accurately represents overall market per­
formance than the DJIA, with its 30 companies. Money managers and finan­
cial advisers actually watch the S&P 500 stock index more closely than the 
Dow. Most mutual funds especially like to measure their performance against 
the S&P 500 rather than any other index, although mutual funds that con­
centrate on small-cap stocks usually prefer an index that has more small-cap 
stocks in it, such as the Russell 2000 (which we discuss later in this chapter).
The S&P 500 doesn’t attempt to cover the 500 biggest companies. Instead, it 
includes companies that are widely held and widely followed. The companies 
are also industry leaders in a variety of industries, including energy, technol­
ogy, healthcare, and finance.
	
Although it’s a reliable indicator of the market’s overall status, the S&P 500 also 
has some limitations. Despite the fact that it tracks 500 companies, the top 50 
companies make up 50 percent of the index’s market value. This situation can be 
a drawback, because those 50 companies have a greater influence on the index’s 
price movement than any other segment of companies. In other words, 10 percent 
of the companies have an equal impact to 90 percent of the companies on the 
same index. Therefore, although the index better represents the market than the 
DIJA, it doesn’t give a perfectly accurate representation of the general market.
Standard & Poor’s doesn’t set in stone the 500 companies it tracks — S&P can add 
or remove companies when market conditions change, removing a company if it 
isn’t doing well or goes bankrupt, for instance, and replacing it with a company 
that’s doing better. You can find out more at www.standardandpoors.com.

Wilshire Total Market Index
The Wilshire 5000 Equity Index, often referred to as the Wilshire Total Market 
Index, is probably the largest stock index in the world. Wilshire Associates 
started out in 1980 tracking 5,000 stocks. Since then, the Wilshire 5000 has 
ballooned to cover more than 7,500 stocks. The advantage of the Wilshire 
5000 is that it’s very comprehensive, covering nearly the entire market (at the 
very least, the Wilshire 5000 tracks the largest publicly traded stocks). It 
includes all the stocks on the major stock exchanges (NYSE, AMEX, and the 
largest issues on Nasdaq), which by default also includes all the stocks covered 
by the S&P 500. Investors and analysts who seek the greatest representation/
performance of the general market look to the Wilshire 5000.

As you can see, the Dow took 76 years to hit 
its first milestone. But it took less and less time 
to hit each succeeding milestone because the 
higher the Dow is in a relative sense, the easier 
it is to jump 1,000 points. For example, it went 
from 6,000 to 7,000 in only four months.
As the table indicates, most of the milestones 
happened during the 1982–99 bull market. But the 
Dow didn’t reach a new milestone from 2000–05. 
After the Dow hit a peak of 11,722 in January 
2000, it entered a bear market that lasted three 
years. A new bull market started in 2003, and the 
Dow regained its traction and started an ascent 
to new highs. It finally hit the 12,000 mark in late 
2006 (nearly 71⁄2 years after hitting the 11,000 
level). Despite hitting the 14,000 plateau in July 
2007, it spent the subsequent 12-month period 
trading sideways in the 11,000–13,000 range. The 
Dow hit an all-time closing high of 14,164.53 on 
October 9, 2007, although it is considerably lower 
today. Oh well . . .

Nasdaq indexes
Nasdaq became a formalized market in 1971. The name used to stand for 
“National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quote” system, but 
now it’s simply “Nasdaq” (as if it’s a name, like Ralph or Eddie). Nasdaq 
indexes are similar to other indexes in style and structure. The only dif­
ference is that, well, they cover companies traded on the Nasdaq (www.
nasdaq.com). The Nasdaq has two indexes, both of which are reported in 
the financial pages:
	
✓	Nasdaq Composite Index: Most frequently quoted on the news, the Nasdaq 
Composite Index covers about 3,000 companies that trade on Nasdaq. 
The companies encompass a variety of industries, but the index’s 
concentrationis primarily technology, biotech, alternative energy, and 
related sectors. The Nasdaq Composite Index hit an all-time high of 5,048 
in March 2000 before the worst bear market in its history occurred. The 
index dropped a whopping 77 percent by 2002 to bottom out at 1,114 in 
October 2002. As of late 2009, the Nasdaq was at approximately 2,000 (still 
way below its all-time high, but higher than its bottom six years earlier).
	
✓	Nasdaq 100 Index: The Nasdaq 100 tracks the 100 largest companies 
in Nasdaq based on size in terms of market capitalization. This index is 
for investors who want to concentrate on the largest companies, which 
tend to be especially weighted in technology. It provides extra represen­
tation of technology-related companies such as Microsoft, Adobe, and 
Symantec.
	
Although these indexes track growth-oriented companies, the stocks of these 
companies are also very volatile and carry commensurate risk. The indexes them­
selves bear out this risk; in the bear market of 2000 and 2001 (and even extending 
into 2002), they fell more than 60 percent. In March 2009, the index dropped 
below 1,300. You can find out more about Nasdaq’s indexes at www.nasdaq.com.
Russell 3000 Index
The Russell 3000 Index is a great example of an index that seeks more com­
prehensive inclusion of U.S. companies. It’s a performance-based index that 
includes the 3,000 largest publicly traded companies (nearly 98 percent of 
publicly traded stocks). The Russell 3000 is important because it includes 
many mid-cap and small-cap stocks. Most companies covered in the Russell 
3000 have an average market value of a billion dollars or less.

70
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
Russell Investments Group created and maintains the Russell 3000 Index, as 
well as the Russell 1000 and the Russell 2000. The Russell 2000 contains the 
smallest 2,000 companies from the Russell 3000, while the Russell 1000 con­
tains the largest 1,000 companies. The Russell indexes don’t cover micro-cap 
stocks (companies with a market capitalization under $250 million). You can 
find out more at www.russell.com.
International indexes
Investors need to remember that the whole world is a vast marketplace that 
interacts with and exerts tremendous influence on individual national econo­
mies and markets. Whether you have one stock or one mutual fund, keep 
tabs on how world markets affect your portfolio. The best way to get a snap­
shot of international markets is, of course, with indexes. Here are some of the 
more widely followed international indexes:
	
✓	BSE SENSEX (India): The most widely followed index of Indian stocks 
is also referred to as the “BSE 30 Index” and is a value-weighted index 
maintained by the Bombay Stock Exchange (www.bseindia.com).
	
✓	CAC-40 (France): This market-capitalization-weighted index tracks 40 
of the largest public stocks that trade on Paris’s stock exchange, the 
Euronext Paris.
	
✓	DAX (Germany): This index is similar to our DJIA in that it tracks 30 
blue-chip stocks (the largest and most active that trade on the Frankfurt 
Exchange).
	
✓	FTSE-100 (Great Britain): Usually referred to as the “footsie,” this mar­
ket-value-weighted index includes the top 100 public companies in the 
United Kingdom.
	
✓	Halter USX China Index (China): This index tracks a basket of 50 mar­
ket-value-weighted U.S. public companies that derive most of their rev­
enues from China.
	
✓	Hang Seng Index (Hong Kong): This market-value-weighted index tracks 
the top 45 companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
	
✓	Nikkei (Japan): This index is considered Japan’s version of the Dow. If 
you’re invested in Japanese stocks or in stocks that do business with 
Japan, you want to know what’s up with the Nikkei.
	
✓	SSE Composite Index (Shanghai): This is an index of all the stocks that 
trade on the Shanghai Stock Exchange.
	
You can track these international indexes (among others) at major financial 
Web sites such as www.bloomberg.com and www.marketwatch.com. You 
may find international indexes useful in your analysis as you watch your 
stocks’ progress. What if you have stock in a company that has most of its cus­
tomers in Japan? Then the Nikkei can help you get a general snapshot of how 

71
 Chapter 5: Say Cheese: Getting a Snapshot of the Market with Indexes
well the major companies are doing in Japan, which in turn can be a general 
barometer of Japan’s economic health. If your company’s business partners 
or customers are in the Nikkei and it’s plunging, you know it’s probably “sayo­
nara” for the company’s stock price.
As for us, we’re still waiting for the “Galaxy 1 Million Index” — no point in 
being overweight with Earth stocks, you know.
Using the Indexes Effectively
You may be wondering which indexes you should be checking out and 
exactly what you should do with them. The sections that follow give you 
some idea of how to put all the pieces together.
Tracking the indexes
	
The bottom line is that indexes give investors an instant snapshot of how well 
the market is doing. Indexes offer a quick way to compare the performance of 
one investor’s portfolio with the rest of the market. If the Dow goes up 10 per­
cent in a year and your portfolio shows a cumulative gain of 12 percent, then 
you know you’re doing well. Appendix B lists resources to help you keep up 
with various indexes.
	
The problem with indexes is that they can be misleading if you take them too 
literally as an accurate barometer of stock success. For example, the Dow has 
changed its roster of companies many times since 1896. Had it not, the Dow’s 
general upward trajectory in the past few decades would have been much dif­
ferent. Laggard stocks have been dropped and replaced with stocks that have 
shown more promise. Many of the original companies that were in the DJIA in 
1896 went out of business or were bought by other companies that aren’t 
reflected in the index.
Investing in indexes
If the market is doing well but your specific stock isn’t, can you find a way to 
invest in the index itself? Yes, and with investments based on indexes, you 
can invest in the general market or a particular industry.
	
Say you want to invest in the DJIA. After all, why try to beat the market if just 
matching it is sufficient to grow your wealth? Why not have a portfolio that 
directly mirrors the DJIA? Well, it’s too impractical and expensive to invest in 
all 30 stocks in the DJIA. Fortunately, alternatives can accomplish the act of 
investing in indexes. Here are the best ways:

72
Part I: The Essentials of Stock Investing 
	
✓	Index mutual funds: An index mutual fund is much like a regular mutual 
fund except that it invests only in securities (in this case, stocks) that 
match as closely as possible the basket of stocks in that particular 
index. For example, you can find index mutual funds that track the DJIA 
and the S&P 500. Find out more about index mutual funds at places such 
as Morningstar (www.morningstar.com) and Globe Investor (www.
globeinvestor.com).
	
✓	Exchange-traded funds (ETFs): This is a particular favourite of ours. 
ETFs have similar characteristics to mutual funds except for a few key 
differences. An ETF can reflect a basket of stocks that mirror a particu­
lar index, but you can trade the ETF like a stock itself. You can trans­
act ETFs like stocks in that you can buy, sell, or go short. You can put 
stop losses on them, and you can even purchase them on margin (see 
Chapter 21 for more on stop losses and buying on margin). ETFs can 
give you the diversification of mutual funds coupled with the versatility 
of stocks. Examples of ETFs that track indexes are the DJIA ETF (symbol 
DIA) and the ETF for Nasdaq (QQQ). You can find out more about ETFs 
at the American Stock Exchange (www.amex.com) and at Globe Investor 
(www.globeinvestor.com).

mation and discover what stockbrokers can do for you. In 
addition, you’ll find fun chapters on the basics of econom­
ics (really!) and the influence of politics that will keep you

nowledge and information are two critical success factors in stock 
investing. (Isn’t that true about most things in life?) People who plunge 
headlong into stocks without sufficient knowledge of the stock market in 
general, and current information in particular, quickly learn the lesson of the 
eager diver who didn’t find out ahead of time that the pool was only an inch 
deep (ouch!). In their haste to avoid missing so-called golden investment 
opportunities, investors too often end up losing money.
	
Opportunities to make money in the stock market will always be there, no 
matter how well or how poorly the economy and the market are performing 
in general. There’s no such thing as a single (and fleeting) magical moment, so 
don’t feel that if you let an opportunity pass you by, you’ll always regret that 
you missed your one big chance.
For the best approach to stock investing, you want to build your knowledge 
and find quality information first. Then buy stocks and make your fortunes 
more assuredly. Basically, before you buy stock, you need to know that the 
company you’re investing in is
	
✓	Financially sound and growing
	
✓	Offering products and services that are in demand by consumers
	
✓	In a strong and growing industry (and general economy)

Looking to Stock Exchanges 
for Answers
Before you invest in stocks, you need to be completely familiar with the 
basics of stock investing. At its most fundamental, stock investing is about 
using your money to buy a piece of a company that will give you value in the 
form of appreciation or income. Fortunately, many resources are available to 
help you find out about stock investing. Some of our favourite places are the 
stock exchanges themselves.
Stock exchanges are organized marketplaces for the buying and selling of 
stocks (and other securities). The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and the 
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are the premier North American stock 
exchanges (refer to Chapter 5). They provide a framework for stock buyers 
and sellers to make their transactions. The TSX and NYSE make money not 
only from a piece of every transaction but also from fees (such as listing fees) 
charged to companies and brokers that are members of its exchanges.
The main exchanges for most North American stock investors are the NYSE, 
TSX, Nasdaq, and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). Nasdaq techni­
cally is not an exchange, but it is a formal market that effectively acts as 
an exchange. These four exchanges/markets encourage and inform people 
about stock investing. Because they benefit from increased popularity of 
stock investing and continued demand for stocks, they offer a wealth of free 
(or low-cost) resources and information for stock investors. Go to their Web 
sites to find useful resources such as:
	
✓	Tutorials on how to invest in stocks, common investment strategies, and 
so on
	
✓	Glossaries and free information to help you understand the language, 
practice, and purpose of stock investing
	
✓	A wealth of news, press releases, financial data, and other information 
about companies listed on the exchange or market, usually accessed 
through an on-site search engine
	
✓	Industry analysis and news
	
✓	Stock quotes and other market information related to the daily market 
movements of stocks, including data such as volume, new highs, new 
lows, and so on
	
✓	Free tracking of your stock selections (you can input a sample portfolio, 
or the stocks you’re following, to see how well you’re doing)

Understanding Stocks and the 
Companies They Represent
Stocks represent ownership in companies. Before you buy individual stocks, 
you want to understand the companies whose stock you’re considering and 
find out about their operations. It may sound like a daunting task, but you’ll 
digest the point more easily when you realize that companies work very 
similarly to how you work. They make decisions on a day-to-day basis just 
as you do.
Think about how you grow and prosper as an individual or as a family, and 
you see the same issues with businesses and how they grow and prosper. 
Low earnings and high debt are examples of financial difficulties that can 
affect both Canadians and companies. You’ll understand companies’ finances 
when you take the time to pick up some information in two basic disciplines: 
accounting and economics. These two disciplines play a significant role in 
understanding the performance of a firm’s stock.
Accounting for taste and a whole lot more
	
Accounting. Ugh! But face it: Accounting is the language of business, and 
believe it or not, you’re already familiar with the most important accounting 
concepts. Just look at the following three essential principles:
	
✓	Assets minus liabilities equals net worth. In other words, take what you 
own (your assets), subtract what you owe (your liabilities), and the rest 
is yours (net worth)! Your own personal finances work the same way as 
Microsoft’s (except yours have fewer zeros at the end). See Chapter 2 to 
figure out how to calculate your own net worth.

78
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
	A company’s balance sheet shows you its net worth at a specific point 
in time (such as December 31). The net worth of a company is the 
bottom line of its asset and liability picture, and it tells you whether the 
company is solvent (has the ability to pay its debts without going out of 
business). The net worth of a successful company is regularly growing. 
To see whether your company is successful, compare its net worth with 
the net worth from the same point a year earlier. A firm that has a $4 
million net worth on December 31, 2008, and a $5 million net worth on 
December 31, 2009, is doing well; its net worth has gone up 25 percent 
($1 million) in one year.
	
✓	Income less expenses equals net income. In other words, take what you 
make (your income), subtract what you spend (your expenses), and the 
remainder is your net income (or net profit or net earnings — your gain).
	
	A company’s profitability is the whole point of investing in its stock. 
As it profits, the business becomes more valuable, and in turn its stock 
price becomes more valuable. To discover a firm’s net income, look at 
its income statement. Try to determine whether the company uses its 
gains wisely, either reinvesting them for continued growth or paying 
down debt.
	
✓	Do a comparative financial analysis. That’s a mouthful, but it’s just a 
fancy way of saying how a company is doing now compared with some­
thing else (like a prior period or a similar company).
	
	If you know that the company you’re looking at had a net income of 
$50,000 for the year, you may ask, “Is that good or bad?” Obviously, 
making a net profit is good, but you also need to know whether it’s good 
compared to something else. If the company had a net profit of $40,000 
the year before, you know that the company’s profitability is improving. 
But if a similar company had a net profit of $100,000 the year before and 
in the current year is making $50,000, then you may want to either avoid 
that company or see what (if anything) went wrong with it.
Accounting can be this simple. If you understand these three basic points, 
you’re ahead of the curve (in stock investing as well as in your personal 
finances). For more information on how to use a company’s financial state­
ments to pick good stocks, see Chapters 12, 13, and 14.
Understanding how economics 
affects stocks
Economics. Double ugh! No, you aren’t required to understand “the inelastic­
ity of demand aggregates” (thank heavens!) or “marginal utility” (say what?). 
But a working knowledge of basic economics is crucial (and we mean crucial) 
to your success and proficiency as a stock investor. The stock market and 
the economy are joined at the hip. The good (or bad) things that happen to 
one have a direct effect on the other.

79
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Getting the hang of the basic concepts
	
Alas, many investors get lost on basic economic concepts (as do some so-
called experts that you see on TV). We owe our personal investing success to 
our status as students of economics. Understanding basic economics helps us 
(and will help you) filter the financial news to separate relevant information 
from the irrelevant in order to make better investment decisions. Be aware of 
these important economic concepts:
	
✓	Supply and demand: How can anyone possibly think about economics 
without thinking of the ageless concept of supply and demand? Supply 
and demand can be simply stated as the relationship between what’s 
available (the supply) and what people want and are willing to pay for 
(the demand). This equation is the main engine of economic activity and 
is extremely important for your stock investing analysis and decision-
making process. We mean, do you really want to buy stock in a company 
that makes porcelain busts of John Diefenbaker if you find out that the 
company has an oversupply and nobody wants to buy them anyway? 
(We discuss supply and demand in more detail in Chapter 10.)
	
✓	Cause and effect: If you pick up a prominent news report and read, 
“Companies in the table industry are expecting plummeting sales,” do 
you rush out and invest in companies that sell chairs or manufacture 
tablecloths? Considering cause and effect is an exercise in logical think­
ing, and believe us, logic is a major component of sound economic 
thought.
	
	When you read business news, play it out in your mind. What good 
(or bad) can logically be expected given a certain event or situation? If 
you’re looking for an effect (“I want a stock price that keeps increasing”), 
you also want to understand the cause. Here are some typical events 
that can cause a stock’s price to rise (see Chapter 10 for additional info 
on cause and effect):
 
• Positive news reports about a company: The news may report 
that the company is enjoying success with increased sales or a 
new product.
 
• Positive news reports about a company’s industry: The media 
may be highlighting that the industry is poised to do well.
 
• Positive news reports about a company’s customers: Maybe your 
company is in industry A, but its customers are in industry B. If 
you see good news about industry B, that may be good news for 
your stock.
 
• Negative news reports about a company’s competitors: If the 
competitors are in trouble, their customers may seek alternatives 
to buy from, including your company.

✓	Economic effects from government actions: Political and governmental 
actions have economic consequences. As a matter of fact, nothing (and 
we mean nothing!) has a greater effect on investing and economics than 
government. Government actions usually manifest themselves as taxes, 
laws, or regulations. They also can take on a more ominous appearance, 
such as war or the threat of war. Government can willfully (or even acci­
dentally) cause a company to go bankrupt, disrupt an entire industry, 
or even cause a depression. It controls the money supply, credit, and all 
public securities markets. For more information on political effects, see 
Chapter 11.
Gaining insight from past mistakes
Because most investors ignored some basic observations about economics 
in the late 1990s, they subsequently lost trillions in their stock portfolios. 
During 2000–09, the U.S. experienced the greatest expansion of total debt in 
history, coupled with a record expansion of the money supply. The Federal 
Reserve (or “the Fed”), the U.S. government’s central bank, controls both. In 
Canada, government debt also increased in recent years, albeit less signifi­
cantly. (In mid-2009 the Bank of Canada increased the money supply as well.) 
This growth of North American debt and U.S. money supply resulted in more 
consumer (and corporate) borrowing, spending, and investing. This activ­
ity hyperstimulated the stock market for over a decade, and caused stocks 
to rise until the stock market bubble popped during 2000–02. It was soon 
replaced with the housing bubble, which popped during 2005–06 and is still 
hurting the economy in 2010.
Of course, you should always be happy to earn double-digit annual returns 
with your investments, but such a return can’t be sustained and encourages 
speculation. This artificial stimulation by the Fed and the Bank of Canada 
resulted in the following:
	
✓	More and more people depleted their savings. After all, why settle for 
3 percent in the Royal Bank when you can get 25 percent in the stock 
market?
	
✓	More and more people bought on credit. If the economy is booming, 
why not buy now and pay later? Consumer credit hit record highs in 
both Canada and the U.S.
	
✓	More and more people borrowed against their homes. Why not borrow 
and get rich now? I can pay off my debt later.
	
✓	More and more companies sold more goods as consumers took more 
vacations and bought SUVs, electronics, and so on. Companies then bor­
rowed to finance expansion, open new stores, and so on.

81
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
	
✓	More and more North American companies went public and offered 
stock to take advantage of more money that was flowing to the markets 
from banks and other financial institutions.
Beginning in late 2007, spending started to slow down in Canada and the U.S. 
because consumers and businesses became too indebted. This slowdown 
in turn caused the sales of goods and services to taper off. However, com­
panies had too much overhead, capacity, and debt because they expanded 
too eagerly. At this point, businesses were caught in a financial bind. Too 
much debt and too many expenses in a slowing economy mean one thing: 
profits shrink or disappear. To stay in business, companies had to do the 
logical thing — cut expenses. What’s usually the biggest expense for compa­
nies? People! To stay in business, many companies in Canada and the U.S. 
started laying off employees. As a result, consumer spending dropped further 
because more people were either laid off or had second thoughts about their 
own job security.
As people had little in the way of savings and too much in the way of debt, 
they had to sell their stock to pay their bills. This trend was one major 
reason why stocks started to fall in recent years. Earnings started to drop 
because of shrinking sales from a sputtering economy. As earnings fell, stock 
prices also fell.
	
The lessons from the 1990s and from the housing bubble years are important 
ones for investors today:
	
✓	Stocks are not a replacement for savings accounts. Always have some 
money in the bank.
	
✓	Stocks should never occupy 100 percent of your investment funds.
	
✓	When anyone (including an expert) tells you that the economy will keep 
growing indefinitely, be skeptical and read diverse sources of information.
	
✓	If stocks do well in your portfolio, consider protecting your stocks (both 
your original investment and any gains) with stop-loss orders. (See 
Chapter 21 for more on these strategies.)
	
✓	Keep debt and expenses to a minimum.
	
✓	If the Canadian economy is booming, a decline is sure to follow as the 
ebb and flow of the economy’s business cycle continues.

Staying on Top of Financial News
Reading the financial news can help you decide where or where not to invest. 
Many newspapers, magazines, and Web sites offer great coverage of the 
financial world. Obviously, the more informed you are, the better, but you 
don’t have to read everything that’s written. The information explosion in 
recent years has gone beyond overload, and you can easily spend so much 
time reading that you have little time left for investing. In the following sec­
tions, we describe the types of information you need to get from the financial 
news.
	
Appendix B of this book provides more information on the following resources, 
along with a treasure trove of some of the best publications, resources, and 
Web sites to assist you:
	
✓	The most obvious publications of interest to stock investors are the two 
Canadian national dailies — the National Post (www.nationalpost.
com) and The Globe and Mail (www.theglobeandmail.com). Other 
useful publications include The Wall Street Journal and Investor’s 
Business Daily, U.S. newspapers that also cover world financial news. 
These leading publications report the news and stock data as of the day 
before.
	
✓	Some other leading Web sites are CBS’s MarketWatch (www.market
watch.com) and Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com), which include 
Canadian company news and information. These Web sites can also give 
you news and stock data within minutes of a transaction.
Know thyself before you invest in stocks
If you’re reading this book, you’re probably 
doing so because you want to become a suc­
cessful investor. Granted, to be a successful 
investor you have to select great stocks, but 
having a realistic understanding of your own 
financial situation and goals is equally impor­
tant. We recall one investor who lost $10,000 
in a speculative stock. The loss wasn’t that 
bad because he had most of his money safely 
tucked away elsewhere. He also understood 
that his overall financial situation was secure 
and that the money he lost was “play” money — 
the loss wouldn’t have a drastic effect on his 
life. But many investors often lose even more 
money, and the loss does have a major, nega­
tive effect on their lives. You may not be like the 
investor who can afford to lose $10,000. Take 
time to understand yourself, your own financial 
picture, and your personal investment goals 
before you decide to buy stocks.

83
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Figuring out what a company’s up to
	
Before you invest, you need to know what’s going on with the company. When 
you read about the company, either from the firm’s literature (its annual 
report, for example) or from media sources, be sure to get answers to some 
pertinent questions:
	
✓	Is the company making more net income than it did last year? You 
want to invest in a company that’s growing.
	
✓	Are the company’s sales greater than they were the year before? 
Remember, you won’t make money if the company isn’t making money.
	
✓	Is the company issuing press releases on new products, services, 
inventions, or business deals? All these achievements indicate a strong, 
vital company.
Knowing how the company is doing, no matter what’s happening with the 
general economy, is obviously important. To better understand how compa­
nies tick, see Chapter 12.
Discovering what’s new with an industry
As you consider investing in a stock, make it a point to know what’s going on 
in that company’s industry. If the industry is doing well, your stock is likely 
to do well, too. But then again, the reverse is also true.
Yes, we’ve seen investors pick successful stocks in a failing industry, but 
those cases are exceptional. By and large, it’s easier to succeed with a stock 
when the entire industry is doing well. As you’re watching the news, reading 
the financial pages, or viewing financial Web sites, check out the industry to 
see that it’s strong and dynamic. See Chapter 17 for information on analyzing 
industries.
Knowing what’s happening 
with the economy
No matter how well or how poorly the overall economy is performing, you 
want to stay informed about its general progress. It’s easier for the value of 
stock to keep going up when the economy is stable or growing. The reverse is 
also true; if the economy is contracting or declining, the stock has a tougher 
time keeping its value. Some basic items to keep tabs on include the following:

84
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
✓	Gross domestic product (GDP): This is roughly the total value of output 
for a particular nation, measured in the dollar amount of goods and 
services. The GDP is reported quarterly, and a rising GDP bodes well 
for your stock. When the GDP is rising 3 percent or more on an annual 
basis, that’s solid growth. If it rises at more than zero but less than 3 
percent, that’s generally considered less than stellar (or mediocre). 
A GDP under zero (or negative) means that the economy is shrinking 
(heading into recession).
	
✓	The index of leading economic indicators (LEI): The LEI is a snapshot 
of a set of economic statistics covering activity that precedes what’s 
happening in the economy. Each statistic helps you understand the 
economy in much the same way that barometers (and windows!) help 
you understand what’s happening with the weather. Economists don’t 
just look at an individual statistic; they look at a set of statistics to get a 
more complete picture of what’s happening with the economy.
Chapter 10 goes into greater detail on economics and its effect on stock prices.
Seeing what politicians and government 
bureaucrats are doing
Being informed about what public officials are doing is vital to your success 
as a stock investor. Because federal, provincial, and local governments pass 
literally thousands of laws every year, monitoring the political landscape is 
critical to your success. The Canadian news media report what the govern­
ment is doing, so always ask yourself, “How does a new law, tax, or regulation 
affect my stock investment?”
	
Because government actions have a significant effect on your investments, it’s 
a good idea to see what’s going on. The Canadian Taxpayers Federation (www.
taxpayer.com) informs the Canadian public about tax laws and their impact. 
Chapter 11 gives you more insights into politics and its effect on the stock 
market. Laws being proposed or enacted by the U.S. government can be found 
through the Thomas legislative search engine, which is run by the Library of 
Congress (www.loc.gov).
Checking for trends in society, culture, 
and entertainment
As odd as it sounds, trends in society, popular culture, and entertainment 
affect your investments, directly or indirectly. For example, a headline such 
as, “The greying of Canada: More people than ever before will be senior citi­
zens” gives you some important information that can make or break your 

85
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
stock portfolio. With that particular headline, you know that as more and 
more people age, companies that are well positioned to cater to that growing 
market’s wants and needs will do well — meaning a successful stock for you.
Keep your eyes open to emerging trends in society at large. What trends are 
evident now? Can you anticipate the wants and needs of tomorrow’s society? 
Being alert, staying a step ahead of the public, and choosing stocks appro­
priately gives you a profitable edge over other investors. If you own stock in 
a solid company with growing sales and earnings, other investors eventually 
notice. As more investors buy up your company’s stocks, you’re rewarded as 
the stock price increases.
Reading (and Understanding) 
Stock Tables
The stock tables in major business publications such as The Wall Street 
Journal and Investor’s Business Daily are loaded with information that can 
help you become a savvy investor — if you know how to interpret them. 
You need the information in the stock tables for more than selecting prom­
ising investment opportunities. You also need to consult the tables after 
you invest to monitor how your stocks are doing. The National Post (www.
nationalpost.com) and The Globe and Mail (www.theglobeandmail.
com) also produce stock tables for a selection of mostly Canadian equities in 
their print editions. As well, they let you check just about any stock (U.S. or 
Canadian) in their online editions.
Looking at the stock tables without knowing what you’re looking for or why 
you’re looking is the equivalent of reading War and Peace backwards through 
a kaleidoscope — nothing makes sense. But we can help you make sense of 
it all (well, at least the stock tables!). Table 6-1 shows a sample stock table to 
refer to as you read the sections that follow.
	
Every newspaper’s financial tables are a little different, but they give you basi­
cally the same information. This section, updated daily, is not the place to 
start your search for a good stock; it’s usually where your search ends. The 
stock tables are the place to look when you own a stock or know what you 
want to buy and you’re just checking to see the most recent price.
Each item gives you some clues about the current state of affairs for that par­
ticular company. The sections that follow describe each column to help you 
understand what you’re looking at.

52-week high
The column in Table 6-1 labelled “52-Wk High” gives you the highest price 
that particular stock has reached in the most recent 52-week period. Knowing 
this price lets you gauge where the stock is now versus where it has been 
recently. SkyHighCorp’s (SHC) stock has been as high as $21.50, while its last 
(most recent) price is $21.25, the number listed in the “Day Last” column. 
(Flip to the “Day last” section for more on understanding this information.) 
SkyHighCorp’s stock is trading very high right now because it’s hovering 
right near its overall 52-week-high figure.
Now, take a look at DoinBadlyCorp’s (DBC) stock price. It seems to have 
tumbled big time. Its stock price has had a high in the past 52 weeks of $83, 
but it’s currently trading at $33.50. Something just doesn’t seem right here. 
During the past 52 weeks, DBC’s stock price fell dramatically. If you’re think­
ing about investing in DBC, find out why the stock price fell. If the company 
is strong, it may be a good opportunity to buy stock at a lower price. If the 
company is having tough times, avoid it. In any case, research the firm and 
find out why its stock has declined.
52-week low
The column labelled “52-Wk Low” gives you the lowest price that particular 
stock reached in the most recent 52-week period. Again, this information is 
crucial to your ability to analyze stock over a period of time. Look at DBC in 
Table 6-1, and you can see that its current trading price of $33.50 is close to 
its 52-week low of $33.

87
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
	
Keep in mind that the high and low prices just give you a range of how far that 
particular stock’s price has moved within the past 52 weeks. They could alert 
you that a stock has problems, or they could tell you that a stock’s price has 
fallen enough to make it a bargain. Simply reading the 52-Wk High and 52-Wk 
Low columns isn’t enough to determine which of those two scenarios is hap­
pening. They basically tell you to get more information before you commit 
your money.
Name and symbol
The “Name (Symbol)” column is the simplest in Table 6-1. It tells you the 
company name (usually abbreviated) and the stock symbol assigned to the 
company.
	
When you have your eye on a stock for potential purchase, get familiar with 
its symbol. Knowing the symbol makes it easier for you to find your stock in 
the financial tables, which list stocks in alphabetical order by the company’s 
name. Stock symbols are the language of stock investing, and you need to use 
them in all stock communications, from getting a stock quote at your broker’s 
office to buying stock over the Internet.
Dividend
Dividends (shown under the “Div” column in Table 6-1) are basically pay­
ments to owners (shareholders). If a company pays a dividend, it’s shown in 
the dividend column. The amount you see is the annual dividend quoted for 
one share of that stock. If you look at LowDownInc (LDI) in Table 6-1, you can 
see that you get $2.35 as an annual dividend for each share of stock that you 
own. Companies usually pay the dividend in quarterly amounts. If I own 100 
shares of LDI, the company pays me a quarterly dividend of $58.75 ($235 total 
per year). A healthy company strives to maintain or upgrade the dividend for 
shareholders from year to year. (We discuss additional dividend details later 
in this chapter.)
The dividend is very important to investors seeking income from their stock 
investment. For more about investing for income, see Chapter 9. Investors 
buy stock in companies that don’t pay dividends primarily for growth. For 
more information on growth stocks, see Chapter 8.

88
Part II: Before You Invest 
Volume
Normally, when you hear the word “volume” on the news, it refers to how 
much stock is bought and sold for the entire market: “Well, stocks were very 
active today. Trading volume at the Toronto Stock Exchange hit 350 million 
shares.” Volume is certainly important to watch because the stocks that 
you’re investing in are somewhere in that activity. For the “Vol” column in 
Table 6-1, though, the volume refers to the individual stock.
Volume tells you how many shares of that particular stock were traded that 
day. If only 100 shares are traded in a day, then the trading volume is 100. 
SHC had 3,143 shares change hands on the trading day represented in Table 
6-1. Is that good or bad? Neither, really. The business news media generally 
mention volume for a particular stock only when it’s unusually large. If a 
stock normally has a trading volume in the 5,000 to 10,000 range and all of a 
sudden it’s at 87,000, then it’s time to sit up and take notice.
	
Keep in mind that a low trading volume for one stock may be a high trading 
volume for another stock. You can’t necessarily compare one stock’s volume 
against that of any other company. The large-cap stocks like IBM or Microsoft 
typically have trading volumes in the millions of shares almost every day, 
while less active, smaller stocks may have average trading volumes in far, far 
smaller numbers.
The main point to remember is that trading volume far in excess of that stock’s 
normal range is a sign that something is going on with the stock. It may be neg­
ative or positive, but something newsworthy is happening with that company. 
If the news is positive, the increased volume is a result of more people buying 
the stock. If the news is negative, the increased volume is probably a result of 
more people selling the stock. What are typical events that cause increased 
trading volume? Some positive reasons include the following:
	
✓	Good earnings reports: The company announces good (or better-than-
expected) earnings.
	
✓	A new business deal: The firm announces a favourable business deal, 
such as a joint venture, or lands a big client.
	
✓	A new product or service: The company’s research and development 
department creates a potentially profitable new product.
	
✓	Indirect benefits: The business may benefit from a new development in 
the economy or from a new law passed by Parliament.
Some negative reasons for an unusually large fluctuation in trading volume 
for a particular stock include the following:
	
✓	Bad earnings reports: Profit is the lifeblood of a company. When its 
profits fall or disappear, you see more volume.

89
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
	
✓	Governmental problems: The stock is being targeted by federal or pro­
vincial government action, such as a lawsuit or a securities commission 
(Ontario Securities Commission, for example) probe.
	
✓	Liability issues: The media report that the company has a defective 
product or similar problem.
	
✓	Financial problems: Independent analysts report that the company’s 
financial health is deteriorating.
	
Check out what’s happening when you hear about heavier than usual volume 
(especially if you already own the stock).
Yield
In general, yield is a return on the money you invest. However, in the stock 
tables, yield (“Yld” in Table 6-1) is a reference to what percentage that par­
ticular dividend is to the stock price. Yield is most important to income 
investors. It’s calculated by dividing the annual dividend by the current stock 
price. In Table 6-1, you can see that the yield du jour of ValueNowInc (VNI) is 
4.5 percent (a dividend of $1 divided by the company’s stock price of $22). 
Notice that many companies report no yield; because they have no divi­
dends, their yield is zero.
	
Keep in mind that the yield reported in the financial pages changes daily as 
the stock price changes. Yield is always reported as if you’re buying the stock 
that day. If you buy VNI on the day represented in Table 6-1, your yield is 4.5 
percent. But what if VNI’s stock price rises to $30 the following day? Investors 
who buy stock at $30 per share obtain a yield of just 3.3 percent (the dividend 
of $1 divided by the new stock price, $30). Of course, because you bought the 
stock at $22, you essentially locked in the prior yield of 4.5 percent. Lucky you. 
Pat yourself on the back.
P/E
The P/E ratio is the ratio between the price of the stock and the company’s 
earnings. P/E ratios are widely followed and are important barometers of 
value in the world of stock investing. The P/E ratio (also called the “earnings 
multiple” or just “multiple”) is frequently used to determine whether a stock 
is expensive. Value investors (such as your authors) find P/E ratios to be 
essential to analyzing a stock as a potential investment. As a general rule, the 
P/E should be 10 to 20 for large-cap or income stocks. For growth stocks, a 
P/E no greater than 30 to 40 is preferable. (See Chapter 12 for details on P/E 
ratios.)

90
Part II: Before You Invest 
In the P/E ratios reported in stock tables, price refers to the cost of a single 
share of stock. Earnings refers to the company’s reported earnings per share 
as of the most recent four quarters. The P/E ratio is the price divided by the 
earnings. In Table 6-1, VNI has a reported P/E of 12, which is considered a low 
P/E. Notice how SHC has a relatively high P/E (76). This stock is considered 
too pricey because you’re paying a price equivalent to 76 times earnings. 
Also notice that DBC has no available P/E ratio. Usually this lack of a P/E ratio 
indicates that the company reported a loss in the most recent four quarters.
Day last
The “Day Last” column tells you how trading ended for a particular stock on 
the day represented by the table. In Table 6-1, LDI ended the most recent day 
of trading at $41. Some newspapers report the high and low for that day in 
addition to the stock’s ending price for the day.
Net change
The information in the “Net Chg” column answers the question, “How did the 
stock price end today compared with its price at the end of the prior trad­
ing day?” Table 6-1 shows that SHC stock ended the trading day up 25 cents 
(at $21.25). This column tells you that SHC ended the prior day at $21. VNI 
ended the day at $22 (up 10 cents), so you can tell that the prior trading day 
it ended at $21.90.
Using News about Dividends
Reading and understanding the news about dividends is essential if you’re an 
income investor (someone who invests in stocks as a means of generating reg­
ular income; see Chapter 9 for details). The following sections explain some 
basics about dividends you should know.
	
You can find news and information on dividends in newspapers such as The 
Globe and Mail, National Post, The Wall Street Journal, Investor’s Business Daily, 
and Barron’s (you can find their Web sites online using your favourite search 
engine, or just check out Appendix B).

91
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
Looking at important dates
	
To understand how buying stocks that pay dividends can benefit you as an 
investor, you need to know how companies report and pay dividends. Some 
important dates in the life of a dividend are as follows:
	
✓	Date of declaration: This is the date when a company reports a quar­
terly dividend and the subsequent payment dates. On January 15, for 
example, a company may report that it is “pleased to announce a quar­
terly dividend of 50 cents per share to shareholders of record as of 
February 10.” That was easy. The date of declaration is really just the 
announcement date. If you buy the stock before, on, or after the date of 
declaration, it won’t matter in regard to receiving the stock’s quarterly 
dividend. The date that matters is the date of record (see that bullet 
later in this list).
	
✓	Date of execution: This is the day you actually initiate the stock transac­
tion (buying or selling). If you call up a broker (or contact her online) 
today to buy a particular stock, then today is the date of execution, or 
the date on which you execute the trade. You don’t own the stock on the 
date of execution; it’s just the day you put in the order. For an example, 
skip to the following section.
	
✓	Closing date (settlement date): This is the date on which the trade is 
finalized, which usually happens three business days after the date 
of execution. The closing date for stock is similar in concept to a real 
estate closing. On the closing date, you’re officially the proud new owner 
(or happy seller) of the stock.
	
✓	Date of record: This is used to identify which shareholders qualify to 
receive the declared dividend. Because stock is bought and sold every 
day, how does the company know which investors to pay? The company 
establishes a cut-off date by declaring a date of record. All investors 
who are official shareholders as of the declared date of record receive 
the dividend on the payment date, even if they plan to sell the stock any 
time between the date of declaration and the date of record.
	
✓	Ex-dividend date: Ex-dividend means without dividend. Because it takes 
three days to process a stock purchase before you become an official 
owner of the stock, you have to qualify (that is, you have to own or buy 
the stock) before the three-day period. That three-day period is referred 
to as the “ex-dividend period.” When you buy stock during this short 
time frame you aren’t on the books of record, because the closing (or 
settlement) date falls after the date of record. Read the next section to 
see the effect that the ex-dividend date can have on an investor.
	
✓	Payment date: The date on which a company issues and mails its divi­
dend cheques to shareholders. (Finally!)
For typical dividends, the events in Table 6-2 happen four times per year.

Starts the three-day period 
during which, if you buy the 
stock, you don’t qualify for the 
dividend
Record date

for the dividend
Payment date
February 27
The date that payment is made 
(a dividend cheque is issued 
and mailed to shareholders who 
were on the books of record as 
of February 10)
Understanding why these dates matter
Three business days pass between the date of execution and the closing 
date. Three business days also pass between the ex-dividend date and the 
date of record. This information is important to know if you want to qualify 
to receive an upcoming dividend. Timing is important, and if you understand 
these dates, you know when to purchase stock and whether you qualify for a 
dividend.
As an example, say that you want to buy ValueNowInc (VNI) in time to qualify for 
the quarterly dividend of 25 cents per share. Assume that the date of record (the 
date by which you have to be an official owner of the stock) is February 10. You 
have to execute the trade (buy the stock) no later than February 7 to be assured 
of the dividend. If you execute the trade right on February 7, the closing date 
occurs three days later, on February 10 — just in time for the date of record.
But what if you execute the trade on February 8, a day later? Well, the trade’s 
closing date is February 11, which occurs after the date of record. Because 
you aren’t on the books as an official shareholder on the date of record, 
you aren’t getting that quarterly dividend. In this example, the February 7–9 
period is called the ex-dividend period.

 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
	
Fortunately, for those people who buy the stock during this brief ex-dividend 
period, the stock actually trades at a slightly lower price to reflect the amount 
of the dividend. If you can’t get the dividend, you may as well save on the 
stock purchase. How’s that for a silver lining?
Evaluating (Avoiding?) Investment Tips
Psst. Have I got a stock tip for you! Come closer. You know what it is? 
Research! What we’re trying to tell you is that you should never automatically 
invest just because you get a hot tip from someone. Good investment selec­
tion means looking at several sources before you decide on a stock. There’s 
no shortcut. That said, getting opinions from others never hurts — just be 
sure to carefully analyze the information you get. The following sections pres­
ent some important points to bear in mind as you evaluate tips and advice 
from others.
Consider the source
Frequently, people buy stock based on the views of some market strategist or 
market analyst. People may see an analyst being interviewed on a television 
financial show and take that person’s opinions and advice as valid and good. 
The danger here is that the analyst could easily be biased because of some 
relationship that isn’t disclosed on the show.
	
It happens on TV all too often. The show’s host interviews analyst U.R. 
Kiddingme from the investment firm Foolum & Sellum. The analyst says, 
“Implosion Corp. is a good buy with solid, long-term, upside potential.” You 
later find out that Implosion Corp. is paying investment banking fees to the 
analyst’s employer. Do you really think that analyst would ever issue a nega­
tive report on a company that’s helping to pay the bills? It’s not likely. Being 
suspicious can keep you from being a sucker.
Get multiple views
One source isn’t enough to base your investment decisions on. Well, not 
unless you have the best reasons in the world for thinking that one particular 
single source is outstanding and extremely accurate and prescient. A better 
approach is to scour current issues of independent financial publications, 
such as Barron’s, Canadian Business, SmartMoney, and other publications 
listed in Appendix B. Search the Internet for information, too. Appendix B 
lists lots of informative Web sites for you to check out.

Gathering Data from SEDAR 
and EDGAROnline
In Canada, publicly traded companies are required to file business and 
financial information with provincial securities regulators. These reports are 
entered into a government-sponsored database called SEDAR — the System 
for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval (www.sedar.com).
Electronic filing with SEDAR is now a mandatory requirement for most public 
companies. The rules of who files what were established at the federal level 
by the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) regulatory body and are 
overseen by each provincial securities regulatory body. SEDAR is a link that 
enables enterprises to file securities documents and remit filing fees electron­
ically. It saves them time and gives you, the Canadian investor, fast, easy, and 
free access to important information about companies (and mutual funds, 
as well).
In the U.S., the peer site is called EDGAROnline (www.freeedgar.com). The 
EDGAROnline service is even more advanced than SEDAR. In addition to let­
ting you access statutory filings, it also provides registered users with an 
e-mail alert every time a certain reporting firm files a document and links you 
to that document.
Individual investors can access downloadable data from both Web sites 
(EDGAROnline charges a fee but SEDAR is free). This means that you can 
download SEDAR and EDGAROnline reports to read later. The content avail­
able at these Web sites is critical to investors because it contains all signifi­
cant financial, legal, and other types of statutory (mandatory) declarations 
that are important in the investment decision-making process. For example, 
financial statements tell you whether or not a company is fiscally fit. Legal 
matters (like big lawsuits) that are material (important enough to influence 
an investor’s decision to buy or sell a stock) in nature can also be found at 
these sites. Any material changes, like a new senior executive appointment 
or a major shift in operations to China, would also be described in a filing in 
SEDAR or EDGAROnline.
	
Be aware of the fact that annual reports may include more than 50 pages, and 
they often exceed 100 pages. For example, Canadian and U.S. annual reports 
include financial statements with notes; supplementary data; wordy manage­
ment discussions of financial conditions and operations results; business 
descriptions; legal proceedings; shareholder voting matters; insider transac­
tions; executive compensation; and leasing agreements. Fun stuff! So be selec­
tive about how much information you want — and need — to download.

95
 Chapter 6: Gathering Information
When you search the EDGAR databases, you’re asked (via a drop-down 
screen or report number) which type of document you want. The reports are 
organized in this manner:
	
✓	Annual reports and filings (10-K Reports in EDGAR): Annual reports 
that include shareholder information covering the firm’s fiscal year
	
✓	Quarterly financial statements (10-Q Reports in EDGAR): Quarterly 
reports that include shareholder information for the company’s last 
quarter
	
✓	Notices of material changes (8-K Reports in EDGAR): Special reports 
that are the result of a significant contract, lawsuit, or other material 
event
	
✓	EDGAR S-1 registrations: Forms required for businesses that want to 
offer stock to the public, often used for initial public offerings (IPOs); an 
S-3 registration is used to offer stock to the public in a secondary offer­
ing after an IPO
	
✓	Notices of annual or special meetings (14-A Forms in EDGAR): 
Information about annual general meetings (AGMs) and voting matters 
such as candidates seeking election to the board of directors, approval 
of the increase in authorized capital stock, and/or approval of a merger 
or acquisition
	
When you want to get big-picture information about a company, take a look at 
the reports that companies must file with SEDAR or EDGAROnline. By search­
ing these repositories, you can find companies’ balance sheets, income state­
ments, and other related information. You can verify what others say and get 
a fuller picture of a company’s activities and financial condition. All this infor­
mation will help you make better investment decisions.

Going for Brokers
In This Chapter
▶	Finding out what brokers do

▶	Selecting a broker
▶	Considering online brokers
▶	Exploring the types of brokerage accounts
▶	Figuring out what brokers’ recommendations mean
▶	Examining brokerage reports
W
hen you’re ready to dive in and start investing in stocks, you first 
have to choose a broker. It’s kind of like buying a car: You can do all 
the research in the world and know exactly what kind of car you want to buy; 
still, you need a venue to do the actual transaction. Similarly, when you want 
to buy stock, your task is to do all the research you can to select the com­
pany you want to invest in. Still, you need a broker to actually buy the stock, 
whether you buy over the phone or online. In this chapter, we introduce you 
to the intricacies of the investor/broker relationship.
For information on various types of orders you can place with a broker, such 
as market orders, stop-loss orders, and so on, flip to Chapter 21.
Defining the Broker’s Role
The broker’s primary role is to serve as the vehicle through which you either 
buy or sell stock. When we talk about brokers, we’re referring to organiza­
tions such as TD Waterhouse, BMO InvestorLine, HSBC InvestDirect, and 
many others that can buy stock on your behalf. Brokers can also be individu­
als who work for such firms. Although you can buy some stocks directly from 
the company that issues them, to purchase most stocks, you still need a 
broker.

98
Part II: Before You Invest 
Brokers primarily buy and sell securities, such as stocks (keep in mind that 
the word securities refers to the world of financial or paper investments and 
that stocks are only a small part of that world). But they can also perform 
other tasks for you, including the following:
	
✓	Providing advisory services: Investors pay brokers a fee for investment 
advice. Customers also get access to the firm’s research.
	
✓	Offering limited banking services: Brokers can offer banking features 
like interest-bearing accounts, cheque writing, and direct deposit.
	
✓	Brokering other securities: Brokers can also buy bonds, mutual funds, 
options, exchange-traded funds, and other investments on your behalf.
Personal stockbrokers make their money from individual investors — like 
you, and us too — through various fees, including these:
	
✓	Brokerage commissions: These fees are for buying and/or selling stocks 
and other securities.
	
✓	Margin interest charges: Interest is charged to investors for borrowing 
against their brokerage account for investment purposes.
	
✓	Service charges: These charges are for performing administrative tasks 
and other functions. Brokers charge fees to investors for administer­
ing Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), Registered Education 
Saving Plans (RESPs), for mailing stocks in certificate form, and for other 
special services.
	
The distinction between personal stockbrokers and institutional stockbrokers 
is important. Institutional brokers make money from institutions and compa­
nies through investment banking and securities placement fees (such as initial 
public offerings and secondary offerings), advisory services, and other broker 
services. Personal stockbrokers generally offer the same services to individu­
als and small businesses.
Distinguishing between Investment 
Advisers and Discount Brokers
Stockbrokers fall into two basic categories: investment advisers (sometimes 
known as full-service brokers) and discount brokers. The type you choose 
really depends on what type of investor you are. In a nutshell, investment 
advisers are suitable for investors who need some guidance. Discount bro­
kers are better for those investors who are sufficiently confident and knowl­
edgeable about stock investing to manage with minimal help.

99
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
Investment advisers
Investment advisers are just what the name indicates. They try to provide as 
many services as possible for investors who open accounts with them. When 
you open an account at a brokerage firm, a representative is assigned to your 
account. This representative may be called an account executive, a registered 
rep, or a financial consultant by the brokerage firm. This person usually has a 
securities licence and is knowledgeable about stocks in particular and invest­
ing in general.
HSBC InvestDirect, RBC Dominion Securities, and TD Waterhouse Private 
Investment Advice have many investment advisers. Of course, all broker­
age houses now have full-feature Web sites to give you information about 
their services. Get as informed as possible before you open your full-service 
account. An investment adviser should be there to help make your fortune, 
not to help make you . . . uh . . . broker.
What they can do for you
Your investment adviser is responsible for assisting you, answering ques­
tions about your account and the securities in your portfolio, and transacting 
your buy and sell orders. Here are some things that investment advisers can 
do for you:
	
✓	Offer guidance and advice: The greatest distinction between invest­
ment advisers and discount brokers is the personal attention you 
receive from your account rep. You get to be on a first-name basis with 
an investment adviser, and you disclose much information about your 
finances and financial goals. The rep is there to make recommendations 
about stocks and funds that are likely to be suitable for you.
	
✓	Provide access to research: Investment advisers can give you access 
to their investment research department, which can give you in-depth 
information and analysis on a particular company. This information 
can be very valuable, but be aware of the pitfalls. (See the section 
“Evaluating Brokers’ Recommendations” in this chapter.)
	
✓	Help you achieve your investment objectives: Beyond advice on spe­
cific investments, a good rep gets to know you and your investment 
goals and then offers advice and answers your questions about how spe­
cific investments and strategies can help you accomplish your wealth-
building goals.
	
✓	Make investment decisions on your behalf: Many investors don’t want 
to be bothered when it comes to investment decisions. Investment 
advisers can actually make decisions for your account with your autho­
rization. This service is fine, but insist they give you a reasonable expla­
nation of their choices.

100
Part II: Before You Invest 
What to watch out for
Although investment advisers — with their seemingly limitless assistance — 
can make life easy for an investor, you need to remember some important 
points to avoid problems:
	
✓	Advisers and account reps are still salespeople. Most are honest; some 
are complete shills. No matter how well they treat you, they’re still 
compensated based on their ability to produce revenue for the broker­
age firm. They generate commissions and fees from you on behalf of the 
company. (In other words, they’re paid to sell you things.)
	
✓	Some advisers don’t give clear reasons for their decisions. Once again, 
whenever your rep makes a suggestion or recommendation be sure to 
ask why — and request a complete answer that includes the reasoning 
behind the recommendation. A good adviser is able to clearly explain 
the reasoning behind every suggestion. If you don’t fully understand and 
agree with the advice, don’t take it.
	
✓	Investment advisers can be costly. Working with an investment adviser 
costs more than working with a discount broker. Discount brokers are 
paid simply for performing the act of buying or selling stocks for you. 
Investment advisers do that and more. Additionally, they provide advice 
and guidance. Because of that, investment advisers are more expensive 
(higher brokerage commissions and advisory fees). Also, most invest­
ment advisers expect you to invest at least $5,000 to $10,000 just to open 
an account. Grr . . .
	
✓	Some brokers make bad decisions for you. Handing over decision-
making authority to your rep can be a possible negative because letting 
others make financial decisions for you is always dicey — especially 
when they’re using your money. If they make poor investment choices 
that lose you money, you may not have any recourse because you 
authorized them to act on your behalf.
	
✓	Many investment advisers engage in an activity called churning. 
Churning is basically buying and selling stocks for the sole purpose of 
generating commissions. Churning is great for investment advisers but 
really hurts customers. If your account shows a lot of activity, definitely 
ask for justification. Commissions, especially those charged by invest­
ment advisers, can take a big bite out of your wealth. Don’t tolerate 
churning or any other suspicious activity.
Discount brokers
Perhaps you don’t need any hand holding from a broker. You know what 
you want, and you can make your own investment decisions. All you need 
is someone to transact your buy/sell orders. In that case, go with a discount 
broker. They don’t offer advice or premium services — just the basics 

101
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
required to perform your stock transactions. Discount brokers let you buy 
and sell through the Internet or by phone (touch tone or via a live represen­
tative who executes orders without providing advice).
Discount brokers, as the name implies, are cheaper to engage than invest­
ment advisers. Because you’re advising yourself (or getting advice from third 
parties such as newsletters or independent advisers), you can save on the 
costs you incur when you pay for an investment adviser.
	
If you choose to work with a discount broker, you must know as much as pos­
sible about your personal goals and needs. You have a greater responsibility 
for conducting adequate research to make good stock selections. You must be 
prepared to accept the outcome, whatever that outcome may be.
What they can do for you
Discount brokers offer some significant advantages over investment advisers, 
such as
	
✓	Lower cost: This lower cost is usually the result of lower commissions, 
and it’s the primary benefit of using discount brokers.
	
✓	Unbiased service: Discount brokers offer you the ability to just transact 
your stock buy/sell orders only. Because they don’t offer advice, they 
have no vested interest in trying to sell you any particular stock.
	
✓	Access to information: Established discount brokers offer extensive 
educational and research materials at their offices or on their Web sites.
What to watch out for
Of course, doing business with discount brokers also has its downside, 
including the following:
	
✓	No guidance: Because you’ve chosen a discount broker, you know not 
to expect guidance, but the broker should make this fact clear to you 
anyway. If you’re a knowledgeable investor, the lack of advice is consid­
ered a positive thing — no interference.
	
✓	Hidden fees: Discount brokers may shout about their lower commis­
sions, but commissions aren’t their only way of making money. Many 
discount brokers charge extra for services that you may think are 
included, such as issuing a stock certificate, letting you access certain 
types of research, or mailing a statement. Ask whether they assess fees 
for maintaining RRSPs or fees for transferring stocks and other securi­
ties (such as bonds) in or out of your account. Find out what interest 
rates they charge for borrowing through brokerage accounts.
	
✓	Minimal customer service: If you deal with a discount brokerage firm, 
find out about its customer-service capability. If you can’t transact busi­
ness on its Web site, find out where you can call for assistance with your 
order.

102
Part II: Before You Invest 
Choosing a Broker
Before you choose a broker, you must resolve a few issues. The first issue is 
the broker’s hair colour. Okay, okay, we’ll stop the cheap jokes. Really, after 
you’ve decided whether to go the investment adviser or discount broker 
route, make sure you select a reputable brokerage firm.
Look for a firm that’s a member in good standing of IIROC — the Investment 
Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (www.iiroc.ca). IIROC is 
Canada’s self-regulatory organization, which oversees all member investment 
dealers. It also watches out for trading activity on debt and equity markets in 
Canada. IIROC was established in 2008 through the merger of the Investment 
Dealers Association and other regulatory bodies. It sets regulatory and 
investment industry standards, tries to protect investor interests, and 
attempts to strengthen market integrity while maintaining smoothly operat­
ing capital markets.
	
In addition to performing the above “reference check,” be sure to check out 
the provincial securities commissions. They have a national group that works 
toward making securities regulations consistent and standardized across 
Canada. This group is called the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA; 
www.securities-administrators.ca). Through the CSA, securities regu­
lators from each of the ten provinces and three territories have teamed up to 
protect Canadian investors from “unfair, improper, or fraudulent practices” 
and to foster “fair and efficient capital markets.”
	
However organized they are, provincial securities commissions possess 
nowhere near the power that’s wielded by the more independent regulators 
of U.S. stock markets. As a result, options and remedies to the Canadian indi­
vidual stock investor are very limited.
Revisiting your personal investing style
Before you choose a broker, you need to analyze and reassess your personal 
investing style. When you know yourself and the way you invest, you can pro­
ceed to finding the kind of broker that fits your needs. It’s almost like choos­
ing shoes: if you don’t know your size, you can’t get a proper fit. (And if you 
get it wrong, you can be in for a really uncomfortable future.)
Consider Bob and Ed. Both men are knowledgeable, confident, and competent 
investors, so they each choose a discount broker — makes sense. Bob likes 
to trade stocks very frequently. Ed is a buy-and-hold type, but he likes to use 

103
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
margin. Trading on margin means using the stocks and other securities in your 
brokerage account as collateral to purchase more shares. (See Chapter 21 for 
more on margin.) Which discount broker is suitable for which investor?
Imagine two discount brokers, JumpCo and StayCo. JumpCo charges $9 per 
trade, and StayCo charges $25. However, when it comes to margin trading, 
JumpCo charges 10 percent, but StayCo usually charges a full percentage 
point lower.
In this example, JumpCo is better suited to Bob’s style of investing, but 
StayCo is better for Ed. Because Bob likes to trade frequently, the commis­
sion charge makes it more economical. Ed will pay a higher commission, but 
he’ll eventually make his money back through lower margin interest costs.
This example clearly illustrates how different investors can benefit by analyz­
ing themselves and then choosing an appropriate broker.
Making the decision
When the time comes to choose a broker, keep the following points in mind:
	
✓	Match your investment style with an IIROC-member brokerage firm that 
charges the least amount of money for the services you’re likely to use 
most frequently.
	
✓	Compare all the costs of buying, selling, and holding stocks and other 
securities through a broker. Don’t look only at commissions; compare 
other costs, too, such as margin interest and other service charges.
	
✓	Contact a few firms before making your selection. Ask them if they are 
currently seeking accounts like yours. Ask for and call a few references 
to find out about the broker’s strengths and weaknesses.
	
✓	If you select the investment adviser route, ask for a recommendation 
of one or more brokers at the brokerage who would be appropriate to 
handle your account and then interview them.
	
✓	Read articles that compare brokers in publications and newspapers 
such as Canadian Business, The Globe and Mail, and the National Post.
Your broker will influence your finances in a big way, so take the time to get 
to know your new financial friend to decide whether this is the right person 
for you.

104
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
The Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF) is overseen by the Canadian 
investment industry and provides coverage for Canadians making investments 
through its members. It insures brokerage accounts similar to the way the 
Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) insures bank accounts. CIPF 
covers a customer’s general accounts — up to $1,000,000 — for losses related 
to securities, commodity and futures contracts, segregated insurance funds, 
and cash balances. However, the amount of cash losses that you can claim as 
part of this limit is restricted, and other important coverage restrictions exist. 
Check out the CIPF Web site (www.cipf.ca) for full and detailed information. 
By the way — you aren’t covered if the market corrects! When a market goes 
way higher or lower than it should, a natural tendency exists for stock indexes 
to respond by falling or rising rapidly and settle into a more “normal” state.
	
Investing is no more than the allocation of capital for use by an enterprise 
with the idea of achieving a suitable return. He or she who allocates capital 
best wins!
Online Investing Services
Investing online has flourished for several reasons. Online investing, via a 
discount brokerage service (conventional or Internet-centric), lets you buy 
and sell stocks and other financial instruments using your personal computer 
and an Internet connection. As we mention earlier, discount brokers provide 
most online broker services, but many investment advisers work for firms 
that support online services, as well. Several factors contribute to the popu­
larity of online investing:
Interviewing individual brokers
Ask about the individual broker’s education 
and experience. If he or she has successfully 
completed an appropriate course of study, 
that points to a certain degree of skill and 
knowledge required for the job. (The Canadian 
Securities Institute [www.csi.ca] offers a 
wide variety of courses and certifications that 
are required or recommended for individuals 
beginning or enhancing careers throughout the 
financial services industry.)
Enquire about the broker’s typical client profile. 
Are clients growth or income investors? Are 
they young professionals, or persons entering 
retirement? Brokers with profiles consistent 
with your own needs will be better tuned to 
your investment objectives. Knowing that your 
broker has other clients who are much like you 
can be reassuring.
Also discuss expected outcomes. Outcomes 
include the type of services you’re seeking, 
types of research and recommendations to 
expect, and desired returns.

105
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
	
✓	Information aplenty: The Internet provides quick and easy access to 
raw investment information (such as a stock quote) as well as refined 
information (such as a broker’s analysis of a company, or other informa­
tion services previously available only to investment professionals).
	
✓	Lower commission rates: By eliminating the need for actual brokers 
or advisers, online brokers can offer commission rates that are lower 
than offline brokers charge. For example, buying 500 shares of Potash 
Corporation through a traditional investment adviser could cost you 
about $100 in commissions. Online, the cost is only about $35. Easy 
account access is another reason for the popularity of online investing. 
Online brokers conveniently provide you with access to your account 
and the ability to place orders anytime and anywhere in Canada (or 
abroad) as long as you have an Internet connection.
	
✓	You’re in charge: Control of the investment process appeals to many 
investors. You can research a company, buy shares in it, monitor its 
progress, and chat with other shareholders in that company to hear 
their opinions.
Getting online trading services for less
As you may have guessed, no two online brokerage services are alike. 
Furthermore, individual brokerages may change their services and fees to 
keep pace with their competitors. To find the online broker that best meets 
your needs, you must investigate the prices, services, and features that vari­
ous brokers offer.
	
Make certain that your brokerage doesn’t charge you for services that are free 
elsewhere, or are hidden. Some hidden fees may include:
	
✓	Fees to close your account.
	
✓	Fees to withdraw funds from your trading account.
	
✓	Higher fees for accepting odd-lot orders (for example, orders that include 
increments of fewer than 100 shares).
Trading online at a discount
You can’t measure broker service with a formula. You have to look at both 
financial and non-financial criteria.

106
Part II: Before You Invest 
Cost is one factor, as we just found out. Definitely look at how much each 
broker charges in commission at different volumes of trades. Also assess 
the quality of online trade execution by talking to others who use a service 
that you are considering. Are real-time quotes available? Is research material 
available? What is the overall ease of use of the service? Does the broker pro­
vide online screening tools?
Product selection is another important factor. You want to be able to trade 
things like guaranteed investment certificates (GICs), gold and silver certifi­
cates, municipal bonds, futures, Canadian and foreign equities, and so on. A 
list of investment products to consider is provided later in this chapter.
Response time should be quick. Some online brokers boast trade execution 
times of less than nine seconds! Phone each firm to see how long it takes 
for the broker to respond. E-mail each broker under consideration with a 
few questions; ask for an application to be sent by mail. Again, evaluate the 
response time.
Table 7-1 lists several discount brokerage services in Canada.
Checking out special features
Commission structures range widely from firm to firm because some Internet 
brokers include special or added features. When deciding which broker 
is best for you, factor in some or all of the features that we list in this sec­
tion. First, consider whether each broker offers these features in your cash 
account:
	
✓	Confirmation of trades (via e-mail, phone, or Canada Post)
	
✓	Consolidation of your money market, investment, and chequing and sav­
ings accounts
	
✓	Historical review of your trading activities
	
✓	Low minimum amount required to open an account
	
✓	Low or no fees with minimum equity balance
	
✓	Summary of your portfolio’s value

Also, find out which of the following types of investments the broker enables 
you to trade:
	
✓	Bonds (corporate, agency, or municipal)
	
✓	Canada and provincial savings bonds
	
✓	Commercial paper
	
✓	Government of Canada and U.S. Treasury bills
	
✓	Guaranteed investment certificates (GICs)
	
✓	Investment trusts
	
✓	Mutual funds
	
✓	Options
	
✓	Precious metals
	
✓	Stocks (foreign or domestic)
	
✓	Treasury notes
Finally, determine whether the brokerage offers the following analytical and 
research features:
	
✓	Company profiles and breaking news
	
✓	Economic forecasts
	
✓	End-of-day prices automatically sent to you
	
✓	Real-time online quotes
	
✓	Reports on insider trading
Opening your online brokerage account
Internet brokerage firms are basically cash-and-carry enterprises. They all 
require investors to open an account before trading — a process that takes 
from one to two weeks to complete. Because most Canadian brokerages don’t 
require minimum account balances, you can open an account with a nominal 
deposit. However, you can buy only so many shares of EnCana with $300 in 
your account!
When you place an order, your Internet broker withdraws money from your 
cash account to cover your trade. If you sell stock or receive a dividend, 
the Internet broker adds money to your cash account. All Internet brokers 
require that you complete an application form (which you can download 
online by following the instructions given at the Web site). The form will ask 
for your name, address, and social insurance number; your work history; 
and a personal cheque, certified cheque, or money order for the minimum 

109
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
amount (if any) needed to open an account. Canadian law requires all broker­
ages to have your signature on file. The Internet broker then verifies all the 
information on the form and opens your account. Investors are sent a per­
sonal identification number (PIN) by mail. After you receive your PIN, you’re 
ready to begin trading.
Types of Brokerage Accounts
After you start investing in the stock market, you have to somehow pay for 
the stocks you buy. Most brokerage firms offer investors several different 
types of accounts, each serving a different purpose. We present three of the 
most common types in the following sections. The basic difference boils 
down to how particular brokers view your creditworthiness when it comes to 
buying and selling securities. If your credit isn’t great, your only choice is a 
cash account. If your credit is good, you can open either a cash account or a 
margin account. After you qualify for a margin account, you can (with addi­
tional approval) upgrade it to do options trades.
To open an account, you have to fill out an application and submit a cheque 
or money order for at least the minimum amount required to establish an 
account.
Cash accounts
A cash account means just what you think it means. You must deposit a 
sum of money along with the new account application to begin trading. The 
amount of your initial deposit varies from broker to broker. Although some 
brokers have a minimum of $10,000, others let you open an account for as 
little as $75. Once in a while you may see a broker offering cash accounts 
with no minimum deposit, usually as part of a promotion. Use the resources 
in Appendix B to help you shop around. Qualifying for a cash account is usu­
ally easy as long as you have cash and a pulse.
With a cash account, your money has to be deposited in the account before 
the closing (or settlement) date for any trade you make. The closing occurs 
three business days after the date you make the trade (the date of execution).
In other words, if you call your broker on Monday, October 10, and order 50 
shares of CashLess Corp. at $20 per share, then on Thursday, October 13, 
you better have $1,000 in cash sitting in your account (plus commission). 
Otherwise, the purchase doesn’t go through.

110
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
If you have cash in a brokerage account, see whether the broker will pay you 
interest on the uninvested cash in it, and how much. Some offer a service in 
which uninvested money earns money market rates.
Margin accounts
A margin account gives you the ability to borrow money against the securities 
in the account to buy more stock. Because you have the ability to borrow in 
a margin account, you have to be qualified and approved by the broker. After 
you’re approved, this newfound credit gives you more leverage so that you 
can buy more stock or do short-selling. (You can read more about buying on 
margin and short-selling in Chapter 21.)
Why use margin? “Margin” is to stocks what “mortgage” is to real estate. You 
can buy real estate with 100 percent cash, but many times using borrowed 
funds makes sense because you may not have enough money or you prefer 
not to pay all cash. With margin, you could, for example, be able to buy 
$10,000 worth of stock with as little as $5,000 in cash (or securities owned) 
sitting in your account. This example assumes a 50-percent margin limit. The 
balance of the stock purchase is acquired using a loan (margin) from the bro­
kerage firm.
For stock trading, the margin limit is usually 50 percent. (For very conserva­
tive stocks, the margin limit can be as high as 70 percent; ask your broker to 
inform you about margin limits on a stock-by-stock basis.) The interest rate 
that you pay varies depending on the broker, but most brokers generally 
charge a rate that’s several points higher than their own borrowing rate.
Option accounts
An option account gives you all the capabilities of a margin account (which 
in turn also gives you the capabilities of a cash account) plus the ability to 
trade options on stocks and stock indexes. To upgrade your margin account 
to an options account, your Canadian broker must by law ask you to sign 
a statement that you’re knowledgeable about options and familiar with the 
risks associated with them.
Options can be a very effective addition to a stock investor’s array of wealth-
building investment tools. A more comprehensive review of options is avail­
able in the book Stock Options For Dummies by Alan R. Simon (Wiley).

 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
Evaluating Brokers’ Recommendations
Canadians have become enamoured of a new spectator sport: watching bro­
kers rate stocks on the television financial shows. Frequently these shows 
feature a dapper market strategist talking up a particular stock. Some stocks 
have been known to jump significantly right after an influential analyst issues 
a buy recommendation. Analysts’ speculation and opinions make for great 
fun, and many people take their views very seriously. However, most inves­
tors should be very wary when analysts, especially the glib ones on TV, make 
a recommendation.
Understanding basic recommendations
Brokers, and their analytical staff, issue their recommendations as a general 
idea of how much regard they have for a particular stock. The following list 
presents the basic recommendations (or ratings) and what they mean to you:
	
✓	Strong buy and buy: Hot diggity dog! These ratings are the ones to get. 
The analyst loves this pick, and you would be very wise to get a bunch 
of shares. The thing to keep in mind, however, is that buy recommenda­
tions are about as common as snow in Alberta. Let’s face it, brokers 
exist to sell stocks!
	
✓	Accumulate and market perform: An analyst who issues these types of 
recommendations is positive, yet unexcited, about the pick. This rating 
is akin to asking a friend whether he likes your new suit and getting the 
response “it’s nice” in a monotone voice. It’s a polite reply, but you wish 
his opinion had been more enthusiastic.
	
✓	Hold or neutral: Analysts use this language when their backs are to the 
wall, but they still don’t want to yell, “Sell that loser!” This recommenda­
tion reminds us of mothers telling kids to be nice — to either say some­
thing positive or keep quiet. In this case, this rating is the analyst’s way 
of keeping quiet.
	
✓	Sell: Many analysts should have issued this recommendation during 
2000 and 2001, but few actually uttered it. They, and some of the bro­
kerage houses they worked for, sold their souls for the almighty dollar! 
What a shame.
	
✓	Avoid like the plague: We’re just kidding about this one, but we wish 
that this recommendation was available. We’ve seen plenty of stocks 
that we thought were dreadful investments — stocks of companies that 
made no money and were in such terrible financial condition that they 
should never have been considered at all. Yet investors gobble up bil­
lions of dollars’ worth of stocks that eventually become worthless.

112
Part II: Before You Invest 
Asking a few important questions
Don’t get us wrong. An analyst’s recommendation is certainly a better tip 
than what you’d get from your barber or your sister-in-law’s neighbour, but 
you want to view recommendations from analysts with a healthy dose of 
reality. Analysts have biases because their employment depends on the very 
companies that are being presented. What investors need to listen to when a 
broker talks up a stock is the reasoning behind the recommendation. In other 
words, why is the broker making this recommendation?
Keep in mind that analysts’ recommendations can play a useful role in your 
personal stock investing research. If you find a great stock and then you hear 
analysts give glowing reports on the same stock, you’re on the right track! 
Here are some questions and points to keep in mind:
	
✓	How does the analyst arrive at a rating? The analyst’s approach to 
evaluating a stock can help you round out your research as you consult 
other sources such as newsletters and independent advisory services.
	
✓	What analytical approach is the analyst using? Some analysts use fun­
damental analysis (looking at the company’s financial condition and fac­
tors related to its success, such as its standing within the industry and 
the overall market). Other analysts use technical analysis (looking at the 
company’s stock price history and judging past stock price movements 
to derive some insight regarding the stock’s future price movement). 
Many analysts use a combination of the two. Is this analyst’s approach 
similar to your approach or to those of sources that you respect or 
admire?
	
✓	What is the analyst’s track record? Has the analyst had a consistently 
good record through both bull and bear markets? Major financial publi­
cations, such as Barron’s and Investor’s Digest of Canada (www.investors
digestofcanada.com), and Web sites, such as MarketWatch (market
watch.com) and Canoe Money (money.canoe.ca), regularly track 
recommendations from well-known analysts and stock pickers.
	
✓	How does the analyst treat important aspects of the company’s perfor­
mance, such as sales and earnings? How about the company’s balance 
sheet? The essence of a healthy company is growing sales and earnings 
coupled with strong assets and low debt.
	
✓	Is the industry that the company is in doing well? Does the analyst give 
you insight on this important information? A strong company in a weak 
industry can’t stay strong for long.
	
✓	What research sources does the analyst cite? Does the analyst quote 
the Canadian government or industry trade groups to support his 
or her thesis? These sources are important because they help give a 

113
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
more complete picture regarding the company’s prospects for success. 
Imagine that you decide on the stock of a strong company. But what if 
the federal government (through agencies such as the Ontario Securities 
Commission) is penalizing the company for fraudulent activity? Or what 
if the company’s industry is shrinking or has ceased to grow (making 
it tougher for the company to continue growing)? The astute investor 
looks at a variety of sources before buying stock.
	
✓	Is the analyst rational when citing a target price for a stock? When 
Anna the analyst says, “We think the stock will hit $100 per share within 
12 months,” is she presenting a rational model, such as basing the share 
price on a projected price/earnings ratio? The analyst must be able to pro­
vide a logical scenario about why the stock has a good chance of achiev­
ing the cited target price within the time frame mentioned. You may not 
necessarily agree with the analyst’s conclusion, but the explanation can 
help you decide whether the stock choice was well thought out.
	
✓	Does the company that is being recommended have any ties to the 
analyst or the analyst’s firm? During 2000–02, the financial industry got 
bad publicity because many analysts gave positive recommendations on 
stocks of companies that were doing business with the very firms that 
employed those analysts. This conflict of interest is probably the biggest 
reason why analysts were so wrong in their recommendations during 
that period. Ask your broker to disclose any conflict of interest.
	
The bottom line with brokerage recommendations is that you shouldn’t use 
them to buy or sell a stock. Instead, use them to confirm your own research. 
We know that if we buy a stock based on our own research and later discover 
the same stock being talked up on the financial shows, that’s just the icing on 
the cake. The experts may be great to listen to, and their recommendations 
can augment your own opinions; however, they’re no substitute for your own 
careful research.
Brokerage Reports: The Good, 
the Bad, and the Ugly
Clint Eastwood, where are you? Traditionally, brokerage (analyst) reports —
research-based documents with a buy, sell, or hold recommendation that 
include a stock’s target price and the underlying quantitative and qualitative 
rationale behind that price — have been a good source of information for 
investors seeking informed opinions about stocks. And they still are, but some 
brokerage reports have gotten bad press in recent years — and deservedly so.

114
Part II: Before You Invest 
The good
Research departments at brokerage firms provide stock reports and make 
them available for their clients and investment publications. The firms’ ana­
lysts and market strategists generally prepare these reports. Good research 
is critical, and brokerage reports can be very valuable. What better source of 
guidance than full-time experts backed up by million-dollar research depart­
ments? Brokerage reports have some strong points:
	
✓	The analysts are certified professionals who should understand the 
value of a company and its stock. They analyze and compare company 
data every day.
	
✓	They have at their disposal tremendous information and historical data 
that they can sift through to make informed decisions.
	
✓	If you have an account with the firm, you can usually access some of the 
information for free.
During the late 1990s, some of these analysts gained celebrity status as the 
public fervour over stock investing turned it into a national pastime. Analysts 
said, “X is a great stock. Buy it.” Millions bought. Stocks soared. Brokerage 
firms made tonnes of money. Analysts got million-dollar bonuses. Common 
investors became wealthier. And they lived happily ever after! (Ahem, don’t 
stop here. Keep reading . . .)
The bad
Well, brokerage reports may not be bad in every case, but at their worst 
they’re quite bad. Brokers make their money from commissions and invest­
ment banking fees (nothing bad here). However, they can find themselves 
in the awkward position of issuing brokerage reports on companies that are 
(or could be) customers for the brokerage firm that employs them (hmm — 
could be bad). Frequently, this relationship can result in a brokerage report 
that paints an overly positive picture of a company that’s a poor investment 
(yup, that’s bad).
	
Sometimes, good research can be compromised by conflicts of interest, even 
when that conflict of interest is disclosed to the public.
As recently as 2008, a very large number of brokerage reports issued glow­
ing praise for companies that were either mediocre or dubious. Investors 
bought up stocks in the retail, bank, and automotive sectors big time. The 
sheer demand pushed up stock prices, which gave the appearance of genius 
to analysts’ forecasts, yet they rose essentially as a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
The stocks were very overvalued and were flying on a wing and a prayer. By 
March 2009, Canadians saw exactly how overvalued they were!

115
 Chapter 7: Going for Brokers
The ugly
Investors lost a tonne of money (yuck, ugly) in 2009. Money that was pains­
takingly accumulated over many years of work vanished in a matter of 
months (even uglier). Retirees who had trusted some smooth-talking but slip­
pery analysts saw nest eggs lose 30 to 60 percent in value (yikes, very ugly). 
In total, Canadian investors lost billions during 2008 and 2009, much of it 
needlessly. Both Bay Street and Main Street learned some tough lessons.
Regarding research reports from brokerage firms, the following points can 
help you avoid getting a bad case of the uglies:
	
✓	Always ask yourself, “Is the provider of the report a biased source?” In 
other words, is the broker getting business in any way from the com­
pany that is being recommended?
	
✓	Never, never, never rely on just one source of information, especially if it 
is the same source that is selling you the stock or other investment.
	
✓	Do your research first, before you rely on a brokerage report.
	
✓	Do your due diligence before you buy stocks, anyway. Look at the chap­
ters in Part I and Part II to understand your need for diversification, risk 
tolerance, and so on.
	
✓	Verify the information provided with a trip to the library or a surf on the 
Net (see Appendix B).
Clint would be proud.

Investing for Growth
In This Chapter
▶	Defining growth stocks
▶	Figuring out how to choose growth stocks
▶	Looking at small-cap and other speculative investments
W
hat’s the number-one reason people invest in stocks? To grow their 
wealth. (This is also referred to as capital appreciation.) Yes, some 
people invest for income (in the form of dividends), but that’s a different 
matter handled in Chapter 9. Investors seeking growth would rather see the 
money that could have been paid to them as dividends be reinvested in the 
company. In this way (hopefully), a greater gain is achieved by seeing the 
stock’s price rise, or appreciate.
People interested in growing their wealth see stocks as one of the conve­
nient ways to do it. Growth stocks tend to be riskier than other categories of 
stocks, but they offer excellent long-term prospects for making the big bucks. 
If you don’t believe us, then just ask Warren Buffett, Jim Rogers, Peter Lynch, 
and other successful investors. Although someone like Warren Buffett is not 
considered to be a growth investor, his long-term, value-oriented approach 
has had a great track record, though his holdings have not been immune 
to recent market volatility. (Value stocks are stocks that are priced lower 
than the underlying value of the company and its assets — you can identify 
a value stock by analyzing the company’s fundamentals and looking at key 
financial ratios, such as the price-to-earnings ratio. For more on the topic of 
ratios, see Appendix A.)
If you’re the type of investor who has enough time to let somewhat risky 
stocks trend upward, or who has enough money so that a loss won’t devas­
tate you financially, then growth stocks are definitely for you. As they say, 
no guts, no glory. The challenge is to figure out which stocks will make you 
richer quicker.

118
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
Short of starting your own business, stock investing is the best way to profit 
from a business venture. We want to emphasize that to make money in stocks 
consistently over the long haul, you must remember that you’re investing in a 
company. Buying the stock is just a means for you to participate in the compa­
ny’s success (or failure).
	
What does it matter that you think of stock investing as buying a company 
versus buying a stock? Invest in a stock only if you’re just as excited about it 
as you would be if you were the CEO and in charge of running the company. 
If you’re the sole owner of the company, do you act differently than one of a 
legion of obscure shareholders? Of course you do. As the owner of the com­
pany, you have a greater interest in the company. You have a strong desire to 
know how the enterprise is doing. As you invest in stocks, make believe you’re 
the owner and take an active interest in the company’s products, services, 
sales, earnings, and so on. This attitude and discipline can enhance your goals 
as a stock investor. This approach is especially important if your investment 
goal is growth.
Understanding Growth Stocks
A stock is considered a growth stock when it’s growing faster and higher than 
the overall stock market. Basically, a growth stock performs better than its 
peers in categories such as sales and earnings. Growth stocks also tend to 
have solid prospects for growth for the immediate future (from one to 
four years).
Over the years, a debate has continued in the financial community about 
growth investing versus value investing. Some people believe that growth 
and value are mutually exclusive. They maintain that large numbers of people 
buying stock with growth as the expectation tend to drive up the stock price 
relative to the company’s current value. Growth investors, for example, 
aren’t put off by price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 25, 30, or higher. Value 
investors, meanwhile, tend to be too nervous to buy a stock at those P/E 
ratio levels.
However, you most definitely can have both. A value-oriented approach to 
growth investing serves you best. Long-term-growth stock investors spend 
time analyzing the company’s fundamentals to make sure the company’s 
growth prospects lie on a solid foundation. But what if you have to choose 
between a growth stock and a value stock? Which do you choose? Seek value 
when you are buying the stock and analyze the company’s prospects for 
growth. Growth includes, but is not limited to, the health and growth of the 
company’s specific industry and the economy at large (which we discuss 
throughout this book).

119
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
	
The bottom line is that growth is much easier to achieve when you seek solid, 
value-oriented companies in growing industries. Chapter 17 explains how 
industries affect stock value.
	
Being a growth investor probably has the longest history of success compared 
to most other stock investing philosophies. The track record for those people 
who use growth investing — especially those who also place an emphasis on 
seeking value at the same time — is enviable. Benjamin Graham and Sir John 
Templeton are two of the more well-known practitioners. Each may have his 
own spin on the concepts, but both have successfully applied the basic princi­
ples of growth investing over many years.
Analyzing Growth Stocks 
for the Very First Time
Although the information in the previous section can help you shrink your 
stock choices from thousands of stocks to maybe a few dozen or a few hun­
dred (depending on how well the general stock market is doing), the purpose 
of this section is to help you cull the so-so growth stocks to unearth the go-go 
ones. It’s time to dig deeper for the biggest potential winners. Keep in mind 
that you probably won’t find a stock to satisfy all the criteria presented here. 
Just make sure that your selection meets as many criteria as realistically pos­
sible. But hey, if you do find a stock that meets all the criteria cited, buy as 
much as you can!
	
When choosing growth stocks, consider investing in a company only if it 
makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where 
it generates sales. Part of your research means looking at the industry a com­
pany operates in (Chapter 17) and economic trends in general (Chapter 10).
Making the right comparison
You have to measure the growth of a company against something to figure 
out whether it’s a growth stock. Usually, you compare the growth of a com­
pany with growth from other companies in the same industry or with the 
stock market in general. In practical terms, when you measure the growth 
of a stock against the stock market, you’re actually comparing it against a 
generally accepted benchmark such as a specific Standard & Poor’s Canadian 
index (S&P/TSX), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), or the Standard & 
Poor’s 500 (S&P 500). For more on indexes, see Chapter 5.

120
Part II: Before You Invest 
If a company has an earnings growth of 15 percent per year over three years 
or more and the industry’s average growth rate over the same time frame is 
10 percent, then this stock qualifies as a growth stock.
	
A growth stock is called that not only because the company is growing but 
also because the company is performing well with some consistency. Having a 
single year where your earnings do well versus the S&P/TSX 60’s or S&P 500’s 
averages doesn’t cut it. Growth must be consistently accomplished.
Checking out a company’s fundamentals
When you hear the word fundamentals in the world of stock investing, it 
refers to the company’s financial condition and related data. When inves­
tors (especially value investors) do fundamental analysis, they look at the 
company’s fundamentals — its balance sheet, income statement, cash flow, 
and other operational data along with external factors such as the company’s 
market position, industry, and economic prospects. Essentially, the funda­
mentals indicate the company’s financial condition. Chapters 12, 13, and 
14 go into greater detail about analyzing a company’s financial condition. 
However, the main numbers you want to look at include the following:
	
✓	Sales: Are the company’s sales this year surpassing last year’s? As a 
decent benchmark, you want to see this year’s sales at least 10 percent 
higher than last year’s. Although the figure may differ depending on the 
industry, 10 percent is a reasonable, general yardstick.
	
✓	Earnings: Are this year’s earnings at least 10 percent higher than last 
year’s? Earnings should grow at the same rate as sales (or, hopefully, at 
a better rate).
	
✓	Debt: Is the company’s total debt for this year equal to or lower than the 
debt from the prior year? The death knell of many a company has been 
excessive debt.
A company’s financial condition has more factors than we mention here, 
but these numbers are the most important. We also realize that using the 
10-percent figure may seem like an oversimplification, but you don’t need to 
complicate matters unnecessarily. We know someone’s computerized finan­
cial model may come out to 9.675 percent, or maybe 11.07 percent, but keep 
it simple for now.
Looking for leaders and megatrends
A strong company mixed with a growing industry is a common recipe for 
success. If you look at the history of stock investing, this point comes up con­
stantly. Investors need to be on the alert for megatrends because they help 
ensure your success.

121
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
What is a megatrend? A megatrend is a major development that has huge 
implications for much (if not all) of society for a long time to come. Good 
examples are the advent of the Internet and the aging of Canada’s popula­
tion. Another trend is the green revolution that is sweeping across North 
America, Europe, and other parts of the world. These trends offer significant 
challenges and opportunities for the Canadian economy and all stock inves­
tors. Take the Internet, for example. Its full potential for economic and social 
application is still being developed. Millions are flocking to it for many rea­
sons. And Statistics Canada data tell us that Canadians over age 55 will be the 
fastest-growing segment of our population during the next decade. How does 
the stock investor take advantage of a megatrend?
Over the last few years, two megatrends hit their stride: rising energy prices 
and an overheated housing market. As of 2009, these two issues remained 
major news items with tremendous ripple effects across the national econ­
omy. For the growth investor, a strategy became clear. Find value-oriented 
companies with solid fundamentals that are well positioned to benefit 
from these megatrends. Then sell! Investors who recognized these trends, 
invested, but did not sell their stock positions failed to actually realize those 
gains by cashing out. (See Chapters 19 and 20 to find out how to navigate 
strategically though up and down markets.)
Buy emerging-growth companies early on, not late in the game when they are 
no longer values. What can be the result? From 2003–08, many energy-related 
and housing-related stocks skyrocketed. As oil surpassed US$130 per barrel 
and gasoline hit CAN$1.40 a litre, most Canadian and foreign oil and oil-ser­
vices companies saw their stocks go up 50 percent, 100 percent, and more. 
Housing-related stocks were even more impressive. In addition, companies 
that cater to these industries also prospered. Mortgage firms that were pub­
licly traded also posted impressive gains.
Considering a company 
with a strong niche
Companies that have established a strong niche are consistently profitable. 
Look for a company with one or more of these characteristics:
	
✓	A strong brand: Public companies such as McCain, Shoppers Drug Mart, 
Coca-Cola, and Microsoft come to mind. Yes, other companies out there 
can sell french fries, shampoo, pop, or software, but a business needs 
a lot more than a similar product to topple companies that have estab­
lished an almost irrevocable identity with the public.
	
✓	High barriers to entry: Rogers Communications, Canadian National 
Railway Company, and Petro-Canada have set up tremendous distribu­
tion and delivery networks that competitors can’t easily duplicate. High 
barriers give companies that are already established an important edge.

122
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
✓	Research and development (R&D): Companies such as Biovail and 
Merck spend a lot of money researching and developing new pharma­
ceutical products. This investment in the company’s future becomes a 
new product with millions of consumers who become loyal purchasers, 
so the company’s going to grow.
Noticing who’s buying and/or 
recommending the stock
You can invest in a great company and still see its stock go nowhere. Why? 
Because what makes the stock go up is demand — having more buyers than 
sellers. If you pick a stock for all the right reasons and the market notices the 
stock as well, that attention causes the stock price to climb. The things to 
watch for include the following:
	
✓	Institutional buying: Are mutual funds and pension plans buying up 
the stock you’re looking at? If so, this type of buying power can exert 
tremendous upward pressure on the stock’s price. Some resources and 
publications track institutional buying and how that affects any par­
ticular stock. (You can find these resources in Appendix B.) Frequently, 
when a mutual fund buys a stock, others soon follow. In spite of all the 
talk about independent research, a herd mentality still exists.
	
✓	Analysts’ attention: Are analysts talking about the stock on the financial 
shows? As much as you should be skeptical about an analyst’s recom­
mendation (given the stock market debacle of a few years ago), it offers 
some positive reinforcement for your stock. Don’t ever buy a stock 
solely on the basis of an analyst’s recommendation. Just know that if 
you buy a stock based on your own research and analysts subsequently 
rave about it, your stock price is likely to go up. A single recommenda­
tion by an influential analyst can be enough to send a stock skyward.
	
✓	Newsletter recommendations: Independent researchers usually publish 
newsletters. If influential newsletters are touting your choice, that praise 
is also good for your stock. Although some great newsletters are out 
there (find them in Appendix B) and offer information that’s as good as 
or better than the research departments of some brokerage firms, don’t 
use a single tip to base your investment decision on. But it should make 
you feel good if the newsletters tout a stock that you’ve already chosen.
	
✓	Consumer publications: No, you won’t find investment advice here. This 
one seems to come out of left field, but it’s a source that you should 
notice. Publications such as Consumer Reports regularly look at products 
and services and rate them for consumer satisfaction. If a company’s 
offerings are well received by consumers, that’s a strong positive for the 
company. This kind of attention ultimately has a positive effect on that 
company’s stock.

 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Learning investing lessons from history
A growth stock isn’t a creature like the Loch Ness monster — always talked 
about but rarely seen. Growth stocks have been part of the financial scene for 
nearly a century. Examples abound that offer rich information you can apply 
to today’s stock market environment. Look at market winners over the past 
few decades, and ask yourself, “What made them profitable stocks?” The ’70s 
were a tough, bearish decade for stocks, and the ’80s and ’90s were booming 
bull times. Being aware of the market environment and acting logically are as 
vital to successful stock investing as they are to any other pursuit. Over and 
over again, history gives you the formula for successful stock investing:
	
✓	Pick a company that has strong fundamentals, including signs such as 
rising sales and earnings with low debt. (See Chapter 12.)
	
✓	Be fully invested in stocks during a bull market, when prices are rising in 
the stock market and in the general economy. (See Chapter 16.)
	
✓	Make sure that the company is in a growing industry. (See Chapter 17.)
	
✓	During a bear market, switch more of your money out of growth stocks 
(such as technology) and into defensive stocks (such as utilities and 
health care).
	
✓	Monitor your stocks. Hold on to stocks that continue to grow, and sell 
those stocks that are declining.
Evaluating the management of a company
The management of a company is crucial to its success. Before you buy stock 
in a company, you want to know that the company’s management is doing a 
great job. But how do you do that? If you call up a company and ask, no one 
may even return your phone call. How do you know whether management is 
running the company properly? The best way is to check the numbers — the 
following sections tell you what to look at. If the company’s management is 
running the business well, the ultimate result is a rising stock price.
Return on equity
Although you can measure how well management is doing in several ways, 
you can get a quick snapshot of a management team’s competence by check­
ing the company’s return on equity (ROE). You calculate the ROE simply by 
dividing earnings by equity. The resulting percentage gives you a good idea 
whether the company is using its equity (or net assets) efficiently and profitably. 

124
Part II: Before You Invest 
Basically, the higher the percentage, the better; however, you can consider 
the ROE solid if the percentage is 10 percent or higher. Keep in mind that not 
all industries have identical ROEs.
To find out a company’s earnings, check out the company’s income state­
ment. The income statement is a simple financial statement that expresses 
the equation sales minus expenses equals net earnings (or net income, or net 
profit). You can see an example of an income statement in Table 8-1. (We give 
more details on income statements in Chapter 12.)
Table 8-1

$82,000
$90,000
Expenses
–$75,000
–$78,000
Net earnings
$7,000
$12,000
To find out a company’s equity, check out that company’s balance sheet. 
(See Chapters 12 and 14 for more details on balance sheets.) The balance 
sheet is actually a simple financial statement that illustrates total assets 
minus total liabilities equals net equity. For public stock companies, the net 
assets are called shareholders’ equity, or simply “equity.” Table 8-2 shows a 
balance sheet for Snowbaby Inc.
Table 8-2

Table 8-1 shows that Snowbaby’s earnings went from $7,000 to $12,000. In 
Table 8-2, you can see that Snowbaby increased its equity from $35,000 to 
$40,000 in one year. The ROE for 2009 is 20 percent ($7,000 in earnings ÷ 
$35,000 in equity), which is a solid number. The following year, the ROE is 30 
percent ($12,000 earnings ÷ $40,000 equity), another solid number.

125
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Equity and earnings growth
Two additional barometers of success are a company’s growth in earnings 
and growth of equity. Look at the growth in earnings in Table 8-1. The earn­
ings grew from $7,000 (in 2009) to $12,000 (in 2010), or a percentage increase 
of 71 percent ($12,000 – $7,000 = $5,000, and $5,000 @ds $7,000 = 71 percent), 
which is excellent. In Table 8-2, Snowbaby’s equity grew by $5,000 (from 
$35,000 to $40,000), or 14 percent, which is very good — management is 
doing good things here.
Protecting your downside
We become a Johnny-one-note on one topic: 
trailing stops. (See Chapter 21 for a full expla­
nation of various defensive trading techniques.) 
Trailing stops are stop-losses that you regularly 
manage with the stock you invest in. We always 
advocate using them, especially if you’re new 
to the game of buying growth stocks. Trailing 
stops can help you, no matter how good or bad 
the economy is (or how good or bad the stock 
you’re investing in is).
Suppose you had invested in JDS Uniphase, a 
classic example of a phenomenal growth stock 
that went bad. In 2000 and 2001, when its stock 
peaked, investors were as happy as choco­
holics at a Cadbury factory. Along with many 
investors who forgot that sound investing takes 
discipline and research, JDS Uniphase inves­
tors thought, “Downside risk? What downside 
risk?”
Here’s an example of how a stop-loss order 
would have worked if you had invested in JDS 
Uniphase. Pretend you’re back in 2000 and you 
buy JDS Uniphase at a split-adjusted price 
of $650 per share (we discuss stock splits in 
Chapter 15) and put in a stop-loss order with 
your broker at $600. (Remember to make it a 
GTC, or good-till-cancelled order. If you do, the 
stop-loss order stays on indefinitely.) As a gen­
eral rule, we like to place the stop-loss order at 
10 percent below the market value. As the stock 
goes up, you keep the stop-loss trailing upward 
like a tail. (Now you know why it’s called a 
“trailing” stop; it trails the stock’s price.) When 
JDS Uniphase hits $750, your stop-loss changes 
to, say, $700, and so on. Now what?
When JDS Uniphase starts its perilous descent, 
you get out at $700. The new price of $700 trig­
gers the stop-loss, and the stock is automati­
cally sold — you stopped the loss! Actually, in 
this case, you could call it a “stop and cash in 
the gain” order. Because you bought the stock 
at $650 and sold at $700, you pocket a respect­
able capital gain of $50 (7.5 percent apprecia­
tion). Now you safely step aside and watch the 
stock continue its plunge. Recently, it has been 
trading in single digits!
What if the market is doing well? Are trailing 
stops a good idea? Because these stops are 
placed below the stock price, you’re not stop­
ping the stock from rising upward indefinitely. 
All you’re doing is protecting your investment 
from loss. That’s discipline! The stock market 
of 2004 to 2007 was fairly good to stock inves­
tors because the bear market that started in 
2000 took a break — at least until 2008 when 
another one started. During a bear market, 
trailing-stop strategies are critical because a 
potential decline in the stock price will become 
a greater risk.

126
Part II: Before You Invest 
Insider buying
Watching management as it manages the business is important, but another 
indicator of how well the company is doing is to see whether management is 
buying stock in the company, as well. If a company is poised for growth, who 
knows better than management? And if management is buying up the com­
pany’s stock en masse, then that’s a great indicator of the stock’s potential. 
See Chapter 15 for more details on insider trading.
Making sure a company 
continues to do well
A company’s financial situation does change, and you, as a diligent inves­
tor, need to continue to look at the numbers for as long as the stock is in 
your portfolio. You may have chosen a great stock from a great company 
with great numbers in 2009, but chances are pretty good the numbers have 
changed since then.
Exploring Small-Caps and 
Speculative Stocks
Everyone wants to get in early on a hot new stock. Why not? You buy 
Shlobotky Inc. at $1 per share and hope it zooms to $98 before lunchtime. 
Who doesn’t want to buy a stock that could become the next Biovail or 
Potash Corporation? This possibility is why investors are attracted to small-
cap stocks.
Small cap (or small capitalization) is a reference to the company’s market 
size. Small-cap stocks are stocks that have a market value under $1 billion. 
Investors may face more risk with small-cap stocks, but they also have the 
chance for greater gains.
Out of all the types of stocks, small-cap stocks continue to exhibit the great­
est amount of growth. In the same way that a tree planted last year has more 
opportunity for growth than a mature 100-year-old redwood, small-caps 
have greater growth potential than established large-cap stocks. Of course, 
a small-cap company doesn’t exhibit spectacular growth just because it’s 
small. It grows when it does the right things, such as increasing sales and 
earnings by producing goods and services that customers want.

127
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
	
For every small company that becomes a Fortune 500 firm, hundreds of com­
panies don’t grow at all or go out of business. When you try to guess the next 
great stock before there’s any evidence of growth, you’re not investing — 
you’re speculating. Have you heard that one before? (If not, flip to Chapter 2 
for details.) Of course you have, and you’ll hear it again. Don’t get us wrong — 
there’s nothing wrong with speculating. But it’s important to know that you’re 
speculating when you’re doing it. If you’re going to speculate in small stocks 
hoping for the next Research In Motion, then use the guidelines we present in 
the following sections to increase your chances of success.
Avoid IPOs, unless . . .
Chapter 1 describes how initial public offerings (IPOs) represent the birth­
place of public stocks, or the proverbial ground floor. Because a company’s 
going public is frequently an unproven enterprise, investing in an IPO can be 
risky. It’s even more risky when the company is small (revenues under $5 mil­
lion). The two types of IPOs we describe below exemplify this point:
Don’t rush to buy IPO stock
When a company goes public, it means that 
it undergoes an initial public offering (IPO). 
The IPO is the process by which a private firm 
seeks the assistance of an investment banking 
firm to gain financing by issuing stock that is 
purchased by the public. IPOs generate a lot of 
excitement, and many investors consider the 
IPO to be that proverbial ground-floor opportu­
nity. After all, some people find it appealing to 
get a stock before its price skyrockets — which 
it just may do when investors begin to flock to it.
Why wouldn’t people find IPOs appealing? 
IPOs actually have a very poor track record 
of success in their first year. A recent study 
revealed that 60 percent of the time IPOs actu­
ally declined in price during the first 12 months. 
In other words, an IPO has a better than even 
chance of dropping in price.
The reason why so many IPOs fail at the outset is 
because insiders, such as original owners and 
senior executives of the now-public company, 
rush to sell their own newfound shares after the 
so-called lock-up period expires. This lock-up 
time frame is a period of a few months where 
insiders are prohibited by law from selling their 
shares. But when they’re finally allowed to sell, 
the floodgates open and many executives sell 
many shares — usually at the same time. The 
downward pressure placed on their own stock, 
and possibly yours, is enormous.
The lesson for investors is that you’re better off 
waiting to see how the stock and the company 
perform, and you’re definitely better off waiting 
until a few months after the lock-up period has 
expired. Don’t worry about missing that great 
opportunity; if it’s a bona fide winner, you’ll still 
do well after the IPO.

128
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
✓	Startup IPO: This is a company that didn’t exist before the IPO. In other 
words, the entrepreneurs get together and create a business plan for 
an “idea.” To get the financing they need for the company, they decide 
to go public immediately by approaching an investment banker. If the 
investment banker thinks that it’s a good concept, the banker will seek 
funding (selling the stock to investors) via the IPO.
	
✓	A large existing private company that decides to go public: In many 
cases, the IPO is done for a company that already exists and is seeking 
expansion capital. The company may have been around for a long time 
as a smaller private concern, but it decides to seek funding through 
an IPO to grow even larger (or to fund a new product, promotional 
expenses, and so on).
Which of the two IPOs do you think is less risky? That’s right! The large pri­
vate company going public. Why? Because it’s already a proven business, 
which is a safer bet than a brand-new startup. Some great examples of suc­
cessful IPOs in recent years are the Canadian National Railway Company and 
Google (they were both established companies before they went public).
Great stocks started as small companies going public. You may be able to 
recount the stories of Research In Motion, Biovail, Dell, The Home Depot, and 
hundreds of other great successes. But do you remember an IPO by the com­
pany Lipschitz & Farquar? No? I didn’t think so. It’s among the majority of 
IPOs that don’t succeed. For investors, the lesson is clear: Wait until a track 
record appears before you invest in a company. If you don’t, you’re simply 
rolling the dice (in other words, you’re speculating, not investing!).
If it’s a small-cap stock, make 
sure it’s making money
We emphasize two points when investing in stocks:
	
✓	Make sure that a company is established. (Being in business for at least 
three years is a good minimum.)
	
✓	Make sure that a company is profitable.
These points are especially important for investors in small stocks. Plenty of 
startup ventures lose money but hope to make a fortune down the road. A 
good example is a company in the biotechnology industry. Biotech and green 
technologies are exciting but esoteric areas, and at this early stage compa­
nies are finding it difficult to use the technologies in profitable ways. You 
may say, “But shouldn’t I jump in now in anticipation of future profits?” You 
may get lucky, but understand that when you invest in unproven, small-cap 
stocks, you’re speculating.

129
 Chapter 8: Investing for Growth
Investing in small-cap stocks 
requires analysis
The only difference between a small-cap stock and a large-cap stock is a few 
zeros in their numbers and the fact that you need to do more research with 
small caps. Because of their size, small caps are riskier than large caps, so 
you offset the risk by accruing more information on yourself and the stock 
in question. Plenty of information is available on large-cap stocks because 
they’re widely followed. Small-cap stocks don’t get as much press, and fewer 
analysts issue reports on them. Here are a few points to keep in mind:
	
✓	Understand your investment style. Small-cap stocks may have more 
potential rewards, but they also carry more risk. No investor should 
devote a large portion of his capital to small-cap stocks. If you’re consid­
ering retirement money, you’re better off investing in large-cap stocks, 
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), investment-grade bonds, bank accounts, 
and mutual funds.
	
✓	Check with SEDAR or EDGAROnline. Get the financial reports for 
Canadian public companies through SEDAR (System for Electronic 
Document Analysis and Retrieval) at www.sedar.com. Get the financial 
reports that American-based companies must file with the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission (SEC), such as its 10Ks and 10Qs (see 
Chapter 6 for more details), through EDGAROnline at www.freeedgar.
com. Also, go to the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov to check its mas­
sive database of company filings at EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, 
Analysis, and Retrieval system).
	
✓	Check other sources. See whether brokers and independent research 
services, such as Value Line (www.valueline.com), follow the stock. If 
two or more different sources like the stock, it’s worth further investiga­
tion. Check the resources in Appendix B for further sources of informa­
tion before you invest.

Investing for Income
In This Chapter
▶	Defining income stocks
▶	Selecting income stocks with a few criteria in mind
▶	Looking at some typical income stocks
I
nvesting for income means investing in stocks that provide you with 
regular cash payments (dividends). Income stocks may not seem to offer 
stellar growth potential, but they’re good for a steady infusion of cash. If you 
have a low tolerance for risk, or if your investment goal is anything less than 
long term, income stocks are your best bet. In this chapter, we explain the 
basics of income stocks, show you how to analyze income stocks with a few 
handy formulas, and describe several typical income stocks.
	
Getting your stock portfolio to yield more income is easier than you think. 
Many investors increase income using proven techniques such as covered call 
writing. Covered call writing is beyond the scope of this book, but we encour­
age you to find out more about this technique and whether it applies to your 
situation. Talk to your financial adviser or read up on it — it’s covered more 
fully in Stock Options For Dummies by Alan R. Simon (Wiley).
Understanding the Basics 
of Income Stocks
We certainly think that dividend-paying stocks are a great consideration for 
those investors seeking greater income in their portfolios. We especially like 
stocks with higher-than-average dividends (typically 4 percent or greater) 
that are known as income stocks. Income stocks take on a dual role in that 
they can appreciate but also provide regular income. The following sections 
take a closer look at dividends and income stocks.

132
Part II: Before You Invest 
Getting a grip on dividends 
and dividend rates
When people talk about gaining income from stocks, they’re usually talk­
ing about dividends. A dividend is nothing more than money paid out to the 
owner of stock. You purchase dividend stocks primarily for income — not for 
spectacular growth potential.
A dividend is quoted as an annual number but is usually paid on a quarterly 
basis. For example, if a stock pays a dividend of $4, you’re probably paid $1 
every quarter. If, in this example, you have 200 shares, you’re paid $800 every 
year (if the dividend doesn’t change during that period), or $200 per quarter. 
Getting that regular dividend cheque every three months (for as long as you 
hold the stock) can be a nice perk.
	
A good income stock has a higher-than-average dividend (typically 4 percent 
or higher).
	
Dividend rates aren’t guaranteed — they can go up or down, or in some 
extreme cases the dividend can be discontinued. Fortunately, most companies 
that issue dividends continue them indefinitely and actually increase dividend 
payments from time to time. Historically, dividend increases have equalled (or 
exceeded) the rate of inflation.
Recognizing who’s well-suited 
for income stocks
What type of person is best suited to income stocks? Income stocks can be 
appropriate for many investors, but they’re especially well-suited for the fol­
lowing individuals:
	
✓	Conservative and novice investors: Conservative investors like to see a 
slow-but-steady approach to growing their money while getting regular 
dividend cheques. Novice investors who want to start slowly also ben­
efit from income stocks.
	
✓	Retirees: Growth investing (which we describe in Chapter 8) is best 
suited for long-term needs, while income investing is best suited to 
current needs. Retirees may want some growth in their portfolios, but 
they’re more concerned with regular income that can keep pace with 
inflation.

133
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
Checking out the advantages 
of income stocks
Income stocks tend to be among the least volatile of all stocks, and many 
investors view them as defensive stocks. Defensive stocks are stocks of com­
panies that sell goods and services that are generally needed no matter what 
shape the economy is in. (Don’t confuse defensive stocks with defence stocks, 
which specialize in goods and equipment for the military.) Food, beverage, 
and utility companies are great examples of defensive stocks. Even when the 
economy is experiencing tough times, people still need to eat, drink, and turn 
on the lights. Companies that offer relatively high dividends also tend to be 
large firms in established, stable industries.
	
Some industries in particular are known for high-dividend stocks. Utilities 
(such as electric, gas, and water), real estate, and the energy sector (oil and 
gas) are areas where you definitely find income stocks. In fact, Canadian stock 
markets represent a world-class selection of dividend-paying energy stocks. 
Yes, you can find high-dividend stocks in other industries, but you find a high 
concentration of them in these industries. For more details, see the sections 
highlighting these industries later in this chapter.
Watching out for the disadvantages 
of income stocks
Before you say, “Income stocks are great! I’ll get my chequebook and buy a 
batch right now,” take a look at some potential disadvantages (ugh!). Income 
stocks do come with some fine print.
What goes up . . .
Income stocks can go down as well as up, just as any stock can. Obviously, 
you don’t mind your income stock going up in value, but it can go down 
just as easily. The factors that affect stocks in general — politics (Chapter 
11), economic trends (Chapter 10), industry changes (Chapter 17), and so 
on — affect income stocks, too. Fortunately, income stocks don’t get hit as 
hard as other stocks when the market is declining because high dividends 
tend to act as a support to the stock price. Therefore, income stocks’ prices 
usually fall less dramatically than the prices of other stocks in a declining 
market.

134
Part II: Before You Invest 
Interest-rate sensitivity
Income stocks can be sensitive to rising interest rates. When interest rates 
in Canada and the U.S. go up, other investments (such as corporate bonds, 
Canadian and U.S. Treasury securities, and GICs) are more attractive. When 
your income stock is yielding 4 percent and interest rates are going to 5 per­
cent, 6 percent, or higher, you may think, “Hmm. Why settle for a 4-percent 
yield when I can get 5 percent or better elsewhere?” As more and more inves­
tors sell their low-yield stock, the prices for those stocks fall.
Another point to remember is that rising interest rates may hurt a company’s 
financial strength. If a company has to pay more interest, this may affect the 
company’s earnings, which in turn may affect the dividend.
	
Dividend-paying companies that are experiencing consistent, falling revenues 
tend to cut dividends. In this case, consistent means beyond just a year.
Inflation eats into dividends
Although many companies raise their dividends on a regular basis, some 
don’t. Or, if they do raise their dividends, the increases may be small. If 
income is your primary consideration, you want to be aware of this fact. If 
you’re getting the same dividend year after year and this income is impor­
tant to you, rising inflation becomes a problem. Say that you have XYZ stock 
at $10 per share with an annual dividend of 30 cents (the yield is 30 cents 
divided by $10, or 3 percent). If you have a yield of 3 percent two years in a 
row, how do you feel when inflation rises 6 percent one year and 7 percent 
the next year? Because inflation means that your costs are rising, inflation 
shrinks the value of the dividend income you receive.
As you can see, even conservative income investors can be confronted with 
different types of risk. (Chapters 4 and 16 cover the important topic of risk in 
much greater detail.) Fortunately, the rest of this chapter helps you carefully 
choose income stocks so that you can minimize these potential disadvantages.
Don’t forget the CRA
	
Another downside of income stocks is that the dividends from Canadian 
stocks are taxable as dividend income, subject to the gross-up adjustment and 
dividend tax credit. Dividends from foreign stocks are also taxable, but they 
don’t have the same favourable gross-up and dividend-tax-credit treatments as 
Canadian dividends do. Either way, this means you have to report dividends 
as income to Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
Dividend income is taxed at a higher level (especially for investors in the 
highest tax bracket) than the taxes attributable to capital gains, where only 
one-half of a capital gain is included in taxable income. For more information 
on the taxation of investment income, including capital gains, see Chapter 22.

135
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
Analyzing Income Stocks
Look at income stocks in the same way you do growth stocks when assess­
ing the financial strength of a company. Getting nice dividends comes to 
a screeching halt if the company can’t afford to pay them. If your budget 
depends on dividend income, then monitoring the company’s financial 
strength is that much more important. You can apply the same techniques 
for assessing the financial strength of growth stocks (see Chapter 8) to your 
assessment of income stocks.
Understanding your needs first
You choose income stocks primarily because you want or need income now. 
As a secondary point, income stocks have the potential for steady, long-term 
appreciation. So if you’re investing for retirement needs that won’t occur 
for another 20 years, maybe income stocks aren’t suitable for you — better 
to invest in growth stocks, because they’re more likely to grow your money 
faster over your stated lengthy investment term.
Playing it safe
If you’re an investor seeking income and you’re 
very nervous about potential risks with income 
stocks, here are some non-stock alternatives:
	✓	Treasury securities: Issued by the fed­
eral government, these are considered the 
safest investments in the world. Canadian 
Treasury securities are sold to the public in 
order to pay off maturing debt and to raise 
the cash needed to operate the govern­
ment. Three general types of treasury secu­
rities are sold in both Canada and the United 
States. Treasury bills (T-bills) mature in three 
months, six months, or one year. Treasury 
notes (Canada notes) are intermediate-
term securities and mature in 2–10 years. 
Treasury bonds (Canada bonds) are long-
term securities that have maturities ranging 
from 10–30 years. U.S. T-bills have much 
larger minimum purchase requirements 
than Canadian T-bills, which require mini­
mums from $5,000 (for terms of 6–12 months) 
up to $25,000 (for 30- to 60-day terms). A 
U.S.–denominated Canadian Treasury bill 
(guaranteed by the Canadian government) 
has a minimum requirement of US$100,000.
	✓	Bank certificates of deposit (CDs): These 
investments are backed up (to a limit of 
$100,000) by the Canada Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (CDIC) and are very safe.
	✓	Guaranteed investment certificates (GICs): 
Like CDs, GICs are safe and also guaranteed 
(again, up to a limit of $100,000) by the CDIC. 
They typically possess a shorter term and 
lower minimum investment amount than CDs.
	✓	Income mutual funds: Many mutual funds, 
such as Canadian Treasury–bond mutual 
funds and corporate bond funds, are 
designed for income investors. They offer 
diversification and professional manage­
ment, and you can usually invest minimal 
amounts.

Part II: Before You Invest 
If you’re certain that you want income stocks, do a rough calculation to figure 
out how big a portion of your portfolio you want income stocks to occupy. 
Suppose you need $25,000 in investment income to satisfy your current finan­
cial needs. If you have bonds that give you $20,000 in interest income and 
you want the rest to come from dividends from income stocks, you need to 
choose stocks that pay you $5,000 in annual dividends. If you have $80,000 
left to invest, you know that you need a portfolio of income stocks that pro­
vide $5,000 in dividend income, or a yield of 6.25 percent ($5,000 ÷ $80,000 = a 
yield of 6.25 percent).
Use the following table as a general guideline for understanding your need for 
income.
Item
Your Amounts
Sample Amounts
A. How much annual income 
do you need?
$10,000
B. What is the value of your 
portfolio (or money available 
for investment)?
$150,000
C. What is the yield neces­
sary to achieve this income 
(item A ÷ item B)?
6.7%
With this simple table, you know that if you have $150,000 in income stocks 
yielding 6.7 percent, you receive an income of $10,000 — meeting your stated 
financial need. You may ask, “Why not just buy $150,000 in bonds or other 
investments that yield at least 6.7 percent?” Well, if you’re satisfied with that 
$10,000 and inflation for the foreseeable future is zero, then you have a point. 
Unfortunately, inflation will probably be with us for a long time. Fortunately, 
the steady growth that income stocks provide is a benefit to you.
Minding your dividends and interest
Dividends are sometimes confused with inter­
est. However, dividends are payouts to owners, 
but interest is a payment to a creditor. You, as 
a stock investor, are considered to be a part 
owner of the company you invest in and are 
entitled to dividends when they’re issued. A 
Canadian chartered bank, on the other hand, 
considers you to be a creditor when you open 
an account. The bank borrows your money and 
then pays you interest on it.

137
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
	
Every investor is different. If you’re not sure about your current or future 
needs, your best choice is to consult with a financial planner.
Checking out yield
Because income stocks pay out dividends — income — you need to assess 
which stocks can give you the highest income. How do you decide which 
stocks will pay the most money? The main thing to look for in choosing 
income stocks is yield (the percentage rate of return paid on a stock in the 
form of dividends). Looking at a stock’s dividend yield is the quickest way to 
find out how much money you’ll earn from a particular income stock versus 
other dividend-paying stocks (or even other investments such as a bank 
account). Table 9-1 illustrates this point. Dividend yield is calculated in the 
following way:
Dividend yield = dividend income ÷ stock investment
The next two sections use the information in Table 9-1 to compare the yields 
from different investments and to see how evaluating yield can help you 
choose the stock that will earn you the most money.
	
Don’t stop scrutinizing stocks after you acquire them. You may have made a 
great choice that gives you a great dividend, but that doesn’t mean the stock 
stays that way indefinitely. Monitor the company’s progress for as long as 
it’s in your portfolio. Use resources such as www.money.canoe.ca, www.
bloomberg.com, and www.marketwatch.com (see Appendix B for more 
resources) to track your stock and to monitor how well that particular com­
pany continues to perform.
Examining yield
Most people have no problem understanding yield when it comes to bank 
accounts. If one of us tells you that our guaranteed investment certificate 
(GIC) from the Caisse d’Epargne credit union (see Table 9-1) has an annual 
yield of 4 percent, you can easily figure out what the profit will be in one 
year. If $1,000 is deposited in that GIC account, a year later it will have $1,040 
(slightly more if you include compounding). The GIC’s market value in this 
example is the same as the deposit amount — $1,000. That makes it easy to 
calculate.

How about stocks? When you see a stock listed in the financial pages, the 
dividend yield is provided along with the stock’s price and annual dividend. 
The dividend yield in the financial pages is always calculated as if you bought 
the stock on that given day. Just keep in mind that, based on supply and 
demand, stock prices change virtually every day (every minute!) that the 
market is open. Therefore, because the stock price changes every day, the 
yield changes as well. So, keep the following two things in mind when examin­
ing yield:
	
✓	The yield listed in the financial pages may not represent the yield 
you’re receiving. What if you bought stock in Smith Co. (see Table 9-1) a 
month ago at $20 per share? With an annual dividend of $1, you know that 
your yield is 5 percent. But what if today Smith Co. is selling for $40 per 
share? If you look in the financial pages, the yield quoted is 2.5 percent. 
Gasp! Did the dividend get cut in half? No, not really. You’re still getting 5 
percent because you bought the stock at $20 rather than the current $40 
price; the quoted yield is for investors who purchase Smith Co. today. 
Investors who buy Smith Co. stock today pay $40 and get the $1 dividend, 
and they’re locked into the current yield of 2.5 percent. Although Smith 
Co. may have been a good income investment for you a month ago, it’s 
not such a hot pick today because the price of the stock doubled — cut­
ting the yield in half. Even though the dividend hasn’t changed, the yield 
changed dramatically because of the stock’s price change.
	
✓	Stock price affects how good of an investment the stock may be. 
Another way to look at yield is by looking at the amount of investment. 
Using Smith Co. in Table 9-1 as an example, if you buy, say, 100 shares 
when they are $20 per share, you pay only $2,000 (100 shares × $20 — 
leave out commissions to make the example simple). If, instead, you 
purchase the same stock later at $40 per share, your total investment 

139
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
amount is $4,000 (100 shares × $40). In either case, you get a total divi­
dend income of $100 (100 shares × $1 dividend per share). From a yield 
perspective, which investment is yielding more — the $2,000 investment 
or the $4,000 investment? Of course, it’s better to get the income ($100 
in this case) with the smaller investment (a 5 percent yield is better than 
a 2.5 percent yield).
Comparing yield between different stocks
All things being equal, choosing Smith Co. or Jones Co. is a coin toss (see 
Table 9-1). It’s looking at your situation and each company’s fundamentals 
and prospects that will sway you. What if Smith Co. is an auto stock (similar 
to General Motors) and Jones Co. is a utility serving the Vancouver area? 
Now what? Recently, the automotive industry struggled, but utilities were 
generally in much better shape. In this scenario, Smith Co.’s dividend would 
be in jeopardy, but Jones Co.’s dividend would be more secure. Another 
issue would be the payout ratio (see later in this chapter). Therefore, having 
the same yield is not the same as the same risk. Different companies have dif­
ferent risks associated with them.
Checking the stock’s payout ratio
	
You can use the payout ratio to figure out what percentage of a company’s earn­
ings is being paid out in the form of dividends. Keep in mind that companies pay 
dividends from their net earnings. Therefore, a company’s earnings should always 
be higher than the dividends it pays out. Here’s how to figure a payout ratio:
Dividend (per share) ÷ earnings (per share) = payout ratio
Say that the company CashFlow Now Inc. (CFN) has annual earnings of $1 mil­
lion. (Remember that earnings are what you get when you subtract expenses 
from sales.) Total dividends are to be paid out of $500,000, and the company 
has 1 million outstanding shares. Using those numbers, you know that CFN 
has earnings per share (EPS) of $1 ($1 million in earnings ÷ 1 million shares) 
and that it pays an annual dividend of 50 cents per share ($500,000 ÷ 1 mil­
lion shares). The dividend payout ratio is 50 percent (the 50-cent dividend 
= 50 percent of the $1 EPS). This number is a healthy dividend payout ratio 
because even if the company’s earnings fall by 10 percent, or 20 percent, it 
still has plenty of room to pay dividends. People concerned about the safety of 
their dividend income should regularly watch the payout ratio. The maximum 
acceptable payout ratio should be 80 percent, and a good range is 50–70 per­
cent. A payout ratio of 60 percent or lower is considered to be very safe.
	
When a company suffers significant financial difficulties, its ability to pay divi­
dends is compromised. So if you need dividend income to help you pay your 
bills, you better be aware of the dividend payout ratio. Generally, a dividend 
payout ratio of 60 percent or less is safe. Obviously, the lower the percentage 
is, the safer the dividend.

140
Part II: Before You Invest 
Diversifying your stocks
If most of your dividend income comes from stock in a single company or from 
a single industry, consider reallocating your investment to avoid having all 
your eggs in one basket. Concerns for diversification apply to income stocks as 
well as growth stocks. If all your income stocks are in the electric utility indus­
try, then any problems in the electric utility industry are potential problems 
for your portfolio, as well. See Chapter 4 for more on diversification.
Examining the company’s bond rating
	
Bond rating? Huh? What’s that got to do with dividend-paying stocks? Well, cor­
porate bonds are like government bonds, except that they come with slightly 
better yields than government bonds. BCE, Air Canada, and EnCana Corporation 
are examples of Canadian issuers of corporate bonds. Corporate bonds must 
provide better yields because they are riskier than the government variety. 
Companies may go out of business; governments generally do not. The services 
of bond rating agencies are needed to help assess this credit risk.
Bond rating agencies, such as the Dominion Bond Rating Service (dbrs.
com), and Standard & Poor’s (www2.standardandpoors.com), which 
includes the former Canada Bond Rating Service, are there to help. Both have 
similar rating schemes. Ratings of AAA, AA, and A are considered to be invest­
ment grade, or of high quality. B and C ratings indicate poor, speculative, 
or default grades. Anything lower than that is considered to be very risky 
(these bonds are referred to as junk bonds). Both assess, among other things, 
whether a company will have enough money to pay its interest obligations as 
well as the full principal amounts at maturity.
A company’s bond rating is very important to income-stock investors. The 
bond rating offers insight into the company’s financial strength. To fully 
understand why this is important, consider the following ratings:
	
✓	Good bond rating: If the bond rating is good, this means that the company 
is strong enough to pay its obligations. These obligations include expenses, 
payments on debts, and dividends that are declared. If a bond rating agency 
gives the company a high rating (or if it raises the rating), that’s a great sign 
for anyone holding the company’s debt or receiving dividends.
	
✓	Lowered bond rating: If a bond rating agency lowers the rating of a 
bond, that means the company’s financial strength is deteriorating — a 
red flag for anyone who owns the company’s bonds or stock. A lower 
bond rating today may mean trouble for the dividend later on.

141
 Chapter 9: Investing for Income
	
✓	Bad bond rating: If the bond rating isn’t good, that means the company 
is having difficulty paying its obligations. If the company can’t pay all its 
obligations, then it has to choose which ones to pay. More times than 
not, a financially troubled company chooses to cut dividends or (in a 
worst-case scenario) not pay dividends at all.
	
Just because a bond rating company issues a rating does not mean the rating 
is accurate. It is strictly an estimate. Look no further than all those U.S. banks 
that went under in 2009. Very few had a rating worse than BB! Right.
Exploring Some Typical Income Stocks
Although virtually every industry has stocks that pay dividends, some indus­
tries have more dividend-paying stocks than others. You won’t find too 
many dividend-paying income stocks in the computer or biotech industry! 
The reason is that these types of companies need a lot of money to finance 
expensive research and development (R&D) projects to create new products. 
Without R&D, the company can’t create new products to fuel sales, growth, 
and future earnings. Computer technology, biotech, and other innovative 
industries are better for growth investors.
Utilities
Utilities generate a large cash flow. (If you don’t believe us, look at your gas 
and electric bills!) Cash flow includes money from income (sales of products 
and/or services) and other items (the selling of assets, for example). This cash 
flow is needed to cover things such as expenses, loan payments, and divi­
dends. Utilities are considered to be the most common type of income stocks, 
and many investors have at least one in their portfolios. Investing in your own 
local utility isn’t a bad idea. At least it makes paying the utility bill less painful.
	
Before you invest in a public utility, consider the following:
	
✓	The utility company’s financial condition: Is the company making 
money, and are its sales and earnings growing from year to year? Make 
sure the utility’s bonds are rated highly. We cover bond ratings in the 
“Examining the company’s bond rating” section in this chapter.
	
✓	The company’s dividend payout ratio: Because utilities tend to have a 
good cash flow, don’t be too concerned if the ratio reaches 70 percent. 
Again, — from a safety point of view — the lower the rate, the better. 
See the “Checking the stock’s payout ratio” section in this chapter.
	
✓	The company’s geographic location: If the utility covers an area that’s 
doing well and offers an increasing population base and business expan­
sion, that bodes well for your stock.

142
Part II: Before You Invest 
Real estate stocks and investment trusts
Real estate stocks are generally income-producing in nature because they 
have fairly stable and predictable cash flows. For example, Brookfield Asset 
Management and Brascan are two Canadian real estate companies that regu­
larly declare dividends on their shares. In fact, Brascan has assets in both the 
real estate and power generation sectors.
Real estate investment trusts (REITs), on the other hand, make up a special 
breed of real estate “stock.” A REIT is an investment that has the elements 
of both a stock and a mutual fund (a pool of money received from investors 
that’s managed by an investment company). It’s like a stock in that it’s a 
company whose stock is publicly traded on the major stock exchanges. It has 
the usual features that you expect from a stock — it can be bought and sold 
easily through a broker, some income is passed on to investors, and so on.
A REIT resembles a mutual fund in that it doesn’t make its money selling 
goods and services. And like a mutual fund, it makes money by buying, sell­
ing, and managing an investment portfolio — in the case of a REIT, the port­
folio is full of real estate investments. It generates revenue from rents and 
property leases as any landlord does. In addition, some REITs own mortgages 
and gain income from the interest.
Royalty (energy) trusts
In recent years, the oil and gas sector has generated much interest as people 
and businesses experience much higher energy prices. Due to a variety 
of bullish factors — such as increased international demand from China 
and other rapidly growing industrialized nations — oil and gas prices have 
zoomed to record highs. Some income investors have capitalized on this 
price increase by investing in energy stocks called resource (royalty) trusts.
Resource trusts are companies that hold assets such as oil-rich and/or gas-rich 
land and generate high fees from companies that seek access to these prop­
erties for exploration. The fees paid to the resource trusts are then disbursed 
as high dividends to their shareholders. By the second half of 2008, dividend-
rich resource trusts sported yields in the 7–10 percent range. This range, if it 
can be sustained, is very enticing, given how low yields have been during the 
recent stock market and economic decline. You can research resource trusts 
in generally the same venues as regular stocks (see Appendix B).

Getting a Grip on Economics
In This Chapter
▶	Distinguishing between microeconomics and macroeconomics
▶	Boning up on key economic concepts
▶	Exploring the major schools of economic thought
▶	Keeping an eye on a couple of current economic issues
“S
tock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high pla­
teau,” said the celebrated economist Irving Fisher on October 17, 
1929, shortly before history’s most famous single-day stock market plunge. 
Nobody should have listened to Irving Fisher — not even Irving Fisher. He 
lost a tonne of money in the stock market and filed for bankruptcy at the 
start of the Great Depression. Sooooo . . . if you don’t think understanding 
economics is important to your stock investing strategy, then by gum you’d 
be as wrong as Irving.
This chapter isn’t full of economic gobbledygook; we won’t beat you over 
the head with phrases like “inelastic demand aggregates” and “marginal 
statistical utility” (whatever that means). (You’re breathing a sigh of relief, 
aren’t you?) Presented properly, economics really is quite interesting. 
Understanding economics helps you make better decisions involving your 
investment choices. All of our successful stock picks were first grounded in 
commonsense, big-picture economics. Economics has also helped us avoid 
bad choices — Internet stocks in the late 1990s and mortgage and financial 
stocks during 2006–08 didn’t make economic sense, and ultimately share­
holders lost most (or all) of their money as stock prices sank into oblivion. 
Always ask yourself: “Does this stock pick make economic sense?” We find 
economics really fascinating, and we hope you find this chapter beneficial 
and, uh, tolerable.

Breaking Down Microeconomics 
versus Macroeconomics
You can divide the field of economics into two categories: microeconomics 
and macroeconomics. For stock investors,
	
✓	Microeconomics is looking at the economic small picture, such as the 
fundamentals of a company.
	
✓	Macroeconomics is looking at the economic big picture, such as the 
health of the general economy — in Canada, the U.S., and the whole 
world.
Microeconomics
It may not always dawn on you that economics isn’t about alien, arcane data 
and statistics. Economics is the rudimentary stuff of financial life such as 
sales, expenses, profit, debt, and so on. Your own household is the first and 
best example of microeconomics in action. If the money coming in is greater 
than the money going out, that’s certainly good. If you have lots of debt (lia­
bilities) and very little in the way of things you own (assets), then your net 
worth is negative (dead meat!) and the microeconomics of your household 
aren’t good at all.
	
Much of this book covers microeconomics in terms of choosing your stock. 
After all, if you’re going to put your hard-earned money in a stock, you have 
to familiarize yourself with the company represented by that stock. Is the 
company in good economic shape? You find out by checking the company’s 
microeconomic indicators, such as its income statement (or the P&L), balance 
sheet, and cash flow. You find more information about these indicators in 
Chapter 12.

145
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
Macroeconomics
If you’re only familiar with the microeconomic and don’t notice the big pic­
ture, you could see your portfolio crumble. Macroeconomics is an important 
part of your investment decision-making process because stocks aren’t 
chosen in a vacuum. Even the best stocks in the world will go down if the 
economy is experiencing major problems. This is especially true for stocks of 
companies that offer products and services.
One of the most helpful macroeconomic indicators is the index of Leading 
Economic Indicators (LEI), which is an economic gauge that covers a broad 
array of statistics intended to estimate future economic activity in the U.S. 
It’s calculated by the Conference Board (www.conference-board.org), 
and it’s a useful gauge for all Canadian investors because it evaluates how the 
U.S. economy is progressing. As the U.S. economy goes so goes the Canadian 
economy, because we are very dependent on our free trade with the U.S. for 
our own economic prosperity.
	
A flaw with the analysis of the investing pundits on financial TV shows is that 
although they’re usually very good at microeconomics, because of certain 
factors (a lack of education, bias, and so on), they aren’t proficient in mac­
roeconomics. They may tell you about a great stock in sector X, but they’re 
missing what will hit that sector (and that stock) because of factors elsewhere 
in the economy. A good example is homebuilding stocks. In 2007, we noticed 
that a financial adviser extolled the virtues of a particular homebuilding com­
pany (“Great financials, great profit margin — this stock is a definite buy!”). 
However, the housing sector was about to be slammed by a huge wave of 
defaults and foreclosures because of mortgage problems and a slowing gen­
eral economy. In the following months, that stock plummeted by 60 percent 
even though its microeconomic picture looked nice.
Understanding Important Concepts 
in Economic Logic
In the following sections we discuss a few points you ought to be familiar 
with to keep yourself grounded with the right data and logic for your stock 
investing decisions.

146
Part II: Before You Invest 
Supply and demand
Doing a chapter on economics without mentioning supply and demand is 
like doing a chapter on graceful aging without mentioning Tommy Hunter 
and Gordon Lightfoot. Supply and demand are the quintessential duo in the 
economic universe, and the more you understand how they work, the more 
successful your investment decisions will be.
	
Here are definitions for these two concepts (from our perspectives, of course):
	
✓	Supply. What’s being offered or produced? How much is there? How 
desirable or necessary is it? Are there substitutes? How limited or plenti­
ful is the supply in question? What factors affect supply, and do those 
factors affect it directly or indirectly?
	
✓	Demand. This refers to the market that will ultimately buy what’s 
offered. Who are they? How many are they? Are they willing and able to 
buy? Are they individuals, small organizations, or large organizations? 
Do they merely want what’s offered, or do they need it? What factors 
affect demand, and do those factors affect it directly or indirectly?
We count on supply and demand to tell us how well a product or service will 
sell. This in turn tells us whether the company providing the supply (again, 
product or service) has enough customers (demand) to be profitable and 
successful.
How do supply and demand relate to your investing decisions? Here’s a 
simple example: A company sells medical equipment that’s necessary for an 
aging population, and the aging population is a growing segment of Canadian 
society. Therefore, demand is strong and probably growing, so the stock of 
the company providing supply (the medical equipment) is probably a good 
bet. Another example is a company that produces fertilizer to allow for more 
efficient crop production at a time when world population is increasing, and 
land available for farming is becoming more scarce. The stock of a company 
like Potash or a competitor may be well-positioned to meet this demand in a 
profitable way.
	
Sometimes the laws of supply and demand can be overcome or temporarily 
suspended in the short term by something powerful such as Canadian govern­
ment action (a good example is price controls, which we cover in Chapter 11). 
However, in the long term, supply and demand trump all.
Wants and needs
One of our favourite definitions of economics is a very pithy one: “Economics 
is humanity dealing with scarcity.” After all, to “economize” is to use 
resources wisely and to make choices about what to do with time, effort, and 

147
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
money. As humans, we know that resources (such as time, effort, and money) 
have to be used to voluntarily exchange with others to acquire goods and 
services that meet personal wants and needs (or both).
When times are good and we’re doing well financially we’re not that con­
cerned about our needs, and we have a greater ability to address our wants, 
such as a new car or a better vacation. When times are good, we have an 
easier time with stock investing; many stocks tend to do well when times are 
good because more money flows toward both wants and needs.
But what if times are bad (or simply not as good)? When economic times 
are tough or uncertain, common sense kicks in for stock investors. Demand 
for products and services that people merely want but don’t need is weak 
or negative. However, demand for those things that are needed in our lives 
(such as food or energy) makes them a safer choice for stock investors. In a 
bad economy, Canadian stock investors have to be even more selective.
	
As we write this, times remain very difficult, and the data tell us that 2010 and 
2011 will still be economically hazardous and difficult for the Canadian, U.S., 
and world economies as a whole. Therefore, Canadian investors would be pru­
dent to stick to investment choices tied to human needs.
Dynamic analysis versus static analysis
Economics isn’t about dry statistics; it’s about human behaviour with incen­
tives and disincentives. In other words, when it comes to economics, people 
behave in a way that usually suits their self-interest. For example, say you’re 
driving down the highway and you notice two gas stations. Gas station A 
has gasoline at $1.10 per litre while gas station B has the same gas at $1.05. 
Which one is more profitable? All things being equal, gas station B (the one 
with the lower price) will make more money.
Dynamic analysis takes human behaviour into account, such as in our gaso­
line example. However, someone using static analysis would conclude that 
gas station A would be more profitable by assuming it would make an extra 
5 cents per litre. If the world were a static place and if people were automa­
tons, then the latter situation could possibly prove correct. But look . . . we’re 
human! Everyone loves a bargain. Gas A is more expensive, so more people 
will buy gas B, resulting in higher profits for the lower-priced station.
Dynamic analysis takes into account how people or organizations act differ­
ently given incentives (such as discounts) or disincentives (such as sales 
taxes), while static analysis doesn’t.

148
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
We’re all faced with choices about what to do with our money. We’re certain 
that you’d find the same product cheaper at a big box store than at a haughty 
boutique in downtown Montreal. Yet which one would make greater overall 
profits? Ask yourself how people would behave with the choices they face in 
the marketplace. Those companies that deliver with greater efficiency and 
value are a good bet for stock investing.
Cause and effect
Cause and effect is an exercise in logic that stock investors should embrace. If 
something is a growing problem (or a growing opportunity), what is its possible 
cause? And, in turn, what effect will it have? The credit crisis of 2008 and 2009 
is a great example of this. When U.S. banks were overburdened with debt and 
much of that debt was discovered to be low-quality (risky) debt, this situation 
caused several effects, among them major losses and potential bankruptcies. 
Wary investors see that too much debt in an uncertain economy can certainly 
cause some undesired effects. Individual companies suffer and their stock price 
goes down, which, of course, has a negative effect on your portfolio.
Surveying a Few Schools 
of Economic Thought
Adhering to a particular economic philosophy can make you or break you 
as a stock investor. Be sure to discover which ones have withstood the test 
of time and which ones are the kiss of economic death. In the following sec­
tions, we introduce a few major schools of thought found in the world today.
	
Be sure to find which schools apply to the financial planners you work with 
and the resources you use — knowing a planner’s school of thought can help 
you decide whether his general outlook is a fit with yours. If a financial plan­
ner isn’t aware of the schools of thought — or answers “Keynesian” — it might 
indicate he doesn’t fully understand how government policy and economics 
affect the stock-picking process.
The Marx school
Frankly, the Marx school of economic thought (named after Karl Marx) makes 
us shudder. That’s because in a communist country, the government runs 
everything. When the government runs everything, economic activity is con­
trolled by a centralized, pervasive bureaucracy. And history has shown that 
such economies eventually collapse. Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union are 
examples; Cuba may be next to follow.

149
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
Part of the reason why centralized planning doesn’t work is that no single 
bureaucrat or committee of bureaucrats has the ability to see and meet the 
complex and constantly changing wants and needs of millions of diverse indi­
viduals. Centralized planning of an economy eventually leads to misallocation 
of resources, and that has always led to intractable economic problems.
	
How does this relate to stocks? Marxist/socialist/communist economic 
thought is, at its core, antithetical to a healthy free market economy, which 
is necessary for stock investing. Stock investing requires a free market, one 
in which the functions of business (such as profit) can operate with minimal 
interference. Businesses must be allowed to be formed, and they must bear 
the burden of risk and reward. Poorly run businesses fail, while well-run com­
panies are rewarded with profit (good for shareholders).
Although profit sometimes gets bad press, it is in fact the most necessary 
element of a successful economy. In other chapters of this book, you find out 
that profit is necessary for companies, but notice that we’ve extended that 
thought to the overall economy. Think about it for a moment. Profit is vital 
for economic growth. Profit is what makes an economy expand. Profit is an 
economic incentive missing from communist economies (and sorely missing 
from socialist ones). Profit is (and should be) a reward for innovation, risk, 
and the proper allocation of resources.
History has shown us conclusively that every country that has adopted a 
totalitarian, command-and-control economic model (communism, fascism, 
and so on) has ended in economic decline and abject failure. The bottom line 
is that Groucho Marx knows more about economics than Karl. Nuff said.
The Keynes school
The economic philosophy of John Maynard Keynes (a British economist in 
the early 20th century) has been the dominant school of thought in Canadian 
and American politics and governmental economic policy matters for over a 
half-century. What a shame! What many don’t realize is that, after decades of 
this policy being implemented, the long-term effect of Keynesian economics 
is now becoming evident.
Keynesian economics is an economic theory with the central idea that active 
government intervention in the marketplace and in monetary policy (manag­
ing the country’s currency) is the best method of ensuring economic growth 
and stability. Believers in Keynesian economics think that it’s the govern­
ment’s job to smooth out the ebbs and flows in the business cycle. In bad 
times, like now, intervention takes the form of increased spending by the 
government and tax cuts to stimulate the economy. In good times, the gov­
ernment intervenes by a reduction in spending and increases in taxes to curb 
potential inflation.

150
Part II: Before You Invest 
The problem is that the government intervention at the heart of Keynesian 
economics is now finally seen as the great flaw. The intervention actually 
causes the recessions, depressions, and artificial booms that it was origi­
nally supposed to remedy. The low-interest-rate policy that fuelled the 
recent housing boom in Canada and the U.S. comes to mind. Mindless lend­
ing practices in the U.S. also caused many American banks to collapse. As 
government continues to spend and allows total government debt to keep 
rising, the situation must eventually be addressed. When flaws in his theory 
were pointed out and shown to be a huge problem in the long run, Keynes 
was famously quoted as saying, “In the long run, we will all be dead.” Well, 
he certainly is dead, but his ideas live on and continue to wreak havoc on 
our Canadian economy today. Government intervention, massive bailouts, 
economic dislocation, and rising inflation are being dealt with right now. 
(Another quote attributed to Keynes was, “It is better to be roughly right 
than precisely wrong.” Looks like he has been precisely wrong, and it sure 
has been rough!)
	
What does Keynesian economics have to do with the stock market? This is 
the ideology that ends up causing artificial booms (“asset bubbles”) and the 
resulting decline. Keynesian thinking is what drove the government (through 
the Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada) to increase liquidity (that is, 
increase the money supply and expand credit), which resulted in the bubbles 
that our society has witnessed in recent years. In the early stages of a bubble, 
everyone’s happy as the value of their assets (such as stocks or real estate) 
rises and provides the illusion that has come to be known as “the wealth 
effect.” Canadians felt wealthy in the late 1990s and mid-2000s when the stock 
market (especially tech, oil, and commodity stocks) went up dramatically. 
However, because bubbles are created by artificial means (the injection of 
credit), prices are bid up to unnatural levels and must ultimately come down. 
The stock market bubble popped in 2000 and again in early 2009, and millions 
of people lost trillions of dollars. As we write this, the latest bubble in credit 
and derivatives continues to deflate and wreak havoc on the stock market 
(especially financial stocks like banks and brokerage firms). Bubbles have 
become the visible legacy of the rampant credit and money expansion that 
resulted from applying Keynesian economics. (By the way, most politicians 
are Keynesians. Ha! Need we say more?)
The Austrian school
Another school of economic thought for investors (anyone, actually) is the 
Austrian school. After 100 years of experience, the Austrian school has been 
proven consistently right.
The leading voice of this school was Ludwig von Mises, an Austrian econo­
mist in the early 20th century (now you know where the name of the school 
comes from!). He accurately forecast the Great Depression, the collapse of 
the Soviet Union, and other major economic events.

151
 Chapter 10: Getting a Grip on Economics
The Austrian school emphasizes free markets, limited government, private 
property rights, and a sound currency tied to the gold standard. This last 
point is important given what can happen when a government issues cur­
rency without limit — how this leads to currency debasement and, ulti­
mately, collapse. In addition, the Austrian school provides research on how 
asset bubbles (such as the recent stock and housing market bubbles) form 
and the problems that can ensue when these bubbles cause booms and the 
inevitable bust.
How does this help you with stocks? About ten years ago, we recall reading 
an article about asset bubbles on www.mises.org, the site that showcases 
the work of Mises and other Austrian economists (such as Murray Rothbard 
and Henry Hazlitt). That article explained how the stock market was a bubble 
and why. Armed with this knowledge, we informed readers and clients about 
ways to protect against the stock market bubble. That forewarning saved 
many of our readers and clients from the bear market of 2000–02, and it was a 
concrete lesson in understanding (and applying) sound economic principles.

Understanding Some Current Economic 
Issues Facing Stock Investors
As we told you earlier in this chapter, we won’t provide an all-encompassing, 
extensive, voluminous coverage of economics, but we are committed to your 
investment success. The following are a few economic issues that you must 
be aware of in the coming months and years if you’re intent on successful 
stock investing.
Inflation
Inflation is an issue that could easily be lumped into the chapter on politics 
(Chapter 11, so you know) because it’s as much a governmental phenomenon 
as it is an economic one. In modern economies, we use currencies (such as the 
dollar) to transact in our day-to-day lives. It’s our medium of exchange; we use 
currencies to trade with so that we can obtain goods and services. The issu­
ance of currency is a government matter; the central bank (in Canada it’s the 
Bank of Canada; in the U.S. it’s the Federal Reserve) issues the currency and 
manages its quantity (the money supply). When you hear the term “monetary 
policy,” that’s just the official way of saying that the Bank of Canada manages 
our official supply of money — the loonie as our national currency.
Since 2001, the Federal Reserve (and to a lesser extent the Bank of Canada) 
has been increasing the money supply at a very high rate. In recent years, 
much of this came in the form of credit that went into assets (such as stocks 

152
Part II: Before You Invest 
and real estate), but much of it has been (and is) going into the price of 
goods and services. This means that the result has been (and will be) high 
and higher prices.
	
Inflation is effectively a hidden tax that hurts most consumers, especially 
those on fixed incomes with limited means. Canadian stock investors should 
be aware of inflation and invest in ways that will benefit them. This is part 
of the reason why we repeatedly tell folks to invest in human need. As these 
prices go up, you need to be in the stocks of companies that will either benefit 
from inflation or (at the very least) not be hurt by it. Examples of human need 
include food, water, energy, commodities, and so on. Consider stocks in these 
necessary areas.
Government intervention
Stock investing was actually an easy pursuit in the 1980s and the early 1990s. 
The market was generally unfettered, and economic logic was easy to apply. 
However, a major sea change has occurred during the past 10 to 15 years 
that has made stock investing more precarious, unpredictable, and hazard­
ous. That sea change was driven by pronounced government intervention, 
which is akin to betting on a basketball game but finding out that the referees 
are interfering in the game. Government intervention comes in a variety of 
flavours, and it’s usually an outgrowth of political considerations — so spend 
some time in Chapter 11, where we discuss the relationship between politics 
and stock investing in more detail.
9,000,000 percent inflation!
In a recent seminar, we asked students to name 
the top-performing stock market in the world 
from the previous year (from a nominal point of 
view). They blurted out “China,” “Brazil,” and 
other guesses, but they weren’t even close. 
“Zimbabwe,” we said to the puzzled class. 
That’s right, a fairly obscure country in central 
Africa. Its stock market was up an astonishing 
12,000 percent. Whew! Yet, the country is mired 
in poverty under an oppressive regime. How can 
that be? When socialist dictator Robert Mugabe 
took control of the country, he put in strict con­
trols on the economy. Among those controls: 
Citizens couldn’t have foreign accounts, couldn’t 
buy gold or other alternative forms of money, 
and could only use the official currency, the 
Zimbabwean dollar. He then began to hyper­
inflate the currency to initially benefit himself 
and his allies. After years of abuse, the inflation 
rate hit horrific levels. On paper, Zimbabwe 
had more multimillionaires per capita than any 
other nation even though most of the popu­
lace was destitute. By the summer of 2008, the 
inflation rate surpassed 9 million percent, as 40 
billion Zimbabwean dollars equalled one U.S. 
dollar. Recently, the country’s economic min­
ister told the United Nations that the inflation 
rate was beyond calculation. Zimbabwe’s fate 
regarding this extreme condition is yet to be 
clear. Stay tuned!

▶	Looking at the effects of politics and government on stocks
▶	Checking out a few handy political resources
P
olitics can be infuriating, disruptive, meddlesome, corrupting, and 
harmful. Don’t let that fool you — it does have its bad side, too! Even if 
politics doesn’t amuse or interest you, you can’t ignore it. If you aren’t care­
ful, it can wreak havoc on your portfolio. Politics wields great influence on 
the economic and social environment, which affects how companies succeed 
or fail. This success or failure in turn either helps or hurts your stock’s price. 
After all, a stock is merely a reflection of what the underlying company has 
to deal with — including the positive or negative impact of political decisions 
made. Politics (manifested in taxes, regulations, price controls, capital con­
trols, and other government actions) can make or break a company or indus­
try quicker than any other external force.
	
What Canadians (especially government policy makers) must understand is 
that a new tax, law, regulation, or government action has a macro effect on a 
stock, an industry, or even an entire economic system, whereas a company 
has a micro effect on an economy. The following gives you a simple snapshot 
of these effects:
Politics → policy → economy → industry → company → stock → stock 
investor
Now, this chapter doesn’t moralize about politics or advocate a political 
point of view; after all, this book is about stock investing. In general, poli­
cies can be good or bad regardless of their effect on the economy — some 
policies are enacted to achieve greater purposes even if they kick you in the 
wallet. However, in the context of this chapter, politics is covered from a 
cause-and-effect perspective: How does politics affect prosperity in general 
and stock investing in particular?

154
Part II: Before You Invest 
	
A proficient stock investor can’t — must not — look at stocks as though they 
exist in a vacuum. Our favourite example of this rule is the idea of fish in a Great 
Lake. You can have a great fish (your stock) among a whole school of fish (the 
stock market) in a wonderful lake (the economy). But what if the lake gets pol­
luted (bad policy)? What happens to the fish? Politics controls the lake and can 
make it hospitable — or dangerous — for the participants. You get the point. 
The example may sound too simple, yet it isn’t. So many people — political 
committees, corporate managers, bureaucrats, and politicians — still get this 
picture so wrong time and time again, to the detriment of the economy and 
stock investors. Heck, we don’t mind if they get it wrong with their money, but 
their actions make it tough for your money.
Although the two inexorably get intertwined, we do what we can to treat poli­
tics and economics as separate issues. Economics gets its own spotlight in 
Chapter 10.
Tying Together Politics and Stocks
The campaigns heat up. Liberals, Conservatives, and smaller parties vie for 
your attention and subsequent votes. All sorts of political viewpoints enter 
into the battlefield of ideas. But after all is said and done, Canadian voters 
make their decisions. Election Day brings a new slate of politicians into office, 
and they in turn joust and debate on new rules and programs in the legisla­
tive halls of Parliament. Before and after election time, Canadian investors 
must keep a watchful eye on the proceedings. In the following sections, we 
explain some basic political concepts that relate to stock investing.
	
Our discussion in this chapter is not restricted to Canadian politics. In fact, in 
this highly interconnected world economy, it is not even restricted to North 
American politics. As long as a company operates in another country, it will be 
affected by the politics of that country. Ultimately, the effect of this intercon­
nectedness trickles down to the company, stock, and individual stock investor 
level!
Seeing the general effects of politics 
on stock investing
For stock investors, politics manifests itself as a major factor in investment-
making decisions in ways shown in Table 11-1.

Politics and Investing
Possible Legislation
Effect on Investing
Taxes
Will a new tax affect a particular stock (indus­
try or economy)? Generally, more or higher 
taxes ultimately have a negative impact on 
stock investing. Income taxes and capital gains 
taxes are good examples.
Laws
Will Parliament (or, in some instances, provincial 
legislatures) pass a law that will have a negative 
impact on a stock, the industry, or the economy? 
Price controls — laws that set the price of a 
product, service, or commodity — are examples 
of negative laws.
Regulations
Will a new (or existing) regulation have a nega­
tive (or positive) effect on the stock of your 
choice? Generally, more or tougher regulations 
have a negative impact on stocks.
Government spending and debt
If government agencies spend too much or misal­
locate resources, they may create greater bur­
dens on society, which in turn will be bearish for 
the economy and the stock market.
Money supply
The money supply — the dollars you use — is 
controlled by the Bank of Canada. How can 
money supply affect stocks? Big time! Increasing 
or decreasing the money supply results in either 
an inflationary or a deflationary environment, 
which can help or hurt the economy, specific 
industries, and stock picks.
Interest rates
The Bank of Canada (and the Federal Reserve in 
the U.S.) has crucial influence here. It can raise 
or lower key interest rates that in turn can have 
an effect on the entire economy and the stock 
market. When interest rates go up, it makes 
credit more expensive for companies. When 
interest rates go down, companies can get 
cheaper credit, which can be better for profits 
— if that debt is used carefully.

Effect on Investing
Government bailouts
This occurs when the government inter­
venes directly and uses either tax money, 
borrowed money, or printed money to bail 
out a troubled enterprise. This is a negative 
to the overall economy because funds are 
diverted by force from the healthier private 
economy to an ailing enterprise.

The Canadian government’s bailout of 
General Motors in Oshawa is a recent 
example of a very high-cost handout. The 
U.S. government’s bailout of Chrysler, AIG, 
and a plethora of financial institutions are 
but some examples of scores of bailouts 
that have occurred south of our border. No 
one is even sure whether these interven­
tions will work in the long run.
	
When many of the factors in Table 11-1 work in tandem, they can have a mag­
nified effect that can have tremendous consequences for your stock portfolio. 
Alert investors keep a constant vigil when the legislature is open for business, 
and they adjust their portfolios accordingly.
Ascertaining the political climate
	
The bottom line is that you ignore political realities at your own (economic) 
risk. To be and stay aware, ask yourself the following questions about the 
stock of each company in which you invest:
	
✓	What laws will directly affect my stock investment adversely?
	
✓	Will any laws affect the company’s industry?
	
✓	Will any current or prospective laws affect the company’s sources of 
revenue?
	
✓	Will any current or prospective laws affect the company’s expenses or 
supplies?
	
✓	Am I staying informed about political and economic issues that may pos­
sibly have a negative impact on my investment?
	
✓	Will such things as excessive regulations, price controls, or new taxes 
have a negative impact on my stock’s industry?

 Chapter 11: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
Here’s an example: Canadian oil and gas service and exploration compa­
nies benefited from the global need for more energy supplies. But invest­
ment opportunities didn’t stop there. As oil and gas supplies became costly 
and problematic, alternative energy sources gained national attention. 
Specifically, the debate was rekindled on wind power, solar power, and other 
exciting new technologies, such as fuel cells. As traditional sources of energy 
(crude oil) became more expensive, alternative sources of energy became 
more economically viable. Canadian investors who anticipated the new inter­
est in alternative energy sought companies to invest in that would logically 
benefit. With winds of change at their back due to public acceptance of inno­
vative energy technologies, Canadian investors can take renewed notice of 
alternative energy options
The seeds of financial disaster sown 
in the last decade
As we write this book, the financial headlines 
blare away about the trillion-dollar financial 
and credit catastrophes unfolding on Wall 
Street. Colossal U.S. government-sponsored 
enterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac have collapsed, and shareholders have 
been wiped out. Large financial entities such 
as AIG and Merrill Lynch have been rocked by 
multibillion-dollar losses. Although Canada’s 
banks are more secure, we have our share 
of problems in other areas, as evidenced by 
GM’s trials in Oshawa and the mothballing of 
expensive oil sands projects in Alberta. When 
the U.S. sneezes, the rest of the world, includ­
ing Canada, is affected. Politicians and pundits 
give indignant speeches about the failures of 
capitalism. But what really happened?
Politically popular policies and regulations 
enacted by the federal government in Canada 
and especially in the U.S. during the late 1990s 
and the early part of this decade laid the 
groundwork for today’s massive financial mess. 
The Federal Reserve in 2001 lowered interest 
rates to artificially low levels, removed lending 
standards (to boost home ownership), greatly 
increased the money supply, and expanded 
credit on a massive scale. This fuelled a 
historic mortgage boom that created the hous­
ing bubble in the U.S. Trillions in mortgage 
money was loaned out, much of it to home 
buyers of very questionable credit quality. 
These subprime mortgages were repackaged 
as bonds and sold to financial entities on Wall 
Street and across the globe. When the mort­
gages went bad, financial entities lost billions.
In Canada, the national bank also lowered inter­
est rates to follow the beat of the U.S. drums, 
but our banking standards were more stringent. 
As a result, there were few foreclosures and 
other related financial distresses here. Yet, 
to the extent that Canadians held U.S. stocks, 
we too were very much affected as investors. 
That is why so many Canadians have seen our 
investment portfolios drop over the last few 
years.
Now, politicians rail about what government 
should do, but what they don’t understand is 
that the root of the problem is what govern­
ment did do, years before. The lesson is that 
political/government intervention can unleash 
unintended consequences that can destroy a 
company whose stock you own.

158
Part II: Before You Invest 
Distinguishing between nonsystemic 
and systemic effects
Politics can affect your investments in two basic ways: nonsystemic and systemic.
	
✓	Nonsystemic means that the system isn’t affected but a particular partici­
pant is affected.
	
✓	Systemic means that all the players in the system are affected.
In this case, the system is the economy at large. Politics imposes itself 
(through taxes, laws, regulations, and so on) and has an undue influence on 
all the members of that system.
Nonsystemic
Say you decide to buy stock in a company called Hockey Sticks Unlimited Inc. 
(HSU). You believe that the market for hockey sticks has great potential and 
that HSU stands to grow substantially. How can politics affect HSU?
What if Canadian politicians believe that HSU is too big and that it controls 
too much of the hockey stick industry? Maybe they view HSU as a monopoly 
and want the federal government to step in to shrink HSU’s reach and influ­
ence for the benefit of competition and Canadian consumers. Maybe the gov­
ernment believes that HSU engages in unfair or predatory business practices 
and that it’s in violation of antitrust (or antimonopoly) laws. If the Canadian 
government acts against HSU, the action is a nonsystemic issue: The action is 
directed toward the participant (in this case, HSU) and not the hockey stick 
industry in general.
What happens if you’re an investor in HSU? Does your stock investment 
suffer as a result of government action directed against the company? Let’s 
just say the stock price will be tipped and end up lost in the stands.
Systemic
This time, imagine that Canadian politicians want to target the Canadian golf 
industry for intervention because they maintain that golf should be free or 
close to free for all to participate in and that a law must be passed to make 
it accessible to all, especially those people who can’t afford to play. So to 
remedy the situation, the following law is enacted: “Law #67590305598002 
declares that from this day forward, all Canadian golf courses must charge 
only one dollar for any golfer who chooses to participate.”
That law sounds great to any golfer. But what are the unintended effects 
when such a law becomes reality? Many people agree with the sentiment 
of the law, but what about the cause-and-effect aspects of it? Obviously, all 
things being equal, golf courses will be forced to close. Staying in business is 

159
 Chapter 11: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
uneconomical if their costs are higher than their income. If they can’t charge 
any more than a dollar, how can they possibly stay open? Ultimately (and 
ironically), no one can play golf.
What happens to investors of a specific golf-related company that operates 
in Canada? If the world of golf shrinks, demand for that company’s product 
or service shrinks as well. The value of this company’s stock will certainly be 
stuck in a sand trap.
Examples of politics creating systemic problems are endless, but you get the 
point.
Understanding price controls
Stock investors should be very wary of price controls, which are a great 
example of regulation. It is something that is not here yet, but that we as 
Canadians experienced in the late seventies. A price control is a fixed price on 
a particular product, commodity, or service mandated by the government.
	
Price controls have been tried continuously throughout history, and they’ve 
continuously been removed because they ultimately do more harm than 
good. It’s easy to see why. Say you run a business that sells chairs, and a law 
is passed that states, “From this point onward, chairs can be sold only for 
$10.” If all your costs stay constant at $9 or less, the regulation isn’t that bad. 
However, price controls put two dynamics in motion:
	
✓	First, the artificially lower price encourages consumption — more 
people buy chairs.
	
✓	Second, production is discouraged. What company wants to make chairs 
if it can’t sell them for a decent profit?
What happens to the company with a fixed sales price (in this example, 
$10) and rising costs? Profits shrink, and depending on how long the price 
controls are in effect, the company eventually experiences losses. The chair 
producer is eventually driven out of business. The chair-building industry 
shrinks, and the result is a chair shortage. Profits (and jobs) soon vanish. So 
what happens if you own stock in a company that builds chairs? Well, when 
you hear which way the stock price is going, you better be sitting down (if, of 
course, you have a chair).
Many economists are warning that as the U.S. government continues to 
print money to finance its stimulus packages and huge debt levels, the risk 
of inflation will soar. If inflation does occur, vote-hungry politicians will be 
very tempted to implement price controls in certain industry segments, espe­
cially those most prone to inflationary pressures such as oil and food. At its 

160
Part II: Before You Invest 
worst, you may even see wage controls. In fact, the Ontario government came 
very close to reneging on its promise to increase the minimum wage, and 
only stopped because it realized that this was wage control in disguise. The 
Liberals did not wish to be the first to enter into the icy and choppy waters of 
wage and price controls!
Poking into Political Resources
Ignoring what’s going on in the world of politics is like sleepwalking near 
the Grand Canyon — a bad idea! You have to be aware of what’s going on. 
Governmental data, reports, and political rumblings are important clues to 
the kind of environment that’s unfolding for the economy and financial mar­
kets. Do your research with the following resources so you can stay a step 
ahead in your stock-picking strategies.
Government reports to watch for
The best analysts look at economic reports from both private and govern­
ment sources. The following sections list some reports and statistics issued 
by the government that are worth checking out. For private reports on the 
economy, investors can turn to sources such as the American Institute for 
Economic Research (www.aier.org) and Moody’s (www.economy.com). In 
Canada, the National Post and The Globe and Mail routinely list the release 
dates of key domestic economic reports in their business pages. Also check 
out RBC Economics Research (www.rbc.com/economics) and click the 
Releases Calendar icon in the Tools section.
GDP
Gross domestic product (GDP), which measures a nation’s total output of 
goods and services for the quarter, is considered the broadest measure of 
economic activity. Although GDP is measured in dollars, it’s usually quoted 
as a percentage. You typically hear a news report that says something 
like, “The economy grew by 2.5 percent last quarter.” Because GDP is an 
important overall barometer of the Canadian economy, the key thing to 
remember is that it should be a positive number. The report on the GDP is 
released quarterly by Statistics Canada (www.statcan.gc.ca) for Canadian 
economic performance. Specifically, type in the search term “Canadian 
Economic Observer” in Statistics Canada’s home page to take you to its flag­
ship publication for Canadian economic statistics, including GDP. For quar­
terly reports on the U.S. GDP, check out the U.S. Department of Commerce 
(www.commerce.gov).

161
 Chapter 11: Money, Mayhem, and Votes
	
Regularly monitor the GDP along with economic data that relate directly to 
your stock portfolio. The following list gives some general guidelines for evalu­
ating GDP:
	
✓	Over 3 percent: This number indicates strong growth and bodes well for 
stocks. At 5 percent or higher, the economy is sizzling!
	
✓	1 to 3 percent: This figure indicates moderate growth and can occur 
either as the economy is rebounding from a recession or as it’s slowing 
down from a previously strong period.
	
✓	0 percent or negative (as low as –3 percent): This number isn’t good 
and indicates the economy is either not growing or is actually shrink­
ing a bit. A negative GDP is considered recessionary (meaning that the 
economy’s growth is receding).
	
✓	Under –3 percent: A GDP this low indicates a very difficult period for the 
economy. A GDP under –3 percent, especially for two or more quarters, 
indicates a serious recession or possibly a depression.
	
Looking at a single quarter isn’t that useful. Track the GDP over many quarters 
to see which way the general economy is trending. When you look at the GDP 
for a particular quarter of a year, ask yourself whether it’s better (or worse) 
than the quarter before. If it’s better (or worse), then ask yourself to what 
extent it has changed. Is it dramatically better (or worse) than the quarter 
before? Is the economy showing steady growth, or is it slowing? If several 
quarters show solid growth, the overall economy is generally bullish.
Traditionally, if two or more consecutive quarters show negative growth 
(economic output is shrinking), the economy is considered to be in a reces­
sion. A recession can be a painful necessity; it usually occurs when the 
economy can’t absorb the total amount of goods being produced because of 
excess production. A bear market in stocks usually accompanies a recession.
	
The GDP is just a rough estimate at best. It can’t possibly calculate all the fac­
tors that go into economic growth. For example, crime has a negative effect 
on economic growth, but it’s not reflected in the GDP. Still, most economists 
agree that the GDP provides a snapshot of the overall economy’s progress.
Unemployment
The Labour Force Survey is provided by Statistics Canada (www.statcan.gc.
ca) and Human Resources and Skills Development Canada (www.hrsdc.
gc.ca). (In the U.S., it’s provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics — www.
bls.gov.) This information gives investors a snapshot of the health and 
productivity of the economy.

Part II: Before You Invest 
The Consumer Price Index
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a statistic that tracks the prices of a representa­
tive basket of goods and services on a monthly basis. This statistic, which is also 
computed by Statistics Canada (and the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S.), is 
meant to track price inflation. Investors should pay attention to the CPI, because a 
low-inflation environment is good for stocks (and bonds, too) while high inflation 
is generally more favourable for sectors such as commodities and precious metals.
Web sites to surf
To find out about new laws being passed or about proposed legislation in 
Canada, go to the Department of Justice Canada’s Web site (laws.justice.
gc.ca). For a look at upcoming laws in the U.S., check out Congress and 
what’s going on at its primary Web sites: the U.S. House of Representatives 
(www.house.gov) and the U.S. Senate (www.senate.gov). 
	
You also may want to check out THOMAS, a service provided by the U.S. 
Library of Congress, at http://thomas.loc.gov. THOMAS is a search engine 
that helps you find any piece of U.S. legislation, either by bill number or key­
word. This search engine is an excellent way to find out whether an industry is 
being targeted for increased regulation or deregulation. In the late 1980s, real 
estate was hit hard when the government passed new regulations and tax rules 
(related stocks went down). When the telecom industry was deregulated in the 
mid-1990s, the industry grew dramatically (related stocks went up). While there 
are no resources like THOMAS in Canada, a simple Google search, or even a 
visit or call to the local legal library of a university, may be of some help.

T
o be an effective stock investor, you need to know where 
to go to get key information about a company’s financial 
health. After you find this information, you have to know 
what it means — and be able to see how some companies 
try to make their numbers look better than they really are. 
This part equips you with this knowledge. We cover some of 
the many risks faced by the companies you invest in or are 
thinking of investing in — and how you, as a smart stock 
investor, can assess those risks. We also give you insights on 
the importance of analyzing industries before investing, and 
we present some exciting emerging-sector opportunities that 
you may wish to pursue.

▶	Taking a snapshot of assets and liabilities — the balance sheet
▶	Assessing cash flows
▶	Using ratios to put the numbers into perspective
I
n this chapter, we introduce you to financial statements — key perfor­
mance indicators for any publicly traded company (and for any other 
organization, for that matter). We discuss the fact that a company’s income 
statement, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement provide you with a big-
picture view of its financial health.
In this chapter, we dig deep into some of the main line items that make up 
each financial statement. These are the elements or components of financial 
statements that can have an important story to tell. We admit that account­
ing may not be the most exciting subject, so we will stick to what you really 
need to know to be effective as an investor. However, make no mistake that 
in this economic environment getting a good read on a company’s fiscal con­
dition is critical.
Reading the Income Statement
It comes as no surprise to you that business and economic activity are under­
taken with the idea of generating a profit. Because we’re not writing an essay 
on political economy, we don’t go into the details of why that is or isn’t a 
good idea. We’ll leave that to others.
Profit is simply the gross revenue of an enterprise, less the cost of producing 
that income, over a defined period of time. So much is made these days of 
earnings and earnings reports. Do you hear much about a company’s cash 
balance, accumulated depreciation, or owner’s equity on Canada’s Business 
News Network or CNBC’s Mad Money and other financial shows? Does every­
one salivate four times a year for asset season?

166
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Earnings are the driving force and key indicator of a company’s progress 
and success. If earnings are growing, the financial press doesn’t worry much 
about the other stuff. Conversely, serve up a couple of double faults on the 
earnings front, and everybody’s all over asset impairment, write-offs, debt, 
weak cash positions, and the like.
Long-term stock price appreciation is based on the growth of a company’s 
asset base and the owner’s equity in that base. If a company is generating 
cash, and particularly if it earns it at a growing rate, that’s a good thing. As 
Warren Buffett says, “If the business does well, the stock always follows.” 
(We’d add from our own experience that it almost always follows — in the 
stock market, as with life, no guarantees apply.)
We discuss other earnings measures, such as free cash flow and EBITDA, 
later in this chapter. The point is that you can measure income in many ways. 
Each reveals an important aspect of business performance, both for deter­
mining the value of the company and for comparing companies.
Revenues
Revenues are the monies a company is owed for providing goods or services 
to another party. In large companies, revenue recognition can be very com­
plicated, and is one area that unethical managers like to manipulate. Revenue 
is also referred to as the top line.
In smaller companies, sales and revenues are straightforward. They repre­
sent accounting dollars generated for business products sold or services per­
formed. (Remember, with accrual accounting it doesn’t matter whether the 
company has been paid yet. If a sale meets accounting tests for recognition, 
the sale is put on the books even if the cash is received later.)
	
In many businesses, such as transportation or utilities, the top line may be 
called revenues, but it’s the same thing. Occasionally, you will see an allow­
ance for returns included that reduces the sales figure. If not, you can usually 
safely assume that returns have already been factored out and reduced the 
sales figure.
Cost of sales
A company’s income statement shows how profitable a company’s core 
operations are by indicating the revenue generated from sales of a product 
or service and then deducting the costs associated with the company’s 
products or services. Cost of sales (COS) or cost of goods sold (COGS) relates 
directly to the sale of products or services. For manufacturers, this figure 
includes labour expenses, material costs, and overhead costs (for example, 

167
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
the portion of electricity costs that relates directly to the products sold). 
COS or COGS for companies selling goods is technically the beginning inven­
tory, plus the cost of goods purchased or manufactured during some period, 
minus the ending inventory.
When a company uses the terms costs and expenses in its financial state­
ments, what it really could be trying to say is that costs are incurred to pro­
duce products or render services and expenses are all the other stuff, like 
paying office rent and support staff.
COS is an important driver of business success. For all but a few companies 
with high intellectual property or service content, COS is the largest eater 
of the revenue pie. For example, the physical COS of Microsoft is tiny with 
respect to revenue, whereas a grocery store like Loblaws or a discount 
retailer like Zellers may see COS in the 70- to 80-percent range. Apples-to-
apples comparisons are critical to effective analysis.
Gross margin
Gross margin, or gross profit, is the difference between a company’s total sales 
and its cost of sales. It is the basic economic output of the business before 
additional overhead, marketing, and financing costs enter the picture. Gross 
profit takes on added meaning when taken as a percentage. This percentage — 
and trends in the percentage — speaks volumes for the health and direction of 
the business.
Selling, general, and administrative 
(SG&A)
A section of every income statement itemizes a series of expenses called 
operating expenses. These are the expenses other than COS, and other than 
interest and taxes. SG&A expense is one of these operating expenses.
SG&A expenses are operating costs associated with making sales, running the 
business, keeping headquarters, marketing, data processing, and administrat­
ing operations. These expenses are indirect in nature. No matter the busi­
ness, any company incurs indirect costs, or the costs of doing business that 
aren’t directly related to producing and selling individual units of product or 
service. Some call it “overhead”; however, SG&A expenses go a little beyond 
the traditional definition of overhead, and some overhead items we’ve seen 
are usually allocated to direct costs, or COS.
Many investors use SG&A as a barometer of management effectiveness — a 
solid management team keeps SG&A expenses in check. SG&A can mushroom 
into a vast slush fund and an internal corporate pork barrel that can easily 

168
Part III: Picking the Winners 
get out of control. Be alert for excessive SG&A; the more the company keeps 
(in executive salaries, for example), the less the shareholder gets (in stock 
price growth and dividends). Like gross margin, looking at SG&A as a per­
centage is best.
Research and development (R&D)
This type of operating expense is common and essential in pharmaceuti­
cal and technology companies, which need to make ongoing investments 
in future products. R&D can also be rife with abuse; if a company wastes 
money, it can easily hide it in the R&D category. Because these investments 
occur long before products are produced, and because many of them never 
pan out into saleable products, companies are allowed by accounting rules to 
record most research and development (R&D) costs as a period expense.
Also note that companies without a significant R&D effort may not report it 
in a separate line. And in some financial statements, R&D is called product 
development.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization represent the accountant’s assignment of 
the operating cost of a long-lived asset to specific business periods, or its 
estimated useful life. Depreciation is used when referring to physical fixed 
assets, and amortization is used when referring to intangible assets (such as 
goodwill, patents, and so forth). Some of you Canadian oil and mining invest­
ing bugs may run into the term depletion: a cost recovery for the exhaustion 
of natural resource assets.
In our experience, depreciation and amortization (operating) expenses show 
up in a wide variety of ways on the earnings statement. Sometimes you’ll see 
a specific line in financial statements for depreciation expenses, especially 
for capital-intensive businesses.
Reserves
Reserves are operating expenses, or charges, taken in anticipation of events 
that are likely to negatively affect financial results. Reserves can be set aside 
to cushion companies from things such as doubtful accounts receivable or 
other bad debts. Reserves are sometimes taken during the good years and 
used in unprofitable years to smooth out the earnings numbers and make a 
company’s operations seem more consistent than they really are.

169
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
Interest and taxes
Interest and taxes are the corporate world’s equivalent of the proverbial sure 
things. So, not surprisingly, space is reserved for them on the earnings statement.
Companies invariably have some form of interest income or interest expense, 
and usually they have both. Interest income comes primarily from cash and 
short-term investments reflected on the balance sheet. Interest expense 
comes, again not surprisingly, from short- and long-term debt balances. 
Interest reporting is usually done as a net interest — that is, by combining 
interest income and expense into a net figure.
Taxes are quite complicated, just as they are for individuals, and the details 
go beyond the scope of this book. Normally an income-tax provision is 
recorded as a single line item on the earnings statement, although this con­
sists of myriad federal, provincial, and local taxes put together.
You don’t need to pay too much attention to taxes, but in today’s economic 
climate you absolutely have to keep an eye on interest expenses. This is 
especially true for companies with high debt loads. These companies may 
be unable to make their debt payments (principal and/or interest), and may 
not be able to refinance their debt either. Such companies are at great risk of 
bankruptcy — just ask GM.
Income from continuing operations
What results from netting out (deducting) interest and taxes from operating 
income is income from continuing operations. From this figure, you can get a 
good picture of company performance, not only from an operating perspec­
tive but also from a financial one. A close look at interest costs tells you, for 
instance, whether operating success (operating income) comes at a financial 
price (high interest expense). If operating income is low or declining and 
financing cost (interest) is large or increasing, look out below!
	
Income from continuing operations tells shareholders, in totality, what their 
investment return is after everyone, including the Canada Revenue Agency, is 
paid. Income from continuing operations is a good indicator of total business 
performance, but be aware of truly extraordinary events driving expenses or 
income.

170
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Extraordinary items
Extraordinary items on an earnings statement are, according to accounting 
rules, to be tied to events that are atypical, irregular, and non-recurring. 
Atypical events aren’t related to the usual activities of the business, and 
seldom occur. Non-recurring events aren’t expected to occur again.
	
Extraordinary items commonly result from business closures (discontinued 
operations) or major restatements due to changes in accounting rules. They 
may result from debt restructurings or other complex financial transactions. 
They may result from layoffs and other employee transactions. Extraordinary 
items generally are not supposed to include asset write-downs (such as receiv­
ables, inventory, or intangibles), foreign currency gains or losses, or divesti­
tures. They’re not the elements described in our section about special items.
	
Our advice to you is to watch for extraordinary expenses that aren’t so 
extraordinary. For example, companies that routinely have some kind of 
write-off every year or reporting period aren’t doing as well as the investing 
community is being led to believe. If earnings are consistently $1 a share each 
quarter, with a consistent $4 write-off each year, the true value generated by 
the business is closer to zero than to four.
A bit of EBITDA
Some companies and financial analysts like 
to use EBITDA, or earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation, and amortization, as their 
business-health barometer. EBITDA fans 
consider it the truest indicator of operating 
success. EBITDA measures operating cash 
generated before interest charges (not from 
operations) are applied and before taxes and 
non-cash depreciation and amortization. In 
a sense, EBITDA is operating income before 
accountants, bankers, and governments take 
their share. EBITDA is sometimes looked at as a 
liquidity measure: positive-EBITDA companies 
can service their debt, but negative-EBITDA 
companies must borrow more.
Although the desire for so-called pure busi­
ness measures makes EBITDA compelling, 
many investors look at EBITDA as a dangerous 
shell game. Sooner or later, a company must 
replace assets. A business can’t proceed on 
the assumption that its assets will last forever, 
which is the assumption that is made when 
depreciation and amortization are factored out. 
Ironically, this is especially true for the technol­
ogy businesses that favour this measure but sit 
on top of some of the most rapidly depreciating 
assets! And as for interest and taxes, they’re 
facts of business life. Who are we kidding, 
anyway? Watch out for glowing announce­
ments of positive EBITDA when accompanied 
by losses on the earnings statement.

171
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
Also, realized gains or losses on investments are non-recurring items and 
ought to be segregated on the income statement if significant in amount. 
Some companies may try to create the impression that these are regular 
income sources by excluding them from extraordinary, unusual, or special 
items.
Impairments, investments, 
and other write-downs
When the value of an asset changes significantly in the eyes of management, 
a company can elect to take a write-down recognizing the change. The write-
down shows up as a decrease in asset value on the balance sheet for the 
asset category involved and (usually) as a one-time operating expense some­
where on the earnings statement. The rules for when and how to take these 
write-downs are, shall we say, flexible. The rules for writing down investment 
losses are particularly complex and beyond the scope of this book. The good 
news is that write-downs are normally reported as a separate line and are 
well documented in the notes.
	
For you as a stock investor, knowing the detail or amount may not be as 
important as knowing the pattern. Are these write-downs really one-time 
adjustments, or does the company continually overinvest in unproductive 
assets? Are companies quick to recognize mistakes, or do they push the finan­
cial impact of mistakes into the financial statements of future periods, toward 
ultimate fiscal oblivion? Write-down behaviour provides insight into manage­
ment behaviour and effectiveness as well as overall business consistency — 
and should not be ignored. We discuss how companies may try to manipulate 
earnings through special items in Chapter 13. Common special items include 
restructuring charges, discontinued operations, and pension losses, and these 
are discussed below.
Restructuring charges
Restructuring charges from continuing operations are those expenses — such 
as employee layoffs, maintenance, or early lease terminations — that are 
incurred when a company closes down or mothballs facilities, or writes off 
impaired assets. Because these assets would have been used up in the pro­
cess of creating operating revenues, charges for restructuring these assets 
are usually factored into the calculation of net income. Massive employee lay­
offs and plant closings, like we still see today, may indicate that the company 
does not expect future business activity to support current employee levels 
or the operation of plants, machinery, and equipment. Restructuring charges 
include real cash expenses, not just allocations of expense.

172
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
Some companies take what is called the big bath. They write off as much as 
they can now so that future earnings will look better through higher reported 
profits. Be mindful of manipulation in this area, one we revisit in Chapter 14.
Discontinued operations
When a company ceases part of its operations, it has to report current 
results, but separately from operating results. This reporting enables inves­
tors to make better comparisons from period to period and creates a fairer 
representation of results.
Pension tension
After years of volatile and declining stock markets, many large pension plans 
are underfunded. Companies are now reporting pension losses instead of the 
gains they were accustomed to. These losses show up in a variety of forms, 
including special charges to earnings, cash flow, or equity, depending on the 
type of plan and the accounting rules involved. Although pension shortfalls 
may not be an immediate liquidity concern, they are often too large for inves­
tors to ignore. Keep an eye on pension expenses.
Net income
Sales less COS, less operating expenses, less interest and taxes, less or plus 
extraordinaries and special items, give you a company’s net income (some­
times referred to as net earnings, or income attributable to common sharehold­
ers, or some similar phrase). Net income represents the final net earnings 
result of the business on an accounting — not necessarily a cash — basis.
Net earnings are usually divided by the number of shares outstanding to 
arrive at earnings per share — the common barometer seen in nearly all finan­
cial reports. Most analysts and investors focus on diluted earnings per share, 
which figure in outstanding employee stock options and other equity grants 
beyond the actual shares outstanding.
The Balance Sheet
The balance sheet can be a great indicator of the financial condition of a busi­
ness. It is a snapshot of assets, liabilities, and what’s left over at a point in 
time. It tells you about where the company has been and how well it did get­
ting there.

173
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
Many investors and business analysts look closely for the following informa­
tion in a balance sheet:
	
✓	The absolute and relative size of the numbers
	
✓	The makeup of assets, liabilities, and owner’s equity
	
✓	Trends
	
✓	Valuation (assessing whether stated values reflect actual values)
Each of these examinations is done with an eye toward what the figure 
should be for a company in that line of business. A company such as Tim 
Hortons, which has frequent, small cash sales, shouldn’t have a large 
accounts receivable balance. A retailer like The Bay should have sizeable 
inventories, but they shouldn’t be out of line for the industry and for the 
company’s category. A semiconductor manufacturer like Tundra has a large 
amount of capital equipment but should depreciate it aggressively to account 
for rapid technological change.
To determine whether balance-sheet numbers are in line, most analysts apply 
certain ratios to the numbers. Ratios serve to draw comparisons among 
companies, and among companies and their industry. By doing so, analysts 
detect whether a company’s performance is better or worse than peers in its 
industry. Key ratios are presented and discussed in Appendix A.
Cash and cash equivalents
	
For most businesses, cash is the best type of asset to have. With cash, no 
question exists about its value: Cash is cash! Cash equivalents are essentially 
cash. They’re short-term marketable securities, such as GICs and term depos­
its, with little to no price risk that can be converted to cash at a moment’s 
notice.
Value investors, in particular, like cash. Cash is security, and it forms the 
strongest part of the safety net that value investors seek. You should ques­
tion a cash balance only if it appears excessive against the needs of the busi­
ness. Also, take a look at the notes to the financial statements to make sure 
the marketable securities have not lost significant value and that they are, 
in fact, cash equivalents. Should a company put any extra cash to work in 
an investment or acquisition that might return more than the 3 or 4 percent 
it would get in a bank? And why isn’t it being returned to shareholders as a 
dividend? Most companies don’t retain that much cash, but occasionally it 
can become a red flag.

174
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Accounts receivableAccounts receivable represent funds that are owed to the 
business for products delivered or services performed. As individuals, every­
one likes to be owed money — until we’re owed too much money. The same 
attitude applies to corporations.
The type of industry that a company operates in dictates the amount of 
accounts receivable. Obviously a small-sale retailer such as Tim Hortons 
operates mostly on cash — you don’t give them an IOU for those maple-dip 
donuts, do you? Most companies that sell directly to consumers have few 
accounts receivable.
Contrast this with companies that sell to other companies (business-to-business) 
or to distributors or retailers in the supply chain. Most of this business is 
done on account, meaning that first goods or services are delivered, and then 
invoices are sent. The billing process creates an accounts receivable that 
goes away only when the customer pays the bill. So suppliers to other busi­
nesses or distribution and sales channels often have significant accounts 
receivable.
	
How much of a company’s asset base should be made up of accounts receiv­
able? Current thinking suggests that cash businesses such as Tim Hortons 
have 5 percent or less of their asset base in accounts receivable. Traditional 
retailers and other business-to-consumer companies have 20 to 30 percent 
or more in receivables if they provide credit to customers through their own 
credit cards. Equipment manufacturers and other business-to-business com­
panies sometimes carry receivables of 50 percent or more of their total assets.
For most business-to-business industries, accounts receivable are a part of 
doing business and, in a sense, a cost of doing business (cash is forgone to 
give the customer time to pay). The question is, “How much commitment to 
accounts receivable is necessary to support the business?” Be keenly aware 
of situations in which companies aren’t collecting on their bills or are using 
accounts receivable to create credit incentives for otherwise questionable 
customers to buy their product.
To assign value to accounts receivable, pay attention to the following factors:
	
✓	Size of accounts receivable relative to sales and other assets: Is a com­
pany extending itself too much to sustain or grow the business? Industry 
comparisons and common sense dictate the answer.
	
✓	Trends in accounts receivable: Is a company continually owed more 
and more money, with potentially greater and greater exposure to non­
payment? Look at a company’s accounts-receivable history and compare 
the numbers to its sales figures.

175
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
	
✓	Quality of accounts receivable: Typically, most companies collect on 
more than 95 percent of their accounts-receivable balances, and thus 
they’re almost as good as cash. But if accounts-receivable balances 
grow, and particularly if large reserves show up on the income state­
ment (marked as “allowance for doubtful accounts” or some such), this 
is a red signal flare that no investor should miss.
	
Some financial statements show notes receivable as a separate balance-sheet 
item under current assets. Notes receivable are essentially a special form 
of accounts receivable — a promissory note for a significant amount that’s 
extended to a specific firm for a specific reason. For the most part, notes 
receivable should be treated as normal accounts receivable, but it might be 
worth a quick glance at the note-holder and the terms of the note to spot any­
thing unusual.
Inventory
Inventory can be a critical, make-or-break asset, and it factors in company valu­
ation. Companies live and die by their ability to effectively manage inventory.
Inventory is all valued material procured by a business and resold, with 
or without added value, to a customer. Retail inventory consists of goods 
bought, warehoused, and sold through stores. Manufacturing inventory con­
sists of raw material, work in process, and finished goods awaiting shipment.
For most companies, the key to successfully managing inventory is to match 
it as closely as possible to sales. That is, the faster that procured inventory 
can be processed and sold, the better. Money tied up in inventory is money 
that can’t be invested elsewhere in the business — this is referred to as an 
opportunity cost of doing business.
Valuing inventory can be challenging. Companies don’t provide much infor­
mation about their inventories. The most information you’ll normally get is 
a breakdown of how much inventory there was at the beginning of the year, 
how much inventory was purchased (or manufactured) during the year, and 
how much was left over at the end of the year. Little else is known about 
what those inventories really are, or about their real value. A warehouse of 
outdated computer processors probably carries a book inventory value, but 
the computers aren’t worth much on the market.
Inventory valuation is further affected by accounting methods employed by a 
firm. The method affects both balance-sheet carrying value and cost recogni­
tion on the income statement.

176
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
You need to appraise inventory balances for economic value and efficiency of 
use. Look at the size of the asset in an absolute sense and relative to the size 
and sales of the business. Look for trends, favourable and unfavourable, in 
inventory balances. Apply the inventory ratio analyses we discuss in Appendix 
A. Look at competitors and industry standards. Where possible, look at inven­
tory quality and past track records for inventory obsolescence and resulting 
write-offs. And then be conservative. It often makes sense to assign a value of 
50 to 75 percent, sometimes less, to inventory values appearing on a balance 
sheet. The auditors could easily have dropped the ball when they counted and 
valued a client company’s inventory!
Fixed assets
The balance sheet entry called property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) is 
pretty clear from the name. It refers to the fixed assets — land, buildings, 
machinery, fixtures, office and computer equipment, and similar items — 
owned by the firm for productive use. Depending on the industry, this line 
item may have a different name. Retail stores like Zellers, for example, don’t 
have plants.
	
Valuation of PP&E can vary widely. The key to understanding PP&E value is 
to understand depreciation. Depreciation is an amount subtracted each year 
by accountants from an asset purchase price for normal wear and tear and 
technological obsolescence. Depreciation methods are discussed further later 
in this section, but for now all you need to know is that depreciation can affect 
underlying asset values substantially. Of course, the value of property, plant, 
and equipment can vary a lot by what it is, where it is, and how it’s used. 
These factors, in turn, vary by industry and things specific to the company 
itself, such as its location.
	
Although most PP&E items are subject to depreciation charges, land is not. Is 
the value of land overstated on the books? Hardly. Land is normally carried at 
purchase, or acquisition, value. This affords a unique value-investing oppor­
tunity. Land purchased in the 1940s or 1950s is often worth much more today 
than it was back then, but it is seldom reflected in the books. There may be 
some real hidden gems lurking below the balance sheets of forestry, mining, 
and certain old-line industrial corporations.
Accountants have a variety of accepted methods for assigning depreciation 
dollars at their disposal. A detailed discussion of depreciation and deprecia­
tion methods is accounting stuff that’s well beyond the scope of this book. 
But you may find it useful to recognize two major groupings of methods for 
assigning depreciation dollars: accelerated and straight-line depreciation.

177
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
The choice of depreciation methods is important. Accelerated depreciation 
allows greater deductions in the earlier years of the life of an asset, resulting 
in the most conservative PP&E asset valuations. It also results in the most 
conservative view of earnings and allows more room for future net earnings 
growth because you can assume that a greater portion of asset depreciation 
is behind you.
But some companies may deliberately prop up current earnings by employ­
ing straight-line depreciation methods, which spread the costs evenly over 
the life of an asset. Watch for companies switching over to straight-line from 
accelerated methods. Depreciation methods are disclosed in the notes sec­
tion of the statements.
	
Depreciation is an accounting — not a cash — expense. No cheque is cut 
for depreciation. Instead, the cheque is cut when the asset is purchased. 
Depreciation is the leading difference between stated earnings and cash flows, 
and it can mean the difference between survival and failure for a company 
recording net income losses. Cash flow, unburdened by depreciation, may 
still be positive. But look out below. Cash consumed to keep a losing business 
afloat may not be available the next time a key piece of equipment needs to 
be replaced. Reporting methods that downplay depreciation or ignore it alto­
gether, such as the pro forma reporting craze, indicate trouble. For more info 
on this issue, see Chapter 13.
Investments
Besides buying marketable securities that are easy to sell, many companies 
commit surplus cash to more substantial long-term investments. These 
company investments can serve many purposes: to achieve returns as any 
other investor would, to participate in the growth of a related or unrelated 
industry, or to eventually obtain control of another company. Long-term 
investments are harder to dispose of than marketable securities, but they 
can be very profitable during the holding period. Favourable tax treatment of 
Canadian dividends and gains makes investing in other Canadian companies 
more attractive still.
	
Investments can be valued in many ways, but ultimately they all boil down 
to historical cost or market valuation. Watch out for declining fair values and 
particularly for large gross unrealized losses — future write-offs and asset value 
impairment loom large. Gauge the size of investments on the balance sheet, look 
for details, and understand management’s intent in making the investments.

Intangible assets
Asset valuation gets really fun for Canadian investors, and especially for 
value investors, when the discussion turns to intangibles, also sometimes 
referred to as soft assets. Intangibles are non-physical assets that are criti­
cal in acquiring and maintaining sales and producing a competitive edge. 
Intangibles include patents, copyrights, franchises, brand names, and trade­
marks. Also included is the all-encompassing goodwill often acquired when 
buying (and overpaying for) other companies. Goodwill is the premium paid 
over and above the net asset value (tangible and intangible assets minus 
liabilities) of a company. Such premiums are paid for various reasons, like to 
outbid another company in a takeover battle, or as a gesture of confidence in 
the future of the acquirer.
Placing a financial value on these ethereal and nebulous brand-related assets 
is difficult, but accountants seem to be able to pull it off. If a historical cost 
exists, accountants may carry the intangible at that cost. This is often the 
case with goodwill from company acquisitions or mergers.
The key to assessing intangible assets is to understand their carrying value 
and the amortization technique. Intangible assets should all be amortized, 
because patents expire, brand value may be diluted, and so forth. Goodwill 
from acquisitions most certainly — at least for now — must be amortized. 
Like depreciation, valuation depends heavily on the method of amortization. 
Basically the same choice is available between straight-line and accelerated 
amortization, and the chosen method is disclosed somewhere in the finan­
cial-statement notes (refer to “Fixed assets,” earlier in this chapter for the dif­
ference between accelerated and straight-line methods).
Intangibles are subject to a great deal of discretion in their accounting, and 
their sources and form can be numerous and highly variable from one com­
pany to the next. Cast a skeptical eye on large goodwill accounts in particu­
lar, especially if a company seems reluctant to write them off.
But with the advent of modern technology and marketing, the ideas of intel­
lectual capital and brand equity are part of a company’s value and cannot 
simply be ignored. In fact, for some companies, these intangibles may rep­
resent their greatest value. What is the value of the Coca-Cola Company 
without the brand name? Or the value of Microsoft without its lock on PC 
operating-system design? Such brands and locks often ultimately produce 
the best profit streams and best value. Contemporary stock investors need a 
clear understanding of intangible assets and should not just dismiss them in 
an offhand way.

 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
Payables
Almost everyone, individuals or corporations, has payables, defined as 
money owed to others for products purchased or services rendered. The 
liability is created when the service or product arrives; a cash payment fol­
lows later to discharge the liability. Nearly all companies maintain a regular 
balance of current accounts payable, interest payable, and the like.
If payment is received in advance, as with a deposit, the unearned portion is 
tracked as a liability. Sometimes contingent liabilities may be recorded, as in 
warranty claims expected to be paid but not yet actualized.
	
You can do little with current liabilities except subtract them out from intrin­
sic company value. But also realize that current liabilities aren’t necessarily 
a bad thing and that they can result in higher effective returns on ownership 
capital with relatively low cost and risk.
Long-term liabilities
Long-term corporate liabilities are really no different than those in personal 
finance: They represent contracted commitments to pay back a sum of 
money over time, with interest. For the individual, they come in the form of 
loans and mortgages; for the corporation, they occur more often in the form 
of tradable notes and bonds. The result, however, is the same in both cases.
As for short-term liabilities, you don’t need to look too closely at the amount 
or quality of these liabilities. Trends can be important, however. Relying 
increasingly on long-term debt may be a sign of trouble, especially these 
days. The company may not be making ends meet and may be having trouble 
raising capital in these tight credit markets, which is never a good sign.
	
In addition, a company that’s constantly changing, restructuring, or otherwise 
tinkering with long-term debt may be sending tacit signals of trouble. The 
company may be seeking concessions from lenders behind the scenes. In any 
event, attention paid to this kind of activity diverts attention from the core 
business, which is not a good thing and should be a warning flag for value 
investors.
Excessive use of debt signals potential danger if things don’t turn out the way 
a company expects them to. Leverage is a good thing when things are going 
a company’s way. Debt financing can be used to produce more product for 
more markets — and, thus, more profit and, in the end, a bigger business. 
Return to owners is proportionately higher: Their investment stays the same 
while the returns grow. But as everyone knows, this can work the other way. 

180
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Stock investors don’t like surprises, and a company with uncertain prospects 
and a lot of debt is very risky.
Again, factor in liabilities as a negative factor in company and stock valua­
tion and look for unfavourable trends or the excessive use of long-term debt. 
Generally, liabilities don’t require the close study that you might give to assets.
Owner’s equity
Because you’re contemplating making an investment in a company, isn’t own­
er’s equity the most important balance-sheet item? You and other investors 
are, in essence, either directly or indirectly contributing capital. This capital 
is in turn converted into an asset and then in turn converted into revenue and 
profit to produce a return to the owner. You’re making a decision to allocate 
capital to a company that, for its part, tries to do the best job allocating capi­
tal to opportunities that produce the best return.
Owner’s equity, or book value, is the sum of paid-in capital and retained earn­
ings — assets (which can be valued and reported with a degree of latitude) 
minus liabilities (which occur at face value). Thus, book-value reporting is 
done with a degree of latitude. Value investors talk about three different book 
value measures:
	
✓	Book value as owner’s equity: Total book assets minus liabilities
	
✓	Tangible book value: Total book value minus all or part of intangibles
	
✓	Book value per share: Accounting book value divided by the number of 
common shares outstanding
	
All three of these measures crop up in value-investing discussions and papers. 
Be alert, because sometimes they’re used interchangeably.
Like liabilities, the equity portion of the balance sheet is critical to a company’s 
functioning, but it really requires relatively little scrutiny on your part. We take 
you on a short tour but avoid the tedious discussions of classes of stock, par 
value, and the like that befuddle so many readers of financial stories. For this 
discussion, owner’s equity consists of two things: paid-in capital — a fancy 
term for stock — and retained earnings.
Paid-in capital
Paid-in capital represents the total value paid into the company by its owners — 
its shareholders. It gets a little complicated with the discussion of par value and 
additional paid-in capital. Total paid-in capital represents capital actually paid 
into the company at initial or subsequent company stock sales and has nothing 
to do with market price or market value. In and of itself, you need pay little atten­
tion to this item.

181
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
Retained earnings
Retained earnings are profits from past operating periods that are retained 
or reinvested in the business. Technically speaking, company profits belong 
to the shareholders, but it becomes management’s option to decide whether 
to actually pay them out. Typically, managers think that they can invest the 
money more effectively than their shareholders. Stock investors of all stripes 
are betting that they’re right!
So long as a company’s business is viable, shareholders probably want to see 
retained earnings as high as possible, and growing. It’s a capital allocation 
game — the earnings are better suited to that company’s purpose than any­
where else. By investing in the company, you’ve already decided that, so you 
may as well keep your money on the table.
	
So generally when it comes to retained earnings, more is better — especially 
if accompanied by a reasonable dividend policy in which management is shar­
ing some of the spoils with the owners. On the other hand, watch for rapidly 
declining or, worse, negative retained-earnings balances. Negative retained 
earnings are almost a sure sign of trouble, usually brought on by asset values 
declining faster than expected, excessive debt, an overinflated stock offer­
ing price, or a combination of the three. As a value investor, you should view 
negative retained earnings as another bright-red signal flare.
The Statement of Cash Flows
Earlier, we mentioned the difference in timing between certain accounting 
transactions and related cash collections and disbursements. Build it and 
ship it this month and then record the revenue, even though cash payments 
may not arrive until months later. Buy and pay for a million-dollar machine 
today, but expense it over its production life through depreciation. Amortize 
a patent and never write a cheque at all.
These transactions and a host of others create differences between account­
ing earnings and cash measures of business activity. A business needs cash 
to operate. A business generating positive cash flow is much healthier than 
one that’s bleeding cash and borrowing to stay afloat. Because of non-cash 
items, earnings statements don’t give a complete cash picture. So stock 
investors look for a statement of cash flows as a standard part of the finan­
cial-statement package.
	
Sometimes the statement of cash flows is called sources and uses of funds or 
something similar. Accountants use the terms funds and cash interchangeably.

182
Part III: Picking the Winners 
The statement of cash flows tracks cash obtained in, or used in, three sepa­
rate kinds of business activity: operating, investing, and financing. It also 
tracks dividends paid to shareholders. It is a very important piece of the 
financial-statement puzzle.
Cash flow from operations
Similar to operating income, cash flow from operations tells you what cash is 
generated from, or provided by, normal business operation and what cash is 
consumed by, or used for, the business. (“Provided by” and “used for” are the 
terms used on the cash-flow statement.) Net income from continuing opera­
tions is thus the starting point.
To the net income, add (or subtract) the adjustments to reconcile net income 
to operating cash flow. Here is where you add back depreciation and amortiza­
tion dollars; that is, dollars that came out of accounting income but had no 
corresponding cash payment. So far, so good.
	
Next comes cash provided by (used for) current assets and current liabilities. If 
this is familiar territory and you understand how increases in current assets 
and liabilities affect cash, it makes sense to you that an inventory increase 
consumed some cash. Increases in liabilities provide cash. Decreases in liabili­
ties use cash. (This concept is easier to grasp: It’s a single cash transaction to 
pay a bill.) Increases in current assets (other than cash) use cash. Decreases 
in assets (as in a net decrease in inventory) provide cash.
Cash flow from investing activities
Cash flow from operations tells what cash was generated in the normal 
course of business and by changes in current asset and liability (working cap­
ital) accounts on the balance sheet. But what about cash used to invest in the 
business? Or used to invest in other businesses? What about cash acquired 
by selling investments in other businesses? The second section of the state­
ment of cash flow provides this information.
For most growing companies, cash flow from operations should absolutely be 
positive, but cash flow from investing activities is often negative. Why? Is this 
okay? Yes, because growing companies need more physical investments — 
property, plant, and equipment (PP&E) — to sustain growth. Generally, nega­
tive cash flows in PP&E suggest that the company is satisfied with its growth 
plan and feels that funds must be invested elsewhere for a maximum invest­
ment return.

183
 Chapter 12: Financial-Statement Boot Camp
“Free” cash flow
Free cash flow sounds like what we all want in our lives, eh? Positive cash 
flow, and it’s free! Free cash flow is a good indication of what a company 
really has left over after meeting obligations, and thus the flow could theo­
retically return to shareholders.
	
Free cash flow is defined as net after-tax earnings, plus depreciation and amor­
tization and other non-cash items, minus capital expenditures, minus (or plus) 
changes in working capital (current assets and liabilities).
Earn income, pay for the costs of doing business, and then what’s left over is 
yours to keep as an owner. Pretty simple. Free cash flow is a much more real­
istic long-term view of business success and potential owner proceeds than 
EBITDA (which doesn’t factor out as many cash costs). Many investors, espe­
cially value investors, use free cash flow as the basis for calculating intrinsic 
value.
Cash flow from financing activities
Investing activities tell what a firm does with cash to increase or decrease 
fixed assets and assets not directly related to operations. Financing activities 
tell where a firm has obtained capital in the form of cash to fund the busi­
ness. Proceeds from the sale of company shares or bonds (long-term debt) 
are a source of cash. If a company pays off a bond issue or buys back its own 
stock, that’s a use of cash for financing.
	
A consistent cash flow from financing activities indicates excessive depen­
dence on credit or equity markets. Typically, this figure oscillates between 
negative and positive. A big negative spike reflects a big bond issue or stock 
sale. In such a case, check to see if the resulting cash is used for investments 
in the business (probably okay) or to make up for a shortfall in operating cash 
flow (probably not okay). If the generated cash flows straight to the cash bal­
ance, you should wonder why a company is selling shares or increasing debt 
just to increase cash, although often the reasons are difficult to know. Perhaps 
an acquisition? Perhaps something more troubling?
Introducing Ratio Analysis
Financial statements often contain an overwhelming amount of information 
and numbers. As a result, financial analysts and accountants have developed 
ratios to help them tease out the story behind the numbers. Ratio analysis 

184
Part III: Picking the Winners 
can help you put things in proper context. They measure the financial health 
of a company from year to year, or quarter to quarter. A company’s overall 
financial health is driven by factors like profitability, debt load, and operating 
efficiency. Ratios exist to specifically measure these and other factors.
We explore ratios in more detail in Appendix A. In the meantime, we just 
want you to take heart and not be overwhelmed by all the numbers. Many of 
the investment Web sites we introduce to you in Appendix B and elsewhere 
in this book also publish key ratios that you can (and should) use to com­
pare one company to another. This way, you don’t have to physically line up 
companies’ financial statements beside each other to compare their relative 
performance.
Why compare the ratios of one company to another, or to an industry-aver­
age ratio? When a company’s ratios differ from those of similar companies or 
industry averages, they can serve as early-warning signals of problems — or 
opportunities. Even without inter-company comparisons, ratios provide you 
with a lens to bring into clearer focus the information that comes from reams 
of financial statements. Ratios explain the relationship between two or more 
numbers, thus providing you with scale and context. Used properly, ratios 
tell a powerful overall story about the financial condition of a company.

S
tock investors must see beyond the obvious when reviewing financial 
statements. All too many companies are quick to use aggressive account­
ing techniques that make their financial statements look better than they 
really are. Nortel, Enron, and WorldCom quickly come to mind. Aggressive 
accounting refers to recognizing revenue too quickly, and expenses too 
slowly. It also means overestimating asset values, and underestimating or 
hiding liabilities.
Acting as a company watchdog isn’t enough for you as a stock investor. You 
should be a forensic investor, acting more like a bloodhound sniffing out indi­
cators of window dressing (another term that describes aggressive account­
ing), or even fraud. You, as a smart investor, have to look under the hood at 
some important details in the financial statements. You also have to see how 
financial-statement messages relate to the broader issues facing the company 
to be able to spot inconsistencies and aggressive accounting.
Most Canadian stock investors are reluctant to review financial statements 
and related footnotes because of their complexity. It’s not fun. This is under­
standable, because a thorough knowledge of the financial statements of a 
company of any size can require lots of time and effort. However, by using 
an efficient approach — which we outline in this chapter — you can quickly 
glean the key information about a company’s financial condition. You can 
determine a fairer representation of its current state and future prospects by 
focusing on certain indicators of aggressive accounting.

186
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
If the message conveyed by financial statements is bad, some companies will 
be tempted to use creative accounting techniques to hide damaging informa­
tion or to provide a twisted and distorted picture of their financial condition. 
This chapter shows you how companies may try to do this, with a focus on 
the income statement. We also show you how to spot aggressive accounting 
and assess its impact. (Keep in mind that accounting transactions don’t affect 
just the income statement or just the balance sheet. When a transaction 
affects one financial statement, it eventually impacts the other.) Therefore, 
approach financial statements, and the companies they represent, with a 
healthy skepticism and be alert to window dressing.
How Did All This Start?
Recent reports of high-profile company failures, such as those noted above, 
have put the spotlight on aggressive accounting. Investors and analysts have 
renewed the call for audited financial statements that show a fair picture of 
a company’s financial performance and position. The main purpose of an 
audit is to ensure that the financial statements fairly present the company’s 
financial condition and that they comply with generally accepted accounting 
principles (GAAP).
However, some auditors were not doing their job, which was to provide an 
objective opinion on financial statements. They gave clean bills of health to 
some very sick companies. Analysts fared no better; many were too busy 
giving buy recommendations on those very same troubled companies. The 
stage was set for a great big fall that even Humpty Dumpty could not duplicate.
Stock investors expect a company to provide meaningful disclosure about 
where it has been, where it is, and (to a certain extent) where it is going. 
Without solid financial statements, the value of the company in investors’ 
eyes may diminish, and they will lose confidence in the company. Companies 
without solid results are easily tempted into using aggressive accounting.
The problem of creative accounting is not a new one. Even today, the market 
remains unforgiving of companies that miss their estimates. Seeing a public 
company fail to meet its so-called estimate numbers by mere pennies and 
watching it lose more than 5 percent of its stock value in one day is not uncom­
mon. Pressures to make the numbers may result in a company taking part in a 
certain amount of earnings manipulation — the subject of this chapter.
How are earnings manipulated? We present details in this chapter about 
some of the common methods of window dressing that are used to boost 
current-year earnings or smooth out income. The following points introduce 
you to several of these methods:

187
 Chapter 13: Silly Income-Statement Tricks
	
✓	Recording revenue before it is earned
	
✓	Creating fictitious revenue
	
✓	Boosting profits with non-recurring transactions
	
✓	Shifting current expenses to a later period
	
✓	Shifting future expenses to an earlier period
How can you tell from a bird’s-eye view that a company may be heading for 
trouble? Broad indicators include
	
✓	Earnings-trend problems: One of the most significant indicators of 
window dressing is a downward trend in earnings. Companies disclose 
earnings for the last two to three years in the annual report, so they 
don’t focus just on one year’s net income.
	
✓	Reduced and inconsistent cash flow: Management can exploit the 
leeway provided by GAAP in several ways to create the illusion of 
increased earnings. We discuss some key window-dressing approaches 
in this chapter. You can use the cash-flow statement to verify the valid­
ity of earnings. If net income is moving up while cash flow from opera­
tions is falling, something may be out of order.
	
✓	Excessive debt: Debt load is a critical factor in determining whether a 
company can survive these difficult times. Companies saddled with too 
much debt lack the financial flexibility to respond to emergencies or 
take advantage of opportunities. Investors should pay special attention 
to a company’s debt-to-equity ratio and the total debt-to-shareholders’ 
or debt-to-owners’ equity. (We discuss ratios in Appendix A.) The level 
of shareholders’ or owners’ equity on the statements should exceed the 
amount of debt by a significant amount; debt payments should be easily 
serviced.
	
✓	Overstated inventories and receivables: Accounts receivable and 
inventory ratios reveal a lot, and they’re also discussed in Appendix 
A. Customers may not be paying their bills, or the company may be 
stuck with aging merchandise. Liquidity problems will eventually arise. 
Overstated inventories and receivables are often at the heart of window 
dressing, or even corporate fraud, and can hurt future profits. Trends 
over time are also important here. (We discuss accounts-receivable and 
inventory issues in Chapter 14.)
	
✓	Auditor-switching: Auditor dismissals and the financial condition of a 
company can be interdependent. Firms in the midst of financial distress 
switch auditors more often than healthy companies do.

188
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Revealing Revenue Manipulation
Companies sometimes try to boost earnings by manipulating the recognition 
of revenue. They recognize it before a sale is actually complete, before the 
product or service is delivered to a customer, or at a time when the customer 
still has substantial options to terminate, void, or delay the sale. Companies 
may be tempted to speed revenue recognition — or to simply create it!
Accelerating sales
Companies often negotiate special payment terms and other incentives to 
entice customers to shift next fiscal year’s first-quarter purchases into the 
current fiscal year’s income statement. The existence of big bonuses for sales 
staff provides added incentive to meet current-year sales targets. Moving (or 
stuffing) large amounts of inventory onto the shoulders of retailers and dis­
tributors also avoids having excess inventory in company warehouses, which 
costs money.
	
Be mindful that although accelerating revenue in the current year may 
improve profitability this year, the ultimate result is a sales decline showing 
up on the following year’s first-quarter income statement. Management may 
conveniently explain this away as a “seasonal trend.”
Paying with cash, credit card, or stock?
Beyond the above loan arrangements, it sometimes happens that companies 
accept a customer’s stock as consideration for goods and services sold. 
Companies occasionally buy stakes in other companies to help influence 
future product sales or to cultivate strategic relationships. Be mindful of this 
uncommon but very risky practice.
Creating revenue out of thin air
Revenues can also be created. Yup. Created — without a bona fide sales 
transaction. Companies that are audacious enough to do this can artificially 
swap services and book them as sales. At the same time, the buyer classifies 
the swap as capital outlays on the balance sheet. In accounting-speak, the 
income statement gets a revenue credit (good) and the balance sheet gets a 
debit (also good).
Similar sleight of hand can be found in the practice of booking as revenues 
customers’ questionable contractual obligations — which may never be 
collected. This violates the GAAP principle of booking revenues only when 

189
 Chapter 13: Silly Income-Statement Tricks
collection is likely and the amount of revenue is determinable. Under these 
scenarios, no cash is exchanged or received, but accounting earnings are 
artificially increased, and assets are inflated.
Moving revenue in mysterious ways
Some companies are so fixated on the top line that they distort the way rev­
enue is presented on the income statement. Analysts and stock investors 
place a lot of emphasis on revenue growth, so the incentive is there for com­
panies to window-dress revenues.
Gross and net
Several companies, especially those in the Internet sector, book revenues 
that actually belong to someone else! Some travel Web site operators and 
online auction sites have a revenue figure that represents the aggregate value 
of all products and services sold or brokered. They don’t net out the portion 
of those revenues that belong to the actual service providers represented on 
their site. Such an accounting practice is also disturbing because many ana­
lysts and investors still value stocks, in part, on the basis of revenue growth. 
They rely on accurate top lines!
Coupon clipping
Coupon promotions are common techniques used by retailers — especially 
Internet e-tailers — that wish to promote higher sales volumes. Most compa­
nies that engage in window dressing exclude the value of promotional give­
aways when booking revenue. They have found a more exciting approach.
Assume for a moment that someone buys a music CD for $30 and uses a $10 
coupon to make the purchase. Under GAAP, just $20 of revenue ought to be 
booked. But some retailers would book $30 in revenue and then charge the 
$10 in promotional costs to marketing expenses. This may result in artificially 
higher sales and gross margin, better top-line comments from financial ana­
lysts, and an inflated share price. Can you spell “distortion”?
Hiding Expenses: Capitalizing Costs
You can turn a garden variety of what should be expenses into assets by 
depreciating and amortizing capital assets (resources that last over one 
year) more slowly than otherwise required under the principle of reasonable­
ness (in other words, by easing it slowly into expenses). With certain costs 
incurred, management can judgmentally overestimate a period of useful 
benefit to longer than one year. That would let management justify recording 
part of it on the balance sheet (as an asset) instead of on the income state­
ment (as an expense).

190
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Small fry
One example of capitalizing expenses is paying for computer peripheral 
equipment or office supplies and then spreading the costs over three or more 
years. These types of expenses rarely benefit periods longer than a year or 
two and should probably be expensed when incurred, depending on the cir­
cumstances. Another example is advertising, where accounting standards 
state that advertising expenses should not be capitalized. GAAP is also spe­
cific about start-up costs (like store pre-opening costs) and states that these 
should be expensed instead of capitalized. Be alert to a series of smaller 
costs that have not been deducted on the income statement and that show 
up on the balance sheet. It may indicate that management is not shy to use 
aggressive accounting in more significant areas, as well.
Big fry
On a larger scale, some companies set up associated companies to perform 
R&D work for them. The original company gets to avoid expensing potentially 
massive research costs by having the associated company assume the R&D 
costs (and related revenue). After this type of accounting sleight of hand, the 
cost of R&D essentially disappears from the books.
R&D can also be manipulated the other way, to help a company take a special 
charge against income. (Special charges to write off assets are discussed in 
Chapter 14.) Briefly, when assets are acquired in a business combination, 
they may be assigned their fair values. The acquirer of R&D-related assets 
accounts for the transaction by judgmentally determining these assets have 
“future uses.” R&D assets are then capitalized, and all others are expensed 
when the deal closes. So it’s somewhat easy to justify expensing these R&D 
costs.
Related-party transactions
A related party is one that can exercise control or significant influence over 
the management or operating policies of another party. A problem can arise, 
for instance, if dealings take place with non-public companies that are con­
trolled by management. In some cases, these non-public companies can get 
saddled with expenses in order for the public company to look great.
Canadian stock investors need to take a closer look at these invisible enter­
prises that might be propping up a firm. The notes to financial statements 
disclose the nature, extent, amount, and timing of related-party transactions 
during the year.

 Chapter 13: Silly Income-Statement Tricks
Sussing Out Stock Options
	
You have to be vigilant in assessing the negative effects of stock options. The 
negative effects happen in the form of the dilution of shares and, thus, your 
stake in the company. When more shares are issued due to someone exercis­
ing options, the share of profits and equity that applies to you gets dwindled 
down.
Alan Greenspan (former chairperson of the U.S. Federal Reserve) and his 
successor, Ben Bernanke, mentioned this issue; economist Peter Schiff has 
talked about it for years. Will the economy, investment community, share­
holders, and companies themselves be better served with a requirement that 
the economic value of stock options be expensed on financial statements?
How options work
An option gives an employee the right, but not the obligation, to buy a share 
of stock in the future at a predetermined price. The more the price of the 
stock goes up, the more valuable the right becomes. Options give employees 
a stake in their company’s future. They also give a young (or established) 
company the chance and ability to grow; the company can use its scarce 
cash funds for growth, not for compensation expenses.
What to watch for
Upcoming accounting rules under IFRS — international financial reporting 
standards that are to come into full force in 2012 — provide that the market 
value of an option is required to be expensed on a U.S. or Canadian public 
company’s income statement. Until then, a company can opt not to do this. If 
it opts out, a public company is still required to report its earnings per share 
on the income statement on a basic basis and on a diluted basis. Diluted 
reporting takes into account the potential reduction in the ownership of 
existing shareholders due to the granting and exercising of options. Many 
market experts believe that the failure to expense stock options has intro­
duced a significant distortion in reported earnings that has grown with the 
increasing prevalence of this form of compensation.
Admittedly, nothing’s nefarious about encouraging stock ownership among 
employees. But those who call for change argue that stock-option compensa­
tion causes company management to focus on driving up the stock price in 
the short term to provide continuing value for their option programs. These 
actions aren’t focused on growing long-term shareholder wealth. Canadian 
stock investors need to keep an eye on the extent, timing, and reasonable­
ness of stock options in a company.

Expensing option costs helps to present a more accurate and conservative 
picture of a company’s financial performance. Several North American surveys 
found that many companies would have seen reported earnings trimmed by 
as much as 200 percent had stock-option expenses been recognized on their 
income statements. It’s a big enchilada of an issue!
	
Executives may be tempted to grant options before good news is released to 
the public. Be wary of this very real risk!
Reviewing Reserves
Some companies use unrealistic assumptions to estimate certain liabilities. In 
doing so, they hide accruals in cookie jars during the good times and reach 
into them as needed in the bad times. Management can smooth income to 
show consistency, or a desired trend that investors like to see.
Companies will build up reserves on the balance sheet (as temporary offsets 
to assets) during highly profitable periods for things such as
	
✓	Insurance losses
	
✓	Lawsuits
	
✓	Loan losses
	
✓	Product and service warranty costs
	
✓	Sales returns and service guarantees
A company builds reserves for these items by booking an expense each 
period, thus offsetting the expense by increasing a reserve liability on the 
balance sheet.
Think of reserve liabilities as the company saying, “I don’t know how much 
in insurance losses and product returns pertains to this year’s sales, but I do 
know that it will be something. So I’ll book an expense on the income state­
ment (in the amount of the estimated liability) and offset this with a liability 
on the balance sheet that may occur and will have to be paid off sometime 
in the future.” When the actual loss occurs, the payment then reduces the 
reserve liability, not the income statement.
The opportunity to manipulate earnings comes in the form of guessing how 
much has to be written off as expenses, regardless of actual write-offs. In 
other words, reserves are judgmentally determined amounts, so a company 
wishing to raise profits may manipulate the reserves to accomplish this. It’s 
not too difficult for management to justify a change in reserves to the audi­
tor. This may simply be based on a change in the business environment. But 
it could also be a blatant attempt by management to channel profits to the 
income statement.

 Chapter 13: Silly Income-Statement Tricks
Taking On Tax Losses
With the economy in major doldrums over the last few years, many compa­
nies suffered losses. This often qualified them for tax credits to be received 
in a future tax period. Many companies recognize this as a special item (rev­
enue) on the income statement in the current year to boost the bottom line. 
A tax asset is also booked on the balance sheet.
Invariably, after a year or so, window dressers make the tax asset (tax credit 
receivable) disappear — the company reevaluates the likelihood of actually 
qualifying for the credit and determines that it stands no chance of collecting 
from CRA. The tax asset gets written off, a special charge is created (in the 
year a company would prefer to see a charge), and the investor is left with 
even more distorted financial statements.
Pro Forma Performance
If normal accounting manipulation — the type performed within GAAP rules — 
wasn’t enough to ruin your stock-investing day, consider the latest trend in 
window dressing: the pro forma earnings statement. Pro forma reports have 
become almost a public-relations alternative to the classic GAAP earnings 
statement.
Picky, picky
Responding in part to investor and analyst pressure and in part to a fairly 
loose (to date) compliance environment, companies started using pro forma 
reporting as a press-friendly reporting alternative.
Actually, pro forma has been in the accounting vocabulary for a long time. 
Pro forma statements were originally used as “unofficial” statements 
designed to project — not report — company performance. Companies plan­
ning to go public or merge with another company issued a pro forma set of 
statements to give an investor a clue as to what forward-looking statements 
might look like. But no longer are pro forma statements limited to special 
situations, as today’s press-friendly financial reporting sometimes does an 
end run right around GAAP.
With pro forma reporting, companies can spin their business pretty much as 
they please. They include certain things but leave out other things — such 
as supposed unusual and nonrecurring expenses — that they consider irrel­
evant to assessing performance. From your perspective as a stock investor, 
pro forma reporting not only undermines statement quality but also makes it 
difficult to compare one company to another.

194
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
Pro forma is really an extension of the EBITDA reporting concept made popular 
in the 1980s (see Chapter 12). Although EBITDA made numbers look better 
than they were by excluding financing costs and asset recovery, at least the 
application of EBITDA was consistent from one company to the next.
Companies routinely omit option costs, investment gains and losses, asset 
impairment or write-downs, goodwill amortization, and other non-cash items. 
In that these expenses are non-cash, value investors can wink and turn their 
heads a little — for a while. But we’ve occasionally seen some very real cash 
expenses, such as interest expense, get written out of the pro forma. Bad 
form!
The good news is . . .
Although companies can release to the public pretty much any pro forma 
report they please, there’s a catch: They must also provide GAAP-compliant 
numbers in releases and submit full GAAP-compliant reports to regulators. 
So you have the pro forma reports, good enough for many investors and 
reflective of how companies want to see themselves. You also have GAAP 
financial statements. But you must dig deeper to understand the difference 
between the pro forma and GAAP — and why the company wants to maintain 
that difference.
From a stock-investing perspective, pro forma reports are obviously dangerous 
in their concealment of long-term asset recovery and similar expenses. In addi­
tion, they make it difficult to compare one company to another — each com­
pany reports different things, and companies may report differently from one 
period to the next. Sorting out these differences can be very time consuming.
We never said that basing stock investing on financial statements was easy.

W
hat with all the media hype about earnings estimates and revenue 
forecasts, you’d think the balance sheet was an annoying add-on to 
the financial statements. However, many in the accounting world believe that 
the balance sheet ought to be the prime focus for anyone who analyzes finan­
cial statements. Perhaps the tide is finally turning.
Think about how most Canadians view their finances. To many, their job is 
like an income statement — it’s the main source of revenue that goes on to 
pay living expenses. Their bank account is like a balance sheet — it’s a reflec­
tion of what’s been saved and what is owed to others. If someone loses his 
or her job, and if the economy stays in a prolonged downturn, what becomes 
more important? The balance sheet, of course. How much is in the savings 
account until another job comes along? Is the cash in that account enough to 
meet mortgage and credit card payments?
Clearly, both the income statement and the balance sheet are important. It’s 
just that they paint pictures that are of different importance to different inves­
tors. If you seek value, you’ll tend to focus on balance sheets. If you’re a growth 
and momentum investor, you’ll likely throw caution to the wind and prioritize 
those revenue-growing companies that may return 5 percent tomorrow.
Regardless whether your focus is on the income statement or the balance 
sheet, the balance sheet is still important. It’s also another area that manage­
ment may be tempted to manipulate.

196
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Accounts Receivable: Allowing 
for Returned Stuff
When the values of customer-receivable balances (what customers still owe 
a company at any given point in time) are in doubt — and most to a cer­
tain extent are — management sets up a provision called the allowance for 
doubtful accounts. It does this by expensing the amount of the reserve to 
the income statement and creating a corresponding liability on the balance 
sheet. The liability offsets the accounts-receivable balance. The allowance for 
doubtful accounts is intended to smooth out the income statement impact 
of bad debts. Instead of charging accounts-receivable losses to the income 
statement as they occur, which could cause wild swings in income, compa­
nies charge a stable amount of bad-debts expense to the income statement 
each period. Later, when a specific customer’s account is actually identified 
for writing off, the allowance account gets charged, not the expense account 
on the income statement.
In practice, the allowance for doubtful accounts (a reserve) is an area that 
involves considerable judgment on management’s part and is therefore sus­
ceptible to manipulation to boost earnings. At the end of the day, however, 
the exact amount of actual future bad debts is always unknown.
Message to auditor: It’s 
the economy, stupid!
A company wishing to squeeze a bit more income into its income-statement 
earnings may reduce the annual expense slightly to put an upward slant on 
earnings. This wouldn’t be an exorbitant reduction in bad-debt expense, 
but rather a subtle shift. When the auditors with the green visors and thick 
glasses come in at the end of the year, the finance people with the Hugo Boss 
suits will justify their rationale for the allowance account. But that rationale 
could be a change from reserving 100 percent of doubtful customers’ bal­
ances to reserving only 40 percent. They may come up with and convey a 
slick justification — like a “recovering economy” — to believe that 60 percent 
or more of the balances will probably be collected.
Red flags and other signs
Stock investors can spot red flags with the allowance account only if suf­
ficient detailed information is available. For example, you can examine the 
relationship between the allowance for doubtful accounts and gross receiv­
ables (adding back the allowance for doubtful accounts to net receivables). 

197
 Chapter 14: Silly Balance-Sheet Tricks
Has the allowance as a percentage of gross receivables declined over the 
years? If so, that could be a sign of manipulation (the company has not 
maintained adequate allowances). It could also simply mean an improved 
collection of receivables. Check out the notes to financial statements, which 
may provide a breakout of the allowance for doubtful accounts and gross 
accounts receivable.
If sufficient detail is provided in the income statement, you may be able to 
spot red flags by analyzing the bad-debt expense (as percentage of sales) 
trend. Look for significant reduction in the debt-expense percentage from 
year to year. If the bad-debt expense percentage reduces significantly, try 
to assess the reason for the reduction. This may be difficult to do, but if you 
spot window dressing elsewhere chances are good that it’s happening in this 
area, too.
Increasing Profits through Inventories
Inventory is another area ripe for aggressive accounting. Under GAAP, the 
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method of accounting for inventory charges the most 
current prices of inventory to the cost of sales on the income statement. 
During these recent years of gradually rising prices, the value companies 
assign to the cost of sales has been higher because the sales of pricier inven­
tory have been transferred into their cost-of-sales figures. In addition, keep in 
mind that industries exist that sell increasingly costly goods. Oil, pharmaceu­
tical, and many mining companies still stand to benefit from window dressing 
their inventories because prices in those sectors never seem to come down 
or stop rising. We also discuss the impact of inventory in Chapter 12.
If a company wishes to increase its cash flow (by reducing taxes paid due 
to lower taxable income), it can use the LIFO method of accounting (assum­
ing rising prices) for inventory. It will manage its inventory levels to keep 
the cost of sales higher. The lower the ending inventory (the less inventory 
placed in the balance sheet), the lower the net and taxable income. Voila, less 
taxes to CRA!
One way to increase profits is through the reserve for inventory obsoles­
cence, which is similar to the allowance for doubtful receivable accounts. It, 
too, is used to smooth out the net-income impact of writing off old, mouldy, 
obsolete inventory. Typically, amounts are properly and gradually written off 
each quarter (which increases the reserve for inventory obsolescence on the 
balance sheet), instead of irregularly and suddenly recording the write-down 
to the income statement when the inventory is deemed obsolete. That’s good 
accounting practice. But any company seeking to boost profits may revisit 
the account reserved for inventory obsolescence to determine whether they 
can justify reducing the allowance — thus increasing the bottom line.

198
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Auditors will review the validity and reasonableness of inventory reserves 
and any changes to inventory accounting policy to detect any manipulation. 
But in this area, you’ll never get close enough to see anything unusual for 
yourself. This is an example of how much reliance all stock investors place 
on the work of external auditors.
Making Acquisitions Look So Good
Entire industries continue to get rattled and changed through consolida­
tions, acquisitions, and spin-offs. Look no further than the auto sector to see 
how fast and furiously changes can happen in an industry! Some acquirers, 
particularly those using stock as an acquisition currency, use crazy market 
conditions as an opportunity to engage in very aggressive accounting for 
acquisitions. What did they do?
In the allocation of the purchase price, they classified a large portion of the 
acquisition price as in-process research and development. In-process R&D 
can be written off as a one-time charge, or big bath. This has the effect of 
removing any future earnings drag.
	
Also be very wary of pre-merger charges. Instead of doing the dirty work of 
recording those costs on the income statement, some companies compel 
the company they’re acquiring to take a hit, taking as many charges against 
income as feasible right before the deal closes. This is a clever idea because 
the target company is poised to be acquired — the terms of the deal are set, 
so it’s not concerned about what its own shareholders will say. The acquiring 
company gets a head start using a basket of acquired assets that have been 
devalued but are still very productive. A reduction in the future amount depre­
ciated each year appears in the income statement.
Special Charges and More Big Baths
Many companies that have experienced horrible results choose to take all 
their lumps at one time. This restructuring — or big-bath accounting — 
involves claiming massive chunks of losses in the income statement with a 
corresponding write-down on the balance sheet of an asset, usually an intan­
gible like goodwill.
Canadian investors witness this phenomenon with mining companies that 
find out the commodity reserves they thought they had underground did 
not really exist. At the end of the day, the company is saying that a company 
it overpaid for in the past no longer has much value, and it’s writing off the 
goodwill asset associated with the acquisition on an accelerated basis.

199
 Chapter 14: Silly Balance-Sheet Tricks
From the viewpoint of an investor nothing is inherently insidious about big-
bath accounting, because it doesn’t inflate profits. But it is an embarrassment 
and a disgrace to a company. So why do companies still do it?
Jim the forward-looking chief financial officer looks into his crystal ball and 
sees that if more value is written off than should be, future net income figures 
will look better. He muses, “Okay, my company looks bad now — but if I run 
a big bath, income will look great tomorrow. Book it, Danno!” That makes 
it really, really difficult for stock investors to properly value his company 
or to compare it meaningfully with other companies in the same industry. 
Distortions are large and confusing to unravel. Even Olly would admit to Stan 
that it’s a fine mess they’re in.
So what can you do in a case like this? Look for areas where special charges 
may occur. Restructuring charges can cover lots of types of expenses, but 
common signs include
	
✓	Closing physical facilities
	
✓	Laying off employees and paying severance costs (treated the same as 
closing facilities)
	
✓	Selling, closing, or exiting a business (discontinued operations)
	
✓	Increasing reserves for litigation (if you have a hard time finding facts 
about litigation, be on the alert for nasty legal surprises)
	
✓	Writing off goodwill or current assets (as described in this chapter)
Companies overstate special charges for other reasons, too. Management 
hopes that analysts will look beyond a one-time loss and focus only on future 
earnings, as many do.
	
As a stock investor, always be skeptical about special charges. Try as best you 
can to assess the impact with the information you have. If it appears that the 
write-offs are blatant, be wary of investing in that company. After all, it has 
already proven that it’s capable of making very big mistakes.
Hiding Liabilities: Off-Balance-Sheet 
Obligations
Some companies hide bad things like excessive debt by transferring it away 
from the balance sheet. Where does this debt go? Quite often it will be 
to a special-purpose entity such as an affiliated company or partnership. 
Companies may push accounting rules to the outer limits and say that their 
debt doesn’t, by the letter of accounting law, meet the definition of debt to 

200
Part III: Picking the Winners 
be disclosed as a liability. Instead, these companies disclose complex agree­
ments entered into that not even seasoned analysts can understand without 
benefit of a flowchart! This lack of full and understandable information chal­
lenges you to find out what the company must pay in order to fulfill its debt 
and other obligations.
Four tactics, including the type described above, warrant further mention 
here. Each has the potential to hide the extent of a company’s liabilities (and 
assets) through complex transactions that may also hide the substance of a 
company’s financial position. We’ll start with the relatively easy ones.
Leasing transactions
If you rent your home, you don’t own it. If you own your home, it’s an asset, 
but any mortgage is a liability. Same with companies. A synthetic lease lets 
a company consider a purchase of property as a lease but gives it the tax 
advantages of ownership. An arm’s-length (unrelated) company technically 
owns the property, usually a financial institution that really doesn’t wish to 
bother operating it. Debt is used to finance the property, and the company 
has to pay it off. To be able to justify this off-balance-sheet accounting, the 
lease term has to be short — no more than seven years. If interest rates rise 
or values drop, the company can land into trouble. Sure, the lease is dis­
closed in a footnote, but few notice it (and if they did, even fewer can under­
stand it).
To illustrate, take a company that owns aircraft and finances the planes with 
debt. You would expect it to report an asset (the aircraft) and a liability (the 
debt). Under existing GAAP (in most jurisdictions, including Canada and the 
U.S.), a company that operates assets under a short-term operating lease 
reports neither the asset nor the liability. Imagine a balance sheet that shows 
an airline without any aircraft. Would you consider that to be a faithful rep­
resentation of the substance of the transaction? No, neither would we. As we 
write this book, accounting standards–setters continue to debate this matter.
Securitization transactions
A company that transfers certain assets (like loans or notes receivable) 
through a securitization transaction may be able to recognize the transaction 
as a sale of assets — removing the assets receivable from its balance sheet. 
Securitization refers to the process of aggregating similar financial instru­
ments, such as loans or mortgages, into a security to be sold on the open 
market. Companies do this to generate cash quicker and to improve their 
bottom line on the income statement.

201
 Chapter 14: Silly Balance-Sheet Tricks
Some securitizations are appropriately accounted for as sales. But many 
others continue to expose the transferring company to significant risks of 
devaluation still inherent in the transferred assets, which should not have 
been removed. Again, management’s judgment was allowed to come into 
play. But was it good judgment?
Commitments and contingencies
A contingent liability is one that is difficult to quantify, or one that may or may 
not come to pass. It’s a potential claim for which any liability depends on a 
future event or circumstance. Examples include outstanding lawsuits, special 
contract obligations, or debt covenants (terms and conditions that must be 
upheld).
	
When evaluating a bank stock, look under the management discussion and 
analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report for discussion about credit risk. 
In the footnotes, look for discussion about commitments, contingencies, and 
pledged assets. Determine roughly how big the potential impact can be if 
some of these commitments turn into reality.
Creation of unconsolidated or special-
purpose entities (SPEs)
Under GAAP, a company transferring assets and liabilities to a subsidiary 
company must consolidate that subsidiary in the parent company’s financial 
statements. However, in some cases, the transferor may be able to elude the 
requirement to consolidate.
A special-purpose entity (SPE) allows sponsor/originator companies bearing 
most of the SPE’s debt risk to keep that debt off the consolidated balance 
sheet under U.S. GAAP. In Canada and elsewhere, the rules are somewhat 
similar. The majority of SPEs in the world are perfectly legitimate, and some 
financing and tax benefits also exist. But keep in mind that the primary moti­
vation of having SPEs is often to achieve off-balance-sheet financing.
U.S. and Canadian accounting standards require companies to more clearly 
disclose their involvement with an SPE — including providing more informa­
tion about the nature and amount of the associated risks. This enhanced 
information must be included in the footnotes of a company’s annual report. 
Read those footnotes carefully if you ever see them. Run a what-if scenario 
to see what would happen if those liabilities came to life in the way that 
Frankenstein’s monster did.

202
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Pension Plans
Most public companies have pension plans for employees, and correspond­
ing obligations to adequately fund those plans. If any deficiency exists in the 
amount that’s contributed to the plan, the company ultimately has to fund 
the shortfall. Cash infusions would dig into the company’s cash balances and 
could potentially impair its ability to do the things it wants to.
During these tough economic times this is an important issue. Many compa­
nies still fail to adjust downward the assumptions underpinning their pension 
plans, such as the returns the plans would generate in upcoming years. Some 
pension plans are still based on assumptions that their investment funds will 
grow at a very strong pace, when in fact recent returns have remained closer 
to zero than anything else.
Accounting impact, too
In addition to a cash-flow impact, pension plans also provide an accounting 
impact. Pension-plan returns are determined for the company annually. If the 
actual gain on the plan is less than the predicted gains, GAAP requires that 
a loss be booked on the income statement. To get around reporting the loss, 
or the full extent of it, companies may pressure actuaries (they’re the guys 
that make even accountants look cool) to use favourable assumptions about 
returns, mortality rates, retirement dates, and so on in an effort to window-
dress the impact on the bottom line.
This type of accounting manipulation occurs for companies with defined-
benefit pension plans. A defined-benefit plan sets required retirement income 
for a future period, and the employer then funds the plan to ensure that 
the future pension obligation is met. Management often gets away with this 
because pension accounting is a nebulous task at best.
For investors, it’s very difficult to understand the intricacies of pension 
plans. But many analysts say that determining the exact impact on earn­
ings and evaluating how much cash will be spent to prop up ailing plans is 
nearly impossible anyway. Pension accounting is based on several estimates 
and forecasts, and many are not publicly disclosed. But the question has to 
remain in the back of your mind: How long will it be before the company has 
to pay the piper?
	
Keep in mind, however, that one bad year may not throw pension accounting 
out of kilter. Bad years tend to be offset with good years over the long term. 
But when you see four consecutive years of poor returns, problems can’t wait 
to arise.

203
 Chapter 14: Silly Balance-Sheet Tricks
Oh, and one more thing . . .
Shortfalls and asset returns aren’t the only areas of manipulation. Actuaries 
use discount rates to calculate the present value of future pension liabili­
ties. They’re intended to be based on long-term bond yields. In many cases, 
however, discount rates remain far too high and make liabilities look far too 
low. That implies that not only do some companies overestimate how much 
money their plans will generate, but they also probably underestimate their 
liabilities, too.
Tricks of the Trade: Other Things 
to Watch Out For
Companies make their balance sheets look better than they really are in 
other ways, too. Some companies cloud bad news; others twist accounting 
rules to suit their needs. Many companies use fancy business words that are 
accurate but that only one percent of the population really understands. In 
this section, we show you how they do all this.
Smoke and mirrors
	
When you read company financial statements, be alert to companies that put 
the spotlight in the annual report on only their great accomplishments. While 
they duly follow accounting rules and disclose the more nasty items — such 
as litigation against the company, or dependence on only a few customers — 
they bury this information behind the good news.
The smoke-and-mirrors ruse is also prevalent in press releases of quarterly 
financial results. The spin is almost always positive, despite the fact that the 
numbers may actually be saying otherwise. Audit committees and external 
auditors don’t currently vet press releases, so you, the stock investor, are on 
your own to dissect the press release for validity.
And materiality rabbits, too
Many accountants started out wanting to be magicians. When they saw that 
they couldn’t do tricks with cards, they went to bean-counting school. Their 
best trick was the ability to say that one plus one is equal to “anything you 
want it to be.” Even true magicians were impressed.

204
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
For you, the stock investor, accounting manipulation is not entertaining at all. 
It’s more akin to a bad horror show, really. Be careful when you hear the word 
materiality, a concept that many companies misuse. They may intentionally 
allow accounting errors to slip through within a defined percentage ceiling. 
This is actually justified in auditing speak if, and only if, the effect on profit is 
too small to matter to a reader of the financial statement.
When auditors question management about these violations of GAAP, they 
may answer dryly, “It doesn’t matter. It’s immaterial.” Sometimes, the audi­
tors will accept this. Materiality is based on considerable judgment. No clear-
cut line shows where it starts and where it ends. It requires consideration of 
the potential impact on a stock investor’s decision.
Buzzwords and other warning signs
Several phrases and buzzwords tend to strike fear into stock investors’ 
hearts. Going concern is one of those phrases, and it’s a biggie. Going concern 
reflects the idea that a company will continue to operate indefinitely and 
will not go out of business and liquidate its assets. This is the basis of most 
accounting rules. For example, you don’t book a receivable if the company 
is not likely to be around tomorrow. For the going-concern assumption to 
apply, the company must be able to generate or raise enough funds to stay in 
business. If auditors suspect a going-concern problem, they’re compelled to 
report it in an auditor’s report. If you see this, exit stage left!
Changing auditors is another thing you don’t want to see happen. Sure, there 
may be a very good and benign reason for this. But quite frequently, it’s 
because management and the auditor can’t agree on a significant account­
ing issue. If the auditor digs in, he may get fired. Alternately, if an auditor 
suspects management fraud and wishes to disassociate herself from the com­
pany, she can resign. Either way, it reflects poorly on management. Be very 
suspicious when this happens and don’t take the words of investor-relations 
people at face value.
A CEO pursuing “other interests” may be akin to a captain not wanting to stay 
behind on a sinking ship. CEOs perched high on their masts have clear views 
of the horizon. When they see that big tidal wave coming, they may call in the 
helicopter and put on their golden parachutes. Alternately, Captain Crook 
may have simply faced a mutiny and is walking the gangplank — at night, to 
save face. If he’s lucky, Jonah’s whale is lurking below to save him!
And footnotes, oh boring footnotes. But not to management! No siree, Bob. 
This is where management will bury much of the bad stuff. Footnotes are 
more effective than warm milk in putting you to sleep, or than raw onions in 
creating tears of boredom. But ignore these and you risk investment peril. 
And dealing with the bad stuff in footnotes can be more challenging than a

game of I Spy. Just ask the external auditors of Enron. Oops, we forgot, they 
ceased to exist after botching that audit. Enron did, after all, have some fancy 
footnotes.
Recent Canadian and U.S. GAAP changes brought about by regulators and 
accounting standards–setters have improved the transparency of financial 
statements and have remedied — but not totally prohibited — a handful 
of the creative accounting techniques discussed in this book. More devel­
opments in the world according to GAAP will further curtail manipulative 
accounting techniques. Tightening GAAP is good for stock investors, but it is 
not the only answer to this problem.
People still question the rigour of audits. Yet, is it possible that too much 
reliance is placed on the auditors to uncover fraudulent practices of creative 
accounting? After all, audits provide reasonable assurance, not guarantees, of 
problem-free accounts. So auditors ought to be considered watchdogs, and 
not bloodhounds, in the realm of validating financial reporting.
A clear need for cultural change in the analyst community exists as well. 
Earnings estimates should not be a focal point; nor should brokerage houses 
underwrite new issues of securities of companies they also provide analyst 
opinions on. Analysts should penalize those companies that rely on account­
ing trickery rather than fairness and full disclosure.

magine you’re boarding a cruise ship, ready to enjoy a hard-earned vaca­

and crew are charging out of the vessel, flailing their arms, and screaming 
at the top of their lungs — some are even jumping into the water below. So 
here’s a quiz: Would you get on that ship? You get double credit if you can 
also explain why (or why not). And what does this scenario have to do with 
stock investing, anyway? Well, plenty. The behaviour of the people who are 
in charge of the boat gives you important clues about the near-term pros­
pects for that boat. Similarly, the actions of company insiders can provide 
important clues about the near-term prospects for their company.
Company insiders are individuals who are key managers or investors in a 
company. Insiders may be the president of the company, the treasurer, or 
another managing officer. An insider can be someone who owns a large stake 
in the company, or someone on the board of directors. In any case, insiders 
usually have a bird’s-eye view of what’s going on with the company. They 
have a good idea of how well (or how poorly) the company is doing.
	
Keep tabs on what insiders are doing, because their buy/sell transactions have 
a strong correlation to the near-term movement of their company’s stock. 
However, don’t buy or sell stock only because you heard that some insider did 
it. Use the information about insider trading to confirm your own good sense 
in buying or selling stock. Insider trading can be a great precursor to a signifi­
cant move that you can profit from if you know what to look for. Many shrewd 
investors have made their profits (or have avoided losses) by tracking insider 
activity.

Tracking Insider Trading
Fortunately, we live in an age of disclosure. Insiders who buy or sell the 
stock of companies listed on a U.S. exchange must file reports that docu­
ment their trading activity with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), which then makes the documents available to the public. You can 
also access similar trading activity records filed with the Canadian Securities 
Administrators (CSA) for companies listed on a Canadian exchange.
U.S. insider trading information
You can view the public documents of companies listed on a U.S. exchange 
either at the SEC office or at the SEC Web site, which maintains the 
EDGAROnline database (www.freeedgar.com or www.edgar-online.
com). Just click on the Search Filings button. Some of the most useful docu­
ments you can view there include the following:
	
✓	Form 3: This form is the initial statement that insiders provide, and they 
must file it within ten days of obtaining insider status. Insiders file this 
report even if they haven’t made a purchase yet; the report establishes 
an insider’s status.
	
✓	Form 4: This is the document that shows an insider’s activity. For exam­
ple, Form 4 would include information about a change in the insider’s 
position as shareholder — how many shares the person has bought 
and sold, or other relevant changes. Any activity in a particular month 
must be reported on Form 4 by the tenth day of the following month. For 
example, if an insider sells stock during January, the SEC must get the 
report by February 10.
	
✓	Form 5: This annual report covers transactions that are small and not 
required to be reported on Form 4. Transactions may include minor, 
internal transfers of stock, or other transactions.
	
✓	Form 144: This form serves as an insider’s public declaration of his 
or her intention to sell restricted stock — stock that is received from 
the company as compensation, stock that is awarded, or stock that is 
bought as a term of employment. Insiders must hold restricted stock 
for at least one year before they can sell it. When insiders decide to 
sell, they file Form 144 and then must sell the stock within 90 days, or 
else they must submit a new Form 144. Insiders must file the form on or 
before the stock’s sale date. When a sale is finalized, insiders are then 
required to file Form 4.

 Chapter 15: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks
	
The SEC has enacted the short-swing profit rule to protect the investing public. 
This rule prevents insiders from quickly buying the same stock that they just 
sold at a profit. An insider must wait at least six months before buying the 
stock again. The SEC created this rule to prevent insiders from using their 
privileged knowledge to make an unfair profit while the investing public can’t 
react fast enough. The rule is also true if an insider sells stock. An insider can’t 
sell it at a higher price within a six-month period.
Canadian insider trading information
Canadian insider trading information isn’t presented in the same format as is 
U.S. insider trading activity. In the U.S., insiders complete forms. In Canada, 
we have just a listing, or table, of key insider trading information:
	
✓	Who traded shares?
	
✓	What was the person’s relationship to the company?
	
✓	How many shares were traded?
	
✓	At what price were the shares traded?
	
✓	What class of shares was traded?
	
✓	When did the trades occur?
	
✓	Where does the person reside?
You can access the public documents of companies listed on a Canadian 
exchange at the System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders (SEDI) Web site 
at www.sedi.ca. This site is maintained by the CSA.
Here’s how you can launch a query from the SEDI Web site:

Looking at Insider Transactions
The classic phrase “Actions speak louder than words” should have been 
coined for insider trading. Insiders are in the know, and keeping a watchful eye 
on their transactions — both buying and selling their company’s stock — can 
provide you with very useful investing information. Analyzing insider buying 
versus insider selling can be as different as night and day: Insider buying is 
simple, but insider selling can be complicated. In the following sections, we 
present both sides of insider trading.
Learning from insider buying
Insider buying is usually an unambiguous signal indicating how an insider 
feels about his or her company. After all, the primary reason why all inves­
tors buy stock is because they expect it to do well. If one insider is buying 
stock, it’s generally not a monumental event. But if several or more insiders 
are buying, those purchases should certainly catch your attention.
	
Insider buying is generally a positive omen and beneficial for the stock’s 
price. Also, when insiders buy stock, less stock is available to the public. If 
the investing public meets this decreased supply with increased demand, 
the stock price then rises. Keep these factors in mind when analyzing insider 
buying:

211
 Chapter 15: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks
	
✓	Identify who’s buying the stock. The CEO is buying 5,000 shares. Is that 
reason enough for you to jump in? Maybe. After all, the CEO certainly 
knows how well the company is doing. But what if that CEO is just 
starting her new position? What if before this purchase she had no 
stock in the company at all? Maybe the stock is part of her 
employment package.
	
	The fact that a new company executive is making her first stock pur­
chase isn’t as strong a signal urging you to buy as the fact that a long-
time CEO is doubling her holdings. Also, if large numbers of insiders 
are buying, that sends a stronger signal than if a single insider is 
buying.
	
✓	See how much is being bought. In the example in the previous bullet 
point, the CEO bought 5,000 shares, which is a lot of stock no matter 
how you count it. But is it enough buying for you to base an investment 
decision on? Maybe, but a closer look may reveal more. If she already 
owned 1 million shares at the time of the purchase, then buying 5,000 
additional shares wouldn’t be such an exciting indicator of a pending 
stock rise. In this case, 5,000 shares is a small incremental move and 
doesn’t offer much to get excited about.
	
	But what if this particular insider has owned only 5,000 shares for the 
past three years and is now buying 1 million shares? Now that should 
arouse your interest! Usually, a massive purchase tells you that a par­
ticular insider has strong feelings about the company’s prospects and, 
thus, she’s making a huge increase in her share of stock ownership. Still, 
a purchase of 1 million shares by the CEO isn’t as strong a signal as ten 
insiders buying 100,000 shares each would be. Again, if only one person 
is buying, it may or may not be a strong indication of an impending rise. 
However, if lots of people are buying, consider this activity to be a fan­
tastic indicator.
	
	An insider purchase of any kind is a positive sign. But it’s always more 
significant when a greater number of insiders are making purchases. 
“The more the merrier!” is a good rule for judging insider buying. All 
these individuals have their own unique perspectives on the company 
and its prospects for the foreseeable future.
	
✓	Notice the timing of the purchase. The timing of insider stock pur­
chases is important, as well. If we tell you that five insiders bought stock 
at various points last year, you may murmur, “Hmm . . .” But if we tell 
you that all five people bought substantial chunks of stock at the same 
time, and they did it right before earnings season, this should make you 
reply, “Hmmmmm!”

Picking up tips from insider selling
Insider buying either bodes well for the stock or is at worst a neutral event. 
Insider stock buying is rarely a negative event. But how about insider sell­
ing? When an insider sells stock, the event can either be neutral or negative. 
Insider selling is usually a little tougher to figure out because insiders may 
have many different motivations to sell stock that have nothing to do with 
the company’s future prospects. (Read on for a list of some common rea­
sons.) Just because the president of the company is selling 5,000 shares from 
his personal portfolio, it doesn’t necessarily mean you should sell, too.
Insiders may sell their stock for a couple of reasons: They may think that the 
company won’t be doing well in the near future — a negative sign for you — 
or they may simply need the money for a variety of personal reasons that 
have nothing to do with the company’s potential. Some typical reasons why 
insiders may sell stock include these:
	
✓	To diversify their holdings: If an insider’s portfolio is heavily weighted 
with one company’s stock, a financial adviser may suggest that he bal­
ance his portfolio by selling some of that company’s stock and then pur­
chasing other securities.
	
✓	To finance personal emergencies: Sometimes an insider needs money 
for medical, legal, or family reasons.
	
✓	To buy a home or to make another major purchase: An insider may 
need the money to make a down payment, or perhaps to buy something 
outright without having to take out a loan.
How do you go about investigating the details regarding insider stock selling? 
Although insiders must report their pertinent stock sales and purchases to 
regulators, the information isn’t always immediately revealing. As a general 
rule, consider the following questions when analyzing insider selling:
	
✓	How many insiders are selling? If only one insider is selling, that 
single transaction doesn’t give you enough information to act on. 
However, if many insiders are selling, view this as a red flag. Check 
out any news or information that is currently available. Web sites such 
as www.stockhouse.com, www.sec.gov, finance.yahoo.com, and 
finance.yahoo.ca can help you get that information (along with the 
other resources in Appendix B).
	
✓	Are the sales showing a pattern or unusual activity? If one insider sold 
some stock last month, that sale alone isn’t that significant an event. 
However, if ten insiders have each made multiple sales in the past few 
months, those sales are cause for concern. See whether any new devel­
opments at the company are potentially negative. If massive insider sell­
ing has recently occurred and you don’t know why, consider putting a 
stop-loss order on your stock immediately. (We cover stop-loss orders 
in Chapter 21.)

213
 Chapter 15: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks
	
✓	How much stock is being sold? If a CEO sells 5,000 shares of stock but 
still retains 100,000 shares, that’s not a big deal. But if the CEO sells all 
or most of his holdings, that’s a possible negative sign. Check to see 
whether other company executives have also sold stock.
	
✓	Do outside events or analyst reports seem coincidental with the sale 
of the stock? Sometimes, an influential analyst may issue a report warn­
ing about a company’s prospects. If the company’s management pooh-
poohs the report but most of them are bailing out anyway (selling their 
stock), you may want to do the same. Frequently, when insiders know 
that damaging information is forthcoming, they sell the stock before it 
takes a dip.
Similarly, if the company’s management issues positive public statements or 
reports that are contradictory to their own behaviour (they’re selling their 
stock holdings), the SEC may investigate to see whether the company is 
doing anything that may require issuing a penalty. The SEC regularly tracks 
insider sales.
Considering Corporate Stock Buybacks
When you read the financial pages or watch the financial shows on television, 
you sometimes hear that a company is buying its own stock. The announce­
ment may be something like, “SuperBucks Corp. has announced that it will 
spend $2 billion to buy back its own stock.” Why would a company do that, 
and what does that mean to you if you own the stock or are considering 
buying it?
When companies buy back their own stock, they’re generally indicating that 
they believe their stock is undervalued and that it has the potential to rise. If 
a company shows strong fundamentals (for example, a good financial condi­
tion and increasing sales and earnings) and it’s buying more of its own stock, 
it’s worth investigating — and may make a great addition to your portfolio.
	
Just because a company announces a stock buyback doesn’t always mean that 
one will happen. The announcement itself is meant to stir interest in the stock 
and cause the price to rise. The stock buyback may be only an opportunity 
for insiders to sell stock, or it may be needed for executive compensation — 
recruiting and retaining competent management is a positive use of money.
	
If you see that a company is buying back its stock while most of the insiders 
are selling their personal shares, that’s not a good sign. It may not necessarily 
be a bad sign, but it’s not a positive sign. Play it safe and invest elsewhere.
The following sections present some common reasons why a company may 
buy back its shares from investors as well as some ideas on the negative 
effects of stock buybacks.

214
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Boosting earnings per share
By simply buying back its own shares from shareholders, a company can 
increase its earnings per share (see Appendix A for more on earnings per 
share) without actually earning extra money. Sound like a magician’s trick? 
Well, it is, kind of. A corporate stock buyback is a financial sleight of hand 
that investors should be aware of. Here’s how it works: Noware Earnings Inc. 
(NEI) has 10 million shares outstanding, and it’s expected to net earnings of 
$10 million for the fourth quarter. NEI’s earnings per share (EPS) would be $1 
per share. So far, so good. But what happens if NEI buys 2 million of its own 
shares? The total of shares outstanding shrinks to 8 million. The new EPS 
becomes $1.25 — the stock buyback artificially boosts the earnings per share 
by 25 percent!
	
The important point to remember about stock buybacks is that actual com­
pany earnings don’t change — no fundamental changes occur in company 
management or operations — so the increase in EPS can be misleading if you 
are unaware of the buyback and its impact. But the marketplace can be obses­
sive about earnings, and, because earnings are the lifeblood of any company, 
an earnings boost — even if it’s cosmetic — can also boost the stock price.
If you watch a company’s price-to-earnings ratio (see Appendix A), you know 
that increased earnings usually mean an eventual increase in the stock price. 
Additionally, a stock buyback affects supply and demand. With less available 
stock in the market, demand necessarily sends the stock price upward.
	
Whenever a company makes a major purchase, such as buying back its own 
stock, think about how the company is paying for it and whether it seems like 
a good use of the company’s purchasing power. In general, companies buy 
their stock for the same reasons any investor buys stock — they believe the 
stock is a good investment and will appreciate in time. Companies generally 
pay for a stock buyback in one of two basic ways: funds from operations or 
borrowed money. Both methods have a downside. For more details, see the 
section “Exploring the downside of buybacks” in this chapter.
Beating back a takeover bid
Suppose you read in the financial pages that Company X is attempting a hos­
tile takeover of Company Z. A hostile takeover doesn’t mean that Company 
X sent storm troopers armed with mace to Company Z’s headquarters to 
trounce its management. All a hostile takeover means is that X wants to buy 
enough shares of Z’s stock to effectively control Z, and Z is unhappy about 
being owned or controlled by X. Because the buying and selling of stock is 
done in a public market or exchange, companies can buy each other’s stock. 
Sometimes the target company prefers not to be acquired, in which case 
it may buy back shares of its own stock to give it a measure of protection 
against unwanted moves by interested companies.

215
 Chapter 15: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks
Exploring the downside of buybacks
As beneficial as stock buybacks can be, they have to be paid for, and this 
expense has consequences. If a company pays for the stock with funds from 
operations, it may have a negative effect on the company’s ability to finance 
current and future operations. When a company uses funds from operations 
for the stock buyback, less money is available for other activities, such as 
upgrading technology or research and development. In general, any misuse 
of money affects a company’s ability to grow its sales and earnings — two 
measures that need to maintain upward mobility in order to keep stock 
prices rising.
A company faces great danger when it uses debt to finance a stock buyback. 
If the company uses borrowed funds, it has less borrowing power for other 
uses (such as upgrading technology or making other improvements). In addi­
tion, the company has to pay back the borrowed funds with costly interest, 
thus lowering earnings figures. In today’s tight capital markets, corporate 
debt attracts very high interest rates.
Stock Splits: Nothing to Go Bananas OverFrequently, management teams 
decide to do a stock split. A stock split is the exchange of existing shares of 
stock for new shares from the same company. Stock splits don’t increase or 
decrease the capitalization of the company. They just change the number of 
shares available in the market and the per-share price.
In a typical stock split, a company may announce that it will do a 2-for-1 split. 
For example, a company may have 10 million shares outstanding, with a 
market price of $40 each. In a 2-for-1 split, the company then has 20 million 
shares (the share total doubles), but the market price is adjusted to $20 (the 
share price is halved). Companies do other splits, such as a 3-for-2 or 4-for-1, 
but 2-for-1 is the most common split.
Why do companies split their stock? Usually, management believes the 
stock’s price is too high, thus possibly discouraging investors from pur­
chasing it. The stock split is a strategy to stir interest in the stock, and this 
increased interest frequently results in a rise in the stock’s price. In today’s 
stock market, stock splits are few and far between.
Qualifying for a stock split is similar to qualifying to receive a dividend — you 
must be listed as a shareholder as of the date of record. (For information on 
the date of record, see Chapter 6.)
	
A stock split is technically a neutral event because the ultimate market value 
of the company’s stock doesn’t change as a result of the split. The follow­
ing sections present the two most basic types of splits: ordinary and reverse 
stock splits.

216
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Ordinary stock splits
Ordinary stock splits — when the number of stock shares increases — are 
the ones we usually hear about. (For example, a 2-for-1 stock split doubles 
the number of shares.) If you own 100 shares of Dublin Inc. stock (at $60 per 
share) and the company announces a stock split, what happens? If you own 
the stock in certificate form, you receive in the mail a stock certificate for 
100 shares of Dublin Inc. Now, before you cheer over how your money just 
doubled, check the stock’s new price. Each share is adjusted to a $30 value. 
However, you now own 200 shares.
Not all stock is in certificate form. Stocks held in a brokerage account are 
recorded in book-entry form. Most stock, in fact, is in book-entry form. A 
company issues stock certificates only when necessary or when the investor 
requests it. If you keep the stock in your brokerage account, check with your 
broker for the new share total to make sure you’re credited with the new 
number of shares after the stock split.
	
A stock split is primarily a neutral event, so why does a company bother to 
do it? The most common reason is that management believes the stock is too 
expensive, so it wants to lower the stock price to make the stock more afford­
able and, therefore, more attractive to new investors. Studies have shown that 
stock splits frequently precede a rise in the stock price. Although stock splits 
are considered a non-event in and of themselves, many stock experts see them 
as bullish signals because of the interest they generate among the investing 
public.
Reverse stock splits
A reverse stock split usually occurs when a company’s management wants to 
raise the price of its stock. Just as ordinary splits can occur when manage­
ment believes the price is too expensive, a reverse stock split means the 
company feels the stock’s price is too cheap. If a stock’s price looks too low, 
this may discourage interest by individual or institutional investors (such as 
mutual funds). Management wants to drum up more interest in the stock for 
the benefit of shareholders (some of whom are probably insiders).
The company may also do a reverse split to decrease costs. When you have 
to send an annual report and other correspondence regularly to all the share­
holders, the mailings can get a little pricey, especially when you have lots of 
investors who have only a few shares each. A reverse split helps to consoli­
date the shares to lower overall management costs.

217
 Chapter 15: Looking at What the Insiders Do: Corporate Hijinks
A reverse split can best be explained with an example. TuCheep Inc. (TCI) is 
selling at $2 per share on the Nasdaq. At that rock-bottom price, the investing 
public may ignore the stock. So TCI announces a 10-for-1 reverse stock split. 
Now what? If an existing shareholder had 100 shares at $2 (the old shares), 
the shareholder now owns 10 shares at $20.
Technically, a reverse split is considered a neutral event. However, just as 
investors may infer positive expectations from an ordinary stock split, they 
may have negative expectations from a reverse split, because a reverse split 
tends to occur for negative reasons.
	
If, in the event of a reverse stock split, you have an odd number of shares, 
the company doesn’t produce a fractional share. Instead, you get a cheque 
for the cash equivalent. For example, if you have 51 shares and the company 
announces a 2-for-1 reverse split, the odds are they’ll give you 25 shares and a 
cash payout for the odd share (or fractional share).
	
Keep good records about your stock splits in case you need to calculate capi­
tal gains for tax purposes. (See Chapter 22 for tax information.)

In This Chapter
▶	Understanding how the board of directors controls risk
▶	Considering the impact of ethical lapses
▶	Watching a company’s reputation tank
▶	Facing technological risk
I
n this brief chapter, we consider a critical area that investors disregard 
at their peril — corporate “tone at the top.” In other words, as a stock 
investor, you have to keep an eye out for companies lacking strong board 
of director governance, or strong corporate management and accounting 
controls. You need to be wary of reported instances of corporate fraud, or 
suspected or confirmed “favours” stemming from conflicts of interest. All can 
lead to significant losses of cash and other assets — for both a company and 
its investors.
Another critical area we discuss in this chapter relates to privacy and piracy 
risks. A breach of privacy or an incidence of piracy may not be a company’s 
fault, but it may cause a serious exposure that can hurt the company’s core 
business. If you invest in a tax software company, for example, you definitely 
do not want to read about rampant piracy of its products. Even worse, you 
don’t want to find out that your online tax filing with the Canada Revenue 
Agency — and the loads of confidential information in it — can be inter­
cepted by a hacker on the Internet.
In this chapter, we show you that staying tuned to media reports, press 
releases, and auditor’s reports are important ways to get bad corporate 
behaviour and other risks on your investment radar screen. Ideally, you 
should evaluate these risks before you invest. You want to stay away from 
companies with poor track records in these very important areas.

Ruin at the Top: Corporate 
Governance Risk
Good corporate control starts at the top. If the control at the top is poor, you 
can bet dollars to donuts that a culture of poor controls will trickle down to 
other areas of the company. Poor corporate governance creates a pervasive 
risk that’s referred to as corporate governance risk. This risk area merits a 
close look from any stock investor. The recent meltdowns at Bear Stearns, 
Lehman Brothers, and Citigroup made those companies poster children for 
poor corporate governance, greed, and an array of other ills.
The role of the board of directors
To understand what represents good corporate governance, it helps to 
review the role of the board of directors (BOD) of a public company. The 
BOD is responsible to the shareholders for overseeing the management of 
the company and for the good stewardship and safekeeping of its assets. How 
does the BOD do this?
The BOD is responsible to set in place the company’s systems of internal 
control and to arrange for a review of their efficiency and effectiveness. 
Management control systems are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve corporate business objectives. These corporate 
objectives centre on efficient and effective operations, good reporting of 
results, and compliance to laws, regulations, and policies.
If Canada’s Potash Corporation wants to remain a low-cost provider of agri­
cultural fertilizer with fast delivery to international customers, it will set 
checks and balances to help it achieve this. These checks may include state-
of-the-art extraction facilities, precise reporting of production costs, and 
forward arrangements with customs brokers. Potash Corporation also has to 
comply with Saskatchewan’s health and safety laws to ensure its employees 
are safe in what can be a dangerous mining environment. For all companies, 
watch out for any poor press about high production costs or safety lapses. 
They aren’t the only indicators of a company’s tone at the top, but they are 
good ones.
How the BOD manages risks
A BOD reviews the efficiency and effectiveness of systems of management 
control through a process of analyzing corporate strategy; major projects, 

221
 Chapter 16: Five Minutes for Misconduct
investments, or divestments to be undertaken; and external- and internal-
audit work plans and resulting reports. Many BODs have delegated the 
oversight of risk to duly created sub-committees of the board, including risk-
management committees.
Senior management’s role in good 
governance: Rolling up the sleeves
The BOD manages risks through an oversight of corporate governance prac­
tices. It sets the tone. It ensures that all the management-control ducks are in 
a row. But the BOD does not make day-to-day decisions. Its members don’t 
really have to roll up their sleeves — that’s the job of senior management.
Because corporate governance is, by definition, a company’s strategic 
response to risk, that response is made through decision makers — senior 
management. You can tell if management promotes good basic corporate 
governance by spotting the following:
	
✓	Strategic planning: Does senior management — through press releases, 
shareholder meetings, or the annual report — demonstrate that it is 
developing strategic plans and objectives to fulfill the organization’s 
purpose? This purpose may include market leadership, customer-ser­
vice excellence, and similar high-level objectives.
	
✓	Leadership: Has management communicated, via the annual report or 
other communiqués, the organization’s purpose in a vision statement? If 
a company lacks vision and doesn’t know where it’s going on its journey, 
it’s like a rudderless ship. A vision statement evokes a strong image of 
the reality made possible by accomplishing the company’s mission. (A 
mission statement tells you why you are beginning a journey.)
	
✓	Organization design: Has management established a company structure 
that makes it run efficiently and effectively? This includes having the 
right number and location of plants, offices, and staff.
	
✓	Risk management: Does management demonstrate an awareness of its 
risks in its annual report? Is it putting assets at risk to achieve the orga­
nization’s objectives?
	
✓	Assurance: Does management provide feedback to shareholders on 
the efficiency and effectiveness of its governance and internal control 
processes? This includes publishing the external auditor’s management 
letter (on internal controls), even if the company doesn’t have to.

Management’s role in controlling risk
	
Before looking at other risks, we want to suggest that you not seek out com­
panies that eliminate risk altogether. Risk is an opportunity to companies, and 
companies take advantage of opportunities to make money. Each risk also 
has a different impact and likelihood, and each must be handled and viewed 
differently. The risk of a flood destroying a plant is remote, but the impact to 
operations is likely huge. So, transferring this risk to an insurance company is 
the way to go. The risk of fraud in a company that sells home security systems 
has to be avoided at all costs. Such a company will make sure that it screens 
employees, has good cash control, and has other checks and balances in place 
to avoid this risk to reputation as much as possible.
As a stock investor, the annual report you get includes a brief discussion of risks. 
This is likely to be found in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) 
section of the annual report. A good discussion of risks includes the steps taken 
to manage risks. How a company handles its risks will help you better assess 
whether you’ve invested in a high-risk company or one with fewer potential pot­
holes. Look for evidence (in the annual report or even by calling the company’s 
risk executive) of the following risk-management techniques:
	
✓	Avoiding risk: Does the company occasionally redesign business pro­
cesses or its physical infrastructure to avoid particular risks? For exam­
ple, did the last fire scare result in fire emergency training, new sprinkler 
systems, and so on?
	
✓	Diversifying risk exposure: Does management spread certain risks 
among numerous assets or processes to reduce the overall risk of loss 
or impairment? For example, is sensitive and important backup medical 
data kept in an off-site data storage facility?
	
✓	Controlling risky situations: Are activities designed to prevent, detect, 
or contain adverse events, or to promote positive outcomes? For 
instance, are employees who handle hazardous materials supported 
by proper prevention training, backup staff, and properly functioning 
equipment?
	
✓	Sharing risk: Does management share a portion of the risk through a 
contract with another party, such as an insurance company?
	
✓	Transferring risk: Has management distributed certain risks to another 
party through contract, such as outsourcing payroll duties or computer 
maintenance?
	
✓	Accepting some risks: Does management allow minor risks to exist to 
avoid spending more time and money on managing these risks than the 
potential damage warrants?

223
 Chapter 16: Five Minutes for Misconduct
	
When evaluating overall corporate governance risk, consider strategic risk — a 
risk that exists when bad business decisions are made, the implementation of 
decisions is poor, or a lack of responsiveness to industry changes is apparent. 
Make sure that when you invest in a company, you understand what it does, 
why it’s doing it, and how the company will get it done.
Back to the BOD
	
When looking for danger signs in a company’s board of directors that’ll make 
smart stock investors think twice, observe in the annual report or press 
releases whether the
	
✓	Board is large (difficult to reach decisions)
	
✓	Chairperson and chief executive are the same person (potential conflict 
of interest)
	
✓	Chief executive appoints outside directors (potential conflicts of interest)
	
✓	Outside directors are overly busy because they serve on many other 
boards (efforts spread too thin)
	
✓	Outside directors are over the age of 70 (stale view of company)
	
✓	Outside directors have business dealings with the company (potential 
conflicts of interest)
Misbehavin’: Ethical Risk
Several types of risk stem from failures in the ethical conduct of a company’s 
management or of other employees. Although good corporate governance at 
the BOD level helps to mitigate ethical problems, the risk of questionable or 
illegal acts is inherent in all companies.
Fraud
Fraud occurs when deception causes a monetary loss to a company. The lie 
may be a payroll clerk who creates a fictitious person on the payroll, and 
the monetary loss may be caused by the clerk impersonating that fictitious 
person to cash the fake employee’s payroll cheque. Fraud can also arise from 
an intentional misrepresentation to a company’s suppliers and customers. 
Examples of these fraud risks include theft, bid rigging, bribery, kickback 
schemes, and customer abuse (such as overbilling).

224
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
If the fraud is significant, you should be able to spot its existence in the notes 
to the financial statements dealing with litigation. If the fraud is material (seri­
ous dollars are involved), under Canadian securities law a company must also 
disclose it in a public filing with SEDAR (www.sedar.com; we discuss SEDAR 
in Chapter 6). The media will almost certainly jump on that story. Otherwise, 
fraud is usually an internal matter that’s seldom self-disclosed to the public 
because of the damage that can be caused to a company’s reputation. If a 
company doesn’t have to disclose something like this, it won’t. As an investor, 
just take a quick look at the litigation footnotes to see if any trend exists.
Conflict of interest
There may be instances of conflicts of interest where BOD members, manage­
ment, or employees personally benefit from their positions in the organiza­
tion. The allegations surrounding Hollinger Inc. and its founder and active 
board member Conrad Black — that Black and other senior executives 
received hundreds of millions of dollars in unauthorized payments — imme­
diately come to mind. Or imagine Manny the manager, who compels the com­
pany he works for to buy goods or services from another company that he 
has a financial interest in. Manny’s behaviour, if left unchecked, can lead him 
to even worse offences such as fraud.
In some cases of conflicts of interest — maybe even in a company you invest 
in — damages have to be paid, and the resultant negative publicity can harm 
a company’s reputation and share price. Again, it’s difficult to spot conflicts of 
interest because they are typically internal and very private matters. But if 
governance at the top is poor, invariably a trickle-down effect occurs through­
out the company. E-mail or phone your investor-relations contact to see if 
the company has a code of conduct that is communicated to all employees. 
Companies with policies about conflicts of interest have a lower risk of related 
fraud. As an investor, you may not be able to detect fraud that was already 
uncovered by the company. But you can see whether the company has 
policies in place to try to prevent fraud from happening in the first place!
A Bad Rep: Reputational Risk
Reputational risk is what you get when things go really wrong with corporate 
governance, management controls, and ethical breaches. Reputation is the 
corporate brand, and it’s an extremely important attribute for any company 
to protect and grow. Reputation is also more than just image. Image is the 
immediate perception of a company, but reputation is the stakeholders’ col­
lective social memory of the company and its activities. Negative publicity 
regarding a company’s business practices, whether true or not, will more 

225
 Chapter 16: Five Minutes for Misconduct
than likely cause the customer base to decline, costly lawsuits to be filed, 
and many other headaches to arise.
Any company that fails to deliver on the expectations of its stakeholders — share­
holders, customers, regulators, employees, and the larger community — risks 
experiencing a rapid drop in its share price. It’s vital that everyone employed 
by, or associated with, the company you invest in (such as a BOD member) acts 
with the highest level of integrity and professionalism in all that he or she does.
	
One way you can spot reputational risk rearing its head is by reading media 
stories about a company and then following up by checking the press releases 
the company issues in response. Is a negative article just a case of media 
sensationalism, or does the story ring true? In other situations, the negative 
impact of a bad corporate reputation just creeps up on a company, and before 
you know it, the stock is down 30 percent over the course of a year. You never 
knew that, one by one, customers started to exit stage left. The key here is to 
never underestimate the negative impact of reputational risk.
	
When a company’s reputation gets called into question by the court of public 
opinion, the punishment — a steep drop in share price — is much worse than 
the crime. An accused company is found guilty well before it has a chance to 
prove its innocence to shareholders.
Information and Technology Risks
With information technology comes great benefits. Operations speed up, and 
costs often go down. But technology can also present some risks.
Piracy
Many people are simply unaware that copying software without a valid 
licence is piracy and, therefore, against the law. By copying software at work, 
they’re putting their employers at risk for charges of software piracy. Coming 
under investigation for software piracy can seriously damage a business’s 
reputation, potentially causing a loss in market share due to poor customer 
perception.
Piracy of technology can also work the other way, where another company 
infringes on the patent owned by the company you invested in. You see a 
lot of this in the technology, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries. 
These are R&D-intensive industries, with lots of ideas floating around that are 
ripe for someone else to steal. One example of online piracy is called peer-to-
peer file sharing through something called “torrents.” File sharing in this way 

226
Part III: Picking the Winners 
is very commonplace and especially hurts companies in the audio, video, 
publishing, and other electronic data-intensive industries. Although torrents 
are illegal, they are rampant because they represent a free or low-cost way 
to get intellectual property. They are here to stay and are a clear and present 
danger to many companies. Be alert to piracy of all forms by scanning press 
releases.
Privacy
We can think of few things as destructive to the reputation of a company 
than the inadvertent release of confidential and sensitive information to a 
third party. We often hear stories about personal medical information being 
hacked and sold to interested parties. Sometimes, sensitive corporate infor­
mation even gets posted on a Web site or blog! A few years ago, a Microsoft 
employee began blogging (posting comments on a personal Web log, or blog) 
about some of the unfair practices he perceived to exist at the company. 
Microsoft was not thrilled, and a nasty legal battle ensued. The bottom line 
is that the e-business boom has created concerns about the security of per­
sonal information that’s collected and used over the Internet, making privacy 
risk management a corporate priority.
Businesses must protect the large amounts of personal information 
exchanged in the transactions that move business. Company stakeholders 
are concerned about how their information is used and secured, what con­
trols are in place to correct erroneous information, and with whom this infor­
mation will be shared. Such information can include a person’s name, contact 
information, age, occupation, salary, marital status, financial status, religious 
affiliation, nationality, credit card numbers, identity card numbers, medical 
records, and employment records. Can you imagine how you would feel if a 
company lost track of your personal records?
Any semblance of poor controls in this area means that customers may 
choose to do business elsewhere. Any failure by management to respond to 
privacy issues and risks can result in adverse consequences that range from 
loss of market to regulatory sanctions, loss of information flow, costly litiga­
tion, or damage to reputation.
	
As a stock investor, determine whether a corporate privacy policy exists.

privacy failures have occurred in the industry, and what are consumer protec­
tion groups and privacy advocates saying about the issues?

In This Chapter
▶	Selecting industries by asking a few important questions
▶	Keeping an eye on four major industries
S
uppose you have to bet your entire nest egg on a one-kilometre race. All 
you need to do is select a winning group. Your choices are the following:
Group A: Thoroughbred race horses
Group B: Overweight Elvis impersonators
Group C: Lethargic snails
This isn’t a trick question, and you have one minute to answer. Notice that 
we didn’t ask you to pick a single winner out of a giant mush of horses, Elvii, 
and snails; we only asked you to pick the winning group in the race. The obvi­
ous answer is the thoroughbred race horses (and no, they weren’t ridden by 
the overweight Elvis impersonators, because that would take away from the 
eloquent point being made). In this example, even the slowest member of 
group A easily outdistances the fastest member of either group B or C.
Industries, like groups A, B, and C in our example, aren’t equal, and life isn’t 
fair. After all, if life were fair, Elvis would be alive and the impersonators 
wouldn’t exist. Fortunately, picking stocks doesn’t have to be as difficult 
as picking a winning racehorse. The basic point is that it’s easier to pick 
a successful stock from a group of winners (a growing, vibrant industry). 
Understanding industries only enhances your stock-picking strategy.
A successful, long-term investor looks at the industry just as carefully as he 
looks at the individual stock. Luckily, choosing a winning industry to invest 
in is easier than choosing individual stocks, as you find out in this chapter. 
We know some investors who can pick a winning stock in a losing indus­
try, and we also know investors who’ve chosen a losing stock in a winning 
industry (the former is far outnumbered by the latter). Just think how well 
you do when you choose a great stock in a great industry! Of course, if you 
repeatedly choose bad stocks in bad industries, you may as well get out of 
the stock market altogether (maybe your calling is instead to be a celebrity 
impersonator!).

228
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Interrogating the Industries
Your common sense is an important tool in choosing industries with winning 
stocks. The following sections explore some of the most important questions 
to ask yourself when you’re choosing an industry.
	
Keep in mind that an industry isn’t the same as a sector. Even some market 
pros use the two words almost interchangeably. A sector is basically a “mega-
industry,” or a broader group of interrelated industries. For example, pharma­
ceuticals and cosmetic surgery are each an industry, but both are part of the 
larger healthcare sector. An industry is typically a category of business that 
performs a precise activity (such as manufacturing computer chips, or truck­
ing). Not all industries in a sector perform equally in the same market condi­
tions. See Chapter 18 for details on some interesting sectors.
Which category does the 
industry fall into?
Most industries can neatly be placed in one of two categories: cyclical and 
defensive. In a rough way, these categories generally translate into what soci­
ety wants and what it needs. Society buys what it wants when times are good 
and holds off when times are bad. It buys what it needs in both good and bad 
times. A want is a “like to have,” and a need is a “must have.” Kapish?
Cyclical industries
Cyclical industries are industries whose fortunes rise and fall with the econo­
my’s rise and fall. In other words, if the economy is doing well and the stock 
market is doing well, consumers and investors are confident and tend to 
spend and invest more money than usual, so cyclical industries tend to do 
well. Real estate, computer semiconductors, and automobiles are great exam­
ples of cyclical industries.
Your own situation offers some common-sense insight into the concept of 
cyclical industries. Think about your behaviour as a consumer and you get 
a revealing clue into the thinking of millions of consumers. When you (and 
millions of other Canadians) feel good about your career, your finances, and 
your future, you have a greater tendency to buy more (and more expensive) 
stuff. When people feel financially strong, they’re more apt to buy a new 
house or car or make some other large financial commitment. Also, people 
take on more debt because they feel confident they can pay it back. In light of 
this behaviour, what industries do you think would do well?

229
 Chapter 17: Analyzing Industries
The same point holds for business spending. When businesses think that eco­
nomic times are good and foresee continuing good times, they tend to spend 
more money on large purchases such as new equipment or technology. They 
think that when they’re doing well and are flush with financial success, it’s a 
good idea to reinvest that money in the business to increase future success.
Defensive industries
Defensive industries are industries that produce goods and services that are 
needed no matter what’s happening in the economy. Your common sense 
kicks in here, too. What do you buy even when times are tough? Think about 
what millions of people buy no matter how bad the economy gets. A good 
example is food — people still need to eat regardless of good or bad times. 
Other examples of defensive industries are utilities and healthcare.
	
In bad economic times, defensive stocks tend to do better than cyclical stocks. 
However, when times are good, cyclical stocks tend to do better than defen­
sive stocks. Defensive stocks don’t do as well in good times because people 
don’t eat twice as much or use up more electricity.
So how do defensive stocks grow? Their growth generally relies on two factors:
	
✓	Population growth: As more and more consumers are born, more 
people become available to buy essential goods and services.
	
✓	New markets: A company can grow by seeking out new groups of con­
sumers to buy its products and services. Coca-Cola, for example, found 
new markets in Asia during the 1990s. As communist regimes fell from 
power and more societies embraced a free market and consumer goods, 
the company sold more beverages, and its stock soared.
	
One way to invest in a particular industry is to take advantage of exchange-
traded funds (ETFs), which have become very popular in recent years. ETFs 
are structured much like mutual funds but are fixed portfolios that trade like 
a stock. If you find a winning industry but you can’t find a winning stock (or 
don’t want to bother with the necessary research), then ETFs are a great con­
sideration. You can find out more about ETFs at Globefund.com (go to www.
globefund.com and click the ETF Centre link).
Is the industry growing?
The question may seem obvious, but you still need to ask it before you pur­
chase stock. The saying “the trend is your friend” applies when choosing an 
industry in which to invest, as long as the trend is an upward one. If you look 
at three different stocks that are equal in every significant way but you find 

230
Part III: Picking the Winners 
that stock A is in an industry growing 15 percent per year while the other two 
stocks are in industries that have either little growth or are shrinking, 
which stock would you choose?
Sometimes the stock of a financially unsound or poorly run company goes up 
dramatically because the industry it’s in is very exciting to the public. The 
most obvious example is Internet stocks from 1998–2000. Stocks such as Pets.
com shot up to incredible heights because investors thought the Internet was 
the place to be. Sooner or later, however, the measure of a successful com­
pany is its ability to be profitable (Pets.com went bankrupt in 2000). Serious 
investors look at the company’s fundamentals (see Chapter 12 to find out 
how to do this) and the prospects for the industry’s growth before settling on 
a particular stock.
	
To judge how well an industry is doing, various information sources monitor 
all the major industries and measure their progress. The more reliable sources 
for industry information include the following:
	
✓	MarketWatch (www.marketwatch.com)
	
✓	Financial Post (www.financialpost.com)
	
✓	Report On Business (www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business)
	
✓	Standard & Poor’s (www.standardpoor.com)
	
✓	Hoover’s (www.hoovers.com)
	
✓	Yahoo! Finance (http://finance.yahoo.com)
	
✓	The Wall Street Journal (www.wsj.com)
The preceding sources generally give you in-depth information about the 
major industries. Visit their Web sites to read their current research and 
articles along with links to relevant sites for more details. For example, The 
Globe and Mail’s Report on Business site has an Industry News tab. Click it 
and you’ll see an Industry Sections area listing specific industries. Examples 
of specific industries are mining, agriculture, forest products, and energy, oil, 
and gas. These Web sites are updated daily, and publish indexes for all the 
major sectors and industries so that you can get a useful snapshot of how 
well an industry is doing.
	
Standard & Poor’s (S&P) Industry Survey is an especially excellent source 
of information on U.S. industries. Besides ranking and comparing industries 
and informing you about their current prospects, the survey also lists the top 
companies by size, sales, earnings, and other key information. We like that 
each industry is covered in a few pages, so you get the critical information you 
need without reading a novel.

231
 Chapter 17: Analyzing Industries
Are the industry’s products 
or services in demand?
Look at the products and services that an industry provides. Do they look 
like things society will continue to want? Are there products and services 
on the horizon that could replace them? Does the industry face a danger of 
potential obsolescence?
	
When evaluating future demand, look for a sunrise industry — one that’s new 
or emerging or has promising appeal for the future. Good examples of sun­
rise industries in recent years are green technology, alternative energy, and 
biotech and Internet companies. In contrast, a sunset industry is one that’s 
either declining or has little potential for growth. For example, you probably 
shouldn’t invest in the videocassette manufacturing industry as demand for 
DVDs and other alternatives increases. Owning stock in a strong, profitable 
company in a sunrise industry is often the most desirable choice.
Current research unveils the following megatrends:
	
✓	The aging of Canada: More senior citizens than ever before will be living 
in Canada. Because of this fact, financial and healthcare services will 
prosper.
	
✓	Advances in high technology: Internet, telecom, medical, and biotechnol­
ogy innovations will continue. Internet 2.0 refers to the buildout of — and 
massive investment in — an even more robust Internet infrastructure.
	
✓	Increasing need for basic materials: As society advances here and in 
the rest of the world, building blocks such as metals and other precious 
commodities will be in demand.
	
✓	Security concerns: Terrorism and other international tensions mean more 
attention for national defence, border security, and related matters.
	
✓	Energy challenges: Traditional and nontraditional sources of energy 
(solar, fuel cells, and so on) will demand society’s attention as it faces 
shrinking supplies of the world’s available cheap crude oil.
What does the industry’s growth rely on?
An industry doesn’t exist in a vacuum. External factors weigh heavily on its 
ability to survive and thrive. Does the industry rely on an established mega­
trend? Then it will probably be strong for a while. Does it rely on factors that 
are losing relevance? Then it may begin to decline soon. Technological and 
demographic changes are other factors that may contribute to an industry’s 
growth or fall.

232
Part III: Picking the Winners 
Perhaps the industry offers great new medical products for senior citizens. 
What are the prospects for growth? The greying of the population is an 
established megatrend. As millions of Canadians climb past age 50, profitable 
opportunities await companies that are prepared to cater to them.
Is the industry dependent 
on another industry?
	
This twist on the prior question is a reminder that industries frequently are 
intertwined and can become codependent. When one industry suffers, you 
may find it helpful to understand which industries will subsequently suffer. 
The reverse can also be true — when one industry is doing well, other indus­
tries may reap the benefits.
In either case, if the stock you choose is in an industry that’s highly depen­
dent on other industries, you should know about it. If you’re considering 
stocks of vacation-resort companies and you see the headlines blaring, 
“Airlines losing money as public stops flying,” what do you do? This type of 
question forces you to think logically and consider cause and effect. Logic 
and common sense are powerful tools that frequently trump all the number-
crunching activity performed by analysts.
What are the leading companies 
in the industry?
After you’ve chosen the industry, what types of companies do you want to 
invest in? You can choose from two basic types:
	
✓	Established leaders: These companies are considered industry leaders 
or have a large share of the market. Investing in these companies is the 
safer way to go; what better choice for novice investors than companies 
that have already proven themselves?
	
✓	Innovators: If the industry is hot and you want to be more aggressive 
in your approach, investigate companies that offer new products, pat­
ents, or technologies. These companies are probably smaller but have a 
greater potential for growth in a proven industry.

233
 Chapter 17: Analyzing Industries
Is the industry a target 
of government action?
You need to know if the government is targeting an industry, because inter­
vention by politicians and bureaucrats (rightly or wrongly) can have an 
impact on an industry’s economic situation. For example, would you invest 
in a tobacco company now that the government has issued all its regulations 
and warnings?
	
Investors need to take heed when political “noise” starts coming out about a 
particular industry. An industry can be hurt either by direct government inter­
vention or by the threat of it. Intervention can take the form of lawsuits, inves­
tigations, taxes, regulations, or sometimes an outright ban. In any case, being 
on the wrong end of government intervention is the greatest external threat to 
a company’s survival.
	
Sometimes, government action helps an industry. Generally, beneficial action 
takes two forms:
	
✓	Deregulation and/or tax decreases: Parliament sometimes reduces 
burdens on an industry. In May 1984, the Canadian federal government 
deregulated Canadian airlines, an action that caused a boom in travel for 
Canadians. The airline industry subsequently experienced tremendous 
growth because more people flew than ever before. This increase in the 
number of North American airline passengers spurred growth for the 
lodging and resort industries. Likewise, telecom deregulation in the mid-
1990s in Canada and the U.S. helped that industry to boom.
	
✓	Direct funding: Government has the power to steer taxpayer money toward 
business as well. In recent years, federal and provincial governments have 
provided tax credits and other incentives for alternative energy such as 
solar power. The government of Canada and many provincial governments 
also provide “efficient energy use” rebates and tax incentives for Canadians 
who, for example, switch to more efficient furnaces.
Outlining Key Industries
Not all industries go up and down in tandem. Indeed, at any given time, some 
industry is successful no matter what’s happening with the general economy. 
In fact, Canadian stock investors have made a lot of money simply by choos­
ing an industry that benefits from economic trends.
For example, the Canadian economy was in bad shape during the 1970s. 
It was a period of stagflation — low growth, high unemployment, and high 
inflation. This decade was the worst time for the economy since the Great 
Depression; most industries (and therefore most stocks) were having tough 

234
Part III: Picking the Winners 
times. But some industries did well — in fact, some flourished. Real estate 
and precious metals, for example, performed well in this environment. 
Because the inflation rate soared into double digits, inflationary hedges such 
as gold and silver did very well. During the ’70s, gold skyrocketed from $35 
an ounce to $850 an ounce over the course of the decade. Silver went from 
under $2 to over $50 in the same period. What do you think happened to 
stocks of gold and silver mining companies? That’s right — they skyrocketed 
as well. Gold stocks gave Canadian investors spectacular returns.
In the 1980s, the economy was rejuvenated when taxes were cut, regula­
tions were decreased, and inflation fell. Most industries did well, but even 
in a growing economy some industries struggle. Examples of industries that 
struggled during that time include precious metals and energy stocks.
Now fast forward to 2010. Think about the industries that have recently 
struggled and those that have performed well during the past few years. The 
stocks of many Canadian companies involved in energy, agriculture, and 
general commodities have done very well. In the same time frame, industries 
like airlines, housing, and U.S. financials (such as banks and brokerage firms) 
have had a very rough time. Choosing the right industries (or avoiding the 
wrong ones) has always been a major factor in successful stock picking.
In the following sections, we list some of the largest industries you can invest 
in and provide tips on how to tell when they’re doing well . . . and not so well. 
(To research these industries, use the resources mentioned earlier in this 
chapter, as well as those listed in Appendix B.)
Moving in: Real estate
We include real estate as a key industry because it’s a cyclical bellwether indus­
try — one that has a great effect on many other industries that may be depen­
dent on it. Real estate is looked at as a key component of economic health 
because so many other industries — including building materials, mortgages, 
household appliances, and contract labour services — are tied to it. A booming 
real estate industry bodes well for much of the Canadian economy.
Housing starts are one way to measure real estate activity. This data is an 
important leading indicator of health in the industry. Housing starts indicate 
new construction, which means more business for related industries.
	
Keep an eye on the Canadian and U.S. real estate industries for negative news 
that could be bearish for the economy and the stock market. Because real 
estate is purchased with mortgage money, investors and analysts watch the 
mortgage market for trouble signs such as rising delinquencies and foreclo­
sures. These statistics serve as a warning for general economic weakness.

235
 Chapter 17: Analyzing Industries
The North American real estate mania hit its zenith during 2006–07. A mania 
is typically the final (and craziest) part of a mature bull market. In a mania, 
the prices of the assets experiencing the bull market (such as stock or real 
estate) skyrocket to extreme levels, which entice more and more investors to 
jump in, causing prices to rise even further. It gets to the point where seem­
ingly everyone thinks that it’s easy to get rich by buying this particular asset, 
and almost no one notices that the market has become unsustainable. After 
prices are exhausted and start to level off, investor excitement dies down, 
and then investors try to exit by selling their holdings to realize some profit. 
As more and more sell off their holdings, demand decreases while supply 
increases. The mania dissipates and the bear market appears. This is defi­
nitely what happened to real estate in 2008–09, when the industry fell on hard 
times as the housing bubble popped.
Driving it home: Automotive
Cars are big-ticket items and are another barometer of people’s economic 
well-being — people buy new cars when they’re doing well financially. When 
sales of cars are up, it’s usually a positive indicator for the economy.
Conversely, trouble in the auto industry is a red flag for trouble in the gen­
eral economy. (Just ask GM, which both you and your taxpaying neighbours 
to the south now actually own part of!) One red flag is that an increase in 
auto repossessions and car loan delinquencies translates to a warning about 
general economic weakness. During 2007–09, some major difficulty definitely 
showed up in the auto industry as GM and Chrysler experienced financial 
troubles. (Ford was in better shape.) When the auto industry struggles, other 
industries tied to it also struggle. These include consumer credit and numer­
ous manufacturing subcategories that cater to the auto industry (such as 
base metals and electrical components).
Talking tech: Computers 
and related electronics
In recent years, technology stocks have become very popular with investors. 
Indeed, technology is a great sector, and its impact on the economy’s pres­
ent and future success can’t be underestimated. The share price of technol­
ogy companies can rise substantially because investors buy shares based 
on expectations — today’s untested, unproven companies may become the 
Googles and Apples of tomorrow.

236
Part III: Picking the Winners 
	
In spite of the sector’s potential, companies can still fail if customers don’t 
embrace their products. Even in technology stocks, you still must apply the 
rules and guidelines about financially successful companies that we discuss 
throughout this book. Pick the best in a growing industry and you’ll succeed 
over the long haul. But because technology still hasn’t recovered from its 
recent bear market, weakness in the industry means that investors need to be 
very picky and cautious.
Banking on it: Financials
Banking and financial services are an intrinsic part of any economy. Debt 
is the most telling sign of this industry for investors. If a company’s debt is 
growing faster than the economy, you need to watch how that debt impacts 
stocks and mutual funds. If debt gets out of control, it can be disastrous for 
the economy. As credit specialists point out, the amount of debt and debt-
related securities recently reached historic and troublesome levels. As this 
book goes to press, U.S. financial stocks have experienced a tough market as 
debt and defaults on debt (like subprime debt) have become headline news. 
(In Canada, our banks are in much better shape. Yet they have still suffered 
in the stock market, because recessions don’t treat banks very well, even the 
more solid ones.) Because this is a multi-trillion-dollar issue and it weighs 
heavily across the economic landscape, problems will persist well into the 
future. Canadian investors should remain wary and selective.

e’re thrilled to include this chapter in this 3rd edition of Stock I	
	
nvesting For Canadians For Dummies. Had you read this chapter in the 
previous edition and acted accordingly, you could have made a fortune (we 
kid you not). So we think it has earned an encore. A lot of this book is fun­
damentally about making your own decisions and doing your own research, 
but you know what — if we can save you some time and effort, why not? You 
can thank us later. Anyway, it’s time to make you privy to what our research 
tells us are unfolding megatrends that offer the greatest potential rewards 
(or risks) for stock investors. As usual, and as we indicate in Chapter 17, your 
stock investing actions must be tempered by existing industry conditions, 
which are in turn driven by the economy and other factors.
Moving forward, only a handful of changes in your portfolio over the past 
four decades would have made you tremendously rich. Had you put your 
money into natural resources (such as gold, silver, and oil) at the beginning 
of the 1970s and stayed put until the end of the decade, you would have 
made a fortune. Then, had you cashed in and switched to Japanese stocks in 
1980 and held them for the rest of the decade, you would have made another 
fortune. Then, had you switched in 1990 to U.S. stocks for the entire decade, 
you would have made yet another fortune. What if you had cashed in your 
stocks in 2000? Well, for starters, you would have avoided huge losses in the 
down bear market. How about being bullish? What looks like a strong bull 
market for this decade?

238
Part III: Picking the Winners 
By and large, the latter part of this decade and perhaps the beginning of the 
next one seems to parallel the ’70s. The general realm of natural resources, 
something Canada has in abundance, looks to be the primary bull market for 
this decade. Why? First, look at what this decade has in common with the ’70s:
	
✓	Problems with energy (rising costs, supply disruptions, and so on)
	
✓	Rising inflation (as the dollar, loonie, and other world currencies are 
increased in supply, something the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of 
Canada already did and will continue to do for a while)
	
✓	International conflict (Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, North Korea, and so on)
	
✓	Sluggish or recessionary Canadian and world economies
	
✓	Rising prices for essential natural resources (grains, metals, energy, 
lumber, and so on)
However, this decade has more to consider, including the following:
	
✓	Debt, debt, and more debt. Canada has increased its debt burden in 2009 
to the tune of over $800 billion dollars. The U.S. debt is $76 trillion as of 
July 2009, five times its gross domestic product (GDP) total of $15 tril­
lion. The U.S. is now the world’s largest debtor nation.
	
✓	The U.S. as a major importer (versus being an exporter in the ’70s)
	
✓	Canada as an export-dependent nation at a time when the U.S. and world 
economies are suffering, and not always buying what we’re selling
	
✓	China, Russia, Brazil, and India as major economic competitors (and 
consumers of resources)
	
✓	The threat of terrorism affecting North America within its borders
	
✓	$550+ trillion worth of derivatives (almost 20 times larger than the 
world’s total GDP)! Many of these derivatives, which are complicated 
investment vehicles, are nebulous and ultra-risky.
	
✓	Annual Canadian Old Age Security and universal healthcare costs in the 
tens of billions of dollars. Rising retirement and healthcare costs began 
in 2008 as the oldest baby boomers started to retire at age 62, and will 
escalate in 2011 and beyond as many turn 65.
This list isn’t comprehensive (due to space limitations). The preceding 
points are enough to make you understand that this investing environment 
has changed dramatically, and you need to refocus your overall game plan 
to keep your money growing. It also makes you want to race off to Gilligan’s 
island!

239
 Chapter 18: Emerging-Sector Opportunities
You’ll see two types of opportunities in this chapter: bullish and bearish. We 
think you would also benefit from reading Chapter 17 on industries — if we 
can’t help you find the winning stocks, then by golly we can at least show you 
what potential problem areas to stay away from.
Bullish Opportunities
Being bullish (or going “long”) is the natural inclination for most investors. 
It’s an easy concept — buy low, sell high. No rocket science there. The follow­
ing sections don’t identify every bullish opportunity, but they do cover the 
most obvious ones (at least to us).
	
In the examples in the following sections, we reference time frames of several 
years. Why? You would have seen these stocks dip by 10 or 20 percent or 
more over a given short time frame such as a few weeks or a few months. But 
investing wisely means that time ultimately will get the stock price to higher 
ground, especially if you ride the megatrends.
	
As you research this area for places to help your investments grow, let us 
just mention two words that should guide you along the way: human need. As 
long as most (or even all) of your portfolio is geared toward those goods and 
services the public will need no matter how good or bad the economy is, you 
should do well in the long run. Remember, not want, but need — it’s a safer 
bet in the coming years.
Commodities
Two countries that figure to have a mega-impact on the world in the near 
future are China and India. In the past ten years, these countries have put 
their economies on the fast track. Consider the following:
	
✓	They’ve generally turned away from socialism and a command economy 
and have turned to a free market or more capitalistic system.
	
✓	Industrialization, privatization, and profit incentives have ignited tre­
mendous booms in these countries.
	
✓	Both nations’ populations have continued to grow, with nearly 3 billion 
people combined.
What do these facts mean for stock investors? Somebody has to sell China 
and India what they need. China, for example, has a voracious appetite 
for natural resources like building materials, energy, copper, grain, and so 

240
Part III: Picking the Winners 
on. Canada is a treasure trove of these commodities. Companies that have 
provided these needed goods and services do very well. Take, for example, 
Agrium (AGU). You could have bought AGU in 2005 for about $20 per share. 
As of August 2009, AGU hit $40 for a nice gain of 100 percent (not including 
dividends). (In 2008 Agrium actually hit $100, but corrected after the start of 
the Great Recession. The key lesson here is that good stocks stay good even 
in recessions.) In that same time frame, the S&P 500 and TSX were up by only 
about 4 to 5 percent (basically flat for three years).
Of course, China and India are only a part of the world’s emerging markets, 
but they’re certainly the most important to North Americans (in terms of 
economic impact). They are indeed megatrends that will either help (or hurt) 
your portfolio. In the coming years, demand will likely continue to be strong, 
and investors will see the obvious positive implications for solid companies 
that meet this demand.
	
To find out more, check out the resources in Appendix A, such as Jim Rogers’s 
book entitled Hot Commodities. You can also conduct research at sites such 
as www.futuresource.com, or the commodities section of the National Post 
(www.nationalpost.com).
Oil and gas
As we write this, high-double-digit prices for oil and near $1-per-litre gas have 
become startling realities. Recent headlines suggest that the costs of energy 
are a major challenge for the Canadian and world economies. For decades, 
North American society has benefited from cheap oil, but global supply and 
demand (among other things) have caught up with us. A barrel of oil has 
gone from $67 in August 2005 to $85 only four years later. Gasoline has expe­
rienced a similar rise. Higher energy prices due to increased consumption are 
here to stay. If you’re going to pay more for energy, you may as well benefit.
As energy prices have risen strongly over the past few years, how have 
stocks fared? The general stock market (as represented by the Dow Jones 
Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index) didn’t do much from 2005 to mid-
2008. How about energy stocks? For an example, look at Suncor (SU), a major 
Canadian oil exploration company whose fortunes are certainly tied to the 
energy market. Here’s a company that you could have bought in late 2005 for 
about $20 per share. How has SU fared during this time frame? Despite pull­
ing back from a high of over $100 in 2007, its stock is at $42 as of August 2009 
for a solid gain of over 100 percent.
The bottom line is that Canadian stock investors will either have to consider 
energy in their investment strategies or risk having energy prices steamroll 
over their potential gains. Investment opportunities are plentiful in compa­
nies that provide, sell, distribute, or explore energy. But you may want to 
consider energy alternatives as well. Canada, the U.S., and the rest of the 

241
 Chapter 18: Emerging-Sector Opportunities
world will be forced to turn to alternative energy sources in the coming 
years. As conventional oil and gas become scarce, North Americans will look 
into gaining energy from sources such as wind, solar, fuel cell technologies, 
and Canada’s oil sands, among others. (See the next section for more about 
alternative energy.)
	
As you read this chapter, you may not be sure about what particular company 
you should invest in. If that’s the case, why not consider a convenient way to 
invest in an entire industry or sector? A good consideration is an exchange-
traded fund (ETF). Buying an ETF is like buying a whole portfolio of stocks as 
if it were a single stock. An example is an ETF with the symbol XLE. XLE has 
a cross-section of the largest public oil and gas companies, such as Exxon 
Mobil, Chevron, and others. To find out more about ETFs, go to the American 
Stock Exchange (www.amex.com) or Financial Post (www.financialpost.
com) for all the details.
Alternative energy
Because a traditional energy source like oil has its supply issues (oil’s days 
are numbered), it makes sense to anticipate what’s next on the horizon that 
can logically fulfill Canada’s energy needs. These changes must happen, and 
Canadian stock investors should benefit from what will be a historic shift into 
alternative energy. Alternative energy includes (but isn’t limited to) nuclear 
energy, solar, wind, fuel cell, geothermal, and ocean currents. You can now 
find many stocks and ETFs that are among the myriad choices for investors 
to gain exposure in a sector as it becomes more and more prominent in the 
coming months and years. Check out Appendix B for general resources to 
help you research this great sector.
Gold and other precious metals
Over the ages, gold has come to be synonymous with wealth. In modern 
times, gold has become known as an inflation hedge and investment insur­
ance, especially during times of inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. After 
being in a 20-year bear market (from its high of $850 in 1980 to its low of $252 
in 2000), gold is in a powerful bull market. Aggressive investors should be 
investigating Canadian and other gold stocks and ETFs. Why now?
According to many (if not most) gold market analysts, such as Bill Murphy 
of the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee (www.gata.org), as well as sites 
that specialize in the gold market, like www.lemetropolecafe.com, www.
gold-eagle.com, and www.kitco.com, the fundamentals for gold are 
more bullish than ever. In recent years, demand has begun to significantly 
exceed supply. The shortfall has been filled from gold sales by central banks. 
Because of continued and growing demand in Canada, the U.S., and abroad 

242
Part III: Picking the Winners 
(most notably Russia, India, and China), total worldwide annual demand is 
outstripping supply by anywhere from 1,000 to 2,000 tons (depending on 
whose estimates you believe). Juxtapose this demand with current economic 
conditions (such as the declining value of the dollar and other paper curren­
cies) and geopolitical instability, and you can see that gold and gold-related 
investments (such as quality gold stocks and ETFs) show bullish potential.
Because gold does well in an inflationary environment, understanding infla­
tion itself is important. Inflation isn’t the price of things going up; it’s the value 
of the currency going down. The reason it goes down in value is primarily 
because the government can print money at will (the money supply). When 
you significantly increase the money supply, you create a bullish environment 
for hard assets such as gold. (For more about inflation, see Chapter 10.)
Gold analysts such as Bill Murphy, Doug Casey, Jay Taylor, James Sinclair, 
and many others accurately forecast that the price of gold would hit four 
figures (it did in March 2008) and that the current environment sees gold 
zigzagging to new highs in the coming years. If that’s the case, Canadian and 
other gold-mining stocks and ETFs will perform fantastically well (not unlike 
their heyday in the late 1970s). For conservative investors, consider the 
large, established mining firms such as Newmont Mining (NEM), Barrick Gold 
(ABX), Goldcorp Inc (G), and Agnico-Eagle (AEM). For the more daring, con­
sider junior mining stocks. Do your research using the Web sites mentioned 
in this section.
	
As an additional note, the general precious metals market is strong and is a 
good consideration for solid gains because of the current inflationary environ­
ment. We think that silver and even uranium (for energy) offer Canadian inves­
tors good opportunities. To find out more, check out Precious Metals Investing 
For Dummies (Wiley).
Healthcare
We’re sure you’ve heard much about the “greying” of Canada. This phrase 
obviously represents a firm megatrend in place. For stock investors, this 
megatrend is a purely demographic play, and the numbers are with them. 
The number of Canadians over the age of 50, and especially those considered 
senior citizens, represents the fastest growing segment of Canadian soci­
ety. The same megatrend is in place in all corners of the world (especially 
Europe). As more and more people move into this category, the idea that 
companies that serve this segment will also prosper becomes a no-brainer. 
Well-managed companies that run nursing homes and eldercare services will 
see their stocks rise.

243
 Chapter 18: Emerging-Sector Opportunities
	
Be careful about which healthcare firms you select, because this sector 
includes stocks that are defensive and also some that are cyclical. Companies 
that sell expensive equipment (such as CAT scans or MRI technology) may not 
do that well in an economic downturn because hospitals and other healthcare 
facilities may not want to upgrade or replace their equipment. Therefore, 
healthcare companies that sell big-ticket items can be considered cyclical. On 
the other hand, businesses that sell necessary items like medicine and ban­
dages (such as pharmaceuticals and drug retailers) can be considered defen­
sive. People who need medicine (such as Aspirin or antacids) will buy it no 
matter how bad the economy is. In fact, people will probably buy even more 
Aspirin and antacids in bad economic times.
	
Also be wary of political trends as they affect healthcare. The U.S. may be 
slowly lurching toward socialized medicine. If this possibility develops, turn 
your bullish expectations into bearish ones. History (and experience) tells us 
that a government takeover of an industry like healthcare spells danger for 
investors (and patients, too).

main stocks by using the resources in Appendix B.
Defending the nation
The horrific events of September 11, 2001, remind the world how vulnerable 
we are as a free and open society. It has been a brave new world ever since. 
People watch their TV screens and listen to their radios to discover that ter­
rorism’s wretched tentacles reach across the globe. The most obvious way 
the country can respond is to increase security at home while deploying 
forces across the world to combat terrorists and tangle with the countries 
that support them. Foes of the U.S. and their allies aren’t singular nations 
that are easily defined, fought, and defeated within a few months or a few 
years. Instead, they’re implacable and virulent, and they’re spread out over 
many countries.
In addition to terrorism, geopolitical developments pose potential problems. 
Russia, China, and Iran are among the hot spots that will continue to chal­
lenge Americans and even Canadians economically as well as militarily.
	
As the U.S. continues to retool its military and seek ways to monitor, track, 
and attack terrorists, defence companies that sell certain products and ser­
vices will benefit. For publications that do a great job informing investors and 
speculators regarding the war economy, check out the U.S. & World Early 
Warning Report (www.chaostan.com).

A Bearish Outlook
Stocks are versatile in that you can make money even when they go down 
in value. Techniques range from using put options to going short, or doing a 
short sale of stock. (See Chapter 21 regarding going short, and find out more 
about put options at www.cboe.com.) For traditional investors, the more 
appropriate strategy is first and foremost to avoid or minimize losses. Making 
money betting that a stock will fall is closer to speculating than actual invest­
ing. So all we want is that investors see the pitfalls and act accordingly. The 
following sections offer cautionary alerts to keep you away from troubled 
areas in the economy (or find speculative opportunities to short stocks).
	
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) hit a high of 11,722 in January 2000 
and, after seven roller-coaster years, hit an all-time high of 14,164.53 on 
October 9, 2007. (As we write this, the DJIA is about 8,300.) As you can see, the 
general market since January 2000 has been mediocre. Although some stock 
groups have grown quite well, stocks in general have struggled, and some 
sectors have done rather poorly. Choosing the right sector is critical for your 
stock investing success going forward. That’s because the global economy is 
still in a mess.
Avoiding consumer discretionary sectors
	
When the economy is struggling or contracting and people are concerned 
about their financial situation, some sectors will undoubtedly suffer. If you 
have money tied up in stocks attached to companies in these sectors, you 
may suffer as well. In today’s economic environment, we would generally 
avoid sectors such as “consumer discretionary,” which refers to companies 
that sell products or services that people may want but usually don’t need. In 
other words, when consumers (both individuals and organizations) have to 
make hard choices on tighter budgets, the first areas of spending that will logi­
cally shrink are those goods and services that simply aren’t that necessary in 
people’s daily lives.
Here’s an example: In trying times, those who typically eat at fancy, expen­
sive restaurants will cut back. Maybe they’ll eat at fast food places or simply 
opt for good ol’ home cooking. Multiply this choice by millions of consum­
ers and you see that high-end restaurants (and their stocks, if they’re public 
companies) will see their fortunes sink. Your logic and common sense are 
very useful here.

245
 Chapter 18: Emerging-Sector Opportunities
A warning on real estate
	
In the second edition of this book, we warned you to stay away from housing 
because it became an enormous (and dangerous) bubble during 2002–06. It 
has since sunk into its own depression in the U.S., and into the doldrums in 
Canada. Although buying opportunities are plenty and sellers are having a 
difficult time, our warning on housing and the general real estate market (of 
course, all stocks associated with this sector) is still on. Be very cautious here 
and wait for a rebound. “But,” you may ask, “isn’t the worst over? Isn’t 2009 
the bottom?” Possibly, but just understand that more credit problems still 
hang over the market.
Some recent industry data indicate that during 2007, one out of every seven 
American homes purchased was underwater as of mid-2009. In other words, 
one out of every seven homeowners has a mortgage more valuable than the 
property purchased! Yikes! That means that some homebuyer out there has, 
say, a $250,000 mortgage on a property that has seen its market price decline 
to less than $250,000. How many homeowners will keep paying a mortgage 
that’s worth more than the property itself, especially if times are tough and 
people are struggling or have lost a job?
In Canada, the problem is less pronounced. For one thing, Canadians cannot 
just walk away from a mortgage like Americans can because Canadian law 
says the mortgage debt follows the owner of the house, not just the house. 
Yet, markets such as Toronto, Calgary, and Vancouver have certainly seen 
price declines recently.
	
The fortunes of the U.S. housing market can affect you as a stock investor if 
you’ve chosen stocks that are impacted by the U.S. real estate industry.
In addition, think about mortgage resets, a U.S. housing market phenomenon. 
What does that mean? During the middle of this decade (2004–07), many 
people purchased property with adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). These 
ARMs typically had an introductory period with a low fixed monthly payment 
during the first few years and then were adjusted higher afterward. Many 
folks got into ARMs with the expectation that real estate would continue 
rising and that they’d be able to handle the new (higher) monthly payments 
later. These ARMs became ticking time bombs. Many of them hit unprepared 
homeowners and forced quick sales, which made real estate prices drop as 
sales outnumbered purchases and the U.S. inventory of available homes for 
sale ballooned to record levels. And the ARMs aren’t finished — many more 
are due to be adjusted during 2009–11.
	
You can see that the real estate industry, with the ARMs issues and record levels 
of defaults and foreclosures, will need more time to heal and get back on a growth 
path. For Canadian stock investors, the point is obvious. Stocks related to real 
estate such as homebuilders, property developers, construction firms, and mort­
gage companies are too speculative at this point. Wait until the coast is clear.

The great credit monster
Too much debt means that someone will get hurt. The unprecedented explo­
sion in debt may, especially in the U.S., have given the North American econ­
omy a huge boost in the late 1990s, but debt now poses great dangers for 
the rest of this decade. This massive debt problem is obviously tied to real 
estate. However, it goes much further. Individuals, companies, and govern­
ment agencies are carrying too much debt for comfort. It’s not just mortgage 
debt; it’s also consumer, business, government, and margin debt. With total 
debt now in the vicinity of more than $45 trillion, saying that a lot of this debt 
won’t be repaid is probably a safe bet. Individual and institutional defaults 
will rock the economy and the financial markets. Bankruptcy is (and will con­
tinue to be) a huge issue.
Debt will (and does) weigh heavily on stocks, either directly or indirectly. 
Because every type of debt is now at record levels, no one is truly immune. 
Say you have a retail stock of a company that has no debt whatsoever. Are you 
immune? Not really, because consumer debt (credit cards, personal loans, and 
so on) is at an all-time high. If consumer spending declines, the retailer’s sales 
go down, its profits shrink, and ultimately, its stock goes down.
Exposure to debt is quite pervasive. Check your RRSP, your bond funds, and 
your RRIF status. Why? Remember those mortgages we talk about earlier 
in this chapter? Banks and mortgage companies issued trillions of dollars’ 
worth of those mortgages in recent years, but after the mortgages were 
issued, they were sold to other financial institutions, even a few Canadian 
banks. The lion’s share of mortgages was sold to the most obvious buyers, 
the U.S. Federal National Mortgage Association (FNM) and the U.S. Federal 
Mortgage Assurance Corporation (FRE). These giant, American government-
sponsored entities are usually referred to as “Fannie Mae” and “Freddie Mac.” 
They were taken over in 2008 by the federal government because of gross 
mismanagement and overindebtedness (in the trillions!). Hmm . . . there goes 
that alarmist robot with the flailing arms again.
In Canada, we did not have risky ARM banking products to peddle. Yet, the 
world’s problems became our problems, and our own national debt levels 
have soared as a result. For example, the federal government had to support 
its own significant auto and other manufacturing sectors, and also wanted to 
create employment by building more infrastructure like roads and bridges. 

247
 Chapter 18: Emerging-Sector Opportunities
That cost money — and lots of it. To execute this plan the Canadian govern­
ment recently announced a $22 billion stimulus package — with an attendant 
deficit of $50 billion, just for 2009. For 2009, the national debt cracked $500 
billion. The cost of servicing this debt is about 30 percent of all government 
spending. That’s why debt matters!
	
What’s a stock investor to do?
	
✓	Well, remember that first commandment to avoid or minimize losses? 
Make sure you review your portfolio and sell stocks that may get pulver­
ized by the credit monster. That includes many U.S. banks and any bro­
kerage firm.
	
✓	Make sure the companies themselves have no debt, low debt, or at least 
manageable debt. (Check their financial reports; see Chapter 12 for more 
details.)
	
✓	For the venturesome, seek shorting opportunities in those companies 
most exposed to the dangers of debt. (For more information on shorting, 
go to Chapter 21.)
Cyclical stocks
Another type of stock that we think you should be cautious about is cyclical 
stocks. Heavy equipment, automobiles, and technology tend to be cyclical 
and are very susceptible to downturns in the general economy. Conversely, 
cyclical stocks do very well when the economy is growing or on an upswing 
(hence the label).
As individuals and corporations get squeezed with more debt and less dis­
posable income, hard choices need to be made. Ultimately, the result is that 
people buy fewer big-ticket items. That means a company selling those items 
ends up selling less and earning less profit. This loss of profit, in turn, makes 
that company’s stock go down.
Firms that experience lagging sales often turn to aggressive discounting. 
Recently, General Motors Corporation (GM) and Ford Motor Company (F) 
offered employee discount sales to the public. Both companies have been 
experiencing plunging sales and profits and ballooning debt in recent years. 
Unfortunately, that was a token gesture at best. Both companies filed for 
bankruptcy in 2009.
In a struggling recessionary economy, investing in cyclical stocks is like 
sunbathing on an anthill and using jam instead of sunblock — not a pretty 
picture.

Geographic regions: Stalled 
economic engines
One interesting way to look at stock investing opportunities is through a geo­
graphic lens. Perhaps you wish to throw your support behind an emerging 
nation that you believe will soon thrive economically, and proceed to invest 
in the stock of a company that operates in that country. If everything works 
out well, you’ll find your investment success to be rewarding from a financial 
perspective. However, emerging nations have not escaped the claws of the 
recent and generally worldwide recession. As a result, we urge you to invest 
cautiously in companies that operate in these countries. However, after the 
world economy recovers, stock investors would do well to know a bit more 
about the more promising nations we discuss in this section.
China
If you recently bought a household product and checked to see where it 
was manufactured, you very likely saw a “Made in China” label. China is in 
the news a lot more often than it used to be, and today’s news about China 
has more to do with the economy and business, and less to do with political 
unrest and corruption. Yup, China is a waking giant that is touching the lives 
of all Canadians in one way or another.
China’s stock market is now the third biggest in Asia, and China’s now a 
member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), a powerful group of coun­
tries with lots of economic and political clout. To add to China’s attractive­
ness as a stock investing destination, government policies have become 
much friendlier to investors than they were only a few years ago. Scandals 
and rural political unrest still abound, but this time the government is being 
a bit less heavy-handed in its efforts to minimize it. A lot of risk still exists in 
China, so for now just keep an eye on it. At best, we recommend only small 
nibbles of conservative and better known Chinese stocks.
India
Stock investors who set their sights on India may find some undervalued 
businesses that have seen the market value of their shares plummet after the 
global recession. India deserves consideration because it is still experienc­
ing a positive transformation in its business and financial markets. In fact, 
India is currently the fourth largest economy in terms of purchasing power. 
It’s also the ninth most industrialized country in the world, and it continues 
to have a progressive economy. This progress is thanks in the most part to 
smart political and economic reforms undertaken in the ’90s.
	
As we implied with China, only a small fraction of your portfolio should be 
considered for investment in Indian stocks. But even a small investment tar­
geted in the right area can produce big returns.

Latin America
Latin America is a group of countries that includes Mexico, Chile, Brazil, 
Argentina, and Venezuela. Although we speak of them as a group here, you 
must view each country’s business, economic, and political climate sepa­
rately. This distinction should be made because as a group, and over the last 
few decades, Latin America’s macroeconomic performance has been subpar. 
There’s a track record of slow responses to economic and political crises.
Since a couple of decades ago, this region has been touted as a great growth 
market for North American companies because of the availability of cheap 
labour and a hunger for consumer goods. However, this potential has never 
been fulfilled in a significant way. Argentina is still struggling with an eco­
nomic slowdown, Mexico devalued its currency over a decade ago, Brazil has 
a socialist president who is leery of foreign investment and still has loads of 
debt, and Venezuela has an ultra-nationalistic leader at its helm.
How shares trade in China
Publicly traded Chinese companies can list 
their shares on certain global equity markets 
in addition to, or instead of, being listed on the 
major Chinese stock exchanges (Shanghai and 
Shenzhen). Also, some companies are listed on 
only one of the mainland Chinese exchanges. 
Almost anything goes with regard to how and 
where Chinese shares may be listed.
Four types of shares are listed in China:
	✓	State shares are held on behalf of the 
Chinese state and are prohibited from being 
traded on an open equity market.
	✓	Legal-person shares (also known as “C” 
shares) are shares of a company owned 
by another company or institution with a 
legal-person status. The foreign trading of 
legal-person shares is also prohibited.
	✓	Individual shares (also known as “A” 
shares) can be traded and owned only by 
Chinese citizens, and they are traded only 
in China’s domestic markets.
	✓	Foreign-capital shares (known as “B” 
shares, or overseas-listed shares) can 
be traded by Canadians and others who 
are foreign to the Chinese mainland. “B” 
shares are traded in the stock exchanges of 
mainland China. Many Chinese companies 
issue both A shares and B shares.
Another class of shares, called “H” shares, is 
listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. These 
Chinese company shares are sometimes also 
listed as ADRs on U.S. stock exchanges. An 
ADR (American depository receipt) is a nego­
tiable certificate issued by a U.S. bank that rep­
resents a specific number of shares (or a single 
share) in a foreign stock that’s traded on a U.S. 
exchange. ADRs are expressed only in U.S. dol­
lars, and a U.S. financial institution operating in 
Hong Kong holds the underlying security. (ADRs 
are also available for other nations foreign to 
the U.S.) ADRs serve to reduce the administra­
tive costs that would otherwise accumulate on 
each transaction.
By the way, in Hong Kong, the best stocks are 
referred to as “red chips.” For Chinese people, 
the colour red exemplifies good fortune!

Important Considerations 
for Bulls and Bears
We don’t presume that stocks go straight up or that they zigzag upward 
indefinitely. Your due diligence is necessary for your success. Make sure that 
you’re investing appropriately for your situation. If you’re 35, heading into 
your peak earning years, want to ride a home-run stock, and understand the 
risks, then go ahead and speculate with that small-cap gold-mining stock or 
the solar power technology junior stock.
But if you’re more risk averse or your situation is screaming out loud for you 
to be conservative, then don’t speculate. Go instead with a more diversified 
portfolio of large-cap stocks or get the ETF for that particular sector. And 
don’t forget the trailing stop-loss strategy (see Chapter 21). ’Nuff said.
For those people who want to make money by going short in those sectors 
that look bearish, again take a deep breath and remember what’s appropri­
ate. Conservative investors simply avoid the risky areas. Aggressive inves­
tors or speculators may want to deploy profitable bearish strategies (with a 
portion of their investable funds). Here are some highlights for all of you.
Conservative and bullish
Being conservative and bullish is proper when you’re in (or near) retirement, 
have a family to support, or live in a very large shoe with so many kids that 
you don’t know what to do. After you choose a promising sector, just select 
large-cap companies that are financially strong, are generating cash and prof­
its, have low debt, and are market leaders. This entire book shows you how 
to do just that.
Bombay Stock Exchange
The Bombay Stock Exchange is about 125 
years old, and it’s Asia’s largest exchange. The 
Sensex 30 is India’s best-known stock market 
index. Think of it as the Indian equivalent to the 
Dow Jones Industrial Average, or an S&P/TSX 
index.

251
 Chapter 18: Emerging-Sector Opportunities
	
However, you may not like the idea of buying stocks directly. In that case, con­
sider either sector mutual funds or ETFs. That way you can choose the indus­
try and effectively buy a basket of the top stocks in that area. ETFs have been 
a hot item lately, and we think they’re a great choice for most investors 
because they offer some huge advantages over mutual funds. For example, 
you can put stop-loss orders on them or borrow against them in your stock 
portfolio. Check with your financial adviser to see whether ETFs are appropri­
ate for you.
Aggressive and bullish
If you’re aggressive and bullish, you want to buy stocks directly. For real 
growth potential, look at mid caps or small caps. Remember that you’re 
speculating, so you understand the downside risk but are willing to tolerate 
it because the upside potential can reward you so handsomely. Few things in 
the investment world give you a better gain than a supercharged stock in a 
hot sector.
Conservative and bearish
	
For many (if not most) investors, making money on a falling market isn’t gen­
erally a good idea. Doing so takes a lot of expertise and risk tolerance. Really, 
for conservative investors, the key word is safety. Analyze your portfolio with 
an adviser you trust and sell the potentially troubled stocks. If you’re not 
sure what to do on a particular stock, then (at the very least) put in stop-loss 
orders and make them GTC (good-till-cancelled; see Chapter 21 for details). 
As odd as it sounds, sometimes losing less than others makes you come out 
ahead if you play it right.
For example, look at the bear market that hit North American markets in the 
mid-1970s. In 1974–75, the stock market fell 45 percent. Stocks didn’t recover 
until 1982. If you had a stock that was at $100, it would have fallen to $55 and not 
returned to $100 until seven or eight years later. Whew! Sometimes just burying 
your money in the backyard sounds like genius. What if you had a stop-loss at 
$90? You would have gotten out with a minimal loss and could have reinvested 
the money elsewhere (such as in bonds or CDs) and looked much brighter than 
your neighbour feverishly digging for money in his backyard.
Aggressive and bearish
Being aggressive in a bearish market isn’t for the faint of heart. However, this 
is where the quickest fortunes have been made by some of history’s greatest

investors. Going short can make you great money when the market is bear­
ish, but it can sink you if you’re wrong. We rarely tell our clients and students 
to short a stock, because it can backfire. Yes, ways to go short with less risk 
are out there, but we prefer to buy put options.
	
Put options are a way to make money with limited risk when you essentially 
make a bet that an investment (such as stocks) will go down. Obviously, 
options go beyond the scope of this book, but at least let us give you some 
direction, because an appropriate options strategy exists for most stock port­
folios. You can find great (free) tutorials on using options at Web sites such 
as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) and the Options 
Industry Council (www.888options.com).

uccessful stock investing is more than choosing a 
particular stock — it’s also how you go about doing 
it. Successful investors go beyond merely picking good 
stocks and watching the financial news. They implement 
trading techniques and investment strategies that help 
them either minimize losses or maximize gains (hopefully 
both). The chapters in this part introduce some of the 
most effective investing techniques and describe some 
smart ways to hold onto more of your profits when tax

Y
ou may have heard about stock trading and wondered how it com­
pares to stock investing. Rest assured that trading and investing are 
two different animals. Trading can be advantageous when you’re looking to 
profit from short-term swings in the market due to volatility. During our still 
unpredictable economic times, trading in and out of stocks over shorter time 
frames may be very appropriate. However, trading can be dangerous because 
the market’s short-term movements can be quite pronounced. If you think 
the market will go up in the short term, and it goes down instead, you can 
lose loads of cash in one fell swoop.
The only reason we’re including trading in this book is because you, dear 
reader, should get some do’s and don’ts in this short-term venture. If you’re 
going to trade stocks, you should have some guidelines to keep the downside 
to a minimum. We explain what you need to know in this chapter.
The Differences between 
Investing and Trading
Stock investing and stock trading may sound similar, but they’re actually 
pretty different:
	
✓	Investing looks primarily at fundamentals (earnings, sales, industry out­
look, and so on), which tend to be long-term drivers of stock prices. The 
long-term investor waits out the zigzags as long as the bullish outlook

256
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
and the general uptrend are intact. The good part is that investing 
involves fewer transaction costs. The bad part is that sometimes the 
stock can correct (go down temporarily) or have periods of flat perfor­
mance, which the long-term Canadian investor has to patiently tolerate.
	
✓	In trading, much more activity takes place during a range of a few days, 
weeks, or months. Traders may dump losers immediately and cash out 
winners to lock in some profit before the next dip in price. Trading can 
mean more costs due to frequent commissions and short-term taxable 
gains. For trading, the fundamentals are either not a factor or at best a 
secondary or minor factor because short-term movements in a stock 
price are more geared to momentum and sentiment, which is reflected 
in the data found in charts along with price and volume statistics.
The following sections give you the full scoop on the differences between 
investing and trading.
The time factor
When we first started investing in stocks, it was easy to delineate what was 
short term, intermediate term, and long term:
	
✓	Short term was less than one year.
	
✓	Intermediate term was usually one to three years or one to five years, 
depending on your personal outlook.
	
✓	Long term was beyond that time frame.
In recent years, however, investors have become very impatient. For some 
investors, short term is now measured in days, intermediate term in weeks, 
and long term in months. In the old days, investors were akin to cooks using 
the crock pot; today, they use the microwave. But these people are actually 
traders, not investors. If an investment does well, they sell it immediately and 
move on to (hopefully) another profitable investment. If the investment is 
down, they sell it immediately and move on to (hopefully) greener pastures 
elsewhere.
	
There’s no such thing as a three-month investment when it comes to stocks. 
Stocks require time for the marketplace to discover them. Sometimes great 
stocks see their prices move very little because the market (again, millions of 
individual and institutional investors) hasn’t noticed them yet. In trading, on 
the other hand, you jump in and out relatively quickly. Typical trades occur 
over the span of a few days or a few weeks. Of course, if a position you take 
on grows more profitable and your expectations are positive, you can stay in 
longer. But many experienced traders won’t tempt fate and stay in too long; a 
reversal of fortune can always occur, so don’t be shy about cashing out and 
taking a profit.

257
 Chapter 19: Choosing between Investing and Trading
The psychology factor
In investing, you can be very analytical. You can look at a stock and its fun­
damentals and then at the prospects for the stock’s industry and the general 
economy, and you can make a good choice knowing that you’re not worried 
about the price going up or down a few percentage points in the next few 
days or weeks. If you’ve done your homework, your stock will eventually go 
up and do well over the long haul.
Trading is different. Trading involves looking at stocks that have the ability 
to move quickly, regardless of the direction. The reason is that seasoned 
traders want to make money quickly and capitalize on crowd psychology. It 
matters little whether investors are bidding up or down; the trader is primar­
ily looking for a stock with momentum.
Checking out an example
The stock investor takes the long view and stays patient and focused. As we 
try to stress throughout this book, investing should be measured in years, 
and the stock’s fundamentals (a company’s profits, sales, industry, and so on) 
are the foundation. A patient and successful investor holds on as the stock 
zigzags upward. When the inevitable correction occurs, a successful inves­
tor either just waits it out or takes that moment as a buying opportunity and 
adds shares to her holdings. In a bullish (up) outlook, the investor expects 
the stock to generally trend upward. If the investor expects a stock to have a 
downward path, then obviously she simply avoids it.
The stock trader sees things differently. The trader may indeed be just as 
bullish on a particular stock but also bet on the occasional pullback or cor­
rection that’s typical of most stocks. The trader may buy 100 shares of a 
stock and keep it as a core holding, but also make different bets on its price 
movement.
For an example, take a look at the chart in Figure 19-1. This is a chart of Zig 
Zag Corporation (ZZC), and it’s helpful in showing you how investing and 
trading behave differently during the same time frame.
An investor would have bought ZZC stock in 2007 and held on. As long as 
the fundamentals don’t change, the investor just “buys right and sits tight.” 
Although some traders may smirk at such a simple strategy, it’s a time-tested 
approach. Look at billionaire Warren Buffett for a great example of this. He 
has been known to hold stocks for decades. Many investors (and traders, 
too) envy his extraordinary success, but relatively few try to emulate it. 
Patience and discipline aren’t always popular or fashionable in investing, but 
a patient, disciplined approach has generally proven to be superior to many 

258
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
trading systems that tell you to jump in and jump out. However, because 
markets have been more volatile this last decade than in almost all previous 
decades, trading cannot be dismissed as a viable approach to make money 
on stocks.
Going back to Figure 19-1, how would successful traders have performed with 
ZZC? The trader may start off as an investor and make that initial investment 
in the stock. As time passes, the trader would be watching technical indica­
tors to time an entry or exit point. A technical indicator is a result of a math­
ematical calculation based on prices and the volume of trading, typically 
displayed as a chart. (See the “Technical analysis” section in this chapter.)
Stock traders typically use options (such as calls and puts) because they’re 
cheap and can provide a magnified move with the underlying stock. In other 
words, options are a form of leverage, meaning that the price swing can be 
greater (up or down) than the move in the underlying stock. If a stock moves 
up 10 percent, then an option (in this case a call option) could go up 20 per­
cent or more. Of course, if the stock goes down 10 percent, then that same 
option could easily go down 20 percent or more.

 Chapter 19: Choosing between Investing and Trading
What are call and put options?
	
✓	A call option is a bet that a particular stock (or exchange-traded fund) 
will go up during the life of the option.
	
✓	A put option is a bet that a particular stock (or exchange-traded fund) 
will go down during the life of the option.
	
Think of the following (very rough) rule of thumb:
	
✓	If the stock goes up 10 percent, a call option on that stock could go up 
20 percent. Of course, a put option on that same stock would lose 20 
percent (or more).
	
✓	If the stock goes down 10 percent, a call option could go down 20 per­
cent. Of course, a put option on that same stock would gain 20 percent 
(or more).
	
✓	If the stock stays flat or neutral, both the call and put options would 
start to lose value because options have a finite life and can potentially 
be worthless by the time they expire.
Referring back to Figure 19-1, the Canadian stock trader may have seen his 
stock rise during October and November 2007 from about $55 per share to 
$70. Technical indicators may have flashed that the stock is overbought. 
Some traders would have cashed in and sat with the cash, waiting for the 
next opportunity. Other traders would have kept the stock but cashed in any 
call options that were purchased before that time frame for a nice profit. The 
money from cashing out the sale of the call options would sit waiting for the 
next entry point. Perhaps the trader would then use the money to purchase 
put options, betting that a correction was soon due. Then you see the huge 
move up by ZZC starting at about $55 in December 2007 and hitting $115 
in October 2008 before correcting in a zigzag fashion down to about $73 in 
January 2009.
Had the trader employed both calls and puts, he would have had plenty of 
opportunities for profit. During the summer of 2008, the call options would 
have been profitable and could have been cashed out. In that scenario, a call 
option could easily reward the astute trader with triple-percentage gains. 
Of course, the puts in the same time frame would have greatly lost value. 
Heading into the September 2008–January 2009 period, the bearish strategies 
would have paid off because put options would rise in value as the underly­
ing asset (in this case the stock of ZZC) declined.
As you can see, the successful trader must diligently monitor his positions 
and frequently enter more than one position on the same stock to try to 
capitalize on the stock’s movements. Whenever you take opposing positions 
on the same security, you’re doing a form of hedging. Hedging takes into 
consideration the idea that the market can easily go against you, which is an 
especially likely scenario if the market is volatile. In that case, why not profit 
from the move?

260
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
	
Keep in mind that any profits are offset by any losses from options that lose 
value (or expire worthless) and by transaction costs.
	
Scores of books have been written about options, so we won’t go into great 
detail here. But to get familiar with options — especially if short-term specu­
lating or trading greatly interests you — start with Stock Options For Dummies 
by Alan R. Simon and Trading Options For Dummies by George A. Fontanills, 
both published by Wiley.
Tools of the Canadian Trader
As you can judge from the example we provide earlier in this chapter, suc­
cessful trading requires lots of diligent attention. Because stocks can go all 
over the place, the Canadian trader uses various tools to determine entry 
and exit points. We cover some of those tools and strategies in the following 
sections.
Technical analysis
The most common tool of short-term speculators and traders is technical 
analysis. Technical analysis looks at the recent price movements and volume 
of trading for particular securities and commodities. The price movements 
are depicted on charts, so “charting a security” is a common practice among 
those who use technical analysis.
The technical analyst uses some useful short-term indicators, including
	
✓	Moving averages to gauge the general trend for a particular stock. 
Typical moving averages are the 10-day, 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day 
averages. Stocks that stay above these averages tend to be bullish, while 
stocks that keep falling below these averages tend to be bearish.
	
✓	Relative strength indicators (RSI) to see if a stock is considered over­
sold or overbought. A technical analyst sees an oversold stock as a 
buying opportunity and an overbought stock as a selling opportunity.
	
Technical analysis is a complex topic, and we just can’t do it justice in this 
solitary chapter. We don’t mean to shortchange it, as it’s worthy of study for 
serious traders. We mention it here because traders should be aware of it, 
regardless of how extensively they use it. We strongly recommend that seri­
ous traders do some extensive research on the topic. Consider starting your 
research with Technical Analysis For Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley).

261
 Chapter 19: Choosing between Investing and Trading
	
As most longtime readers probably know by now, we’re not ardent fans of 
technical analysis. Don’t get us wrong; we respect it as a short-term trading 
tool. It can be remarkably useful over a period of a few weeks or months. 
However, it’s not that useful for long-term investing. Yes, you can use it to 
maximize an entry or exit point, but over the long haul, a company’s funda­
mentals are the primary drivers of the stock’s price. When you look at the pan­
theon of consistently successful investors in history, it’s no accident that most 
of them use fundamental analysis and are into some form of value investing.
Brokerage orders
Because trading in the market’s short-term gyrations can be a fast-moving 
activity, it pays to get proficient with brokerage orders and trading triggers 
to help you manage your trading portfolio and take advantage of the market’s 
swift moves.
The moment after a diligent trader buys a stock or an option, she’ll enter 
her next order very quickly — often even before the stock has made a major 
move. For example, if she buys a stock for $50 at 10 a.m. on a weekday morn­
ing, she may enter a stop-loss order at, say, $45 at 11 a.m. and simultaneously 
put in a sell order at $60. That way she can limit the loss to $5 per share and 
maybe catch a $10 profit on the upside. These moves are possible now due to 
the sophisticated technology that most brokers have on their Web sites.
That’s just an example of what you can do with brokerage orders. Find out 
more about brokerage orders and trade triggers in Chapter 21.
Advisory services
	
You don’t have to go it alone with your trading strategies — the world is filled 
with advisory services, newsletters, and Web sites that cater to the art and 
science of short-term trading. Some notable ones that we respect include 
Elliott Wave International (www.elliottwave.com) and Stock Trading 
Canada (www.stocktradingcanada.ca). A monthly publication that covers 
the realm of trading is Stock, Futures and Options magazine (www.sfomag.
com). Of course, you can do your own diligent research at the library and on 
the Internet (check Appendix B for resources).

262
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
The Basic Rules of Trading
If you’re going to trade, adhere to some golden rules to help you maximize 
your success (or at least minimize potential losses):
	
✓	Don’t commit all your cash at once: In a fast-moving market, opportuni­
ties come up all the time. Try to keep some cash on hand to take advan­
tage of those opportunities.
	
✓	Have a plan: Try to have predetermined points at which you cut losses 
or take profits.
	
✓	Taking profits is not a sin: Sometimes, a bird in the hand is worth two in 
the bush. Markets can reverse fairly quickly. If you have a stock position 
sitting there with a fat profit, it can’t hurt to take the profit. This gives 
you cash for the next opportunity.
	
✓	Discover hedging techniques: Just because you’re bullish doesn’t mean 
that you can’t also put on a bearish position. Hedging techniques pro­
tect you when the market moves against you.
	
✓	Find out which events move markets: Research the Canadian market 
and discover what types of events tend to move it (either up or down). 
Do the same for foreign stock markets, especially the U.S. stock market. 
Serious short-term traders keep one eye on their positions and the other 
on what’s going on in the world. Keep informed by regularly reading 
financial publications and Web sites (see Appendix B for resources).
	
✓	Check the stock’s trading history: Charts and related data tell you how 
a particular stock has moved in recent weeks, months, and years. Do 
you see any seasonality or reliable patterns that may help you judge 
future movements?
	
✓	Use stop-loss and limit orders: Using trade orders is an integral part of 
the trader’s overall strategy. Find out more in Chapter 21.
	
✓	Use discipline and patience versus emotion and panic: Part of the 
human equation in the world of financial markets is that fear and greed 
can become an irrational, short-term driver of prices. Instead of joining 
the crowd, watch them to give you an advantage in assessing a stock’s 
price movements. Stick with your plan and use discipline and patience.
	
✓	Minimize transaction costs: Keep in mind that because trading is typi­
cally active and short term, transaction costs are significant. Active 
trading can mean lots of brokerage commissions, even in this age of 
Internet-based brokerage firms. Therefore, traders should shop around 
for brokerage firms that charge low commissions for those who trade 
frequently ($9.99 per trade is typical for Canadian discount brokerages, 
which you can check out in Appendix B).

263
 Chapter 19: Choosing between Investing and Trading
	
✓	Understand the beta of a stock: The volatility of a stock is an impor­
tant consideration for traders. The more volatile a stock is, the greater 
its ups and downs are. Therefore, traders should regularly check the 
stock’s beta. Beta is a statistical measure of how volatile a particular 
stock is relative to a market standard (such as the S&P 500 index).
	
	How is it measured? The S&P 500 (for example) is given a beta of 1. A 
stock with a beta of 2 is considered twice as volatile as the index. In other 
words, if the index falls by 10 percent, the stock in question has the poten­
tial of falling by 20 percent. A stock with a beta of 0.5 is considered to be 
half as volatile as the index. In other words, if the index falls by 10 per­
cent, that low-beta stock would be expected to fall only 5 percent.
	
	Traders looking for fast (and hopefully profitable) movement look for 
high-beta opportunities. A stock’s beta can be found on various financial 
Web sites (see resources in Appendix B).
	
✓	Read and learn from top traders: Last (but not least), learn from the 
great ones out there, such as the legendary Jesse Livermore. You can 
read all about his trading exploits in the book Reminiscences of a Stock 
Operator by Edwin Lefevre (Wiley).
	
Because trading can be very risky, you need to know as much as you can. 
Don’t use your rent money or retirement money, and for crying out loud, don’t 
break open your kid’s piggy bank. Trading should be done only with risk capi­
tal (money that, if lost, doesn’t hurt your lifestyle). And don’t forget the advice 
from the immortal Will Rogers: “Don’t gamble; take all your savings and buy 
some good stock and hold it till it goes up, then sell it. If it don’t go up, don’t 
buy it.”

tocks are a means to an end. What end are you seeking? Look at stocks 
as tools for wealth building. Sometimes they’re great tools, and some­
times they’re awful. The results you get depend on your approach. Some 
stocks are appropriate for a conservative approach; others are more suitable 
for an aggressive approach. Sometimes stocks aren’t a good idea at all. Golly! 
A stock investing book that suggests that stocks aren’t always the answer! 
That’s like a teenager saying, “Dad, I respectfully decline your generous offer 
of money for my weekend trip, and I’d be glad to mow the lawn.”
In this chapter, we help you select a stock-investing strategy based on your 
personal circumstances and the amount of money you have to invest. We 
also provide tips on when to sell your stocks.
Laying Out Your Plans
A senior citizen in one of our investment seminars wanted to be more aggres­
sive with his portfolio, and his broker was more than happy to cater to his 
desire for growth stocks. Of course, stocks got clobbered in the volatile bear 
market of 2000–02, and yes, he did lose lots of money. However, we soon dis­
covered that even after the losses, he still had a substantial stock portfolio 
valued at over $1 million. He had more than enough to ensure a comfortable 
retirement. He sought aggressive growth even though it was really unneces­
sary for his situation. If anything, the aggressive strategy could have put his 
portfolio (and hence his retirement) in jeopardy.

Part IV: Investment Strategies 
	
Growth is desirable even in your twilight years because inflation can eat away at 
a fixed-income portfolio. But different rates of growth exist, and the type you 
choose should be commensurate with your unique situation and financial 
needs. Notice that we say “needs,” not “wants.” These perspectives are entirely 
different. You may want to invest in aggressive stocks regardless of their suit­
ability (after all, it’s your money), but your financial situation may dictate that 
you need to take another approach. Just understand the difference.
Stocks can play a role in all sorts of investment strategies, but in this chapter 
we discuss only a few well-known approaches. Keep in mind that your stock-
investing strategy can change based on the major changes in your life and the 
lifestyle that you lead, such as the ones we present in the following sections.
Living the bachelor life: Young single 
with no dependants
If you’re young (age 20–40) and single, with no children or other dependants, 
being more aggressive with your stock selection is fine (as long as you don’t 
use your rent money for investments). The reasoning is that if you do make 
riskier choices and they backfire, individuals dependent on you won’t get 
hurt. In addition, if you’re in this category you can usually bounce back a lot 
easier over the long term even if you have financial challenges or if a bear 
(down) market hits your stocks.
	
Consider a mix of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks in growth industries 
(see Chapter 1 for an explanation of small cap, mid cap, and large cap; we 
provide information on industries in Chapter 17). Invest some of your money 
in five to seven stocks and the remainder in growth-stock mutual funds. You 
can revise your investment allocations along the way as the general economy 
and/or your personal situation changes (like when you finally say “I do” to the 
love of your life).
Going together like a horse and carriage: 
Married with children
Married couples with children must follow a more conservative investing 
strategy, regardless of whether one spouse works or both spouses work. 
Children change the picture drastically (believe us; we each have them — 
and the baggy eyes to prove it). You need more stable growth in your portfo­
lio (and unbreakable furniture in your home).

267
 Chapter 20: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
	
Consider a mix of large-cap growth stocks and dividend-paying defensive 
stocks. (See Chapter 9 for more on defensive stocks.) Invest some of your 
money in five to seven stocks and the remainder in growth and income mutual 
funds. Of course, you can tweak your allocations along the way according to 
changes in the general economic conditions or your personal situation. 
Consider setting aside money for postsecondary education in a growth-ori­
ented mutual fund and in other vehicles such as savings bonds (as early as 
possible).
Getting ready for retirement: Over 40 
and either single or married
Whether you’re over 40 and single or over 40 and married — and if married, 
whether one or both of you work — start to slowly convert your portfolio 
from aggressive growth to conservative growth. Shift more of your money 
out of individual stocks and into less-volatile investments such as balanced 
funds, Canada Savings Bonds, and GICs.
Devote some time and effort (with a financial planner if necessary) to calcu­
lating what your potential financial needs will be at retirement time. This step 
is critical in helping you decide what age to target for financial independence. 
(What’s that? I can stop working?! Yee-ha!)
	
Consider five to seven large-cap stocks that are predominantly dividend-
paying defensive stocks in stable and needed industries (such as utilities, food 
and beverage, and so on). Put some of your investment money in balanced 
mutual funds. Don’t invest all your money — keep about 10 to 15 percent of 
it in something very secure, such as short term Canada Savings Bonds and 
bank vehicles (savings accounts and GICs). Keep savings in at least two sepa­
rate institutions if possible to be diversified in today’s uncertain economy. 
Remember that you can revise your allocations in the future as necessary.
Kicking back in the hammock: 
Already retired
If you’re retired, you’re probably in your 60s or older. Safe, reliable income 
and wealth preservation form the crux of your investment strategy. Some 
growth-oriented investments are okay as long as they’re conservative and 
don’t jeopardize your need for income. At one time, financial planners told 
their retired clients to replace growth-oriented investments with safe income-
oriented investments. However, times have changed as senior citizens live 
longer than ever before.

268
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
	
Issues such as longevity and inflation (steadily increasing costs of living) mean 
that today’s (and tomorrow’s) retirees need growth in their portfolios. To be 
safe, make sure that 5–20 percent of your retirement portfolio has some 
growth-oriented securities such as stocks to make sure you continue meeting 
your financial needs as the years pass. Perform an annual review to see 
whether the stock allocation needs to be adjusted.
	
Consider a mix of large-cap stocks dominated by dividend-paying defensive 
stocks in stable industries. Spread your money over three to six stocks, bal­
anced mutual funds, and short-term investment-grade bond funds. Have a 
portion of your money in savings bonds and bank investments. You need to 
monitor and tweak your investment portfolio along the way to account for 
changes in either the general economic environment or your lifestyle needs.
Allocating Your Assets
Asset allocation is really an attempt to properly implement the concept of 
diversification — the key to safety and stability. Diversification is the inclusion 
in your portfolio of different (and frequently offsetting) investments to shield 
your wealth from most types of current risk while planning for future growth. 
To achieve proper diversification, you need to analyze your entire portfolio 
to look for glaring weaknesses or vulnerable areas. We don’t discuss your 
total investment plan here — only the stock portion.
Canadian investors frequently believe that having different stocks in differ­
ent industries constitutes proper diversification. Well . . . not quite. Stocks 
in closely related industries tend to be affected (in differing degrees) by the 
same economic events, government policies, and so on. It’s best to invest 
in stocks across different sectors. A sector is essentially a group of related 
industries; water, gas, and electric services are industries, but together they 
(plus a few other industries) make up the utilities sector. For more on analyz­
ing industries to pick winning stocks, see Chapter 17.
Earlier in this chapter we talk about some basics for investing depending 
on your lifestyle, but how do you know how much you need to invest to 
meet your financial goals? In the following sections, we present some typical 
amounts most typical investors can (and should) devote to stock investing.
Investors with less than $10,000
If you have $10,000 or less to allocate to stocks, you may want to consider a 
mutual fund rather than individual stocks because that sum of money may 
not be enough to properly diversify. But if you’re going to invest a sum that 
small, consider allocating it equally into two to four stocks in two different 
sectors that look strong for the foreseeable future. For small investors, con­
sider sectors that are defensive in nature (such as food and utilities).

269
 Chapter 20: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
	
Because $10,000 or less is a small sum in the world of stock investing, you may 
have to purchase in odd lots. (Odd lots usually mean 99 shares or fewer. A 
block of 100 shares is considered a round lot, and 200 shares would be consid­
ered two round lots.) Say you’re buying four stocks, and all of them are priced 
at $50 per share. Obviously, your $10,000 won’t buy you 100 shares of each. 
You may have to consider investing $2,500 in each stock, which means that 
you end up buying only 50 shares of each stock (not including commissions).
	
Try to avoid the temptation of getting into initial public offerings (IPOs; see 
Chapter 8), penny stocks, and other speculative issues. Participation in them 
may cost little (stock prices are often under $10 per share and can be under $1), 
but the risk exposure is too high for inexperienced investors. If you can’t buy 
100 shares of a large-cap stock, consider buying fewer shares, because com­
missions are still relatively low. In general, it’s safer to buy 50 shares of a large, 
established company than the same amount in a smaller, riskier company.
Investors with $10,000 to $50,000
If you have between $10,000 and $50,000 to invest, you have more breath­
ing space for diversification. Consider buying four to six stocks in two or 
three different sectors. If you’re the cautious type, defensive stocks will do. 
For growth investors, seek the industries in those sectors that have proven 
growth. This approach gets you off to a good start, and the section “Knowing 
When to Sell” in this chapter can help you maintain your portfolio by chang­
ing your strategy when necessary.
	
Does diversification mean that you shouldn’t, under any circumstances, 
have all your stocks in one sector? It depends on you. For example, if you’ve 
worked all your life in a particular field and you’re knowledgeable and com­
fortable with the sector, having a greater exposure is okay because your 
greater personal expertise offsets the risk. If you worked in retail for 20 years 
and know the industry inside and out, you probably know more about the 
good, the bad, and the ugly of the retail sector than most Bay Street analysts. 
Use your insight for more profitability. You still shouldn’t invest all your 
money in that single sector, however, because diversification is still vital.
Investors with $50,000 or more
If you have $50,000 or more to invest, have no more than five to ten stocks in 
two or three different sectors. It’s difficult to thoroughly track more than two 
or three sectors and do it successfully — best to keep it simple. For example, 
Warren Buffett, considered the greatest stock market investor of all time, 
invests only in businesses that he understands. If that strategy works for bil­
lionaire investors, then, by golly, it can’t be that bad for smaller investors.

270
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
	
We suggest investing in no more than seven to ten stocks, because there is 
such a thing as overdiversification. The more stocks you have, the tougher it 
is to keep track of them. Owning more stocks means you need to do more 
research, read more annual reports and news articles, and follow the business 
news of more companies. Even in the best of times, you need to regularly mon­
itor your stocks because successful investing requires diligent effort.
	
Consider whether to hire a personal money manager (a person who manages 
investment portfolios for a fee). If you have $50,000 to $100,000 or more, doing 
so may make sense. Get a referral from a financial planner and carefully weigh 
the benefits against the costs. Here are some points to consider:
	
✓	Make sure the money manager has a philosophy and an approach that 
you agree with. Ask her to give you a copy of her written investment 
philosophy. How does she feel about small-cap stocks versus large caps, 
or income investing versus growth investing?
	
✓	Find out whether you’re comfortable with how the money manager 
selects stocks. Is he a value investor or a growth investor? Is he aggressive 
or conservative? Does he analyze a stock based on its fundamentals (sales, 
earnings, book value, and so on), or does he use stock price charts?
	
✓	Ask the money manager to explain her strategy. A good way to evalu­
ate the success (or failure) of the money manager’s strategy is to ask her 
for her past recommendations. Did she pick more winners than losers?
	
✓	Ask the money manager to describe his economic philosophy. Is it 
Keynesian, Austrian, or some other school of thought? Yes, it does 
matter; Chapter 10 gives you some details about this.
Knowing When to Sell
The act of buying stock is relatively easy. However, the act of selling stock can 
be an agonizing decision for investors. But it’s agonizing only in two instances: 
when you’ve made money with your stock and when you’ve lost it. That about 
covers it. It sounds like a bad joke, but it’s not that far from the truth.
The idea of selling stock when it has appreciated (the stock price has 
increased in value) comes with the following concerns:
	
✓	Tax implications: This concern is a good reason to consider selling. See 
Chapter 22 for information about how selling stocks under given circum­
stances can affect your taxes.
	
✓	Emotional baggage: “That stock was in our family for years.” Believe it 
or not, investors cite this personal reason (or one of a dozen other per­
sonal reasons) for agonizing over the sale of an appreciated stock.

271
 Chapter 20: Selecting a Strategy That’s Just Right for You
The following is a list of issues investors should be aware of when they’re 
selling a stock that has lost money:
	
✓	Tax benefits: This issue is a good reason to consider selling a stock. See 
Chapter 22 for more on timing your stock sales to minimize your Canada 
Revenue Agency tax burden.
	
✓	Pride: “If I sell, I’ll have to admit I was wrong” (followed by silent sob­
bing). So what? The best investors in history have made bad invest­
ments (some that have been quite embarrassing, in fact). Losing a little 
pride is cheaper than losing your money.
	
✓	Doubt: “If I sell my stock now, it may rebound later.” Frequently, when 
an investor buys a stock at $50 and it goes to $40, the investor believes 
that if he sells, the stock will make an immediate rebound and go to $60, 
and then he’ll be kicking himself. That may happen, but more often than 
not the stock price goes lower.
	
✓	Separation anxiety: “But I’ve had this stock so long that it’s become 
a part of me.” People hang onto a losing stock for all sorts of illogical 
reasons. Being married to a person is great; being married to a stock is 
ludicrous. If a stock isn’t helping your goals, then it’s hurting your goals.
People have plenty more reasons to agonize over the sale of a bad stock, but 
you can learn to handle the stock sale in a disciplined manner.
	
You have only two reasons to consider selling a stock, regardless of whether 
the stock price has gone up or down:
	
✓	You need the money. Obviously, if you need the money for a bona fide 
reason — such as paying off debt, wiping out a tax bill, or buying a home — 
then you need the money. This reason is easy to see. After all, regardless of 
investment or tax considerations, stocks are there to serve you. We hope 
you do some financial planning so that you don’t need to sell your stocks 
for these types of expenses, but you can’t avoid unexpected expenditures.
	
✓	The stock ceases to perform as you desire. If the stock isn’t serving 
your wealth-building goals or fulfilling your investment objectives, it’s 
time to get rid of it and move on to the next stock. Just as soon as you 
get a stiff upper lip and resolve to unload this losing stock, a little voice 
saying, “If I sell my stock now, it may rebound later,” starts to haunt you. 
So you hang onto the stock, but then — bam! — before you know it, you 
lose more money.
	
Selling a stock shouldn’t require a psychologist, but it does require discipline, 
which is why we’re big proponents of trailing stops (see Chapter 21 for more 
on stop orders). Trailing stops take the agony out of selling the stock. All else 
being equal, you shouldn’t sell a winning stock. If it’s doing well, why sell it? 
Keep it as long as possible. But if it stops being a winning stock, sell it. If you 
don’t know how or when to sell it, then apply a stop-loss order at 5 or 10 per­
cent below the market value and let the market action take its course.

nvestment success isn’t just about picking rising stocks; it’s also about 
how you go about doing it. Frequently, investors think that good stock 
picking means doing your homework and then making that buy (or sell). 
However, you can take it a step further to maximize profits (or minimize 
losses). As a stock investor, you can take advantage of techniques and ser­
vices available through your standard brokerage account. (See Chapter 7 for 
more on brokerage accounts.) This chapter presents some of the best ways 
you can use these powerful techniques — useful whether you’re buying or 
selling stock. In fact, if you retain nothing more from this chapter than the 
concept of trailing stops (see the section “Trailing stops”), you’ll have gotten 
your money’s worth. (Really!)
Just before the most recent, low-interest-rate-fuelled stock market bubble 
popped, we warned our readers that a bear market was on the way. All the 
data warned us about it, and undoubtedly it seemed like a time for cau­
tion. Canadian stock investors didn’t necessarily have to believe us, but 
they could have (at the very least) used trailing stops and other techniques 
to ensure greater investing success. Investors who used stop-loss orders 
avoided the carnage of trillions of dollars in stock losses. In this chapter, we 
show you how to use these techniques to maximize your investing profit.

274
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Checking Out Brokerage Orders
Orders you place with your stockbroker fit neatly into three categories:
	
✓	Time-related orders
	
✓	Condition-related orders
	
✓	Advanced orders
At the very least, get familiar with the first two types of orders. They’re easy 
to implement, and they’re invaluable tools for wealth building and (more 
importantly) wealth saving! Advanced orders usually are combinations of the 
first two types.
	
Using a combination of orders helps you fine-tune your strategy so that you 
can maintain greater control over your investments. Speak with your broker 
about the different types of orders you can use to maximize the gains (or mini­
mize the losses) from your stock investing activities. You also can read the 
broker’s policies on stock orders at the brokerage Web site.
On the clock: Time-related orders
Time-related orders mean just that; the order has a time limit. Typically, 
you use these orders in conjunction with conditional orders. The two most 
common time-related orders are day orders and good-till-cancelled (GTC) 
orders.
Day order
A day order is an order to buy a stock that expires at the end of that particu­
lar trading day. If you tell your broker, “Buy BYOB Inc. at $37.50 and make it 
a day order,” you mean that you want to purchase the stock at $37.50. But if 
the stock doesn’t hit that price, your order expires at the end of the trading 
day unfilled. Why would you place such an order? Maybe BYOB is trading at 
$39, but you don’t want to buy it at that price because you don’t believe the 
stock is worth it. Consequently, you have no problem not getting the stock 
that day.
When would you use day orders? It depends on your preferences and per­
sonal circumstances. We don’t use day orders too often because few events 
cause us to say, “Gee, we’ll just try to buy or sell between now and the end of 
today’s trading action.” However, you may feel that you don’t want a speci­
fied order to linger beyond today’s market action. Perhaps you want to test a 
price. (“I want to get rid of stock A at $39 to make a quick profit, but it’s cur­
rently trading at $37.50. However, I may change my mind tomorrow.”) A day 
order is the perfect strategy to use in this case.

275
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
	
If you make any trade and don’t specify time with the order, most (if not all) 
brokers automatically treat it as a day order.
Good-till-cancelled (GTC)
A good-till-cancelled (GTC) order is the most commonly requested order 
by investors. Although GTC orders are time-related, they’re always tied to a 
condition, such as when the stock achieves a certain price. The GTC order 
means just what it says: The order stays in effect until it’s transacted or until 
the investor cancels it. Although the order implies that it can run indefinitely, 
most Canadian brokers have a limit of 30 or 60 days (or more). By that time, 
either the broker cancels the order or contacts you to see whether you want 
to extend it. Ask about your broker’s particular policy.
A GTC order is usually coupled with conditional or condition-related orders. 
For example, say you want to buy ASAP Corp. stock but you don’t want to 
buy it at the current price of $48 per share. You’ve done your homework on 
the stock, including looking at the stock’s price-to-earnings ratio, price-to-
book ratio, and so on (see Appendix A for more on ratios). So you say, “Hey, 
this stock isn’t worth $48 per share. I’d only buy it at $36 per share.” You 
think the stock would make a good addition to your portfolio, but not at the 
current market price. (It’s overpriced or overvalued, according to your analy­
sis.) How should you proceed? Your best bet is to ask your broker to do a 
“GTC order at $36.” This request means that your broker will buy the shares 
if and when they hit the $36 mark (or until you cancel the order). Just make 
sure your account has the funds available to complete the transaction.
	
GTC orders are very useful, so become familiar with your broker’s policy 
on them. While you’re at it, ask whether any fees apply. Many brokers don’t 
charge for GTC orders because, if they happen to result in a buy (or sell) 
order, they generate a normal commission just as any stock transaction does. 
Other brokers may charge a small fee.
To be successful with GTC orders, you need to know the following information:
	
✓	When you want to buy: People have had a tendency to rush into buying 
a stock without giving some thought to what they could do to get more 
for their money. Some Canadians don’t realize that the stock market 
can be a place for bargain-hunting consumers. If you’re ready to buy a 
quality pair of socks for $16 in a department store but the sales clerk 
says that those same socks are going on sale tomorrow for only $8, 
what would you do — assuming that you’re a cost-conscious consumer? 
Unless you’re barefoot, you’re probably better off waiting. The same 
point holds true with stocks.
	
	Say you want to buy SOX Inc. at $26, but it’s currently trading at $30. 
You think that $30 is too expensive, but you’re happy to buy the stock at 
$26 or lower. However, you have no idea whether the stock will move to 
your desired price today, tomorrow, next week, or even next month (or 
maybe never). In this case, a GTC order is appropriate.

276
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
	
✓	When you want to sell: What if you bought some socks at a department 
store and then you discovered that they have holes (darn it!)? Wouldn’t 
you want to get rid of them? Of course you would. If a stock’s price 
starts to unravel, you want to be able to get rid of it, as well.
	
	Perhaps you already own SOX (at $25, for instance) but are concerned 
that market conditions may drive the price lower. You’re not certain 
which way the stock will move in the coming days and weeks. In this 
case, a GTC order to sell the stock at a specified price is a suitable strat­
egy. Because the stock price is $25, you may want to place a GTC order 
to sell it if it falls to $22.50 to prevent further losses. Again, in this exam­
ple, GTC is the time frame, and it accompanies a condition (sell when 
the stock hits $22.50).
At your command: Condition-related 
orders
A condition-related order means that the order is executed only when a cer­
tain condition is met. Conditional orders enhance your ability to buy stocks 
at a lower price, to sell at a better price, or to minimize potential losses. 
When stock markets become bearish or uncertain, conditional orders are 
highly recommended. A good example of a conditional order is a limit order. 
A limit order may say, “Buy Mojeski Corp. at $45.” But if Mojeski Corp. isn’t at 
$45 (this price is the condition), the order isn’t executed.
Market orders
When you buy stock, the simplest type of order is a market order — an order 
to buy or sell a stock at the market’s current best available price. It doesn’t 
get any more basic than that.
Here’s an example: Kowalski Inc. is available at the market price of $10. When 
you call up your broker and instruct him to buy 100 shares “at the market,” he’ll 
implement the order for your account, and you pay $1,000 plus commission.
We say “current best available price” because the stock’s price is constantly 
moving, and catching the best price can be a function of the broker’s ability 
to process the stock purchase. For very active stocks, the price change can 
happen within seconds. It’s not unheard of to have three brokers simultane­
ously place orders for the same stocks and get three different prices because 
of differences in the brokers’ capabilities. (Some computers are faster than 
others.)

277
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
The advantage of a market order is that the transaction is processed imme­
diately, and you get your stock without worrying about whether it hits a 
particular price. For example, if you buy Kowalski Inc. with a market order, 
you know that by the end of that phone call (or Web site visit) you’re assured 
of getting the stock. The disadvantage of a market order is that you can’t 
control the price that you pay for the stock. Whether you’re buying or sell­
ing your shares, you may not realize the exact price you expect (especially 
if you’re buying a volatile stock — usually unpredictable because it has low 
trading volumes).
	
Market orders get finalized in the chronological order in which they’re placed. 
Your price may change because the orders ahead of you in line caused the 
stock price to rise or fall based on the latest events.
Stop orders (also known as stop-loss orders)
A stop order (or stop-loss order, if you own the stock) is a condition-related 
order that instructs the broker to sell a particular stock only when the stock 
reaches a particular price. It acts like a trigger, and the stop order converts 
to a market order to sell the stock immediately.
	
The stop-loss order isn’t designed to take advantage of small, short-term moves 
in the stock’s price. It’s meant to help you protect the bulk of your money when 
the market turns against your stock investment in a sudden manner.
Say that your Kowalski Inc. stock rises to $20 per share, and you seek to 
protect your investment against a possible future market decline. A stop-loss 
order at $18 triggers your broker to sell the stock immediately if it falls to the 
$18 mark. In this example, if the stock suddenly drops to $17, it still triggers 
the stop-loss order, but the finalized sale price is $17. In a volatile market, 
you may not be able to sell at your precise stop-loss price. However, because 
the order automatically gets converted into a market order, the sale will be 
done, and you prevent further declines in the stock.
The main benefit of a stop-loss order is that it prevents a major decline in 
a stock that you own. It’s a form of discipline that’s important in investing 
because it minimizes potential losses. You may find it agonizing to sell a 
stock that has fallen. If you don’t sell, however, your stock may continue to 
plummet as you keep holding on while hoping for a rebound in the price.
	
Most investors set a stop-loss amount at about 10 percent below the market 
value of a stock. This percentage gives the stock some room to fluctuate, 
which most stocks tend to do on a day-to-day basis.

278
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Trailing stops
Trailing stops are an important technique in wealth preservation for sea­
soned stock investors, and they can be one of your key strategies in using 
stop-loss orders. A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that an investor actively 
manages by moving it up along with the stock’s market price. The stop-loss 
order “trails” the stock price upward. As the stop-loss goes upward, it pro­
tects more and more of the stock’s value from declining.
A real-life example may be the best way to help you understand trailing 
stops. Say you bought a stock at $25 per share. As soon as you finished 
buying it, you immediately told your broker to put a stop-loss order at $22 
and to make it a good-till-cancelled (GTC) order. Think of what you did. In 
effect, you placed an ongoing safety net under your stock. The stock can go 
as high as the sky, but if it should fall, the stock’s price triggers a market 
order at $22. Your stock is automatically sold, minimizing your loss.
If your stock goes to $50 per share in a few months, you can call your broker, 
cancel the former stop-loss order at $22, and replace it with a new (higher) 
stop-loss order. You simply say, “Please put a new stop-loss order at $45 and 
make it a GTC order.” This higher stop-loss price protects not only your origi­
nal investment of $20 but also a big chunk of your profit, as well. As time goes 
by and the stock price climbs, you can continue to raise the stop-loss price 
and add GTC provisions. Now you know why it’s called a trailing stop: It trails 
the stock price upward like a giant tail. All along the way, it protects more 
and more of your growing investment without limiting its upward movement.
William O’Neill, publisher and founder of Investor’s Business Daily, advocates 
setting a trailing stop of 8 percent below your purchase price. That’s his pref­
erence. Some investors who invest in very volatile stocks may put in trailing 
stops of 20 or 25 percent. Is a stop-loss order desirable or advisable in every 
situation? No. It depends on your level of experience, your investment goals, 
and the market environment. Still, stop-loss orders are appropriate in most 
cases, especially if the market seems uncertain (or if you do!).
	
A trailing stop is a stop-loss order that you actively manage. The stop-loss 
order is good-till-cancelled (GTC), and it constantly trails the stock’s price 
as it moves up. To successfully implement trailing stops, keep the following 
points in mind:
	
✓	Remember that brokers usually don’t place trailing stops for you 
automatically. In fact, they won’t (or shouldn’t) place any type of order 
without your consent. Deciding on the type of order to place is your 
responsibility. You can raise, lower, or cancel a trailing-stop order at 
will, but you need to monitor your investment when substantial moves 
occur to respond to the movement appropriately.

279
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
	
✓	Change the stop-loss order when the stock price moves significantly. 
Hopefully, you won’t call your broker every time the stock moves 50 
cents. Change the stop-loss order when the stock price moves about 10 
percent. When you initially purchase the stock (say at $90 per share), 
request that the broker place the stop-loss order at $81. When the stock 
moves to $100, cancel the $81 stop-loss order and replace it at $90. 
When the stock’s price moves to $110, change the stop-loss order to $99, 
and so on.
	
✓	Understand your broker’s policy on GTC orders. If your broker usually 
lets GTC orders expire after 30 or 60 days, be aware of it. You don’t want 
to risk a sudden drop in your stock’s price without the stop-loss order 
protection. If your broker’s time limit is 60 days, note this so that you 
can renew the order for additional time.
	
✓	Monitor your stock. A trailing stop isn’t a set-it-and-forget-it technique. 
Monitoring your investment is critical. Of course, if your investment 
falls, the stop-loss order prevents further loss. Should the stock price 
rise substantially, remember to adjust your trailing stop accordingly. 
Keep raising the safety net as the stock continues to rise. Part of moni­
toring the stock is knowing the beta, which you can read more about in 
the next section.
Using beta measurement
To be a successful investor, you need to understand the volatility of the 
particular stock you invest in. In stock market parlance, this volatility is 
also called the beta of a stock. Beta is a quantitative measure of the volatil­
ity of a given stock (and mutual funds and portfolios, too) relative to the 
overall market, usually the S&P 500 Index. (For more information on U.S. 
and Canadian indexes, see Chapter 5.) Beta specifically measures the perfor­
mance movement of a stock as the S&P moves 1 percent up or down. A beta 
measurement above 1 is more volatile than the overall market, while a beta 
below 1 is less volatile. Some stocks are relatively stable in their price move­
ments; others jump around.
Because beta measures how volatile or unstable the stock’s price is, it tends 
to be uttered in the same breath as “risk” — more volatility indicates more 
risk. Similarly, less volatility tends to mean less risk.
Table 21-1 shows some sample betas of well-known U.S. and Canadian compa­
nies (as of July 2009).

You can find a company’s beta at Web sites that usually provide a lot of finan­
cial information, such as Nasdaq’s Web site (www.nasdaq.com) or Yahoo! 
Finance (finance.yahoo.ca).
The beta is useful to know because it gives you a general idea of the stock’s 
trading range. If a stock is currently priced at $50 and it typically trades in 
the $48–$52 range, a trailing stop at $49 doesn’t make sense. In this case, 
your stock will probably be sold the same day you initiate the stop-loss 
order. If your stock is a volatile growth stock that could swing up and down 
by 10 percent, you should more logically set your stop-loss order at 15 per­
cent below that day’s price.
	
The stock of a large-cap company in a mature industry tends to have a low 
beta — one close to the overall market. Small- and mid-cap stocks in new or 
emerging industries tend to have greater volatility in their day-to-day price 
fluctuations; hence, they tend to have a high beta. (You can find out more 
about large-, small-, and mid-cap stocks in Chapter 1.)
Limit orders
A limit order is a very precise condition-related order, implying that a limit 
exists either on the buy or the sell side of the transaction. You want to buy 
(or sell) only at a specified price or better. Period. Limit orders work well for 
you if you’re buying the stock, but they may not be good for you if you’re sell­
ing the stock. Here’s how it works in both instances:

281
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
	
✓	When you’re buying: Just because you like a particular company and 
you want its stock, it doesn’t mean you’re willing to pay the current 
market price. Maybe you want to buy Kowalski Inc., but the current 
market price of $20 per share isn’t acceptable to you. You prefer to buy 
it at $16 because you think this price reflects its true market value. So 
what do you do? You tell your broker, “Buy Kowalski with a limit order 
at $16.” You also have to specify whether it’s a day order (good for the 
day) or a GTC order (which we discuss in its own section earlier in this 
chapter).
	
	What happens if the stock experiences great volatility? What if it drops 
to $16.01 and then suddenly drops again to $15.95 on the next move? 
Actually, nothing happens, you may be dismayed to hear. Because your 
order was limited to $16, it can be transacted only at $16, no more or 
less. The only way for this particular trade to occur is if the stock rises 
back to $16. However, if the price keeps dropping, then your limit order 
isn’t transacted and it may expire or be cancelled.
	
	On the other hand, many brokers, including TD Waterhouse, interpret 
the limit order as “Buy at this specific price or better.” Presumably, if 
your limit order is to buy the stock at $10, you’ll be just as happy if your 
broker buys that stock for you at $9.95. This way, if you don’t get exactly 
$10 because the stock’s price was volatile, you’ll still get the stock at 
a lower price. Speak to your particular broker to be clear about their 
meaning of limit order.
	
✓	When you’re selling: Limit orders are activated only when a stock hits 
a specific price. If you buy Kowalski Inc. at $20 and you worry about a 
decline in the share price, you may decide to put in a limit order at $18. 
If you watch the news and hear that Kowalski’s price is dropping, you 
may sigh and say, “I sure am glad that I put in that limit order at $18!” 
However, in a volatile market, the share price may leapfrog over your 
specified price. It could go from $18.01 to $17.99 and then continue its 
descent. Because the stock price never hit $18 on the mark, it isn’t sold. 
You may be sitting at home satisfied (mistakenly) that you played it 
smart while your stock plummets to $15, or $10, or worse! This is why 
having a stop-loss order in place is best.
The joys of technology: Advanced orders
Brokers have added sophisticated capabilities to the existing repertoire of 
orders that are available for stock investors. One example is advanced orders, 
which provide investors with a way to use a combination of orders for more 
sophisticated trades. An example of an advanced order is something like, 

282
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
“Only sell stock B, and if it sells, use the proceeds to buy stock D.” You get 
the idea. Check with your broker for details on this service. Examples of 
advanced orders include the following:
	
✓	One order cancels another order: This happens when you enter two 
orders simultaneously with the condition that if one order is executed, 
the second order is automatically cancelled.
	
✓	One order triggers another order: Here you submit an order, and if that 
order is filled another order is automatically submitted. Many brokers 
have different names for these types of orders, so ask them if they can 
provide such an order.
Other types of advanced orders are available, but you get the picture. Talk to 
your brokerage firm and find out what’s available in your particular account. 
Investors need to know that today’s technology allows them to have more 
power and control over the implementation of buying and selling transactions.
Pass the Margin, Please
Margin means buying securities, such as stocks, by using funds that you 
borrow from your broker. Buying stock on margin is similar to buying a 
condominium with a mortgage. If you buy a condominium at the purchase 
price of $100,000 and put 10 percent down, your equity (the part you own) is 
$10,000 and you borrow the remaining $90,000 with a mortgage. If the value 
of the condo rises to $120,000 and you sell (for simplicity’s sake, we don’t 
include closing costs in this example), you will have obviously made a profit 
of $20,000. The $20,000 gain on the property represents a gain of 20 percent 
on the purchase price of $100,000, but because your real investment was 
$10,000 (the down payment), your gain effectively works out to 200 percent 
(a gain of $20,000 on your initial investment of $10,000).
	
Buying on margin is an example of using leverage to maximize your gain 
when prices rise. Leverage is simply using borrowed money to increase your 
profit. This type of leverage is great in a favourable (bull) market, but it works 
against you in an unfavourable (bear) market. Say that a $100,000 condomin­
ium you purchase with a $90,000 mortgage falls in value to $80,000 (property 
values can decrease rapidly during economic hard times). Your outstanding 
debt of $90,000 exceeds the value of the property. Because you owe more than 
you own, you have a negative net worth. Leverage is a double-edged sword.
Examining marginal outcomes
Suppose you think that the stock for the company Mergatroid Inc., currently 
at $40 per share, will go up in value. You want to buy 100 shares, but you 

283
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
have only $2,000. What can you do? If you’re intent on buying 100 shares 
(versus simply buying the 50 shares that you have the cash for), you can 
borrow the additional $2,000 from your broker on margin. If you do that, 
what are the potential outcomes?
If the stock price goes up
This is the best outcome for you. If Mergatroid goes to $50 per share, your 
investment will be worth $5,000 and your outstanding margin loan will be 
$2,000. If you sell, the total proceeds will pay off the loan and leave you with 
$3,000. Because your initial investment was $2,000, your profit is a solid 50 
percent, because ultimately your $2,000 principal amount generated a $1,000 
profit. (For the sake of this example, we leave out any charges such as com­
missions and interest paid on the margin loan.) However, if you pay the 
entire $4,000 up front — without the margin loan — your $4,000 investment 
will generate a profit of $1,000, or 25 percent. Using margin, you double the 
return on your money.
	
Leverage, when used properly, is very profitable. However, it is still debt, so 
understand that you must pay it off eventually.
If the stock price fails to rise
If the stock goes nowhere, you still have to pay interest on that margin loan. 
If the stock pays dividends, this money can defray some of the cost of the 
margin loan. In other words, dividends can help you pay off what you borrow 
from the broker.
Having the stock neither rise nor fall may seem like a neutral situation, but 
you pay interest on your margin loan with each passing day. For this reason, 
margin trading can be a good consideration for conservative investors only 
if the stock pays a high dividend. Many times, a high dividend from $4,000 
worth of stock can exceed the margin interest you have to pay on the $2,000 
(50 percent) you borrow from the broker to buy that stock.
If the stock price goes down
If the stock price falls, buying on margin can work against you. What if 
Mergatroid goes to $38 per share? The market value of 100 shares will be 
$3,800, but your equity will shrink to only $1,800 because you have to pay 
back your $2,000 margin loan. You’re not exactly looking at a disaster at this 
point, but you’d better be careful, because the margin loan exceeds 50 percent 
of your stock investment. If it goes any lower, you may get the notorious 
margin call, when the broker actually contacts you to ask you to restore the 
ratio between the margin loan and the value of the securities. See the follow­
ing section for information about appropriate debt-to-equity ratios.

284
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Maintaining your balance
When you purchase stock on margin, you must maintain a balanced ratio of 
margin debt to equity of at least 50 percent. If the debt portion exceeds this 
limit, you’ll be required to restore the ratio by depositing either more stock 
or more cash into your brokerage account. The additional stock you deposit 
can be stock that’s transferred from another account.
If, for example, Mergatroid falls to $28 per share, the margin loan portion 
exceeds 50 percent of the equity value in that stock — in this case, the 
market value of your stock is $2,800, but the margin loan is still at $2,000. The 
margin loan is a worrisome 71 percent of the market value ($2,000 ÷ $2,800 = 
71 percent). Expect to get a call from your broker to put more securities or 
cash into the account to restore the 50-percent balance.
If you can’t come up with more stock, other securities, or cash, the next step 
is to sell stock from the account and then to use the proceeds to pay off the 
margin loan. For you, it means realizing a capital loss — you lost money on 
your investment.
Margin, as you can see, can escalate your profits (on the upside), but magnify 
your losses (on the downside). If your stock plummets drastically, you can 
end up with a margin loan that exceeds the market value of the stock that you 
used the loan to purchase. In the bear market of 2000, many people were hurt 
by stock losses, and a large number of these losses were made worse because 
people didn’t manage the responsibilities involved with margin trading.
	
If you buy stock on margin, use a disciplined approach. Be extra careful when 
using leverage, such as a margin loan, because it can backfire. Keep the follow­
ing points in mind:
	
✓	Have ample reserves of cash or marginable securities in your account. 
Try to keep the margin ratio at 35 percent or less to minimize the chance 
of a margin call.
	
✓	Consider using margin to buy stock in large companies that have a 
relatively stable price and pay a good dividend (if you’re a beginner). 
Some people buy income stocks that have dividend yields that exceed 
the margin interest rate, meaning that the stock ends up paying for its 
own margin loan. Just remember those stop orders.
	
✓	Monitor your stocks constantly. If the market turns against you, the 
result will be especially painful if you use margin.
	
✓	Have a payback plan for your margin debt. Margin loans against your 
investments mean that you’re paying interest. Your ultimate goal is to 
make money, and paying interest eats into your profits.

285
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
Going Short and Coming Out Ahead
The vast majority of stock investors are familiar with buying stock, hold­
ing on to it for a while, and hoping its value goes up. This kind of thinking 
is called going long, and investors who go long are considered to be long on 
stocks. Going long essentially means that you’re bullish and seeking your 
profits from rising prices. However, astute investors also profit in the market 
when stock prices fall. Going short (also called shorting a stock, selling short, 
or doing a short sale) on a stock is a common technique for profiting from a 
stock price decline. Investors have made big profits during bear markets by 
going short. A short sale is a bet that a particular stock will go down.
	
To go short, you have to be deemed (by your broker) creditworthy — your 
account needs to be approved for short selling. When you’re approved for 
margin trading, you’re probably all set to sell short, too. Speak to your broker 
(or check for this information on the broker’s Web site) about limitations in 
your account regarding going short.
	
Because going short on stocks carries greater risks than going long, we 
strongly advise beginning investors to avoid shorting stocks until they 
become more seasoned.
Most people easily understand making money by going long. It boils down to 
“Buy low and sell high.” Piece of cake. Going short means making money by 
selling high and then buying low. Huh? Thinking in reverse is not a piece of 
cake. Although thinking of this stock adage in reverse may be challenging, the 
mechanics of going short are really very simple. Consider an example that 
uses a fictitious company called DOA Inc. As a stock, DOA ($50 per share) is 
looking pretty sickly. It has lots of debt and plummeting sales and earnings, 
and the news is out that DOA’s industry (commercial real estate) will face 
hard times for the foreseeable future. This situation describes a stock that is 
an ideal candidate for shorting. The future may be bleak for DOA, but promis­
ing for savvy investors.
	
You must understand brokerage rules before you conduct short selling. The 
broker must approve you for it, and you must meet the minimum collateral 
requirement, which is typically 50 percent of the shorted stock’s market value. 
If the stock generates dividends, those are paid to the owner of the stock, not 
to the person who is borrowing it to go short. (See the next section, “Setting 
up a short sale,” to see how this technique works.) Check with your broker for 
complete details and review the resources in Appendix B.

286
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Setting up a short sale
This section explains how to go short. Say you believe that DOA is the right 
stock to short — you’re pretty sure its price is going to fall. With DOA at $50, you 
instruct your broker to “Go short 100 shares on DOA.” (It doesn’t have to be 100 
shares; we’re just using that as an example.) Now, here’s what happens next:
	
1.	Your broker borrows 100 shares of DOA stock, either from his own 
inventory or from another client or broker.
	
	 That’s right. The stock can be borrowed from a client, no permission 
necessary. The broker guarantees the transaction, and the client/owner 
of the stock never has to be informed about it, because she never loses 
legal and beneficial right to the stock. You borrow 100 shares, and you’ll 
return 100 shares when it’s time to complete the transaction.
	
2.	Your broker then sells the stock and gives you the money.
	
	 Your account is credited with $5,000 (100 shares × $50) in cash — the 
money gained from selling the borrowed stock. This cash acts like a loan 
on which you’re going to have to pay interest.
	
3.	You use the $5,000 for a little while.
	
	 Your broker has deposited the $5,000 into your account. You can use 
this money to buy other investments.
	
4.	You buy the stock back and return it to its rightful owner.
	
	 When it’s time to close, or cover, the transaction (either you want to 
close it or the owner of the shares wants to sell the shares, so you have 
to give them back), you must return the number of shares you borrowed 
(in this case, it was 100 shares). If you buy back the 100 shares at $40 
per share (remember that you shorted this particular stock because you 
were sure its price was going to fall) and these 100 shares are returned 
to their owner, you make a $1,000 profit. (To keep the example tidy, 
we don’t include brokerage commissions.) By selling short, you made 
money when the stock price fell!
Oops! Going short when prices grow taller
	
We bet you guessed there was a flip side to the wonderful profitability of selling 
short. Presume that you were wrong about DOA and that the stock price rises 
from the ashes as it goes from $50 to $87. Now what? You still have to return 
the 100 shares you borrowed. With the stock’s price at $87, you have to buy the 
stock for $8,700 (100 shares at the new, higher price of $87). Ouch! How do you 
pay for it? Well, you have that original $5,000 in your account from when you 
initially went short on the stock. But where do you get the other $3,700 ($8,700 
less the original $5,000)? You guessed it — your pocket! You have to cough up 
the difference. If the stock continues to rise, that’s a lot of coughing.

287
 Chapter 21: Understanding Brokerage Orders and Trading Techniques
	
How much money do you lose if the stock goes to $100 or more? A heck of a 
lot. As a matter of fact, there’s theoretically no limit to how much you can 
lose. That’s why going short can be riskier than going long. With going long, 
the most you can lose is 100 percent of your money. However, with going 
short, you can lose more than 100 percent of the money you invested. Yikes!
	
Because the potential for loss is unlimited when you short a stock, we suggest 
that you use a stop order (also called a buy-stop order) to minimize the damage. 
Better yet, make it a good-till-cancelled order, which we discuss earlier in this 
chapter. You can set the stop order at a given price, and if the stock hits that 
price, you buy the stock back so that you can return it to its owner before the 
price rises even higher. You still lose money, but you limit your losses.
Feeling the squeeze
If you go short on a stock, remember that, sooner or later, you have to buy 
that stock back so that you can return it to its owner. What happens when 
a lot of people are short on a particular stock and its price starts to rise? All 
those short sellers will be scrambling to buy the stock back so that they can 
close their transactions before they lose too much money. This mass buying 
quickens the pace of the stock’s ascent and puts a squeeze (called a short 
squeeze) on the investors who had been shorting the stock.
Earlier in the chapter, we explain that your broker can borrow stock from 
another client so that you can go short on it. What happens when that client 
wants to sell the stock in her account — the stock that you borrowed and is 
no longer in her account? When that happens, your broker asks you to return 
the borrowed stock. That’s when you feel the squeeze — you have to buy the 
stock back at the current price.
	
Going short can be a great manoeuvre in a declining (bear) market, but it can 
be brutal if the stock price goes up. If you’re a beginner, stay away from short 
selling until you have enough experience (and money) to risk it.

H
ow much tax does investment income draw? Yup, you guessed it — it 
depends! (We hate it when people say that, too!)
Different forms of income attract different levels of taxation. For example, 
relative to other types of investment income, interest income draws the 
most punishing tax. Things get a bit better with dividend income, where the 
Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) taxes you but may also give you a tax credit 
to cushion the blow. With capital gains, the CRA hits you with only a partial 
blow — only a fraction of your gains or losses is included in, or deducted 
from, your income. And then there’s the other investment-related stuff, like 
real estate investment trusts, which add more murkiness to the CRA’s arsenal 
of rules. Hey, without the smoke and mirrors, tax accountants would starve!
We explore these and other tax-related issues in this chapter. Before cutting 
into the nitty-gritty stuff, however, we set the stage with an overview that will 
help you deal more easily with the many tax rules associated with investment 
income. Knowing the tax rules for investment income is a critical first step in tax 
planning, if your objective is to minimize your taxes. We trust that at the end of 
this chapter, you’ll realize what we have come to realize — most of the rules, and 
their associated tax planning tips, are more manageable than they look!

Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Interest Income
Interest income is taxable in full in the year in which it’s received. No deduc­
tions or credits are associated with interest income. Bank accounts, GICs, 
term deposits, mortgages receivable, and bonds are some of the financial 
instruments out there that produce interest income.
The CRA wants your interest income so much that, for interest income on 
compound-interest obligations obtained in 1990 or later (for example, Canada 
Savings Bonds), interest has to be reported on an annual accrual basis from 
the investment’s anniversary date. That means you report it as though you 
have received interest even if you haven’t. Providers of investment vehicles 
(like banks that provide GICs) are required by law to send their clients 
annual information slips (T5, Statement of Investment Income) reporting 
interest, dividends, and other forms of investment income.
For interest on investments obtained before 1990 and after 1981, interest 
income can be reported in several ways at the investor’s option. If you hold 
such older investments, a brief refresher on these options never hurts. 
Interest can be
	
✓	Accrued and reported annually.
	
✓	Recognized as received.
	
✓	Reported as it becomes receivable. This is interest that you fully earned, 
and you have a legal right to claim it.
	
✓	Accrued and reported on a triennial basis from the date of acquisition. This 
means that interest on compounding investments needs to be reported 
only once every three years, starting at the year of acquisition. If you don’t 
choose one of the other options, this is the method the CRA applies.
	
You can use different options for different investments, but you have to apply 
your choices consistently from year to year. Of course, if an interest-bearing 
investment is held within your RRSP, the tax on the interest earned is deferred 
until the time you withdraw it. We’ll discuss RRSP strategy, and some impor­
tant recent changes in RRSP rules, later in this chapter.
	
The CRA dictates that investments of a similar nature must report their 
income in a similar manner. For instance, if you report interest on a Canada 
Savings Bond on an annual accrual basis, you should report all your govern­
ment bonds in like manner.

291
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
	
Some interest-bearing investments have their own unique reporting methods. 
These investments include annuity contracts, investments bought at a dis­
count to face value, stripped bonds, Canada Savings Bonds, and indexed debt 
obligations. Consider these nuances when making investment and tax plan­
ning decisions; they can have a major impact on your taxes payable. Check 
out these and other current tax law requirements at the CRA’s Web site (www.
cra-arc.gc.ca).
Dividend Income
Compared to interest income, any dividends you receive from a Canadian 
corporation are subject to preferential tax rates. Dividends received are 
taxed at a lower rate because of the availability of a dividend tax credit. This 
dividend tax credit is available to you because the corporation has already 
paid tax on the earnings when it distributed them as dividends to you. In this 
way, the CRA guards against double taxation.
However, not all tax credits are created equal. The CRA says that “eligible 
dividends” received by taxable individuals resident in Canada — that would 
be you — are grossed up (an arbitrary CRA “adjustment”) by 45 percent, and 
that the dividend tax credit relating to such eligible dividends be 19 percent. 
Non-eligible dividends (those that are not designated as “eligible” on a T5 
tax slip or otherwise) would be grossed up by 25 percent with a dividend tax 
credit of 13.3334 percent. The net tax effect for you is that eligible dividends 
attract a 14.5-percent federal tax rate at the highest level of income, and the 
non-eligible dividends attract about a 19-percent federal tax rate at the high­
est level of income.
Essentially, an eligible dividend is any taxable dividend paid after 2005 to a 
resident of Canada by a Canadian corporation that is designated by that cor­
poration to be an eligible dividend. If dividends from Canadian and foreign 
corporations were received inside your RRSP, tax on this income is deferred. 
When you finally withdraw money from your RRSP, it will be fully taxable as 
regular income. That’s because inside RRSPs investment income loses its 
nature and comes in only one flavour — high-tax vanilla. Inside RRSPs, you 
also lose the tax advantage of applying any tax credit. Again, we deal with 
RRSP strategies later in this chapter.
	
Provinces now have their own dividend tax credit, similar to the federal credit. 
Previously, provincial tax was calculated as a simple percentage of the federal 
tax after the federal dividend tax credit was applied.

Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Stock Dividends and Splits
A stock dividend is a dividend that a corporation pays by issuing shares 
instead of cash. Stock dividends are generally considered to be ordinary 
taxable dividends and are treated as such. The amount of the dividend you 
include in taxable income — your share of the increase in paid-up capital — 
also represents the cost of your new shares for future sales as well as capital 
gain or loss calculations.
Stock splits — where you get more shares without any change in the total 
dollar value of those shares — are not taxable. You gained or lost nothing 
from an economic or a tax standpoint.
	
When you get your T3 (Statement of Trust Income Allocations and 
Designations) or T5 tax slip showing your annual dividend income (including 
any stock dividend values), you’ll see boxes that contain both the actual divi­
dends and the taxable amount of dividends paid. Be careful to include only the 
taxable amount of dividends on your tax return.
	
If your spouse has low income, you are claiming him or her as a dependant, 
and he or she earns dividends eligible for the gross-up and dividend tax credit, 
consider transferring those dividends to yourself and then including them in 
your income. The tax benefits associated with dividends are more valuable in 
your hands (in your higher tax bracket) than in your spouse’s hands.
Capital Gains and Losses
A capital gain occurs when you sell or otherwise dispose of a capital property 
for more than you paid for it — technically, the CRA refers to this cost as 
the adjusted cost base because it may sometimes require you to adjust your 
original cost. However, we’ll keep things simple and leave special rules about 
costs out of the picture for now. Just keep in mind that capital gains are 
reduced by any disposition costs incurred, such as brokers’ commissions.
Unlike ordinary income such as salary or interest, only 50 percent of the 
capital gain that you make outside of your RRSP is included in your taxable 
income. This is called a taxable capital gain, and this portion of the total capi­
tal gain is taxed in the year of the sale. If you suffer a capital loss — where 
your costs exceed your proceeds — the 50-percent allowable portion must 
first be used to offset any taxable capital gains that may exist in the same 
year. Any unused allowable capital allowance can be carried back up to three 
years, or carried forward indefinitely, but only to reduce any future taxable 
capital gains.

293
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
	
Keep in mind that just because you didn’t receive any proceeds from a sale, 
that doesn’t always mean you have no capital gain or loss to report. A special 
scenario can play out when you gift shares or other capital property to family 
members. In such cases, the CRA may deem you to have received fair-market-
value consideration at the time of the gift (or a sale for less than fair market 
value). The amount of cash actually changing hands is irrelevant to the CRA.
Capital-gains deduction
If you own shares in a qualifying small business corporation (SBC) you may 
be able to claim a $750,000 ($500,000 for dispositions occurring before March 
19, 2007) capital gains exemption when those shares are sold. At a 50-percent 
inclusion rate, this translates into a very large taxable amount (or benefit, 
depending on how you view it). But your claim of this special deduction may 
be reduced by past capital gains deduction claims or by allowable business 
investment losses and other adjustments. A detailed discussion of this area 
is beyond the scope of this book. If you have SBC shares, we recommend 
you seek professional advice from a tax adviser when you’re ready to sell or 
transfer them.
Superficial losses
The CRA has certain rules concerning superficial losses. A superficial loss 
occurs if you execute a transaction (like a sale or other transfer of invest­
ments) that creates a loss while you, or a related person, keep or quickly 
regain control of the same (or identical) property that created the loss in the 
first place. The CRA applies the superficial loss provision beginning 30 days 
before and ending 30 days after the disposition of a property. In other words, 
no fancy footwork (such as the manipulation of the timing or ownership of 
losses) is permitted a month before or after the sale.
Reserves
If the sale of a property results in a capital gain and a portion of the sale’s 
proceeds is not due until after the year’s end, you may claim a reasonable 
reserve for the unrealized part of that gain. However, you can’t wait forever. 
At least one-fifth of the capital gain must be included in your taxable income 
every year, unless it stems from the sale of shares in an SBC to your children. 
In that case, a minimum one-tenth of the capital gain must be included in 
your income each year. We recommend that you seek professional tax advice 
whenever dealing with complex areas such as SBC shares and reserves.

294
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Oil, Gas, and Mineral Stock Investments
The CRA offers tax incentives to encourage Canadians to invest capital to aid 
the exploration and development of oil, gas, and minerals. These incentives 
are provided through limited partnerships, flow-through shares, joint ven­
tures, and royalty trust units. By going through these risky avenues, you may 
be able to deduct certain exploration expenses.
Joint ventures and limited partnerships are a lot alike, except for the fact that 
at-risk rules don’t apply to the former. Flow-through shares enable companies 
to forgo certain income tax deductions that they could have claimed and to 
pass them on to investors — the deductions flow through to you. (Because 
many junior exploration companies can’t generate a regular taxable income, 
they aren’t able to use their tax deductions, anyway.) Flow-through-share 
investor deductions typically lower the cost base of the shares to nil. This 
decrease can ultimately result in a tax-preferential capital gain when the 
shares are sold.
Furthermore, the government also provides tax incentives regarding 
the availability of flow-through shares for Canadian investors in certain 
renewable-energy and energy conservation projects. This applies to eligible 
Canadian conservation expenses incurred after 2002 concerning flow-through 
share agreements entered into after July 26, 2002. In this way, the govern­
ment makes these shares more attractive for people to buy.
Check out the suitability of these tax-advantaged, but risky, mechanisms 
with your investment or tax adviser before proceeding. Also check out the 
CRA Web site at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/tx/bsnss/tpcs/fts-paa/nvstr/
menu-eng.html to learn more about these investment options. As you can 
see, the rules are tight, complex, and well beyond the scope of this book.
	
As an added incentive to seek professional advice when your tax situation gets 
complicated, you can deduct fees (but not commissions) for advice you get 
about the purchase, sale, and administration of shares and certain other secu­
rities. But those fees have to be paid to professionals whose main business is 
managing such investments.
Mutual Funds
If you hold stocks indirectly through mutual funds outside of an RRSP, taxa­
tion depends on whether you acquire a share of a mutual fund corporation 
or a unit of a mutual fund trust (like a REIT, which we discuss in the next 
section). With both, you may receive distributions during the year. With a 
mutual fund corporation, these distributions are either capital gains divi­
dends — which are treated the same as capital gains, with only 50 percent 
included in income — or taxable dividends. A mutual fund trust allocates its 

295
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
income to the unitholders, who then report the income as capital gains, divi­
dends, foreign income, or other income. Regardless of source, when you sell 
units of mutual fund trusts or shares of mutual fund corporations you may 
realize a capital gain. Again, the beneficial tax treatment of capital gains and 
dividends is lost if they are received within an RRSP.
	
Funds often reinvest distributions to unitholders as new shares of the fund. 
Here, although you don’t see the cash, you’ll still be taxed on the income dis­
tributed. That’s why you may have received a tax slip even though you saw no 
cash. Track the reinvestments well, because they will increase your adjusted 
cost base and therefore reduce any capital gains when you sell the investment.
The Tax-Wise REIT
A real estate investment trust (REIT) is essentially a closed-end mutual fund 
trust. The number of investors is limited. Each year, the trust earns rental 
income and, sometimes, capital gains. However, these items are taxed at the 
unitholder level, and most of the cash generated by the REIT is distributed 
to you, the unitholder. Because REITs can deduct depreciation (a non-cash 
expense), the REIT’s income that’s passed on and taxed at the unitholder 
level is less than the cash that you actually receive.
The bottom line from a tax perspective is that a certain percentage of the 
distributions you get from a REIT will escape from being included in your 
current year’s taxable income. All you do in the current year is reduce your 
REIT’s tax cost base by a simply calculated amount. You realize a capital gain 
(on a lower adjusted cost base) when the units are sold. Tax deferral is a key 
benefit of REITs. Another tax benefit is that when you do sell your REIT units, 
only 50 percent of any capital gain is included in your taxable income.
Here’s another way of viewing the taxation of REITs:
	
✓	Receiving your distributions: On a quarterly or monthly basis, you will 
be paid an actual cash distribution based on your REIT’s income. At the 
end of every calendar year, you will get a further distribution of cash 
that represents any realized capital gains and other income.
	
✓	Allocating your income: After the end of the year, you will also receive 
a T3 Supplementary form. (You get a T3 instead of a T5 because a REIT 
is a mutual fund trust for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.) The T3 
Supplementary shows you, among other things, your allocation of tax­
able income and taxable capital gains for the year. These figures are the 
ones to include as part of your taxable income for the year. If you sell 
your units before the end of the calendar year, you’ll still get a T3 from 
your formerly held REIT representing the part of the year when you 
received distributions.

296
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
	
✓	Reducing your adjusted cost base: To the extent that the sum total of 
distributions received exceeds your taxable income allocation for the 
year, your REIT unit–adjusted cost base is reduced.
Check with your tax adviser to see about the tax impact of REITs and other 
income trusts.
Deferred-Income Tax Shelters and Plans
Deferred-income plans like RRSPs are designed to let you earn investment 
income and, at the same time, defer paying tax for as long as the investments 
and income stay inside the plan. RRSPs even go a step further and provide a 
tax deduction, within CRA limits, for the contributions you make. The follow­
ing sections explore RRSPs and other deferred-income plans. You’ll learn how 
you can use these plans strategically to maximize your investment returns. 
But before you can implement tax strategy and planning in this area, you first 
have to understand how these plans actually work.
Registered Retirement Savings Plans 
(RRSPs)
RRSPs are registered savings plans that let you contribute cash or eligible 
investments for future use — usually for retirement. Eligible investments 
include stocks, mutual funds, shares of small business corporations, bonds, 
income trusts, exchange-traded funds, royalty units, partnership units, 
investment-grade gold and silver bullion and coins, and others that are 
beyond the scope of this book. You cannot hold precious metals that are not 
investment grade, commodity futures, gems, land, employee stock options, 
and some other excluded items.
You can open several different RRSP accounts, and you can passively or 
actively invest in each one in different ways with different investments, such 
as GICs, stocks, or mutual funds.
Because RRSP contributions lower your taxable income, you save tax immedi­
ately. Keep in mind, however, that RRSP withdrawals trigger an income inclu­
sion for the year — even if the full amount withdrawn is reinstated into the 
plan later in that same year. Also bear in mind that while you can pay RRSP–
related administrative fees outside of your plan, they aren’t tax-deductible.

297
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
RRSP contribution limits
Your RRSP contribution limit is 18 percent of your prior year’s earned 
income, less the prior year’s pension adjustment reported on your annual T4 
(Statement of Remuneration Paid). If you have any additional past-service 
pension adjustments, they are also deducted. The contribution limit is also 
adjusted for total pension adjustment reversals (PARs) made. PARs reinstate 
lost contribution room if you left your employer’s Registered Pension Plan 
(RPP) and/or deferred profit-sharing plan before retirement.
Earned income limits
Earned income includes:
	
✓	Alimony or separation allowances received
	
✓	Disability pensions under the Canada Pension Plan (CPP) or Quebec 
Pension Plan (QPP)
	
✓	Employee profit-sharing plan allocations
	
✓	Employment earnings (net of union dues and eligible employment 
expenses)
	
✓	Net income from self-employment and partnerships
	
✓	Net rental income
	
✓	Research grants (net of related expenses)
	
✓	Royalties
	
✓	Supplementary unemployment benefit plan payments (not Employment 
Insurance, or EI)
But earned income is reduced by:
	
✓	Current-year losses from self-employment or an active partnership
	
✓	Current-year rental losses
	
✓	Deductible alimony and maintenance payments.
	
Only one significant disadvantage is associated with receiving dividends com­
pared to a fully taxed salary or interest income. In the context of the earned 
income calculation that determines your RRSP contribution room, dividends 
aren’t deemed by the CRA to be earned income. Therefore, they don’t create 
RRSP contribution room for you.

298
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Dollar limits
For 2009 and 2010, the maximum RRSP deduction limits are $21,000 and 
$22,000, respectively. The CRA Web site (which you should check from time 
to time) states that, “if you did not use all of your RRSP deduction limit for 
the years 1991–2008, you can carry forward the unused amount to 2009.”
Check out the notice of assessment you receive from the CRA after filing your 
prior year’s tax return to find your RRSP contribution limits for the current 
tax year. This assessment guides your contribution limit calculation in the 
most precise way possible. Contributions have to be made within 60 days of 
the calendar year-end to be deductible for the previous tax year. Also remem­
ber that contributions to your RRSP can be made up to and including the 
year in which you turn 71 years old.
Spousal Registered Retirement Savings Plans
Many investors have their own RRSP and also open a spouse or common-law 
partner’s RRSP, subject to limits of deductible amounts. Spousal contribu­
tions are deemed by the CRA to be the recipient spouse/common-law part­
ner’s property. Spousal contributions reduce the contributor’s RRSP limit, 
but they don’t impact the recipient spouse’s contribution limits for his or her 
own RRSP.
Your spousal RRSP contribution has no immediate added tax benefit over 
and above contributing toward your personal RRSP. But your tax savings 
could be large in the future, because spousal RRSP contributions can pro­
vide you and your spouse with the opportunity to balance out retirement 
income and reduce your combined future taxes. Withdrawals by a spouse 
in retirement could be non-taxable, or taxed at much lower rates than if all 
the savings were being drawn by only one spouse. Be mindful, however, that 
withdrawals from a spousal plan might be taxable in your hands if spousal 
contributions were made in either the year of the withdrawal or within the 
two preceding years. Spousal RRSP contributions can be made until the end 
of the year in which the spouse or common-law partner turns 71 years old.
Self-directed RRSPs
Self-directed RRSPs are popular with Canadians who wish to hold and manage 
individual stocks in their RRSP. Another reason many stock investors set up a 
self-directed RRSP is to capitalize on the recent removal of all foreign-content 
limits (the same as for non–self-directed RRSPs) by exploring stocks traded on 
stock exchanges outside of Canada while still getting a tax deduction.
A self-directed RRSP provides a greater selection of investment options than 
a regular RRSP. That’s the key difference between the two choices. They are 
available through discount and full-service brokerage firms. These plans 
are designed for Canadians who wish to personally control and manage the 
assets residing in their plan. Like for non–self-directed RRSPs, the annual 
administration fee and commissions that you pay aren’t tax deductible.

299
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
The list of what you can throw into a self-directed RRSP plan, over and above 
stocks, includes the following:
	
✓	Bank deposit accounts and investment certificates
	
✓	Federal, provincial, and municipal bonds and debentures (debt instru­
ments that pay interest)
	
✓	Mortgages and mortgage-backed securities
	
✓	Mutual funds
	
✓	Rights and warrants of corporations listed on Canadian stock exchanges
	
✓	Savings bonds
	
✓	Treasury bills
	
No restriction exists on foreign property holdings within an RRSP. Check out 
the CRA’s Web site (www.cra-arc.gc.ca) for current information on the tax 
treatment of foreign property investments.
Retirement allowances
You can transfer retiring allowances (like severance packages and accumu­
lated attendance credits) directly into your RRSP, subject to certain limits 
and rules. For years of service from 1989 to 1995, inclusive, the contribution 
limit is $2,000 per year of service. For those years before 1989, an additional 
$1,500 can be contributed (for a potential total of $3,500 per year) for each 
year of service that you didn’t have a pension plan. For years of service from 
1996 and on, no additional bump contributions are permitted. Also, you can’t 
carry forward these unused RRSP contributions to future periods.
Locked-in RRSPs
When employees leave their workplaces, they may have a choice of either 
receiving a pension at retirement or transferring the commuted value of their 
pensions to another plan. Under strict Canadian law, the commuted value 
cannot be immediately paid out directly to the individual. Instead, the trans­
ferred commuted (actuarially calculated) value is either placed directly into 
another company pension plan or placed in a locked-in retirement account 
(LIRA), also referred to as a locked-in RRSP. Both are essentially the same thing.
With a regular RRSP, you can make a withdrawal at any time. With a locked-in 
RRSP, early withdrawals cannot typically be made. Furthermore, when you 
retire as early as age 55, or as late as age 71, the locked-in RRSP cash can be 
applied to purchase a life annuity or a life income fund (ask your tax adviser 
if one of these is a route you should consider). You may not be able to 
transfer funds into a RRIF (discussed in the next section). However, Ontario 
and other residents are now an exception and may be able to transfer the 
proceeds of locked-in RRSPs into a locked-in RRIF. This is another complex 
area beyond the scope of this book, so discuss it with your tax adviser when 
appropriate.

Part IV: Investment Strategies 
Registered Retirement Income Funds 
(RRIFs)
You have to terminate your RRSP(s) by the end of the year in which you turn 
71 years old. When the time comes, you can choose from three options:
	
✓	Withdraw the RRSP funds. The total of lump-sum cash withdrawn is 
included in your annual income.
	
✓	Transfer your RRSP into a RRIF. A RRIF is like an RRSP because the 
RRIF’s funds and income earned stay untaxed until they are withdrawn. 
You can exercise management control over investment decisions. 
However, you must withdraw a minimum amount from the plan each 
year, based on your age or the age of a younger spouse or common-law 
partner. The minimum amount to be withdrawn increases each year 
until age 94. At that time, the amounts become set at 20 percent annu­
ally until the plan is depleted.
	
✓	Buy an annuity providing a regular income for a set period of time. 
This may include your lifetime, the combined lifetimes of you and your 
spouse or common-law partner, a set period, or a combination of these 
time frames. The choices are wide open. No part of the RRSP will be 
taxed immediately on this type of transfer. The tax kicks in when the 
annuity payments begin to be received.
Take note that you can withdraw amounts over and above the minimum, 
although any excess amounts withdrawn will also become taxable in that 
year.
Registered Education Savings Plans 
(RESPs)
Registered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) are special plans that help you 
save for your child’s education. You can invest your RESP in a stock, mutual 
fund, GIC, or just about any other investment; your financial institution can 
guide you through the details.
You can also tailor your RESP for growth potential, interest income, or a bal­
ance between the two. We recommend the balanced approach. It may be a 
good idea for Canadian investors to add a few growth stocks to their RESP 
plans. However, we recommend that no more than 25 percent of a RESP’s 
holdings be represented by stocks. The balance should be income oriented. 
Educational savings are far too important to be placed at undue risk.

301
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
The lack of restrictions on foreign content allows you to take full advantage 
of the growth potential of international stock markets. Although the other 
rules behind RESPs are beyond the scope of this book, we will provide you 
with some more essentials:
	
✓	You can invest up to a lifetime maximum of $50,000 per child.
	
✓	Under a family plan, you can designate as many beneficiaries to the plan 
as you want.
	
✓	Contributions are not tax deductible to you but funds may be withdrawn 
tax-free at any time you wish.
	
✓	The income within the RESP grows on a tax-sheltered basis and is paid 
out as an Educational Assistance Payment (EAP) to qualifying beneficia­
ries who pay the tax themselves (meaning that in most cases there will 
be little or no tax to pay).
	
✓	Universities, community colleges, vocational and technical colleges, and 
universities outside Canada qualify.
	
✓	Beneficiaries have to attend an accredited post-secondary institution on 
a full-time basis.
	
✓	The program must be no less than three consecutive weeks (13 weeks 
if the educational institution is outside Canada) with at least ten course 
hours per week.
	
✓	Part-time students will be permitted to access up to $2,500 of their 
income and grants for each semester. Students will be required to be 
enrolled in a qualifying education program for at least 12 hours a month, 
in a course with a duration of at least three consecutive weeks.
	
✓	If the designated beneficiary does not pursue postsecondary education, 
another eligible beneficiary can be designated.
Invest inside or outside your RRSP?
At the outset of this chapter, we point out that 
the money you make on your investments 
draws different effective rates of tax, depend­
ing on the type of income you receive from the 
investment. Income you generate from your 
investments held outside of your RRSP will be 
taxed differently if it’s interest income, divi­
dends, or capital gains. But the variables and 
choices don’t end there.
You can choose to earn investment income 
either inside or outside of an RRSP — each 
option has different tax implications and other 
consequences. This is where it pays to under­
stand the tax treatment of various sources of 
investment income. This knowledge will make 
it easier to decide which investments should be 
in a tax-advantaged plan such as an RRSP, and 
which investments should be held outside of an 
RRSP. No one-size-fits-all formula applies here 
— only rules that can be carefully plugged into 
your personal financial objectives!

302
Part IV: Investment Strategies 
There’s a catch
If you have an RRSP or other tax shelter, you have a few obligations. You are 
required to identify any tax-sheltered investment deductions and to disclose 
the shelter identification number on your tax return. The folks who sold you 
their tax shelter products should provide you with the required filing forms 
and associated details, like the amount of the deduction.
	
Also be aware that you face a number of special rules regarding tax-shelter 
deductions, which can result in alternative minimum tax (AMT) or expose you 
to at-risk rules, where you are not allowed to write off more than the cost base 
of your investment.
Apart from this, your deductions for interest expenses will also be restricted 
if certain loans are deemed by the CRA to be limited-recourse debt. Limited-
recourse rules require that funds must be borrowed with bona fide arrange­
ments in place to repay the principal back within 10 years. It can’t be a make 
believe — or phantom — loan, with no intention to repay it within a reason­
able time period. Interest must be payable on a regular basis, at interest rates 
greater than or equal to those prescribed by the CRA. You have to be at full 
risk for the loan. Also, if you have limited-recourse debt, it’s not included in 
the cost base of your investment. This can potentially set the stage for high 
taxable capital gains.
Tax-Free Savings Accounts
Canadian stock investors now have another way to save on taxes. With the 
Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), you can put money aside in eligible invest­
ments and any growth in value is tax-free. You can use the funds from a TFSA 
to buy a new car, start a business, or take a holiday vacation. All Canadians 
can participate.
Perspectives on the RRSP debate
A popular view is that it may not be best to keep 
investments that generate interest income out­
side of your RRSP because interest income is 
more heavily taxed. If you hold investments 
inside your RRSP, your interest returns will 
be higher because your income is temporar­
ily sheltered from tax. But capital gains and 
dividends, on the other hand, are taxed at 
preferential rates. You may want to hold invest­
ments generating capital gains and dividends 
outside of your RRSP.
No one right answer applies; everyone has dif­
ferent personal and financial objectives. But 
seeking the advice of a financial or tax planner 
will likely help you to arrive at the best decision.

303
 Chapter 22: Keeping More of Your Money from the Taxman
Investigating the TFSA rules
If you’re Canadian, a resident, and 18 years or older, you can save up to 
$5,000 every year in a TFSA. The 2009 contribution limit for each qualified 
person is $5,000. (Periodically check in with your financial institution to see 
if future TFSA limits are scheduled to rise.) In the meantime, any unused con­
tribution room for 2009 can be carried forward and added to your 2010 TFSA 
contribution limit. Also, any withdrawals made in 2009 will create additional 
contribution room for 2010.
Your contributions aren’t deductible for income tax purposes. However, the 
investment income earned in your TFSA, including any capital gains, is not 
taxed even when you withdraw proceeds from the TFSA.
Another advantage of a TFSA is that income earned in a TFSA does not penal­
ize you in terms of your eligibility for federal income-tested benefits and cred­
its. You can even give money to your spouse to invest in his or her TFSA.
Comparing TFSAs to RRSPs
Although an RRSP is geared to your retirement, a TFSA is open for just 
about any use. Both allow you to accumulate wealth tax-free within the plan. 
However, RRSP contributions are tax deductible and can reduce your income 
tax up front; TFSA contributions, on the other hand, are not tax deductible. 
Also, RRSP withdrawals are added to your income and taxed at rates in place 
at that time. TFSA withdrawals are not included in your income, so they are 
essentially tax-free.
More details are available at www.tfsa.gc.ca; the site also includes a Tax-
Free Savings Account calculator that allows you to estimate TFSA savings 
amounts.

in the economy. Your savvy consumer instincts tell you much about what 
goods and services are great . . . or not so great. What do you like? What 
products do you see flying off the shelves? Do you see anything that throngs 
of fellow Canadian consumers are lining up around the block to buy? One of 
the greatest investors of our time, Peter Lynch, used to go with his wife to 
various stores and consumer outlets. He watched how consumers responded 
to what was offered. Whatever he found that was popular became a subject 
of research, which led to great stock picks for the Fidelity Magellan Fund, a 
stock mutual fund that he managed very successfully for years.

Take Notice of Praise from 
Consumer Groups
A company is only as good as the profit it generates, and the profit it gener­
ates is only as good as the revenues it generates. The revenues are based on 
whether customers are accepting (and shelling out money for) the company’s 
products or services. Therefore, if what the company offers is popular with 
consumers, that bodes well for profits and, ultimately, higher stock prices.
	
When you’re ready to invest in stocks, look for high consumer satisfaction. 
Review consumer publications and Web sites such as Consumer Reports 
(www.consumerreports.org) and read the surveys and consumer feedback 
information. Good publicity and word-of-mouth consumer satisfaction are 
things that Canadian investors should be aware of. Stock-picking expert Lynch 
sees this popularity with consumers as very valuable information. He likes to 
see what consumers buy because that’s where the company’s success starts.
Check Out Powerful Demographics
If you know that a company generates lots of profit from the teenage market and 
you find out that the teenage market is going to expand by 10 percent per year 
for the foreseeable future, what would you do? Exactly — you’d buy that com­
pany’s stock. If a company has strong fundamentals and appealing products or 
services and its market is expanding, that company has a winning combination.
	
Stay alert to growing trends in society. How are demographics changing? 
Which sectors of the population are growing or shrinking? What shifts are 
expected in society in terms of age or ethnicity? Check out the data freely 
available at the Statistics Canada Web site (www.statcan.gc.ca).
A market that’s growing in size isn’t an indicator all by itself (in fact, no 
indicator gives you the green light all by itself), but it should alert you to do 
some research. The fact that a strong company sees improving demographic 
shifts (translation: more potential customers) in its marketplace is a big plus.
Look for a Rise in Earnings
If a company earned $1 per share for the past three years and its earnings are 
now $1.20 per share (a 20 percent increase), consider this increase a positive 

309
 Chapter 23: Ten Ways to Profit Before the Crowd Does
harbinger. As the saying goes, “Earnings drive the market,” so you need to 
pay attention to a company’s profitability. The more a company makes, the 
greater the chance that its stock price will increase.
	
Some people wonder whether to invest in a company that was losing money 
and then finally turns a profit. Perhaps you’re considering the stock of a com­
pany involved in new, untested technology. Our advice is to be careful in this 
situation. In such a case, predicting whether a second year of profits will show 
up is hard, but of course, that’s what investors are hoping.
For the serious investor, a track record of positive earnings is important. 
Several years of earnings (especially growing earnings) are crucial in the 
decision-making process. As earnings rise, make sure the growth is at a rate 
of 10 percent or higher.
Say you’re looking at the stock Buckets-o-Cash Inc. (BOC). BOC had earnings 
of $1 per share in 2007, $1.10 in 2008, and $1.21 in 2009. First, you can see that 
the company is a profitable enterprise. Second (and more important), you can 
see that the earnings grew 10 percent each year. The fact that earnings grew 
consistently year after year is important because it indicates the company 
is being managed well. Effective company management has a very positive 
effect on the stock price as the market notices the company’s progress.
Growing earnings are important for another reason — inflation. If a company 
earns $1 per share in each year, that’s better than earning less or losing 
money. But inflation erodes money’s purchasing power. If earnings stay 
constant, the company’s ability to grow decreases because the value of its 
money declines as a result of inflation.
Check out Chapter 12 for an introduction to the importance of earnings.
Analyze Industries
Become a regular and informed watcher of a specific industry that shows 
great promise. Being aware of an industry’s progress and its promising poten­
tial is a great starting point to find a great stock before the rest of the crowd 
does. Start reading the trade magazines (ask your librarian for help), regu­
larly peruse the industry’s Web sites, and (if possible) attend trade shows 
and conferences. It’s easier to find a good stock this way than trying to scan 
the thousands of companies that span the entire economy. For more on ana­
lyzing industries, check out Chapter 17.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Stay Aware of Positive Publicity 
for Industries
When the media report that a company is doing well financially or that its 
products and services are being well-received by both the media and the 
market, that news lets you know that the company’s stock may be going 
places. This positive publicity ties in nicely with the point made earlier in 
this chapter about consumer acceptance for the company’s products and 
services.
	
Positive press and consumer acceptance are important because they mean 
the company is doing what’s necessary to please its customers. The positive 
media coverage also may attract new customers to the company. Gaining cus­
tomers means more sales and more earnings, which translates into a higher 
stock price. You can find corporate publicity articles at Web sites such as 
Canada NewsWire (www.newswire.ca); you can also track the industries at 
Industry Canada (www.ic.gc.ca).
Watch Megatrends
Watching the news and reading the headlines for megatrends (a trend that 
affects an entire country or major subsections of it) isn’t just an activity to 
pass the time. It’s a profitable pursuit because noticing what society at large 
is doing is a great early warning system. This is one of our favourite ways 
to pick winning stocks. We’ve even done some of the work for you (you can 
thank us later): take a look at emerging-sector opportunities in Chapter 18.
Keep Track of Politics
The storm clouds or pending sunshine in today’s political sphere can mean 
lots of rain or lots of light in the markets the following day. Stock markets 
tend to be reactive to positive or negative scuttlebutt in the world of politics. 
Politicians get a lot of coverage, especially during election season, which 
gives the stock investor an idea of what’s coming down the pike. When politi­
cians of all stripes start talking about, say, the need to be environmentally 
sensitive and how industry should go green, that tells you something (like 
that you should invest in eco-friendly companies). When politicians get 
elected and their agenda becomes obvious (raise taxes, increase regulations, 
provide incentives for activity X, and so on), those actions deserve further 
investigation for investment potential.

Keep a regular eye on popular publications and Web sites that delve into the 
world of Canadian and international politics. Visit Web sites such as www.
ctv.ca/news and www.cnn.com regularly. Some financial publications, such 
as The Kiplinger Letter (www.kiplinger.com), also make a point of watching 
U.S. political trends. A Canadian alternative is This Magazine (this.org/maga­
zine) which is focused on Canadian politics, social trends, and more. Flip to 
Chapter 11 for more on the effect of politics on stock investing.
Recognize Heavy Insider 
or Corporate Buying
Company insiders (such as the CEO and the treasurer) know more about 
the company’s health than anyone else. If insiders are buying stock by the 
boatload, these purchases are certainly a positive sign for investors. Chapter 
15 thoroughly covers insider trading, but we highlight the main points here. 
Insiders can do one of two things:
	
✓	Buy stock for themselves: If individuals such as the CEO or the trea­
surer are buying stocks for their personal portfolios, you can assume 
that they think the stock is a good investment.
	
✓	Buy stock as a corporate decision: A corporation buying its own stock 
is usually considered a positive move. The corporation may see its 
own stock as a good investment. Additionally, corporate stock buying 
reduces the number of shares available in the market, potentially push­
ing the stock price higher.
All things being equal, either of these situations will have a positive impact on 
the stock price. Odds are you won’t see a stampede of insiders buying the stock 
in a day or week, but you may see it over a period of months. This is generally 
true simply because each insider has different circumstances, and insider buying 
is usually done on an individual basis. An accumulation of purchases tells you 
that members of the management team believe so strongly that the company will 
do well that they’re willing to put their own money at risk.
Follow Institutional Investors
You can generally break down the market into two basic groups: retail and 
institutional. Retail is you, me, and millions of other individuals. The institu­
tional group includes mutual funds like London Life’s mutual fund segment, 
hedge funds, pensions like the giant Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and 

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
other large entities. These large entities aren’t just private, corporate 
organizations — they now include governmental entities such as the newly 
formed sovereign wealth funds that are becoming direct participants in the 
markets. Sovereign wealth funds are government investment pools, funded 
by foreign currency reserves but administered separately from currency 
reserves for profit. Institutional investors can have a big impact on markets 
because they can move millions (sometimes even billions) of dollars in and 
out of markets.

such as Institutional Investor News (www.iinews.com), search engines on 
the Internet, and resources in Appendix B to get started.

hew! When you see the headlines out there, you tend to think that 
your money is like a balloon in a room full of porcupines — headed 
for trouble. Fortunately, successful stock investing (or just plain avoiding 
losses) isn’t that difficult to accomplish, even in a crazy market. This chapter 
lists some things to keep in mind when you want to be defensive about your 
hard-earned stock market profits.
Accrue Cash
	
Always try to have some extra cash on the sideline no matter how tempted 
you are to be 100 percent fully invested. You never know when buying oppor­
tunities may show up, especially in stocks you already own. Being in cash is 
its own form of diversification away from market risk.
Spread Your Money across Several Stocks
	
You should never have too much tied to a single stock because it’s way too 
risky. Spread your money elsewhere. As a general rule of thumb, you shouldn’t 
have more than 15 percent of your financial assets tied to a single company.

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Buy More of a Down (Yet Solid) Stock
	
Gadzooks! Your stock just went down like a lemming off a cliff! What a rotten 
day in the market. Now what do you do? Well, if you’ve chosen well (profitable 
company, good industry, and so on), then why not buy more? If you bought a 
solid, profitable stock at $44, then why not pick some up at $33? That way you 
can dollar-cost average a bit and end up with a better cost basis. When the 
inevitable rebound in the stock price occurs, you’re looking pretty smart.
Apply Long-Term Logic
Even if you’ve done your homework and chosen well, you may still find your­
self scratching your head and saying, “Holy Moly! My stock just went down. 
What the heck happened?!” It’s happened to us many times. You may make 
what you think is the greatest choice in stock market history and still see the 
price decline. What’s a prudent investor to do? Believe it or not, wait. Wait? 
Yes . . . wait. Markets move in irrational ways in the short term, but rational­
ity finally kicks in after a longer time horizon (such as 12, 18, or 24 months or 
longer).
	
Common sense takes over regarding a stock price over a protracted period. 
Long term, good choices go up and bad choices go down. Sooner or later, 
market participants (millions of both big and small investors) finally notice 
good companies and invest accordingly.
Use the Almighty Stop-Loss Order
Getting jittery about the market? What’s happening with your stock? Keep in 
mind that success with your stocks isn’t just based on what you invest in — 
it’s also based on how you invest. The stop-loss order is a perennial standby, 
and you should reach for it as often as the police commissioner reaches for 
the superhero hotline.
A stop-loss order is simply a conditional order that you put in with your bro­
kerage firm on a stock you hold in your account. If the stock is at, say, $50 
per share, you can put a stop-loss order in at $45 so that if your stock falls 
and hits $45, it’s automatically sold. Keep in mind that a stop-loss order is 

315
 Chapter 24: Ten Ways to Protect Your Stock Market Profits
also a time-related order; you can stipulate that it can be a day order or a 
good-till-cancelled (GTC) order. The day order expires at the end of trading 
that day, while the GTC order expires at a much later time (determined by 
the broker). Find out more about stop-loss orders in Chapter 21.
Use the Almighty Trailing-Stop Order
The trailing-stop order is a nice variation on the stop-loss order that we dis­
cuss in the preceding section. This order takes the stop-loss order a step fur­
ther by making it move upward with the stock but not budging on the down 
side. In other words, the stop loss trails the stock’s price upward but won’t 
adjust downward. You set the trailing stop at a percentage (or dollar amount) 
below the stock price.
For example, say your stock is at $50; you can set the trailing stop at 10 
percent below and make it a GTC order. If the stock falls to $45 (which is 10 
percent below $50), it’s then automatically sold to prevent further losses. But 
if the stock rises to, say, $60, the trailing stop adjusts upward and would then 
be at $54 (10 percent below the stock’s new price). Should the stock reverse 
and then fall, the trailing stop stays put at $54 and a sell order is then trig­
gered. At that point you’ve protected 100 percent of your original investment 
($50 per share) and the $4 profit, too. Find out more about trailing stops in 
Chapter 21.
Set Up Broker Triggers
	
Don’t be gun-shy about broker triggers (like that pun?). These are just orders 
and/or e-mail alerts that brokers use to help their customers navigate the 
market environment. Is some news hitting your stock or its particular indus­
try? Triggers act like an early warning system when certain events and condi­
tions occur so that you can act on them (by buying or selling your stock). 
Many brokerage firms have Web sites that allow you to customize your 
orders. In addition, Web sites such as www.marketwatch.com and www.
bloomberg.com can e-mail you news alerts on stocks and market news. You 
can find out more about broker orders (such as trade triggers) in Chapter 21.

Consider the Put Option
A put option is a speculative vehicle that helps you make money when you 
bet on an investment (such as a stock) going down. Put options are beyond 
the scope of this book, but that doesn’t mean we can’t whet your appetite 
about something we feel is a good alternative to simply watching your invest­
ment decrease. The type of put option we want to mention is referred to as a 
protective put.
Many people buy puts when they’re betting (and hoping) that a particular 
stock will go down. Of course, if you own that particular stock, you certainly 
aren’t hoping that it goes down, but you can get a protective put as a form of 
insurance in case the stock does decline. In this case you buy a put on your 
own stock. If the stock goes down (temporarily), your protective put goes 
up. You can then hold on to the stock and sell the put option at a profit. The 
profit you make on the put can offset (wholly or partially) the temporary 
decline in the stock.
Check Out the Covered Call Option
Writing covered call options is a good way to generate income from an exist­
ing stock in your portfolio. Simply stated, a covered call option is a vehicle 
that gives you a chance to make money from stocks in your brokerage 
account. It’s an ultra safe way to generate more income — as much as 10 per­
cent, 15 percent, or more — from your stock position.
	
Covered call options are beyond the scope of this book, but we recommend 
that you look into them, as they can be a safe wealth-building feature, even 
in portfolios that are temporarily down. You can find excellent tutorials and 
beginners’ information on both covered call options and protective puts 
(the topic of the preceding section) at places such as the Chicago Board 
Options Exchange (www.cboe.com) and the Options Industry Council 
(www.888options.com). For more on options in general, see Stock Options 
For Dummies by Alan R. Simon and Futures & Options For Dummies by Joe 
Duarte (both published by Wiley).

When All Else Fails, Sell
	
The most successful investors in history have taken their lumps. As the 
old adage goes, “Keep your winners and sell your losers.” You sell losers to 
minimize the downside. It’s easier to recoup a 10 percent or 20 percent loss 
in your portfolio on the whole than it is to recoup a huge loss in a particular 
stock. In addition, for what it’s worth, the losses are usually tax-deductible, 
which can at least help minimize the pain at tax time. (See Chapter 22 for 
details on handling taxes.)

ave you ever watched a movie and noticed that one of the characters 
coughs excessively throughout the entire film? To us, that’s a dead 
giveaway the character is a goner. Or maybe you’ve seen a movie in which a 
bit character annoys a crime boss, so right away you know that it’s time for 
him to “sleep with the fishes.” Stocks aren’t that different. If you’re alert, you 
can recognize some definite signs that your investment may be ready to kick 
the bucket.
Let the tips in this chapter serve as a symptoms checklist on your stock 
investment. This chapter helps you catch your stock as it starts to cough so 
that you can get out before it sleeps with the fishes. (We just can’t help you 
with mixed metaphors.)
Earnings Slow Down or Head South
Profit is the lifeblood of a company. Of course, the opposite is true as well — 
lack of profit is a sign of a company’s poor financial health. Watch the earn­
ings. Are they increasing or not? If they aren’t, find out why. Keep in mind 
that if the general economy is experiencing a recession, stagnant earnings are 
still better than robust losses — everything is relative. Earnings slowdowns 
for a company may very well be a temporary phenomenon. If a firm’s earn­
ings are holding up better than its competitors or the market in general, you 
don’t need to be alarmed.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Nonetheless, a company’s earnings are its most important measure of suc­
cess. Keep an eye on the company’s P/E ratio (see Appendix A for details on 
this ratio). It could change negatively (go up) as a result of one of two basic 
scenarios:
	
✓	The stock price goes up as earnings barely budge.
	
✓	The stock price doesn’t move, yet earnings drop.
Both of these scenarios result in a rising P/E ratio that ultimately has a nega­
tive effect on the stock price.
	
A P/E ratio that’s lower than industry competitors’ P/E ratios makes a com­
pany’s stock a favourable investment.
	
Don’t buy the argument that “Although the company has losses, its sales 
are exploding.” This argument is a variation of “The company may be losing 
money, but it’ll make it up on volume.” For example, say that Sweet Patootee 
Inc. (SPI) had sales of $1 billion in 2009 and that the firm expects sales to be 
$1.5 billion in 2010, projecting an increase of 50 percent. But what if SPI’s earn­
ings were $200 million in 2009 and the company actually expects a loss for 
2010? The business wouldn’t succeed, because sales without earnings aren’t 
enough — the company needs to make a profit. Remember that if you put your 
money in the stock of a company that’s losing money today with hopes that it 
will become profitable tomorrow, you’re not investing, you’re speculating.
Sales Slow Down
Before you invest in a company, make sure that sales are strong and rising. If 
sales start to decline, that downward motion ultimately affects earnings (see 
the previous section). Although a firm’s earnings may go safely up and down, 
sales should consistently rise. If they cease to rise, a variety of reasons may 
be to blame. First, the situation may be temporary because the economy in 
general is having tough times. However, it may be more serious. Perhaps the 
company is having marketing problems, or a competitor is eating away at its 
market share. Or maybe a new technology is replacing its products and ser­
vices. In any case, falling sales raise a red flag you shouldn’t ignore.
	
By the way, when we talk sales, we’re talking about the sales of what the 
company usually offers (its products or services). Sometimes a company may 
sell something other than what it normally offers (such as equipment, real 
estate, or a subdivision of its business), and this sale may make the total sales 
number temporarily blip upward. Watch for this because it can fool your per­
ception of the company’s financial strength. Maybe the unusual sale is due to 
financial or cash flow problems that the company’s experiencing. The bottom 
line is to simply check it out.

321
 Chapter 25: Ten Red Flags for Stock Investors
Debt Is Too High or Unsustainable
Excessive debt is the kiss of death for a struggling company. During 2000–02, 
many Canadian companies that experts thought were invincible went bank­
rupt. During 2008–09 many prominent businesses struggled with high debt, 
including brokerage firms (longtime Wall Street powerhouses Bear Stearns 
and Lehman Brothers collapsed into bankruptcy in early 2008), large regional 
U.S. banks, and that old standby General Motors. It’s getting so that stock 
investing is riskier than hang gliding in a hurricane!
	
Be aware of a company’s debt and solvency. Chapter 12 and Appendix A can 
help you read and understand a company’s financial data so that you can 
make an informed decision about buying or selling its stock.
Analysts Are Exuberant Despite Logic
Too often, analysts give glowing praise to stocks that any logical person with 
some modest financial acumen would avoid like the plague. Why is this? In 
many instances, the analysts have, alas, a dark motive (or something not so 
dark such as . . . ugh . . . stupidity). In any case, remember that analysts are 
employed by firms that earn hefty investment banking fees from the very 
companies that these analysts tout. In that situation, issuing a less-than-com­
plete or less-than-accurate report can be easy.
	
In fact, be extremely wary of analysts’ views, especially the analysts who make 
positive recommendations even when the company in question has worri­
some features, such as no income and tremendous debt. It seems like a para­
dox: Sell a stock when all the pros say to buy it? How can that be? The merits 
of any stock should speak for themselves. When a company is losing money, 
all the great recommendations in the world can’t reverse its fortunes.
	
Also, keep in mind that if everybody is buying a particular stock — the cur­
rent analysts’ favourite — who’s left to buy it? When the stock turns out to 
be a dud, you aren’t able to sell it because all the other suckers already own 
it (thanks to analysts’ recommendations). And if they already own it, they’re 
probably already aware of the company’s flaws. What happens then? You got 
it: More and more people end up selling it. When more people are selling than 
buying a stock, its price declines.

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Insider Selling
Heavy insider selling is to a stock what garlic, sunrises, and holy water are to 
vampires: an almost certain sign of doom! If you notice that increasing num­
bers of insiders (such as a company’s president, treasurer, or vice president 
of finance) are selling their stock holdings, you can consider it a red flag. 
In recent years, massive insider selling has become a telltale sign of a com­
pany’s imminent fall from grace. After all, who better to know the company’s 
prospects for success (or lack thereof) than its high-level management? What 
management does (selling stock, for example) speaks louder than what man­
agement says. (Do you hear that loud and persistent coughing again?) For 
more information on insider trading, see Chapter 15.
A Bond Rating Cut
It may seem odd, but the prospects for a company’s bonds are an indicator 
of the prospects for the company’s stock. Many firms issue bonds so they 
can borrow money to fund operations or new ventures. These corporate 
bonds are usually rated by major bond-rating agencies such as Standard & 
Poor’s. These agencies issue a rating on the bond with this question in mind: 
“Does the issuer of the bond (the company) have the financial wherewithal to 
pay back the bond principal and interest in full according to the terms of the 
bond indenture (the bond agreement)?”
	
If a company is rated as financially strong, the bond-rating agency will issue 
a high bond rating (such as AAA or AA). If the agency’s view of the company 
is generally negative, the bond rating for the company will be lower (such as 
BBB or lower). When a company’s bonds are downgraded it’s definitely a red 
flag for investors. Check out Chapter 9 for more information on bond ratings. 
Also be wary of the fact that these agencies often operate in a conflict of inter­
est scenario. In other words, to drum up and maintain business, they may 
issue a better rating than the client company being rated deserves. It keeps 
their clients happy!
Increased Negative Coverage
You may easily recognize unfavourable reports of a company’s stock as a 
sign to unload that stock. Or you may be a contrarian and see bad press as 
an opportunity to scoop up some shares of a company victimized by negative 
reporting. In any case, take the negative reports as a signal to further investi­
gate the merits of holding on to the stock or as a sign for selling it so that you 
can make room in your portfolio for a more promising stock choice.

323
 Chapter 25: Ten Red Flags for Stock Investors
Industry Problems
	
Sometimes, being a strong company doesn’t matter if that company’s industry 
is having problems. If the industry is in trouble, the company’s decline prob­
ably isn’t that far behind. Tighten up those trailing stops (see Chapter 21 to 
find out how).
Also, try to be aware of industries that are intimately related to the industry 
of a company’s stock you own or are considering buying. Very often, prob­
lems in one industry can affect or spread to a related industry. For example, 
plummeting auto sales may have a negative effect on prospects for auto parts 
or auto services companies. To find out more about industries, check out 
Chapter 17.
Political Problems
	
Political considerations are always a factor in investing. Be it taxes, regula­
tions, or other government actions, politics can easily break a company and 
sink its stock. If your company’s stock is sensitive to political developments, 
be aware of potential political pitfalls. Reading The Globe and Mail and the 
Wall Street Journal and regularly viewing major financial Web sites like www.
bnn.ca and www.bloomberg.com can help you stay informed. (We give you 
lists of sources in Appendix B.)
In recent years, drug and tobacco stocks in general suffered because of 
prevailing political attitudes. Also, the prices of certain stocks in particu­
lar (Microsoft in the late 1990s comes to mind) have dropped drastically 
because the companies were targets of government actions for such reasons 
as antitrust concerns and public safety issues. To find out more about politi­
cal considerations affecting stocks, go to Chapter 11.
Funny Accounting: No Laughing Here!
Throughout this book, we discuss the topic of accounting as an important 
way to see how well (or how poorly) a company is doing. Understanding a 
company’s balance sheet and income statement and making a simple com­
parison of these documents over a period of several years can give you great 
insights into the company’s prospects. You don’t have to be an accountant 
to grasp key concepts. Livent is a perfect example of how you can avoid a 
stock investing disaster with some rudimentary knowledge of accounting. We 

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
discuss window dressing (spotting the use of illegal or highly questionable 
accounting tricks) in Chapters 13 and 14. Livent used several of those tricks 
(like inappropriately deferring expenses and accelerating revenues at the 
same time).
Another classic example is Enron. Despite the fact that Enron hid many of its 
financial problems from public view, the information that was available made 
the message clear: “Danger Will Robinson! Houston, we have a problem!” If 
investors had done some simple homework, they would have plainly seen the 
following revealing points over a year and a half before the collapse:
	
✓	Enron’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio hit 90 in 2000. This stratospheric 
P/E kept most value investors (including ourselves) away.
	
✓	Its price-to-book (P/B) ratio hit 12. For investors, this ratio means that 
the market value of the company, compared to the company’s book 
value (also called accounting value), was 12 to 1 — for every $12 of 
market value, investors were getting only $1 in book value. When you 
consider that a P/B ratio of 3 or 4 is considered nosebleed territory 
for value investors, you can see that Enron’s P/B ratio was screaming, 
“Watch out below!”
	
✓	The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio hit an incredible 22. This ratio means that 
investors paid $22 in market value for every $1 of sales the company 
generated. When a P/S of 5 or 10 is considered too high, 22 is nosebleed 
territory!

Ten Challenges and Opportunities 
for Stock Investors
In This Chapter
▶	Understanding the most pressing concerns for stock investors
▶	Recognizing other markets that can affect stocks
▶	Spotting hidden opportunities with new economic megatrends
O
ver the years, we’ve found that the easiest way to make money with 
stocks (or to avoid losing money with stocks) is to simply be aware of 
the economic environment in which they operate. Stocks can be the best (or 
worst) investment depending on the economic/political environment. Many 
economic challenges face the stock market, including what’s happening with 
government policy, societal trends, and national/international geopolitical con­
ditions. In this chapter, we discuss the most important issues or megatrends 
that can affect you and your loved ones, as well as your stock investments.
	
You need to be aware of the big picture by regularly checking in with great 
Web sites such as Financial Sense (www.financialsense.com), Free-Market 
News Network (www.freemarketnews.com), and the Mises Institute (www.
mises.org). See Appendix B for more resources.
Debt, Debt, and More Debt
In June 2009, the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) surpassed the $14 trillion 
mark. Great! However, the total level of debt in the country surpassed $43 tril­
lion. Ugh . . . NOT great. What has kept the U.S. economy afloat and “growing” 
during the past eight to ten years is massive and pervasive debt that must be 
dealt with. Debt in just about every category is at record levels, including mort­
gage, consumer, margin, corporate, and government debt. The problem is that 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
this debt must be either paid off or wiped out through bankruptcy. In 2009, you 
saw financial catastrophes with debt gone bad in the U.S. banking and broker­
age industries. Canada was spared a banking catastrophe but still felt the ill 
effects of a damaging recession. The Canadian government also had to increase 
its debt load to stimulate the domestic economy, but by nowhere near the 
magnitude and increments underlying the U.S. stimulus plans.
	
Make sure you’re dealing with your debt level now. Reduce it as much as 
possible, and make sure you’re analyzing your stocks in the same light. 
Companies that carry too much debt are at great risk. If a company sinks, your 
stock will follow. If the company goes into bankruptcy, your stock’s value will 
be vapourized.
Derivatives
Derivatives are the largest financial market in the world. As of June 2009, the 
total dollar value exceeds $475 trillion. It easily dwarfs the world economy. 
Easily! Now, you don’t have to understand them, but you should be aware of 
what could go wrong if a derivatives problem occurs. Companies such as Bear 
Stearns and AIG imploded very quickly, primarily because of tragic errors in 
their derivatives portfolios. We would love to explain derivatives more fully, 
but it would take a whole chapter by itself. If you want a detailed explanation, 
sources such as www.wikipedia.com and www.investopedia.com do a 
fairly good job. Derivatives “accidents” have dotted the financial landscape 
over the past 10 to 15 years, and they had (and will have) the potential to do 
major damage to the stock market.
There’s no use fretting about derivatives. While you’re at it, you may as well 
worry about meteors and minority governments. Just take a common-sense 
approach to protect your portfolio as you grow your wealth. Stay away from 
firms that have large derivatives positions (typically banks and brokerage 
firms). Look into diversifying, trailing stops, and the other strategies dis­
cussed in this book and in the resources cited.
Real Estate
Real estate is one challenge the experts warned you about during 2004–05. 
By the time you read this, everyone will realize that the North American real 
estate industry is down dramatically from its former bubble highs, and in 
the U.S. in particular it’s languishing with record levels of foreclosures and 
unsold inventories of property (as of mid-2009). If you’re tempted to jump in, 
tread carefully, because a full, healthy recovery in a slow-moving market like 
real estate tends to take a long time. You’re better off waiting until the data 
from the industry become more positive.

327
 Chapter 26: Ten Challenges and Opportunities for Stock Investors
	
The message to you at this point is clear: Make sure you have your mortgage 
under control and your debt at a manageable level. Make sure the real estate 
industry is showing signs of solid recovery before you buy any stock of any 
related companies.
	
Some early signs of a recovery are at least three consecutive quarters of rising 
building permits and a steady shrinkage of the national inventory of unsold 
real estate, among others. A good site for real estate is www.realtor.ca.
Inflation
Inflation may soon become a major economic trend to watch. If it does mate­
rialize in a big way, you’ll want to be poised to defend yourself against it, and 
even benefit from it.
The reason why high (and rising) inflation is now a worldwide risk is because 
most major countries are increasing their money supply at double-digit gang­
buster levels. At the same time, however, the increase in money supply is 
being counteracted by deflation, which is mainly caused by unemployment 
and stagnant economic activity. The jury is still out as to the extent and 
timing of inflationary pressure, but you’ll definitely want to be prepared for 
major inflation if and when it comes.
	
Reassess your portfolio and avoid companies that may be hurt by rising infla­
tion (such as mortgage companies and other fixed-debt securities). Consider 
shifting more of your portfolio to companies that benefit from inflation (or at 
least aren’t hurt by it), such as those in the food, materials, energy, and pre­
cious metals sectors.
Pensions and Unfunded Liabilities
In 2009, the first wave of the 84 million Canadian and American baby boomers 
retire. The problem is that pensions for these folks will likely fall short. The 
latest data show that many pensions are underfunded, and many future retir­
ees are in for a rude awakening.
In addition, Social Security and Medicare in the U.S. (and Old Age Security, 
the Canada Pension Plan, and universal health care benefits in Canada) are 
certain to be gigantic challenges during the next few decades. As of July 2009, 
the total liabilities for these mammoth programs exceed $52 trillion in the 
U.S. and $67 billion in Canada. That’s not a typo; it’s a combined liability. 
Current beneficiaries likely will not be affected, but anyone under 65 certainly 
will be. Let’s face it: We’re living longer than ever before, and we need to be 
more proactive about our personal responsibility in our senior years.

328
Part V: The Part of Tens 
	
The message is clear: People need to save and invest more to fill in the finan­
cial gaps that seem to be inevitable. Stocks are a wealth-building tool that’s 
well-suited for long-term needs such as your retirement concerns. Start now, 
because the future has a way of sneaking up on you faster than you think.
The Growth of Government
Every economy has two components: private (consumers and producers) 
and public (government). No matter how you slice it, government is sup­
ported (think taxes) by the private sector. The total combined budget for 
federal, provincial, and local governments in Canada is $235 billion; in the 
U.S., it exceeds $6 trillion as of July 2009. The trend is for larger and more 
activist government, which entails higher overall taxes, increased regula­
tions, and other government growth (inflation, spending, and so on). History 
tells us that this isn’t a positive trend and that it can weigh very heavily on 
the finances of the private sector (translation: the stock market goes down). 
What’s an investor to do?
	
We repeat the message from throughout this book: Stick to stocks from com­
panies whose products or services address basic human needs, and under­
stand the good, the bad, and the ugly of government and its effect on the 
economy and financial markets (Chapters 10 and 11 are good places to start).
Recession/Depression
Recessions and depressions are actually a tie-in to the point in the previous 
section — they’re symptoms of excessive government growth and interven­
tion. In any event, Canadians and Americans have been trying to fend off a 
recession throughout much of 2009. We think that struggling economic times 
will still be evident when you read these words.
	
In rough economic times, the best stocks are defensive (food, beverage, utili­
ties, and so on), because people buy these things no matter how good or bad 
the economy is. Cyclical stocks will get beaten down, so it may be a good idea 
to shop around for real values after the economy turns around. Meanwhile, 
deploy protective strategies with your money, and play it safe with solid, 
financially sound companies.

 Chapter 26: Ten Challenges and Opportunities for Stock Investors
Commodities
In many respects, this decade resembles the 1970s. Stocks were having a 
dreadful time as inflation, the energy crisis, and international tensions esca­
lated. However, it was a great time to invest in energy, precious metals, and 
commodities. Gold and silver hit all-time highs by the end of the 1970s. Stock 
investors who scooped up shares of companies in these specific industries 
racked up tremendous gains.
	
The lesson for investors to understand is that conditions in this decade offer 
opportunities in natural resources that mirror the late 1970s. In addition, China 
and India are growing, and they’ll need more commodities (grains, base metals, 
energy, water, and so on) for their expanding economies and populations. As 
demand continues to outpace supply, the stocks of Canadian companies in par­
ticular that provide products and services in natural resources will shine.
Energy
Oil hit a recent high of $147 per barrel in early summer 2008. Although the 
price corrected (it was at approximately $70 as of mid-August 2009), the 
world’s appetite for energy (oil, gas, and so on) has caused prices to hit 
record highs, and the coming years promise more demand. The energy mar­
kets are experiencing a sea change that makes current conditions different 
and far more serious than in recent decades.
	
For stock investors, this at least means the chance to grow your money both 
directly (energy companies, obviously) and indirectly (alternate energy com­
panies). If you want your wealth to grow, you need to understand the impact 
that energy has on your portfolio. (See Chapter 18 for more on emerging-sec­
tor opportunities.)
Dangers from Left Field
Gee, after being beaten up by the previous nine points, what else do you 
need? This reminds us of the episode of Get Smart where the arch villain says, 
“You’ve been whipped, beaten, and tortured, but the picnic is over!” (We still 
use that great line at parties.) In any case, we hope we’ve impressed upon 
you that it’s a brave new world fraught with dangers for the clueless but filled 
with wealth-building opportunities for the clued-in. The fact is that no one 
knows what will hit our economy and society from out of the blue. Events 

330
Part V: The Part of Tens 
such as 9/11, the tsunami in Asia, and Hurricane Katrina certainly tell us that 
the world has unseen perils for us and our prosperity. Terrorism and other 
factors will have an impact. Fortunately, you can make changes — even slight 
changes — that can protect or grow your wealth.
	
Whether you’re talking about healthcare stocks that boom in response to new 
health threats or concerns (such as the H1N1 virus) or stocks of companies 
that prosper because of national security issues, your stock investing program 
can survive and thrive. Stay informed, and understand that successful stock 
investing doesn’t happen in a vacuum.

heck out the appendixes for resources that aid you 
in making informed investment decisions. In 
Appendix A, we explain financial ratios. These important 
numbers help you better determine whether to invest in a 
particular company’s stock. In Appendix B, we offer you a 
treasure trove of resources.

Appendix A
Financial Ratios
C
onsidering how many financial catastrophes have occurred in recent 
years (and continue to occur in the current headlines), doing your 
homework regarding the financial health of your stock choices is more impor­
tant than ever. This appendix should be your go-to section when you find 
stocks that you’re considering for your portfolio. It lists the most common 
ratios that investors should be aware of and use. A solid company doesn’t 
have to pass all these ratio tests with flying colours, but at a minimum it 
should comfortably pass the ones regarding profitability and solvency:
	
✓	Profitability: Is the company making money? Is it making more or less 
than it did in the prior period? Are sales growing? Are profits growing?
	
	You can answer these questions by looking at the following ratios:
 
• Return on equity
 
• Return on assets
 
• Common size ratio (income statement)
	
✓	Solvency: Is the company keeping debts and other liabilities under con­
trol? Are the company’s assets growing? Is the company’s net equity (or 
net worth or shareholders’ equity) growing?
	
	You can answer these questions by looking at the following ratios:
 
• Quick ratio
 
• Debt to net equity
 
• Working capital
	
While you examine ratios, keep these points in mind:
	
✓	Not every company and/or industry is the same. A ratio that seems dubi­
ous in one industry may be just fine in another. Investigate and check 
out the norms in that particular industry. (See Chapter 17 for details on 
analyzing industries.)

334
Part VI: Appendixes 
	
✓	A single ratio isn’t enough on which to base your investment decision. 
Look at several ratios covering the major aspects of the company’s 
finances.
	
✓	Look at two or more years of the company’s numbers to judge whether 
the most recent ratio is better, worse, or unchanged from the previ­
ous year’s ratio. Ratios can give you early warning signs regarding the 
company’s prospects. (See Chapter 12 for details on two important 
documents that list a company’s numbers — the balance sheet and the 
income statement.)
Liquidity Ratios
Liquidity is the ability to quickly turn assets into cash. Liquid assets are 
simply assets that are easy to convert to cash. Real estate, for example, is 
certainly an asset, but it’s not liquid because converting it to cash could take 
weeks, months, or even years. Current assets such as chequing accounts, 
savings accounts, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and inventory 
are much easier to sell or convert to cash in a short period of time.
Paying bills or immediate debt takes liquidity. Liquidity ratios help you 
understand a company’s ability to pay its current liabilities. The most 
common liquidity ratios are the current ratio and the quick ratio; the num­
bers to calculate them are located on the balance sheet.
Current ratio
The current ratio is the most commonly used liquidity ratio. It answers the 
question, “Does the company have enough financial cushion to meet its cur­
rent bills?” It’s calculated as follows:
Current ratio = Total current assets ÷ Total current liabilities
If Schmocky Corp. (SHM) has $60,000 in current assets and $20,000 in cur­
rent liabilities, the current ratio is 3, meaning the company has $3 of current 
assets for each dollar of current liabilities. As a general rule, a current ratio of 
2 or more is desirable.
	
A current ratio of less than 1 is a red flag that the company may have a cash 
crunch that could cause financial problems. Although many companies strive 
to get the current ratio to equal 1, we like to see a higher ratio (in the range of 
1–3) to keep a cash cushion should the economy slow down.

335
 Appendix A: Financial Ratios
Quick ratio
The quick ratio is frequently referred to as the “acid test” ratio. It’s a little 
more stringent than the current ratio in that you calculate it without inven­
tory. We’ll use the current ratio example discussed in the preceding section. 
What if half of the assets are inventory ($30,000 in this case)? Now what? 
First, here’s the formula for the quick ratio:
Quick ratio = (Current assets less inventory) ÷ Current liabilities
In the example, the quick ratio for SHM is 1.5 ($30,000 divided by $20,000). In 
other words, the company has $1.50 of “quick” liquid assets for each dollar of 
current liabilities. This amount is okay. Quick liquid assets include any money 
in the bank, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. If quick liquid 
assets at the very least equal or exceed total current liabilities, that amount 
is considered adequate.
The acid test that this ratio reflects is embodied in the question, “Can the 
company pay its bills when times are tough?” In other words, if the company 
can’t sell its goods (inventory), can it still meet its short-term liabilities? Of 
course, you must watch the accounts receivable as well. If the economy is 
entering rough times, you want to make sure the company’s customers are 
paying invoices on a timely basis.
Operating Ratios
Operating ratios essentially measure a company’s efficiency. “How is the 
company managing its resources?” is a question commonly answered with 
operating ratios. If, for example, a company sells products, does it have too 
much inventory? If it does, that could impair the company’s operations. The 
following sections present common operating ratios.
Return on equity (ROE)
Equity is the amount left from total assets after you account for total liabili­
ties. (This can also be considered a profitability ratio.) The net equity (also 
known as shareholders’ equity, stockholders’ equity, or net worth) is the 
bottom line on the company’s balance sheet, both geographically and figura­
tively. It’s calculated as
Return on equity (ROE) = Net income ÷ Net equity

336
Part VI: Appendixes 
The net income (from the company’s income statement) is simply the total 
income less total expenses. Net income that isn’t spent or used up increases 
the company’s net equity. Looking at net income is a great way to see 
whether the company’s management is doing a good job growing the busi­
ness. You can check this out by looking at the net equity from both the most 
recent balance sheet and the one from a year earlier. Ask yourself whether 
the current net equity is higher or lower than the year before. If it’s higher, 
by what percentage is it higher?
For example, if SHM’s net equity is $40,000 and its net income is $10,000, its 
ROE is a robust 25 percent (net income of $10,000 divided by net equity of 
$40,000). The higher the ROE, the better. An ROE that exceeds 10 percent (for 
simplicity’s sake) is good (especially in a slow and struggling economy). Use 
the ROE in conjunction with the ROA ratio in the following section to get a 
fuller picture of a company’s activity.
Return on assets (ROA)
The ROA may seem similar to the ROE, but it actually gives a perspective that 
completes the picture when coupled with the ROE. The formula for figuring 
out ROA is
Return on assets = Net income ÷ Total assets
The ROA reflects the relationship between a company’s profit and the assets 
used to generate that profit. If SHM makes a profit of $10,000 and has total 
assets of $100,000, the ROA is 10 percent. This percentage should be as high 
as possible, but it will generally be less than the ROE.
Say the company has an ROE of 25 percent but an ROA of only 5 percent. Is 
that good? It sounds okay, but a problem exists. An ROA that’s much lower 
than the ROE indicates that the higher ROE may have been generated by 
something other than total assets — debt! The use of debt can be a leverage 
to maximize the ROE, but if the ROA doesn’t show a similar percentage of 
efficiency, then the company may have incurred too much debt. In that case, 
investors should be aware that this situation could cause problems (see the 
section “Solvency Ratios” in this appendix). Better ROA than DOA!
Sales to receivables ratio (SR)
The sales to receivables ratio (SR) gives investors an indication of a compa­
ny’s ability to manage what customers owe it. This ratio uses data from both 

337
 Appendix A: Financial Ratios
the income statement (sales) and the balance sheet (accounts receivable, or 
AR). The formula is expressed as
Sales to receivables ratio = Sales ÷ Receivables
Say you have the following data for SHM:
Sales in 2009 are $75,000. On 12/31/09, receivables stood at $25,000.
Sales in 2010 are $80,000. On 12/31/10, receivables stood at $50,000.
Based on these data, you can figure out that sales went up 6.6 percent, but 
receivables went up 100 percent! In 2009, the SR was 3 ($75,000 divided by 
$25,000). However, the SR in 2010 sank to 1.6 ($80,000 divided by $50,000), 
or was nearly cut in half. Yes, sales did increase, but the company’s ability 
to collect money due from customers fell dramatically. This information is 
important to notice for one main reason: What good is selling more when you 
can’t get the money? From a cash flow point of view, the company’s financial 
situation deteriorated.
Solvency Ratios
Solvency just means that a company isn’t overwhelmed by its liabilities. 
Insolvency means “Oops! Too late.” You get the point. Solvency ratios have 
never been more important than they are now because the North American 
economy is currently carrying so much debt. Solvency ratios look at the rela­
tionship between what a company owns and what it owes. Here are two of 
the primary solvency ratios.
Debt to net equity ratio
The debt to net equity ratio answers the question, “How dependent is the 
company on debt?” In other words, it tells you how much the company owes 
and how much it owns. You calculate it as follows:
Debt to net equity ratio = Total liabilities ÷ Net equity
If SHM has $100,000 in debt and $50,000 in net worth, the debt to net equity 
ratio is 2. The company has $2 of debt to every dollar of net worth. In this 
case, what the company owes is twice the amount of what it owns.

338
Part VI: Appendixes 
	
Whenever a company’s debt to net equity ratio exceeds 1 (as in the example), 
that isn’t good. In fact, the higher the number, the more negative the situation. 
If the number is too high and the company isn’t generating enough income to 
cover the debt, the business runs the risk of bankruptcy.
Working capital
Technically, working capital isn’t a ratio, but it does belong to the list of 
things that serious investors look at. Working capital measures a company’s 
current assets in relation to its current liabilities. It’s a simple equation:
Working capital = Total current assets – Total current liabilities
The point is obvious: Does the company have enough to cover the current 
bills? Actually, you can formulate a useful ratio. If current assets are $25,000 
and current liabilities are $25,000, that’s a 1-to-1 ratio, which is cutting it 
close. Current assets should be at least 50 percent higher than current liabili­
ties (say, $1.50 to $1.00) to have enough cushion to pay bills and have some 
money for other purposes. Preferably, the ratio should be 2 to 1 or higher.
Common Size Ratios
Common size ratios offer simple comparisons. You have common size ratios 
for both the balance sheet (where you compare total assets) and the income 
statement (where you compare total sales):
	
✓	To get a common size ratio from a balance sheet, the total assets figure 
is assigned the percentage of 100 percent. Every other item on the bal­
ance sheet is represented as a percentage of total assets. For example, if 
SHM has total assets of $10,000 and debt of $3,000, then debut equals 30 
percent (debt divided by total assets, or $3,000 ÷ $10,000, which equals 
30 percent).
	
✓	To get a common size ratio from an income statement (or profit and 
loss statement), you compare total sales. For example, if SHM has 
$50,000 in total sales and a net profit of $8,000, then you know that the 
profit equals 16 percent of total sales.
	
Keep in mind the following points with common size ratios:
	
✓	Net profit: What percentage of sales is it? What was it last year? How 
about the year before? What percentage of increases (or decreases) is 
the company experiencing?
	
✓	Expenses: Are total expenses in line with the previous year? Are any 
expenses going out of line?

339
 Appendix A: Financial Ratios
	
✓	Net equity: Is this item higher or lower than the year before?
	
✓	Debt: Is this item higher or lower than the year before?
	
Common size ratios are used to compare the company’s financial data not 
only with prior balance sheets and income statements but also with other 
companies in the same industry. You want to make sure that the company is 
doing better not only historically but also as a competitor in the industry.
Valuation Ratios
Understanding the value of a stock is very important for stock investors. The 
quickest and most efficient way to judge the value of a company is to look at 
valuation ratios. The type of value that you deal with throughout this book is 
the market value (essentially the price of the company’s stock). You hope to 
buy it at one price and sell it later at a higher price — that’s the name of the 
game. But what’s the best way to determine whether what you’re paying for 
now is a bargain or is fair market value? How do you know whether your stock 
investment is undervalued or overvalued? The valuation ratios in the following 
sections can help you answer these questions. In fact, they’re the same ratios 
that value investors have used with great success for many years.
Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)
The price-to-earnings ratio can also double as a profitability ratio because it’s 
a common barometer of value that many investors and analysts look at. The 
formula is
P/E ratio = Price (per share) ÷ Earnings (per share)
For example, if SHM’s stock price per share is $10 and the earnings per share 
is $1, the P/E ratio is 10 (10 divided by 1).
	
The P/E ratio answers the question, “Am I paying too much for the company’s 
earnings?” Value investors find this number to be very important. Here are 
some points to remember:
	
✓	Generally, the lower the P/E ratio, the better (from a financial-strength 
point of view). Frequently, a low P/E ratio indicates that the stock is 
undervalued, especially if the company’s sales are growing and the indus­
try is also growing. But you may occasionally encounter a situation where 
the stock price is falling faster than the company’s earnings, which would 
also generate a low P/E. And if the company has too much debt and the 
industry is struggling, then a low P/E may indicate that the company is 
in trouble. Use the P/E as part of your analysis along with other factors 
(such as debt, for instance) to get a more complete picture.

340
Part VI: Appendixes 
	
✓	A company with a P/E ratio significantly higher than its industry average 
is a red flag that its stock price is too high (or that it’s growing faster 
than its competitors).
	
✓	Don’t invest in a company with no P/E ratio (it has a stock price, but the 
company experienced losses). Such a stock may be good for a specula­
tor’s portfolio but not for your retirement account.
	
✓	Any stock with a P/E ratio higher than 40 should be considered a specu­
lation and not an investment. Frequently, a high P/E ratio indicates that 
the stock is overvalued.
	
When you buy a company, you’re really buying its power to make money. In 
essence, you’re buying its earnings. Paying for a stock that’s priced at 10 to 20 
times earnings is a conservative strategy that has served investors well for nearly 
a century. Make sure the company is priced fairly, and use the P/E ratio in con­
junction with other measures of value (such as the ratios in this appendix).
Price to sales ratio (PSR)
The price to sales ratio (PSR) helps to answer the question, “Am I paying 
too much for the company’s stock based on the company’s sales?” This is a 
useful valuation ratio that we recommend using as a companion tool with the 
company’s P/E ratio. You calculate it as follows:
PSR = Stock price (per share) ÷ Total sales (per share)
This ratio can be quoted on a per-share basis or on an aggregate basis. For 
example, if a company’s market value (or market capitalization) is $1 bil­
lion and annual sales are also $1 billion, the PSR is 1. If the market value in 
this example is $2 billion, then the PSR is 2. Or, if the share price is $76 and 
the total sales per share are $38, the PSR is 2 — you arrive at the same ratio 
whether you calculate on a per-share or aggregate basis. For investors trying 
to make sure they’re not paying too much for the stock, the general rule is 
that the lower the PSR, the better. Stocks with a PSR of 2 or lower are consid­
ered undervalued.
	
Be very hesitant about buying a stock with a PSR greater than 5. If you buy a 
stock with a PSR of 5, you’re paying $5 for each dollar of sales — not exactly a 
bargain.

341
 Appendix A: Financial Ratios
Price to book ratio (PBR)
The price to book ratio (PBR) compares a company’s market value to its 
accounting (or book) value. The book value refers to the company’s net 
equity (assets minus liabilities). The company’s market value is usually dic­
tated by external factors such as supply and demand in the stock market. 
The book value is indicative of the company’s internal operations. Value 
investors see the PBR as another way of valuing the company to determine 
whether they’re paying too much for the stock. The formula is
Price to book ratio (PBR) = Market value ÷ Book value
An alternate method is to calculate the ratio on a per-share basis, which 
yields the same ratio. If the company’s stock price is $20 and the book value 
(per share) is $15, then the PBR is 1.33. In other words, the company’s 
market value is 33 percent higher than its book value. Investors seeking an 
undervalued stock like to see the market value as close as possible to (or 
even better, below) the book value.
	
Keep in mind that the PBR may vary depending on the industry and other 
factors. Also, judging a company solely on book value may be misleading 
because many companies have assets that aren’t adequately reflected in the 
book value. Software companies are a good example. Intellectual properties, 
such as copyrights and trademarks, are very valuable yet aren’t fully covered 
in book value. Just bear in mind that, generally, the lower the market value is 
in relation to the book value, the better for you (especially if the company has 
strong earnings and the outlook for the industry is positive).
