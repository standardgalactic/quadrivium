T
ales of the Park is an interactive
map showing the location of 15
3D-printed creatures dotted
around the Queen Elizabeth Olympic
Park in London, including bats, otters
and bees. There’s a clever twist if you
visit in person, because if you follow
the site’s instructions to set up the
Physical Web on your phone, you can
engage with the creatures as you get
near them.
The Physical Web is a Google
project that uses Bluetooth to extend
the web to everyday objects. Each
creature contains a low-energy
Bluetooth beacon that broadcasts its
presence and sends your phone a
notification when you wander past,
inviting you to chat. The creatures
use chatbots to hold conversations
and the map tells you what they like
to discuss. Moonlight the Bat, for
instance, will talk about the history of
the Olympic Park while Super Gnome
will discuss new buildings in the area.

If you’ve created a Bitmoji avatar in Snapchat, you can now
project it into the real world using a new augmented-reality
feature. Take your snap and tap
the screen to see a variety of
Bitmoji World Lenses. Selecting
one creates a 3D animated
version of whatever your
phone’s camera is capturing,
letting you record and share
the result with friends. There
are different actions your
avatar can perform, such as
using a vending machine or
a fidget spinner, drinking
coffee, dancing and waiting
for a bus. If you don’t have
a Bitmoji, tap the logo in the
top-left corner, select Create
Bitmoji and downlod the
Bitmoji app. Once you’ve
created your likeness, you
can link it to your Snapchat
account.

The BBC has created a new interactive ‘object-based’ radio
drama called The Mermaid’s Tears, recorded in immersive
3D audio. Created by the Beeb’s Research & Development
team, the series lets you tune into the perspectives of three
different characters. How you interpret what is really
happening is influenced by which character you choose, as
the evolving story is observed from their point of view,
conversations and internal monologues. To get the most
from the audio enhancements, you can choose to listen in
stereo,
surround-
sound or with
binaural
audio on
headphones.
You can also
rate the
project and
share it, and
check out
previous
audio
experiments.
Even if you can’t get to the Park, the
map is a fun way to see its layout,
including the striking 114.5m-tall
ArcelorMittal Orbit sculpture and the
80,000-capacity London Stadium.
It’s a great way to explore the Physical
Web and see how objects can be
connected to the internet.

Need to Know
8 4 - 17 October 2017
What happened?
Malware hidden in the clean-up tool
CCleaner was discovered to be targeting
tech giants including Microsoft, Google
and Samsung. The malware was spotted
by security firms Avast and Cisco, who
noticed malicious code hiding in
updates to CCleaner, the popular free
program that helps boost your system’s
performance by clearing unwanted junk
from your PC.
The dodgy code infected 2.3 million
computers and could have been used to
take control of those machines, stealing
and leaking details such as IP addresses
and network details. Although that
sounds serious, antivirus company
Avast – which now owns Piriform, the
developer of CCleaner – said there was
no need to worry because the criminals
behind the malware didn’t appear to be
exploiting the infections before the
problem was spotted and cleaned up.
Subsequent investigations revealed
that the attack wasn’t targeting
CCleaner users but specific technology
firms. Although millions of computers
were infected, the hackers were only
after a few dozen machines, in particular
systems located at companies including
Google, Microsoft, Samsung and Sony,
as well as Cisco, one of the firms that
first spotted the attack.
The hackers used the malicious code
hiding in CCleaner to install backdoors
in at least 20 computers. Backdoors
allow hackers to sneak into networks,
where they can install more malware to
steal key data. It’s not clear how
successful the hackers have been in
targeting the companies, or if other
organisations were also attacked.
Security experts suggested that the
sophistication of the attack meant the
criminals behind it were serious and
could be working at state level – maybe
spies looking to nab intellectual
property or other engineering secrets
from the target companies.
How will it affect you?
If you use CCleaner, make sure you’re
running the most recent version, which
has been updated to fix the attack. The
risk only affected those using a specific
version of CCleaner installed on a 32-bit
machine between the middle of August
and the middle of September, which
comprises about 3% of its user base.
Some security experts have warned
that anyone who ran the infected
version of CCleaner should take extra
steps to safeguard their systems,
because the infection’s sophisticated
two-step nature could mean your PC
still has malware lurking, waiting to
strike. If that’s the case, you may need
to back up your data and reformat your
hard drive. Check Piriform’s blog (www
.piriform.com/blog) to see any fresh
information the company uncovers
about the attack, in case further
security measures are recommended
However, it’s big companies with
valuable intellectual property that were
the target, not individuals, so most of us
have nothing to fear from the attack.
What do we think?
This is a particularly scary attack
because CCleaner is legitimate
software, and keeping it up to date is
recommended security advice. Using
the product to remove unwanted data
from your PC is a wise move for
performance and security – more code
means more chance to be hacked – and
it’s always a good idea to keep your
programs updated.
In this case, that advice would have
left you at the mercy of unknown
hackers. CCleaner is a trusted program,
so sneaking in malware via an update
is an ingenious and devious attack. We
often advise against installing software
and apps of unknown or questionable
origin, but wouldn’t hesitate to
recommend CCleaner. It’s even owned
by an antivirus firm, Avast, which makes
it feel all the more trustworthy.
In fact, there’s very little the average
user can do to avoid this type of attack.
We need to be able to trust software
developers to keep us safe, but this
incident shows that’s not always
possible. The usual advice of installing
only from trusted sources and keeping
software up to date still applies, but it
won’t stop all attacks – there’s no way to
guarantee 100% safety online.

What we think of this fortnight’s top tech news stories and rumours,
and how they affect you
4 - 17 October 2017 9
Discuss web news at forum.webuser.co.uk
Need to Know
What happened?
Google has once again
stepped into the
smartphone hardware
market, picking up a $1bn
share of troubled phone
manufacturer HTC. The
Android developer is
picking up half of HTC’s
R&D (research and
development) team and
getting a non-exclusive
licence to some of its
hardware ideas in the form
of intellectual property.
It’s not the first hardware
purchase by Google. It
bought Motorola in 2011,
before selling it three years
later to Lenovo.
How will it affect you?
If you’re a fan of HTC
phones, you should
consider Google’s
investment as good news:
the Taiwanese hardware
manufacturer has been
struggling to compete in a
competitive market and
the $1bn cash injection will
give it another chance to
keep its phones in the
shops.
Google’s influence at the
company could also lead to
more handsets running
so-called ‘vanilla Android’,
Google pays $1bn
for slice of HTC
a clean version of the
mobile operating system
without the extras
frequently loaded by
manufacturers, such as
apps that won’t uninstall
and branded interface and
design tweaks.
If you’re keen to avoid
such additions, your only
option right now is to buy a
Google Pixel phone, which
– at £599 for the base
model – is far from cheap.
HTC makes the current
version of the Pixel, so
hopefully this partnership
will lead to a budget
version.
What do we think?
This is a sensible move by
HTC, which once sold 10%
of smartphones worldwide
but is now lucky to shift
one in a hundred. The extra
cash from Google and the
ensuing R&D support will
hopefully help the brand
recover and could lead to
more phones from Google
itself or devices from HTC
offering handsets without
any extra software and
apps overlaid on Android.
Both would be welcome
additions to the Android
smartphone market.
What
happened?
The government
has reportedly
accused
WhatsApp of
creating a “black
hole” in security
intelligence by
refusing to give
it access to
people’s
encrypted messages.
Sky News quoted an
anonymous security
source, who claimed that
terrorists are “frequent
users” of encrypted apps
because they know no one
can read their messages.
“It is crucially important
that we can access their
communications – and
when we can’t, it can
provide a black hole for
investigators,” the source
added. Other
communication platforms
such as iMessage and
Telegram also protect their
users’ messages via
encryption and do not
allow the government
access to the information.
The news comes after
Theresa May stressed that
technology companies
should do more to help the
government identify
security threats, following
the bucket-bomb attack at
Parsons Green Tube
station.
How will it affect you?
WhatsApp encrypts the
content of your messages
but it still allows the
authorities to see other
data such as your account
name, when the account
was created, the last
Government attacks
WhatsApp security
known IP address used to
access the service and the
email address associated
with your account. This
suggests that it isn’t
completely watertight for
private communications –
especially if you’re
engaging in illegal
activities.
But WhatsApp has made
it clear it wants to protect
its users, and this means
messages must stay
encrypted and hidden from
authorities, just as they are
kept safe from criminals.
What do we think?
Encryption remains a
thorny issue – nobody
wants terrorists and other
criminals to have a safe
haven where they can
evade the authorities. Yet
law-abiding individuals
have a right to privacy.
WhatsApp itself says:
“We carefully review,
validate, and respond to
law enforcement requests
based on applicable law
and policy, and we
prioritise responses to
emergency requests.”
Forcing the service to stop
encrypting messages will
only entice criminals to use
lesser known and less
cooperative tools.

Fitbit Ionic
www.fitbit.com/uk/ionic
Fitbit’s Ionic is the company’s first
stab at a proper smartwatch. No
stranger to wearables, its previous
devices such as the Fitbit Blaze have
all been more akin to fitness trackers
than smartwatches.
As with previous Fitbit devices,
the Ionic’s main module can be
attached to a range of different
straps. It comes with an impressive
feature list including built-in Wi-Fi,
GPS, NFC for contactless payments
and Bluetooth for connecting to other
devices.
Its new SpO2 monitor, which tracks
blood oxygen levels, is another
standout feature, alerting users to
sleep apnea as well as offering more
advanced insights into your workout.
soon, including ones from the likes of
Starbucks and AccuWeather.
Overall, we were impressed with the
Ionic. The only drawback is the price,
which at £300 is fairly steep – more
than Huawei’s excellent Watch 2,
which also offers cellular connectivity.
It’s similarly priced to the
Samsung Gear S3 and
Apple Watch 2, but you
can’t help feeling
Fitbit missed a trick
by failing to undercut
the competiton.
However, if you like
the look of the Ionic,
it may be worth
waiting a few
months to see if its
price drops and for
more apps to become
available.
What happened?
The chief executive of Uber, Dara
Khosrowshahi, said he was sorry for
the “mistakes we’ve made” after the
taxi-hailing firm lost its London licence.
Uber’s reign in the capital looks to be
over, after Transport for London (TfL)
refused to renew the ride-sharing
service’s licence. TfL said it concluded
that Uber “is not fit and proper to hold
a private hire operator licence”.
In a statement posted on Twitter, TfL
said that Uber’s approach and conduct
“demonstrate a lack of corporate
responsibility”, and lists four points,
including Uber’s failure to report serious
criminal offences, its approach to
medical certificates and its approach to
how Enhanced Disclosure and Barring
Service (DBS) checks are obtained.
The news came as a huge blow to
Uber, which has been beset by problems
over recent months, though the decision
by a major city to strip Uber of its licence
marks a new low point for the company.
Uber responded by saying it will
“immediately challenge” TfL’s decision
in the courts, but accepts it “must
change”. Mr Khosrowshahi said: “While
Uber has revolutionised the way people
move in cities around the world, it’s
equally true that we’ve got things wrong
along the way. On behalf of everyone at
Uber globally, I apologise for the
mistakes we’ve made.”
Uber apologises after London ban
How will it affect you?
If you’re a regular Uber passenger, you
may be dismayed by TfL’s decision:
more than 3.5 million people who live
and work in London use the service to
travel, primarily because it’s cheaper
and more convenient than hiring a black
cab. Indeed, at the time of writing, more
than 750,000 people had signed a
petition to restore the firm’s licence.
Uber also has more than 40,000
drivers in London, who will now be
deprived of regular income, although
the company refused to grant them
workers’ rights until forced to by a
tribunal panel. It’s possible that Uber
cars could remain on the roads while the
appeal goes through the courts.
What do we think?
This was a surprise decision by TfL, but
an understandable one: Uber repeatedly
avoided taking responsibility for the
criminal conduct of some of its drivers,
its lax security checks and its disregard
towards its workers, passengers and
rivals. However, there’s a strong chance
that the ruling will be overturned, as it
was in Italy in July, if Uber agrees to
compromise and improve its business
practices – especially given the level of
public support for the company.
Like the more expensive Fitbit fitness
trackers, the Ionic also offers constant
heart-rate monitoring.
The Ionic provides 2.5GB of onboard
storage – enough space for roughly 300
songs – and it’ll run for an impressive
10 hours (with GPS enabled and music
playing) from a single charge.
If you use the watch
sparingly, you can expect
it to last up to four days.
Rather than running
on Android Wear, Fitbit
has opted to use its
own operating system,
Fitbit OS, and it’s
a sleek and speedy
experience – at least, at
first glance. There aren’t
yet loads of apps but
Fitbit has promised that
more will become available

or TV, can lead to back pain and leg cramps, so why not improve your posture
with a Drim Drum? Created by a physiotherapist, this exercise device loosens
your lower back muscles and strengthens your spine, and it “only takes two
minutes a day to feel the difference!”. Available in two colours and sizes, so you
can choose the correct one for your weight, Drim Drum also comes with a
how-to training video to guide you through 10 back exercises. The project has
already raised £4,000 of its £14,000 goal. Funding closes on 20 October.
Most Facebook users know about
how the social network’s targeted
advertising works – you look in an
online store for a certain item
and, minutes later, an advert for
that very product pops up on
your screen.
Now it’s rumoured that
Facebook plans to start tracking
the shops you visit in real life, too.
Facebook has brought in new
tools for advertisers that tell
businesses whether you’ve been
to one of their high-street shops
– if you share your location services
with the app, that is.
Some of the companies already
involved in this scheme include US
department store Macy’s and fast-food
chain KFC. “We recently partnered with
Facebook to activate their offline
conversions solution to drive in-store
sales,” said Tessa Kavanaugh, director of
social and emerging platforms at
Macy’s. “We are encouraged by the
positive results we saw in-store and are
excited to continue testing Facebook’s
Will Facebook track us on
the high street?
What’s new on Kickstarter
Our favourite new project on the crowdfunding site
offline suite to fuel our growth.”
Facebook is not the first tech firm
to track its customers’ whereabouts
in this way. Google’s Store Sales
Measurement scheme lets the tech
giant track customers’ credit-card
transactions – both online and in
‘brick-and-mortar’ shops. However,
a leading privacy rights group is
calling on the US Federal Trade
Commission (FTC) to investigate
Google, alleging the company is
trying to bind people’s online
behaviour to offline shopping habits.

LIKELIHOOD RATING
✓✓✓✓✓
We certainly wouldn’t put it past
poor, cash-strapped Facebook
(projected turnover for 2017: $36bn)
to expand its advertising business
to the high street. Fortunately, you’ll
be able to block offline tracking by
turning off location sharing, but this
will also prevent you from ‘checking
in’ to places and letting friends
know where you are. It seems
there’s no escape from the
ubiquitous social network.

THIS ISSUE’S EXPERT:
Marty P Kamden, CMO
of NordVPN
(www.nordvpn.com)
Q
Will a VPN keep
me completely
private and
anonymous online?
Richard Gould, Facebook
A
A VPN encrypts
your internet
traffic and sends
it via a secure tunnel
between your computer
and the VPN server. No
one can access the data
that passes through this
Equifax sends customers
to fake site
Following the announcement that
its systems had been hacked,
credit-monitoring firm Equifax’s woes
continued with reports that it was
inadvertently sending customers to
a fake site. Equifax set up a website,
www.equifaxsecurity2017.com, as
a hub for concerned customers
looking for help and advice. However,
security experts criticised the site for
looking like something a scammer
would set up and said Equifax should
have hosted the hub on its own
equifax.com site. To prove the point,
security researcher Nick Sweeting set
up an almost identical-looking fake
site at securityequifax2017.com.
Equifax’s official Twitter account
then began directing people to the
fake site by mistake. The tweets were
sent sporadically over a two-week
tunnel and it’s invisible to
everyone, including ISPs,
government snoopers,
identity thieves and hackers.
However, there are still
misconceptions about VPNs
and how they can be useful
to an average internet user.
Here are three to consider:
1
Whatever they claim, all
VPNs log user traffic
Some VPN providers don’t
have a choice because
the country in which they
operate may legally require
them to log their users’
internet activity. And when
user information is logged,
it can easily be shared with
the government and other
third parties.
However, if a VPN operates
from a country where traffic
logs are not required by law,
it will delete user activity
after each session and there
are no obstacles to stop it
running a log-less service.
2
Free VPNs offer the same
level of protection
A VPN provider offering a
free service still has to earn
money to pay for expensive
server maintenance and
other overheads, such as
staff salaries. Most often,
it will do this by selling user
data. For this reason alone,
paid-for VPNs are safer. They
usually offer faster speeds
and other advantages, too.
3
VPNs slow down
internet traffic
A VPN can sometimes slow
down the internet. If the
slowdown is noticeable, the
VPN may be experiencing
temporary technical
problems, but if it’s always
slow, you may need to
switch to another provider.
Paid-for VPNs usually offer
a wider selection of servers
to connect to – so when
one is heavily loaded and
slow, it’s easy to connect
to another one. Connecting
to a server that’s closer
geographically may solve
the speed problem.

Malicious plugin infects
WordPress sites
Hackers used a WordPress plugin to
install backdoors on up to 200,000
websites, allowing spam to be uploaded
to them. According to research carried
out by IT security firm WordFence, the
plugin, known as Display Widgets, should
be removed immediately by website
owners. The firm said that the plugin’s
last three releases have contained code
that allows the author to publish content
on an affected site.
“The authors of this plugin have been
using the backdoor to publish spam
content to sites running their plugin.
During the past three months the
plugin has been removed and
readmitted to the WordPress.org
plugin repository a total of four times,”
said Mark Maunder, CEO of
WordFence.
Maunder said that Display Widgets
was originally developed by its author
as an open-source plugin, but was then
sold to others on 21 June. The widget
was removed permanently on 8
September, and Maunder said that
people in the WordPress community
should not “start any witch hunts”.
“Occasionally plugins change
ownership and very
rarely, that doesn’t go
well. That appears to
be what happened in
this case,” he said.

Polaroid Originals
uk.polaroidoriginals.com
Polaroid stopped making instant-film
cameras a decade ago but a deal struck
in May has led to the name and concept
being resurrected. The result is a new
camera called the OneStep 2 that’s a
modern take on the iconic snapper of the
Seventies and this site has the full
lowdown. Using vivid images, it gives an
impressively close-up look at the product
and lets you view (and buy) a range of
vintage cameras that have been brought
back to life by refurbishers. You can also
view great-looking photographs shot by
users with the various cameras and read
a collection of articles. It’s sure to give
you instant gratification.
Where Are The
Poppies Now?
www.wherearethepoppiesnow
.org.uk
Back in 2014, to mark the centenary of
the start of World War One, 888,246
ceramic poppies were installed at the
Tower of London, one for each British
and colonial life lost during the conflict.
Most of the poppies were later bought by
the public and this site marks where they
ended up. Purchasers can sign up and
“plant” their poppy on a map, then add
their story. It also has details of the
locations of two more poppy sculptures,
currently touring the UK.

How To Fix A Toilet
how-to-fix-a-toilet.com
Have you ever asked Google how to boil an egg, make money, put on a tie or fix a
toilet? If not, then you’re probably in the minority. This fun interactive essay, created
by a visual-data journalist in collaboration with Google’s New Lab, shows the number
of times such requests are made. By typing in a country and scrolling down, you can
hover over the various “how tos” and see how often people searched for them. You
can also click through to the Google results or simply enjoy the readable commentary
and trending patterns. It’s a fascinating insight with some wry observations and
entertaining animations, though you are rather forced to read from beginning to end.

Allergy Travels
allergytravels.com
If you have a food allergy and worry
about triggering it when you are eating
out while abroad, then this website may
prove invaluable. The idea is that visitors
can leave tips about dealing with
allergies in specific countries while
saying which airlines best cater for
specific needs. At this early stage, the
site is still finding its feet – most of the
current reviews feel too general and the
pages lack a refined structure, making it
harder to find specific information.
Thankfully, related articles from the web

bridge the gap.

The price of ink cartridges is absolutely

retailers that let you print for less.
Cartridge Monkey’s improved search
engine and streamlined options make it
easier to locate the places offering the
best prices. We like the new quick-order

order as you build it, and we love being
able to quickly place re-orders when you
return. The new responsive design works
well, while the ability to save your printer,
take part in the free recycling scheme,

As well as selling electrical items and

World and Carphone Warehouse is intent

Team Knowhow has been rolled out to
more than 1,000 stores and this site lets
you book a repair. Its step-by-step
process is intuitive: choose the kit and
see the price. You can only book by
phone, although you can track repairs on
the site and get a sense of what they
involve. More impressive are the free kit
guides looking at setting up gadgets,
cleaning them and other tips. There’s
also info on support plans, trade-ins and
insurance, all wrapped in a cheery design.
Screen Daily

Screen International’s delightful
revamped website is sure to reel in large
numbers of film fans. The responsive
design works well on mobile devices and
the site now benefits from streamlined
navigation, larger images and better
integration with social media. It continues
to serve up an insightful diet of well-

while giving the lowdown on festivals,
box office figures and awards, as well as
the latest from the small screen in the TV
section. Annoyingly, there’s a hefty
charge for full access to the archive and
extra content, but there’s more than

The first item sold on eBay in the UK, back in 1999, was a CD by German rock band
Scorpions. Now it seems that eBay wants to sell more of them – CDs, that is – along
with books, comics, movies and games. This newly designed section highlights items
of interest, such as the new Foo Fighters album, and includes specific item categories
including vinyl, fiction, DVDs and specific consoles. Clicking a category narrows down
results, with some sections including items put together (or ‘curated’) by eBay. In
each case, new releases are highlighted. There’s a clever “shop the scene” feature
under DVDs, too, letting you buy items that appear in images from a TV show or film.

selling point is the live streaming of up to
10 games this season, along with preview

results, the league table and info about
the competing clubs. Each section is
accessed via the main menu, which can
feel quite clumsy, especially on a desktop,
and the need to adapt to mobile devices
has made the design rather spartan but,
on the plus side, the site puts content
first and is frequently updated.

Mindhunter
From 13 October
Netflix just can’t stop churning out original series. The trailer
for its new crime series Mindhunter – which boasts David
Fincher and Charlize Theron among its executive producers –
was released back in March, and we now know that it’ll be
premiering from Friday 13 October (a second season has
already been confirmed).
This 10-episode series is based on the 1995 true-crime memoir
Mind Hunter: Inside The FBI’s Elite Serial Crime Unit by John
Douglas and Mark Olshaker. The book chronicles an array of
gruesome serial-killer cases from the 25-year FBI career of
Douglas, who was the inspiration for Scott Glenn’s Jack Crawford
in The Silence Of The Lambs.
In Mindhunter, the Douglas character becomes FBI Behavior
Science Unit agent Holden Ford, played by Jonathan Groff,
who was previously in Glee and Looking. He’s paired with Anna
Torv, who’s best known for starring in Fox’s celebrated sci-fi
crime series Fringe and a mystery thriller series in her native
Australia called Secret City. The duo are joined by veteran
actors Holt McCallany, who appeared in key Fincher films
including Fight Club and Alien 3, and Cotter Smith, currently
seen in FX’s The Americans.

when Season 9 of Curb Your Enthusiasm
premieres on Sky Atlantic on 2 October.
NOW TV Entertainment pass holders
can stream Seasons 1-8 of the comedy
series (until 14 December), so we hope
they’ll also be able to watch the new
shows once they’ve been broadcast.
Most of the series’ long-standing

Richard Lewis and Marty Funkhauser,
are expected to return, along with guest
appearances from the likes of Jimmy
Kimmel, Judge Judy and Bryan
Cranston (Breaking Bad).

A group of young friends embark on
what seems at first to be the perfect
holiday, taking over a neglected ski
resort to enjoy exclusive use of the
scenic slopes. However, they’re soon
haunted by a series of disturbing events,
which reveal exactly why the place was
abandoned so many years before. The
script of this eight-part BBC4 Swedish
thriller jumps between Swedish, Danish
and Norwegian, so there are subtitles to
translate. The BBC warns that it
contains adult themes, so it’s probably
not one to watch with all the family!

name, which depicts the rise and fall of
the gangsta rap group, is now available

Eazy-E, Aldis Hodge as MC Ren, Neil

What To Watch Online

Speed up and slow down
videos on YouTube app
It’s been possible to change the
playback speed of videos on the web
version of YouTube for several years,
and now you can do the
same on the mobile app
(for iOS and Android
5.0+). Apparently, the
most frequently used
speed setting on the
web is 1.25x because –
like speed listening and
speed reading – it lets
you consume the same
amount of information
that little bit faster.
Slow speeds, on the
other hand, help you
to examine finer details, making sense
of practical tutorials or complex
choreography. To change a video’s
speed, open it, tap the three-dot button
and choose Playback Speed. The fastest
option is 2x, while the slowest is 0.25x.
Install Amazon Prime Video
direct from Google Play
In the past, if you wanted to stream
Amazon Prime Video on an Android
device, you had to install Amazon
Underground and then download an
Amazon Video app from within it (after
first enabling the installation of apps
from Unknown Sources in your device’s
Settings). This caused a lot of frustration
for some users, especially because an
app for iPhones and iPads was available
directly from the Apple App Store. Now,
Amazon has finally released a dedicated
Amazon Prime Video app (bit.ly/
amazonvideo433), which you can install
directly from
the Google Play
Store, so it’s
much more
straightforward
to stream and
download
videos for offline viewing. Unfortunately,
the app doesn’t support the
Chromecast.
Enable subtitles and audio
descriptions in All 4
All 4 has been working to improve its
accessibility settings, so it’s now
possible to activate both subtitles and
audio descriptions on its Android app
(bit.ly/all433). Simply tap the ‘S’ or ‘AD’
icon in the player. These new functions
aren’t available for every programme
and you can only enable subtitles on
episodes that you stream, not those that
you’ve downloaded. To check if subtitles
are available for a programme, open its
episode information and look for a silver
‘S’ icon. Both functions are already
supported in the iOS version (bit.ly/
iall433) of All 4. To activate them,
enable VoiceOver and Subtitles, in
the iOS Settings.
Watch TV shows from Korea,
China and Japan
Viki (viki.com) is a streaming service
dedicated to breaking down the
language barriers that stop you
watching great content from China,
Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Thailand,
among other countries. It does this by
providing subtitles (submitted by
volunteers) in more than 150 different
languages – an
ambitious aim! You
can watch a wide
range of genres
(Drama, Romance,
Comedy, Costume &
Period, SciFi,
Fantasy, Action & Adventure) on almost
any device and as with most streaming
services, you get a one-month free trial
when you sign up.

Budget Android tablets Product Test
4 - 17 October 2017 23
Discuss this review at forum.webuser.co.uk
32GB model rather less
attractive when you consider
that a 16GB microSD card can
be picked up for less than £8.
However, you may still prefer
to opt for the 32GB model if
you don’t want the hassle of
having to move apps and
games to a memory card.
The Fire HD is the most
colourful of the tablets
reviewed here, available in
black, yellow, blue or red. It’s
worth noting that there’s also
a version of the 32GB tablet
aimed especially at kids, with
a rubberised case and a
no-quibble two-year
guarantee, available for a total
cost of £129.99.
Pricing on the Vodafone
Smart Tab N8 is almost as
complicated. You can get it
for £129 on pay-as-you-go
from the Vodafone store,
which makes it more
expensive than the Fire HD 8,
but then it is the only tablet
here to offer 4G connectivity.
You can also get it on a
contract, with a 24-month 4G
plan starting at £12 per month
(£30 upfront) for 2GB of data
per month, rising to £31 per
month with no upfront costs
for 50GB of 4G data.
The Lenovo Tab 4 8 Plus is
much simpler, available with
16GB for £200 or 64GB for
£50 extra.
Build quality and design
The Fire HD 8 is 9.7mm thick,
weighs 369g and has a thick
bezel (the unused space
around the edge of the
screen), which makes it rather
chunky. However, it feels very
robust and well suited to the
rough and tumble of daily life.
At 7mm thick and 300g,
the Lenovo tablet is slim,
lightweight and elegantly
designed. Its rounded edges
make it comfortable to hold
and the glass on both front
and back gives it a premium
look. The distinctive forward-
facing speaker grilles are not
purely for decoration, either
– the tablet supports Dolby
Atmos and is by far the best
sounding of the three tablets.
Another key feature is its
fingerprint reader, built into
the power button, which sits
alongside the volume rocker
on the right-hand side of the
tablet, perfectly located for
unlocking the device.
However, we found it wasn’t
particularly reliable and it
rarely worked on the first try.
The Vodafone tablet’s large
10.1in screen made it the
heaviest of the three, at 465g,
although its 9mm case is
slimmer than the Fire HD 8’s.
Like the Lenovo, it also has
forward-firing speakers, while
the back has a textured black
plastic finish that makes it
easy to grip and prevents the
tablet from sliding around
when you put it down. This
houses a latch that gives
access to the 128GB microSD
expansion and micro-SIM slot
Performance
Start using the Fire HD 8
and it becomes clear how
Amazon has managed to
keep the tablet’s cost low. The
quad-core 1.3GHz MediaTek
MT8163 processor is adequate
but not particularly fast, and
is aided by 1.5GB of RAM,
allowing for very minimal
multitasking. As a result, it’s
not particularly well equipped
for dealing with high-intensity
games, only managing
7.1fps (frames per second)
in GFXBench’s Manhattan
3 test (see box, below).
However, simpler games such
as Threes and Temple Run
ran perfectly well, so some
light gaming is certainly
within its capabilities.
Inside the Lenovo tablet,
you’ll find a 2.0GHz octa-core
Cortex-A53-based
Snapdragon 625 processor
and 3GB of RAM. This
provides enough horsepower
to churn through intensive
processes and multitasking, as
was shown by its Manhattan 3

Product Test Budget Android tablets
Despite its shortfalls, Amazon’s latest Fire
HD 8 is an amazing tablet for the price.
At just £90 for the basic 16GB version –
without adverts – its excellent battery life,
superb build quality and decent
performance make it a great choice if you’re
looking to buy an affordable tablet.
At first glance, the Lenovo Tab 4 8 Plus
seems to be a fantastic device, with
hardware features above and beyond
Amazon’s, such as an integrated fingerprint
reader, two front-facing Dolby Atmos
speakers and splendid design. However,
even with these extras, the price is too high
for its sluggish performance and middling
battery life.
The Vodafone Smart Tab N8 is a mixed
bag. On one hand, it’s the cheapest 4G
tablet you can buy – just £129. On the other
hand, if you’re not bothered about
connecting to the internet while on the go,
it’s disappointing in other areas.
OUR VERDICT
We were more disappointed
that the pricier Lenovo is even
worse, managing only 59.2%.
The Vodafone Smart Tab N8
was the winner here,
achieving 75.7%, although
that’s still not much to write
home about.
Amazon’s screen also has
a relatively low resolution
(1,280 x 800 pixels) but it’s
the brightest, too, with a high
of 455cd/m2. That’s good
enough to be able to read
outside, even in sunshine. The
Lenovo tablet has a sharper
resolution of 1,200 x 1,920
pixels, and while not as bright
as Amazon’s screen, its
417.6cd/m2 means it’s
readable in most conditions.
The Vodafone’s resolution is
the same as Amazon’s (1,280
x 800 pixels) but its larger
10.1in screen translates to a
lower pixel density, so it
doesn’t look as sharp. Its
maximum brightness of
366.6cd/m2 is vivid enough
only a handful of Vodafone
apps pre-installed. The Lenovo
runs its own take on Android
but it’s relatively clean with
only a few pre-installed apps.
Like the rest of Amazon’s
tablet lineup, the Fire HD 8
runs Amazon’s Fire OS, which
is based on Android, but
different. It’s not quite as
flexible as your typical
Android tablet because you’re
tied into using Amazon’s
dedicated app store, as well
as most of its own services
such as Amazon Music,
Audible audiobooks and
Amazon Photos. So no
Google Play Store, no
YouTube app and no Chrome
browser.
As a result, anyone knee-
deep in an Amazon Prime
subscription will probably
benefit greatly, but non-Prime
customers or those less
familiar with Amazon’s
services may not find Fire OS
so inviting. Still, the latest
version is now much easier to
use since its awkward
carousel layout has been
abandoned in favour of a
more traditional grid system.
We’d definitely recommend
paying the extra £10 to get rid
of the ads, though.
benchmark result of 9.3fps.
That’s perfectly adequate for
casual gaming, but it still isn’t
a great performance if you’re
after slick, smooth games,
which is disappointing
considering how much more it
costs than the Amazon model.
Vodafone’s Tab N8 is the
worst performer. With a
1.1GHz quad-core Cortex-
MediaTek processor and 2GB
of RAM inside, it struggles
with multitasking and is slow
to respond to input. Opening
Google Maps and swiping
around is a painful experience,
and while it can handle very
basic games such as Candy
Crush, it struggles with
fast-moving games like
Temple Run. With only 3.1fps
in the Manhattan 3
benchmark, it’s just not built
with gaming in mind.
Battery life
When it comes to battery life,
the Fire HD 8 really shines.
Setting the screen brightness
to our predefined
measurement of 170cd/m2
(candles per square metre),
the Fire HD 8 managed
13 hours and 4 minutes of
continuous video playback,
which is hugely impressive
(see box, above). It’s by far
the longest-lasting Fire tablet
we’ve seen, surpassing both
the Fire HD 10 and Fire 7 by
around four hours.
The Lenovo and Vodafone
tablets provided less
impressive results in our tests,
though they came remarkably
close to each other: the
Vodafone lasted 9 hours and
44 minutes, 60 seconds
longer than the Lenovo.
Display
At well under £100, we never
expected the Fire HD 8 to
have an award-winning
screen, so its underwhelming
display of only 66% of
Microsoft’s sRGB colour
standard came as no surpise.
for indoor viewing, but you’ll
struggle to use it outdoors.
Android and Alexa
Voice assistants such as the
Amazon Echo and Google
Home are becoming
increasingly popular, so
Amazon’s decision to add
Alexa to its Fire devices is a
compelling one, effectively
gifting you a free Echo with
your tablet. Alexa responds to
your every beck and call, from
reading you an audio book to
telling you the weather. The
only stumbling block is that
you have to hold down the
Home button to attract her
attention – she won’t just hear
you if you call “OK Alexa”, as
she does with the Echo.
Despite this unique and
welcome bonus, there are
compromises you have to
make with an Amazon device,
the biggest of which is that
you’re not getting the
Android operating system as
Google designed it. We have
a preference for clean and
untampered-with versions of
Android and the Vodafone
tablet comes closest to this
– it’s the pure, unadulterated
Android 7 that Google wants
its users to experience, with
Amazon’s decision to add Alexa to its
Fire devices is a compelling one, effectively
gifting you a free Echo with your tablet

32 4 - 17 October 2017
Stop HTML5 videos playing
automatically
Autoplaying videos – particularly noisy
adverts – are becoming an increasing
annoyance, but because most are in
HTML5 format, Chrome doesn’t offer
a ‘click-to-play’ setting as it does for
Flash content. Until now, that is, because
the latest version of the browser (61)
adds an option that stops HTML5 video
playing automatically and allows you
to click to play it if you want. To access
and activate this secret setting, type
chrome:flags into the address bar,
press Enter and search (using Ctrl+F)
for ‘Autoplay policy’. Click the drop-
down menu for the entry, select ‘User
gesture is required for cross-origin
iFrames’ and restart Chrome. Note that
this trick won’t work for all HTML5
content, but it should make at least
some web pages less annoying.
Pocket is one of the most popular tools for saving web content
to read later, but its Chrome extension ‘Save to Pocket’ (bit.ly/
saveto433) has fallen foul of a Google policy that only allows
add-ons to have ‘single purpose’. To this end, Pocket has moved
one of the extension’s features – the option to view ‘trending’
stories on your New Tab page – to a separate add-on called
Pocket New Tab (bit.ly/pocket433). One benefit of this
separation is that you don’t need to be a Pocket user to see
the stories, although they’ll be more relevant to your interests
if you are. The articles are curated by Pocket’s 30-million strong
community and are updated every hour
to keep the content fresh. Click ‘More stories’
to access further selections or choose
a specific topic such as Tech or Health.
As with the traditional New Tab page, there’s
a Google search box, and you can also display
your most visited websites, albeit in the form of
logos rather than thumbnails of homepages.
You’ll need to grant Pocket permission to show
these, but it promises your data is kept private.
Feel lucky from the
address bar
When you search the web by typing
a term into Chrome’s address bar,
you don’t get the option to click
Google’s ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ button,
but there’s a workaround that adds
this time-saving feature. Go to
Settings, ‘Manage search engines’
and click Add, then enter a name
and keyword for the option – for
example ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ and
‘lucky’. In the URL line, type:
http://www.google.co.uk
/search?q=%s&btnI=Im+Feeling
+Lucky and click Save. Now, when
you want to use the I’m Feeling
Lucky feature, just type the keyword
into your address bar, press the
spacebar and enter your query.
Press Enter and you’ll be taken to
(hopefully) the most relevant result.
Manage your tabs or your
Tabagotchi dies
The more tabs you have open in
Chrome, the more memory it uses
and the more distracted you become,
but it’s
easy to
ignore the
risk until
it’s too late
and your
browser
crashes.
A new
extension
called
Tabagotchi
(bit.ly/taba433) gives you the incentive
to manage your tabs more sensibly
by making your actions a matter of life
or death. Inspired by the Tamagotchi
digital-pet craze of the Nineties,
the idea is that you maintain your
creature’s health and happiness by
keeping open tabs to a minimum.
For each hour you spend browsing
with five tabs or fewer, you get one step
closer to evolving your Tabagotchi to a
higher form. Conversely, when you open
too many tabs, your pet grows angry
and ill, and ultimately dies because of
your negligence. You monster!

Tell us your favourite add-ons at www.facebook.com/webusermagazine
Install the new uBlock Origin
WebExtension
As we explain on page 48 of this issue, a number of
popular Firefox tools are currently under threat as Mozilla
abandons ‘legacy’ add-ons in favour of WebExtensions.
Happily, users of the excellent ad blocker uBlock Origin
have nothing to fear, because the developer has released
a new ‘pure’ WebExtension version of the tool (bit.ly/
ublock433), which works with Firefox 57 and later. This
works in exactly the same way as the traditional add-on,
allowing you to block adverts, scripts and other unwanted
content on web pages, for a faster and less annoying
online experience. The first WebExtension release caused
users a few problems, because their uBlock Origin
settings and filter lists weren’t automatically migrated,
but these issues have now been fixed in an updated
version (1.14.4).
See which YouTube videos
have subtitles
YouTube’s automatic captioning of
videos – or ‘subtitling’, as we say in the
UK – is one of the site’s most useful
features, especially if you’re hard of
hearing or are watching with the sound
off. However, not all videos have
subtitles – perhaps due to poor sound
quality or because the creator has
turned them off – and others may offer
‘closed captions’ in several languages.
A new add-on called YouTube Caption
Indicator (bit.ly/caption433) addresses
this by adding language-specific subtitle
indicators to every video that appears in
the ‘Up next’ list. Just look for the ‘CC’
next to the video to see whether closed
captions have been generated
automatically, transcribed manually
in English or another language or don’t
appear at all. You’ll still have to click the
Subtitles button on the video’s menu
bar to activate the option.
Disable continuous
playback
This is the second tip for
autoplaying video in this issue,
which just goes to show what
a growing menace it’s become.
This new add-on is called
Autoplay No More (bit.ly/
disable433) and it prevents
popular video sites including
YouTube, Vimeo and TED from
automatically playing the next
video in an ‘Up next’ sequence
(compiled
by them,
not you)
as soon
as the
previous
one
finishes. Of course, you could
simply disable the autoplay
setting so you’re not forced
to watch something you don’t
want, but this extension saves
you the hassle.
Inspect images
in Vivaldi
Vivaldi’s innovations
never fail to impress us and the
latest ‘snapshot’ of the browser
(1.12.955.3, to be precise)
introduces an ingenious feature
called Image Inspector. This lets
you right-click a photo on an
image-sharing site or blog, and
select Inspect Image to view
detailed information about the
picture sourced from its meta
data. This includes attributes
such as the camera brand, white
balance, colour temperature
(kelvin), image dimensions and
more. It’s an excellent tool for
amateur photographers who
want to learn more about other
people’s work.

This fortnight’s most useful tips and add-ons to help you get the

Search Google
anonymously without
logging out
If you want to search Google
anonymously and prevent details
of the sites you visit being stored,
you usually have to sign out of your
Google account. This then means you
can’t use other Google services such
as Gmail, Drive and YouTube – unless
you log back in. The Firefox
WebExtension Searchonymous WE
(bit.ly/searchonymous433), based on
the now-defunct add-on
Searchonymous, solves this problem
by letting you search Google
anonymously while remaining logged
into all other Google services. It works
by blocking certain cookies and
generating random ones to stop
Google tracking you, while allowing
those that contain your search
preferences. Another benefit is that
you won’t see the adverts and clutter
that appear on the Google homepage
when cookies are disabled.

Find out if gales are about
to put the wind in your
sails with this gorgeous,
fascinating and resource-
hungry app that made our
phone so hot we needed
a strong breeze to cool
it down.
With that criticism out
of the way, let’s get down
to praising Windy. In
essence, it’s a weather
app that focuses on wind
speed and direction,
displaying both on an
animated map of the UK
(or wherever you happen to be
at the time). But it soon becomes apparent that Windy is
whatever kind of weather app you want it to be. In Settings,
you can select from overlays such as local webcams, waves
and airports (only one at a time, alas), then tap the map to
reveal a wealth of related detail. For example, choose
airports and you’ll see satellite views of runways, pilots’
weather alerts and more (see Mini Workshop, right).
Default measurements are Celsius and knots (kt), but you
can change these and many others in Settings. You can
even change the forecast
model. The default is ECMWF
(European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasts) but
there are two others to choose
from; and you can compare
their forecasts side by side for
any supported location. Find
out about the forecast models
on the superb Windy website
(bit.ly/windy433).
You don’t have to register
to use the app but you do
need to hand over your email
address to receive alerts,
which come to your email
inbox. That seems rather, er,
long-winded in 2017; surely
it’d be easier to
get a simple
notification. That
said, registration is quick, and one tap lets you
save all your settings securely to the cloud.

From Shakespeare With Love
bit.ly/love433
To pay or not to pay, that is the question.
Forsooth, No! Given the pedigree of its creator
Naxos (www.naxosaudiobooks.com), we had
high hopes for this £2.49 audio collection of
Shakespeare’s Sonnets,
read by actors including
David Tennant and
Maxine Peake. But users
who coughed up to
download it found the
audio didn’t work – and
Naxos hasn’t fixed the
problem. In fact, it all

in 2013, despite still

apps that art unfit for any place but Hell,

at least deliver the full text and an audio
option for all 154 of the Bard’s sonnets.
Contents are fully searchable, so you can
easily find a verse to fit your mood, and
the Share button lets you copy a sonnet’s
entire text to your clipboard with one tap.
The actors may not be as high-profile as
David Tennant, but their delivery is clear,
faithful and British-accented.

Apple’s new products
FAQ
Everything you need to know about the most
interesting new technology trends and events
What is it?
The iPhone X (pronounced “ten”) is the
latest version of Apple’s flagship device
and its most advanced smartphone yet.
Launched to mark the 10th anniversary
of the iPhone, it uses the new iOS 11
operating system to its full potential.
Where’s the home button?
There isn’t one. In a rather significant
development, Apple has removed it,
which not only makes the iPhone X
the first Apple handset not to have one,
but also allows for a stunning 5.8in edge-
to-edge OLED screen and a lovely all-
glass design. The button’s removal has
also spurred Apple to replace its Touch
ID feature – which lets you use your
fingerprint to unlock your phone, make
purchases and authenticate apps – with
a face-recognition system called Face ID.
What is Face ID?
Face ID uses the new front-facing
TrueDepth camera, which can map your
face using more than 30,000 invisible
infrared dots. The pattern this forms then
unlocks the iPhone X when you look at it.
Face ID can also be used to customise
Apple’s new animated emoji, called
animoji. These 3D versions of emoji are
based on your real-time facial
expressions and while they’re charming
and fun, they are also daft and gimmicky.
You’d probably use them a few times and
then get bored.
Will it take better photos?
Yes, it will. The seven-megapixel
TrueDepth camera takes better selfies,
giving them a superior depth of field,
and adds auto-image stabilisation,
wide colour capture and precise
exposure control. The rear dual
12-megapixel camera has a new colour
filter and quad LED flash for more
consistent illumination. Both cameras

Is Apple’s TV app coming to the
UK, too?
It is indeed. Having debuted in the US,
Apple announced that its TV app will
soon be heading to our shores. This lets
you search for and watch content from
broadcasters such as ITV and Channel 5
in a single app. Amazon Video will be
added later this year.
When is it out and how much
will it cost?
Apple TV 4K is out now, and costs £179
for the 32GB version and £199 for 64GB.
What, more iPhones?
As if to cushion the blow of the iPhone X’s high
price, Apple has released a more typical
upgrade to the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.
This means it has skipped the expected 7S
range – although, given that iPhone X is
pronounced “ten” (what happened to 9?), it
seems that logical ordering is out the window.
Why are they interesting?
These are the phones most Apple users are
likely to buy and they benefit from a new
design that uses durable, wipe-clean, water-
and dust-proof glass and aluminium. They stop
short of having an edge-to-edge display, which
means they retain the Touch ID Home button.
How do they differ to the iPhone X?
Both the 8 and 8 Plus use the X’s powerful A11
Bionic chip. They also have augmented-reality
capabilities, wireless charging and an improved
12-megapixel rear camera. You don’t get the X’s
OLED screen, enhanced front-facing camera
or face recognition, though.
When are they out and how much
will they cost?
You can buy one in store or online today. The
4.7in iPhone 8 costs from £699, while the 5.5in
8 Plus starts at £799. Both are available in
space grey, silver and gold. Of course, as with
the iPhone X, you’ll be able to get them on a
monthly payment plan to help spread the pain.
What is it?
It’s the latest version of Apple’s smartwatch, which uses
the new dedicated operating system WatchOS 4.
Why is it interesting?
The new Watch addresses one of the
biggest complaints about previous versions:
the need to have it close to your iPhone.
By introducing a cellular version, it now
works independently so you can leave
your phone at home and still make calls.
It’s also 70% faster than the previous
S2 version, and has a new barometric
altimeter to track elevation data.
When is it available?
You can buy one right now. It costs £329 for the
non-cellular model and £399 for the LTE-enabled version
(a tiny SIM is built in) but be aware that it currently only
works on the EE mobile network. There’s a £5-a-month
tariff for existing EE iPhone-contract holders.
work with the iPhone X’s accelerometers
and gyroscopes to create an enhanced
augmented-reality experience.
What about battery life?
Apple promises that the iPhone X’s
battery will last two hours longer than
the iPhone 7’s, so you shouldn’t need to
charge it as often. Apple has also caught
up with wireless charging and will release
an AirPower wireless charging device
next year. You’ll also be able to use Qi
charging mats.
When is it out and how much
will it cost?
Pre-orders will be accepted from
27 October and the device will be
available in stores from 5 November.
You’ll need deep pockets, though,
because the iPhone X will cost £999 for
the 64GB version and an eye-watering
£1,149 for the 256GB model. Whether or
not Face ID will have you weeping to
your bank manager is another matter.
Apple Watch Series 3
iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus
What is it?
This fifth-generation version of the
Apple TV set-top box is aimed squarely
at people who have 4K televisions.
It delivers content in Ultra HD (that’s
2,160p rather than the 1080p of standard
HD) as well as High Dynamic Range 10,
which offers a greater range of contrast
and colour, and Dolby Vision.
Why is it interesting?
Aside from allowing Apple TV to catch
up with the growing number of 4K TV
purchases and third-party Ultra HD
services, such as that offered by Netflix,
Apple is giving iTunes users an automatic
free 4K upgrade of any HD title they’ve
bought. The box also recognises when
a 4K TV is connected and optimises
its output for the best quality image,
aided by its faster A10X Fusion chip.

Stop connecting to slow networks
Sometimes, a free Wi-Fi connection can
be slower than a 3G or 4G connection –
we’ve certainly found that to be the
case in a lot of coffee shops, where the
signal is weak or the network is
congested. Provided you have a flexible
mobile data plan, it’s worth avoiding
these bad hotspots by making Android
forget them, which means your phone
or tablet won’t automatically connect
when in range.
First, you should review all your saved
wireless hotspots, which you can do by
tapping Settings, Wi-Fi. This brings up
the list of Wi-Fi networks in range. Tap
the three-dot menu in the top-right
corner and select ‘Saved networks’
to display all the hotspots you’ve
connected to in the past including,
probably, quite a few you’ve forgotten
about or only connected to once.
Select a hotspot you don’t want any
more, then tap Forget and it will be
removed from your list, so your device
will no longer automatically connect to
it in the future. You can easily reconnect
to a forgotten hotspot manually, should
you want to.

Speed up aeroplane Wi-Fi
If you’ve ever tried to use free Wi-Fi on
a plane, you’ll know it can be
frustratingly slow. This is because
there’s only a small amount of
bandwidth available and this has to be
shared between all the passengers. You
can’t speed up aeroplane Wi-Fi as such,
but your own device could be partially
responsible for the lack of speed.
Before you board your flight, make
sure all your apps are up to date (so
they don’t try to update via the plane’s
slow Wi-Fi) and turn off background
updating for all apps via Settings. You
should also disable photo backup. If you
plan to visit a particular site while in the
sky, load it beforehand, so the page
gets cached by your browser. This
means only the updated elements need
to be d

Get a mobile Wi-Fi (Mi-Fi) router
You can use your smartphone to create
a mobile hotspot that other devices can
connect to, which is useful for areas
where Wi-Fi is slow or unavailable.
On an iPhone, go to Settings, Personal
Hotspot and turn on that option.
Connect to the new hotspot using the
generated password. The process on
Android phones varies depending on
the version of the OS, but in most cases
you can go to Settings, ‘Wireless and
Networks’ and open More Settings.
Select ‘Tethering and Portable Hotspot’,
and Activate Portable Wi-Fi Hotspots.
Mi-Fi (Mobile Wi-Fi) works in the
same way, and lets you connect multiple
devices to a single 4G data SIM so you
can get online anywhere and enjoy
reliable speeds. For this, you will need
to buy a Mi-Fi router such as the TP-Link
M7350 4G Mobile Router, which costs
£75 from Amazon (bit.ly/tplink433). It
uses any SIM and allows you to connect
up to 10 devices, and offers selectable
2.4GHz and 5GHz dual-band Wi-Fi.
It’s likely that your mobile phone
provider will offer a Mi-Fi router on
a contract. O2, for example, offers the
Huawei 4G Pocket Hotspot Plus (bit.ly/
huawei433, pictured below) for £19.99
upfront, and £11 a month with 2GB of 4G
data and free O2 Wi-Fi. There are plenty
of other payment plans available,
depending on how much data you
require, and you can even buy the
router upfront for £67.99, which reduces

nternet-connected devices have become so much a
part of our lives that it’s easy to take Wi-Fi for granted
until it starts misbehaving – slowing to a crawl or
disappearing altogether. Whether at home or out and
about, we feel lost without it, and trying to download
or stream content over a sluggish wireless connection
can ruin your day.
Fortunately, there are plenty of tricks you can employ
to combat flaky Wi-Fi, wherever you are and whatever
device you’re using. In this cover feature, we reveal the
newest and most effective ways to supercharge your Wi-Fi
and mobile data speeds, so you can download everything
you want in seconds. Over the next five pages, we explain
how to reduce your data usage, optimise your settings
and identify and fix common speed problems, either by
upgrading your hardware, installing helpful apps or simply
tweaking your device’s settings.

MINI WORKSHOP | Check your network speed using OpenSignal
Set up a Google Wifi
mesh network to
speed up Wi-Fi
around your home
Set up a mesh Wi-Fi network
If you live in a big house or your home
has thick walls and floors, there’s a good
chance that your wireless signal won’t
reach everywhere and you’ll probably
have weak areas and dead spots. Buying
a Wi-Fi range extender or repeater will
help speed up your downloading,
streaming and browsing, but a much
better solution nowadays is to upgrade
your Wi-Fi to a mesh network.
This modular Wi-Fi system comprises
multiple access points that work
together to blanket your home with fast,
stable coverage, so you should
experience the same quality of Wi-Fi
in every area of your property. You start
with one device that connects to your
modem, then add others around the
house. It’s not the cheapest solution,
but it delivers the best results, so if
strong Wi-Fi in every room is a priority,
it’s definitely worth the expense.
One of the best options is Google Wifi
(bit.ly/gwifi433) – a smart looking mesh
product that’s easy to set up and
manage, with everything controlled via
an app on your phone or tablet. A single
Google Wifi unit costs £129, while a twin
pack will set you back £229.
Another option is the Linksys Velop
(bit.ly/velop433). On Amazon, a single
unit costs £179.99, a twin pack is
£249.99, and a triple pack is £379.99.
It also works with Amazon’s personal
assistant, Alexa, so you can control it
using your voice.
Force Android devices to use
the fastest band
Modern Wi-Fi routers offer radio signals
in either the 2.4GHz or 5GHz frequency
bands. For equipment that supports it,
the 5GHz band is superior because it
tends to be less congested and supports
significantly higher maximum data rates
– so downloads and streaming should be
much faster.
By default, your devices will
automatically connect to what they view
Make sure your Android device always
connects to the faster 5GHz band
to be the best band, but you can force
your Android phone or tablet to only
connect to the faster 5GHz band. To do
this, go to Settings and tap Wi-Fi.
Tap the three-dot menu in the top-right
corner and select Advanced. Select
‘Wi-Fi frequency band’ and, in the box
that pops up, select ‘5GHz only’.
Test all your connection speeds
– Wi-Fi, 3G and 4G
It’s easy to check the speed of your
wireless connection – just run a tester
such as Ookla Speedtest (www
.speedtest.net), which is available on the
web and as an app for all mobile
devices. Another option is OpenSignal
(opensignal.com) which is available for
both iOS and Android. It not only
checks the speed of your different
networks – including Wi-Fi, 3G and 4G
– but also shows you how well your
mobile network compares with those
from rival providers.
We particularly like that OpenSignal

shows your data usage – mobile and
Wi-Fi – over a set period of time, so you
can identify when and where you might
be downloading or streaming excessively.
See our Mini Workshop below left to
find out how to use OpenSignal.
Spot and stop Wi-Fi thieves
Provided you’re using wireless security
along with a strong password, the
chances of anyone piggybacking
on your Wi-Fi connection are slim,
but you should check to make sure
by using Bitdefender Home Scanner
(bit.ly/bdhs433).
This free tool scans your Wi-Fi
network and devices to look for weak
passwords, as well as vulnerable or
poorly encrypted communications.
In addition to spotting potentially
unwanted users on your home Wi-Fi,
who could be slowing down your
downloads and streams, it offers
detailed security recommendations
for your network. To use the software,
install and run it, then click the Start
Using Home Scanner button. Confirm
that you’re running it on your home
network and it will go to work.
Another way to expose neighbours
leeching your Wi-Fi is to use Who’s On
My Wifi (www.whoisonmywifi.com),
which displays a list of all connected
devices that you can go through and
identify. The software runs in the
background, scanning your network
every five minutes, and alerts you when
any unknown devices are found.
Troubleshoot common problems
Identifying the cause of slow or
problematic Wi-Fi isn’t always easy.
Sluggish downloads can be the result
of congestion; too many people on your
network using the connection at the
same time; objects or electrical items
degrading the signal; incompatible
devices; or your neighbours broadcasting
on the same wireless channel as you.
Xirrus Wi-Fi Inspector (www.xirrus
.com/inspector) can help you find,
connect to and troubleshoot a wireless
network. It provides details about your
current connection, including the
SSID (name), Channel, and Mac and
IP Addresses. A real-time graph shows
the signal strength and history, while
a dynamic radar shows all other
connections in range, including their
names and relative distance.
Detect local Wi-Fi interference
If your wireless signal is suffering as a
result of stronger Wi-Fi nearby, you can
use the free – but ad-supported – Wifi
Analyzer for Android (bit.ly/wifia433)
to track down the problem. It shows all
the wireless points nearby – including
your own – along with their signal
strength and the channel they are
broadcasting on. This information will
help you troubleshoot any problems and
shift to the best channel. You can switch
between bands – 2.4GHz and 5GHz –
and change the view from Channel
Graph to Time Graph, Channel Rating,
AP (access point) List or Signal Meter.
Look for dead spots to eliminate
Your wireless signal can be degraded
by all manner of things in your home,
including thick walls, floors, furniture,
power cables and electrical devices
– most notably, microwave ovens. You
can identify weak areas and dead spots
by creating a Wi-Fi heat map of your
home using Ekahau Heatmapper (bit.ly/
heat433) to determine the fastest spot
for carrying out urgent downloading.
You’ll need to install it on a laptop or
Windows tablet, rather than a desktop
PC, because you have to move around
your living space to measure the signal.
Heatmapper works best if you have
a map of your home to begin with –
this can be a blueprint or something
you’ve drawn yourself (as close to scale
as possible). You can still use the
software if you don’t have a map,
but the results won’t be as useful.
To create the heatmap, move a few
feet at a time and click to measure the
Wi-Fi at that point to build up a colour-
coded map. In addition to your own

be impacting on your signal.
See how apps perform on your
current network
Most apps should run fine on your
wireless connection but if you find that
certain tools are a little sluggish, you
can perform a speed test that will
highlight potential problems. For this,
you will need to install Meteor from
OpenSignal (meteor.opensignal.com).
At the time of writing, this is currently
only available for Android but a version
for iOS is due shortly.
When you run a test, the service will
check the download, upload and ‘ping’
speeds of your wireless connection,
then show you how major apps – such
as YouTube, Gmail and Facebook –
perform. Ideally, they should be labelled
as Awesome. You can choose which
apps you want to check.
Meteor’s Dashboard lets you see
how performance compares across
a selection of test locations, and you
can filter this by Best or Worst. You can
also check performance history.
Updating an app to its latest version
may help solve any problems with the
app’s speed.
REDUCE YOUR DATA USAGE
your mobile connection, prioritising
your download so you don’t have to
wait while an unimportant app clogs up
the connection to pull inessential data
from the web.
You can view the data savings you’ve
made as a result of this streamlining,
and discover which apps consume
the most data over time. Usefully,
DataEye lets you unblock any apps for
10 minutes at a time (or permanently),
and the app has special offers that
reward you with extra data for free –
although these don’t yet seem to be
available in the UK.
Opera Mini (www.opera.com/mobile)
is another browser from the same
developer that claims to reduce your
data needs by up to 90%. It also comes
with an ad blocker, a built-in video
downloader (which, annoyingly, doesn’t
work with YouTube) and an intelligent
download manager for getting files
faster. You can check your data savings
in the Settings menu.
Unlike the Opera Browser, Opera Mini
is available for both Android and iOS.
Reduce data using DataEye
DataEye (bit.ly/dataeye433) also
significantly trims your mobile data
usage, albeit in a more basic way than
the old Opera Max. It simply allows you
to choose which of your apps can use
Reduce your data with Opera
Opera Max was an excellent data-saving
app for Android that managed to speed
up your browsing over both wireless
and mobile networks by compressing
content before it reached your phone,
which meant you downloaded less data.
Unfortunately, Opera recently made
the decision to kill the app in order to
focus more on its browsers.
Still, it’s not all bad news. The Opera
Browser for Android (bit.ly/operab433)
blocks ads, which reduces some of your
data usage, and it also compresses
videos (you can disable this feature
if you don’t like the results). The browser
has a built-in data-saving mode, too,
that uses compression to load pages
faster on sluggish networks.

Three recently introduced a new
Go Binge deal (bit.ly/gobinge433),
which lets you stream your favourite
shows and music without using up
any of your data allowance.
Unsurprisingly, this doesn’t come
without restrictions, and you can
only stream unlimited content from
Three’s media partners – Netflix,
TVPlayer, Deezer and SoundCloud.
It’s possible that more may be added
in the future, but for now those are
your choices. Also, if you want to
stream Netflix, you will need to
have a subscription to it.
The deal is available to all new or
upgrading Three customers with an
Advanced plan of 4GB and above.
While streaming with one of the
partner services won’t eat into your
data plan, you still need some of your

Most users will welcome this
zero-rated streaming (as it’s known),
although a more sceptical take is that
it’s a subtle form of advertising –
companies such as Netflix are buying
your attention and will ultimately
gain more customers as a result.
Faster Wi-Fi wherever you are
COVER
FEATURE
4 - 17 October 2017 45
Use less data on Android
The latest versions of Android, Nougat
and Oreo have a handy Data Saver
feature that stops your smartphone
from consuming too much mobile data
in the background. Once enabled, it
ensures that apps and services can only
get their background data via Wi-Fi.
Not only does this prevent you from
going over your usage cap, it also has
the benefit of speeding up browsing
and downloading, because the available
bandwidth doesn’t have to be shared
with apps performing actions in the
background. Additionally, it asks apps
to use less data in the foreground.
To activate Data Saver, open Settings
and go to Network & Internet, Data
Usage (the exact location will vary
depending on your phone). Select Data
Saver and turn it on. Not all apps work
with this feature, so if you find one that
can’t handle being blocked from access
to background data, you can add it as an
exception. Open Settings, go to Network
& Internet, Data Usage and select Data
Saver. Select Unrestricted Data Access,
then enable the app or service that you
want to allow to have access to mobile
data while this mode is active.
Use a mobile download manager
Thanks to superfast broadband
connections, download managers aren’t
as essential on PCs as they once were.
However, they can come in handy
on mobile devices, where they
accelerate downloads and let you
resume any that fail.
For Android devices, you can install
Advanced Download Manager (bit.ly/
admanager433) which can usefully
fetch up to three files simultaneously.
As with PC download managers, it
breaks each file into multiple pieces for
downloading concurrently, saving you
a lot of time when on the move. The app
is free to install, but contains adverts.
On iOS, you can try Total Downloader
(bit.ly/total433) which lets you start
multiple downloads, and pause and
restart them. It’s also ad-supported,
and some reviewers have complained
that these get in the way, ruining what is
an otherwise excellent experience – so
bear that in mind.
Another app worth trying is Offline
(bit.ly/offline433), which provides
resumable downloads, queues, progress
details and error reports. It also auto-
renames files, making them easy to find
and manage.
The app description claims that
“only non-audiovisual files are
supported for downloading due to store
guidelines”, but we found it happily
grabbed videos from most popular
video-sharing sites, including YouTube.
It, too, contains adverts.

What we liked:
Ivideon uses a server and
client system. You install
the server software on
a PC that either already
has a camera connected
or is able to access one
over your home network.
This PC has to be switched on for the
surveillance software to operate. You
then install client software on the other
computers (there are apps for mobile
devices) to access the live streams and
any footage saved by your server.
The system works really well if you
already have a webcam built into a
laptop that you’re planning to use as the
server. Install the software on it, leave
the laptop switched on and the webcam
will monitor all movement that goes on
around it. It’s very easy to connect
another camera, whether it’s a webcam
attached to another device or a more
sophisticated standalone network
security camera, as long as it hasn’t
been locked to a particular service by
its manufacturer.
The software is free for up to two
cameras, accessible from two other
devices, and includes the option to
store camera footage on Ivideon’s cloud
service for 24 hours. If you don’t need
remote access, you can install more
cameras for free – otherwise it costs
$4 per month (around £3) per camera
to add more.
The server uploads data from your
PC to Ivideon’s website, so it’s very
straightforward to set up because you
don’t need to get embroiled in port
forwarding to bypass your router’s
security. This means there’s a slight
delay on live video streams, but it’s only
a second or two.
How it can be improved:
The limits on the number of cameras
you can use and the amount of footage
you can store online – as well as the
length of time it’s available for – are too
restrictive. Monthly and annual prices
are charged on a per-camera basis so
the costs will ramp up if you want to
expand your system.
OUR VERDICT
If you’re happy to keep things small
– monitoring one or two cameras
and keeping on top of the limits for
storing footage online – Ivideon is
a wonderful system that’s simple to
set up and use. However, adding
extra cameras and increasing your
online storage will push up costs.
If you’ve got an old
webcam, IP camera or
even a phone that you
no longer use, you can
combine them with clever,
free software to create
a security system for
monitoring your home.

What we liked:
If you’ve got a lot of old
webcams, network
cameras or camera-
equipped mobile devices
kicking around, AtHome
amera provides an
efficient way to turn them into
a home-security system. As with
Ivideon, you download either the server
software to stream the footage to the
internet; or the camera software to view
the footage on another device.
The standout bonus is that the
camera software can manage lots of
cameras at the same time, so your only
limit on the number of locations you can
monitor is the number of cameras that
you have available. This only applies to
live streams, though.
Saving footage online so you can view
it later costs $4.99 per month (around
£3.69), though you can buy time in bulk
and pay slightly less (around £2.84 per
month for 12 months).
How it could be improved:
The software focuses on live streaming,
What we liked:
ContaCam is a purely
functional piece of
software and very little
thought has been put into
ts aesthetic design. That
id, it’s really easy to set up
because, when you first launch it,
instructions appear that allow the
software to recognise any available
cameras, including webcams and
network devices. Once you’ve added
a camera, you’re taken straight to its
settings so you can make sure
everything is set up just right before
you start monitoring.
Once the camera is running, footage
is recorded straight to your hard drive.
It also creates a web page, hosted on
your PC, with animated thumbnails of
detected movement. Again, it’s not the
most beautifully designed tool but it
does the job with an admirable lack of
hassle – you don’t have to get to grips
with any tricky processes.
Because it doesn’t rely on external
servers, there’s no online service to pay
for, making this the only software in our
round-up that’s completely free.
How it can be improved:
Because ContaCam doesn’t use an
online service, viewing the web page
on a remote computer is a bit more
complicated. There are no client apps or
programs available so you’ll need to
configure port forwarding on your
router to access your footage for when
you’re away from your network.
though you can set devices to record at
a particular time – if you want to catch
your kids coming home from school,
for example. Also, the option to have
so many devices means it’s tricky to
figure out how everything works –
a situation that isn’t helped by the
minimal documentation.
OUR VERDICT
AtHome Camera excels at live
streaming, so you can check in on a
location when you need to, and you
can set up as many cameras as you
like. However, you’ll have to pay if
you want to store footage online for
replaying at a later date.
OUR VERDICT
ContaCam is completely free and
self-contained, but its interface
looks dated compared to its rivals
and you need to fiddle with your
router settings to view your footage
away from your home network.
iSpy
www.ispyconnect.com
iSpy is open-source software that’s
free to use and install. Similar to
Ivideon, it monitors cameras over
a home network for free, but if you
want to view footage remotely and
benefit from any extra features such
as email and text message alerts,
you’ll need to subscribe. Plans start
at $7.95 per month (around £5.89),
which is a bit more expensive than
its rivals. Its interface isn’t as good
looking, either.
Yawcam
www.yawcam.com
Yawcam is general webcam
software, so it’s not a match for the
other programs we’ve featured,
though you can set it to live-stream
footage to the web and it includes
motion detection, so it could be
used for a
single-camera
setup. However,
it’s starting to
look dated and
requires Java to
run, which a lot
of people are
reluctant to install because of
previous security problems.
IP Camera Viewer
bit.ly/desk433
If you’re happy to sit and watch
streaming footage on one or more
security cameras (webcams and IP
cameras are its speciality), then this
is ideal. It can support up to four
cameras and will happily let you
focus on a single camera or divide
your screen into quarters to show
them all. What you can’t do with the
free version is record anything,
so this is only useful if you want to
monitor what’s going on right now.

ADDING UNWANTED
FEATURES
One of the best things about Firefox is
that you can customise it using the
add-ons of your choice. So when, a
couple of years ago, Mozilla started
integrating features such as video-call
service Hello and read-it-later tool
Pocket with the browser, it felt as if they
were being forced on us. Similarly,
tweaks made to the interface seemed
unnecessary – especially the Australis
makeover in Firefox 29, which removed
the Add-ons bar and replaced the
orange menu button with the
‘hamburger’ menu. In 2014, Mozilla even
started to show adverts – sorry,
‘sponsored tiles’ – on the New Tab page,
prompting a huge backlash from users,
which persuaded the company to ditch
the feature the following year.
What can be done?
Mozilla seems to have seen the error
of its ways, and it now asks for users’
feedback on new features through its
Test Pilot program (testpilot.firefox
.com) rather than simply foisting them
on us. Current experiments include
Snooze Tabs, which reduces memory
usage by putting idle tabs ‘to sleep’ until
later; and Voice Fill, which brings
speech-recognition to the browser.
If these tests prove unpopular or require
further development, they (hopefully)
won’t be built into future versions.
✘
USING OUTDATED
TECHNOLOGY
For a long time, Firefox users were left
wondering why Mozilla hadn’t released
a 64-bit version of the browser.
The Firefox-based Waterfox (www
.waterfoxproject.org) and Pale Moon
(www.palemoon.org) both offered
64-bit versions, and you could get
64-bit Firefox on MacOS and Linux, but
poor Windows users had to wait until
December 2015. Chrome’s 64-bit
version was released in August 2014.
This delay typifies Mozilla’s tendency
to lag behind when it comes to using the
latest technology. For example, Firefox
Firefox was once the browser of choice for savvy
web users, but then Chrome took over. Robert Irvine
examines what went wrong – and what can be done
is still powered by the ageing Gecko
rendering engine (bit.ly/gecko433),
whereas Chrome, Opera and Vivaldi use
the more modern Blink engine, which is
based on WebKit (bit.ly/webkit433).
Websites are increasingly being
designed for WebKit-supporting
browsers, which means some pages
may be unresponsive or not display
properly in Firefox, and the browser
feels comparatively bloated and slow.
Mozilla also used Gecko in its
doomed mobile operating system,

Back in Issue 251 of Web User, we celebrated the
release of Firefox 4 by publishing a complete guide
to the “brilliant new browser”, with “every new tool
revealed”. Seven years later, as Mozilla prepares to
launch version 57, the situation couldn’t be more
different. Chrome has a 55% market share compared
with Firefox’s 6%, innovation is sorely lacking and
each release seems to remove rather than add
something useful. In fairness, Mozilla has only been
following the trend for incremental updates and,
as a non-profit organisation, it can’t match the
millions Google spends on Chrome or ensure Firefox
is preinstalled on mobile devices. We still think the
organisation made mistakes that hastened the
browser’s decline, though, and addressing some
of these may yet save Firefox from the flames.

Stop using Firefox
4 - 17 October 2017 49
Will you ditch Firefox? Let us know at forum.webuser.co.uk
What can be done?
Mozilla has been working on a
replacement for Gecko under the name
Project Quantum (bit.ly/quantum433),
which will improve Firefox’s rendering
engine, making it faster and less
resource-hungry. Developers hope to
implement at least some of Quantum’s
improvements by the end of the year.
We’re also pleased to see that, as of
August, 64-bit Firefox is now the default
version for Windows.

DITCHING ‘LEGACY’
ADD-ONS
When Firefox 57 is released on 14
November, thousands of popular Firefox
extensions will stop working. That’s
because Mozilla will have completed its
transition from ‘legacy add-ons’ to
new-fangled WebExtensions, which it
regards as the future of the browser.
Add-on developers were given a fair
amount of warning to update their tools,
and WebExtensions have many benefits,
including better security (they can be
‘sandboxed’ to prevent PC infection);
improved performance (they’re faster
and use less memory); and increased
flexibility (you can install them in other
browsers, including Chrome, Opera
and Edge).
With only a month to go, however,
neither the browser’s users nor its
developers appear to be ready for the
WebExtensions era. Favourite
extensions have disappeared from
Mozilla’s Add-ons site without warning,
while others bear the giveaway message
“Please note this add-on uses legacy
technology”. Unless a tool is specifically
marked as ‘Compatible with Firefox 57’,
you’d better start looking for an
alternative that is compatible.
What can be done?
The beta version of Firefox 57 included
an about:config option called
‘extensions.legacy.enabled’ that let you
continue to use old add-ons, but this is
likely to be removed in the stable
release. To find out which of your
installed extensions will stop working
after next month’s release, go to Tools,
Add-ons, Extensions and look for
entries that are marked ‘Legacy’.
Fortunately, there is a workaround
that will let you use your favourite
legacy add-ons for longer, which is to
switch to Firefox ESR (bit.ly/esr433).
This Extended Support Release version
of the browser is intended for
businesses and schools rather than
users “who want to get the latest
features, performance enhancements
and technologies”, but it’s free for
anyone to download. It’s updated
24 weeks after each new release of
Firefox, which means you can continue
to use any favourite add-ons that
haven’t been upgraded to
WebExtensions until 26 June 2018.

IMITATING
NOT INNOVATING
It’s an open secret that until the end of
2014, Mozilla earned most of its $300m
annual revenue from its browser rival
Google, for setting the search giant as
the default engine in Firefox. Yahoo
took over the deal in December 2014,
although Google is still the default in
Europe. Since then,
Chrome has
significantly eclipsed
Firefox in popularity,
and Opera and Vivaldi
have shaken up
notions of what
browsers can do, with
innovative tools
including a built-in
VPN, visual tabs and
customisation options.
Aside from ill-advised
features such as Hello, Firefox has failed
to come up with anything original in the
past few years, and even its Sync tool,
which syncs your data and settings
across your devices, is a pale imitation
of Chrome’s.
Don’t get us wrong: we always find
something interesting to say about
Firefox in each issue’s Best New
Browser Tools section, but we can’t
remember when the fox last blew our
socks off.
What can be done?
Hopefully, Firefox’s ‘rebirth’ through
WebExtensions and Quantum, and its
promising Test Pilot experiments, will
trigger a burst of creativity in the
browser’s development. Recently,
Mozilla has shown a lot more concern
over users’ privacy than Google (which,
admittedly, isn’t difficult), with a blog
post outlining its ‘transparent’ approach
to data collection (bit.ly/data433). The
constant strides made by Vivaldi may
well give it a kick up the tail, too.

Identify the battery hogs
The first step is to identify which apps
are using more than their fair share of
battery power. This isn’t hard to do:
if you’re using an iPhone, open Settings,
tap Battery and scroll down to Battery
Usage. In Android, go to Settings,
Battery. On both systems, you’ll see a
list of apps, ranked in descending order
according to how much power they use.
There’s a good chance that one or
two apps will be consuming the lion’s
share of energy – Facebook, WhatsApp
and Google
Play services
are notorious
offenders. You
may be able to
slash this by
disabling
features such
as location
services, or
limiting the
app’s data
access when
running in the
background.
You can even
uninstall or
disable the
most power-hungry apps and switch to
more efficient alternatives. There’s no
reason why you need to stick with the
default apps: both Android and iOS use
internal libraries for photos and music,
so third-party alternatives usually
provide all the same core functions.
Optimise your screen
One of the biggest drains on your
phone’s battery is the screen, so
reducing the brightness can make a big
difference. Swipe up from the bottom
of the screen on an iPhone to access
the relevant controls, or drag down
from the top on an Android phone.
If you prefer, you can set your
Android device to adjust the brightness
automatically by switching on Adaptive
Brightness in Settings, Display. On an
iPhone, open Settings, Display &
Brightness and tap Auto-Brightness.
You can also reduce the length of
time your screen stays on before
automatically switching off. While it can
be annoying to have your screen dim or
shut down when you’re reading, you can
keep it active by occasionally tapping it
or slightly scrolling. On iOS, you’ll find
this option by tapping Auto-lock on the
Display & Brightness screen. You can set
this to as little as 30 seconds to get the
greatest benefit. On Android, open
Settings, then tap Display followed by
Sleep, and choose 15 seconds.
If your phone has an AMOLED screen,
you can also switch your wallpaper from
a colourful photo to plain black, which
Tired of low-battery warnings? Remember
when your phone used to get you through a
whole day? Nik Rawlinson explains how to
squeeze more hours out of a charge
reduces power consumption by
minimising the number of pixels that
need to be lit up.
Disable non-essential
services
You might assume that closing
background apps would save battery
power – but experts believe otherwise.
Google even says on its support pages
that “swiping apps closed doesn’t save
battery. You don’t need to close apps
unless something goes wrong.” The
logic is that background apps are so
tightly power-managed that it takes
more energy to relaunch them each
time you want to use them.
However, you may see a significant
improvement in battery life if you turn
off rarely used connections and
background services. Swipe down on
Android, or up on iOS, to access the
controls for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.
Disabling these reduces battery drain,
so get into the habit of turning off
Bluetooth when you’re not using a
hands-free kit. Make sure you also turn

off tethering so you’re not broadcasting
an outgoing Wi-Fi network for others to
connect to. If you’re going to be
incommunicado for a while, switch to
Flight or Aeroplane mode, which
disables radio connections altogether.
Another measure is to reduce the
amount of background activity that
goes on. Set your email application to
check for new messages every hour
instead of every five minutes. On an
iPhone, turning off Background App
Refresh in Settings makes a significant
difference to your power consumption,
because it disables an app’s ability to
download data when you’re not using it.
Both Android and iOS have low-
power modes, which reduce the
frequency at which apps update, shut
down non-essential services and extend
battery life. On the iPhone, this kicks in
automatically when your battery level
falls to 20%, and switches off again
when you charge it to above 80%. To
activate it manually, open Settings,
Battery and tap the switch next to Low
Power Mode. On Android, swipe down
from the top of the screen, tap Battery,
then the three-dots icon and turn on
‘Battery saver’.
Download before you travel
If you’re planning a journey, you can
save a huge amount of battery power
by downloading maps over your home
network before you leave, rather than
streaming them over a 4G connection.
Similarly, download music and podcasts
in advance to listen to offline, and set
your photos to sync to the server only
when your phone’s connected to Wi-Fi.
Even if you prefer to keep your mobile
connection on all the time, it makes
sense to disable it when you’re in an
area where reception is poor or non-
existent. If you don’t, your phone will
automatically ramp up the power as it
searches for weak signals. Switching to
Flight or Aeroplane mode prevents it
from doing this.
Charge your phone more
intelligently
Battery technology has advanced
significantly in the past few years, and
the lithium-ion cells used in modern
mobiles don’t suffer from the “memory
effect” that plagued older batteries.
This means you don’t need to worry
about completely discharging and fully
charging your phone every time you
plug it in.
With lithium-ion, the advice is to keep
the battery topped up where possible,
and only rarely allow it to go through a
full charging cycle (where you take it to
100%, run it flat and then fully charge it
again). This is because lithium-ion cells
have a finite lifespan that’s determined
by the number of cycles they go
through. The more cycles a cell goes
through, the more its total capacity
degrades. A cycle doesn’t need to be
completed all at once. In Apple’s words,
“you might use 75% of your battery’s
capacity one day, then recharge it fully
overnight. If you use 25% the next day,
you will have discharged a total of 100%
in the two days, which will add up to
one charge cycle”.
Stop your phone vibrating
If you’re like us, you may prefer to keep
your phone’s ringer switched off, and
rely on discreet vibration instead.
However, this uses a motor, which can
sap more energy than simply using the
speaker. If you really want to keep your
battery usage to a minimum, switch
back to the default ringer and turn off
any backup vibration. You might also
choose to disable haptic feedback,
which makes the phone buzz briefly to
indicate that a hidden function has been
activated, such as the context-sensitive
menus that pop up when you press
extra hard on some iOS elements.
Unfortunately, there’s no single trick to magically restore your phone’s
battery life to its performance when it was new, but a combination of the
measures we’ve discussed in this feature should help you get through the day.
Even so, if you’re planning a long journey and will be away from a socket,
an external battery can be very useful. The trick here is to buy one that’s the
right size for your needs. Capacities are rated in milliamp-hours (mAh). To
work out what this means in practice, compare this figure with the mAh
capacity of your phone’s internal battery. For example, the iPhone 7 uses a
1,960mAh cell, so a 10,000mAh external
battery holds about five charges’
worth of energy. Don’t forget
that the charging process is
nowhere near 100% efficient –
you could expect to get three
or four charges before you’d
need to refill the external battery.

A
surprising number of Android
apps spy on their users, including
those designed to measure data
use, and Virtual Private Network tools
that are actually meant to protect your
privacy. They transmit this data to the
app’s developers or, worse, sell it to
other companies. And finding out which
apps spy on you isn’t easy.
GlassWire for Android can help by
showing you which apps are going online,
when and how often, so you can build up
a picture of their activity. It also monitors
your Wi-Fi activity, mobile usage and
data limits, potentially saving you money.
Best of all, GlassWire’s findings never
leave your device, so you don’t need to
worry that it’s also spying on you.
Discover which Android apps
are spying on you
5
Tap the menu button 1 and select
Usage. This shows you how much
data your device has downloaded and
uploaded 2 during the specified time
period. 3 The bar at the bottom lists
the apps responsible for this usage, 4
and the total amount of data each one
has consumed.
1
When you first start GlassWire,
it asks for the permissions it needs
to visualise your data usage. Tap the
Go To Settings button 1 and on the
‘Apps with usage access’ screen, select
GlassWire. Enable the ‘Permit Usage
access’ option using the toggle switch.
Return to the app and tap Next.
2
Allow other permission requests, and
the app will start monitoring usage.
It presents a real-time colour-coded
graph, 1 and displays download, upload,
and mobile and Wi-Fi information at the
bottom, 2 as well as details of the traffic
being used by apps and Android. 3
There will always be some activity here.
3
If an app suddenly starts using
data (such as when Gmail checks
for new messages, for example) an icon
will appear on the bottom bar. Tap the
icon to switch to a graph view for that
particular app. 1 You shouldn’t worry
about this type of usage unless the
figures are consistently high.
Use GlassWire to monitor your data use and
track down apps that share your information
4
By default, GlassWire shows data
usage for the past minute, but to
get a better idea of which apps are
going online too frequently, you need
to extend this time frame. Tap the
1 Minute drop-down menu 1 and choose
an alternative duration. This can be
anything up to 90 days.

Stream to Emby apps
Mobile apps are availabe for iOS,
Android, Windows 10 and Windows
Phone, and there are also apps for
Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku,
Chromecast, Kodi, Xbox One and PS4.
The mobile apps offer a host of
benefits and let you stream content from
your server, but if you want to watch a
movie or TV show on your device, you’ll
need to unlock that feature with a one-off
purchase (£4.99) or an active Emby
Premiere subscription (£4.99 a month, or
£119 for a lifetime). Premiere features
include Emby DVR support (so you can
schedule live TV recordings and series
links), Cinema Mode and Cloud Sync.
You can stream one minute of your
media to the apps for free, so at least you

Download and run Emby. The
configuration wizard will open in
your web browser. Make sure English
(United Kingdom) is selected as the
preferred display language, then click
Next. Enter your name and the details
of your Emby account, if you have one.
You can now set up your libraries. Click
the Add Media Library tile. 1
2
Use the drop-down menu in the
window that opens to select a
‘Content type’ – Movies, Music, TV,
Books, Games, Home Videos & Photos,
Music Videos, Photos or Unset (Mixed
Content). 1 You can also change the
default display name. 2 Click Add 3 to
locate a folder containing your media.
Allow Emby to download artwork. 4
3
Choose where you want Emby to
save the artwork, and whether to
enable chapter-image extraction (this
takes time and uses a lot of space).
Click OK, then either add some more
media libraries 1 or click Next. 2 Set
the Metadata language to English (UK)
and agree to the terms of service.
When you’ve done all that, click Finish.
Once you’ve installed a plugin, you
must restart the server to use it.
Set up user accounts
Emby lets you create separate user
accounts for friends and family members,
each with its own permissions, library
access and parental controls. To create a
new account, find the Server section in
the left-hand bar and click Users, then
the Add button. By default, all users have

playback features. However, if you’d
rather not pay to use an app, you can
still watch streams through a device’s
browser. We show you how in our Mini
Workshop on page 61.
Install plugins
All good media centre software supports
plugins – Kodi wouldn’t be anywhere
near as popular as it is without its
add-ons – and Emby is no exception. You
can install server plugins directly from
the sidebar. Simply click the Plugins
button on the left and browse the
selection on the right. They are sorted
into categories such as Top Plugins,
Channels, Content Providers, General,
Live TV, Metadata, Notifications and
Sync. Select one to find out more about
it and install it. Bear in mind that not all
of the plugins listed are available for free.
Some, such as Cover Art, require a
Premiere subscription to use.

Once your server is up and running,
you’re ready to stream content from
it. The best option is to install an app
on your target device, but you have to
make a one-off payment of around
£4.99 to unlock the streaming feature.
You can avoid this by using a browser
instead. First, make a note of the IP
address on your server dashboard. 1
2
Open the browser on your target
device – an iPad, in our case. Type
the address (including the port) and
press Enter. There are different
addresses, depending on whether you’re
streaming over a local network (LAN) or
the internet (WAN). Your device should
connect to the server to display your
folders 1 and latest content. 2
3
Tap an item you want to watch to
see information about it (pulled
from the internet), including cover art,
1 plot description, details of the video
quality and format, 2 and thumbnails
of the cast and crew. 3 Tap Trailer 4
to stream the trailer from YouTube.
When you’re ready, tap Play 5
to begin watching.
MINI WORKSHOP | Stream videos from your server for free
access to all libraries, but you can untick
this option and choose which libraries are
available to individual users. Enter a
name for the new user and click Save.
Now you can choose whether the user
is allowed to manage the server, and
which features they can access, such as
media deletion, live TV access and live
recording. You can also set which media
playback features are allowed, and
whether or not downloads are permitted.
The bar at the top lets you tweak the
access options, enable parental controls
and password protect the account. If you
enable parental controls, you can block
content that lacks a recognised rating or
uses specific tags, and also create a
schedule to limit access to certain hours.
Download subtitles
Subtitles are obviously useful for films
made in a foreign language, but they can
also help if you’re hard of hearing or you
want to watch a video quietly with the
sound switched off. Emby can find and
download matching subtitles for movies
and TV shows in whatever language you
choose. Click Subtitles in the server’s
sidebar, then choose which items you
want to download subtitles for. Select the
language you require from the list.
By default, Emby only downloads
subtitles that are a perfect match for
your video, and will ignore any subtitles
that are in the same language as the
audio track, although you can override
this setting. If the video already contains
embedded subtitles, Emby won’t
download any additional ones unless
you specifically ask it to.
Watch live TV
If you have a TV tuner installed on your
PC, you can use Emby to watch live
television broadcasts. Click the Live TV
option in the Extras column, then click
the Add button to detect your installed
TV tuner. You can also add a guide
provider to help you find and record
programmes. Emby offers a choice
of two by default – Schedules Direct
and Xml TV – but you can add your own
if you have a preference.
Emby can download subtitles in any language you choose

like Chrome – the mouse pointer
changes to indicate scrolling.
Some other applications work in a
similar way – you can middle-click in a
Microsoft Word or WordPad document,
for example, then move the mouse up or
down to scroll automatically. Click again
to exit scroll mode.
Middle-click web links
Links on any browser’s web page can be
opened in a new tab by right-clicking
and selecting ‘Open link in new tab’.
Alternatively, you can just middle-click
the link to open it in a new tab, which is
faster and requires less effort.
Holding down Shift while middle-
clicking a web link sometimes modifies
the action. In Chrome, a basic middle-
click opens the link in a background tab,
while you remain on the current tab.
if you hold down Shift as you middle-
click a link, you’ll open it in a new tab
and also switch to it.
A bookmark is just another type of
link and all browsers open a middle-
clicked bookmark in a new tab. Use Shift
to choose whether to stay on the
current page or to switch to the new
tab. If you’ve organised your
bookmarks into folders, you can even
middle-click the folder to open all the
pages inside it in new tabs.
A browser’s forward and back
buttons are also links of a sort, and
middle-clicking them opens the
previous or next web page in a new
browser tab. Middle-click the
browser’s Home button to open
that in a new tab.
When you start typing in a
browser’s address box, a list of
suggested URLs is displayed so you
can stop typing early and select one.
If you don’t want to change the page
shown in the current tab, middle-click
a suggested URL to open it in a
separate background tab.
Tap your touchpad
If you have a laptop with a touchpad
and no buttons, it will respond to one,
two and possibly three- and four-
finger taps. Tap with one finger to
simulate clicking the left mouse
button and tap with two to produce
E
ven the most basic PC mouse should come with
a wheel between the clickable left and right panels.
Most often, it’s used for scrolling, but it can also
double as a third button. Depending on the program
you’re using, this can provide a quick way of performing
an additional action.
The function of the middle button varies from one
application to the next – the best way to find out what
it does is to experiment. For example, in Windows, you
can middle-click taskbar buttons to open a new window.
This is handy if you have one Explorer window open and
want to move files to another one.
You can middle-click Chrome, Edge and other taskbar
buttons to open new browser windows, too. When you’re
ready to close a window, hover over its button on the
taskbar. When the thumbnails appear, hover over the one
you want to close and middle-click it.
Click the mouse wheel
Scroll through long web pages
Click the mouse wheel on a web page
in Chrome and the cursor will change
into a four-way arrow in a circle. The
mouse can then be used to move the
page up, down, left or right, which may
be easier for browsing a long, wide page
than using the scrollbars. Click any
mouse button to exit this mode.
Middle-clicking works in a similar way
in Microsoft Edge. Position the mouse in
the middle of the screen and click the
scroll wheel. Moving the mouse up or
down scrolls the web page in the
appropriate direction. There is no
change to the mouse pointer to indicate
that this feature is activated.
This also works in Firefox, except –
Most mice have a wheel between the left and right
buttons, which often doubles as a third button

TAKE IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL
More advanced tips for when you’re feeling brave
the same effect as a mouse’s right-click.
Pushing up or down the touchpad with
two fingers is like spinning the wheel on
a mouse, which is useful for scrolling
through web pages and documents.
Slide two fingers left and right for
horizontal scrolling.
These are the standard gestures and
your computer’s touchpad may allow
more, depending on its make and
model. A three-finger tap can open the
Cortana/search box in Windows 10,
while a four-finger tap might launch the
Action Centre. Open the Control Panel,
switch to the small icons view and see
if you can find anything related to the
touchpad, such as Synaptics ClickPad.
Open it to see demonstrations of the
possible touches and taps, and to
enable or disable gestures.
Mouse wheel side-clicks
You won’t find this on all mice, but some
mouse wheels can be tilted left or right
to provide further functions. Most often,
this is used to scroll documents and
apps left or right.
Open the Control Panel and click
Mouse. On the Wheel tab, you may find
an option for horizontal scrolling by
tilting the wheel. You can choose how
many characters at a time to scroll.
To switch NeatMouse on or off,
press the Scroll Lock key. When it is
on, pressing the Num Lock key
enables the keypad on the right to
emulate mouse functions. The up,
down, left and right arrow keys move
the mouse; ‘0’ works as the left mouse
button; Enter is the right mouse
button; and ‘5’ is the middle button.
NeatMouse works in combination
with a standard mouse or touchpad,
so you can use it to add a middle-
click. Tap ‘5’ to middle-click, then use
the mouse or touchpad as usual.
There are options to redefine the keys
if your PC’s keyboard doesn’t have
a separate number pad.
Firefox configuration
By default, Firefox works like other
web browsers but it also provides an
option to configure it differently. Type
about:config into the address bar
and press Enter to show all the
configuration settings. Now, type
middle into the search box. Double-
click ‘middlemouse.paste’ to set it to
True, and from now on, the middle
mouse button will paste the contents
of your clipboard. If you copy a URL,
for example, middle-clicking in the
address box pastes it in. Double-click
‘middlemouse.paste’ again to set it to
False and return the middle-click to its
normal function.
Get a middle-click
on your touchpad
Some laptops have
physical buttons for
left- and right-clicks,
and pressing both at the
same time can work as
a middle-click.
Alternatively, many
modern trackpads have
no buttons at all and the
touchpad itself is
clicked like a button.
Depending on the driver hardware, it
may be possible to configure it to
produce a middle-click, too.
It doesn’t work on every touchpad but
it is worth trying.
Open the Control Panel and click
Synaptics ClickPad or Mouse, then
ClickPad Settings. Select Clicking,
then click the gear icon on the right.
There are several options and clicking
them shows a list of actions that can
be performed by different gestures.
For example, you could configure it to
assign a three-finger tap or a tap in
a specific corner as a middle click.
Use a mouse emulator
If you don’t have a mouse with
a middle button – or the wheel only
scrolls and doesn’t click; or you have
a laptop with a touchpad that doesn’t
support middle-clicking – there is still
hope in the form of the free mouse
emulator NeatMouse (bit.ly/mou433).
It lets you use your keyboard to move
the mouse pointer; and to left-, right-
and middle-click.
There are standard and portable
options available during installation.
If you choose the portable version,
the tool will appear in a folder on your
Desktop. Open the folder and run the
program any time you need to use it.
It’s customisable but the default
settings are fine for most people.
Check the touchpad’s taps and swipes for
middle-click and other gestures
Can your mouse wheel tilt? Check the
mouse settings in the Control Panel
Can’t middle-click? Use NeatMouse to simulate middle-clicks with the keyboard
Some touchpads let you configure a middle-click action

Restore lost notifications
Q
I used to get regular notifications
on my Windows 10 PC telling me,
for example, that it was safe to eject
a drive or that my antivirus software
had completed a job. Since installing
the Creators Update, however, they’ve
stopped. I’m not sure when this
happened exactly but it was definitely
some time after I installed the update.
I’ve checked the Settings, which seem
to be in order, and I tried running
sfc /scannow from the Command
Prompt, but it reported no problems.
How do I re-enable notifications?
Graham DA Hefferman, via email
A
There may be a problem but it
could simply be that the settings
have changed and some messages are
now switched off. To check, open the
Control Panel, go to ‘Devices and
Printers’, right-click the USB drive and
select Properties. On the Hardware tab,
select the device and click Properties.
In the next window, click ‘Change
settings’ and open the Policies tab.
If ‘Quick removal’ is selected (which it
usually is, by default) you won’t see any
notifications about removing a USB
device. Only when ‘Better performance’
is selected do you need to wait for
a message saying it’s safe to remove
a device.
Some apps have their own settings for
notifications, and these must be
configured for notifications to work.
Open the Mail app, for example, and
click the cog icon, then select
Notifications. Here, you’ll see a switch
to ‘Show notifications in the Action
Center’. Tick the box to ‘Show a
notification banner’. It’s possible for
Mail notifications to be switched on
in Windows Settings, System,
‘Notifications & actions’, but turned off
in the Mail app’s settings, in which case
you won’t receive notifications. It must
be enabled in both places to work.
Check Kaspersky for similar
notifications settings, because they may
be switched off within the program.
In Windows Settings (Windows+i),
choose System, then ‘Notifications &
actions’ to see a list of apps that can
display notifications. They all have
switches. Clicking the app name opens
detailed settings that control how
notifications work for that app.
For example, it’s possible to have
Notifications switched on, but ‘Show
notifications in Action Centre’ switched
off. It’s confusing, to say the least.

Fix a troublesome
touchscreen
Q
I’m having problems with the
touchscreen on my Sony Vaio
laptop, which runs Windows 10 Pro
64-bit. A transparent circle appears
at the bottom of the screen over the
toolbar and when this happens, the
mouse cursor keeps disappearing as
soon as I stop moving the mouse. If I try
to drag the transparent circle with my
finger, it eventually disappears and the
touchscreen works properly, but it’s
very awkward and time consuming.
If I disable USB Input Device under
Human Interface Devices in Device
Manager, the transparent circle problem
disappears, but then I can’t use the
touchscreen. I’ve reinstalled Windows 10
and updated all the relevant drivers.

A few other people have reported
this problem, and they have found
some strange solutions. One person
discovered that pressing Windows+P

‘PC screen only’ solved the problem.
Q
Is it possible to add more icons to
the options that appear when you
try to change the icon of a folder?
Barry Singleton, via email
A
The folder icons you see on the
Desktop and in Explorer are easy
to change. Right-click an icon and
select Properties on the menu, then
choose the Customise tab. The easiest
way to customise the icon is to have a
photo in the folder, then click Choose
File and select it. The icon changes to
an open folder, and the photo appears
as a document inside the folder.
To change the icon completely, click
Change Icon. This reveals a collection
of icons from the ‘shell32.dll’ folder,
but you can access more by clicking
Browse and selecting ‘C:\Windows\
System32\moricons.dll’.
You can find thousands of icons
on the web, but to be used as
Windows icons they must have an ICO
filename extension. Lots of websites
offer ICO files, such as Icon Archive
(www.iconarchive.com). Browse the
icons and, when you see one you
want, move the mouse over it and
click the ICO option that appears in
the top-right corner. Click the Change

Of the three programs you mention
in your email, AquaSnap (www
.nurgo-software.com) offers a free
version that you should try. MaxTo
(maxto.net) looks similar but isn’t free,
and SplitView (www.splitview.com)
looks useful but costs $39 (around £29).
However, many of the features offered
by these tools are built into Windows 10,
so you may already have everything you
need. They basically help you arrange
windows on large monitors so they
don’t overlap. Open Windows Settings
(Windows+i) and go to System, Multi-
tasking. Turn on all the switches on the
right under Snap.
If you now drag a window to the left
or right edge of the screen, it snaps to
fill exactly half the screen. This lets you
split the monitor down the middle with
an application on either side. If you drag
a window into the corner, it fills a
quarter of the screen, so you can show
four windows with no overlapping.
You can use different combinations,
Someone else found that the bezel
surrounding the screen was causing the
problem. They placed a suction cup next
to the circle and pulled the bezel away
from the screen a tiny bit, which fixed it.
Someone else switched off the laptop
and cleaned the screen. Apparently it
was caused by dirt. Another possible fix
is to open Windows Settings, click ‘Ease

turn off ‘Touch feedback’.
It could be a driver problem, in which
case an update might help. Right-click
Start and select Device Manager.
Expand ‘Display adapters’, then right-
click each item and select ‘Update

Split a widescreen monitor
Q
Looking back over the past year of
Web User, I’ve noticed that monitors
have been getting bigger, both in size
and in the number of pixels. When I first
used a computer at work, we made do
with one monitor each. Later, companies
that could afford it equipped us with
two, and now some firms, especially in
the city, use four large screens.
With suitable software, just one of
these new wide-screen monitors can be
split electronically into two areas, each
working independently, which would be
fine for home use. I found a few options
and would appreciate your opinion.

Q
I have a problem with duplicate
Documents folders in Windows 10.
When I open File Explorer, I see four
folders called Documents, each of
which has the same contents. The
only difference is that each folder has
a different icon representing music,
videos, pictures and documents.
According to their Properties, the
folders have the same contents and
location: ‘d:\video editing’. I assume
the term ‘video editing’ is a library
label because the contents are actually
in a folder called Documents that
I created on the D: drive. How do
I remove the three Documents folders
I don’t need?
Clive Davies, via email
A
You should have four system
folders – Documents, Pictures,
Music and Videos – which should
open the corresponding folders in
C:\Users\YourName. Right-click each
Documents folder and select
Properties. Open the Location tab and
click Restore Default. If that doesn’t
work, use the Move button to select
the correct Documents, Pictures,

GENERAL PC
Reset your system folders if you’re

Get free calls to mobiles
Q
I recently saw an advert for an
Android and iOS app called Voico
(www.voico.com), which promises free
– or nearly free – phone calls and texts
between users of the app in most
countries. Is this too good to be true?
Neil Bone, via email
A
This is just one of many Skype-like
apps that offer phone calls, texts
and chats, and we can’t see anything
to make it stand out from the crowd.
You can make Voico-to-Voico calls and
texts for free, because they use the
internet, but it costs money to call
a non-Voico phone number.
The reviews are mostly positive but
there are some negative ones. If you can
persuade all your friends to get Voico,
it could be useful. However, there are
more popular apps that they’re more
likely to have already, such as Facebook
Messenger, which lets you place voice
and video calls. FaceTime is popular
among iOS users; Skype and Viber have
over half a billion installs; and WhatsApp
has over 1 billion users. All of them let
you make free app-to-app phone calls.

Test your internet speed

Did you know that you can now test your
internet speed directly from Google
without having to install an add-on
or use another service (such as www
.speedtest.net)? Just type speed test
into Chrome’s address bar, press Enter
and click Run Speed Test on the page
that loads.
A pop-up window appears and,
after the test has finished, it displays
a summary of your upload rate,
download rate and latency. Below this,
there’s also a summary of what these
speeds mean in real terms, such as being
able to handle “multiple devices

Although speedtest.net is a perfectly
good service, I prefer using this new tool

Remove file associations

I found a much simpler method for
removing file associations than the very
complicated workaround that appeared
in Readers’ Helpdesk in Issue 430 (bit.ly/

notepad document and save it to your
desktop as “test.exe”. Now right-click
the file you want to remove a program
association from and choose ‘Open with’
and ‘test.exe’. Leave ‘Always use this

a program, the file you’re opening it with
will have no program associated with it.

to have it if catastrophe strikes.
In Chrome, open the three-line menu

The clock at the right side of the

Take hands-free photos on
Samsung devices
Issue 432 of Web User (bit.ly/
webuser432) included a handy tip about
installing additional camera modes on
a Samsung Galaxy S6, such as a sports
mode and an animated GIF option. I have
a Samsung phone, so this got me to
delving into its camera settings.
I discovered some really handy options
for triggering photos when you’re not
holding the camera, such as when you’ve
positioned it on a tripod or propped it
against an object to take a group photo.
To see these options, open the camera,
tap the Settings cog and look for the
option ‘Ways to take pictures’. This
includes a ‘Gesture control’ option, which
lets you take snaps by holding your hand
out with your palm facing the camera.
Tap back and scroll up and you can
enable an entry called ‘Voice control’,
which lets you say “capture” or “shoot”
to take a photo, or “record video” to start
filming. I find this more effective than the
gesture option but there’s less of a delay,
so make sure you’re ready for your photo
when you give the command.
You can also choose to ‘Tap to take
pictures’ and ‘Use heart rate sensor’,
both of which make capturing selfies
easier when you’re holding the device.

Stop Twitter guessing your
age and gender
I was poking around in Twitter’s settings
and found the weirdest thing. Click your
profile picture and then click ‘Settings
and privacy’. Click Your Twitter data and
enter your password to continue. If you
did not enter your age or gender when
you signed up with Twitter, it guesses
them based on your tweets.
It obviously thinks my tweets have a
feminine slant because it says my gender
is female! It’s also clueless about my age
and thinks I am between 13 to 54,
which is a very broad guess if you ask
me. There are links to change them
if it bothers you, but I like the fact that
Twitter doesn’t know who I am.

SOCIAL MEDIA
Block unwanted chatterboxes
If you’re being pestered by people on
Facebook who you don’t want to chat
with, or you’re busy and don’t want to
be distracted by anyone, you can apply
settings to block them. If the chat
window is minimised to a little bar in the
bottom-right corner, click the gear icon,
then click Advanced Settings.
There are three options. Click the
first option to “Turn off chat for some
contacts only” and enter names in the
box to block specific people. The second
option blocks all chats except the people
whose names you enter, such as your
family or best friends. Click the third
option if you want to block all chats,
regardless of who they are from.
Don’t worry about missing anything
because chat messages are diverted to
your Facebook inbox, so you can read
them later when (or if) it suits you.

Unlock individual files in the
iPhoto library
Some months ago, my old Mac died.
I immediately regretted that I hadn’t
backed up my files, especially my photos.
Eventually, I decided to see if I could
recover any of the files by removing
the Mac’s hard drive and placing it
in a USB enclosure.
When I plugged the enclosure into my
new Mac, I was delighted to find that
I could browse all my files. However,
my photos were contained in an iPhoto
library and clicking it gave me no option
to access them individually.
A Mac-savvy friend then suggested
that I might be able to see the files by
pressing Ctrl when clicking the library,
then selecting ‘Show package contents’.
Thankfully, this worked perfectly and
I was able to copy and paste all the
original files from folders organised by
year and month. I thought I’d pass on
the advice in case any other readers ever
need to access files stored in an old
iPhoto library.

AuraTodd, Web User Forums

If I were you, I’d use your friend’s
laptop to create Windows 10
installation media on a USB device or
DVD (see bit.ly/win433). Once you’ve
done that, hold down the power button
to shut down your PC, then press and
hold F2 or the appropriate key to get into
the BIOS. From there, you can change
the boot order so that you can boot from
an installation disc or a USB drive.
Boot from the drive and load the setup
page. Confirm the time and currency
settings before clicking ‘Repair your
computer’. Next, click Troubleshoot and
see if the option to ‘Go back to the
previous version’ works. If it doesn’t,
select Command Prompt and type
rstrui.exe before clicking OK, which
gives you access to any restore points
on your PC.
The update that caused the problems
will eventually install again, but hopefully
it won’t cause any problems this time.

mrmatt, Web User

In the short term,
you can just click the
Pause button and leave
the tab open in your browser, then come
back to it. In the longer term, the best
idea is to click the Pause button, then
right-click the video screen and select
‘Copy video URL at current time’.
You can now save this link somewhere,
and when you open it again, the video
will resume where you left off.
Peru, Web User Forums
Web User says: Provided you’re logged
into your Google account, YouTube
should remember how much of a video
you’ve watched. Another option, if you’re
signed in, is to click the ‘Add to’ button
below a video, then tick ‘Watch later’.
From the main menu (or Library on the

carry on watching where you left off.
If this doesn’t fix it, look further
down the ‘Region & Language’ page
and click ‘Additional date, time &

choose ‘Change input methods’. Check
that the keyboard layout listed under

WebExtensions will make
Firefox useless
Firefox is about to switch from add-ons
to WebExtensions. As a result, all my
useful extensions (the main reason I use
Firefox) have been marked
as ‘legacy’, and Mozilla
intends to disable
every single one of
them in the next
version of Firefox.
Ironically, this
includes the
company’s own
labs products.
Many of the most
popular extensions haven’t been updated
because that would require a complete
rewrite. At this rate, Firefox will soon be
as useless as Edge.
Could the Web User team please
explore and publish an article on this?

Looking for a Watchlist
replacement
Since Radio Times closed its wonderful
Watchlist (bit.ly/watchlist433), I’ve been
looking for a replacement. I tried out the
Series Organizer tool (bit.ly/serorg431)
suggested in Issue 431 of Web User
but it couldn’t cope with some of the
Freeview channels and told me that
some series had ended when in fact
they’d only just started showing on
Drama or Yesterday. Would it be possible
to have a feature on the other options
available? Watchlist was great, because
I could list my favourite programmes,
whether they were current or not, and it
would tell me which of them were on,
day by day, for the next few weeks. It was
invaluable for programming my DVD
recorder when going on a fortnight’s
H
ere we go again. Apple
is about to release yet
another upgrade to the
iPhone – to howls of delight from
slavering fanboys and indifferent
yawns from anyone who has
a lick of sense.
Every year, Apple comes up
with a couple of minor tweaks –
a slightly larger screen, a slightly
better camera – and removes
something that people found
useful, such as the headphone
jack or Home button. It then uses
these “groundbreaking” improvements
to justify whacking up the price of its
already ridiculously expensive phone
even further. This year, Apple obviously
thought it might as well round up the
price to a nice even grand (well, £999
– so not far off) and then sit back and
watch the orders ﬂood in.
Only a fool would pay a grand for a phone
Sadly, this is exactly what will happen
because there are plenty of fools out
there who will eagerly part with their
money just to have what they believe to
be the latest cutting-edge technology.
But who exactly are they trying to
impress? Each other? Their work
colleagues who have lesser but perfectly
useable phones, for which they
paid a ﬁfth of the price? People
who could put £1,000 to much
better use than purchasing a
ﬂashy gadget, such as spending it
on food, clothes and heating?
Of course, it’s completely up to
the individuals if they want to
waste their money on an iPhone
X. I just wonder if they really, truly
believe it’s worth the investment?
After all, this time next year,
Apple will bring out the iPhone XI,
or 11, for £1,100, and the current
phone will be rendered out of date
and unfashionable. Why bother?
Personally, I’ll stick with my Moto
G4, which may not be top of the range
but serves me perfectly well for
browsing, streaming and – oh yes
– making phone calls.

Phones should be banned
from classrooms
I read in your latest issue that school
teachers “waste 17 minutes per day
policing phone-related disruptions”.
I don’t understand why phones are
allowed into classrooms in the ﬁrst place.
Surely, children should be
told to put them away
at the beginning of
the lesson and
reprimanded if
they don’t comply.
Or, even better,
they should be
told not to bring
them to school in
the ﬁrst place.
Previous generations of schoolchildren,
including myself and my own children,
managed to get through the day without
texting, tweeting and playing games.
I dread to think how today’s teachers
cope when their pupils’ attention is
constantly drifting to their screens.

Forget Wi-Fi kettles –
just use a timer!
Regarding your ‘Wi-Fi
wonders’ feature in Issue
431 (bit.ly/webuser431).
What is it with all you
young ‘with it’ cool people?
Phone your kettle to check
the water level and switch
it on?! Do you think this
idea is new? Haven’t you
heard of tea and coffee
machines with timers?
There are plenty of them
available. You simply set
the machine before you go out, or the
night before, as I do.
You can do this easily with percolators
of all prices, although not yet with
Nespresso, Rombouts or any other pod
or capsule machines. Those may be able
to do lattes, Americanos and
cappuccinos, but not on a timer. The
nearest you get to that utopia is the
four-way pod, ground, ESE and tea
machine, but you still have to switch it on
manually. You can get a good timer
percolator for as little as £25 for 10 small
cups or ﬁve or six normal ones.
As for George Clooney’s Nespresso,
I make four of those things in one large
cup – otherwise it’s not worth the bother
for a thimbleful of coffee.

Tor doesn’t work well
in practice
My main problem with the secure Tor
browser is that it makes using the web
ridiculously slow. If you only want to visit
normal sites,
you’re better off
using Chrome
or Firefox. If you
want to look at
hidden sites,
you often spend
ages waiting for
them to load,
only to ﬁnd that
they’ve
disappeared.
I’ve also found
that logging into secure sites such as
online banks is impossible with Tor, and
it’s annoying having to enter your
usernames and passwords all the time,
because Tor doesn’t save any cookies.
Tor is a good idea in theory, but in
practice I’ve found it very frustrating. In
my experience, rather than giving you
unfettered access to the web, it
impedes your access to it, and
the beneﬁts of anonymity are
undermined by the fact that it’s
so unreliable.
Roger Godfrey, via email
What has Web User
got to hide?
In your cover feature in Issue 432,
you explain how to stay 100%
anonymous using Tor. On page
28, you tell us how to disguise
your location using ProtonVPN
and on page 50 you reveal how to make
everything self-destruct “leaving no trace
of your conﬁdential ﬁles and chats”.
Then, on page 56, you show us how to
blur details in your YouTube videos and,
on page 57, how to manage all your
private data in one place. All very useful
advice, I’m sure, especially for
paranoiacs, but it does make we wonder:
what exactly has Web User got to hide
and from whom!? Perhaps you’ll reveal all
in a subsequent issue!

Left and right hands must
work together
In his Star Email in Issue 432, Ian
Robinson complains that left-handed
computer users are mistreated by their
co-workers and overlooked by hardware
manufacturers, which seems a fair point.
However, he then proceeds to regale
us, with relish, about the time he
deliberately confused his co-workers
by leaving his PC mouse and keyboard
set up for left-handed use. Mr Robinson
appears to ﬁnd this hilarious, but
surely this antagonism and mockery
of right-handed people makes him
just as bad as they are.
Why can’t we all just respect one
another’s physical traits, and treat
left- and right-handedness equally,
instead of pitching one against the
other? Only with both hands working in
tandem can we make a better and
happier, ambidextrous world.

Being a southpaw isn’t a
choice
Hear, hear, George (Inbox, Issue 432).
There’s certainly nowt wrong with being
a ‘cuddy wifter’ when it comes to using
computers, and as a lifelong lefty I’ve
never had any problems with my
keyboard and mouse, although of course
I’ve changed the latter to left-handed
settings. I also disagree with your Star
Email writer about the term ‘southpaw’
being derogatory and offensive. I’ve
always found it quite endearing. I believe
the word comes from baseball, referring
to a left-handed pitcher or batter. I’ve
heard worse names for us lefties, such as
‘mollie dooker’, ‘spuddy handed’ and
‘gibble ﬁsted’, but tend to treat them
with amusement rather than outrage.
Being left-handed isn’t a choice, after
all. It’s as genetic as being red-haired or
short-sighted, so anyone who uses it as
a reason to mock you is an idiot and not
worth speaking to!

Why the slow download
speed?
I sympathise with John
McCloy (Inbox, Issue 431),
who says he receives
download speeds of
only 0.6Mbps. I live in
Cardiff, about 60
yards from a roadside
green cabinet and just
over a mile from the
telephone exchange, yet
I can only get download
speeds of between 0.1 to
0.6Mbps. Curiously, when I perform
a speed test using one of the many
programs available for this, it gives
a reading of 3-4.5Mbps. Why is this?
My ISP sent an engineer to test my
system but couldn’t ﬁnd any problem.
Maybe it’s time BT Openreach checked
the state of the connection to my house,
although with Virgin Media cable in the
road, I doubt I would be a priority.

Do you agree? Let us know at webuser@dennis.co.uk
Instead, I’ll do something that doesn’t
come easily – I’ll sympathise with old
Sugar because as a parent of a newly
minted teenager and another young
daughter, I know full well the infuriating
phenomenon
of being
‘phubbed’:
snubbed by
someone in
favour of
their phone.
There are
a few ways to
deal with this social exclusion zone.
First off, there’s Lord Sugar’s nuclear
option: ban all devices from the dinner
table. It’s not a bad start but prising a
smartphone from a teenager’s hands is
like removing a limpet from a rock with
a plastic teaspoon: easier said than done.
The problem is the siren call of
notifications. As soon as the phone
starts pinging with Snapchat
notifications, Instagram posts and
whatever else kids use to emoji one
another these days, they’ll be rushing
Barry Collins tackles a very modern problem
– getting kids to put their phones down
Page 404
back to their phones faster than you
can say “pass the gravy”.
One way to counter this is to apply
access controls. Even basic Wi-Fi
routers such as the BT Home Hub have
the option to block
selected devices from
accessing the internet
during certain times.
You can apply these
controls while you’re
eating meals or during
set periods each day,
so that the kids can’t
go online after 9pm – unless they’re
using their mobile data, which you can
of course ration.
If you’re still finding it’s a problem,
there are dedicated apps such as
Screentime (screentimelabs.com), which
can be used to impose a prison-style
lights out. Screentime’s most compelling
feature is the house-wide ‘pause’ button.
If you’re fed up with that constant
“just finishing this level” cry every time
you call your brood to the dinner table,
you can press the Pause button on your
own phone and all the devices in the
house will be locked with an immovable
pause screen, making resistance futile.
Access to such premium features costs
£2.99 per month, but some parents may
consider that a price worth paying if it
brings the house to order immediately.
The final option is the hardest to
implement, but the most effective:
parenting. Phubbing people is just rude,
and if I’m being honest, my kids
probably picked it up from me checking
work emails, football scores or
something else while sat at the table.
As Lord Giddens noted when Lord
Sugar sat down after making his speech:
“He has so far looked at his device three
times since he finished speaking”.
Sometimes you reap what you sow.
Prising a smartphone out
of a teenager’s hands is like
removing a limpet from a rock
with a plastic teaspoon
“T
here is something wrong
with young people in
society today,” said Lord
Sugar in a recent debate
in the House of Lords. To everyone’s
surprise, he wasn’t talking about
contestants on The Apprentice.
“I have seven grandchildren and on the
very odd occasion that I am blessed with
their coming to my home to have dinner,
they sit around the table with their faces
buried in their smartphones – to such
an extent that I have banned the devices
from the dining room,” Lord Alan of
Amstrad moaned. “I urge parents to take
a stance to prevent their children
spending too much time gazing into
these devices.”
What’s a parent to do? One might
suggest replacing the kids’ smartphone
with an Amstrad E-m@iler – the
pay-as-you-go email terminals that
Sugar made several attempts to flog
at the turn of the century – because
nobody used those devices. But that
would be churlish, cynical and
potentially libellous, so I won’t.
