Introduction
W
elcome to the world of business performance management (BPM), 
and welcome to PerformancePoint Server 2007 (PPS). It’s easier than 
you think to create and deploy a BPM solution for your organization. We are 
going to show you the fastest and easiest way to do the following:
 
✓ Create a framework to manage the planning and budgeting activities 
within your company
 
✓ Create reports, scorecards, and dashboards that communicate how 
your company is doing; enabling your users to get the information they 
need when they need it
 
✓ Analyze your data to get to the root of business issues
PerformancePoint Server: Bringing 
Performance Management 
to Your Organization
PPS is Microsoft’s premier BPM development platform. It is composed of two 
primary components:
 
✓ PPS Planning: Enables developers to create a framework for budgeting 
and planning activities through the managed and coordinated distribu-
tion and consolidation of Excel data entry templates throughout the 
organization
 
✓ PPS Monitoring and Analytics: Enables developers to create and deploy 
reports, scorecards, and dashboards through a reporting portal that 
can be used by managers and analysts to track and analyze the progress 
of the business plan or company strategy

2
Microsoft PerformancePoint 2007 For Dummies 
PPS is part of Microsoft’s highly integratable business intelligence (BI) stack 
and falls between these two services:
 
✓ Analysis Services, SQL Server, and Excel Services as data sources
 
✓ SharePoint as the front-end user portal
PPS integrates the monitoring power of Business Scorecard Manager with 
the analytical prowess of ProClarity, adding in the missing link of a planning 
component to complete the BPM cycle.
Who Should Read This Book — and Why
Whether you’re new to PerformancePoint Server or you need to find out how 
to expand the functionality of existing PPS instances, this book will serve 
you well. This book provides a detailed account of not only how to config-
ure planning applications, scorecards, and reports but also why you should 
choose one option over another and how those choices should be driven by 
your business approach.
One goal of the book is to keep code to a minimum. In addition, the following 
points better describe this book’s depth and intended audience:
 
✓ While we expect readers to be comfortable with technical concepts in 
general, we do not expect you to write complex MDX (multidimensional 
expression language) or PEL (PerformancePoint expression language) 
to get the job done. If you need additional assistance to fully leverage 
the capabilities of PPS through these means, we suggest reading other 
PPS guides that are intended for more advanced users. The goal here 
is to get you off the ground and running with the large breadth of func-
tionality that is available to you in a packed application.
 
✓ This book is also not intended for system administrators from the 
perspective of installing and maintaining the PPS application. At times, 
we reference some administrative functionality that is necessary to 
make certain functions work properly, but the initial installation and 
configuration of PPS should be done by an IT administrator.
So who is this book really written for? It is intended for the key players in a 
BPM implementation: analysts, developers, and decision makers.
First and foremost, PerformancePoint is an analyst’s application, because 
BPM is all about business analysis — planning your business and monitoring 
and analyzing your business performance.

3
 Introduction
Broadly defined, the analyst is an individual who sits between the business 
and the technology. At the heart of PPS is a business intelligence framework 
that is meant to use technology to provide analysis, monitoring, and planning 
to business users. More so than many other types of software, familiarity 
with the business concepts and needs is critical to the successful adoption 
of the technology.
How to Use This Book
Instead of reading the entire book before you start using PPS, note that the 
book has been separated into logical parts suited to particular needs. Few 
organizations will leverage all the pieces of PPS simultaneously. Rather, an 
organization will see a need that PPS can fill and will pursue that specific 
portion of the PPS application. Very likely, most readers will only ever read 
half of this book. The other half may simply not apply or be of interest. 
(Maybe farther down the line, your company will realize that it has additional 
tremendous capability it has already purchased and will choose to leverage 
that capability. Lucky you!)
If you want to focus on a particular topic, you can use the table of contents 
and index to access the right topic. Part II focuses entirely on the planning 
and budgeting aspect of PPS. Parts III and IV concentrate on the monitoring 
and analytics capabilities of PPS.
Throughout the book, we provide as many examples as possible. Working 
through the examples can assist the learning process, and you’ll gain a sense 
of the way the applications are organized and function. Of course, to work 
through the examples, you need a running instance of PPS with the relevant 
components configured.
How This Book Is Organized
This book groups related PPS components in parts. We recommend reading 
Part I to gain an understanding of the capabilities of the entire suite of 
functions and then honing in to your specific area of interest in Parts II, III, 
and/or IV.

4
Microsoft PerformancePoint 2007 For Dummies 
Part I: Planning and Reporting
In this part, you gain an understanding of who needs PPS and what it can do 
for all members of your organization. This includes getting familiar with the 
two sides of PPS (planning versus analytics) and familiarizing yourself with 
the general architecture of the application and what tools you’ll need along 
the way.
Part II: Applying Your Goals
Part II walks you through the myriad steps involved in creating a fully work-
ing planning and budgeting framework.
Part III: Building Your Business Reports
Part III is a step-by-step guide to understanding the building blocks 
(elements) of PPS: finding out what needs to be built and knowing how to 
build it. Each element has its own dedicated chapter. Unlike the rest of 
this book, users should read the chapters in this part in order. 
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing 
Your Business Reports
Part IV teaches end users (managers, analysts, and decision makers) how to 
use a PPS dashboard to get the information they need.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In Part V, we provide our top-ten recommendations for PerformancePoint 
and related references as well as our top-ten tips, tricks, and potential 
pitfalls.

ith the advent of new database technologies, the prospect of consoli-
dating and managing enormous amounts of data is becoming easier. 
The concept of data warehousing puts relevant, accurate, and well-organized 
data in the hands of eager users. Furthermore, the means to access that data 
in an efficient and easy-to-use way is also growing by leaps and bounds.
As data storage and management mature, so does a user’s desire to leverage 
that information to provide insight to the organization. PerformancePoint 
Server 2007 is designed for just that purpose. In today’s fast-paced corporate 
environment, access to company performance metrics is becoming more 
than a want — it has become a critical need to stay abreast of developments 
within the marketplace and within the company itself.
Integrating Microsoft’s Business 
Intelligence Stack
The PPS stack is composed of two primary domains that enable users and 
organizations to more easily attain a higher level of business intelligence:

10
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
 
✓ PerformancePoint Planning: The Planning component provides a 
centralized framework for consolidating budgeting and planning activity 
within an organization by funneling information from multiple users to a 
central data store and by providing the tools to manage the information-
gathering process through workflow. No more calling and soliciting 
budget figures by phone and harassing executive planners to get num-
bers in. No more figuring out how to combine budget numbers from 
different spreadsheets and cutting and pasting items from one work-
sheet to another to produce a consolidated report. PPS Planning can 
take care of this for you.
 
✓ PerformancePoint Monitoring and Analytics (M&A): The Monitoring 
and Analytics engine enables the quick implementation of a business 
performance management solution, providing insight to your business 
performance data.
In the first release of PPS Monitoring and Analytics, Microsoft provides a 
report development and dashboard deployment solution. Even better, 
incorporated into this release is an integration of Business Scorecard 
Manager. So, in addition to various charts and grids, users can incorporate 
powerful scorecards into a dashboard interface, and connect scorecards to 
other dashboard reports.
Shipped with PPS Monitoring and Analytics is ProClarity version 6.3, which 
is the version of ProClarity Microsoft released after its purchase of this 
application. 
 
Upon the next release of PPS M&A (version 2, due sometime in 2009), it is 
expected that ProClarity functionality will be integrated much more fully into 
the reporting and dashboard functionality. So for now, integrating ProClarity 
with PPS means importing ProClarity Analytics reports as components of your 
PPS dashboard. Reports created in Excel Web Services and Reporting Services 
are integrated in the same way.
Also, Microsoft hasn’t completely integrated the Planning and the Monitoring 
and Analytics functions. That’s not to say that you can’t run analytics against 
the planning cubes. However, that ability to peer into the underlying planning 
data from dashboards and scorecards isn’t as streamlined as one would 
think, given that both functions are contained in one package.
 
Although several points of integration have yet to occur, PerformancePoint 
Server can now provide an effective and easy solution for managing and 
disseminating powerful business planning and timely business performance 
management analytics.

 Chapter 1: Understanding PerformancePoint 2007
What PerformancePoint Can Do for You
Your company probably has a lot of data — budget data, data from adminis-
trative systems, and data from external systems. You probably have a lot 
of reports and pages that took a whole bunch of people a lot of time to put 
together. This requires even more time for your users to sort through to 
find the information they need.
But what many organizations don’t have is a way to efficiently and clearly 
deliver, monitor, and analyze a clear plan and corporate strategy tied to that 
data. This is where PerformancePoint triumphs — by allowing you to deploy 
and maintain the cycle of business performance planning, monitoring, and 
analysis.
Setting company goals with planning
PerformancePoint is designed to capture your company’s planning data 
from across the organization, consolidate it into a meaningful structure, and 
provide an easy-to-understand means of viewing that information.
Rather than relying on the solicitation of budget figures by the usual means, 
leverage PPS’s built-in workflow to distribute assignments to budget contrib-
utors, and then after the numbers are submitted, pass the budget figures to 
reviewers and approvers automatically. Reduce the time spent gathering and 
asking for budget figures, and spend more time analyzing and sharing results.
Wowing your users with reports
With PerformancePoint, you can deliver powerful, actionable, dynamic, and 
integrated business performance management reports, including charts and 
grids, to your users quickly and efficiently. And your users can view, analyze, 
format, and publish their reports when they need them, enabling them to 
make business decisions and take appropriate actions to reduce risks and 
increase profitability.
Helping your users make decisions
Business users need to know quickly which areas of the business are doing 
well and, more importantly, which are not. PerformancePoint gives them this 
power with key performance indicators, scorecards, and dashboards.

12
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
 
✓ Make key business decisions from key performance indicators (KPIs). 
KPIs provide a clear graphical representation of how a value is 
performing against its target.
 
✓ Highlight the good, the bad, and the ugly with scorecards. Scorecards 
bring together KPIs in a consolidated view and enable rollup to overall 
objectives with standardized scoring.
 
✓ Manage your business at a glance with dashboards. Dashboards 
provide users with a consolidated and integrated view of reports and 
scorecards that tell them how their business is performing. Dashboards 
also allow users to view and analyze trends over time and across organi-
zational hierarchies. Users can leverage many business analysis tech-
niques to dig deeper into the data to get the more detailed information 
they might need.
Imagining Your Workday 
with PerformancePoint
So how does PPS fit into your work life? How is this application going to make 
your job easier, better, and more efficient? Read on to find out.
Planners
Corporate planners tend to exist throughout all departments of a corpora-
tion. The critical process of planning and budgeting, then, spans the 
entire organization. Most analysts involved in the collection of planning 
figures spend an inordinate amount of time gathering the data rather than 
analyzing it.
With PerformancePoint Planning, you can do the following:
 
✓ You can forget about time spent on the phone tracking down budget 
figures across the organization. The planning components automatically 
notify contributors when it’s time to enter their numbers.
 
✓ Budgeting contributors can enter their figures into standardized and 
custom-tailored Excel worksheets.
 
✓ After the numbers are submitted, the PPS workflow manages any review 
and approval processes automatically. You have no more lost e-mail, 
you don’t wonder who has the next task, and you don’t have to sort 
through conflicting versions of spreadsheets.
 
✓ All the data is held within a central data store so that the reporting and 
history of a plan or budget come from a single source.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding PerformancePoint 2007
Streamline, track, manage, and consolidate — all with one application.
Developers
If you are a typical IT developer, you are asked to create report after report 
for a large group of business users. They need to see the data in numerous 
ways. No problem. But on the umpteenth iteration of essentially the same 
report, you ask yourself the following questions:
 
✓ Is there a better, more efficient way to deliver business information to 
my users?
 
✓ How can I get my users to self-service — to create their own specified 
reports — even if they don’t know a thing about SQL?
The following points provide solutions to these problems:
 
✓ Create a series of PerformancePoint dashboards that deliver 80 percent 
of what your users will use on a daily basis. You can start by taking 
that pile of report requests that are on your desk or that cumbersome 
financial report that you have to manually assemble every quarter.
 
✓ Expand the repertoire of reports beyond the tabular, and start showing 
users how PPS can provide better, more communicative, and more 
actionable data than they have seen. Interactive grids, charts, and 
scorecards highlight potential issues for analysts and decision makers 
while there is still time to take corrective action.
Executive management 
and decision makers
Selling executive management on an automated Business Performance 
Management (BPM) solution can be difficult. As so many executives can tell 
you, they already have a BPM solution. His name is Bob and he works down 
the hall. But as talented as Bob is, he cannot always deliver powerful and 
actionable reports in a timely fashion on the KPIs that impact your business. 
He can’t always tell you what’s good, what’s bad, and what to keep your eye 
on. And if Bob can’t tell you, you probably don’t know.
PerformancePoint dashboards enable you view your KPI monitoring solution 
on at least a daily basis, tracking actuals to targets and identifying warnings 
before they become full-blown issues that put your profitability and success 
at risk.
 
Bob is a nice guy, but his time could be put to better use.

14
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
When you come into the office, grab your coffee and open your Executive 
Management Dashboard page. Here you can see an overview of how your 
business is performing. A couple of simple drop-down filters let you look at 
that information one division or one region at time, right online. Yellow and 
red graphics in your scorecard tell you that something is wrong. Don’t want 
to find out how to navigate a PerformancePoint report to get more informa-
tion? That’s okay; that’s what your analysts are for. But when you do come to 
understand the data that drives those warnings, you will be empowered like 
never before to make the most appropriate business decisions and take cor-
rective action when it has the biggest impact — now.
Analysts
You are the heart and soul (and brains) of PerformancePoint. Here’s why:
 
✓ You determine what dashboards to create and what reports and 
scorecards they contain.
 
✓ You establish the business rules that tell you and your decision makers 
when an issue needs to be addressed.
 
✓ You review your PerformancePoint dashboards, using their analytical 
capabilities to drill into the key drivers of business performance issues 
(and successes).
 
✓ You export your reports to presentations that your boss will get all the 
credit for (for now).
But that’s okay. You are on the front lines of the business performance 
management revolution. Soldier on.

Chapter 2
Knowing What PPS 
Components You Need
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out what applications and components you need to get started
▶ Viewing the Planning and Monitoring and Analytics component architecture
G
etting started can sometimes be the hardest part of implementing a 
new technology. It helps to have an idea of what needs to be installed 
and what components you will directly interact with. Of course, this can vary 
depending on whether you are planning or monitoring.
What You Need for Building a Plan
While the planning component consists of multiple parts, you will spend 
most of your time in Planning Business Modeler. (But you can expect to have 
your hand in every part of the planning component to fully build out a plan-
ning application.)
Given the breadth of functionality supported by PPS in the planning domain, 
you’ll find a decent amount of complexity to the components.
Preparing your application infrastructure
Before launching into the meat of the Modeler tool, ensure that these pieces 
are in place:

16
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
 
✓ An installed and configured Planning Server
 
✓ Accessibility to Planning Administration Console
 
✓ Accessibility to data sources through the Planning Server
Most of this work should be completed by your system administrator. It 
involves a lot of installation and configuration, rather than designing work.
The Planning Server is a set of Microsoft Analysis Server cubes with possible 
connections to data sources (usually Microsoft SQL Server). The Planning 
Administration Console provides Web-based access to the configuration and 
administration of the Planning Server and the users entitled to access the 
Planning Server. To alter settings within Planning Administration Console, 
you’ll need to be designated as a global administrator to perform most of the 
functions. However, some functionality may be granted to you as a data, user, 
or modeler administrator if you aren’t assigned as a global administrator.
After your planning application is up and running, the budgeting and plan-
ning figures will be stored, tracked, and analyzed through the Analysis 
Services cubes on the Planning Server. You can then use the functionality of 
PerformancePoint Monitoring and Analytics to access that data for further 
insight and reporting.
Figure 2-1 provides a schematic for the components within the Planning 
component of PPS.
Within PPS Planning, data comes from two different angles:
 
✓ The Planning component provides a means to use corporate data 
structures to model the structure and organization of the business. That 
data is imported into a central data store (a Microsoft Analysis Services 
cube). The modeler uses that data to create a budgeting and planning 
framework through specialized Excel worksheets called form templates.
 
✓ The second set of data comes from the budget planners and business 
people. Using the form templates created by the modeler, the budget 
contributor enters his numbers into the forms and submits the forms 
back to the planning server.
 
 The cube inherently understands how to combine and store the 
information for retention and reporting.

Part I: Planning and Reporting 
Building your model with 
Business Modeler
Planning Business Modeler is the primary tool you will use when preparing to 
build a model. For Modeler to work properly, you’ll need the following items:
 
✓ An instance of Planning Business Modeler on your machine
 
✓ Connectivity from Planning Business Modeler to the Planning Server
 
✓ A local copy of Excel (preferably 2007)
 
✓ The PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel for authoring form templates
If all the administrative components have been set up for you, you may 
only work within the world of Planning Business Modeler and Excel, but 
that’s unlikely. Most likely, you’ll need to tap the functionality of Planning 
Administrative Console at some point, whether to configure data sources, 
add new users, or perform a host of other tasks.
Planning Business Modeler is where you configure your models. You use 
data from external data sources to create dimensions. You mix and match 
dimensions to form models. And then you wrap those models with cycles, 
assignments, and process management to make the whole thing work like a 
well-oiled machine.
In the modeling phase, you’ll also use the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel 
to author templates for your users.
 
For more information on Planning Business Modeler, see Chapters 5 and 6.
Adding your data with Excel
Because Excel is the only mechanism for entering budgeting and planning 
data into PerformancePoint, each end user (including you) needs to have 
PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel installed. Users who don’t have Excel 
cannot use your solution. The Add-in performs the following two primary 
functions:
 
✓ Authoring: Allows the Modeler to create form templates for everyone 
else to use. These form templates will eventually be distributed to the 
contributors for data entry.
 
✓ Assignment: Enables the contributors to see budgeting data entry tasks 
assigned to them; and to enter, review, and/or approve budget figures.

19
 Chapter 2: Knowing What PPS Components You Need
Adding data is accomplished through the assignment of cycles coupled with 
form templates. Users are notified via e-mail that forms are ready for their 
input. They have a certain amount of time to enter that data, and then the 
process management automatically distributes the results to the right folks 
for review and approval.
 
For more information on the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel, see 
Chapter 7.
What You Need for Presenting 
and Analyzing Data
Many components for PerformancePoint Monitoring and Analytics exist 
behind the scenes, at least as far as you are concerned. You can find servers, 
databases, and services — oh my. But when someone else is done installing 
all of that, the following components are essential to being able to build and 
deploy your business performance dashboards, shown in Figure 2-2:
 
✓ Data sources
 
✓ Dashboard Designer
 
✓ Monitoring Server
 
✓ Dashboard Viewer
 
✓ Dashboard Viewer for SharePoint Services

Part I: Planning and Reporting 
Locating your business performance data
Business performance data is the first prerequisite for business performance 
management reporting. Business data exists in many formats, including the 
following:
 
✓ Analysis Services cubes
 
✓ Excel workbooks or Excel Web Services workbooks
 
✓ SQL Server data marts and tables
PerformancePoint even allows you to consolidate data of differing formats 
into one business performance solution.
 
Your first step is to identify where your business data is located so that you 
can connect to it. For more information on data sources, see Chapter 9.
Building reporting and analytics 
with Dashboard Designer
Dashboard Designer is the desktop application that you use to create all 
the pieces, or elements, that you need to assemble and ultimately deploy a 
business performance dashboard to your business users. Elements include 
the following:
 
✓ Data sources
 
✓ KPIs
 
✓ Scorecards
 
✓ Reports
 
✓ Dashboards
 
For more information about Dashboard Designer and elements, see Chapter 8.
Saving and sharing your reporting and 
analytics with Monitoring Server
Monitoring Server stores current and prior versions of all the elements that 
all your PPS developers create. You save your work to Monitoring Server by 
publishing your items from Dashboard Designer.

21
 Chapter 2: Knowing What PPS Components You Need
 
For more information on publishing and retrieving elements from your PPS 
Monitoring Server, see Chapter 8.
Viewing and testing dashboards 
with Dashboard Viewer
Dashboard Viewer is a Web site that allows you to preview and test your 
dashboards in a Web environment prior to deploying them to SharePoint.
 
For more information about previewing your dashboards, see Chapter 14.
Deploying dashboards to users with 
Dashboard Viewer for SharePoint Services
SharePoint Server is, among other things, a Web portal environment. It 
can be used to centralize the distribution of information from a variety of 
Web interfaces. SharePoint allows you to publish your PerformancePoint 
dashboards to your end users in a centralized, customizable, and interactive 
Web environment.
What’s especially great about SharePoint is that it gives a more professional 
look and feel to your business performance reporting solution and it allows 
you to integrate into one seamless interface PerformancePoint dashboards 
with other Web-enabled applications that your company may use.
 
For more information about deploying your dashboards to SharePoint, see 
Chapter 14.
Making the Case with AdventureWorks
Throughout this book, you need to walk through examples to understand the 
intricacies of the development activities. For the most part, we would prefer 
to steer clear of having you manually create your own data for the exercises 
in the book. Instead, because all the components of PPS rely on Microsoft 
Analysis Services cubes, we use the AdventureWorks database included 
when your administrator installs Analysis Services.

22
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
AdventureWorks has some limitations, but it is available to users of 
PerformancePoint. Because AdventureWorks is generic enough for almost 
everyone to understand, it can provide a sufficient test bed for this book.
AdventureWorks supplies a wealth of commonly used concepts and data 
structures that you will probably find to be somewhat similar to your own 
business. What business doesn’t sell a product of some sort, have employ-
ees, and have departments? The benefit of the AdventureWorks data is that 
it is well organized, full featured, and easy to understand. The availability of 
these common data elements is enough to justify using AdventureWorks.
Of course, while we use AdventureWorks as a foundation for the examples in 
this book, we fully expect you to apply the same concepts to your own data 
sources, whether now or in the future.

Chapter 3
Determining Your Goals 
by Planning the Plan
In This Chapter
▶ Getting chummy with budgeting and forecasting
▶ Asking yourself the right questions
▶ Streamlining the planning process
▶ Getting ready to build your planning application
A
lthough most of this book is about using the technology of 
PerformancePoint Server, taking a moment to think about the Planning 
module from a business context can provide a framework for a successful 
implementation. Later chapters spend plenty of time providing the how-to 
information for building applications and models. In this chapter, we 
show what you’re getting into (implementing an integrated performance 
management solution), what you’re building (a collaborative environment for 
monitoring and analyzing business operations), and how it can all work in 
the end (to drive better business outcomes).
This chapter also presents the nuts and bolts (dimensions, members, and 
member sets) that are the basic building blocks of a planning application. 
Understanding the meanings, differences, and interrelationships among these 
building blocks is critical in the tasks of both building a planning application 
from scratch and revising an existing application. Mastery of these concepts 
will likely be key to a meaningful, useful, adopted, and thus successful 
application.
Past getting to know dimensions and members is the process of translating a 
company’s operations into a set of dimensions and members. This extension 
of understanding the relationship between your business and how it can 
be recast and described as dimensions and members is possibly the most 
critical part of the preparation process because all subsequent activities are 
centered around how these pieces can be structured, used, broken down, 
separated, and made to accurately depict the way the company actually 
runs. Without good translation, the plan cannot be useful to anyone in the 
company.

24
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
Basic Planning Concepts
Creating a company business plan can often be considered a harrowing and 
difficult task. Problems can arise during the planning process, in coordinating 
all efforts to gather and consolidate the data, in making the pieces and parts 
gel, and in ensuring that the end result actually makes sense and tells the 
right story. So before you can implement an effective planning process, you 
need a basic understanding of what planning does for your business.
Knowing what you’re planning for
Planning is generally about a combination of budgeting and forecasting, 
which we describe as follows:
 
✓ Budgeting involves preparing for the almost-here-and-now by allocating 
and adjusting resources, shifting priorities, and seeking to accomplish 
near-term goals. Your budget may be influenced by what staff you have 
now, what you want to achieve in the next year, how much money you 
have to spend, how your company has performed to date, and a host of 
other factors. Budgets typically deal with using resources to accomplish 
near-term targets.
 
✓ Forecasting, on the other hand, involves a longer-term approach. Think 
of forecasting as a long-term “if-then” mind-set. By looking into and pre-
paring for the future, your company attempts to forecast performance 
and ideal situations, while accounting for possible disruptions and 
obstacles along the way. Rather than ask “How do I spend my money 
in the next year to sell a thousand stereos,” you ask “If I were to sell a 
thousand stereos, what would my company financials look like?” Or, 
“If I want to achieve year-over-year growth of 15 percent, will increasing 
staff by 25 employees get me there?”
 
Consider the differences between budgeting and forecasting as you craft your 
plan. Good business plans address both the near- and long-term aspects of 
operating your business by focusing on the ways your company measures 
performance and rigorously including the factors that contribute to or deter-
mine that performance. And you can make sure that your planning involves 
both budgeting and forecasting by understanding the different processes 
your company undertakes when crafting both budgets and forecasts. Often, 
companies determine their forecasts in separate cycles compared to budgets. 
And thus, different factors play different roles during those periods. Capturing 
those differences can aid in crafting your planning application.

25
 Chapter 3: Determining Your Goals by Planning the Plan
Knowing how your business operates
Different companies organize their performance metrics in completely differ-
ent ways. How a company operates needs to be reflected in the plan. Thus, 
crafting a plan requires fully fleshing out the goals of the planning effort.
Here are some questions to consider when building your plan:
 
✓ Does your company measure performance by geographical region 
(for example, North America versus Europe versus Asia, or maybe 
Northeast versus Southwest)?
 
✓ How often does your company measure its results (for example, 
annually versus quarterly versus monthly versus daily)?
 
✓ What parts of the company are measured (for example, sales, opera-
tions, investments, projects)?
 
✓ What department or lines of businesses should be included in the plan 
(for example, audio equipment versus video equipment versus home 
appliances)?
 
✓ How can certain company goals translate into performance measures 
(for example, increase revenue by 20 percent through sales staff 
augmentation = hire six more salespeople in the Northeast and nine 
more in the Southwest)?
Each one of these questions shows you that certain concepts are used to 
dimensionalize the business, a process by which you break down the 
overall metrics within the business by distinct categories or time frames. 
Dimensions such as region (for example, North America versus Europe), time 
(for example, this year versus next year), and entity (for example, video 
equipment versus audio equipment) may be common to most companies, but 
the exact details of how these dimensions are structured and used are sure 
to be specific to each company.
Laying the foundation of dimensions that accurately reflect the company is 
paramount to building your plan.
Planning the plan from 30,000 feet
Wrapping your plan around the activities and organization of your company 
is the only way to ensure that your planning solution will be useful and used 
by your company. On the other hand, building dimensions or specifying 

26
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
metrics that don’t pertain to the business will just cause angst and confusion 
in the end. And that’s why planning the plan is so important for success; the 
process goes something like this:
 
1. Dimensionalize your business operations.
 
 Figure out all the ways to subdivide, classify, and define your business. 
Just because you can divide the company into dimensions (for example, 
region, time, and entity) doesn’t mean that you’ve fully described how 
things are organized.
 
 You can further break down dimensions into hierarchies. A dimension 
called employee subdivides to different kinds or levels of employees. 
You may have officers, directors, managers, associates, and so on 
as different types of employees.
 
2. Determine your business metrics.
 
 Identify the numerical figures that are meaningful to your company. 
Some things you may want to consider are sales projections, revenue, 
shareholder value, staff head count, utilization rate, booked business, 
number of sales leads, or any other numerical figure that defines your 
business.
 
 For planning purposes, the primary goal is to create a logical means of 
input (for the metrics) through forms that are broken down into the 
requisite parts (the dimensions).
 
3. Establish the relationship of the dimensions and the metrics defined 
in Steps 1 and 2.
Figuring out what dimensions are needed across what measures is how you 
start planning the plan. After you collect and flesh out these elements of your 
business, you can begin the process of compiling it all into a working model.
Getting a Handle on the 
Planning Process
Usually, companies use staff to gather planning and budget information from 
department heads by sending out e-mail, engaging in meetings, and making 
numerous phone calls across the company at periodic intervals throughout 
the year. Using these collections of numbers, analysts piece together and 
crunch numbers in spreadsheets and push out reports for review and revi-
sion, as depicted in Figure 3-1.

Reports
Most of the time, the resulting reports just aren’t right the first time, and 
the process needs multiple iterations before someone at the top is satisfied. 
Often the process takes so long that when it’s over, the information 
in the reports is already months old. Or the process needs to start again 
immediately to prepare for the next period’s reporting. Surely, a better way 
must exist!
Let PerformancePoint simplify 
the planning process
PerformancePoint Server planning streamlines the planning process so that 
the task of gathering data from across the company can take place through a 
single system for all departments and groups. Imagine a data-gathering and 
-reporting process that goes like this:
 
1. Everyone who supplies budget information receives an e-mail 
notifying him that his budget sheet is ready.
 
2. Each individual opens her form in Excel (custom-tailored with just the 
relevant parts) and enters and submits her numbers.
 
3. The managers look over the numbers, make adjustments, and finalize 
the budgets.
 
4. All the data is automatically consolidated, and reports are generated 
showing everyone’s budgets in a variety of easily accessible and 
viewable reports, including custom calculations based on complex 
business rules.

28
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
Throughout the process, security is layered at each step to ensure that 
the right users are accessing the right forms and editing only the data they 
should be entering. Also, PerformancePoint security measures ensure that 
the right levels of management can see the right breadth of data. For exam-
ple, regional managers can see and enter budget numbers for their regions 
and no one else’s regions. Additionally, national managers could be config-
ured to not only see budget numbers entered by the regional managers, but 
they might also have the authority to edit and finalize the numbers. After 
plan numbers are entered into the system, business rules and calculations 
customized for the business can run to generate performance metrics or 
forecast figures.
Setting up the software’s features to gather and consolidate your business 
data still takes some work to get it right. But through PerformancePoint 
Server planning, a single system (carefully crafted) can significantly reduce 
the amount of time and effort needed to solicit budget information across 
an organization.
Breaking down your business 
dimensions and metrics
The effort you make up front to identify accurate business dimensions and 
related metrics determines how well you set up and organize the pieces of 
your business model. Thoroughly fleshing out the elements of your business 
helps to ensure that the resulting PerformancePoint applications offer 
meaningful data. In other words, this effort determines how good your plan 
is going to be.
Many companies may divide their performance metrics by region. Regions 
may consist of multiple layers, eventually breaking down to the state, county, 
or territory level. Being able to create these structures in your dimensions 
is important in that your plan will be richer, more useful, and more accurate 
as an end product. Figure 3-2 shows an example of a well-defined region 
dimension.
 
One of the most important dimensions you will use is time. Budgets are 
about what you will do with your time for the next few periods, so the time 
dimension plays a central role in your PerformancePoint Server plan. The 
folks at Microsoft have already created a series of time member sets that you 
can choose from. Unless your company works on a lunar calendar, the time 
dimensions already come with everything you need.

While every dimension will probably be useful to every budget supplier 
in the company, not all the individuals will be interested in every part of a 
dimension. Thus, the head of sales in the Northwest isn’t really interested in 
what’s going on in Delaware. Member sets manage dimensions by grouping 
chosen dimension elements together. By defining member sets, you can decide 
to show only the lower half of a hierarchy to a user, only one state, the whole 
shebang, or any combination of members. So, you can tailor what each user 
can see and enter data for during the budgeting process.
 
Member sets are particularly useful for creating custom subtotals. For 
example, intricacies of a region dimension may call for calculating revenue 
totals for a Northeast region including all the states in that region. But, users 
from other departments may only want to see a portion of the Northeast 
region rather than the whole thing. By crafting different member sets, users 
can have access to the same underlying data, but organized in completely 
different ways.

30
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
Painting a picture from your data
The process of determining what you will be measuring is quite different 
from the process of creating dimensions. And getting these business 
elements to work together is what gives you information. Think of the task 
in terms of a report. If you were to ask business executives what kind of 
report they might want to see, you would expect to hear something like this: 
“Give me the sales projections budget by all states in the Northeast and by 
quarters for 2008.”
In this request, both region and time are dimensions that are used to subdi-
vide the sales projection budget numbers. So to get the report that the 
executive wants to see, a user might enter sales projection figures for the 
Northeast region (broken down into states) for each of the quarters for 2008.
 
The business dimensions you define are not really numeric. For example, you 
can’t add New York to Pennsylvania and get a meaningful result. You can’t 
multiply these regions or take percentages of them. However, you can perform 
plenty of arithmetic computations on related metrics, such as the sales 
projection figures. You could add New York sales to Pennsylvania sales and 
get the aggregate figure.
Turning your Frankenstein monster 
into a lean, mean machine
After you’ve completed the process of defining the elements (dimensions and 
metrics) of your plan, the next step is to create your business model. Models 
can be complicated and full-featured, but for now, just think of models as a 
place where you link your dimensions (full of hierarchies and member sets) 
to your measures, wrap some business rules around them, secure them, 
determine how to exchange data, stage new incoming data, generate reports, 
distribute tasks to the contributors . . . Yikes! Here’s where PerformancePoint 
Server planning helps you piece things together.
The wide variety of functionality offered by PerformancePoint planning 
means that you need to know quite a bit to build a proper plan. Unlike other 
kinds of software packages, you may not see anything like a finished product 
for a while. Pulling together all the pieces is not unlike putting together a 
Frankenstein monster. Each piece is needed to support the functionality of 
the other pieces and to build a complete package. Luckily, PerformancePoint 
planning provides the framework for putting all the pieces together through 
three nifty interfaces.

31
 Chapter 3: Determining Your Goals by Planning the Plan
Table 3-1 shows the primary function for each interface.

32
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
In the next chapters, we guide you through the Planning Administrative 
Console, the Planning Business Modeler, and then the PerformancePoint 
Add-in for Excel.
 
We’re assuming that you already have a model site available for you in the 
planning server, with administrative access to connect appropriately. If you 
don’t, you’ll need to make sure that the planning server, Business Planning 
Modeler, and PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel are fully installed and that 
you’re a user on all those systems. Later sections in this chapter guide you 
through the process of checking to make sure that these components are 
installed and can communicate with each other.
Preparing to Build Planning Models
Once you have a better understanding of the kinds of ways your business 
engages in the planning process, the next steps involve using 
PerformancePoint to model that business and drive the planning activities 
through all of the functionality provided by the software. The next steps 
involve a bit of preparation to ensure that the building process runs 
smoothly. First, you will gain a better understanding of what you will achieve 
through building models, and second, you will need to check that all of the 
software pieces are in place so that the process of building your model will 
not be fraught with frustration. Verifying that you can connect to all of the 
necessary PerformancePoint components now will stave off headaches 
and frustrations later.
Understanding your business 
through numbers
After you have a clear understanding of the kinds of dimensions your 
business will be using for a plan, the next step is to determine the metrics 
that your business uses to conduct its activities. Metrics or measures 
are distinguished from dimensions and members by the fact that they are 
numbers. They can be dollars, percentages, counts, or any other numbers 
that can be used for computations, such as adding, subtracting, and 
multiplying. Whether you actually run calculations against these numbers 
isn’t so important right now. Instead, try to determine all the kinds of 
numbers that your company uses within the planning process.

33
 Chapter 3: Determining Your Goals by Planning the Plan
Planning numbers can come in a variety of types. Here are some sample 
metrics your company may rely on as part of its planning activities:
 
✓ The number of salespeople in the field and their projected output in 
terms of booked revenue
 
✓ The operating costs associated with various divisions within the 
company (for example, head count and associated salaries)
 
✓ The expected revenue from the various product lines being sold
 
✓ The associated costs to the company from internal versus outsourced 
activities
Each item in the list can be expressed in numerical format, whether in 
dollars, counts, or some other number. Even though dimensions are present 
in each item, the measures provide the “meat” of the breakdowns.
Compose a list of all the metrics that are relevant to your company. Each one 
of these metrics will eventually be the basis for a model in your application.
 
It may be helpful to map out a sample report or two to guide your thought 
process. For instance, you may create a report that looks something like 
Figure 3-3.
 
Figure 3-3: 
An example 
of a 
completed 
budget form.
 
In this example, revenue represents your measure, and salesperson and time 
represent your dimensions. Imagine sending a version of the projected 
sales revenue template to your sales organization to solicit adjustments and 
corrections, or to obtain projections for the following quarters.

34
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
Combining your measures properly with your dimensions enables you to 
build the reports and templates that will make sense to all the individuals 
involved in the planning process. After you understand the building blocks, 
you’ll be ready to start the building process.
 
Before launching into the technical aspects of building an application, map out 
how your planning application needs to work from a business perspective:
 
✓ Compose a list of all the methods your company uses to break down 
planning information. You will use this list when you start to physically 
build your application. This list should include items such as
 
• Companies (if your plan intends to examine different holding 
companies together or separately)
 
• Regions (if your company examines sales or performance on a 
regional or geographic basis)
 
• Currency (if your company works internationally)
 
• Entities (if your company has multiple products)
 
 Very likely, your planning application will have more than just these 
items. Think about whether the items you pick are going to be relevant 
and useful to the individuals using the system.
  
✓ Compose a list of the metrics that are relevant for your company. The 
list may include any numeric figures used within the planning process, 
such as budget dollars, revenue projections, head count, units sold, 
and utilization.
Setting up a planning framework 
for your company
After all the conceptual pieces have been determined, ensure that the 
technical components are in place to begin the process of transforming the 
concepts into a working application.
The following technical steps need to be completed before rolling out a 
finished application:
 
1. Build the application using the Planning Administrative Console.
 
2. Create and deploy the model in the Planning Business Modeler.
 
3. Install the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel on each user’s machine.
 
4. Build the template reports through Excel.
 
5. Create assignments and cycles in the Planning Business Modeler.

35
 Chapter 3: Determining Your Goals by Planning the Plan
 
The process of building an application may require you to jump between the 
three base components of PerformancePoint planning. We cover each step 
separately and break down the steps into distinct elements in the following 
chapters. The creation of the application requires multiple technical elements, 
each with multiple steps. Because the process of building a planning applica-
tion is labor- and thought-intensive, be prepared to set aside more than a 
couple of days to work through the steps. Unfortunately, given the way the 
applications need to be built, you will not see the movement of data between 
your end users and the application until the very end.
 
Before starting the actual building process, make sure that you have the 
proper pieces installed and ready to go. Because all three technical compo-
nents are required to successfully build an application, you also need to 
ensure that the pieces are configured to communicate with each other 
properly and that you have the proper access to these components.
Planning Administrative Console
The Planning Administrative Console provides you with the ability to create 
applications, identify data sources, manage users and access levels, and a 
host of other functions. In order to build models, the precursors to a model 
must be properly set up within the Planning Administrative Console. Most 
notably, you must have a configured application, and you must be a user 
associated with that application.
If the planning server has been installed, your system administrator should 
be able to provide the Web site name for you to access the site.
 
If the planning server has not been installed, ask your system administrator to 
follow the Microsoft installation guide for PerformancePoint Server planning 
and to provide you with the application server URL after he has completed the 
installation process.
To check your ability to access Planning Administrative Console, follow 
these steps:
 
1. In Internet Explorer, type in the Web site address provided to you. 
You should see the screen that’s shown in Figure 3-4.
 
 Notice that the status within the main panel indicates “No connection.”
 
2. Type in the application server address provided to you by your 
system administrator.
  
 The port number (:46787) is added to the end of the server address. 
Port 46787 is the default address for the planning server. However, 
this port can be changed by the system administrator, so check before 
attempting to connect.

36
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
 
3. Click the Connect button.
 
 If the connection works properly and you are a user on the system, the 
status will change to Connected, as shown in Figure 3-5.

 Chapter 3: Determining Your Goals by Planning the Plan
 
 If you can’t connect successfully, check with your system administrator 
to make sure that you have both the correct server address and the cor-
rect port. Also, check with your system administrator to ensure that you 
are a user in the system and that you have been granted the proper 
rights. It is best if you are given global administrator rights because you 
will most likely touch every aspect of the planning system.
 
 If you are not a global administrator, check whether you have enough 
rights to fully build an application. Follow these steps:
 
a. Click the Users button on the left side of the console (see 
Figure 3-6).
 
b. Within the Find A User panel, type any identifying information for 
yourself and click the Find button. If an entry already exists for 
you, a new panel will appear below the query panel. If you are not 
currently a user, you need to have the global administrator or a 
user administrator add you to the list.
Because you will be working with multiple components, you need to have 
access as a user to each component. Being a user within the system does not 
mean that you have the right privileges to engage the functions you need. 
You also need to check that you have privileges as a modeler, and potentially 
as a global administrator, user administrator, and/or data administrator. 
Table 3-2 presents the capabilities of each role.

To check each role, click the role label on the left and repeat the steps to 
check whether you belong to that role. Figures 3-7, 3-8, and 3-9 show users 
already assigned to the Global Administrator, User Administrator, and 
Data Administrator roles, respectively. To build a model, you must be a 
user and belong to the modeler role. While being a modeler is necessary, 
having access as a Global, User, and/or Data Administrator is certainly 
helpful as well.

information and click the Add button (see Figure 3-11).
 
 Your domain name and username should appear in the window below, 
designating you as a modeler in the application.

Planning Business Modeler
To ensure that you have access to the Planning Business Modeler application, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪All Programs➪Microsoft Office PerformancePoint 
Server 2007➪Planning Business Modeler.
 
 If you don’t have this link to launch the Planning Business Modeler, 
request an installation from your system administrator.
 
 After launching the Planning Business Modeler, the primary window will 
be empty.
 
2. Choose File➪Connect to connect the Planning Business Modeler to the 
planning server.
 
 The Connect dialog box appears (see Figure 3-12).
 
3. Enter the name of your planning server as provided by your system 
administrator.
 
 Your entry here may be different than the entry you provided to connect 
to your application server within the Planning Administration Console. If 
you can connect, the bottom two drop-down boxes will become enabled 
(see Figure 3-13).

42
Part I: Planning and Reporting 
 
 If you do not yet have a planning application created with model sites, 
these two drop-down boxes will be empty. For now, simply having a con-
nection is sufficient to know that the pieces are installed correctly and 
have the capability of communicating between the planning server and 
the Planning Business Modeler.

PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel
To create forms and template reports, you must have the PerformancePoint 
Add-in for Excel installed on your machine.
 
Excel is the only interface provided to end users to enter or adjust planning 
numbers, so every user of the system needs to have the Add-in installed 
locally on his or her computer. Before you deploy your planning application, 
make sure that your target audience has the Add-in installed. You don’t need 
to install the Add-in on every machine right now, but the installation is 
required at some point. Depending on how computer-savvy your users are, 
they may need some assistance in the process.
To see whether you have the Add-in properly installed on your machine, 
open Excel. If you see the PerformancePoint tab along the top (as shown in 
Figure 3-14), you have the Add-in installed. If you do not see this tab, ask your 
system administrator to install the proper version on your machine.

43
 Chapter 3: Determining Your Goals by Planning the Plan
 
Figure 3-14:

Two versions of the Add-in exist, one for a 32-bit platform (x86) and one for a 
64-bit platform (x64). Install the correct version for your desktop configura-
tion. While the Add-in works for both Excel 2003 and Excel 2007, the interface 
and navigation are easier and nicer in 2007.
If you already have a model site built and deployed on the planning server, 
you can test the connection between Excel and the planning server. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. Click the PerformancePoint tab.
 
2. Click the Connect button.
 
3. Enter the Web address to your planning application server provided 
by your system administrator in the dialog box (see Figure 3-15).
 
 This address is the same one you use to connect to the Planning 
Business Modeler, but it may be different from the address you use to 
connect to the Planning Administrative Console.
 
 If desired, you can test the connection to ensure that the tools can com-
municate with each other before engaging the add-in by clicking the Test 
Connection button.
 
 If this connection is one that you plan to use often, click the Add To 
Favorites button to store the address within Excel. This makes typing 
the full path unnecessary in the future. You can simply choose an exist-
ing path in the grid to connect.

 Excel connects with the planning server and shows its progress (see 
Figure 3-16).
 
 If the connection is successful, Excel opens a new navigation console 
on the left side of the screen (see Figure 3-17). This panel allows you to 
create new templates and enter planning numbers. This topic is covered 
in later chapters. For now, just be assured that your connections are 
working and that you have all the pieces in place, technically speaking, 
to begin work designing your application.

Using the framework to drive 
company productivity
While your goal may be to craft a cool planning 
application, the real objective is to provide your 
users and your company with a tool to conduct 
a specific part of their business in a better way 
than they do it now.
For the majority of companies that already pro-
duce budgets, forecasts, and plans, improving 
the process means finding a means to perform 
these tasks faster, easier, more accurately, with 
better reporting, with better process manage-
ment, and with less pain.
Before starting to build your Planning applica-
tion, ask yourself whether the end result will 
achieve most of these goals as they apply to 
your company. If you believe your Planning 
application is being built for all the right rea-
sons, read on. Otherwise, you may question 
whether the cost and time associated with 
PerformancePoint planning are appropriate for 
your company.
The end goal of PerformancePoint planning is 
to provide the individuals in the company who 
are in charge of entering budget, plan, and fore-
cast figures with an easy-to-use means of entry, 
and then to store and synchronize those figures 
in a centralized data-management system. 
Along the way, various tools such as user secu-
rity, version management, process manage-
ment, and others enhance the capabilities of 
the system.
Chapters 4, 5, 6, and 7 provide the step-by-step 
processes for building a Planning application 
and enabling that application to serve the needs 
of your company.

A
fter the technical pieces are in place, the real work of building your 
business model starts. While this may seem strange, the process of 
building a business model attacks an application both from the top down and 
from the bottom up. Top down means that you’ll need to create the container 
that holds all the pieces of the model. Then, you’ll build the individual pieces 
of your model one by one. Finally, you’ll connect the pieces to make them 
work as a unit and to control how the pieces interact with each other.
 
Building a planning application is a little like building a living, breathing crea-
ture. Your application will have lots of parts that interact with each other, and 
as a whole, will interact with others around it. Additionally, over time, your 
application will also grow and mature as you add and enhance its intelligence 
and capabilities.
Creating a Place to Store Your Data: 
Accessing a Model Site
The first step in building a business model is opening the Planning Business 
Modeler. To access the Modeler, follow these steps:

50
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
1. In Windows, choose Start➪Programs➪Microsoft Office 
PerformancePoint Server 2007➪Planning Business Modeler.
 
 You must have the Planning Business Modeler installed on your local 
machine.
 
 The Modeler interface opens to reveal a relatively blank page.
 
2. Choose File➪Connect.
 
 A Connect dialog box opens (see Figure 4-1).
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Connect 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Enter the path to the PerformancePoint planning server.
 
 The path will look something like this: http://ppsplanning.
company.com:46787.
 
 The port number :46787 has been added to the end of the entry. If you 
are not sure that this is the correct port, check with your system admin-
istrator. Port 46787 is the default port, but your administrator may have 
changed the port to accommodate company standards.
 
4. Click the Connect button.
 
 If your connection is successful, the Select An Application and Select A 
Model Site drop-down boxes will become available and will be populated 
with applications and models for which you have been given access (see 
Figure 4-2).
 
 If the applications and models boxes turn white but remain empty, you 
either don’t have an existing application or model site to use, or you 
have not been given access to an existing application or model site. Call 
your IT department, help desk, or the person who set up your installa-
tion. Check to see that an application has been created for you and that 
you have been given permissions as a modeler for that application.
 
5. If you have multiple choices in the Select An Application drop-down 
box, select the one that you want to work on.

51
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
 
Figure 4-2: 
A

6. Select the model site that you want to work on.
 
7. Deselect the Connect Automatically By Using These Settings check box.
 
 In the future, you may want to create additional model sites or access 
other applications. Leaving this check box deselected gives you the 
option to do so.
 
8. Click the OK button.
 
 The Modeler will connect to the planning server to bring back the attri-
butes of the application and model sites to the interface (see Figure 4-3).
 
Figure 4-3: 
The primary 
Modeler 
interface.
 

52
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
Introducing the Modeler Interface
The Modeler interface provides a single source to perform most of the duties 
associated with building a model.
 
At some point, you may need to go back to the Planning Administrative 
Console to engage other activities.
The Modeler interface is similar to other Microsoft development tools: The 
interface contains multiple panels that provide interactions among the 
panels.
The Modeler interface consists of the following items:
 
✓ Workspace Browser: On the left side of the screen, the Workspace 
Browser allows you to navigate among the various components of a 
model. Clicking any of the elements in the Browser changes the primary 
panel and the available items in the Workspace Actions panel. When you 
first make a connection to a model site, the default selection is the Site 
Summary, which provides you with a general rundown of all the com-
ponents contained within your model. As you add parts to your model, 
elements may appear in the Workspace Browser to indicate changes or 
additions. But the main elements in bold never change.
 
✓ Primary panel: Generally the largest portion of the screen, the primary 
panel provides a space for you to conduct most of the configuration 
activity to build your model. Depending on which Workspace Browser 
selection you have made, the primary panel will change accordingly.
 
✓ Workspace Actions panel: The various operations that can be per-
formed within the Modeler are dynamically presented in the Workspace 
Actions panel. For the most part, this panel provides the ability to initi-
ate actions such as adding or creating items, deleting items, modifying 
items, or linking items. Depending on the active Workspace Browser and 
primary panel selections, the available Workspace Actions features will 
change to reflect possible activities.
 
Because the Modeler interface connects to the planning server to store 
changes, update the databases, and allow the deployment of your model, a 
near-constant connection to the planning server is required. During the course 
of working with the Modeler, you may experience a “timing out” of your con-
nection. Simply reconnect to the planning server by choosing File➪Connect 
and following the typical procedure for opening the Modeler. If your connec-
tion terminates too frequently, ask your IT administrator about increasing the 
connection time-out property.

53
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
Building Dimensions
Dimensions constitute the primary building blocks for models. Dimensions 
allow you to organize, break down, and give meaning to the data in your 
plan. Dimensions in PerformancePoint can be classified as either predefined 
or user-defined. Planning server requires that certain dimensions exist for all 
models.
 
Chapter 3 shows you how to identify the necessary dimensions for your busi-
ness model.
The fact that we refer to these dimensions as predefined does not mean that 
they are static in structure. In fact, the predefined dimensions generally 
offer a host of customization options to fit your needs. Predefined simply 
means that they are always available for your use, and in some cases, 
PerformancePoint requires you to use them. Actually, these predefined 
dimensions come in handy because Microsoft has thoughtfully packed them 
full of functionality. Using the predefined dimensions correctly, a modeler 
can have a much easier time designing a variety of complex planning, budget-
ing, forecasting, and financial reporting applications. Without the predefined 
dimensions, the process would be truly grueling for the average user.
User-defined dimensions constitute dimensions that the Modeler creates 
along the way. These dimensions are useful when the Modeler determines 
that the model requires a dimension that doesn’t fit within any of the pre-
defined dimensions. User-defined dimensions are critical for complex models, 
but they do not have the advantages of the built-in intelligence contained 
within the predefined dimensions. You can create as many user-defined 
dimensions as you want.
 
While there is no limit to the number of user-defined dimensions that can be 
included in your model, be careful about creating too many, especially if some 
dimensions may not be useful. Your strategy should be to grow your plan 
rather organically, starting with just the fundamentals and then adding pieces 
that are really needed to make the plan suit your needs. Adding unnecessary 
elements can complicate the management and administration of your model.
Understanding predefined dimensions
The predefined dimensions supplied by PerformancePoint are functions 
common to most implementations. The functionality built into the predefined 
dimensions is much greater than what you can design yourself (without an 
incredible amount of effort) as a user-defined dimension.
Table 4-1 identifies the PerformancePoint predefined dimensions.

Table 4-1 
PerformancePoint Predefined Dimensions
Predefined 
Dimension
Description
Account
Provides aggregation logic for a chart of accounts, enabling par-
ticular types of financial reporting needs such as balance sheets 
and income statements.
Business 
Process
A hierarchy that stores each step of a financial calculation so 
that tracking and auditing of complex financial computations 
become easier. The Business Process dimension is especially 
useful for domains such as share allocations and currency 
conversions, where understanding the progression of numbers 
across the course of the calculation is helpful.
Consolidation 
Method
For companies with multiple holdings, the process of managing 
share reporting can be complex. The Consolidation Method dimen-
sion offers users the means to define share allocation methods 
including equity, full, holding, and proportional consolidations.
Currency
A listing of currencies that are relevant to the company’s busi-
ness. The Currency dimension enables different members of the 
Entity dimension to relate monetarily to other members.
Entity
A representation of the various ways that an organization can be 
broken down into operational units. Breakdowns may represent 
things like product lines or departments.
Exchange 
Rate
Stores a list of conversion rates between currencies. Used in 
conjunction with the Currency dimension, the Exchange Rate 
dimension assists in various point-in-time assessments of dollar 
value for international transactions.
Flow
Provides tracking of cash flows and monetary amounts between 
time periods.
Intercompany
Interacts with the Entity dimension to establish relationships 
between entities for management or legal reasons. This dimen-
sion is maintained internally by PerformancePoint.
Scenario
Comprises the storage of values associated with budget, actual, 
and forecast values. From an Analysis Services perspective, the 
Scenario dimension is akin to the concept of measures in a cube. 
Here, the numerical components of the Scenario dimension exist 
against the Time dimension as snapshot figures.

 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan

Description
Time
Comprises one of the most important dimensions for any model. 
The Time dimension provides a hierarchy that naturally captures 
the relationships inherent in a calendar, such as years, quarters, 
months, weeks, and days. The Time dimension is required for all 
models and is one of the first dimensions created through the 
Application Calendar Wizard.
User
Provides a means to easily manage the reporting lines and 
assignment and distribution as part of process management.
 
All models require the predefined time and scenario dimensions.
Try to map each item on your list to the items in Table 4-1. Hopefully, you’ll 
notice some commonalities. Don’t be concerned if a few of your items can’t 
be seen in this list. That’s what user-defined dimensions are for.
Getting familiar with the Dimensions panel
Upon first clicking the Dimensions link in the Workspace Browser, the pri-
mary panel presents the list of dimensions associated with your model (see 
Figure 4-4). Notice that the list of dimensions contains a table with the prop-
erties of each dimension including name, label, description, parent model 
site, sharing status, and check-out status. From here, not only do you get a 
catalog of all the dimensions, but you also find out whether any of the dimen-
sions are currently being worked on by you or others.
In the Workspace Actions panel, you have the options to create a dimension, 
create the calendar, or synchronize your dimensions to the staging area. 
Additionally, you also see properties specific to the dimension that is cur-
rently highlighted in the primary panel. Clicking the row associated with a 
dimension in the primary panel dynamically shows the properties for that 
dimension in the Dimension Details table in the Workspace Actions panel.
If you click the name (highlighted in blue) on the primary panel, the primary 
panel changes to provide the structure of that dimension. Figure 4-5 shows 
the Summary tab.
You find three tabs in the primary panel. The first is the Summary tab, which 
provides an overview of the contents for the dimension. The Summary tab 
delineates the identification information for the dimension, along with the 
number of member sets and member views. We get to this in a moment. The 
other two tabs, Member Maintenance and Member Set Maintenance, enable 
you to edit dimension data or member set data (which we will cover later in the 
chapter in the section “Making your dimensions pop through member sets”).

In the Workspace Actions panel, a host of new actions are available for 
your use. The Modeler is designed as a development tool, and as such, it 
allows multiple users to manipulate the same model site simultaneously. 
Consequently, the Modeler requires that as you work on pieces of your 

57
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
model, you check out the specific pieces that you want to manipulate, work 
on them, and then check them back in. Other users are prevented from work-
ing on pieces that are checked out to prevent simultaneous multiple changes 
from different users. Thus, by checking out a dimension, you prevent other 
users from working on that dimension at the same time. When you are done, 
you need to check the dimension back in to save the changes and to allow 
others to access the dimension for further manipulation.
Along with checking a dimension in and out, you can also add data to your 
dimensions, create additional structure or organization to the data, and con-
duct some maintenance duties such as deleting a dimension or synchronizing 
data to the staging area. For now, we concentrate on accessing and configur-
ing the most important dimensions, creating some new dimensions, and figur-
ing out how to add data to those dimensions.
Configuring the Application Calendar
The Application Calendar is perhaps the most important dimension you will 
build, because every company is concerned about the process of account-
ing for what is happening now and what will happen in the future. The time 
dimension provides the framework for tracking information backward and 
forward in time, and as such, it must be configured correctly for your com-
pany’s activities.
The time dimension must be the first dimension you configure when creating 
a model. In fact, the time dimension is so important that PerformancePoint 
has provided a wizard to lead you through the process so that it is config-
ured correctly.
 
Configuring the time dimension does not take long. However, the impacts 
of walking through the Application Calendar Wizard can shape the rest of 
your model. After the Application Calendar has been set, the configuration 
cannot be reversed. All the subsequent data that is sent to the planning server 
depends on attributes of the time dimension, and thus changes to the time 
dimension may adversely impact your deployment. In fact, if you need to 
change the configuration of the time dimension, it may be easier to rebuild 
your model from scratch. This caveat does not apply to simply extending 
your calendar, but it does apply if you decide to change the method chosen 
to track time.
The Application Calendar within the time dimension is a prebuilt mechanism 
for segmenting time into its component parts. Through the Application 
Calendar Wizard, you will define the specific kind of calendar for your 
model, the length of time your calendar covers, and how the date is 
presented on-screen.

58
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
To create your Application Calendar, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Create the Calendar link in the Workspace Actions panel.
 
 This opens the Name The Application Calendar dialog box (see Figure 4-6).
 
Figure 4-6: 
Starting the 
Application 
Calendar 
Wizard.
 
 
 Use the default name Calendar or choose your own name for your calendar.
 
2. Click the Next button.
 
 The Define The Calendar Pattern dialog box opens (see Figure 4-7).
 
3. Choose when your company’s financial year ends.
 
 For some companies, this may be the typical year end (12/31/2008), but 
for other companies, the date may be mid-year (such as 4/31/2008). The 
determination of the year end depends on how your company conducts 
its accounting.
 
4. Determine how your year ends by selecting the appropriate option 
button.
 
 Some companies strictly follow monthly periods so that the year ends 
on the same day every year. In that case, select the Years Always End 
On The Selected Month And Day option and choose Correspond To The 
Calendar Months.

59
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
 
Figure 4-7: 
Defining the 
calendar 
pattern.
 
 
 Other companies disregard whether the year actually ends on a par-
ticular date and use a calendar based on full weeks. In this case, you 
must choose the Follow The Pattern option. Based on your company’s 
accounting method (you may need to speak with someone in Finance to 
be sure), choose the proper weekly pattern. The options provided by 
the wizard are 445, 454, 544, 13 Equal Periods, Gregorian Calendar, or 
Gregorian Calendar Variation.
 
5. Specify the calendar duration.
 
 Besides the current year, enter the number of prior and future years for 
your model. Don’t worry about having to change it later. The process of 
extending your calendar duration is easy.
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 The Select Optional Frequencies dialog box opens (see Figure 4-8). If you 
want to track data outside of the default selections of Year, Month, and 
Day, choose the other frequencies that pertain to your company. The 
most common addition is Quarter, although your company may have a 
different emphasis.
 
7. Click the Next button.
 
 The Define Period Naming Conventions dialog box opens (see Figure 4-9). 
Here you can change the way dates are presented to your users. This is 
simply a formatting function. You can prefix your dates in a particular 

60
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
manner and preview what the dates will look like. For example, instead 
of showing the year 2008, you can make it read Yr2008, or 2008Y if you 
choose. (You cannot change the formatting for Month or Day.)

8. Click the Next button.
 
 The Create Calendar Views dialog box opens (see Figure 4-10). Different 
models you create may require different granularities of dates. For 
example, one set of users may require annual reports, while another 
may need to have years broken down into quarters, months, and weeks. 
Each calendar view you create provides a separate breakdown of your 
time dimension that you can choose to use later in your model.
 
Figure 4-10:

dar views.
 
 
 Click the Create A View link. Type in a label for the view, and if you 
desire, you can enter a free-text description in the Description field. 
Select the frequencies you’d like to associate with your new view. 
Repeat the process for each view you need to create.
 
 If you want to edit existing views, you can do so here. Simply select the 
view in the Calendar Views window and edit the properties on the right 
side as you see fit.
 
9. Click the Next button and then the Finish button.
 
 The wizard closes.
 
10. Click the Check In link in the Workspace Actions panel.
 
 Modeler saves your work to the database.
Congratulations! Your first dimension is done (and it was the most important 
one). It wasn’t so hard, was it?

62
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
Configuring Other Predefined Dimensions
Besides the time dimension, other predefined dimensions supplied by 
PerformancePoint provide an easy way to configure and populate data for 
your model. For the most part, the predefined dimensions are already popu-
lated with values that PerformancePoint can use for internal operations, such 
as creating Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) reporting, 
currency conversions, and other typical budgeting functions. Such prepopu-
lated dimensions include business process, flow, consolidation method, 
and user. For the most part, these prepopulated, predefined dimensions do 
not need any alterations. In fact, it may be best to not change them because 
PerformancePoint will use the field names and structures behind the scenes 
to assist you in conducting typical planning activities.
Other predefined dimensions are convenient places to store custom data. The 
process involves manually inputting data or loading members through the 
wizard. For these empty dimensions, you have a significant amount of leeway 
in terms of how you want to use the dimensions. For example, the entity dimen-
sion can contain anything from product lines to departments to companies. 
What you choose to populate the dimension with depends greatly on your 
company needs and organizational structure. But the placeholder is there for 
you to use if you need it.
The process of populating empty predefined dimensions is just like that for 
user-defined dimensions. The only real difference is that predefined dimen-
sions are already named for you.
Creating User-Defined Dimensions
For dimensions that do not fit any of the predefined dimension templates, the 
only other option is user-defined dimensions. While the user-defined dimen-
sion may not inherently own any of the functionality of the predefined vari-
ety, that does not limit you from extending and adding functionality that can 
prove useful within your model. You have multiple ways to create a dimen-
sion, and we walk through each one separately.
Generating a dimension from scratch
To create a user-defined dimension from scratch, follow these steps:

63
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
 
1. In the Workspace Browser, choose Dimensions.
 
 The Workspace Actions panel changes to present you with a few 
options.
 
2. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Create a Dimension link.
 
 The Name The Dimension Dialog box opens (see Figure 4-11).
 
Figure 4-11: 
The Name 
The 
Dimension 
dialog box.
 
 
3. Enter a name, label, and description (optional) in the dialog box.
 
 When you enter the dimension name, the label is automatically popu-
lated with the same text. For most cases, this is just fine.
 
 In general, it is easier to use the same text for the names and labels for 
a dimension. Of course, this isn’t necessary; it’s just a convenience. The 
name represents what the user sees on-screen. A name is limited to 256 
characters. On the other hand, a label represents PerformancePoint’s 
internal reference for the dimension and must be unique within your 
model. You cannot have multiple dimensions with the same label. The 
label is limited to 40 characters.
 
 Select the Allow This Dimension to Be Shared check box. Doing so 
ensures that the dimension you create will be available to all the lower-
level model subsites you’ll build later.
 
4. Click the Next button.
 
 The Select Dimension Structure Source dialog box opens (see Figure 
4-12). In this case, because we’re building a dimension from scratch, 
select the Create New Dimension Structure option.

64

Figure 4-12: 
The Select

Source dia-

5. Click the Next button.
 
 The Define Member Creation dialog box opens (see Figure 4-13). Here 
you can create your members now if you choose. Because you may not 
have all the data at hand right now, you can also leave this task until 
later. For now, choose the Define Members Later option.
 
Figure 4-13: 
The Define 
Member 
Creation 
dialog box.
 
 
 Choosing the Create Sample Members option isn’t really useful. All it 
does is add ten dummy records to your dimension that you’ll have to 
adjust later. It’s best to choose the Define Members Later option.
  
 When you are done building your dimension, you’ll have the opportunity 
to add the members then.

65
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 The Review And Create dialog box opens to present you with a summary 
of your work (see Figure 4-14).
 
Figure 4-14:

summary.
 
 
7. Click the Finish button.
 
 The wizard closes, and the primary panel adjusts to present your new 
empty dimension (except for the No Member member — see Figure 
4-15). You can load this dimension with data from your data sources or 
from a CSV file, but because we’re building this dimension from scratch, 
we’ll do it manually (just once).
 
8. Right-click the space below the No Member member in the primary 
panel.
 
 Select Add New Sibling. A new row is added to your dimension 
member list.
 
9. Edit the new row by clicking the Name entry and typing in the name 
of your new member.
 
 Do the same for the label and description (see Figure 4-16).
 
10. Repeat Steps 8 and 9 to enter each member to your dimension.
 
11. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check In link.
 
 Your work is saved to the planning server, and the dimension is avail-
able to other users for editing and configuring.

Adding a member property
By default, creating a dimension yields a long list of values with associated 
labels and descriptions. But sometimes having a flat dimension with just one 

67
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
long set of records isn’t quite right. You may want to include more than just 
the name to your dimension. In this case, adding a member property gives 
you what you want.
To add a member property, follow these steps:
 
1. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Create a Member Property link.
 
 The associated dialog box opens (see Figure 4-17).
 
Figure 4-17: 
The Create 
Member

2. Enter the label for your new column, and specify the type of data it is.
 
 You can choose from a number of different data types. For our example, 
we use Text. (For the Text option, you need to specify the maximum 
number of characters you want for the column.) You can leave the Value 
box blank.
 
3. Click the OK button.
 
 The Modeler returns you to your dimension. Notice that a new column 
has been added to the end of your dimension members. You can now 
edit those entries, keeping within the constraints of the data type you 
specified in Step 2.
 
4. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check In link.
 
You can always make changes to your user-defined dimensions by checking 
out the dimension and manually editing the members. You can also add or 
change member properties by clicking the Create A Member Property or the 
Update Member Property link. However, after you add a member property to 
a dimension, you cannot remove it without a ton of effort. Usually, you can 
simply ignore the extra data in the dimension without a problem (as you’ll find 
out when creating member sets).

68
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
Using a CSV file to build a dimension
Building a dimension from a CSV file is easier than building one from scratch. 
The primary difference is that no manual data entry is required. A CSV file is 
simply a comma-separated values file that can be generated from common 
applications like Microsoft Excel. Certainly, many other applications can also 
be used to generate a CSV file.
If you open a CSV file using Notepad, you can see rows of data with individual 
data fields separated by commas. The Modeler can use these commas to cast 
the individual data elements into the right fields of a dimension.
One limitation of using a CSV file to build a dimension is that the Modeler is 
picky about the format of the CSV file. To ensure that the file can be read cor-
rectly, your CSV file must have the following requirements:
 
✓ The first row of the file must contain column headers.
 
✓ The column headers must begin in exactly this order:
 
• Label
 
• Name
 
• Description
 
• Other Optional Properties
 
 Yes, Label and Name are reversed from what you see in the resulting 
dimension layout in the primary panel.
 
✓ Each field must be separated by commas.
An example of an acceptable CSV file can be seen in Figure 4-18.
 
If you use a CSV file to build a dimension, be wary of generating the file when 
your data fields inherently have commas in them. For instance, address data 
often has commas (for example, 16 Main St., NW has a comma embedded in 
the street address). CSV files balk at the extra comma, and the resulting file 
will have an extra stealth comma embedded in that row. Methods are avail-
able to get around issues with CSV files (using text delimiters), but the key is 
recognizing that your data could have issues before you start pulling your hair 
out trying to figure out what went wrong.
To create a user-defined dimension using a CSV file, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow Steps 1–3 in the section “Generating a dimension from 
scratch,” earlier in this chapter.

 Your work is saved to the planning server, and the dimension is avail-
able to other users for editing and configuring.
Leveraging a data source to 
build a dimension
Building a dimension from a data source is easier than building one from 
scratch or building one from a CSV file. You aren’t subjected to manual data 
entry, and you don’t need to ensure that your file is formatted in the strict 
CSV format. However, pulling data from a data source requires your applica-
tion to have a connection to the data source configured.

72
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
A data source for your application must come from a source that 
PerformancePoint can read. Data source generally equates to a database, and 
in Microsoft’s case, that means an SQL Server database. If you are using SQL 
Server, you are not limited to tables. You can also use views as a data source.
If you choose to use a data source to build a dimension, make sure that 
the data source has already been identified in the Planning Administrative 
Console. Looking at the screens in the Modeler will provide you with no clue 
about whether you have access to a data source until you actually attempt it. 
If you are not sure whether you have a connection, check with your system 
administrator to find out whether a data source has been configured for your 
specific model site.
 
If you or your system administrator has trouble connecting to a data source, 
make sure that you have the proper security settings for the data source. The 
PPSService user should have db_datareader access to your database.
To create a user-defined dimension using a data source, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow Steps 1–3 in the section “Generating a dimension from 
scratch,” earlier in this chapter.
 
2. Click the Next button.
 
 The Select Dimension Structure Source dialog box opens (see Figure

73
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
 
3. From the drop-down box, select the data source you would like to use.
 
 If the drop-down box is blank, you do not have data sources associated 
to your model. Contact your system administrator to add a new data 
source through the Planning Administrative Console.
  
4. Click the Next button.
 
 The Specify Values For Required Properties dialog box opens (see Figure 
4-24). From the drop-down box, select the table or view you would like 
to use as a source. Then, for each empty Value box, click the down 
arrow and select the field that corresponds to the Name and Label 
items. If you would like to have the name and label come from the same 
field, that is fine. The Description value is optional.
 
Figure 4-24:

 If you get an error message when you try to click the down arrow in the 
Value column, you may be attempting to use a data source that contains 
multiple schemas. The current version of PerformancePoint is unable 
to recognize fully qualified field names that include the schema name. 
PerformancePoint can only use those tables or views that belong to the 
default schema.
 
5. Click the Next button.
 
 The Select Additional Properties dialog box opens (see Figure 4-25). 
While the Name, Label, and Description fields might be sufficient for 
some dimensions, you may want to have additional information within 
the dimension. In this case, you can add columns to the table by select-
ing the check boxes next to the items that you would like to include in 
your dimension.

10. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check In link.
 
 Your work is saved to the planning server, and the dimension is avail-
able to other users for editing and configuring.
Sometimes, you may face data that is not ready for import into your dimen-
sion. Specifically, dimensions require that each row of data is completely 
unique. In the case of the AdventureWorks database, we’d like to import 
information from the product table. Unfortunately, while this data can prove 
to be useful throughout the rest of the book, getting it into a workable dimen-
sion takes an additional step. We’ll create a better copy of the table that 
ensures the rows are unique, and at the same time, use more meaningful 
labels to make sense of the data. 
If you need help executing the following steps, feel free to call your database 
administrator for help.
 
1. Within SQL Server Management Studio, open the AdventureWorksDW 
database.
 
2. Create a new view using the following text:
SELECT a.ProductAlternateKey, a.EnglishProductName AS Product, 
a.StandardCost,
   a.Color, a.ListPrice, a.Size, a.ModelName,
   b.EnglishProductSubcategoryName AS ProductSubCategory,
   c.EnglishProductCategoryName AS ProductCategory
FROM dbo.DimProduct AS a INNER JOIN
   dbo.DimProductSubcategory AS b ON a.ProductSubcategoryKey =
   b.ProductSubcategoryKey INNER JOIN
   dbo.DimProductCategory AS c ON b.ProductCategoryKey =
   c.ProductCategoryKey
WHERE (a.EndDate IS NULL)
Executing this code creates a single view containing product data, along with 
associated product category and product subcategory information. You can 
use this view as a data source to build a product dimension, along with a 
product hierarchy member set (with the category and subcategories serving 
as the group by order).
 
Because you’ve added a view to your data source, you need to update the 
available tables/views in your data source in the Planning Administrative 
Console. Make sure to add your new view before attempting to build the 
dimension from the data source.

 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
Making Your Dimensions Pop 
through Member Sets
While crafting dimensions is a central aspect of your model, keeping your 
dimensions in a rather flat form limits the possibilities of usefulness for your 
model. Dimensions become much more representative of an organization 
when hierarchies can be incorporated. Those hierarchies are called member 
sets. Member sets are a means of building hierarchies within dimensions. 
These nested representations of your data provide a means of aggregating 
metrics to gain insight into whole departments, regions, product lines, or 
other dimensions.
At the unmodified level, dimensions consist of leaf-level members. These 
members are considered leaf-level using the analogy of a tree. The leaf-level 
members represent the most granular level of data. In a geography dimen-
sion, the leaf-level member might be U.S. zip codes. Higher-level members 
would be counties and then states. Member sets, budgets, and plans could be 
conducted at the zip code level, but users of the reports would be able to see 
how the zip codes aggregate to counties and then from counties to states.
As an example, here’s a member set on the Region dimension built earlier 
within the model:
 
1. From the Workspace Browser, select Dimensions.
 
2. From the primary panel, click the Region dimension.
 
3. From the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check Out link.
 
 A pencil should appear next to Region in the Workspace Browser to indi-
cate that you are working on the dimension.
 
4. From the Workspace Actions panel, click the Create A Member Set link.
 
 The Create A Member Set dialog box opens (see Figure 4-29). Enter the 
name and label you would like to use for your member set (pressing Tab 
after entering the name automatically populates the same label entry, 
which is fine.)
 
5. Click the Next button.
 
 The Select Member Set Creation Option dialog box opens (see Figure 
4-30). For this example, choose the Create An Empty Member Set option.

7. Click the Finish button.
 
 Notice that the Modeler creates a new empty member set with a label 
within the primary panel. If you click the Member Set drop-down box, 
you can see a list of the available member sets. Besides the default All 
Members set, you now have the Region Hierarchy member set (see 
Figure 4-31).

8. Click the Member Set Maintenance tab in the primary panel.
 
 The destination member set is placed next to the source member set 
on-screen.
 
9. Right-click the empty space within the Destination Member Set panel 
and select Add Sibling.
 
 This creates a new default member.
 
10. Click the name of the new default member and type in USA.
 
 Repeat again for the label.
 
11. Within the source member set, right-click South and select the Add As 
Child option.
 
 This moves the South entry to the destination member set nested 
beneath the USA member. Repeat this process for all the USA source 
members. One by one, the members move from source to destination. 
The Destination Member Set panel should grow to look like Figure 4-32.
 
 As an alternative, you can also drag and drop members from the source 
to the destination.
 
12. Repeat the process for the International entries.
 
 Again, right-click the Destination Member Set panel and add a new sib-
ling. If the new default member appears at the same level as one of the 
leaf-level members, you can right-click the default member and select 
Outdent to move it to the same level as USA. Then, with International 
selected in the Destination Member Set panel, add the two remaining 
members nested beneath it, as in Step 11.

 It’s not always necessary to move all the members into a member set. In 
some cases, you may want to move only a portion of the members into 
a set. For instance, in the current example, you may want to create an 
additional member set that only includes the USA items. The configura-
tion and number of member sets are up to you and the needs of your 
model.
 
13. Move the No Member entry to the destination member set by right-
clicking No Member and selecting Copy.
 
 Then right-click the Destination Member Set panel and select Paste.
 
14. Select the Member Maintenance tab in the primary panel.
 
 In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check In link.
You’ve now created your first member set. You can leverage member sets to 
aggregate figures within a dimension to arrive at totals and subtotals. When 
it comes to presenting results, doing so in a hierarchical fashion can be 
extremely compelling.
Configuring the Scenario Dimension
The scenario dimension is another key dimension within PerformancePoint. 
While other dimensions are used in the classical sense of breaking down or 

81
 Chapter 4: Setting Your Goals by Creating the Plan
cutting data into segments, the scenario dimension just catalogs the various 
numbers and metrics of interest within your model.
 
In some ways, the scenario dimension isn’t really a dimension. But by classify-
ing different kinds of numbers (such as budget, actual, forecast, and/or head 
count), PerformancePoint can provide an additional degree of flexibility in 
building reports and models.
The scenario dimension must use numerical amounts and cannot accept 
text-based data. The opposite is true of all other dimensions. Typically, 
dimensions generally accept only text-based data. Even if a dimension uses 
numbers for labels, the numbers within the labels cannot be added, sub-
tracted, multiplied, or used in calculations. On the other hand, the numbers 
of the members of the scenario dimension are perfect for aggregating, averag-
ing, and comparing.
Thus, every model must have a defined scenario dimension. Follow these 
steps to define one:
 
1. Select Dimensions from the Workspace Browser.
 
2. Select Scenario in the primary panel.
 
3. Click the Check Out link.
 
4. Right-click the space beneath the No Member member in the primary 
panel.
 
 Select Add New Sibling. A new row is added to your dimension member 
list.
 
5. Edit the new row by clicking the name entry and typing in the name 
of your new member.
 
 Do the same for the label and description (see Figure 4-33). Common 
entries for names and labels might be Actual, Budget, Forecast, Plan, 
and Head Count.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 to add each member to your dimension.
 
7. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check In link.
 
 Your work is saved to the planning server, and the dimension is avail-
able to other users for editing and configuring.
 
Chapter 5 shows you how to use the dimensions to create models.

Bringing the Pieces Together: 
Building a Model
In This Chapter
▶ Building a model from dimensions
▶ Updating and scheduling your current periods
▶ Associating additional models
▶ Spawning new model subsites
U
pon completion of the dimensional building blocks, the next step is to 
start building the model itself. While building dimensions can be pains-
taking and lengthy, your hard work will now pay off as you watch the pieces 
come together into a consolidated whole.
Technically speaking, a model is simply a container for your dimensions 
with some logic to connect dimensions together into a working whole. Then 
again, models also contain a significant amount of functionality to drive and 
facilitate the creation of reports that will be useful to end users. Models can 
be endlessly configurable, but the point isn’t to make highly complex models. 
The main objective is to craft a model that is most useful for your users. With 
this in mind, you should seek to determine the level of complexity for your 
models that will be appropriate for your company.
Each model you create can also spawn additional model subsites. A model sub-
site leverages shared dimensions created in the root model site to enable the 
creation of different model versions. These smaller versions can accommo-
date a subset of the dimensions, or subsets within dimensions to be tailored 
for specific user groups. For example, a model subsite can be created just for 
the Finance department if necessary. Alternatively, a model subsite may ser-
vice a specific product line, or a subsite might be a particular combination of 
dimensions. The number of model subsites is up to you and is dependent on 
the needs of your company.

Part II: Applying Your Goals 
Understanding the Different 
Types of Models
Planning Business Modeler is preloaded with a number of different model 
types to help you create common models. These predefined model types 
work in a similar fashion to predefined dimensions: Much of the structure is 
already built for you, and much of the functionality that drives the logic is 
already embedded in the underlying code. Predefined model types save you 
lots of work if you can use the out-of-the-box functionality.
 
Predefined models are provided for your convenience. You can mimic these 
models by configuring a generic model (with lots of effort). Use the predefined 
models when you need them. Otherwise, use the generic models.
Table 5-1 presents the predefined model types included with Planning 
Business Modeler.
Table 5-1 
Model Types Included with Modeler
Pre-Defined 
Dimension
Description
Generic
The most basic model type and can be used along with any other 
model type.  Contains no predefined rules for accounting logic.  
More than likely the best candidate for most applications.
Global 
Assumptions
Used for baseline data that will apply throughout a business, such 
as headcount, inventory, or price list information or for business 
drivers in a financial model, such as revenue and expenditure 
assumptions.  
To be useful, the Global Assumptions model must be used in con-
junction with other model types.
Exchange 
Rate
A special-purpose assumption model that tracks foreign exchange 
values by period and exchange type for all currencies in your system.   
Because Exchange Rates cannot be aggregated, each granularity 
of time (e.g., day, month, quarter) requires a separate Exchange 
Rate model.  
Like a Global Assumption model, the Exchange Rate model must be 
used in conjunction with other model types.
Financial 
Model with-
out Shares 
Calculation
Includes built-in logic to perform consolidations without shares 
calculations. If you have one entity, or multiple entities that are 
analyzed individually, use this model type. For example, this model 
is correct when all of the companies are completely owned by a 
single parent.  The model provides intercompany eliminations, and 
jobs for consolidations.

85
 Chapter 5: Bringing the Pieces Together: Building a Model
Pre-Defined 
Dimension
Description
Financial 
Model with 
Shares 
Calculation
Includes built-in logic to perform consolidations that include shares 
calculations. For example, if you have multiple entities partially 
owned by other businesses, then the inclusion of share calcula-
tions may be very relevant to your application.  This model provides 
all of the features of the “without shares” version with the addi-
tional of jobs to support intercompany eliminations.  
Exchange 
Rate
The Exchange Rate dimension stores a list of conversion rates 
between currencies. Used in conjunction with the Currency dimen-
sion, the Exchange Rate dimension assists in various point-in-time 
assessments of dollar value for international transactions.
Flow
The Flow dimension provides tracking of cash flows and monetary 
amounts between time periods.
Intercompany
Intercompany dimensions interact with the Entity dimension 
to establish relationships between entities for management 
or legal reasons. This dimension is maintained internally by 
PerformancePoint
Scenario
The Scenario dimension comprises the storage of values associ-
ated with budget, actual, and forecast values. From a Analysis 
Services perspective, the Scenario dimension is akin to the con-
cept of measures in a cube. Here, the numerical components of the 
Scenario dimension exist against the Time dimension as snapshot 
figures.
Time
The Time dimension comprises one of the most important dimen-
sions for any model. The Time dimension provides a hierarchy that 
naturally captures the relationships inherent in a calendar, such as 
Years, Quarters, Months, Weeks, and Days. The Time dimension is 
required for all Models and is one of the first dimensions created 
through the Application Calendar Wizard.
User
The User dimension provides a means to easily manage the 
reporting lines, and assignment an distribution as part of Process 
Management.
 
Each predefined model type may require different dimensions. The presence 
of the required dimensions casts light on why many of the predefined dimen-
sions from Chapter 4 are so tightly preconfigured. Because the kind folks at 
Microsoft want to provide you with a technical framework for composing easy 
common models, the requirement is that to use these framework models, you 
must comply with the required structures. The predefined model types need 
a very particular type of input to work properly. That input comes from the 
tightly controlled predefined dimensions.
 
Microsoft fully expects you to add your own dimensions to the model to tailor 
to fit the model to your needs. However, you must add the required dimensions.

86
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
For the purposes of illustration, the following sections utilize a generic model 
that allows you to build a model from scratch. As an optional section, you 
have the opportunity to build an assumption model to link to the generic 
model for additional functionality. Let’s get going!
 
We’re using the example of forecasting here, but we could replace forecast-
ing with budgeting, planning, or any other metric. In fact, we could combine 
some of these metrics for a rather grand model. For now, we’ll keep it on the 
simple side.
Building a Model
Generally, the process of creating the different kinds of models available 
within Planning Business Modeler doesn’t differ significantly. The primary 
difference in the methodology of creating these models lies in the particular 
dimensions that must be configured for the predefined models. How those 
dimensions are configured really depends on you.
Assuming that you have Planning Business Modeler open, use the following 
steps to create a new generic model:
 
1. From within Planning Business Modeler, navigate to the Models link 
in the Workspace Browser panel.
 
2. Click the Create A Model link in the Workspace Actions panel. 
 
 This launches the Create A Model Wizard (see Figure 5-1).

 By entering a name and pressing Tab, your name will be replicated in 
the Label field as well. Make sure to select the Allow This Model To Be

4. Click the Next button.
 
 The Select Data Source And Type dialog box opens (see Figure 5-2). 
Choose Create A New Model. From the drop-down list, choose a model 
type to build. For this example, we’re using the generic model.

The Select 
Data Source 
And Type 
dialog box.
 
 
5. Click the Next button.
 
 The Define Dimensions and Member Sets dialog box opens (see Figure 
5-3). You have the option of adding dimensions to the model beyond the 
ones that accompany your selected model by default. For this example, 
we add two dimensions that we created in the previous chapter.
 
 To add the product category dimension, select Product Category from 
the Dimension drop-down list. In the Member Set drop-down list, we can 
add the All Members member set. If you want to call this member set 
something else, enter the name in the Alias text box. For this example, 
we leave the default entry in the Alias text box.
 
6. Click the right-facing arrow next to the Member Set drop-down box to 
add the dimension or member set to the model.
 
 Repeat the process for each dimension you want to include in your 
model. For this example, the product category dimension is sufficient.

 The Specify Assumptions dialog box opens. Specifying assumptions 
requires the availability of another model site. Because we haven’t cre-
ated one yet, we need to skip this step for now.
 
 If you did have an assumptions model to use, the Specify Assumptions 
dialog box would allow you to use data from that other model site to 
drive the numbers in the current model site.
 
 Later in the chapter, in the section “Linking to an Assumption Model,” 
we build an assumption model and demonstrate how to connect it to 
your current model.
 
8. Click the Next button.
 
 The Review and Create Model dialog box opens. This page summarizes 
the configuration actions you’ve taken through the wizard.
 
9. Click the Finish button.
 
 The wizard closes, and you are brought back to the Models workspace 
in the primary panel.
 
10. Within the Workspace Actions panel, click the Check In link.
 
 Your new model with all the associated configurations are saved and 
stored on the planning server.
Congratulations! Not so difficult, right? Actually, before you get too excited, 
we still have a significant amount of work to do before you have a fully built 
solution. Remember, the model is really just a container that connects the 
pieces (the dimensions) together. Now we need to really make your model 
function like a model. You’ll do that by

✓ Using time intelligence to schedule periodic current period updates
 
✓ Creating model subsites
You can also link your model to an assumptions model for added capabilities.
Adding Dimensions to an Existing Model
Just because you already created a handful of dimensions while building your 
initial model, you may want or need to add more dimensions to the model in 
the future.
To add more dimensions, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Manage Model Dimensions option.
 
 This brings you back to the same dialog box you used in the Define 
Dimensions and Member Sets step when building the initial model.
 
2. Select the dimension you want to add from the dimensions drop-
down list.
 
 Also, select the member set from the dimension that is to be added. 
Click the right-facing arrow so that the dimension appears in the table 
on the right.
 
3. Click the Check In link after completion.
 
Using the Manage Model Dimensions option, you can also delete dimensions 
from your model. Rather than clicking the right-facing arrow to move a dimen-
sion to the table on the right, you can select an existing dimension in the table 
and click the Delete button. This removes the selected dimension from your 
model.
Scheduling Periodic Updates
By default, your model contains a definition of the current period that you 
specified during the configuration of the time dimension through the Calendar 
Wizard. This current period defines the scope of time that comprises the focus 
of data-entry work. Essentially, the current period pertains to the data you 
want your users to be concentrated on now. However, your current period 
needs to move at some point down the line so that your users can work on the 
next cycle. To shift the current period, you have the option of defining when 
and how that period shifts by using a specific function in your model.

90
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
The current periods you schedule for your models don’t necessarily need to 
be consistent. The current period for sales models may occur twice a year, 
while your forecasting and resourcing models may be more frequent or less 
frequent. Scheduling your current periods is conducted at the model level. If 
you have multiple model sites, you can have a single current period schedule 
for each.
To schedule current period updates, follow these steps:
 
1. Within the Workspace Browser pane, select Models.
 
2. Click the generic model you created and click the Check Out link in 
the Workspace Actions panel.
 
3. In the Workspace Actions panel, click the Schedule Current Period 
Updates link.
 
 The Schedule Current Period dialog box opens (see Figure 5-4).
 
Figure 5-4: 
The 
Schedule

dialog box.
 
 
4. In the Update Time box, enter the date information for your current 
period to change.
 
 This is the date and time when you want the current period to change 
from the current one to the next one. When the server matches the 
actual time to the time you specify, a new current period will begin.
 
 You can also use the calendar pop-up tool to select your current period 
end point.
 
5. Click the Ellipsis button next to the Set Current Period To box (see 
Figure 5-5).
 
 The Add Or Remove Members to Include Them In The Selection For

Linking to an Assumption Model
While not always necessary, linking an assumption model to a generic model 
can yield a tremendous amount of functionality to your resulting application. 
The presence of a global assumption model provides a catalog or baseline 
of figures (whether they are such values as product prices, shipping costs, 
manufacturing costs, or interest rates) that can serve as the basis for project-
ing and modeling other numbers within your generic model.
Think of assumptions as baseline data that can be used throughout a busi-
ness or a financial model. For example, in a sales planning model, you can 
use data items such as product costs, shipping costs, exchange rates, and 
predicted shipment times. Organizing assumption data into a separate model 
allows other models to use the assumption data easily. For example, to use 
product pricing data, you simply connect the pricing assumption model to 
the sales planning model.
One powerful feature of assumption models is that they can be used globally. 
Specifically, a single assumption model can feed data and utility for multiple 
other models. For example, a single assumption model can contain product 
pricing data that can be linked to a sales planning model, a profitability fore-
casting model, and a corporate expense model simultaneously.
Assumption models aren’t limited to a single set of numeric figures. Multiple 
sets of data can be contained within a single assumption model. For example, 
your assumption model may contain product pricing, head counts, unit 
costs, and growth rates. Thus, assumption models serve as a repository for 
baseline data that can be used globally.
The advantage of an assumption model is that all the data serving as a base-
line for other models can be maintained in a single model. You don’t need 
to synchronize data within multiple distinct models. Change the assumption 
model, and all the models connected to the assumption model can automati-
cally adjust as well.
To link as assumption model, the first step is to create an assumption model. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Follow the instructions in the section “Building a Model,” earlier in 
this chapter, to build a generic model.
 
 Enter a name and label for your model (see Figure 5-7). By entering a 
name and pressing Tab, your name is replicated in the Label field as 
well. Make sure to select the Allow This Model To Be Shared check box.

 Chapter 5: Bringing the Pieces Together: Building a Model
Creating a Model Subsite
Model subsites provide the ability to segment and narrow the scope and 
breadth of a model to tailor and restrict access to particular dimensions. 
Model subsites inherit the attributes of the parent model site when the par-
ticular attributes have been selected for sharing during dimension and model 
creation. If the dimensions and relationships established in the parent model 
site change, the downstream model sites continue to inherit the changes as 
well. Thus, the primary benefit to model subsites is that the maintenance of 
the underlying data within your parent model site can be managed in a single 
location, and any subsequent changes can automatically flow through to the 
model subsites.
You can create as many model sites as you want. As an example, you can 
create a model subsite using the Sales Planning model that also inherits its 
link to the Pricing Assumptions model. In this new model subsite, you will 
restrict the region dimension to only include regions within the USA member. 
Thus, users accessing this new USA Sales Planning model will only need to 
deal with data pertaining to relevant regions.
To create a model subsite, follow these steps:
 
1. From the Workspace Browser panel, select Models.
 
2. From the Workspace Actions panel, select the Create a Model link.
 
 The Create a Model Wizard opens.
 
3. Type the name and label for your model subsite (see Figure 5-11).
 
 For this example, enter USA Sales Planning for the name and label. Also, 
select the Allow This Model To Be Shared check box. Click the Next 
button.
 
4. From the Select Data Source And Type dialog box, select the Create A 
Model By Copying From An Existing Model option (see Figure 5-12).
 
 Choose the Sales Planning model you created earlier. Click the Next 
button.
 
5. Click the Next button through the remaining wizard screens to accept 
the default options.
You’ve created a new model subsite called USA Sales Planning. However, 
the model subsite is exactly the same as the original Sales Planning model. 
You’ve also inherited the Pricing Assumptions model association that existed 
before against your generic Sales Planning model.

W
ith a set of dimensions in place and consolidated into a model, you’re 
most of the way through the process of building a running applica-
tion. From here on, the goal is to increase the usability and appropriateness 
of your model to your users.
Understanding Forms and Reports
Selecting the Forms And Reports link in the Workspace Browser panel in 
Planning Business Modeler shows all the forms and reports stored in the 
repository. The repository for all the forms and reports is tied to folder loca-
tions specified in the Planning Administrative Console configuration for the 
associated application.
If you open Planning Administrative Console and navigate to your application, 
click the Edit button and you can see exactly where your reports will go as you 
create them (see Figure 6-1).

Figure 6-1:

tion settings

and reports.
 
The main function of the Forms And Reports link in Planning Business 
Modeler is to inform you about what forms and reports already exist. You 
can administer the reports through Planning Business Modeler by deleting 
items that users no longer want or by controlling access to those forms.
 
Chapter 7 digs into the concept of forms and reports. But you will need a form 
or two already in place to get through this chapter.
Getting to Know Process Management
Think of process management within PerformancePoint as if you were con-
ducting an orchestra. While you have the score in front of you consisting of 
all the parts for all the instruments, you still need a way to direct the parts 
to work together in synchrony. As the conductor, you control which instru-
ments will be playing, when those instruments start and stop, and how many 
instruments play for each part.
In much the same way, PerformancePoint provides similar orchestration 
through the process management tools in Planning Business Modeler. You con-
trol when your users get access to the model, how much of that model they get 
to see, how much time they get to see it, and how much control they have to 
change it. By controlling these aspects of the flow of information, you assist in 
the synchronization and organization of information to and from the model.

101
 Chapter 6: Shoring Up Your Model with Security and Process
The process management component of Planning Business Modeler allows 
you to manage three distinct aspects of a model:
 
✓ Jobs: A job constitutes a system task that doesn’t require user interac-
tion, such as loading data, running rule sets, or sending notifications. In 
Planning Business Modeler, jobs can conveniently be created as part of 
a process schedule inside a cycle. They can also exist independently of 
a cycle. For the purposes of this chapter, we discuss jobs within a cycle 
(the easiest example being sending notifications).
 
✓ Assignments: An assignment can be created within Planning Business 
Modeler to associate a particular cycle task to a user. Assignments 
appear as worksheets in the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel. The 
assignments are routed to the appropriate users, who are responsible 
for adding the requested information and submitting it to the computer 
that is running Planning Server. Each assignment has a start date; sub-
mission and approval deadlines; and a submission, review, and approval 
process. Together, the dates, processing requirements, and jobs are 
called a cycle.
 
✓ Cycles: A cycle defines the date that a job will occur on or when an 
assignment is due. A cycle might be a one-time occurrence, or it might 
be scheduled to recur repeatedly over a span of time or a specific 
number of instances.
By creating cycles containing forms, jobs, and assignments, the implementa-
tion of a model becomes smoother. Rather than call multiple contributors 
on the phone to have information entered into a spreadsheet, you can notify 
them automatically through an assignment. Wrap those assignments with 
time-based constraints so that the users are notified at the right time to enter 
the data, and give them a specific amount of time to do that. If your users are 
late entering the numbers, notify them automatically that they are late, or 
control how the system manages that tardiness. You can also implement a 
structure to repeat the cycle at regular intervals. Why waste time managing 
the input process when it can be managed automatically after you set up pro-
cess management properly?
The general methodology for configuring process management is to
 
1. Create a cycle.
 
2. Associate specific jobs to the cycle (including notifications).
 
3. Assign users to the cycle for data entry.
Let’s get going!

102
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
Creating a cycle
Cycles are a critical component of planning models in that the regulation 
and administration of information coming from users must be a managed 
process. Cycles constitute the primary mechanism through which regulated 
processing of user-provided data is achieved.
Follow these steps to create a cycle:
 
1. In the Workspace Browser panel, select Process Management.
 
2. In the Workspace Actions panel, select the Create A Cycle link.
 
 The Cycle Wizard dialog box opens.
 
3. In the Name The Cycle dialog box, enter a name and label for your 
cycle. Click the Ellipsis button next to the Owner option.
 
 The Select Owner dialog box opens (see Figure 6-2).
 
Figure 6-2: 
Selecting an 
owner for 
the cycle.
 
 
 Each cycle created can have only one owner. The list of owners is inher-
ited from users configured within Planning Administrative Console. Only 
the owner has the power to change the status of a cycle.
 
 Choose the owner of the cycle by double-clicking the name. The entry 
appears in the right panel.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Select Owner dialog box closes, and you are returned to the Name 
The Cycle dialog box (see Figure 6-3). Click the Next button.

6. Click the Next button.
 
 The Define Data-Entry Scope dialog box opens. The data period repre-
sents the boundaries of the time dimension for which you want your 
users to enter data.
 
 If you choose 6/30/2008 as a start date and 9/30/2008 as an end date, 
your users can enter data for all the time buckets during that interval. 
Essentially, setting the data period selects the time-level entries open for 
data entry for the current cycle.
 
7. Click the Edit button next to the Start box.
 
 The Select Members dialog box opens (see Figure 6-5). Select the date 
for the start of your cycle data. Click the OK button.

available items are inherited from the scenario dimension you created in 
Chapter 4.
 
10. Click the Next button.
 
 The Start And End Date dialog box opens (see Figure 6-7).
 
 From the drop-down boxes, choose when you want to allow your users 
to start and stop entering budget information.

 While the start and end dates for Step 6 represent the boundaries of the 
data resident in the cycle, here the start and end dates represent the 
amount of time your users have to actually enter the data. For example, 
you may schedule a Q3 budget to be entered two months prior to the 
beginning of Q3. You can set when that data-entry period starts and 
ends here. Click the Next button.

11. Ensure that the Enable Notifications check box is selected.
 
 When the data-entry period begins, PerformancePoint will notify users 
with assignments through e-mail that tasks have been initiated.
 
12. Click the Next and Finish buttons.
Your first cycle has been created. You can always go back and edit your cycle 
by accessing the cycle and then selecting the Edit Cycle Properties link in the 
Workspace Actions panel. However, there’s more to be done with cycles to 
make the machine run.
Associating forms and assignments 
to a cycle
After your cycle has been configured, the next step is to create the catalog of 
forms that users can access to enter their numbers. The process of associat-
ing forms and creating assignments happens in the same series of steps in 
Planning Business Modeler. This makes sense given that cycles depend on 
the combination of forms and the users entering data into those forms.
 
To assign forms, you need to have some forms ready. The best way to create 
forms is through the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel. You can skip to 
Chapter 7 to read about creating forms. After you have a form or two pub-
lished, return to this section to associate the form to your cycle.
 
The full configuration of cycles requires the availability of users who have 
been assigned to roles through the security module of Planning Business 
Modeler. Even if you choose individual users, they still need to have been 
assigned to the model through the security components. See the section 
“Configuring Security,” later in this chapter, to understand how users are 
assigned to roles.
The process of assigning forms is relatively straightforward. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. With your cycle selected in the Workspace Browser, click the Assign 
Forms link in the Workspace Actions panel.
 
 The Create An Assignment Definition dialog box opens (see Figure 6-8).
 
2. Enter a name and label for your assignment. Click the Next button.
 
 The Data Submission page opens.

6. Click the Next button.
 
 The Review And Approval dialog box opens (see Figure 6-12).
 
 Specify the method for how a submission needs to be approved (if at 
all). The approval process can involve submission by a contributor, 
followed by checking of the submission by a reviewer, with final say 
provided by an approver. The nature of the review or approval depends 
on the structure of your company and the process required to ensure 
quality in the budgeting process. You may skip reviewers or approvers 
altogether, or you may choose to include just a portion of the process.
 
7. Click the Next button.
 
 Depending on the options selected in the previous step, either the 
Review dialog box opens or the Approval page opens (see Figure 6-13). 
In either case, you must select the individuals or roles that are to fill 
the responsibilities for reviewing or approving submissions. While both 
roles can modify submission entries, the hierarchy between the roles 
dictates that contributors are checked by reviewers, and reviewers are 
checked by approvers. The process of assigning users to each role is the 
same for each step.
 
8. Click the Next button.
 
 After reviewing the summary page, click the Finish button. Multiple 
assignments can be made for a given cycle. Simply repeat the preceding 
steps to create more assignments.
 
 While the previous steps create the assignment, one more step needs to 
be taken to put the assignments into effect.

 Chapter 6: Shoring Up Your Model with Security and Process
Configuring Security
Ensuring proper access to data within an organization is always a priority. 
When dealing with corporate forecasts and budgets, that emphasis on secu-
rity and access becomes heightened dramatically. The sensitivity of budget-
ary figures can weigh heavily on the minds of executives and directors when 
the possibility exists that such figures could be compromised. With that in 
mind, PerformancePoint provides a relatively robust methodology for ensur-
ing that planning data is distributed to the right folks within an organization 
by creating a security framework.
The security framework consists of a layered approach using user-based and 
role-based security. Identified users have access to particular data elements 
as dictated by their membership in roles. Who belongs to what role is deter-
mined by a system administrator.
Configuring security in PerformancePoint resides in two places. The first is 
Planning Administrative Console, where users can be added to the system 
and provided access to various component administrative functions (such as 
data administrator, modeler, and global administrator). 
Within a model, security is managed within Planning Business Modeler lever-
aging the user security from Planning Administrative Console. In this way, 
PerformancePoint provides a two-tier security method. You need to be a user 
in Planning Administrative Console, and then you need to be assigned to a 
model security configuration in Planning Business Modeler.
Assuming that users already exist in Planning Administration Console, you 
need to assign users to roles in Planning Business Modeler. First you need to 
create the roles for your security framework. Follow these steps:
 
1. Within the Workspace Browser panel, select Security And Roles.
 
 The primary panel is empty because no business users are currently 
tied to the model.
 
2. From the Workspace Actions panel, click the Create A Business Role link.
 
 The Create A Role dialog box opens (see Figure 6-15).
 
3. Enter a name and label for the role.
 
 Typically, the types of roles should be along the lines of approver, 
reviewer, contributor, manager, director, and so on.
 
 Select the level of access the role should have. Modeler allows three 
levels of security: no access, read-only access, and read-write access.

112
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
Figure 6-15: 
Creating 
a role.
 
 
 The level of security applies across the created role. However, you can fur-
ther restrict access within the role at the user level down to the member 
set. For example, John Doe may be a user within the approver role, which 
grants him read-write access to the model. Later on, you can restrict his 
read-write access only to the East region of the region hierarchy.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Create A Role dialog box closes, and you are returned to the sum-
mary page for your newly created role (see Figure 6-16).
You can repeat the preceding steps for each of the different roles you want to 
create.
In most companies, the number of roles created doesn’t extend beyond three 
levels. A company with more than three levels indicates a level of planning 
and budgeting rigor that is fairly complex and involved.
Next, you need to assign users to your roles. Follow these steps:
 
1. With the summary page for your role still open, select the role you 
want to fill with users.

2. Click the Add Or Remove Users For This Business Role link in the 
Workspace Actions panel.
 
 The Add Or Remove Users dialog box opens (see Figure 6-17).
 
3. Select the users from the left panel you want to add to the role. Click 
the Add Selected link.
 
 Your selected users now appear in the right panel.

114
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Access For panel takes precedence in the primary panel. Here you 
have the option of altering the access to particular member sets by roles. 
See the following section for how to adjust access to member sets by role.
At the conclusion of these steps, you’ve built roles for your model (poten-
tially with a user hierarchy in mind) and assigned users to those roles. 
Remember that your configuration of roles and the users within them are 
completely flexible. A user in one model may have a different role than the 
same user in a different model. Also, the particular hierarchy of roles may 
change from model to model. You may craft some models with one role, 
while others may have three or four roles.
Restricting Access to Member 
Sets by Role
While associating users to roles and roles to assignments within a model site 
may seem sufficient, sometimes you need to restrict the scope of access that 
a user or role can have within a model. For example, you may want to ensure 
that some users only have read-write access to specific members of a dimen-
sion. Or, you may want everyone to be able to view all the figures within a 
member set, but only be able to add or alter numbers for a particular portion 
of a member set.
Planning Business Modeler allows you to configure access to a member set 
right down to the leaf level. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Within the Workspace Browser panel, choose Security And Roles.
 
2. Within the primary panel, select the role you want to alter.
 
 The primary panel switches to the Access For window (see Figure 6-18).
 
3. From the drop-down box for Filter Member Sets By Model, choose the 
model for your alterations.
 
4. In the top half of the primary panel, select the dimension to alter.
 
 The bottom half of the primary panel adjusts to show the contents of 
that dimension.
 
5. In the Workspace Actions panel, select the Customize User 
Permissions check box.
 
 Click the Yes button to continue.

Reports with Excel

▶ Connecting to a planning application through Excel
▶ Developing form templates through a matrix
▶ Publishing form templates to the server
▶ Using assignments to submit planning and budget figures
T
he last piece of the PerformancePoint planning puzzle resides in the 
PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel. While all your work so far has cen-
tered on Planning Administrative Console and Planning Business Modeler, it 
is not time to embark on the Excel Add-in journey. The Excel Add-in supports 
two primary purposes.
The first function is to allow the modeler to develop form templates. These 
templates are stored on the planning server as blank forms, with the basic 
structure consisting of dimensions and scenarios. As a modeler, you develop 
form templates within the Excel Add-in and publish them to the planning 
server. From Planning Business Modeler, you can create assignments to 
direct form templates to your users for data entry in a workflow framework. 
After an assignment is made, the form template becomes a form.
The second function of the Excel Add-in is to provide a familiar means for 
users to complete assignments by filling out the numbers within the forms. 
As assignments are created within Planning Business Modeler, users connect 
to the form through Excel, enter the numbers, and then submit the entries 
back to the planning server for consolidation with other user numbers and 
reporting.
Thus, the Add-in simultaneously addresses an authorship function as well as 
an assignment fulfillment function.

Connecting to the Planning 
Server through Excel
The first step to using the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel is to properly 
connect to the planning server through Excel. For the following discussions, 
we will be referencing Excel 2007. See the online help files if you are using 
Excel 2003.
To connect to the planning server, follow these steps:
 
1. Launch Excel 2007.
 
 If you have already installed the PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel, you 
should have a PerformancePoint tab on the menu bar at the top of the 
page (see Figure 7-1).

120
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
You have now linked Excel to the planning server and are ready to proceed 
to create form templates for your users.
Authoring Form Templates 
in the Excel Add-in
Creating form templates with the Excel Add-in is relatively straightforward. 
Form templates are generally composed of matrices using combinations of 
dimensions and member sets for the columns, and rows and scenario dimen-
sions for the numeric cells of the template.
 
PerformancePoint distinguishes forms from form templates. Form templates 
are the user-entry mechanisms you create to be used as frameworks for your 
users to enter data. Forms are the physical instantiation of the form templates 
when assigned to specific users. Thus, as a modeler, you build form templates, 
while your users enter data into forms assigned to them.
The great thing about the Excel Add-in is that you have a tremendous amount 
of flexibility in how you can configure your form templates. Besides the con-
tents of the template, you can add calculations, formulas, and formatting 
(fonts, borders, colors, and so on) to make the template more functional and 
easier to use and understand.
You have two options in building form templates. First, we run through build-
ing a form using the Report Wizard. Later, we use some of the basic function-
ality found in manual matrix creation. Both methods are acceptable, and you 
may find that one suits your style better than the other.
Using the Report Wizard to 
build a form template
Follow these steps to build your first form template:
 
1. With a connection to the planning server established, click the down 
arrow below the Reports icon on the ribbon bar. Select Report Wizard.
 
 The Choose Application dialog box opens (see Figure 7-4).

basis for your form template.
 
 By selecting the application, you are selecting the root site for the 
model. All associated model subsites will be available for template cre-
ation going forward. The wizard launches.
 
3. Within the Define Report Properties dialog box (see Figure 7-5), enter 
a name for your new report:

• From the Model drop-down box, select the model for which you 
want to link the form template. Note that you can only choose a 
single model to be associated with a single report.

122
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
• In the Select A Report Template Or Report Definition section, choose 
Report Template and select Blank Report from the drop-down box.
 
 If you have financial models, currency exchange models, or other pre-
defined models, you can leverage some of the Excel report templates 
to make the process of creating commonly used reports easier.
 
• Enter $A$1 in the Start In Cell box to start your report in the 
upper-left corner of the spreadsheet. You can start your report in 
any cell of the worksheet. Consider whether you will be inserting 
titles or other information into the form. If so, you can change the 
starting cell to something different than $A$1.
 
4. Click the Next button.
 
 The Edit Rows dialog box opens. Here, you select the dimensions and/
or member sets that will end up in the rows of your form. While in some 
cases, you may choose a single dimension, you can also create form tem-
plates with multiple dimensions/member sets in the rows. Specifically, 
you can use a nested structure to provide finer-grained data-entry capa-
bilities for your users.
 
5. Click the Dimension/Hierarchy box and then click the ellipsis button 
within the box.
 
 The Select Dimension And Hierarchy dialog box opens (see Figure 7-6). 
Choose which dimension and member set within that dimension that 
you would like to show down the rows of your form.

the columns would be configured to contain two main columns, one for 
the current month and one for the year-to-date figures.

that dimension. Click the OK button.
 
11. Select the members of the member set that apply to the form template 
you are creating (see Figure 7-9).
 
 You may select all the members or any subset that suits your template 
needs. Click the OK button.
 
Figure 7-9: 
Selecting 
column 
members.
 
 
12. Within the Define Filters dialog box, edit the items that can be used to 
constitute filters within your form (see Figure 7-10).
 
 A filter provides a method to restrict the displayed data within a report 
to a specific member. Thus, if you define a filter based on the Bikes 
member of the Product Hierarchy member set, you can set the report to 
show just a single set of products and product categories one at a time.
 
 You can also delete the default selections for the filters by clicking the 
Delete button at the top of the dialog box.
 
13. Click the Next button.
 
 The Report Options dialog box opens (see Figure 7-11). Here you can 
configure a number of settings for the template. In most cases, you 
can leave the default settings in place. Later, we explore some ways 
to enable certain options to enhance the functionality and usability of 
some of your form templates.

14. Click the Next button.
 
 The Review And Create dialog box opens, providing a summary of your 
configurations.
 
15. Click the Finish button.
 
 The report you configured is generated and surfaced within Excel (see 
Figure 7-12).
 
Figure 7-12:

template.
 
 
 The worksheet you just created constitutes a template that can be used 
by multiple users to enter data after an assignment is created. For now, 
the report contents are missing — and that’s fine.
Publishing a form template
After you have created a form template, you need to publish the template 
back to the planning server for retention and distribution. A published form 
template resides on the server, not on your workstation. If you only save the 
template on your hard drive, the planning server cannot access the template.
To publish the form template, follow these steps:
 
1. Within the ribbon bar, click the down arrow below Reports in the 
Authoring section.

127
 Chapter 7: Crafting Forms and Reports with Excel
 
 Select Publish➪As Form Template. Name the report as you want it to 
appear within Planning Business Modeler (see Figure 7-13). Also, select 
the appropriate model for the template.
 
Figure 7-13: 
Publishing a 
form 
template to 
the planning 
server.
 
 
2. Click the OK button.
 
 The format, contents, and configuration of the report are saved on the 
planning server.
 
 If you access the Forms And Reports section of Planning Business 
Modeler, you can now see the report you just created listed in the pri-
mary panel.
You can also save the form template locally on your computer. However, 
saving the template to your local computer has no impact on the version 
saved on the planning server. If you change your local version, you will not 
be automatically making changes to the server version.
Using a matrix to build a form template
An alternative method of building a form template is to use a matrix. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. From Excel, connect to the planning server as in Step 1 from the previ-
ous section.
 
2. After you are connected, from the PerformancePoint control window, 
click the Create a Report link.
 
 The Choose Application dialog box opens.
 
3. From the Application drop-down box, select the model for the form 
template (see Figure 7-14).

128
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
Figure 7-14: 
Selecting an 
application.
 
 
4. Click the Add New Matrix icon within the PerformancePoint control 
window.
 
 The New Matrix dialog box opens (see Figure 7-15).
 
Figure 7-15: 
Configuring 
basic matrix 
attributes.
 
 
5. Specify a name for your report template, the starting cell for the form, 
and the model site to be used as the basis for reporting.
 
 If you click the Options tab, you can investigate the same general 
options that were available in the Report Options dialog box using the 
wizard method.
 
6. Click the OK button.
 
 Your newly created (somewhat empty) matrix is listed in the 
PerformancePoint control window.
 
7. Click the green arrow next to Select Dimensions.

129
 Chapter 7: Crafting Forms and Reports with Excel
 
 Here you need to specify which dimensions are to be included as rows, 
columns, and filters. Select a dimension from the left panel, and click the 
appropriate icon to assign it as a row, column, or filter (see Figure 7-16). 
Click the OK button.
 
Figure 7-16: 
Selecting 
rows, 
columns, 
and filters

8. If you selected a filter in the previous step, the Select Filters dialog 
opens (see Figure 7-17). Click the down arrow in the Value box associ-
ated with the filter.
 
 Navigate to the members you would like to include in the report.
 
Figure 7-17:

members for 
the filter.
 

130
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
9. If you need to further restrict the data for a dimension, select Add a 
Property Filter from the Available Actions drop-down box in the con-
trol window and click the right arrow.
 
 The Dimension Property Filter dialog box opens (see Figure 7-18).
 
Figure 7-18: 
Selecting

10. Select the dimension, the property, and the items within the property 
values that should be available to users. Click the OK button.
 
 After a dimension property filter is selected, you must specify the values 
for the filters, just as you did in Step 8.
 
11. To expand the rows and columns from the All member to something 
more specific and descriptive, click the down arrow next to the item 
in the Row Or Column box. Choose Select Members.
 
 The Select Members dialog box opens (see Figure 7-19).
 
Figure 7-19:

131
 Chapter 7: Crafting Forms and Reports with Excel
 
12. Select the members that you would like to see within the rows or col-
umns. Click the OK button.
 
13. In the control window, click the Refresh button.
 
 The newly selected members are presented within the form template. 
Repeat the process for each dimension you would like to expand.
You have created a report using the matrix method. You can further refine 
your report and publish it to the planning server just as you would using the 
wizard approach.
Refining the form template
Beyond creating a form template, enhancing the look, feel, and usability of 
the form template can make the experience easier and more enjoyable for 
your users. Simple adjustments to the organization and functionality of the 
form templates are not difficult. While the available options are numerous, 
the following sections describe a few that should be at the top of your list.
Choosing a matrix style
While in some cases, using the default style for your matrix may be suffi-
cient, adding a splash of color or organizing the data in an easier-to-read way 
enhances the user experience.
To choose a different matrix style, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Matrix Style icon on the ribbon bar.
 
 The Matrix Styles dialog box opens (see Figure 7-20).
 
2. Select a style from the list.
 
 Highlighting an entry provides a preview on the right side of the dialog 
box. The bordering, column and row formats, and colors change with 
each selection. Choose one that suits your needs.
 
 Leave the row and column headers options selected.
 
 You have the option of banding the rows and columns. If you have long 
lists of information in your form template, some form of banding may 
help users quickly identify for which header entries they are entering 
data.
 
 You can set a particular style as a default so that subsequent form tem-
plates you create stay consistent without additional configuration.

132
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
 
Figure 7-20: 
Selecting a 
matrix style.
 
 
3. Click the OK button.
Automatically indenting member sets in the rows
Another means of making reports easier to visualize is to indent the row head-
ers to bring out the hierarchical nature of the dimensions. Follow these steps:
 
1. Click the down arrow below Reports on the ribbon bar. Select 
Properties.
 
 The Properties dialog box opens. Expanding the workbook item in the 
left panel allows you to navigate the components of your form template 
(see Figure 7-21).
 
2. Navigate to your form template under Workbook and Sheet1.
 
 Selecting your form template exposes a variety of properties in the right 
panel.
 
3. Click the down arrow for the item labeled Auto-indent Row Members. 
Ensure that the value is set to True.
 
 You have plenty of other additional options. For the most part, the 
default settings provide a good amount of flexibility. However, you can 
change any of these options to suit your needs.

133
 Chapter 7: Crafting Forms and Reports with Excel
 
Figure 7-21: 
Setting form 
template 
properties.
 
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 Your form template automatically creates an additional indentation of 
the row for each level of the dimension member set (see Figure 7-22).
 
Figure 7-22: 
Indented 
row 
headings.
 

134
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
Enabling autospreading
As a default, most users will enter data into the forms at the leaf level. That 
is, most budget and forecast figures will be conducted at the most granular 
level. However, users may prefer to enter data at a higher level and may want 
to see the numbers projected or broken down into the granular, leaf-level 
items. For instance, instead of allocating budget dollars for each state, a con-
tributor may want to create one entry for the region and have the form auto-
matically subdivide the entry into the states using some methodology.
By configuring your application to accept this form of data entry, you can 
save these users from having to back into their numbers manually. Follow 
these steps:
 
1. On the ribbon bar, click the Options button.
 
 The Options dialog box opens (see Figure 7-23).
 
Figure 7-23: 
Enabling 
auto-
spreading 
functionality.
 
 
2. If the Spreading Type box is enabled, change the entry to Evenly or 
Ratio, depending on your needs:
 
• Evenly spreads the aggregate amount evenly across the leaf-level 
members.
 
• Ratio uses a separate column to determine how much of the 
amount to allocate to each leaf-level member.
You won’t see a change in the way your form template looks, but the change 
will be stored in the planning server, and the template will work differently 
after it is accessed by assigned users.

135
 Chapter 7: Crafting Forms and Reports with Excel
Fulfilling Assignments through 
the Excel Add-in
After your form templates have been authored and published to the plan-
ning server, users can access their assignments by configuring the Process 
Management section of Planning Business Modeler.
 
Each user — whether contributor, reviewer, or approver — requires 
PerformancePoint Add-in for Excel to be installed on the computer where he 
or she will be executing the assignment.
The process management component alerts contributors through e-mail 
when data-entry cycles have begun.
To access the assignment, users simply open Excel, connect to the planning 
server, and then click the Assignments button on the ribbon bar or in the 
control panel. Any assignments directed toward the user are accessible in 
the control panel list.
After a form is selected, users can add and adjust numbers in the form. Based 
on the configuration of the form as stored in Planning Business Modeler, 
users may have access to only certain portions of a form. Cells that are avail-
able for editing are highlighted to indicate access.
If Spreading has been enabled, users may enter data into the higher-level 
heading rows to allocate numbers to the leaf-level members.
After the data entry is complete, the user has a number of options to submit 
the data back to the planning server. On the Actions tab in the control panel, 
users can do the following:
 
✓ Save Privately: Save the data on the workstation without submission to 
the planning server.
 
✓ Submit Draft: Save the data to the planning server with the intention of 
returning to make additional changes before finalization.
 
✓ Submit Final: Save the final version to the planning server. After data is 
submitted using the Submit Final option, the user can no longer make 
changes to the form.
As soon as the finalized data is submitted to the planning server, the process 
management component automatically directs the form with the data to the 
next level in the workflow. If a reviewer or approver is slated to receive the 

136
Part II: Applying Your Goals 
data, an e-mail is sent to that recipient to notify him of the availability of an 
assignment. Depending on the configuration of the process management, 
this workflow may repeat again, sending the completed form first to a con-
tributor, then to a reviewer, and finally to an approver (or as many levels as 
you’ve set up). Reviewers and approvers may be able to adjust the data in 
the forms, add annotations, and/or reject the form. If a rejection occurs, the 
form is reassigned to a contributor for adjustment.
After the form is finalized through all stages of process management, the 
numbers are posted to the planning server and considered final.

shows you how to build them. From connecting to 
data sources, setting up graphic indicators and key per-

H
istorically, the tools used to create and distribute reports have not 
been very centralized. So, you need to learn and use one tool to build 
standard or static reports, another tool to build ad hoc or analytical reports, 
and yet another tool to create scorecards. Then of course comes the task 
of distributing all this information to your users: printing and distributing 
stacks of hard-copy reports; or e-mailing Adobe Acrobat files, Excel spread-
sheets, or links to shared directories. Of course, distribution methods have 
improved over time. You can often publish your reports to a Web server, 
such as Reporting Services Manager or ProClarity Analytics Server. But now 
you still have your standard reports in one place and your analytical reports 
in another. This is where a portal tool like SharePoint stepped in and allowed 
you to consolidate reports created in various tools (for example, ProClarity, 
Reporting Services, and Excel Web Services) into a unified user interface. But 
you have yet another tool to learn. This is where PerformancePoint takes the 
cake, by providing Dashboard Designer, a centralized dashboard develop-
ment and deployment environment.

140
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Understanding the Building 
Blocks of PPS Reporting
Dashboard Designer is the report development platform for 
PerformancePoint Monitoring and Analytics. Dashboard Designer simplifies 
your business performance management implementations by:
 
✓ Providing one environment for developing your static, analytical, and 
scorecard reports
 
✓ Enabling you to easily consolidate these reports into dashboards
 
✓ Allowing you to easily publish these dashboards to your users
It really makes it easy for even an inexperienced report developer to dive in 
and quickly create exciting and powerful business performance dashboards. 
PerformancePoint Dashboard Designer is where the magic happens.
Getting to your reporting interface: 
Dashboard Designer
To get to Dashboard Designer, choose Start➪Microsoft Office 
PerformancePoint Server 2007➪Dashboard Designer. See Figure 8-1. At this 
point, you briefly see a dialog box that states “Verifying application require-
ments” and then your application should launch.
 
Figure 8-1: 
Getting 
to your 
Dashboard 
Designer.
 
 
If you don’t have this application listed in your Start menu, you probably 
haven’t downloaded the link to your Start menu yet. You can access the down-
load from your organization’s central PPS monitoring site. The link should 
look something like this:
http://ppsmonitoring.yourcompanyname.net/Central

141
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
A typical site is shown in Figure 8-2.
 
Figure 8-2: 
Down-
loading 
Dashboard 
Designer.
 
To download the application, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy your PPS central link (that is, http://ppsmonitoring.
yourcompanyname.net/Central) to your Web browser and press 
Enter.
 
 The page shown in Figure 8-2 opens.
 
2. Click the Run or the Go button.
 
 By doing this, you both launch Dashboard Designer and add a link to 
your Start menu.
Getting around your workspace: 
The layout of your screen
Your Dashboard Designer workspace is composed of three frames and a tool-
bar (see Figure 8-3):
 
✓ The frame on the left is your Workspace Browser. This is where you 
can view existing elements (see the section “Elements: The Building 
Blocks of Reporting,” later in this chapter) and create new elements. 
Element types include the following:
 
• Dashboards

142
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
• KPIs
 
• Scorecards
 
• Reports
 
• Data sources
 
• Indicators
 
✓ The frame in the middle is your workspace. This is where you build 
and configure your business performance reports and dashboards.
 
✓ The frame on the right contains details. Details may consist of the 
following:
 
• Other elements that are related to the one in your workspace
 
• A list of fields, dimensions, measures, or filters that you can add to 
the elements in your workspace
 
✓ Up top, you have a toolbar with these three tabs:
 
• The Home tab (shown in Figure 8-3): Contains some workspace-
level tools, including the essential Refresh and Publish All buttons.
 
• The Edit tab: Can change depending on what type of element you 
are working on and provides tools to configure items in your work-
space. We highlight element-specific tools in the element-specific 
sections that follow.
 
• The Create tab: Includes icons that you can click to generate new 
elements. We right-click element folders within the Workspace 
Browser to do this (it’s just faster than opening the Create tab when 
we want to create), so we probably won’t mention this tab again.

 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
Understanding workspace versus server
All over Dashboard Designer, you can see references to workspace and server. 
But what do these terms mean exactly? Does workspace mean that you are 
working locally (like on your hard drive) and server mean that you are work-
ing online? Not necessarily. You might be working with the following four 
tiers, as shown in Figure 8-4:
 
✓ Local (possibly offline): You can work on your elements locally and 
offline by opening a .bswx Dashboard Designer file. You are still using 
your workspace, but if you are not connected to your PPS server, you 
cannot
 
• Connect to data sources
 
• Publish elements
 
• Preview or deploy dashboards
 
✓ Workspace: Your workspace is the tier that hovers between local and 
server; it is literally the space where you do your work:
 
• You can be connected to your PPS server, but you don’t have to be.
 
• You must save items in your workspace to a local .bswx file or pub-
lish them to your PPS server to preserve any changes you make.
 
 Edits made in your workspace are not saved unless you either save or 
publish them.
 
✓ Connected to your PPS server: If you can connect to your PPS server, 
you can retrieve server elements, connect to data sources, publish ele-
ments, and preview dashboards.
 
✓ Connected to your SharePoint server: Your SharePoint server is where 
you will deploy your dashboards. This server will likely have a different 
URL than your PPS server.
Elements: The Building 
Blocks of Reporting
As we mention many times throughout this book, dashboards are just Web 
pages that display a couple of reports. PerformancePoint dashboards look 
like they take a lot of effort to build. That’s great — you’ll appear to be 
extremely talented (as we’re sure you are). But building a dashboard is not 
difficult at all; you just need to take it one step — or element — at a time.
A PerformancePoint element is a piece of content or component that is 
needed to construct a dashboard. Personally, we would have gone with 
another metaphor, but no one asked us.

144
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Anyway, you need some elements to generate other elements. For example, 
you need an indicator to generate a key performance indicator (KPI), you 
need a key performance indicator to generate a scorecard, the knee bone’s 
connected to the thigh bone, and . . . well, you get it. Figure 8-4 shows the 
necessary dependencies for generating elements.

mance

Data Source

The indicator is connected to the key performance indicator
Indicators are the graphics that accompany a key performance indicator. 
These are the gauges, stoplights, thermometers, and smiley (or frowning) 
faces most often associated with scorecards.
See Chapter 10 to find out how to create an indicator.
The key performance indicator’s connected to the scorecard
A key performance indicator shows how your organization is performing 
against its objectives. It is the combination of
 
✓ A data source for actual and target measures
 
✓ An indicator
The KPI element is the comparison of the actual measure (like sales amount) 
to the budget measure (like sales amount quota) that generates the KPI value 
and tells the system which indicator value (good, bad, or borderline) to show.
See Chapter 11 for information on how to create a KPI.

145
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
A brief interruption to bring you: The data source
A data source is a connection to where your data is (for example, your data-
base, Analysis Services cube, or Excel spreadsheet). This is the data you will 
use to populate your other elements such as reports and KPIs. Our favorite 
data source is an Analysis Services cube.
 
See Chapter 9 for more information on how to create a data source.
The scorecard’s connected to the dashboard . . . and so is the report
A scorecard is a grid that displays one or more KPIs in combination with addi-
tional data dimensions or filters (see Chapter 12). Scorecards are designed 
to provide a view of your organization’s performance against goals across a 
number of metrics. Scorecards require the following:
 
✓ A KPI
 
✓ A data source
A report is a grid or chart that displays business performance information 
(see Chapter 13) and requires a data source.
 
Reports, both grids and charts, give you a lot of bang for your buck. That 
is, you can build them easily and quickly, and they can convey a significant 
amount of information to your business users. Scorecards serve their pur-
pose, but don’t underestimate the power of a simple report. 
Dashboard pages provide you with an at-a-glance view of your business per-
formance by combining a couple of highly informative reports and scorecards 
onto one Web page. A dashboard is a Web page that contains one or more
 
✓ Scorecards
 
✓ Reports
For more information on dashboards, see Chapter 14.
 
You cannot deploy (publish to SharePoint for users to see) a report or score-
card to SharePoint unless it is first added to a dashboard page. The dashboard 
is what gets deployed.
Elements are not monogamous
Elements have a many-to-many relationship with each other. That is, you can 
do the following:
 
✓ Use an indicator in many KPIs and have a KPI use many indicators
 
✓ Use a KPI in many scorecards and have a scorecard use many KPIs

146
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
✓ Use more than one data source in some reports and scorecards, and 
have more than one report or scorecard use the same data source
 
✓ Use the same scorecards and reports in many dashboards
Elements are reusable — you build them once and use them repeatedly. Now, 
that’s efficient.
 
To build a dashboard very quickly, you can do the following:
 
✓ Connect to a data source (see Chapter 9): Try a nice Analysis Services 
cube.
 
✓ Create a few reports (see Chapter 13): Analytics grids and charts are 
easy to work with and deliver a lot of business value quickly.
 
✓ Create a dashboard from those reports (see Chapter 14): Assemble the 
reports on the page, deploy to SharePoint, and boom, you’re done.
Even faster, skip the first two items and use reports that others have already 
built — and go straight to the last item.
Managing Your Elements
Typically you will be working in Dashboard Designer while connected to your 
PPS server. This allows you to view what elements you or others have pub-
lished to the server, to retrieve desired elements to your workspace and to 
publish elements back to this shared environment.
Seeing what elements are 
already on your server
So, when you first open Dashboard Designer, it doesn’t look like much is 
there — some empty frames and an empty workspace. Well, not for long.
To view all the elements on your PerformancePoint server (that is, elements 
that other users or you have created and saved), follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Refresh icon on the Home tab of the toolbar.
 
 This icon is shown previously in Figure 8-3. A dialog box opens, showing 
you the progress of the refresh. When that’s done, you see a list of all of 
the dashboards on your PPS server.

147
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
 
 In Figure 8-5, we clicked the Refresh icon, and now we are looking at a 
list of all the dashboards on our PPS server.
 
Figure 8-5: 
Seeing all 
your shared 
elements.
 
 
2. Click the name of the dashboard you want to examine.
 
 The Details frame now shows you all the other elements associated with 
that dashboard.
 
 In Figure 8-5, we select PPSDashboard in the PPSAdventureWorks folder. 
The Details frame now shows all the related KPIs, scorecards, reports, 
indicators, and data sources.
 
Your PerformancePoint Server settings (including connection URL, cache and 
row limit options, permissions, and some defaults) can be found by clicking the 
Windows Office button at the upper-left corner of your screen and then click-
ing the Options button in the lower-right corner of the Office menu. You will 
need administrative access to PPS to access/change some of these settings.
Viewing your elements 
in Workspace Browser
Now you have determined which dashboard or dashboards you want to bring 
into your workspace. Bringing a dashboard into the workspace means that 
you are also bringing in the dashboard itself, with all its related elements. 

148
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
You can bring into your workspace as many dashboards as you like. If you 
have elements that are related to more than one dashboard, that’s okay; the 
elements will only show up once.
When you determine which dashboard(s) you want to bring into your work-
space, follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click the name of the dashboard you want to work on.
 
 The dashboard and all the related elements are loaded to your 
Workspace Browser.
 
 In Figure 8-6, we double-click PPSDashboard and can now see all our 
PPSDashboard elements in the Workspace Browser.
 
Figure 8-6: 
Viewing 
elements 
in your 
workspace.
 
 
2. Double-click an individual element to open it in your Workspace 
Browser.
 
 In Figure 8-7, we double-click PPSAnalyticsChart in the 
PPSAdventureWorks folder of the Report group. The chart opens in the 
Workspace Browser, and the Details frame now shows Available Items, 
or data elements that we can add to our chart.
 
Some elements will show different information in the Details frame. For 
more information on this, see Chapters 9–14 for element-specific Details 
frame information.

149
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
 
Figure 8-7: 
Opening an 
element 
in your 
workspace.
 
When your element is open in the Workspace Browser, you can modify 
or edit it if you want. For more information on working with elements, see 
Chapters 9–14.
Saving your elements
You have the following three ways to save your workspace or any changes 
that you have made to your elements:
 
✓ You can save a workspace file to a directory.
 
✓ You can publish all your element changes back to the PerformancePoint 
server.
 
✓ You can publish a specific element change back to the PerformancePoint 
server.
 
Saving your workspace file to a directory is good for working on drafts of 
dashboards and other elements and for working locally (that is, while not 
connected to your PPS server). However, saving different versions locally of 
the same elements that are stored on the server can create conflicts (see the 
section “Determining differences between workspace and server versions with 
the Compare Data feature,” later in this chapter). These conflicts are resolv-
able, but it’s just easier to publish everything to the server all the time and 
retrieve everything from the server to work on it.

150
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Also, you have to publish your elements to the server to preview and deploy 
them (see Chapter 14).
Saving your workspace file to a directory
Follow these steps to save your workspace file to a directory:
 
1. Click the Office button.
 
 You are given the following options, as shown in Figure 8-8:
 
• New
 
• Open

Saving (publishing) elements to your PerformancePoint server
To save an element to the PerformancePoint server, you have to publish 
it. You can choose to publish just one or all changed elements to your 
PerformancePoint server.
To publish all items, click the Publish All icon on the Home tab, as shown in 
Figure 8-3.
To publish just one element, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the element that you want to publish in your Workspace 
Browser.
 
 An element options menu opens, as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
Figure 8-9: 
Using the 
element 
options 
menu to

2. Choose Publish.
 
 Your element is published to your PerformancePoint server.
Deleting elements
You can delete elements from two places: your current workspace or your 
PerformancePoint server.
 
Be careful about what you delete. Note the following:
 
✓ Try not to delete someone else’s stuff from the server.

152
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
✓ Try not to delete something you don’t want to have deleted.
 
✓ Make sure that the element you are deleting is not currently part of 
another element that you don’t want to delete. That is, don’t delete a 
data source that is being used by a report or scorecard, and don’t delete 
a report or scorecard that is part of a dashboard.
 
✓ If you delete an item from your Workspace Browser, it is not deleted 
from your server.
To delete an element from your Workspace Browser (local), follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the element that you want to delete.
 
 An element options menu opens, as shown in Figure 8-9.
 
2. Choose Delete.
 
 The element is deleted from your Workspace Browser.
To delete an element from your PerformancePoint server, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an element header (Dashboards, Scorecards, Reports, KPIs, or 
Indicator Data Sources) in your Workspace Browser.
 
 Your workspace now shows you a list of all the elements under the 
selected element header that are available on the server.
 
 In Figure 8-10, we clicked the Reports element header in the Workspace 
Browser. Our workspace is showing all reports available on the server.
 
Figure 8-10: 
Deleting 
items from 
your Perfor-
mancePoint 
server —

2. Click the element in your workspace that you want to delete.
 
 A dialog box opens to confirm your deletion, as shown in Figure 8-11.

153
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
 
Figure 8-11: 
Confirming 
your 
deletion.
 
 
3. Click the Yes button in the dialog box.
 
 Your element is deleted from the server.
 
If you delete an item from your server, but it’s still in your workspace, you can 
publish it back to the server.
If you delete an item from your workspace, you can refresh it to your work-
space from the server (see the section “Seeing what elements are already on 
your server,” earlier in this chapter).
To delete an element entirely, you can delete it from both your workspace 
and your server.
Determining differences between work-
space and server versions with the 
Compare Data feature
Sometimes you will have a different version of an element in your workspace 
than you have on your server, and often this is intentional. You will refresh 
your workspace from your PerformancePoint server, edit reports or dash-
boards, and then publish them back to the server.
But sometimes you may find that you have a different version of an element 
on your server than you have on your workspace, and you may not know why 
or what the difference is. This happens when you open a local workspace file, 
edit an element, and then publish that element when another version of that 
element already exists on the server. Or more simply, your workspace ele-
ments and server elements are out of sync.

154
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
The Compare Data feature lists the differences between versions. It can tell 
you the following:
 
✓ The dates the disparate versions were last saved
 
✓ Who saved the versions
 
✓ What field or fields vary
 
✓ The value that was changed and what it was changed to
To compare two versions of an element, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the element you want to analyze in your Workspace Browser.
 
2. Click the Compare Data icon on the Home tab of the toolbar.
 
 The Compare Workspace Version with Server Version information box 
opens.
 
 In Figure 8-12, we selected the PPSLineChart report (not shown) and 
clicked the Compare Data icon. The dialog box indicated that the work-
space version was last saved on May 11, 2008, and the server version 
was saved on April 17, 2008. BI\rblum saved both versions, and the fol-
lowing three fields have changed:
 
• ReportView Custom Data: This refers to the how our report is 
displayed. (In this case, we drilled down on the series from All to 
Product Lines, but you can’t really tell that from the information 
you are given here.) The operation compares the underlying report 
code (in XML, or Extensible Markup Language). So the Old Value/
New Value information we get back is just a snippet of XML, not 
enough to tell you anything, even if you can read and understand 
the XML.
 
• EndPoint UniqueName (First One): This indicates that we have 
added a new value and shows what the new value is — [Product].
[Product Categories].
 
• EndPoint UniqueName (Second One): This indicates that we have 
deleted a field — [Product].[Product Model Lines].
Now you can either choose to do any of the following:
 
✓ Do nothing (but that’s no fun).
 
✓ Publish your workspace version to the server by clicking the Publish 
Item link (see the section “Saving your elements,” earlier in this chapter).
 
✓ Go back to the current server version by clicking the Revert Changes 
icon on the toolbar.

155
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
 
Figure 8-12: 
Comparing 
report 
versions 
between 
your 
workspace 
and server.
 
To revert to the current server version, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the element that you want to revert in your Workspace Browser.
 
2. Click the Revert Changes icon on the Home tab of the toolbar.
 
 A History dialog box opens.
 
3. Click the OK button.
 
 Your element reverts to the current server version.
Changing back to an older 
version of your element
Business users have been known to continually change their reporting 
requirements enough times to make your head spin. No matter how good you 
are at documentation and signing off on requirements, the bottom line is that 
you want to create the best report for your business users to do their work. 
So report development tends to be very iterative in nature.
Perhaps you are new to PerformancePoint and you might try to do something 
that doesn’t quite work out like you had hoped. You want to test functionality 
and try different things. And you should — but without the risk of breaking 
something that’s already working.

156
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
In addition, you may be working collaboratively with other developers on 
the same elements. One of the great benefits of a server-based development 
application like PerformancePoint is that you can work with other developers 
in a shared environment. But certainly a risk exists that another user might 
make a change to an element that you want to change back.
PerformancePoint makes this really easy because it retains all published ver-
sions of each element with its own internal source control. At any time, you 
can revert to any version of any element.
To revert to an older version of an element, follow these steps:
 
1. Select an element in your Workspace Browser.
 
 The element opens in your workspace.
 
2. Click the Revert Changes icon.
 
 Nothing happens yet, except that a dialog box opens, listing all the ver-
sions that have been published and indicating who published them.
 
 Figure 8-13 shows a list of all the published versions of the scorecard 
(PPSScorecard) that are currently in our workspace.
 
Figure 8-13: 
Reverting 
to an older 
version 
of the 
scorecard.
 
 
3. Select the version to which you want to revert (it is highlighted in 
blue) and click the OK button.
 
 Your report reverts to your selected version.
 
 In this case, we select version 16, and version 16 of our scorecard opens, 
as shown in Figure 8-14.

157
 Chapter 8: Getting Started with PPS Monitoring & Analytics
 
Figure 8-14: 
Viewing an 
older report 
version.
 
 
4. Publish your changes.
 
 When you publish this element now, it becomes the most current version. 
 
 In this case, because version 16 was the latest version, this becomes 
version 17.
 
5. To revert to your most current version, repeat Steps 1 and 2, and in 
Step 3, select the most current version.
 
 In this case, we would select version 16 and click the OK button.

spreadsheet

▶ Letting other developers use or edit your new data source element
I
f you receive pages of monthly or quarterly reports, or if you are the one 
who is creating these reports, you know that your company has a lot of 
data. Perhaps you were involved in deploying a very expensive administration 
system or data-warehousing implementation, so you know your company has 
a lot of data. Having the right data isn’t often an issue for organizations. In fact, 
many organizations capture vast amounts of significant and timely information. 
But what they don’t have are the right tools to tap into that information effi-
ciently and effectively to enable proper performance management.
Getting to your organization’s business performance data is the first step in 
being able to compile, report, and distribute that information for users to 
monitor and analyze — and start making business decisions.
Where’s the Data?
So, if you have so much data available, why is it such a time-consuming, slow, 
and costly process to access this data, to make it actionable for your business 
users? It’s because your data is not stored correctly for performance reporting. 

160
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
Getting the data from your operational (transactional or administration) 
systems to a proper reporting data environment requires the following:
 
✓ A lot of planning, both short-term and long-term, to ensure that the system 
will be scalable (can grow in volume) and extensible (can grow in content)
 
✓ Rationalization of multiple business sources into a cohesive and 
meaningful combined data structure
 
✓ Proper design to ensure that the system can quickly and accurately 
provide actionable business performance data
Bringing operational sources together 
for business performance reporting
An organization has to go through a couple of steps to get its operational 
data into the proper format for business performance reporting. Operational 
data is the information that comes from an organization’s administration sys-
tems. Multiple systems may be collecting data. For example:
 
✓ Insurance companies have claims administration systems and policy 
administration systems, among others.
 
✓ Banks have retail administration systems and perhaps credit administra-
tion systems, among others.
 
✓ Retail organizations may have sales administration systems and inventory/
purchasing administration systems.
In addition to the administration systems, the following other sources of 
useful data may exist:
 
✓ Planning and budget databases or spreadsheets
 
✓ External data sources that provide demographic and economic information 
on businesses, customers, or prospects
So you have a lot of data. But the issue is that you can’t build business per-
formance management systems off of operational data. Why, you may ask? 
The answer lies in the following points:
 
✓ Operational data is just not structured and stored for optimal reporting. 
You know how you have these online reports that run for hours or just 
hang and are very frustrating? This is largely due to how the underlying 
data is being stored and consolidated for your report.

161
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
✓ Data from multiple systems (like claim to policy) is not joined, so you 
can’t analyze the metrics together. You lose a lot of analytical capabili-
ties when your data is disjointed or, we should say, you gain significant 
amounts of knowledge when you can join data across systems.
So two lessons can be learned:
 
✓ If you want to create reports, you should use a data source that is opti-
mized for reporting. See the following section for more information.
 
✓ This data source should optimally have already consolidated data from 
multiple sources.
Knowing which data source types 
to use for performance reporting
Business performance source data can take many forms, including the following:
 
✓ Analysis Services cubes: Analysis Services is a multidimensional data-
base. It stores data in a structure called a cube, which contains measures 
(numeric values that quantify how your business is performing) that 
can be sliced and diced (viewed) by dimensions that contain attributes 
(values that define a characteristic of the measure) and hierarchies (a 
set of attributes that are related to each other in a multilevel parent-
child association).
 
• Analysis Services stores data in a structure that is highly optimized 
for querying, so it’s really fast.
 
• It gives you a consolidated view of all your dimensions and mea-
sures, so it’s great for creating grids and charts and for the major-
ity of your business performance management reports.
 
• You need an Analysis Services cube to build analytics charts, ana-
lytics grids, and trend analysis charts. Other data sources don’t 
work for these report types. You can also use Analysis Services as a 
source for dashboard filters and KPI data. Basically, everything you 
need to do in PPS, you can do with an Analysis Services data source.
 
• Cubes enable you to easily build KPIs and scorecards.
 
✓ SQL Server tables: 
 
• If you don’t have an Analysis Services cube, you can also use an 
SQL table or view right off of your data mart or data warehouse.
 
• You can use SQL tables to build dashboard filters. For example, 
to source a list of values, a user could select from a dashboard or 
report drop-down menu. You can also use SQL as a source for KPI 
data, actual or budget.

162
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
 Because tables can’t be joined in Dashboard Designer, make sure that all 
the data you need to build a given report is in one table or view (flat as 
opposed to relational or dimensional).
 
✓ Excel spreadsheets:
 
• Lots of business users keep their business performance data in 
Excel spreadsheets. While this is not a practice we recommend 
(performance can be poor, and spreadsheets are not robust and 
secure enough to be productionized), it is almost inevitable that 
users will have some data, like budget numbers, in Excel.
 
• Optimally, you want to get this data into an SQL table and then into 
an Analysis Services cube. But (nonoptimally) using Excel as a data 
source is an option.
 
• You can access Excel data through Excel Services or Excel 2007.
 
• You can manually enter data into an Excel spreadsheet from 
PerformancePoint. There are probably lots of cool uses for this. 
It’s not very productionized, but it’s cool.
 
• You can use Excel spreadsheets as a source for dashboard filters 
and KPI data, actual and/or budget.
 
✓ Other sources: You can also connect to other data sources through an 
ODBC (Online Database Connection) or even a SharePoint list. We don’t 
go into much detail on these for the following reasons:
 
• You are probably going to be using one of these options: Analysis 
Services, an SQL table, or Excel.
 
• Using one of these other data sources is more limiting than those 
noted. For example, you can only return one value with an ODBC, 
as opposed to an entire cube or even an SQL table or view. So, 
ODBC might be good for setting up a data source for a filter list but 
not much good for business performance reporting.
 
If you want to build a pivot table or chart, you set up the data source for that 
when you create the report itself. For more information, see Chapter 13.
Using Your Existing Data Sources
The easiest way to get started building reports and dashboards is to 
leverage an existing data source, like one that you retrieve from your 
PerformancePoint Server when you refresh (see Chapter 8).

163
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
To view your server data sources, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Data Sources element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 In your workspace, you can see a list of all the data sources available on 
your PerformancePoint Server.
 
 Figure 9-1 shows our server data sources in the Workspace frame. We 
collapsed all the folders except PPSAdventureWorks (folders have folder 
icons). The data source in this folder is also called PPSAdventureWorks 
(data sources have data source icons). You can also see the following:
 
• Type: PPSAdventureWorks is an Analysis Services database. Other 
source types include SQL tables and Excel spreadsheets.
 
• Owner: This is the owner of the data source as set in your data 
source properties. In this case, it’s BI\rblum.
 
• Version: Each time an element is modified and saved or published, 
a new version is created and prior versions are archived.
 
 If you don’t see any data sources, make sure that you’ve refreshed your 
workspace (see Chapter 8).
 
2. Double-click the data source that you want to bring into your 
Workspace Browser (or select the data source and click the Open 
Items icon on the Home toolbar).
 
 When we double-click PPSAdventureWorks, the data source (within 
its folder structure) shows up on the Workspace Browser under Data 
Sources.
 
Figure 9-1: 
Seeing the 
server data 
sources.
 

164
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
You do not need to bring the data source into your workspace to use it for 
reports or KPIs. When you create a report or KPI and point to a server data 
source, PPS automatically brings the data source into your workspace for 
you. You may, however, want to bring the data source into your Workspace 
Browser so that you can edit it or view its properties.
Connecting to Your Data by 
Creating a New Data Source
Your primary data sources will be Analysis Services cubes, SQL Server tables 
or views, and Excel spreadsheets.
The majority of examples in this book focus on the implementation of PPS 
with an Analysis Services data source, namely the Adventure Works DW 
Analysis Services cube that comes with SQL Server Analysis Services. If 
it’s not already installed on your server and you want to download it, see 
Appendix 1.
Analysis Services rocks
In case you didn’t notice, we recommend 
Analysis Services as your underlying data 
structure, for the following reasons, if it’s built 
correctly:
 ✓ It’s fast. Users who are used to waiting 10 
minutes (minimally) for their online query to 
run (if it didn’t hang or crash) will be very 
pleased with the response they get — in 
seconds — from Analysis Services.
 ✓ It supports complex associations (like 
many-to-many relationships) between 
data attributes and always gives you the 
“right” answer. The classic example of this 
in banking is the customer who has many 
accounts and the account that has many 
customers. If you are looking at a report 
that contains two customers who share a 
joint account, and looking at all the account 
balances those customers own, you will be 
looking at the same balances more than 
once. That’s fine, but the problem is includ-
ing those balances more than once in the 
Total line of your report. Analysis Services 
manages how measures should be cor-
rectly represented and summed, counting 
the same balance only once in the total.
 ✓ You can prebuild hierarchies, which are 
attribute layers that are associated with 
each other in a parent-child relationship.
 ✓ You can generate calculated fields like 
ratios and percentages at varying levels of 
summarization, for example, as you drill up 
and down a hierarchy.
 ✓ You can build a PerformancePoint Server 
dashboard soup to nuts (or data source ele-
ment to dashboard element, as it were) with 
just one Analysis Services data source — 
not so for the other data source types.

165
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
But while the rest of the book mostly uses an Analysis Services data source, 
you may want to leverage SQL or Excel, so connecting to these sources is 
covered here.
Creating an Analysis Services data source
Creating a new data source element is not actually creating the data source 
itself (like an SQL table or Analysis Services database), but rather creating a 
connection to an existing data source.
To create a new Analysis Services data source element, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Data Sources element header.
 
 The data source options menu opens, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
2. Select New Data Source from this menu.
 
 The Select a Data Source Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 9-3.
 
Figure 9-2: 
Creating a 
new data 
source 
element.
 
 
3. Select a data source template by choosing the following:
 
• Category: Multidimensional
 
• Template: Analysis Services
 
 Your data source options also include the following categories:
 
• Standard Queries: Template - ODBC
 
• Tabular List: Template - Excel Services
 
• Tabular List: Template - Import from Excel 2007
 
• Tabular List: Template - SharePoint List
 
• Tabular List: Template - SQL Server Table

166

4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Create a Data Source dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-4, 
although the Name and Display Folder fields will be blank.
 
Figure 9-4: 
Naming 
your data

element.
 
 
5. Enter a name for your data source.
 
 If you want to store the data source in a folder, you can create a folder 
by typing the name in the Display Folder Location field (or click the 
Select Display Folder button to select an existing folder).
 
 In Figure 9-4, we enter PPSAdventureWorks as the name of the data 
source element and create a folder called PPSAdventureWorks.

167
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
 Folders are very helpful for keeping your elements organized — by user, 
by project, or even by data source type.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your data source properties tab is now open in your workspace, and 
your data source element is added to your Workspace Browser.
 
 Figure 9-5 shows our new data source, PPSAdventureWorks, in the work-
space open to the Editor tab.
 
Figure 9-5: 
Making a 
connection 
to your data 
source.
 
 
7. Select the Use Standard Connection option in the Connection Settings 
section and enter the server name.
 
 As shown in Figure 9-5, we enter the server name devsql6\as2005x64.
 
8. Click the Database drop-down arrow to select a database from the 
server you entered in Step 7.
 
 In Figure 9-5, we select Adventure Works DW.
 
9. Click the Cube drop-down arrow to select a cube from the Analysis 
Services database you selected in Step 8.
 
 In Figure 9-5, we select the Adventure Works cube.
 
 Test your connection at this point, making sure that you can connect 
properly to your data source, by clicking the Test Connection button at 
the lower-left corner of the Editor tab. If you have connection problems, 
contact your IT department or help desk.

168
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
10. Publish your item to your PPS server (see Chapter 8 for more informa-
tion on publishing elements).
 
 When you publish your new data source, the little pencil graphic on 
your data source icon in Workspace Browser disappears, as shown in 
Figure 9-6.
 
 You can also save your workspace, but if you plan to publish reports based 
on your new data source, and then preview or deploy dashboards based on 
the scorecards, you need to publish the item.
 
 You are now ready to create some reporting or KPI elements with your 
Analysis Services data source.
 
Figure 9-6: 
Your data 
source is 
published. 
Yay! 
Creating an SQL table data source
To define your SQL table connection, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Data Sources element header.
 
 The data source options menu opens, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
2. Select New Data Source from this menu.
 
 The Select A Data Source Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 9-3.
 
3. Select a data source template by choosing the following:
 
• Category: Tabular List
 
• Template: SQL Table
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Create A Data Source dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-4, 
although the Name and Display Folder fields will be blank.
 
5. Enter a name for your data source.
 
 If you want to store the data source in a folder, you can create a folder 
by typing the name in the Display Folder Location field (or click the 
Select Display Folder button to select an existing folder).

169
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
 We named this connection PPSSQLTable and added it to the 
PPSAdventureWorks folder.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your data source properties tab is now open in your workspace, and 
your data source element is added to your Workspace Browser.
 
 Figure 9-7 shows our new data source, PPSSQLTable, in the workspace 
open to the Editor tab.
 
Figure 9-7: 
Making a 
connection 
to your SQL 
Server data 
source.
 
 
7. Select the Use Standard Connection option in the Connection Settings 
section and enter the server name.
 
 As shown in Figure 9-7, we enter the server name server\sql2005.
 
8. Click the Database drop-down arrow to select a database from the 
server you entered in Step 7.
 
 In Figure 9-7, we select AdventureWorksDW.
 
9. Click the Tables drop-down arrow and select the table or view you 
want to use.
 
 In this example, we select dbo.FactSalesQuota.
 
 You might want to test your connection at this point by clicking the Test 
Connection button.
 
10. Publish your item to your PPS server (see Chapter 8 for publishing 
instructions).
 
 Your item is now published to your PPS server and is ready to use for 
reports or filters.

170
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
If you want to use an SQL table or view, it should have all the information you 
want to create the report or filter list that you plan to create from it. Without 
getting into the details of database architecture (you’re welcome), any given 
table will probably have some information you want (like some measures) 
and a bunch of IDs that mean nothing without their associated dimension 
or lookup tables. What you need is a view that joins multiple tables so that 
instead of IDs you get actual dimension values that are meaningful to a busi-
ness user. You need to create or use a “flat” SQL table from your relational 
or dimensional structure. This view of your data should be created in SQL 
Server, not in PerformancePoint.
Creating an Excel 2007 data source
What’s a little bit different about creating an Excel 2007 data source is that you 
are not actually connecting to a spreadsheet and maintaining that connection. 
Rather, you are importing the Excel 2007 data into PerformancePoint’s Excel 
and publishing that data to the PerformancePoint server. So, editing that origi-
nal spreadsheet will have no impact on the data unless you re-import it, but 
you don’t have to re-import the spreadsheet to edit your data (see the section 
“Editing your Excel data set,” later in this chapter).
You can also use the Excel 2007 data source type to enter your own data into 
PerformancePoint’s Excel to use for filters or reports.
And when you publish your data to PerformancePoint server, it is stored 
there in versions just like other data source elements (see Chapter 8.)
Importing data from an existing Excel 2007 workbook
To import Excel 2007 data, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Data Sources element header.
 
 The data source options menu opens, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
2. Select New Data Source from this menu.
 
 The Select a Data Source Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 9-3.
 
3. Select a data source template by choosing the following:
 
• Category: Tabular List
 
• Template: Import from Excel 2007 Workbook 

171
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Create a Data Source dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-4, 
although the Name and Display Folder fields will be blank.
 
5. Enter a name for your data source.
 
 If you want to store the data source in a folder, you can create a folder 
by typing the name in the Display Folder Location field (or click the 
Select Display Folder button to select an existing folder).
 
 We enter PPSExcel2007 as the name of the data source element and 
enter PPSAdventureWorks as the folder name. Alternatively, we can 
click the Select Display Folder button next to the folder entry to find the 
appropriate folder.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your data source properties tab is now open in your workspace, and

Editing your Excel data set
So, perhaps you have imported your Excel data, you view it, and you notice 
something is wrong, or something is missing. What’s great is that you don’t 
have to go back, edit the Excel spreadsheet, and re-import. You can edit your 
imported data right in PerformancePoint.

173
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
IT people are currently cringing at the thought of developers being able to 
manually edit business performance production data, but it’s still pretty darn 
useful if not entirely secure.
To edit your Excel data set, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the Column 
Definitions pane on the View tab.
 
 An instance of Excel 2007 opens, showing your Excel data.
 
 You can see the Edit button in Figure 9-10.
 
2. Edit your data as necessary.
 
 Figure 9-11 shows our Excel data opened into an instance of Excel 2007.
 
Figure 9-11: 
Editing your 
Excel 2007

 In this case, we want to do the following:
 
• Change Chen’s division from US to Taiwan in row 3.
 
• Add another row of data for our new director, Olson, from the 
Midwest Region of the US Division in row 7.
 
 In Figure 9-12, we enter these changes.

 Excel closes, you are back to your Dashboard Designer interface, and 
your changes are saved.
 
 Figure 9-13 shows that our changes have been entered. Chen is now the 
director of the Taiwan Division, and Olson has been added as director of 
the US/Midwest Division/Region.

 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
Creating your own data set in PerformancePoint
If you need to create your own data set for a lookup or just to create some test 
data, you can create a data set right in PerformancePoint using the Excel 2007 
data source type. You can do this by combining the steps for creating an Excel 
2007 data set and editing an Excel 2007 data set, by essentially creating an 
empty data set to which you can manually type in or copy in some data.
To create your own data set in PerformancePoint, follow these steps:
 
1. Follow Steps 1 through 6 from the section “Creating an Excel 2007 
data source,” earlier in this chapter.
 
 When you complete these steps, you will have an Excel data source ele-
ment with no data in it.
 
2. Click the Edit button in the upper-right corner of the Column 
Definitions pane on the View tab.
 
 An instance of Excel 2007 opens, showing your Excel data.
 
 The spreadsheet will be blank because you haven’t imported any data.
 
3. Type or copy some data into your Excel spreadsheet.
 
 Add some headers so that your data has field names (such as Sales 
Amount, Division, and Region, as shown in Figure 9-12), and then insert 
your data under that header row. If you add headers, make sure that the 
Headers On First Row check box in the Edit Data In Excel dialog box is 
selected, as shown in Figure 9-12.
 
4. Click the Accept Changes button.
 
 Excel closes and you are returned to your Dashboard Designer 
workspace.
 
 Now you can see your data on the View tab, as shown in Figure 9-13.
 
5. Publish your data source element (see Chapter 8).
 
 Your data is now stored on the PerformancePoint server.
Creating an Excel Services data source
If your organization has Excel Services installed, this is another great option 
for reading Excel data. Excel Services is a server-based application that 
allows you to display an editable Web version of an Excel 2007 spreadsheet.

176
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
Because Excel Services itself is server based, you are not actually import-
ing the data into PerformancePoint like you do in the preceding section, but 
rather you are connecting to the Excel Services spreadsheet on the Excel 
Services server. So in this case, if you edit the Excel Services spreadsheet, 
your data will change.
 
A nice feature of this method of leveraging Excel data is that you can provide 
a centralized Web-based environment for allowing business users to edit and 
enter Excel data. And this data can be retrieved on a more “real-time” or “run-
time” basis, such as when a report is run or when a cube is processed. This 
method reduces the step of the middleperson (that would be you) in getting 
Excel data into your dashboard environment.
 
To use an Excel Services workbook, you have to name a range in Excel before 
you publish the workbook. Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Data Sources element header.
 
 The data source options menu opens, as shown in Figure 9-2.
 
2. Select New Data Source from this menu.
 
 The Select a Data Source Template dialog box opens, as shown 
in Figure 9-3.
 
3. Select a data source template by choosing the following:
 
• Category: Tabular List
 
• Template: Excel Services
 
 Figure 9-14 shows the selected Excel Services template.
 
Figure 9-14:

 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Create a Data Source dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 9-4, 
although the Name and Display Folder fields will be blank.
 
5. Enter a name for your data source.
 
 If you want to store the data source in a folder, you can create a folder 
by typing the name in the Display Folder Location field (or click the 
Select Display Folder button to select an existing folder).
 
 We enter PPSExcelServices as the name of the data source element and 
enter PPSAdventureWorks as the folder name.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your data source properties tab is now open in your workspace, and 
your data source element is added to your Workspace Browser.
 
 Figure 9-15 shows our new data source, PPSExcelServices, in the work-
space open to the Editor tab. Of course, when you first set up the data 
source, all the connection setting information will be blank.
 
7. Enter the SharePoint Site of your Excel Services workbook.
 
 Figure 9-15 shows the SharePoint site of our Excel Services workbook: 
http://devapp4/projects/dashboardviewer_ppsfd/.
 
8. Click the Document Library drop-down arrow to select the document 
library where your Excel Services workbook is located.
 
 Figure 9-15 shows our document library named Dashboards.
 
Figure 9-15:

Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
9. Click the Excel Workbook drop-down arrow to select the workbook 
from your chosen document library.
 
 Figure 9-15 shows our Excel Workbook named 
PPSExcel2007WorkbookDatav3.xlsx.
 
10. In the Item Name box, enter the range name of the report in your 
Excel workbook.
 
 Figure 9-15 shows the item name Report for our report. We realize that 
you are very impressed with the creativity of our naming conventions.
 
 You can set up a range/item name in Excel 2007 before you publish to 
Excel Services by selecting the cells you want to include in your report, 
right-clicking and selecting Name a Range, and then naming your range. 
The range name is the item name you enter in the previous step.
 
11. Click the Test Connection button in the lower-left corner of the 
Editor tab.
 
 Hopefully, your connection will succeed and a pop-up box that tells 
you so will appear, as shown in Figure 9-15. You can also click the View 
button and look at the Excel Services report.
 
12. Publish your new data source element.
 
 See Chapter 8 for instructions on publishing.
Setting Up Required Data Properties
Now you have your data source set up. But before you move on to setting up 
some of your other elements, you may have to manage some of your proper-
ties. For example:
 
✓ If you want to use an Excel or SQL data source element as a data source 
for a KPI, make sure that you set up your data type properties (see the 
next section in this chapter).
 
✓ If you want to be able to combine multiple data sources into a KPI, 
report, or scorecard and map these sources against each other by time, 
you need to set up time properties (see the section “Defining the time 
dimension to combine data sources across time,” later in this chapter). 
This will come in handy if, for example, you have your actual data in 
Analysis Services and your budget data in an Excel spreadsheet.
 
✓ If you want to use your data source to create filters that use relative 
time (for example, rolling 3 months, month to date, or prior year), you 
need to set up your time properties (see the section “Defining the time 
dimension to combine data sources across time,” later in this chapter).

179
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
✓ If you want to enable other PerformancePoint Dashboard Designer 
developers to edit or even just use the data source you create, you may 
need to add them to set up the proper permissions. More importantly, if 
you want users to be able to view data in their dashboards based on one 
of your data source elements, you have to grant them permissions to do 
so (see the section “Setting your data source element permissions,” later 
in this chapter).
Setting your fact and dimension properties 
on SQL and Excel data sources
When you create an Analysis Services cube, you set fact (that is, measures) 
versus dimension (that is, attribute) properties in the cube itself so that 
PerformancePoint can recognize which fields are facts and which are dimen-
sions. (Go, Analysis Services!)
But this information is not inherent in Excel or SQL. So you have explicitly 
assigned your data source fields as a measure or a dimension. 
To set up your data type properties for an Excel or SQL data source element, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select your data source element from your Workspace Browser, and 
then click the View tab header in your workspace.
 
 The View tab opens.
 
 Figure 9-16 shows the View tab of our Excel Services data source ele-
ment open in the workspace. You can only see field names, but the table 
is currently populated with the value “No Data.” That’s just because we 
haven’t tried to preview the data yet.
 
2. Click the Preview Data button in the upper-right corner of the View tab.
 
 Your data grid should populate with data from your data source.
 
 Figure 9-17 shows our data source element grid populated with data 
from our Excel Services worksheet.
 
 Because a live connection exists between PPS and Excel Services and 
between PPS and SQL tables, barring latency or network issues, if some-
one updates that Excel Services spreadsheet or SQL table and you click 
the Preview Data button again, the data values will change/update.

180
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
3. Click a column.
 
 The column is highlighted in a darker blue. Figure 9-17 shows the Sales 
Amount column selected.
 
Figure 9-16: 
Looking at 
the View 
tab.
 
 
Figure 9-17: 
Setting your

properties.
 

181
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
4. In the Details pane on the right side of the screen, check whether the 
type is correct for the selected column, as follows:
 
• A measure column has the value Fact
 
• A dimension column has the value Dimension
 
• A time dimension column has the value Time Dimension
 
• A table key (like an ID) has the value Key
 
• A field that you don’t want to include has the value Ignore
 
 Figure 9-17 shows that the Sales Amount column type is currently set 
as a dimension. This is not correct, because Sales Amount is actually a 
measure.
 
5. If the value is correct, click another column and repeat Step 4. If not, 
go to Step 6.
 
6. Click Column Type drop-down arrow and select the proper column type.
 
 In this case, we choose Fact, as shown in Figure 9-18.
 
Figure 9-18: 
Setting the 
correct col-
umn type.
 
 
7. For fact column types, select the proper aggregation by clicking the 
Aggregation drop-down arrow.
 
 You see the following list of aggregation types:
 
• Average
 
• Count
 
• Minimum
 
• Statistical Standard Deviation
 
• Sum
 
• Statistical Variance
 
• First Occurrence

182
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
 In this case, we want to be able to add the Sales Amounts together, so 
we choose Sum, as shown in Figure 9-19.
 
 Sum and Count are common aggregation types.
 
8. Complete the column type changes for all columns and publish your 
item.
 
 Now your Excel or SQL data source is ready to use to create KPIs.
 
Figure 9-19: 
Choosing 
an aggrega-
tion type for 
facts.
 
Defining the time dimension to combine 
data sources across time
PerformancePoint has a feature called Time Intelligence that allows you to 
link any or all of your data sources to an internal calendar, a master calendar. 
As we mention earlier in this chapter, this is particularly useful to achieve 
two objectives:
 
✓ To combine multiple data sources into one KPI, scorecard, or report 
and map them together by time (for example, if you have actual data in 
Analysis Services and budget data in Excel)
 
✓ To create filters that use relative time periods
Defining time dimension properties for Excel and SQL data sources
To define time dimension properties in an Excel or SQL data source element, 
make sure that your Time field is defined as a time dimension on the View tab 
of your data source element (see the section “Setting your fact and dimen-
sion properties on SQL and Excel data sources,” earlier in this chapter). 
Then, follow these steps:

183
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
1. Select your data source element from your Workspace Browser and 
then click the Time tab header in your workspace to open the Time tab.
 
 Your Time tab opens.
 
 Figure 9-20 shows our Time tab. In the Time Dimensions section, we 
have one time dimension, called Period, in this data source.
 
 If you do not have any time dimensions listed here, go back to your View 
tab and make sure that you have identified a time dimension.
 
2. Select the check box in the Master column for the time dimension that 
you want to use as the primary time dimension, that is, the one that 
will potentially map to another data source.
 
 In this case, we only have one time dimension, although it is very 
common to have many dates associated with your data. We select 
Period as the master time dimension, as shown in Figure 9-21.
 
Figure 9-20: 
Viewing the 
Time tab in 
your work-
space.
 
 
Figure 9-21: 
Setting up 
the time 
properties.
 

184
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
3. Select the time period levels to which you want PPS to aggregate.
 
 If your data is being stored at the month level and you want it to be 
summarized only at the quarter, semester, and year, select Quarter, 
Semester, and Year.
 
 In this case, our data is stored at the quarterly level, and we want PPS to 
aggregate at the quarter, semester, and year, as shown in Figure 9-21.
 
4. Publish your item (see Chapter 8 for more information on publishing).
Defining time dimension properties for Analysis Services data sources
What’s nice about setting up the time dimension properties for Analysis 
Services is that PPS already knows which dimensions are dates — that’s all 
set up in Analysis Services itself. You just need to give PPS a couple of other 
pieces of information. To set the time properties for an Analysis Services 
data source, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your data source element from your Workspace Browser, and 
then click the Time tab header for your Analysis Services data source.
 
 Your Time tab opens in your workspace. The Time tab for Analysis 
Services is shown in Figure 9-22.
 
2. Select the time dimension you want to use as your master time 
dimension by clicking the Time Dimension drop-down arrow in the 
Reference Data Mapping section of your workspace.
 
 We select Date.Date.Calendar.
 
Figure 9-22: 
Setting up 
the time 
properties.
 

185
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
 
3. Select a reference member (date value) by clicking the Browse button 
next to the Member box and choosing a dimension member value at 
the lowest level of granularity that you have.
 
 Our lowest level of granularity for this time dimension is a day, so we 
choose a day: July 1, 2001. The actual date you choose is not relevant; 
what’s important is the level at which you select it.
 
4. Select the appropriate hierarchy level or level of the date hierarchy 
that value represents (that is, Day, Month, Quarter, Semester, or Year).
 
 In our example, we have daily data. You may have only monthly data, 
but the date is still stored as a day.
 
 In this example, we select Day as the hierarchy level, but if your date 
represents a month or quarter (that is, it is the month end date or the 
quarter end date), choose Month or Quarter as the appropriate hierar-
chy level. In Figure 9-23, we select the member July 2001 with a hierar-
chy level of Month.
 
5. Enter a date in the Reference Date section that is equal to the period 
you specify in Step 4.
 
 We enter July 1, 2001 (our server is UK based, so the date is in dd/mm/
yyyy format; U.S.-based servers will follow standard U.S. date formatting, 
or mm/dd/yyyy). If you are specifying the reference member at a month 
or quarter, for month use the month end date and for quarter use the 
quarter end date.
 
Figure 9-23: 
Looking at 
monthly 
versus 
daily time 
settings.
 

186
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
6. Map the member level values to time aggregations in the Time 
Member Associations frame using the Time Aggregation drop-down 
arrows.
 
 Map your year attribute name to Year, your semester attribute name to 
Semester, and so on.
 
 In Figure 9-22, we map Calendar Year to Year, Calendar Semester to 
Semester, Calendar Quarter to Quarter, Month to Month, and Date to Day.
 
 Figure 9-23 shows the same time dimension, mapped only to the month 
level. In the Time Member Associations section, Date and Day are grayed 
out and disabled. Because we selected a month hierarchy level, we 
cannot define associations at a lower level of granularity.
Setting your data source 
element permissions
Setting your data source element permissions allows different users to read 
and/or edit your data source element and have access to the data it connects 
to. Roles include the following:
 
✓ Reader: Has access to read or use data source elements. This should 
include report and dashboard users.
 
✓ Editor: Has access to edit or delete data source elements.
Editor or reader access to a data source (or any other element for that 
matter) works together with PerformancePoint Server roles. These PPS roles 
include the following:
 
✓ Administrator: Has access to create, read, edit, or delete everything, 
regardless of whether you add the user as an editor or reader, or even if 
you do not assign the user to a role.
 
✓ Data source manager: Has access to create, read, edit, or delete all data 
sources, regardless of whether you add the user as an editor or reader, 
or even if you do not assign the user to a role.
 
✓ Creator: Has access to create KPIs, indicators, scorecards, reports, and 
dashboards, but not data sources. A creator can edit a data source if he 
is named as an editor on the data source.
 
✓ Power reader: Has read-only access to all data elements, whether or not 
the reader is named as an editor on the data source.

187
 Chapter 9: Making the Connection to Your Business Data
There are two rules for ensuring proper access to users who are not 
administrators or data source managers:
 
✓ If you want users who are not administrators or data source managers 
to be able to edit your data source element, make sure that they have 
the creator PPS role and grant them editor access as described in the 
following steps.
 
✓ If you want users who are not administrators or data source managers 
to be able to read the data source element or access data that the data 
source element connects to, make sure that the user has the creator or 
power reader PPS role and grant the user reader access as described in 
the following steps.
 
PerformancePoint role access needs to be granted by your PPS server admin-
istrator (which might be you), whereas you (yes, you) can grant reader or 
editor access. To provide reader or editor access for your data source ele-
ment, follow these steps:
 
1. Select your data source element from your Workspace Browser and 
then click the Properties tab header of your selected data source.
 
 Your Properties tab opens in your workspace. Figure 9-24 shows our 
Properties tab.
 
 In the Permissions frame, the creator of the data source element, in this 
case BI\rblum, is by default listed as the first user and given the editor 
role.
 
2. Click the New Permission button in the Permissions frame to add a 
new user.
 
 A blank line item appears under your first username.
 
3. Enter the name of the new user or group as it is named in your 
security directory.
 
 In Figure 9-24, we enter BI/DashboardDevelopers and BI/
DashboardAuthenticatedUsers.
 
 Unfortunately you can’t browse or check names against your security 
directory (that is, Active Directory), but if you get the name wrong or it 
doesn’t exist in the directory, PPS opens a dialog box that tells you so. 
You may have to go to your help desk or IT department to figure out 
exactly what users or groups to enter here.

188
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
4. Using the Role drop-down arrow, choose Reader or Editor for the 
selected user.
 
 In Figure 9-24, we assign the dashboard developers an editor role and 
dashboard authenticated users a reader role.

Chapter 10
Picturing Your Business 
Performance with Indicators
In This Chapter
▶ Finding out how to set up the graphics that indicate your business performance
▶ Discovering how to create and use your own graphical indicators
B
usiness users love graphic indicators. They are the bells and whistles 
of dashboards and scorecards. Indicators grab your attention and draw 
your focus to issues with your business performance, and they do so in a col-
orful and enticing way.
So when our boss tells us to enhance a sales presentation, to “make it sexier” 
(yes, he actually says that), he doesn’t mean that we should wear tighter 
pants (well, maybe he does). What he means is that he wants to see more 
graphics, more colors — he wants more indicators.
But indicators, while quite lovely, are not just glitz and glamour. They can tell 
you at a glance how your business is performing against goals and over time. 
You need an indicator to build a KPI, and you need a KPI to create a scorecard.
PerformancePoint has many fine indicator graphics to choose from, as you 
soon see. If you want to get creative, you can set up your own graphics. If you 
are vain, you can even set up a graphic with pictures of yourself.
A successful indicator represents the following items at a glance:
 
✓ The nature of the variance between your actual and target measures 
and KPIs: The graphic tells you whether it’s a good variance, a bad vari-
ance, or not quite good or bad (borderline). The built-in indicator graph-
ics usually come in sets of two (good and bad), three (good, bad, and 
borderline), or more.
 
✓ How close an actual measure is to its target: The graphic shows the 
progress and completion level of a measure to its target, usually in four 
levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) or over a range of gradients.

190
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
✓ Trends of your measures and KPIs between time periods: The graphic 
tells you how a measure or KPI has changed from a prior period.
The thresholds that associate a graphic with a measure or KPI are set when 
you create a KPI element. For more information on how thresholds are set, 
see Chapter 11.
Viewing and Opening Your 
Existing Indicators
To be able to use an indicator element for a KPI element, the indicator ele-
ment needs to be published on PerformancePoint Server. But you may 
already have a number of indicators published to your server, whether you 
or another developer set them up.
To view and open an existing indicator element from your server to your 
workspace, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the indicator element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 If you don’t see any indicators in your workspace, make sure that you’ve 
refreshed from your server (see Chapter 8).
 
 All the indicators on your PPS server appear in your workspace, as 
shown in Figure 10-1.
 
Figure 10-1: 
Viewing the 
indicators

on your 
Perfor-
mance

191
 Chapter 10: Picturing Your Business Performance with Indicators
 
2. Double-click the indicator row in your workspace that you want to 
open in the workspace (or click the indicator row and click the Open 
Items icon on the Home toolbar).
 
 Your indicator now opens in your workspace and is added to your 
Workspace Browser.
 
 You can open multiple indicators or folders of indicators to your work-
space at a time by holding down Ctrl as you click indicator rows in your 
workspace. Then click the Open Items icon on your Home toolbar.
Creating a New Indicator Element 
from Existing Indicator Graphics
If you don’t see the indicator type that you want on your PerformancePoint 
server, you have to create it. Now, this doesn’t mean that you have to create 
the graphic itself, it just means that you need to set up the existing graphic as 
an indicator element.
Types of graphics you can choose include those that show the following:
 
✓ Performance against a goal (that is, good, bad, or borderline): These 
could (and typically would) be used for displaying the variance of actual 
to budget data, like the variance between a quarterly sales amount and 
the quarterly sales quota. Indicator styles that show performance against 
goal include the following (with category header in parentheses):
 
• Stoplights (Centered and Standard categories — see Figure 10-2)
 
• Thermometers (Centered and Standard categories — see Figure 10-3)
 
• Smiley faces (Centered and Standard categories — see Figure 10-4)

These could be used to track a daily or monthly actual against a quarterly 
or project goal, such as if you wanted to track a quarterly sales amount 
against the annual sales quota, or if you wanted to track current project 
costs against the project budget. Indicator styles that show progress 
toward a goal include the following:
 
• Gauges (Centered and Standard categories — see Figure 10-9)
 
• Quarters (Centered and Standard categories — see Figure 10-10)
 
• Progress bars (Centered and Standard categories — see Figure 10-11)
 
✓ Trending or direction to a target (that is, going up, going down, stay-
ing the same, and so on): These could be used to display a change in 
a KPI value from a prior time period. The indicator style that shows 
direction to a target is trends (Centered and Standard categories — see 
Figure 10-12).

The other major distinction between graphics is that they fall under both a 
standard and centered categorization:
 
✓ Standard categories: Higher or extreme levels show better performance. 
This would be true of any indicator (and hence, KPI) where higher 
(or lower) is better. For example:
 
• Sales amount (the higher the better)
 
• Gross profit margin (the higher the better)
 
• Losses (the lower the better)
 
✓ Centered categories: Centered levels show better performance. This 
would be true of any indicator (and hence, KPI) where you want the 
actual value to stay close to the target plus or minus a margin, but 
extremes are not good. For example:
 
• Utilization rates (too low and you’ve overstaffed; too high and 
you’ve understaffed)
 
• Hit ratios (too low and you’re not finding enough business; too 
high and you may not be prepared for the workflow)
To create an indicator element, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the indicator element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 An options menu opens.
 
 The indicator options menu is shown in Figure 10-13.
 
2. Choose New Indicator.
 
 Your indicator dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-14.
 
3. In the Category section on the left side of the dialog box, click a 
category type.

196
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
 The templates that fall into that category will appear in the Template 
frame in the upper-right corner of the dialog box.
 
 We select the Thermometer category under the Standard category 
header, and our selection of thermometers is shown in Figure 10-15. To 
view a description of the indicator template, we click the template in the 
Template frame and can see a description in the lower-right frame of the 
dialog box. In this case, we’ve chosen the Cylinder template from the 
Standard Thermometer section (which is highlighted).

4. Click the OK button.
 
 A new indicator element is added to the Indicators section in your 
Workspace Browser, and the indicator element opens in your workspace.
 
 Figure 10-16 shows that a new cylinder indicator has been added to our 
workspace.
 
5. Publish your indicator (see Chapter 8).
 
 At this point, you don’t need to do anything else if you’re happy with the 
properties (display names, images, and background colors) of the indicator.

Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
Before you start changing properties of the KPIs, look at the Details frame on 
the right side of your Dashboard Designer window (as shown in Figure 10-16). 
Here you can see all the KPIs and scorecards that your indicator is currently 
associated with. Now, how can this happen because you just created it? Well, 
maybe you didn’t just create it; someone else may have already set up this 
indicator and published it to the server. To create your own unique instance 
of the indicator, you have to copy and paste it.
To create your own instance of an indicator, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the indicator in your Workspace Browser.
 
 An indicator options menu opens. We right-click Cylinder.
 
2. Choose Copy.
 
 The menu closes.
 
3. Right-click the folder you want to put the indicator in.
 
 An indicator options menu opens. We right-click the Thermometer 
header under Indicators➪Standard.
 
4. Choose Paste.
 
 Your indicator is pasted as Copy of [IndicatorName].
 
 Figure 10-17 shows our Copy of Cylinder indicator added to the 
Thermometer folder in our Workspace Browser. Looking at the Details 
frame, we can see that no KPIs or scorecard elements are currently asso-
ciated with this indicator.
However, you have so many great indicator options to choose from, so 
there’s probably not too much value in editing the graphics or properties of 
an existing indicator element. You can, however, create a new indicator if, for 
example, you have some graphics you want to use (see the section “Getting 
Creative with Your Own Indicator Graphics,” later in this chapter).

 Chapter 10: Picturing Your Business Performance with Indicators
Setting Security and Permissions 
on Your Indicator
Just like with every other element, you need to make sure that the right users 
can read and/or edit this indicator. Permissions work the same for an indica-
tor as they do for a data source — and all the other elements for that matter. 
For more information on setting up permissions, see the section in Chapter 9 
on permissions and security.
Getting Creative with Your 
Own Indicator Graphics
Even though you have so many great and communicative graphics to choose 
from in PerformancePoint, you may have graphics that are more meaning-
ful to your organization or that you have already developed. Beyond just 
using the indicator graphics that are built into PPS, you can create your own 
custom indicators using graphics that you create or already have. For exam-
ple, we think some pictures of our CEO with a thumbs up and thumbs down 
would make a superb indicator.
To create your own custom indicator, you need to have graphics available on 
a server connected to your Dashboard Designer. The graphics can be in the 
following file formats: .bmp, .jpg, .gif, and .png. They can be up to 250 
pixels by 250 pixels, but the image will be very large on your screen. It would 
better to shrink your image to about 50 by 50 pixels or less. To match the 
size of other indicator graphics, 25 by 25 pixels is optimal.
To create your custom indicator, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the indicator element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 The indicator options menu opens, as shown previously in Figure 10-13.
 
2. Select New Indicator.
 
 The indicator dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-14.
 
3. Choose Blank Indicator in the Category frame of your dialog box.
 
 You see a blank indicator template, as shown in Figure 10-18.

4. Click the OK button.
 
 The Create New Indicator dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-19.
 
5. Enter the name and folder of your new indicator.
 
 We enter AllThumbs as the name of the indicator and 
PPSAdventureWorks in the folder name, as shown in Figure 10-19.
 
6. Click the Next button.
 
 Your indicator type page opens in the dialog box, as shown in Figure 10-20.
 
7. Select Standard or Centered as your indicator type.
 
 We select Standard because bigger is often better.

 This value should be equal to the number of graphics that you have.
 
 We have two graphics, one thumbs up and one thumbs down. So we 
select 2, as shown in Figure 10-20.
 
9. Click the Finish button.
 
 The indicator is added to your Workspace Browser, and it opens in your 
workspace.
 
10. Click the Editor tab.
 
 The Editor page opens in your Workspace Browser, as shown in 
Figure 10-21.

11. Double-click the image cell of your first level.
 
 A dialog box opens, allowing you to select a graphic from a local or net-
work folder.
 
 Figure 10-21 shows the image cell of our Level 1 (Worst) level high-
lighted. When we double-click the little box with the red line through it, 
the Open File dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 10-22.
 
Figure 10-22: 
Picking your

 Alternatively, we have some toolbar options on the Edit tab, also shown 
in Figure 10-21. We can choose one of the standard indicator graphics, 
select one from a picture file (which is the same as double-clicking), or 
default to the original graphic (which in this case would be no graphic).
 
 This is the same method you would use to change the graphic on an 
existing indicator element, or to add a graphic for the No Data levels, 
which often have no default graphic.
 
12. Select your graphic and click the Open button.
 
 Your graphic is now added to your workspace in the selected cell.
 
 We select ThumbsDown.bmp, because we are picking the graphic for the 
worst level. The thumbs-down graphic is now added to our indicator 
workspace, as shown in Figure 10-23.
 
 The size of the graphic on your screen is the size of the graphic in your 
scorecard. This one is 50 by 50 pixels and is still larger than the standard 
graphics. If you want the sizes to match, shrink your image to about 25 by 
25 pixels.

Okay, you are now finished with indicators — halfway to a KPI and one-
quarter of the way to a dashboard. Quiz: Which indicator should we use to 
measure our progress? Answer: Gauges, quarters, or progress bars would 
be fine, because they would show progress toward our goal of creating a 
PerformancePoint dashboard.

Chapter 11
Showing Your Company’s 
Most Important Measures: Key 
Performance Indicators (KPIs)
In This Chapter
▶ Creating key performance indicators to put into your scorecards
▶ Pointing to the actual and target measures that your KPI element will compare
▶ Setting the targets and thresholds that generate the score of the KPI element
▶ Rolling your KPIs into groups called objectives
A
 key performance indicator element, or KPI element, is not a key per-
formance indicator as you know it. A key performance indicator from a 
business (that is, your) perspective is a measure that is at least partially rep-
resentative of how well or poorly an aspect of your business is performing. 
However, a KPI element is a combination of the following items:
 
✓ An actual measure
 
✓ A target measure
 
✓ A method for comparing actual to target
 
✓ Thresholds for assigning values of good and bad and anything in 
between
 
✓ An indicator element that visualizes these thresholds
When you create a KPI element, you are creating a component with defined 
business rules that can be displayed along with other KPI elements on your 
dashboards through a scorecard.

206
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
Assembling the Items You Need 
for Your KPI Element
You already have the following items that you need to assemble the KPI element:
 
✓ An actual measure and a target measure from one or more defined data 
sources, such as the one you set up in Chapter 9. The actual and target 
measures can come from different data sources.
 
✓ A published indicator element (such as the one you set up in Chapter 10) 
that you want to use for this particular KPI element.
Next, you have to identify the correct method for comparing your actual to 
target measure. You need to set the scoring pattern, banding method, and 
thresholds.
When bigger isn’t always better: 
Setting the scoring pattern
Scoring pattern is where you assign the direction you would optimally want 
your KPI to go. Consider the following directions:
 
✓ Increasing is better: You want the value to be high, and even higher 
than the target would be fine. You would use this for a measure like 
sales amount (the higher the better) with a Standard indicator.
 
 Standard indicators value high or low extremes, whereas Centered indi-
cators value low variance from the target. See Chapter 10 for informa-
tion on Standard versus Centered indicators.
 
✓ Decreasing is better: You want the value to be low, and even lower 
than the target would be fine. You would use this for a measure like loss 
amount (the lower the better) with a Standard indicator.
 
✓ Closer to the target is better: You want the value to hover around the 
target. You would use this for a measure like utilization (not too high 
and not too low, but just right) with a Centered indicator.
Evening the score with a banding method
The banding method is where you assign the calculation you will use to 
compare your actual number to a target number. You have to choose the 

207
 Chapter 11: Showing Your Company’s Most Important Measures
right method so that you can appropriately set the good, bad, and borderline 
bands, or thresholds, around the calculation result. You have to know the 
range of values to set the right bands around them. Your options are as follows:
 
✓ Band by normalized value of actual to target: This is an appropriate 
method for comparing the actuals and targets of continuous measures like 
amounts or counts. This method creates a normalized range (0% to n%) for 
the KPI using this calculation:
 
 (Actual value – Worst value) / (Target value – Worst value)
 
 Consider a scenario where your KPI is sales amount, and your worst 
value is 0. A zero sales amount would be very bad.
 
 Division A has an actual value of $10,000 and a target value of $20,000; 
the normalized value for Division A is
 
 (10,000 – 0) / (20,000 – 0) = 50%
 
 If Division B has an actual value of $2,000,000 and a target of $8,000,000, 
even though its actual value is much higher than that of Division A, if 
you normalize Division B’s value, you can see that Division A performed 
better because Division B has the following normalized value:
 
 (2,000,000 – 0) / (8,000,000 – 0) = 25%
 
 In this example, 0 is the worst value, but the worst value is included in 
the algorithm, of course, in case 0 is not the worst value. For example, 
you used to get 400 points on your SAT test just for showing up.
 
 This normalized method creates a normalized score — a ratio — so that 
you can compare scores across attributes.
 
✓ Band by numeric value of actual: You can use this method for ratios, 
which are by nature normalized with values like –1 to 1 or 0 to 1. This 
method would be great for something like a gross profit margin or loss 
ratio, any value that is essentially already normalized because it is a ratio.
 
✓ Band by stated score: You can use this method if you have already 
scored the variance between actual and target and that score is stored 
in a field in a data source. Because this is not nearly as likely a scenario 
as the other two options (but would be extremely impressive), we don’t 
go into further explanation for this option.
 
 We highly recommend using a normalized method, to be able to associate 
KPI scores correctly when you get to creating a scorecard and unless you 
have developed your own KPI scoring algorithms, methods, and rules.

208
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
Setting the endpoints of your 
bands with thresholds
Finally, you have to determine what thresholds you will use to assign a value to 
the comparison you previously defined. Thresholds are the endpoints of your 
bands, where you determine which values to assign to which graphic indicator. 
In PerformancePoint, three-level, standard, normalized KPIs (like stoplights) 
default to a range of 0% to >120% with bands, as shown in Figure 11-1, as follows:
 
✓ 0% to <50%: Bad (red)
 
✓ 50% to <100%: Borderline (yellow)
 
✓ 100+%: Good (green)
This means that Division A at 50% would have a yellow stoplight, and 
Division B at 25% would have a red stoplight.

Visualizing Your Company’s KPIs
Two common scenarios that you will encounter when assembling KPIs are 
those that deal in amounts (like sales amount) and those that deal in ratios 
(like gross profit margin). In our first example, we will create a KPI for sales 
amount using the concepts reviewed previously.
Steps will include the following:
 
1. Creating your KPI element
 
2. Adding additional targets to your KPI element
 
3. Pointing actuals and targets to their correct data source through data 
mappings

209
 Chapter 11: Showing Your Company’s Most Important Measures
 
4. Formatting how the actual and target numbers appear
 
5. Setting a scoring pattern and choosing an indicator element for your KPI 
element
A lot of steps are involved because this is probably one of the more complex 
elements to assemble. You might want to get a cup of coffee before you start. 
Or a doughnut. At least a cookie.
Creating KPIs for amount measures
To create a KPI element for an amount measure, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click your KPI element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 Your KPI element options menu opens, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
2. Choose New KPI.
 
 The Select a KPI Template dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-3.

3. Select Blank KPI and click the OK button.
 
 The Create a KPI dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-4.
 
4. Enter the name of your KPI in the name field and, optionally, enter a 
folder for the KPI.
 
 We enter the name SalesAmountKPI and add it to folder 
PPSAdventureWorks.
 
5. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your new KPI is created, added to your Workspace Browser, and opened 
in your workspace.
 
 Figure 11-5 shows our new KPI, SalesAmountKPI, open to the Editor page 
in our workspace.
 
 You can see two items under Actual and Targets, namely, an actual and 
a target measure. A number of properties need to be edited, including 
number format, thresholds, data mapping, and calculation, but first, we 
would like to add one additional target for a prior year.
 
6. Click the New Target button at the top of the Actual and Targets frame 
in your workspace to add a new target to your KPI element.
 
 A new row is added in the Actual and Targets frame. You can keep the 
name or change it to something more applicable by clicking the name 
and typing the new one.

Figure 11-5: 
Editing your

 Figure 11-6 shows that a new row has been added to our target frame. 
By default, the new target was named Target(1). Because we plan to 
use prior year sales amount data as a comparative value to our actual, 
we rename the new target to Prior Year. For Target, we plan to use the 
sales amount quota established in our data source.

7. Click the Data Mappings cell for the Actual row.
 
 The current value is 1 (Fixed values). The Fixed Values Data Source 
Mapping dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-7.
 
 The data source for our sales amount is not a fixed value; it is located 
in our AdventureWorksPPS data source. So we must now change the 
source of the data.
 
Figure 11-7: 
The dialog 
box opens. 
 
8. Click Change Source button at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 The Select a Data Source dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-8. You 
can see two tabs in the dialog box that shows the data source elements: 
Workspace and Server.

9. Click the data source that you want from the Workspace or Server tab, 
and click the OK button.
 
 We choose AdventureWorksPPSfD on the Workspace tab and click the 
OK button. The Dimensional Data Source Mapping dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 11-9.
 
Figure 11-9: 
Setting your

10. Click the down arrow in the Select A Measure drop-down box and 
select the measure you want to use for your actual; then click the OK 
button (see Figure 11-10).
 
 We select Sales Amount from the drop-down list.
 
 You can also filter your KPI by a cube dimension here, for example, if you 
wanted a territory- or department-specific KPI. To do so, click the Select 
Members icon directly under the Select A Dimension header. Select the 
dimension attribute you want and click the OK button. Click the cell under 
Default next to your new attribute and select the value(s) you want to 
filter by. But note that you can slice your KPIs by dimensions later as well.
 
11. Repeat Steps 7 through 10 for all measures that are sourced from a 
data source element.
 
 We repeat Steps 7 through 10 to add a data mapping for our target (Sales 
Amount Quota) and for the prior year (PriorYearSalesAmount). The 
result of our data mappings is shown in Figure 11-11.

Calculation column.
 
 A Calculation dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-12.

215
 Chapter 11: Showing Your Company’s Most Important Measures
 
 Pay special attention to those that say “No Value.” When you create 
a KPI element, existing actual and target calculation fields default to 
Default (which is Source Data). But when you add a new target (like we 
added Prior Year), it defaults to No Value. 
 
 Figure 11-11 shows that our Prior Year target has a calculation of No 
Value. To change that, we click that cell in the Calculation column.
 
13. Select the calculation type you want for that measure, usually Default, 
make sure that the Use Calculated Values Of Actual And Target To 
Compute Score check box is selected, and click the OK button.
 
 Figure 11-12 shows the Calculation dialog box.
 
 We select Default as the calculation type.
 
Figure 11-12: 
Fixing the 
No Value 
calculation 
type.
 
 
 Default provides a normalized weighted scoring method for your KPIs. 
Other options (Source Data, Average of Children, Sum of Children, Max 
Of Children, or Min Of Children) allow you to specify a non-normalized 
calculation method for determining your KPI score. Because we recom-
mend using normalization methods, use Default unless you have score-
carding requirements that can’t be met using normalization techniques.
 
14. Click a Thresholds cell for a chosen measure and click the Set Scoring 
Pattern And Indicator button.
 
 The Thresholds cell for Target is highlighted in Figure 11-6. When we 
click the Set Scoring Pattern And Indicator button, we are presented 
with the Edit Banding Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 11-13, and we 
can now change or accept the scoring pattern shown.

15. Use the Scoring Pattern and Banding Method drop-down boxes to 
view or change your options.
 
 Descriptions of your choices are presented within the dialog box, as 
shown in Figure 11-13.
 
 For Sales Amount, the current scoring pattern — Increasing Is Better — 
is correct, and we want to band by the normalized value of actual/target. 
So we click the Next button. If our measure were something like Losses, 
we would want to change Increasing Is Better to Decreasing Is Better. 
You can see some examples of this earlier in this chapter.
 
16. Click the Next button.
 
17. Select an indicator element and click the Next button.
 
 We retain the stoplight indicator, but as you can see in Figure 11-14, we 
can choose from any indicator element that is in our workspace.

217
 Chapter 11: Showing Your Company’s Most Important Measures
 
18. In the Enter Worst Value box, enter the worst amount for this measure 
and click the Finish button.
 
 This worst value is usually 0.
 
 The worst sales amount we can have is no sales, or 0, so we enter 0 in 
the Enter Worst Value box, as shown in Figure 11-15, and then click the 
Finish button.
 
Figure 11-15: 
Entering the 
worst value.
 
 
 If we were using a measure like gross margin (which we do in the next 
section), we could certainly have negative numbers — and having a 
negative gross margin is worse than earning no margin. So if this were 
Gross Margin, we would enter –1 in the Enter Worst Value box. Entering 
the worst value helps PPS normalize the various KPI scores, aligning a 
KPI with a worst of 0 with a KPI with a worst of –1.
 
19. Set the Scoring Pattern and Indicator settings for all target measures 
by repeating Steps 14 through 18 until you are done.
 
 We have one additional target measure to set — Prior Year.
 
 We use the same settings as we used for Target, but because we are 
trending, we want arrows, so we select the Up Trend B - Medium indica-
tor, as shown in Figure 11-14.
 
20. Change the percentage values in the threshold boxes in the 
Thresholds pane to associate an indicator graphic/value (red/bad, 
green/good, yellow/borderline) with a range of KPI values.
 
 If you don’t have any prior business rules on this, you can keep the 
default. The default ranges are shown in Figure 11-6:
 
• 0% to less than 50% is red, or bad.
 
• 50% to 100% is yellow, or borderline.
 
• >100% is green, or good.

218

 For Sales Amount, though, 90% of goal would be considered good, so we 
enter 90% into Threshold 2, as shown in Figure 11-16. Now, if the sales 
amount is within 90% of goal, the indicator will be green.
 
 To show trending, use the following method for assigning thresholds.
 
 For the Prior Year target, we want to show the following:
 
• A green up arrow only when the Actual value is higher than the 
Prior Year value. This equals a threshold of greater than 100%.
 
• The yellow side arrow when Actual value equals Prior Year value. 
This equals a threshold of only 100%.
 
• A red down arrow whenever Actual value is lower than the Prior 
Year value. This equals a threshold of 0% to less than 100%.
 
 We set the Prior Year thresholds as follows:
 
• Worst = 0%
 
• Threshold 1 = 100%
 
• Threshold 2 = 100%
 
• Best = 120%
 
Figure 11-16: 
Changing 
indicator 
ranges with 
thresholds.
 
 
 As shown in Figure 11-17, we will now have the following:
 
• A red down arrow when the Actual/Prior Year is less than 100%, 
that is, anytime Actual is less than Prior Year
 
• A yellow side arrow when the Actual/Prior Year equals 100%, that 
is, anytime Actual equals Prior Year
 
• A green up arrow when the Actual/Prior Year is greater than 100%, 
that is, whenever Actual is greater than Prior Year

Creating KPIs for ratio measures
The method for creating a KPI for a ratio measure is similar to that for creat-
ing any other KPI. Start by following Steps 1 through 13 from the previous 
section. The difference comes with setting scoring and pattern indicators.
 
1. Follow Steps 1–13 from the previous section.
 
 We begin this example from the point of having a KPI with an actual and 
a target set up, but not having set up the scoring pattern or thresholds, 
as shown in Figure 11-18.
 
 Because gross profit margin is a ratio, we can use a fixed value (of 1, or 
100%) as the target value, as shown in Figure 11-18. We are essentially 
providing a normalized target for a normalized KPI.
 
Figure 11-18: 
Setting 
scoring 
patterns for 
a ratio 
measure.

Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
2. Click the Set Scoring Pattern and Indicator button.
 
 The Edit Banding Settings dialog box opens, as shown previously in 
Figure 11-13.
 
3. Change the banding method to Band by Numeric Value of Actual (see 
Figure 11-19).
 
 Because a ratio is already normalized, you don’t need to normalize it fur-
ther like you do with counts and amounts.
 
Figure 11-19: 
Changing 
the banding 
method for a 
ratio KPI.
 
 
4. Click the Next button.
 
5. Select the indicator element you want or keep the one already 
assigned, and click the Next button.
 
 We keep the stoplight indicator.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
7. Adjust the scoring pattern to a range of –1 to 1 or 0 to 1.
 
 In this case, gross profit margin could certainly be negative, so we 
assign thresholds on a scale of –1 to 1, as shown in Figure 11-20:
 
• Worst = –1. Any gross profit margin that is less than 0 is consid-
ered bad and will get a red stoplight.
 
• Threshold 1 = 0. Any gross profit margin that is between 0 and 50% 
is considered borderline and will get a yellow stoplight.
 
• Threshold 2 = 0.5. Any gross profit margin that is greater than 50% 
will be considered good and will get a green stoplight.
 
• Best = 1. This value doesn’t have any bearing on indicators but 
does help PPS normalize the KPI scores against other KPIs.
 
8. Publish your KPI.

Rolling your KPIs into 
groups with objectives
From a business perspective, objectives are the key strategic areas that you 
want to measure. Technically implemented in PPS, objectives are a rollup 
of a set of KPIs. You may have defined your own objectives or leveraged the 
Balanced Scorecard methodology to define these strategic groups.
The Balanced Scorecard methodology provides four objectives, called 
perspectives: the Financial, the Internal Business, the Customer, and the 
Learning and Growth perspectives. So, for example, all financial KPIs roll up 
to a Financial objective, which is scored based on the rollup of the individual 
KPI scores.
You don’t need objectives to create a scorecard. KPIs are fine to stand alone, 
alongside each other, without any additional organization. But if you have 
objectives, here’s how you use them:
 
1. Right-click the KPI element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 The KPI options menu opens, as shown in Figure 11-2.
 
2. Select New KPI.
 
 The Select a KPI Template dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
3. Choose Objective and click the OK button.
 
 The Create a KPI dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 11-4.

222
Par t III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
4. Name your KPI and enter a display folder if you want; then click the 
Finish button.
 
 We name the KPI Sales Objective, add it to the PPSAdventureWorks 
folder, and click the Finish button.
 
 You can set your thresholds as you would for a normalized band, 
assuming a range of 0 to over 100%, or you can keep the defaults. You 
can also change the target indicator graphics if you want and/or you can 
add a new target. See the section “Creating KPIs for amount measures,” 
earlier in this chapter, for information on how to perform these tasks.
PPS takes it from here, combining the subset of KPI scores into an overall 
objective score. You can see more about how this works when you build your 
first scorecard element in Chapter 12.
 
The same property setting methods that apply to the data source and indica-
tor elements apply here as well. Refer to Chapter 9 for more information on 
setting security.

Performance: Assembling Your 
KPIs with a Scorecard
In This Chapter

▶ Adding rows, columns, and dimensions
▶ Organizing your KPIs and setting objectives
▶ Formatting for the right look and feel
A
re you tired of digging around that opus of a management report on 
your desk to find the measures that indicate how well your business 
is performing, only to find out too late that something is wrong? Too often 
companies don’t know how their business is performing in a timely enough 
fashion to address issues and take corrective actions. Businesses need 
quantifiable data delivered quickly, efficiently, and in a highly communicative 
way, to alert decision makers and managers to issues when they happen so 
that they can address them when they need to.
Scorecards are the foundation of business performance monitoring. They 
provide an easy-to-read graphical and numeric representation of how key 
performance indicators (KPIs) are performing against budgeted goals. In 
doing so, issues become highly visible to business users on an as-needed 
basis.
Scorecards enable you to assemble the KPIs and objectives you built in 
Chapter 11 into a cohesive and holistic business performance report that 
you can publish to your dashboard and view anytime you want. It gets 
updated as often as your data source gets updated. So, you’ve already 
completed the hard part — building the KPI — now it’s just assembly time.

224
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Assembling a Scorecard from KPIs 
and Data Source Elements
Even though a scorecard is set of assembled KPI elements, and KPI elements 
already have data sources, you still have to choose a data source for your 
scorecard. This is because scorecards also provide the ability to slice and/or 
filter by associated dimensions.
For example, if you have a KPI element that’s based on an Analysis Services 
data source, and you choose an Analysis Services–based scorecard element, 
you can slice or filter the KPI by any associated dimension or attribute in 
the cube.
If you created a KPI that uses different data source types, like an Analysis 
Services data source for Actual and Excel 2007 for Budget, as long as the 
Excel data has the same dimension attribute names as your cube, you can 
slice and dice from an Analysis Services–based scorecard.
 
If your disparate KPI element data sources don’t share some of the same 
dimensional attribute names, you can still join them into a scorecard element, 
but you can’t leverage the feature that allows you to add dimensions to the 
scorecard because the dimensions will not apply to all KPIs.
You can select from (but aren’t limited to) the following scorecard templates:
 
✓ Analysis Services
 
✓ Excel 2007
 
✓ SQL Tabular
 
✓ Excel Services
Because you set up dimensionality in your tabular (Excel and SQL) data 
source elements (that is, you specified which fields are dimensions and 
which are measures), the setup of a multidimensional and tabular scorecard 
is the same and acts the same. This example uses Analysis Services.
Follow these steps to create a scorecard element:
 
1. Right-click the Scorecard element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 The Scorecard options menu opens, as shown in Figure 12-1.
 
2. Choose New Scorecard.
 
 The Select A Scorecard Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 12-2.

9. Click the Next button.
 
 The Add Measure Filters dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-9.
 
 Measure filters allow you to filter measures (that is, actual versus target) 
based on a dimension member. Although you can perform a similar 
action for a specific KPI measure, this allows a filter to be applied to 
all measures. It’s like adding a dimension member to your scorecard 
without seeing the dimension. You don’t need to do this very often if at 
all, so we’ll skip this step.
 
10. Click the Next button.
 
 The Add Member Columns dialog box opens.
 
11. To add dimension values to your scorecard, select the Add Column 
Members check box, click the Select Dimension button, select the 
dimension you want, and click the OK button. See Figure 12-10.
 
 We want to add a dimension to the scorecard, so we select the Add 
Column Members check box.
 
 Then we click the Select Dimension button, choose Sales Territory.Sales 
Territory from the drop-down list, and click the OK button.
 
12. From the Select Members window, select the dimension member 
values you want to see in your scorecard and click the OK button 
(see Figure 12-11).
 
 You see a confirmation of your selections.
 
 We choose All Sales Territories, Europe, North America, and Pacific. 
If you pick All Sales Territories, you will see one column with the total 
All Sales Territories, not each sales territory, unless you choose them 
specifically as well.

Making Changes to Your 
Existing Scorecard
While the Scorecard Wizard we just walked through is incredibly helpful in 
helping you set up a scorecard, you may of course look at the result of what 
you built and want to make some changes. No need to fear; you don’t need 
to run the wizard again. You can make a number of changes right in the 
Workspace pane using editing tools and data from the Details pane (shown 
in Figure 12-12).
 
Dimensions in scorecards aren’t dynamic. You can’t add a hierarchy that drills 
up and down like you can in ProClarity, so it’s worth your time to consider 
how dimension values may change over time and how this will impact your 
scorecard. In the following example, we add specified years to our scorecard, 
but this will become quickly outdated when a new year occurs.
Removing and adding dimensions 
to your scorecard
A common edit of a scorecard is to add or remove dimensions to provide 
more or less granularity or specificity to your KPIs.
Follow these steps to remove dimensions from your scorecard:

232
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
1. In your workspace, select the dimension headers and column values 
that you want to remove.
 
 In Figure 12-13, we’ve selected all the dimension headers for deletion, 
but not yet the columns that we want to remove, because we want to 
show you what happens if you don’t delete the KPI data cells as well.
 
2. Click the Delete icon on the Home toolbar and then click the Publish 
Item icon.
 
 If you only removed the headers, you will still have all the data columns, 
as shown in Figure 12-14, no longer sliced by a dimension (note how the 
values repeat). When we delete the headers and extraneous columns, 
the scorecard looks like Figure 12-15.
 
Figure 12-13: 
Selecting 
your 
dimension 
headers.
 
 
Figure 12-14:

extraneous 
columns

Figure 12-15:

233
 Chapter 12: Scoring Your Business Performance
To add dimensions to your scorecard, follow these steps:
 
1. Expand the Dimensions folder in the Details➪Available Items frame.
 
2. Drag and drop the attribute you want onto your scorecard in your 
workspace.
 
 When you drop the attribute, you can see a thin blue line with arrows 
pointing to where the attribute will be dropped (as shown in Figure 
12-15). Where you drop the attribute depends on where you want to 
see it:
 
• If you drop the attribute on top of your KPI members (for example, 
Actual, Target, Prior Year), you can see each attribute value with 
its own set of KPI members.
 
• If you drop the attribute below your KPI members, you can see 
each KPI member with a set of attribute values.
 
• If you drop the attribute to the left of the KPI measure (for exam-
ple, GrossProfitMarginKPI, SalesAmountKPI), you can see each 
attribute value with a set of KPI measures. If we add Sales Territory 
to the left of the children KPIs, as shown in Figure 12-16, the blue 
line covers just the children. 
 
Figure 12-16: 
Dropping 
your dimen-
sion values.
 
 
• If you drop the attribute to the right of the KPI measures, you 
can see each KPI measure with its own set of attributes.
 
• If you drop the attribute to the left of the objective KPI, you 
can see your attribute members with a set of objective and 
children KPIs.
 
 A Select Members dialog box opens.
 
 We dragged Date.Date.CalendarYear into our workspace, and when 
we drop that above the KPI members, the dialog box shown in 
Figure 12-17 opens.

 Your attributes are added to your scorecard.
 
 In Figure 12-17, we choose 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004, but not a top level 
(All Periods), and then click the OK button.
 
 When we click the OK button, the selected attributes are added to our

Setting objectives and reordering KPIs
Now that your KPIs are set up, you may still want to
 
✓ Specify the order of your KPIs
 
✓ Set your KPI objectives by assigning children KPIs, the KPIs that 
summarize to the objective KPI scores

235
 Chapter 12: Scoring Your Business Performance
A child KPI has to be physically underneath its objective. To reorder KPIs, 
see the section “Reordering KPIs,” later in this chapter.
Setting objectives by indenting KPIs
To make a KPI a child of its objective, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the child KPI in your workspace that you want to indent.
 
 In Figure 12-19, we select SalesAmountKPI, which is directly underneath 
Sales Objective, the objective KPI.
 
2. Click the Decrease Level icon in the Format section of the Edit toolbar, 
as shown in Figure 12-19.
 
 Your KPI becomes a child of the objective KPI.
 
 Figure 12-20 shows SalesAmountKPI indented under Sales Objective, 
which now has a minus sign.

236
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Reordering KPIs
In this example, we want to add a KPI (GrossProfitMarginKPI) to add to the 
objective, but it is currently above the objective.
Follow these steps to reorder your KPI:
 
1. Select the KPI that you want to move.
 
2. Click the Down Intent icon until your KPI is in the proper position.
 
 We select GrossProfitMarginKPI as shown in Figure 12-21, and then click 
the Down Indent icon until it is under SalesAmountKPI.
 
 Now we have to indent the GrossProfitMarginKPI so that it becomes a 
child of Sales Objective, which we do by following the preceding steps 
for making the KPI a child of its objective (see the previous section). 
And then, of course, we publish.
 
Figure 12-21: 
Selecting 
your KPIs 
so you can 
move them 
around.
 
Giving KPIs weight toward an objective
Next, you might want to weight the children KPIs so that they add more or 
less value to the objective KPI score. This can increase the score of a child 
KPI that you consider to be more important to the overall score.
Follow these steps to weight your children KPIs:
 
1. Right-click the KPI that you want to weight.
 
 In Figure 12-22, we right-click GrossProfitMarginKPI. A KPI options 
menu opens.
 
2. Select Properties from the options menu.
 
 The KPI View Settings dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 12-23.

3. Enter a weight value in the Score Rollup Weight box, and click the OK 
button (and publish).
 
 In Figure 12-23, we enter a weighting value of 5 to GrossProfitMarginKPI. 
The 2003 Sales Objective KPI Target value changes from yellow to red, 
as shown in Figure 12-24 (compared to Figure 12-22). This is because the 
poor GrossProfitMarginKPI value, and hence the score, is being weighed 
more highly than the borderline SalesAmountKPI for that same period.

Getting the right look with 
scorecard formatting
You can make many formatting changes to your scorecard to obtain the look 
and feel you desire or to draw attention to specific items. You can change the 
following items:
 
✓ Font size, color, and type
 
✓ Cell/row/column color
 
✓ Left/center/right alignment
To change formatting, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the cell(s), row(s), or column(s) that you want to format.
 
 A solid black line is visible around what you select.
 
 In Figure 12-25, we select the Sales Objective row.

2. Click icons in the Font section of the Edit toolbar to change the 
formatting properties of your selection.
 
 In Figure 12-26, we click the Bold icon and increase the font size to 10. 
You could also change the background cell or font color and alignment.
 
3. Publish.
 
 Your scorecard element is now published to your PerformancePoint

▶ Creating new PerformancePoint reports
S
corecards may be the glitz and glamour of business performance 
solutions, but reports are the bread and butter. Aside from using 
scorecards for actual-to-target monitoring, most business intelligence and 
performance management reporting is done via report elements in the form 
of grids (numbers) and charts (pictures).
If you are new to online analytical processing (OLAP) reporting (like Analysis 
Services), you may be more familiar with reports that have limited interactiv-
ity (a sort here, a filter there) or none at all (hence the doorstop that is 
your current business performance report). PerformancePoint leverages the 
capabilities of our good friend Analysis Services by providing a dynamic, 
interactive, and analytical environment to the get your users the data they 
need the way they want to see it.
But what if you already have a library of business performance reports that 
you’ve built in Reporting Services, ProClarity, or another Web-enabled 
application? No need to fear; importing is here. You can easily incorporate 
your existing report catalog into your PPS environment and dashboards. 
Thus you can eliminate a significant amount of migration and/or rework, 
allowing you to move forward with increasingly more effective business 
performance analytics. It’s a win/win situation.

242
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Using Reports You Have Already Created
If you have existing reporting environments (that is, Reporting Services, 
ProClarity, Excel Web Services), it’s just a few simple steps to integrate your 
existing reports into PerformancePoint.
 
While the reports themselves can only provide functionality of the existing 
software, you can connect these reports to each other and new PPS reports 
with dashboard filters.
Creating a PPS report element 
from an existing report
Follow these steps to create a PPS report element:
 
1. Right-click the Reports element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 A Reports options menu opens, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
Creating a

2. Choose New Report.
 
 The Select A Report Template dialog box opens.
 
3. Select ProClarity Analytics Server Page, Excel Services, or SQL Server 
Report, and then click the OK button.
 
 A dialog box for naming your new report opens, similar to the one 
shown in Figure 12-3.
 
 In Figure 13-2, we select ProClarity Analytics Server page and click the 
OK button.
 
4. Enter the name of your report in the Name field and the optional 
folder name of your new report in the Default Display Folder field.
 
 We name the report PPSProClarity and the folder PPSReports.

Setting up a Reporting Services report
To set up a Reporting Services report in PPS, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the down arrow in the Server Mode box to select either Report 
Center or Integrated SharePoint, depending on where your Reporting 
Services reports (.rdx files) are deployed (probably Report Center).
 
 Figure 13-5 shows the Reporting Services Report Editor tab.
 
2. Type in the server name of your Reporting Services or SharePoint 
server, depending on your selection from Step 1.
 
 In Figure 13-5, we type in http://devapp1/reportserver2005.
 
3. Click the Browse button to the right of the Report field.

5. Select or deselect the Show Toolbar, Show Parameters, and Show 
Docmap check boxes.
 
 These check boxes are below the Report field, as shown in Figure 13-5.
 
• Select Show Toolbar if you want users to have the Reporting 
Services toolbar to enable zooming, exporting, and printing 
functionality.
 
• Select Show Parameters if you want users to be able to set 
Reporting Services parameters with the report. Because you can 
use dashboard filters across dashboard reports, or specifically 
for one report on a dashboard, you don’t necessarily need to keep 
the native parameters in view.
 
• Select Show Docmap if you want your report to include a 
document map in a separate pane.
 
 In Figure 13-5, we select the Show Toolbar check box.
 
6. Set your zoom level by clicking the down arrow to the right of the 
field and choosing the value you want.
 
 The default is 100 percent.
 
7. To select or change the value of a report parameter, in the Report 
Parameters box, click the parameter row you want to edit and click 
the Edit button.

 We choose Syed Abbas as the default value and click the OK button.
 
 You don’t have to specify report parameters at this point. However, 
some parameters don’t have set defaults. In this example, EmpID doesn’t 
have a set default. This fact is shown in the SQL Server Reporting 
Services Report box of Figure 13-7. You can see the warning “The 
‘EmpID’ parameter is missing a value.” You can use a dashboard filter 
later (see Chapter 14) to enable users to populate that parameter value, 
but if you want to view the report now, you need to enter a value. When 
you resolve this error, you can see the top of the Reporting Services 
report in the Report frame (it’s the toolbar, because we enabled the 
toolbar in Step 5).
 
 To view the results of your configuration changes, click the double up 
arrow in the upper-right corner of the Report Settings frame. Then you

Creating Your New PerformancePoint 
Report
Being able to use existing reports is a great way to get started in setting up 
elements for your dashboard. But PerformancePoint reports deliver function-
ality via a SharePoint environment that might be limited using other report 
types. Functions like filtering, sorting, top and bottom selections, pivoting, 
and changing report types enable users to get the information they need to 
make better business decisions.
 
For more information on the different report types and what they might be 
used for, see Chapter 15.
Some people like numbers: 
Creating your grid report
It’s true: Some users prefer grids, and some users prefer charts. While a 
picture can paint a thousand words, a grid full of numbers can tell a heck 
of a story. But it doesn’t matter, because you aren’t limited to one or 
the other.
You can build grids that become charts and charts that become grids, or 
you can display both grids and charts connected to each other with 
filters on a dashboard page (and we’re getting really excited about all the 
possibilities).
The two report types that provide great functionality include
 
✓ Analytic grids (recommended)
 
✓ Pivot tables
Providing powerful analysis with analytic grids
Analytics grids are the meat of a business performance solution. These grids 
will likely make up at least half of the reports you deploy into dashboards 
because they are informative, clear, and easy to use, and they have a lot of 
functional capability. To find out more about how analytics grids deliver 
great business performance information to users, see Chapters 15 
through 17.

250
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
Follow these steps to create an analytics grid:
 
1. Right-click the Reports element header and select New Report. See 
Figure 13-1.
 
 The Create A Report dialog box opens to the Name The Report page.
 
2. Enter a name for your report in the Name field (and a folder name in 
the Folder Name field if you so choose), and click the Next button.
 
 We enter the name PPSAnalyticsGrid (really, our creativity overwhelms 
you, doesn’t it) and the folder PPSReports.
 
 The Select A Data Source page opens in the dialog box, as shown in 
Figure 13-10.
 
3. Select the data source for your report, click the Finish button, and 
then click the Close button.
 
 We select AdventureWorksPPSfD in the AdventureWorksPPSfd folder.
 
 Your report Design tab opens in your workspace, as shown in 
Figure 13-11.
 
4. Drag and drop fields from your Measures, Dimensions, and Named 
Sets folders shown in your Details frame to your Rows, Columns, or 
Background frames at the bottom of the Design tab.
 
 You can see a blue line appear in the frame you are dropping into, as 
shown in the Columns frame of Figure 13-12.

frame.
 
 
 In Figure 13-13, we drag the Sales Amount, Sales Amount Quota, and 
SalesAmountVariance measures into Columns, and we drag the Sales 
Territory dimension into Rows:
 
• Columns show along the top of the grid, as the measure in 
Figure 13-13.
 
• Rows show down the side of the grid. Figure 13-13 shows Sales 
Territory rolled up to the top level, All Sales Territories, as the 
current row member.
 
• All measures go in the same place, either in Columns or Rows, but 
not both — you can’t cross-tabulate measures.
 
• Background fields are used for filtering the grid by dimension 
members without actually showing that dimension in the 
grid itself.
 
5. Click the down arrow next to any dimension in your Rows, Columns, 
or Background that you want to filter.
 
 The Select Members dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-14.

exclude in your report, and then click the OK button.
 
 In this case, we
 
• Deselect Default Member
 
• Expand All Sales Territories
 
• Select Europe, North America, and Pacific, but not NA (although 
we can think of quite a few people we’d like to send there)

253
 Chapter 13: Unleashing Business Knowledge
 
 Member selection is a little strange. All category (like All Sales Territory 
shown in Figure 13-14) isn’t just a subtotal; it is the total regardless of 
which descendants you pick for this view. This works a bit better for 
nonhierarchical data.
 
7. Click the Browse button below your grid to adjust the default view of 
your grid.
 
 A view of what your report will look like when it’s in your dashboard is 
shown in Figure 13-15.

want in your default (or beginning) view.
 
 In Figure 13-15, we expand the top-level All Sales Territories to show 
Europe, North America, and Pacific in the default view.
 
9. Click the OK button. The report in your design workspace now shows 
your new default view, as shown in Figure 13-16.
 
 Even when a hierarchy is present, the Design view doesn’t show 
the plus or minus signs. You will see the plus and minus signs in the 
Browse view.

Enabling ad hoc analysis with pivot tables
Pivot tables are nothing new, but good things withstand the test of time. 
You find pros and cons to using a pivot table over an analytics grid. On the 
pro side:
 
✓ Users can drag and drop dimensions and measures from a field list into 
their grid, giving them complete control over the rows, columns, and 
grid filters.
 
✓ Users can export their pivot table to Excel from SharePoint, keeping the 
live connection to the cube (if security allows). This means that they can 
leverage the reporting power of Excel 2007 from a jumping-off pad of 
their dashboard.
But on the con side:
 
✓ They don’t look as nice and polished as a ProClarity grid.
 
✓ Most business users don’t need or even want unlimited querying 
flexibility, so forcing them to run ad hoc queries creates more work 
than is necessary.
 
✓ You don’t have the same analytical tools as you have with analytics 
grids. For a comparison of reports and analytical capabilities, see 
Figure 16-1.
 
Microsoft Web Components must be installed to create a pivot table in PPS.

255
 Chapter 13: Unleashing Business Knowledge
To create a pivot table report element, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Reports element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
 A Reports options menu opens, as shown in Figure 13-1.
 
2. Select New Report from the Reports options menu.
 
 The Select A Report Template dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-2.
 
3. Select Pivot Table, and click the OK button.
 
4. Enter the name of your report in the Name field and the optional 
folder name of your new report in the Default Display Folder field.
 
 We name the report PPSPivotTable and the folder PPSReports.
 
5. Click the Finish button and then the Close button.
 
 Your report element is now open to the Editor page in your workspace.
 
 Unlike with analytics grids, you need to set up a data source separately 
from your data source elements.
 
6. Click the Commands And Options icon on the Pivot Table toolbar.
 
 The icon is shown in Figure 13-17, as is the Commands And Options 
dialog box that opens when you click it.

Creating your chart report
Charts are great for showing trends, change over time, comparisons, relative 
size, or volume of measures. Plus, they are pretty. Seriously, users respond 
to charts because they look cool and they quickly communicate business 
performance. You have several chart types to choose from:
 
✓ Analytics charts (recommended)
 
✓ Pivot charts
 
✓ Trend analysis charts
Providing visual insight with analytics charts
If analytics grids are the meat of a business performance solution, analytics 
charts are the potatoes (hungry yet?). Analytics charts provide an essential 
complement to analytics grid reporting, and they function very similarly. 
They are also built similarly. Follow these steps to create an analytics chart:
 
1. Follow the preceding Steps 1–3 for creating an analytics grid, except 
instead of choosing an analytics grid template, choose an analytics 
chart.
 
 See the section “Providing powerful analysis with analytic grids,” earlier 
in this chapter.
 
2. Drag and drop fields from your Measures, Dimensions, and Named 
Sets folders shown in your Details frame to your Series, Bottom Axis, 
or Background frames at the bottom of the Design tab.

259
 Chapter 13: Unleashing Business Knowledge
 
 You can see a blue line appear in the frame you are dropping into, as 
shown in the Columns frame of Figure 13-12, and when you have 
dropped at least one series and one axis, you will see your chart in your 
workspace.
 
• The Series are the numeric values (that is, the measures) that your 
chart shows.
 
• Bottom Axis is the value along the bottom axis of your report.
 
• Background is where you put the attributes you want to filter your 
report by, but that you don’t want to see on your series or axis. 
 
 In Figure 13-22, we drop the Sales Amount and Sales Amount Quota 
measures into the Series and the calendar date hierarchy (called Date 
Date.Calendar) into the Bottom Axis frames.
 
 You can see both measures next to each other in a bar chart, the series 
key to the right of the bars, and the bottom axis of Calendar Date rolled 
up to the top-level All Periods.
 
3. Click the down arrow next to the dimensions in Bottom Axis to select 
members.
 
 The Select Members dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 13-23.
 
4. Select the members you want to see along the bottom axis, and click 
the OK button.
 
 In Figure 13-23, we select 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. Now the report no 
longer shows all periods summed together, but each year broken out.

 Your chart reflects the style you have selected.
 
 In Figure 13-25, we click the Line Chart icon on the browser toolbar and, 
poof, a line chart appears.
 
 For some reason, a pie chart isn’t one of your reporting choices. We like 
pie charts. If you do too (and really, who doesn’t?), you’ll have to build 
one in ProClarity and follow the preceding steps for creating a new PPS 
report from ProClarity.
 
7. Click the OK button to close the browser.
 
8. Publish your new analytics chart.

Enabling ad hoc visualizations with pivot charts
Pivot charts are built very similarly to pivot tables. Follow all the steps for 
setting up pivot table, except select Pivot Chart as the template.
For more information on adding dimensions and measures to your pivot 
table, see Chapter 16.
Predicting the future with trend analysis charts
We see a trend analysis chart in your future. A trend analysis chart takes data 
that you have in a scorecard element, applies a statistical algorithm to it 
to predict future trends on that data, and then displays the history and 
prediction in a line chart. (Try to use the term statistical algorithm as often 
as possible. It makes you sound smart.)

262
Part III: Building Your Business Reports 
 
Here’s the issue:
A trend analysis chart can only predict trends to the last date that you 
have in your cube. But the last date you have in your cube might be the 
last date you have data for.
Here’s the solution: 
Your Date dimension should be populated with future dates, for as far 
as you want to predict based on your historical data. So if you have 
historical data for 2001 to 2004, you may want to add 2005 dates into 
your Date dimension, or have you DBA do it for you.
Trend analysis charts are based on scorecards. You may want to build a 
scorecard that specifically feeds your trend analysis chart and make 
sure that
 
✓ A time dimension exists in the scorecard on the columns
 
✓ The time dimension is at the level (that is, year and month) that you 
want to trend to be on.
 
✓ If you don’t want multiple lines in your trend analysis chart (that is, 
one for each actual, target, and prior year like those shown at the end of 
the following steps), delete the target and other KPI values from your 
scorecard, leaving only the actual value.
Follow these steps to create a trend analysis chart:
 
1. Right-click the Reports element header and select New Report. See 
Figure 13-1.
 
 The Create A Report dialog box opens to the name the report page.
 
2. Enter a name for your report in the Name field (and a folder name in 
the Folder Name field if you so choose), and click the Next button.
 
 The Select A Data Source (scorecard element) dialog box opens, as 
shown in Figure 13-10.
 
 We enter the name PPSTrendAnalysisChart and the folder name 
PPSReports.
 
3. Select a scorecard from your server.
 
 In Figure 13-26, we select AnalysisServicesScorecard in the 
PPSAdventureWorks folder.

Creating your strategy map report
Strategy maps provide an overall view of your organization’s strategy 
quantified through KPIs and objectives, and presents the status of your KPIs 
and objectives graphically as your underlying data source is updated. If an 
objective goes red, you see it here.
To build a strategy map report, you should first identify or create the 
following:
 
✓ A scorecard that contains the KPIs you want to include in the strategy 
map. The scorecard we will use is shown in Figure 13-30.
 
✓ A Visio diagram of shapes connected to each other that will become 
the basis for your KPIs and objectives. The one we created is shown 
at the end of the following steps.

ou made it to th home stretch. The culmination of your efforts, your 
hard work, your diligence. The dashboard element is where you
 
✓ Assemble your scorecards and reports into a consolidated interface
 
✓ Create and add dashboards filters to tie your scorecards and reports 
together
 
✓ Deploy your new business performance solution to your business users
Assembling a Dashboard
A dashboard element is made up of four primary components, as shown in 
Figure 14-1:
 
✓ Dashboard page: A dashboard page is a Web page that contains any 
number of zones with content and filters. Dashboard pages have names.
 
✓ Zone: A zone is a section of a dashboard page in which you can place 
content or filters.
 
✓ Reports: Dashboard reports include report and scorecard elements that 
you place into your zones to flesh out the dashboard page.
 
✓ Filters: Dashboard filters are drop-down lists of attribute members that 
are linked to any and all reports in the zones on your dashboard page. 
These also get dropped into a zone.

Zoning In: Creating and designing 
your dashboard layout with zones
Dashboards contain one to many zones, so the first step when setting up a 
dashboard is to choose how many zones you want. To set up a new dash-
board, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the Dashboard element header in your Workspace 
Browser.
 
 A dashboard options menu opens.
 
2. Choose New Dashboard.
 
 The Select a Dashboard Page Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 14-2.
 
 We select the Header, 2 Columns dashboard layout and click the 
OK button.
 
3. Select the template you want to start with, and click the OK button.
 
 The naming dialog box opens.
 
 You have the option of adding, removing, and reorganizing your 
dashboard template at any time in the Dashboard Editor; this is just 
to get you started. To edit your zone layout, see the section “Zoning 
out: Reorganizing and sizing your zones,” later in this chapter.
 
4. Enter the name of your new dashboard and a folder name if you so 
choose, and then click the Finish button.
 
 Your new dashboard opens in your workspace, as shown in Figure 14-3.
 
 We named the dashboard Adventure Works Performance Management.

Adding the building blocks 
to your dashboard
After your new dashboard has been created, you want to start adding some 
content — reports and scorecards — to your dashboard page. To add 
content, follow these steps:

274
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
1. Expand your Reports or Scorecards folders in your Details frame to 
see what scorecards and reports are available in your workspace.
 
 The reports and scorecards that are on our workspace are shown in the 
Details frame of Figure 14-3.
 
 Reports have to be in your workspace to add them to your dashboard.
 
2. Drag and drop your report or scorecard elements into each of your 
zones.
 
 In Figure 14-4, we drag PPSAnalyticsChart from the Reports folder into 
the Left Column. A blue line appears where your element will drop. 
 
 Figure 14-5 shows the PPSAnalyticsChart in the right frame and the 
AnalysisServicesScorecard in the left frame. We also dropped a 
PPSAnalyticsGrid underneath the PPSAnalyticsChart. No zone was set 
up, but we can drop there anyway.
 
 We haven’t added anything to the top header because we will use that 
area of the page for a dashboard filter (see the next section).

 Chapter 14: Monitoring Your Business at a Glance with Dashboards
 
3. Publish your dashboard.
 
 At this point, you could be ready to review your dashboard in Preview 
mode or even deploy to SharePoint in Deploy mode; if so, skip ahead. If 
you want to add filters or pages, or reorganize your zones, carry on.
 
To see how your dashboard will look to users, you can use Preview mode. See 
the section “Previewing your dashboard,” later in this chapter.
Powering your dashboard page with filters
Two types of filters exist, in addition to any filters that you created within 
your reports or scorecards, including the following:
 
✓ Drop-down lists or expandable trees from which users make selections 
to filter and link any or all reports or scorecards on your dashboard. 
This is likely the one you would use the most.
 
✓ KPIs from scorecards that users can select to filter other reports in the 
dashboard to show data for that KPI. To implement this, you need a 
scorecard and a report to show details about measures contained in the 
KPI. This is a good way to allow users to drill down to more detail on a 
“bad” KPI.
This chapter focuses on drop-down lists, but you can find more information 
on this method on the Microsoft PerformancePoint blog:
http://blogs.msdn.com/performancepoint/archive/2007/12/21/
passing-context-from-scorecards-to-other-
report-views.aspx).
You can do the following with PPS dashboard filters:
 
✓ Create tree-style (hierarchical) drop-down lists in addition to 
simple lists
 
✓ Enable multiple versus single selection of members
 
✓ Set defaults right in PPS
The easiest way to create an expandable filter list is to use Member 
Selection, choosing an existing dimension hierarchy or attribute from your 
Analysis Services cube. This works especially well if you are using Analysis 
Services–based reports and scorecards.
Follow these steps to create a dashboard filter:
 
1. Click the Filters tab in your dashboard workspace to open the Filters 
Workspace page.
 
 The Filters page is shown in the background of Figure 14-6.

276
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
Figure 14-6: 
Viewing 
the Filters 
workspace 
and choos-
ing a filter 
template.
 
 
2. Click the New Filter icon in the Filters frame of the Filters workspace.
 
 The Select A Dashboard Filter Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 14-6.
 
3. Select the filter template you want to use, and click the OK button.
 
 The Create A Filter dialog box opens.
 
 Filter templates include the following:
 
• Member Selection allows you to choose dimension members from 
any of your data sources. This works especially well if you use the 
same data source as you did for your reports and scorecards — 
even better if you are using Analysis Services.
 
 New members aren’t automatically added to your drop-down list. 
If you use Member Selection to create a list of dates, new dates 
that you haven’t manually selected here because they don’t exist 
will not appear as part of your list. In this case, you should use 
MDX Query.
 
• MDX Query allows you to use the power of MDX to create your 
own filter list from an Analysis Services data source. While 
Member Selection is a bit easier, you will need to use MDX Query 
to create dynamic sets (like dates) that may change over time. 
It is also great for creating a drop-down list of items that aren’t 
attributes, like a list of measures. 
 
 Chapter 18 lists several great resources for using MDX. 

277
 Chapter 14: Monitoring Your Business at a Glance with Dashboards
 
• Named Sets allows you to use a named set already created in 
Analysis Services as your drop-down list. This is good for using 
static-set lists (like states within a user-defined region) or dynamic-
set lists (like Top 10 Salespeople).
 
• Tabular Values allows you to use a variety of data sources to 
select values for your drop-down list, along with a default. This 
is similar to Member Selection except that the list can only come 
from an Excel or SQL data source. This is good if you want to 
manually create a selection list.
 
 If you are using a tabular value list or any list for which the data 
source is different than the report data source, make sure that 
the filter values will map correctly to the reports and scorecards.
 
• Time Intelligence allows you to create time calculations (for 
example, Prior Year = Year – 1, Prior Month = Month – 1) within 
the filter definition itself. We try to program all time intelligence 
into Analysis Services itself, but this is a nice alternative if you 
haven’t done so.
 
 We select Member Selection and click the OK button.
 
4. Enter the name of your new filter and a description if you choose, and 
click the Next button.
 
 The Select A Data Source dialog box opens.
 
 We name our filter PPSMemberSelectionFilter.
 
 The name you give your filter is what shows up on the dashboard as the 
filter label, so choose a name appropriately. For example, because we 
will use this filter for member selection on Sales Territory, we could call 
it, oh, Sales Territory.
 
5. Select your data source, and click the Next button.
 
 The Select Members dialog box opens.
 
 We choose the PPSAdventureWorks Analysis Services data source and 
click the Next button. This is the same data source that we used for the 
reports that will be in our dashboard.
 
6. Click the Select Dimension button, select the attribute or hierarchy 
where you want to select your members, and click the OK button.
 
 You are brought back to your Select Members page.
 
 We click the Select Dimension button, choose Sales Territory.Sales 
Territory as shown in Figure 14-7, and click the OK button.

7. Click the Select Members button, select the members you want to 
select for your list or deselect the members you don’t want on your 
list, and click the OK button.
 
 You are brought back to your Select Members page.
 
 We select Europe, North America, and Pacific; and deselect All Sales 
Territories and NA from the member selection list. See Figure 14-8.
 
8. Set a default member by right-clicking the member and choosing Set 
As Default Selection from the member options menu. Then click the 
OK button to close the Select Members dialog box.
 
 You are brought back to your Select Members page.
 
 We right-click Europe and choose Set As Default Selection. The default 
member selection is now shown as (Default Selected) next to Europe, as 
shown in Figure 14-9. Also, your default member appears on your Select 
Members page under Default Member Selection.

9. Click the Next button.
 
 The Choose Display Method dialog box opens.
 
10. Choose your display option from List (a single selection list of items), 
Tree (a tree from which a single item can be selected), or Multi-Select 
Tree (a tree from which multiple items can be selected).
 
 The trees are great for hierarchies.
 
 We select Multi-Select Tree, as shown in Figure 14-10, so that users can 
select more than one sales territory at a time.
 
11. Click the Finish button and then the Close button.
 
 You are brought back to your Dashboard Workspace Filter page, where 
your new filter is listed in the Filters section.
 
 To edit your filter (that is, go back through the Filter Wizard), click 
the value in the Data Source Type field. In Figure 14-11, we would click 
Member Selection.

Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
18. Choose a dashboard item endpoint from the options in the drop-
down list.
 
 A dashboard item endpoint is the row, column, measure, or dimension 
to which you want to connect your filter value. Your options may vary 
based on your report type and/or contents.
 
 Analytics charts and grids show measures and report dimension 
options:
 
• If you choose a report dimension that is the same as the filter 
dimension, the report dimension will be filtered by the values in 
the filter. This is good to use if the dimension you want to filter 
is in the row, column, or background of the chart or grid. If the 
dimension doesn’t show up as an option in your endpoint list, 
consider adding it to the background of your grid or chart.
 
• If you choose measures or a dimension that isn’t the same as the 
filter, your measures or dimensions will be replaced by the values 
in the filter. When users select a filter, they usually expect not 
that dimensions will change, but that the underlying data will be 
filtered, so take care when using this option.
 
 This is a good option if you want to provide a drop-down list of 
measures that users can select from, thus enabling them to choose 
which measures to display in their chart or grid.
 
 Scorecards show filters, rows, and columns options:
 
• If you choose Filters, your scorecard will be filtered by the filter.
  
 This is good to use if you want to filter the overall scorecard.
 
• If you choose Rows or Columns, your rows or columns will be 
replaced by the values in the filter.
 
 You can also filter strategy maps, trend analysis charts, PAS reports, 
Reporting Services reports, Excel Services reports, pivot tables, and 
pivot charts.
 
 When we add a filter link to the analytics chart, we don’t see a Sales 
Territory dimension in that report (so we don’t have Sales Territory 
as a drop-down dashboard endpoint option). We go back to the 
PPSAnalyticsChart report, add Sales Territory to the background, and 
publish. Now, when we create the filter for the analytics chart, we have 
the Sales Territory option. Sales Territory is already an option in the 
analytics grid report, so we create a link to that as well.
 
19. Choose a source value (Member Unique Name or Display Value) from 
the options in the Source Value drop-down list.
 
 Using Member Unique Name, especially when using Analysis Services, is 
a safer bet because Display Value may give you issues with members 
that have spaces (for example, North America). Display Value is better 
utilized when you are using a filter list that you created or one that isn’t 
sourced from Analysis Services.

283
 Chapter 14: Monitoring Your Business at a Glance with Dashboards
 
20. Click the OK button to close the Edit Filter Link dialog box and then 
publish your dashboard.
Zoning out: Reorganizing 
and sizing your zones
Zones can be moved, and you can drag and drop them where you want them.
To add a new zone, you can either drag and drop a report or scorecard onto 
your dashboard in between, above, or below existing zones. Or, you can 
follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click on the dashboard page where you want to place a 
new zone.
 
 A zone options menu opens, as shown in Figure 14-16.
 
 In Figure 14-16, we right-click the AnalysisServicesScorecard Report 
zone and are given the option to
 
• Add a zone to the left, right, above, or below that zone
 
• Split the existing zone into two (thereby adding another zone 
to the right)
 
• Delete the existing zone
 
• Edit the zone settings
 
2. Select Add Right to add a new zone to the right of your existing zone.
 
Figure 14-16: 
Adding, 
removing, 
and splitting 
a zone.
 

284
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
You can also resize an existing zone. Often one of your side-by-side reports 
requires a bit more room than the other. By default, zones split a Web 
page evenly; hence zones 2 across or 2 down default to a 50-50 split of the 
Web page. But you can adjust this to suit your reporting needs by following 
these steps:
 
1. Click the down arrow in the header of the zone that you want to 
decrease.
 
 A zone options menu opens.
 
 If you will resize using the following Specify Percentage Of Dashboard 
method, you have to decrease one zone first so that you can 
increase another, because your total percentage can’t be greater 
than 100 percent, and each zone will default to half, or 50 percent.
 
2. Select Edit Item.
 
 The Edit Item dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 14-17.
 
3. Click the Size tab.
 
4. Choose the Specify Width option, and then choose either Specify 
Percentage Of Dashboard Page or Specify Pixels.
 
 We select Specify Percentage Of Dashboard Page, and then change the 
analytic chart zone width to 40 percent.
 
Figure 14-17: 
Resizing 
your 
dashboard 
zones.
 

285
 Chapter 14: Monitoring Your Business at a Glance with Dashboards
 
5. Repeat with other zones as necessary.
 
 We change the size of the scorecard zone to 60 percent, thus giving the 
scorecard more room on our dashboard page.
Finally, you can rename your dashboard by following these steps:
 
1. Click the page name in the Pages section of the Editor frame.
 
 You should now be able to edit the page name.
 
2. Type in your new name.
 
 In Figure 14-18, we change the page name to Dashboard.
 
Figure 14-18: 
Renaming 
your 
dashboard 
page.
 
Adding pages to your dashboard
A dashboard can contain many pages. To a user, it may look like many 
dashboards exist, but technically, it’s one dashboard with many pages. You 
can think of a Dashboard (with a capital D) as a set of many dashboards 
(with a lowercase d) that you deploy to a customer group. You might have 
an Executive Dashboard that has many pages of reports and dashboards 
for your executives, a Sales Dashboard that has many pages of reports and 
dashboards for your sales team, and so on.
Follow these steps to add a new page your existing dashboard:
 
1. Click the New Page icon on the toolbar of the Pages frame of the 
Editor tab.
 
 The Select A Dashboard Page Template dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 14-2.
 
2. Select the template you want to start with, and click the OK button.
 
 Your new page will be created and is ready to be filled with reports, 
scorecards, and filters.
 
3. Publish your dashboard.

The same property-setting methods that apply to the data source and 
indicator elements apply here as well. Refer to Chapter 9 for more 
information on setting security.
Delivering Your Dashboards to Users
Now that you’ve completed and published your dashboard, you have two 
options for the next steps:
 
✓ You can preview your dashboard to the preview site to review and unit 
test before you deploy to your SharePoint users.
 
✓ You can deploy your dashboard to SharePoint, thus creating a business 
performance management solution for your organization.
Previewing your dashboard
Previewing your dashboard as you build it is a good idea, if only to make sure 
that you are getting the results that you want from your filters and that the 
zone sizes are good for the reports in your dashboard.
 
The preview site is also a good place to share the dashboard with your QA 
team prior to deploying to SharePoint.
To preview your new (or any published) dashboard, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Dashboard element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
2. Click the Preview button on the Edit toolbar.
 
 The Deploy Dashboard To Preview Site dialog box opens to the Select A 
Dashboard Page, as shown in Figure 14-19.
 
3. Select the dashboard you want to preview, and click the Next button.
 
 The Specify A Location page opens in your dialog box.
 
 We select Adventure Works Performance Management.
 
4. Enter your preview site location, which will look something like 
http://ppsmonitoring.companyname.net/Preview, and click the 
Finish button.
 
 Your preview site opens to the first page of your dashboard.
 
 We enter the preview site URL and click the Finish button. Figure 14-20 
shows the Adventure Works Performance Management dashboard on 
the preview site.

Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Deploying to your SharePoint site
Here is the moment where all your hard work is about to pay off. You are 
about to revolutionize the way your company manages business performance 
by providing it with the information it needs to know. 
To deploy your dashboard to SharePoint, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Dashboard element header in your Workspace Browser.
 
2. Click the SharePoint button on the Edit toolbar.
 
 The Deploy Dashboard dialog box opens.
 
3. Select the dashboard you want to deploy, and click the Next button.
 
 The Specify A Location page opens in your dialog box.
 
 We select Adventure Works Performance Management.
 
4. Enter your SharePoint site location, which will look something like 
http://server/site, and click the Next button.
 
 The Select A Layout page opens in your dialog box.
 
 We enter our SharePoint site name.
 
5. Select Default from the Master Page drop-down menu or choose 
another SharePoint template if you have one.
 
 We select Default.
 
6. Click the Finish button.
 
 Your new PerformancePoint dashboard opens in SharePoint.
That’s it, you’re done. Now do the following:
 
✓ Send your business users a link to their new PerformancePoint dash-
board site, and let them know about all the great management reporting 
they now have access to.
 
✓ Tell your users to buy this book because Chapters 15–17 contain great 
user-guide material for analysts and managers that are new to both busi-
ness performance management reporting as well as PerformancePoint 
monitoring and analytics.
 
• Wait for the requests to start coming. When users see what 
PerformancePoint and you can do for them, they will want to 
revolutionize every aspect of their reporting process.

Discovering Your Business 
Performance with Dashboards
In This Chapter
▶ Getting to and around your dashboard
▶ Making business decisions from your PerformancePoint reports
▶ Focusing in on the KPIs that indicate performance sooner, not later
▶ Figuring out which reports you have so that you know how to analyze them and so that 
you know which types to ask for
U
nless you love spending the entire last week (at least) of every month 
and quarter assembling management reports (sifting through data, 
copying, pasting, entering data, formatting charts in spreadsheets, validating, 
printing, and so on), you can probably think of many other more constructive 
tasks you could be addressing. If you are the recipient of these reports, you 
have an idea of how your company, maybe even how your division, is doing — 
but you just don’t necessarily know why. And a couple of other problems exist 
with this scenario:
 
✓ You shouldn’t have to wait until quarter end to manage your business; 
you should have access to management information how and when you 
need to see it.
 
✓ The time spent manually assembling reports is time that could be spent 
analyzing reports to the level you need and making informed business 
decisions.
 
✓ Because of the time it takes to create the same reports every month, 
quarter, and so on, you are probably not getting a very holistic, or bal-
anced, view of your business performance.

290
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
This is an area where business intelligence with PerformancePoint Server 
really shines:
 
✓ PerformancePoint provides you with current feedback on how you’re 
doing with all the metrics and goals that are most important to you, 
rather than having to wait to the end of the quarter or year, when it may 
be too late to get back on track.
 
✓ PerformancePoint gives you the power to get to the level of informa-
tion you need or to view the specific attributes or dimensions that give 
meaning to your business metrics.
 
✓ PerformancePoint makes it easy to communicate that information 
across your enterprise.
Getting to Your Dashboard
The first step to analyzing your business performance data is opening your 
dashboard. This is pretty straightforward. To access your dashboard, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Open your Web browser and enter your dashboard portal link in the 
address bar.
 
 You must have an active intranet or Internet connection to connect to 
your dashboard site.
 
 This link may have been provided to you already and may look some-
thing like this: http://servername/dashboardname.aspx.
 
2. Click the Go button.
 
3. If you are prompted with a security dialog box, enter your user ID and 
password.
 
4. Click the OK button.
 
 Your dashboard page opens. An example of a dashboard page that is 
based on the AdventureWorks sample database is shown in Figure 15-1.
 
If you don’t have a link or icon to access your dashboard, or if your link 
doesn’t work or gives you an error, call the IT department, help desk, or 
person who set up your dashboard. You may also need permissions to 
access the site or underlying data sources, so mention that while you’re on 
the phone.

mileage 
may vary.
 
Introducing the Dashboard Interface
PerformancePoint dashboards are endlessly configurable, so your dashboard 
is likely to be different from the sample shown in Figure 15-1.
But in general, dashboards are composed of the following:
 
✓ Tabs: Tabs organize the dashboards in some way and usually show up 
on the top of the dashboard page. If your interface contains multiple 
tabs, click the tab to display that category of information. Tabs may con-
tain menus of reports, or they might bring you to another dashboard.
 
✓ Menus: Menus provide lists of actions you can take; they may appear 
on the dashboard page itself or on Internet Explorer’s toolbar. Report-
specific menus may also appear with the report zones (see Reports and 
Zones, later in this list).
 
✓ Reports: Reports are the individual displays that contain your KPI and 
dimension data in a variety of reporting formats (charts, grids, and 
scorecards). Each report allows you to view specified KPIs by specified 
business attributes (dimensions) at varying levels (hierarchies). For 
more information on reports, see Chapter 17.
 
✓ Zones: The space on the page that contains each report is called a zone. 
Will you ever need to know that? Probably not. . . .

292
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
✓ Dashboard filters: Dashboard filters are drop-down boxes of specific 
dimension values that, when selected, are applied to all the reports on 
the dashboard page. As opposed to a report filter, a dashboard filter 
changes the values of all the reports on the dashboard page, not just the 
individual report. For information on dashboard filters, see Chapter 17.
Determining What Kind 
of Reports You Have
A PerformancePoint dashboard is simply a Web page upon which is assem-
bled several different reports. PerformancePoint allows the person who built 
the dashboard to choose from a variety of report templates. This is great for 
two primary reasons: Different types of reports are better for communicating 
different types of information, and some report types offer more flexibility 
or interactivity than others. For example, line charts are great for showing 
trends over time, but scorecards are great for comparing your company’s 
actuals to its targets or budgets, so it’s good to know which one you are 
working with.
 
Because you have so many report choices, PerformancePoint can widely 
address the reporting needs of your organization. But that also means that 
some differing techniques exist for analyzing data with different report types.
The types of reports you might be analyzing include the following:
 
✓ Analytics chart and grid
 
✓ Scorecard
 
✓ Strategy map
 
✓ Trend analysis chart
 
✓ Pivot table and chart
 
✓ ProClarity chart and grid
 
✓ ProClarity decomposition tree
Recognizing analytics grids and charts
Analytics grids and charts show you your business performance information 
with numbers and graphs. See Figures 15-2 and 15-3.
The charts default to a particular color scheme, including blue, maroon, 
green and a taupe-ish gray. Nice.

Recognizing scorecards
Scorecards show you how your business is performing against goals. They 
show KPI values of actuals and goals with graphic indicators. See Figure 15-4.

Recognizing strategy maps
Strategy maps show you your overall business performance strategy and 
indicate how your KPIs are connected to each other. A strategy map looks 
like a Visio diagram (because it is), where each shape represents a KPI. See 
Figure 15-5.

Recognizing trend analysis charts
Trend analysis charts show historical trends over time and predict future 
trends based on historical data. A trend analysis chart looks like a line chart, 
where part of the line is blue (actual data) and part of the line is red (pre-
dicted data). See Figure 15-6.

 Chapter 15: Discovering Your Business Performance with Dashboards
Recognizing pivot tables and charts
Pivot tables and charts look like Excel pivot tables and charts and have a 
toolbar, as shown in Figures 15-7 and 15-8.
 
Figure 15-7: 
A pivot 
table.
 
 
Figure 15-8:

Recognizing ProClarity charts and grids
ProClarity grids and charts have a slightly different look (by default) than 
analytics charts and grids. The dimension names are usually shaded in gray 
instead of blue, and the background of the report zone is grayish instead of 

296
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
white. The big giveaway is that if you right-click a cell in a ProClarity grid, you 
don’t get a report options menu. You have to click a cell to get the options 
menu to open.
Also, the charts default to a particular color scheme including blue, orange, 
and yellow. Figure 15-9 shows a ProClarity grid, while Figure 15-10 displays a 
ProClarity chart.

Recognizing ProClarity decomposition trees
Decomposition trees look a bit like organization charts, as shown in 
Figure 15-11.

Other report types, which are not built into PerformancePoint or ProClarity, 
can be deployed to the same PerformancePoint dashboards. These report 
types may include the following:
 
✓ Reporting services
 
✓ Excel Web services
 
✓ Proprietary Web applications or reports built by someone in your 
organization
Chapter 17 shows you how to get the most out of your business informa-
tion and how you can slice it, dice it, dig into the details, drill up, drill down, 
export, and print it. But next, we show you how PerformancePoint can help 
you make better business decisions.
Using Dashboard Reports 
to Make Decisions
Just as the dashboard in your car provides feedback about how things are 
going now (how fast you’re going, how much gas you have left, how hot your 
engine is, and so on), PerformancePoint dashboards let you know how you 
your business is performing right now. Dashboards provide an at-a-glance, 
consolidated view of your most important business information. Like a car 
dashboard, PerformancePoint dashboards let you know when everything’s 
fine, when things are going exceptionally well, or when it may be time to pull 
over and take corrective action.
A dashboard quickly and clearly tells you how things are going for your orga-
nization as a whole and for the areas you manage. Dashboards accomplish 
this feat by displaying multiple reports or charts with metrics that best mea-
sure your company’s performance on a single page, as shown in Figure 15-1.

298
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
So, if it’s so easy, why are two chapters devoted to showing you how to 
analyze your dashboards and reports? Well, just in case it’s not that easy. 
If you are experienced with business intelligence analytical tools and your 
understanding of business metrics is high, just dive in to the reports. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any cell.
 
2. Select a menu item.
 
3. See what you get.
But, if you need a little more guidance than that, read on.
Understanding the metrics in your reports
Metrics are the numbers that measure how well or poorly your company is 
performing. The metrics that PerformancePoint displays in scorecards are 
called key performance indicators, or KPIs. A metric is a KPI if
 
✓ It is measurable.
 
✓ It is representative of a company objective.
 
✓ You can at least theoretically affect the metric through a change in busi-
ness practice, process, planning, or strategy.
The concept of business performance management is, of course, that you can 
manage you business’s performance, that is, identify issues and act on them. 
You may get enough information from one report on your dashboard to see 
where your business has problems, or you may find that the combination of 
information across the dashboard gives you a better understanding of what 
is wrong.
Identifying business performance 
issues in your dashboards
PerformancePoint offers a number of different report designs and enables 
your report developer to choose a style that best communicates to you 
how your business is performing. Your ability to make business decisions 
depends on your ability to read and understand the report you are given and 
to get to the source of the issues you identify. PerformancePoint dashboards 
provide you with meaningful combinations of reports that, at a glance, pro-
vide you with significant information but that also provide you with direction 
for further analysis.

299
 Chapter 15: Discovering Your Business Performance with Dashboards
Identifying issues in a scorecard
Scorecards are superior for comparing actual to budget data. As shown in 
Figure 15-4, a scorecard is a visual grouping of KPIs with graphics that indi-
cate how the KPI is measuring up against a goal or budget.
Although your scorecard might look a little different than Figure 15-4, in 
general, you will see a set of KPI measures as your rows, a column for actual 
data, and a column for budget data. In addition, you will see graphics that 
show the status of those KPIs.
You usually have three levels of an indicator that reflect the value of the com-
parison of an actual to a goal (for more information on how goals and indica-
tors are set, see Chapter 11):
 
✓ Good: Your actual meets or exceeds your goal — good job.
 
✓ Borderline: Your actual just misses your goal — keep an eye on it.
 
✓ Bad: Your actual fails to meet your goal — take action.
But the scorecard doesn’t always show you the numeric difference or vari-
ance between target and goal. Instead, it uses indicators (pictures that repre-
sent good, borderline, and bad), as shown in Figure 15-12.
 
Figure 15-12: 
Indicating 
the good, 
the bad, 
and the 
borderline.
 
To view how your KPIs measure up against your goals, follow these steps:
 
1. Find the scorecard report on your dashboard.
 
 It looks like Figure 15-4.

300
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
2. Identify KPIs with bad and borderline indicators. See Figure 15-12.
 
 In Figure 15-4, we are looking at our actual sales amount KPI versus the 
value that has been budgeted for that KPI — sales amount quota. The 
goal indicator is yellow, representing borderline. As the regional sales 
director, you want to dig a bit deeper to see whether you can pinpoint 
where your sales aren’t meeting quota.
Here is where a PerformancePoint scorecard has a weakness: You can’t drill 
up, drill down, drill down to, or drill down through in a scorecard. You might 
be able to expand and collapse a specified dimension, but flexibility is limited; 
you can’t really analyze your data to get to the source of the issue. But here’s 
also where the PerformancePoint dashboard has a strength. You can use the 
information you have ascertained from the scorecard and analyze that infor-
mation within one of the more interactive reports, such as the following:
 
✓ Grids and charts
 
✓ Decomposition trees
 
It is also possible for your report developer to connect scorecards to grids 
and charts so when you click a KPI value in your scorecard, all of the grids and 
charts in your dashboard change to represent that KPI value. 
Digging deeper for the source of the issue
Are you the person who always takes data from your reports and exports it 
to Excel so that you can analyze it? You know you are. But with analytical 
reports like grids, charts, and decomposition trees, you really don’t have to: 
These reports are great for allowing you to take your business knowledge 
and apply that to your analysis of the data. After you identify an issue with 
your scorecard (see the previous section of this chapter), dig deeper to the 
source of the issue right on your dashboard.
You have already identified the poorly performing KPIs. To find the cause, 
you can use an analytics grid report to dig into the details. An analytics grid 
is shown in Figure 15-13.
 
Figure 15-13: 
Showing 
you what’s 
wrong and 
giving you 
the power to 
dig deeper.
 

301
 Chapter 15: Discovering Your Business Performance with Dashboards
The following steps show how to take use what you’ve learned about your 
business performance from a scorecard, and apply that knowledge to report 
analysis:
 
1. Select one indicator for further analysis, and consider the dimensions 
that might impact that indicator.
 
 This is where your business acumen comes in. While you can explore 
your KPI by any dimension in your cube, it helps to target those you 
think may have some impact.
 
 Dimensions that are fairly common across industries (aside from some 
semantics) and also highly useful for analysis include the following:
 
• Geography: Country, region, state, city, zip code
 
• Business organization: Division, business unit, line of business, 
manager, employee
 
• Time: Sales date; accounting date by year, quarter, month, and day
 
 Because we are looking at sales amount, we are interested in seeing how 
performance is spread across sales territories. This tells us whether we 
have to resolve sales issues across the whole enterprise, or whether we 
can focus on a few or only one territory.
 
2. If the dimension you want to analyze is already in your grid, drill 
down for a more detailed look. If not, drill down to the dimension you 
identified in Step 1.
 
 For instructions on how to drill down or drill down to, see Chapter 16.
 
 Our grid is showing sales amount, sales amount quota, and the variance 
of these measures by the dimension Employee Department. That might 
be interesting to explore. But our objective is not to necessarily address 
issues at the individual employee level (we’ll leave that to the regional 
sales managers), but rather to monitor performance at a regional or ter-
ritory level. So if we drill down to Sales Territory, our grid now looks like 
Figure 15-14.
 
Figure 15-14: 
Looking 
at the KPI 
(Sales 
Amount) by 
the chosen 
dimension 
(Sales 
Territory). 

302
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
3. Identify the rows of your grid that show the worst performance.
 
 Our grid is at the top level of Sales Territory. To get some more detailed 
information, we expand the top level to see the country dimension mem-
bers, as shown in Figure 15-15 (for more information on expanding, see 
Chapter 16).
 
Figure 15-15: 
Drilling 
down 
on Sales 
Territory 
to get to 
countries.
 
 
 Expanding Sales Territory, we can see that the sales amount variance for 
Europe, at 40.79% below budget, and then the United Kingdom, at 59.30% 
below budget, looks extremely low. Even though our overall variance 
from budget was –15.95%, as we drill down and stratify the data, we can 
see areas that are contributing more to poor performance than others. 
So, should we close the UK sales region? Not so quickly.
 
 We know that this report is showing sales data for a certain amount of 
time, but we aren’t exactly sure what time frame we are viewing. By drill-
ing down to calendar year, as shown in Figure 15-16, we can see that the 
data represents four years, 2001–2004, and more importantly, we can 
see that the UK’s variance from budget is improving over the course of 
those years. Given that for the current year, the variance from budget is 
much lower than we thought (–42.3%) and that trends are getting better, 
we will not close the UK sales region and we will not yell at the UK sales 
manager for doing a lousy job (yet).
 
Figure 15-16: 
Expanding 
years to 
look at 
trends.
 
 
4. Make decisions, take action, and reassess your plan.
 
 We will work with the UK office to explore what its staff has been doing 
to meet its goals and reassess whether the business process is work-
ing. We might also consider that in the next planning cycle, we should 

303
 Chapter 15: Discovering Your Business Performance with Dashboards
include a KPI that represents the decrease in sales amount variance 
from prior year, because we find that just looking at variance of actual 
to budget doesn’t necessarily give us the full picture we need to make 
business decisions. Thus, we would be moving on to the next phases of 
the business performance management cycle — taking action and reas-
sessing the plan.
Predicting future trends with trend analysis charts
If hindsight is 20/20, foresight must be, what, at least 30/30? Analyzing his-
toric data to monitor performance is extremely powerful, and the majority 
of business performance reports focus on this method of analysis. But only 
having historical data to look at leaves you having to guess or infer what 
might happen in the future if you don’t change course. Now if your data is 
very linear, that is, the points of the data follow a straight line, it is easy to 
imagine what the future trend might look like — just follow the line.
But you know that data is not often as simple or linear as that. Most busi-
nesses have at least some sort of seasonal variation, or peaks and valleys, in 
their business performance data.
Predictive analytics, or statistical analysis of data to predict future trends, is 
not new. Many industries regularly incorporate highly complex statistical 
analyses into their business analyses (risk management, underwriting, pric-
ing, and so on). But what is new is that PerformancePoint now extends the 
benefits of predictive analytics to a whole new audience — you. And it does 
so in a very simple and straightforward way: through trend analysis charts, 
as shown in Figure 15-17.
 
Figure 15-17: 
Predicting 
future 
trends with 
a trend 
analysis 
chart.
 
These graphs show you how your KPIs will continue to perform over speci-
fied time periods, given how your KPIs have performed in the past. To ana-
lyze your trend analysis chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Identify the historical versus the future chart points.
 
 The historical points are blue, and the predicted points are red.

304
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
 In Figure 15-17, we are looking at a trend of sales amount over calendar 
semesters (half-years) for all our sales territories. The first six points (in 
blue on an actual trend analysis chart) represent the historical data of 
six half-years from 2002 to 2004, and the report is forecasting three half-
years going forward. This information was set by our report developer.
 
2. Use the dashboard filter to select a specific dimension member.
 
 For more information on using dashboard filters, see Chapter 17.
 
 The dashboard filter at the top of our chart allows us to view the trend 
analysis by all our sales territories, any combination, or just one at a 
time. If we filter on just UK, we can view the predicted future trends for 
the next three periods, based on how the UK has been performing for 
the last six periods.
 
3. Follow your future trend points, and see how they match your 
expected goals.
 
 You can see on this chart that our UK sales may have some seasonal 
fluctuations. Looking forward, UK sales seem to be at least holding 
steady, but not significantly rising.
 
 So, if we take this analysis in conjunction with some other information 
we have discovered with other reports on the dashboard (see the sec-
tions “Identifying issues in a scorecard” and “Digging deeper for the 
source of the issue,” earlier in this chapter), we can see the following:
 
• The UK is not meeting its budgetary sales goal.
 
 but . . .
 
• Sales have been increasing over the past couple of years.
 
 and . . .
 
• Sales could continue to increase over the next couple of periods, 
or at least they should hold steady.
 
 However . . .
 
• Sales will still not meet their goal for our predicted semesters, 
although the numbers are getting closer.
 
4. Make decisions, take action, and reassess your plan.
 
 So, even if sales increase, they will not likely increase quickly enough 
to meet goals for the next three periods. So, we won’t give the UK the 
Region of the Year Award, but neither will we shut them down. Instead, 
we will work with the regional sales manager to focus on the processes 
that are improving the region’s sales and perhaps build upon them. 
In terms of planning, we might also consider changing our sales goals 
over the next couple of periods in line with what is a more likely annual 
increase in sales, rather than setting the budgetary expectation that 
improvements will happen immediately.

305
 Chapter 15: Discovering Your Business Performance with Dashboards
 
While it is important to set goals high, it is also important that the scorecard 
that monitors business performance be a trustworthy and realistic source of 
successes and failures: Your scorecard must set the proper expectations.
Understanding how KPIs impact each other with strategy maps
KPIs aren’t necessarily mutually exclusive; they can impact each other in a 
cause-and-effect or lagging-versus-leading sort of way. This means that you 
will see a change in a leading (or causal) KPI before you see that same change 
in a lagging (or affected) KPI.
Business users are often looking at lagging KPIs as the primary metrics of 
their business performance management process for two primary reasons:
 
✓ They are typically the metrics that most directly impact the company’s 
bottom line.
 
✓ They are the metrics that are easiest to capture.
For example, sales amount would likely be considered a lagging indicator, 
because a future change in sales amount could be predicted by these other 
KPIs:
 
✓ High turnover in your sales force might cause sales amount to go down 
during a future time period.
 
✓ Increase in sales training might cause sales amount to go up in a future 
time period.
While monitoring sales amount is useful — it directly impacts your company’s 
bottom line — if you can identify the KPIs that impact sales amount, or any 
other important KPI, and monitor the performance of those leading indicators, 
you can make business decisions sooner that can change a negative course.
And this is where PerformancePoint comes in handy yet again. The primary 
objective of a strategy map is to show you at a glance your company’s over-
all strategy. That’s useful but not particularly actionable. However, a very 
actionable by-product is that a strategy map shows you at a glance how your 
KPIs are related to each other. Hence, if one of your leading indicators starts 
to show a performance issue, you’ll get a good idea of how that impact will 
flow to your other more-lagging KPIs.
A strategy map, like the one shown in Figure 15-5, provides a picture of the 
following:
 
✓ The status of all your KPIs using color coding for each KPI shape: Red is 
bad, yellow is borderline, and green is good.
 
✓ How KPIs are associated to each other: Arrows point from leading KPIs 
to lagging KPIs.

306
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
To analyze a strategy map, follow these steps:
 
1. Identify the yellow or red KPI shapes.
 
 The KPI shapes in Figure 15-5 show the following for a given time period:
 
• Turnover rate KPI (bottom left) is red — bad.
 
• Sales training ratio KPI (bottom right) is yellow — borderline.
 
• Sales amount KPI (top) is green — good.
 
2. Follow the arrows from your red or yellow shapes to see which KPIs 
they impact.
 
 This example shows that because both employee turnover rate and 
sales training ratio are not meeting performance goals, we can expect 
that at some point, this will affect how the sales amount measures up 
against its goal.
 
3. Make decisions, take action, and reassess the plan.
 
 Using the knowledge we’ve just gained, we know that we shouldn’t just 
depend on the status of sales amount, the lagging indicator. Even though 
this metric most directly impacts the bottom line, we can see that if we 
don’t change course for the leading indicators, our sales amount could 
be in trouble. In this case, we will work with both Human Resources and 
Training to address the staff turnover and training issues, particularly in 
reference to the plan.
 
The point of the preceding examples is not that making business decisions 
and enforcing changes within an organization are easy. The point is that if 
you even want to get to the point where you can make decisions, you need 
the proper information when and in the manner you need to get it. And that is 
what PerformancePoint provides.

Chapter 16
Analyzing Your Business Reports
In This Chapter
▶ Reporting what you need
▶ Drilling, expanding, and showing detail to get to the most meaningful data
I
f you love getting and sorting through stacks of paper reports or spread-
sheets long after you could have really used them, if you love calling your 
IT department every time you need a report and waiting days for turnaround, 
and if you love scrambling at the last minute to get your management reports 
ready for presentation, you are going to hate PerformancePoint. If not, you 
are in luck. PerformancePoint is going to give you not only all the manage-
ment information you need but also the ability to analyze, export, print, and 
present that information, easily and when you need to.
One of the reasons you’ve been getting those stacks of paper is that so 
many ways exist to look at the same numbers, that is, there are so many 
dimensions by which you want to see the KPIs or metrics that impact your 
business. Dimensions are attributes that define your business structure 
(like geography, line of business, or sales organization) or time (like sales, 
accounting, or reporting date). And even within each of these dimensions, 
you find levels or hierarchies of information (like country/state/city or 
reporting year/month/day). Wouldn’t it be nice if you could view your data 
by the dimensions and levels that you want without having to sift through 
everyone else’s stuff? Of course it would. And yes, now you can.
In this chapter, you review how you get to your dashboard, what you see 
when you are there, and how to get what you need from your reports.

308
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Understanding Analytical Methods
Your supervisor just walked into your office. Sales in the Northeast are down 
and he wants to know why, and he has to make a presentation on the topic 
in just a couple of hours — so the scramble begins. The month-end finan-
cial statements need to be assembled, and no one goes home until they are 
ready for tomorrow’s presentation to the CEO — so the scramble continues. 
All this time spent putting together reports, and you missed the fact that 25 
percent of your customers closed their accounts in the last month in one of 
your regions and you have no idea why; in fact, you didn’t even realize that a 
problem existed. Not having the right information where and when you need 
it puts your company, and possibly your job, at risk.
But now with PerformancePoint, you have a real business intelligence and 
performance management system right in front of you. No more scrambling 
for information, no more not knowing why something is happening, and no 
more not knowing that it happened. PerformancePoint empowers you by pre-
senting current business information and gives you the tools to analyze these 
metrics, identifying trends, anomalies, and issues in time to take corrective 
action. In fact, Microsoft should have named the tool EmPowerPoint.
PerformancePoint analytics empower you to find the “what” and answer the 
“why.” It helps you do the following things:
 
✓ View your data at higher and lower levels of a business hierarchy: 
This is called drilling up and collapsing (higher) and drilling down and 
expanding (lower). You may be looking at a KPI by reporting year, but 
you want to see it by reporting month, so drill down or expand. You 
may be looking at a KPI by salesperson, but you want to see it for that 
whole sales division, so drill up or collapse. For more details, see the 
sections “Viewing lower levels by expanding and collapsing your data” 
and “Honing in on lower levels of data by drilling up and down,” later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ View your report by any number of dimensions in columns or rows, 
or x and y chart axes: This is called slicing or drilling down to. Slicing 
your data allows you to view your KPIs by any combination of busi-
ness dimensions by adding or removing dimensions from your view. 

309
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
Drilling down to differs from regular drilling down in that with this 
method, you can go from your current view at any level of a business 
hierarchy to an entirely different hierarchy, but maintain the filter of 
where you were.
 
 Perhaps you have drilled down on your geography hierarchy from U.S. 
to New Jersey (go Jersey!), and you are interested in looking at the detail 
of New Jersey by line of business. You can now either add line of busi-
ness as an extra dimension (slicing, keeping state and line of business 
in your view) or you can drill from New Jersey to line of business (drill 
down to, maintaining state as a filter but replacing it in your view by 
line of business). Either way, you arrive at the same result but with a 
different view — it just depends on what you want to see. Also, you can 
pivot your report by moving your row data into your columns and your 
column data into your rows (or flipping your x and y axes). See the sec-
tions “Changing your report dimensions with slicing and dicing” later in 
this chapter and in Chapter 17.
 
✓ View the transaction details that are feeding your KPIs: This is drill-
ing to detail, and it allows you to see the detail of what is happening 
beneath the surface of your dashboard or report, to see the trans-
actional records that are feeding your metrics. This allows you to 
see where issues may be in your organization but also the specific 
details of what might be contributing to those issues. See the section 
“Drilling through your summary report to get to the detail records” 
later in this chapter.
Learning What Your Reports Can Do
PerformancePoint offers so many different kinds of reports, and they don’t 
all have the same analytical capabilities. That is, not all of them allow you to 
drill up, drill down, slice, dice, filter, sort, and so on. So instead of having you 
sit in front of a report wondering why you can’t get it to do what you want, 
we’ve already done that for you. Take a look at Table 16-1 to make sure that 
your report type can actually do what you want (Y means yes and S means 
sometimes, to be explained in subsequent sections).

 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
Viewing lower levels by expanding 
and collapsing your data
Expanding and collapsing allow you to look at a row or column member at a 
lower level of detail, but keep the rest of the report that you are viewing as 
is. But you cannot expand or collapse on just any row of data; you can only 
expand and collapse on what is called a hierarchy.
Hierarchies are prebuilt into your data cube by your IT developer. They are 
sets of related attributes that can show different levels of a business dimen-
sion. For example:
 
✓ Organization hierarchy might contain Division➪Business Unit➪Line of 
Business

Expanding and collapsing with analytics grids, 
pivot tables, and charts (and scorecards)
The following example shows you how to expand and collapse on an analyt-
ics grid, but the technique is the same on pivot tables and charts as well. 
Expanding in a scorecard is discussed later in this section. To expand/col-
lapse a dimension value for lower-level detail, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the dimension member cell you want to expand.
 
 Your reporting options menu opens, as shown in Figure 16-1.
 
Figure 16-1: 
Your cell’s 
reporting 
options

Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
 In the Figure 16-1, we have a report of sales amount and gross profit 
margin (our KPIs or measures) with All Products in the rows and 
Calendar Years in the columns (the dimensions, or attributes by which 
we want to view the KPIs or measures).
 
 From this view, you can see that in 2001, we had a sales amount of 
$8,065,435 and a gross profit margin of 4.08%, and although the sales 
amount almost tripled in 2002, the gross profit margin dipped to 1.34%. 
Sales are up — good. Margins are down — not as good.
 
 If we could look at this information by product lines, we might get a 
clearer picture of where these changes are happening, thus directing us 
to potential business decisions or actions for affected product lines, or 
to further analysis by product line.
 
 So in this case, we right-click the All Products cell.
 
2. Select Expand from the options menu.
 
 If this is a pivot table, select Expand Items.
 
 Figure 16-2 shows the report expanded from All Products. Now you can 
see the detail records below All Products along with the top level to 
include the following:
 
• Accessories
 
• Bikes
 
• Clothing
 
• Components
Now we can look at the changes in the gross profit margin by product line 
and find the specific product categories or subcategories where the margin is 
dropping.

 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
And, we can continue to expand until we come to the end of the hierarchy.
To collapse your report back to All Products follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click a top line/summary cell.
 
 In Figure 16-3, we right-click All Products. The reporting options menu 
opens.
 
Figure 16-3: 
The All 
Products

menu.
 
 
2. Select Collapse from the reporting options menu.
 
 If this is a pivot table, select Collapse Items.
 
 Now the report is rolled back up to the All Products level, as shown in 
Figure 16-1.
 
In addition to the expand/collapse method described here, analytics grids, 
pivot tables, and scorecards also allow you to expand and collapse by click-
ing the plus and minus signs next to the row or column values that can be 
expanded or collapsed, as follows:
 
1. To expand the data, click the plus sign to the left of the level you want 
to expand.
 
 You can see the plus sign to the left of All Products in Figure 16-1.
 
2. To collapse the data, click the minus sign next to the level you want to 
collapse.
 
 You can see the minus sign to the left of All Products in Figure 16-2.
Expanding and collapsing with ProClarity grids
ProClarity grids work a little differently than the PerformancePoint reports. 
They typically default to drill down, not to expand. If you see a little arrow to 
the left of a value and you click it, you will drill down, not expand. To expand 
or collapse in a ProClarity grid, follow these steps:

314
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
1. To expand, click the dimension member cell you want to expand.
 
 You can expand if your value is part of a prebuilt hierarchy signified by 
a down arrow to the left of the value.
 
 A reporting menu pops up. Figure 16-4 represents a ProClarity grid with 
a menu of cell options shown through a PerformancePoint dashboard.
 
Figure 16-4:

a ProClarity 
grid in a

2. Select Expand from the menu.
 
 You can now see your data at the top level from which you expanded, as 
well as the lower-level members.
 
 In Figure 16-5, we have selected Expand on the All Products category. 
Now we can see the detail records below All Products along with the top 
level to include the following:
 
• Accessories
 
• Bikes
 
• Clothing
 
• Components
 
Figure 16-5:

315
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
 
3. To collapse to the higher level, click the cell that you want to collapse 
back to.
 
 You can only collapse on a cell that’s been expanded.
 
 A menu opens. Figure 16-6 shows the reporting options menu with the 
Collapse option.
 
Figure 16-6: 
Collapsing 
a ProClarity 
grid in a

4. Select Collapse from the reporting options menu.
 
 You can now see your data back at the collapsed level, as shown in 
Figure 16-4.
 
If your ProClarity report has been set to default to expand/collapse, you will 
see a plus sign to the left of the value you want to expand (or a minus sign to 
the left of the value you want to collapse). If this is the case, click the plus or 
minus sign to expand or collapse, as described in the previous section.
Honing in on lower levels of data 
by drilling up and down
Do you know why monthly and quarterly reports are so voluminous? People 
aren’t looking at that many metrics. Rather, it is because different people 
in your organization need to see those metrics by a large number of dimen-
sions, and at varying levels of detail for those dimensions.
PerformancePoint consolidates all this information into a much smaller 
number of reports that you can manipulate to get specifically at the informa-
tion you need. And this is where drilling down and up comes in handy.
Drilling down is the best invention since sliced bread. (Actually, sliced 
bread doesn’t thrill us — but drilling down does.) This method allows 
you to look at the lower levels of detail that you are interested in using 

316
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
prebuilt hierarchies. (See some examples of hierarchies in the section 
“Viewing lower levels by expanding and collapsing your data,” earlier in 
this chapter.)
Drilling up and down with analytics grids 
and charts and pivot charts
The following method for drilling up and down works with analytics grids, 
charts, and pivot charts.
To drill up and down, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the dimension member cell, bar, line, or pie-chart slice you 
want to drill down on.
 
 The reporting options menu for an analytics grid or chart is shown in 
Figure 16-3.
 
 In the example shown in Figure 16-7, we have an analytics bar chart that 
represents sales amount by product line.
 
Figure 16-7: 
Drilling 
down on an 
analytics 
bar chart.
 
 
 The Bikes category had sales of more than $65 million — the product 
line with the highest sales amount. If we want to see more information 
on sales within the Bikes product line, we can drill down to the next 
level of detail.
 
2. Right-click the Bikes bar to reveal the reporting options menu shown 
in Figure 16-8.

317
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
 
Figure 16-8: 
A reporting 
options 
menu on an 
analytics 
bar chart.
 
 
3. Select Drill Down from this menu.
 
 If this is a pivot chart, select Drill Into. Now you can see your bar chart 
at the next-lowest level of detail in the hierarchy.
 
 When we drill down on Bikes, we are presented with a bar for every item 
within Bikes, as shown in Figure 16-9:
 
• Mountain Bikes
 
• Road Bikes
 
• Touring Bikes
 
Figure 16-9: 
Drilling 
down on an 
analytics 
bar chart.
 

318
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 if necessary to get to the hierarchy level you want.
 
5. To drill back up, right-click any bar in your report and select Drill Up 
from the reporting options menu.
 
 If this is a pivot chart, select Drill Out.
 
 You should see your report as it looked right before you drilled down. 
In this case, if we drill up from the Road Bikes bar, as shown in Figure 
16-10, we are taken back to the Bikes bar chart shown in Figure 16-7.
 
Figure 16-10: 
Selecting 
any bar 
for drilling 
back up.
 
 
In addition to the Drill Down method described here, you can also drill down 
on analytics grids with a double-click method and charts with a single click, 
as follows:
 
1. Select the item:
 
• For grids, double-click the dimension member cell that you want to 
drill down on.
 
• For charts, click the bar, line, or pie slice you want to drill down on.
 
 When we click the Bikes bar in Figure 16-7, we get the same results as 
shown in Figure 16-9.
 
2. To drill back up, right-click any bar in your report and select Drill Up 
from the reporting options menu.
 
 You should see your report as it looked right before you drilled down.

319
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
Drilling up and down with ProClarity grids and charts
ProClarity reports surfaced through PerformancePoint work a little differ-
ently than the analytics grids and charts. Instead of right-clicking a dimension 
member cell, bar, line, or pie slice to access a reporting options menu, just 
click the dimension member cell, bar, line, or pie slice, as follows:
 
1. Click the cell, bar, line, or pie slice you want to drill down on.
 
 Figure 16-11 shows the same report shown in Figure 16-7 but created in 
ProClarity instead of in an analytics chart, and it’s a pie chart instead of 
a bar chart.
 
Figure 16-11: 
Drilling 
down on a 
ProClarity 
pie chart.
 
 
2. Select Drill Down from the reporting options menu.
 
 When we click the Bikes slice, we are presented with a reporting 
options menu (like the one shown in Figure 16-6), and we select Drill 
Down. Now we can see the pie chart divided into three slices, as shown 
in Figure 16-12:
 
• Mountain Bikes
 
• Road Bikes
 
• Touring Bikes

320
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
Figure 16-12:

pie chart 
that’s been

 Because Road Bikes is the biggest slice, you may want to look at that in a 
lower level of detail.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 as needed.
 
4. To drill back up, click any pie slice and select Drill Up from the report 
options menu.
 
 When we click the largest slice, Road Bikes, and select Drill Up, as 
shown in Figure 16-13, we can see the pie in slices by product, as shown 
in Figure 16-11.
 
Figure 16-13: 
Clicking a 
pie slice to 
open the

321
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
 
In addition to the Drill Down method for ProClarity, you can also drill down 
and up on ProClarity grids using the down and up arrows to the left of dimen-
sion values, as follows:
 
1. Click the arrow to the left of the dimension member to drill down.
 
 You now no longer see the dimension member you drilled down from, 
but rather all the dimension members that are one level below that on 
the dimension hierarchy.
 
 When we click the down arrow to the left of All Products, as shown in 
Figure 16-14, we no longer see All Products.
 
 You can also click the down arrow to the left of the column header All 
Periods to drill down on the time hierarchy.
 
Figure 16-14: 
Using the up 
and down 
arrows in a 
ProClarity 
grid. 
 
 Now we can see sales amount by accessories, bikes, clothing, and com-
ponents, as shown in Figure 16-15.
 
Figure 16-15: 
Drilling 
down 
in your 
ProClarity 
grid.
 
 
2. To drill back up, click the up arrow on your grid.
 
 If you are drilling up on rows, the up arrow will be at the upper left of 
the first column, right above the first dimension member, as shown in 
Figure 16-15. If you are drilling up from columns, the up arrow will be at 
the upper right of the first column, just to the left of your first column 
dimension member.

322
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Determining your own path by drilling 
down to new dimensions
Certainly a limitation of drilling up and down is that someone else has 
decided what you can drill up and down on by setting up hierarchies in your 
Analysis Services cube (see Chapter 9). Often these hierarchies are very 
useful. For example, the ability to drill up and down on a time dimension 
(year to quarter to month) or organizational dimension (division, business 
unit, or line of business) is ubiquitously informative. But sometimes you as 
the analyst are drawn down a differing path, either based on something you 
see in the data or something you know.
For example, we might be drilling down on the organizational hierarchy 
(Business Unit➪Line of Business) and see that our sales are very low within a 
particular line of business. But we need to know more about the line of busi-
ness: Do the sales results vary (some good, some low) depending on another 
attribute within this line of business? That is, did something happen in a 
particular dimension (for example, geography or sales team) to cause sales 
to drop within this line of business? Now, do we have to open a whole new 
report to investigate? No, we don’t. We can drill down to geography from the 
troublesome line of business that we are viewing. In doing so, we are using 
our business knowledge to drive the analysis.
This is yet another place where PerformancePoint gives you an analytical 
edge, by giving you the power to direct your analysis where you want to go.
To drill from one dimension to another in an analytical grid or chart, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click a dimension member cell, bar, line, or pie slice from which 
you want to drill to another dimension.
 
 In Figure 16-16, an analytical grid shows sales amount by product line. 
When we right-click the Bikes dimension member cell, the reporting 
options menu opens.
 
2. Select Drill Down To from the reporting options menu.
 
 You can now see a list of all the dimensions in your cube.
 
 When we select Drill Down To, we are shown another menu of all the 
dimensions in the Adventure Works cube, as shown in Figure 16-16.
 
3. Select the dimension you want to drill down to.
 
 Another menu of the dimension attributes appears.
 
 We want to select the Date dimension so that we can see bike sales by 
calendar year hierarchy. In Figure 16-17, we are presented with another 
menu of the attributes within the Date dimension.

324
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
4. Select the dimension attribute you want to drill down to.
 
 The dimension that you started from in your row or column is replaced 
in your report view with the dimension attribute you have drilled down 
to. However, the report maintains your original dimension member as a 
report filter.
 
 We select Calendar Year from the list of Date attributes. The product 
line members that were in our rows are no longer visible. They have 
been replaced by calendar years, as shown in Figure 16-18. Yet if we 
add up the total sales amount for the report, it is $66,302,381. If we look 
back at Figure 16-2, the report prior to the Drill Down To action, we 
can see that this amount is equal to the sales amount for Bikes. This 
is because now we are looking at a report of sales amount by calendar 
year for Bikes only.
 
Figure 16-18: 
Viewing 
your Drilled 
Down To 
report.
 
 
Drill Down To in an analytics grid can also be used to slice and dice, or to 
change the dimensions at the top level of analysis. For more on this, see the 
next section.
 
Be careful:
 
• After you use Drill Down To in a report, no reporting option exists 
within PerformancePoint for backing up to prior views. That is, no 
Drill Back Up To or Drill Up From reporting menu choice exists.
 
• You can’t just refresh one report zone at a time. If you want to 
refresh one report, you are going to refresh them all.
To refresh your report to its original view, click the Refresh button on 
Internet Explorer’s toolbar or press F5 on your keyboard. (The Refresh 
button is shown in Figure 16-19.) Your entire dashboard, not just one zone, 
will be refreshed to the original view.

Changing your report dimensions 
with slicing and dicing
The goal of a PerformancePoint dashboard is to give you most of the infor-
mation you need at a glance, and then to allow you some interactivity to 
get to the specific pieces of data that you need to do your job and manage 
your business performance. But sometimes what you see in your dashboard 
reports is just not the right information you need — you need to see different 
dimensions and measures than you have been given. Changing the dimen-
sions and attributes in a report is called slicing and dicing.
If you need to perform a significant amount of slicing and dicing, or changing 
the dimensions and measures in your report, you have three options ranging 
in analytical prowess:
 
✓ Most powerful: Use ProClarity Web or Desktop Professional to perform 
your analysis.
 
✓ Powerful: Use a pivot table or chart report for your analysis.
 
✓ Less powerful but still good: Use an analytic grid or chart for your report.
Currently, ProClarity Web, Desktop Professional, or even the ProClarity 
Analytics Server is a better bet for true slicing and dicing than anything avail-
able in PerformancePoint (see Chapter 1 for more information on this topic). 
That said, PerformancePoint provides some slicing and dicing functionality 
through its analytics grid and charts and more so through its pivot table and 
chart types.

326
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Changing dimensions and measures with analytics charts and grids
To change your report dimensions within an analytics chart or grid, you need 
to leverage the Drill Down To reporting option. As you may have read in the 
section “Determining your own path by drilling down to new dimensions,” 
earlier in this chapter, you know that you can drill down to another dimen-
sion attribute or hierarchy from any dimension member in your current 
report. But if you just want to switch out the dimension you are looking at 
without any report filters, just use the Drill Down To function from the report 
total or All dimension member.
To change your analytic report dimensions, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the All dimension member (cell, bar, line, pie slice) in 
your report.
 
 Figure 16-20 shows a grid report of sales amount by all products also 
expanded to include the next level of the product hierarchy. When we 
right-click the All Products member cell, the reporting options menu 
opens.
 
2. Select Drill Down To from the reporting options menu.
 
 A list of cube dimensions displays, as shown in Figure 16-20. We select 
Date.
 
Figure 16-20: 
Slicing and 
dicing in an 
analytics 
grid.
 

327
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
 
3. Click the dimension that you want to change.
 
 We want to slice the sales amount by calendar year, not by product line. 
So we select Calendar Year from the reporting options menu, as shown 
in Figure 16-20.
 
4. Click the attribute or hierarchy that you want to change.
 
 Your original report dimension is now replaced with the new dimension 
you have chosen.
 
 In this case, we select the Calendar Year attribute. Now, our report 
shows sales amount by calendar year. See Figure 16-21.
 
Figure 16-21: 
Seeing the 
report by 
calendar 
year.
 
Certainly a limitation of this report type for slicing and dicing is that you 
can only switch or slice and dice by the number of dimensions that your 
report has. If you only have one dimension, you can only change to one other 
dimension. If you have two, you can only switch to two, and so on.
Changing or selecting different measures for your report is very simple if you 
have been given a drop-down filter menu with a list of your measures (for 
more information, see Chapter 3). This might look like the drop-down menu 
shown in Figure 16-22, or the drop-down menu might allow you to select 
more than one value at a time.
In this example, we want to change the measures in the grid shown in Figure 
16-22 with Order Quantity.
To change the measures in the report, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the arrow to the right of the Measures drop-down menu.
 
 All your measures are displayed.
 
2. Select the measure you want to display in your report.
 
 In this case, we select Order Quantity. Now the report shows All 
Products with Order Quantity as the measure, as shown in Figure 16-23.

Changing dimensions and measures in pivot tables and charts
One of the best things about pivot tables and charts is that they allow you 
to change any measure or dimension at will, regardless of how your report 
developer set it up. They are very flexible, so if you are a power user, this is a 
great report type for you to be working with.
Because pivot tables and charts slice and dice a little differently, we give you 
an example of each.
To slice and dice your pivot table, follow these steps:
 
1. Access your pivot table field list by clicking its icon on the Pivot Table 
or Pivot Chart toolbar, as shown in Figure 16-24.

329
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
 
Figure 16-24: 
Accessing 
your 
dimension 
and 
measure 
choices 
from the 
pivot report 
field list.
 
 
 Your pivot report field list opens in another window and shows you all 
your dimensions and measures.
 
 If you first want to remove an existing dimension or measure from your 
pivot report field list, follow these steps:
 
a. Right-click the field name within the pivot report.
 
 In Figure 16-25, we want to remove Calendar Year as the row 
dimension from the pivot table before we replace it with another 
dimension from the field list. A reporting options menu opens.
 
Figure 16-25: 
Removing 
an existing 
dimension 
from the 
pivot table.
 
 
b. From the reporting options menu, select Remove Field.
 
 The item that you selected is no longer visible on your report, as 
shown in Figure 16-26.

330
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
Figure 16-26: 
Seeing the 
new pivot

 To remove an item from a pivot chart, you can follow the previous steps, 
but the field items for dimensions are in a different location on the chart, 
and measures are along the top, as shown in Figure 16-27.
 
Figure 16-27:

2. To add a new dimension to the report, click the dimension you want 
to be on the field list.
 
 In Figure 16-28, we select Product Model Category.

3. At the bottom of the field list, choose Row Area from the pivot table 
drop-down menu and click the Add To button.
 
 We choose Row Area from our Add To menu selection, as shown in 
Figure 16-28.
 
The drop-down menu on the pivot table field list contains a list of places to 
which we can send our dimension or measure:
 
✓ Row: Add this field to your grid rows.
 
✓ Column: Add this field to your grid columns.
 
✓ Filter: Add this field to your filter area for drop-down selection.
 
✓ Data: Add this field to your grid measures.
The drop-down menu on our pivot chart field list contains a slightly different 
list of places to which we can send our dimension or measure:
 
✓ Series: Use this field as your chart series.
 
✓ Category: Use this field as your x-axis categorization.
 
✓ Filter: Add this field to your chart filter area for drop-down selection.
 
✓ Data: Use this field as your chart measure(s).

332
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Drilling through your summary report 
to get to the detail records
So, you’ve sliced and diced and drilled down as low as you can go, but you 
just don’t have the smoking gun, the record that tells you where your busi-
ness performance is suffering.
Multidimensional cube analysis is great for looking at summary data, for slic-
ing and dicing at a summary level, and for looking at trends of summary data 
over time. But you may reach a point in your analysis when you just need to 
see the detail records behind the summary data. And this is where drilling 
through or showing your detail records comes in handy.
Show Details is a report option that you can execute from any noncalculated 
measure cell, which allows you to see the detail records that make up the 
totals of that measure cell.
Showing your detail with analytics grids, charts, and scorecards
To show detail records with analytics grids, charts, or scorecards, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Right-click any measure cell, bar, line, or pie slice to open the report-
ing options menu.
 
2. Select Show Details from this menu.
 
 In Figure 16-29, we right-click the sales amount for the Road-150 road 
bike. We select Show Details, and the detail report opens in a new 
window.
 
Figure 16-29: 
Showing 
your detail 
records in

333
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
 
 You can export the detail records to Excel by clicking the Export To 
Excel icon in the upper-left corner of your window. You are prompted to 
open or save the detail records as an Excel workbook.
 
 You can see the Export To Excel icon in Figure 16-29. Your report is 
exported to Excel, as shown in Figure 16-30.
 
Figure 16-30:

Drilling to detail with ProClarity grids and charts
Again, ProClarity reports work a little differently. To show detail records with 
ProClarity grids and charts, follow these steps:
 
1. Click any measure cell, bar, line, or pie slice to open the reporting 
options menu.
 
2. Select Drill to Detail from this menu.
 
 In Figure 16-31, we click the sales amount for the Road-150 Red, 62 road 
bike. When the reporting options menu opens, we select Drill To Detail 
and can then see the details in the new Drill To Detail window.
 
Figure 16-31:

334
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
 
If you have a large volume (that is, more than a couple thousand) of detail 
records, it could take a bit of time to see all those records in a detail window. 
But more to the point, why would you want to? Drilling to detail should be 
reserved as the path of last resort, that is, you have drilled down as far as you 
can go and now need a small (fewer than 100) list of the detail records. If you 
need access to larger numbers of detail data, you have better ways to get it. 
But think about what your needs really are. For example, if you want detail 
records so that you can do your own pivot table analysis in Excel, connect to 
the cube directly from Excel.
 
Business users deeply dislike the way the Drill To Detail window looks in 
ProClarity. It is probably the users’ biggest complaint about the software. The 
titles look very messy — they are just the names of the columns as stored in 
the cube. But you don’t care about that; it’s hard to read and it doesn’t look 
nice. This is where a reporting action report can be very useful. If you want a 
more highly formatted drill-through report, ask your report developer to build 
you a nice Reporting Services report to drill to. Better yet, the Show Details 
window from analytics reports looks much nicer too, so consider asking your 
PPS developer to use these options instead.
If your highlighted cell contains a calculated field — a field that is created as a 
calculation within Analysis Services — you cannot use Show Details from that 
cell. Your options here are as follows:
 
✓ See whether you have another measure in your report that is not a cal-
culated field and try to drill to the details from there.
 
✓ If you are in an analytics or ProClarity report, see whether you have an 
action that allows you to drill to the details (see the next section).
Drilling through PerformancePoint 
for details with reporting actions
Actions typically refer to the launching of non-PerformancePoint reports 
or applications from your PerformancePoint reports. Actions can give you 
access to information that can’t be presented in your PerformancePoint 
report for a number of reasons:
 
✓ The action report data may not be multidimensional.
 
✓ The required format of the action report couldn’t be assembled using 
PerformancePoint options.

335
 Chapter 16: Analyzing Your Business Reports
Reporting actions give you access to an even greater array of information 
and/or formatting styles, but from the perspective of the cell (dimension 
member or measure cell) from which you are launching the action. The 
perspective is the intersection of the cell plus all the report filters already 
applied to your PerformancePoint report.
To access your report actions, follow these steps:
 
1. To see a list of your report actions, right-click a measure cell, bar, line, 
or pie slice in an analytics report. Or, click the dimension member 
cell, measure cell, bar line, or pie slice in a ProClarity report.
 
 The reporting options menu opens.
 
 You may have different actions assigned to measure cells than to dimen-
sion member cells.
 
2. Select Actions.
 
 You see a list of the actions that you can execute from that particular cell.
 
 In Figure 16-32, we right-click the Sales Amount cell and select Additional 
Actions.
 
 In this case, we have an action entitled Drillthrough.
 
Figure 16-32: 
Executing 
reporting 
actions.
 
 
3. Select your action from the Actions menu.
 
 Your action executes.
 
 In this case, the Drillthrough action opens a list of detail records in a 
new window, as shown in Figure 16-29. These detail records aggregate to 
the cell from which we executed the action.

Chapter 17
Organizing, Formatting, and 
Presenting Your Business Reports
In This Chapter
▶ Filtering, sorting, pivoting, and changing your report type to get the most meaningful 
view
▶ Presenting your results in PowerPoint and Excel
▶ Printing your reports and dashboards
O
kay, admit it. You copy data from your company’s reporting system 
into Excel so that you can create your own reports and charts. Do you 
know how we know this? Because most business users of reporting systems 
do this. And do you know why we care? Because you don’t have to. Because 
we want you to spend your time analyzing data, not formatting it.
PerformancePoint allows you to organize and format your reports right in 
the SharePoint environment and to export that perfect report or chart to 
PowerPoint and Excel for presentation. Formatting capabilities include the 
following:
 
✓ Pivoting your report or chart: Pivoting allows you to exchange report 
rows with columns, or chart axes with series.
 
✓ Sorting your data: Sorting allows you to order your data numerically by 
the values of your KPIs (for example, high to low or low to high).
 
✓ Filtering your data: Filtering allows you to limit your view to specified 
dimension or KPI values or ranges within your report (for example, 
Top 10 states by sales amount, or All products with profit margins less 
than 10%).
 
✓ Changing your report type: PerformancePoint allows you to easily 
switch from a grid report to a pie chart to a line chart and back again.

338
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
The combination of these formatting techniques provide you with pretty much 
all you’ll need to create the report that you want. And then, you can export the 
finished product to Excel or PowerPoint to add to a presentation or for printing.
Creating the Report You Want with 
Formatting and Organizing
Leveraging the power of PerformancePoint, you can quickly create the report 
or chart that is most meaningful to you or your other business users. You 
don’t have to call your IT department to create a new report for you. You can 
take what you have and from that, create what you want.
Pivoting your report
Have you ever been looking at a chart and thought This would make a lot more 
sense if it were just switched around a bit, like your measures and dimensions are 
in the wrong place? This often happens when you change an analytics grid to a 
chart — sometimes the measures and dimension end up in the wrong place.
Pivoting your report is a nice quick way to do the following:
 
✓ Get your columns in your rows or your rows in your columns
 
✓ Get your series in your x axis and your x axis in your series
Analytics grids and charts and pivot tables and charts allow you to pivot.
Figure 17-1 shows what is supposed to be a line chart that has sales amount 
on the x axis and y axis, and years as the series. Because the x and y axis are 
the same variable, the line chart displays as a number of single points. If you 
are looking at a line chart, it makes more sense to have years as an x-axis 
attribute so that you can see a series (sales amount) over time.
To pivot your chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any line in your report.
 
 The reporting options menu opens.
 
2. Select Pivot from the reporting options menu.
 
 Your x axis now becomes your series, and your series becomes your x axis.
 
 As you can see from Figure 17-2, years are now on the x axis and sales 
amount is the series. This line chart makes a lot more sense.

Figure 17-1: 
Pivoting a

Figure 17-2:

Pivoting a grid works similarly. Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any cell to open the reporting options menu.
 
2. Select Pivot from the reporting options menu.
 
 In Figure 17-3, we have a grid that shows calendar years and measures in 
rows and product lines in our columns. 
 
 If we want to flip that around to see calendar years and measures (sales 
amount and gross profit margin) in our columns and product lines in 
rows, we right-click any cell and select Pivot from the reporting options 
menu. When we expand the products and calendar year dimensions, the 
grid looks like Figure 17-4.

Putting your data in order with sorting
Did you ever drill down on a report and find hundreds of rows of data in front 
of you? Yikes. It’s very difficult to visually analyze a large number of records 
or bars or lines on a chart. Sorting and filtering are great analytical tools for 
directing your analysis or narrowing what you are looking at to the most 
important or significant pieces of data. Sorting allows you to put your data in 
order, from ascending to descending or vice versa.
Analytics grids, analytics charts, pivot tables, and pivot charts all have sort-
ing capabilities. These PerformancePoint reports allow you to sort your 
measure data in ascending or descending order by a selected measure in a 
selected column. Follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click the measure cell for the measure on which you want to 
base your sorting, and then select Sort from the reporting options 
menu.
 
 You are presented with another menu that gives you the choice to
 
• Sort from largest to smallest

341
 Chapter 17: Organizing, Formatting, and Presenting Your Business Reports
 
• Sort from smallest to largest
 
• Don’t sort (this undoes any existing sorting you have for that 
measure)
 
 In Figure 17-5, we right-click Sales Amount and select Sort from the 
reporting options menu.
 
Figure 17-5: 
Sorting your 
grid by sales 
amount.
 
 
2. Select your desired sort order.
 
 Your report is now sorted according to your specification.
 
 In this case, we select Largest To Smallest, and the report is sorted with 
the highest sales amount at the top, as shown in Figure 17-6.
 
Figure 17-6: 
Viewing 
the sorted 
report.
 
 
When you sort your report, a little up or down arrow appears in the row or 
column you have sorted, as shown in Figure 17-5.
Also, if you drill up or down on report dimensions, the sort continues to apply 
to the report, and the data is continually re-sorted as you drill up or down.
You cannot sort on dimension members.

342
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Limiting your report or dashboard 
data with filtering
Filtering is another great analytical tool for limiting your view to only the 
most important or significant pieces of data. PerformancePoint gives you the 
following ways to use filtering to get at the results you need:
 
✓ You can filter one, some, or all the reports on your dashboard with a 
dashboard filter.
 
✓ You can filter out all empty columns and rows in your reports.
 
✓ You can filter your report by a top or bottom set of values with a report 
filter (limited to pivot tables and pivot charts).
Filtering your dashboard with dashboard filters
Dashboard filters are drop-down selection menus that can be applied by the 
dashboard developer to one or many reports on a dashboard page. They can 
be set up to allow you to do the following:
 
✓ Select only one value
 
✓ Select many values at a time
To select values from your dashboard filter, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the value next to the filter name or the small triangle next to that.
 
 In Figure 17-7, we click the All Products link next to Products in the 
upper-left corner of the dashboard page.
 
Figure 17-7: 
Viewing our 
dashboard 
at the All 
Products 
level.
 

343
 Chapter 17: Organizing, Formatting, and Presenting Your Business Reports
 
 A drop-down filter menu opens as shown in Figure 17-8. Right now, the 
reports on our dashboards are showing All Products, so All Products is 
the only dimension member selected.
 
 In Figure 17-8, we change the selection by deselecting All Products and 
selecting Accessories and Bikes.
 
Figure 17-8: 
Changing 
your

filter.
 
 
2. Select Apply from the lower-right corner of the filter menu.
 
 Your dashboard reflects your filter changes.
 
 Figure 17-9 shows the same dashboard, now filtered just for Accessories 
and Bikes. The grid now has a row for both Accessories and Bikes, and 
the bar chart shows a bar for each as well.

344
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Filtering your pivot tables and pivot charts
Pivot tables and pivot charts give you the most flexibility in terms of native 
sorting functionality. The reporting options provide many filtering selections. 
You can choose a filter for the following:
 
✓ The top x percent — for example, the top 5 percent of employees by 
sales amount
 
✓ The bottom x percent — for example, the bottom 12 percent of products 
by gross profit margin
 
✓ The top x — for example, the top 25 employees by order quantity
 
✓ The bottom x — for example, the bottom three sales territories by vari-
ance in actual to budget sales
To filter your pivot table or pivot chart, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click a measure cell, bar, line, or pie slice.
 
 A reporting options menu opens.
 
2. Select either of the following:
 
• Show only the top
 
• Show only the bottom
 
 Here you see a list of numbers and percentages, as shown in Figure 17-10.
 
Figure 17-10: 
The top and 
bottom filter 
menu.
 
 
3. Select the number or percentage you want to filter by, or select Other 
to customize the filter to your own specifications.
 
 In this case, we want to filter our report for the top 1 calendar year by 
sales amount. We right-click any sales amount measure cell, select Show 

345
 Chapter 17: Organizing, Formatting, and Presenting Your Business Reports
Only the Top, and then choose 1. The report now shows only calendar 
year 2003, as shown in Figure 17-11.

Hiding empty rows and columns in an analytics grid and chart
Empty rows and columns can take up a lot of space on a report, without 
delivering valuable information. Often a report developer will hide empty 
rows and columns for you, but you can do it too.
To hide your empty rows and columns, follow these steps:
 
1. Right-click any cell, bar, line, pie slice, or series value to open the 
reporting options menu.
 
 Figure 17-12 shows an analytics grid with an empty row of data.
 
Figure 17-12: 
An analytics 
grid with an 
empty row.
 
 
2. Select Filter.
 
 Another reporting options menu opens.
 
3. Select Empty Rows and/or Empty Columns.
 
 In this case, we select Empty Rows. Now, the empty row of data is 
removed from the report, as shown in Figure 17-13.

grid filtered

Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Getting the visual you need 
by changing the report style
Some people like numbers, some people like pictures, and sometimes it 
depends on what data you are looking at. Wouldn’t it be nice if you could see 
your report as either a grid or chart, depending on what you want to see? Of 
course it would. And yes, you can. PerformancePoint gives you the flexibility 
to transform your grids to charts and vice versa within your dashboard. Not 
only that, but you can also choose from a nice variety of chart types.
Changing the report style in analytics grids and charts
One of the coolest things about analytic grids and charts is that they are 
interchangeable: If you see your data in a grid but want to change it to a chart 
(and vice versa), you are just a few clicks away. You also have a choice of 
chart types, including the following:
 
✓ Bar chart
 
✓ Stacked bar chart
 
✓ 100% stacked bar chart
 
✓ Pie chart
 
✓ Line chart
 
✓ Line chart with markers
Take a look at the grid shown in Figure 17-14.
 
Figure 17-14: 
This grid 
may look 
better as a 
bar chart.
 
It looks fine as a grid, but we think this particular report would be more 
telling at a glance if it were a bar chart. We want to be able to see more at a 
glance, and if we have a chart with many columns and rows, charts are often 
a better way to achieve that. To make this change, follow these steps:

347
 Chapter 17: Organizing, Formatting, and Presenting Your Business Reports
 
1. Right-click anywhere on the report to access the reporting options 
menu.
 
 This menu is shown in Figure 17-15.
 
Figure 17-15: 
Accessing 
your 
reporting 
options 
menu.
 
 
2. Select Report Type➪Bar Chart (or any other report type you want) 
from the submenu that appears.
 
 This is also where you can change from a chart to a grid. Now your 
report will look like Figure 17-16.
 
Figure 17-16: 
Abraca-
dabra! 
Our grid is 
now a bar

348
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Changing the report style in pivot charts
You can’t change a pivot table to a pivot chart in your dashboard, but you 
can change the chart type on a pivot chart — with many great two- and three-
dimensional options:
 
✓ Columns (vertical bars)
 
✓ Bars (horizontal bars)
 
✓ Lines
 
✓ Smooth lines
 
✓ Pie charts
 
✓ Scatter plots
 
✓ Bubble
 
✓ Area
 
✓ Donut
 
✓ Radar
 
✓ Stock
 
✓ Polar
We must admit, we don’t often veer from the more traditional bars, lines, 
and pies. Once in a while, we go crazy and use smooth lines, like in our trend 
charts. But what is particularly nice (and fun) about changing the chart type in 
a pivot chart is that you can see how your change will affect your chart as you 
browse through your options — it’s like trying on a chart before you buy it.
To change a pivot chart type, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Chart Type icon on the Pivot Chart toolbar.
 
 This icon is shown in Figure 17-17. The Commands And Options menu 
pops up, opening to the Type tab.
 
2. Click the chart type you want to change to.
 
 In the right side of the window, you can see all the chart selections for 
the particular type you have chosen.
 
 In this case, we change the column chart to a line chart. So we select 
Line and are then presented with several line options, also as shown in 
Figure 17-16.
 
3. Click a different chart subtype to get the look you want.
 
 Your chart in the background changes per the new subtype.

349
 Chapter 17: Organizing, Formatting, and Presenting Your Business Reports
 
 In this case, we select a line chart with markers, as shown in Figure 17-16 
and highlighted with a border. As we select the chart subtype, we can 
see the pivot chart behind the menu change. When we decide which 
chart type and subtype we want, we close the menu.
 
4. Click the red X in the upper-right corner of the Commands and 
Options menu to close it and complete your chart type change.
 
 You can now view and analyze your report with the new chart.

Creating Presentations with 
Printing and Export
Analyzing business performance is an essential part of your job, but so is the 
presentation of the results of your analysis. Not only do you have to know 
how your business is performing, but you also often need to communicate 
that information to your managers and/or your team.
Back in the old days, we spent many a late night assembling presentations: 
analyzing data, ascertaining results, typing data into spreadsheets, creating 
charts and grids, copying, pasting, cropping, inserting, printing, and binding. 
Aarrgghh! But those days are over, friend. Ah, the wonders of technology.

350
Part IV: Viewing and Analyzing Your Business Reports 
Now, with a tool like PerformancePoint, we have no more late nights. You can 
easily go from analysis to results to presentation to distribution. You may 
have to do some copying and pasting to consolidate, but it’s a lot easier than 
it used to be.
Exporting your reports
You have the following ways to export your reports and/or assemble a 
presentation:
 
✓ You can export a picture of your report to Excel or PowerPoint.
 
✓ You can export your connection to the cube for further pivot table 
analysis in Excel.
Exporting PerformancePoint reports to Excel or PowerPoint
The following types of reports can be exported to Excel or PowerPoint:
 
✓ Analytics grids and charts
 
✓ Pivot charts
 
✓ Trend analysis charts
 
✓ Scorecards
To export your report to Excel or PowerPoint, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the small triangle in the upper-right corner of your report zone.
 
 A report zone options menu opens. For more information about report 
zones, see Chapter 15.
 
 Figure 17-18 shows a bar chart report named ‘Figure 17-8’. We have clicked 
the small triangle in the upper-right corner of the report zone, and the 
report zone options menu is open. We can choose either of the following:
 
• Export To PowerPoint
 
• Export To Excel
 
2. Select Export To PowerPoint or Export To Excel.
 
 A File Download dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 17-19, and gives 
you the following options:
 
• Open your PowerPoint or Excel presentation
 
• Save your PowerPoint or Excel presentation
 
• Cancel your action

Viewing the PowerPoint report
When we click the Open button, our presentation opens in PowerPoint and 
looks like Figure 17-22.
 
Figure 17-22: 
Viewing our

As you can see in Figure 17-22, the bar chart is now a slide in a new 
PowerPoint presentation with the following features:
 
✓ In the header, a live link to the dashboard exists: PPSDashboard
Figures. If you want to get back to the dashboard page, you have an 
appropriate Internet/intranet connection, and you are in Slide Show 
mode, clicking this link brings you to the dashboard page from which 
you exported this report.
 
✓ Under that is the title or view of the report: Figure 17-8 (you might want 
to come up with a better report name than that).
 
✓ Under that is the date the report was generated: 29/04/2008 (either we 
are working on our London server or we are very sophisticated).
 
✓ Under that are any dashboard filters that have been selected (for more 
information on dashboard filters, see Chapter 17). In this case, we have 
filtered on Accessories and Bikes.
 
✓ And of course, underneath that is the chart itself. Pretty nifty.
Viewing the Excel report
The same report exported to Excel is shown in Figure 17-23.
The same formatting applies in terms of the header — in fact it looks and is 
pretty much the same.

Unfortunately you can only export one report at a time, as opposed to the 
whole dashboard. But you have these options:
 
✓ You can export the reports one at a time and then copy and paste them 
into the same presentation.
 
✓ You can save the dashboard page as an HTML (Web page) or MHT (single-
file Web page) file using the File➪Save As command in Internet Explorer.
 
✓ You can always press Print Screen and paste the results into Paint or a 
similar program.
Exporting pivot tables to Excel for further analysis
Pivot tables give you the added functionality of being able to export the 
actual connection to your data source, allowing you to continue your analy-
sis and formatting in an Excel environment.
To export a pivot table from your dashboard, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the Export To Excel icon on the Pivot Table toolbar.
 
 The icon is shown in Figure 17-24.
 
 Excel launches, as shown in Figure 17-25.
 
2. Enable the data connection by clicking the Options button, which is next 
to the security warning below the toolbar, as shown in Figure 17-25.
 
 If you don’t see a security warning, skip to Step 4.
 
 A Microsoft Office Security Options dialog box opens, as shown in 
Figure 17-26.

Printing your reports
Even with all the soft-copy distribution options available to you (for example, 
analysis, exporting, and e-mail), you may still need to print some reports, for 
yourself or for others in your organization. You have the following options:
 
✓ Print directly from your dashboard site (that is, through Internet 
Explorer)
 
✓ Print from your exported Excel or PowerPoint presentation
You probably already know how to print in Excel and PowerPoint, but if 
you’ve had issues printing from the Web, follow these steps:
 
1. In Internet Explorer, choose File➪Print Preview.
 
 A Print Preview window, like the one shown in Figure 17-28, opens.

• Set the page layout to portrait or landscape
 
• Hide or show report headers and footers
 
• Shrink the image to the printing page or use another custom sizing
 
• Adjust the margins
 
3. Print your document by clicking the Print icon on the toolbar.

Using PerformancePoint Expression 
Language (PEL)
Advanced users of the Planning component who want to work with the 
configuration of business rules and processes may find this book lacking. 
We’ve intentionally tried to keep this book as “code-free” as possible. 
For those of you who can’t wait to step into the rich world of PEL, we 
suggest starting with The Rational Guide to Planning with Microsoft Office 
PerformancePoint Server 2007, by Adrian Downes and Nick Barclay.
Downes and Barclay provide an excellent account of the basic structure and 
composition of PEL. And, their application of PEL to various functions is 
well conceived and useful.
For an even more complete guide to PEL, check out this link provided by 
Microsoft:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb839123.aspx
Working with Advanced Topics
This book is largely intended for users who are new to PPS technology or its 
precursors. As you advance your PPS capabilities, you may want to leverage 

363
 Chapter 18: Ten Great References
a bit more functionality that the software has to offer. For more advanced 
PerformancePoint developers and administrators on the Monitoring and 
Analytics side, check out Business Intelligence with Microsoft Office 
PerformancePoint Server 2007, by Craig Utley.
Also, if you are interested in extending PPS functionality through the PPS SDK 
(Software Development Kit), check out this link:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb187388.aspx
Joining the Microsoft Community
As a developer or user of PerformancePoint, you may come across issues or 
problems with the software. Beyond the typical MSDN resources, Microsoft 
has also created a community-based service to allow you to post questions 
and issues. Microsoft will follow up with bug-tracking status and future 
release dates. The forums also provide links to new downloads, such as 
add-on tools, Community Technology Previews (CTPs), and software that 
can fix your problems or allow you to try out new features before they are 
officially released.
While membership in the service requires you to fill out some surveys, the 
wealth of knowledge is well worth it. Check out this link:
http://connect.microsoft.com
Joining a PPS User Group
We found a couple of PPS user groups on LinkedIn and joined the 
PerformancePoint Server Professionals group (http://radekle.spaces.
live.com). It is essentially a blog with a ton of great information and links 
like the preceding ones plus many more. To view the list of PPS user groups 
through LinkedIn, do one of the following:
 
✓ Visit www.linkedin.com/groupsDirectory?results=&sik=
1217189367206.
 
✓ Visit www.linkedin.com, access the Groups Directory, and run a 
search on “PerformancePoint.”

Using Help Files
Of course, don’t forget that every Microsoft product ships with a significant 
amount of documentation embedded right in the application. Just click the 
Help icon at the top of the menu bars. With a couple of keywords, an entire 
encyclopedia of PerformancePoint information is at your fingertips.
Sometimes the information may seem a bit too technical or overwhelming. 
But keep in mind that for PerformancePoint, Microsoft has done a great job 
of including examples with the help files. So, not only can you get the syntax 
structure, but you can also get to see how an example is addressed using 
that code.
When in Doubt, Google
What did we do before Google? Well, we would call our colleagues and ask 
them questions. And while we still do that, we Google questions about 
PerformancePoint quite a bit. Inevitably, Googling will bring you to the blogs 
previously listed.
Understanding Your Place 
in the IT World
While not a forum relating specifically to PerformancePoint, the IT Toolbox 
community provides a tremendous resource for all things business intelli-
gence. Yes, we know that the IT Toolbox is not just for business intelligence. 
It holds a ton of information about everything relating to information technol-
ogy. However, the business intelligence contents are especially good. You 
can use the links, white papers, articles, and forums to gain a better sense of 
the entire business intelligence industry today. You’ll see where it’s moving 
in the future, compare different products, discuss commonly experienced 
issues, and find a host of other useful topics.
 
If you get really proficient at PerformancePoint, a section even exists for 
finding jobs within the IT space.
So when it comes to determining whether PerformancePoint is the right solu-
tion for your company, go to the IT Toolbox to see how PerformancePoint 
compares to the other major players in the space. You may find that 
PerformancePoint is the perfect solution for you, or you may find alternative 
products that suit your needs better.

Ten Tips, Tricks, and Pitfalls
In This Chapter
▶ Watching out for PPS pitfalls
▶ Saving yourself some time with a couple of tips and tricks specific to Planning or 
Monitoring and Analytics (M&A)
T
his chapter is small but mighty. Following these recommendations can 
save you enormous amounts of time and pain. Why reinvent the wheel?
Using Analysis Services as Your 
Primary M&A Data Source
While PPS M&A is reasonably adept at leveraging data that is not multidimen-
sional (for example, an SQL table or Excel Workbook), it is much more 
adept when it is. Instead of trying to make PPS fit your relational or flat data 
environment, take your relational and flat data environment and transform 
that into an Analysis Services cube whenever possible. And benefits to 
implementing Analysis Services extend far beyond its integration with PPS. 
See the sidebar “Analysis Services rocks” in Chapter 9 for more benefits.
Setting Up Element Security in M&A
In PPS M&A, when you create a new element, one of the first steps is naming 
that element. In the naming dialog box for each new element, you find a 
check box that allows access to that element for all authenticated users. 
Selecting this check box can save you the time of having to set up this 
authentication manually. The authentication does not manage or override 
data (that is, database or Analysis Services) security; it just allows the user 
access to the PPS dashboard page, scorecard, report, and data source 
elements. If users don’t have access to certain data per their roles, allowing 
these element permissions does not change that.

368
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Using Default Calculations 
for M&A KPIs
Unless you have very specific business rules regarding how KPIs should 
be calculated and rolled up, leave the default calculation setting for your 
KPIs and set No Value as the calculation for objectives. Default accurately 
normalizes your KPIs so that they can be compared correctly. Showing a 
fixed or data source value in the objectives can be misleading, because the 
objective itself will be calculated from the normalized values of its children. 
Therefore, setting the calculation to No Value makes more sense from a 
user perspective.
Trending with M&A Trend Charts
If you want to create trend charts, make sure that your date dimension has 
future dates. A Trend Analysis Chart can only predict trends to the last date 
that you have in your cube. But the last date you have in your cube might 
be the last date you have actual data for. Your Date dimension should be 
populated with future dates, for as far as you would like to predict based on 
your historical data.
ProClarity URL Tricks for M&A
In addition to the configuration options on the Editor tab of your PAS 
(ProClarity Analytics Server) report workspace, you can use a number of 
other configurations to show more or less of the PAS interface in your 
dashboard.
The great benefit to this is that by default, you have limited functionality on a 
PAS report when published with PerformancePoint. For example:
 
✓ You can’t drill down to other dimensions in a decomposition tree.
 
✓ You can’t change measures and dimensions in your report.
 
✓ You don’t have a toolbar to launch ProClarity Web Professional or 
export your PAS report to Excel.

369
 Chapter 19: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Pitfalls
But, courtesy of the Microsoft PerformancePoint blog, you can use the 
following configuration settings to change the functions an end user has 
access to when viewing a PAS report deployed in PPS:
 
✓ Add tabsVisible=false; to your PAS configuration list to hide 
the ProClarity logo, the ProClarity tabs, and the left pane. Add 
tabsVisible=true; to show these items.
 
✓ Add dimToolvisible=false; to your PAS configuration list to hide 
your data layout tab to disable slicing, dicing, and filtering (that is, 
changing rows, dimensions, and background items). Add 
dimToolvisible=true; to show this tab.
 
✓ Add contentNavigation=false; to your PAS configuration list to 
remove the PAS library breadcrumb. Add contentNavigation=true; 
to show it.
 
✓ Add fullscreen=true; to your PAS configuration list to show the PAS 
toolbar, which includes PAS exporting and printing functions and Web 
Professional access. Add fullscreen=false; to hide the toolbar.

Connections for Planning
Depending on the installation and configuration of your Planning compo-
nents, the methods of connecting to Planning Administration Console 
may be different compared to Planning Business Modeler and Excel. In most 
corporate settings, the Planning Administration Console connection requires 
connecting through http://<servername>:46878. However, connections 
to the planning server through Planning Business Modeler and Excel may 
not accept the same address, because the administrator may have set up a 
different domain and address for other connections.
If you need access to the planning server through all the Planning compo-
nents, check with your administrator to obtain both connection methodolo-
gies before starting. Knowing the proper addresses for the components can 
greatly smooth your experience. After you have the addresses, make sure to 
keep them stored where you can access them at any time.

370
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Planning Data Sources 
and Default Schemas
When creating a data source connection in Planning Administration Console, 
you may notice that some tables or views are missing. It turns out that the 
data connection module of Planning cannot navigate tables and views that 
do not belong to the default schema (usually dbo). Thus, if you have a data 
source that includes multiple schemas, only the tables and views belonging 
to the default schema will appear for inclusion in your data source panel.
Currently, no workaround exists for this issue. Just make sure that any of 
the tables and views that you want to use for dimensions in your model are 
present within the default schema of your database.
Formatting Your Planning 
Form Templates
As you build form templates for your Planning users, remember that usability 
is a tremendous boon to adoption. The more user-friendly and appealing you 
make the templates, the more your users will want to use your proud work. 
We recommend adding a couple of touches:
 
✓ Format the form templates to include company logos, proper columns 
and row headings, and row banding to make the look and feel of the 
template easier on the eyes and as familiar as possible.
 
✓ Add filters so that users aren’t overwhelmed by the amount of data 
that needs to be entered. The Filter function allows your users to 
concentrate on a segment or slice of data at a time.
If you build your form templates with your end users in mind, both you and 
they will be happier in the end.
Ensuring the Proper Structure 
of Data Source Files for Planning 
Member Set Creation
For the Planning components, the creation of member sets plays a critical 
and essential role in the functionality of your application. However, the 

371
 Chapter 19: Ten Tips, Tricks, and Pitfalls
means to create member sets through the Properties method require your 
dimension data source to be properly structured. This applies to any data 
source you import, whether you are using the CSV, a data source, or a 
custom data method.
Because the information resides in a flat file-like structure, you must ensure 
that the relationship between the grouping columns and the rest of the data 
is unique and exactly hierarchical without repetition. For example, if you are 
trying to build a member set containing country, state, county, and zip code, 
with zip code as the leaf-level member, you need to ensure that every zip 
code belongs to one and only one county. Then, each county only belongs 
to one state, and each state only belongs to one country. (If you try this 
example, using data from the United States, you’d soon realize that zip codes 
actually cross county and state lines!)
Trying to build a member set with data that is nonunique within the file 
results in an empty member set. You need to ensure that this doesn’t happen 
to you (it’s extremely annoying). If you are not familiar with writing SQL 
code, you should ask your resident DBA expert to check that the data source 
you are using is unique down to the level of your hierarchy.
If you have multiple rows for what you think should be leaf-level data, you’ll 
need to do some cleanup of the data. In that situation, we suggest creating a 
database view of the data that conforms to the proper structure. In this 
way, you don’t need to disturb the underlying data in case you need it for 
something else.
Most often, this problem arises when some history is contained within the 
base data. For example, an employee may have changed departments and the 
old department assignment is still in the data file. You may need to only bring 
currently active data into a view to suppress extraneous data.
Leveraging Current Period Configurations 
within Planning Form Templates
Within your Planning components, you can schedule current period updates 
(see Chapter 6). If you have done so, you can make your form templates 
automatically update to accommodate the shift in current period. Thus, if 
your current periods are scheduled for every 6 months, your form templates 
can automatically shift the dates within the time dimension to match.
When designing your matrix, simply edit the Time dimension in the Define 
Member Intersections for Columns section. Add dynamic ranges to configure 
how far into the future your scenario variable should apply for the given 
cycle. Thus, with the onset of a cycle, your actual scenario will apply to the 
current 6 months, while your forecast can be aligned with the next 6 months.
