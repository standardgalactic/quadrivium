1 Nanofinishing in 
light of optimization 
and sustainability
Abhishek Bhatnagar, Zafar Alam, 
Dilshad Ahmad Khan, and Faiz Iqbal
1.1  INTRODUCTION
The aim of this chapter is to understand the concept of sustainability and sustain‑
able development that helps growth and development while not compromising on the 
future. This requires judicious use of natural resources, which implies optimizing a 
certain objective while keeping the available resources for the future as well. This 
chapter presents several definitions of sustainability and sustainable development, 
and closely links them with optimization. Further, both these concepts are applied 
to manufacturing processes (nanofinishing in particular) to understand the optimiza‑
tion of machining parameters. The optimal values of these parameters help in the 
designing of sustainable manufacturing systems that can have throughputs to cater to 
the needs of people while not compromising on the future.
The chapter is organized into three broad sections and the conclusion. The first 
section (Section 1.2) details out the concepts of sustainability, sustainable develop‑
ment, and enablers and barriers to sustainability. The second section (Section 1.3) 
provides on overview of the broad field of optimization with a few key methods and 
examples for optimization of resources. The third section (Section 1.4) provides the 
optimization of parameters for a nanofinishing process. Section 1.5 concludes the 
chapter.
1.2  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
Sustainable development goals (SDGs) are adopted by the United Nations for a better 
and sustainable future for all [1, 2]. These refer to a set of 17 inter‑related goals whose 
broad themes under SDGs include dignity (SDGs 1, 5), people (SDGs 2, 3, 4), planet 
(SDGs 6, 12, 13, 14, 15), partnership (SDG 17), justice (SDG 16), and prosperity 
(SDGs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) [3, 4]. These goals aim to improve the standard of living broadly 
through better education, environmental consciousness, poverty reduction, equality, 
good health, sustainable cities, and communities. However, improved standard of 
living requires development in all sectors and this development aspect has its own 
challenges. Development needs to be carried out in a way that humans co‑exist on

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
the planet over a long duration, thus keeping in view the environment while carrying 
out development‑related activities. This leads to an important concept of sustain‑
able development, which is main idea in this discourse. This has various associated 
interpretations based on the context of its usage. A few definitions of sustainable 
development are given next:
	
1.	Schaefer and Crane [5] define sustainable development as “the type of 
development process that meets the needs of the current generation without 
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” 
This definition implies judicious use of non‑renewable resources by the cur‑
rent generation to make it available for the future as well. Development 
should continue keeping in view sustainability for all.
	
2.	Mensah [6] defines sustainable development as “a mechanism through 
which society can interact with the environment while not risking dam‑
aging the resource for the future.” This essentially implies improving the 
quality of life without endangering the ecosystems and the environment in 
general that may cause climate change, pollution of any form (air, noise, and 
water), deforestation, and extinction of wildlife and birds [7].
	
3.	Zhai and Chang [8] define sustainable development as a development 
paradigm that “aims at achieving social progress, environmental equi‑
librium and economic growth.” This implies meeting the developmental 
goals and simultaneously sustaining the ability of systems that provide 
the non‑­renewable resources and do not hamper the social and economic 
ecosystem.
The common ideas that come through these definitions lead to incorporation of sus‑
tainability concepts in different spheres of life while developing various systems 
for the future. A key part of development lies in manufacturing of goods using 
various tools and techniques. These goods are used by people to meet their daily 
requirements; hence, they require large‑scale production units with high throughput, 
enhanced capacities, and precision for customer satisfaction over the long run. The 
large scale of manufacturing requires these processes to be environment friendly and 
economical, as well as meet the requirements of the people. In short, the manufactur‑
ing processes should be sustainable in the long run and the concept of sustainability 
needs to be included in these processes.
Sustainability has several definitions in the literature; however, the keywords used 
in all definition are people, costs, environment, holistic, future, and long run. A few 
definitions are as follows:
	
1.	Sustainability can be defined as “the capacity to maintain or improve the 
state and availability of desirable materials or conditions over the long 
term” [9]. This definition emphasizes on the long‑term impact that requires 
either to maintain the system at a state where it can sustain easily or to 
improve it incrementally (since, there is no endpoint) to adopt new technolo‑
gies that can be helpful to cater to the needs of the future.
	
2.	Sustainability is “a dynamic equilibrium in the process of interaction 
between the population and the carrying capacity of its environment such 

3
Nanofinishing in light of optimization and sustainability
that the population develops to express its full potential without produc‑
ing irreversible adverse effects on the carrying capacity of the environment 
upon which it depends” [10]. This definition provides a holistic view of the 
planet, its species, its future, and the interaction between the population 
and its carrying capacity. Both these factors affect each other as shown in 
Figure 1.1.
	
3.	Sustainability is “our ability to maintain a coupled human–nature system at 
a desirable state for multiple generations in the face of anthropogenic and 
environmental perturbations and uncertainties” [11]. This definition stresses 
upon the continuous interaction between humans and nature and the effect 
that one has on the other.
As evident from the definitions stated above, sustainability essentially 
means to sustain for the future, which gives rise to three pillars of sus‑
tainability. These pillars are economy, society, and the environment. 
Subsequently, these give rise to three dimensions of sustainability, namely, 
economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustain‑
ability. These three dimensions are interlinked using different concepts as 
given in Figure 1.2, as adapted from [16] and elaborated later.
Figure 1.2 demonstrates sustainability from different perspectives, namely, triple bot‑
tom line, weak sustainability, and strong sustainability. The triple bottom line concept 
of sustainability refers to the working of an organization towards achieving their goals 
while keeping the views of people, the planet, and profits into consideration. This is 
typically represented by a Venn diagram whose intersection represents sustainability. 
This aims to cover the long‑term strategies of an organization towards achieving the 
FIGURE 1.1  Population and its activity; adapted from [10].

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
dimension of sustainability, which are economic benefits along with social equity and 
maintaining environmental quality at the same time. This approach of sustainabil‑
ity representation ignores the hierarchy of the three dimensions [12, 13]. Getzner [13] 
coined the term strong sustainability to represent environmental quality as a wider 
perspective in the system with social aspects in the next level and economic factor as 
the last part of this hierarchy. This means that economic development requires both 
social and environmental capital; and the environment provides the required resources 
of social and economic development. It implies that the natural capital (environmental 
systems) and the man‑made capital (society and economy) are not substitutable. The 
increase in population and its negative effects on the environmental systems due to 
scarcity of natural resources require an emphasis on the environmental dimension, 
putting it at the highest level in the context of strong sustainability. The weak sustain‑
ability aspect stresses the fact that overall sustainability remains constant while the 
individual dimensions can be substituted. The three dimensions of sustainability have 
sub‑areas within which they operate as per Helleno et al. [14]. The economic dimension 
includes cost management, corporative management, operational efficiency, inclusion 
of new products, operating results, suppliers, customers, and infrastructure. The social 
dimension comprises employee salary and benefits, their satisfaction levels, quality and 
safety, human resources, and the community. The environmental dimension includes 
environmental aspects and their management, responsible consumption, and life cycle 
of the product and its recycling [15].
The manufacturing of goods comprises several processes throughout their life 
cycle while being manufactured and up to the time they are used by the customer 
after which they are recycled and remanufactured. This cycle is represented in 
Figure 1.3. Incorporation of sustainability concepts in this life cycle is important 
due to the large scale of production. This requires working as per the sustainable 
aggregate production plans as illustrated in Figure 1.4, which indicates maximiza‑
tion of total profits, focus on the use of renewable resources (reduction in usage of 
non‑renewable resources), satisfaction of employees, and focus on their well‑being.
A sustainable machining process has several components, as illustrated in 
Figure  1.5. It shows the intersection of the sustainability dimensions during the 
machining process. The economic dimensions focus on consumption of energy that

leads to resource depletion, fixed and variable costs involved in the machining pro‑
cess such as tool costs, lubrication costs, etc. Waste management becomes a critical 
part that involves cost that is a function of reusability and recycling. The machined 
product goes into the market which should be profitable for the organization and its 
profitability depends on its quality of finishing as well as the production process in 
general. The environmental aspects include the resource depletion aspect, manage‑
ment of waste, and the impact on the environment such as global warming and cli‑
mate change. The social aspects include the health and safety of individuals involved 
in the production process and the product quality for its enhanced consumption in 
the market [18].
Given the impact of the large‑scale production and machining processes, it is 
imperative to include optimization aspects in this process from the procurement of 
raw materials to the delivery to the final consumers, as given in the next section.
1.3  OPTIMIZATION OF RESOURCES
Section 1.2 presented the concepts of sustainable development and sustainability, 
and its needs in the large‑scale production processes. In this and the next sec‑
tion, we will discuss how the optimization of resources (better usage of manpower, 
infrastructure, and transportation) and the production processes can help achieve 
SDGs. Optimization is an act of making decisions using the available resources 
which can be constraints given a limited budget. It is a broad field with wide 
applications, which is required for sustainable operations. An optimization prob‑
lem is characterized by decision variables which are the output of the model. The 
values of these variables optimize a certain objective. The model consists of an 
objective function; constraints that refer to the considerations to be incorporated 
while optimizing the objective; and parameters whose values are varied in differ‑
ent experiments. An optimization problem is mathematically modelled and solved 
using different solution techniques that depend on its mathematical complexity and 
nature of the formulation [20, 21].
Optimization has various use cases in the manufacturing setup. We will discuss a 
few applications of optimization in the entire supply chain from the procurement of 
raw materials to the delivery till the final consumer. Large‑scale production requires 
setting up the manufacturing unit at an appropriate location. This is known as a 
facility location problem [22], whose decision variables represent where to locate 
raw material outlets, the manufacturing location given that the customer locations 
are known. In the presence of many manufacturing units and raw material suppli‑
ers, it is required to map these suppliers to the manufacturing units optimally using 
the assignment models and vendor selection models [23]. Next, the routing of raw 
material vehicles from suppliers to the manufacturing plant and the manufacturing 
plant to distribution centres and then to the customers takes place. These are through 
vehicle routing models [24]. The layout of the manufacturing plant to optimize the 
throughput when an item undergoes the transformation from raw material to a fin‑
ished product happens through facility layout models [25]. Further, the processes 
through which these operations take place can also be optimized, that is, different 
parameters of the machining process can be adjusted to use the resources judiciously

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
given the large scale of production. These are discussed in detail specifically for the 
nanofinishing process in the next section.
The optimization problems are formulated as mathematical models that can be 
solved to get the values of the decision variables. The solution methods include exact 
and heuristic methods that can be applied on standard solvers to get the output. The 
exact method gives the optimal solution but takes a long time as compared to the heu‑
ristic methods which are sub‑optimal due to lower computational time. The commonly 
used heuristic methods include genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization, artificial 
bee colony optimization, simulated annealing, and tabu search, etc. The next section 
discusses the optimization of machining parameters for the nanofinishing process.
1.4  OPTIMIZATION OF NANOFINISHING PARAMETERS
Optimization of nanofinishing parameters is a crucial aspect for improving surface 
quality and performance in various industries. It involves fine‑tuning a range of fac‑
tors to achieve the desired outcomes, such as surface roughness reduction, increased 
wear resistance, and improved functional properties. Here is a brief literature 
review highlighting key studies and approaches in the optimization of nanofinishing 
parameters:
Optimization Techniques: Researchers have employed various optimization 
techniques, including Taguchi methods, response surface methodology 
(RSM), and genetic algorithms, to determine the optimal combination of 
parameters such as feed rate, tool speed, pressure, and abrasive size. These 
methods help identify the settings that yield the best surface finish and min‑
imize defects.
Material‑Specific Optimization: Different materials require tailored app­
roaches. Studies have focused on optimizing nanofinishing parameters 
for metals [26–28], ceramics [29], polymers [30], and composites [31]. For 
example, in the case of metals, optimizing parameters like electrolyte com‑
position in electrochemical polishing can significantly enhance surface 
quality.
Multi‑Objective Optimization: In many applications, achieving multiple 
objectives is essential. Researchers have employed multi‑objective optimi‑
zation techniques to balance conflicting goals, such as minimizing surface 
roughness while maximizing material removal rates [32].
Tooling and Abrasives Optimization: Selecting the right tools and abrasives 
is vital. Investigations into the selection of abrasive materials, abrasive size, 
and tool geometry have been conducted to optimize nanofinishing pro‑
cesses [33–35].
Environmental Considerations: Sustainability is becoming increasingly 
important in manufacturing. Researchers are optimizing parameters with 
a focus on reducing energy consumption and minimizing waste in nanofin‑
ishing processes [36].
In‑Process Monitoring and Control: Real‑time monitoring and control 
systems have been integrated into nanofinishing processes to adapt and 

9
Nanofinishing in light of optimization and sustainability
optimize parameters as conditions change. This ensures consistent quality 
and efficiency [37–40].
Surface Characterization Techniques: Alongside parameter optimization, 
researchers have employed advanced surface characterization techniques 
like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) to assess the effects of different parameter settings on surface 
properties.
Applications: Optimization of nanofinishing parameters has been applied 
across various industries, including automotive, aerospace, electronics, 
and medical devices, with a focus on enhancing product performance and 
reducing manufacturing costs.
The optimization of nanofinishing parameters is a dynamic field that plays a cru‑
cial role in achieving superior surface quality and sustainability across a range of 
industries. Researchers continue to explore innovative approaches and technologies 
to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of nanofinishing processes.
1.5  CONCLUSION
The introductory chapter to this book underscores the paramount significance of 
optimizing nanofinishing parameters while concurrently prioritizing sustainabil‑
ity. This convergence of precision and eco‑consciousness holds immense promise 
for industries seeking to enhance product quality and reduce their environmental 
footprint. The chapter highlights the multifaceted nature of nanofinishing param‑
eter optimization, encompassing techniques, materials, multi‑objective goals, and 
tools. Moreover, the chapter underpins the increasing integration of real‑time 
monitoring and control systems, coupled with advanced surface characterization 
techniques, to refine nanofinishing processes. Crucially, the pursuit of sustainabil‑
ity is intrinsic to contemporary manufacturing practices. Nanofinishing optimi‑
zation offers a unique avenue to align production objectives with environmental 
responsibility. It can significantly reduce material waste, energy consumption, and 
adverse ecological impacts. The chapter underscores the synergy between green 
engineering principles, circular economy concepts, and nanofinishing, fostering a

2.1  INTRODUCTION
Nano‑finishing, a cutting‑edge surface refinement technique, meticulously elimi‑
nates a minute fraction of material from the surface, operating within the nano‑metre 
range. This process produces a high‑quality surface finish (SF) with excellent sur‑
face properties, particularly useful in the electronic and mechanical industries [1, 2]. 
Nano‑finishing methods have various applications in multiple sectors, including avi‑
ation, automotive, biomedical, and electronics. In the realm of aviation engineering, 
impeccably polished copper mirrors find significant utility owing to their exceptional 
thermal conductivity and heat capacity. However, due to the inherent softness of cop‑
per, achieving nano‑finishing on this material is highly difficult.
To attain a better SF, researchers applied different magnetorheological (MaR) 
procedures [3]. Nano‑finishing techniques are harnessed to enhance the SF of engine 
components, yielding substantial benefits such as enhanced fuel efficiency and 
reduced emissions. Nanotechnology has also been used in paints to protect automo‑
biles from scratches and other damage over time. Nanotechnology is also applied to 
other body components, including but not limited to chassis, engines, tyres, and drive 
trains [4]. Within the biomedical industry, nano‑finishing plays a pivotal role in aug‑
menting medical implants’ SF, fostering improved biocompatibility, and significantly 
reducing rejection rates. It is required for the mating surfaces of biomedical implants 
such as shoulder, hip, knee, and ankle joints for appropriate functioning and longev‑
ity [5]. In the electronics industry, applying nano‑finishing techniques is instrumen‑
tal in enhancing electronic components’ SF, culminating in notable improvements in 
reliability and overall performance. Nanotechnology has been applied to electronic

components to enhance their performance and durability. Nanotechnology can 
improve the conductivity of materials used in electronic components, making them 
more efficient. Nanotechnology can also be used to create smaller and more power‑
ful electronic devices. Figure 2.1 shows the different nano‑finishing applications in 
various industries.
A plethora of nano‑finishing techniques exist, encompassing chemical mechanical 
polishing, electrochemical polishing, electropolishing, magnetic field‑assisted finish‑
ing, MaR finishing, magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (MRAFF) [6, 7], and 
the rotational magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (R‑MRAFF) process [8]. 
R‑MRAFF represents a highly advanced method that harmonizes rotational motion 
with MaR abrasive flow machining, delivering meticulous SF and precise material 
removal rates. By employing an MaR fluid infused with abrasive particles and a 
rotating magnetic field, R‑MRAFF effectively eradicates material from the work‑
piece’s surface. Notably surpassing its predecessors, R‑MRAFF grants superior con‑
trol over the material removal rate and SF by harnessing the synergistic potential of 
rotational motion and MaR abrasive particles.
The capability of generating superior SFs on diverse materials, including hard 
and brittle substances, has propelled the recent surge of interest in this process. 
Nonetheless, the optimization of process parameters for achieving the desired output 
responses in R‑MRAFF remains a persistent challenge. To address this, the pres‑
ent study employs elitist non‑dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA‑II) [9], 
a well‑established multi‑objective optimization algorithm, in an endeavour to opti‑
mize the process parameters of R‑MRAFF. A detailed discussion about the work‑
ing of NSGA‑II is given in Section 2.4.1. The considered process parameters are 
FIGURE 2.1  Applications of nano‑finishing process in different industries.

Multi-objective optimization
extrusion pressure (P) in bars, the number of finishing cycles (N), the rotational 
speed of the magnet (S) in RPM, and the mesh size of the abrasive (M). Meanwhile, 
the output responses under scrutiny are the final SF and material removal (MR). 
Regression analysis is employed to model their relationship to establish a connec‑
tion between the process parameters and output responses. Initially, a real‑coded 
genetic algorithm maximizes one response by keeping the other as a constraint func‑
tion. Later, both the responses are maximized using the NSGA‑II algorithm and the 
obtained Pareto‑front (PF) shows a clear trade‑off between the SF and MR. The 
proposed approach offers a significant advantage over traditional trial‑and‑error 
methods, as it significantly reduces the time and cost associated with optimizing the 
process parameters of R‑MRAFF. Moreover, this approach can be easily extended to 
other complex manufacturing processes that involve multiple process parameters and 
output responses. Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understand‑
ing of the R‑MRAFF process and the use of an evolutionary algorithm to optimize 
its process parameters.
2.2  ROTATIONAL MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL 
ABRASIVE FLOW MACHINING PROCESS
The preceding section underscored the paramount importance of nano‑­finishing 
processes in attaining exceptional surface quality across various sectors. 
Numerous products’ functional requirements necessitate achieving a nano‑level 
SF. Nano‑finishing processes can be broadly classified into magnetic field‑assisted 
and non‑assisted methods. Magnetic field‑assisted techniques encompass magnetic 
abrasive finishing, MaR finishing, and similar methodologies, while non‑assisted 
methods include abrasive flow finishing. Among the magnetic field‑assisted 
methods, MRAFF stands out as a well‑established technique capable of achiev‑
ing nano‑metre SFs on diverse materials, such as brass, aluminium, stainless 
steel, and silicon nitride. One modification that aids in attaining the desired 
­nano‑finishing level involves incorporating rotational motion into the MRAFF 
process. Figure 2.2(a) illustrates the schematic view of an MRAFF experimental 
setup. Figure 2.2(b) showcases the R‑MRAFF process’s mechanism, highlighting 
the magnets’ rotational movement. Additionally, Figure 2.2(c) depicts the altera‑
tion in rheological behaviour, specifically the changes in yield stress and viscosity, 
of the MaR‑polishing fluid during the finishing process.
The quality of the finished surface in MaR‑fluid‑based finishing processes is pri‑
marily influenced by the constituents of the MaR fluid and the applied magnetic 
field [11]. In their work, Sidpara and Jain [11] explored the correlation between rheo‑
logical properties and SF quality in MaR‑fluid‑based finishing processes. R‑MRAFF 
employs an MaR fluid that possesses a distinctive characteristic of altering its vis‑
cosity and yield strength when it is subjected to a magnetic field. The magnetic field 
induces the formation of a microstructure within the fluid, enabling manipulation 
of the flow rate and direction. The presence of abrasive particles within the fluid 
facilitates the removal of the material from the workpiece’s surface. The concurrent 
rotation of the magnetic field ensures an even distribution of the abrasive particles, 
resulting in a uniform SF. Consequently, the process utilizes an MaR fluid infused

with abrasive particles and a rotating magnetic field to effectively eliminate mate‑
rial from the workpiece’s surface. The distinctive amalgamation of rotational motion 
and MaR abrasive particles enables precise control over the material removal rate 
and SF, rendering it an ideal process for nano‑finishing applications. R‑MRAFF 
emerges as a significant nano‑finishing technique, given its unparalleled ability to 
achieve high‑quality SFs while ensuring precise control over the material removal 
rate. Compared to earlier processes, R‑MRAFF offers enhanced control over the MR 
rate and SF, making it an appealing choice for accomplishing exceptional nano‑level 
finishes.
2.3  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MRAFF PROCESS
Rajput et al. [12] conducted a thorough examination of the different procedures and 
techniques used in MaR‑fluid finishing processes and an assessment of their efficacy 
too. The findings showed that this technique may produce extraordinary accuracy 
and surface quality without affecting the product’s material topography. Karthikeyan 
et  al. [13] investigated the in vitro behaviour of stainless steel 316 L treated to 
R‑MRAFF in their investigation. They evaluated surface topography, roughness (Ra), 
and microhardness using experiments and analyses of treated materials. Their results 
showed that the procedure improved surface quality, decreased roughness, and main‑
tained or increased microhardness. These findings imply that the R‑MRAFF tech‑
nique has the potential to improve the performance of stainless‑steel components in 
a variety of applications. In addition, Rajput et al. [14] devised a feature‑based hybrid 
MRF planning system (FHMRF‑PS) for the automated process planning of paraffin 
wax deposition in workpiece holes and pocket features prior to MRF. A case study 
on a Ti‑6Al‑4 V bone plate was performed to assess the efficiency and efficacy of 
the FHMRF‑PS. The proposed process planning during MRF reduced the initial 
Ra value from 324.12 nm to 21.56 nm, illustrating the effectiveness of the designed 
FHMRF‑PS.
Kumar et al. [15] discovered that an F‑to‑S iron ratio of 1:1, a DC supply of 12 V, 
a work sample rotating speed of 200 rpm, and a linear feed rate of 0.1 mm/min were 
the best parameter combinations for producing high‑quality surfaces on S.S. 316 L 
cylindrical work samples. Karthikeyan et al. [16] elevated the hemocompatibility 
of SS 316 L by lowering surface roughness and boosting surface energy during the 
R‑MRAFF process. The required surface polish of SS 316 L was attained using the 
following process parameters: 0.5‑tesla magnetic field intensity, 10% abrasive con‑
centration, and 200 revolutions per minute of rotating speed. Choopani et al. [17] 
encountered the effectiveness of the R‑MRAFF technique in obtaining the requisite 
nano‑finishing for Al2024 tubes. Surprisingly, they attained an Ra value of 26.3 nm 
and an MR value of 41 mg in just 15 minutes, demonstrating the efficiency of this 
method. Furthermore, Kumar et al. [18] implemented the R‑MRAFF technique to 
obtain a minimum Ra of 34.5 nm and a maximum percentage increase in Ra (%ΔRa) 
of 85.56% on a small steel gear. Furthermore, the finishing procedure efficiently 
removed the production flaws.
In light of the reviewed research, it becomes evident that MaR‑fluid finishing 
techniques possess significant potential. These techniques demonstrate the ability 

18
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
to achieve exceptional precision, enhance surface quality, reduce roughness, and 
improve material performance across diverse applications. The optimization of pro‑
cess parameters emerges as a critical factor, enabling the attainment of desired SFs 
and the elimination of manufacturing flaws. Thus, it is crucial to gain a comprehen‑
sive understanding of and effectively control the variables involved in these pro‑
cesses to ensure favou outcomes.
2.4  ELITIST NON‑DOMINATED SORTING GENETIC ALGORITHM II
Elitist NSGA‑II represents a state‑of‑the‑art optimization algorithm rooted in evolu‑
tionary computing. Widely regarded as a benchmark technique in evolutionary com‑
putation, NSGA‑II operates as a multi‑objective optimization algorithm, enabling the 
simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Initially proposed by Deb et al. [9] 
in 2002 as an enhancement to the original NSGA algorithm, NSGA‑II stands as a 
fast, efficient, and robust algorithm that has found extensive application in engineer‑
ing, science, and economics. Its high efficiency and robustness make it an indispens‑
able tool for optimizing complex systems and processes in industrial settings, capable 
of handling diverse optimization problems, including those involving non‑linear and 
non‑convex objective functions.
Unlike single‑objective optimization algorithms that aim to discover a single 
optimal combination of design variables, a multi‑objective optimization algorithm, 
such as NSGA‑II, seeks to uncover multiple solutions known as Pareto‑optimal 
solutions. These solutions form a set of “non‑inferior” solutions in the objective 
space, wherein further improvement in one objective necessitates a compromise 
in at least one of the other objectives. Addressing the needs of most industrial 
applications, NSGA‑II tackles the simultaneous resolution of two or more conflict‑
ing objectives, generating better Pareto‑optimal solutions. By minimizing two or 
three objectives concurrently and accommodating constraints, NSGA‑II produces 
a Pareto‑optimal set with numerous solutions that optimize both objectives to such 
an extent that no other solution can enhance any objective without deteriorating 
another.
The primary advantage of NSGA‑II lies in its capacity to identify a set of 
solutions that are non‑dominated within the search space. Consequently, the algo‑
rithm discovers multiple solutions that are optimal in distinct ways rather than 
just a single optimal solution. This characteristic proves especially valuable in 
multi‑objective optimization problems where the simultaneous optimization of 
multiple objectives is necessary, and no single solution can optimize all of them. 
The algorithm commences by generating an initial population of solutions evalu‑
ated based on their fitness in the search space. The fitness of a solution is deter‑
mined by its ability to satisfy the various objectives of the optimization problem. 
Subsequently, the solutions are sorted into different levels of non‑domination, 
with the first level consisting of solutions that are not dominated by any other 
solution, followed by subsequent levels containing solutions that are dominated 
by those in the preceding level, and so forth. After sorting the solutions, NSGA‑II 
employs selection, crossover, and mutation operators to generate a new population 

19
Multi-objective optimization
of solutions that remain non‑dominated within the search space. This iterative 
process continues until optimal solutions are discovered or the maximum number 
of iterations is reached.
2.4.1  Working of NSGA‑II
NSGA‑II operates by maintaining a population of candidate solutions and itera‑
tively guiding them towards improved outcomes, making it an exemplary algo‑
rithm for multi‑objective optimization. One of its key strengths lies in its ability to 
converge towards the true PF, which is accomplished through the effective utiliza‑
tion of crossover and mutation operators. Crossover combines two chromosomes 
to create offspring, while mutation introduces random changes at the gene level. 
This interplay between crossover and mutation enables the population to con‑
verge while simultaneously reintroducing genetic diversity to steer clear of local 
minima. In addition to convergence, NSGA‑II achieves other important qualities, 
such as maintaining a uniformly distributed and diverse set of solutions. These 
objectives are facilitated by the implementation of crowding distance. By employ‑
ing an efficient crowding‑distance assignment approach, NSGA‑II ensures a 
well‑spread population of solutions, while the employment of fast, non‑­dominated 
sorting enhances the algorithm’s convergence capabilities. These advantages have 
propelled NSGA‑II into wide‑ranging applications and subjected it to numerous 
comparative studies, validating its performance. NSGA‑II favours solutions with a 
higher crowding distance over other solutions within the same PF. It also incorpo‑
rates the concept of elitism, where the best solutions are safeguarded and carried 
over to the next generation. These elite solutions are never eliminated and directly 
advance to the subsequent generation. The remaining solutions are compared 
amongst themselves, considering both their crowding distance and their rank, to 
determine the most favourable solution. This ensures a fixed population size, as 
illustrated in Figure 2.3. Here, Pt is the set of solutions obtained in generation t 
and Qt is the solution set obtained using crossover and mutation operators on Pt. 
Non‑dominated sorting is performed after considering offspring and parent solu‑
tions to get different PFs. Crowding distance is used to maintain the diversity of 
the solutions on each front.
To obtain the PF for multi‑objective optimization, NSGA‑II follows a step‑by‑step 
procedure:
	
1.	Generate an initial random population, P.
	
2.	Evaluate each solution to obtain the fitness function.
	
3.	Perform non‑dominated sorting based on non‑domination criteria to find 
different PFs.
	
4.	Calculate crowding distance to preserve diversity on each front.
	
5.	Select individuals for the next generation based on their rank (lowest) and 
crowding distance (highest).
	
6.	Generate new solutions, Q, from the previous generation using two opera‑
tors, namely, crossover and mutation.

20
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
The NSGA‑II algorithm repeats steps 2 through 6 until a predefined stopping cri‑
terion is met. Typically, this criterion is either reaching the maximum number of 
generations or failing to obtain a better PF compared to the previous iteration.
2.5  PRESENT STUDY
In various industrial sectors, the design of experiments (DOE) [19–23] is frequently 
employed for optimizing and developing manufacturing processes by examining the 
effect of multiple factors on a response. Das et al. [8] employed a DOE to evaluate the 
summary of responses, specifically MR and SF, using five levels of process param‑
eters in their study on the R‑MRAFF process. The R‑MRAFF method was utilized 
to finish the internal surface of cylindrical stainless‑steel (non‑magnetic) workpieces. 
The central composite design (CCD) employed four factors with five levels, yielding 
a total of 30 experiments comprising 16 factorial runs, 8 axial runs, and 6 centre 
runs. The first parameter, hydraulic extrusion pressure (P) in bars, was varied across 
five levels, namely, 32.5, 35, 37.5, 40, and 42.5. The second parameter, the number of 
finishing cycles (N), ranged from 600, 800, 1000, 1200 to 1400. The third parameter, 
the rotational speed of the magnet (S) in RPM, varied across 50, 100, 150, 200, and 
250. The fourth parameter, the mesh size of the abrasive (M), ranged from 90, 120, 
150, 180 to 210. Table 2.1 displays the responses along with their various levels of 
process parameters considered during the experimental design.
Table 2.1 includes measurements for both initial and final SF, and the percent‑
age improvement in roughness denoted by %ΔRa as shown in the sixth column. 
Additionally, the material removal (MR) was calculated by weighing the samples 
before and after the machining process, with the difference between the two mea‑
surements indicating the amount of material removed in mg from the sample.

2.6  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 2.1 shows the SF and MR values obtained from the R‑MRAFF experiments, 
which involved four factors at five levels using the CCD design. Figure 2.4 shows 
how the response variations are affected by each input parameter, using the mean 
values of both responses for a given process parameter level. During the increase in 
hydraulic pressure (P) from 32.5 to 35 bar and 35 to 37.5 bar, MR increased by 73.3% 
and 37.6%, respectively. Meanwhile, SF increased by 10.0% and 3.3%, respectively.

However, further increasing P from 37.5 bar to 40 bar caused a decrease in MR by 
23.2% and an increase in SF by 1.2%. Increasing P from 40 to 42.5 bar increased MR 
and SF by 3.0% and 3.8%, respectively. While increasing the number of finishing 
cycles (N) from 600 to 800 and 800 to 1000, MR increased by 67.5% and 62.56%, 
respectively, while SF increased by 0.75% and 5.5%. Increasing N from 1000 to 1200 
caused a decrease in MR by 5.5% and an increase in SF by 3.3%.
Increasing N from 1200 to 1400 resulted in an increase in MR by 50.28% and a 
decrease in SF by 3.8%. When the magnet’s rotational speed (S) is increased from 50 
to 100 RPM, the MR increased significantly by 160.6%, while the improvement in 
SF was only 9.8%. As S was raised from 100 to 150 RPM, MR increased by 39.2%, 
but SF decreased by 3.7%. However, when S increased again from 150 to 200 RPM, 
MR and SF worsened, declining by 15.7% and 7.32%, respectively. Conversely, when 
S is increased from 200 to 250 RPM, MR increased by 80.8%, but SF decreased by 
4.7%. The increase in the mesh size of the abrasive (M) from 90 to 120 has an adverse 
impact on both MR and SF, leading to a reduction of 41% and 2.7%, respectively. 
However, an increase in M from 120 to 150 resulted in an MR increase of 13%, while 
it barely affected the SF (almost 0.1%). Subsequently, an increase in M from 150 
to 210 led to a decline in both MR and SF. The MR is decreased by 32% and 60%, 
respectively, while the SF is reduced by 1.2% and 3.4%, respectively.
This analysis of experimental data examined the effects of the process param‑
eters on the response variation, and it has been discovered that MR is more strongly 
affected than SF due to changes in process parameters. This is so because MR 
measured the total amount of material removed (in mg) from the surface, while SF 
focused on SF at a nano level, which has minimal variation. The least effect on MR 
is observed due to parameter P, whereas the least impact on SF is observed due to 
FIGURE 2.4  Effect of process parameters on response variation.

parameter M. Parameter S has a significant effect on both MR and SF at different 
levels. If we consider the changes in responses caused by altering the process param‑
eters to different levels, regardless of whether the responses increased or decreased, 
the order in which the parameters impacted MR from the least to the most is M, N, P, 
and S, while for SF it is M, N, P, and S.
2.6.1  Mathematical modelling
The regression equation for MR and SF are developed, and the coefficient of deter‑
mination (R2) for both are found to be approximately 83.93% and 80.72%, respec‑
tively. Using regression analysis, the dependent variables MR and SF are modelled 
as non‑linear functions of four independent process parameters, which are given in 
Equations (2.1) and (2.2).

(2.2)
The comparison between the present regression analysis and Das et al.’s [8] model 
is also shown in Figure 2.5. The MR equations are closely related and well‑fitted to 
all experimental data. However, there is a significant difference in the SF equations, 
with Equation (2.2) fitting all experimental data closely, while the previous model 
barely passed through any data point. The present model has clearly outperformed 
the earlier model in terms of goodness of fit.
2.6.2  Effect of process parameters on responses
The variation of MR and SF with respect to the input parameters is shown in 
Figures 2.6 and 2.7, as response surface plots. The variation is shown concerning 
two independent values, while the other two are kept constant. Figure 2.6(a) shows 
that MR initially increases with increasing pressure (P) and finishing cycles (N). 
However, MR eventually decreases with further increases in P and N. The maxi‑
mum MR is found to occur when P and N are approximately equal to 37.5 bar and 
1000, respectively. The other two parameters, the magnet’s rotational speed (S) in 
RPM and mesh size (M), are kept fixed. Figure 2.6(b) shows that MR increases with 
increasing S up to 200 RPM. After that, MR slightly decreases. N causes MR to 

24
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
increase exponentially at a fixed S (at 50 RPM). However, increasing S and N together 
causes MR to reduce further. Figure 2.6(c) shows that at a fixed M (around 100), the 
parameter S is found to be increasing the MR exponentially.
Similarly, at a fixed value to S (around 50 RPM), M is also found to be increasing 
the MR. However, the effect of S is found to be more compared to M. In the case of 
increasing both the parameters M and S, MR is found to be decreased drastically; 
in fact, it reached a minimum. Figure 2.6(d) shows that MR achieved an optimum 
value when P reached around 37.5 bar and M at around 160. Figure 2.6(e) shows a 
similar trend with respect to P. However, parameter S is found to be significantly 
helping in achieving the better MR with the higher value of S. Here, P is also 
found to assist in achieving the better MR at around 37.5 bar, and at this value 
of P, the parameter S further increases the MR with an advance in its own value. 
Figure 2.6(f) shows a very similar trend with the parameters N and M, which was 
observed in Figure 2.6(e) with the parameters S and P, respectively. Here, the best 
value for M is found to be around 150, and N increases the MR by increasing its 
own value.
Similarly, Figure 2.7 shows the response surface plot for finish (SF). Figure 2.7(a) 
shows that the parameters P and N positively affect achieving the better SF. 
Figure 2.7(b) shows that the parameter S initially helps to attain the better SF but 
reduces it drastically later. At around S equals 150 RPM, SF seems to improve with 
increasing N. Figure 2.7(c) shows that the parameter M initially improves SF and 
then reduces it. However, the parameter S shows a similar trend, as mentioned in 
Figure 2.7(b); for example, at around S = 150 RPM, it enhances SF. Figure 2.7(d) 
shows that when P is kept around 37.5 bar, SF seems to improve with increasing 
M, provided that the rest of the parameters are kept fixed. Figure 2.7(e) shows that 
increasing S and P could help to obtain better SF, while M and N are kept fixed. 
Figure 2.7(f) shows a similar trend with the parameters M and N. The results show 
that both MR and SF are complex functions of the input parameters.

2.6.3  Single‑objective optimization
The results of single‑objective optimization using a real‑coded genetic algorithm [24] 
with a probability of crossover and mutation set to 0.9 and 0.3, respectively, are shown 
in Table 2.2. The population size and number of generations used are 200 and 500, 
respectively. Initially, SF is constrained to be at least 80%, while MR is maximized. The 
optimal values of the decision variables are found to be as follows: P = 39.14, N = 1175, 
FIGURE 2.6  Effects of variation of process parameters on material removal.

26
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
S = 250, and M = 90. In the second attempt, SF is maximized while keeping MR as 
a constraint function. The constraint required a minimum material removal of 24 mg 
from the samples. The best combination of process parameters to achieve a 95.87% 
improvement in roughness is found to be as follows: P = 41.34, N = 1395, S = 182, and 
M = 137. This clearly demonstrates the trade‑off between the two objective functions.
However, these two solution sets represent the only options for prioritizing one 
objective function by keeping the other as a constraint. To visualize the trade‑off

better, the NSGA‑II algorithm is used to identify a set of Pareto‑optimal solutions 
that simultaneously maximize both MR and SF. NSGA‑II is a population‑based algo‑
rithm that searches for Pareto‑optimal solutions iteratively.
2.6.4  Multi‑objective optimization
In nano‑finishing operations, the goal is to achieve high levels of both SF and mate‑
rial removal (MR). However, these objectives can often conflict with each other. 
Increasing MR may result in a decrease in SF and vice versa. As a result, it is not 
possible to maximize both objectives simultaneously. To address this trade‑off, 
the NSGA‑II algorithm is used to simultaneously maximize both MR and SF. The 
NSGA‑II algorithm is designed to minimize the objectives by default. Therefore, 
the duality principle is used to convert the problem into a minimization problem by 
taking the reciprocal of MR and SF. The objectives are expressed using a quadratic 
mathematical model with four decision variables as given in Eqs. (2.1) and (2.2). The

multi‑objective optimization problem described above is solved using NSGA‑II with 
the following parameters:
Population Size = 200,
Number of Generations = 500,
Probability of Crossover = 0.9,
Probability of Mutation = 0.25,
Distribution Index for Crossover = 10, and
Distribution Index for Mutation = 20.
The Pareto‑optimal solutions generated by NSGA‑II are presented in Figure 2.8, 
which can be used to select the optimal machining parameters based on the decision 
maker’s requirements. The most efficient solutions are enclosed within a rectangular 
box in Figure 2.8, as beyond that region in either direction, there is a higher sacrifice 
of one objective to achieve a marginal improvement in the other.
The obtained PF, as shown in Figure 2.8, is found by the variation of decision 
parameters, which are shown in Figure 2.9. The graph’s x‑, y‑, and z‑axes represent 
the variation of parameters N, P, and S, respectively. The parameter M has been 
divided into four groups, namely, 90–120, 121–150, 151–180, and 181–210. However, 
none of the solutions from the 181–210 group are identified, marked by an asterisk 
(*) in Figure 2.9.
It is observed that increasing the mesh size has a negative impact on both MR and 
SF. The relationship between the non‑dominated solutions obtained using different 
decision variables can be better understood by examining Figure 2.9. It is evident 
that only a specific range of values for the parameter P (between 37 and 42.5 bar)

Multi-objective optimization
significantly impacts both the objectives, whereas the initial two levels of P are not 
effective for either objective. The last two levels of N and S parameters are highly 
effective in achieving good SF and MR. These effects are further studied in detail 
using Figure 2.10.
Figure 2.10 displays the effects of P, N, S, and M parameters on MR and SF. 
Figure 2.10(a) reveals that when P is set to 37.5 bar, MR is maximized, but SF is poor. 
As P is increased, MR decreases, and SF improves. NSGA‑II generates several solu‑
tions that can achieve good SF values close to 93% and MR values close to 32.5 mg 
at around 40.5 bar. SF was enhanced with an increase in P, as the higher axial force 
facilitated material removal in the form of microchips. MR is increased due to the 
deeper penetration of abrasive particles into the workpiece surface, as the radial force 
is increased at the higher P [8]. However, MR reached a maximum at an optimum 
value of 38 bar and then decreased as the depth of penetration reduced due to the 
shear‑thinning nature of the MR polishing fluid. Figure 2.10(b) shows that the value 
of N that is good for both the objectives is approximately equal to 1300. Increasing 
N further reduces MR, but it improves SF. SF is enhanced with an increase in the 
parameter N due to a continuous enhancement in surface texture. However, the abra‑
sive particles that initially cut the peaks of rough surfaces become worn out as N 
increases, and their effects on the polished surface are reduced due to increased 
hardness. Thus, it resulted in a poor amount of MR.
Figure 2.10 (c) shows that when S is kept equal to 210 RPM, MR and SF are 
both found to be good. However, increasing or decreasing S adversely affects both 
the objective functions. SF attains its maximum value at around 180 RPM of the 
parameter S. Beyond this value, SF is decreased, while MR increases. This trend can 
be attributed to increased tangential cutting force, which enhances MR. However, 
the centrifugal force acting on the abrasive particles indents the workpiece surface,

mesh size (M) in decision space.

resulting in a poorer SF [8]. Lastly, as seen in Figure 2.10 (d), several solutions can 
attain a good SF value as high as 87.5% and MR close to 35 mg, even at a mesh size 
of 90. As the mesh size increases, only fewer solutions are available, resulting in a 
better SF but a poorer MR. Both SF and MR improved at lower M. The higher M 
leads to more abrasives in the polishing medium due to a fixed concentration, and the 
abrasive diameter decreases at the larger mesh sizes. Consequently, the indentation 
force acting on each abrasive particle diminishes with increased mesh size, reducing 
the MR. However, SF reached its maximum value at approximately 170 RPM.
2.7  CONCLUSION
R‑MRAFF continues to emerge as an enticing choice for achieving exceptional 
nano‑level SFs, boasting a uniform, smooth mirror‑like surface (SF) with remark‑
able precision at the nano‑metre scale. Moreover, this process exhibits an impressive 
capacity for higher material removal (MR), surpassing the capabilities of preceding 
methods. By harnessing the synergistic effects of rotational motion and MaR abrasive 
particles, R‑MRAFF grants superior command over the material removal rate and 
SF, setting it apart as an advanced solution in the realm of nano‑finishing techniques. 
The significance of R‑MRAFF extends beyond its exceptional performance, as it

Multi-objective optimization
enables the selective finishing of both internal and external surfaces on intricately 
shaped workpieces. Furthermore, this technique proves invaluable in situations 
where conventional finishing methods struggle to access and address specific areas. 
Consequently, its potential spans a wide array of industries that demand meticulous 
SFs on cylindrical components. Notably, sectors such as aerospace, automotive, and 
medical industries get significant benefits from the transformative capabilities of 
R‑MRAFF.
In light of the comprehensive study conducted, the following conclusions have 
been drawn, shedding light on the optimal parameters and their corresponding 
outcomes:
•	 The optimal combination of parameters P, N, S, and M is found to be 39.14 
bar, 1175 cycles, 250 rpm, and 90 mesh size, respectively, to achieve the 
highest MR of 39.81 mg, while SF is improved by around 80%.
•	 The optimal combination of process parameters to achieve SF of 95.87% is 
found when the parameters P, N, S, and M are set to 41.34 bar, 1395 cycles, 
182 rpm, and 137 mesh size, respectively. The value of MR at the same 
parameter setting is found to be 24 mg.
•	 The higher levels of P, N, and S create a trade‑off between improving the 
SF and obtaining a high MR. However, the lower levels of M are suitable for 
both responses. This can help the decision maker to select other combina‑
tions of process parameters for the desired result in SF and MR.
•	 Only a few solutions are able to improve SF at the expense of lower MR, 
which suggests that enhancing SF is much more difficult than increasing the 
material removal using different combinations of parameters.
In summary, R‑MRAFF emerges as an exceptionally promising approach for achiev‑
ing superior nano‑level SFs, surpassing previous processes in terms of uniformity, 
precision, and material removal efficiency. Its application potential spans diverse 
industries, including aerospace, automotive, and medical sectors, where high‑quality 
SFs on cylindrical components are in high demand. Through the implementation of 
NSGA‑II optimization, this study not only highlights the efficacy of R‑MRAFF but 
also demonstrates the paramount importance of optimizing process parameters to 
attain the desired SF and material removal outcomes. By combining the strengths 
of R‑MRAFF and advanced optimization techniques, this research paves the way 
for advancements in SF technology and opens new horizons for impeccable surface 
quality in various industrial applications.

metallic mirrors

3.1  INTRODUCTION
Finishing is defined as a process which alters the surface of a workpiece to achieve 
the desired appearance or to remove machining marks and provide durability. 
Manufacturers often use a variety of finishing processes to improve their products. 
Without finishing, the lifespan of the products would be reduced due to corrosion and 
wear, and their function would be diminished. Some industrial applications require 
a very high level of surface finish and precision. The surface qualities needed to 
meet the demand for high precision and finish cannot be produced by conventional 
methods of finishing (like grinding, lapping, etc.). Manufacturers all across the world 
realized that high‑precision manufacturing was necessary to increase accuracy and 
promote micro‑ and nanotechnology.
The categorization of machining processes is based on the level of accu‑
racy achieved. These processes can be divided into three categories: standard, 
­precision, and ultra‑precision processes. The term “ultra‑precision machining” 
describes techniques that have attained or are capable of attaining the maximum 
level of dimensional accuracy at a specific time [1]. In conventional machining, 
the achieved accuracy typically reaches 1 μm, while 0.01 μm (10 nm) and 0.001 μm 
(1 nm) of accuracy can be obtained through precision and ultra‑precision machin‑
ing, respectively.
Common Conventional Finishing Processes:
	
a.	Grinding: The most commonly used method of finishing is grinding. A 
grinding wheel is used to grind the metal surface in order to remove any 
flaws or scratches. This can be done using a variety of abrasive materials.
	
b.	Polishing: Polishing is a surface finishing process and is used to get a 
reflective surface. The polishing process follows the grinding. The metal 
surface is polished using a series of finer and finer abrasive materials until 
the desired level of smoothness and shine is achieved. Polishing compounds 
can be used to speed up the process and achieve a more uniform finish.
	
c.	Buffing: Once the surface has been polished, it is buffed to further enhance 
the shine and remove any remaining imperfections. This can be done using 
a buffing wheel or pad and a polishing compound.

Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
	
d.	Electrolytic polishing: Electrolytic polishing is a process that uses an elec‑
tric current to selectively remove material from the surface of the metal. 
This can be used to remove any remaining surface defects and create an 
even smoother, more reflective finish.
	
e.	Vapour polishing: Vapour polishing is a process that involves exposing the 
metal to a vapour of a polishing agent, which then condenses on the metal 
surface, dissolving any surface defects. This process can be used to create a 
highly uniform, mirror‑like finish on complex geometries.
3.2  NANOFINISHING
Nanofinishing processes refer to ultra‑precise finishing techniques that have been 
created to achieve surface finishes at the nanometre level [2]. Initially, the term 
“nanofinishing” was used to classify machine systems and integrated manufacturing 
technologies capable of extremely precise machining with an accuracy of around 
1 nm. These procedures have been developed over the past few decades to get around 
some of the drawbacks of traditional finishing methods, such as the need for harder 
tools and the ability to control finishing forces precisely during operation.
By addressing these limitations, nanofinishing processes have enabled the fin‑
ishing of harder materials and improved control over the final surface characteris‑
tics during the manufacturing process. Additionally, advanced finishing processes 
(AFPs) utilizing loose abrasives have relaxed the constraints on finishing complex 
geometries by allowing abrasives to reach difficult‑to‑reach areas of a workpiece sur‑
face. Consequently, these recently developed finishing processes have significantly 
contributed to achieving the requirements of twenty‑first‑century manufacturing.
The demand for nano‑finished materials and products has surged across various 
industries, including aerospace, automobile, biomedical, and defence, among others.
3.3  NANOFINISHING OF METALLIC MIRRORS
Metal mirrors have been used by humans for at least 6000 years. But after it was 
discovered that glass with a small layer of metal is highly reflecting and, in addi‑
tion to other advantages, more scratch resistant, the use of metal mirrors started to 
decline. Copper mirrors, with their highly reflective surfaces, are believed to have 
been among the earliest metal reflectors used by ancient civilizations. Their discov‑
ery and utilization marked a significant advancement in human history, enabling the 
manipulation and redirection of light for practical and aesthetic purposes.
In the past century, metal mirrors made a remarkable comeback, driven by their 
distinct advantages that proved invaluable for a range of new and intriguing appli‑
cations. One notable application involved using metal mirrors as reflectors in laser 
systems. Due to their high thermal conductivity, these mirrors efficiently dissipated 
heat generated during laser operations, ensuring optimal performance and prevent‑
ing any potential damage. This thermal conductivity property became a crucial fac‑
tor in enhancing the overall efficiency and stability of laser applications.
Additionally, metal mirrors found utility in the field of telescopes. Their ability 
to bend and manipulate light beams played a vital role in shaping the optical path 

36
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
within telescopic systems. By precisely controlling the direction and focus of light, 
metal mirrors contributed to improving the accuracy and clarity of astronomical 
observations. This advancement opened up a plethora of opportunities for astrono‑
mers and researchers to explore the mysteries of the universe with enhanced preci‑
sion and depth.
The emergence of metal mirrors in these unique applications brought forth a wide 
range of new possibilities. Scientists, engineers, and innovators eagerly explored and 
capitalized on the specific properties offered by metal mirrors, ushering in an era of 
innovative technologies and scientific breakthroughs. Whether it was the efficient 
dissipation of heat in laser applications or the precise manipulation of light in tele‑
scopes, metal mirrors proved themselves as indispensable tools, revolutionizing their 
respective fields and inspiring further advancements.
Metal mirrors are widely utilized in optical applications, and three common 
materials for constructing them are aluminium, copper, and beryllium. Each 
material has its unique characteristics and benefits. Copper’s high thermal con‑
ductivity makes it especially desirable for laser applications. This means that it 
can effectively dissipate heat generated by the laser, making it a suitable choice 
for such purposes. Aluminium, on the other hand, offers good reflectivity even at 
shorter wavelengths. It is also lightweight and easily malleable, similar to beryl‑
lium. These properties make aluminium a versatile material for constructing metal 
mirrors that can be used in various optical applications. Beryllium is known for its 
stiffness and light weight, which are advantageous qualities for constructing metal 
mirrors. However, it has a significant drawback: it exhibits toxic behaviour. Due to 
this toxic nature, beryllium is not commonly used, despite its desirable mechanical 
properties. Safety concerns surrounding beryllium restrict its widespread usage in 
optical applications.
To achieve the required precision, the manufacturing process of metallic mirrors 
involves several consecutive steps, each serving a specific purpose. Here is an over‑
view of the steps involved:
	
i.	Prefabrication: The initial step involves shaping the metal material into the 
desired form. This can be done through techniques like machining, milling, 
turning, or casting, depending on the complexity of the component.
	
ii.	Stress relieving: Metal optics are prone to internal stresses induced during 
the fabrication process, which can lead to deformation or warping. Stress 
relieving techniques, such as annealing or heat treatment, are applied to 
reduce these internal stresses and ensure dimensional stability.
	 iii.	Plating: Metal optics may undergo plating, which involves depositing a thin 
layer of another metal or alloy onto the surface. Plating can enhance the 
optical properties, protect against corrosion, or provide a suitable surface 
for subsequent processing steps.
	
iv.	Figuring: Figuring is a crucial step that involves shaping the metal optic to 
achieve the desired optical surface form. It requires precision grinding, pol‑
ishing, and sometimes diamond turning or lapping techniques. This process 
helps achieve the required surface smoothness and curvature for optimal 
light transmission or reflection.

37
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
	
v.	Finishing: Once the desired shape and surface roughness are achieved, 
additional finishing steps may be performed to enhance the surface quality 
further. This can include processes like honing, buffing, or chemical treat‑
ments to remove any remaining imperfections, scratches, or contaminants.
	 vi.	Optical coating: Metal optics are often coated with thin layers of special‑
ized materials to enhance their optical performance. Optical coatings can 
reduce reflections, increase transmission, or provide specific spectral prop‑
erties. Common coating techniques include vapour deposition or sputtering.
Throughout these consecutive processing steps, precision and attention to detail are 
crucial. The use of advanced machinery, measurement tools, and skilled operators 
is necessary to ensure the final product meets the required specifications for shape, 
roughness, and optical performance. The overall goal is to produce metal optics that 
provide accurate and high‑quality light manipulation for various optical applications.
Numerous advancements are occurring in the field of material finishing using 
fine abrasives. These advancements encompass various aspects such as the processes 
involved, the types of abrasives utilized, and their bonding techniques. These devel‑
opments enable the achievement of surface finishes at the nanometre scale [2].
Alam et al. [3] investigated the subject and discovered that in the past there existed 
a constraint on the size of abrasives, typically around a few micrometres. However, 
recent advancements in materials synthesis have now made it possible to manufac‑
ture abrasives in the nanometre scale, allowing for ultra‑fine sizes. Abrasives are 
employed in different ways, including coated abrasives, bonded abrasives, such as 
grinding wheels, and loose abrasives like those used for lapping and polishing, all 
serving the purpose of creating components with diverse shapes, sizes, precision, 
smoothness, and surface integrity.
When the size of chips becomes extremely small, reaching atomic dimensions of 
around 0.3 nm, achieving the highest level of accuracy through finishing processes 
is possible. To achieve surface finishes at the nanometre scale, it becomes necessary 
to remove material by individually removing molecules or atoms, either separately 
or in clusters. Certain techniques, such ion beam machining (IBM) and elastic emis‑
sion machining (EEM), perform by directly removing atomic particles and mole‑
cules from the material’s surface. In contrast, alternate methods that rely on abrasive 
machining eliminate them in groups.
Depending on the type of energy they require, AFPs can be categorized as 
mechanical, thermoelectric, electrochemical, or chemical. The effectiveness and 
application of each particular process are influenced by the material of workpiece 
characteristics and the particular functional specifications of the component.
Precise control of finishing forces is crucial in mechanical AFPs. Numerous 
recently developed AFPs utilize magnetic or electric fields to control finishing forces 
on abrasive particles externally. The field‑controlled AFPs demonstrate significant 
potential for nanofinishing in metal optics, benefiting industries such as lasers, astro‑
nomical instruments, and consumer electronics. These sectors frequently employ 
metallic mirrors and other optical components to enhance system reliability and 
operational availability [1]. Due to its exceptional qualities such as high reflectiv‑
ity, good thermal conductivity, durability, and lightweight nature, the utilization  

38
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
of metallic mirrors becomes indispensable in the case of high‑power multi‑kilowatt 
lasers. Mirror finishing processes are versatile techniques employed on different 
metals like aluminium and copper, among others. The specific method chosen relies 
on factors like the metal type, the desired outcome, and the intended purpose of the 
final product. By employing appropriate processes, these metals can be transformed 
into reflective surfaces with a mirror‑like finish, catering to various industrial or 
aesthetic requirements.
Due to its high reflectance and lightweight nature, aluminium is a popular option 
for metallic mirrors. It surpasses all other metals in terms of reflectance in the 
ultraviolet and infrared regions, second only to silver in the visible light and near‑­
infrared ranges [4]. Copper, which ranks as the third most utilized metal globally, 
finds extensive applications in various domains such as integrated circuits (IC), air‑
craft, ultra‑precision machining, electric power, catalysis, and more. This is attrib‑
uted to its beneficial features like low resistivity, excellent electrical conductivity, 
and so on. When employing copper devices, it is imperative to ensure exceptional 
surface quality [5]. Titanium is an important metal due to its light weight. It has 
good corrosion resistance, mechanical characteristics, and biocompatibility [6]. 
Pure nickel has excellent physical and mechanical properties such as high cor‑
rosion resistance, high thermal strength, low friction coefficient, high hardness, 
strong wear resistance, non‑magnetic behaviour, good biocompatibility, and high 
electro‑catalytic activity [7].
3.4  ADVANCED MIRROR FINISHING PROCESSES
Advanced mirror finishing processes refer to a set of techniques employed to attain 
a superior level of shine and reflectivity compared to conventional mirror finishing 
methods. These advanced processes are particularly utilized in specialized indus‑
tries that demand extremely high precision and reflectivity, such as aerospace, optics, 
and other advanced technological fields.
	
1.	Single point diamond turning (SPDT): This technique involves removing 
material from the workpiece surface using a diamond tool, producing a fin‑
ish that is extremely precise and smooth. The SPDT tool is controlled by a 
computerized system (CNC machine), allowing for precise control of the 
cutting parameters and achieving exceptional surface quality.
	
2.	Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP): In CMP, the workpiece is polished 
using both chemical and mechanical processes in a combination. A slurry 
consisting of abrasives and chemical agents is applied to the workpiece, and 
a polishing pad or wheel is used to generate relative motion between the pad 
and workpiece. This process helps remove surface imperfections and obtain 
a highly reflective finish.
	
3.	Electrochemical finishing: This process utilizes the principle of elec‑
trochemistry to achieve mirror‑like surfaces. It involves immersing the 
workpiece in a solution of electrolyte and applying an electric charge. The 
controlled electrochemical reactions help in selectively removing material 
and smoothing out the surface, resulting in a high‑gloss finish.

39
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
	
4.	Magnetic assisted finishing: Magnetic fields are employed to precisely pol‑
ish the surface while controlling the finishing forces for material removal. 
The workpiece is immersed in a magnetic fluid and subjected to a mag‑
netic field that generates controlled forces on the surface. This method 
allows for accurate control over the finishing process and enhances surface 
smoothness.
	
5.	Laser finishing: Laser beams are used to modify the properties of work‑
piece surface in this process. The laser energy is carefully controlled to melt 
or vapourize the material, which helps in removing surface irregularities 
and achieving a polished surface. Laser finishing offers excellent precision 
and can be used for complex geometries.
These advanced mirror finishing processes enable industries to achieve exceptional 
levels of shine, smoothness, and reflectivity in their products. The use of these tech‑
niques is crucial in applications where optical clarity, precision, or reflective surfaces 
are essential for optimal performance.
The processes mentioned earlier have been thoroughly discussed in the subse‑
quent subsections:
3.4.1  Single point diamond turning
The single point diamond turning abbreviated as SPDT is a method of precise machin‑
ing used to remove materials on a very small scale, specifically in the nanometre 
range. It involves using diamond tools to cut and shape the material being machined. 
The capability of diamond turning to produce machined surfaces with excellent opti‑
cal quality is one of its main benefits. The surfaces created through diamond turn‑
ing have a high level of smoothness and accuracy, which is crucial in applications 
where precise optics are required [8]. For the creation of aspherical and diffractive 
surfaces, diamond turning is especially well suited. Diffractive surfaces are designed 
to manipulate light waves, and aspherical surfaces have a non‑spherical shape. Both 
types of surfaces are commonly used in optics and photonics applications.
The diamond tool used in the SPDT process possesses two attractive features: 
nanometric edge sharpness and wear resistance. The nanometric edge sharpness 
refers to the extremely small cutting edge of the diamond tool, which allows for the 
precise material removal at the nanometre scale. Wear resistance means that the 
diamond tool can maintain its sharpness and cutting performance for an extended 
period without significant deterioration.
By utilizing diamond tools in the SPDT process, it becomes possible to achieve 
sub‑nanometre surface finishes on metal mirrors. The resulting mirror surfaces are 
exceptionally smooth at the atomic or molecular level, allowing for high‑quality 
reflection of light.
Diamond tools undergo a grinding and lapping process to achieve a cutting‑edge 
radius in the sub‑micron range. However, tool cutting edge cannot be regarded as 
completely sharp due to the lower relationship between the tool nose radius and 
undeformed chip thickness. Ultra‑precision machining demonstrates superior capa‑
bilities compared to conventional processes. The quality of the machined surface 

40
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
in SPDT is primarily affected by parameters such as the temperature distribution 
between the tool tip and the workpiece, the cutting parameters, the tool geometry, 
and the orientation of the crystals on the workpiece. Like traditional machining, the 
diamond turning process involves the removal of material by moving the tool and 
workpiece together to achieve the desired shape and amount.
Diamond tools are carefully sharpened through a process of grinding and polish‑
ing to create an extremely fine cutting edge. However, despite this sharpness, the tool 
cutting edge is not perfectly sharp because the relationship between the radius of the 
tool’s edge and the material thickness being cut is not proportional. Ultra‑precision 
machining, which includes processes like diamond turning, is highly capable com‑
pared to traditional methods. In diamond turning, the cutting parameters (like speed, 
feed, and depth of cut) and tool shape have the greatest impact on the quality of the 
surface being machined, the orientation of the crystal in the material being worked 
on, and the distribution of heat between the tool and the workpiece. Like conven‑
tional machining, diamond turning involves removing material from the workpiece 
to achieve a desired shape by moving the workpiece and the tool together.
In a SPDT machine, a fixture secures the workpiece and it is pulled towards a 
vacuum chuck using vacuum pressure. The precise rotation of the spindle in this 
ultra‑precision machine is accomplished with air bearings. The movement of the 
machine’s axis is measured by a laser interferometer or a linear encoder, and the 
diamond tool is controlled by numerical commands. To maintain ideal conditions, 
diamond turning machines are housed in a controlled environment free of dust and 
with regulated temperature. Figure 3.1 depicts the SPDT machining system, which is 
composed of a vacuum chuck, a diamond tool, and a fixture attached to an aerostatic 
spindle. The diamond turning process is a dependable method for creating free‑form 
optics, metal mirrors for astronomical telescopes, and reflective mirrors.
In the study conducted by Li et al. [9 , they investigated SPDT and its ability to 
produce highly reflective surfaces to create extremely precise mirrors from Al6061, 
a type of aluminium alloy. The goal was to achieve a mirror finish with a roughness 
lower than 10 nm and with errors lower than 200 nm. The researchers performed 
FIGURE 3.1  Machining system of SPDT.

41
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
their experiments on an Al6061‑T6511 workpiece using an ultra‑­precision machine 
450UPL (Moore Nanotech). Fifteen samples were tested, and, during each test, spin‑
dle rotational speed and depth of cut remained fixed at 1000 RPM and 5 micrometres 
respectively. However, the feed rate, which represents the speed at which the tool 
moves along the surface, varied from 1 to 15 mm per minute for each sample. To 
measure the surface roughness, a white light interferometer (Zygo Nexview) was 
employed, which could analyse an area of 700 × 700 micrometres. The researchers 
found that the measured reflectance values were inconsistent at feed rates lower than 
7 mm/min, varying between 84% and 90%. Surface roughness dropped from 7 to 
5 nm as the feed rate drop even more, from 3 to 1 mm/min. On the other hand, when 
the feed rate exceeded 7 mm/min, the surface roughness decreased. This smoother 
surface led to an increase in reflectance. However, once the rate of feed was reduced 
from 7 to 3 mm/min, the surface roughness continued to reduce, but the reflectance 
stabilized at the same level. Chip formation during the machining process became 
unstable when the feed rate dropped lower than 3 mm/min, resulting in a decrease 
in reflectance, which was unfavourable for achieving the desired mirror‑like finish.
Zhang et al. [10] investigated the material removal mechanism and surface cre‑
ation of SPDT. Four quadruple‑symmetric fan‑shaped patterns were formed by the 
Cu (100) crystal plane, four double‑symmetric fan‑shaped patterns by the Cu (110) 
crystal plane, and six triple‑symmetric fan‑shaped patterns by the Cu (111) crys‑
tal plane. Molecular dynamics and cutting dynamics were integrated into a dual 
dynamic model to present the nano‑surface development in single‑crystal copper 
SPDT. Cutting dynamics modelling and molecular dynamics modelling are joined 
by the friction coefficient, which varies with atom configuration. The Cu (100) crys‑
tal plane is the best candidate for machining out of the three single‑crystal (110), 
(111), and (110) crystal planes because it produces the smoothest surface at a value of 
15.433 nm. The next crystal plane is Cu (111), with a surface roughness measurement 
of 17.016 nm. The greatest surface roughness, measuring 20.102 nm, was found on 
the Cu (110) crystal plane.
The study conducted by Zong et al. [11] is on the importance of diamond turn‑
ing in the fabrication of precision components in a variety of industries, includ‑
ing optics and renewable energy. In their experiments, the researchers used a 
machine tool called Nanoform 250 (manufactured by Taylor Hobson PNEUMO) 
and employed a diamond tool. Pure copper plates were selected as the material for 
the workpieces. The process parameters were as follows: 3000 rpm spindle speed, 
3 mm nominal cutting depth, and variable feeding velocity with varied feed rates. 
The experiments were conducted using four different tools with varying tool radii: 
Tool 1 had a radius of 1.856, Tool 2 had a radius of 0.954, Tool 3 had a radius of 
0.495, and Tool 4 had a radius of 0.045. The researchers observed that Tool 3 or 
Tool 4 provided a higher surface roughness than Tools 1 and 2. This finding sup‑
ports the idea that the elastic recovery and the minimum undeformed thickness 
of chip are dependent on the cutting‑edge radius in diamond turning. The surface 
roughness values achieved using the different tools were as follows: Tool 1 pro‑
duced a roughness value of 29 nm, Tool 2 a roughness value of 25.5 nm, Tool 3 a 
roughness value of 46.5 nm, and Tool 4 a roughness value of 15 nm. Therefore, by 
adjusting the process parameters and tool geometries based on a quantitative ratio 

42
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
of the maximum undeformed thickness of chip to the radius of cutting edge, it is 
possible to maintain the desired surface finish.
3.4.2  Chemical mechanical polishing
In the interest of increasing the material removal rate (MRR), chemical as well as 
mechanical processes are employed in CMP. By employing CMP, it becomes pos‑
sible to achieve a flat, smooth, and undamaged surface [12]. In the industry, there are 
four main types of CMP equipment that are widely utilized and considered repre‑
sentative. These include: (a) a rotary‑type polisher equipped with a wafer carrier that 
moves back and forth along the diameter of the platen, (b) a rotary‑type polisher with 
an oscillating carrier, (c) an orbital‑type polisher with an orbitally rotating platen, 
and (d) a linear‑type polisher that uses a linear motion belt for polishing purposes.
In the semiconductor industry, a standard tool called a rotary CMP tool is utilized 
to achieve surface finishing on wafers. This tool comprises a rotating plate known 
as a platen and a wafer carrier. Both the wafer and platen carrier rotate in synchro‑
nization, with the wafer carrier also moving back and forth along the platen’s radial 
FIGURE  3.2  Schematic of CMP equipment’s type: (a) rotary type with a reciprocation 
mode; (b) rotary type with an oscillation mode; (c) orbital type; and (d) linear type.

43
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
direction. The wafer, which is the item being polished, is held inside the revolving 
carrier, and a polishing pad is secured to the rotating disc. The required relative 
motion for the polishing process is generated by the movement of the platen and the 
carrier together. To facilitate the finishing procedure, a slurry consisting of chemi‑
cal solutions and particles is applied to the polishing pad, as depicted in Figure 3.3. 
These particles, ranging in size from 10 to 100 nanometres on average, serve as 
abrasive agents.
As a consequence of the interplay between the mechanical activities of the abra‑
sives and the chemical actions of the solutions, very little amounts of material are 
removed from the wafer’s surface while polishing. This allows for precise surface 
finishing to be achieved, which is crucial in the manufacturing of semiconductor 
devices.
To enhance the consistency of CMP for large‑size wafers, a new multizone car‑
rier is being developed. Properly designed polishing pads with grooves contribute to 
effective polishing. CMP relies on a complex consumable called slurry, which is a 
stable combination of abrasive, deionized water, and other chemicals. The balance 
and interaction of oxidants, inhibitors, and complexing agents significantly impact 
the polishing outcome. While CMP can achieve nanoscale finishes, it is only capa‑
ble of processing flat surfaces. An ideal nano finishing process involves removing a 
small amount of material. In an abrasive slurry‑based process, each abrasive particle 
should ideally create atomic or nanoscale surfaces. Additionally, it is crucial to pre‑
vent vibration transfer from the tool to the work surface. CMP, or EEM, possesses 
all these desirable features. It can also machine surfaces with various profiles by 
controlling the time of machining and tool motion.
Zhao et al. [12] investigated the application of CMP for achieving several desir‑
able outcomes in surface finishing. Zhao et al. found that by employing CMP, they 
were able to obtain a planar surface, meaning a surface that is flat and level. This is 
important in many applications where surface uniformity is required, such as inte‑
grated circuit fabrication or optical component manufacturing. The planarization 
achieved through CMP ensures that the entire surface is at the same level, eliminat‑
ing any height variations or steps that may be present.
Additionally, the authors stated that CMP was capable of producing a “nanofin‑
ishing” effect. Nanofinishing refers to the achievement of extremely fine surface fin‑
ishes at the nanoscale level. This is crucial in various high‑precision applications, 
FIGURE 3.3  Schematic diagram of CMP process.

44
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
including nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and advanced sensors. The ability of 
CMP to create such nanoscale finishing allows for enhanced performance, improved 
optical properties, and increased functionality of the finished surfaces. Overall, the 
research conducted by Zhao et al. [12] demonstrated that CMP is an effective method 
for obtaining planar, smooth, and damage‑free surfaces. The technique offers advan‑
tages in terms of surface uniformity and the ability to achieve nanofinishing, making 
it a valuable process in industries that require high‑precision surface characteristics.
Joshi et al. [13] explored that CMP is capable of achieving nanofinished surfaces. 
The study utilized a setup comprising stacked X‑Y stages and a decoupled Z stage. 
The workpiece was placed within an acrylic tank filled with abrasive slurry, which 
was mounted on a dynamometer attached to the X‑coordinated three‑axis motion. 
The investigation considered three types of independent variables: (1) process con‑
dition variables, (2) abrasive slurry variables, and (3) tool stiffness variables. The 
major polishing parameters were identified as the rotational speed and applied load, 
which influenced finishing of surface by affecting polishing pressure and thickness 
of hydrodynamic film. The stiffness of the tool was also examined as it could impact 
polishing pressure in the hydrodynamic film. Polishing was conducted for differ‑
ent durations: 3, 13, 23, and 35 minutes. With increased polishing time, the surface 
roughness increased in response to higher load. However, the average surface rough‑
ness decreased when the size of the abrasive increased from 0.3 to 1 μm over time 
(specifically at 23 and 35 minutes). Optimal spindle speed for achieving the smooth‑
est surface was found to be 2400 rpm at shorter polishing durations. CMP demon‑
strated the ability to produce nano‑finished surfaces on hard materials, with the best 
average surface roughness (Ra) value achieved at 3.5 nm. A slurry containing 0.3 μm 
abrasive particles yielded the best surface finish for shorter finishing times (up to 
13 minutes), while a slurry with 1 μm abrasive particles resulted in the best surface 
finish for longer finishing times (after 35 minutes). Additionally, the surface finish 
improved when all polishing parameters were set to their minimum levels, including 
minimum abrasive concentration (0.05 μm size of particle), minimum stiffness of 
tool, minimum load (1 N), and minimum rotational speed (1000 rpm).
Kaushik et al. [6] investigated the use of titanium (Ti) and its alloys as important 
materials for achieving mirror‑finish surfaces through CMP. These materials are val‑
ued for their favourable mechanical properties, lightweight nature, and biocompat‑
ibility. In the study, a Ti alloy workpiece with dimensions of 15 mm³ was employed. 
The workpieces were securely held in Bakelite moulds during the polishing process. 
Mechanical polishing was carried out using a sequence of silicon carbide (SiC) abra‑
sive papers, followed by cleaning with ethanol and subsequent drying prior to CMP.
The polishing procedure was carried out manually using a semi‑automatic pol‑
ishing machine (LBQ060, Buehler) furnished with a high‑quality polishing fabric, 
operating at a rotational speed of 233 rpm. A freshly prepared polishing solution 
was utilized, which consisted of the following components: (i) 4 vol% emulsifi‑
able water‑soluble oil, (ii) 80 vol% deionized (DI) water, and (iii) 16 vol% of a 30% 
aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The resulting solution was sub‑
jected to ultrasonication for 10 minutes at room temperature. Observations revealed 
that after 10  minutes of polishing, the workpiece surface exhibited a mirror‑like 
­surface, shiny appearance with no visible scratches under optical micrographs. 

45
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
Analysis of the optical profiles of the polished surface indicated a surface flatness of 
approximately 0.90 μm, with a 2.33 μm of maximum height. Furthermore, the root‑ 
mean‑square (RMS) roughness (Rq) and arithmetic mean deviation of roughness 
(Ra) were determined to be 1.12 nm and 0.96 nm, respectively.
Zhang et al. [7] explored the properties of a novel environmentally friendly CMP 
slurry that comprised silica, malic acid, deionized water, H2O2, and nickel. The 
slurry exhibited excellent mechanical, physical, and chemical characteristics. The 
authors measured the peak‑to‑valley (PV) and average surface roughness (Ra) values 
to be 4.49 nm and 0.44 nm, respectively, using a scan area of 71 × 53 μm². Their find‑
ings revealed that pure nickel and its alloys exhibited the lowest surface roughness 
among the tested materials at the specified scan area. To understand the CMP mech‑
anism, the researchers employed infrared (IR) measurements. Initially, H2O2 facili‑
tated the oxidation of the nickel alloy, leading to the formation of nickel, chromium, 
and molybdenum oxides on the surface. Following that, malic acid subsequently dis‑
solved the nickel oxides while leaving the chromium and molybdenum oxides unaf‑
fected. The introduction of Ni2+ and Ni3+ ions into the CMP slurry, with malic acid 
chelated with these ions, prevented the discharge of nickel ions into the environment. 
Finally, the mechanically induced action of CMP removed the generated oxides.
3.4.3  Electrochemical finishing
Electrochemical polishing is a technique that is used to create a smooth and reflec‑
tive surface on metals and alloys. It is achieved through an anodic treatment, which 
means applying a positive electric charge to the metal. This method is highly effec‑
tive in achieving a mirror‑like finish on metal surfaces [14]. The success of elec‑
trochemical polishing depends on various elements, including the properties of the 
metal’s characteristic, the composition of the electrolyte (the liquid in which the 
process takes place), temperature, voltage, current density, and time. All of these 
variables interact to determine the process’s final conclusion. During anodization, 
different changes occur on the metal surface, such as etching (controlled removal of 
material), pitting (formation of small holes), deflashing (removal of excess material), 
the formation of a passive film (protective layer), self‑organization of nanostructures 
(arrangement of very small particles), deburring (removal of rough edges), trimming 
(reshaping), and smoothing [14].
When using anodic polarization for electropolishing, the choice of the electrolyte 
becomes crucial. It must have specific chemical properties to achieve the desired 
results. When trying to create mirror‑like finishing on metals or alloys, the use of 
aqueous solutions is limited. This is because water can react with the electric cur‑
rent, leading to the generation of molecular oxygen instead of the desired polishing 
effect, Eq. (3.1)
	
2H2O − 4e− → O2 + 4H+	
(3.1)
Although water is not as reactive as base metals, its reactivity in aqueous solutions is 
still significant. In the context of electrochemical polishing, the evolution of oxygen 
during the process leads to the formation of secondary metal oxide films. Only a few 

46
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
metals can be polished to have a glossy surface in aqueous acid solutions. These met‑
als need to be resistant to acids and have thin passive oxide films on their surface, 
such as stainless steel, nickel, copper, platinum, and similar materials. However, for 
most significant metals for industry, anodization in acid solutions results in pitting or 
etching rather than achieving a mirror‑like surface. To understand the fundamental 
process, it is necessary to consider the electrochemical oxidation of water that takes 
place on the surface of metal. The pores of the oxide layer were penetrated by water 
molecules (H2O). H+ ions were consequently electrochemically generated and moved 
in the opposite direction, towards the cathode, as a result. These hydrogen ions can 
react with the metal oxide and the rate at which they migrate to the cathode as well 
as the oxide layer thickness determine the likelihood of the heterogeneous chemical 
reaction, which leads to the dissolution of the oxide layer, Eq. (3.2). This dissolution 
of the oxide film is a critical factor for achieving a mirror‑like metal surface as it 
helps to reduce the diffuse scattering of light.
	
MxOy + 2yH+ = xM+(2y/x) + yH2O	
(3.2)
Equation (3.2) represents a chemical reaction involving a metal oxide (MxOy), hydro‑
gen ions (H+), metal ions (M+), and water (H2O). The reaction shows the transforma‑
tion of the metal oxide and hydrogen ions into metal ions and water [14].
The probability of this reaction occurring, as described in Eq. (3.2), decreases 
when the rate of migration of hydrogen ions (H+) to the cathode (positive electrode) 
increases. The rate of H+ migration is affected by a number of elements, including the 
viscosity of the electrolyte (the medium in which the reaction occurs), the porosity, 
thickness, and chemical characteristics of the oxide layer, as well as current den‑
sity, temperature, voltage, and other variables. In the context of electrochemical pro‑
cesses, ionic liquids have gained significant attention as electrolytes. Ionic liquids are 
a type of non‑aqueous electrolyte that consists of ions. They possess unique proper‑
ties that make them advantageous compared to aqueous solutions. These advantages 
contribute to the growing interest and increased utilization of ionic liquids in various 
electrochemical processes.
The electrolyte used in electropolishing metals and alloys greatly influences the 
process due to its chemical nature. Various industries, such as microelectronics, space 
technology, aerospace construction, medical instruments, and biocompatible alloys, 
require highly reflective metal surfaces resembling mirrors. Electropolishing serves 
a similar purpose to the dissolution process, where an electric current is passed to 
remove the roughness of a surface and obtain a smooth surface. Outer layers of base 
metals and alloys consist of natural oxide films with varying compositions, cover‑
ing imperfections in the crystalline structure. The attainment of a brilliant reflective 
surface involves a series of intricate steps, including the removal of metal oxides and 
controlled elimination of surface defects.
The efficiency of electropolishing relies on the chemical characteristics of the 
layer, which differ from one metal or alloy to the next. Generally, the mechanism of 
metal surface electropolishing involves the uneven removal rates of the protective 
films and the actual metal atoms from different areas of the surface. Equation (3.2) 
can be used to get rid of these oxide films in both aqueous and non‑aqueous solutions. 

47
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
In non‑aqueous solutions, the oxidation of residual water leads to the generation 
of hydrogen ions. After the removal of the oxide coating, the edges of the crystal 
structure undergo surface smoothing at an increased current density. The removal 
of oxide films through chemical dissolution, as described in Eq. (3.2), is not the sole 
process responsible for their elimination. In cases where hydrogen ions are absent 
or scarce (such as in ionic liquids), the likelihood of electrochemically dissolving 
oxides increases, and they have the potential to undergo processes involving one or 
two electrons.

especially for the low valence metals such as tin, copper, lead, etc.
Sun and Zou [15] devised a hybrid finishing approach that combines the advan‑
tages of magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF) and electrochemical machining (ECM). 
This study focused on investigating the finishing mechanism and finishing charac‑
teristics of the electrochemical magnetic abrasive finishing (EMAF) process. In their 
study, the EMAF technique was split into two finishing processes. The EMAF step 
serves as the first finishing step, while one MAF step serves as the second finishing 
step. The passive films formed via electrochemical reactions can simply polish the 
metal surface. The passive films can also be removed simultaneously by friction 
between the workpiece surface and a magnetic brush. The goal of the EMAF process 
is to create and remove passive films from the surface of the workpiece. It is undeni‑
able that the EMAF process increases finishing efficiency over typical MAF by more 
than 75%, and the surface roughness is significantly reduced. The greatest experi‑
mental outcome of the EMAF procedure saw the surface roughness reduced from 
the initial value of 178 nm to less than 30 nm after 4 minutes in the EMAF stage, and 
it was finally reduced to 20 nm after 10 minutes in the MAF stage. In comparison to 
the MAF stage, about seven times as much material was eliminated during the hybrid 
finishing stage. Additionally, the EMAF process’s effective finished area was only 
around 70% of the MAF process’s.
By translating an electrolyte jet, Kawanaka et al. [16] have created unique electro‑
chemical mirror finishing techniques, and the effects of translating speed and current 
conditions on surface roughness have been investigated. They looked at the three 
techniques for translating the electrolyte jet to mirror‑finish the surface of arbitrary 
shapes. They used electrolyte jet machining process to mirror‑finish the stainless 
steel (SUS304). The first technique makes use of a very fast jet translation speed. An 
expensive XY table with high feed speed and accuracy is required for this method. 
The second method has a low machining rate because it uses monopolar pulse cur‑
rent with a long interval and short duration. Bipolar pulses are proposed as a third 
method for speeding up machining. The surface roughness can be controlled by the 
current density (25 to 100 A/cm2) in the electrolyte jet.
Regardless of the current density, it is feasible to reduce surface roughness when 
utilizing direct current by accelerating translation. The lowest surface roughness 
obtained at a translating speed of 100 mm/s was identical to that achieved with‑
out translation. Even when the translating speed was less than 1 mm/s, the use of 

48
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
monopolar pulse current with a short duration of 100 μs and a duty factor of less than 
10% was able to achieve a mirror‑like surface finish with Rz 0.2 μm. However, the 
rate of material removal was very slow. This led to the bipolar pulse current approach 
being proposed, and successful mirror finishing with duty factors above 50% was the 
result.
Maehata et  al. [17] found that large workpieces made of stainless steel and 
regular carbon steel can be mirror‑finished quickly and effectively using the 
­electrolytic‑abrasive method, producing surfaces with a roughness of up to 0.01 to 
0.02 μm Rz. To produce the machining effect, they combined electrolysis with abra‑
sive grains. With the help of grain action, metal is removed from this process mostly 
via electrolytic dissolution, which is proportional to working current and time, or 
subject to Faraday’s law.
The anode metal is dissolved in an ionic unit when direct current and voltage are 
applied to two facing metals in an electrolytic solution. According to Faraday’s law, 
the amount of the dissolved metal W is proportional to the amount of electricity 
applied I × t (current × time), expressed as
	
W = kIt (g)	
where k is the electrochemical equivalent built into an anode material and η is the 
current efficiency used for dissolution and influenced by oxygen generation or oxide 
film formation; η is a proportion between a theoretical value and the amount of metal 
actually removed.
Wang et al. [18] explored a new stress‑free machining process to create a copper 
(Cu) surface that is ultra‑flat and ultra‑smooth by combining electrochemical polish‑
ing (ECP) and jet electrochemical machining (Jet‑ECM). With precise MRR manip‑
ulation and nozzle trajectory planning, the Jet‑ECM process can effectively produce 
an ultra‑flat surface. ECP using the same electrolyte as the Jet‑ECM procedure can 
further reduce the workpiece’s surface roughness. In accordance with the findings, 
the surface PV value, which represents the surface form error of the Cu surface, was 
decreased from 4.4 to 1.7 μm, and the surface roughness Ra was decreased from 70.3 
to 13.5 nm. Jet‑ECM and ECP, which use the same electrolyte and apparatus, can 
significantly reduce surface roughness and flatness.
3.4.4  Magnetic assisted finishing
In magnetic assisted finishing (MAF) processes, the goal is to improve the surface 
quality of a workpiece by applying precise finishing forces. Unlike traditional finish‑
ing methods where the forces are applied directly by mechanical means, MAF relies 
on the control of a magnetic field to exert these forces.
By controlling the distribution and strength of the magnetic field, the finishing 
forces applied on the workpiece can be precisely governed. This control allows for 
adjustments in the intensity of the finishing process, enabling fine‑tuning of the sur‑
face quality achieved.
The advantage of using magnetic fields in finishing processes is that the forces 
can be controlled externally and adjusted as needed, providing a more flexible and 

49
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
controllable approach compared to traditional methods. This control allows for bet‑
ter precision, reduced damage to the workpiece, and the ability to achieve complex 
surface geometries and tolerances.
Overall, in magnetic assisted finishing (MAF) processes, the finishing forces are 
externally controlled by manipulating the magnetic field, leading to improved sur‑
face quality of the workpiece through selective material removal or polishing.
Following are the magnetic assisted finishing processes utilized for metallic mir‑
ror finishing:
3.4.4.1  Magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF)
In MAF, a workpiece is placed between two poles of a magnet, with one pole being 
North (N) and the other being South (S). Magnetic abrasive particles (MAPs) occupy 
the space between the workpiece and the magnet. This creates a magnetic field that 
forms a flexible brush called magnetic abrasive flexible brush (MAFB). The MAFB 
functions as a tool with multiple cutting points. The MAF process finds application 
in various industries, including automotive, aerospace, and medical device manu‑
facturing, where precise finishing is necessary [19]. MAF allows for the finishing of 
complex shapes and hard‑to‑reach areas. It provides a range of surface finishes, from 
rough to highly polished. It is suitable for finishing different types of metals, such 
as steel, stainless steel, aluminium, and titanium. MAF is particularly advantageous 
when working on intricate geometries or parts that have challenging areas to access. 
Compared to other finishing methods, MAF is relatively fast and efficient. It can be 
easily automated for large‑scale production. Furthermore, MAF generates less waste 
and has a lower environmental impact compared to traditional finishing techniques 
like grinding or polishing.
The process involves three main components: the workpiece, the magnetic fluid, 
and the magnetic field. The workpiece is typically made of a material that is difficult 
to finish using traditional methods, such as ceramics, glass, or certain metals. The 
FIGURE 3.4  Magnetic abrasive finishing process.

50
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
magnetic fluid is a solution of MAPs in a liquid, such as water or oil. The magnetic 
field is generated using a magnetic coil or electromagnet.
In one of the researches on MAF on aluminium sheet, experiments were per‑
formed on a TN 50 vertical milling machine [4]. The North (N) and South (S) mag‑
netic poles are positioned next to each other (Figure 3.5). In this arrangement, the 
grains of MAPs are attracted towards the magnetic poles, causing them to move 
away from the work surface rather than being compressed into it by magnetic forces, 
as shown in Figure 3.6.
As the magnetic poles rotate, the grains are pushed outward by centrifugal forces 
(as shown in Figure 3.7). When paired with the work surface’s linear feed action, 
these grains effectively remove the high points or peaks on the surface. It can be 
visualized that larger grains with stronger magnetic forces are more effective at 
removing surface peaks, so increasing the size of MAP grains is advantageous for 
finishing flat surfaces. However, this is not the case for finishing cylindrical surfaces.
In this specific work carried out by Givi et al. [4], the chosen material is an alumin‑
ium alloy, which is widely used in the aerospace industry. The aluminium sheet being 
worked on has a thickness of 1 mm. The machine table reciprocates back and forth at 
a feed rate of 20.00 mm/min to provide a consistent finish throughout the whole work‑
piece surface. They carried out studies to determine the effects of various parameters 
on the finishing process and roughness of a surface. They observed that increasing the 
weight of flexible magnetic abrasive brush (FMAB) led to an increase in the number 
of particles engaged in the finishing process. This, in turn, resulted in an improve‑
ment in the roughness of the surface within a specific time of polishing. The rotational 
speed of the poles was found to have a significant influence on the roughness of sur‑
face improvement. Higher rotation speeds were associated with better surface quality.

Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
However, the effectiveness of higher rotation speeds diminished at extremely high rates 
due to the compensatory influence of reduced finishing pressure. The researchers also 
examined the effect of powder volume on the finishing process. They found that while 
increasing the powder volume had some positive effects, these effects were not signifi‑
cant and had limited impact on the overall finishing process.
After conducting their experiments, the researchers identified the ideal param‑
eter values that led to significant enhancement in surface finish. The key parameters 
determined were as follows: the number of cycles was set to 6, the working gap 
was maintained at 1.5 mm, the rotational speed was set at 300 rpm, the weight of 
powder used was 2 g, and the process conditions applied were those specified in this 
study. They recommended a feed rate ranging from 20 mm/min to achieve desirable 
results. Ultimately, employing these parameter settings in the experiments resulted 
in a reduction of surface roughness (ΔRa) by 0.267 μm compared to its initial value.
3.4.4.2  Magnetorheological finishing (MRF)
MRF is a precise finishing process that utilizes a magnetic field to assist in achieving 
high surface accuracy and low surface roughness. It was developed and brought to 
market by QED Technologies Inc [20]. MRF can be used on a wide variety of materi‑
als, such as optical glasses and hard crystals. In MRF, the polishing fluid, known as the 
magnetorheological polishing (MRP) fluid, possesses unique rheological properties 
that can be controlled by adjusting the magnetizing current in the electromagnet coils. 
The carbonyl iron particles (CIPs) and ultra‑fine abrasives are suspended in a carrier 
fluid in the MRP fluid. When a magnetic field is introduced into or removed from this 
fluid, reversible changes in its rheological properties occur. When a magnetic field is 
present, the CIPs acquire a magnetic dipole moment proportional to the strength of the 
field. They align themselves in chain‑like structures in the direction of the field, creat‑
ing interconnected columnar formations. Non‑MAPs are inserted within or between 
these columnar structures. The rheological properties of the MRP fluid, along with the 
bonding strength between the abrasive particles and the CIPs in the presence of the 
magnetic field, are crucial for the effectiveness of the MRF process.
MRF offers a significant benefit through its exceptional precision and surface 
quality. It excels at achieving remarkably smooth surfaces with roughness at a 
sub‑nanometre scale. This makes MRF particularly valuable in industries such as 
optics, electronics, and other advanced fields where precise surface finishing is of 
utmost importance. The versatility of MRF allows it to polish a diverse array of 
materials, ceramics, glass, and metals. It is a highly automated process that can be 
continuously monitored and controlled in real time, resulting in an efficient and con‑
sistent manufacturing method. As a result, MRF has emerged as a vital technology 
in numerous industries that rely on high‑precision surface finishing.
3.4.4.2.1  Magnetorheological fluid (MR fluid)
MRF processes rely on the MR effect demonstrated by CIPs and abrasive particles 
suspended in a non‑magnetic carrier medium. The MR fluid and its composition have 
a significant impact on MRF performance. MR fluids, which were first discovered by 
Rabinow in 1948, are classified as smart fluids due to their ability to exhibit varia‑
tions in rheological behaviour in response to an applied magnetic field [21].

52
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
MR fluids are made up of micron‑sized magnetic particles floating in a visco‑
elastic base medium such as water, silicone oil, glycerol, or paraffin oil, as well as 
certain additives. These fluids display non‑Newtonian behaviour in the absence of a 
magnetic field, specifically weak Bingham behaviour. However, upon the applica‑
tion of a magnetic field, the fluid’s rheological properties change, becoming stiffer 
and requiring a significant shear force to induce flow. It is important to note that the 
maximum strength of an MR fluid is restricted by its magnetic saturation point.
The carrier liquid chosen is critical in establishing the temperature ranges in 
which MR fluids can be used efficiently. Although silicon oil is commonly employed 
as the carrier liquid, hydrocarbon oil offers certain advantages due to its lower vis‑
cosity, improved lubrication properties, and suitability for high shear‑rate applica‑
tions. Additionally, an MR fluid based on hydrocarbon oil exhibits a lower zero 
field viscosity compared to its silicone oil‑based counterpart, with the former being 
approximately 0.6 times less viscous. Conversely, a water‑based MR fluid presents 
the benefits of minimizing waste disposal issues and facilitating easy particle recy‑
cling from the material [22].
In concentrated MR fluids, the presence of remnant magnetization in the particles 
leads to undesired particle aggregation. This phenomenon contributes to the forma‑
tion of stiff sediments that are challenging to redisperse. To address this issue and 
mitigate particle aggregation and settling, various approaches have been proposed in 
the literature. These include:
	
1.	Including thixotropic agents such as carbon fibres and silica nanoparticles 
[23, 25].
	
2.	Incorporating surfactants like oleic or stearic acid [22].
	
3.	Introducing magnetic nanoparticles [24, 25].
	
4.	Utilizing viscoplastic media as a continuous phase [26].
	
5.	Utilizing water‑in‑oil emulsions as carrier liquids [27].
These proposed methods aim to enhance the dispersion and stability of MR flu‑
ids by reducing the adverse effects of particle aggregation and sedimentation. By 
implementing these strategies, the performance and usability of MR fluids can be 
improved in various applications.
In a recent research study Khan and Jha [28] conducted experiments involving 
copper, a well‑known diamagnetic material. Diamagnetic materials, when positioned 
in proximity to a permanent magnet, experience the induction of an equivalent mag‑
netic field within them. However, it is essential to notice that the magnetic flux den‑
sity within the diamagnetic material is lower than the magnetic flux density outside 
the diamagnetic material. As a result of the magnetization process in the diamagnetic 
material, the magnet and the induced magnetic field exert opposing forces on each 
other. This opposition causes the diamagnetic material to exhibit repulsion from the 
magnetic field, similar to the repulsion observed between two magnets when their 
magnetic flux densities oppose each other. It is essential to emphasize that the repel‑
ling force encountered by diamagnetic materials is exceedingly small in magnitude.
They looked into the magnetically controlled stiffened ball of an MR fluid that is used 
in the ball‑end MR finishing process. The workpiece material is copper. In ball‑end MR 

53
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
finishing, regardless of the type of base fluid, copper reacts with oxygen and the surface 
turns black and brownish in colour due to oxide formation. For the MR finishing of cop‑
per, BTA (benzotriazole)‑mixed MRP fluid was created as a solution to this issue. To 
improve the finishing effect on copper, this synthetic fluid uses larger‑particle electro‑
lytic iron powder (rather than CIPs). When compared to CIPs, larger magnetizable par‑
ticles (electrolytic iron powder) perform better in terms of scratch removal. According 
to the parametric analysis of the MRP fluid, increasing the abrasive concentration up to 
a certain limit increases the percent change in surface roughness (%ΔRa), but adding 
more abrasive causes the MRP fluid’s magnetic permeability to decrease, which causes 
the percent change in surface roughness to decrease; %ΔRa increases as the concentra‑
tion of electrolytic iron powder increases, but after a certain point (roughly 23 vol%), 
the results stabilize because the fluid is saturated in a magnetic field. According to an 
optimization study, the optimum concentrations of abrasive and EIP (electrolytic iron 
powder) for finishing copper are 14 vol% and 23 vol%, respectively. In 30 minutes of 
finishing, the surface roughness was decreased from 65.90 to 38 nm with a 42.34% 
improvement using the optimum polishing fluid composition.
A research study was carried out by Kansal et al. [2] on finishing of diamagnetic 
material using permanent magnets tool. In this study, the MR polishing fluid consists 
of 23% SiC abrasives, with particle sizes of 21 μm and 19 μm (two separate fluids were 
prepared). Additionally, it contained 17% CIPs with sizes of 37 μm, and a base fluid 
comprising 20% grease and 80% paraffin oil by weight, accounting for the remain‑
ing 60% of the composition. The selection of these compositions was based on the 
outcomes of preliminary experiments. Initially, SiC abrasive particles of 21 μm were 
employed for finishing the workpiece surface. Subsequently, SiC particles with a size 
of 19 μm were used for the final polishing of the surface of workpiece. For the experi‑
mentation process, a workpiece of a copper alloy with dimensions of 50 × 40 × 5 mm3 
was chosen. The finishing tool was rotated over the surface of the workpiece of cop‑
per alloy to achieve the desired surface finish.
This study investigates the effect of surface finishing on a workpiece of the cop‑
per alloy, focusing on the surface roughness parameters. Specifically, the roughness 
parameters Ra, Rq, and Rz were analysed before and after the finishing process. 
In the initial state, the workpiece exhibited surface roughness values of 273.6 nm, 
347.2 nm, and 1769 nm for Ra, Rq, and Rz, respectively. During the finishing pro‑
cess, which lasted for 7.5 minutes, a notable improvement in surface roughness was 
observed. The roughness parameters decreased to 28.8 nm, 38.1 nm, and 269 nm 
for Ra, Rq, and Rz, respectively. This reduction in roughness of surface indicates 
the efficacy of the finishing technique in enhancing the workpiece’s surface qual‑
ity. Furthermore, an additional improvement in surface roughness was achieved by 
reducing the size of the abrasives employed in the finishing process. By decreasing 
the abrasive size from 21 to 19 μm, a further decrease in roughness of surface from 
48.6 to 28.8 nm was attained. This finding highlights the importance of abrasive 
size selection in achieving desired surface finishes. This process can nano‑finish 
diamagnetic materials like copper, which is extremely valuable in industries such as 
aerospace, dentistry, lasers, etc., for metallic mirrors.
Alam et al. [3] explored that, in the traditional finishing processes, it is hard to 
finish copper to the order of nanometres with uncontrolled natural forces. Also, 

54
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
copper’s diamagnetic property limits the use of several complex magnetic‑assisted 
finishing methods.
In their research, a novel technique for polishing nonplanar copper mirrors 
using MRP fluid was investigated. An effective slotted tip and solid rotating core 
electromagnet‑­based finishing tool were developed and mounted on a five‑axis CNC 
system. When polishing diamagnetic copper workpieces, the solid spindle core and 
numerous slots at the tip increase the magnetic flux density and effectively grip the 
polishing fluid. In‑process control of the finishing forces acting on the copper work‑
piece is also made easier by the electromagnet‑based finishing tool. Using a dyna‑
mometer, forces acting on the workpiece during the finishing process were recorded 
and analysed to better understand the physics of the material removal mechanism. 
Using the novel tool, mirror‑like reflective surfaces were created on two nonplanar 
copper workpieces (convex and concave samples). Surface roughness of the two sam‑
ples was decreased in two finishing cycles with varying magnetizing current, from 
initial values of 120.1 and 129.2 nm to final values of 40.3 and 43.2 nm for convex and 
concave samples, respectively.
Hashmi et al. [29] developed a magnetic polishing tool with a 0.5‑tesla perma‑
nent neodymium magnet (Nd2Fe14B) that is extremely powerful. For the purpose of 
finishing workpieces, this polishing tool was put together with the vertical milling 
machine. In this study, a developed MRP setup was used to conduct experiments on 
magnetic materials (steel material) and non‑ferromagnetic (copper) content.
They looked into how various abrasives affected the magnetorheological finish‑
ing process parametrically. They assessed the impact of abrasives and magnetic 
particle concentration on the surface roughness of ferroelectric (copper) and non‑­
ferroelectric (stainless steel) materials. For non‑ferromagnetic (copper) material, the 
surface roughness value decreased from its starting value of 800 to 30 nm. The value 
was from 50 to 1300 nm for the magnetic material (stainless steel).
Ghosh et al. [30] observed that, in the electronics, space, and optical industries, 
a highly polished copper surface without any observable residual stress is in high 
demand. Due to its extremely poor hardness, copper cannot be properly finished 
using conventional finishing techniques.
The oxygen‑free high conductivity (OFHC) copper’s surface roughness is 
achieved in the current work using a wheel‑based MRF procedure. The working gap, 
feed rate, and wheel speed are chosen as the primary process control parameters. As 
the response parameters, areal surface roughness (Sa), normal force, tangential force, 
and residual stress are studied. Because residual stress can change the completed 
surface’s optical properties, measuring it is extremely important. Using the X‑ray 
­diffraction (XRD) technique, the residual stresses and phases of all the finished sur‑
faces are analysed. To forecast the surface roughness of surfaces processed by MRF, 
a theoretical model is put forward. It has been found that by using MRF with a higher 
working gap, lower wheel speed, and feed rate, a nanolevel surface roughness with 
lower residual stress can be achieved. They reported that the OFHC copper surface 
had a minimum surface roughness (Sa) of 15.5 nm and a compressive residual stress 
of 6.9 MPa.
A new MR technique was envisaged by Kansal et al. [2] for the precise surface 
finishing of materials with diamagnetic properties. The diamagnetic copper alloy 

55
Nanofinishing of metallic mirrors
workpiece was polished using MRP fluid along with two cylindrical permanent 
magnets. Rotation over the copper alloy workpiece surface while using a cylindrical 
permanent magnet tool with MRP fluid at its tip surface finishes the copper alloy 
workpiece. Models and simulations have been done for the diamagnetic copper 
workpiece, MRP fluid at the tip surface, and finishing tool for permanent magnets. 
The working gap’s magnetic flux density distribution is measured and examined. On 
a copper alloy workpiece, experiments are conducted, and the lowest Ra value of 
28.8 nm from its initial value of 273.6 nm is obtained in 7.5 minutes of finishing time. 
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are used 
to analyse the surface characteristics of polished and unpolished workpieces. The 
results of the experimentation and finite element analysis provide assurance that the 
innovative design of the MRF tool utilizing permanent magnets is able to nano‑finish 
diamagnetic materials like copper alloy and other similar materials.
3.4.5  Laser finishing
The working principle of laser finishing is based on the utilization of a high‑energy 
laser beam to induce surface modifications in a material. By focusing the laser 
beam onto the material’s surface, the energy imparted causes a significant increase 
in temperature, resulting in melting, vapourization, or ablation of the material. The 
laser beam’s intensity can be precisely controlled, enabling a wide range of material 
removal and modification capabilities. The laser beam can be focused to a small spot 
size, allowing for high precision and the creation of intricate designs and patterns.
Distinct laser finishing techniques employ different laser settings, including 
power density, pulse duration, and wavelength. For instance, laser engraving typi‑
cally employs high power density and short pulse duration to remove material and 
achieve deep engraving. Conversely, laser marking commonly employs lower power 
density and longer pulse duration to induce surface colour change or oxidation reac‑
tions without material removal.
The laser finishing process is influenced by material properties, such as thermal 
conductivity, melting point, and reflectivity, which necessitate careful selection and 
adjustment of laser settings and parameters according to the specific material and 
desired outcome.
The typical laser finishing process involves the following steps [31 :
Material preparation: The material to be processed undergoes cleaning, dry‑
ing, and preparation procedures specifically tailored for laser finishing.
Design preparation: Specialized software or CAD tools are utilized to create 
the desired design or pattern to be engraved or etched onto the material.
Laser setup: The laser machine is calibrated and configured to match the 
requirements of the specific material and design under consideration.
Laser processing: The laser is employed to remove material, mark, etch, or 
engrave the material’s surface as per the desired design. The laser energy 
can be adjusted to regulate the depth and width of engraved lines or patterns.
Quality control: The finished product undergoes inspection to ensure it con‑
forms to the desired specifications and meets established quality standards.

56
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
Laser finishing exhibits versatility by being applicable to a wide range of materi‑
als, including metals, glass, plastics, and ceramics. It is a precise and versatile 
process capable of creating intricate and detailed designs on the material’s sur‑
face. Furthermore, laser finishing is a non‑contact procedure, eliminating physical 
contact between the material and the laser, thereby reducing the risk of damage or 
deformation.
The laser surface finishing of 3D printed components created by material extrusion 
was studied by Lambiase et al. [32]. The surface of components made of polylactic 
acid (PLA) generated by material extrusion (ME) was treated using a 30W CO2 laser 
source operating in continuous wave (CW) mode. The mechanism of surface finish‑
ing was examined, and the effect of the laser treatment parameters on the surface 
morphology (scanning speed, energy density, and hatch distance) was established. 
Roughness measurements and optical microscopy were used to describe the surface 
of the treated samples. The outcomes showed that surface roughness could be greatly 
improved by laser finishing (more than ten times). However, interaction mechanisms 
incorporate surface ablation. To ascertain how the process parameters affected the 
surface properties, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out. To find the ideal 
process conditions, the response surface method (RSM) and multi‑response opti‑
mization (MRO) were also used. Thus, process parameters that reduced surface 
recession (0.1 mm) and increased surface roughness (from Ra = 16 𝜇m for untreated 
surface to Ra = 0.3 𝜇m under ideal process conditions) were identified.
In order to use dual‑beam lasers to quickly polish steel free‑form surfaces with 
a smooth surface finish, Zhou et al. [33] investigated an efficient “melting peak 
for filling with valley (MPFV)” technique. The dual‑beam comprises a top‑hat 
profiled pulsed laser beam and a CW laser beam. With high scanning speed of 
800 mm/s, a CW laser polished an initial rough surface down to Sa (= 426 nm), 
while a pulsed laser played a significant role in applying the MPFV method to 
polish the surface down to Sa (= 142 nm), closely following the CW laser in the 
trajectory of a zigzag‑­square wave. A semisphere (about 60 mm in diameter) was 
polished in only about 35.5 seconds, which led to a roughness decrease from the 
initial state value of Sa (= 877 nm) to the post‑polished value of Sa (= 142 nm) and 
a smoother surface ­finish. The effectiveness of dual‑beam laser polishing is above 
2890 cm2/H, which is more than 100 times that of manual polishing. This study’s 
key finding is that the zigzag‑­square trajectory makes the pulsed laser that follows 
the CW laser implement the MPFV method more effectively and efficiently than 
the standard process.

4.1  INTRODUCTION
Nanofinishing uses nanotechnology in surface modification processes for diverse 
materials, including bioimplants. It entails modifying and regulating materials at 
the nanoscale level to improve their characteristics and capabilities. Nanofinishing 
methods may be utilized to enhance the surface properties of bio‑implants, such 
as roughness, wettability, and biocompatibility. Bio‑implants are biological substi‑
tutes to repair, maintain, or change wounded tissues and organ function [1]. They 
play an essential role in orthopaedic and dental applications, providing solutions 
for various medical issues. When creating bio‑implants, biocompatibility is crucial. 
It refers to  the implant material’s compatibility with the biological environment, 
which ensures the implant can operate appropriately without generating undesirable 
responses in the body. The study of nanofinishing has brought about revolutionary 
improvements in biomedical implant applications, revolutionizing the manufactur‑
ing process and giving enormous possibilities for improving surface characteristics 
critical to obtaining optimum functional performance [2]. The primary goal in bio‑
medical implant applications is to achieve particular surface finishes on implanted 
components. These surface qualities guarantee the implants’ biocompatibility, lon‑
gevity, and general performance. Nanofinishing techniques have emerged as critical 
tools for attaining these same surface finishes while protecting the integrity of the 
implant surfaces [3]. This study focuses on understanding the vital role that finish‑
ing procedures play in achieving specified surface qualities for optimum functional 
performance. These activities, which occur at the end of the manufacturing pro‑
cess, reduce the surface roughness, eradicate flaws, and improve the integrity of 
the implant surfaces [4]. Nanofinishing procedures give the precision and control 
required to overcome the constraints of older approaches, enabling us to unleash the 
full potential of implant surfaces and deliver more excellent clinical results.

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
The need for specialized techniques is undeniable when working with compli‑
cated free‑form surfaces, which involve flexible finishing equipment capable of 
attaining nanometre‑level surface finishes while assuring the absence of any surface 
or sub‑surface flaws. Notably, this need occurs in various applications, such as the 
production of human implants, as shown in Figure 4.1, where free‑form surfaces are 
prominent [5].
The use of nanofinishing technologies in biomedical implants brings new con‑
cerns and potential. Complex implant surfaces, such as knee joints, hip joints, and 
turbine blades, provide unique problems requiring nanometre‑level surface finishes 
with no surface or sub‑surface flaws [6]. Engineers have investigated the possibili‑
ties of computer numerical control (CNC) and robotics to offer exact relative motion 
between the workpiece and the finishing tool, allowing the creation of specialized 
nanofinishing procedures adapted to free‑form surfaces.

4.2  BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS AND BIOCOMPATIBILITY
Various factors influence medical implants’ biocompatibility, as shown in Figure 4.2. 
Material selection involves choosing biocompatible materials for the implant. Surface 
characteristics involve the properties of the implant surface, including roughness and 
topography. Design considerations focus on factors like shape and biomechanical 
compatibility. Patient factors encompass individual health and specific patient char‑
acteristics. Corrosion resistance aims to prevent material degradation and corrosion. 
Mechanical compatibility ensures that the implant’s mechanical properties align 
with biomechanical requirements. Surface morphology considers the roughness and 
topography of the implant surface. Chemical stability involves maintaining stability 
and compatibility with physiological conditions. Immunological response minimizes 
immune reactions and promotes favourable tissue responses. Sterility and infection 
control emphasize the importance of sterile manufacturing and infection prevention. 
Degradation properties focus on controlling the degradation rate of biodegradable 
implants. Additional factors include patient‑specific conditions, healing capacity, and 
FIGURE 4.2  Factors affecting the biocompatibility of medical implants.

metabolic considerations. Considering these factors is crucial for ensuring the bio‑
compatibility and success of medical implants.
Implant integration into the human body depends on structural design and func‑
tioning, the materials employed, and their interaction with biological processes. 
Understanding the qualities and features of various materials is critical in this con‑
text for creating successful and biocompatible implants.
Table 4.1 summarizes the most often used materials in medical implants and their 
essential features and uses. These materials were carefully selected for their unique 
mix of strength, biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, and other vital characteris‑
tics. Healthcare providers may improve patient outcomes and encourage effective 
implant integration by adapting material choices to individual implant needs.
4.3  CLASSIFICATION OF FINISHING METHODS 
FOR BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS
The surface properties of biomedical implants play a critical role in determining their 
biocompatibility and overall performance in healthcare applications. Nanofinishing 
techniques offer a precise way to control and improve these surface properties at the 
nanoscale level. This section discusses various nanofinishing techniques, as depicted 
in Figure 4.3, such as chemical‑mechanical polishing (CMP), electrochemical pol‑
ishing (ECP), ion beam smoothing (IBS), ultrasonic peening, abrasive flow machin‑
ing, vapour polishing, buffing, lapping.
4.3.1  Traditional nanofinishing processes
 Traditional nanofinishing processes (TFPs), such as grinding, honing, lapping, and 
buffing, fall within this category. These processes can achieve the nanometre‑level 
surface finish on various workpieces, but they have certain constraints related to size, 
shape, complexity, and material properties.
4.3.1.1  Grinding
Grinding operates on the fundamental principles of friction and abrasion. As the 
grinding wheel rotates, the abrasive particles on its periphery come into contact with 
the workpiece. Applying pressure and relative motion, the abrasive particles remove 
material from the workpiece surface. The cutting action is achieved by the sharp 
edges of the abrasive particles, which penetrate the workpiece material and shear off 
tiny chips [13]. Several factors influence the efficiency of grinding. The selection of 
the grinding wheel, including its composition, grain size, and bonding material, plays 
a vital role in determining the material removal rate and surface quality. The speed 
at which the grinding wheel rotates, known as the cutting speed, affects the cutting 
action and the heat generated during the process [13]. The depth of cut, which deter‑
mines the amount of material removed in each pass, is another crucial parameter.
Furthermore, the cooling and lubrication of the grinding zone are essential both 
for thermal control and for preventing excessive wear of the grinding wheel. Coolants 
and lubricants dissipate the heat generated, facilitate chip evacuation, and improve

surface finish. The choice of coolant or lubricant depends on the specific require‑
ments of the grinding operation and the workpiece material.
4.3.1.2  Honing
Honing relies on the principles of controlled abrasion to refine surfaces with preci‑
sion. During the honing process, an abrasive stone, also known as a hone, is pressed 
against the workpiece surface and moved along a defined path [13]. The honing 
stones consist of abrasive particles embedded in a bonding material, which provides 
stability and abrasion resistance. The honing action is achieved by interacting with 
the abrasive particles and the workpiece material. The honing stone removes mate‑
rial through cutting and ploughing as it moves across the surface [13]. The cutting 
occurs when the sharp edges of the abrasive particles shear off thin layers of mate‑
rial, while the ploughing step involves material displacement through pressure and 
friction. Various factors influence the performance of honing. The rotational speed 
of the honing tool, the stroke length, and the applied pressure determine the material 
FIGURE 4.3  Various nanofinishing techniques.

Exploring the frontiers of nanofinishing
removal rate and surface quality [13]. The selection of appropriate honing stones with 
the desired grit size and bonding material is critical for achieving the desired preci‑
sion and surface finish. Additionally, using lubricants or honing oils helps maintain a 
consistent cutting action, reducing friction and dissipating heat.
4.3.1.3  Lapping
Lapping is a nanofinishing process that utilizes a flat abrasive material known as a 
lap to grind and polish the surface of a workpiece. It is beneficial for achieving high 
surface finish and flatness levels required in applications such as optical lenses, semi‑
conductor wafers, precision mechanical parts, and biomedical implants that require a 
smooth and polished surface to prevent implant rejection [13]. Soft materials like cast 
iron or copper are used as a lap and coated with an abrasive paste or slurry to perform 
lapping. The workpiece is then placed on the lap and moved in a circular or oscillat‑
ing motion while pressure is applied. As the lap rotates, it removes material from the 
workpiece, smoothing and flattening the surface. The size and type of abrasive par‑
ticles used in the slurry can be adjusted to achieve a wide range of surface finishes, 
from rough to mirror‑like. Despite its benefits, lapping can be time‑consuming and 
expensive, particularly for large workpieces or materials that are difficult to lap, such 
as ceramics and hard metals [13].
Moreover, achieving consistent and accurate results requires skilled ­operators. 
However, lapping remains a valuable nanofinishing technique for producing 
high‑quality surfaces with precise flatness and surface finish for various applications. 
In the present context, lapping is considered one of the most effective nanofinishing 
processes for achieving high surface finish and flatness levels in multiple industries, 
such as optical manufacturing, semiconductor fabrication, and precision mechanical 
parts manufacturing [13]. It is also relevant in biomedical implants, where a smooth 
and polished surface is essential for proper functioning and to prevent implant rejec‑
tion. Despite its limitations, lapping remains a valuable nanofinishing technique for 
producing high‑precision surfaces.
4.3.1.4  Buffing
Buffing is a surface finishing process involving a buffing wheel or pad to remove 
imperfections from a material’s surface. The method uses a combination of friction 
and pressure to smooth and shine the surface. The buffing wheel is typically made 
of cotton, linen, or leather and can be impregnated with abrasives such as diamond 
or aluminium oxide for more aggressive material removal [13]. Buffing is often used 
in the final stages of the manufacturing process to enhance the appearance of the 
product.
In the context of nanofinishing for biomedical implant applications in healthcare, 
buffing can be used to smooth and polish the surface of the implant to a high degree 
of smoothness and shine. This can reduce the friction between the implant and sur‑
rounding tissue, which can help to minimize tissue damage, inflammation, and other 
adverse effects. Additionally, a highly polished surface can reduce the risk of bacte‑
rial adhesion and biofilm formation, leading to implant failure and infection [13]. 
Buffing can be combined with other hybrid nanofinishing techniques, such as CMP 

66
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
or ECP, to achieve a high level of surface finish and biocompatibility for medical 
implants.
These traditional nanofinishing processes play a significant role in achieving 
desired surface properties for biomedical implants. They offer precision and control 
in improving surface smoothness, dimensional accuracy, and geometrical form [13]. 
By employing these processes, the surface finish can be enhanced to meet the strin‑
gent requirements of medical implants, ensuring their biocompatibility and overall 
performance in healthcare applications.
4.3.2  Hybrid nanofinishing techniques
4.3.2.1  Chemical‑mechanical polishing
CMP is a nanofinishing process used to achieve a high degree of surface smoothness 
on various materials. The CMP process involves using a chemical slurry consisting of 
abrasive particles suspended in a chemical solution and a polishing pad. The chemical 
slurry is applied to the material surface, and the polishing pad is pressed onto it, with 
controlled pressure and speed, to achieve the desired surface finish [14]. CMP is widely 
used in the biomedical implant industry because it produces a smooth, defect‑free sur‑
face with excellent biocompatibility. CMP can be used on various materials, including 
metals, ceramics, and polymers, making it a versatile technique for medical implant 
manufacturing. The process can be used for different stages of implant fabrication, 
such as surface preparation, roughness reduction, and final polishing.
One of the main advantages of CMP is its ability to provide a high degree of 
surface uniformity across the entire surface of the material, including curved and 
irregular surfaces. This is achieved through the chemical action of the slurry, which 
chemically reacts with the material to remove any defects, along with the mechani‑
cal movement of the polishing pad, which mechanically removes any remaining 
imperfections [15]. Furthermore, CMP can produce surfaces with a wide range of 
roughness values, from sub‑nanometre to micrometre scales, depending on the size 
and type of abrasive particles used and the chemical properties of the slurry. This 
flexibility allows for producing surfaces with tailored roughness values for specific 
applications and materials. However, one of the limitations of CMP is the potential 
for contamination of the surface due to the use of the chemical slurry. Careful con‑
trol of the slurry composition and the polishing parameters is essential to avoid any 
unwanted chemical reactions or impurities on the surface.
Additionally, the polishing pad must be carefully selected to avoid scratching 
or marring the surface. In conclusion, CMP is a powerful nanofinishing technique 
widely used in the medical implant industry due to its ability to produce smooth, 
uniform, and biocompatible surfaces on various materials. The flexibility of the tech‑
nique allows for the production of tailored surfaces with specific roughness values 
for particular applications. However, careful control of the process parameters is 
required to avoid surface contamination and ensure consistent results.
4.3.2.2  Electrochemical polishing
ECP is a surface finishing technique that involves the removal of material from 
the surface of a metal by anodic dissolution in an electrolyte solution. In ECP, the 

67
Exploring the frontiers of nanofinishing
workpiece is immersed in an electrolyte solution while a current is applied between 
the workpiece and an electrode [16]. The anodic current causes the metal ions to dis‑
solve from the surface, resulting in a polished surface. ECP has several advantages 
over other surface finishing techniques, including removing surface defects, increas‑
ing corrosion resistance, and improving the surface finish. Additionally, ECP can be 
performed on complex shapes and delicate parts, making it a valuable tool in manu‑
facturing biomedical implants. ECP is commonly used for polishing metals such as 
titanium and its alloys, stainless steel, and cobalt‑chromium alloys. The electrolyte 
solution used for ECP depends on the metal being polished and the desired surface 
finish. For example, phosphoric acid and its derivatives are often used for titanium 
alloys, while sulphuric acid is used for stainless steel [17]. One of the critical fac‑
tors in ECP is controlling the current density and electrolyte flow rate to achieve 
the desired surface finish. Additives, such as surfactants and chelating agents, can 
also improve the surface finish and reduce the amount of material removal. Overall, 
ECP is a versatile surface finishing technique with many applications in biomedical 
implants due to its ability to produce high‑quality, defect‑free surfaces with improved 
biocompatibility and corrosion resistance [17].
4.3.3  Advanced nanofinishing techniques
4.3.3.1  Ion beam smoothing
IBS is a nanofinishing technique that uses a beam of ions to remove surface material 
and create a smoother surface finish. IBS is often used on metals, semiconductors, 
and other materials requiring precise surface smoothing, such as biomedical implants 
[18]. In IBS, a beam of charged ions is directed at the material surface, causing atoms 
to be ejected and the surface to be smoothed out. The process can be controlled with 
high precision, allowing for excellent adjustments to the surface topography. The 
ions used in IBS are typically argon or helium ions, which are accelerated to high 
speeds and focused onto the material surface. IBS can achieve surface roughness 
on the order of nanometres and can be used to create surfaces with various shapes, 
including concave and convex surfaces [19]. The significant advantage of IBS is its 
ability to smooth out surfaces without damaging the underlying material or changing 
its properties. This makes it a beneficial technique for creating biomedical implants, 
where biocompatibility and surface smoothness are critical for implant success.
4.3.3.2  Ultrasonic peening
Ultrasonic peening is a nanofinishing technique that uses high‑frequency mechani‑
cal vibrations to create small amplitude oscillations on the implant’s surface. These 
oscillations generate a localized stress field that induces plastic deformation, which 
helps to smooth out surface irregularities and improve the surface finish. The ultra‑
sonic waves are delivered to the surface using a sonotrode or a tool that vibrates at 
20 kHz or higher [20]. The tool is typically made of a hard material such as tungsten 
carbide or diamond. The peening is done in a liquid medium containing abrasive 
particles, which helps to enhance the polishing action. The process can be carried 
out in either a batch or a continuous mode [20]. Ultrasonic peening is particularly 
useful for finishing complex shapes and hard‑to‑reach areas. It has been shown to 

68
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
improve biomedical implants’ surface roughness, hardness, and wear resistance, 
thereby enhancing their biocompatibility and longevity.
4.3.3.3  Abrasive flow machining
Abrasive flow machining is a non‑traditional machining process that is used for the 
precision finishing of complex internal geometries of metallic, ceramic, and compos‑
ite materials. The process involves using a semi‑solid, viscoelastic abrasive media 
forced through the workpiece using a hydraulic or pneumatic pressure system [21]. 
As the abrasive media flows through the workpiece, it removes the unwanted mate‑
rial from the internal surfaces, resulting in an improved surface finish, reduced 
roughness, and improved dimensional accuracy. The process is beneficial for finish‑
ing complex shapes such as impellers, turbine blades, and nozzles. The advantages 
of abrasive flow machining over traditional finishing methods include improved 
accuracy, reduced tool wear, and improved surface finish [21]. The process can also 
be automated, making it ideal for mass production of high‑precision components. 
Abrasive flow machining has been used for various biomedical implant applications, 
including improving the surface finish of orthopaedic implants, dental implants, and 
cardiovascular stents.
4.3.3.4  Vapour polishing
Vapour polishing is a nanofinishing technique that involves exposing the surface 
of a material to a vapour of a suitable solvent or etchant, which causes the surface 
to undergo controlled dissolution. The process is typically carried out in a vacuum 
chamber, where the material is heated to a temperature that is above its melting or 
sublimation point but below its boiling point to create a thin layer of liquid on the 
surface [22]. The vapour of the solvent or etchant is then introduced into the chamber, 
where it reacts with the liquid layer to remove the material from the surface through 
condensation. Vapour polishing can be used to achieve extremely smooth and uni‑
form surface finishes on a wide range of materials, including metals, ceramics, and 
polymers. The technique is beneficial for polishing complex geometries and delicate 
structures, as it does not involve any physical contact with the surface, eliminating 
the risk of mechanical damage or distortion [22]. In biomedical implants, vapour 
polishing has been used to improve the surface smoothness and biocompatibility of 
materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and polyether ether ketone (PEEK), com‑
monly used in implantable medical devices.
4.4  CLASSIFICATION OF SURFACE CHARACTERIZATION 
FOR BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS
Surface characterization is a fundamental process that involves analysing physical 
and chemical properties of a material surface. It plays a critical role in comprehend‑
ing and optimizing the properties of implant materials, making it an indispensable 
component of biomedical engineering. By meticulously controlling the surface prop‑
erties of biomedical implants, such as roughness, chemical composition, and topog‑
raphy, it is possible to enhance their biocompatibility, corrosion resistance, wear 

69
Exploring the frontiers of nanofinishing
resistance, and other essential characteristics [5]. Figure 4.4 depicts various surface 
characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic 
force microscopy (AFM), X‑ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle 
measurement, and Fourier‑transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
4.4.1  Scanning electron microscopy
SEM is a powerful imaging technique that has significant relevance for healthcare, 
especially in nanofinishing for biomedical implant applications. SEM directs a 
focused beam of electrons at a sample surface, causing it to emit secondary elec‑
trons that can be detected and used to create high‑resolution images of the surface 
morphology and topography [23]. The technique is beneficial for analysing the sur‑
face characteristics of nanofinished biomedical implants, such as their roughness 
and defects, which are critical determinants of biocompatibility [23]. By providing 
detailed information on the surface properties of implants, SEM can help research‑
ers and manufacturers develop and optimize nanofinishing methods for improved 
FIGURE 4.4  Various surface characterization techniques.

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
implant biocompatibility and longevity. Combined with other surface characteriza‑
tion techniques like AFM and XPS, SEM can comprehensively analyse biomedi‑
cal implants’ biocompatibility and surface characteristics, facilitating their safe and 
effective use in healthcare.
4.4.2  Atomic force microscopy
AFM is another surface characterization technique critical in nanofinishing for bio‑
medical implant applications in healthcare. AFM works by scanning a probe over 
the surface of a sample and measuring the force between the probe and the surface 
[24]. This force data is then used to generate high‑resolution surface morphology 
and topography images. AFM is beneficial for analysing the surface properties of 
nanofinished biomedical implants, such as their roughness, texture, and topography, 
which are essential determinants of implant biocompatibility [24]. By providing pre‑
cise information on the surface characteristics of implants, AFM can help researchers 
and manufacturers optimize nanofinishing methods for improved implant biocom‑
patibility and longevity. Combined with other surface characterization techniques 
like SEM and XPS, AFM can provide a comprehensive analysis of the biocompat‑
ibility and surface characteristics of biomedical implants, helping to ensure their safe 
and effective use in healthcare.
4.4.3  X‑ray photoelectron spectroscopy
XPS is a valuable surface characterization technique widely used in nanofinishing 
for biomedical implant applications in healthcare. XPS works by bombarding the 
surface of a sample with X‑rays, which cause electrons to be ejected from the atoms 
in the sample [25]. These electrons are then analysed to determine the chemical 
composition of the surface. XPS is beneficial for studying the surface chemistry and 
elemental composition of nanofinished biomedical implants, which are essential 
determinants of implant biocompatibility [25]. By providing precise information on 
implants’ surface chemistry and elemental composition, XPS can help researchers 
and manufacturers optimize nanofinishing methods for improved implant biocompat‑
ibility and longevity. In combination with other surface characterization techniques 
like SEM and AFM, XPS can provide a comprehensive analysis of the biocompat‑
ibility and surface characteristics of biomedical implants, helping to ensure their safe 
and effective use in healthcare.
4.4.4  Contact angle measurement
Contact angle measurement is a widely used technique for analysing biomedical 
implants’ surface wettability and surface energy. It involves placing a droplet of liq‑
uid on the implant’s surface and measuring the liquid’s angle with the surface [26]. 
The contact angle measures the degree of wetting of the surface by the liquid, which 
in turn provides information about the surface energy and wettability of the implant 
[27]. A low contact angle indicates high surface wettability and low surface energy, 

71
Exploring the frontiers of nanofinishing
while a high contact angle indicates low surface wettability and high surface energy. 
The contact angle measurement results can be used to optimize the surface proper‑
ties of biomedical implants for specific applications, such as promoting cell adhesion 
or inhibiting bacterial colonization. Thus, contact angle measurement is an essen‑
tial tool in nanofinishing for biomedical implant applications in healthcare, helping 
improve medical implants’ performance and longevity.
4.4.5  Fourier‑transform infrared spectroscopy
Fourier‑transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a powerful analytical technique 
that can be used to analyse the chemical bonding and functional groups on the sur‑
face of implants. It works by shining infrared light on the implant’s surface and 
measuring how much of the light is absorbed by the material [28]. Different chemical 
groups and functional bonds absorb infrared light at different frequencies, allowing 
FTIR to identify and quantify the types of chemical bonds and functional groups on 
the surface. This information is crucial for understanding the surface chemistry of 
implants and how they interact with biological tissues. By analysing the FTIR spec‑
tra of nanofinished implants, researchers can gain insights into the chemical compo‑
sition of the surface and optimize nanofinishing parameters to achieve the desired 
chemical properties for improved biocompatibility [29]. FTIR is an essential tool in 
biomedical implant research, as it provides a non‑destructive, quantitative method 
for analysing the chemical properties of implant surfaces.
4.5  CURRENT CHALLENGES IN NANOFINISHING 
FOR BIOMEDICAL IMPLANTS
As nanofinishing techniques advance, several challenges must be addressed to fully 
harness their potential in biomedical implant applications. This section explores the 
current challenges in nanofinishing for biomedical implants, their limitations, poten‑
tial solutions, impact on healthcare, and future directions, as shown in Table 4.2. 
By overcoming these challenges, researchers and clinicians can pave the way for 
improved implant performance, enhanced biocompatibility, and personalized 
patient care.
4.6  EMERGING TRENDS FOR THE FUTURE OF NANOFINISHING 
IN BIOMEDICAL IMPLANT APPLICATIONS
In addition to addressing the current challenges in nanofinishing for biomedi‑
cal implants, it is crucial to explore the emerging trends and future directions that 
hold great promise for advancing this field. These trends encompass the develop‑
ment of new nanofinishing methods and other surface modification techniques, and 
the impact of nanofinishing on implant longevity, wear and tear, and other crucial 
factors. By embracing these trends, researchers and industry professionals can fur‑
ther enhance the performance and effectiveness of biomedical implants, leading to 
improved patient outcomes and healthcare advancements.

The field of nanofinishing is continuously evolving, and the development of new 
techniques plays a vital role in enhancing the quality and efficacy of nanofinished 
surfaces. Researchers are actively exploring novel approaches to achieve superior 
surface characteristics, such as enhanced smoothness, reduced roughness, and

functionality. For instance, combining nanofinishing with coatings, such as bioac‑
tive coatings, can promote osseointegration and improve implant stability. Moreover, 
incorporating nanofinishing techniques with antimicrobial surface modifications can 
help mitigate the risk of implant‑related infections. By exploring these synergistic 
approaches, researchers can unlock new possibilities for enhancing the biocompat‑
ibility and functional properties of nanofinished implants.
4.6.3  Impact of nanofinishing on implant longevity, 
wear and tear, and other factors
Understanding the long‑term performance and durability of nanofinished implants 
is crucial for their successful integration into healthcare practices. Researchers are 
actively investigating the impact of nanofinishing on implant longevity, wear and tear 
resistance, and other factors that affect their performance over time. This involves 
comprehensive studies to evaluate the structural integrity of nanofinished surfaces, 
the ability to withstand mechanical stresses, and resistance to corrosion and degrada‑
tion. By gaining insights into these aspects, optimizing nanofinishing techniques to 
enhance implant lifespan and reduce the need for revision surgeries is possible.
4.6.4  Future directions of nanofinishing
Several exciting directions hold promise for the future of nanofinishing in biomedical 
implant applications. These include:
•	 Development of advanced nanofinishing methods that can achieve pre‑
cise control over nanoscale features, surface energy, and topographical 
characteristics.
•	 Integrating nanofinishing with additive manufacturing techniques, such as 
3D printing, to fabricate complex and patient‑specific implant structures 
with improved surface properties.
•	 Exploration of bioactive nanofinishing approaches that promote enhanced 
tissue integration and stimulate favourable cellular responses for acceler‑
ated healing.
•	 Advancement in nanofinishing techniques for biodegradable implants, 
enabling precise surface modifications and controlled degradation profiles.
•	 Utilization of nanofinishing to create multifunctional implant surfaces, 
incorporating features such as drug delivery systems, sensing capabilities, 
and localized therapeutic interventions.
•	 Application of nanofinishing in combination with regenerative medicine 
strategies to optimize the integration of implants with host tissues and facil‑
itate tissue regeneration.
By pursuing these future directions, the field of nanofinishing can continue to evolve, 
leading to significant advancements in the design, manufacturing, and clinical uti‑
lization of biomedical implants. These developments can revolutionize patient care, 
improve treatment outcomes, and drive innovation in the healthcare field.

5 Understanding the 
role of nano‑micro 
surface topography on 
osseointegration and 
antibacterial properties
Deepak Patil
5.1  INTRODUCTION TO THE ROLE OF SURFACE 
TOPOGRAPHY IN THE BIOMEDICAL FIELD
The surface of the biomaterial is the first region that comes into contact with the 
physiological environment; hence, the initial biological response depends on inter‑
facial contact and the improvement of the surface properties by modification of this 
surface. From this perspective, the field of bioinspired surfaces fits well into the 
general field of biomimetic materials. The porosity of bone has been tried to be repli‑
cated in biomaterials for better osseointegration and till date researchers are working 
on it [1]. Additionally, extensive investigation of biological surfaces in recent years 
has revealed that these surfaces display unusual properties; for example, very high 
water‑repelling rough surfaces use the “lotus effect,” surfaces with high and adjust‑
able adhesion use the “gecko effect,” and non‑reflective surfaces use the “moth‑eye 
effect,” among others [1, 2]. It was highlighted that special surface wettability stems 
from a coordinated action between multiscaled surfaces and surface chemistry [3]. 
The hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity are the first parameters that affect the adsorp‑
tion of proteins [4]. Hydrophobic surfaces thermodynamically favour the adsorp‑
tion of proteins from aqueous solutions, but they also induce irreversible adsorption, 
which can denature proteins. On the other hand, hydrophilic surfaces may prevent 
proteins from being adsorbed.
Bacterial attachment is a major post‑implantation challenge. Bacterial adhesion 
mainly depends on three main parameters (Figure 5.1); the type of microorganism, 
the surface material on which the bacterial cell attached, and the surrounding envi‑
ronment [5]. For a manufacturer or surface engineer, the main focus is on the surface 
properties of implant materials. The nature of biofilm formation depends on surface 
properties such as surface chemistry, surface topography, and surface wettability 
[6, 7]. The surface properties of the bacterium also influence its attachment to the

The role of nano-micro surface topography
material surface. It includes the surface charge of the bacterium, the presence of 
nano‑size fimbriae, and flagella on the outer membrane, and the secretion of an extra‑
cellular polysaccharide. Among environmental parameters, fluid flow is the domi‑
nant factor. Because the microorganism changes its morphology, size, growth rate, 
and metabolism which resist shear forces are developed due to fluid flow. Therefore, 
the fluid flow influences the number of attached bacteria and the biofilm structure.
The emergence of new technologies and devices with reduced size requires new 
materials and surfaces with specific properties, such as low adhesion and friction, 
and non‑wettability, among others. These specific properties will depend on increas‑
ing the surface‑to‑volume ratio so that surface effects will dominate over volume 
effects [8].
The widely used titanium alloy implants for different applications is depicted 
in Figure 5.2. Physical and chemical properties, such as size, crystalline structure, 
charge, composition, and hydrophilicity, determine whether a biomaterial is biocom‑
patible. In other words, whether the best physical and chemical properties are suit‑
able will depend on the application of the biomaterial. For example, cardiovascular 
articulation implants demand good cell adhesion (Figure  5.2), whereas catheters 
require that cell adhesion be kept to a minimum to avoid contamination (Figure 5.3). 
In general, a suitable biomaterial must interact well with body cells and show good 
cell proliferation; that is, the surface of the biomaterial must be hydrophilic (high 
wettability), rough (to promote adsorption of proteins), and highly reactive, as well as 
present high surface energy [4, 9]. In this chapter, we further discuss these aspects of 
biomaterials, using polymeric, nanoparticulated, and titanium (Ti)‑based biomateri‑
als as examples.

The role of nano-micro surface topography
5.2  EFFECT OF NANOTOPOGRAPHY ON THE GROWTH OF CELLS
Surface wettability plays a vital role in the attachment and growth of cells [13]. The 
hydrophobic polymer surface of polylactic acid (PLA) is unfavourable for the attach‑
ment of mammalian cells; hence, surface treatment to yield terminal ‑OH groups, 
for example, renders them hydrophilic and more amenable for cell attachment [13]. 
However, the excessive ‑OH group can hinder the growth of mammalian cells. 
Hence, the most suitable solution is to develop nanostructures on the PLA scaffold 
to make it hydrophilic and this has been demonstrated in our recent study by using 
the 3D spin coating technique [14]. Figure 5.4 illustrates the process of generation of 
nanotopography on a 3D printed PLA scaffold. The nanostructures generated out of 
the 3D spin coating setup help in increasing surface wettability, which is attributed 
to the increase in the total surface area caused by nanoscale topographical features 
on the surface, resulting in a transition from Young’s to Wenzel’s state of wetting. 
Unlike surface modification by treatment with NaOH or other harsh reagents, which 
may be cytotoxic, the nanostructuring presented here utilizes two well‑established 
biocompatible polymers to alter the surface topography at the nanoscale [14].
Figure 5.5(a) shows the optical photos of bacterial colonies formed on PLA‑OH 
and nanostructured‑PLA surfaces with the corresponding quantification in CFU/mL 
in Figure 5.5(b). It was observed that the PLA‑OH surface helps with bacterial attach‑
ment and growth, whereas the nanostructures create unfavourable conditions for bac‑
terial attachment, which hinders bacterial colonization and growth. The confocal

fluorescent and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Figure 1.5(c) to 1.5(e) 
further corroborated these trends. The confocal micrographs showed that the nano‑
structures were bactericidal, revealed by a large number of dead (red) cells, unlike 
the PLA‑OH scaffolds, where the majority of the cells were viable (green).
For potential use as a bone tissue scaffold, it is vital to assess the response of 
mammalian cells, particularly osteoprogenitor cells, to the nanostructures on the 
3D printed PLA scaffolds. Thealkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was markedly 
higher on day 21 for both the PLA‑OH and the nanostructured‑PLA scaffolds as 
compared to day 7 (Figure  5.6(a)), which suggests that both the scaffolds effec‑
tively supported osteogenic differentiation. Notably, cells on nanostructured‑PLA 
scaffolds exhibited markedly higher ALP activity compared to cells on PLA‑OH

The role of nano-micro surface topography
scaffolds. Taken together, the nanoscale topography on nanostructured‑PLA concur‑
rently imparts multi‑biofunctional attributes to 3D printed polymer scaffolds, includ‑
ing mechanobactericidal activity, cytocompatibility, and osteogenic activity. In an 
era of increasing antimicrobial resistance strains, antibacterial yet cytocompatible 
3D printed scaffolds may be an effective alternative to biochemical approaches to 
minimizing infections. Thus, it is envisaged that such a scaffold can promote bone 
formation while minimizing the risk of implant‑associated infections with important 
implications for the orthopaedic regeneration field.
5.3  NANOTOPOGRAPHY GUIDES THE CELL GROWTH
The focused ion beam (FIB)‑SEM images shown in Figure 5.7 shows that the hMSCs 
cell form abundant filopodia around their periphery upon attachment to the biomedical 
grade cp‑Ti nanopillar (nanostructured‑Ti) surface. This is not the case in the cells resid‑
ing on the flat Ti surfaces (Figure 5.7(a)). The cells had settled on the nanostructured‑Ti 
nanopillars with a top state meaning that the whole cell body was spread on top of the 
nanopillars. Furthermore, any signs of the deep penetration of the nanopillars into the 
cell body (i.e. any ruptures or any signs of engulfment by the cell membrane) or local 
cell stretching in between the adjacent nanopillars were not observed (Figure 5.7(b)).
The high aspect ratio nanostructured‑Ti nanopillars have a remarkable potential 
to direct hMSCs towards osteogenic lineage commitment by manipulating cell adhe‑
sion as regulated by focal adhesion kinase (FAK), cell contractility as regulated by 
Rho‑Rho‑associated protein kinase (ROCK), and the nuclear translocation of tran‑
scriptional factors. Furthermore, these factors are interrelated and can modulate each 
other’s roles. In other words, an osteogenic mechanotransduction pathway can be pos‑
tulated in which the adhesion and adaptation of the cells to the extreme topography of

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
the surface are highly dependent on FAK, which works in close liaison with ROCK 
to increase the endogenous forces within the cells and determines the cell shape and 
area. Whether directly transducing the forces to the nucleus or indirectly enhancing 
the nuclear translocation of Yes‑associated protein (YAP), mechanical stimuli can 
be translated to biochemical factors, such as RUNX2 in the nucleus (Figure 5.8). 
Recent advances in the available manufacturing techniques are expected to facilitate 
the fabrication of 3D implantable structures out of 2D nanopatterned sheets [16, 17]. 
The availability of such 3D implantable structures would make in vivo studies pos‑
sible in the future to further investigate similar hypotheses and evaluate the ultimate 
potential of such meta‑biomaterials for bone tissue regeneration.
5.4  SURFACE MODIFICATION TECHNIQUES 
TO TAILOR THE SURFACES
5.4.1  Surface texturing
The surface texturing technique has been introduced in implant design to obtain 
the benefit of the lubricating effect. It was previously used on golf ball surfaces to 
improve their aerodynamic characteristics. Spiral grooves were produced on bearings 
to build up pressure to separate the bearing surfaces (Figure 5.9). Surface texturing is 
now employed in tribology, optics, physics, energetics, biomedicine, electronics, and 
metrology. This technique is popular in implant design due to the improved friction 
and tribological performances. It produces micro‑textures on implant surfaces that 
have several benefits over smooth surfaces: (i) they act as a lubricant reservoir [18]; 
FIGURE  5.7  (a) The representative SEM images of hMSCs settled on the flat Ti and 
nanostructured‑Ti surfaces for one day. Left column: low magnification images showing the 
cell morphology. Scale bar ¼ 20 μm. Right column: higher magnification images showing 
the presence (absence) of filopodia around the cell periphery on the nanostructured‑Ti (flat 
Ti) surfaces. Scale bar ¼ 5 μm. (b) A high magnification tilted view of the cell periphery

false‑coloured for better visualization (reproduced with permission from reference [15],

The role of nano-micro surface topography
(ii) they increase hydrodynamic pressure under sliding conditions [19]; (iii) they store 
the produced wear debris or foreign materials in dimples [20]; (iv) they decrease 
the contact area [21]; and (v) they minimize friction and wear [22]. Textured sur‑
faces are more effective, especially in boundary and elastohydrodynamic regimes. 
Micro‑dimple functionality is initially confirmed by correct optimization of its 
­geometrical parameters; still, the influence of dimples quality is not avoidable. 
Figures  5.9(a) and 5.9(b) show the fabricated surface texturing on articulating femo‑
ral heads and SEM images of different types of fabricated textured surfaces.
5.4.2  Surface coating
Improved wear resistance of artificial implants may be accomplished by the application 
of surface coatings. Surface coating provides morphological (topographical design), 
physiochemical (changes to surface energy, charge, or composition), and biochemical 
adaptations (how the cells react) to existing bulk materials. Surface coatings reduce 
adverse cellular response caused by the generated wear particles. Thus, it engenders 
the useful life of an artificial implant. Various hard and wear‑resistant coatings such 
FIGURE 5.8  A schematic illustration of conceivable mechanotransduction pathways trig‑
gered by high aspect ratio nanostructured‑Ti nanopillars in hMSCs. Cells largely depend on 
the activity of FAK and ROCK to maintain their normal shape and area on nanostructured‑Ti 
nanopillars. Whether through a direct pathway via focal adhesions (FAs) and cytoskeleton or 
through an indirect one by enhancing nuclear translocation of YAP, hMSCs may be directed 
towards osteogenic differentiation indicated by enhanced expression of RUNX2 and miner‑
alization (reproduced with permission from [15], copyright @Elsevier).

artificial implant applications. These coatings enhance the mechanical and physical 
properties such as hardness, elastic strain, and wettability of the surface. The improved 
wettability of the surface leads to the low friction and consequently the low wear of 
implant materials. Surface coating protects a bulk surface from tribo‑corrosion [23, 
24]. The performance of the coated surface also depends on the coating deposition 
technique. An ideal deposition process can provide quality surface such as a dense 
homogenous coated surface with excellent adhesion to the substrate.

The role of nano-micro surface topography
softness/stiffness, porosity, and roughness are key factors for the performance of 
a material in a range of biological environments [25]. Polymers are used as bio‑
materials. The bulk properties of polymers, such as conductivity, strength, polymer 
type, stiffness, and general resistance to deterioration, are considered during their 
selection for biomedical applications [26]. The lower molecular weight proteins start 
adsorbing on implant surfaces after implantation of biomaterials in a biological envi‑
ronment. A high rate of protein adsorption may result in higher friction. However, 
protein adsorption depends on chemical composition, surface roughness, and wetta‑
bility of the surface. Hence, surface modification techniques such as polymer graft‑
ing are effective to avoid biofilm formation and protect the surface from biofouling. 
They also improve wettability of the surface and provide a more hydrophilic surface. 
The polymer surfaces possess a brush‑like hydrophilic structure that is assumed to 
be similar to that of articular cartilage. The cartilage surface also has a hydrophilic 
nature due to its water‑soluble macromolecules. These hydrophilic macromolecules 
stimulate the fluid film formation and reduce the friction of the joints [27, 28].
There are two major antibiofouling strategies: The first is to repel the formation 
of the protein layer and subsequent attachment of bacterial cells and the second is 
to induce the self‑cleaning property in biomedical devices. The formation of the 
protein layer can be inhibited by modifying the implant surface through a layer of

peptide [29]. The common approach adopted for making antibiofouling surfaces is 
to render the surface superhydrophilic or superhydrophobic. Three broad categories 
of antibiofouling surfaces are summarized in Table 5.1 with their advantages and 
disadvantages.
5.5  STATE OF THE ART AND INTERPRETATION
The concept of textured surfaces has emerged from naturally existing textured sur‑
faces. There is a need to study the different kinds of nanotextured surfaces for vari‑
ous applications. The superhydrophobic metallic and polymer‑structured surfaces 
have been found suitable for reducing the attachment of bacterial cells. Laser textur‑
ing is one of the best techniques used to make large areas superhydrophobic metallic 
surfaces. From a fabrication point of view, there is a need to speed up the trans‑
formation time from metallic hydrophilic surfaces to superhydrophobic surfaces. 
Moreover, the bactericidal surface has a comparatively high antibacterial ability. 
Hence, a new effective method for the development of a bactericidal surface with 
excellent cytocompatibility needs to be developed. However, extreme care has to be 
taken to control the dose of bactericidal agents.
The use of chemical treatments to render a surface hydrophobic can lead to its 
rejection in biomedical devices owing to the violation of safety regulations. Hence, 
there is a need to establish physical processing routes for the creation of surface 
structures on polymers. The soft‑lithography technique can be explored as an 
approach for generating structured polymers with superhydrophobic nature. The 
lithographic techniques (e.g. electron beam lithography, photolithography) are highly 
suitable for developing a superhydrophobic polymer surface. The direct irradiation 
of laser on a polymer surface (e.g. polydimethylsiloxane) can alter the chemistry of 
the surface material and can also facilitate the release of excess silicon. Therefore, 
the soft‑lithography technique has been adopted in this thesis for making structured 
superhydrophobic surfaces which also gives the flexibility to change the shape and 
size of structures from the micron to nano level. There is a need to investigate bacte‑
rial adhesion from the micron‑ to nano‑level structures.
Considering the size of real‑life devices, it is important to have structures on a 
larger area. The methods adopted for the fabrication of superhydrophobic polymer 
surfaces are limited to a very small area. Therefore, the low throughput and high 
machining cost limit the use of these processes for real‑life applications. These nano‑
structures can be replicated on soft materials with the help of a hot embossing tech‑
nique. There is a need for the development of a hot embossing setup to manufacture 
micro‑nano structures on large areas with minimum processing time.

6 Investigating the 
material removal 
mechanism during 
magnetorheological 
finishing of extrusion 
punch surface
Anirudh Chana, Anant Kumar Singh, 
and Sunil Kumar Paswan
6.1  INTRODUCTION
The extrusion technique is in high demand because it has a significant advantage 
over rolling for the creation of intricate shapes [1]. In the metal‑forming business, 
this process is expanding quickly. The lessening of friction on the extrusion punches 
results in lower forces requirement for completion of the extrusion operation [2]. 
The effects of the controlled friction level on metal flow optimization for operations 
include forging, extrusion, and rolling [2]. By pressing the billet through a die dur‑
ing the extrusion process, the area of the cross‑section of the billet is reduced and 
given the appropriate shape [3]. Friction restricts the material flow through dies [4]. 
Temperature variations in the billet and friction between the die‑billet container both 
contribute to non‑uniform flow [5]. This friction acting between the surfaces of dies, 
billets, and surface roughness has a direct impact on extrusion punches.
To reduce the friction of the external surfaces of these components, conventional as 
well as non‑conventional finishing (NCF) processes have been developed. This chapter 
examines the material removal process used in a magnetorheological (MR) finish that 
was applied to the exterior of an extrusion punch, a real‑world industrial component.
Initially various kinds of conventional finishing (CF) processes such as grind‑
ing, lapping, and honing were used for improving the surface finish of the exter‑
nal surface of the extrusion punch. But, the constraints (uncontrolled finishing 
force, failure to finish upto nano level, introducing various kinds of surface defects) 
involved in those CF processes necessitated the NCF process for finishing the exte‑
rior surface of the extrusion punch. NCF techniques were therefore discovered to

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
minimize surface roughness up to the nano level [6]. Some of these NCF processes 
are categorized based on their finishing force control mechanisms [7]. Abrasive 
flow machining (AFM) [8], chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) [9], elastic emis‑
sion machining (EEM) [10], and rotational abrasive flow finishing (RAFF) [11] are 
examples of NCF procedures in which cutting forces cannot be regulated. The forces 
exerted on the abrasives in these processes are uncontrollable. In contrast, the mag‑
netic field‑based finishing method regulates the cutting forces [7]. Magnetic abrasive 
finishing (MAF) [12], magnetorheological finishing (MRF) [13], MR abrasive flow 
finishing (MRAFF) [14], ball end magnetorheological finishing (BEMRF) [15], and 
rotational magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (R‑MRAFF) [16] are a few of 
these processes that can be used to finish the exterior of cylindrical components. A 
magnetorheological (MR) solid core rotating tool was utilized by Maan et al. [17] to 
finish AISI 52100 steel with an HRC of 60–62. In 60 minutes, the surface roughness 
was decreased from 320 to 20 nm using anMR polishing fluid. Mulik and Pandey 
[18] finished AISI 52100 steel with a 61 HRC using an MAF setup. With the help 
of unbounded magnetic abrasive particles, the surface roughness was reduced from 
102 to 51 nm in 120 seconds. The MR abrasive honing type finishing procedure was 
developed by Sadiq and Shunmugam [19] for finishing the external curved surface. 
The workpieces were put in the holder’s cavity and held there by the end cap. In order 
to complete workpieces made of austenite stainless steel and aluminium alloy, the 
effects of magnetic flux density on changes in surface roughness were studied. From 
this research, a magnetic field’s threshold limit was discovered.
The current effort focuses on fine finishing the extrusion punch surface that is 
employed in an industrial tube extrusion process. The H13 die steel material, which 
has a hardness of 48–50 HRC, is used to make the extrusion punch. The final grind‑
ing process in the industry produces a surface roughness of 480 nm. According to 
the industry standard, the profile utilized for the tube extrusion punch is best for a 
specific operation. It was produced for the market in accordance with their standards. 
To further improve its functional uses in the extrusion process, the punch was taken 
from industry and subjected to the current MR finishing technique with a solid rotat‑
ing core tool. An experimental setup was created for fine finishing of the exterior 
surface of the H13 die steel material extrusion punch. The removal of material during 
the external surface finishing of the extrusion punch has been studied in this work. 
The experiments were carried out using the experimental setup that Anirudh Chana 
and Anant Kumar Singh created [20]. The extrusion punch was introduced in the 
industry after MR finishing to study how a decrease in surface roughness affected its 
use in the extrusion process.
6.2  MATERIAL REMOVAL MECHANISM
During MR finishing of the exterior surface of the extrusion punch, microchips 
caused the removal of the substance. This happens by the interfacing of abrasives 
of the polishing fluid and asperities of cylindrical workpiece’s exterior surface. The 
peaks of the surface roughness are affected by the rotation and reciprocal movement 
of the abrasive particles as well as the electromagnetic tool core finishing forces. It 
has been investigated how stresses on abrasive particles affect their ability to remove

material. Figure  6.1 shows a schematic representation of the material removing 
mechanism used in the current investigation to polish the exterior surface of the 
extrusion punch. This figure illustrates how material is removed from the cylindrical 
workpiece along the helical path. The combination of three motions—namely, the 
rotation of the cylindrical workpiece, the rotation of the magnetic tool core, and the 
reciprocating motion of the magnetic tool core along the axis of the workpiece—
leads to the abrasive particles tracking the helical path. Under the influence of the 
magnetic field, the magnetic iron particles organized themselves into a chain and 
moved in the direction of the high magnetic field, whereas the abrasive particles 
moved in the direction of the lower magnetic field. The particles that remove material 
from the surface of the workpiece are known as active abrasives [21]. The strength of 
the magnetic flux density in the working gap determines how tightly the iron particle 
chains that lock the abrasive particles are held together [21]. Greater the gripping of 
abrasives, better will be the finishing performance.
Figure 6.2(a) represents the condition before collision of abrasive particles and 
roughness peak on a cylindrical surface. Only the magnetic force acts on iron par‑
ticles which hold the abrasive. After the abrasive particle and roughness peak col‑
lide, Figure 6.2(b) demonstrates that three forces, normal force (Fn), tangential force 
(Ft), and axial force (Fa), are exerted on the abrasive particles. Due to normal force, 
iron particles force abrasive particles off of the surface of the cylindrical workpiece. 
The rotation of the tool and the cylindrical workpiece produces tangential force. The 
tool’s reciprocating motion along the axis of the cylindrical workpiece produces the 
axial force. The resistance offered by roughness peaks to active abrasive particles 
against tangential and axial forces. As seen in Figure 6.2(b), the normal force acting

causes indentations on the workpiece’s surface, while the product of tangential and 
axial forces causes shearing of roughness peaks. The resultant must be larger than 
the resisting shear force of material for removal of peaks to take place.

field problem is resolved by Maxwell Ansoft by designating materials, boundar‑
ies, and source circumstances. The Maxwell equations were used in a finite area or 
space. The model was made in Creo 3.0 and loaded into Maxwell Ansoft to test the 
magnetic field for the tool’s viability. The workpiece and the tool were imported into 
Maxwell Ansoft. As given in Table 6.1, the attributes were allocated to each model 
component. The environment was created around the model as shown in Figure 6.3. 
The model was analysed for ten pass runs. The finite element analysis (FEA) for the

of low magnetic strength [4]. Figures  6.6(a) and 6.6(b) represent the variation of 
magnetic flux on the tool surface along the x‑axis and y‑axis, respectively. It can be 
seen that the active region for the abrasive is 10 mm along the tool surface. The active 
abrasive region is in a circular area of radius 10 mm. In this region the magnetic field 
varies from 0.80 to 1.2 T. This region is accountable for holding the abrasives for 
finishing the workpiece surface and was used in a later section for the calculation of 
active abrasive particles.

tool for the magnetic field
Ferromagnetic particles become magnetized by the magnetic field that exists in the 
working gap. Using Eq. (6.1), the magnetic flux density at any location inside a work‑
ing gap was computed [23, 24].

tion. In the present tool n = 26, m = 130, and dg = 1 mm. Magnetic strength of solenoid 
(H) in the working gap was calculated by using Eq. (6.2) at each magnetic particle 
in a sole chain and is provided in Table 6.2. The magnetic strength was calculated at 
the tool face radius of 3 mm along the working gap. A working space of 0.76 mm was 
calculated for the tool radius of 3 mm between the flat tool and the cylindrical work‑
piece surface. After obtaining the magnetic strength at each point, the magnetic flux 
density can be calculated by using Eq. (6.1) in the working gap. The magnetic field 
can be determined by substituting the value of magnetization in Eq. (6.1) of magnetic 
iron particles around the working gap. The tool shaft, workpiece, and MR polish‑
ing fluid are the ferromagnetic materials in this study, and their respective relative 
permeabilities are 200, 180, and 5 [25]. The magnetic field is obtained at each point 
inside the working gap and provided in Table 6.3. As it can be experiential, as given 
in Table 6.3, magnetic flux density gradient is developed along the working gap. 
When compared to the surface of the workpiece, the tool surface has a higher density 
of magnetic flux in terms of magnitude. The changes in magnetic field attained theo‑
retically (Table 6.3) are shown in Figure 6.8(a).
Figure 6.8(b) illustrates how the magnetic flux density alters in the operational 
gap after a magnetostatic simulation. The magnitude is more in magnetostatic sim‑
ulation as compared to theoretical because of idle conditions during simulation. 
Figure 6.8(a) provides the linear equation for the disparity of magnetic flux density 
in the working gap, which is provided by Eq. (6.8).

normal force, while roughness peak shear strength is overcome by tangential and 
axial forces.
The following assumptions are taken into account:
•	 Both iron and abrasive particles have a spherical and consistent shape.
•	 The working gap has a homogeneous distribution of iron and abrasive par‑
ticles, and the computation of normal magnetic forces does not account for 
magnetic leakage or losses.
•	 When using a surface roughness model, calculations are made based on the 
assumption that the cylinder’s surface is uniformly rough.
•	 The shearing of roughness peaks results from the resultant of tangential and 
axial force, whereas the indentation of abrasives on the workpiece is caused 
by the normal magnetic force.
•	 Because of the low rate of material removal, combining the removed mate‑
rial does not change the properties of the MR polishing fluid.
•	 In the chain structure of the iron particles, which is continuous in the work‑
ing gap, are abrasive particles.
•	 A rounded active zone was considered in order to calculate the helix effect 
on the active abrasive region.
Figure 6.9 shows the resistant forces when abrasive particles come in contact with 
the workpiece surface. When the normal force (Fn) and shear force (Fs) acts on 
abrasive particles, resisting normal force (Rn) and resisting shear force (Rs) occur. 
The indentation as well as shearing of peaks take place when Fn > Rn and Fs > Rs, 
respectively [23].
6.3.3.1  Unit cell and iron particles in a chain structure
It is crucial to examine how magnetic fields affect both magnetic iron particles and 
non‑magnetic abrasive particles in order to comprehend the forces operating on an 
abrasive particle. Under the influence of the magnetic field, iron particles develop 
magnetic dipole moments [4]. It was discovered that magnetic iron particles orga‑
nize themselves into dipole chains when the forces of dipole interaction outweigh the 
forces of thermal interaction [4]. Under the influence of the magnetic field, a gradient 
in the magnetic field is produced in the working gap. Iron particles travel towards high

magnetic field gradient regions, while non‑magnetic abrasive particles move towards 
low magnetic field gradient regions [4]. It was discovered that the abrasive particles 
assemble themselves in the iron particles’ continuous chain structure. The form of 
iron particles was thought to be spherical. Spherical particles are aligned in a mag‑
netic field to produce the chains [26]. The form of abrasive particles is also spherical, 
and they move very slowly. It was believed that the unit cells are repeated in the MR 
polishing fluid column in order to calculate the quantity of iron particles. Therefore, 
the primary goal was to count the number of iron and abrasive particles in a unit cell.
6.3.3.2  Unit cell
In this research, MR polishing fluid consisted of 30% by vol magnetic particles of 
400 mesh size and 15% by vol abrasives of 800 mesh size. The diameter of abrasive 
and iron particles was evaluated by using Eq. (6.9) [27].

where dμ is the diameter of particles in microns and m represents the mesh size of 
particles. By using Eq. (6.9), it was found that the diameter of iron particles was 38 
μm for 400 mesh size and the diameter of abrasives was 19 μm for 800 mesh size.
The number of magnetic particles (NIP) in a certain volume V of MR polishing 
fluid is given by Eq. (6.10) [26].

While using the values ∅IP  = 30%, V = 1 mm3, and VIP = 2.873 × 10−5 mm3 it was 
found that 10,441 iron particles existed in the MR polishing fluid by using Eq. (6.10). 
The volume occupied by a single iron particle was 9.57 × 10−5 mm3 in 1 mm3 MR 
polishing fluid. Similarly, abrasive particles were 41,767 in mm3 MR polishing fluid 
and the volume occupied by a single abrasive was 2.35 × 10−5 mm3. The edge length

6.3.3.4  Determination of the magnetic force acting on an iron particle 
and the indenting force acting on an abrasive particle
The active abrasive particles are what indent the workpiece’s surface. Under the 
influence of the magnetic field, the magnetic iron particles exert normal force on the 
abrasive particles. The force that ordinarily acts on the abrasive particles that cause 
indentation determines finishing performance. Using Eq. (6.14) [23], the magnetic 
force exerted on an iron particle was computed.

(Eq. 6.15) exerted on the iron particle in the working gap allowed one to determine 
the indentation force (Find) acting on the abrasive particle. Table 6.4 lists the magnetic 
force, that is, Find can be calculated by using Eq. (6.17) [28]. Eq. (6.17) represents the

The previous section estimated the indentation force (Find) acting on abrasive 
particles. This force is responsible for indenting the abrasives in the workpiece. 
Indentation causes depression in the workpiece surface, as shown in Figure 6.13(a). 
The indentation in the workpiece surface is calculated using the Brinell model. The

For Find = 3.15 × 10−10 N, HBHN = 400 Kgf/mm2 (H13 steel), Dabr = 19 μm. The

6.3.4.2  Evaluation of the number of active abrasives
Active abrasives are the abrasive particles that carry out the polishing process. The mag‑
netic flux density at the workpiece surface from the tool tip surface was used to select 
the active abrasive particles. As mentioned above (Figure 6.4), a magnetostatic FEA 
was carried out. It was found that a circular area of 10 mm had the minimum magnetic 
flux of 0.95 T, as shown in Figure 6.4. Magnetic flux density in the area of the active 
abrasives ranges from 0.95 to 1.2 T. Active abrasives can be calculated by calculat‑
ing the area of active abrasives ABCD, as shown in Figure 6.14. On the surface of the 
workpiece, the circular tool tip’s projected area creates an ellipse. The area of the ellipse 
shown in Figure 6.14(b) has to be calculated. From Figure 6.14(b), OP is the radius of the 
cylindrical workpiece = 30 mm and PC is the projection of the active abrasives region on 
the workpiece surface = 10 mm. To measure the angle α, Eq. (6.21) was used.

Two movements are responsible for finishing of workpiece surface, namely, transla‑
tion motion of tool and workpiece rotation. Due to the combination of these two 
actions, the material is removed from the workpiece surface in the shape of a helical 
channel in Figure 6.15(a). The helix angle varies with these motions. The helix angle

As can be seen from Table 6.6, the number of active abrasives does not vary much for 
different combinations of workpiece rotation as well as tool feed. From Table 6.5, it 
can be seen that the range of pitch is from 1 to 3.33 mm for the selected range of tool 
feed and workpiece rotation. The active abrasive region can vary up to a large extent,

6.4  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To determine whether the tool can be used to finish the H13 die steel material, an 
investigation of the developed tool was conducted. FEA was done on the tool using 
Maxwell Ansoft (student version). It was found that the magnetic flux of 0.8 to 1.2 T 
was generated in the working gap. The gradient of magnetic flux density is greatest 
near the surface of the tool and decreases towards the surface of the workpiece. For 
the purpose of calculating the magnetic flux density in the working gap, a theoretical 
model was created. Using Eq. (6.2), the magnetic flux density was computed. The 
range of the magnetic flux is 0.68 to 0.7 T. The change in magnetic flux gradient in 
the working gap is comparable to the FEA results. The indenting force was calcu‑
lated after determining the magnetic flux density. The roughness model was devel‑
oped for the H13 material. During the MR finishing of a cylindrical workpiece, the 
theoretical model created for surface roughness was verified experimentally. In this 
section the results obtained during validation are discussed.
6.4.1  Experimental validation for the surface roughness model
The theoretical model developed was validated experimentally. Experiments were per‑
formed on the H13 workpiece. The MR polishing fluid was made in preparation for the 
experiment. An MR polishing fluid made up of 80% heavy paraffin and 20% grease as 
the carrier medium, 30% iron particles, and 15% abrasive particles was employed.

ness was achieved as 0.206 μm with 1200 finishing cycles, as shown in Figure 6.16(d).

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
To forecast the surface roughness reduction for finishing a cylindrical item 
composed of H13  material utilizing the MR fluid‑based finishing technique, the 
mechanism of material removal was investigated. Process parameters are chosen in 
industries based on trial and error. It takes time to choose parameters through trial 
and error. This mechanism analysis can aid in forecasting the outcomes of finishing 
as well as the impact of particular parameters on the effectiveness of finishing for 
H13 material. The anticipated number can have an inaccuracy between 1.25 and 
6.79%. By using this mechanism a lot of time can be saved in deciding the param‑
eters for the finishing operation.
6.5  CONCLUSIONS
Based on the study conducted on the material removal mechanism over the cylindri‑
cal workpiece manufactured of H13 die steel using MR polishing fluid, some key 
conclusions which have been made are as follows.
•	 The trend of variation of the magnetic field between the tool and work‑
piece linearly decreases towards the workpiece surface, which confirms the 
indentation force applied to the workpiece surface via active abrasive par‑
ticles in this work.
•	 In the MR finishing process, the working gap, the magnitude of the mag‑
netic flux density, and the size of the magnetic iron particles and abrasive 
particles have a substantial impact on the indentation force, which directly 
responds to the finishing operation.
•	 The maximum percentage error between the experimental and theoretical 
surface roughness (6.79%) advocates that the theoretical study conducted in 
this work is in good conduct and it is the consequence of the assumptions 
made for the current study.
•	 The present theoretical roughness model can be useful in industry to predict 
the fine finishing of cylindrical items composed of a H13 material utilizing 
the current MR fluid‑based finishing technique. This results in a lot of time 
savings in deciding the parameters and level of the fine finishing.

7 Advanced finishing 
processes for internal 
cylindrical surfaces
A review
Manish Kumar, Shrushti Maheshwari, 
and Zafar Alam
7.1  INTRODUCTION
Finishing is considered to be the last stage in the manufacturing process. The surface 
finish of manufactured components is a critical factor in determining their perfor‑
mance and longevity, as it directly impacts their wear resistance, corrosion resis‑
tance, and power loss resulting from friction and strength against crack initiation 
and propagation. Roughly 15% of the overall manufacturing expenses are allocated 
towards the completion phase. Evidently, enhancing surface finish even by a unit 
micron can reflect upon the total cost to a great extent [1].
With the rising requirement for sustainable products with high accuracy, it 
becomes essential to develop advanced finishing processes. Finishing the internal 
surface of cylindrical components is becoming a necessity due to increased applica‑
tions of such components in the aerospace and automobile industry, turbine nozzles, 
microchannels, bio‑implants, cooling channels, surgical tools, and hydraulic mani‑
folds. Owing to the difficulty in nano‑finishing internal and complex surfaces of 
cylindrical components, different available techniques are being modified, and new 
processes are also being developed.
Traditional finishing procedures (such as grinding, honing, and lapping) are inca‑
pable of finishing complex internal free‑form surfaces to a high degree of surface 
finish. To overcome this, various non‑conventional processes, viz. abrasive flow fin‑
ishing (AFF), magnetic abrasive finishing (MAF), and magnetorheological (MR) fin‑
ishing, are being explored. The present chapter reviews non‑conventional processes, 
their effectiveness in finishing and micro‑finishing of internal cylindrical surfaces 
advances, and hybridization of these processes along with current challenges associ‑
ated with them.

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
7.1.1  Need for the finishing of internal cylindrical surfaces
In today’s world, accurate super‑finish surfaces are in high demand for a variety of 
industrial components. Pleasant surface topography and reduced surface roughness 
are characteristics of excellent practical surfaces. Two of the fastest‑growing indus‑
tries that are using components with complicated interior surfaces are the aerospace 
and automobile industries for gas and fluid flow [2].
Several of the studied abrasive techniques focused on applications that have a sophis‑
ticated interior surface with curved characteristics, tiny sections, and variable volumes, 
such as turbine spray nozzles, hydraulic manifolds, and cooling channels [3, 4].
The interior cylindrical surfaces are finished using conventional methods, includ‑
ing honing and cylindrical grinding. Conventional finishing methods have been 
observed to present certain apprehensions, such as surface irregularities, excessive 
heat generation, microcracks formation, residual stress, lack of control over finish‑
ing forces, and limited adaptability to various workpiece materials [5]. The majority 
of die surfaces are characterized by free‑form surfaces that require a high degree 
of precision and polishing. Hence, the typical finishing method is inadequate for 
the demands of the die surface. Flexibility in finishing different‑shaped workpieces 
is only one of several difficulties that inspired the development of abrasive flow 
machining (AFM) and rotational abrasive flow finishing (R‑AFF).
The utilization of a magnetic abrasive within a magnetic field for the purpose 
of material removal has led to the emergence of a magnetic field‑assisted finishing 
methodology [6, 7] for creating highly finished surfaces. This method makes use of 
the adaptability of the abrasive chain arrangement to perform interior finishing of 
sections where traditional tools are scarcely appropriate, such as inside flexible pipes 
or complexly bent tubes [3, 8].
Magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (MRAFF) and rotational magneto‑
rheological abrasive flow finishing (R‑MRAFF) are used to smooth the inner cylin‑
der walls of a non‑ferromagnetic material through holes. Internal cylinder surfaces of 
ferromagnetic work material can be finished with a novel magnetorheological honing 
(MRH) method that employs electromagnets [9]. Electromagnets are employed to 
create the MRH process. MRH has also been used to improve the finishing perfor‑
mance of cylindrical shaped workpiece of varying diameter [2,5].
7.2  AFF of internal cylindrical surfaces
AFF comprises a slurry consisting of semi‑solid abrasive‑laden putty mixed into a 
viscoelastic medium to flow under pressure over a surface to be polished. These abra‑
sive particles are consistently suspended in a flexible polymer carrier. The carrier 
is a mixture of a rubber‑like polymer (polyborosiloxane, known as silly putty) and 
a lubricating gel [10]. AFF process can be categorized mainly into four categories 
based on the position and motion of cylinders.
	
a. 	One‑way AFF: In this sort of framework, the finishing medium is presented at 
the entrance of the workpiece by a medium chamber and gathered at the exit 
of the workpiece. The finishing medium is again gathered and reinserted for 
the next cycle, as shown in Figure 7.1.

119
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
	
b.	Two‑way AFF: In this kind of AFF, the finishing medium ceaselessly 
responds between two medium chambers and the workpiece is set in the 
middle of both medium chambers.
	
c.	Multi‑flow AFF: This framework is a broadened rendition of a two‑way 
AFF in which another arrangement of two‑way AFF is put close to it. The 
direction of motion of the two arrangements is kept opposite to each other. 
This setup can work semi‑ and fully automatically using a computer numer‑
ical control (CNC) for mass finishing operations [11].
	
d.	Orbital AFF: Orbital AFF involves moving the medium back and forth 
between two chambers to achieve final completion. An opposing displacer is 
used to move the workpiece. A higher‑quality surface finish can be achieved 
by providing the displacer with an extra, pre‑set motion that brings the abra‑
sive medium closer to the workpiece.
In orbital AFF the finishing medium moves to and fro between two medium cham‑
bers. A displacer is placed opposite to the workpiece. An additional predetermined 
motion is given to the displacer, which results in better contact between the abrasive 
medium and the workpiece, leading to a better surface finish.
7.2.1  Significance of AFF in finishing internal cylindrical surfaces
AFF uses a flexible yet controllable medium laden with abrasives as a finishing tool for 
finishing operations. This leads to its increased capability to reach and finish internal 
FIGURE 7.1  (a) One‑way AFF; (b) two‑way AFF; (c) multi‑flow AFF; (d) orbital AFF [11].

120
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
surfaces, and irregular complex contours. Owning to the ability of AFF to precisely 
finish complex, intricate geometry of the various internal surface, blind holes, deep 
cavities, thorough holes, etc., it finds its applicability in widespread domains. It has 
some unique applications, too, where no other customary and progressed finishing 
process can work. For example, small holes (diameter 3 mm and profundity 30 mm) 
can be effectively finished in large numbers simultaneously using this process, which 
is, in any case, extremely challenging. The best surface finishing accomplished by 
this process is 50 nm [12]. Given such benefits, AFF has been gaining in popularity 
in expansive applications, especially for accuracy part finishing and complex shape 
machining; for example, pressure‑driven control parts, turbine edges, motor parts, 
microchannels, nozzles, and so on. AFF can produce a surface finish up to 0.05 μm 
with close dimensional tolerance of ±5 μm within a short duration of time [13].
7.2.2  Parameters to be considered in AFF
The prominent process parameters in this technique include viscosity of the medium, 
the number of cycles of the abrasive medium over the workpiece, the concentration 
and size of the abrasives in the medium, pressure, and flow rate. As can be seen in 
Figure 7.2 these parameters influence the material removal rate (MRR) and the final 
surface roughness of the specimen. It has been observed that coarser grains lead to 
FIGURE 7.2  Parameters in the AFF process.

121
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
high MRR but at the expense of surface finish, whereas more refined grains result in 
better surface finish and low MRR [14]. Similarly, higher viscosity of the medium, 
increase in pressure, and increase in the number of cycles contribute towards higher 
MRR. Higher concentrations of abrasives consequently increase the number of active 
grains in the flowing medium, leading to a better surface finish and MRR [15].
7.2.3  Variants of AFF for finishing of internal cylindrical surfaces
7.2.3.1  Centrifugal abrasive flow finishing (CFAFF)
The setup includes inserting a spinning rod into the hollow cylinder as the work‑
piece rotates around it. As the media travels through the workpiece channel and the 
centrifugal force generator (CFG rod) spins, the abrasive particles are subject to a 
centrifugal force in the direction perpendicular to the axial force piston. As can be 
seen in Figure 7.3, the combined impact of these two forces improves the abrasive 
particles’ contact with the workpiece’s passage surface. Fewer process cycles are 
required to complete the workpiece in CFAAFM [16].
The effect of various process parameters has been studied, viz. extrusion pres‑
sure, the number of cycles, abrasives grain size, shape, and the rotational speed of 
CFG rod. It was concluded that (a) the CFG rod significantly increased the effec‑
tiveness of AFF by reducing machining time by 70%–80%. (b) Rectangular‑shaped 
rods produced the greatest improvement in surface finish, followed by square, 
spline, and triangular, whereas spline rods produced maximum material removal. 
Considering both surface finish and material removal, rectangular CFG gives the 
best result [17].
The CFG rod’s remarkable speed and high extrusion pressure are favourable condi‑
tions for increasing surface finish. Then again, a high velocity of the CFG rod, along 
with a bigger size of rough particles, contributes towards an upgraded MRR [18].

7.2.3.2  Rotational AFF (R‑AFF)
Rotational AFM has been developed and rotational AFF is similar to centrifugal 
abrasive flow finishing, with the only difference being in the motion of the work‑
piece. In this technique, the workpiece is situated in the explicitly planned work‑
piece holder and cinched between the chambers. The two fundamental elements of 
the workpiece holder are to cinch the workpiece and guarantee a controlled media 
stream in a shut framework. Inside the installation, the medium courses through a 
restricting channel prior to arriving at the workpiece’s irregularities. At first, the 
crushing medium is warmed to working temperature by the radiator/cooler. Then, 
at that point, the crushing medium is squeezed upwards into the workpiece holder 
along with the machined workpiece shapes. From that point onward, the cycle is 
rehashed the other way. Rotary motion is provided in the R‑AFF workpiece, and 
the medium oscillates. The combined effect of these two motions works together to 
improve surface quality while accelerating material removal [19]. As can be seen 
in Figure 7.4, the abrasive particles in the finishing medium are subjected to not 
only axial force (Fa) and radial force (Fr), but also tangential force (Ft) due to the 
workpiece’s rotation.
The combined effect of these two motions enhances surface finish while also 
increasing material removal [19]. Due to the rotational motion of the workpiece, 
the tangential force (Ft) also acts along with the axial force (Fa) and the radial 
force (Fr) over abrasive particles contained in the finishing medium, as shown in 
Figure 7.4.
The surface finish increased by 44% and 81.8% concerning the AFM process. 
Since the rotation process had a larger drill diameter, it increased the force applied 
by the medium’s flow and hence had greater Ra and MRR [20].
7.2.3.3  Drill bit‑guided AFF (DBG‑AFF)
Drill bit‑guided AFF has been developed and the drill bit changes the flow path of 
abrasive mediums, increasing the length of contact of abrasives with the workpiece. 
This, in turn, improves the rate of finish, material removal, and surface texture. It 
has been suggested that (a) the surface finish is directly proportional to the MRR and 
the drill bit’s radius. (b) The number of cycles is inversely proportional to the area 
FIGURE 7.4  Schematic of forces during R‑AFF [19].

123
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
of abrasives and the roughness of the surface. The drill bit helps in the reduction of 
peaks and thus improves the quality of finishing. In the drill bit the path travelled by 
the abrasive medium is longer than that in AFM [21].
The DBG‑AFF technique utilizes a twin slot fixture plate to aid in the align‑
ment of the drill bit within the finishing zone along with the assembly of all tool 
parts, namely: (1) workpiece, (2) drill bit, (3) fixture barrel, (4) twin slotted fixture 
plate, (5) lower taper fixture, (6) upper taper fixture, (7) lower medium cylinder, 
(8) upper medium cylinder. Upon entering the finishing zone, the cylindrical slug 
undergoes a division into two halves. Subsequently, upon exiting the zone, these two 
halves reunite and undergo a process of remixing. The extent of abrasive intermixing 
in DBG‑AFF is influenced by two factors: the deformability of the medium itself, 
similar to AFF, and the pressure exerted by the drill bit. Additionally, there are three 
distinct types of flows that take place in the finishing zone as well as the remixing of 
the medium upon exiting this zone. The presence of various flows results in a curved 
workpiece‑abrasive contact length, as opposed to a linear one. Consequently, the 
increased curvature leads to an augmented number of peaks that are susceptible to 
shearing as shown in Figure 7.5 [22].
7.2.3.4  Helical abrasive flow finishing (H‑AFF)
The AFF process was modified using a drill bit. This modified finishing process 
was termed as the helical abrasive flow finishing process (H‑AFF). A helical drill 
bit was placed co‑pivotally with the workpiece in this process [23]. The medium 
was forced to course through the annular space between the fixed helical drill bit 
and the workpiece so that more grating grains interface with the work surface. 
The workpiece used was a hollow cylinder made up of brass, and the abrasion 
process finished the internal surface of this cylindrical workpiece. AFM leaves

abrasives marks perpendicular to the surface; thus, complete removal of irregu‑
larities does not occur. As shown in Figure 7.6, on the contrary, H‑AFF abrasives 
make further scratches and follow a helical completing way along with the flute 
of the helical drilling tool, bringing about the total expulsion of the slopes and a 
­much‑completed surface.
It was also stated that the presence of a stationary drill bit and the number of 
cycles are significant process parameters for material removal upon Taguchi method 
analysis. It was concluded that the helical drill bit increases the MRR 2.5 times more 
than the basic AFF process.
7.2.3.5  Ultrasonic‑assisted AFF (UAAFF)
In this technique, the abrasive polymer medium is siphoned with a focal point of 
the ultrasonically invigorated device. A better finish has been observed when con‑
trasted with the straightforward AFM method. UAAFF was first introduced by Jones 
and Hull. They combined ultrasonic machining with AFM, which resulted in an 
improved surface finish by a factor of 10:1 [24].
A two‑way horizontal UAAFF on a hollow cylindrical workpiece EN8 steel 
was investigated. Abrasives come in contact with the workpiece when pushed from 
one cylinder to another. Meanwhile, the workpiece is treated with high vibrational 
frequency (5–20 kHz) in the direction perpendicular to the flowing medium, as in 
Figure 7.7. This results in an inclined collision of abrasive particles, thereby increas‑
ing impact force. It was concluded that material removal increments with the incre‑
ment in the applied frequency of vibration and extrusion pressure and an increment 
in surface finish up to 80.12% at an MRR of 7 kg/cm2 took place [25].

7.2.3.6  Hybrid of electrochemical machining (ECM) & AFM
Hybrid finishing processes are in trend, considering current manufacturing practices. 
They overcome challenges present in conventional finishing processes owning to the 
better surface finish of complex, intricate parts and a high MRR.
Experiments have been done upon the hybridization of ECM & AFM and were 
termed as electrochemical‑assisted AFM [26]. The anodic dissolution of the work‑
piece was caused by the application of polymeric electrolytes. Electrochemical 
impact and particle movement were both aided by the electrolytic grating medium. 
In addition to anodic breakdown, mechanical abrasion by abrasive particles also con‑
tributed to the material evacuation. Polymeric electrolytes were used, leading to the 
anodic dissolution of the workpiece. The created electrolytic grating media helped 
in both the electrochemical impact and the transportation of grating particles. The 
material evacuation occurred because of rough particles’ anodic disintegration and 
mechanical abrasion.
A process has been examined for incorporating ECM with AFM for the intricate 
finishing of the interior openings and depressions of the hollow cylindrical work‑
piece [27]. The process is shown in Figure 7.8.
By forcing a electrolyte‑rough laden medium across the gap between the cathode 
pole and the anode workpiece, the AFM activity component is completed. A yel‑
low metal hollow cylinder was employed as the workpiece. The required nylon fix‑
ture was created to enable electrolytic machining with the abrasive cutting activity. 
Silicon‑based polymer (polyborosiloxane) and hydrocarbon gel were combined with 
NaI salt (a weak alkali) and Al2O3 (as abrasives) to create the appropriate electro‑
lytic salt‑abrasive packed polymeric medium. Both electrolytic machining and abra‑
sion owing to the abrasive’s cutting action take place as the electrolytic salt‑abrasive 
packed medium flows through the annular gap between the fixed cathode rod and the 
workpiece under a DC voltage.
The AFM activity part is accomplished due to the to and fro expulsion of the 
­electrolyte‑rough loaded media through the hole between the cathode pole and the 
anode workpiece. The workpiece used was a hollow cylinder made up of yellow brass. 
The necessary nylon fixture was developed to achieve the electrolytic machining 
along with the abrasive cutting action. The suitable electrolytic salt‑abrasive‑laden 
FIGURE 7.7  Schematic of experimental setup of UAAFF [25].

126
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
polymeric media was used by adding NaI salt (a weak alkali) and Al2O3 (as abrasives) 
to a blend of a silicon‑based polymer (polyborosiloxane) and hydrocarbon gel. As the 
electrolytic salt‑abrasive‑laden medium passes through the annular space between 
the stationary cathode rod and the workpiece under a DC potential, electrolytic 
machining and abrasion occur due to the abrasive’s cutting action. It was concluded 
that based on Taguchi method parameters, viz. applied extrusion pressure, salt con‑
centration, voltage, electrode gap, the size of the abrasive significantly affected the 
MRR and surface finish. It was also stated that upon choosing the optimal material 
removal of 18.02 mg, there was a significant decrease in Ra value from 1.6 μm to a 
final of 0.84 μm. Thus, the method was influential in the internal surface finishing of 
cylindrical surfaces of brass as the workpiece material [27].
7.2.3.7  Magnetic abrasive flow finishing (MAFF)
MAFF was developed and a magnetic field was applied around the component under‑
going the AFF process. The results showed that as the magnetic field strength was 
increased, the rate of material removal and the quality of the surface it left behind 
both improved, and fewer cycles were needed to achieve the same level of removal. 
It was concluded that upon applying an increasing magnetic field, both MRR and 
surface finishes increased, and a relatively low number of cycles were required for 
removing the same amount of material [28].
Carbonyl iron particles (CIPs) and other ferromagnetic particles are sintered with 
abrasive particles to create a suspension used in abrasive magnetic flow finishing. 
To bring the CIP closer to the workpiece, a magnetic field is applied from outside 
the system. In the case of abrasive magnetic flow finishing ferromagnetic particles 
(such as CIPs) are sintered with abrasive particles, which are then suspended in the 
medium. An external magnetic field is then applied, which attracts the CIP towards 
the workpiece. This boosts the MRR by raising the normal force and the concentra‑
tion of active abrasive particles close to the surface of the workpiece [29]. Altering 
FIGURE 7.8  Hybrid of ECM & AFM [27].

127
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
the strength of the magnetic field has been shown to improve surface quality. 
Non‑ferromagnetic materials may be effectively finished with MAFF. To complete 
the inner surface of a double‑layered tube, Jiang Guo et al. introduced a new method 
of using rotating‑vibrating magnetic abrasive polishing. This increases the density 
of active abrasive particles in the vicinity near the workpiece’s surface, subsequently 
increasing the normal force and, henceforth, resulting in a better MRR [29].
The surface finish can be optimized by changing the magnitude of the mag‑
netic field applied. MAFF is effective in the case of finishing non‑ferromagnetic 
materials. Jiang Guo et al. presented a novel rotating‑vibrating magnetic abrasive 
polishing method to finish a complex internal surface with a double‑layered tube 
structure. As can be seen in Figure 7.9, a modified lathe setup was used where the 
workpiece was mounted to the chuck. Magnets were mounted on a pneumatic pis‑
ton vibrator using a fixture. A finished surface with a roughness value of 0.21 μm 
(Ra) was obtained [30].
A crossover arrangement of an electro‑chemo‑magneto abrasive flow machine 
was used. It expanded the productivity of the customary AFM arrangement by utiliz‑
ing the attractive electrolytic arrangement in the manufacture [31].
Experiments have been conducted on an inner magnetic abrasive finishing 
(IMAF) process for non‑ferromagnetic complex moulded cylinders. In this cycle, 
an outer attractive magnetic field was applied, which permitted flexible magnetic 
FIGURE 7.9  Magnetic abrasive flow finishing (MAFF) [30].

abrasive brush (FMAB) development inside the cylinder. When the magnetic source 
is pivoted, a FMAB also starts turning, resulting in the finishing process [32].
7.2.4  Challenges associated with the AFF process 
for internal cylindrical surfaces
•	 Basic AFF is a time‑consuming process due to the low MRR.
•	 The MAFF process gives noticeable results only for non‑ferromagnetic 
materials.
•	 Complex fixtures and arrangements are needed for the hybrid process, like 
CAAFF, R‑AFF, DBAFF.
•	 The finishing region is uncertain about the active abrasive region.
•	 The viscosity of the medium used in AFF is challenging to monitor.
7.3  MAF OF INTERNAL CYLINDRICAL SURFACES
The present methodology entails the complete amalgamation of ferromagnetic parti‑
cles with tiny abrasive particles, namely, Al2O3, SiC, CBN, or diamond. Collectively, 
these entities are denoted as either magnetic or ferromagnetic abrasive particles. A 
magnetic field is then applied, which attracts ferromagnetic particles close to the sur‑
face. As a result, the normal component of magnetic force provides better penetration 
of abrasives inside the workpiece [33]. Henceforth, MAF can produce components 
with low roughness value.
7.3.1  Significance of MAF in finishing internal cylindrical surfaces
MAF is a contemporary finishing technique that utilizes a magnetic field to primar‑
ily regulate the cutting force during the machining process. This methodology can be 
effectively employed to produce superior surface smoothness on planar surfaces as 
well as the inner and outer surfaces of cylindrical workpieces, achieving a finish of a 
few nanometres. The utilization of magnetic force is a crucial aspect in the creation of 
FMABs and the advancement of abrasion pressure within the MAF procedure [34].
The technology has the capability to produce non‑ferromagnetic materials such 
as stainless steel and brass, as well as ferromagnetic materials like steel. MAF pos‑
sesses various attractive characteristics including self‑sharpening, self‑adaptability, 
and controllability. Additionally, the finishing tool does not necessitate compensation 
or dressing. This methodology can be employed across diverse sectors. Empirical evi‑
dence has demonstrated that the MAF technique yields superior surface finishes with 
negligible material elimination and exceptional dimensional precision. Additionally, 
the process is environmentally friendly and can reduce production time and costs.
The self‑sharpening feature of the finishing tool ensures consistent performance 
throughout the entire finishing process. The self‑adaptability feature allows for 
adjustments to be made in real time to ensure optimal results. Controllability allows 
for precise control over the finishing process, resulting in a high degree of repeat‑
ability. The aforementioned technique can be employed for achieving a surface

Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
finish with a roughness of nano levels. This method is particularly suitable for deli‑
cate, lightweight, and extremely corrosion‑resistant components that are utilized in 
advanced industries such as automotive, aerospace, medical, and electronics [35, 36]. 
The utilization of a programmable magnetic field to propel chains of ferromagnetic 
particles containing abrasive particles that are confined within and between them, in 
order to conform to the surface of the workpiece to be finished, is a crucial compo‑
nent of this technique. The inherent characteristics of the brush facilitate its ability to 
access areas that are impervious to conventional tools, such as the interior of curved 
tubes and pipes [37].
MAF employs a homogenous mechanical combination of abrasive SiC and ferro‑
magnetic iron particles. The pliability of the brush composed of magnetized abrasive 
particles or a blend of magnetizable particles and abrasive particles is modulated in 
response to the contours of the workpiece that requires refinement or burnishing. The 
pliant brush, which exhibits a degree of rigidity as a result of the impact of the mag‑
netic field, applies finishing forces to the surface of the workpiece which wear away 
the surface, leaving microscopic indentations. As a result, the substance is removed 
from the brush as it rotates [38].
Micro grinding is a phenomenon that occurs when a workpiece and a flexible 
brush are subjected to finishing forces and relative motion is provided. This results in 
the removal of surface material in the form of microscopic chips. At times, the car‑
rier fluid that is blended with the magnetic abrasives possesses electrolytic proper‑
ties, and this is a deliberate measure to facilitate electrochemical reactions within the 
operational clearance. In such instances, in addition to abrasive wear, electrochemi‑
cal wear occurs and adds to the overall material removal [39]. The process of barrel 
finishing employs the MAF technique, which utilizes permanent magnets to gener‑
ate a magnetic field. Additionally, it has the potential to be introduced within the 
aperture of a tube or pipe to refine the inner surface of a non‑magnetic stainless‑steel 
cylinder [40, 41].
7.3.2  Parameters to be considered in MAF
There are two types of MAF process parameters: (i) input process parameters, which 
include things like magnetic flux density, working gap, abrasive grain type, abrasive 
particle size, abrasive grain relative permeability, free space relative permeability, 
pole rotation speed, and power input to the pole, and (ii) output process parameters, 
which include things like finished product size and quality (e.g., surface roughness, 
weight removal, and accuracy). As can be seen in Figure 7.10, the MAF process 
is heavily influenced by the abrasive magnetic type, abrasive particles, magnetic 
device, workpiece material, operating gap, grinding fluid, rotation speed, and axial 
vibration [42].
Magnetic flux density, working gap, abrasive grain type, abrasive particle size, 
abrasive grain relative permeability, free space relative permeability, pole rotation 
speed, and power input to the pole are all significant input elements that exert a con‑
siderable impact on the MAF process. The effectiveness of MAF on a flat surface, an 
inner surface, and a spherical surface is assessed through the use of surface rough‑
ness and removal weight as evaluation parameters.

7.3.3  Variants of MAF for finishing of internal cylindrical surfaces
7.3.3.1  MAF with rotational pole system
This study investigates the behaviour of an inner surface finishing in a 
­non‑ferromagnetic material utilizing a pole rotation mechanism. The workpiece’s 
internal surface undergoes abrasion through the application of magnetic abrasive 
particles (MAPs) that are introduced into the workpiece and subsequently drawn 
towards the magnetic field [43]. The magnetic field at the finishing zone is rotated by 
the spinning of the small permanent magnet poles around the workpiece. The delete‑
rious effects of the rough behaviour exhibited by the inner surface of the tube have 
a notable impact on the finishing characteristics. This behaviour can be categorized 
into four distinct stages, as visually depicted in Figure 7.11(a). The described phe‑
nomenon involves the confinement of all abrasive particles through magnetic means 
within the finishing area, allowing for their seamless rotation along the inner surface 
in response to the movement of the magnetic field. This facilitates the enhancement 
of surface roughness.
Figure 7.11(b) illustrates the rotational movement of the abrasive specimens against 
the inner surface, while simultaneously experiencing self‑displacement within the 
FIGURE 7.10  Schematic diagram of MAF’s input and output process parameters.

131
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
abrasive mass. The phenomenon known as “self‑displacement” pertains to a state 
wherein the abrasive particles relocate within the abrasive matrix. The self‑­displacement 
of the abrasive’s cutting edges may lead to an increase in material removal. The 
observed behaviour depicted in Figure 7.11(c) is attributed to a decrease in the magnetic 
attraction exerted on the abrasive material. Under these conditions, the magnetic field 
exhibits a limited capacity to retain a fraction of the abrasive mass within the finishing 
zone. The distribution of the abrasive material occurs in a random manner, causing it to 
impact the surface area and subsequently induce cutting action [43].
7.3.3.2  Ultrasonic vibration‑assisted MAF process
The illustration presented in Figure 7.12 showcases the ultrasonic‑assisted magnetic 
abrasive finishing (UAMAF) technique, which is a hybrid finishing process that uti‑
lizes ultrasonic vibrations within the finishing zone of a MAF process to achieve 
improved surface topology within a reasonable timeframe. Empirical evidence indi‑
cates that UAMAF yields superior results compared to MAF when utilizing identical 
finishing parameters [44]. The UAMAF configuration is depicted in both a schematic 
and an experimental system in Figures 7.12(a) and 7.12(b), respectively. The experi‑
mental setup consisted of a specially designed workpiece fixture and an ultrasonic 
vibration generator. The arrangement of the four poles of the electromagnet followed 
a north‑south orientation, resulting in the generation of magnetic fields that were 
concentric in nature.
A comparative analysis has been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of MAF and 
UAMAF in the context of internal surface finishing of hollow ceramic pipes, as 
shown in Figure 7.12(c) The study presents a comparative assessment of the surface 
FIGURE 7.11  Two‑dimensional schematic of abrasive behaviour during the process [43].

FIGURE 7.12  (a) Schematic diagram of UAMAF process. (b) Actual experimental setup 
of UAMAF process and (c) comparative analysis of surface roughness and material removed

133
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
roughness and material removal capabilities of both processes [45]. The inferiority 
of MAF in terms of surface roughness and material removal compared to UAMAF is 
evident. Upon completion of a 50‑minute process, the surface roughness of the mate‑
rial known as MAF exhibited a decrease from 1.1 to 0.55 μm, while the amount of 
material removed was 295 mg. The UAMAF exhibits a decrease in surface roughness 
from 1.12 to 0.03 μm, accompanied by a material removal of 485 mg. The UAMAF 
serves to augment the frictional forces between the MAPs and the workpiece, thereby 
facilitating an increase in the kinetic energy of the MAPs. Consequently, the process 
of material removal experiences a significant enhancement. Conversely, the applica‑
tion of high‑frequency vibration yields a positive impact on trajectory interference 
by reducing the size of non‑removal traces, resulting in a smoother trajectory and a 
noticeable enhancement in surface quality [45].
7.3.3.3  MAF with a multiple pole tip system
A proposed MAF process utilizing a multiple pole tip system has the magnetic attri‑
butes of a metastable austenitic stainless‑steel tool and can be modified through the 
process of heat treatment. By subjecting the tool to multiple partial heat treatments, it 
is possible to create alternating regions with magnetic and non‑magnetic properties. 
The utilization of this tool within a capillary tube, in conjunction with the magnetic 
abrasive, results in the creation of numerous finishing regions. This occurs due to the 
magnetic attraction that occurs between the magnetized and not magnetized regions 
on the tool, which are present at the border. The passage of the magnetic abrasive 
deep into the tube is facilitated, allowing for the simultaneous finishing of multiple 
regions [32]. As shown in Figures 7.13(a) and 7.13(b) the proposed approach involves 
the utilization of a multiple pole tip system.
This study involves the incorporation of a pair of pole tips into a single pole tip 
system, which is then interrelated to produce magnetic fields within two distinct 
finishing areas. The finishing area is expanded by incorporating a magnetic abrasive 
into two specific regions of the tube, which exerts pressure against the inner surface 
of the tube. Similar to the single pole tip system, the rotation of the tube facilitates 
the movement of the magnetic abrasive in relation to the inner surface of the tube, 
which leads to a highly effective surface finishing process [32].
In practical applications, it has been shown that certain mixed‑type magnetic abra‑
sives tend to cling to the surface of a tube. This adhesion occurs due to the friction 
between the mixed‑type magnetic abrasive and the tube surface, which surpasses the 
magnetic force that would otherwise induce the mixed‑type magnetic abrasive to follow 
the rotation of the pole tip. As depicted in Figure 7.13(b), the area corresponding to the 
chuck‑end edge of the pole tip should possess a minimal quantity of magnetic abrasive.
Consequently, it can be observed that an increase in the depth of the finishing 
region within the tube leads to a corresponding increase in surface roughness. This 
can be attributed to the insufficient presence of magnetic abrasive in the finishing 
process. Consequently, the initial penetration of MAPs into the tube and the ability 
to supply a mixture of different types of MAPs are crucial factors in achieving the 
desired outcome in terms of finishing performance. The design of the alternating 
magnetic property and the spacing between the magnetic and non‑magnetic zones 
must be carefully considered to address these concerns.

7.3.3.4  Finishing internal circular tubes using 
magnetic abrasive jet machining
The proposed method involves the utilization of a precise internal finishing tech‑
nique that employs a working fluid combined with magnetic abrasives. This mixture 
is then directed into the internal surface of the tube, while magnetic poles are posi‑
tioned on the exterior surface of the tube. This study aimed to develop a novel finish‑
ing technique known as the magnetic abrasive jet machining system [46].
Figure 7.14 depicts a schematic representation of the magnetic abrasive jet machin‑
ing system (MAMS), which comprises several components including a fluid supply 
system, a nozzle, electromagnet parts, a power source capable of delivering a voltage 
range of 0 to 100 V with a maximum current of 5 amp. a mixing chamber, discharge 
parts, and an abrasive tank. The working fluid in this system is compressed air, with a 
maximum pressure of 4–5 atm. The flow rate of the compressed air is regulated by a 
valve, with a maximum flow rate of 250 ml min−1. The automatic supply of magnetic 
abrasive is facilitated through the utilization of jet fluid. Consequently, the magnetic 
abrasive and the working fluid are combined. A heterogeneous fluid is injected into 
the interior of the workpiece by a nozzle, afterwards flowing into the discharge pipe 
at a low pressure and velocity. The abrasive that has been expelled from the tank is 
subsequently recycled by an abrasive feed pipe [46].
Figure  7.15 depicts the comprehensive schematic diagram of the machining 
principle. The system is capable of completing the task exclusively through the jet 
process, as depicted in Figure 7.15(a) However, Figure 7.15(b) illustrates a modifica‑
tion to the machining principle by incorporating electromagnets into the jet pro‑
cess. Electromagnets are incorporated to enhance the machining force and improve 
the distribution of magnetic abrasive on the internal surface, thereby enabling more 
efficient precision finishing. The primary method employed for basic machining is 
the jet process, wherein the electromagnets play a crucial role in enhancing the effi‑
ciency of the machining process [46].
7.3.3.5  Chemical‑assisted magnetic abrasive finishing (CMAF) process
The utilization of titanium alloys, tungsten, and other composites has become 
prevalent in contemporary industry due to their superior strength, hardness, wear

setup of multiple pole tip system [32].

resistance, and toughness in comparison to conventional materials. Yet, due to these 
features, they are difficult to comprehend. MAF and chemical mechanical polish‑
ing (CMP) are alternative techniques that can be employed for the finishing of these 
materials, albeit with a lower level of productivity. MAF is a material removal tech‑
nique that utilizes MAPs and a magnetic field to eliminate microchips from a work‑
piece [47, 48]. MAF and CMP are both widely used because they provide a variety of 
benefits. Their low efficiency and MRR are disadvantages, especially when working

process that improves efficiency without sacrificing surface quality.
Figure 7.16 depicts the CMAF process for simultaneous interior and exterior sur‑
face finishing. The workpiece (tube) is first chemically treated with an appropriate 
etchant. On the work surface, an appropriate etchant is applied and held at a particu‑
lar high temperature for a set period of time. By reacting chemically with the work 
surface, the etchant softens the surface’s molecular layer, allowing for its removal via 
an MAF technique [49].

abrasive particles that are present internally as well as externally. The formation of 
an FMAB occurs through the attraction of ferromagnetic abrasive particles to the 
magnetic field. The magnetic force Fi generated within the tube draws the MAPs 
inwards. Magnetic particles are coaxed outwards by an extraterrestrial force known 
as Fe, which is created outside the tube [49]. Figure 7.16(b) depicts the experimental 
setup used to finish both the interior and outside surfaces of Inconel 625 tubes at the 
same time.
To simultaneously clean the internal and external surfaces, a native magnetic tool 
has been developed. Figure 7.16(b) illustrates how it is made up of two permanent 
neodymium iron boron (NdFeB) magnets mounted on an aluminium frame, each 
measuring 35 × 35 × 25 mm. Both magnets’ upper pole profiles are perfectly aligned 
with the tube’s exterior surface. The magnet poles are covered with nonwoven fabric 
coated with PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) tape. An experimental setup involves 
the attachment of a magnetic tool onto the tool post of a multispeed precision lathe.
7.3.3.6  MAF with a stationary pole system
A novel method of internal MAF has been developed to achieve superior surface 
finishing of workpieces employed in crucial applications such as semiconductor 
manufacturing facilities. The methodology employed utilizes an uninterrupted mag‑
netic field to administer a finishing force to magnetic abrasives. Workpieces with 
rotation‑symmetrical shapes and tiny dimensions, such as straight tubes, gas bombs, 
reducers, and so on, are rotated at high speeds using a stationary pole system [50].
Figure 7.17 depicts the concept of an internal MAF process utilizing a stationary 
pole system. The magnetic field is responsible for consolidating the magnetic abra‑
sive that is introduced into the tube at the finishing zone, thereby exerting the finish‑
ing force on the inner surface of the tube [50]. In practice, electromagnetic coils or 
permanent magnets can be used to generate magnetic fields [50, 52]. When the tube 
FIGURE 7.17  Schematic internal MAF process using stationary pole system [51].

rotates fast, the material removed by the inner surface of the tube is smoothed by the 
relative motion between the magnetic abrasive and the inner wall of the tube.
7.3.4  Challenges associated with the MAF process 
for internal cylindrical surfaces
Despite the potential advantages of MAF procedures, there exist several limitations:
•	 Geometries like a workpiece’s wrinkled surface are still difficult to finish 
effectively with the MAF technique [53].
•	 As a result of its ineffectiveness on tough and rigid materials, MAF has a 
low MRR [54].
•	 The MAF technology was devised for the purpose of expediting the process 
of interior finishing and cleansing of pliable capillary tubes. The efficacy of 
non‑conventional techniques in eliminating burrs from the interior surface 
of a tube diminishes with a reduction in its diameter [40].
•	 The research conducted on the impact of rotational motion on the MRR of 
a flat workpiece has revealed that a low MRR is a significant constraint in 
almost all of these procedures [41].
•	 MAF media has the ability to impregnate the workpiece’s surface [41].
•	 The interiors of flexible capillary tubes were expeditiously completed and 
cleaned through the utilization of MAF. As the pipe diameter decreases, it 
becomes more and more challenging to remove burrs completely from the 
inner surface using unconventional techniques.
•	 By applying three‑phase AC current to three coil sets at 120 degree inter‑
vals in three different directions, a revolving magnetic field can be pro‑
duced, which is ideal for interior surface finishing of cylinder‑shaped 
workpieces. The present study involved conducting experiments on mild 
steel, hardened steel, and brass specimens utilizing MAPs. These particles 
were produced by amalgamating Al2O3 and iron particles, and a straight oil 
type grinding fluid was employed for the purpose. After conducting tests, 
it was discovered that utilizing a revolving magnetic field increases stock 
removal but lowers surface quality when compared to using a static mag‑
netic field. The magnetic field intensity of non‑ferromagnetic substances is 
relatively low due to the absence of magnetization in the constituent compo‑
nents. Consequently, the process of stock removal is significantly restricted, 
and the recommended equipment is not suitable for materials that are non‑­
ferromagnetic, as mentioned [55].
7.4  MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL FINISHING (MRF)
Magnetorheological polishing fluid (MRPF)‑assisted finishing techniques represent 
a category of finishing procedures that provide enhanced process control, enabling 
the attainment of fine tolerances and preservation of surface topography integrity. 
The utilization of magnetorheological polishing fluid MRPF has been observed in 
various contemporary magnetorheologicalpolishing fluid MRPF‑assisted finishing 

139
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
techniques, wherein it serves the purpose of externally controlling the finishing 
forces exerted on abrasive particles [56]. Several MR finishing techniques include 
MRH, rotational magnetorheological honing (R‑MRH), MRAFF, and R‑MRAFF.
The utilization of MR fluid‑based finishing (MRFF) involves the application of a 
liquid carrier that contains a combination of magnetic particles and abrasive particles 
within its composition, commonly referred to as MR fluid. Chemicals and surfac‑
tants, commonly referred to as additives, are employed to prolong the lifespan of the 
MR fluid and enhance the rate of particle elimination [57]. MRF is a high‑precision 
methodology that can attain surface precision of a 30‑nm peak to valley and micro 
roughness of less than 10 Å. The utilization of MRPF is applicable to a diverse array 
of materials, encompassing optical glasses, hard crystals, and various metallic sur‑
faces, as indicated by source [58].
7.4.1  Significance of MR finishing in finishing 
of internal cylindrical surfaces
Magnetic‑assisted finishing techniques, such as MAF, are being developed to provide a 
high level of workpiece surface finishing with regulated finishing pressures. Using mag‑
netorheological polishing fluid (MRPF), magnetic‑assisted finishing procedures are able 
to complete a broad variety of workpiece forms at the nano‑scale level while maintain‑
ing high surface integrity and eliminating defects including microcracks, heat‑affected 
zones, and residual stress. An illustration of this type of finishing process is magneto‑
rheological finishing (MRF). MR polishing fluids are utilized for these processes; they 
are a smart and magnetically regulated blend of abrasive particles and ferromagnetic 
particles and are mixed with the base fluid which is a grease and oil mixture [57].
Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is an exemplar of this category of finishing 
techniques. The aforementioned processes employ MR polishing fluids, which con‑
sist of a sophisticated combination of abrasive and ferromagnetic particles, blended 
with a base fluid comprising a mixture of grease and oil [59]. Upon exposure to 
a magnetic field, ferromagnetic iron particles undergo magnetization and exhibit a 
chain‑like morphology at the microscopic level. The abrasive particles, which are 
confined within the chains of magnetic iron particles, offer ample support as evi‑
denced by previous studies [53, 54].
MRAFF and R‑MRAFF are employed for the purpose of refining the internal 
cylindrical surfaces of through holes that are predominantly composed of non‑­
ferromagnetic substances [57].
7.4.2  Parameters to be considered in MRF
The MRF technique is a finishing process that relies on fluid‑based mechanisms. The 
process parameters are predominantly determined by the components and concen‑
trations of the MR fluid. Figure 7.18 displays several crucial parameters of the MRF 
procedure. In order to achieve optimal performance from the MRF process, which 
is a challenging task, it is imperative to exercise stringent control over the process 
parameters. The selection of process parameters and their values is influenced by the 
composition, hardness, and initial surface roughness of the workpiece to be processed.

140
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
In comparison to other process factors, the magnetic field and the size and con‑
centration of CIPs have a more significant influence on the MRF process, as the 
absence of either of these two factors results in the inability of the MRPF to function 
[57]. In order to achieve the desired surface roughness and MRR, it is imperative to 
select the optimal level of said parameters.
The MR fluid’s exceedingly high yield stress renders it inappropriate for the 
finishing of delicate glass or silicon‑based materials, owing to its forceful interac‑
tion with the workpiece, leading to the occurrence of significant micro and nano 
scratches. Therefore, it is desirable to have a moderate yield stress in order to 
achieve the ultimate low Ra and high MRR. The selection of a process parameter is 
a critical decision, with the type of workpiece material (e.g., metal, optics such as 
glass or lenses, ceramic, etc.) and the initial surface roughness being the primary 
factors to consider. When dealing with optics, a material that is characterized by its 
softness and relatively smooth surface, it is imperative that the composition of the 
MR fluid used does not cause excessive abrasion to the surface of the workpiece, 
as mentioned [57].
7.4.3  Variants of MRF for finishing of internal cylindrical surfaces
7.4.3.1  Magnetorheological honing
The inner surfaces of cylinders made of ferromagnetic and non‑ferromagnetic mate‑
rials may now be finished to a high standard using novel MR fluid‑based finish‑
ing processes [60, 61]. The suggested MRH method nano‑finishes the inner surface 
of cylinders of varying diameters using four flat permanent magnet strips. Further 
improvements to the recently existing MRH method have been made in this study to 
improve its finishing performance [61].
FIGURE 7.18  Input and output process parameters to be considered in MRF.

141
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
The models represent two identically sized MRH tools (one with flat permanent 
magnet strips and the other with curved permanent magnet strips). Both MRH tools 
include four permanent magnet strips along the outside edge of the finishing tool. 
Models of the MRH process utilizing flat and curved magnet strips are shown in 
Figures 7.19(a) and 7.19(b). The four magnetic strips form a right angle with respect 
to the finishing tools’ central axis [62].
The models depict two MRH tools of equal dimensions, one equipped with flat 
permanent magnet strips and the other one with arched permanent magnet strips. 
The finishing tool of both MRH tools is equipped with four permanent magnet strips 
positioned along its outer edge. Figures 7.19(a) and 7.19(b) depict the various models 
of the MRH process that employ flat and curve‑shaped magnet strips [62]. The orien‑
tation of the four magnetic strips is perpendicular to the central axis of the finishing 
tools.
FIGURE 7.19 a  Magnetic models of MRH tool and magnetic flux density in the MR polish‑
ing fluid area from the (a) flat and (b) end surface of a permanent magnet strip to the inner 
surface of a cylindrical ferromagnetic workpiece [62].

142
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
The functional behaviour of a tool utilized for finishing the inner surface of a cyl‑
inder may vary depending on whether its magnetic core end surface is flat or curved. 
The reason behind this phenomenon is attributed to variations in the magnetic flux 
density across the surface of the finishing tool [62]. The MR polishing fluid achieves 
uniformity in bonding force upon finishing the surface of the tool in the working gap, 
resulting in uniformly distributed magnetic flux density over the finishing tool sur‑
face. This process is essential for completing the inner surface of a hollow cylinder‑­
shaped workpiece.
7.4.3.2  Magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing
Magnetorheological (MR) fluid, comprising magnetic CIPs, non‑ MAPs, water or 
oil, and diverse additives, was developed for the purpose of MRAFF [63, 64]. The 
magnetic field used keeps abrasive particles together in a vast network of CIPs. 
FIGURE 7.19 b  Magnetic models of MRH tool and magnetic flux density in the MR polish‑
ing fluid area from the (a) flat and (b) end surface of a permanent magnet strip to the inner 
surface of a cylindrical ferromagnetic workpiece [62].

143
Advanced finishing processes for internal cylindrical surfaces
As a result, the cutting motion is enhanced, producing greater MRR and surface 
quality.
The MRAFF technique entails the iterative extrusion of a magnetically stiffened 
slug of MRPF through the channel that is created by the workpiece and fixture [63]. 
The application of a magnetic field onto a workpiece results in selective abrasion 
of only the area that is exposed to the magnetic field, while the remaining surface 
remains unaffected.
The process mechanism is depicted in Figures 7.20(a) and 7.20(b). The develop‑
ment of a refined finishing apparatus has the potential to enhance the utilitarian prop‑
erties of said ferromagnetic cylindrical constituents through increased regulation. A 
correlation has been observed between the decrease in surface roughness values and 
a reduction in wear and energy consumption exhibited by the mating components 
[61]. In contrast to conventional finishing tools, this tool has the potential to enhance 
the longevity and upkeep of said components.
In order to solve the difficulties associated with the thorough finishing of ferro‑
magnetic workpiece surfaces, a technique based on MR fluids has been developed. 
The finishing tool and electromagnet in this method were contained within the cyl‑
inder of the ferromagnetic workpiece. This method involved housing both the elec‑
tromagnet and the finishing tool within the cylinder of the ferromagnetic material.
The magnitude of the material removed from the crests of the workpiece’s sur‑
face by abrasive grains is ascertained by the bonding potency conferred by the 
field‑induced configuration of the MR polishing fluid and the extrusion pressure 
FIGURE 7.20  Schematic of MR fluid‑based finishing tool during finishing of the internal 
ferromagnetic (a) cylindrical work piece and (b) blind hole workpiece [61].

144
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
dispensed through the piston. The regulation of peak abrasion can be achieved by 
adjusting the magnetic field strength [65].
7.4.3.3  Rotational magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing
The R‑MRAFF method is a distinctive finishing technique that has been suggested 
to improve the finishing capabilities of the MRAFF process. The process of polish‑
ing involves utilizing a magnetic field and hydraulic unit to apply a circular and 
reciprocating motion to the medium. This is depicted in Figures 7.21(a) and 7.21(b). 
The efficacy of the process was validated through the polishing of stainless steel and 
brass plates [66].
The R‑MRAFF technique employs a hydraulic system to operate two opposing pis‑
tons within the medium cylinders, thereby facilitating the extrusion of magnetorheo‑
logical polishing (MRP) medium onto the surface of the workpiece, and creating a 
vertical motion along the tube axis. Figure 7.22, depicts the simultaneous rotation of 
permanent magnets (NdFeB) that surround the workpiece fixture and the polishing 
media (magnetic in nature). When controlled precisely, these two motions may provide 
a surface finish that is uniformly smooth and mirror‑like over the whole range [67].
Forces are exerted on a particle of abrasive material by the R‑MRAFF procedure. 
The magnetic force Fm acting on a CIP in a magnetic field causes the abrasives con‑
tained by the CIPs to be forced onto the surface of workpiece [66].

The equation for the magnetic force acting on a CIP is expressed in Eq. (7.1) where

magnetic field intensity, ∇H represents the gradient of the magnetic field intensity, 
and μ0 denotes the permeability in free space.

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
7.3.3.4  Rotational magnetorheological honing
The current MRH technique may be made even more efficient. To speed up the comple‑
tion time of conventional MRH, R‑MRH was developed. As depicted in Figure 7.23, the  
R‑MRH technique involves the concurrent rotation of the cylinder and the MRH tool, 
with the former rotating at a synchronous velocity but in an opposing direction to the 
latter. An additional shear force can be produced by the active abrasives due to the 
increased relative speed when the cylindrical workpiece is rotated in the opposite direc‑
tion of the MRH tool. This methodology results in superior surface finishing within a 
shorter duration compared to the conventional MRH approach [68].
Figure  7.24 illustrates the mechanism of R‑MRH for surface finishing which 
describes that the end surface of the MRH tool generates a magnetic field (Fm) that 
normalizes the surface of the inner cylinder through the use of confined active abra‑
sives containing a chain structure of CIPs. When utilizing an active abrasive particle 
for the purpose of polishing a workpiece, it applies a magnetic force onto the surface 
FIGURE  7.24  Schematic representation of the finishing mechanism in the R‑MRH  
process [68].

CIPs have different magnetic susceptibilities depending on their position due to the 
magnetization of the materials and the magnetic field created there [65].
7.4.4  Challenges associated with the MRF process 
for internal cylindrical surfaces
•	 The MRP fluid used in MR procedures is more expensive since it must be 
conditioned on a regular basis. As a result, the entire lead time increases.
•	 Because the MR process is a complicated interplay of electromagnetic coils, 
MR polishing fluid, and workpiece material characteristics and form, it’s 
impossible to anticipate how newer materials will respond.
•	 Due to the high current flow, an electromagnetic coil utilized in the MR 
process heats up. It causes a loss in efficiency, a rise in coil resistance, and a 
change in the characteristics of the MR fluid.
7.5  CONCLUSION
•	 AFF is classified as a non‑conventional finishing method that involves the 
utilization of a semi‑solid medium composed of a visco‑elastic polymer and 
abrasive particles, which are combined in a predetermined ratio. The media 
undergoes extrusion under pressure, either through or across its surface, in 
order to achieve the desired finish.
•	 The MAF process is efficacious in enhancing the surface accuracy and 
dimensional precision of diverse workpiece geometries such as internal fin‑
ishing of hollow cylindrical workpiece, capillary tubes, and concave‑shaped 
surfaces. The MAF technique has the capability to be employed with both 
bonded and unbonded variants of magnetic abrasives. The utilization of 
unbounded magnetic abrasives in MAF has been found to result in increased 
MRR, but the use of bonded magnetic abrasives has been observed to offer 
superior surface quality.
•	 For nano‑finishing operation of internal surface of cylindrical components 
using MR finishing processes very few experimental setups have been 
designed and fabricated till now for very shorter length of the cylindrical 
components using different variants of the MR finishing process. There is a 
lot of scope for the design and fabrication of MR finishing setups for longer 
length of cylindrical components which have applications in manufactur‑
ing and automotive industries such as injection barrels, cylindrical moulds, 
hydraulic piston actuators.

148
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
•	 If the normal force requirement changes during a MR finishing process 
that uses a magnetic tool based on a permanent magnet, the magnetic tool 
must be replaced with a permanent magnet of an appropriate strength. The 
electromagnet‑based MRH technique is useful for a number of applications 
where MRAFF or R‑MRAFF would fail, including the finishing of the inte‑
rior surface of cylindrical workpiece made up of ferromagnetic materials.

8 Post‑processing 
methods for surface 
enhancement of additively 
manufactured parts
Atul Singh Rajput, Manas Das, and Sajan Kapil
8.1  INTRODUCTION
Additive manufacturing (AM) has been rapidly evolving in the last few decades and 
has become an important tool for manufacturing complex parts with high accuracy 
and precision [1]. This technology involves the layer‑by‑layer addition of materials, 
such as polymers, metals, ceramics, and composites, to create three‑dimensional 
objects from digital models, as shown in Figure 8.1. However, the surfaces of addi‑
tively manufactured parts often exhibit roughness, porosity, and other defects that 
can adversely affect their functional performance [2]. Post‑processing techniques 
have been developed to overcome these limitations, reduce surface roughness, and 
improve functional performance. They can be broadly classified into chemical, elec‑
trochemical, mechanical, and thermal methods, depending on the nature of the sur‑
face modification [3]. These techniques can be used individually or in combination to 
achieve the desired surface finish and functional properties. Chemical post‑­processing 
techniques involve using chemical solutions to dissolve or etch the surface layer of 
the part to remove roughness, burrs, and other defects. Electrochemical methods use 
an electrolyte solution and an electrical current to remove material from the surface 
of the part, resulting in a smoother finish. Furthermore, mechanical post‑­processing 
techniques include grinding, polishing, and sandblasting, which use mechanical 
force to remove surface defects and create a smoother finish. However, thermal post‑­
processing techniques involve using heat to modify the surface properties of the part, 
such as through laser or electron beam irradiation. Each post‑processing technique 
has its advantages and limitations. Chemical methods are easy to use and effective in 
removing surface defects, but they may result in a loss of material and changes in sur‑
face properties [4]. Electrochemical methods offer precise control over the surface 
finish and can be used to selectively remove material, but they require specialized 
equipment and expertise [5]. Mechanical methods are widely used and effective but 
can be time‑consuming and require skilled labor [6]. Thermal methods offer unique 
advantages, such as the ability to modify the surface properties without affecting the

Post-processing methods for surface enhancement
bulk properties, but they require specialized equipment and expertise [7]. In recent 
years, there has been significant research on post‑processing techniques for reducing 
surface roughness and improving the functional performance of 3D printed parts. 
This chapter will provide an overview of these techniques, their principles, materials, 
techniques, advantages, and limitations. Furthermore, it will survey the recent litera‑
ture on these techniques and highlight their effectiveness in enhancing the surface 
quality and functional performance of additively manufactured parts.
8.2  DEFECTS IN ADDITIVELY MANUFACTURED PARTS
AM is a process that produces parts by layering materials to create a three‑­dimensional 
object. Despite its benefits, such as reduced material waste, lower manufacturing 
costs, and the ability to create complex geometries, AM is not immune to surface 
defects that can compromise part integrity and performance [8]. Different defects 
in additively manufacture, like warping, delamination, poor surface roughness, pil‑
lowing, Z‑banding, and stringing, lead to altering the dimension accuracy of the 
fabricated part. Warping is the deformation of a part’s shape due to thermal stresses 
during the build process. It typically occurs when there is a temperature difference 
between the part and the build platform, causing differential cooling and contrac‑
tion. This defect is more common in materials with high thermal expansion coef‑
ficients, such as Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) or polycarbonate, and can 
be mitigated by using a heated built platform, designing parts with thicker walls, 
and reducing the printing speed [9]. Moreover, delamination is a separation of the 
layers in a printed part, resulting in a weak bond between the layers. It is usually 
caused by insufficient adhesion between the layers due to a lack of heat, speed, or 
FIGURE 8.1  Fused deposition modeling.

pressure. This defect is more common in materials such as Polylactic Acid PLA) or 
Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG); however, it can be eliminated by increas‑
ing the bed temperature, printing slower, or using an adhesive or a raft [10]. Poor sur‑
face roughness is a common defect in AM parts and can occur due to several factors, 
such as layer height, printing speed, and nozzle size. It can affect the aesthetics and 
functionality of a part, especially if it has tight tolerances or needs to slide or rotate. 
To improve the surface quality of the additively manufactured parts, increasing the 
layer height, reducing the printing speed, and using a smaller nozzle size are benefi‑
cial. Furthermore, overhanging is another type of defect that occurs when the printer 
extrudes material in mid‑air without any support, resulting in drooping or sagging 
[11]. This defect is common in parts with overhangs or complex geometries and can 
be mitigated by using support structures, reducing the printing speed, or increas‑
ing the cooling fan speed. Similarly, pillowing is the formation of small bulges or 
bubbles on the top layer of a part due to air trapped in the material [12]. It is caused 
by insufficient cooling or extrusion pressure and can be eliminated by increasing the 
cooling fan speed or decreasing the extrusion rate. Moreover, Z‑banding is a defect 
that occurs when the layers of a printed part are not aligned correctly, resulting in a 
visible step‑like pattern on the surface. This defect is more common in printers with 
non‑rigid frames or poor mechanical components and can be mitigated by upgrad‑
ing the printer’s mechanical components or using improving the slicing quality of 
the computer‑aided design (CAD) model [13]. Furthermore, stringing is a defect that 
occurs when the printer extrudes too much material between two points, resulting in 
thin threads or strings of material. This defect is more common in materials such as 
PLA or ABS and can be removed by reducing the printing temperature or increasing 
the retraction speed [14]. Surface defects are a common issue in AM parts and can 
affect the part’s integrity and performance. Understanding the causes and mitigation 
strategies for each defect can improve the quality of AM parts and achieve better 
print results [15]. Hence new methods are required to reduce the surface roughness 
of the 3D printed parts followed by enhanced mechanical properties.
8.3  POST‑PROCESSING METHOD
The present work discusses the post‑processing methods available for surface 
enhancement of AM parts, their advantages and disadvantages, and their potential 
impact on the overall quality of the parts. The different surface post‑processing 
methods are categorized based on the energy utilized during their operation, i.e., 
chemical, mechanical, and thermal, and are listed in Figure 8.2.
8.3.1  Chemical polishing
In chemical polishing, a chemical solution is used to remove a thin layer of material 
from the surface of the part, resulting in a smoother and more polished surface [16]. 
Chemical polishing involves the dissolution of material from the surface of a part in 
a chemical solution. The technique primarily depends on the selective etching of the 
surface, with the etch rate being faster in regions with defects or roughness, as shown 
in Figure 8.3. The chemical solution used for polishing is typically an acidic or alka‑
line solution, depending on the type of material being polished. The chemical reaction 

155
Post-processing methods for surface enhancement
between the solution and the material results in the formation of a thin layer of oxide or 
salt, which is then removed by rinsing the part with water [17]. The choice of chemical 
solution for polishing depends on the material of the part being polished. Metals, ceram‑
ics, and polymers all have different chemical properties and require different types of 
solutions for polishing. Some commonly used solutions for metal polishing include 
nitric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid, while for polymer polishing, acetone or 
isopropyl alcohol may be used [18]. For ceramic parts, hydrofluoric acid or potassium 
hydroxide may be used [19]. There are several techniques for the chemical polishing 
of additively manufactured parts [20]. One commonly used technique is immersion 
polishing, where the part is immersed in the chemical solution for a certain period, 
followed by rinsing with water. Jet polishing is another method where the chemical

solution is sprayed onto the surface of the part using a high‑pressure jet, resulting in 
a more uniform polishing. Chemical polishing offers several advantages over other 
post‑processing techniques. It can be used to achieve a high level of surface finish with 
a smooth and polished surface. Furthermore, it is a relatively simple and inexpensive 
process, requiring minimal equipment and expertise. Moreover, it can be used for a 
wide range of materials, including metals, ceramics, and polymers. Chemical polishing 
can also be used to remove surface defects such as scratches, cracks, and pores. Hence, 
chemical polishing is widely used to reduce the surface roughness of 3D printed parts. 
The technique is based on selective surface etching using a chemical solution [22]. 
Chemical polishing offers several advantages, including achieving good surface qual‑
ity, a simple and inexpensive process, and working with a wide range of materials. 
Despite its advantages, chemical polishing also has some limitations. It can only be 
used to remove a thin layer of material, typically less than 10 microns. Moreover, it 
may not be suitable for parts with complex geometries or internal channels, as the solu‑
tion may not be able to penetrate into these regions. Furthermore, the process can also 
result in the removal of material from regions with high curvature, resulting in a loss of 
dimensional accuracy [21]. However, the inability to remove large amounts of material 
is another limitation associated with chemical polishing.
8.3.2  Electrochemical polishing
Electrochemical polishing (EP) is a post‑processing technique that can improve the 
surface finish and integrity of additively manufactured parts [5]. This technique uses 
an electric current to selectively dissolve surface roughness, defects, and impurities 
from the part’s surface. This review will discuss the principles, materials, techniques, 
limitations, and advantages of EP of additively manufactured parts, along with a liter‑
ature survey of recent research in this area. The principle of EP involves the selective 
anodic dissolution of the surface of the part in an electrolyte solution. The process is 
based on the concept of electrochemistry, where an electric current is passed through 
the part immersed in an electrolyte solution, resulting in the removal of material from 
the surface. The material removed during the process is calculated through the current 
density, the electrolyte solution’s composition, and the part’s surface morphology [5]. 
EP is suitable for a wide range of materials, including metals, alloys, and compos‑
ites. Some commonly used materials for EP of additively manufactured parts include 
stainless steel, titanium alloys, and nickel‑based alloys [24]. The choice of electrolyte 
solution depends on the material being polished, with some common solutions includ‑
ing sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and nitric acid. There are several techniques for EP 
of additively manufactured parts. One commonly used technique is electropolishing, 
where the part is immersed in an electrolyte solution, and an electric current is passed 
through the part, as shown in Figure 8.4 [25]. Another technique is pulse EP, where 
the current is pulsed, resulting in a more controlled and uniform polishing. Jet EP is 
another technique where the electrolyte solution is sprayed onto the surface of the 
part using a high‑pressure jet, resulting in a more uniform polishing [4]. EP offers 
several advantages over other post‑processing methods. It is a relatively simple and 
inexpensive process, requiring minimal equipment and expertise [26]. Furthermore, 
it can be used for a wide range of materials, including metals, alloys, and compos‑
ites. EP can also be used to improve the part’s corrosion resistance and mechanical

properties. Despite its advantages, EP also has some limitations. It may not be suitable 
for parts with complex geometries or internal channels, as the electrolyte solution may 
not penetrate these regions [27]. Furthermore, the process can also remove material 
from regions with high curvature, resulting in a loss of dimensional accuracy [28]. 
Moreover, the process can also result in the formation of hydrogen gas, which can lead 
to hydrogen embrittlement and reduce the part’s mechanical properties [29].
8.3.3  Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining
In some features of AM, the layer height can be decreased for a better surface fin‑
ish but to an extent. This will, in turn, increase the build time and is constrained to 
the available 3D printer. Surface roughness directly results from the chordal effect, 
staircase effect, inter‑road width, and sub‑perimeter voids. It worsens the surface 
quality of the fabricated parts. Inherent effects such as the staircase effect and some‑
times warpage are inevitable. The staircase effect is the difference between CAD 
geometry and the final printed product. It occurs because the layer‑by‑layer slices 
approximate the geometry, and also due to the constraint of the extrusion nozzle 
[64]. To remove these, a number of methods are available depending upon the mate‑
rial deposited. CNC machining is the most straightforward technique to post‑process 
the part. CNC machining is a post‑processing technique that can reduce the surface 
irregularities of additively manufactured parts [6]. This technique involves the use of 
a computer‑controlled cutting tool to remove material from the part’s surface, result‑
ing in a smoother and more uniform surface finish. The principle of CNC machining 
involves the use of a computer‑controlled cutting tool to remove material from the 
part’s surface, as shown in Figure 8.5 [31]. The process is based on the concept of sub‑
tractive manufacturing, where the material is detached from the stock of material to 
create the desired shape. In the case of additively manufactured parts, CNC machin‑
ing can be used to reduce surface irregularities, defects, and excess material [32]. 
CNC machining is suitable for a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, 
and composites. Some commonly used materials for CNC machining of additively 
manufactured parts include aluminum, titanium alloys, and carbon fiber‑reinforced 
FIGURE.8.4  Working principle of electropolishing (reproduced with permission) [30].

158
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
polymers. The choice of cutting tool and machining parameters depends on the mate‑
rial being machined, with some common parameters, namely, depth of cut, feed rate, 
and cutting speed. Several techniques exist for the CNC machining of additively 
manufactured parts [33]. One commonly used technique is three‑axis machining, 
where the cutting tool moves along three axes to detach the material from the part’s 
surface. Another technique is five‑axis machining, where the cutting tool can move 
along five axes (X, Y, Z, A, and B) to machine complex geometries and curved sur‑
faces. Hybrid machining, combining additive and subtractive manufacturing, is also 
becoming increasingly popular [34]. CNC machining offers several advantages over 
other post‑processing techniques. It also produces a good surface quality with unifor‑
mity. Moreover, it can also be used to remove excess material and improve the part’s 
dimensional accuracy [35]. Furthermore, it is a relatively fast and efficient process, 
requiring minimal manual intervention. Finally, it can be used for a wide range of 
materials, including metals, plastics, and composites. Despite its advantages, CNC 
machining also has some limitations. It can be time‑consuming and expensive, espe‑
cially for parts with complex geometries. Moreover, it can result in the loss of mate‑
rial and reduce the mechanical properties of the part [36]. Furthermore, it may not 
be suitable for parts with internal channels or delicate features, as the cutting tool 
may not be able to access these regions. Recent research has focused on improving 
the effectiveness and efficiency of CNC machining for reducing the surface rough‑
ness value of 3D printed parts [37]. This technique produces uniform surface quality, 
removes excess material, and enhances the dimensional accuracy of the part.
8.3.4  Barrel finishing
Barrel finishing is a commonly used mass‑finishing technique that can enhance the 
surface quality of 3D printed parts [38]. This technique involves placing the parts 
FIGURE 8.5  Wire arc additive manufactured part followed by CNC machining to improve 
the surface quality of the fabricated part.

159
Post-processing methods for surface enhancement
to be finished in a rotating barrel filled with abrasive media, which removes surface 
roughness and improves the part’s surface finish, as shown in Figure 8.6. The prin‑
ciple of barrel finishing involves placing the parts to be finished in a rotating barrel 
filled with abrasive media [39]. The abrasive media, which can be made of materials 
such as ceramic, plastic, or steel, rubs against the part’s surface, removing surface 
roughness and improving the surface finish. The process is based on the concept 
of mass finishing, where a large number of parts can be finished at the same time. 
Barrel finishing is suitable for a wide range of materials, including metals, plastics, 
and composites [40]. Some commonly used materials for barrel finishing of addi‑
tively manufactured parts include titanium alloys, stainless steel, and aluminum. The 
choice of abrasive media depends on the material being finished, with some com‑
mon media including ceramic balls, plastic chips, and steel pins. There are several 
techniques for barrel finishing of additively manufactured parts [41]. One commonly 
used technique is vibratory finishing, where the barrel is vibrated to enhance the 
abrasive action of the media. Another technique is centrifugal barrel finishing, where 
the barrel is rotated at high speeds to create a centrifugal force that enhances the 
finishing action of the media. Magnetic barrel finishing, where the abrasive media is 
magnetized to improve the finishing action, is also becoming increasingly popular. 
Barrel finishing offers several advantages over other post‑processing techniques [37]. 
It can be used to produce a highly polished surface. Moreover, it can be used to finish 
a huge number of workpieces simultaneously, making it a highly efficient process. 
Furthermore, it is a relatively very cost‑efficient and simple process, requiring mini‑
mal manual intervention. Also, it can be used for a wide range of materials, including 
plastics, metals, and composites. Despite its advantages, barrel finishing also has 
some limitations. It may not be suitable for parts with delicate features or internal 
channels, as the abrasive media may not be able to access these regions. Furthermore, 
it may result in material loss and reduce the part’s mechanical properties. Moreover, 
it may not be suitable for parts with complex geometries, as the abrasive media may 
not be able to reach all parts of the surface [42].

8.3.5  Magnetorheological finishing
Magnetorheological finishing (MRF) is an advanced polishing technique that uses 
a magnetorheological fluid to remove surface irregularities and enhance the part’s 
quality of 3D fabricated parts [44]. The principle of MRF involves using a magneto‑
rheological fluid, which is a suspension of magnetic particles in a carrier fluid. When 
a magnetic field is applied to the fluid, the particles align along the field lines, increas‑
ing the viscosity and making the fluid more abrasive, as shown in Figure 8.7 [45]. 
The fluid is then applied to the part’s surface to be finished, and a magnetic field is 
applied to the fluid, causing the abrasive particles to reduce the surface irregularities 
and improve the surface finish [46]. MRF is suitable for various materials, includ‑
ing metals, ceramics, and glasses [47]. Some commonly used materials for MRF of 
additively manufactured parts include stainless steel, titanium alloys, and aluminum 
[48]. The choice of magnetorheological fluid and magnetic field strength depends on 
the finished material, with some common fluids including iron oxide and carbonyl 
iron particles [49]. There are several techniques for MRF of additively manufactured 
parts. One commonly used technique is rotary MRF, where the part to be finished 
is rotated while the magnetorheological fluid is applied. Another technique is recip‑
rocating MRF, where the part is moved back and forth while the fluid is applied 
[50]. Another technique is fixed abrasive MRF, where a fixed abrasive is added to 
the magnetorheological fluid to improve the finishing action. MRF offers several 
advantages over other post‑processing techniques. It can also be used to produce 
uniform mirror‑like polished surface [51]. Furthermore, it can be used to finish parts 
FIGURE 8.7  Working principle of MRF (reproduced with permission) [44].

161
Post-processing methods for surface enhancement
with complicated shapes and geometries, as the magnetorheological fluid can access 
hard‑to‑reach areas [52]. Moreover, it can be used for various materials, including 
metals, ceramics, and glasses. Also, it is a relatively simple and low‑cost process, 
requiring minimal manual intervention [53]. Despite its advantages, MRF also has 
some limitations. Moreover, it may not be suitable for parts with delicate features or 
internal channels, as the abrasive particles may be unable to access these regions. 
Furthermore, it may result in the loss of material and reduce the part’s mechani‑
cal properties. Finally, the choice of magnetorheological fluid and magnetic field 
strength needs to be carefully optimized for each material, which can be costly and 
time‑consuming [54].
8.3.6  Laser polishing
Laser polishing (LP) is a promising technique for reducing the surface irregularities 
of additively manufactured parts [7]. It is a process that uses a laser beam to melt 
and resolidify the surface of a part, resulting in a smooth and polished surface [55]. 
The laser beam is focused on the surface of the part, and the energy of the beam 
melts a thin layer of material, as shown in Figure 8.8 [56]. As the material cools and 
solidifies, it forms a smooth and uniform surface. LP is suitable for a wide range of 
materials, including metals, ceramics, and glasses [57]. Some commonly used mate‑
rials for LP of additively manufactured parts include stainless steel, titanium alloys, 
and aluminum [58]. The choice of laser parameters, such as power and scanning 
speed, depends on the material being polished. There are several techniques for LP 
additively manufactured parts. One commonly used technique is continuous wave 
LP, where the laser beam is continuously applied to the surface of the part. Another 
technique is pulsed LP, where the laser beam is pulsed to achieve a more precise and 
controlled melting and resolidification of the surface. LP offers several advantages 
over other post‑processing techniques [59]. It can also be used to produce uniform 
surface quality. Furthermore, it can finish parts with complex geometries, as the laser 
beam can access hard‑to‑reach areas. Moreover, it can be used for various materials, 
including metals, ceramics, and glasses. Finally, it is a relatively simple and low‑cost 
FIGURE 8.8  Laser polished surface (reproduced with permission) [63].

162
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
process, requiring minimal manual intervention [60]. Despite its advantages, LP also 
has some limitations. It may result in the loss of material and reduce the mechanical 
properties of the part [61]. Moreover, it may not be suitable for parts with delicate fea‑
tures or internal channels, as the laser beam may not be able to access these regions. 
Also, the choice of laser parameters needs to be carefully optimized for each mate‑
rial, which can be time‑consuming and expensive [62]. Recent research has focused 
on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of LP to reduce the surface irregulari‑
ties of the 3D fabricated parts [63].
8.3.7  Electron beam irradiation
Electron beam irradiation is the most efficient technique for enhancing the surface 
quality of additively manufactured parts [65]. Electron beam irradiation is a process 
that uses a beam of high‑energy electrons to irradiate the surface of a part, result‑
ing in the modification of the surface properties. The high‑energy electrons interact 
with the atoms of the surface, causing structural changes and inducing new sur‑
face features. Electron beam irradiation can be used for various materials, including 
metals, ceramics, and polymers [66]. Some commonly used materials for electron 
beam irradiation of additively manufactured parts include titanium alloys, stainless 
steel, and aluminum. The choice of electron beam parameters, such as energy and 
dose, depends on the irradiated material. There are several techniques for electron 
beam irradiation of additively manufactured parts. One commonly used technique 
is continuous wave electron beam irradiation, where the electron beam is continu‑
ously applied to the surface of the part [67]. Another technique is pulsed electron 
beam irradiation, where the electron beam is pulsed to achieve a more precise and 
controlled surface modification. Electron beam irradiation offers several advantages 
over other post‑processing techniques. It can be used to modify the surface proper‑
ties of the part, including its hardness, wear resistance, and corrosion resistance. 
Moreover, it can be used for a smooth and polished surface. Furthermore, it can be 
used for various materials, including metals, ceramics, and polymers. Finally, it is 
a relatively simple and low‑cost process, requiring minimal manual intervention. 
Despite its advantages, electron beam irradiation also has some limitations. It may 
result in the modification of the bulk properties of the part, which can affect its 
mechanical properties. Also, it may not be suitable for parts with delicate features 
or internal channels, as the electron beam may not be able to access these regions. 
Moreover, the choice of electron beam parameters needs to be carefully optimized 
for each material, which can be time‑consuming and expensive [68]. Recent research 
has focused on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of electron beam irradia‑
tion for reducing the average surface roughness of 3D printed parts. In conclusion, 
electron beam irradiation is an efficient technique for reducing the surface rough‑
ness of additively manufactured parts. It offers several advantages over other post‑­
processing techniques, including the ability to change the surface properties of the 
part and produce a high level of surface finish. However, it also has some limitations, 
such as the potential modification of the bulk properties of the part and the need for 
careful optimization of electron beam parameters.

Post-processing methods for surface enhancement
8.4  CONCLUSIONS
The present work aims to analyze the influence of the various post‑processing meth‑
ods to improve the surface quality of the additively manufactured parts. The cat‑
egorization is made based on the energy source used during the surface finishing 
operation, i.e., chemical, mechanical, and thermal energy. The major finding of the 
research work is summarized below:
•	 Chemical polishing is a widely used post‑processing technique for improv‑
ing the surface finish of additively manufactured parts. The technique is 
based on selective surface etching using a chemical solution. Chemical pol‑
ishing offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve a high level 
of surface finish, a simple and inexpensive process, and the ability to work 
with a wide range of materials. However, the technique also has some limi‑
tations, including the inability to remove large amounts of material and the 
limitations.
•	 Barrel finishing is an extensively used mass‑finishing technique for reduc‑
ing surface irregularities of 3D printed parts. This technique can be used 
to achieve a high level of surface finish and finish a large number of parts 
simultaneously.
•	 EP is a widely used post‑processing technique for improving the surface 
finish with minimum surface finishing time. However, an adverse effect of 
electrolytes on the polished surfaces are major challenge.
•	 CNC machining is a widely used post‑processing technique for improving 
the surface quality of additively manufactured parts. This technique can be 
used to achieve a high level of surface finish, remove excess material, and 
improve the dimensional accuracy of the part.
•	 Electron beam irradiation is a promising technique for improving the sur‑
face quality of additively manufactured parts. It offers several advantages 
over other post‑processing techniques, including the ability to enhance the 
surface properties of the part and produce a high level of surface finish. 
However, it also has some limitations, such as the potential modification 
of the bulk properties of the part and the need for careful optimization of 
electron beam parameters.
•	 MRF is capable of producing surface roughness value in the range of a few 
nanometers and produces a mirror‑like polished surface without altering the 
surface topography of the workpiece. However, the slower polishing rate is 
a major limitation of the process.

9.1  INTRODUCTION TO PROCESS AUTOMATION
The surface finishing of an object is essential for various reasons, such as for improv‑
ing its appearance, increasing durability, enhancing functionality, and preventing 
corrosion. So, conventional finishing processes are developed for the finishing of 
objects, which play an essential role in achieving the desired level of finish on an 
object’s surface. These processes typically involve using traditional techniques and 
equipment, such as sanding, polishing, buffing, grinding, honing, and lapping, to 
alter and improve the surface of an object. However, precision finishing is challeng‑
ing with traditional finishing techniques because the cutting edge’s relative motion 
to the workpiece results in unpredictable forces that damage the subsurface. So, 
advanced nano‑finishing processes needs to be developed for precise finishing with 
dimensional accuracy.
The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) emphasizes new technologies 
such as automation, robotics, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create more efficient 
and effective production processes. In precision finishing, Industry 4.0 has the poten‑
tial to revolutionize the way objects are finished by enabling more precise, accurate, 
and consistent finishing techniques. This chapter explores several abrasive‑based fin‑
ishing techniques and describes the process parameters.
Process automation uses technology to automate repetitive or manual processes 
to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase the productivity. The benefits of 
process automation are shown in Figure 9.1. Software applications, robots, AI, and 
other advanced technologies can achieve this process automation in precision finish‑
ing to ensure consistent quality and accuracy. Another benefit of process automation 
in abrasive‑based precision finishing is that this can reduce the amount of time and 
labour required to complete the task.

9.2  PROCESS AUTOMATION TOOLS
The process automation tools can help abrasive‑based precision finishing to achieve 
greater efficiency, accuracy, and consistency in their finishing processes while 
reducing the risk of error and waste. The tools of process automation are shown in 
Figure 9.2.
9.2.1  Motion parameters and control
Motion parameters and control are essential for creating realistic and accurate move‑
ment in various applications and the movement of physical objects. Each abrasive‑­
based finishing process requires the control of motion parameters to control the 
workpiece and the tool movement properly. There exist multiple ways of providing 
the power to the worktable and tool.
A motion control system controls a machine’s or mechanical system’s movement, 
such as a robot, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine, or production line

(Figure 9.3). The primary function of a motion control system is to generate and 
control motion in an accurate and repeatable manner; for this, various components of 
the motion control system are required, which are shown in Figure 9.4.
9.2.2  Actuators
Actuators, typically motors, are used in abrasive‑based finishing techniques to 
impart motion to the worktable or tool. The actuators generate activity in the system, 
such as linear or rotary motion. Actuators convert an input signal, typically electri‑
cal, hydraulic, or pneumatic, into mechanical movement or force. They are used in 
motion control systems to generate motion in a specific direction, speed, and power 
to accomplish a particular task. Actuators come in different varieties (Figure 9.5) 
and selecting the best actuator for a given application depends on the system’s needs.
•	 Electric actuators
Electric actuators are powered by electricity and convert electrical 
energy into mechanical motion. AC or DC power sources can power them 
and are often used in applications that require high precision and accuracy. 
The different types of electric actuators are shown in Figure 9.6.
•	 Hydraulic actuators
Hydraulic actuators use oil or water to produce mechanical motion. As 
a result of their high force output, they are commonly used in heavy‑duty 
applications.

•	 Pneumatic actuators
Pneumatic actuators produce mechanical motion by using compressed 
air. They are known for their fast response time and high‑force output and 
are commonly used in industrial applications.
•	 Piezoelectric actuators
A piezoelectric actuator converts electrical energy into mechani‑
cal motion using a piezoelectric material. They are known for their fast 
response time and high precision, and they are commonly used in applica‑
tions that require fine‑tuned control.
9.2.3  Controllers
The controllers are the central part of the motion control system. They receive inputs 
from sensors and other sources and use algorithms to calculate appropriate output 
to send to the actuators. The examples of controllers include PLCs (Programmable 
Logic Controllers), CNCs, and motion controllers.

9.2.4  Sensors
The sensors provide feedback to the controllers about the system’s position, veloc‑
ity, and other parameters. Sensors play a critical role in abrasive‑based precision 
finishing processes by providing real‑time data and feedback of various parameters 
such as force, pressure, temperature, and vibration. The examples of sensors include 
encoders, linear and rotary sensors, and accelerometers. Sensors play a crucial role 
in modern‑day machines. They detect and measure various physical, chemical, or 
biological parameters to enable devices to operate more efficiently, accurately, and 
safely. Some of the most common sensors used in machines are shown in Figure 9.7.
9.2.5  Power supply
The power supply provides the necessary power to the actuators to generate 
motion in the system. Power supply in machines is critical for their operation, as it 
allows for the required electrical energy to power the machine’s components and 
subsystems.
9.2.6  Feedback system
A feedback system can be helpful in abrasive‑based precision finishing processes. 
The feedback system allows the process to be continuously monitored and adjusted 
to achieve desired results. The feedback system provides position, velocity, and other 
aspects of the system to the controller. This information is used to adjust the system’s

motion. In a feedback system, the production of a procedure or method is measured 
and compared to a desired or reference value. The resulting error is used to adjust the 
inputs to the operation or system to reduce the error. This is done to bring the output 
closer to the desired value.
9.2.7  Communication system
A communication system enables the exchange of information between two or more 
entities, such as computers or devices. The communication system is responsible for 
transferring the data between different motion control system components, including 
controllers, sensors, and actuators. The communication systems can be analog or 
digital and can operate over various media types, including wire, radio waves, optical 
fibres, and satellite links. The flow diagram of the communication system is shown 
in Figure 9.8.
9.2.8  Artificial intelligence
AI creates computer systems capable of doing tasks that usually require human 
intelligence. These abilities include spoken language processing, speech recogni‑
tion, visual perception, and decision‑making [1]. AI systems use a combination of 
algorithms, data, and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to learn from experience 
and improve their performance over time. AI has many machine applications, from 
simple devices to complex industrial systems. A few examples of integration of AI in 
machines are listed below:
To prevent breakdowns and optimize performance, AI can monitor machine 
conditions in real time. By examining information gathered from sensors 
and other sources, AI systems can identify patterns and anomalies that indi‑
cate potential problems and alert operators before a breakdown occurs.
AI is widely used in developing autonomous vehicles, such as self‑driving cars 
and drones. These vehicles utilize a combination of sensors, cameras, and 
ML algorithms to navigate and make judgements in real time.
AI can track product quality throughout production, spotting flaws and abnor‑
malities that might point to a fault with the procedure. By examining sensor 
data and other data sources, AI systems can spot patterns and anomalies 
that indicate problems and alert operators before a product is delivered to 
customers.

Process automation
AI is utilized extensively in robotics, enabling robots to execute complicated 
tasks in diverse environments, such as manufacturing, logistics, and health‑
care. Using ML algorithms, robots can adapt changing situations and learn 
from experience to improve their performance.
9.2.9  Control hardware and control panel
Utilizing control hardware and the control panel is a crucial aspect of process auto‑
mation that should be considered when automating magnetic field‑assisted finishing 
processes. Control hardware and control panels are both components of a control 
system that enable the monitoring and controlling industrial processes.
Control hardware: Control hardware refers to the physical components of a 
control system that enable communication and control between the control‑
ler and the process. Control hardware typically includes sensors, actuators, 
PLCs, and other parts, as shown in Figure 9.9. Sensors detect changes in the 
process, such as temperature, pressure, or flow rate, and send that informa‑
tion to the controller. The controller uses that information to make decisions 
and send commands to the actuators, which control the process by adjusting 
valves, pumps, motors, or other equipment. PLCs coordinate the communi‑
cation between the sensors, controller, and actuators.
Control panel: A control panel is a user interface that allows operators to 
monitor and control the industrial process. Control panels typically include 
displays, switches, buttons, and other controls that enable operators to view 
process variables and adjust setpoints or control parameters.
9.2.10  ML algorithms
ML algorithms are progressively employed in machines to facilitate automation and 
improve performance. Here are a few examples of how ML algorithms are being 
used in devices:

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
ML algorithms are used in computer vision applications to recognize and clas‑
sify images. For example, ML algorithms can detect product defects on a 
production line by analysing camera images.
ML algorithms can optimize the performance of machines by adjusting param‑
eters and control settings in real time. For example, ML algorithms can be 
employed to adjust the speed and torque of motors in response to changing 
load conditions.
9.2.11  Number of axes
The number of axes a machine can control depends on the specific device and its intended 
application. However, many modern machines can control multiple axes simultaneously, 
enabling complex movements and operations to be performed with high precision.
For example, a CNC machine typically has three or more axes, which control the 
movement of a cutting tool or other workpiece. As the workpiece’s horizontal, verti‑
cal, and depth dimensions are indicated by the three axes, the three axes are X, Y, and 
Z. Some CNC machines also have additional axes, such as a fourth axis that enables 
rotational movement or a fifth axis that allows tilting the workpiece. In addition to 
CNC machines, other machines may have multiple axes for specific applications. For 
example, a robotic arm may have multiple axes of movement to enable it to perform 
tasks such as picking up and moving objects in a factory or laboratory setting.
9.2.12  User interface
When automating a mechanical system to a significant level, it is essential to include 
a user interface. User interfaces are created to see how an automated system commu‑
nicates with the individual employing the system. A typical user interface operates 
in two modes:
Automatic mode: The user interface’s automated mode sets the system’s 
parameters before a process starts. After pressing the start button, the pro‑
cedure then begins automatically.
Manual mode: A machine is operated directly by the operator without auto‑
mation or computer control. The operator operates the equipment manually 
and often uses physical controls like levers, buttons, or pedals.
9.3  PROCESS AUTOMATION ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS
9.3.1  Advantages
Process automation uses technology and software to automate and streamline manu‑
facturing or production processes. Some of the advantages of process automation 
include the following:
Automated systems perform tasks faster and more consistently than human 
workers, reducing cycle times and increasing throughput.

177
Process automation
Automation helps to improve production process accuracy and consistency.
Automation helps to improve safety in manufacturing and production 
environments.
Manufacturers can reduce their dependency on human labour by automating 
tasks, which could result in lower labour costs and increased profitability.
9.3.2  Limitations
While process automation offers many advantages, there are also limitations to its 
use. Some of the limitations of process automation include the following:
Implementing process automation systems can be expensive, requiring signifi‑
cant hardware, software, and training investment.
Automation systems often require technical design, implementation, and main‑
tenance skills.
Process automation systems rely on technology and software, which can be 
vulnerable to failures, bugs, or cyber‑attacks. This can lead to downtime 
and potential disruptions in production.
Automation can reduce human interaction in production processes, which can 
have social and psychological impacts on workers. In addition, automated 
systems may lack human workers’ intuition and problem‑solving skills, 
making it difficult to address specific issues or unexpected events.
9.4  ABRASIVE‑BASED PRECISION FINISHING TECHNIQUES
Abrasive‑based precision finishing techniques are surface‑finishing methods that 
involve using abrasive particles to remove small amounts of material from a work‑
piece, to improve its surface quality and dimensional accuracy. Abrasive‑based super 
finishing processes used for flat and freeform surfaces are:
•	 Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) process
•	 Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) process
•	 Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM) process
9.4.1  MRF process
The MRF method uses a magnetically controlled fluid known as Magnetorheological 
Polishing (MRP) fluid to finish complex geometries and freeform surfaces pre‑
cisely. Under magnetic field influence, the rheological characteristics of MRP flu‑
ids change and show a solid viscoelastic texture. The basic abrasive‑based MRF 
precision finishing process is related to finishing flat surfaces. For automation con‑
sideration, we will focus on MRF variants and their parameters. Some variants of 
MRF are:
-	 Magnetorheological Abrasive Flow Finishing (MRAFF)
-	 Magnetorheological Abrasive Honing (MRAH)

178
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
-	 Ball End Magnetorheological Finishing (BEMRF)
-	 Chemo‑Mechanical Magnetorheological Finishing (CM‑MRF)
9.4.1.1  Process parameters for MRF
Process parameters refer to the factors in a particular manufacturing or production 
process. The fishbone diagram of the MRF process parameters is shown in Figure 9.10.
9.4.1.2  Process automation for MRF
Process automation can play a crucial role in MRF by improving the consistency and 
accuracy of the finishing process. Now we will study process automation in MRF 
variants to control their process parameters.
-	 MRAFF
Two hydraulic cylinders move in and out to push and pull the MRP fluid over 
the workpiece during the MRAFF procedure (Figure 9.11). At the same time, 
the MRP fluid is subject to the influence of an energized electromagnet out‑
side the polishing chamber. Automation can enable real‑time monitoring of the 
MRAFF process to provide immediate feedback on the quality of the finished 
components, allowing for adjustments and corrective actions if required.
-	 MRAH
Figure 9.12 shows the schematic of the MRAH process. In this, the work‑
piece is attached to the spindle and is given rotation on its axis; the only other 
motion in MRAH is the movement of a plunger that pushes and pulls the MR 
fluid to and fro over the workpiece. This magnetic field‑assisted finishing pro‑
cess uses servo or stepper motors to move the polishing fluid plunger.
-	 BEMRF
Figure 9.13 shows a schematic diagram of the BEMRF process. Pressurized 
MRP fluid is pumped into the hollow spindle during the BEMRF process. 
FIGURE 9.10  Fishbone diagram of the MRF process parameters (from Ahmad, S., Singari, 
R. M., & Mishra, R. S., Taylor & Francis, 98(4), 186–198, 2020) [2].

179
Process automation
An electric motor turns the entire assembly while the spindle is inside an 
electromagnet. This arrangement is used for flat workpiece surfaces and rep‑
lica profiles of the tooltip. Still, 3D freeform surfaces are finished using pro‑
cess atomization and named a five‑axis CNC BEMRF process. There have 
been various advancements in the development of BEMRF process over the 
last decade [5–10]
The five‑axis CNC BEMRF machine can move in three linear directions 
along the X, Y, and Z axes and two rotating directions along the B and C 
axes, respectively. The B and C rotation axes are orthogonal. B and C are 
parallel to Y and Z, respectively. The X, Y, and Z linear axes are orthogonal. 
Figure 9.14 shows the BEMRF setup arrangement of five motion axes and 
the BEMRF tool head.
-	 CM‑MRF process
Figure 9.15 shows the schematic diagram of the CM‑MRF setup. CM‑MRF 
[13] is an advanced polishing process to finish precision optical surfaces such 
as lenses, mirrors, and prisms. This process combines chemical reactions, 
mechanical abrasion, and magnetorheological (MR) fluid technology to

produce high‑quality surface finishes. Process automation in the CM‑MRF 
process involves a controller, three‑axis CNC‑based machine, a slurry sys‑
tem, a finishing head, and a working table adjustment by using various com‑
puter software and hardware systems to automate and control the different 
stages of the process.
9.4.2  MAF process
MAF is a surface‑finishing process that uses a magnetic field to control the move‑
ment of abrasive particles to remove the material from a workpiece. This process 
achieves a high‑quality surface finish on various materials, including metals, ceram‑
ics, and composites. Process automation in the MAF process involves using multiple 
computer software and hardware systems to automate and control the different stages 
of the process. Some variants of MAF are as follows:
-	 Internal finishing by magnetic field‑assisted finishing
-	 Electrolytic Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (EMAF)
-	 Cylindrical Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (CMAF)
-	 Ultrasonic‑Assisted Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (UAMAF)
FIGURE 9.12  Schematic of the MRAH process (from Paswan, S. K., Bedi, T. S., & Singh, 
A. K., Elsevier, 376, 1207–1221, 2017) [4].

181
Process automation
9.4.2.1  Process parameters for MAF
Process parameters are essential to achieve the appropriate surface smoothness and 
material removal rate during MAF. MAF process parameters are like those of MRF. 
The main difference between MRF and MAF is the abrasive particles used. MRF 
is a process that uses a slurry containing magnetorheological fluid, which is a type 
of intelligent fluid that changes its viscosity in response to a magnetic field. MAF is 
a process that uses abrasive particles that are magnetically susceptible, such as iron 
oxide particles, which are mixed with a non‑magnetic carrier fluid to form a slurry. 
The fishbone diagram of the MAF process parameters is shown in Figure 9.16.
9.4.2.2  Process automation for MAF
Process automation for MAF involves using advanced control systems and robotics 
to automate various aspects of the finishing process. This can improve the finishing 
process’s consistency, accuracy, and efficiency, reducing the need for manual inter‑
vention and operator skills. Now we study process automation in MAF variants to 
control their process parameters.

183
Process automation
-	 Internal finishing by magnetic field‑assisted finishing
Internal finishing by MAF is used to finish interior surfaces of complex, 
difficult‑to‑access parts such as bores, cylinders, and pipes. Process auto‑
mation can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of internal finishing 
through MAF. Process automation in MAF uses robotic systems to control 
the positioning of the workpiece and tool. The robot can be programmed 
to move the workpiece precisely and accurately along the magnetic tool, 
ensuring uniform and consistent material removal and polishing using 
advanced control systems to regulate the slurry’s flow rate and the work‑
piece’s movement (Figure 9.17).

and MAF principles. In this process, a magnetic field is used to hold abrasive 
particles in place on the surface of the workpiece. In contrast, an electrolytic 
solution dissolves material from the workpiece surface. Process automation 
can be essential in improving the efficiency and consistency of EMAF. An 
automated system can be used to control the electrolyte solution’s flow and 
monitor and adjust the concentration of the solution as needed. This can 
help to maintain consistent finishing conditions and improve the quality of 
the finished product. Automated sensors and control systems can monitor 
and control various process parameters.
-	 CMAF
Figure 9.19 shows the schematic diagram of a CMAF. CMAF is a surface‑­
finishing process used to improve the surface quality of cylindrical com‑
ponents. Process automation of CMAF can significantly enhance the 
efficiency and consistency of the process. Automation can help to reduce 
operator error, increase productivity, and improve the quality of finished 
parts. The workpiece can be placed on a rotating fixture or conveyor belt to 
move it through the process. Automated systems can monitor the process 
parameters, such as rotational speed, magnetic field strength, and abrasive 
flow rate, to ensure consistent finishing results.
-	 UAMAF
UAMAF is an advanced surface‑finishing process that combines the ben‑
efits of ultrasonic vibrations with MAF. This process is particularly effec‑
tive for finishing hard and brittle materials such as ceramics, glass, and 
hardened steel. Process automation of UAMAF can further improve the

controlled using an automated system to ensure consistent and precise vibra‑
tions. This can be achieved using feedback control systems. Computerized 
systems can monitor the process parameters such as rotational speed, mag‑
netic field strength, abrasive flow rate, and ultrasonic vibration frequency 
and amplitude to ensure consistent finishing results (Figure 9.20).
9.4.3  AFM process
Abrasive‑laden media are extruded across or through the restricted passage between 
the workpiece and tooling. Abrasion of media occurs due to extrusion, resulting in a

related with rubbing, shearing of the asperities, i.e., micro cutting, and flattening due 
to plastic deformation by moving particles under pressure. The basic abrasive‑based 
AFM precision finishing process is related to finishing internal cylindrical surfaces. 
For automation consideration, we will focus on AFM variants and their parameters. 
Some variants of AFM are as follows:
-	 MRAFF
-	 Electrochemical‑aided abrasive flow machining (ECAAFM)
-	 Drill‑bit‑guided abrasive flow finishing (DBG‑AFF)
9.4.3.1  Process parameters for AFM
The process parameters are crucial to achieving the appropriate surface finish and 
material removal rate when using AFM. The fishbone diagram of the AFM process 
parameters is shown in Figure 9.21.
9.4.3.2  Process automation for AFM
Process automation in AFM involves using computer‑controlled systems to control 
the process parameters and ensure consistency and accuracy in the machining pro‑
cess. The automation system controls the process parameters, monitors the process 
in real time, and adjusts to achieve the desired surface finish. Now we study process 
automation in AFM variants to manage their process parameters.

Figure 9.22 shows the schematic diagram of AFM. An AFM machine is 
used for deburring, polishing, and improving the surface finish of complex

MRAFF is a hybrid machining process that combines the principles of AFM 
and MRF. In MRAFF, hydraulic pressure forces an MR fluid containing 
abrasive particles through the workpiece. At the same time, to control MR 
fluid flow, a magnetic field is applied. Process automation becomes increas‑
ingly important because of the characteristics necessary for adequate con‑
trol. These characteristics include the management of hydraulics and pump 
and electromagnet functions (Figure 9.24).
The MRAFF process uses a motor to impart rotary motion to the mag‑
net arrangement. This process is called Rotational Magnetorheological 
Abrasive Flow Finishing (R‑MRAFF) (Figure 9.25). In R‑MRAFF, a rotat‑
ing magnetic field provides rotation to the MR polishing fluid medium. A 
hydraulic unit also offers reciprocating motion to the polishing medium.

ECAAFM (Figure 9.26) is a hybrid machining process that combines the 
principles of AFM and ECM. Process automation in ECAAFM controls 
the electric current and the electrolyte flow rate. Automated systems can  
use sensors and feedback control mechanisms to monitor and adjust real‑time 
current and flow rates—process automation in ECAAFM to control the

Many researchers have worked on abrasive‑based precision finishing processes 
related to flat surfaces or specific techniques developed for specific surface profile 
finishing. Unique fixtures and process automation are required to finish surfaces

ing processes. By automating the process, manufacturers can achieve consistent and

10.1  INTRODUCTION
In the continually evolving realm of manufacturing and precision engineering, 
achieving flawless surface finishes has taken center stage. With industries seeking 
components that deliver superior performance and adhere to stringent tolerances, 
conventional finishing methods often prove inadequate in meeting these exceed‑
ingly high standards. As a result, innovative and advanced finishing processes have 
come to the forefront, pushing the limits of attainable surface quality. Among these 
state‑of‑the‑art techniques, abrasive flow machining (AFM), magnetic abrasive fin‑
ishing (MAF), and magnetorheological finishing (MRF) have emerged as pioneering 
solutions poised to transform the industry. These processes represent a new paradigm 
in surface finishing, harnessing the power of abrasives and magnetic forces to polish 
and refine workpieces with unparalleled precision.
AFM is a non‑traditional finishing process in which a mixture of an abrasive poly‑
mer and gel is extruded due to the pressure difference within the internal surface of 
the workpiece, which results in effective machining [1, 2]. The process finds its appli‑
cation in many areas including in the aerodynamics, aerospace, biomedical, cosmet‑
ics, and manufacturing industries; as a result, the development in this field is rapid. 
With the development of new hybrids, the finishing is achieved up to the nano level. 
The major limitation of the AFM process is the low magnetorheological (MR) and 
large machining time (comparing traditional machining) for which various hybrids 
of AFM are developed [3, 4]. The next abrasive‑based finishing process is MAF, 
193

194
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
which is the prominent process of surface finishing where micro‑ and nano‑finishing 
is achieved. The process uses a rotating magnetic brush made of carbonyl particles 
and abrasive particles placed along the workpiece surface which is to be finished. 
The abrasion mechanism of the abrasive and carbonyl particles results in the mate‑
rial removal process [5]. With the rapid growth of population, the demand for the 
continuous development of non‑traditional machining has significantly increased. A 
significant effort has been made in improving the efficiency of finishing processes 
by using different abrasive types like alumina, Silicon Carbide, diamond calcite (cal‑
cium carbonate), emery (impure corundum), diamond dust (synthetic diamonds are 
used extensively), novaculite, pumice, iron (III) oxide, sand and corundum, which 
are used with different mesh sizes. Many researchers have used abrasives of different 
shapes to achieve an efficient finishing process [6–9].
Against this specific historical backdrop, the concept of MRF utilizing MR fluids 
has emerged. The inception of MRF dates back to the 1950s when Rabinow et al. first 
introduced the concept. Notably, a significant development occurred in 1995 when 
Kordonsky, W. I., et al., secured a patent (US patent) titled “Magnetorheological pol‑
ishing devices and methods” [10], which marked a pivotal point in its advancement. 
Over the ensuing two decades, MRF gained traction, undergoing refinement and wide‑
spread adoption. In comparison to conventional mechanical finishing methods, MRF 
offers distinct advantages attributed to its adaptable interaction dynamics between 
tools and the workpiece. This characteristic engenders a ductile material removal 
process, enhancing precision and surface quality [11–13]. Abrasive‑based finishing 
was probably used in the finishing of 3D printed parts, selective laser melting (SLM) 
projects, additive manufacturing products, and machining of industrial‑based alloys 
[14, 15]. MAF and MRF have emerged as a modern tool in the finishing process. 
These two methods use less force than AFM, and thus have lesser material removal 
rate (MRR) but give a better micro/nano finish comparatively because of the gentle 
magnetic abrasive brush. Many researchers developed sintered media, plasma atom‑
ized particles, viscoelastic media, and magnetorheological shear‑thickening polish‑
ing (MSRTP) media for increasing the efficiency of the process and searched for new 
avenues for finishing delicate, hard, brittle materials and the complex intricate shapes 
of components [16–20].
This review delves into the realm of abrasive‑based advanced finishing processes, 
exploring the principles, capabilities, and emerging trends within AFM, MAF, and 
MRF. By examining these techniques, we aim to shed light on how researchers are 
dealing with precision manufacturing and providing engineers and manufacturers 
with novel tools to achieve levels of surface perfection once thought unattainable. As 
we embark on this exploration of abrasive‑based advanced finishing processes, it is 
essential to understand their underlying mechanisms, applications, and the techno‑
logical advancements that are propelling them forward. Through this examination, 
we will uncover the transformative potential of these techniques and gain insights 
into how they are driving innovation across industries.
10.2  PROCESS HYBRIDIZATIONS AND CLASSIFICATION
The classification of abrasive‑based finishing processes targeted in this chapter may 
be studied from Figure 10.1. Broadly, abrasive‑based finishing is divided into three

main types, which are AFM, MAF, and MRF. Depending upon the requirement, the 
external energy source and the nature of finishing MAF are further divided into ultra‑
sonic assisted magnetic abrasive finishing, chemical assisted MAF, and electrochemical 
assisted MAF. On a similar note, depending upon the experimental setup, MRF is fur‑
ther divided into ball end MRF, magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing, and mag‑
netic float polishing (MFP) [21]. Various hybrids of AFM depending upon the source of 
energy have been developed, which are discussed in the relevant sections (Table 10.1).
10.3  AFM PROCESS
10.3.1  Work principle
AFM is a precision finishing process that utilizes a semi‑solid abrasive media 
(abrasive‑­laden media) to improve the surface quality of complex and hard‑to‑reach 
geometries. The working principle of the AFM process involves the controlled extru‑
sion of a viscoelastic polymer media containing abrasive particles through the work‑
piece’s internal passages and surfaces. The workpiece whose surface is to be finished 
is set within the fixture and the extrusion of media occurs due to the pressure differ‑
ence created by the driver. Thus, the main purpose is to achieve the abrasion process 
between the workpiece surface and the abrasive particles. This abrasion is achieved 
with the combination of many other sources like magnetic action, electrochemical 
dissipation of ions like in the electrochemical machining (ECM) process, centrifugal 
action of the centrifugal force‑generating (CFG) electrode, or rotation of the work‑
piece as in the rotational AFM process. The passage of time has shown various novel 
methods to achieve abrasive workpiece interaction and thus increase the material 
removal of the AFM process. Figure 10.2 provides a step‑by‑step explanation of the 
AFM process working principle (Figure 10.3).
10.3.2  Variants and hybridization in AFM
10.3.2.1  Centrifugal force assisted AFM process
The centrifugal force assisted abrasive flow machining (CFAAFM) process [22–24] 
includes a CFG rod aligned along the axis of the cylinder of the process. When 
the rod rotates, it gives a centrifugal effect to the abrasive present in the media. 

197
Precision finishing innovations
This abrasive hits the workpiece’s surface, resulting in practical and desired machin‑
ing. The resultant combination of the reciprocation and the centrifugal force results 
in effective machining, thus improving the MR and ΔRa. Figure 10.4 shows the prin‑
ciple of CFAAFM.
10.3.2.2  Drill‑bit‑guided AFM process
The next variant in the AFM field is the drill‑bit‑guided abrasive flow machining 
process (DBGAFM) [25]. This process is similar to CFAAFM. Still, the difference 
is that instead of a rotatory centrifugal rod, a fixed drill bit aligns coaxially with the 
FIGURE 10.4  The CFAAFM process [24].
FIGURE 10.3  The schematic of a one‑way AFM process [24].
FIGURE 10.2  Step‑by‑step explanation of the AFM process.

198
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
cylinder, which provides a restricted passage to the abrasive, which results in the MR 
and the effective machining process. Figure 10.5 shows DBGAFM.
10.3.2.3  Helical AFM process
In the helical AFM [26], a drill bit is rotated to provide the centrifugal action and 
machining in the restrictive path due to the helical profile with the advantage of the 
conventional AFM process. Figure 10.6 shows the helical AFM process.
10.3.2.4  Rotational AFM process
The workpiece’s course provides the effective rotation between the workpiece and 
the abrasive, which results in the same effect that can be achieved by giving the 
FIGURE 10.6  Helical abrasive flow machining.
FIGURE 10.5  Drill‑bit‑guided abrasive flow machining process [25].

199
Precision finishing innovations
CFAAFM. So the workpiece is rotated by a specific mechanism. Thus, effective 
machining occurs by combining the media’s reciprocation and the rotation of the 
workpiece [27].
10.3.2.5  Magnetic force assisted AFM process
The first hybridization in the process is the magnetic force assisted AFM process 
[28]. This process combines a magnetic force and the conventional machining pro‑
cess. The process involves including the carbonyl particles in the media affected by 
the magnetic force. The carbonyl particles hit the abrasive, and this abrasive hits the 
surface which is to be finished, thus making the process effective. Figure 10.7 shows 
the principle of magnetic AFM.
10.3.2.6  Ultrasonic AFM process
The next hybrid is the ultrasonic AFM process [29]. Here, ultrasonic vibrations are 
given perpendicular to the axis of the media’s reciprocation. These longitudinal 
vibrations and the conventional AFM process provide effective machining and the 
desired surface finish.
10.3.2.7  Electrochemical assisted AFM process
The hybridization is the electrochemical assisted AFM (ECMAAFM) [30]. This 
hybridization aims to dissolve the anodic workpiece by the electrolyte, thus making 
the requisite material removal. The workpiece is made of an anode, and the cylinder 
is made of a cathode. The cylinder is generally made of copper for this process. The 
major limitation of this process is the uncontrolled dissolution of the workpiece. 
So the selection of the electrolyte is of paramount importance. Figure 10.8 shows 
EFAAFM.
10.3.2.8  Various other hybrid AFM processes
Hybrid of MFAFM and CFAAFM: this process involves using a permanent magnet 
that attracts the laden media forced by the centrifugal force produced by the rotating 
FIGURE 10.7  Magnetic force assisted abrasive flow machining.

200
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
rod placed coaxially inside the cylinder. This results in the effective machining of 
the process with CFAAFM, MFAFM, and the conventional AFM process. The next 
hybridization in the process is the hybrid electrochemical and CFAAFM [31].
Hybrid of ECMAFM and CFAAFM process: ECMAFM and CFAAFM and AFM 
have been clubbed together to rule over the low MR of the conventional AFM process 
[24]. Researchers have used an increased amount of KI in the media so that the media’s 
anodic dissolving property increases; also, the rod responsible for the centrifugal action 
workpiece is made one of the cathodes. So the combination is helpful in this case.
Thermal additive centrifugal force assisted abrasive flow machining process 
(TACAFM): This brings the advantage of electric discharge machining and the 
TACAFM process takes this into account [32–34]. In this process, a non‑conductive 
electrolyte is used. The spark is produced when the gap between the rod and the work‑
piece wall is tiny. The current is supplied in the centrifugal rod due to the pulse voltage. 
The potential difference is created between the rod and workpiece. The MR occurs 
due to the spark generated by the process. The TACAFM process needs EDM power 
supply and an EDM controller for the spark generation along with the CFAAFM [33].
10.4  MAGNETIC ABRASIVE FINISHING
10.4.1  Work principle
MAF involves the nano‑finishing of the work surfaces using carbonyl particles, abra‑
sives, and a rotating magnet [36]. The carbonyl and the abrasive particles are sintered, 
mechanically alloyed, plasma atomized, or loose abrasives. Sometimes machining 
fluids are added for cooling and lubrication and for temporary binding when using 
loose magnetic abrasives [6, 37, 38]. A rotating electromagnetic field is applied to the 
magnetic abrasives, which results in the formation of an electromagnetic brush of 
FIGURE 10.8  Electrochemical force assisted abrasive flow machining process.

201
Precision finishing innovations
carbonyl particle media [35, 39]. This brush drives the workpiece and results in the 
surface finishing process (Figures 10.9 and 10.10).
10.4.2  Variants and hybridization in MAF
MAF as shown in Figure 10.11 is a highly versatile precision machining process 
that offers various adaptations and hybridizations to meet specific surface finishing 
needs [40–42]. One variant is bonded MAF [43], where abrasive particles are affixed 
to a carrier medium, creating uniform abrasive action suitable for flat or contoured 
surfaces. In contrast, unbonded MAF suspends abrasive particles in a magnetic fluid 
(MF), allowing for intricate geometries and complex workpiece shapes [44]. The 
choice between permanent magnets and electromagnets for generating the magnetic 
field has distinct advantages. Permanent magnets offer simplicity, while electromag‑
nets provide precise control over field strength and distribution.
Introducing mechanical vibrations in vibration assisted MAF enhances the mate‑
rial removal efficiency by dislodging debris from abrasive particles and the work‑
piece surface [45]. Ultrasonic assisted MAF combines ultrasonic vibrations with the 
magnetic field, further boosting MRRs (shown in Figure 10.12) and overall finishing 
performance [43]. MAF can be combined with other processes in a hybrid approach, 
including chemical etching and electrochemical assisted finishing. In chemical etch‑
ing, abrasive particles are combined with chemical agents to enable controlled mate‑
rial removal, while electrochemical assisted MAF combines ECM with MAF to 
achieve controlled material removal and superior surface finish [40].
FIGURE 10.9  Schematic diagram of the MAF process [35].
FIGURE 10.10  Schematic diagram of the MAF process.

202
Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
These hybrid approaches can be seamlessly integrated into both bonded and 
unbonded MAF setups, resulting in several advantages such as increased MRRs, 
reduced tool wear, and enhanced surface quality. By incorporating these diverse 
techniques, MAF can be customized to meet the specific requirements of various 
industries, ensuring impeccable surface quality, precise dimensional accuracy, and 
compliance with stringent finishing standards.
Addressing the efficiency challenge, particularly with high‑hardness materi‑
als like nickel‑based alloys, is the realm of electrolytic‑magnetic abrasive finish‑
ing (E‑MAF) [46]. E‑MAF combines the advantages of electrolytic machining and 
MAF to enhance efficiency [47]. Electrolysis plays a critical role in E‑MAF by induc‑
ing anodic dissolution on the workpiece’s surface, forming a passivation film with 
lower hardness than the substrate. MAF subsequently removes this film, reducing 
the grinding difficulty. Liu et al. [46] introduced a tool for E‑MAF, emphasizing 
the benefits of ECM based on anodic dissolution, such as high MRRs and minimal 
tool wear. However, ensuring that the electrolyte reaches the working area remains a 
challenge in E‑MAF, necessitating careful consideration in tool design.
10.5  MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL FINISHING
10.5.1  Work principle
MRF is a precision finishing method that leverages a MR fluid to attain exceptional 
surface quality and precise geometric accuracy [11, 12]. This process hinges on the 
application of a magnetic field to manipulate the behavior of the MR fluid, which 
comprises a carrier fluid, magnetizable particles, and abrasive particles. When a 
magnetic field is introduced, the magnetizable particles within the MR fluid align 
themselves along the field lines, as illustrated in Figure 10.15(c), leading to a sig‑
nificant increase in the fluid’s viscosity. This phenomenon is known as the Bingham 
effect, and transforms the MR fluid into a semi‑solid state, enabling it to behave 
as a precise and controlled abrasive media [48–50]. During MRF, the workpiece is 
brought into contact with the MR fluid. As the workpiece and fluid interact, relative 
motion ensues. The stiffened MR fluid adapts to the shape of the workpiece, allow‑
ing abrasive particles to gently remove material through a combination of mechani‑
cal abrasion and, potentially, chemical interactions [51]. The process parameters, 
including magnetic field strength, rotational speed, and finishing time, are carefully 
adjusted to achieve the desired MRR and surface roughness.
MRF excels in finishing complex, curved, and high‑value surfaces with sub‑micron 
precision. It is widely used in applications like optics, semiconductors, and aerospace 
components, where surface quality and dimensional accuracy are critical. MRF’s 
unique ability to adapt to intricate geometries and the controlled removal of mate‑
rial make it a powerful tool for achieving exceptional surface finishes and meeting 
stringent industry requirements.
10.5.2  Variants and hybridization in MRF
MRF, a cutting‑edge precision machining process, exhibits remarkable versatility 
through a variety of variants and hybridizations that harness its unique properties 

203
Precision finishing innovations
to achieve specialized surface finishing outcomes. These innovative approaches 
broaden MRF’s scope and enhance its effectiveness in meeting specific requirements.
One variant, “Ball End MRF,” employs a ball‑ended tool interacting with the 
MR fluid and workpiece under a magnetic field [53]. This configuration enables effi‑
cient and controlled material removal, proving especially advantageous on curved or 
intricate surfaces. The ball end ensures uniform abrasion, making it ideal for achiev‑
ing consistent finishes on complex geometries. “Magnetorheological Abrasive Flow 
Machining (MRAFM)” seamlessly merges MRF principles with AFM [54, 55]. The 
MR fluid, combined with abrasive particles, is propelled through intricate internal 
passages of a workpiece. The magnetic field governs the abrasive‑laden MR fluid, 
resulting in precise material removal within convoluted channels and passages [19]. 
The integration of “Chemical Etching in MRF” takes a hybrid approach by incor‑
porating chemical agents into the MR fluid [56]. The magnetic field disperses the 
chemical agents uniformly, enhancing material removal through both abrasive and 
chemical actions. This synergistic combination enables controlled material removal 
FIGURE  10.11  Schematic diagram of material removal mechanism. (a) Polishing zone 
when the polishing head is stationary; (b) polishing zone when the polishing head is rotating;

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
and heightened surface quality, which is particularly advantageous for materials 
susceptible to chemical reactions. Furthermore, mixing electrochemical in MRF, 
ties ECM with MRF [57]. The magnetic field influences electrolyte distribution, 
augmenting material dissolution alongside abrasion. This hybridization allows for 
selective material removal, improved surface integrity, and the flexibility inherent 
to MRF. “Ultrasonic assisted MRF” introduces ultrasonic vibrations to the MRF 
process. These vibrations facilitate the movement of abrasive particles across the 
workpiece, reducing friction and enhancing material removal efficiency. The combi‑
nation of ultrasonic vibrations and the magnetic field enhances process effectiveness, 
leading to superior surface finishes and reduced machining times.
These variants and hybridizations empower MRF to cater to an array of specific 
applications. By integrating MRF with other processes, engineers and manufacturers 
can attain intricate finishes, selective material removal, and superior surface quality 
across diverse workpiece geometries and materials. These adaptations underscore 
MRF’s adaptability and potential to address evolving industry demands for preci‑
sion, efficiency, and quality in surface finishing, establishing it as a pivotal player 
in modern machining practices. Figure 10.13 shows hybrids of the MRF and AFM 
process, which is magnetorheological AFM.
10.5.3  Abrasive media and its preparation techniques
Abrasives play a pivotal role in surface finishing, especially when they are car‑
ried and supported by a media particle. Media itself is instrumental in facilitating 
abrasive action and transporting the removed material, thereby enhancing the abra‑
sion process. Generally, media in abrasive‑based finishing serve two fundamental 
purposes. First, they act as a holder for abrasive particles, enabling them to exert 
FIGURE 10.13  Schematic of magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing (MRAFF) [54].

Precision finishing innovations
abrasion on the workpiece surface. Second, they function as a medium for transport‑
ing the removed material. Over time, the development of media has progressed rap‑
idly, with new properties emerging based on chemical composition and the types of 
abrasives used. In many cases, media is a blend of polymer gel and abrasives in AFM 
FIGURE 10.14  (a) Sintered [59]; (b) electroless composite [60]; (c) (i) by Ahmad et al. [35]; 
(ii) by Li Wenhui et al. [61]; (iii) magnetic lines of steel grits in the silicone gel [62]; (iv) 
condition of MR fluid without magnetic field; (v) with magnetic field and (vi) side view [41].

processes [4, 19]. In contrast, when employed in MAF processes, it typically consists 
of carbonyl particles, which influence the media’s magnetic characteristics, thereby 
accelerating the finishing processes [6, 36, 58].
Rheology is the study of how materials deform under mechanical loading, 
encompassing aspects like yield stress, relaxation time, compliance, and viscosity. 
Viscosity plays a pivotal role in media as abrasive particles are retained. However, 
during machining, the heat generated can reduce media viscosity, impacting its abil‑
ity to hold abrasives [63]. MR fluids are a category of magnetic field‑controllable 
fluids whose rheological behavior depends on the strength of an applied magnetic 
field. Rheological properties, such as viscosity and shear stress, typically vary with 
factors such as chemical composition and temperature [64, 65]. Figure 10.14 pres‑
ents various abrasives used in MAF and MRF. Plasma spraying involves subjecting 
gases like argon or hydrogen to a powerful electric arc, resulting in the generation of 
high‑temperature plasma. This intense heat energy is directed onto a substrate con‑
taining magnetic abrasives, leading to the formation of magnetic abrasive particles 
[8, 66]. These developments in media and their rheological properties significantly 
contribute to more effective and controlled surface finishing processes, especially in 
applications like AFM and MAF.
Abrasive media used in AFM is often a semi‑solid mixture comprising abrasive 
particles and a viscoelastic gel. Figure  10.15(a) shows making of CNT‑based and 
simple abrasive media for AFM developed by Ali et al. [32]. The use of this type 
of media typically involves multiple finishing passes and results in improved abra‑
sion processes. Viscoelastic magnetic particles are the primary constituents of a mag‑
netic slurry [67]. For example, Dixit et al. (2020) developed a hydrogel‑based abrasive 
media for AFM of polymers using components like xanthan gum, locust bean gum, 
fumed silica, water, and abrasives. Their study revealed that media viscosity is high at 
low shear rates but decreases as shear rates increase, exhibiting shear‑­thinning behav‑
ior [68], as shown in Figure 10.15(b). Slurries are also utilized in AFM, with variations 
depending on the specific application, such as the use of iron powder in magnetic 
applications, potassium iodide in ECM, or kerosene in TACAFM processes [32].
Shear‑thickening abrasive slurry is a type of dilatant fluid where the viscos‑
ity generally increases as the shear rate increases. This viscosity rise leads to the 
cross‑linking and bonding of media particles with carbonyl and abrasive par‑
ticles. Typically, this type of slurry consists of carbonyl and SiC particles and is 
used in shear‑thickening MAF processes [49, 69, 70]. The system’s composition 
includes magnetic nanoparticles, a carrying liquid, and surfactants, as illustrated in 
Figure 10.2. Magnetic nanoparticles serve as the source of magnetism within the MF. 
Surfactants are adsorbed onto the surfaces of these magnetic nanoparticles to prevent 
their aggregation in a free state. These surfactant‑coated magnetic nanoparticles are 
suspended within the carrying fluid, giving the MF its fluidity.
As depicted in Figure 10.15(c), when the applied magnetic field strength remains 
below a certain critical value (Hc,n), the magnetic nanoparticles in the MF remain 
evenly dispersed within the base fluid. However, when the magnetic field strength 
surpasses Hc,n, the nanoparticles within the MF tend to aggregate or align themselves 
into chains along the magnetic field direction. Eventually, the relative magnetic per‑
meability (RI) saturates at a specific magnetic field strength, and further increases in 

207

magnetic force do not impact it [71]. In a study conducted by Fan et al. in 2020, they 
prepared a finishing media by combining shear‑thickening fluids (STFs), carbonyl 
iron particles, and SiC particles. They used polyethylene glycol (PEG) with a molar 
mass of 200 g/mol as the base fluid. Fumed silica, with primary particle sizes of 
50 nm, was directly dispersed into PEG 200. This mixture underwent mechanical 
blending for 60 minutes at 3000 rpm and a temperature of 80°C, controlled by an oil 
bath. Rheological tests were conducted on the STFs at concentrations of 15 wt% and 
20 wt% using a rotational rheometer (MCR 302, Germany) at 25°C. Figure 10.15(d) 
illustrates the relationship between viscosity and shear rate. It’s worth noting that 
FIGURE  10.15  (a) CNT‑based media for AFM; (b) hydrogel‑based media for AFM; (c) 
states of MF nanoparticles under various magnetic field strengths; (d) rheological curves of 
two solids contains SEM images of finishing media [69].

Nanofinishing of Materials for Advanced Industrial Applications
higher concentration STFs exhibited both higher initial viscosity and maximum vis‑
cosity, with values reaching 310.6 Pa s and 3070.6 Pa s, respectively [69].
10.6  SIMULATION AND MODELING
Mathematical and numerical modeling techniques are pivotal in understanding and 
enhancing the performance of advanced finishing processes like MAF, MRF, and 
AFM. In MAF, mathematical models predict MRRs by considering factors such as 
abrasive particle properties, contact pressure, and sliding distance. Simultaneously, 
numerical simulations, notably finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid 
dynamics (CFD), provide in‑depth insights into the intricate interactions between 
magnetic fields, abrasive particles, and workpiece materials. These simulations help 
optimize process parameters to achieve desired MRRs and surface finishes.
In MRF and MAF, mathematical models account for parameters like magnetic 
field strength and abrasive concentration, while numerical simulations examine 
abrasive particle behavior within magnetic abrasives or MR fluids. In the realm of 
advanced finishing methods, MRR models which take some factors such as viscosity 
and flow rates into account are essential. Researchers employ sophisticated simula‑
tion methods like FEA and smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to capture the 
intricate dynamics of fluids and interactions with materials. These modeling and 
simulation techniques are crucial for creating accurate predictive models, which, in 
turn, play a pivotal role in enhancing MRR and achieving better surface roughness.
Many researchers rely on foundational models as the building blocks for predict‑
ing MRR and surface roughness in processes like MAF, MRF, and AFM.
	
i.	Classical Preston equation (for MRR):
The classical Preston equation, which is commonly employed for describing 
the MRR in abrasive‑based processes, posits that MRR has a linear relationship 
with both polishing pressure (P) and relative velocity (V), as depicted in Eq. 
(10.1). This relationship stems from the notion that when abrasives are subjected 
to a polishing pressure and moved relative to the substrate surface, they create 
plow grooves on the surface. These grooves are formed because of the abrasives 
being pressed into the substrate to a specific depth, and they are essential for 
facilitating the continuous polishing process, where a multitude of abrasives 
collectively contribute to achieving the final material removal [72, 73].

ii.	Elasto‑plastic deformation model (MRR):
In processes like MAF, understanding the workpiece’s deformation 
behavior under applied forces is crucial. Elasto‑plastic deformation models, 

209
Precision finishing innovations
like the Johnson‑Cook model, predict how materials deform and eventually 
fail under loading conditions, contributing to MRR modeling [74, 75].
	 iii.	Empirical roughness models (surface roughness):
Empirical models, such as the empirical Ra model, are often used to predict 
surface roughness. They relate surface roughness (Ra) to factors like abra‑
sive particle size, concentration, and process parameters. These models can be 
adapted for surface roughness predictions in various finishing processes. For 
example:
	
f




	 (10.2)
	
iv.	Fluid flow models (for surface roughness):
For processes like AFM, modeling the behavior of the abrasive medium 
is fundamental. Fluid flow models, including the Navier‑Stokes equations, 
describe the movement of the abrasive medium within the workpiece. By 
considering factors like viscosity and flow rate, these models can predict sur‑
face roughness. See various viscosity models in Table 10.2. The mathematical 
modeling and computation in case of AFM has been done based on pressure 
variation and Coriolis effect on the workpiece produced due to simultaneous 
rotation and extrusion of the media within the workpiece [76, 77].
	
v.	Magnetic field models (MAF and MRF):
In MAF and MRF, understanding the magnetic field’s impact on abrasive 
particles is essential. Magnetic field models describe the distribution and 
strength of the magnetic field within the processing area. These models can be 
used to predict how magnetic forces influence abrasive particle movement and, 
consequently, material removal and surface quality. The intensity of the mag‑
netic field H is a gradient of the magnetic scalar potential φ and is expressed in 
two subsequent equations as:
	
ϕ
= −∇
H

materials is not constant and varies with the magnetic field. It implies that 
Eq. 10.4 is non‑linear in nature.

10.7  APPLICATION AND LIMITATION OF PROCESSES
The abrasive‑based finishing finds its application in major domains of manufactur‑
ing. The process of AFM is used for finishing of intrinsic and hard‑to‑reach surfaces 
while MAF is used in the nano‑finishing of the surfaces [84], [85]. The process finds 
its major application in the biomedical, aerospace, cosmetics, and ancillary industries. 
The AFM finds its core application in the finishing of microchannels (MEMs) and the 
finishing of confocal channels formed by the EDM, LBM, and EBM processes [24, 
33, 55, 86]. Abrasive‑based finishing is majorly finding applications in the finishing of 
additively manufactured products made by SLM and 3D printing. The advantage of 
MAF is that it can be applicable on any surface as it does not require the workpiece to 
be conductive, which are major limitations of TACAFM processes [24]. MAF plays a 
prominent role in the finishing of semiconductor devices, defense equipment, and vari‑
ous products in the cosmetic industry where surface finishing is required. Figure 10.16 
shows various applications of abrasive‑based finishing processes.

10.9  CONCLUSION
This review underscores the significance and potential of AFM, MAF, and MRF 
within contemporary manufacturing. AFM finds diverse applications in automotive, 
industrial, aerospace, and biomedical sectors, particularly for intricate profiles on 
both internal and external surfaces. MAF introduces superior surface quality for 
nonferrous materials like brass, though its efficiency decreases with mild steel and 
iron‑containing materials. The hybrid AFM approach emerges as a solution to tradi‑
tional AFM limitations, enhancing performance without compromising on material 
removal parameters. Despite advancements, room for AFM development persists, 
focused on achieving enhanced polish and cost‑effectiveness. MAF parameters, nota‑
bly working gap and rotational speed, influence MRRs and surface roughness, espe‑
cially for non‑magnetic stainless steel. In MRF, research navigates challenges such 
as magnetic particle dispersion and settling. Optimization of MR fluids is pursued for 
efficacy across materials. A deeper understanding of material removal mechanisms 
and numerical models is vital for MRF evolution. Composite MRF techniques prom‑
ise elevated finishing quality, demanding exploration for scalability.
These methods, AFM, MAF, and MRF, tackle challenges across industries, con‑
tributing to precision, efficiency, and adaptability in modern manufacturing. Research 
and innovation can redefine surface finishes, empowering industries to meet quality, 
performance, and sustainability demands in modern production.
