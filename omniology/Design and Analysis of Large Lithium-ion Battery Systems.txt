Preface
Battery development is hampered by the lack of cross-disciplinary communication 
between electrochemists, material scientists, and the mechanical and electrical en-
gineers responsible for scaling up basic electrochemical cells to large systems. Until 
recently, lithium-ion batteries have been used in small-size applications, either as 
individual cells in cell phones and laptops or as small modules in power tools and 
other consumer electronics applications. Over the last decade, the battery market 
has significantly expanded to include applications that demand thousands of times 
the energy content typical of the traditional small-size batteries: the electrical grid 
and automobiles are but two applications that will drive the proliferation of electri-
cal energy storage into the future.
This book is intended to serve as an introductory text that provides a solid 
understanding of the multiple facets of battery engineering. For systems-oriented 
engineers, this text demystifies electrochemistry; for the electrochemist, this text 
introduces topics that must be addressed for scale-up, including developing model-
based design and control platforms; for the analyst, this text provides a jump-start 
on the basics of lithium-ion batteries and the challenges in deployment.
Chapters cover an introduction to the different types of batteries and where 
lithium-ion batteries fit in; fundamentals of electrochemistry, including sections 
on what criteria one must use and associated limitations in selecting the materials 
to build a lithium ion battery; design of thermal management systems for lithium 
ion batteries, from heat generation in a single-cell to design of cooling channels in 
a multicell module; a detailed account of the state of the art in prognosis methods 
for battery life; safety challenges faced when scaling up well-established chemistries 
to larger formats; and an overview of the wide range of applications with specific 
engineering examples on the technoeconomic evaluation of large-format lithium-
ion batteries used in automotive applications and system design for grid-storage 
applications.
The book targets readers from diverse backgrounds who would like to get on 
a fast track to understanding battery engineering within a few weeks and go be-
yond treating the battery as a black box in their line of work. Each chapter takes a 
hands-on approach based on the years of experience the authors have accumulated 
in this discipline, and provides relevant context, requisite theoretical background, 
experimental tools, and real-world examples. New methods are introduced for bat-
tery lifetime prediction that may be practically implemented in design optimization, 
warranty assessment, systems control, and other analyses. The chapter on battery

safety puts specific emphasis on large-format designs. The chapters on thermal 
management and applications provide detailed examples so readers can familiar-
ize themselves with the design calculations. Detailed case studies on systems-level 
analyses of vehicle batteries and grid storage have been included to enable readers 
to perform a technoeconomic analysis for a variety of real-world applications. We 
hope that readers will enjoy the broad introduction to the topic, the nuances in test-
ing, and the practical case studies as much as we did when we originally worked 
on each of these topics.

Types of Batteries
Batteries are devices that store energy chemically and deliver (and accept) energy 
electrically. There are two principal classifications of batteries: (1) primary batter-
ies, which can only deliver the stored energy once prior to disposal, and (2) second-
ary batteries, which can be cycled (discharged and recharged) many times before the 
end of a device’s useful life. This book only discusses the latter.
In a secondary battery, the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy 
and vice versa occurs via accepting electrons (reduction) or donating them (oxida-
tion). These reactions are generally referred to as redox reactions and happen both 
at the negative and positive electrodes. The terms anode is used in the battery com-
munity to refer to the negative electrode; and cathode to refer to the positive elec-
trode, and the voltage of the cell is defined as the difference between those of the 
cathode and anode.1 Note that these electrodes serve as both the site of energy con-
version and of energy storage. An electrolyte is included to support the transfer of 
ions between electrodes while preventing the flow of electrons between electrodes, 
which are instead routed external to the cell via current collectors, enabling them 
to perform work. Accordingly, the electrodes must be both good ion and electron 
conductors. Often a porous, electronically insulating separator is placed between 
the electrodes to maintain their physical separation as well. Figure 1.1 illustrates 
this typical construction along with the basic operational mechanisms of a battery. 
In many sections of this book lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are highlighted as the 
example for secondary batteries, although there are many different types of bat-
teries, incorporating different cell components (such as electrodes, charge carriers, 
and electrolytes), and construction that function on the same operating basis.
These principles are similar to that of fuel cells, which rely on redox reactions. Fuel 
cells, however, are most typically distinguished by the storage of energy in an exter-
nal fuel and oxidant. These reactants are continually pumped past the electrodes, 
which are relegated solely to the task of energy conversion and charge transfer. 
Electrochemical capacitors (often referred to as super- or ultracapacitors) are 
also similar to batteries. Electrochemical capacitors are classified into two types 
based on their charge storage mechanism: electric double-layer capacitors use car-
bon electrodes to store electrostatic charge, whereas pseudocapacitors employ a 
material such as a metal oxide that undergoes Faradaic redox reactions to enable 
1.	
This terminology is opposite to that used widely in the classical literature on electrochemical synthesis or 
electroplating, for example. The reader should exercise caution in interpreting these terms in light of this 
confusion.

the charge storage. The latter typically has significantly higher energy storage ca-
pabilities than the former, although both are much lower in energy and higher in 
power capability than batteries.
Generally speaking, batteries are best suited to applications that require the 
supply of rated power for 10 minutes to 10 hours. For shorter durations, battery 
performance becomes limited by the ability to deliver energy at high rate, and other 
solutions such as capacitors or flywheels become superior. For longer durations, 
often associated with very large amounts of stored energy (>1 MWh), the cost and 
size of the necessary battery installation becomes an issue. However, optimizing a 
battery for any given application requires looking at many variables, and battery 
performance can vary dramatically across different chemistries, so these are only 
rough guidelines.
Batteries find homes in many different applications. Lead acid batteries are 
ubiquitous in vehicular starting, lighting, and ignition (SLI) roles, as well as com-
mercial and industrial uninterruptible power supply (UPS) applications. As recently 
as 2010, nickel metal hydride batteries dominated the hybrid electrical vehicle mar-
ket, providing short-duration engine-off driving and the ability to recapture energy 
during braking in the Toyota Prius, Ford Escape Hybrid, and others. Lithium-ion 
batteries have become common place in consumer electronics, as they have enabled 
smaller and more powerful camcorders, laptop computers, cell phones, portable 
power tools, and more. At present these batteries are a popular topic as they try to 
find their way into roles powering fully electric vehicles and supporting our electric 
grid.
Figure 1.2 shows the relative performance in six key areas of four kinds of bat-
teries selected for their technological maturity and current and near-term relevance 
to major energy storage applications. It should be noted that terms like “metal-
hydride” or “lithium-ion” encompass many different chemistries with varying 
performances and levels of maturity within each category; the data plotted here 
represents merely an approximate average of capabilities. Similarly, each individual 
performance category may mask significant variations within each chemistry. For 
Figure 1.1  Generalized redox battery operation during discharge. When the charge-carrying ion 
is positively charged, it (or the electrolyte) flows from anode to cathode (right to left) across the 
separator.

example, the simple category “cycle life” does not by itself indicate the sensitiv-
ity of cycle life to the depth of discharge, temperature, rate, cycle frequency, and 
so forth, which for different conditions may alter the relative performance of one 
chemistry versus another. As such, Figure 1.2 was created in a best effort attempt 
to capture the general essence of relative battery performance in each of these cat-
egories. The plotted values have arbitrary but relative units and are scaled to the 
best performer in each category.
In the future, not only is it expected that these values will improve (especially 
so for Li-ion batteries), but other more promising chemistries may also enter the 
market. For example, batteries comprised of lithium metal anodes and either sulfur 
(S) or air-based cathodes are being explored for their potential to offer considerably 
increased energy content per unit weight (specific energy), which is of particular 
interest to mobile applications. Additionally, flow batteries may provide improved 
operational flexibility and long cycle life at minimal cost (which is of particular 
interest to stationary applications). Several battery technologies have been under 
investigation for decades, and yet still require significant improvements before they 
become broadly commercially viable.
1.1  Lead Acid Batteries
The lead acid battery consists of a lead dioxide cathode, a lead anode, and an aque-
ous sulfuric acid electrolyte. During discharge, each electrode is converted to lead 
sulfate, consuming sulfuric acid from the electrolyte. On charge, the lead sulfate is 
converted back to sulfuric acid, leaving a layer of lead dioxide on the cathode and 
metallic lead on the anode.
During the charging process, water in the electrolyte is broken down to hy-
drogen and oxygen. In a vented design, these gases escape into the atmosphere, 
requiring the periodic addition of water to the system. In sealed designs, the loss of

Types of Batteries
these gases is prevented and their conversion back to water is possible. This reduces 
maintenance requirements; however, when the battery is overcharged or charged 
at too high of a rate, the rate of gas generation can surpass that of recombination, 
introducing a risk of explosion.
Both valve-regulated gel and absorbed glass mat (AGM) designs thus operate 
under slight constant pressure, but take different approaches to mitigate the risk of 
pressure buildup. In the former, silica is added to the electrolyte to cause it to gel, 
while in the latter the electrolyte is suspended in a fiberglass mat. Both designs re-
duce or eliminate the risk of electrolyte leakage and offer improved safety by valve 
regulation of internal pressure, but at a slightly higher cost.
Lead acid is generally the lowest cost secondary battery chemistry on a dollar-
per-kilowatt-hour basis, but also exhibits low specific energy and relatively poor 
cycle life. In practice lead acid batteries only achieve specific energy of ~35 Wh/kg; 
comparatively, the highest energy Li-ion cells may achieve more than seven times 
that (~250 Wh/kg), approaching the theoretical maximum value, for the specific 
energy of the lead acid chemical reaction (252 Wh/kg).
The short cycle life of lead acid batteries, on the order of a few hundred cycles, 
is primarily attributed to corrosion and active material shedding of the electrode 
plates. Operation across a wide voltage window, also referred to as high depth 
of discharge (DOD) operation, intensifies both these issues, in part due to differ-
ence in densities of the reactants and products, throughout the cycle, resulting in 
shedding of the active material from the electrodes. During high rate operations to 
partially charge or discharge the battery, lead sulfate accumulation on the anode 
(sulfation) can be the primary cause of degradation. These processes are also sensi-
tive to high temperature, where the rule of thumb is a halving of battery life for 
every 8°C increase in temperature from the ambient.
The primary disadvantages of lead acid battery-chemistries are their poor en-
ergy density and short cycle life, as noted above. Marginal gains to specific energy 
can be achieved by improving the active material and grid design of the electrodes, 
but will always be limited by the chemistry’s relatively low theoretical boundaries. 
The replacement of the traditional lead anode with a carbon anode similar to that 
of an electrochemical capacitor may significantly increase cycle life, but to do so 
may require that the amount of lead in the cathode be increased several fold, thus 
raising the cost and mass of the cell. Another approach to improve cycle life is the 
so-called lead acid flow battery, in which lead is dissolved in an aqueous methane 
sulfonic acid electrolyte. This system differentiates itself from traditional flow bat-
teries discussed later via the use of just one electrolyte and thus avoids the need for 
troublesome electrolyte separators. If long deep-discharge cycle life can be proven 
and costs kept low, this technology may be promising for grid-based bulk electricity 
storage applications. But given its exceptionally low theoretical specific energy, it 
is unlikely that lead acid batteries will ever compete with high-energy chemistries 
such as Li-ion for large mobile applications, which are volume sensitive.
1.2  Nickel-Based Batteries
All nickel-based batteries are related by their use of a common nickel oxyhydroxide 
cathode and the potassium hydroxide (KOH) electrolyte. The differentiation of 

1.2  Nickel-Based Batteries

nickel chemistries is rooted in the anode. The original anode, cadmium, results in a 
battery with significantly improved energy density and cycle life over lead acid bat-
teries. Nickel-cadmium batteries have been challenged by the high cost and toxicity 
of cadmium (nickel-cadmium batteries have largely been banned in the European 
Union), leading to the rise of nickel metal hydride, and later, Li-ion chemistries.
A nickel-hydrogen cell is essentially a hybrid battery fuel cell, as gaseous, pres-
surized hydrogen is used as the anode active material. Designed and employed 
exclusively for aerospace applications, these cells can provide exceptionally long 
life along with other application-specific benefits, but their extremely high cost es-
sentially prevents their use in most other applications.
Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) systems were originally designed as a method 
of storing hydrogen within nickel hydrogen cells, although today these find use in 
hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and as a replacement for nickel-cadmium batteries. 
In this cell, a complex metal alloy is used to store hydrogen on the anode side, con-
sisting of a multitude of alloying agents to tune cell performance. Despite its poor 
low-temperature performance (below 0°C) and high self-discharge rate (up to 30% 
per month), this chemistry’s advantageous specific energy, cycle life, and high rate 
capability have driven the trend to replace nickel-cadmium batteries.
The use of metallic zinc as an anode against the nickel oxyhydroxide cathode 
increases cell voltage, capacity, and improves high rate performance. Furthermore, 
the relatively high abundance of zinc keeps costs lower than both nickel-cadmium 
and NiMH batteries. However, the nickel-zinc battery suffers the same drawbacks 
as other metallic anode systems. In such a system, zinc is plated at the anode during 
charge. This process can be highly nonuniform, leading to possible formation of 
metallic dendrites and swelling of the electrodes. Large volume-changes can cause 
mechanical stress in other cell components, leading to degraded performance. Im-
portantly, dendrites can create internal short circuits or the dendrite can separate 
from the anode, resulting in the loss of active material and thus irreversible capac-
ity loss.
Iron hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) has also been employed as an anode for nickel-based 
batteries but is in extremely limited use due to issues with pronounced hydrogen 
evolution during both charge and discharge.
Progress on nickel-cadmium, nickel-hydrogen, and nickel-iron batteries are 
severely limited by their toxicity, cost, and obscurity, respectively. NiMH, on the 
other hand, is commonly employed in HEVs such as the Toyota Prius and Ford 
Escape. Topics including improving cold temperature performance, reducing self-
discharge rates, and extending cycle life have been pursued. Cost is also an issue 
but is difficult to address through research and development due to the fact that 
economies of scale in production have already been achieved, and at present 35% 
of the cost of NiMH batteries is due to the cost of nickel alone.
Nickel-zinc batteries offer many improvements relative to NiMH, but they are 
currently limited by poor cycle life. Overcoming this obstacle requires mitigation 
of the zinc dissolution and plating problems. Also the relative abundance of zinc 
and nickel are similar, so if more zinc is employed for large-scale applications it will 
likely become more expensive.

Types of Batteries
1.3  Sodium Beta Batteries
Sodium beta batteries are rechargeable molten salt batteries that use molten sodium 
for the negative electrode and sodium ions for charge transport. There are two 
principal types of sodium beta batteries, differentiated by their cathodes: the first 
employs a liquid sulfur cathode, while the second utilizes a solid metal-chloride 
cathode. Both include a beta-alumina solid electrolyte (BASE) separating the cath-
ode and anode. This ceramic material offers ionic conductivity similar to that of 
typical aqueous electrolytes, but only at elevated temperature—thus, sodium beta 
batteries must typically operate in excess of 300°C.
1.3.1  Sodium Sulfur Batteries
Sodium sulfur batteries operate via the following reactions:
Anode: Na ↔ Na+ + e– 
Cathode: xS + 2e– ↔ Sx2–
Overall cell: xS + 2Na+ + 2e– ↔ Na2Sx
As noted previously, both the anode and cathode are in a liquid state when the 
battery is at its operating temperature. The solid BASE electrolyte allows the ef-
ficient transfer of sodium ions at high temperature; its impermeability to the liquid 
electrodes and minimal electrical conductivity supports minimal self-discharge and 
a near-perfect coulombic efficiency. An illustration of a typical sodium sulfur cell is 
shown in Figure 1.3.
Sodium sulfur batteries were first developed in the 1960s as rechargeable trac-
tion batteries for automotive applications, and they were attractive for their high 
specific energy exceeding 100 Wh/kg. Although they were never used in automo-
biles, they are currently employed in limited number for utility load-leveling appli-

cations. The chemistry’s long cycle life (up to 5,000 deep discharge cycles) and the 
applications’ relatively low power to energy ratio requirements encourage such use.
Issues with this chemistry generally revolve around the high temperature re-
quirements. Although the ~300°C operating point can be an advantage (given that 
reasonable changes in ambient temperature are unlikely to impact performance), it 
has a negative effect on longevity. First, the high temperature exacerbates the cor-
rosive nature of the electrodes. Second, the variances in coefficients of thermal ex-
pansion can lead to mechanical stresses that can damage seals and other cell com-
ponents, including the electrolyte separator, during freeze-thaw cycles. The fragile 
nature of the electrolyte is also a considerable concern, given that, were a breach 
to occur and the two liquid cathodes to mix, fire and explosion are possible. Thus, 
to minimize such risks, freeze-thaw cycles must be avoided, requiring either that 
the battery be insulated and operated in such a manner as to passively maintain 
cell temperature above its freezing point or continually be heated from an external 
source to ensure that this requirement is met.
1.3.2  Metal Chloride Batteries
Metal chloride variants of sodium sulfur batteries most commonly replace the liq-
uid sulfur cathode with a solid nickel chloride cathode (typically called the ZEBRA 
cell). Also, a secondary sodium chloroaluminate electrolyte is included to provide 
ionic conductivity between the solid cathode and BASE electrolyte. The reactions 
that take place in such a cell are provided below:
Anode: Na ↔ Na+ + e– 
Cathode: NiCl2 + 2Na+ + 2e- ↔ Ni + 2NaCl
Overall cell: NiCl2 + 2Na ↔ 2NaCl + Ni
Nickel chloride cathodes offer several advantages over sodium beta batteries: they 
operate at higher voltage, have an increased operational temperature range (due in 
part to the lower melting point of the secondary electrolyte), the cathode is slightly 
less corrosive, and cell construction is safer (handling of metallic sodium can be 
avoided). However, they are likely to offer a slightly reduced energy density.
Such sodium nickel chloride batteries have seen use in several electric vehicles, 
primarily at the demonstration level. However, their limited power to energy ratios 
and heating requirements, particularly when the vehicle is parked, are an impedi-
ment to broad-scale deployment in the automotive market.
1.3.3  Challenges and Future Work
The high operating temperature of sodium beta batteries is often touted as a ben-
efit, because when ancillary systems are in place to maintain the cells near 300°C, 
sensitivity to most environmental temperature exposure is nil. However, the princi-
pal shortcomings of this technology are also associated with the same requirement 
of high operating temperatures. This not only presents a problem with respect to 
safety, but also with efficiency (energy lost to cell heaters), convenience (start-up 
time), longevity (freeze-thaw cycles can also accelerate degradation), and reliability

Types of Batteries
(the coexistence of highly corrosive sodium metal and high temperatures can lead to 
electrode containment issues and other failure modes resulting from high resistivity 
of the corrosion products). Longevity and reliability still have room for marginal 
improvement via improved cell configurations and designs. There is little ability to 
improve safety, efficiency, and convenience with modest technological advances—
high-temperature operation is largely a matter of fact for these chemistries. New, 
low-temperature sodium-based chemistries are being researched, however, based 
on new cathodes and/or sodium ion conductors (e.g., replacing BASE electrolytes 
with NASICON™).
With respect to the most promising utility-related applications, cost is also a 
significant issue. Efforts are currently underway to develop stacked planar cell de-
signs that are expected to cut cell costs in half. This departure from the traditional 
tubular design has the ability to increase specific energy and power (the latter be-
ing a limiting factor for the use of these batteries in many applications), improve 
packing efficiency and modularity, and also presents the opportunity to address 
long-term corrosion issues. Such efforts will face sealing and material selection 
challenges.
Two other issues have impeded the use of sodium beta chemistries for mobile 
applications: low power and fragility. The former issue is largely driven by the cell 
configuration and low ionic conductivity of the solid electrolyte. The latter is also 
a property of the brittle ceramic beta alumina electrolyte, compounded by a com-
mon mismatch in coefficients of thermal expansion between this component and 
others within the battery. Thus, use of sodium sulfur cells in an application where 
exposure to vibration or shock is common (e.g., transportation applications), or 
under a business strategy where the battery is required to be occasionally relocated 
(as has been discussed for some utility transmission upgrade deferral applications) 
is typically impractical.
1.4  Flow Batteries
In a flow battery, energy is stored primarily in active materials dissolved into an 
electrolyte, which is stored externally and passed through the electrodes when the 
battery is charged or discharged. The electrodes are separated by an ion exchange 
membrane that also segregates the cathode and anode side electrolytes (referred to 
as catholyte and anolyte, respectively). There are two main classifications of flow 
batteries: redox and hybrid.
Note that per our original definition of batteries and fuel cells, flow batteries 
may often be classified as a regenerative fuel cell. However, due to the reversibility 
of the reaction and popular nomenclature, they are discussed here alongside sec-
ondary batteries. 
1.4.1  Redox Flow Batteries
In a redox flow battery, the active materials are at all times dissolved in the  
electrolyte. There are several different chemical compositions of redox flow batter-
ies, iron chromium being the first flow battery developed (by the National Aeronau-
tics and Space Administration (NASA)) and vanadium receiving the most attention. 

1.4  Flow Batteries 
9
A schematic of the most popularly used vanadium redox battery is shown in  
Figure 1.4.
The redox configuration offers several benefits to many of the nonflow and hy-
brid-flow batteries. First, the amount of energy storage available is limited only by 
the size of the tanks and the amount of electrolyte available. Accordingly, it is also 
possible to decouple the system’s energy and power capabilities, the latter being 
determined by the number and size of the electrodes. Additional benefits include 
the absence of a need for cell balancing (allowing a relatively simple construction 
of higher-voltage batteries) and the ability to mechanically recharge the system by 
replacing the electrolyte. The disadvantages generally lie with the complexity of 
the pumping, storage, and control systems, as well as the low specific energy and 
volumetric energy density (typically less than that of lead acid batteries).
1.4.2  Hybrid-Flow Batteries
In a hybrid flow battery, at least one of the active species is plated onto an electrode; 
thus, power and energy levels are coupled due to the ability of the electrode(s) to 
accommodate a finite amount of active material. Several chemistries have been in-
vestigated, zinc bromine being the most popular. This configuration benefits from 
the low cost of the electrolyte and a slightly improved energy density, but issues can 
arise with dendrite formation during zinc plating.
1.4.3  Challenges and Future Work
The low specific energy of flow battery systems is a major impediment to most mar-
kets, restricting this technology primarily to select stationary (mostly, electric util-
ity) applications. Here the low technological maturity level of the product will be 
a barrier—few flow batteries have been demonstrated to operate at the megawatt 
scale often desired by utilities, but the system’s flexibility and anticipated longevity 
and low cost are anticipated to be major benefits. To be successful in this market, 
Figure 1.4  Vanadium redox flow battery operating in the discharge mode.

Types of Batteries
efficiency will likely have to improve beyond present levels (~70%), reliability must 
increase to attain the acclaimed longevity, and maintenance requirements have to 
be minimized. Reliability and longevity are complicated by the use of toxic and cor-
rosive electrolytes, which pose significant challenges at the materials level for the 
hydraulic subsystems and the ion exchange membrane.
There are several pathways to improving flow battery performance and meet-
ing these needs. For one, improved systems design and manufacturing practices can 
go a long way toward improving reliability and making modest efficiency gains 
while keeping the costs low. Crucial to this will be advances in the manufacturing 
of the ion transfer membrane—a major cost contributor and a likely failure point 
due to frequent leaks. New redox couples that offer higher efficiency, improved 
specific energy, and/or utilize more cost-effective or less toxic materials are also 
the subject of recent investigations. These include hydrogen-halogen, hydrogen-
bromine, iron-chromium, and others.
1.5  Li-Ion Batteries
Li-ion batteries are currently the batteries of choice for portable consumer elec-
tronic devices including cell phones, tablets, laptop computers, digital cameras, 
power tools, and toys, due primarily to their durability, high specific energy (100 to 
200 Wh/kg), and ability to operate at reasonably high power. Recently, Li-ion bat-
teries have begun to enter the automotive market as power packs for hybrid and full 
electric vehicles. In addition to the high specific energy, the automotive market also 
benefits from this chemistry’s high power, efficiency, and long cycle life capability. 
As the automotive market drives the expansion of Li-ion production, these batteries 
may also enter stationary service as well, facilitating the implementation of renew-
able energy technologies such as solar and wind. 
Li-ion batteries operate by shuttling Li+ ions to the anode host structure on 
charge, then by transporting the same ions across the porous separator via the 
electrolyte to the cathode host structure on discharge. The need to maintain charge 
balance at each electrode in turn drives a current through the external circuit to 
perform work, as seen in Figure 1.5. Like many other battery chemistries, lithium 
ion batteries require electrically and ionically conductive anodes and cathodes, and 
electrically insulative but ionically conductive electrolytes and separators. There 
are multiple combinations of cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes possible under the 
category of Li-ion cells, and several of these are aggressively being researched and 
developed to improve this battery technology. 
1.5.1  Lithium-Ion Cathodes
Three classes of cathodes prevail today, including layered transition-metal oxides, 
spinels, and olivines. Each structure has various advantages and disadvantages. 
Layered oxides typically offer the highest capacity but can suffer from cost and 
safety concerns. Spinels can achieve very high power density with fewer cost and 
safety penalties but can suffer from poor electronic conductivity and structural sta-

1.5  Li-Ion Batteries 
11
bility issues. Olivines, on the other hand, can offer exceptional safety and long life 
at low cost but sacrifice both capacity and voltage.
Lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) was the first layered oxide cathode material 
developed and introduced into the commercial market by Sony in the early 1990s 
and is the most common cathode chemistry in today’s Li-ion-powered consumer 
electronics devices. Originally paired with a hard carbon anode in a small cylindri-
cal consumer cell format, it offered a specific energy of 130 Wh/kg and good cycle 
life. Since then this cathode material has been paired with a graphite anode, where 
the specific energy can exceed 200 Wh/kg at the cell level when optimized for en-
ergy content. However, the cost and toxicity of cobalt have driven development 
of other layered oxide cathodes with reduced cobalt content. Most prominently 
nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) chemistries 
have since been developed, not only reducing cost but also improving performance 
based on energy content, power delivery, and longevity.
The largest drawbacks of the layered oxide cathodes are cost and safety. Cost is 
driven up by cobalt and nickel content. Safety concerns are driven by the evolution 
of oxygen under abusive conditions (typically high temperature, high voltage, and 
energy content, where reaction with the electrolyte or dissolution may occur). This 
process is not only extremely exothermic, but the typical electrolyte is flammable 
when combined with oxygen, leading to the risk of fire and explosion.  Although 
the newer NCA and NMC cathodes can offer slightly improved safety, they do not 
sufficiently mitigate the risk.
Spinels (typically lithium manganese oxide) offer further improvements in safe-
ty, their structures liberating lower amounts of oxygen and heat when operated

LiCoO2) as the battery is discharged.

Types of Batteries
under extreme conditions. In addition, the lack of cobalt and nickel, replaced by 
highly available manganese, significantly reduces cost, while the open structure 
for Li-ion intercalation allows for higher power and efficiency. The principal chal-
lenges are lower specific capacity relative to layered oxides and a tendency for 
manganese dissolution at high temperature, limiting longevity.
Olivines (typically lithium iron phosphate) offer even further improvements in 
safety. In some cases the iron phosphate cathode can be even less reactive than a 
graphite anode. The stability of this chemistry is further demonstrated by its excel-
lent cycle life. Like manganese, iron is cheap and plentiful in comparison to cobalt 
and nickel. However, the lithium holding capacity (which is measured as coulombs 
of lithium per gram of the host material, commonly reported as milliampere-hours 
per gram and referred to as the specific capacity of the host material) is reduced 
even below that of manganese spinel, and cell voltage is lower as well, resulting in 
a significant decrease in specific energy relative to the layered oxides. In addition, 
the rate capability is quite poor without leveraging nanoscale formations in the 
cathode to maximize the ratio of surface area to volume.
1.5.2  Lithium-Ion Anodes
Development has focused heavily on new cathode technologies over the past several 
years due to the fact that the common carbon-based anodes (e.g., graphite and hard 
carbon) are simultaneously less costly, more stable, and of higher specific capacity 
than their commercially available cathode counterparts. For example, the aver-
age capacity of commercial graphite is ~330 mAh/g, whereas the usable capacity 
of lithium cobalt oxide is only ~140 mAh/g. Thus the cathode is most often the 
capacity-limiting electrode, marginalizing cell level improvements resulting from 
increased anode capacity. However, improvements in anode performance still do 
yield gains at the cell level, and there exists a significant issue with current graphite 
anode technology—lithium plating.
When the potential of the anode becomes excessively low, most likely due to 
combinations of low temperature and high charge rate, Li-ions can plate out as me-
tallic lithium on the surface of the anode rather than intercalating within the anode. 
This leads to dendrite formation, which not only results in irreversible capacity loss 
(via the loss of active lithium), but also poses a threat of the dendrites creating a 
short circuit. This is a major safety concern, as heat generated from the internal 
short circuits may lead to the ignition of the flammable electrolyte and a possible 
explosion. These issues have long prevented the use of lithium metal as a potential 
contender as an anode; however, extensive efforts to stablize lithium metal anodes 
are currently underway.
Lithium titanate spinel structures have been offered as an alternative to graph-
ite, providing high stability by operating at a much higher voltage versus lithium 
than do carbon anodes, greatly reducing the chance of lithium plating and all but 
eliminating electrolyte reduction and the formation of the solid electrolyte interface 
(SEI) layer. Though the use of titanates improves safety, longevity, and efficiency, 
it also results in a significantly lower cell voltage. With a specific capacity that is 
about half that of graphite, a lithium titanate cell’s specific energy becomes signifi-
cantly compromised.

1.5  Li-Ion Batteries 
13
1.5.3  Li-Ion Electrolytes
The electrolyte commonly comprises a mixture of organic solvents such as an eth-
ylene carbonate, dimethyl carbonate, and propylene carbonate, which contain a 
dissolved lithium salt such as lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6). Regardless of 
the electrode couple, the electrolyte is often exposed to working voltages beyond 
its stability limits. For carbon anodes operating at a potential close to the plating of 
lithium, this causes the reduction of the electrolyte at the anode, building a protec-
tive coating known as the SEI layer. The SEI layer is typically formed during the first 
few charge cycles. Though this process leads to some degree of irreversible capacity 
loss through the consumption of charge-carrying Li-ions as well as negative effects 
on electrical and ionic transport properties, it is critical to the long-term stability of 
the cell as the SEI layer prevents further electrolyte reduction. Accordingly, tuning 
the electrolyte formulation to optimize the SEI layer is an actively pursued means to 
improve the long-term performance of many electrode couples (notably, however, 
this does not apply to lithium titanate anodes, which do not form an SEI layer due 
to their higher voltage versus lithium as mentioned previously).
The stability of the electrolyte is a significant safety issue. When cathodes are 
operated outside the stable electrolyte voltage window, their reaction with the elec-
trolyte leads to the evolution of oxygen and heat and possibly thermal runaway. 
This risk is typically exacerbated at higher temperatures. Further, most Li-ion elec-
trolytes are flammable when combined with oxygen and an ignition source. There 
are several options under development to avert such scenarios, including nonflam-
mable electrolyte additives, inorganic electrolytes, and solid or polymer electro-
lytes. Although the latter have promise for significant improvements to safety by 
eliminating concerns of electrolyte breakdown, leaking, and venting, they suffer 
from significantly low ionic conductivity. For this reason, solid state Li-ion batter-
ies have not penetrated the market in any significant quantity.
The electrolyte also plays an important role in low temperature performance. 
At low temperatures, typically below 0°C, the ionic transport properties of the elec-
trolyte suffer, which can drastically lower cell performance and efficiency. Electro-
lyte formulations can be fine-tuned to improve performance at low temperatures, 
but this may come with penalties at higher temperatures and/or negatively affect 
long-term degradation and safety.
1.5.4  Li-Ion Challenges and Future Work
Although Li-ion batteries have dominated commercial electronics markets and 
show promise for vehicular applications, safety remains an extremely important 
and challenging aspect, especially in the transportation sector. Improvements to 
cost, specific energy, cold temperature performance, and longevity also require at-
tention, but their importance varies by application. Progress toward each of these 
goals can be made via development of new cathodes, anodes, and electrolytes, as 
well as stabilizing additives and coatings. A significant number of research efforts in 
industry, national laboratories, and academia are presently devoted to these topics.
Safety is the foremost concern of many current and potential Li-ion markets, 
especially in light of the relatively high number of safety incidents pertaining to 
laptops, hybrid vehicles, and aircraft that have made the news. Although it is 

14 
������������������
Types of Batteries
important to keep in mind that the fractions of incidents that have occurred is 
extremely small in comparison to the quantity of batteries in use in the field, the 
level of hazard of a single incident (possible fire and explosion)—particularly in the 
case of large, manned battery installations such as automotive ones—merits this 
concern. Fortunately, there are multiple avenues from which to address Li-ion bat-
tery safety, all offering the capability to make significant improvements, including 
thermal management and cell management systems at the pack level, cell design 
and improved manufacturing quality at the cell level, and advanced cathode, an-
ode, and electrolytes at the component level. For example, electrode coatings that 
can stabilize the electrode-electrolyte interface, benefiting not only safety but also 
longevity, are currently under investigation. Inorganic electrolyte systems, still in 
need of further development, hold similar promise.
Cost is often the second largest limitation for Li-ion. In particular for large-
format (e.g., automotive) cells, manufacturing at a large scale is often cited as a 
likely pathway to reduce cost. To this end, $2.4 billion in American Recovery and 
Reinvestment (ARRA) funds were awarded in late 2009 to create a U.S. manu-
facturing base capable of supporting the annual production of 500,000 electric 
vehicles by 2015, targeting a 70% decrease in battery cost. Similar investments 
have been made by governments across the globe to kick-start large-format Li-ion 
battery manufacturing. A large portion of such scale-manufacturing-induced cost 
reductions are attributable to the commoditization of materials, which is reported 
to make up 60% of current cell costs. The materials alone cost (anode, cathode, 
and electrolyte) have been shown to make up approximately 10% of pack level 
costs. Thus, development of anodes and cathodes incorporating lower-cost materi-
als (such as iron rather than cobalt) is another valid route worth pursuing. 
Performance, in particular low temperature response, long-term degradation, 
and specific energy, also show room for improvement, although in many cases it 
is already superior to competing technologies. It should be noted that long-term 
degradation and specific energy improvements, achievable via advanced cath-
odes, anodes, and electrode coatings, also have the potential to reduce the cost 
of Li-ion on a per-kilowatt-hour basis. Many of these avenues are currently being 
pursued, including higher voltage and often nanostructured electrodes. However, 
improvements to specific energy may come at the cost of longevity and/or safety. 
For example, high-voltage cathodes will certainly improve energy density but ne-
cessitate as-yet unidentified electrolytes stable at these high voltages. Alternatively, 
nanostructured electrodes can simultaneously offer multiple performance improve-
ments, but come with a much higher manufacturing cost.
New material chemistries are also being explored. On the anode side, some 
new metal oxide anode formulations (such as tin and titanium-based anodes) may 
offer improved capacity over today’s commonplace carbon-based anodes, but gen-
erally suffer a significant difference between charge and discharge voltage profiles 
(resulting in exceedingly poor efficiency). The employment of a silicon-based anode 
is under extensive study, as it has an extremely high theoretical specific capacity 
(4200 mAh/g) but is limited by volume expansion on the order of 400% dur-
ing lithium intercalation.  Such extreme volume expansion can lead to particle 
fracturing and loss of electronic conductivity, leading to high irreversible capacity 
loss and vastly reduced cycle life. Other possible anode materials including metal 
sulfides, phosphides, and Li-alloy materials such as tin (Sn) and germanium (Ge) 

1.6  Lithium-Sulfur Batteries 
15
offer similar gains in capacity but also suffer from large volume expansion. Current 
research efforts are focused on the development of both nanostructured materials 
to mitigate the effect of volume expansion as well as protective coatings that will 
minimize the irreversible first-cycle capacity loss as well as provide for better adhe-
sion during volume expansion.
The highest capacity cathode candidates include layered-layered electrodes 
with Li2MnO3 and LiMO2 (M = Ni,Co,Mn) components, layered-spinel electrodes 
comprised of Li2MnO3 and LiMn2O4, and layered-layered-spinel electrodes com-
prised of Li2MnO3, LiMO2, and LiM′2O4 (M′ = Ni, Mn) components. These cath-
ode materials deliver a capacity in excess of 200 mAh/g and are currently at the 
edge of high-capacity cathode technologies. However,because the potential cathode 
technologies do not come close to the capacity of possible anodes such as silicon 
(Si), it may be necessary to consider Li-sulfur or Li-air cathodes that are discussed 
in the next few sections.
1.6  Lithium-Sulfur Batteries
Lithium-sulfur technology currently under development promises extremely high 
specific energy (theoretical specific energy is ~2500 Wh/kg). Although it is not 
nearly ready for commercial production, primarily due to cycle life and safety con-
cerns, it has demonstrated its basic performance and energy density potential in 
niche applications. The basic cell is comprised of a sulfur cathode, generally sup-
ported with a porous carbon framework, a liquid electrolyte, and a lithium metal 
anode. The following reactions occur upon discharge of a Li-S battery as Li+ dis-
solves in the electrolyte:
2Li + S8 ↔ Li2S8 (soluble)
2Li + Li2S8 ↔ 2Li2S4 (soluble)
2Li + Li2S4 ↔ 2Li2S2 (insoluble)
2Li + Li2S2 ↔ 2Li2S (insoluble) 
Long-chain polysulfides are formed in the first step and then dissolve in the elec-
trolyte. Further reduction of the long-chain polysulfide results in reduced soluble 
polysulfides. Finally, solid Li2S2 and Li2S are formed in the last step. Although Li-S 
batteries have a high theoretical capacity, the charge reaction is only achieved via 
electrochemical cleavage and reformation of the sulfur-sulfur bonds in the cathode. 
Thus the chemistry of Li-S batteries is quite complex.
1.6.1  Lithium-Sulfur Cathodes
Lithium-sulfur cathodes offer the potential for extremely high energy density due 
in part to the low molecular weight of sulfur. The low cost and high availability 
of sulfur also aid the cost effectiveness and sustainability of manufacturing these 
batteries. However, because the electrical conductivity of sulfur is low, it is gener-
ally necessary to employ porous carbon supports, the weight of which lowers the 
theoretical specific energy. 

16 
������������������
Types of Batteries
The chemistry also includes a natural sulfur shuttle mechanism that can pro-
tect the cell from overcharge. However, tuning the shuttle for optimal performance 
is complex and it can also promote high self-discharge rates exceeding 10% per 
month. In addition, the multiple intermediary sulfides formed throughout the 
charge discharge process make stabilizing the cathode a difficult task, creating lon-
gevity concerns. One particular challenge is preventing insoluble products includ-
ing Li2S2 and Li2S from blocking the porous network of the Li-sulfur cathode. 
1.6.2  Lithium-Sulfur Anode
The use of lithium metal as a negative electrode provides extremely high capacity 
(3860 mAh/g) but comes with many challenges to safety and long-term operation. 
The anode is utilized by plating lithium on the anode surface during charge and 
dissolving lithium on discharge as mentioned above. This plating process involves 
a significant volume change with cycling on the order of 300% (compared to ap-
proximately 10% for graphitic anodes), which can induce mechanical stress across 
all components of the cell and introduce or exacerbate other failure mechanisms. 
Furthermore, this process can be highly nonuniform, leading to possible dendrite 
formation that causes the loss of active material and thus irreversible capacity loss 
under the best of operating conditions. Dendritic growth is a risk as with all metal-
lic anodes, which can lead to an internal short circuit and possible fire (like Li-ion 
batteries, the electrolyte employed in lithium-sulfur batteries is flammable). How-
ever, when combined with the sulfur cathode, the anode surface and newly formed 
dendrites can become coated by layers of soluble polysulfide chains. Although the 
increase in inactive lithium and sulfur does lead to irreversible capacity loss and the 
layering does decrease conductivity, it also reduces the reactivity of the metallic lith-
ium and at least partially suppresses additional dendrite growth. Further, to serve as 
a reliable protective coating, control over the thickness of the sulfide layers must be 
achieved. Finally, lithium metal is extremely reactive when exposed to water (H2O), 
presenting a safety concern, especially when the cell container is breached.
1.6.3  Challenges and Future Work
The promise of a practical specific energy that is at least twice that of Li-ion bat-
teries is enticing to many applications; however, much work remains to be done to 
improve lithium-sulfur batteries while addressing capacity fade, self-discharge, and 
safety. There are many present ongoing efforts to address these matters, such as new 
cathode structures reliant on different porous carbons and possibly doped or func-
tionalized porous carbons to stabilize the polysulfide products. Surface coatings for 
increased sulfur utilization, stability, and conductivity, as well as new electrolytes 
formulated for increased conductivity and shuttle control are also under investiga-
tion. Some recent results are encouraging, and future research may find solutions to 
many of these problems. But it is important to keep in mind that the achievable vol-
umetric energy may eventually be nearly close to that of traditional Li-ion batteries. 
Thus, where space is at a premium, as is the case with many mobile applications, 
lithium-sulfur batteries may not offer the level of superior performance over the 
more mature Li-ion technologies as the differences in specific energy may suggest.

1.7  Metal-Air Batteries

1.7  Metal-Air Batteries
Metal-air batteries have the potential to simultaneously have the highest energy 
density and the lowest cost of energy storage for many applications. In a metal-air 
battery, oxygen (ideally supplied freely from the atmosphere) serves as the cathode, 
combined with a pure metallic anode (see Figure 1.6 for a schematic of a metal-air 
battery). On discharge, oxygen is combined with the metallic anode to create metal 
oxides; when charging, these metal oxides are reduced to plate metal back at the 
anode. Several metals have been considered for such systems, including magnesium, 
iron, aluminum, zinc, and lithium. Only the latter two have shown any affinity for 
electrical recharging, and thus the discussion here in will be focused accordingly.
Of note is a variant of metal-air systems; namely, metal-water systems. Here 
the air cathode is replaced with water. Many of the issues are the same as those of 
metal-air systems, but the cell voltage is significantly lower and their applications 
are generally limited; hence, they are omitted from the discussion hereafter.
1.7.1  Zinc-Air Batteries
Zinc-air systems have a theoretical specific energy greater than 3 kWh/kg (when 
the mass of oxygen is not included) and thus present an opportunity to greatly 
surpass the energy storage capability of Li-ion batteries. Further, their reliance on a 
highly abundant and low-cost material—zinc—offers improved sustainability and 
cost effectiveness. 
Historically, zinc-air batteries have been plagued by poor reversibility and 
long-term performance. This is due to issues concerning zinc plating (volumetric 
expansion and dendrite formation, common to almost all metal anodes) and the 
evaporation of the electrolyte (when used in an open system).

1.7.2  Lithium-Air Batteries
With a theoretical specific energy exceeding 11 kWh/kg (excluding oxygen), lith-
ium-air is perhaps the most likely candidate battery to come close to matching the 
specific energy of fossil fuels and thus is of considerable interest to automotive and 
other mobile applications. However, the air cathode generally requires a porous 
carbon support. Including the weight of this support structure (~70% porosity), 
the air cathode, and the electrolyte, the theoretical energy density is then reduced 
to 2.8 kWh/kg—a far cry from the oft cited 11 kWh/kg, but still far surpassing 
today’s state-of-the-art LiCoO2/graphite-based lithium ion technology (0.25 kWh/
kg). Unfortunately lithium-air technology is still in its infancy, and faces several 
substantial challenges.
For instance, similar to the lithium-sulfur technology, inclusion of a metallic 
lithium anode comes with considerable volume change during cycling, irregular 
plating that can lead to dendrite formation, and a high reactivity with H2O. How-
ever, unlike lithium sulfur, there is at present no mechanism to suppress dendrite 
reactivity, increasing the chance of irreversible capacity loss and short-circuit for-
mation. Furthermore, if an open system is to be used to take advantage of freely 
available atmospheric oxygen, the lithium anode is at risk of exposure to atmo-
spheric H2O, especially in environments where humidity is high.
Several other factors are also of concern. At the anode interface, the metal ox-
ides created on discharge can create an insulating layer. Additional oxides can build 
up with repeated cycling, resulting in considerable capacity loss and reductions in 
rate capability. The kinetics of both the charge and discharge reactions, of course, 
impedes the commercial utility of such systems. Not only does this factor limit the 
achievable specific power, but also results in gradually diminishing efficiencies. Fi-
nally, exposure to the atmosphere can cause electrolyte evaporation over time, as 
well as expose the system to impurities that can react with lithium metal and create 
effects that remain largely unanalyzed at this stage.
The air cathode also poses very significant challenges. The reactions at the air 
cathode are shown below:
2Li+ + 2e– + O2(g) ↔ Li2O2(s); Eo = 3.1V (equilibrium)
4Li+ + 4e– + O2(g) ↔ 2Li2O(s); Eo = 2.91V (equilibrium)
Of these, the formation of the peroxide (Li2O2) results in a barrier layer formed 
on the cathode side. This drives the voltage profiles of the Li-air battery, both dur-
ing discharge and charge, to be far from the equilibrium potential (~3V): implying 
that we need to supply more energy during the charge process to store energy and 
are able to retrieve less energy than if the cell were to function at the equilibrium 
potential. The increase in the voltage gap is a significant barrier to Li-air batteries, 
as current organic electrolytes are not stable at the voltages encountered during op-
eration of the cell due to reactions occurring at the interface between the electrode 
and electrolyte.

1.7.3  Challenges and Future Work
The challenges with metal-air chemistries are significant, as discussed above. The 
core challenges lie with obstruction of the cathode or anode interface with the 
electrolyte, and those typical of metallic anodes (volume change and dimensional 
uniformity during recharge). Protection and stabilization of the anode is of par-
ticular importance where lithium is employed, as it not only represents a barrier 
to long-term performance, but also to safety. It is equally important to investigate 
methods to reduce the large gaps in voltage between the charge and discharge for 
the reactions at the air cathode. While it may be possible to catalyze this reaction 
such that the voltage barrier is not as extreme, the difference between the charge 
and discharge reactions may be due to thermodynamic constraints—and that will 
hinder any improvements proposed by research focused on improving the rate of 
the reactions.
Additional challenges include evaporation of the electrolyte and contamination 
when using air from the environment. The use of ionic and solid electrolytes has the 
potential to address dryout but typically degrade efficiency and increase the cost. 
Alternatively, these problems can be approached at the system level by the imple-
mentation of closed and/or filtered air systems. Once again, these will bring added 
cost, complexity, and mass.
Research on metal-air systems is a growing field. At least one company claims 
to have developed a saleable, rechargeable (up to ~100 cycles) zinc-air system, but 
much is yet to be learned regarding metal air performance before being successfully 
mass-marketed for consumer and utility applications. Certainly, the many possible 
solutions to the problems discussed above are yet to be fully explored. Experiment-
ing with other metals, such as iron, is also in progress and may also prove fruitful. 
Eventually a viable system may be achieved, but it appears unlikely that metal-air 
batteries will be widely successful in the near term.
1.8  Emerging Chemistries
Batteries are a lively topic of research at present given the possible transformative 
effects they could have on the transportation and energy industries; that is, if a 
battery can meet the necessary performance and cost targets to displace the largely 
fossil fuel based solutions presently employed. None of the commercialized tech-
nologies, and few publicly under development, have the potential to achieve all of 
these goals. In part, for these reasons, new battery chemistries are quite frequently 
proposed; and details regarding their technical challenges, present performance, 
and even basic function are often rigorously protected. In this section, several re-
cently proposed technologies are briefly mentioned. Where possible, their function, 
performance capabilities, and technical challenges are noted, although in general 
very little information is currently available.
1.8.1  Sodium-Ion Batteries
Sodium ion batteries function, in principle, like lithium ion batteries do—by shut-
tling positively charged ions between electrodes. Replacing lithium with sodium 

20 
������������������
Types of Batteries
could offer several benefits, however. First and foremost is the availability and low 
cost of sodium as compared to lithium. In addition, some researchers have pro-
posed the use of aqueous electrolytes with lower cell voltages—again reducing costs 
but also improving safety. The requisite reduction in energy density makes this tech-
nology more suited for stationary applications rather than for mobile ones.
Note that sodium batteries classified under this section differ from the afore-
mentioned sodium beta batteries via operation at ambient temperature, since they 
function via an intercalation mechanism of the sodium ions and do not require the 
anode to be molten.
1.8.2  Liquid Metal
A novel liquid-metal battery is also currently under development. The system is 
extremely simple: a liquid antimony anode is poured into a container first and 
then a liquid sodium-sulfide molten salt electrolyte is added, followed by a liquid 
magnesium cathode. The material densities are such that they naturally segregate 
to keep the cathode on top, the anode on bottom, and the electrolyte in-between, 
greatly simplifying the overall construction and minimizing manufacturing cost. On 
discharge the antimony and magnesium electrodes dissolve and combine to form 
magnesium antimonide in the electrolyte; on charge this species separates and the 
metals return to their respective electrodes. 
The previous sections outlined the state-of-the-art batteries and where the lith-
ium-ion technology is placed in terms of its energy and power capabilities. The 
following chapters elaborate on the underlying principles of designing a battery 
and commonly encountered issues and factors to be considered when finding an 
optimal construct suited for a specific application. Most of the examples utilize 
Li-ion batteries as the chemistry of choice, but the proposed solution invariably is 
independent of this restriction.

Electrical Performance
The operating principles of a battery are very similar to those of conventional en-
ergy sources such as a hydro turbine or compressed air. There are thermodynamic 
and kinetic limitations not very different from those that govern the combustion 
of the traditional fuel. There are also a few distinguishing factors that govern the 
operation of a battery. This chapter discusses the different aspects that determine 
the suitability of materials used to assemble a battery and the engineering aspects 
that go into functionalizing these materials. We begin with the description of a few 
technical terms often used in the community, introduce the mathematical frame-
work used to describe the phenomena that take place within the battery during 
charge and discharge, discuss the significance of these terms in building a cell, and 
conclude with a brief outline of the experiments used to make these assessments. 
The context-sensitive test procedures are deferred until the subsequent chapters that 
describe the specifics of the test parameters in more detail in relation to the target 
application. Although the principles described in this chapter are widely applicable 
for different kinds of batteries in general, the examples provided herein cater to the 
choice of Li-ion batteries.
2.1  Thermodynamics Inside a Battery
A simple experiment from high school physics is quite effective in understanding 
how a battery works. Figure 2.1(a) shows a set of glass tubes of different shapes. 
The first part of the experiment consists of filling each tube with the same amount 
of water (e.g., 100 ml) and measuring the height of the air column from the top 
of the tube to the water surface after adding every milliliter. The plots of the air-
column height versus volume of water for the different shapes of glass tubes are 
shown in Figure 2.1(b).
Two observations from this experiment are relevant for a battery engineer:
1.	 Even though the volume of water inside each container is the same, the 
height of the water column is different for the different tubes, and as a 
result, the potential energy at the base of each column is different.
2.	 The shape of the curves in Figure 2.1(b) is a function of the properties of 
the container (in this case, the geometry). Thus, the potential energy avail-
able at any given instant is a function of not just the volume of water, but 
the shape of the container as well.

Figure 2.1  Illustration of the concept of potential. The isolated glass tubes of different shapes shown in 
Figure 2.1(a) all contain the same volume of water despite the difference in the height of the air columns in 
arbitrary units (shown in Figure 2.1(b)).  When the tubes with water at different potential energies are con-
nected, the energy is leveled across the different shapes.  Similarly, the positive and negative electrodes of a 
battery contain the ions at different electrochemical potentials (see Figure 2.2), and by pairing them up suit-
ably, one can make a battery with the desired energy storage and delivery characteristics.

2.1  Thermodynamics Inside a Battery 
23
Similarly, battery materials differ in their ability to store and deliver energy: for 
the same weight of material, the amount of charge you can store within a battery 
is a strong characteristic of the ability of the material to store charges. This ability 
is termed the electrochemical potential. Like Gibb’s free energy, the electrochemical 
potential is a measure of useful work that can be extracted from a material under 
ideal conditions.
The electrochemical potential is often measured as the voltage at which one can 
exchange the working ions from the host material under ideal conditions. Just like 
we measured the height of the water inside the different columns from the base of 
the containers, we need a reference value to measure the electrochemical potential 
of the material. For example, in lithium batteries, this reference is the potential at 
which Li-ions are converted into metallic lithium. So, at 0V versus Li/Li+, lithium 
metal forms Li-ions spontaneously—and no useful work can be extracted from 
these ions if the material stores them at 0V, since the ions are in equilibrium with 
lithium metal. This situation is analogous to having 100 ml of water spread infini-
tesimally thin across the surface of a table—the potential energy of such a film, 
with respect to the surface of the table, is zero. Thus, a piece of metallic lithium 
inserted in a container with Li-ions under identical conditions as the battery mate-
rial under consideration is termed the reference electrode, and all voltage measure-
ments made when this electrode is grounded are listed as being measured with ref-
erence to the Li/Li+ electrode. When the voltage measurement is carried out under 
controlled conditions—constant temperature, pressure, and composition (lithium 
content) of the material—this voltage is termed the equilibrium voltage. However, 
it is time-consuming to establish equilibrium conditions. For practical purposes, 
the equilibrium voltage is approximated with the value measured when the changes 
to the system are not appreciable: for instance, the temperature of the material is 
controlled to as much as a tenth of a degree celsius, the pressure is assumed to be 
constant since the volume changes for these solids and liquids are negligible, and 
the distribution of lithium in the material is assumed to be uniform if the duration 
over which the maximum amount of lithium that can be inserted (or extracted) is 
set to some high value (typically 30 hours or longer). This approximate measure of 
the voltage as a function of the lithium content at a given temperature and pressure 
is called the open circuit potential (OCP) of the material.
Just like the height of the water columns, the OCP of the material changes 
depending on the quantity of Li-ions and the energy levels at which the material 
stores these ions. The shape of the voltage curve, as a function of the lithium con-
tent in the different materials is shown in Figure 2.2. The relationship between the 
OCP and composition is governed by Gibb’s phase rule [1], which states that the 
number of properties of a material that can change independently (f) is given by:
	
2
f
c
p
=
−
+
	
(2.1)
where c is the number of chemical species (in our case, this number is 2: one for 
lithium and one for the material holding it) and p is the number of phases. Tempera-
ture and pressure are two of the independent properties; depending on whether the 
material can hold all the lithium without undergoing a phase transformation, the 
remaining degrees of freedom are either one or zero. For example, iron phosphate 
forms two different phases depending on how much lithium it contains. Thus, the 

24 
����������������������
Electrical Performance
only independent properties, as read from (2.1) are the temperature and pressure 
and the chemical potential can be calculated as a function of all the other properties 
in this system; as seen in Figure 2.2, the OCP of iron phosphate is indeed indepen-
dent of the composition. On the other hand, cobalt oxide behaves like one homog-
enous material (i.e., p = 1), and thus, the number of degrees of freedom, besides 
temperature and pressure, for this material is one (i.e., f = 3). The chemical potential 
as represented by the OCP is the additional property that can be varied as a func-
tion of lithium content independent of temperature and pressure. This relationship 
between the OCP and lithium content is one of the fundamental properties govern-
ing the choice of materials suitable for use in batteries. Let us explore this idea a bit 
further, with a specific example of a lithium ion cell.
2.2  Assembling a Li-Ion Cell
A Li-ion cell comprises of a negative electrode (anode) where electrons are accepted 
from the external electrical circuit when the battery is charged and a positive elec-
trode (cathode) that can supply the positively charged Li+ ions during charge so 
that the system can remain charge neutral. When the battery is discharged, the 
Li-ions move back into the cathode and the electrons are released to the external 
circuit from the anode (resulting in current flow across the load from the positive 
to the negative electrode).
When assembling a Li-ion cell, the anode and the cathode must be chosen such 
that each electrode can perform the intended function, as described above, with-
out thermodynamic barriers. This is where relationship between OCP and lithium 
content comes in handy: for the negative electrode containing a certain amount of 
Figure 2.2  Open circuit potential (OCP) values for different cathode materials commonly used in 
Li-ion batteries. (See the analogy between Figure 2.1(b) showing the potential energy of identical 
volumes of water inside columns of different shapes and Figure 2.2 showing the electrochemical 
potential of different electrodes containing identical amounts of Li-ions.)

2.2  Assembling a Li-Ion Cell 
25
Li-ions to accept more ions, one must set its voltage with respect to Li/Li+ reference 
electrode to be lower than its OCP at the same composition. This is accomplished 
by supplying the battery with electrons from the external circuit, and in turn, shift-
ing the anode from its equilibrium state to a new, energized state. In an attempt to 
reach equilibrium at the new voltage set point, the anode takes in more Li-ions to 
bring its composition as close to a value that the electrode would have, if its OCP 
were equal to the new set point. The same way, when Li-ions must be released from 
the cathode, one has to raise the voltage to a new set point, at which the electrode 
would spontaneously release the ions to reach a new equilibrium between its volt-
age and composition. The reverse process works during discharge of the battery—
the voltage values at each electrode shift in the directions opposite to that during 
charge when the Li-ions are moved back from the anode into the cathode. The 
continuous change in the voltage of the individual electrodes is illustrated in Figure 
2.3(a); the voltage of the cell is calculated as the difference between those of the 
cathode and the anode when the ions move from the solution into the electrodes or 
vice versa during a charge or discharge, as is illustrated in Figure 2.3(b).
The movement of the ions is accomplished either by supplying additional in-
centive to the battery in the form of current or by adjusting the OCP of the individ-
ual electrodes as to release or attract excess charges to the electrodes. In either case, 
the amount of working ions at any given instance in an electrode during a charge 
or discharge process is related to the amount of charge supplied to the battery (or 
equivalently, the current flow created due to the shift in the OCP of the individual 
electrodes) by Faraday’s law: one Faraday of charge (96,487 C) is required to pro-
duce (or consume) one molecular weight of ions (also called one mole of ions). In 
the case of Li-ions, the molecular weight is 6.94 g. Thus, if we charge a Li-ion cell 
using 1 ampere of current for 1 hour, ideally, we would have extracted 258.9 mg of 
Li-ions from the cathode. Thus, by varying the amount of current supplied or used 
from the battery, or by specifying a power demand from the external circuit, the 
Li-ions can be moved in and out of the electrodes at varying rates, in accordance 
with Faraday’s laws.
In order for the Li-ions to be shuttled efficiently between the two electrodes, 
the driving force to extract these ions from the anode must be paired up with that 
used to insert them into the cathode. In other words, the two electrodes must work 
in sync, with the energetics aligned such that they are additive in favor of trans-
porting lithium in the intended direction and the driving force must be maximized. 
Correspondingly, the voltage difference between the two electrodes is maximized. 
On the anode side of the cell, the lowest voltage one can get to without disrupting 
the flow of ions is 0V versus Li/Li+, at which point, the energetics favor the plating 
of lithium rather than movement of Li+ ions. The first choice for the anode material 
is thus a sheet of metallic lithium. Practical difficulties, as discussed in Chapter 1, 
prevent the use of lithium metal as the anode: upon repeated plating and dissolu-
tion of lithium, the morphology and mechanical properties of the anode changes 
drastically resulting in poor cyclability and often safety concerns due to dendrites 
of lithium that is plated back, inducing a short circuit within the cell. Other mate-
rials that can be used as anodes usually host lithium inside a solid matrix. Differ-
ent types of carbons, tin oxide, titanium dioxide, and silicon are some examples. 
Once again, it is the voltage at which lithium can be inserted or released, and the 

26 
����������������������
Electrical Performance
thermodynamic ability to store electrons from the external circuit that makes these 
materials good choices as anodes for lithium ion batteries.
On the cathode side, transition metal oxides are the most popular choices for 
Li-ion batteries, mainly because these materials are durable at very high voltages 
Figure 2.3�  Change in OCPs of the individual electrodes during operation of a Li-ion battery (a), and the 
corresponding cell voltage (b) during charge and discharge.

for prolonged periods of time [2]. Some of these oxides are stable up to 4.6 V 
versus Li/Li+. In general, the higher the voltage at which lithium can be inserted or 
extracted, the greater the driving force for the ions to be shuttled. Also, the objec-
tive is to store as much energy by moving as few ions around as possible. One way 
to accomplish this is by employing materials that store the ions at high voltages: 
since energy stored equals voltage times the amount of charge, if the voltage values 
are higher, the amount of charge that has to be stored to accomplish a set target for 
energy to be stored can be lowered. Thus, in this case, transition metal oxides are 
good candidates. Another way to accomplish the same goal is to use multivalent 
ions, which can compensate for the transfer of multiple electrons for every ion that 
is transported. Magnesium, manganese, lead, and vanadium are some of the ions 
considered in the past for this purpose; however, it is difficult to shuttle heavier ions 
and the efficiency drops quickly due to transport limitations. So, we use the Li-ions 
to transfer the charge from one electrode to the other; but then take advantage of 
the multiple valence of the transition metals (e.g., Mn2+ and Mn3+) inside the host 
matrix of the cathode material to maximize the amount of energy stored for a given 
amount of the cathode material. It is worth noting that lithium batteries operate by 
inserting and extracting ions within electrodes without disrupting the structure of 
the host lattice, in contrast to alkaline or lead acid batteries, which rely on plating 
and dissolution of the charge carrying species. The process of insertion of a guest 
ion into the host matrix without disrupting its structure is called intercalation.
There must be an ionic conductor available to transfer the Li-ions from one 
electrode to the other. This conductive layer must simultaneously be capable of 
blocking the electrons from being short-circuited within the cell instead of being 
routed across the external load when called for. This role is played by the electro-
lyte, which is essentially a lithium salt dissolved in a suitable solvent. The choice 
of electrolytes suitable for use in Li-ion batteries is extremely challenging because 
the electrolyte must be stable at the extreme voltages (0–6V) it encounters on both 
the anode as well as at the cathode. The nonavailability of suitable electrolytes has 
been one challenge that has restricted the usable voltage range of Li-ion batteries 
to 0–4.5 V. LiPF6 dissolved in organic carbonates is a popular choice of electrolyte. 
Other solvents like tetrahydrofuran (THF), lactones, and some ethers have been 
proposed, but they are usually used as additives to address specific problems (e.g., 
to improve stability of the electrolyte at the anode surface or to improve conductiv-
ity of the ions at low temperatures).
Simplistically, a battery looks like two blocks of electrodes with compatible 
properties as described above, immersed in a bath of electrolyte. However, in a 
practical system, there are transport limitations in addition to thermodynamic bar-
riers described above. The ions have to be moved from their designated positions 
within the host matrices to the electrode-electrolyte interface, where they are trans-
ferred by means of one or more electrochemical reactions into the electrolyte, and 
subsequently carried in the electrolyte phase and the reverse process takes place at 
the other electrode. In order to maximize the efficiency of the cell, the transport 
of ions must be kept to a minimum. This task is accomplished by placing the elec-
trodes as close to one another as possible without making actual physical contact 
(which would induce an electronic short circuit). A porous polymer film about 10 
to 30 µm thick is used as a spacer between the electrodes. This film is called the 
separator and is usually made of a polymer that is chemically compatible with the 

28 
����������������������
Electrical Performance
electrolyte (e.g., polyethylene or polypropylene membranes are used in the case of 
Li-ion batteries). In some cell designs, the separator is also designed to conduct 
ions, and thus, the role of the separator and the electrolyte are integrated. These 
cells are referred to as polymer cells. In general, the transport of ions within the host 
matrix is about two to four orders of magnitude slower than moving them in the 
liquid electrolyte. In order to take advantage of this fact, the electrodes are usually 
designed as porous films soaked in the electrolyte. They are assembled by coating 
a thin (~100 µm for Li-ion batteries versus ~100 mils for metal hydride batteries) 
porous layer of the corresponding active material (carbon, transition metal oxide, 
etc.) on to a thin metal foil or mesh, which distributes the electrons (or collect the 
current) across the electrode to ensure a uniform utilization of the active mate-
rial. The current collectors themselves are chosen by their ability to resist chemical 
and electrochemical reactions under the environment they operate in. For example, 
copper is stable in the operating voltage window that the anode of a Li-ion cell 
is exposed to, and is used as the current collector on the anode, whereas it  will 
oxidize at high voltages on the cathode side to form soluble copper oxide. Hence, 
an aluminum foil works well at the cathode.  A detailed discussion on the choice 
of materials can be found in any of the standard lithium battery handbooks [1, 2].
The cell components described above can be packaged in different ways: stack-
ing alternating layers of anodes and cathodes with a separator in between is one 
popular approach, especially with large-format Li-ion cells. Winding long coils of 
the electrodes on to a central core is another. This assembly of the electrodes and 
separator is termed a jellyroll. The jellyroll is then packaged into a flexible pouch 
or a metal casing, from which electrical connections to the rest of the circuitry is 
facilitated using metallic tabs that are attached to the electrodes.
2.3  Voltage Dynamics during Charge/Discharge
Designing a battery for a specific application can considerably benefit from a good 
understanding of how the different components within the cell work under the 
stipulated operating conditions and how the electrical response is closely connected 
to the thermal, mechanical, and chemical behavior of the battery materials. Mathe-
matical models often simplify such analyses and provide a basis for methodic design 
of the materials as well as engineering aspects. This section provides an overview of 
the various mathematical frameworks used to describe the electrical response of a 
Li-ion cell and lays the foundation for the more elaborate discussions of the thermal 
and chemical aspects that follow in subsequent chapters.
A transition metal oxide (say, LiCoO2) exhibits an OCP of ~ 2.5V versus Li/
Li+ when it contains the maximum amount of lithium it can practically hold. As 
described earlier, this corresponds to the fully discharged state of the battery. As 
and when the cell is charged, lithium is gradually removed from the cathode, and 
the OCP rises toward 4.2 to 4.5V. On the other hand, at the anode (carbon, to be 
specific), the OCP of the electrode corresponds to ~ 2V versus Li/Li+ when there is 
no lithium present. When lithium is inserted the voltage gradually drops until the 
electrode is fully saturated with lithium, at which point the ions begin to plate out 
as metallic lithium and the OCP of the anode drops to 0V versus Li/Li+. The mea-
sured voltage of the cell, at any given instant, is the difference between the voltage 

2.4  Circuit Diagram for a Cell 
29
at the cathode and that at the anode. Thus, at the beginning of the first charge, the 
cell voltage is around 500 mV. At the end of charge, the cell voltage reaches the 4.2 
to 4.5V range (depending on the choice of the cathode material). Similarly, during 
discharge, the cell voltage starts to drop from this value to around 2V. The anode, 
after cycling lithium across for the first few times, is seasoned to a blend of lithium 
in carbon, which has a characteristic voltage versus composition signal that equili-
brates to an OCP of 300 mV at full discharge. These break-in cycles that stabilize 
the interface between the anode and the electrolyte are referred to as cell formation 
cycles. The interfacial film that helps prevent rapid degradation of the electrolyte 
at such harsh voltage conditions is referred to as the solid electrolyte interface (SEI) 
layer. Some cyclable lithium is lost in the process of cell formation, but usually 
the cell manufacturers compensate for this effect by including an excess of lithium 
when building the cell.
2.4  Circuit Diagram for a Cell
It is common practice for electrical engineers to represent circuit elements such as 
diodes and operational amplifiers (op amps) as a combination of resistors, induc-
tors, and capacitors. This process helps one to understand performance limitations 
and to make design calculations. Such a representation of a cell is shown in Figure 
2.4. As previously shown in Figure 2.2, each electrode has a characteristic OCP 
versus composition relationship. The cell voltage at open circuit (V0) is then calcu-
lated as the difference between the OCP of the cathode and that of the anode (Uc 
and Ua, respectively):

Thus, the open circuit voltage of the lithium ion cell at any given instant, for ex-
ample, is a function of the amount of lithium inside each electrode. A resistor Rs is 
connected in series with the voltage source to represent all contact resistances and 
ohmic impedance to the flow of charge across the cell. At the interface between the 
electrode and the electrolyte, the charge is either transferred to the ions, across the 
Figure 2.4  Circuit diagram for a cell showing a popularly used equivalent circuit to model electrical 
performance of the cell for different types of chemistries. The parameters Rs, Cdl, and Rct are usually 
obtained by fitting the circuit equation (see (2.9)) to the current-voltage response measured from 
the cell. Figure 2.5 shows a comparison between the simulation results using parameters from Table 
2.1 and experimental data.

interface into the liquid phase, or tends to accumulate across a double layer, more 
like a capacitor. To represent the possibility of these two physical phenomena a 
circuit branch containing a resistor (Rct) and a capacitor (Cdl) in a parallel branch is 
added on to the ohmic part. The resistance Rct represents the barrier at the interface 
to the charge transfer reaction, and the capacitance Cdl corresponds to the buildup 
of charges at the interfacial double layer (with electrons on the electrode side and 
the ions in the solution side of the interface to compensate for the charge-balance).
Understanding the dynamics inside the cell is then reduced to solving Kirch-
hoff’s current and voltage equations for the circuit. The voltage drop across Rs 
follows Ohm’s law:

(2.3)
where I is the net current flow across the cell, which in turn branches out into I1 
and I2 across Rct and Cdl, respectively. Kirchhoff’s node-and-loop rules relate the 
currents that flow across the different branches of the circuit and the voltage across 
each branch. Thus we have:

The rate of charge buildup in the capacitor equals the current that flows through 
the capacitor. This is expressed mathematically as follows:

Kirchhoff’s loop rule states that the voltage across any branch is the sum of the 
voltage drop along the branch and that the sum of all currents that enter or exit a

the following equations:

This model equation now relates the input current to the change in cell voltage. The 
parameter Q0 refers to the total capacity (which, in turn is related to the energy) 
available in the cell. The change in cell capacity during a charge or discharge is cal-
culated by integrating the current passed as follows:

Similar results can be obtained for constant power loads by replacing the cur-
rent (I) in (2.8) with P/VCell where P is the power demand set by the external load. 
Voltage versus capacity data for various input signals are used to calibrate the 
circuit elements (Rs, Rct, etc.) under the operating conditions of interest. A lookup 
table can then be constructed to characterize the performance of the cell under 
load. Figure 2.5 shows a comparison of model versus experimental data for the 
parameter set shown in Table 2.1 for a Li-ion cell.
The circuit-diagram approach to characterize a battery is simplistic, and the 
upfront investment in terms of time and resources used to obtain a model is mini-
mal. This approach is also extremely effective in system design, wherein engineers 
of various disciplines treat the battery as a black box with a set of defined electri-
cal characteristics. These models are readily scalable to design of battery packs in 
which several cells are arranged in series-parallel configurations to meet the load 
requirements. Once a set of calibrated components is established using the above 
procedure, commercial software used in circuit programming (e.g., SPICETM) can 
be readily adapted to include Li-ion batteries as part of the circuit components. The 
downside alludes to oversimplification of the different physical phenomena taking 
place inside the cell. For example, when designing large-format Li-ion cells, the use 
of a single resistance term or capacitance term to characterize the charge-transfer 
reaction taking place across the entire electrode surface is not sufficiently accurate 
to capture the localized response: among other limitations, the distribution of the 
current across the entire surface of the electrode is not uniform, different parts 
within the cell tend to heat up and dissipate heat at different rates, some parts of 
the electrode are overutilized while others are underutilized. In such instances, one 
must modify the circuit diagram to accommodate for such additional complica-
tions involving the cell design and the choice of material parameters. Making such 
ad hoc modifications on a case-by-case basis can be tedious, and the experimental 
data set used to obtain the relevant calibration curves is usually large.
2.5  Electrochemical Models for Cell Design
A methodic formulation that will help extend the performance metrics observed 
under one set of operating conditions at one scale or a given design of cells to a 
different set of situations using known laws of physics has been suggested as the

alternate choice to battery design. For example, by measuring the porosity of the 
electrode, its electronic conductivity and the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte as 
a function of temperature, this process eliminates the need to measure the circuit 
resistances for electrodes of different porosities at different temperatures if one can 
formulate a relationship between these independent parameters and the conductiv-
ity of the composite electrode. Such phenomenological models are often referred to 
as physics-based representations of Li-ion cells. For example, a mechanistic model 
for the Ohm’s law equation shown in (2.3) can be built by describing the resistance 
parameter Rs in terms of physically measurable properties. If we choose Rs to rep-
resent the potential drop across the copper bus bar, the properties of interest are 
the electronic conductivity of the metal (Cu), the cross-sectional area (ACu), and the 
length of the bus bar (sCu). Each of these properties is characteristic of the bus bar. 
The resistance Rs,Cu is related to these parameters as follows:
	
s

and hence (2.3) can be rewritten as:

(2.12)
Note that (2.12) can be used for a cable of any given dimension made up of any 
material whose electronic conductivity is known. However, the use of (2.3) requires 
that we measure the resistance parameter Rs every time the bus bar is replaced. 
Also, the use of a mechanistic model enables one to identify better materials (e.g., 
a bus bar with higher electronic conductivity) suited for an application. We now 
proceed to develop such mechanistic models to describe the other physical processes 
commonly encountered within a Li-ion battery, such as the movement of electrons 
within the electrodes and movement of ions in the electrolyte, chemical, and elec-
trochemical reactions.
2.5.1  Charge Transport within the Electrode by Electrons
The total voltage across a cell (VCell) can be approximated as the sum of the poten-
tial drop across the electrodes that across the electrolytes, the electrolyte, and other 
losses arising from contact resistances. In the following sections the subscript 1 will 
be used to denote the properties/variables in the electrodes and 2 to represent the 
corresponding variables in the electrolyte. We already considered voltage drop due 
to the flow of electrons across metal cables in (2.12). In order to be able to represent 
properties such as conductivity as a function of the local environment we use the 
differential formulation; that is, we use the derivative forms of the equations. Thus, 
the voltage drop across the electrodes due to the movement of electrons is now 
measured per unit length (

where i1 is the current per unit area (called the current density) and ˆ j
s  is the com-
posite electronic conductivity of the electrode material within electrode j (j = n 
refers to the negative electrode or the anode and j = p refers to the positive electrode 
or the cathode). Usually a battery electrode is comprised of several components 
such as solid solutions of different metals or composites of active material that hosts 
the Li-ions, binders that hold the particles of the active material together, and other 
components. The composite conductivity corrects for these additional components 
within the electrode, and is calculated as the sum of the conductivities of the indi-
vidual components, scaled in proportion to the composition of the electrode:

Here xk are the mole fractions of the individual components k that constitute the 
electrode and σk refer to the electronic conductivities of the pure components (e.g., 
σCu represents the conductivity of metallic copper). Alternatively, ˆ j
s  can be mea-
sured directly after the electrode is assembled, but the utility of the model developed 
with this parameter will be limited to the specific electrode design used to measure 
the conductivity value.
2.5.2  Charge Transport in the Electrolyte by Ions
A unique feature of electrochemical devices is the transport of the current by ions. 
Once the current moves past the electrodes and undergoes the electrochemical reac-
tion, the charge transport from one electrode to another is facilitated by ions. This 
transport of charge by the movement of ions is more complicated than the current-
carrying mechanism by movement of electrons. Usually, there are several species of 
ions present in the electrolyte. The total current carried by the electrolyte (i2) across 
a unit normal area is the sum of the currents carried by each of the ionic species k:
	
2
k
k
i
i
= ∑	
(2.15)
The current carried by each species ik is proportional to how fast the ion can move 
in the electrolyte. The rate of movement of the ions is termed its flux (Nk) and is 
related to the current by [5]:
	
k
k
k

(2.17)

The proportionality factor F in (2.16) is the Faraday’s constant (96487C), which 
is the amount of charge carried by each mole of the ion. The concentration of an 
electrolyte is a readily measurable quantity (the parameters in the mechanistic equa-
tions do not necessarily have to be measured within the battery); the velocity of 
an ion is proportional to the charge it carries (zk) and the potential gradient in the 
electrolyte (

), which is the electrical driving force for the ion to move:

The proportionality constant in (2.18) is called the mobility (uk) of the ion and is 
obtained from equivalent conductance measurements. The negative sign indicates 
that the ions move from a region of higher potential to lower. Equations (2.15) to 
(2.18) can be rearranged to obtain [5]:

As stated in the previous section, (2.20) relates the properties of the component 
ions (k) to the conductivity of the electrolyte within electrode j. Hence, knowing the 
composition of the electrolyte, one can model the movement of ions in the electro-
lyte. Alternatively, one can experimentally measure the electrical conductivity ( ˆ j
κ ) 
in (2.20); but limitations similar to those following (2.14) apply.
In deriving (2.19) an implicit assumption that the concentration of the elec-
trolyte is uniform throughout the cell precluded the effects of concentration gradi-
ents present within the cell. However, this assumption is not strictly valid in large-
format Li-ion cells and can be easily relaxed by incorporating flux terms arising 
from concentration differences using Fick’s laws of diffusion. Equation (2.17) then 
becomes:

with solving for just the concentration of Li-ions (i.e., k = Li+). More sophisticated 
models that consider the mutual interaction of multiple ions within the electrolyte 
and the effects of temperature on the conductivity of the electrolyte are available 
[5].

2.5.3  Charge Transfer between the Electrodes and the Electrolyte
As noted above, charge is carried within the electrode by electrons and in the elec-
trolyte by ions. The transfer of charge from the ions to the electrons and vice versa 
is similar to any chemical reaction. The rate expression for a chemical reaction 
states that how fast a chemical species appears or disappears is related to the avail-
ability of the individual species participating in the reaction at the electrode surface; 
the proportionality constant in this relationship is the kinetic rate-constant that 
determines how fast or slow the reaction takes place:
	
( )
k
j
dc

dt =
	
(2.22)
where ck is the species of interest and the function f relates the concentration of all 
the participating species, cj. Standard textbooks on reaction engineering [6] discuss 
the procedure to solve these expressions and how to use these models in reactor 
design.
In the case of Li-ion batteries, there is an electrochemical reaction involved at 
the electrode/electrolyte interface: in addition to the availability of the individual 
chemical species at the electrode surface, the difference in voltage between the elec-
trode surface and the electrolyte at the vicinity of the interface (i.e., φ 1 – φ2 at the 
interface) can be used as another knob to control the rate of the reaction. The rate 
expression (2.22) should be modified accordingly to reflect this change. The rate 
of reaction depends exponentially on the available energy (which in this case is the 
voltage difference scaled to suitable units). The most commonly used expression to 
capture this dependence is the Butler-Volmer equation:

where αa,jF/RT is a scaling factor. For a step-by-step derivation of (2.23), see [7]. 
It is often convenient to express the concentrations and potentials in the Butler-
Volmer expression with respect to reference values; for example, the potentials are 
referenced to the OCP of the respective electrode and the concentrations to values 
at which properties such as conductivities and diffusivities are known. Equation

and is termed the exchange current density. The term (φ1,j – φ2,j – Uj) represents the 
departure of the energy barrier across the interface from equilibrium conditions and 
is popularly referred to as the overpotential (ηj). The higher the value of the over-
potential, the greater is the deviation in the voltage response of the cell from ideal 
behavior. For example, at higher rates of discharge, the voltage drop encountered 
in a battery is more than that seen at lower discharge currents. This is because as 
the current increases, the rate of transport of ions does not increase linearly (as one 
would expect out of ohmic conductors). The concentration (and dilution) of ions 
across specific portions of the cell gives rise to some overpotential, which in turn 
induces the additional voltage drop. Similarly in battery chemistries that merely 
involve plating of the working ions (e.g., lead-acid batteries), buildup of overpo-
tential leads to a shift in the potential at which a reaction happens (in the presence 
of excess of ions or when ion supply is at a premium, the chemical potential in the 
vicinity of the electrode/electrolyte interface, and thus the energetics of the charge-
transfer reactions, are altered).
2.5.4  Distribution of Ions
As noted previously, for the case of large-format Li-ion cells, nonuniformities in the 
reaction rates across the different regions of the cells must be accounted for. To ac-
complish this, we use the local values of the ionic concentrations in (2.17) through 
(2.25). The local values for the concentrations are computed using Fick’s laws of 
diffusion:
	
.

(2.26)
The flux used in the above material balance equation is consistent with the previ-
ous definition (see (2.21)). The term Rk refers to the change in concentration of 
Li-ions if they were consumed or generated in a separate chemical reaction taking 
place within the electrodes or the electrolyte other than the normal functioning of 
the battery. At the electrode-electrolyte interface, the change in concentration of the 
ions is because of the electrochemical reaction, and hence the Butler-Volmer equa-
tion (2.24) is used. 
In the case of battery electrolytes, the interactions between the working ions 
(e.g., the Li+ ions in a lithium battery) and that with the other supporting ions (e.g., 
the PF6– anions in the electrolyte) must be considered. These interactions become 
particularly important to predicting the performance of the cells over a wide range 
of temperatures and during high power operations. Complexities such as this are 
usually handled by defining a composite property that considers such interactions. 
In this case, (2.21) for the flux must be modified accordingly:

port number ( 0t+), which is a measure of the fraction of the total current carried by

The diffusivity and conductivity values must be corrected for geometry effects since 
the cell components are porous blocks of solid immersed into the electrolyte. These 
corrections introduce effective transport properties that include shape factors such 
as the porosity (ε) and tortuosity (τ) of the electrodes and the separator:

(2.29)
Similar corrections for temperature dependence are discussed in Chapter 3. The use 
of effective properties as described in (2.29) and composite properties as shown in 
(2.14) is what makes the mechanistic models amenable to use in conjunction with 
easily measureable experimental data. Figure 2.6 shows a comparison between the 
model predictions and experimental data obtained using a physics-based model 
over a wide range of operating temperatures. The ability to use one set of param-
eters under a variety of design conditions is also a direct result of the decoupling of 
the geometry effects from the composition of the different components. 
There are limitations to the mechanistic modeling approach as well: a solution 
of the set of equations (2.11) to (2.29) is more time-consuming compared to the 
circuit-diagram approach. The number of parameters to be experimentally mea-
sured is large. Most importantly, the use of effective properties and approximations 
to the kinetic and transport equations limit the utility of these models in designing 
materials with a known set of properties—for example, in conjunction with quan-
tum mechanical calculations.
The choice of models is often determined by the desired application. Typically, 
fine-tuning of the parameters such as the conductivity of the electrolyte or the po-
rosity of the electrodes is carried out at the cell-design phase. Hence a mechanistic 
model is invaluable at the design phase—for example, when determining the chem-
istry of the cell or to maximize the power available from the cell. Manufacturers of 
battery packs and systems integrators tend to use circuit-based models for two rea-
sons: (1) the amount of information available in such cases is limited and obtain-
ing parameters for a detailed mechanistic evaluation is both time-consuming and 
redundant, and (2) once a cell of desired performance has been designed, during the 
subsequent scale-up of the battery response to a given load or when building packs 
from the batteries, the cells are treated analogous to other electrical components 
involved in the application. In any case, the assumptions behind a mathematical 
model must be carefully explored before employing the conclusions drawn from 
simulations.

After cell assembly, the manufacturer subjects the cells to a set of break-in or forma-
tion cycles as described earlier to allow for the system to stabilize. Then the cells are

charged to about 50% of the nameplate capacity before being shipped to the end 
user. The following is a basic set of electrical tests carried out on the cells before 
use in an application. The protocols outlined in this section are usual guidelines 
practiced in the industry; however, the cutoff values for the voltages, the maximum 
allowable currents during charge or discharge at different temperatures, as well as 
the duration for which the cells can be exposed to a given current or voltage are 
specified by the cell supplier in good detail.
2.6.1  Capacity Measurement
Cells are rated by the capacity specified in ampere hours; with battery packs, the 
default specification is the energy content in kilowatt-hours together with a listing 
of the pack voltage. Measurement of the available energy from the cells is carried 
out by first discharging the cells to the minimum voltage recommended by the 
manufacturer. Next, the cells are charged to the maximum voltage specified by the 
manufacturer followed by a 100% discharge. The charge step carried out using a 
constant value for the current over 2 hours, using the nameplate capacity speci-
fied by the manufacturer as the reference point, followed by holding the cell at the 
maximum charge voltage until the value of the current drops to 10% of the initial 
charging rate. For instance, if the cell is rated at 40 Ah, the charge is carried out 
at 20A, followed by a hold at the maximum voltage until the current drops to 2A. 
The discharge is carried out using the initial charge current as well. In general, the 
capacity measured from a fresh cell at low discharge rates is higher than the name-
plate capacity, and hence the discharge step is likely to continue for a little over 2 
hours. The available capacity is then calculated by integrating the current over the 
duration of the discharge. These steps are repeated until the value of the available 
capacity for the cells stabilizes, which usually happens over 5 to 10 cycles after 
manufacture for a well-made Li-ion cell. 
The state of charge (SOC) is the percentage of the total capacity measured using 
the procedure outlined above that is available at a given instant. Some manufactur-
ers and OEMs specify measured capacity across specific voltage windows for use 
as 100% and 0% SOC. The current at which the cell can be completely discharged 
from 100% SOC to 0 % SOC over a period of 1 hour is termed the 1C rate. The 
currents at other C-rates are determined as the product between the specified rate 
and the current at the 1C rate: for example, at 2C, the current is twice that at 1C 
rate, and ideally, the battery can be fully discharged at half the time. The next series 
of tests involve measuring the available energy at various C-rates. These measure-
ments give an idea of the power capability of the cells. The maximum charge and 
discharge rates at a given temperature are specified by the cell manufacturer. A 
typical set of test data is shown in Figure 2.7. In addition to these constant current 
measurements, the cells are discharged at a prespecified power, as shown earlier in 
Figure 2.5.
2.6.2  Power Measurement
The capability of the cells to deliver high power over short periods of time is par-
ticularly important for many applications. Traditionally, the power density of the 

2.6  Electrical Characterization of Li-Ion Batteries 
41
cells is plotted versus the available energy density in a Ragone plot (see Figure 
2.8), which is then used in power-to-energy trade-off decisions. The batteries are 
subjected to charge/discharge cycles where the constant current discharge is inter-
spersed with short-duration, high-current pulses. These tests are used to determine 
the ability of the cells to provide the requisite power at a specific state of charge. 
The hybrid pulse power capability (HPPC) test and the dynamic stress test (DST) 
are some common examples. A complete set of test procedures for these tests can 
be found in [8]. Specific tests that combine a string of power demands/input to the 
cell based on statistical analyses of drive patterns are available. For example, a 
power cycle that mimics the power requirements from the battery when the vehicle 
is subjected to a urban dyanmometer driving schedule (UDDS) is available. Such 
application-specific test schedules are discussed in Chapters 6 and 7.
2.6.3  Component Characterization
In order to utilize the mathematical models discussed earlier in the chapter, one 
must obtain the relevant parameter set from testing of the individual components. 
Design parameters like dimensions of the individual layers can be directly mea-
sured; whereas porosity and tortuosity have to be estimated from loading (g/cm2) 
measurements and the use of standard correlations for porous solids (see for exam-
ple [9]). In order to measure the properties of materials at the individual electrodes, 
it is standard practice to assemble a three-electrode cell. This test apparatus (see 
Figure 2.7  Rate capability measurements for a Li-ion; the voltage response to several current inputs 
to the cell is used to calibrate the circuit-parameters and to understand the energy/power capabili-
ties of the cell.

Figure 2.9) essentially comprises a small disc of electrode material punched out of 
the cathode and the anode, which is arranged in a hermetically sealed cell in such 
a way that each electrode is sufficiently close to a foil of metallic lithium that can 
serve as the reference electrode, such that the ohmic losses between the reference 
electrode and the battery electrode of interest are minimal. One popularly used 
three-electrode cell design using a SwagelokTM fitting is shown in Figure 2.9. The 
measurements of some of the other electrical parameters discussed in this chapter 
are briefly described below.
2.6.3.1  Open Circuit Potentials
The OCP of the individual electrodes (see Figure 2.3(a)) are measured by individu-
ally monitoring the potential between the anode and the reference electrode as well 
as that between the cathode and the reference electrode simultaneously. After the 
first few formation cycles, the cell is subjected to a very slow rate discharge where 
the current is maintained at C/30 or lower values. Similar measurements are con-
ducted at various temperatures to correct the OCP for changes in the ability of the 
host material to hold lithium (i.e., the entropic changes) with temperature.
2.6.3.2  Conductivity Measurements
For the electrodes, the electronic conductivity is measured using a standard four-
probe method: four equally spaced (~ 1 mm) metal blocks of known dimensions 
are placed on to the electrode supported by predetermined spring loads to ensure 
adequate contact. A high-impedance current source is used to supply known values 
of current across the outer probes and the voltage drop across the inner probes is

parameter while the electrode porosities and the cell capacity are maintained constant. The ability 
of the cell to deliver prespecified values for power or energy density over a stipulated time duration 
is measured along the diagonal lines.

measured to determine the conductivity. For more details on the instrumentation, 
consult available standards (e.g., ASTM F390). The electrolyte conductivity is mea-
sured using portable electrolytic conductivity meters. Calibration of the test setup, 
temperature compensation, and a high cell constant (10 or higher) are some of the 
prerequisites in selecting a suitable conductivity meter. For use with traditional Li-
ion battery electrolytes, material compatibility is an additional concern.
2.6.3.3  Diffusivity Measurements 
Diffusivity of Li-ions in the electrolyte (D2) is related to the viscosity of the electro-
lyte using the Stokes-Einstein relationship:

where k is the Boltzmann constant (1.3806488 × 10–23 m2kgs–2K–1), r is the radius 
of the ion (68 pm), and η is the viscosity at temperature T. Alternatively, solutions 
with different concentrations (and hence mass densities) can be introduced to create 
a concentration and the distribution of lithium ions across different distances from 
the electrode surface can be monitored by using refractive index measurements 
(see [10, 11]). This data can then be used together with (2.26) and (2.27) to back-
calculate the diffusivity within the electrolyte. 
Figure 2.9  Schematic of a three-electrode cell used to measure many of the electrochemical prop-
erties described in this chapter. The anode and cathode are discs punched out of the electrodes 
from the actual Li-ion cell of interest and are positioned as close to each other as possible within 
a Swagelok-type fitting that is sealed together with a third reference electrode, which is a piece of 
lithium foil. There is one layer of separator shielding each electrode disc from an electrical short and 
the space between the electrodes is soaked in the electrolyte. This setup enables the measurement 
of the individual electrode properties when the cell voltage is set to the desired value between the 
anode and the cathode.

The diffusivity of lithium within the electrodes (D1) can be measured using a 
current or voltage perturbation technique, wherein the time constant for the re-
laxation process is a measure of the diffusivity. The following steps summarize the 
titration technique:
1. The cell with the reference electrode is equilibrated at a predetermined 
voltage.
2. A current pulse is introduced such that the time-constant

3. The voltage response is monitored at a high sampling rate (kHz). A typical 
response curve is shown in Figure 2.10.

The potential drop values corresponding to ∆Va and ∆Vb are shown in Figure 2.10. 
The above process utilizes a fixed current pulse and is referred to as the galvano-
static intermittent titration technique (GITT). A voltage pulse is used in the poten-
tiostatic intermittent titration technique (PITT). 
2.6.3.4  Reaction Rate Constants
Frequency domain analysis, which is a popular tool used to analyze electronic cir-
cuitry, also finds use in characterizing electrochemical systems. Typically, the circuit 
representation of a battery (see Figure 2.4) is used in conjunction with a sweep 
of sinusoidal perturbations around the equilibrium voltage and the corresponding

perturbations in the currents are measured using the electrochemical impedance 
spectroscopy (EIS) technique [12]. A typical response is shown in Figure 2.11. The 
different processes such as electron and ion transport within the battery have re-
sponse times that range from microseconds to days. Correspondingly, the frequency 
of the sinusoidal input is varied from MHz to μHz depending on the process of 
interest. In general, to measure reaction rate constants, the frequencies of interest 
lie between 1 MHz and 100 mHz; the Nyquist response corresponds to that of a 
semicircle for a typical RC circuit, whose intercept on the x-axis is the resistance 
to charge transfer (Rct). The exchange current density is then calculated using the

Thermal Behavior 
Batteries are comparable to catalytic chemical reactors that are highly sensitive to 
temperature. The ambient temperature as well as the heat generation rate within the 
cells has a big impact on the selectivity of the reactions that take place within the 
battery and the stability of the different species that participate in the functioning 
of the battery. This is a topic of particular significance, as the size of the individual 
cells and the battery packs keep increasing to meet demands from high energy (and 
high power) applications. For example, the variations in temperature across the dif-
ferent cities in the United States have been shown to create a difference of as many 
as 4 years on the life of batteries used in electric cars. Given the extremes in the 
operating environment, thermal management of batteries is an area of increasingly 
active research that has lasting impact on the increasing adoption of batteries for 
larger-scale applications such as power grids and transportation. In this chapter, we 
have laid down some of the basic principles of heat generation and heat transfer, 
applied these in the context of batteries, and illustrated some design examples.
3.1  Heat Generation in a Battery
Even though a battery is seen as a device to convert chemical energy into electrical 
directly and vice versa, there are a few inevitable energy losses due to mismatch of 
efficiencies among the different components that constitute the battery. Such en-
ergy losses are often manifested in the form of heat. The most common example is 
the Joule losses—the electrons cannot move across a plastic film as fast as they do 
across a sheet of copper, and as a result, the kinetic energy is dissipated as heat. Sim-
ilarly, when the heats of formation of the reactants and the products are different, 
the difference in the energies is usually given out in the form of heat. Similar con-
cepts apply to the movement of ions as well. As a result, there are several sources of 
heat within a Li-ion battery. It is important to identify and characterize each source 
of heat generation because the mitigation strategy for the various sources of heat 
are different, as described in the remainder of this chapter.
3.1.1  Heat Generation from Joule Heating
The joule heating term, as described earlier, arises due to the inability of the elec-
trons to move as fast as they are required to (due to the presence of the external

field or potential gradient). The amount of heat generated under this category is a 
function of the external field as well as the electronic conductivity of the different 
components [1]:

(3.1)
where s is the electronic conductivity (S/m) and φ
∇
s is the voltage gradient (V/m) 
for a given current density. As observed from the expression above, the higher the 
gradients in the potential, the greater the rate of heat generation. As a result, the 
Joule effects are predominant during higher rates of charge/discharge for the bat-
tery. When the battery is under storage or if the current drawn out of the cell is 
meager, other forms of heat generation are dominant. Similarly, if the cell compo-
nents are good conductors of electrons, this helps in reducing the potential gradient 
along the different parts of the cell that the electrons traverse. The most commonly 
used anode material for Li-ion cells is carbon-based, and carbon has an electronic 
conductivity that is two orders of magnitude higher than that for the ceramic-like 
cathode active material. As a result, higher-potential gradients tend to develop in 
the cathode material compared to the anode. In addition to improving the elec-
tronic conductivity of the cathode, the carbon-black based additives also serve the 
purpose of minimizing these gradients.
The movement of ions introduces similar heating effects, only at a larger scale. 
The ions are bulkier (by about 15,000 times) than that of the electrons, and thus 
the efficiency of moving the larger-sized charges is much lower. The constitutive 
property of the electrolyte corresponding to the electronic conductivity (σ) within 
the electrodes is the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte (κ). One other side effect 
of the ions being bulkier is that they tend to move at a much slower pace than the 
electrons. This slow movement often results in the ions being accumulated over 
selective regions of the cells, resulting in an excess of ion concentrations in some 
parts and deficiency of the same species in other parts within the electrolyte. These 
concentration differences introduce additional driving forces for the ions to move 
from a region of higher occupancy to the deficient zones. There is a corresponding 
diffusion-related conductivity (κD), and the driving forces are the gradients of the 
ionic concentration. The contributions from these two phenomena are summed up 
in the following expression for the joule heating that happens within the electrolyte:

One difference between (3.1) and (3.2) is the presence of the porosity term in the lat-
ter. The implication is that the porosity (ε) of the electrodes and/or the separator can 
be used as a design knob in order to adjust the amount of heat generated from the 
ionic contributions. For this reason, batteries designed for high-power applications 
(e.g., plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs)) often use a larger porosity. The other 
parameter to alter is the electrolyte conductivity—this is accomplished by using 
the appropriate salt-to-solvent ratio for the electrolyte, or by the use of additives. 
In either instance, the objective is to make sure the viscosity of the electrolyte is in 
the appropriate range to minimize excess heat build-up due to viscous dissipation. 
In optimizing either of these parameters (porosity or the electrolyte conductivity), 

3.1  Heat Generation in a Battery 
49
there is often a trade-off between obtaining the best thermal environment for the 
cell to operate in versus the other functionalities viz., ensuring that adequate ions 
are available for transporting the charge in the case of the ionic conductivity and 
maximizing the available energy within a given volume of the cell in the case of the 
electrode porosity. 
3.1.2  Heat Generation from Electrode Reactions
Current through the cell is carried by electrons within the electrodes and ions within 
the electrolyte. At each interface between the electrodes and the electrolyte, there 
is a transfer of charge between the two carriers that takes place during the electro-
chemical reactions at the interface. Part of the kinetic energy associated with these 
reactions is lost as heat due to the inefficiency of the charge-transfer process. Every 
time there is a charge-transfer happening across the electrode-electrolyte interface, 
there is an associated potential across the interface due to the resulting difference 
in the free energy in the electrode (and the electrolyte) before and after the charge 
is transferred. This potential is a measure of the amount of work done in order to 
carry a unit charge across the interface—it has the unit of volts (which in turn is 
joules per coulomb). The difference in energies between the two sides of the in-
terface accounts for the inefficiency of the charge-transfer process. Thus the heat 
generation rate from the reactions is given by:
	
η
= ∑
s j
j
j
q
a i
	
(3.3)
where the product of the overpotential (η, joules per coulomb) by the area-scaled 
reaction rates (asij amperes per unit volume) is a measure of the total amount of 
energy released (or consumed) per second per unit volume. As previously discussed 
in Section 2.5.3, the higher the overpotential, the farther the deviation from equi-
librium performance of the battery—and as shown in (3.3), one of the contributors 
to this deviation is the additional heat generation.
Whereas the kinetic effects depend on the power requirements for the target 
application akin to the Joule effect, this dependence of the reaction heat changes 
with the remaining usable energy available in the cell. This allows for the operating 
window for a given cell to be used as a knob to size the amount of heat generation. 
Another parameter of interest is the kinetic rate constant; altering the rate constant 
is comparable to improving the charge-transfer efficiency of the reactions at the 
interface, thereby minimizing thermal losses. The best way to accomplish such a 
change is by employing surface modifications to the electrode particles.
3.1.3  Entropic Heat Generation
The insertion and deinsertion of Li-ions in and out of the electrodes results in a 
change in the arrangement of atoms within the crystal structure, and in turn their 
mutual interactions. Such changes are reversible from a practical perspective; how-
ever, there is some energy loss associated with these phenomena. We call these losses 
associated with the arrangement of the different species the entropic heat. Changes

to the entropic heat are often incorporated into the heat-generation calculations by 
a correction factor to the overpotential:

where U is the equilibrium value for the potential at the reference temperature Tref 
and is calculated from the Gibbs’ free energy for a given composition of the mate-
rial. The entropic term, as represented in (3.4) assumes a linear change with tem-
perature in the equilibrium potential across the interface for each electrode. Given 
that the entropic contributions are small compared to the kinetic or joule heating 
under normal operating scenario for the battery, this approximation is appropriate. 
The entropic heat is a characteristic signature of the material; hence, the knob to 
control this term lies in the choice of the electrode materials. However, evaluation 
of this quantity can be used as a screening test during the material selection process.
Figure 3.1 shows a comparison of the heat generated by these different mecha-
nisms within a spinel-based cell simulated for a specific set of design parameters. 
Joule effects (i.e., ohmic heat generated in the electrodes and from the contact re-
sistances) play a dominant role in the heat generation within the battery typically 
during high power demands. For the constant-current discharge on a 16 Ah cell 
shown in the figure, the average joule heating rate is ~20W. This value increases 
slightly toward the end of discharge (i.e., DOD > 80%) since the electrodes become 
more resistive at those chemical compositions; however, the values stay constant 
for majority of the discharge duration. As a result, the temperature rise, which

from the electrodes and contacts is not shown on the figure for clarity, since these values are much higher 
than the other sources of heat for the conditions simulated.

is computed from the integral of the heat generated, has a fairly constant slope. 
Another noticeable result is that the reaction heats can be negative (endothermic) 
or positive (exothermic) depending on the standard energy of formation for the 
reaction products and the reactants. Hence, the net heat generation term for the 
reaction heats can accordingly be positive or negative. 
For efficient cell design, a balance must be struck among the different strate-
gies outlined in this section. A large heat transfer area can help dissipate the ohmic 
heats, for example. However, in large-format cells the chances for uneven utiliza-
tion of the active material across the area of the electrodes is quite common; as a 
result, some parts of the electrode (especially the region in the immediate vicinity 
of the tabs) end up handling higher currents than the others. At the module or 
pack level, the heat generation may still not be spatially uniform because of other 
factors: thermal conductivity of the case, placement of the positive and negative 
terminals, or size and position of the cell interconnects within the module. 
3.2  Experimental Measurement of Thermal Parameters
Thermal parameters associated with battery design are often measured using calo-
rimetric methods. This section outlines the basic operating principles and different 
types of equipment used commonly in characterization of a Li-ion battery’s thermal 
performance. Aspects related to battery safety are deferred until Chapter 4.
3.2.1  Isothermal Battery Calorimeters
Isothermal battery calorimeters (IBCs) provide critical heat generation and effi-
ciency data for the battery under test. Understanding how much heat is produced 
by the battery allows manufacturers to design a cooling system that will operate the 
battery within a range that extends the life and operational safety of the battery. 
Before IBCs, battery manufacturers could only estimate the round-trip efficiency of 
a battery through electrical measurements—the battery would be discharged and 
then charged back to its original state of charge (SOC). This technique is limited 
by the inability to determine the discharge and charge efficiency independently. By 
using IBCs to directly measure heat, the efficiency of the battery can be determined 
independently for both charge and discharge currents rather than a combination of 
the two.
3.2.2  Basic IBC Operation
IBCs are primarily based on two different designs: temperature control and heat 
conduction. The temperature control design attempts to regulate the temperature 
of the battery under test; in essence, it attempts to keep the battery isothermal 
while the battery is charged and discharged. Figure 3.2 shows a basic schematic of 
a temperature-controlled IBC. The test chamber in which the battery is located is 
surrounded by thermal electric devices (TEDs). TEDs are used because they have 
the ability to cool and heat depending on the direction of the current to the TEDs—
batteries will experience endothermic and exothermic conditions during cycling. 
Essentially, TEDs are used to control the temperature of the test chamber as well as 

52 
�����������������
Thermal Behavior 
the temperature of the battery. As the battery is charged and discharged, the power 
to the TEDs is modulated to keep the battery at an isothermal temperature. The 
difference in power required by the TEDs to maintain a temperature under differ-
ent test conditions is calibrated to a known heat flow into and out of the chamber. 
The primary limitation of this design is that the battery temperature used for the 
TED control is limited to a finite number of temperature sensors. Furthermore, only 
the surface temperature of the battery can be measured so the battery is not truly 
isothermal; only its surface is considered isothermal. Hence the measurement of 
reaction heats under normal operating conditions (e.g., within a pack) will need to 
be carried out after calibrating out the temperature nonuniformity. 
The second type of IBC is a heat-conduction IBC. A schematic of a heat-con-
duction calorimeter is shown in Figure 3.3. The heat conduction calorimeters sense 
heat flux between the battery and a heat sink. If the battery is hotter or colder than 
the heat sink, heat flows between the heat sink and the sample. In actual prac-
tice, the thermal conductivity of the path between the sample and the heat sink is

3.2  Experimental Measurement of Thermal Parameters

matched to the expected heat flow so that the temperature difference between the 
battery and the heat sink is minimized. The temperature of the heat sink is kept 
constant and the entire calorimeter shielded from its surroundings by a constant-
temperature bath. The temperature control of the heat sink, together with proper 
matching of the thermal conductivity of the path between battery and the heat sink, 
renders a passive isothermal measurement condition. The heat flow between the 
battery under test and the heat sink is measured with a set of TEDs. A temperature 
difference across the TEDs generates a voltage proportional to a known heat flow. 
The limitation of this type of IBC is that the measured heat is dependent on the 
mass (time constant) of the calorimeter chamber; the larger the chamber, the larger 
the time difference between when the heat is generated in the battery and when the 
heat is sensed by the TEDs. The other limitation is that the battery is not isothermal 
under high charge and discharge currents; coupling the battery to the test chamber 
walls can mitigate the temperature change but not eliminate it.
Figure 3.4 shows a typical IBC response to a battery being tested over a range 
of currents; this particular battery is used for PHEV applications. The heat curve 
generated from the calorimeter is essentially power (heat generated by the bat-
tery) versus time; the test should begin and end when an isothermal temperature 
condition exists for the calorimeter and the battery under test. The thermal power 
(dQ/dt) generated within the battery upon charge or discharge is integrated to de-
termine how much heat (Q) is produced during the test. Whether the heat comes 
from the entropic heating or joule heating of a battery, the time integration of the 
instantaneous thermal power allows for the total heat (Q) to be measured. Equa-
tion (3.5) shows how to calculate the heat release from/to the battery under test.

The heat generated by the cell is due to the I2R losses in the cell and the chemical 
changes within the cell as measured by the calorimeter. The E(input/output) is the 
electrical energy supplied or taken away from the cell over the testing cycle. Both 
the heat generated and the electrical energy are measured in joules. The average cell 
heat rate in watts is determined by the following equation:

The heat generated is in joules and is divided by the cycle time in seconds. The cycle 
time is the time over which the charge or discharge of the battery was completed. 
For instance, a C/1 discharge from 100% to 0% SOC takes approximately 60 min-
utes (3,600 seconds).
3.2.3  Typical Applications for an IBC
As mentioned earlier, IBCs find use in a variety of applications to characterize the 
thermal performance of batteries. This section outlines some examples.
3.2.3.1  Efficiency and Heat Generation
A typical heat generation curve produced by the calorimeter for a battery is shown 
in Figure 3.5(a). The figure shows how the heat generation is dependent on ambient 
temperature conditions and the magnitude of the current applied to the battery. The 
associated efficiency losses are summarized in Figure 3.5(b). Battery manufacturers 
can use such data to design a thermal management system to maintain the battery 
pack within the desired temperature range, preventing it from becoming too hot. 
Regulating the operating temperature of a battery pack is essential because it affects 
performance (power and capacity), charge acceptance (during regenerative brak-
ing), life span, safety, and vehicle operating and maintenance expenses. 
3.2.3.2  Entropic Heating of Batteries
IBCs are designed to measure the joule heating and entropic heating of a battery 
under test. As a battery is discharged from 100% to 0% SOC, the battery goes 
through several crystalline phase transitions as shown in Figure 3.6. The battery 
in this figure was discharged at a very low current to limit the joule heating of the 
battery. As shown in the figure, the battery undergoes an endothermic transition at 
about 3 hours, which is the equivalent of 70% SOC.

3.2  Experimental Measurement of Thermal Parameters 
55
With a crystalline or any other phase transition, the material going through the 
phase transition expands and contracts. For the most part, batteries are engineered

temperatures: this critical information is used to regulate the temperature of the battery during use.

56 
�����������������
Thermal Behavior 
to mitigate damage during these phase transitions for a limited number of cycles. 
However, batteries typically are not engineered for repeated cycles through the 
phase transition that may occur in various applications. Knowing where the phase 
transition occurs within the SOC window allows the battery manufacturer to de-
sign a control strategy to prevent repeated cycling at this point. In the end, the 
control strategy can be adjusted to prevent the formation of cracks in the battery 
material (cathode and anode), reducing the warranty costs and the life-cycle cost of 
the battery while increasing the reliability of the energy storage system. 
Furthermore, an energy storage device can be an endothermic device. The de-
vice requires heat to be pulled from the environment in order to sustain the internal 
chemical reaction—in essence, it provides mild cooling under certain test condi-
tions. Figure 3.7 shows a Li-ion capacitor (LIC) that is completely endothermic 
during charge up to currents as high as 70A. Comparing these results to the heat 
generation rates for Li-ion batteries shown in Figure 3.1 gives us an idea of the en-
ergetics associated with the two devices employing the same working ion.
Knowing the entropic nature of the device under test allows for the thermal 
management system to be designed according to how the device is being cycled or 
charged. If this device were to be charged by a wall outlet for an electric vehicle 
application, then a cooling system may not be required—the cooling of the pack 
would occur when charging the cell, minimizing the efficiency loss. All of the avail-
able energy would be used to charge the battery pack, resulting in a quicker charge 
time for the pack.

3.2.3.3  Efficiency Comparison between Cells
Figure 3.8 compares the efficiency of a second and third generation cell from the 
same manufacturer. The cells were discharged under a constant current from 100% 
to 0% SOC. The efficiency of the Gen 3 cell is slightly below the efficiency of its 
predecessor, the Gen 2 cell, indicating from this snapshot of data that the cell design 
has not improved from one generation to the next. However, cells are not typically 
used over their full capacity range due to life-cycle limitations of the cell. In this par-
ticular case, the cells will be used in an HEV vehicle application and be cycled from 
approximately 70% to 30% SOC. Figure 3.9 compares the efficiency of the Gen 2 
and Gen 3 cell over this usage range of the cell. As can be seen from the figure, the 
Figure 3.7  Calorimeter response to an LIC: the LIC is completely endothermic under charge cur-
rents up to 70A.

Thermal Behavior 
efficiencies of the two cells are fairly well matched. Battery manufacturers use the 
data from IBCs to ensure that the cell has the desired efficiency over the usage range 
while making trade-offs on other aspects of the cell design such as low temperature 
operation, safety, cost, and ease of manufacturing.
IBCs are crucial tools in assessing the thermal performance of lithium ion cells. 
IBCs provide key data for the accurate design of a thermal management system, 
which directly affects the cycle life cost of the battery pack. Faster degradation due 
to temperature means replacing the expensive batteries sooner, which makes elec-
tric drive vehicles (EDVs) less affordable. Early reports on capacity fading in the 
Nissan Leaf EV batteries and Li-ion battery fires in Boeing Dreamliner airplanes 
provide dramatic illustrations of how uncontrollable temperature increases can be 
during system failure. IBCs can help understand how temperature affects a bat-
tery’s life and how changes made to the battery design affect its thermal signature 
at different temperatures.

Differential scanning calorimeters (DSC) are used primarily to assess the heat ca-
pacity of a material. Heat capacity is a measure of how much energy it takes to in-
crease the temperature of a known mass by 1 Kelvin. The SI units for heat capacity 
are joules/kg/K whereas the imperial unit for heat capacity is BTU/°F/lbm. There are 
two types of differential scanning calorimeters: heat flux and heat flow DSCs. The 
heat flux and heat flow DSCs are shown in Figure 3.10. The heat flux DSC consists 
of a chamber that contains two sample holders or pans; the sample pan contains 
the material under study whereas the reference pan is empty.  The two pans are 
identical in their mass and volume and are typically made from high thermal con-
ductivity materials such as aluminum. If a pressure-rated pan is used, then the pan 
material is made from stainless steel or titanium—a higher tensile strength material 
but a lower thermal conductivity of these materials also limits the accuracy of the

results. In a heat flux DSC, the temperature difference between the sample pan and 
the reference pan is measured. Using calibration curves, the temperature difference 
between the sample and the reference pans allows for the heat flux to be calculated. 
In general, the basic governing equation for a DSC experiment is shown in (3.8) 
where the dH/dt is the change in specific energy (J/g) with respect to time (s), Cp is 
the heat capacity of the material in J/g/°C, and the dT/dt (°C/s) is the programmed 
heating rate for the DSC:

Different manufacturers have different correction factors associated with (3.8) that 
relates to the design of their specific unit. Heat flux DSCs are more cost-effective 
and most of the commercially available calorimeters are based off of this design. 
The heat flow DSC has two identical chambers that have their own temperature 
sensors and heaters. The temperature of each chamber is independently controlled 
and matched to the other. The difference in the heater power between the two 
chambers directly relates to the heat capacity and/or enthalpy of the sample under 
test.
The typical heating rate used for DSC experiments is 10ºC/min—a matter of 
tradition only. It should be noted that the sensitivity and productivity are increased 
by going to higher heat rates but this limits the temperature resolution and accura-
cy. In essence, if one is primarily interested in the melting temperature of a material, 
then a lower heating rate would better suit one’s needs. As for the benefits of higher 
heating rates, these suppress kinetically hindered processes such as crystallization; 
thus, the high heating rates allow for the thermodynamic properties of unstable 
materials such as electrolytes to be investigated.

3.3.1  Differential Scanning Calorimeters and Batteries
In its intended and basic operation, a differential scanning calorimeter can be used 
to assess the heat capacity of the different materials associated with a lithium cell—
electrolyte, separator, cathode, anode, and electrodes. The heat capacity is very 
useful and is required for developing accurate electrochemical/thermal models for a 
lithium cell. Figure 3.11 shows the heat capacity of an electrolyte solution contain-
ing different amounts of LiPF6 salt in a 1:1 mixture of EC/EMC. The heat capacity 
of the electrolyte varies as a function of temperature and composition, indicating 
that the heat generation from the electrolyte as shown on Figure 3.11, at least in 
part, originates from poor distribution of the electrolyte (or the ions within the 
electrolyte) within the large-format cell. 
DSCs are being used more and more extensively to assess the safety of the 
different components within a Li-ion cell. One of the safety features of interest to 
battery manufacturers is shutdown separators. A shutdown separator consists of 
multiple polymeric layers and each layer has a different melting temperature. A 
typical shutdown separator consists of three layers: polypropylene (PP), polyethyl-
ene (PE), and another layer of PP. The PE layer has a melting point of around 130°C 
whereas the PP layers have a melting point of around 155°C. The separator shuts 
down when the PE melts and fills the pores, preventing Li-ions from transferring 
between the cathode and anode. DSCs are being used to assess the effectiveness of 
these shutdown separators by providing critical data such as melting temperatures 
and the enthalpy of fusion. Figure 3.12 shows a DSC run to assess the melting

amounts of LiPF6. (Based on data from: Botte et al. [2].)

temperature of a typical trilayer (PP/PE/PP) shutdown separator. The gradient of 
heat generation near the melting point is an indicator of how fast the separator can 
shut down in case of excessive heat generation within the cell.
Despite the promise of Li-ion batteries, there are problems such as life and 
safety issues that have been bottlenecks for the introduction of these batteries in 
mass-produced advanced electrified vehicles. Some of the degradation and capacity 
loss can be traced to corrosion of the electrodes due to electrode dissolution and 
reactions that occur between the electrodes and the surrounding electrolyte. To ad-
dress these problems, an artificial solid electrolyte interface layer can be deposited 
on the cathode or anode through a process called atomic layer deposition (ALD). 
ALD can affect the thermal stability of Li-ion electrodes and thermal behaviors of 
the full cell at high temperatures. Figure 3.13 shows how repeated ALD applica-
tions of Al2O3 can affect the thermal stability of a NCA cathode. Four different 
samples were tested with a DSC: (1) bare NCA, 92) NCA with six ALD applica-
tions of Al2O3, (3) NCA with 10 ALD applications of Al2O3, and (4) an aluminum 
blank with excess electrolyte. The DSC results show that repeated applications of 
Al2O3 reduces the amount of energy released as compared to the bare NCA sample. 
At the same time, there is not much difference between the cathode surface coated 
with six ALD layers of Al2O3 versus that coated with 10 layers, indicating that 
six layers of the coating is adequate to mitigate the heat generated due to reaction 
between NCA and the electrolyte. This is but one example that calorimetry is an 
essential tool for the development of safe and reliable Li-ion batteries for future 
vehicle and grid applications.

3.4  Infrared Imaging
Thermal imaging has been in use for the past 50 years and was originally developed 
for military applications. Presently, infrared (IR) thermal imaging technology is 
widely used by industry and is being applied in such fields as health care, firefight-
ing, building maintenance, and construction. Basically, IR thermography or thermal 
imaging is used to detect radiation in the infrared range of the electromagnetic spec-
trum—typically, the radiation has a wavelength of 9 to 14 microns. Specialized IR 
cameras have been developed to detect the radiation and produce thermal images of 
the object. The thermal images can be used to understand heat flow paths in build-
ings, the human body, and battery systems.
3.4.1  Origin of Thermal Energy
All objects above a temperature of absolute zero emit infrared or thermal energy. 
The IR radiation is a measure of the atomic or molecular movement in an object 
due to its temperature. All thermal energy emitted by an object will be absorbed, 
reflected, or transmitted. Figure 3.14 shows a schematic of the process.
The absorption energy is a measure of how much incident energy is absorbed 
by the object. Typically, objects like asphalt, ceramics, and plastics are good at ab-
sorbing energy. The reflection energy is a measure of how much energy reflects off 
of an object. Materials like aluminum, copper, and silver are good reflectors. The 
transmission energy is a measure of how much energy is transmitted through an

incorporated into Li-ion cells interfere with the nominal operation of the cell.

object—as a general rule, objects, including window glass, are poor transmitters of 
IR radiation. Barium fluoride, calcium fluoride, and germanium are exceptions to 
this rule and are therefore used, at times, for the lenses in IR cameras.
If an object is under isothermal steady-state conditions, then 100% of the ther-
mal energy directed at it is reflected, transmitted, or absorbed.

If the object is assumed to be opaque to IR radiation (and most objects are), then 
no energy is transmitted through the object and (3.9) becomes:

energy must equal the emitted energy and (3.10) becomes:

Stated in another way, the reflectivity and emissivity for opaque objects add to-
gether to be 100%. Thus, we get to the more practical definition of emissivity and 
reflectivity for opaque objects.

3.4.1.1  How Does the Emissivity and Reflectivity of an Object Affect Its Thermal 
Image?
The emissivity and reflectivity of materials can have a large impact on an object’s 
thermal signature. To further complicate the matter, the emissivity of a material 
can vary depending on how the material was fabricated or processed—the emis-
sivity of highly polished copper is approximately 0.02 whereas burnished copper 
has an emissivity of approximately 0.10. Figure 3.15 shows a thermal image of a 
battery under isothermal conditions. The thermal image indicates that the battery 
terminals are hotter than the rest of the battery despite the isothermal conditions. 
Figure 3.14  Incident thermal energy on an object is either absorbed, reflected, or transmitted.

64 
�����������������
Thermal Behavior 
The terminals of the battery are made from aluminum (positive) and nickel-coated 
copper (negative) materials; these materials are highly reflective and are reflecting 
the IR radiation within the laboratory instead of emitting a radiative signature that 
is indicative of its temperature. Upon looking close enough, one can see the IR sig-
nature of the camera-shy researcher taking the IR image.
When IR-imaging a battery, it is imperative that the emissivity of the battery 
be consistent across its entire surface, including the connecting busbars and bat-
tery terminals and tabs. The battery can be painted with high-emissivity paint; 
flat paints typically have a higher emissivity than glossy paints. However, using a 
paint to adjust the emissivity of a surface requires a fairly thick coating that could 
artificially affect the heat signature of the object being imaged and paints are not 
easy to remove. Boron nitride, on the other hand, has a high emissivity and comes 
in convenient spray can that requires a very thin coating to increase the emissiv-
ity of a surface to approximately 0.9. Boron nitride is a ceramic material that is 
used primarily as a lubricant in vacuum systems due to its low vapor pressure but 
works very well for adjusting the emissivity of a highly reflective object. Figure 
3.16 shows a picture of a battery sprayed with a thin layer of boron nitride. The 
text “Cell #1” written on the surface of the battery can be read through the suf-
ficiently thin layer of boron nitride. Figure 3.16 also shows a thermal image of the 
Figure 3.15  Isothermal pouch cell (left) and its corresponding infrared image: the terminals are 
reflecting the IR radiation in the laboratory and therefore appear hotter than the rest of the cell.

boron nitride coated battery under isothermal conditions. The battery temperature 
is very uniform, as expected, and the terminals no longer appear to be warmer than 
the rest of the battery because the reflectivity of these surfaces has been diminished 
due to the coating of boron nitride.
3.4.2  Calibration and Error
Before imaging a battery system, the IR thermal camera needs to be calibrated for 
the emissivity of the battery being imaged. The easiest way to perform this calibra-
tion is to place several calibrated thermocouples (TCs) on the surface of the battery 
with a thermally conductive epoxy. The battery and the TCs/epoxy should be coated 
with boron nitride to have a consistent high emissivity surface before performing 
the calibration. The temperature of the TCs and the temperature given by the IR 
camera can be synchronized by adjusting the emissivity setting on the camera. The 
temperature calibration of the camera should take place over the temperature range 
that the battery will be experiencing during imaging.
When capturing the IR image of a battery, the largest source of error is due to 
the variation in emissivity across the battery’s surface. The next largest source of 
error is due to the viewing angle between the camera lens and the battery. A flat and 
uniform battery, as long as it is limited in size, will have limited temperature error 
due to viewing angle. However, a curved surface on a cylindrical battery will result 
in progressively different viewing angles and focal points. The result will be an 
increasingly blurred surface with less temperature accuracy as the imaged surface 
approaches a 90° angle to the plane of the camera/lens, as shown in Figure 3.17. If 
a hot spot or defect is detected on a curved surface, then the camera angle should 
be adjusted to ensure that the defect is real and not an artifact of the viewing angle.
3.4.3  Imaging Battery Systems
IR imaging is an important tool used to determine areas of thermal concern in bat-
tery systems. The thermal design of a cell, module, or pack can affect the cost, cycle 
life, and safety of a battery system. IR imaging has been used to determine manu-

facturing defects, cell thermal uniformity, and how to improve the electro/thermal 
design of the battery.
Figure 3.18 shows a thermal image of a 12V lead acid battery module with a 
defect in one of its cells. This particular module made it through formation and 
quality acceptance but when it was put on test the modules amp-hour capacity 
decreased quickly and therefore had a short cycle life. To understand the root cause 
of the short cycle life, the module was thermally imaged. The imaging revealed 
that the module had apparently been struck with an object, possibly during ship-
ping, causing a soft short in the layers of one of the spiral wound cells. The short 
could not be detected by visually inspecting the surface of the module and was only 
detected after thermal imaging the module. Understanding the limitation of the 
modules external enclosure, the manufacturer of the battery changed the hardness 
of the plastic so that any force applied to the surface would not be transferred to 
the cell layers contained within and cause an early failure of the module. 
Figures 3.19 and 3.20 show the thermal images of two PHEV cells from differ-
ent manufacturers at the end of a constant current C/1 discharge; the Ah capacities

of the cells are within 5% of one another. Each figure contains a thermal image 
of the cell at the end of the discharge as well as plot indicating horizontal contour 
lines across the face of the cell: L01, L02, L03, and L04. Figure 3.19 shows a hot 
spot in the upper right corner of the thermal image of the cell as well as a wide 
spread in temperature across the face of the cell from top to bottom and left to 
right. Figure 3.20, on the other hand, shows a very uniform temperature distribu-
tion across the face of the cell at the end of discharge. When the cell temperature 
is uniform and consistent, all areas within the cell age at the same rate, leading to 
a better cycle life. After discussions with the manufacturer of the less thermally 
uniform cell, it was determined that the cell was gassing during cycling and that the 
contact resistance between the different layers in the cell increased, which led to the 
temperature variations across the surface. The minimal gassing of the cell during 
cycling was not detectable by visually inspecting the cell and was detected only by 
thermally imaging the cell.
IR imaging of battery systems is a crucial tool in understanding the thermal 
inefficiencies associated with a battery design. IR imaging can identify mechanical 
and thermal defects that are not apparent when visually inspecting the cell. The 
use of IR imaging continues to expand and will continue to be a useful tool in de-
termining areas of thermal concern with regard to battery cell and system design.
3.5  Desired Attributes of a Thermal Management System
Given the various modes of heat generation within a battery, a thermal manage-
ment system invariably helps improve battery performance. The goal of a thermal 
management system is to ensure that the battery pack can deliver the specified load 
requirements at an optimum average temperature (as dictated by life and perfor-
mance trade-off) with an even temperature distribution (i.e., only small variations 
within the cell, between the modules, and within the pack) as identified by the 
battery manufacturer. However, the pack thermal management system has to meet 
the requirements of the vehicle as specified by the vehicle manufacturer as well; for

Thermal Behavior 
example, it must be compact, lightweight, low cost, easily packaged, and compat-
ible with location in the vehicle. In addition, it must be reliable and easily accessible 
for maintenance. It must also use low parasitic power, allow the pack to operate un-
der a wide range of climate conditions (very cold to very hot), and allow ventilation 
if the battery generates potentially hazardous gases. There are several approaches 
to classify thermal management techniques for battery packs: a thermal manage-
ment system may use air for heat/cooling/ventilation, liquid for cooling/heating, 
insulation, thermal storage such as phase change materials, or a combination of 
these methods; the thermal management system may be passive (i.e., only the ambi-
ent environment is used) or active (i.e., a built-in source provides heating and/or 
cooling at cold or hot temperatures). Figure 3.21 shows schematics of an air-cooled 
and liquid cooled battery system to illustrate the differences in complexity between 
the different cooling systems. Depending on the type of coolant(s) and the mode of 
heat transfer, an effective control strategy is designed for thermal management and 
implemented through the battery pack’s electronic control unit.
3.5.1  Designing a Battery Thermal Management System
The design aspects of a battery thermal management system (BTMS) are closely 
related to the conventional design of heat exchangers. The basic sequence of design 
involve identification of the design objectives and constraints, measurement of heat 
generation rate and heat capacity of the modules, perform design calculations based

on the energy balance equations outlined earlier in the chapter, predict battery per-
formance using the design equations, design, build and test the preliminary battery 
thermal management system, and finally optimize the unit. Each of these steps is 
discussed in detail in the following pages.
3.5.1.1  Defining the BTMS Design Objective and Constraints
There are three major constraints that one needs to identify when designing the BTMS: 
 Specification of desired thermal performance for the modules and packs under 
various operating conditions (i.e., the average temperature, the difference between 
the maximum and minimum temperatures within a module and between modules). 
Once the target temperatures are identified, the other key challenge is to determine 
the potential electrical and mechanical interfaces with the rest of the vehicle:
••
Size constraints (geometry, dimensions, number, orientation, and pack-
aging of modules to be managed) as dictated by the vehicle integrator’s 
requirements;
••
Safety requirements (e.g., specification of the maximum pressure drop across 
the cooling channels, need for ventilation);
••
Cost requirements.
In practical design scenarios, the three sets of constraints often have contrasting 
design outcomes that the engineer must grapple with during the optimization phase.
3.5.1.2  Obtaining Module Properties
Once the thermal performance at the individual cell level has been optimized by the 
cell manufacturer, it is common industrial practice to treat the module as a lumped 
reactor together with the packaging elements and circuitry in designing the BTMS. 
Toward this end, the thermal characterization of the module should be carried out. 
For example, the overall heat generation rate from the module must be measured 
under the desired charge/discharge rates at various operating temperatures. The 
magnitude of overall heat generation rate from the modules in a pack affects the 
size and design of the thermal management system. It depends on the magnitude of 
module internal resistance and thermodynamic heat of the (electrochemical) reac-
tion. Thus, the heat generation rate depends on the discharge/charge profile and the 
module’s state of charge and temperature. The heat generation could be estimated 
by measuring the internal resistance and enthalpy of the chemical reaction at the 
desired conditions. However, direct measurements could lead to more accurate val-
ues. One method is to charge/discharge a module with a cycle so the initial and final 
state of the charge (and temperature) of the battery remains the same. The differ-
ence between the electrical energy in and electrical energy out of the module is the 
heat generated in the module. When using this approach one must ensure that the 
state of charge of the battery at the end of the test is the same as that from the be-
ginning of the test, but it can be time-consuming to exactly match the SOCs before 
and after the test. The other difficulty in using this method is that the module tem-

70 
�����������������
Thermal Behavior 
perature changes with heat generation and one should estimate the energy stored in 
the module due to its thermal mass.
In order to do any reasonable transient or steady-state thermal analysis, the 
designer must know the heat capacity of the module. Overall or average heat ca-
pacity can either be measured or calculated from knowledge of heat capacity of 
individual components using a mass-weighted average of cell/module components. 
The effective heat capacity of the module is usually determined at various states 
of charge and temperature for proper calibration of the heat transfer models. The 
measurement of heat generation rates and the estimation of the heat capacity are 
best carried out using calorimeters as described in the previous section.
3.5.1.3  Design Calculations to Perform a First-Order BTMS Evaluation
Using the standard energy balance equation, the transient or steady-state tempera-
ture of the module/pack is determined for the anticipated operating conditions as 
specified in the design requirements. One of the key decisions the designer is faced 
with at this stage is the choice of the heat transfer medium. The heat transfer me-
dium can be air, liquid, a phase change material, or any combination of these. Heat 
transfer with air is achieved simply by blowing air across the modules. 
However, heat transfer with liquid can be achieved either through discrete tub-
ing around each module, a jacket around the modules, submerging modules in a 
dielectric fluid for direct contact, or by placing the modules on a liquid heated/
cooled plate. If the liquid is not in direct contact with the modules—for example, 
when a tube or jacket is used—the heat transfer medium can be water-based auto-
motive fluids. If modules are submerged in the heat transfer fluid, the fluid must 
be dielectric, such as silicon-based oils, to avoid any electrical shorts. Using the air 
as the heat transfer medium may be the simplest approach, but the heat transfer 
rates are lower compared to a liquid-cooled system. With liquid systems, an extra 
heat exchanger for heat rejection/addition is required. In some cases, the side of the 
modules is wrapped with a phase change material to control the temperature of the 
module temporarily; however, carrying the heat from the phase change material to 
the exterior of the pack still relies on another suitable heat-exchange mechanism. 
The final selection of the heat transfer medium is made upon evaluating other fac-
tors such as added volume, mass, complexity, ease of maintenance, and cost. Such 
evaluations are carried out by repeating the design calculations with the different 
heating/cooling fluids (air, liquid), different flow paths (direct or indirect, series 
or parallel), and different flow rates. As part of this step, the designer needs to 
estimate the thermophysical properties of the fluid for further thermal analysis. 
The trade-off between the flow rate across the cooling channels to accomplish the 
requisite heat transfer rate (based on the heat transfer coefficient of the cooling 
fluid) and the maximum allowable pressure drop across the channels determines 
the choice of coolants. Figure 3.22 shows the trade-off comparisons for three dif-
ferent coolants, whose properties are listed in Table 1. 
The following simple expression was used to relate the pressure drop (ΔP) 
within a channel to the coolant properties and the flow conditions:1

The temperature difference between the inlet and the exit streams is treated as the

Thus, separate constraints may be imposed on the maximum temperature differ-
ence across the cell surface and along the flow direction. Simultaneously, a compre-
hensive bound on the net temperature difference between the cell skin temperature 
and the inlet temperature for the coolant can be specified as ΔTnet = ΔT1 + ΔT2. 
Figure 3.22 shows a plot of ΔTnet contours as a function of coolant mass flow rate 
(m) and the hydraulic diameter (Dh) of the coolant channel for three different cool-
ants. The values of ΔTnet in the air-cooled channel are much higher compared to 
the liquid cooled channel due to the small heat capacity and thermal conductivity 
of air. Another notable difference among the contours for the different coolants 
is that in the case where air-cooled channels are employed, the flow rate changes 
significantly even for small changes in the hydraulic diameter, whereas in the case 
of liquid-cooled channels, the contours on Figure 3.22 (b–c) have lower gradients. 
This indicates that ΔTnet is more sensitive in the case of air-cooling to the flow 
channel’s hydraulic diameter than the mass flow rate for the range of these design 
variables shown in the figure, whereas, in the same domain, for the water/glycol 
mix, the hydraulic size of the flow channel is not expected to be the limiting factor 
in the channel design.
Once a preliminary choice of heating/cooling fluid and the fluid flow rate have 
been established, based on the flow-rate calculations, a rough estimate of the para-
sitic power requirements for the fan or pump is obtained. Usually, the choice of 
the cooling fluid follows a standard subset of industrial coolants that have been 
approved by regulatory bodies for use in passenger vehicles.
Let us consider another example when heat transfer by radiation is important 
for designing packaging material for cylindrical cells. For this case, the amount of 
heat generated is related to the amount of heat transferred from the surface of the 
cell by Newton’s law of cooling:

~15 W/m2–K for a stainless steel cell casing. Now, the total heat transfer coefficient 
can be interpreted as being composed of two parts: one due to convection and the

These numbers correspond to the heat transfer coefficients (hr) of 2.33 and 7 when 
the skin temperature of the cell (Ts) is 40°C, respectively, for steel and a cell with a 
suitable coating to improve radiation. Thus, there is a potential to transfer as much 
as 50% of the heat away from the cell by radiation.
3.5.1.4  Predicting Battery Module and Pack Performance
Building a battery pack is a labor-intensive process and it is expensive to subject 
the battery to several build-and-break cycles. In order to minimize the cost and 
effort, right before the design phase the thermal behavior of the module and/or 
pack is usually simulated in a virtual environment using advanced computational 
tools. This step involves detailed reconstruction of the pack geometry, determining 
the steady-state and transient thermal response of the battery in order to identify 
nonuniform heat accumulation in any part of the pack and to verify compliance 
with the design requirements identified (e.g., the maximum temperature or pressure 
gradients within the pack must be below the specified values). The load estimates 
for the cooling fan or pump are calculated using standard correlations. Another 
advantage of performing the flow simulations is the capability to perform sensitiv-
ity analyses. The design engineer can identify factors that the thermal response of 
the battery is most sensitive to, and as such prioritize these design requirements in 
terms of determining the right control strategy (such as modulating the flow rates 
and inlet fluid temperatures).
3.5.1.5  Designing, Building, and Testing the Preliminary BTMS
Based on the computational analysis, the auxiliary components such as fans, pumps, 
and heat exchangers together with active elements such as the heaters and evapora-
tor coils are suitably sized. The constraints for the control unit, as identified in the 
previous steps, are implemented. A comparison of alternative systems with respect 
to performance, energy requirement, complexity, and maintenance is often carried 
out at this stage. Factors such as ease of operation and reliability of the different 
components are considered when estimating the cost of the BTMS. Once the pre-
liminary design is finalized, a bench-top battery pack is integrated with the thermal 
management unit to validate the results from the simulation phase. Practical limi-
tations on the hardware, such as lead times for the different cooling components 
and maximum offset in the temperature are calibrated. The designer revisits the 
previous steps as often as necessary until the design specifications are accomplished. 
The prototype unit is then subjected to evaluation of the thermal control strategies 
based on the vehicle’s operating environment (e.g., various climactic conditions).

The prototype is installed in a vehicle and the testing is carried out using a vehicle 
dynamometer to simulate the drive conditions.
3.5.2  Optimization
Optimization of the final unit usually requires a few iterations of the steps outlined 
above, considering design factors such as the safely allowable pressure drop and 
temperature range. Other constraints such as impact of the operating temperature 
on battery performance and life, vehicle performance, cost, and ease of maintenance 
are considered at the system level. The following is a design example to optimize the 
flow channel based on the equations shown in the previous section.
Consider the air-cooled channel described above. The range for the hydraulic 
radius and the flow rate shown in Figure 3.22 were obtained from the design objec-
tives. Other constraints usually include a specification of the maximum permissible 
change in temperature across the flow channel (i.e., ΔT1,max) and a preference for 
laminar flow conditions (a specified value for the Reynolds number, e.g., 2,400). 
The heat generation rate—which can be measured using a calorimeter—is set to 
2W, for illustrative purposes. Figure 3.23 shows the bounds imposed by different 
constraints (1) a preferred value for ΔTnet is between 3.5 and 4.5°C, (2) the mini-
mum pressure drop desirable to maintain a ceiling on the parasitic load is 40 kPa, 
(3) the maximum pressure drop that the flow channel can withstand safely is set 
at 110 kPa, (4) the nonuniformity in the cooling channel (ΔT1) should not exceed

1.5°C to ensure good performance of the module, and finally, laminar flow condi-
tions are preferred.
From (3.13)–(3.18), contours corresponding to the pressure and temperature 
bounds can be made similar to those shown in Figure 3.23. In addition, the con-
tours corresponding to a fixed value for ΔT1 (which is independent of the channel 
diameter) and a fixed Reynolds number are superimposed to identify the operating 
window. The smallest channel diameter corresponds to the maximum heat trans-
fer coefficient; this point is shown as A in the figure. Point B corresponds to the 
design with the minimum value for the pressure drop, and point C to the optimum 
design that maximizes the heat transfer coefficient within the maximum allowable 
pressure drop across the channel while keeping the ΔTnet value at its minimum 
specification. A similar analysis for the oil-cooled system is shown in Figure 3.24, 
where the optimum hydraulic diameter is about 3.9 mm and the flow rate is about 
1.18 g/s—much lower than that for the air-cooled channels due to the properties 
of the coolant.
If on the other hand, one were to opt for a phase change material (e.g., wax) 
to remove the heat from the skin of the cells, paraffin wax has a heat of fusion 
of about 200 J/g and a density of 0.82 g/cc in the molten state. About 30% of 
the module volume is accessible for the phase-change material packaging, when 
the hydraulic diameter is 3.9 mm. At the 2W per cell generation rate considered 
above, for a 2C discharge, the average heat generated per cell will be 3.6 kJ over a 
30-minute period. Using the properties for the wax provided above, the minimum

3.5  Desired Attributes of a Thermal Management System 
77
thickness for the phase-change material is 1.44 mm, which leaves 2.5 mm for the 
convective coolant to carry the heat away from the module. From Figures 3.23 and 
3.24, one can see that in order to maintain the pressure drop and hence the mass 
flow rate within acceptable limits, the only viable coolant in this scenario is air.
In the next example, let us consider a staggered arrangement of cells within a 
module, as shown in Figure 3.25, which have a jacket of oil-cooled channels sur-
rounding each cell with the optimal values we just identified, and air-circulated 
through the module.2
For this case, the heat transfer coefficient is obtained from the Nusselt number 
(which is defined as the ratio between the convective to conductive heat transfer 
across the boundary) using the following expression:

Thermal Behavior 
In this example we use 12 cells per row and four rows of cells (i.e., NT = 4); V is 
the volumetric flow rate of air across the module and ST is the transverse pitch as 
shown in Figure 3.26. The constraints to incorporate include a specification of the 
maximum allowable pressure drop, temperature bounds, and minimizing the cost 
of the parasitic load. The temperature of the exit stream (Te) should be as high as 
possible in order to maximize the amount of heat removed from the cell surface but 
at the same time at least 2.5°C cooler than the skin temperature (Ts) for the heat 
transfer to be effective. If the inlet stream temperature (Ti) is assumed to be 20°C 
and the skin temperature on the cells are assumed to be at 30°C, and the maximum 
allowable pressure drop is set at a tenth of an atmosphere (~ 10 kPa); the results are 
shown in Figure 3.26. The cost of the parasitic load is shown on a relative scale—it 
is assumed to vary linearly as the mass flow rate corresponding to the velocity of 
the inlet stream of air for the chosen size of the flow channel, and the values are 
normalized to be set equal to unity at a pressure drop corresponding to 10 kPa and 
the exit stream temperature of 27.5°C, in line with the constraints outlined above. 
A few trade-offs can be read from the chart: if the maximum pressure drop is main-
tained at 10 kPa but the temperature of the exit stream is allowed to be 3°C lower 
than the skin temperature of the cells, the cost of the parasitic load can be reduced 
by 15%, whereas setting this difference to be 2°C increases the cost by 30%. For a

set value of Ts – Te (in our case, 2.5°C), if a higher pressure drop (e.g., 5 kPa) can 
be tolerated, there is a corresponding reduction in the cost (by 5% in this example).
3.6  Conclusions
In summary, the battery pack performance, and thus the performance of an EV or 
HEV, is affected by its operating temperature and the degree of temperature gra-
dient in the pack. Thermal issues are often of concern in a battery pack designed 
for vehicles because of higher power and more aggressive charge/discharge profile. 
Thermal analysis must be performed to properly design thermal management sys-
tems for all electric vehicles. This chapter used fundamental heat transfer principles 
to design thermal management units for individual cells and modules. The tempera-
ture distribution depends strongly on the properties of the coolant and the design 
of the flow channels. A pack with no convection can reach unacceptably high tem-
perature levels. Even with reasonable air flow rates, the temperature in the pack can 
vary significantly. Attention must be given to proper thermal design of the modules 
and packs. The last example indicates that adding ventilation holes improves the 
thermal performance of a battery module installed on a vehicle.

Battery Life 
Energy and power of electrochemical storage systems fade due to multiple degrada-
tion mechanisms, some of which are related to cycling, but others which are related 
to time. To accurately predict life across a range of scenarios, sometimes five to 10 
degradation mechanisms must be characterized and modeled, but often just a few 
mechanisms dominate.
Chapter 2 used a simple example to conceptualize a battery electrode as a 
container of water.  Water height in the container represented electrochemical po-
tential, while water volume represented stored charge. Taking this example a bit 
further to include degradation, the water “battery” can degrade either due to loss 
of water from the system (i.e., loss of the charge shuttle in the battery) or due to 
shrinking or deforming the water storage container, representing electrical isolation 
or chemical/phase change of active material in the electrode.
4.1  Overview
For well-designed, mature Li-ion systems, dominant degradation mechanisms in-
clude solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film growth on the negative electrode that 
consumes cycleable Li—the charge shuttle—from the system. Growth of SEI causes 
both battery resistance growth and capacity loss. The rate of SEI growth with time 
accelerates with high temperature and high state of charge (SOC). For Li-ion ap-
plications with frequent, deep cycling, electrode active material loss/isolation may 
dominate. The rate of material loss with each cycle depends on depth of discharge 
(DOD) and C-rate. Material loss is a common fade mechanism for emerging high 
energy density battery chemistries whose electrode active materials experience large 
expansion and contraction during cycling.
4.1.1  Physics
Characterized by their physics, failure modes may be:
1.	 Mechanically induced (e.g., gas buildup or vibration leading to packaging 
failure);
2.	 Chemically induced (e.g., chemical reactions that proceed with time, with 
rate dependent on temperature and chemical state);

82 
�������������
Battery Life 
3.	 Electrochemically induced (e.g., side reactions driven or accelerated by 
electrochemical (dis)charge processes);
4.	 Electrochemomechanically induced (e.g., material failure associated with 
volumetric changes and mechanical stresses caused by electrochemical (dis)
charge process reactions);
5.	 Thermal coupling of all of the above.
Regarding purely mechanical-induced failures not related to the electrochemical 
state, these can be characterized with traditional accelerated vibration testing and 
structural analysis.
Regarding chemical and electrochemical fade mechanisms—whether they in-
volve electron transfer or not—both proceed due to reaction processes. The dis-
tinction between chemical and electrochemical degradation is purely conceptual, 
as an aid to determine whether the degradation is more related to calendar time or 
number of cycles.
Across all mechanisms, thermal behavior plays an important role, with chemi-
cal, electrochemical, and mechanical degradation rates tightly coupled to temper-
ature. Chemical and electrochemical reaction rates and transport properties are 
highly temperature-dependent, as are mechanical strength and elasticity properties. 
Differential expansion and contraction of cell components with temperature also 
causes thermally induced mechanical stress. Methods to predict battery thermal 
response, discussed in Chapter 3, are a necessary tool for life prediction. 
4.1.2  Calendar Life Versus Cycle Life
It is common to think of battery useful lifetime in terms of number of charge/
discharge cycles. For example, one might expect a battery to last for 1,000 cycles 
before reaching end of life (EOL). Commonly EOL is defined using some measure 
of faded performance relative to beginning of life (BOL). However it is important 
to recognize that battery chemistries may also degrade even when not in use due to 
unwanted chemical reactions. For batteries spending much of their lifetime in stor-
age, such as with standby batteries for uninterruptible power supplies, time spent 
at a given temperature and SOC will often dictate application lifetime. Different 
battery chemistries each have different sweet spots for achieving long calendar life. 
Li-ion chemistries last longest when stored at partial SOC. Lead-acid chemistries 
last longest when stored at full SOC. Both chemistries suffer from short calendar 
life at hot temperatures, > 40°C.
The goal of aging tests is to characterize, as quickly as possible, degradation 
mechanisms across the anticipated range of duty-cycles and temperatures. Tests are 
designed to accelerate the rate of these mechanisms, compressing the time needed 
for testing. Given aging data, lifetime predictive models are then used to extrapo-
late performance fade forward in time to some EOL condition. It is not straightfor-
ward how to extrapolate cycling results that were compressed into, say, 6 months, 
to a relevant performance fade prediction at, say year 5 or year 10 for the actual 
device application. In order to extrapolate forward in time, a lifetime model must 
properly separate and/or capture interdependencies of cycling- and calendar-de-

pendent degradation mechanisms. Further attention to this subject is given later in 
this chapter.
Calendar life expresses the theoretical lifetime of a battery when sitting at rest 
at a given temperature and SOC. Cycle life is a term mainly associated with the ag-
ing of a battery during repeated charge/discharge. Cycle life is always related to the 
specific cycling protocol used during the test, particularly the severity of the (dis)
charge cycle. Less intuitive but still important, cycle life also depends on the state 
of the battery during rest periods interspersed between cycles.
In the test environment, calendar-dependent degradation is commonly mea-
sured using storage tests accelerated with temperature and mapped versus SOC, as 
shown in Figure 4.1, produced using the graphite/NCA life model. This model is 
further discussed in Section 7.7. Cycle-dependent degradation is characterized by 
subjecting the battery to back-to-back cycles with little rest. Conducting additional 
aging experiments that vary the amount of rest between cycles helps to separate 
calendar  from cycling degradation and establish possible couplings between the 
two that need to be accounted for in a lifetime model. Figure 4.2 shows the perfor-
mance fade with cycling at several values of DOD, and number of cycles per year. 
The average SOC of the cell across its lifetime is held constant in these simulations.
It is critical when extrapolating cycle-life predictions from test data to also in-
clude appropriate calendar-life limiting terms in the extrapolation model.
4.1.3  Regions of Performance Fade
Mature electrochemical storage technologies will experience gradual capacity and 
resistance changes throughout life, with fade rate dependent on duty-cycle, temper-
ature, and age. Figure 4.3 shows an example of nonlinear performance fade com-

mon for Li-ion cells. In this example, performance fade processes may be separated 
into several regions:
Region I: Break-in region, dependent on initial cycles. Figure 4.3 shows a 
slight initial performance increase, though a slight performance decrease is also 
possible.
Region II: Decelerating fade region, strongly dependent on calendar aging pro-
cesses and moderately dependent on cycling.
Region III: Accelerating fade region, strongly dependent on cycling.
Actual lifetime performance data always contains noise, and compared to Fig-
ure 4.3, the transitions between regions will be less apparent. For example, the 
transition between regions II and III may be more gradual and appear as a linear

chronous orbit application. (Reproduced from [2].)

85
region of fade processes. Depending on the aging condition, some regions in Figure 
4.3 may not exist at all. Under severe cycling for example, regions I and II may be 
absent, leaving only the accelerating fade, region III.
Prior to the application of a device, as part of the manufacturing process, Li-ion 
cells undergo formation cycles at the factory. These cycles are typically conducted 
at low (dis)charge rates and elevated temperature. Formation cycles establish an 
initial SEI layer or surface film at the negative electrode surface, consuming some 
cycleable Li from the system and causing a loss of up to 10% capacity during the 
first few cycles.
During the break-in region, cells can experience performance changes ranging 
from rapid decrease to slight increase in initial performance, as shown in Figure 
4.3. Rapid decrease could result from incomplete formation cycles at the manufac-
turing plant, or under high temperatures could simply be rapid SEI growth due. 
Slight increase in capacity is possible in systems containing excess lithium that may 
be released during initial cycles. Slight decreases in resistance may result from small 
fractures opening in electrode active materials, introducing new surface area to the 
system and relieving some of the residual mechanical stresses of the manufacturing 
process.  Generally, increases in initial performance are only evident at moderate to 
low temperatures.  The existence of break-in processes complicates the identifica-
tion of fade rates from the first weeks or months of cell aging experiments.
The decelerating fade region II is the ideal place for the battery to spend its 
lifetime. In Li-ion batteries, SEI growth is an example mechanism whose growth 
rate slows with age. As SEI grows in thickness, the diffusion rate of chemical spe-
cies from the electrolyte through the film to the negative surface slows down. Dif-
fusion limited reactions fade track with ~ t1/2, giving a decelerating performance 
fade trajectory. Kinetic-limited chemical reactions may initially track with ~ t, but 
also slow down or stabilize as reservoirs of chemical species are consumed in the 
reactions effect. 
Figure 4.3  Example of performance fade during lifetime.

86 
�������������
Battery Life 
Eventually though, some accelerating process will likely overtake the graceful 
fade. Such processes can be chemical, although for a mature, stable system are gen-
erally electrochemical or electrochemomechanical-dependent. An example chemi-
cal process causing accelerating fade is Mn dissolution/SEI growth in the graphite/
LiyMn2O4 Li-ion system. Once Mn dissolves, it can migrate through the electrolyte 
to the graphite-negative electrode, where the Mn serves as a catalyst for faster SEI 
growth.
Due to electrode material loss or cycleable Li loss, the electrochemical window 
of positive and negative electrodes can shift relative to one another, introducing 
some new side reaction that was previously not a problem. For example if negative 
electrode loss outpaces cycleable Li loss, Li plating may begin to occur late in the 
battery’s life during low temperature charging. 
An example of mechanical-coupled processes that cause accelerating fade in 
Li-ion systems is mechanical damage to the SEI/electrode accelerating SEI growth/
electrolyte decomposition. Another is active material loss/isolation that is acceler-
ated as fewer remaining sites are stressed at greater levels for the same cycling 
profile.
4.1.4  End of Life
For a given application, the designer must size the battery such that power/energy 
requirements are met all throughout lifetime. In an actual application, failure will 
be first noticed at the limits of system design points, such as for the combination of 
discharge at high rates, cold temperatures, and/or low SOC extremes. This means 
power/energy requirements must be met at EOL under worst-case cold tempera-
ture. It is sometimes said that automotive batteries die during the summer, but their 
funeral is held in the winter.
EOL criteria differ for energy versus power applications and for individual cells 
versus complete battery pack systems.  EOL for energy applications is commonly 
taken as when the device’s useable energy fades to 70% to 80% of original energy. 
Useable energy is primarily influenced primarily by capacity loss but is also influ-
enced by power fade. For example, consider an EV application where sufficient 
discharge power for vehicle acceleration is available at 5% SOC at BOL. At EOL, 
that same discharge power might only be available above 15% SOC. Capacity loss 
of, say 20%, plus this extra 10% of useable energy loss due to power fade, would 
bring the device to EOL with remaining useable energy at 70% of BOL.
EOL for power applications is commonly taken as when the device’s useable 
power fades to 70% to 80% of original power. Again, remaining energy plays a 
role. The power needs of the application must be met across some useable energy 
range to meet the longest duration power draw requirement of the application, 
with some margin. For an HEV, this might be dictated by a worst-case drive cycle, 
with several repeated acceleration events lasting 5 to 10 seconds each.
Periodically during battery aging tests, the aging (dis)charge cycle is interrupted 
to run reference performance tests (RPTs). The RPT objective is to map useable 
power and energy changes over the duration of the aging test. Figure 4.3 shows an 
example of power-mapped versus SOC using the hybrid pulse power characteriza-
tion (HPPC) test protocol discussed in Chapter 2. At BOL, the power needs are 
met over a wide energy range, 52% ΔSOC. At EOL, pulse power capability and 

4.1  Overview 
87
total energy have shrunk, reducing the useable energy range capable of meeting the 
application’s power requirement to a narrow window, 12% ΔSOC in Figure 4.4.
The designer must trade off system design with device lifetime. Overdesigning a 
system with excess energy and power or with a powerful thermal management sys-
tem will equate to longer life, albeit with penalties of extra cost, mass, and volume. 
Design trade-offs are commonly conducted to meet both years of life and number 
of cycles requirements for some reasonably aggressive (i.e., 95th percentile) duty 
cycle and environment.
Designing a battery with excessive energy usually leads to greater incremental 
cell cost than sizing with excessive power. As a rule of thumb, size battery pack ex-
cess energy as small as possible within the margin of error of life-predictive models 
and oversize on power to maximize the amount of energy that is useable, particu-
larly late in life.
4.1.5  Extending Cell Life Prediction to Pack Level
Differential aging of cells in a pack or large system may occur for several reasons. 
Cell manufacturing variability causes cell BOL performance differences and slight 
aging process differences. Differential aging is also driven by temperature gradients 
across cells in a pack. Depending on pack electrical configuration, cell balancing 
system topologies and possible active switching of individual series strings, cells, or 
strings may experience different electrical (dis)charge cycles that can impact aging. 
Cell balancing is further discussed in Chapter 7.
Cell aging models introduced in this chapter may be extended to pack-level by 
capturing cell BOL and aging process differences using Monte Carlo techniques 
overlaid with models that predict cell electrical and thermal imbalances during 
cycling (see Chapters 2 and 3, respectively).
Once each individual cells’ performance fade characteristics are estimated, 
their individual resistances and capacities can be combined to determine impact on 
Figure 4.4  For pulse-power application, useable energy window meeting (dis)charge power re-
quirements will shrink over lifetime due to resistance growth and capacity loss.

Pack capacity will vary depending on whether the pack utilizes a passive or active

The remainder of this chapter discusses gradual cell-level performance fade 
due to electrochemical/thermal/mechanical degradation processes leading to EOL. 
However, infant mortality due to “bad” cells or sudden system failures are also 
possible. This is particularly true in a complex system with hundreds or thousands 
of cells, tens of sensors, wiring harnesses and connectors, battery management sys-
tem circuitry, cooling systems fans, pumps, and cooling fluids. Failure modes of 
each of these system components must be comprehensively addressed through fail-
ure modes, effects, and criticality analysis (FMECA).

nates due to various physical mechanisms that play out at length-scales ranging 
from micron-sized electrode active particles to the length-scale of cell packaging.
Chemical, electrochemical, and mechanical-coupled degradation rates are each 
differently addressed while a cell is being designed. Chemical degradation processes 
may be slowed by modifying the electrochemical recipe, introducing electrolyte 
additives to stabilize reactions, or coating electrode particles to provide a barrier 
to inhibit reactivity at the particle surface. Electrochemical degradation processes 
may be modified by shifting or limiting the electrochemical window over which the 
material is cycled. Chemical and electrochemical reaction rates may also be con-
trolled by electrode surface area. Larger particles with less surface area are good for 
slowing the rate of chemical reactions. Small particles with large surface area are 
best for promoting facile electrochemical reactions in high-power systems. Hence, 
a trade-off between calendar life and performance exists when selecting electrode 
particle size. Mechanical-coupled degradation may be influenced by tuning particle 
morphology, optimizing cell packaging and manufacturing processes.

Once the cell is fielded, the specific cycling, temperature, and pressure history 
of the cell will dictate its lifetime.
4.1.7  Common Degradation Mechanisms in Li-ion Cells
Lithium-ion cells can experience all of the fade mechanisms noted in Table 4.2. 
Before discussing specific mechanisms in detail, Figure 4.5 shows an overview of 
the typical electrochemical operating window for a Li-ion battery. For negative elec-
trodes that operate at a working potential below ~1.1V (Li/Li+), such as graphite 
depicted in the figure, the electrolyte will continuously reduce throughout life form-
ing and continuously growing the SEI film layer on the negative. Operating any 
negative electrode material at potentials below 0V vs Li can cause lithium plating 
on the surface of the negative. All well-known Li-ion electrolytes suffer from insta-
bility and cannot operate at cell potentials above 4.3 to 4.4V without oxidizing at 
the positive electrode. This inhibits the introduction of several promising candidate

high voltage Li-ion positive electrodes. Energy density of Li-ion systems could be 
increased if some new electrolyte or surface coating could be identified that allows 
higher operating potentials.  Finally, in Figure 4.5, charge/discharge cycles are as-
sociated with stresses of “electrode breathing” as materials shrink and expand.
High temperature and high end-of-charge voltage (EoCV) accelerate many of 
the reactions below. As rules of thumb, a 15°C increase in temperature or a 0.1V in-
crease in EoCV will cut life in half. Low temperature may also accelerate degrada-
tion. Slow transport of Li-ions at low temperature leads to excessive concentration 
gradients in active particles that cause Li plating and particle fracture.

4.1  Overview

4.1.7.1  SEI Formation and Growth
The solid electrolyte interphase layer is critical to the operation of Li-ion batter-
ies utilizing graphite, silicon, and other low-voltage negative electrodes. Graphite 
electrodes for example operate in a potential window 0 to 300 mV above a lithium 
reference electrode (Li+/Li), whereas typical organic-based electrolytes are unstable 
below 1.3V (Li+/Li).
Due to this incompatibility, electrolyte products are reduced at the surface of 
the negative electrode. A few negative electrode active materials operate in a high-
er-voltage window and largely avoid SEI formation. An example is lithium titanate, 
operating at ~1.5V (Li/Li+).  Such high-voltage negative electrodes provide longer 
potential calendar life, but at the cost of energy density due to lower overall cell 
operating voltage.
System-level consequences of SEI growth are (1) sharp initial drop in capacity 
during formation cycles (irreversible), followed thereafter by (2) gradual loss of 
cycleable Li causing capacity loss (irreversible), and (3) growth of impedance film 
layer on negative surface causing power loss (irreversible, although film layer can 
be damaged leading to temporary recovery of power), as well as (4) self discharge 
(partly reversible).
The typical model of SEI growth assumes that an electrolyte-solvent species 
(e.g., ethylene carbonate (C3H4O3)) diffuses through the SEI and is reduced at the 
graphite/SEI interface to form lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) [5] and/or ethylene di-
carbonate ((CH2OCO2Li)2) [6]. Of these two reactions, the former consumes cycle-
able Li from the negative electrode; the latter consumes Li+ from the electrolyte 
salt.
In these models, SEI growth rate is limited by diffusion of the solvent and/or ki-
netics of the one-electron reduction of EC molecules. The diffusion rate-limitation 
is well supported by data for multiple Li-ion chemistries, where performance fade 
tracks closely with ~t0.5. A mixed diffusion-kinetic rate limitation is also possible, 
with fade ~ tz, 0.5 < z < 1. Over the long term, availability of Li-ions, electrons, and 
other participating species may also play a limiting role.
SEI formation is an important step in Li-ion manufacturing. Formation cycles 
are conducted with initial charging at very low C-rate to avoid cointercalation of 
solvent into the active material along with Li-ions. As shown in Figure 4.6, solvent 
cointercalation can cause exfoliation or cracking of graphene layers, as well as 
excessive gas generation.
The initial formed SEI layer may have a dense compact structure influenced 
by electrolyte additives such as vinelyne carbonate. In all, chemistry, surface mor-
phology, treatments, coatings, C-rate, and temperature are used to tune SEI initial 
formation.
Once the cell is placed into service, SEI growth will proceed in a stable man-
ner throughout lifetime controlled by transport or kinetic processes. If limited by a 
diffusion transport process, SEI growth proceeds with square-root-of-time depen-
dence. A mixed diffusion/kinetic-limited process may proceed slightly faster. A spe-
cies-limited growth or SEI-densification process may cause SEI growth to proceed 
slightly slower. During this stable phase, SEI growth rate is mainly influenced and 
accelerated by high temperature and high state of charge in the negative electrode. 
Charge rate plays a role.

92 
�������������
Battery Life 
Beyond the stable phase, SEI growth rate can accelerate causing more sudden 
performance fade due to 
••
Catalysis of SEI reaction(s) by impurities such as manganese or copper de-
posited on the negative electrode surface.
••
Mechanical-coupled processes such as surface exfoliation and SEI 
microcracking.
••
SEI dissolution into electrolyte if exposed to high temperatures (> 60°C). At 
low temperatures, dissolved SEI can re-precipitate in pores, inhibiting ionic 
transport.
In addition to dissolution, brief high-temperature exposure can cause rapid dam-
age. Exothermic reactions, possible precursors to thermal runaway, may occur 
above 80°C. High temperature may also initiate chemical conversion of organic SEI 
to inorganic products that are more stable but greatly impede Li+ ionic transport.
4.1.7.2  Lithium Plating
Lithium plating can occur on the negative electrode due to a preferential electro-
chemical reaction that deposits metallic Li on the electrode surface as opposed to the 
normal intercalation or conversion reaction process. Plating occurs during charg-
ing at a potential window < 0V vs Li+/Li.  Similar to SEI formation and growth, 
low-voltage negative electrodes will experience Li-plating more readily than high-
voltage negative electrodes.
Li-plating may be purely kinetically controlled, competing with the normal 
charge transfer process at high charge rates. But given that the kinetic overpotential 
of graphite intercalation reaction is small, it is most common for Li plating to occur 
Figure 4.6  SEI formation and growth processes. (Reproduced from [7].)

4.1  Overview 
93
when graphite surface concentrations are saturated with Li at full charge where 
equilibrium potential of graphite approaches zero. If both effects are combined, Li 
plating is most likely to occur at cold temperatures where diffusion from particle 
surface to bulk is sluggish and at high charge rates. Kinetic and diffusion-transport 
processed are depicted in Figure 4.7.
Of the Li that is plated on the negative surface, a portion may be discharged 
reversibly and an open-circuit voltage of 0V vs Li+/Li, while some portion will be 
irreversibly lost. Plated Li that becomes disconnected from the electrode will result 
in irreversible capacity fade and reaction with the electrolyte. Reaction with the 
electrolyte can be an exothermic precursor to thermal runaway. This is most likely 
for cold-temperature charging followed by sudden warming.
Plating will preferentially occur at sharp corners of electrode particles, near 
the separator, or in inhomogeneous regions of the electrode coating. These are 
all regions of the cell where local electronic conduction is much faster than ionic 
conduction relative to neighboring regions region. Once Li begins to plate, it grows 
in the form of a dendrite, continually plating at the tip of the dendrite due to the 
excellent electronic conductivity of the dendrite.
Another preferential location for Li plating is at the edge of a negative electrode 
sheet.  Mismatch between positive and negative electrode sheets, for example, can 
result in excess positive at some location in the cell. During charging that region of 
positive will provide a source of Li without sufficient negative host material to ac-
cept the Li. Li will then plate at the edge of the negative electrode sheet. Li plating at 
electrode edges is easily mitigated by making the negative electrode sheets slightly 
larger than the positive sheets so they overhang a millimeter or so to accommodate 
manufacturing intolerances during electrode stacking/winding processes.
As shown in Figure 4.8, lithium dendrites take the form of a thin whisker struc-
ture that branches. The thin structure can penetrate the separator, growing within 
the pores. Should a dendrite fully bridge across the separator from the negative 
to the positive electrode, the cell will experience an internal short. If the dendrite 
does not burn itself out, the internal short may generate enough heating to lead to 
thermal runaway.

4.1.7.3  Binder Decomposition
Polyvinylidene-difluoride (PVdF) and other fluorine-containing polymer binders 
may react with the negative electrode to form LiF. High temperatures can damage 
binder, degrading its mechanical properties. Viscoelastic creep or slight displace-
ment of electrode particles may occur under cycling-induced stress and can occur at 
temperatures well below the glass transition temperature of the binder.
Binder decomposition damages particle-to-particle and particle-to-collector 
adhesive strength. Coupled with cycling, portions of the electrode may detach and 
become electrically isolated. 
4.1.7.4  Current Collector Corrosion
Current collector materials are selected to be compatible with the electrochemical 
voltage window of each electrode. For Li-ion cells, materials are typically copper 
for the negative and aluminum for the positive.
If copper is exposed to high positive voltage vs Li+/Li, for example if the cell is 
left in an overdischarged state, >3V vs Li+/Li, copper may dissolve into the electro-
lyte [10], contaminate the negative electrode surface, and serve as a catalyst for ac-
celerated SEI growth. Corrosion can be accelerated by presence of impurities such 
as H2O and HF in the electrolyte.
Corrosion will also damage the mechanical adhesive strength of the electrode 
to the collector. Such damage may lead to delamination and isolation of the elec-
trode from the collector. Aluminum and other collectors may be precoated with 
graphite to improve stability and adhesion.
4.1.7.5  Electrolyte Decomposition
Electrolyte can be reduced at the negative electrode during SEI formation and 
growth as Li+ is consumed. For LiPF6 salt systems, PF6 may be converted to HF 
in presence of moisture. Electrolyte additives serving as HF scavengers reduce

consequences of HF acid attack on electrodes that can decompose surface film lay-
ers and dissolve metals from metal-oxide positive electrodes. 
Electrolyte can oxidize at the positive electrode when accelerated at high volt-
ages. The oxide layer acts as a resistive surface film on the positive. Both reduction 
and oxidation reactions cause gas generation. The reactions are accelerated with 
high SOC, temperature, and charge rate.
4.1.7.6  Metal-Oxide Positive Electrode Decomposition
Metal-oxide positive electrodes can experience chemical decomposition. Typical 
metal-oxide electrodes in Li-ion batteries include LiMn2O4, LiCoO2, Li(NiaMnbCo1-
a-b)O2, and Li(NiaCobAl1-a-b)O2, respectively referred to as LMO, LCO, NMC, 
and NCA. This is in contrast to graphitic negative electrodes and (FEP) positive 
electrodes whose chemical composition is quite stable. 
Decomposition occurs due to disordering, lattice instability, dissolution, and 
other surface effects. Disordering and lattice distortion chemical changes may be 
coupled with electrochemical and mechanical processes.
Disordering. Metal oxides can experiencing a structural disordering reaction in 
which metal ions exchange sites with lithium ions, degrading the material’s ability 
to intercalate Li. Pure LiNiO2 is unstable in this manner. Doping with aluminum 
(Al) or cobalt (Co) largely stabilizes the material.  Site exchange of manganese 
(Mn) and Li has also been reported (see Figure 4.9).
Lattice instability. For all metal-oxide positive electrodes, the low stoichiom-
etry/high voltage range is thermodynamically unstable, rendering some 30% to 
50% of the theoretical capacity unusable.  Approaching full delithiation, Li(metal)
O2 materials transition from monoclinic to hexagonal phase with large volume 
change, causing the lattice to collapse. For LMO, the high stoichiometry range, 
corresponding to a discharged cell, is also unstable. By discharging the cell too low, 
fully intercalated LMO can accept additional Li and a Mn3+ Jahn-Teller distorted

tetragonal phase is formed without the ability to reverse back to the nominal spinel 
structure when the cell is recharged.
Dissolution. Chemical dissolution of transition metals may occur, particularly 
at extremes of charge or discharge. While Co dissolution does not cause great con-
sequences for performance fade, Mn is a known catalyst for accelerated SEI growth 
once it inevitably migrates/deposits on the negative electrode, as shown in Figure 
4.10. Co may dissolve from LiCoO2 if charged above 4.2V vs Li+/Li. Manganese 
can dissolve under several scenarios. In the discharged state, trivalent Mn ions dis-
proportionate into tetravalent and divalent ions:

Divalent Mn ions are soluble and dissolve into the electrolyte. Missing Mn sites are 
replaced with Li leading to an impedance film on the positive electrode surface. Mn 
may also dissolve in a chemical delithiation reaction with HF, a byproduct of LiPF6 
salt reaction with H2O impurity [11].
Overall, the rate of dissolution processes can be mitigated by reducing surface 
area, doping, or mixing materials (such as LMO mixed NCA or LCO), and by 
including electrolyte additives that act as HF scavengers.

duced from [11].)

4.1  Overview 
97
Surface effects. Surface impedance layer has been shown for NCA and other 
nickelate materials, particularly when charged to voltages above 4.2V vs Li+/Li. 
These effects may be attributed to electrolyte oxidation at the surface, LiPF6 de-
composition and/or oxygen loss leading to a deficient oxide phase at the surface, 
possibly a rock-salt structure with low Li+ ionic conductance. Gases such as oxy-
gen (O), carbon dioxide (Co2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon (C), and hydrogen 
(H) can evolve due to the various side reactions at the positive surface.
4.1.7.7  SEI Fracture and Reformation
Active material particles expand and contract during (de)intercalation and/or 
electrochemical conversion processes. With expansion and contraction of the ac-
tive particle lattice, chemically stable surface films can experience microcracking. 
Cracks in surface films provide new sites for additional reaction. While electro-
chemical growth of SEI is predominantly calendar-dependent, SEI fracture and ref-
ormation is a typical cause for acceleration of calendar fade processes with mild to 
moderate cycling. Aside from SEI fracture due to particle strain, particle-to-particle 
displacements due to binder viscoelastic creep may also open up new sites for SEI 
growth, causing cycling-dependent acceleration of nominally calendar-dependent 
side reactions.
4.1.7.8  Particle Fracture
Intercalation- or conversion-induced lattice expansion/contraction can cause crack 
development in negative and positive electrode active materials. Particle strain, 
stress, and fracture is driven by bulk changes in SOC as well as concentration gra-
dients. Bulk strains due to changes in SOC are a consequence of ΔSOC swings ex-
perienced during (dis)charge processes, largely unavoidable. Phase change regions 
of the ΔSOC—with large strains and lattice distortions—might be avoided during 
cycling. Concentration gradient or diffusion-induced strains are exacerbated by 
high C-rates and low temperatures. 
This degradation mode is a major cause for faster degradation of cell perfor-
mance with deep (dis)charge cycling. Partial (dis)charge cycles cause less mechani-
cal stress than full cycles.
The order of magnitude of volume change during full discharge and charge is 
around 5% for metal-oxide positive electrodes, 10% for graphitic negative elec-
trodes, and 300% for silicon negative electrodes. High-strain materials obviously 
experience greater stress and fracture. This continuous stress and fracture process 
during electrochemical cycling is commonly referred to as electrochemical grinding.
Silicon and many other high-energy density electrodes under investigation un-
fortunately rely on electrochemical grinding to operate. Their high energy den-
sity comes at the price of limited cycle life due to large volume expansion. SEI 
is constantly damaged and regrown, continuously consuming cycleable Li from 
the system, degrading capacity. Nonetheless, composites of silicon and graphite, 
Si nanoparticles, and various other nanostructures may improve mechanical resil-
ience to cycling.
Particle fracture failures will occur when particle regions are in tension, not 
compression. Tension will occur at the outer edge of a particle when deintercalated 

98 
�������������
Battery Life 
at a high rate. Tension will occur in the center region of a particle when intercalated 
at a high rate. Fracture zones will have poor solid-state diffusion transport proper-
ties due to breach of the particle lattice. Alternately, fractured regions may also act 
as new pores, absorb electrolyte, and provide favorable ionic transport paths.
4.1.7.9  Electrode Displacement and Fracture
Stress and fracture can also play out at the electrode-level and higher length-scales. 
Stresses may be intercalation- or conversion-induced, thermally induced by variable 
thermal expansion rates of cell components, influenced by gas generation stressing 
the cell electrode stack or wound jellyroll. Such failures often are apparent at edges 
of electrodes or at center core regions of cylindrical wound cells where high tem-
peratures and high stresses are superimposed.
Electrode displacement and fracture is exacerbated by binder failure, current 
collector corrosion, and surface film growth mechanisms mentioned earlier. Me-
chanical degradation relieves some of the residual stresses of manufacturing during 
jellyroll winding/stacking and electrolyte filling. Electrolyte filling causes separa-
tors and binders to swell some 10%.
As with binder failure, current collector corrosion, and surface film growth, 
regions of fractured electrodes will have locally poor electronic conductivity. Poor 
electronic conductivity causes remaining healthy regions of the cell to be cycled 
at progressively higher and higher rates. Inhomogenous (dis)charge elevates the 
stresses on remaining active sites and promotes the occurrence of detrimental side 
reactions, both accelerating fade.
4.1.7.10  Separator Viscoelastic Creep
Polymer and polymer-composite separators have viscoelastic mechanical proper-
ties. In the short term, behavior is elastic, meaning that deformation will recover 
when stress is removed. Under constant stress, however, such as in a tightly wound 
jellyroll or compressed electrode stack, separator material can flow over time. Flow 
of separator material can close pores and impede transport of charged species in the 
electrolyte such as Li+.
4.1.7.11  Gas Buildup, Electrode Isolation
Gas generation is a consequence of electrolyte reduction/oxidation side reactions 
at the electrode surfaces. Gas generation causes pressure buildup that imparts me-
chanical stresses on electrodes and cell components. During life, gas generation will 
cause expansion of cell packaging and cell internal components. Porous electrodes 
and separators may hold some gas bubbles. The remaining gases are stored in empty 
spaces in the cell packaging. Both effects can cause cells to noticeably expand over 
lifetime. Delamination of local regions of the electrode will accelerate stress of the 
remaining healthy regions of the cell, causing rapid performance fade.
In the extreme, excessive gas generation will trigger the cell to vent. Hard metal 
can packages are designed to release gases through purpose-designed vents. The 
failure point of soft pouch cells can be somewhat tuned through pouch or module 
design. Clearly, cell venting will lead to electrolyte dryout and rapid performance

decline. A danger with any cell venting is that LiPF6 salt will react with moisture in 
air to form HF, a carcinogen. Li-ion electrolytes are flammable. 
4.2  Modeling 
This section discusses models of cycle and calendar fade based on chemical, electro-
chemical, and electrochemical-mechanical mechanisms. It is rarely known a priori 
what degradation mechanisms must be included in a life model for a specific cell 
technology. Often several alternative degradation mechanisms must be hypothe-
sized, formulated in a model, and confirmed/refuted based on statistical accuracy of 
the model compared with available data.
Section 4.2.1 discusses physics-based degradation models, with examples fo-
cusing on Li-ion systems. Physics degradation models complement electrochemis-
try models of Chapter 2. Section 4.2.2 discusses semiempirical degradation models 
that complement equivalent circuit and systems models.
Physics-based degradation models offer predictive capability and extensibility 
across chemistries, as well as insight on how to improve cell design. Physics models, 
however, are complex to develop and characterize from aging experiments.
For the system designer, semiempirical models provide a more straightforward 
approach to predict life from accelerated aging experiments. Given sufficient aging 
test data to populate semiempirical models, such models are useful for trade-off 
studies between battery excess energy/power sizing, lifetime/warranty, tempera-
ture, and allowable (dis)charge protocol. Included in discussion of systems engi-
neering, Chapter 7 presents example aging test data and describes regression of 
semiempirical life models to data.
4.2.1  Physics-Based
A physics-based life model builds on the electrochemical performance model in-
troduced in Chapter 2 by introducing rate laws that describe property changes of 
the performance model over the course of simulated lifetime. In rough order of 
importance, Table 4.3 lists common electrochemical model parameters that change 
versus lifetime. These parameters of the performance model serve as states of the 
life model. Life-model states effectively contain the minimum set of information 
needed to define battery health and performance at any point during lifetime.
Example degradation rate laws for the SEI film thickness on the surface of the 
negative electrode, volume fractions on the negative and positive volume fractions, 
respectively (δfilm,n, εn, and εp) are given in the next sections.
4.2.1.1  Reaction/Transport Models
Reactions at the negative electrode are presented as an example of mixed kinetic/
transport-limited electrochemical thermal reactions. Figure 4.11 summarizes re-
actions occurring at the negative electrode. Whereas the electrochemical perfor-

Kinetics
Common practice is to model the intercalation reaction using Butler-Volmer kinet-
ics, with irreversible side reactions described with Tafel kinetics.1 The intercalation 
reaction follows
1.	
The Butler-Volmer formulism is most commonly used to capture electrochemical charge transfer. Strictly 
speaking, the Butler-Volmer approach cannot consider multiple reactions in a thermodynamically con-
sistent manner. Full treatment requires solving a system of microscopically reversible [13, 14], including 
both charge-neutral heterogeneous reactions and charge-transfer reactions. Rate equations are written for 
heterogeneous phase change reactions, such as adsorption of a liquid electrolyte species onto an electrode 
surface. Additional species conservation equations must be solved for surface sites and vacancies as site 
concentrations are required to solve reaction rates.

lattice dislocation.
4.2.1.2  Mechanical Stress
Coulombic-throughput or energy-throughput are sometimes used as proxies to de-
scribe mechanical stress-induced fade and are regressed to experimental capacity 
data [15]. These models are difficult to extend to a wide range of cycling conditions 
[16].
Mechanical stress effects have been modeled at length scales ranging from par-
ticle level to electrode sandwich level [9, 17], cell level [18, 24], and pack level [19]. 
Particle stress investigations have shown, for example, possible failure during fast-
rate charging where intercalation-rate of Li into a negative electrode active particle 
drives a faster rate of expansion at the outer radii of the particle, generating high-
tensile stress in the inner core that may lead to fracture, as shown in Figure 4.12(a). 
During deintercalation, high-tensile stress occurs at the outside of the particle; see 
Figure 4.12(b).
Overall, stresses may be concentration, temperature, or pressure/force induced. 
Summarized in Figure 4.13, sources of stress that influence cell electrochemical 
performance and lifetime include
••
Residual stress of manufacturing (e.g., jellyroll winding tension, cell packag-
ing, binder and separator swelling during electrolyte filling processes);
••
External loads and forces (e.g., packaging of cells within modules and 
packs, possible vibration or impact loads on battery packs in the application 
environment);

104 
�������������
Battery Life 
••
Stresses during (dis)charge processes (e.g., material expansion/contraction 
with concentration and temperature);
••
Changes during lifetime (e.g., gas pressure buildup, damage of composite 
material with accompanying changes in mechanical properties).
Figure 4.12   (a) High rate charge of negative particles leads to tensile stress and fracture evolution

lines within the particle represent regions of fracture. (Reproduced with permission from the Elec-
trochemical Society [20].)

Some of the above analyses may be treated using finite element models to analyze 
the solid mechanics behavior of the cell and its components, neglecting details of 
electrochemical cycling. For a lifetime predictive model, however, it is desirable to 
predict accumulated damage and performance fade associated with micromechani-
cal stresses.  The discrete element method (DEM) is one practical method to study 
micromechanical stress and fracture as it evolves with charge/discharge cycles. Such 
a model has been implemented at the active material particle length-scale [11] al-
though the model may need to include higher length scales to capture all relevant 
mechanical degradation mechanisms influencing cell lifetime. It is more typical in 
the literature to introduce empirical equations that relate cycling current or C-rate 
with loss of negative and positive active material, dεn/dt and dεp/dt, respectively 
[21].

4.2.2  Semiempirical Models
Surrogate models of physical degradation mechanisms may be written as simple 
formulas to match aging trends observed in cell-level life test data. This follows 
common practice in the accelerated stress testing and life verification literature. 
Compared to physics models, these surrogate models are relatively easy to formu-
late, regress to aging data, and make predictions that include statistical confidence 
intervals.
As an example, a model for resistance growth may assume that resistance 
growth versus calendar time, t, and number of electrochemical-thermal-mechanical 
cycles, N, are additive:

The above semiempirical life model may be further generalized: 
Let y(t,N) be a measured performance metric (e.g., R or q), described 
as a function of multiple degradation states, xi, (e.g., y = f(x1,x2,x3…)). 
Table 4.4 lists suggested equations for tracking degradation state vari-
ables, xi. 
Examples of diffusion, kinetic, and mixed diffusion-kinetic processes include 
SEI film formation, film formation on metal oxides, and electrolyte reduction/oxi-
dation. Examples of break-in processes include release of reserve Li into the system 
that was initially unavailable, reordering of disordered lattice during initial cycles, 
or microcracking of particles opening up new electrochemical active surface area.

4.2  Modeling  
107
Examples of cyclic fade include side reactions driven by electrochemical cycling 
such as Li plating or stress and fracture driven by intercalation- and thermal-in-
duced strains. Regarding intercalation-induced stress/strain and fracture, voltage-
limited cycles that decline in intensity as the battery degrades may exhibit nearly 
linear fade behavior, p~0. Cycles with constant coulombic (Ah) throughput may 
exhibit mild accelerating trend, p~1, as remaining electrode sites are stressed at 
progressively higher levels to maintain the same cycle. Cycles with constant energy 
throughput (Wh) may exhibit even faster accelerating trends, p>1.
The model, once regressed to cell-life test data, may be extrapolated versus 
time, t, and cycles, N, to some EOL condition. Examples of regression to data are 
given in Section 7.7. But briefly, the model regression steps are:
1.	 Hypothesize degradation mechanisms. Create a trial function combining 
trajectory equations from Table 4.4, y = f(x1,x2…),  to describe perform-
ance fade for hypothesized fade mechanis.
2.	 Local model regression. Separately regress model y(t,N) to each aging 
test condition to find degradation rates, ki. (Orders zi and pi may either 
be regressed or fixed at constant values that best represent mechanism 
hypotheses).
3.	 Rate model regression. Plot rates, ki, versus duty-cycle aging stressors 
such as temperature (T), SOC, DOD, and C-rate. Hypothesize rate equa-
tions that functionally describe fade rate versus stressors (e.g., k = kref x f 
(T,SOC,DOD,C-rate,…)).  A suggested set of rate model equations is given 
in Table 4.5. Regress rate model coefficients. Polynomials or lookup tables 
may be used.
4.	 Global model regression. Substitute rate equations into performance fade 
model to create a model with functional dependence on duty-cycle, y(t,N; 
Figure 4.14  Fade trajectories produced by the equations in Table 4.4.

T,SOC,DOD,C-rate,…). Repeat regression of model parameters to best 
represent global (entire) dataset.
5.	 Assess statistical validity of model. Iterate on mechanism hypotheses and 
trial functions. Compare regression statistics (e.g., mean-square error, R2, 
adjusted R2) across trial models, select the most statistically relevant model.
4.3  Testing 
For the cell designer, objectives of aging/life tests are to identify main failure modes. 
Knowledge of failure modes is fed back into the design process so that they may 
be reduced through design improvements. For the system designer, an important 
objective of aging tests is to measure performance fade rates to inform a lifetime 
predictive model. The life model then guides proper sizing of system BOL excess 
energy and power. Life-model uncertainty must be accommodated by oversizing 
energy and power, which introduces extra cost. Clearly a goal in life modeling is to 
minimize uncertainty in lifetime predictability.
As discussed previously, cell performance degrades due to 
••
Calendar age, t, spent at a given temperature and SOC;
••
Number of (dis)charge cycles, N, together with the rate, temperature, and 
SOC window of the cycles;
••
Coupled calendar and cyclic aging mechanisms, introducing path depen-
dency of the aging process.

4.3  Testing  
109
To aid discussion of life testing of Li-ion batteries, Table 4.6 provides a summary of 
dominant aging mechanisms and typical dependence on operating condition.
The life test and verification process involves multiple steps:
1.	 Quantify expected duty cycle and environment. Collect statistics from 
field, or use system models (Chapters 2 and 3) to simulate behavior of a 
cell within the energy storage system. Statistically categorize scenarios to 
identify reference worst-case duty cycles for use in aging tests (e.g., 95th 
percentile (dis)charge power profile, temperature, and pressure). 
2.	 Define EOL condition. Using data from the cell supplier or rules of thumb 
(e.g., EOL at 20% to 30% fade), roughly size battery. Determine level of 
capacity and/or resistance fade that represents EOL. Note that EOL may 
be under some specific operating condition (e.g., pulse power requirement 
at cold temperature and low SOC).
3.	 Design of experiments. Create matrix of aging test (dis)charge power pro-
files, temperatures, pressures to be tested.
4.	 Design RPTs. RPTs provide repeatable benchmark measurements of resis-
tance and capacity throughout life. RPTs are typically conducted monthly 
under moderately accelerated aging conditions or weekly under highly ac-
celerated aging conditions.
5.	 Conduct aging experiments. Run aging test campaign for several months 
to years, depending upon life predictive confidence level needed to field 
design.
6.	 Conduct diagnostic experiments. Noninvasive experiments such as elec-
trochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) may be conducted periodically 
as part of RPTs. Invasive experiments may  be conducted at the end of the 
aging experiments (e.g., cell teardown and construction of half cells using 
extracted electrode samples to separately measure remaining performance 
of individual electrodes).

7.	 Fit life models to data. Regress semiempirical models or physics-based life 
models to resistance growth and capacity fade measured during the aging 
experiments.
8.	 Refine system design and control strategies. Determine amount of excess 
power/energy at BOL needed to achieve desired life. Design thermal man-
agement system and determine temperature control set points. Set current 
and power limits versus SOC and T to avoid regions of operation that 
cause excessive damage.
4.3.1  Screening/Benchmarking Tests
Aging tests may be carried out in several rounds. Prior to designing a full set of ex-
periments, it is useful to run a small set of screening tests to identify dominant mech-
anisms to be excited and appropriate stress levels for the full aging test campaign. 
Benchmarking tests provide useful reference data for comparisons across tech-
nologies. The standard data helps to track technologies from different vendors, 
variations on manufacturing batches, and design heritage. Suggested screening/
benchmark tests are given in Table 4.7.
When designing a new cell chemistry, geometry, or package, it is always less 
expensive to perform aging studies on small-scale samples, where possible. For 
example, new electrochemical material couples are commonly tested in mAh-size 
coin cell formats. But full validation of lifetime for a large cell or system design is 
difficult to scale from small-scale results, particularly for mechanisms coupled to 
thermomechanicalelectrical effects. Physics-based models offer potential to provide 
a route to scale-up small cell aging test results to large cell virtual designs. 
4.3.2  Design of Experiments
Design of experiments—an entire discipline in its own right—deals with setting up 
a test matrix of what levels and combinations of stress factors to explore the deg-
radation space. Objectives are to maximize statistical significance and minimize the 
number of experiments needed to map the degradation space. 
Experiments should outline a set of stress factors that are orthogonal; that 
is, are uncorrelated and efficiently contrast one another. This minimizes duplicate 
data collected by tests run at different aging conditions. For example, SOC and

4.3  Testing  
111
open-circuit voltage are highly correlated variables. Only one of these two should 
be chosen as a stress factor.
The degradation rate versus stress factor multidimensional space is often too 
expensive to explore with a full factorial tests (i.e., an experimental design that 
varies on one stress factor at a time). Techniques to map the space with partial 
factorial experiments include Fisher, Box, and Taguchi methods.
They should be selected based on expected accelerating factors influencing deg-
radation rate. Application duty-cycle scenarios should be statistically analyzed to 
identify statistical levels of stressors (e.g., 95th percentile T, C-rate, OCV or SOC, 
DOD). For calendar fade, time-average and maximum values of T and SOC (or 
OCV) are significant stressors. For power applications, or when thermal behavior 
is a concern, root mean square (RMS) current is an important metric to match. 
For cycle-life limitations, DOD plays a significant role, with acceleration at low 
temperatures attributable to brittle material properties and at high temperatures 
attributable to binder and separator creep. Average C-rate and pulse time of (dis)
charge (or square root of pulse time) are also important metric that describe sever-
ity of concentration gradients. Rather than time-averaging statistics to represent 
a duty cycle, it may be preferable to analyze duty cycles by breaking them down 
into microcycles, for example, by taking moving averages of C-rate, or using the 
so-called rainflow algorithm from the mechanical fatigue literature. Together with 
C-rate, other cyclic stress factors can be binned and plotted. An example histogram 
of C-rate, temperature, and SOC versus pulse time as shown in Figure 4.15.
Calendar and cyclic degradation are highly correlated stress factors, not or-
thogonal to one another. For life extrapolation, calendar degradation should be 
separated from cycling degradation to the maximum extent possible. It is therefore 
useful to include cycles-per-day, N/t, as a factor in the test matrix. One extreme of 
the test matrix may be run at 100% duty cycle; that is, with little or no rest between 
each charge/discharge cycle. Other portions of the test matrix should include cy-
cling experiments run with at a partial duty cycle, where rest is included in between 
each cycle where cycles-per-day, N/t, approaches a rate closer to what is expected in 
the application. Table 4.8 shows an example life test matrix. Due to manufacturing 
variation, replicates should be included at several test conditions so that the experi-
ments also quantify cell-to-cell aging process variation. 
4.3.3  RPTs
 RPTs serve to benchmark performance changes throughout lifetime. They are typi-
cally conducted monthly; however, it is desirable to conduct RPTs more frequently in 
situations where fade rates are highly accelerated, such as at high temperature/high 
SOC/high C-rate/high DOD cycling. RPTs most commonly consist of low rate (≤1C) 
capacity measurements and HPPC tests to map resistance versus SOC. In order to 
decouple the effect of resistance growth from the loss in measured capacity, it is use-
ful to add a constant voltage hold at not just the end of the charge, but at the end of 
the discharge as well. Alternately, the capacity at a constant current can be measured 
at a very low C-rate (C/20 to C/50); these measurements are also useful for observing 
changes in the open circuit potential with aging. Often for a test matrix such as that 
shown in Table 4.8, RPT tests will be run at a common temperature, in the range of 
23°C to 30°C, to facilitate comparison of aging results across conditions.

112 
�������������
Battery Life 
Ideally, the RPTs influence the degradation rate of the given aging condition as 
little as possible. For this reason, a partial HPPC test might be run using only pulses 
at a few SOCs rather than the full HPPC. Instead of running the RPT at a common 
reference temperature, RPTs may be run at the aging-test temperature to eliminate 
the influence of changing temperature. EIS is a minimally invasive technique and 
is thus well suited for RPT testing. Medium- to high-frequency sweeps (>0.01 Hz) 
are relatively quick to run and provide useful information on interfacial processes 
impacting fast transient power capability. It takes more time to obtain information 
on transport-limiting processes that govern available energy. 
4.3.4  Other Diagnostic Tests
In addition to EIS, other minimally invasive tests include:
••
Electrochemical dilatometry measurement of cell package strain during cy-
cling. Large strains may be correlated with phase changes (possibly with 
poor reversibility), plastic, or viscoelastic deformation of electrodes and sep-
arator and gas generation.
••
Entropic measurements may similarly indicate phase changes.
••
With Li loss, the electrochemical windows of the two electrodes will shift 
with respect to one another. This shift may be quantified by

•	 Plotting dQ/dV from each cycle and observing shifts in peaks that are a 
characteristic signature of electrode phase changes. Figure 4.16 provides 
an example.
•	 Using a single particle model that captures OCV behavior versus stoi-
chiometry of negative and positive electrodes, fitting beginning and end 
of discharge stoichiometries for both electrodes to low rate (dis)charge 
data.
•	 Implanting a reference electrode in a cell or in the vicinity of a cell inside 
a shared electrolyte bath such as in Figure 4.17.
Tearing the cell apart can provide further diagnoses of failure mechanisms, us-
ing microscopy, surface, or bulk measurement techniques to observe chemical and 
morphology changes. A good example of teardown and analysis is given by Can-
narella [24]. Half cells, symmetric cells, or three-electrode cells may be constructed 
from samples punched from extracted electrodes. Beware of deducing degradation 
rates from half-cell data where one electrode is the working electrode and the other 
is both reference and working electrode. Half cells using Li metal essentially have 
an infinite reservoir of Li. They can therefore operate for hundreds of cycles at low 
coulombic efficiency and still show reasonable performance despite their unstable 
rate of Li consumption (e.g., silicon).

condition, the first peak near 0.0 Ah corresponds to the deintercalated FeP electrode. As discharge 
proceeds from left to right, the remaining peaks correlate with phase changes in the graphite elec-
trode. The distance between each of these peaks stays constant, indicating graphite active material 
loss is negligible. Rather, the peaks shift to the left, indicating cycleable Li is being lost from the sys-
tem with consequence that the graphite electrochemical window shifts to progressively lower SOCs 
as the cell ages, limiting capacity. (Reproduced with permission from the Electrochemical Society

Battery Safety
Safety, in the context of Li-ion batteries, has received a lot of attention over the 
decades, and more so as the size of batteries used in the different target applications 
has drastically increased. One of the key technological barriers in scaling up the size 
of batteries, together with uniformity and catering to newer use patterns, is the safe 
handling of the battery. The amount of energy stored in a vehicle battery pack is 
over three orders of magnitude in comparison with that in a laptop battery module. 
In turn, the requirement to manage such high energy content in a confined space 
under a wide variety of operating conditions over 10 or more years of usage poses 
challenges very different from the handling of small modules or cells individually. 
This chapter elaborates on the chemical, electrochemical, and thermal events that 
result in safety issues often encountered with Li-ion batteries, the differences in 
the nature of problems inherent to large-format cells and modules utilizing a large 
number of cells, and test methods commonly used in the community to evaluate the 
safety of Li-ion batteries. In keeping with the format of this text, the first section 
discusses the background reactions, followed by a mathematical description of the 
different abuse events. An experimental section outlining the test methods followed 
by best practices in the industry towards addressing the aforementioned challenges 
conclude this chapter.
5.1  Safety Concerns in Li-Ion Batteries
As described in earlier chapters, a Li-ion cell is comprised of several components 
with inherently different material properties. For example, the cathode material 
has thermal properties akin to ceramics whereas the binder is made of polymers. 
The combination of the mechanical rigidity of the cathode particles across a wide 
range of temperatures and the flexibility of the binder material are crucial for ef-
ficient performance and packaging of the cell, but these factors in turn introduce 
constraints on the operating regime for the cell. In this example where the mechani-
cal properties change with temperature, the binder material becomes brittle at very 
low temperatures, resulting in dislodging of the cathode particles from the electrode 
during prolonged exposure to cold temperatures. Another example, is the different 
coefficients of thermal expansion for the current collectors (copper or aluminum 
foils) and the separator (typically, polyethylene, or polypropylene), resulting in un-
even stress buildup across the different layers of a wound cell. Consequently, the 

118 
��������������
Battery Safety
lower operating temperature of the cell should then be restricted to that tempera-
ture above which the wear introduced to the components is acceptable. Storing or 
operating the cell below a certain temperature often results in performance issues 
and at the extreme limits, the failure of one or more components triggers a series of 
events that dissipate a large amount of the energy stored in the cells in an uncontrol-
lable fashion. Similar constraints exist on the electrochemical, chemical, thermal, 
and mechanical stability of the different constituents of the cell. The issue of battery 
safety is further complicated by the change in these constraints with the size and 
age of the cells, not to mention the assembly of modules and packs with a multitude 
of cells—each with a different set of initial parameters and aging pattern. Factors 
compromising safety of large-format Li-ion cells can be classified into categories 
detailed in the following sections.
5.1.1  Electrical Failure
Several of the commonly used battery materials have a tight tolerance on the volt-
age they can be safely exposed to before undesired changes to the chemical structure 
are realized. For example, the vast majority of the cathode materials and solvents 
used in the electrolytes that are described in Chapter 2 disintegrate when exposed to 
voltages higher than 4.5V, releasing large amounts of heat, together with molecular 
oxygen—often resulting in venting of the cell casing together with copious amounts 
of smoke and/or fire. Usually, the electrical circuitry around the cell is designed to 
prevent supply of energy to the cell after a set voltage limit is triggered, resulting 
in prevention of unintentional overcharge; however, an occasional failure of the 
protective electronics is often attributed to this failure mode. Another commonly 
encountered electrical failure is the short-circuit of the cell(s) or occasionally the 
battery pack. These events are attributed to improper shielding, poor choice of volt-
age isolation, or failure to properly ground the battery pack. Such electrical failure 
modes are often combated using a sleuth of redundant circuitry in place—on some 
occasions in excess of three layers. Conventional battery packs rely on the presence 
of a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) device or a current interrupt device 
(CID) to combat short circuits. However, in large battery packs, localized failure 
introduces additional challenges due to propagation of the heat generated from iso-
lated cell failure. Insulation of the pack from the vehicle grounding, having separate 
control units for the pack from the modules and in some cases the individual cells, 
segregation of modules limited to a maximum voltage (typically 50V), and thermal 
insulation of the different modules within a battery pack are often developed as part 
of the design strategy.
5.1.2  Thermal Failure
Excessive temperature leads to evaporation of the organic solvents in the electro-
lyte, in turn causing swelling of the pouch material in which the cells are encapsu-
lated. If the cell is exposed to temperatures higher than 80°C, the thermal stability 
of the components begins to deteriorate, resulting in other reactions. The solid/
electrolyte interface (see Chapter 4) disintegrates at 85°C to 105°C: the electrolyte 
is no longer protected from the excessive reduction potential at the anode/electro-
lyte interface and forms highly resistive layers that block the pores of the anode. 

5.1  Safety Concerns in Li-Ion Batteries 
119
These extra resistive layers only result in further increase in the cell temperature. 
At 128°C, the polymer constituents of the separator begin to melt and lose their 
physical integrity—the pores across which the electrolyte carries the ions between 
the two electrodes begin to collapse and the cell resistance increases further due to 
limited ion transport between the two electrodes. In turn, when the polymers in 
the separator reach their melting points, there is no effective mechanical separation 
between the two electrodes, resulting in an electrical short circuit. Subsequent rise 
in cell temperature triggers thermal decomposition of the electrolyte and in turn the 
components of the electrodes themselves. These reactions are very rapid and drive 
one another in a vicious cycle, resulting in vast amounts of energies (of the order 
of several hundred kilojoules per Ah of the cell capacity) commonly referred to as 
thermal runaway reactions once the cell reaches the point of no return. Whereas 
lower capacity cells (e.g., 18650s) have traditionally employed safety measures such 
as shutdown separators to delay or prevent thermal runaway, localized failure in 
large-format cells often results in inadequate response times for such mechanisms 
to engage in a protective action. Large-format cell manufacturers are increasingly 
relying on single-cell controllers in order to enable quicker isolation of faulty cells. 
However, as mentioned before, due to the concentration of large amounts of energy 
in constrained volumes, safety in large battery packs remains a challenge best over-
come by preventive measures such as a strong casing or heat-absorbent packaging 
material.
5.1.3  Electrochemical Failure
A combination of extreme voltages and temperature often hampers the electro-
chemical stability of the battery materials. The disintegration of the cathode mate-
rial during the thermal runaway reactions is mainly attributed to the inability of the 
transition metal oxide lattice to effectively bond the oxygen atoms at very low lith-
ium concentrations. As a result, when the cell is overcharged, oxygen is dislodged 
from this material, which then falls apart quickly like a deck of cards and releases 
a large amount of heat at very short periods of time. In order to combat the issue 
of overcharge, large-format battery packs used in different applications today limit 
the operating window to about 65% of the available energy. Operation at the safe 
window provides better abuse tolerance should the lithium concentrations drop at 
select spots within the large battery pack. Another major limitation of Li-ion batter-
ies is the inability to operate safely at low temperatures: the transport properties of 
the cell components at temperatures below –10°C are typically two or more orders 
of magnitude slower than those at 25°C.  As a result, high rate discharge or a quick 
charge on a battery stored at cold temperatures for prolonged periods of time result 
in the cell releasing the energy as waste heat. 
Another problem that stems from the high resistance at lower temperatures 
is the shift in the local electrode potentials; as described in Chapter 4, the anode 
voltage is lowered farther during charge if the cell resistance is higher. Around 0V, 
the lithium content of the anode is stable in its metallic form. Thus, at low tem-
peratures, the anode tends to plate lithium in the form of dendrites owing to the 
high resistance. This effect is more pronounced at higher rates of charge (since the 
anode potential drops faster). Lithium plating is thus a serious safety concern that 
can result in puncturing of the separator and a short circuit across the electrodes. 

120 
��������������
Battery Safety
The fully charged cells are particularly vulnerable to the plating problem owing to 
a combination of a local potential favorable for plating and the availability of large 
amounts of lithium at the anode toward the end of charge. At the design phase, 
a slightly larger form factor is introduced for the anode in order to accommodate 
any excess lithium without plating. However, in large-format cells, a second failure 
mechanism that can contribute to plating is the uneven distribution and growth of 
local resistances within the cell— often caused by defective material selection or 
design flaws—which results in some parts of the cell being overcharged while oth-
ers are being underutilized. A third possibility is the wide spread in the internal re-
sistance and/or cell capacity of multiple cells used to build a large battery pack. To 
mitigate such failure, a conservative operating window (both for temperature and 
voltage) is specified for Li-ion cells. The C-rates at which the cells can be operated 
at low temperatures is also restricted. Makers of large-format cells often require 
much tighter tolerances on uniformity of the cell components and the distribution 
in the initial cell properties among the different batches compared to the cells used 
in consumer electronics and single-cell applications. Emphasis on abuse-tolerant 
chemistries, including cathode compositions stable across wider voltage windows 
and electrolyte additives to mitigate overcharge or flammability has in particu-
lar been the focus of developmental efforts in battery research and development 
(R&D) since the advent of large-format cell applications.
5.1.4  Mechanical Failure
Mechanical failure in large-format Li-ion cells includes rupture of the current col-
lector owing to excessive tension as the electrodes expand and contract repeatedly 
during cycling, the peeling of electrode active material from the current collector 
often due to poor choice of slurry composition during the coating of active mate-
rial on to the current collectors, binder failure at extreme temperatures leading to 
dislodging of particles from the electrode leading to electrical short circuit, me-
chanical compliance of the separator material including a mismatch between the 
elastic properties in the transverse and the winding directions, large pore sizes and/
or lower tortuosity resulting in higher probability for short circuits, swelling or 
shrinkage of the polymer at extreme temperatures, and mechanical defects that 
appear on the electrodes during the slitting or calendaring operations (e.g., edge 
effects on coatings, sharp burrs on current collectors). Many of the design factors 
used in small-format cells do not readily translate to the large cells. For example, 
the length of the electrode increases several folds in large-format cells, and the in-
ner winds of prismatic cells often encounter mechanical stresses far higher than 
the ultimate stress of the current collectors, resulting in splitting of the electrode. 
Such issues are overcome in advanced cell designs by introducing multiple jelly rolls 
within the same cell container or by employing the stacked cell design.
5.1.5  Chemical Failure
Generation of hydrofluoric acid from the decomposition of the fluoride-based elec-
trolyte interacting with moisture content that originates from contamination leads 
to corrosion of the cell casing and the cell components. This issue is heightened in 
large-format cells due to nonuniformity in the sealing/welding strength across the 

5.2  Modeling Insights on Li-Ion Battery Safety 
121
larger dimensions of the container, the availability of excess electrolyte to combat 
dry-up of the cell within the cell can, as well as the generation of larger volumes of 
gaseous side products in the large-format cell designs, resulting in higher pressure 
threshold for the failure of the cell container.
5.2  Modeling Insights on Li-Ion Battery Safety
Utilizing the mathematical framework provided in earlier chapters of this book, we 
now discuss some case studies to shed light on aspects of battery safety pertaining 
to large-format cells, which will help the reader appreciate the nuances in cell and 
battery design across different applications. The heat generated from abuse reac-
tions that are electrochemical in nature is computed using (3.3) with particular 
attention devoted to the change in kinetic and transport properties with tempera-
ture. Individual material balance for each chemical species is introduced to capture 
chemical reaction rates. Heats of reaction for the different chemical reactions can 
be measured as described in the next section of this chapter.
5.2.1  Challenges with Localized Failure
Conventional cell design utilizes the closing of the pores (~200 nm in size) in the 
separator due to melting of the polymer material during a thermal event to prevent 
ions from being rapidly transferred from one electrode to the other during a short 
circuit. This protective feature, often referred to as the shutdown separator, depends 
on uniform melting of the separator across the cross section of the cell to prevent 
the short-circuit flux from further heating up the cell.
However, as shown in Figure 5.1, the heat generation pattern during a short 
circuit is very different for a large-format cell from that in a conventional cell. 
The heat generation is localized (i.e., the region where the short circuit happens 
can be far away from the other parts of the cell). As a result, even though larger-
current densities resulting in higher local temperatures flow across the short circuit, 
there are parts of the cell sufficiently distant from the short where the temperature 
does not reach the melting point of the separator material, effectively rendering the 
shutdown mechanism ineffective. In addition, a secondary heating pattern emerges 
close to the positive and negative terminals as the result of a lower-resistance path-
way near the tabs for the charges to cross the voltage barrier. An alternate design 
toward improving safety should consider better heat distribution within large cells 
and additional protection features—for example, a mechanism to isolate the cell 
based on its voltage.
5.2.2  Effectiveness of Protective Devices in Multicell Packs
The next example considers the effectiveness of the PTC devices used in 18650 cells 
when the cells are connected together to form a high-capacity battery module. The 
electrical resistance of the PTC device increases as a function of its temperature. 
When a cell heats up due to a safety issue, the PTC prevents any current from the 
adjacent cells connected in parallel contributing to the heat generation across the 
short circuit. Figure 5.2 shows the distribution in maximum temperature across the 

122 
��������������
Battery Safety
different cells in a module. The module is comprised of 80 cylindrical cells of the 
18650 type, each of 2.2-Ah capacity connected in the 16P-5S configuration. As seen 
in Figure 5.2(a), the temperature difference between the cells adjacent to the faulty 
cell and the cells at the periphery of the module reaches as high as 100°C. The dif-
ference in the individual cell temperatures is indicative of the lag in propagation of 
the heat generated from one cell to the others. Depending on the spacing between 
the cells, the heat generated due to thermal runaway in one cell may propagate 
within seconds to adjacent cells or can be arrested to within a few millimeters near 
the cell.
Figure 5.2(b) shows the current across the PTC device within each cell as a 
function of time for an intracell distance of 100 µm and an assumed short-circuit 
resistance of 20 mΩ. As observed, the currents across the PTC devices of some cells 
within the modules do not drop even after several minutes, indicating an inherent 
limitation in the safety feature of the battery module. In such cases, the nonuniform 
heating across the module limits the functionality of the PTC device, and the design 
of a safe cell does not translate into a safe battery pack. Additional monitoring of 
bank voltages or cell temperatures is necessary to isolate the faulty cell/module in 
such instances.
5.2.3  Mechanical Considerations
The third example deals with scaling up an existing design in order to build larger 
wound format cells. Current distribution across the bigger jelly roll is often an is-
sue and is quite commonly identified by cell manufacturers who in turn provide for 
additional tabs across the length of the electrode to provide a balanced utilization 
of the electrode material. As a result, an 18650-type cell with 2.4 Ah or less capac-
ity usually has one tab for each electrode across which the current to (or from) the 
entire electrode (which is ~ 70 cm long) flows. When the cell capacity is increased 
Figure 5.1  Comparison of temperature evolution 8 seconds after short circuit in a 20-Ah cell (a) 
versus a 400-MAh cell (b). Both cells are of identical chemistry and design; however, even though 
it results in a higher maximum temperature at the location of the short, the short-circuit current for 
large-format cells does not trigger surface temperatures to rise sufficiently faster as to enable detec-
tion of the problem and safeguard the cell against propagation. For the smaller cell, the maximum 
temperature is far below that of the larger cell; however, the average cell temperature exceeds the 
melting point of the separator, thus providing the shutdown functionality.

5.2  Modeling Insights on Li-Ion Battery Safety 
123
to greater than 2.6 Ah, a second tab is introduced. Larger-format cells have multiple 
tabs, and some cylindrical cells designed for automotive applications have a con-
tinuous tab that is crimped after the jelly roll is made to be attached to the bus bars. 
However, the often overlooked factor that heavily influences the yield as well as the 
life of the cells is the mechanical stress the increased number of winds introduces 
to the jelly roll.
As shown in Figure 5.3, the temperature rise within the cylindrical cells can 
rise by as much as 50°C for 3C operating currents, and if the cooling mechanism in

tablished safety mechanisms, high-capacity battery packs trigger failure modes not encountered in 
conventional modules.

Battery Safety
place is not uniform, the mechanical stresses that develop within the cells will differ 
widely—often resulting in rupture of the current collectors.
5.2.4  Pressure Buildup
One of the most frequently debated queries in the industry is about the amount of 
pressure the packaging should be able to withstand before the cell vents in the event 
of a thermal runaway. Whereas the heat generation mechanisms and the tempera-
ture evolution across the different stages of failure are relatively well characterized, 
little information is available on the amount of pressure the cell generates and how 
Figure 5.3  Stress buildup in a module comprised of cylindrical cells due to uneven distribution of 
cell temperature within the module. The cooling plate is located at the bottom of the module in this 
example, and the heat transfer from the cells located in the interior of the module to the ambient is 
not adequate, which translates to poor mechanical behavior of the components within the jelly roll. 
The manufacturing process should take into account such disparities when determining the winding 
tension for the jelly roll.

5.2  Modeling Insights on Li-Ion Battery Safety

to develop a rational approach toward designing a safety vent to contain the fail-
ure within a battery pack. Figure 5.4 shows the calculated values of pressure per 
unit value of cell thickness for a 24-Ah cell with a given set of parameters for the 
chemistry and the thermal runaway reaction kinetics. Whereas the actual numbers 
for the different chemistries and reactions vary with the design and manufacturer, 
the trends are worth investigating: the chemical reactions resulting in gaseous spe-
cies are the least contributing factors for the generation of pressure within the cell. 
These reactions are triggered earlier on in the runaway process, but the volume of 
gaseous species generated is not sufficient to trigger venting of the pouch. The elas-
ticity of the pouch material in turn keeps the pressure generation due to mechani-
cal deformation under check—until the cell temperature reaches sufficiently high 
values to cause evaporation of the volatile components. At this point, the pressure 
within the cell rises abruptly and crosses the yield strength of the seal, resulting in 
a vent. Such a systematic analysis serves as a means to determine the moduli of the 
pouch material and the temperature range across which the material is expected to 
retain its elasticity.
The determination of weld strengths in metallic cans as well as the seals in 
pouch material is often determined arbitrarily by the cell manufacturer based on 
prior experience with 18650 or prismatic cells <1 Ah. However, as mentioned ear-
lier, the ratio of active to passive components in large-format cells is significant-
ly higher than that for the traditional single-cell applications. For example, the 
amount of electrolyte used in the 24-Ah pouch cell is about 10 times that used in a 
2.6-Ah 18650 type cell, and the volume of the larger-format cell does not scale lin-
early with the electrolyte content to accommodate for pressure buildup. Adopting a 
Figure 5.4  Different factors contribute to the buildup of pressure within the cell when a thermal 
runaway reaction happens: volatile components in the electrolyte undergo a phase change, several 
chemical reactions generate gaseous products, and the container undergoes mechanical deforma-
tion to accommodate the rise in pressure. The choice of pouch material and the determination of 
weld/seal strengths should account for these factors.

more systematic approach as outlined above will result in improving the uniformity 
in abuse response of the cells.
5.2.5  Designing Protective Circuitry to Combat Short Circuit
Short circuit of cells in a battery pack is a major concern among the different safety 
issues commonly encountered in the field. The short circuit may result from an 
external trigger (example.g., a flood leading to electrical contact across the leads 
of the cells in a battery pack that has been mechanically compromised) or due to 
an internal defect that originates during the manufacturing process (e.g., due to the 
presence of some metallic impurity within the jelly roll). Regardless of the origin, a 
short circuit in a Li-ion cell leads to field incidents that range from failure of indi-
vidual cells or modules followed by a rapid heat up of parts of the pack to uncon-
trolled venting and smoke from the battery pack. However, the rate of incidence of 
such failure is so rare that a repeatable laboratory test to capture the response of the 
cell to a short circuit is difficult. The different test procedures under development 
to characterize short-circuit response of a cell are outlined in Section 5.3.3; but this 
example focuses on the electrical nature of the different types of short circuit that 
happen in a cell and its implication toward improving safety of the battery.
Basically, there are four components within a battery that can lead to an elec-
tronic short circuit: the cathode active material, the aluminum current collector 
on which it is coated, the anode active material (typically carbon), and the copper 
current collector on which it is coated. Any short-circuit results in components of 
the anode compartment (i.e., either carbon or the copper foil) coming into contact 
with the components of the cathode compartment (i.e., the cathode active material 
or the aluminum foil). Thus there are four permutations of short circuit that are 
theoretically possible within a cell:
Type I short, where the cathode and anode active materials come into direct 
contact;
Type II short, where the aluminum foil comes into contact with the carbon on 
the anode;
Type III short, where the copper foil comes into contact with the cathode active 
material;
Type IV short, where the copper and aluminum foils come into contact with 
each other.
The external short circuit would be classified as a type IV short since the cur-
rent collector tabs come into electrical contact with each other for this case. All 
these types of short circuits can possibly originate internal to the cell. However, 
given the cell construction for most of the existing cell designs, the type II short 
is least likely, merely based on the area of each component that has a reasonable 
probability of coming into contact with the other. For a given cell design and con-
tact area during a short circuit, when the heat generation rates are simulated for 
each type of short circuit, type II shorts accumulate the maximum amount of heat 
due to the right range of resistances across the short-circuit pathway. A type IV 
short is very conductive since the contact is between two metallic foils; as a result 

5.2  Modeling Insights on Li-Ion Battery Safety 
127
of the low resistances, the heat generation for this type of short circuit is lower, 
whereas a short involving the cathode active material is so resistive that the cur-
rents passing across the type I and type III shorts are lower compared to the others, 
and as a result, the heat generation rate for these scenarios are usually the lowest. 
The temperature evolution during the different types of short circuits in a 400 
MAh cell is shown in Figure 5.5. There are several implications to improve bat-
tery safety: first, these results do not directly translate to large-format cells, which 
are designed either with several-fold increments in energy that eventually the cells 
will enter into thermal runaway. However, the response time and the thermal load 
that the cooling system should be able to accommodate can be computed using the 
methods outlined in Chapter 3 for different cell sizes and form factors. Second, the 
design of high-power cells intuitively considers lower impedances for the cathode. 
Whereas it is not surprising that low impedance cathodes result in lower amounts 
of heat generation, there is a trade-off between the amount of heat generated dur-
ing normal operation and the potential for generating excessive heat owing to good 
conductivities during a short-circuit. Cell manufactures should then consider de-
signing the cathode slurry with minimum values for electronic conductivity that 
will meet the performance requirements. The last and most significant implication 
is around the design of safety features that will protect the cell in the event of 
a short circuit. There are several possible solutions: for instance, since the short 
circuit between the current collectors is deemed safe for the cells discussed in the 
example, it may be reasonable to provide an extra winding of the copper current 
collector on the outside of the jelly roll so that any unintentional short circuit dur-
ing a mechanical crush will result in a type III or IV short rather than a type I short,

or a thermally activated fuse can be incorporated as part of the cell design to ensure 
contact between the desired layers of the jelly roll, thus minimizing the damage 
external to the cell.
5.3  Evaluating Battery Safety
Evaluation of Li-ion batteries for safety is a highly contested area in the industry. 
Despite attempts by several committees, the experimental procedures for abuse test-
ing of batteries vary considerably among the different sections of the industry. This 
section elaborates on the tools and practices commonly used by the battery com-
munity in this context. The subsequent sections address progress towards building 
a consistent set of test procedures.
The test procedures related to the component level are mainly developed and 
advocated by the cell manufacturers. It is in the interest of the pack designer to un-
derstand the material level limitations in order to be able to distinguish issues that 
can be addressed at the pack-design phase versus those that need to be addressed 
at the cell level. As elucidated in the previous section, the safety of individual cells 
does not automatically translate to the safety of the battery pack built using those 
cells. However, as discussed in the examples in Section 5.2, each part of the cell 
plays a crucial role individually and in conjunction with the other components of 
the cell. Understanding safety at the component level is inevitable in building a safe 
battery pack. Determination of properties that determine safety at the component 
level is largely carried out for the active ingredients using an accelerated rate calo-
rimeter that provides information on how fast the abuse reactions take places and 
the associated heats of reaction. The passive components such as the separator film 
are evaluated for mechanical and thermal stability.
5.3.1  Measurement of Reaction Heats: Accelerating Rate Calorimeters
The accelerating rate calorimeter (ARC) or adiabatic calorimeter was devised by 
Dow Chemical Company in the 1970s and was patented in 1984. It is a great tool 
for evaluating exothermic chemical reactions. The instrument was developed to 
understand the thermal hazards associated with reactive chemicals, including per-
oxides, explosives, batteries, and other reactive materials. A general schematic of an 
accelerating rate calorimeter is shown in Figure 5.6. The basic instrument involves 
a sample holder, typically referred to as a bomb, which is placed inside a reaction 
chamber. The sample holder and the reaction chamber are kept at the same temper-
ature through the control and use of heaters. The heaters ensure that an adiabatic 
condition exists and there is no heat transfer between the sample holder and the 
cell. The sample holder is typically made from a high-strength material such as tita-
nium or Hastelloy® so as to withstand the pressure buildup during an exothermic 
reaction. The amount of reactive material placed in the sample holder is dependent 
on the size of the holder and the expected exothermic reaction.
Once a sample material is placed in the holder, the container is sealed in the 
reaction chamber and the instrument goes through a heat/wait/seek cycle, as shown 
in Figure 5.7. Initially, the sample and chamber are heated to a user selectable 

5.3  Evaluating Battery Safety 
129
temperature. The temperature is then held for a set amount of time (wait) in order 
to detect (seek) an exothermic reaction. If no reaction is detected, then the propor-
tional-integral-derivative (PID) heater controllers will increment the temperature of 
both the chamber and sample holder. The heat/wait/seek process will be repeated 
until an exothermic reaction is sensed. Once an exothermic reaction occurs, the

Battery Safety
temperature of the reaction chamber will be controlled to the temperature of the 
sample holder; the rise in temperature at times may exceed several 100°C/min. If 
an adiabatic condition is maintained during the chemical reaction, then the system 
provides an accurate measurement of the heat data along with the onset tempera-
ture, the maximum heating rate, and the enthalpy of reaction. Typically, tests will 
be performed over several days so as to ensure that the onset temperature is accu-
rately characterized, and the temperature is incremented only a fraction of a degree 
between heat/wait/seek periods.
Limitations associated with ARCs. It should be noted that no accelerating rate 
calorimeter is truly adiabatic—heat will be lost from the sample to its holder. A phi 
factor, the ratio of the thermal mass of the sample and holder to the thermal mass 
of the sample alone, is used to correct the calorimetric result for this heat loss. An-
other limitation associated with this type of calorimeter is that the sample holder 
typically only has a single highly accurate resistive temperature detector (RTD), 
thermistor, or thermocouple placed on its exterior. It is assumed that this single 
temperature sensor on the sample holder represents the temperature of the entire 
sample vessel. Essentially, the assumption is that the sample and its container have 
an infinite thermal conductivity or no mass—an obviously inaccurate assumption. 
Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to accurately match the temperature between 
the reaction chamber and the sample holder during the exothermic reaction be-
cause some reactions occur too quickly.
5.3.1.1  ARCs and Testing Batteries. 
ARCs are used to assess the thermal stability of electrolytes, cathodes, anodes, 
and cells. It is well known that the cathode material has the strongest influence on 
a cell’s thermal stability. Table 5.1 shows the properties for some of the commer-
cially available cathodes on the market today. LiCoO2 cells are the most common 
chemistry used in consumer electronics due to the high energy density of the cell.

However, these cells are thermally unstable due to the breakdown of the cathode 
and its subsequent evolution of oxygen at higher temperatures [2]. Figure 5.8 shows 
the thermal response from ARC experiments on several different cathode materi-
als incorporated into 18650 cells. The LiCoO2 1.2 Ah cell has the lowest onset 
temperature and also the highest heating rate. In contrast, the LiFePO4 cell has the 
highest onset temperature and the lowest heating rate—the LiFePO4 cathode does 
not evolve oxygen during its decomposition and thus its relatively benign thermal 
response as compared to LiCoO2 during this calorimetric experiment.
ACRs can also be used to assess the thermal response of the component mate-
rials within a battery. Figure 5.9 shows the thermal response of the individual cell 
components within a cell. The experiment was performed by removing the battery 
component materials from a fully charged NMC cell. The component materials 
were resealed into a 18650 container with additional electrolyte. As can be seen 
from the figure, each cell component has different onset temperatures as well as 
maximum heating rates. When these components are combined into the full cell, 
the thermal runaway onset temperature is approximately 220°C, which is different 
from the individual components within the cell. The difference is primarily due to 
the interactions of the components incorporated into the cell as well as the compo-
nent differences in specific heat.
Adiabatic calorimeters are very useful tools when addressing the safety aspects 
of cell design. They can be used to assess how:
••
An electrolyte additive affects  the flammability temperature of an electrolyte;
••
An artificial SEI layer affects the evolution of oxygen during cathode decom-
position at higher temperatures;
••
The individual battery components affect the safety of the battery system.
In the end, the ARC is a vital tool for assessing the abuse tolerance of all a batteries 
components and features.
5.3.2  Thermomechanical Characterization of Passive Components
The safety of a Li-ion cell depends equally on the response of the passive compo-
nents as much as it does on the ingredients that react during an abuse scenario. The

mechanical characterization of the passive components such as the separator, pouch 
material, and current collectors is even more important in the context of large-
format cells than it has traditionally been in the battery manufacturing process.
Testing of the thermal-mechanical properties of the cell components is carried 
out using a tensile-strength tester using standard American Society for Testing and 
Materials (ASTM) methods.1 A standard vice to hold the sample of prespecified di-
mensions is subjected to tensile stresses as a function of temperature. Detailed test 
procedure for mechanical characterization of polymer films used in Li-ion batter-
ies is described in other standard references on Li-ion batteries [4]. This section is 
included here only to highlight the differences in test methodology for large-format 
cells. For instance, the width of a separator film in a jelly roll for an 18650-type 
cell typically exceeds that of the electrodes by 3% to 4% whereas such tight clear-
ance is not expected for a large-format cell for two reasons: the temperature dis-
tribution across the larger cell varies quite a bit for wound cells, and the tolerance 
of the jelly roll within the can is not nearly as close as that for the 18650 format. 
With the advent of continuous tabs that are crimped on either end of the jelly roll, 
the separator width is maintained just below the point where it does not interfere 
with the crimping of the tabs. Similarly for stacked format cells, the cell is more 
forgiving of the mechanical properties of the separator than it is of the shrinkage 
when the cell is exposed to high temperatures. These factors allow for the design 
of separators with larger pores, for example, to allow for the higher power rating 
of the automotive cells.
Also with lower winding tensions, the mechanical strength along the thickness 
direction of the different layers is not as crucial as that for tightly wound low-ca-
pacity cells. The large-format pouch cells are encased in hard casing for single-cell 
applications; for the more widely targeted application within larger battery packs, 
the packaging of the battery pack implies that the design of the membranes should

D1204, Standard Test methods for Linear Dimensional Changes of Non-rigid Thermoplastic Sheeting or 
Film at Elevated Temperatures; and ASTM D882, Standard Test Method for Tensile Properties of Thin

focus on optimizing thermal properties and tolerance to a wider temperature win-
dow that the large-format cells are designed for use under, rather than the tradi-
tional emphasis on the mechanical strength. For example, the trends shown in Fig-
ure 5.10 indicate that films approach the yield strength at much lower strain values 
when the test is performed at lower temperatures. These results when considered 
on their own indicate the need for a stronger membrane. However, from Figure 5.4 
it is clear that mechanical deformation is not the limiting factor that triggers the 
violent response when a cell undergoes an abuse reaction. In this context, a lower 
resistance membrane will result in less heat generation as well as exhibit a lower 
propensity for plating of lithium at the lower temperature extremes for which the 
automotive batteries are designed, and thus has a better chance of averting a cata-
strophic response from the cell.
5.3.3  Cell-Level Testing
Laboratory testing of the abuse response of Li-ion cells comprises of subjecting the 
cell to extremes of temperature and mechanical stress together with electrical short 
circuits. The metric used for evaluating the cells varies significantly based on the 
cell design, target application, and the end-user requirements. This section outlines 
some of the standard test practices and highlights the differences between testing of 
small cells typically used in consumer electronics applications versus larger-format 
cells used in larger-capacity modules/packs. In each of the following tests, a pass/
fail designation is assigned based on prespecified criteria. Examples of standards 
governing the test-procedure are included in Table 5.2. However, this is an evolving 
discipline, and there are several participants actively shaping the discussion as the 
understanding on abuse testing of large-format lithium ion batteries matures.
5.3.3.1  Short-Circuit Tests
These tests involve subjecting the cells to an internal or external short circuit un-
der a known set of conditions (state of charge, heat transfer rate, and ambient

to portable Li-ion cells and batteries for use in portable electronics is carried out 
by connecting the terminals of the cell at 100% SOC across a resistor 80 ± 20 mΩ 
and monitoring the cell temperature for 24 hours or until it returns to the chamber 
temperature (set to 55°C), whereas Underwriters Laboratories (UL) specifies (UL-
2580, “Batteries for Use in Electric Vehicles”) the short-circuit resistance as 20 mΩ 
at 20°C.
5.3.3.2  RMS: Root mean square.
Intrusion of a foreign object resulting in short circuits is usually simulated in a nail 
penetration test is carried out by puncturing the cell using a nail or a blunt rod. The 
specifications vary with the objective of the test and the requirements of the end us-
ers. One common approach is to use a nail with a tip radius of 0.9 mm and tip angle 
of 45° at a constant press speed of 0.1 mm/s until the cell voltage drops by at least 
100 mV. However, as described in Section 5.2, the propagation of thermal events 
varies significantly among different cell designs. More recent test methods have 
recommended inducing a short circuit of definite resistance at a specific location. 
Test procedures such as those recommended by the Battery Association of Japan 
(JIS C8714) for consumer electronic cells involve placing a conductive particle be-
tween the layers of a jelly roll obtained after opening a cell at 100% SOC have been 
found unsuitable for large-format cells. Alternate test procedures involve triggering 
a short circuit internal to the cell by electrical, mechanical, or thermal means. These 
tests report higher rates of reproducibility and better control over the type of the 
short circuit introduced, short-resistance, location, and time of trigger.
5.3.3.3  Crush Testing
The mechanical integrity of the cells and packs used in large-format applications 
is tested by applying a force equal to 1,000 times the weight of the test article or a 
maximum of 100 kN to 85% of the initial dimension and the load is held for a du-
ration of 15 minutes, after which the test is continued until the strain reaches 50% 
of the original dimension. The tests are repeated on different samples held between 
one flat platen and another with semicircular ridges along each of the three axes of 
orientation.
5.3.3.4  Hot-Box Test
Whereas some standards such as the SAE J2424 call for an open-ended test to de-
termine the maximum temperature at which the cell remains stable “indefinitely,” 
others such as the one developed by the International Energy Commission (IEC 
62660-2) specify a ramp rate of 10°C/min to 130°C followed by storage at that 
temperature for 30 minutes. An equivalent IEEE 1725 standard prescribes a slower 
ramp rate of 5°C/min and storage for a longer duration of 60 minutes. The more 
rigorous test condition at the individual cell level for smaller-format cells in this 
instance is justified by the likelihood of a battery used in consumer electronics to 
be more susceptible more often to high temperature exposure compared to well-
packaged vehicular batteries, for example, that have a good mechanism to carry 
heat away from individual cell surfaces. The emphasis instead is on thermal shock 

136

testing, where the cells or modules are subjected to thermal cycles between -40°C 
and +80°C and held at each extreme for a duration of 1 hour. This test captures 
the heat generation within the module during the high-power cycles and checks for 
any difficulties within the cells in facilitating quick heat transfer across the jelly roll, 
which is typically an issue for cells of larger dimensions.
5.3.3.5  Impact Testing
Whereas mechanical impact testing, such as a drop from a prespecified height, is 
considered a good measure of the individual cell’s mechanical durability, these tests 
provide little information on the safety of large-format cells in a pack. Instead, the 
focus is on mechanical shock due to vibrations or a vehicle undergoing a crash test. 
Accordingly, the acceleration at impact is reduced from those prescribed for single-
cell testing—these usually range from 25 to 50g for vehicular batteries (SAE J2424, 
ISO/CD 12405) to 125 to 175g for cell phone batteries under IEEE 1725.
5.3.3.6  Pressure/Humidity Testing
The electrolyte used in Li-ion batteries is very sensitive to moisture. Any failure 
across the weld on the container or the seal along the pouch leads to exposure of 
the electrolyte to moisture and triggers chemical reactions that result in swelling 
and/or pressure accumulation within the cell. Due to the relatively lower maturity 
in packaging techniques employed to make large-format cells, compared to say, 
the manufacturing process for the 18650 cells, these issues are more prevalent in 
larger cells. Immersion testing under saltwater at 25°C for 2 hours is usually recom-
mended for modules and packs, whereas storage at 0.1 atm pressure for 6 hours is 
commonly used to check for leaks at the cell level. Testing at a higher temperature 
(55°C) or storage at very low temperatures (–17°C/0°F) are also recommended in 
order to reduce the testing duration. However, the lack of an inline test with a pre-
specified metric for leaks or quality of welds during the manufacturing process is an 
issue currently not addressed by the industry.
5.3.3.7  Overcharge Testing
Whereas the ability of the cell to hold charge in excess of 100% SOC is tested ex-
tensively, under various charge rates and durations of exposure to overcharge the 
different testing bodies have identified limited utility in subjecting large-format cells 
or modules and packs to overcharge. This is in part due to the dependence on pro-
tective circuitry to isolate overcharged cells. After several earlier designs of battery 
packs have repeatedly shown the need for additional safety measures, protective 
circuitry for single-cell has been proposed recently for large-format cells in battery 
packs.
5.3.3.8  Fire Hazard
Li-ion batteries have been widely advertised as hazardous when exposed to fire, ow-
ing to the presence of organic solvents and highly reactive chemicals. Flammability 
characterization of Li-ion batteries vary significantly in reporting the amount of 

5.3  Evaluating Battery Safety

heat generated when a battery is subjected to fire. Testing of individual cell as well 
as theoretical calculations place the amount of heat generated from a single cell of 
the order of 150-250 kJ/Ah. The most commonly identified source of fuel in fires 
related to Li-ion batteries has been the packaging material, which in some instances 
amounts to as much as 40% of the pack by weight and exceeds the flammability 
of the batteries themselves by as much as 10 times. With the effect of packaging 
material that may act as fuel, the energy equivalent of fires reported in battery 
warehouses and shipment containers has been estimated to be as high as a few 
megajoules per Ah capacity. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standards 
(J2464 and J2929) recommend exposing the battery to an open flame at 890°C for 
10 minutes to simulate a fuel fire. UL recommends exposing the battery to a lower 
temperature (590°C) for longer durations (20 minutes).
Whereas many of these tests provide at best a repeatable qualitative assessment 
of safety at the individual cell level, further work is necessary to provide more 
measurable insights, such as the ability to gauge the propensity for propagation 
of failure from one damaged cell to others in a multicell module or a pack. Many 
standards such as the SAE J2424, UL 2580, and the FreedomCar EESS Abuse Test 
Manual (SAND2005-3123) discuss propagation, but there are no well-defined re-
quirements beyond setting an individual cell within a representative subunit of 
a pack to get into thermal runaway and monitoring the other parts of the pack 
for propagation. Differences in trade-offs between performance metrics and safety 
within a given operating bound for different applications preclude development of 
quantitative standards for multicell modules. Another key challenge in developing 
safety standards for large-format cells is the wide range of specifications available 
in the market for the cells themselves. As the technology matures, a better degree of 
standardization is expected to contribute to improvements in the test procedures as 
well as safety of the batteries themselves.

Applications
The suitability of a battery to any particular purpose can be reduced to one seem-
ingly simple criterion: can it adequately power the application? However, as dis-
cussed in the previous chapters, the performance of a Li-ion battery is highly 
sensitive to temperature. It also degrades through life at a rate dependent on electri-
cal and thermal cycling characteristics. Further, the electrical and thermal cycling to 
which the device will be subjected over its intended service life may not be defined 
with certainty. Thus, answering this question can become quite complex. The first 
step—understanding the application—is of critical importance and is addressed 
herein. Methods to apply this knowledge to the design of Li-ion battery systems are 
discussed in Chapter 7.
6.1  Battery Requirements
Understanding an application means understanding the requirements it places on 
an energy storage system. These demands can vary substantially from one appli-
cation to the next, but a similar set of data is often required. They typically span 
electrical, thermal, mechanical, and safety topic areas.
6.1.1  Electrical Requirements
The energy and power demanded of a battery are often defined by one or more 
electrical duty cycles. When known, it is best to acquire these duty cycles as time 
histories of either power or current. However, often this level of detail is not known 
with a good degree of certainty. In place of high-resolution data, the duty cycle can 
instead be represented by its total duration, average, and RMS power or current, 
and minimum and maximum power or current coupled with a predetermined dura-
tion. Table 6.1 shows these values as computed for an example peak shaving duty 
cycle shown in Figure 6.1.
A quick look at Figure 6.1 and Table 6.1 reveals that significant information 
can be lost in such a simple translation. For example, Figure 6.1 reveals that the 
peak discharge power requirement occurs early in the discharge. Where a conser-
vative designer is given only the information in Table 6.1, he or she may assume 
the peak power discharge comes at the end of the discharge. Working with such an 
assumption may result in a larger battery than actually needed. Further, the peak 

140

discharge duration is only specified for 1 minute; however, the nature of the profile 
is such that a battery that meets this peak duration may not be capable of the sup-
plying the actual duty cycle. A more conservative translation may be to specify a 
peak discharge power requirement of 12.4 kW for 10 minutes.
It is not atypical that the discharge duty cycle be defined succinctly while the 
charge duty cycle is defined more ambiguously. For example, a discharge profile 
may be specified per Figure 6.1, and a charge profile may be specified simply by 
a maxium available power or current and an accompanying duration. This allows 
the battery system to manage its own charge profile to maximize performance and 
safety (e.g., implementing a taper charge as the battery reaches its maximum volt-
age). In other cases, it may be necessary for the battery to absorb all the energy that

is provided to it. Care should be taken to clarify when this is the case, as it can have 
a large impact on the design of the system.
The total number and frequency of occurrence must also be defined. The num-
ber and frequency of occurrence affects battery wear in the long term, but also im-
pacts the battery’s thermal response in the short term. For example, a given charge-
discharge cycle may be easily achievable when performed once per day, but when 
performed 10 times per day the increased heat generation and reduced cooldown 
periods may lead to unacceptably high battery temperature.
When multiple duty cycles are specified, the sequence in which they occur is 
also important. In the short term it can impact thermal response as previously 
noted (e.g., sequential high-power discharge and charge operations may induce un-
acceptably high battery temperatures), while in the long term it could affect degra-
dation patterns and the ability to meet performance requirements (e.g., increasing 
versus decreasing DOD through life).
6.1.2  Thermal Requirements
The thermal environment that the battery must operate in must also be properly 
defined. Ideally, the correlation of thermal environment to the electrical duty cycle 
will be specified. Most frequently, this is accomplished by dividing thermal limits 
into operational and survival limits. For example, the battery may be required to 
complete its electrical duty cycle in an environment ranging from –10°C to +40°C, 
while it may be required to survive (but not operate) in a more extreme –30°C to 
+60°C. Given the reduced power capabilities of batteries at low temperatures, it is 
also common to couple a less demanding electrical duty cycle to the lowest tempera-
tures of the operational band.
It is important to note that the specification of environmental temperature is 
different than specifying battery temperature. By specifying environmental tem-
perature we must recognize that electrical operation will generally result in heat 
generation and increased battery temperatures. At high environmental temperature 
we must therefore be sure to assess the maximum battery temperature that will be 
achieved and its negative impacts on degradation and safety. At low environmental 
temperatures, however, we can leverage the battery’s self-heating effect to improve 
performance.
6.1.3  Mechanical Requirements
While there is, at present, a lack of publicly available data relating mechanical en-
vironmental factors, such as vibration and shock, to electrochemical performance 
and long-term degradation, such exposure is known to be capable of damaging 
electrical pathways both within and between cells. These factors can also affect 
balance of systems components such as disconnect relays and charge balancing 
systems. Further, extreme mechanical abuse such as crush or impact that results in 
mechanical deformation can create hazardous short circuits within the system. For 
these reasons it is also necessary to specify mechanical requirements for the system.
Two common mechanical requirements are shock and random vibration. 
The former corresponds to exposure of the battery to very short duration accel-
eration events, while the latter concerns longer duration exposure to nonperiodic 

142 
������������
Applications
vibrations. Both shock and random vibration requirements are typically specified 
by a power spectral density (PSD) plot, direction, and in the case of random vibra-
tions, a duration. PSDs are generally created from the discretization of measured or 
simulated time histories of acceleration by frequency.
Vibration requirements may also include tolerance to sine sweeps, where a si-
nusoidal vibration pattern is applied that slowly increases or decreases in frequency 
over time. While such exposure is uncommon in the application itself, testing the 
battery via a sine sweep is beneficial for identifying the system’s natural frequen-
cies. Such testing is also used to develop mathematical models that capture the 
mechanical failure of a component as a function of the storage and loss moduli.
Impact and intrusion requirements may also be pertinent, particularly for ve-
hicular applications. Specifying such requirements can be challenging due to the 
unpredictable nature of crush events in the field. Therefore, most specifications are 
designed around an intended test method. It may be likely that these requirements 
are coupled with abuse response specifications.
6.1.4  Safety/Abuse Requirements
Requirements for abuse tolerance of a battery vary by application and become most 
important when human safety is a factor in manned applications. Most frequently, 
abuse tolerance requirements demand that a battery system be capable of enduring 
one or more off-nominal conditions while maintaining all temperatures and any gas 
expulsion below a threshold level and without the presence of fire or explosion. The 
off-nominal conditions that may be specified include over- and under-temperature, 
over- and under- voltage, short-circuit exposure, or mechanical deformation. It may 
also be required that these criteria are met in the presence of one or more systems 
failures (e.g., the failure of a fuse) to encourage added redundancy.
6.2  Automotive Applications
There are many applications for batteries in the automobile. SLI, start-stop, and 
HEV applications are discussed briefly herein, although we do not consider them 
large applications and therefore will not treat them thereafter. PHEV and battery 
electric vehicle (BEV) applications are discussed here and will be employed for fur-
ther discussion in this book since we consider these batteries as falling under the 
category of large-format batteries.
6.2.1  Drive Cycles
Drive cycles—histories of velocity of a given vehicle versus time—are an important 
input for vehicle simulation and analysis. Real-world drive cycles have been re-
corded from drivers around the world to characterize the speeds and accelerations 
that are typically requested of vehicles. Studies of these data have shown that sig-
nificant variability exists between different drivers. Rather than analyze every real-
world drive cycle, which is clearly infeasible, standardized drive cycles are often 
used instead. As discussed in [1], the relative aggressiveness of standardized drive 
cycles may depend on the vehicle platform. To this end, the National Renewable 

6.2  Automotive Applications 
143
Energy Laboratory (NREL) has developed a drive cycle that produces fuel con-
sumption numbers indicative of median driver aggressiveness for conventional ve-
hicles (CVs), HEVs, PHEVs, and BEVs. A summary of this and other common drive 
cycles is presented in Table 6.2.
Besides drive cycle specification, the requirements on batteries used in SLI, 
microhybrid, and power-assist HEV batteries are slightly different. The following 
sections briefly outline the requirements for these applications before entering a 
detailed discussion on the PHEV and BEV batteries.
6.2.2  SLI
SLI batteries are commonplace in combustion engine vehicles. They serve primar-
ily for starting the engine; this application requires a high power-to-energy ratio 
by itself (typically on the order of 6 kW for 6 seconds). This operation is generally 
expected to be performed on the order of 10 times per day for ~5 years. The ability 
to perform at low temperatures is critical and typically drives the sizing of the bat-
tery. However, this application also demands that the battery buffer the output of 
the vehicle’s onboard electrical generator (alternator) to support operational electri-
cal loads and provide additional energy for key-off auxiliary loads (750W for >10 
minutes) and standby loads (15 mA for 30 days). The battery is recharged by the 
vehicle’s alternator when the engine is running. The charging system and vehicle 
loads are designed to operate at 12V nominally. Lead-acid batteries have dominated 
this application for decades due to their simplicity and low cost. Typically, these 
batteries are sized at ~500 Wh (12V and ~40 Ah).
6.2.3  Start-Stop (Micro) Hybrids
Recently, start-stop hybrid (also called microhybrid) vehicles were introduced in 
the market. These vehicles stop the engine every time the vehicle comes to a stop, 
to reduce idling periods, thereby reducing fuel consumption and emissions. This

increases demand on the battery on top of regular SLI applications in two primary 
ways. First, the number of times the battery is asked to start the engine increases 
by an order of magnitude. Analysis of real-world drive cycles in [2] indicates that 
73 start events per day may be expected for the 95th-percentile driver. Second, the 
battery must power auxiliary loads when the vehicle is stopped.
While analysis has shown that the total energy requirement imposed by such 
operations (~56 Wh) is not significantly larger than that of the SLI application, 
it does impose significantly different cycling requirements on the battery. As can 
be seen in Figure 6.2, a start-stop hybrid requires a battery to perform numerous 
but short auxiliary load discharges followed by an engine-start discharge through 
the battery’s operational range. Traditional lead-acid batteries are known to ex-
hibit poor cycle life to such partial-state-of-charge cycles, and are thus ill-suited 
for this application. Advanced lead-acid batteries and other chemistries—including 
Li-ion—are good candidates for this application.
6.2.4  Power Assist Hybrids
In power-assist HEVs, a battery performs the functions similar to that in a start-
stop hybrid, but also provides power for propulsion via an electric motor/genera-
tor attached either directly to the combustion engine or to the driven wheels via a 
transmission. This enables the combustion engine to be downsized, forcing it to 
work more frequently at a larger percentage of its maximum power output, and 
thereby a point of higher thermal efficiency. The battery is charged during decel-
eration events, capturing kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost as heat in the 
Figure 6.2  Example of a start-stop battery duty cycle and the simulated state-of-charge variation.

6.2  Automotive Applications 
145
vehicle’s friction brakes and providing it later for acceleration. Together these ef-
fects can greatly decrease per-mile emissions and fuel consumption in comparison 
to a conventionally powered vehicle.
HEV batteries operate primarily in a charge-sustaining (CS) mode, where the 
battery SOC will swing up and down briefly during regenerative deceleration and 
power-assist acceleration events, but is approximately constant when viewed at 
longer time scales. Note that HEVs do not have the capability of charging their 
batteries from an external source.
The requirements placed on the battery by such operation modes are much 
more rigorous than those of start-stop or SLI automotive applications. Drive cycle 
analysis shows [3] that as little as ~600 Wh of available energy can be sufficient 
to yield significant fuel economy benefits in light-duty vehicle, but the required 
power levels can be extremely high in comparison (> 30 kW, translating to effective 
C-rates near 50). Combined with nearly continuous current flow during vehicle 
operation, this can result in significant amounts of heat generation. Due to the 
typical expense and complexity of these high-voltage batteries (~150 to ~400V in 
light-duty vehicles and up to ~800V in medium- and heavy-duty vehicle), they are 
often designed to last the life of the vehicle (15 years and more).
As such, high-power, long-life chemistries are required for HEV applications. 
NiMH has been the most broadly deployed chemistry in HEV applications to date. 
However, Li-ion batteries are becoming more commonplace in HEVs in recent 
years, likely due to their higher specific energy, energy density, and cell voltage, as 
well as their declining price. High-energy capacitor derivatives (ultra-, super-, and 
asymmetric capacitors) are also being explored for low-energy HEVs due to their 
high power and long cycle life at larger DODs.
6.2.5  Plug-In Hybrids
A PHEV includes similar drivetrain components as an HEV; however, the size of 
the electric motor/generator and battery are significantly larger, and a charger is 
included to enable the battery to be charged from an external source. When the bat-
tery SOC is higher than a predetermined value, the vehicle operates in the charge-
depleting (CD) mode. Here, higher levels of power and energy are drawn from 
the battery and SOC continually decreases as the vehicle is driven. If the system 
can source sufficiently high levels of power (e.g., from regenerative braking when 
driving downhill), the CD mode can be a purely electric mode of operation. Alter-
natively, the vehicle may be designed such that the combustion engine turns on to 
provide high power levels, when requested, in the CD mode. Once the battery is 
depleted to a predetermined SOC, the vehicle switches to the CS mode and oper-
ates like a HEV, with the combustion engine providing the majority of the required 
driving energy. The response of the battery and vehicle in each mode, as well as the 
transition between the two, is shown in Figure 6.3. As such, the driving range of a 
PHEV is not restricted by the energy of the battery.
The powertrain of a PHEV can be configured in one of three different architec-
tures to create either a through-the-road, parallel, or series PHEV (Figure 6.4). In 
a through-the-road PHEV, the combustion engine powers one pair of drive wheels 
while the electric drivetrain powers the other pair. A proper control strategy is criti-
cal in such a configuration so as to not upset the dynamics of the vehicle. In a parallel 

146 
������������
Applications
PHEV, both the combustion engine and electric motor/generator are mechanically 
connected to the driven wheels. This is typical of how HEVs are constructed, and 
allows the combustion engine to operate similar to that of a conventional vehicle. 
In a series PHEV, the combustion engine is connected only to a generator, and the 
driven wheels are connected only to an electric motor. A series PHEV allows the 
full decoupling of the speed of the combustion engine from the speed of the vehicle 
itself, as there is no mechanical connection between the two. This can potentially 
increase the effective thermal efficiency of the combustion engine. Furthermore, 
the series PHEV offers the dynamic benefits of a full electric drivetrain even if the 
combustion engine is providing the electricity. However, the series PHEV suffers 
from efficiency losses in transmitting the energy from the combustion engine to 
Figure 6.3  Example of a PHEV battery’s response in the CD and CS modes.

6.2  Automotive Applications 
147
the wheels, since it must first convert the engine’s mechanical energy to electrical 
energy with the generator and then convert this back to mechanical energy via the 
electric motor. The series architecture also requires more electrical componentry, 
and can thus increase the cost and weight of the vehicle.
When a series PHEV is designed such that the battery can provide a large CD 
range and enough power to meet all of the vehicle’s needs without intervention 
from the combustion engine, it may be referred to as an extended-range electric 
vehicle (EREV). For example, the 2012 Chevrolet Volt has a battery that is capable 
of providing a range of 37 miles [4] and supplying enough power to meet all of the 
vehicle’s dynamic requirements without assistance from the combustion engine.
Creating duty cycles for PHEV battery design and testing are challenged by 
the sensitivity of the cycle to the vehicle platform, system architecture, the control 
strategy for the battery, and so forth, as with HEVs, but today, designers must also 
approach the questions of external charge frequency and the distribution of CS 
and CD mode operations. For example, drivers who charge the battery overnight 
at home and travel relatively short distances before returning home may find that 
they can operate their PHEV almost solely in CD mode on one charge a day. This 
Figure 6.4  Through-the-road, parallel, and series type PHEV architectures.

would imply a duty cycle with one charge event per day and little to no CS opera-
tion. However, other drivers with long distances between charge events may charge 
the battery infrequently and operate predominantly in CS mode, or, if they have 
access to at-work or public charging stations, they may charge the battery several 
times per day and operate in the CD mode primarily. Which duty cycle is most 
taxing on the battery will depend on the nature of the battery chemistry, thermal 
characteristics of the system, and other factors.
As with HEVs, developing a set of duty cycles that cover all worst-case sce-
narios for a particular PHEV is possible within the course of a vehicle development 
program, provided access to sufficient vehicular and customer data is available. 
For the purpose of broader study, the standardized cycles of Table 6.2 may prove 
useful. However, in either case, a detailed vehicle simulator is necessary to translate 
the vehicle drive profile into an electrical duty cycle. Freely available software like 
FASTSim can be readily applied [5] for this task.
The United States Advanced Battery Consortium (USABC) has also developed 
technology targets for PHEV batteries, as presented in Table 6.4. Note that these 
values are generalized and that battery requirements will vary by specific vehicle 
model. Information on the development of these targets can be found in [7]. While 
it can be seen from these targets that PHEV batteries operate at a lower average

C-rate than HEV batteries, the PHEV batteries are still often required to operate in 
the 5 to 10 C-rate range. They may also be required to complete several large DOD 
cycles approximately on a daily basis, which can make meeting lifetime require-
ments challenging. The inclusion of both electric and combustion powered drive-
trains into one vehicle also makes the volume, mass, and cost requirements more 
demanding of the battery, necessitating high energy density and specific energy at 
low cost. This combination of high power, high energy, long life, and low cost can 
be an extremely difficult combination of metrics to achieve. Thus, PHEV battery 
requirements may be considered the most challenging of all automotive battery 
applications. 
While lead-acid offers an attractive cost point for this application, its energy 
density and specific energy are wholly insufficient to meet the battery requirements 
of PHEVs. NiMH technologies suffer similar challenges, albeit at a higher price 
point. The Li-ion battery is at present the chemistry of choice for PHEV applica-
tions, as it offers the highest energy density and specific energy among today’s 
battery chemistries when designed to best meet the other requirements. However, 
delivering the required lifetime, cold temperature performance, and cost at the lev-
els requested by the USABC are still a challenge. 
6.2.6  BEVs
The drive train of a BEV consists solely of a battery and an electric motor. It oper-
ates entirely in the CD mode without assistance from a combustion engine. Thus, 
while energy is captured from regenerative braking events, the battery SOC is in a 
state of decline on an average when driving. The energy and power of the battery, 
as well as the power of the electric motor, is generally required to be much larger 
than those of PHEVs and HEVs. And unlike PHEVs and HEVs, the driving range 
of a BEV is determined by the energy of the battery. Once the battery is depleted, 
it must be recharged from an external source (or replaced with a freshly charged 
battery, if battery swapping infrastructure is available [8]) before further travel can 
be completed.
Creating short-term duty cycles for BEVs is somewhat simplified relative to 
PHEVs and HEVs. As the battery is the only source of propulsion, a vehicle’s veloc-
ity profile can be translated readily to a battery power request. Interaction from a 
combustion engine need not be considered. The USABC has provided a test cycle 
recommended for BEVs, although it is a coarse simplification of the BEV battery’s 
operation.
Alternatively, it is relatively straightforward to create a battery power profile 
from real-world or standardized drive cycles using vehicle simulation software such 
as FASTSim, as discussed earlier. However, the sequencing of duty cycles through 
life must be considered, and is primarily dependent on consumer driving patterns. 
For example, like the prior PHEV example, some drivers may charge their battery 
daily and drive relatively short distances. Other drivers may leverage at-work or 
public charging infrastructure to cycle their battery multiple times per day. For 
some, this may include the use of fast chargers that can recharge 80% of the bat-
tery’s capacity in say, 30 minutes, inducing addition wear and thermal stress on the 
battery.

150 
������������
Applications
Further, the climate in which the vehicle is operated is important. Due to the 
generally larger battery capacity, lower C-rates, and shorter continuous operational 
periods seen in BEV batteries relative to PHEV and HEV batteries, the environment 
can become the largest determining factor in determining the average operating 
temperature of the battery. Auxiliary loads can also impact battery operational re-
quirements, as they must be solely sourced from the battery. As well, cabin heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads generally dominate here, and are 
highly dependent on the local climate. It is important to recognize that there is no 
significant source of waste heat available to heat the cabin in BEVs, as is the case 
with conventional and hybrid vehicles.
All of these factors can affect the three critical BEV performance metrics: ve-
hicle range, utility factor, and battery wear patterns. With respect to vehicle perfor-
mance requirements, range often becomes the most important metric. This is due to 
the needs of consumers based on their travel patterns in addition to their potential 
range anxiety. Range anxiety effectively adds a safety margin to the vehicle range a 
consumer demands to reduce the likelihood of becoming stranded when the battery 
is depleted. Identifying an optimum range for a BEV is challenged in large part due 
to the lack of available driving pattern data from potential consumers. Such data 
must provide adequate resolution to accurately calculate the fraction of driving a 
given consumer will be able to complete with a BEV of a specific range under a 
specific infrastructure availability scenario (e.g., at-home charging, at-work charg-
ing, public fast charging). Most rigorously, year-long trip data including the time, 
distance, and destination of each trip taken for each specific individual is required. 
While such data sources are few and far between, analysis of 3 months of data 
from each of 398 drivers data collected in the Travel Choices Study [9] can yield 
some insight into the relation between vehicle range and utility. Figure 6.5 shows 
how the fraction of these drivers who can complete their original driving range on 
70%, 80%, 90%, and 99% of days with a BEV varies with vehicle range. This plot 
shows that a 100-mile BEV would provide sufficient range on 7 out of every 10 
driving days for nearly all of these drivers, and 9 out of every 10 driving days for 
more than 90% of these drivers. However, it only completely satisfies the driving 
needs of ~35% of these drivers. This is due to the fact that while these drivers com-
monly complete fewer than 100 miles per day, they occasionally take much lon-
ger trips that greatly exceed 100 miles per day. Accordingly, achieving widespread 
100% BEV utility factors will require either extremely long-range vehicles, the 
ability to extend BEV range conveniently with infrastructure, or significant changes 
in consumer behavior.
Identifying the optimal BEV range is a question of interest. At the time of writ-
ing this book, the majority of the BEVs on the market offer an EPA rated range of 
~80 miles. While the consistency across the market may lead one to believe that 
the automotive manufacturers have decided this range to be optimum, this is not 
the case. Instead, the manufacturers have designed BEVs to yield a 100 mile or 
greater range when measured using the UDDS—a requirement of the California 
Air Resource Board’s (CARB) zero emissions vehicle (ZEV) program. Thus, these 
vehicles have been designed to achieve ZEV credits at the lowest possible vehicle 
manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP).
Increasing BEV range is a major goal of the automotive industry, however. 
The primary impediments to doing so are battery volume, mass, and cost. The

USABC has recently updated their battery technology requirements that drive fu-
ture battery development. As presented in Table 6.4, it is clear that the industry 
has ambitious targets for energy density, specific energy, and battery cost to enable 
cost-effective, longer-range BEVs. While Li-ion is the best battery technology for 
meeting these targets at present, batteries will need to undergo significant improve-
ments to reach these goals. Advanced high-energy-density candidates are therefore 
also under investigation for BEV applications, including solid-state Li-ion, lithium 
air, and others.
6.3  Grid Applications
In 2011, electricity service in the United States alone was a $371 billion/year indus-
try, delivering approximately 4.1 × 106 GWh of electricity with a peak power of 
782 GW [11], and yet there was only approximately ~23 GW of energy storage, of 
which ~95% was pumped hydro storage [12]. Thus, unlike almost every other in-
dustry, the electricity industry operates with practically no warehouse for its prod-
uct, but rather continuously synchronizes supply and demand. 
Increasing the amount of grid-connected energy storage can dramatically 
change the way the grid operates, improving both reliability and quality of service. 
There are many different services that energy storage can provide to the electric-
ity grid. The U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Energy Storage Handbook [13]

classifies these applications into five different categories as listed in Table 6.5. A de-
tailed description of each specific service can be found in the DOE/ Electric Power 
Research Institute (EPRI) Electricity Storage Handbook [13]. Herein, we list the 
primary performance metrics for each service—the amount of power required, the 
target discharge duration for one cycle, and the number of expected cycles per year. 
Numerous studies have been performed to quantify the monetary value of 
these services to the grid [14, 15] in search of avenues to increase the amount of 
energy storage installed on the grid. It is generally found that a single energy stor-
age system must provide multiple services to justify the cost of the hardware, instal-
lation, and maintenance. To aggregate services as such, it is important to consider 
geographical, regulatory, and ownership requirements of each service, as well as 
the ability to marry the duty cycles of different applications.
For example, providing distribution infrastructure services requires the energy 
storage system be physically installed near the distribution assets it serves; regula-
tions may prevent a single energy storage system from collecting revenue for both 
transmission infrastructure and bulk energy services; customer-owned, behind-the-
meter energy storage systems can provide customer energy management service but 
may not be eligible to participate in ancillary markets.
When designing applications for Li-ion systems, it is additionally important to 
consider the strengths of competing energy storage technologies. Pumped-hydro 
storage (PHS) currently makes up the majority of installed energy storage. Its cost 
is extremely low on a per-kWh basis; however, it is impractical to install small PHS

systems, and it is a geographically limited technology—further expansion of PHS 
on the grid is constrained by the availability of relevant sites for PHS and resistance 
due to their environmental impact. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) is simi-
lar in that it requires specific geological structures to operate and must be installed 
as a large system, although related technology that could be installed more flexibly 
is under development.
Batteries offer the grid a much more flexible means of energy storage that can 
be installed at a smaller scale with fewer geographical and environmental con-
straints and yet a limited number of battery installations—primarily lead acid and 
sodium sulfur—have been completed to date [13, 16]. While the former suffers 
from sensitivity to high temperature environments and poor cycle life, the latter is 
largely impervious to high environmental temperatures (sodium sulfur is a high-
temperature chemistry that operates above 300°C) and can provide excellent high 
DOD cycle life [13]. The downside of sodium sulfur batteries is that they are rate-
limited: the maximum discharge rate of a sodium sulfur battery is ~C/7. The so-
dium nickel chloride chemistry, which is very similar, can operate at higher rates, 
but is still limited to ~C/2.
More recently, a small number of grid-connected Li-ion battery installations 
have been completed [13]. Relative to alternate energy storage options, Li-ion’s 
primary advantages in the grid energy storage markets are its ability to be installed 
flexibly in sizes ranging from 1 kW to hundreds of MW, to operate at high C-
rates, and to provide a long cycle life. It also offers the benefit of low mass and 
volume, which, despite what may be viewed as less of a constraint under common

perception, can actually be quite important for space-constrained stationary ap-
plications. Considering these advantages alongside the technical requirements and 
economic benefits of the grid energy storage services as shown on Table 6.5, Li-ion 
batteries can yield several attractive use scenarios for batteries on the grid, as out-
lined in the next section.
6.3.1  Demand Charge Management and Uninterruptable Power Sources
Demand charges are a feature of many utility rate structures for commercial cus-
tomers that charge a fee based on peak power rather than total energy. The peak 
power is often recorded by dividing each month into 15-minute intervals, then 
selecting the interval yielding the largest 15-minute average power to determine the 
fee charged. These rate structures often consist of different demand charges for on-
peak, midpeak, and off-peak periods that vary by season. Excerpts of an example 
demand charge rate structure from Southern California Edison (SCE) (serving the 
Los Angeles, CA area) are shown in Table 6.6. With a behind-the-meter energy stor-
age system, the said system can be employed to discharge the battery during high 
demand periods, reducing the meter load and thereby the demand charge.
Performed perfectly, this service could be worth more than $232/kW/yr for 
customers of SCE’s TOU-GS-2-B rate schedule. However, it must be recognized 
that for each additional kilowatt of power added to the system, a greater amount 
of energy must be added as well, as illustrated in Figure 6.6. Thus, the annualized

return on investment generally decreases as the power of the energy storage system 
increases. One study of the value of demand charge management (DCM) has found 
that ES is most cost effective when power is scaled to ~5% to 10% of facility peak 
power [18].
The reader will note that some energy/time-shifting value is also likely to be ac-
crued, as the battery is likely to discharge during on-peak periods and charge dur-
ing off-peak periods. However, this value will generally be an order of magnitude 
smaller than the value of DCM.
Intelligent control and forecasting systems are also necessary to implement 
DCM services effectively. Battery dispatch for peak reduction must be done in such 
a way that the battery does not prematurely run out of energy prior to a period of 
peak demand. Due to the fact that demand charges are calculated on the peak load 
interval observed over the entire month, only one such mistake during the course 
of each month is sufficient to eliminate that month’s entire financial benefit. De-
veloping an optimal control to command battery dispatch in the presence of an ac-
curate forecast is relatively straightforward. However, developing accurate demand 
forecasts, or, alternatively, control strategies that require less accurate forecasts, are 
more challenging.
Implemented aggressively on a customer facility with a diurnal demand cycle, 
battery power levels will fluctuate considerably and may even oscillate rapidly be-
tween charge and discharge in response to facility demand. But battery SOC will 
generally trend downward until the facility demand is consistently below the peak 
shaving load target. An example response of a system using a perfect load forecast 
and an optimal controller targeting a minimum battery SOC of 40% is illustrated 
in Figure 6.7.
Frequency of such operations will depend on the control strategy, system siz-
ing, forecast horizon, and consistency of the facility load. At minimum, it should 
be expected that one such discharge will occur per month. This can be the case 
when facility load is consistently decreasing over the course of the month, or when 
a highly accurate, long time horizon forecast is available. Alternatively, such cycles 
may be required on a daily basis. This is usually the case when facility load is con-
sistent from day to day or when facility load increases day to day and only short-
term forecasts are available.
If the facility load is not diurnal, and instead dominated by customer-specific 
load peaks (perhaps due to business-specific processes), duty cycles and cycle fre-
quency will be much different. Indeed, demand pattern variability is high between 
different customers and the demand charge management value varies accordingly. 
Thus, battery duty cycles must be considered on a case-by-case basis to support 
system design.
An uninterruptable power source is any device that provides a reliability ser-
vice to an individual customer from behind the meter. The value of this service will 
be specific to the customer’s intended use. For example, the telecommunications 
industry places a high value on keeping its towers operating during power outages, 
and information technology companies place a high value on keeping their serv-
ers operational. Both industries can place a specific dollar value on each minute 
their services are interrupted. Such industries can use a Li-ion system to totally 
mitigate the effects of short outages (<1 hour) or as a bridging system to allow 

156 
������������
Applications
seamless transition from grid-supplied power to backup-generator-supplied power 
for longer outages.
The unanticipated interruption of manufacturing processes, on the other hand, 
can cause damage to in-process product and equipment. For example, consider the 
final stages of computer-controlled machining of precision products; loss of power 
to the machining operation will irreparably damage the nearly finished product 
and also damage the machining tools. Such industries can thereby place a dollar 
value on each outage event. Here, Li-ion systems can provide a seamless transition 
to battery-backup power for a short duration (<1 hour) to allow the safe shutdown 
of manufacturing equipment. The addition of long duration backup power genera-
tion is not needed.
Battery duty cycles will of course be specific to the customer and nature of their 
requirements. Similarly, cycling frequency will depend on the customer’s service 
territory and quality of service. However, it can generally be assumed that the bat-
tery will be required to discharge infrequently at a largely constant power level for 
a period of 15 to 60 minutes.
Given that both applications are behind-the-meter applications, there is no 
geographical conflict when pairing the two. Their thermal, environmental, inter-
connection, and abuse requirements are also similar. Thermal requirements will 
depend on whether the system is to be installed inside or outside of the customer fa-
cility. If the system is installed inside the facility, the designer must identify whether 
the interior installation site is HVAC-controlled and whether the existing facility

HVAC system will be sufficient to accommodate the needs of and heat generated 
by the battery. Mechanically, it will be necessary for the system to be tolerant to 
expected earthquake loads per the California Building Code or International Build-
ing Code, if it is to supply UPS service. It is also likely it must comply with the UL’s 
Standard for Uninterruptible Power Supply Equipment UL 1778.
However, pairing the electrical duty cycles such that the demand charge man-
agement and uninterruptible power source services do not conflict poses a larger 
challenge. While it is impossible for the demand for each service to exist simultane-
ously, the need to provide the services sequentially is problematic. If the battery is 
fully discharged following an aggressive demand charge management event when 
a UPS event occurs, UPS service may not be adequately supplied. Conversely, if a 
single DCM discharge is missed in anticipation of a UPS event, significant DCM 
value can be lost. Accurate ability to forecast DCM and UPS events is thus ex-
tremely important to this pairing.
Understanding the nature of UPS events can help determine whether pairing 
such applications is viable. For example, outages caused by high service-area-wide 
demand periods that induce failure of utility equipment, and thereby service inter-
ruptions, may be likely to follow DCM discharges. In this case, the pairing of DCM 
and UPS services may not be practical. On the other hand, if the primary source of 
outages is due to storms or other exogenous factors, pairing UPS and DCM may 
be more readily achieved (particularly when the exogenous events are predictable).
Another point that must be considered when pairing these applications is sys-
tem sizing. As noted above, optimal return on investment for DCM systems gener-
ally occur when sized for low power levels relative to the facility’s peak demand 
(<10%). While it is generally unnecessary for a UPS service to back up the entire fa-
cility load, it is not guaranteed that the fraction of loads in need of backup will per-
fectly coincide with the power and energy capabilities of a value-optimized DCM 
system. Thus, the level of DCM service and number of loads to be backed up must 
be carefully considered when selecting the power and energy levels of the system.
6.3.2  Area Regulation and Transportable Asset Upgrade Deferral
Area regulation is an ancillary service intended to ensure that the electricity supply 
precisely matches electricity demand over short time periods. This creates the need 
to increase (upregulation) or decrease (downregulation) the amount of electrical en-
ergy on the grid. It is common for conventional (combustion) generation to provide 
area regulation alongside a separate energy service by operating at an output less 
than its maximum capacity for the energy service, thereby leaving headroom for up 
regulation by increasing its output. For example, a 1-MW gas-powered turbine may 
elect to operate at 800 kW to provide the energy service, then offer 200 kW for up-
regulation with its remaining unused capacity. It may also elect to offer 200 kW for 
downregulation, which would reduce its output to 600 kW to remove energy from 
the grid. While in theory a conventional generator could offer downregulation to 
an output of 0 kW, in practice conventional generators have minimum load points 
below which it becomes impractical to operate. Once these bounds are set, the 
regulation output of the plant at any given time is set in response to an automatic 
generation control (AGC) signal provided by the local balancing authority. 

158 
������������
Applications
Energy storage, on the other hand, can respond to upregulation requests by dis-
charging and downregulation requests by charging. Thus a 1-MW storage system 
can offer its full 1 MW in either direction (provided the system is not fully charged 
or discharged at the moment of the request). Compared to conventional generation, 
it also often has the advantage of fast response. Conventional generation typically 
has ramp rates on the order of minutes or more; thus, there can be considerable 
delay between a change in the AGC and a change in output of the generator. Stor-
age typically has response times of seconds or less, and thus can respond to requests 
by the balancing authority almost instantaneously. This improvement in response 
time can significantly reduce the total amount of regulation (as measured in mega-
watts) necessary to balance the grid. In recognition of this fact, recent regulation 
has implemented a pay-for-performance requirement that will pay fast-responding 
technologies twice as much as slow-ramping resources for regulation service, mak-
ing regulation a profitable value proposition for many storage technologies [19].
It is also important, however, to consider the efficiency of the energy storage 
system. While it will be paid for the energy delivered during upregulation, it must 
pay for the energy consumed during downregulation. This is above and beyond 
area regulation payments. Thus, energy storage systems with low round-trip ef-
ficiency will be financially penalized.
When providing area regulation services, a battery operates nearly continuous-
ly at highly variable power levels, switching often between charge and discharge. 
Future demands on the battery are largely unpredictable, presenting a challenge to 
the designer in deciding how the battery will respond to the AGC signal (or similar) 
in such a manner as to maximize the value of the system. Disparities in the value of 
upregulation and downregulation value, system efficiency, thermal response, bat-
tery degradation, and historical AGC signal data must all be considered. Figure 6.8 
shows the impact of one potential strategy for designing an area regulation energy 
storage control strategy that results in many small SOC cycles and an occasional 
large SOC cycle.
Transmission and distribution upgrade deferral both pertain to the use of an 
energy storage system to reduce loads on expensive transmission or distribution 
equipment that are approaching their load limits, thereby deferring the replace-
ment of said asset(s). For example, consider a transmission line with a100-MW 
limit. If this limit is exceeded, the transmission line will overload thermally and fail. 
The transmission planner anticipates that the load on this line is growing at a rate 
such that it will become overloaded by 1 MW in July next year when demand peaks 
for the season. The transmission planner has two options: (1) begin and complete 
a $10M project to upgrade the transmission line before the overage occurs, or (2) 
find a way to eliminate the 1-MW July overages. Option 2 can be implemented 
with an energy storage system placed at the consumption end of the transmission 
line commanded to perform up to 1 MW of peak shaving when transmission line 
loads exceed 100 MW. The avoided cost of deferring the large-scale transmission 
upgrade can be determined by the cost that would be passed through to the rate 
payer for the upgrade. This is calculated as the annual fixed charge rate (0.08 to 
0.15, typically) times the total capital investment. In this example, the avoided cost 
is $1.1M for a 0.11 fixed charge rate. Thus, if an energy system can be procured 
and operated on-site effectively for the month of July for less than $1.1M, then op-
tion 2 is the more cost-effective option.

6.3  Grid Applications 
159
Asset upgrade deferral can be a financially attractive use of energy storage. The 
need to discharge the system can be quite infrequent, on the order of 10 or fewer 
instances per year. It can also be relatively easy for some storage technologies to 
perform, requiring average C-rates of C/2 and lower. However, service value and 
technical requirements are extremely site-specific. Thus, like the DCM and UPS 
applications discussed earlier, the system designer must approach each potential 
installation separately to optimize a system.
Further, care must be taken in attempting multiyear deferrals. In cases where 
load is expected to grow continually, the peak shaving power and energy require-
ments will grow as well. Notably, the requirement for energy is likely to increase 
much faster than the requirement for power (Figure 6.9), which can quickly de-
grade project economics. Thus, 1- to 2-year deferrals are often most cost effective.
For this reason, it is attractive to employ a transportable storage system for 
this service. A transportable system would be capable of not only serving different 
sites in sequential years, but could potentially serve multiple sites in the same year. 
While identification of sites where this is possible is challenging, it could poten-
tially double the profitability of the system. For such transportable systems, energy 
density and specific energy become more important performance metrics, as does 
mechanical robustness to survive the transport environment. These requirements 
give Li-ion a strong advantage over competing technologies like flow and lead acid 
batteries (energy density and specific energy), as well as sodium sulfur batteries 
(mechanical robustness, C-rate).
Combining area regulation and asset upgrade deferral is somewhat straight-
forward. Geographic considerations must be given to the asset upgrade deferral

service with the restriction that only site is acceptable for also providing regulation 
services. The system will likely be a stand-alone unit sized >100 kW packaged in 
a shipping container to facilitate transportation that is installed and operated out-
doors. Thermal requirements will be driven by the operating environment and the 
area regulation service. The continuous operation, and the fact that the inverter 
will often be installed in the same container, will likely require an active cooling 
system. Mechanical requirements will be designed around the shipping environ-
ment, number of sites per year to be served, and total service life of the unit.
Logistically, a third party could own and operate the energy storage system, 
selling ancillary services to the market and asset deferral services to the transmis-
sion operator. Assuming that the device is to be installed and operated from a single 
location for 10 to 12 months at a time, it could provide regulation services at all 
times that the asset to be serviced is below its contracted load limit. When a near 
term forecast (1 to 2 days) predicts that the load limit will be exceeded, the energy 
storage would begin to curtail its regulation services to prepare (charge) in ad-
vance of the overload condition. When the overload condition begins, the battery 
would enter peak shaving mode, discharging the battery to keep the asset below its 
overload limit. Once the threat has passed, the battery would return to regulation 
service. 
Where the frequency and duration of asset upgrade deferral events are small, 
the system has the opportunity to collect considerable revenue from regulation in 
addition to the asset upgrade deferral benefit. However, it must be recognized that 
the asset upgrade deferral service must have extremely high reliability, lest the asset 
be allowed to fail and significant additional cost be incurred. Thus, highly accurate 
forecasts must be available and considerable margin for error (via oversizing sys-
tem energy and power) are recommended.

multiyear asset deferral scenarios if asset load growth is constant or accelerating.

6.3.3  Community Energy Storage
In community energy storage (CES), it is envisioned that a large number of battery 
systems sized from 10 to 100 kWh and 10 to 100 kW are installed on distribution 
feeders throughout a utility’s service area. The edge of the grid location, ability 
to aggregate many units to provide large capacity services, and ownership by the 
utility enable CES to provide many different services, including transmission and 
distribution upgrade deferral, regulation, reserves, voltage support, electric supply 
capacity, and more. Thus there are many opportunities to optimize the value of the 
system, but doing so is not straightforward. Many of the same challenges associated 
with combining different applications as noted previously must be addressed. Duty 
cycles and system requirements will vary based on the selected pairing of applica-
tions. Several developmental CES deployments have been initiated to investigate 
these matters.
In addition to the ability to serve so many applications, one potential advan-
tage of CES is the ability to leverage technical developments and cost reductions 
achieved by the automotive industry. The system size and technical requirements 
for CES batteries are often similar to those of BEV batteries. Thus, as the BEV 
market grows, so will interest in and deployment of CES.
One challenge with CES, however, is the need for extremely low-maintenance 
systems, due to the need to minimize cost and the large number of units that may be 
deployed in a geographically dispersed fashion. This concern often arises in discus-
sions of CES lifetime and thermal management. Long lifetimes are desired to mini-
mize hardware replacement costs—while active cooling systems could help extend 
life, they also come with their own maintenance requirements. Early studies of CES 
thermal management show that installations that behave like a greenhouse can 
lead to high battery temperatures that are detrimental to battery wear. However, 
they also suggest [20] that simple passive thermal management techniques such as 
shading the units from solar irradiation or vaulting the batteries below grade with 
a strong thermal connection to ground temperatures can be adequate when paired 
with intelligent restraints on electrical operation (Figure 6.10).
While early CES installations have anticipated the benefits of the vaulted con-
figurations, some actually behave more like a greenhouse, amplifying the effects of

solar radiation and insulating the battery from the soil. Further, vaulted installa-
tions must carefully manage water penetration, are less flexible to relocating the 
unit, and are of high cost.
6.3.4  Other Grid-Connected Applications
The use of energy storage on the grid is still evolving, as is the grid itself, with rapid 
growth in distributed, variable-generation, and smart-grid technologies. Certainly 
the technical requirements of grid-connected energy storage and the ways to iden-
tify the best-suited systems will also continue to evolve. For example, increased 
penetration of wind energy may incite the need for regulation-like services at wind 
farms. Similarly, increased popularity of behind-the-meter solar power could incite 
utilities to require behind-the-meter storage to smooth power and voltage fluctua-
tions. It will therefore be important for the battery system designer to stay abreast 
of changes in this exciting new market as the penetration of energy storage grows.

System Design
With the possible exception of flow batteries, the building block of electrochemical 
energy storage systems is the single cell. Energy storage systems may range from 
just a single cell to a few cells, such as in consumer electronic devices, to truly large-
scale systems, such as in grid and automotive applications that combine tens to 
thousands of electrochemical cells into a single system. Design of an energy storage 
system builds upon topics discussed in earlier chapters, including:
••
Determination of application requirements and possible duty cycles  
(Chapter 6);
••
Selection of appropriate electrochemical technologies (Chapter 1);
••
Selection and/or design of electrochemical cell (Chapter 2);
••
Thermal, life, and safety characterization (Chapters 3, 4, 5).
In this chapter, we assume that a suitable electrochemical cell has been selected from 
available technologies. Ideally, factors that were considered during cell selection 
included matching the power-to-energy ratio of the cell with the application, antici-
pated lifetime, cost and business relationship with the supplier, product uniformity, 
safety and compatibility of cell form factor, and packaging with the system. 
Scaling up from the cell to the system, design aspects discussed in this systems 
chapter include:
••
Sizing beginning of life (BOL) excess energy and power in order to meet en-
ergy and power requirements at end of life (EOL);
••
Establishing the number of cells and electrical topology;
••
Establishing the thermal management system topology, design, and control 
set points;
••
Mechanical packaging of cells and modules within the pack;
••
Design of electrical management systems, including cell balancing, relays, 
contactors, switches, and fuses;
••
Battery management system (BMS) controller tuning:
•	 Estimation of battery state of charge and state of power.
•	 Allowable power limits. For Li-ion, it is particularly important to es-
tablish acceptable charge rate at cold temperatures to avoid Li plating, 

166

System Design
as well as derating the power limits at high temperatures to avoid 
overheating.
•	 Cell balancing strategy.
••
Supervisory controller tuning (e.g., establishing how much of the battery’s 
BOL energy and power to use and still achieve acceptable lifetime, including 
under reasonable worst-case assumptions such as a hot environment with 
regular fast charging);
••
Validation of the technology versus the original business requirements;
••
Warranty and life-cycle management (anticipated years of life, infant mortal-
ity of cell technology, probability of premature failure, maintenance of inven-
tory for replacing failed units), decommissioning (reuse, recycling, disposal).
Similar to cell design, systems design involves evaluating trade-offs in cost, per-
formance, lifetime, and safety at each step of the process. Topics discussed in this 
chapter include electrical systems design, thermal and mechanical design, electron-
ics and electrical control systems, the design process, and design standards. The 
chapter concludes with two design case studies: one for an automotive application 
and one for a stationary, grid-tied application. The automotive case study develops 
a semiempirical life prediction model and uses the model to calculate trade-offs in 
life with performance and cost. The grid case study investigates the application of 
energy storage for so-called demand charge reduction for a commercial electricity 
customer with a large amount of on-site photovoltaic (PV) power generation. The 
customer’s goal is to reduce their monthly utility bills as much as possible.
7.1  Electrical Design
Analysis of the energy storage application, discussed in Chapter 6, provides antici-
pated power versus time duty cycles that the energy storage system must meet. For 
energy intense applications, the power level will be low but the time duration of 
discharge and charge will be long. For power-intense applications, the power level 
will be high, with the power levels and discharge/charge pulse time dictating energy 
requirements.
7.1.1  Power/Energy Ratio
As a rule of thumb, for 10 years of life, the system is sized with on the order of 
20% to 30% excess energy and 30% to 70% excess power relative to requirements 
derived from duty cycles. This provides an allowance for degradation throughout 
lifetime. Stationary storage applications have some flexibility to periodically add 
capacity throughout life to maintain performance as degradation occurs. Mobile 
applications do not. Excess energy and power also allow some margin for difficult 
operating conditions such as at cold temperatures.
These power and energy requirements—including excess—establish the power-
to-energy (P/E) ratio of both the application and cell. Regardless of how many cells 
are combined in series and how many cells are combined in parallel, the P/E ratio 
of both cell and pack stay the same. For a system designer, the search for cells with 

7.1  Electrical Design 
167
the desired P/E ratio begins. Other electrical attributes to document during the cell 
market survey include capacity (Ah), nominal, minimum and maximum cell volt-
age, expectations for life and thermal behavior/requirements.
7.1.2  Series/Parallel Topology
The pack nominal, minimum, and maximum voltages must be matched to the 
system(s) to which it is connected. AC transformers cannot directly be used to 
scale the DC power supplied by an electrochemical energy storage system. DC-DC 
converters can scale the pack’s voltage to a different system requirement; however, 
this is often more expensive than simply finding a different electrochemical cell that 
better meets requirements. The desired nominal voltage of the battery pack, Vpack, 
together with the nominal cell voltage Vcell, establishes the number of cells that must 
be combined in series, ns, according to the following relationship:
	
pack,nom
cell,nom
s
V
 V
x n
=
	
 (7.1)
Equation (7.1), written for nominal cell/pack voltages, can be similarly written for 
minimum and maximum cell/pack voltages. With the number of series cells now 
known, we can find the number of cells required in parallel, np, to meet the total 
energy requirement, Epack,total (Wh)

where Qcell (Ah) is the cell’s capacity.
Regarding series/parallel topologies, series/parallel combinations fall into two 
main categories at the extreme. Generally, parallel cells are connected together as 
supercells, with supercells then connected in series. This is the so-called P before S 
topology as shown in Figure 7.1(a). The opposite, S before P topology is shown in 
Figure 7.1(b).
The benefit of P before S is that a parallel group of cells provides some capabil-
ity for stronger cells to help weaker cells. A parallel group of cells can potentially 
partially operate with a single cell failed in open circuit but not with a shorted cell. 
A further benefit of the P before S topology is that balancing circuitry connections 
must only be made once per each parallel group rather than to every individual cell 
for S before P configurations. 
The benefit of S before P configurations arises when contactors or active 
switches are placed at the ends of the series strings, as in Figure 7.1(c). In this 
switched S before P topology, any one series string can be electrically removed from 
the system in case of a failure in that string.
The choice of S before P or vice versa is essentially a trade-off in complexity of 
electrical wiring to each cell (for cell voltage measurement and balancing) versus 
anticipated cell failure rates and need for fault tolerance (determined from system 
requirements and anticipated rates of cell premature failure). Beyond several hun-
dred cells, extreme large-scale systems usually have some combination of nested 
parallel/series/parallel connections (e.g., Figure 7.1(d)) with cost, complexity, fault 
tolerance, and safety dictating the configuration.

168 
�������������
System Design
The four topologies in Figure 7.1 have trade-offs in the number of connections 
required for cell voltage monitoring/balancing versus capability to operate with 
partial functionality in case of a cell failure. 
Regarding safety, a limiting factor for the maximum number of cells that can 
be combined in a parallel group is the fault tolerance to an internal short in a single 
cell. In a parallel connection, the healthy cells will discharge their energy through 
the internally shorted cell, exacerbating consequences of the failure. So long as one 
ensures that a single cell can absorb all energy from its neighbors in case of internal 
failure, it is appropriate to make a hard connection between parallel cells in a P 
before S topology. If there is concern about this failure mode, the parallel group of 
cells should be designed with fuses, thin fused busbar connections such as in Figure 
7.2(a), or separated into S before P subgroups.
Figure 7.1  Example of series/parallel topologies, each with identical energy and power capabilities.

7.1  Electrical Design 
169
The fail-safe topology shown in Figure 7.2(b) is a design both to detect cell internal 
shorts and mitigate their consequences on the system [2]. This design uses fused 
connections between parallel cells. In contrast to series connections in a pack, paral-
lel connections for balancing need not use highly conductive leads. The design also 
employs active elements, placing current sensors and contactors at the top of series 
strings. Current imbalance between series strings indicates an internal cell failure. 
Contactors can then be opened to isolate the failed string. Further details are given 
in [2].
7.1.3  Balance of Plant
A schematic of a Chevrolet Volt automotive battery pack is shown in Figure 7.3. 
This PHEV uses 288 cells, 15-Ah capacity, and a 3.75V nominal in a 3P-96S con-
figuration. This T-shaped pack combines several modules of different sizes to fit 
within available volume inside the vehicle’s crash protected zone. Discussion of 
balance of plant electrical systems that are common with other large battery packs 
is given below.
Module sizing. Modules are sized to have voltage <50V to minimize risk of 
electrical shock to humans during manufacturing, maintenance, refurbishment and 
disposal.
Manual service disconnect (MSD). This manual switch is located roughly at 
the middle of the pack. The intent of the MSD is to provide a simple, error-proof 
method to de-energize the pack’s main terminals before performing maintenance 
on the pack. With the MSD disconnected, the pack cannot be externally shorted 
across its main terminals, nor can the electrical connections arc even if contactors 
are closed.

and (b) fail-safe design with passive and active features. (Source: [2].)

�������������
System Design
Main pack fuse. The main fuse is often colocated with the MSD. The fuse 
may have slow-blow design characteristics to tolerate brief unintended pulses but 
to protect in case of a continuous high current draw in case of short or system 
malfunction.
Contactors. Two contactors (relays) are located near the pack terminals. Both 
the positive and negative leads are independently switched to provide fault toler-
ance. The contactors are actively switched on/off by the BMS, but can also be 
switched off if the BMS signal is wired in series with a passive safety interlock loop. 
This low-voltage loop ensures that operational/safety critical items (MSD, high-
voltage electrical leads to/from pack, etc.) are correctly engaged. Another feature 
of high-voltage contactors is precharge resistors that match voltages of both sides 
of the switch before closing. This prevents large inrush currents and possible arcing 
across the switch to avoid damage to the contactors, fuses, batteries, and applica-
tion. Only DC contactors may be used for battery packs as AC contactors rely on 
the changing current direction to break the switch open.
Ground fault detection. For fault tolerance, neither the positive nor negative 
terminal of the battery pack is connected to ground. Connection of either terminal 
with ground is an abnormal condition that exposes the system to risk of shorting 
should the other side also connect with ground. A ground fault detection system 
(not pictured in Figure 7.3) alternately connects a large resistor (possibly the pre-
charge resistor) from the positive terminal to ground, looks for leakage current 
across the resistor, opens that connection, connects the negative terminal to ground 
through a large resistor, and looks for leakage current across that resistor. If either 
leakage current exceeds a determined threshold, a ground fault is declared by the 
BMS. A ground fault indicates a breakdown in electrical isolation somewhere in 
the system, either in wiring or the cell walls and holders (as some cells have con-
tainers that are electrically connected to one of the two cell terminals).
Thermal system. Discussed in Section 7.2.
Battery management system. Discussed in Section 7.4.
Figure 7.3  Chevrolet Volt battery pack electrical configuration.

7.2  Thermal Design 
171
7.2  Thermal Design
The thermal management system must maintain the battery within the cell’s tem-
perature operating limits for performance, life, and safety. See Chapter 3 for discus-
sion of thermal management techniques and methods to measure and model heat 
generation rates. Chapter 5 provides important thermal considerations with respect 
to safety. When designing the thermal system, its effectiveness must be traded off 
with the extra cost, volume, and mass it adds to the energy storage system. It is rare 
that a thermal management system is sized to handle worst-case heat generation 
rates on a continuous basis. 
Figure 7.4 shows cell-level RMS and average current statistics—important for 
determining heat generation within cells—for a PHEV40 vehicle. The PHEV40 
simulations are for a 17.6-kWh, 292V nominal pack with 270 20-Ah cells in a 
3P-90S configuration. The figure aggregates simulation results for several hundred 
possible drive cycles in a cumulative distribution of the RMS and average currents. 
Given the sharp rise in currents in the right side of the plot, it is reasonable to de-
sign the thermal management system to handle the continuous heating of perhaps 
an 80th percentile drive cycle with 60A or 3C RMS current. For the other 20% 
of drive cycles that exceed the thermal management system’s continuous cooling 
capability, the system can rely on thermal mass to dampen cell heating during the 
transient, sometimes short-duration drive cycles. If the cell temperature rises too 
far, the BMS can derate the power limits communicated to the application super-
visory controller so it can limit charge/discharge rates with the impact of reducing 
heat generation within the cells.

hundred PHEV40 drive cycles. (Source: Neubauer et al. [3].)

System Design
When selecting the cooling/heating working fluid, air cooling is preferable to 
liquid cooling if its performance is acceptable. Air cooling is less expensive and 
simpler. Liquid cooling is more complex, more prone to leaks, yet cools cells at a 
higher rate and more uniformly due to large heat capacity of liquid relative to air. 
Another strategy to reduce temperature rise is to choose a cell with lower resistance 
or higher P/E ratio. This reduces the heat generation rate for a given duty cycle. 
Including a vapor-compression system to chill the air or liquid provides further 
benefits to lifetime, especially in hot ambient temperatures. An example of trade-
offs with lifetime for four candidate thermal strategies is shown in Figure 7.5. The 
longer battery life possible with a chilled liquid cooling system can either be used 
to extend the life of a given system with a fixed size or to reduce the system size 
required for a fixed lifetime requirement, say 10 years. For the PHEV, a chilled liq-
uid cooling system that costs less than $500 can pay for itself by reducing the size 
of the battery, assuming $300/kWh Li-ion battery cost and Phoenix, AZ ambient 
conditions. Or if the battery size is held fixed, the battery with the chilled liquid 
cooling can operate for 2 to 5 additional years compared an air cooled system that 
uses ambient air [5].
As an example of battery thermal management, Figure 7.6 shows a schematic 
of the Chevrolet Volt system. A thin plate with microchannels for liquid cooling is 
placed in between every other cell of the 288-cell battery pack. The liquid supplied 
to the cells is controlled in three modes: (1) heating mode, via an electrically pow-
ered resistive heater in-line with the liquid coolant for warm-up during winter, (2)

an ambient cooling mode where the battery liquid coolant is circulated through a 
radiator at the front of the vehicle when the battery is hot and the outside tempera-
tures are sufficiently cooler than the battery, and (3) a chilled cooling mode where 
the liquid is cooled in a chiller. The chiller is part of a HVAC vapor-compression 
system that also cools the passenger cabin through a separate evaporator. 
7.3  Mechanical Design
Mechanical enclosures for cells and packs are designed to meet requirements for 
safety, durability, cell lifetime, and thermal management. As a brief overview of 
such requirements, cell holders and module structures must:
••
Maintain compression on cells with prismatic form factor. For prismatic 
cells—both hard can or soft pouch packaging—a small amount of external 
pressure, 10 to 20 kPa, suppresses electrode creep and delamination and is 
generally beneficial for life. Cylindrical cells maintain pressure on the jelly 
roll without the need for external compression.

174 
�������������
System Design
••
Allow flow paths for thermal management in designs employing intracell 
cooling, or conduction paths for systems employing fin or cold-plate cooling.
••
Be mechanically rigid, holding cells in place for the lifetime of anticipated 
worst case vibration loads.
Pack enclosures must:
••
Be designed with outer casing capable of withstanding expected mechanical 
abuse (e.g., a person standing on the pack or a person or object falling onto 
the pack).
••
Be tolerant to dropping the pack from some height (e.g., a forklift) or, in the 
case of vehicles, be able to withstand crash events. The mechanical require-
ments of automotive packs varies greatly depending on whether the pack 
is inside the protected zone (e.g., passenger vehicles) or not (e.g., delivery 
trucks).
••
Be able to route cell vent gasses to a safe exit and contain possible cell failures.
7.4  Electronics and Controls
In some industries, the BMS is referred to as a battery electronic control module 
(BECM). At the highest level, the BMS receives commands from the application 
supervisor to power on/off and close/open contactors and reports back the battery’s 
operational state. The various additional functionalities of a BMS are discussed 
next.
7.4.1  Roles of Battery Management
Figure 7.7 summarizes roles of a BMS. Since the battery is a passive device that 
responds to whatever load the application attempts to source/sink, the application 
supervisor is responsible for active control of the load within operating limits re-
ported by the BMS. Estimation algorithms are needed to determine battery energy 
and power limits using measured current, voltage, and temperature signals.
In addition to estimating and reporting operating limits, the BMS controls the 
battery thermal management and cell balancing. The BMS must also detect faults 
and log abnormal events including cell/pack over/under voltage/current/tempera-
ture, ground fault/loss of electrical isolation, gas detection, sensor failures, com-
munication watchdog timer, and checksum errors.
7.4.2  BMS Hardware
Numerous topologies are possible for BMS and balancing systems. For detailed 
discussion, we refer the reader to [6]. Technical considerations for BMS hardware 
include input/output accuracy, voltage reference stability, operating temperature 
range, communications speed, tolerance to electro-magnetic interference, memory, 

7.4  Electronics and Controls 
175
and computation speed. For Li-ion systems, the BMS works hand-in-hand with the 
cell balancing system. If balancing is co-located within the BMS, it must be able to 
dissipate heat generated by balancing resistors and circuitry.
The BMS may be arranged in master/slave configurations to minimize number 
of and length of wires travelling between the BMS and cells. At one extreme is the 
master-only BMS configuration, using a fully centralized BMS that has sensor mea-
surement, cell balancing, and computation all taking place in one box for the entire 
pack. At the other extreme is a slave-only BMS configuration, using distributed 
cell-level processors, each accomplishing cell sensing, computation and balancing 
for its individual cell or group of parallel connected cells. Perhaps a true slave-only 
configuration is not strictly possible, as there must be some means for coordinating 
cell balancing as well as carrying out pack-level objectives such as closing contac-
tors, detecting faults and communicating with application supervisory controllers.
The particular master/slave hardware architecture is chosen to minimize cost, 
volume and mass, facilitate maintenance or module replacement, and to maximize 
performance and lifetime of the pack. Amongst available hardware options, archi-
tectures are chosen to avoid long distances of wires and number of wiring connec-
tions. As a rule of thumb from the automotive industry, each single wire connection 
in an automobile costs $1. Additionally, each send/receive node for CAN commu-
nications costs around $0.50.

System Design
7.4.3  Cell Balancing
NiMH, NiCd, and Pb acid chemistries all have internal overcharge protection 
mechanisms in the form of a redox shuttle. The redox shuttle is some molecule that 
can be reversibly oxidized at the positive electrode, diffuse through the electrolyte, 
and be reduced at the negative electrode, all at a potential slightly higher than the 
typical end-of-charge voltage. Chemistries with redox shuttles may be overcharged 
at a gentle rate with the result that a series string of cells with mismatched capacity 
or SOC all eventually reach 100% SOC. The unused charge generates heat inside 
the cell.
Even for Li-ion, which presently has no proven redox shuttle, extremely well 
matched cells may require no balancing and still achieve long life. This topology is 
sometimes used for satellite batteries where the risk of balancing system electronics 
failure is a concern and cells can be well matched prior to building the battery sys-
tem. Cells must be precisely matched for their capacities and self-discharge rates. 
The additional cell prescreening and aging tests are expensive, as is the increased 
scrap rate for cells that fail qualification. At the opposite end of the spectrum, low-
cost replaceable consumer electronics devices that only need a few years of life may 
not require cell balancing.
But in general, most Li-ion systems require balancing; passive balancing is the 
most common choice. If a cell reaches too high a SOC (or voltage, though SOC is 
preferred) relative to its neighbors, resistors in parallel with each cell are switched 
on to dissipate some energy. Passive balancing systems generally only balance dur-
ing charging because balancing during discharge is a waste of energy. Passive bal-
ancing is cheaper than active balancing; however, it has the disadvantage that it 
leaves unused energy stranded in healthy cells. With cells perfectly matched at full 
charge, during discharge weak cells having low capacity and/or high resistance will 
be the first to reach their minimum permissible voltage, causing end of discharge 
for the entire string of cells. Stronger cells that have not yet reached their minimum 
voltage will have stranded energy left in them. This unused energy obviously has 
larger consequences for energy—rather than power—applications. In contrast, ac-
tive balancing systems have some provision to shuttle energy from strong to weak 
cells during discharge and charge. For a system with mismatched cell capacities, all 
the energy of the system can be used minus some losses due to inefficiencies.
Li-ion cells can be well matched in the factory, perhaps with just 1% to 2% 
capacity mismatch when a pack is constructed. Even with this tight level of match-
ing, cell imbalance will grow throughout life. Figure 7.8 shows an extreme case of 
cell imbalance growth throughout life. In this simulation, cells are matched within 
±1.2% imbalance at BOL. Daily cycling for this high annual mileage case causes 
cells in the center of the large EV battery pack to heat up more significantly than 
cells close to the pack exterior. After 10 years, the strongest cell holds some 14% 
more capacity that the weakest cells. Temperature gradients across the pack are 
responsible for roughly half of the imbalance growth by year 10. Variation of aging 
processes within individual cells is responsible for the other half. At year 10, the 
system shown in Figure 7.8 will have 76% of BOL capacity if it uses active balanc-
ing or 65% of BOL capacity if it uses passive balancing, as it will be limited by the 
weakest cell. The simulated level of imbalance varies depending on use scenario. 
For example, packs smaller than this BEV75 or with stronger thermal management 

7.4  Electronics and Controls 
177
may have less temperature imbalance leading to less capacity imbalance over the 
lifetime.
Whether this stranded energy at year 10 is an issue depends on the application. 
In years 1 to 3, the stranded energy is much less. Active balancing therefore has 
questionable value for short lifetime consumer devices, but may be worthwhile for 
long term capital investments that need to last 5 to 20 years. Also, the magnitude 
of imbalance growth shown in Figure 7.8 strongly depends on the cell quality, 
BOL matching and thermal gradients across the pack. Hotter cells generally age 
the fastest, though it is also possible for coldest cells to age the fastest if the pack 
encounters frequent low temperature operation, especially charging. For more in-
formation on cell imbalance growth, see [7].
7.4.4  State Estimation Algorithms
Estimation algorithms are needed to deduce state of charge (SOC), state of power 
(SOP), and state of health (SOH) from current, voltage, and temperature measure-
ments [31]. The algorithms may be rule-based or model-based. For example, a rule-
based algorithm might estimate initial SOC using a lookup table of SOC = f(Voc) 
when the battery is at rest and terminal voltage equals open-circuit voltage, V = 
Voc. During charge and discharge however, the rule V = Voc does not hold, and the 
algorithm might switch to a coulomb counting calculation:

where Q is the capacity of the battery and SOC0 is the initial SOC estimate, and I(t) 
< 0 indicates battery discharge. The issue with coulomb counting, however, is that 
the SOC estimate will eventually diverge from the proper SOC due to inevitable 
current sensor measurement error. To correct for current sensor error, it is better 
to use current and voltage measurements simultaneously to constantly adjust the 
SOC estimate. This is the concept behind a state estimator or observer, one class 
of which is the Kalman filter. In general, model-based algorithms are preferred to 
rule-based, as they are formulated to provide a smoothly changing, best-possible 
estimate within anticipated sensor error bounds and are more accurate across a 
wide operating range.
To estimate SOC, SOP, and SOH in a model-based fashion, multiple algorithms 
are needed. A set of algorithms is suggested in Figure 7.9. 
1.	 A reference model is needed that predicts battery current/voltage dynamics 
and relates them to the internal states of the system. All other algorithms in 
Figure 7.9 make use of the battery reference model. The more accurate the 
model, the more accurate the state estimates.
2.	 The state estimator or observer uses the reference model in a predictor-cor-
rector fashion to converge on estimates of the model states, one of which is 
SOC. (Recursive regression algorithms are an alternative for calculation of 
model states.)
3.	 For limits calculation, the reference governor inverts the reference model 
to find allowable current or power levels that do not violate some battery 
constraint, usually minimum and maximum voltage limits. These current/
power limits are reported to the supervisory controller for controlling the 
load. (It is also possible to use model-predictive control algorithms to cal-
culate limits.) 
4.	 Health changes in the battery may be deduced through slow adaptive tun-
ing of parameters, namely resistances and capacity in the reference model. 
Not discussed here, online parameter identification algorithms include re-
cursive regression [8] and/or augmentation of state estimators to jointly 
estimate model states and parameters [9]. Parameter estimation should be 
carried out several orders of magnitude slower (~months) than state esti-
mation (~seconds) to avoid instability between the two estimates.

The above algorithms take both linear and nonlinear forms. This section illus-
trates basic concepts using linear models and estimators. The linear algorithms can 
then be easily extended to more accurate nonlinear ones.
7.4.5  Battery Reference Model
Battery reference models typically take the form of equivalent circuit models that 
mimic battery current/voltage dynamics, as shown in Figure 7.10. The drawback 
of the circuit model is that SOC is the only internal electrochemical state of the 
model. The resistive/capacitive states of the model provide no physical insight into 
battery internal processes, but are useful in predicting proximity of battery terminal 
voltage to voltage limits. Research is underway to develop electrochemical models 
fast and accurate enough for online application [10–13]. For most state estimation 
algorithms, the reference model should be in state variable form. A continuous time 
linear state variable model takes the form

Equation (7.4) is called the state equation and (7.5) is called the output equation. 
In these equations, x is a vector of model states, y is a vector of the model outputs, 
and u is a vector of model inputs. 
The model must be strictly proper in order to ensure stability of the algo-
rithms. This requires that current be the model input, u(t) = I(t), and voltage be 
the model output, y(t) = V(t). The opposite model would constitute an improper 
system in control theory. Figure 7.10 defines the model matrices A,B,C,D,y0 for a 
typical equivalent circuit model. Though not necessarily required, if possible it is 
convenient to arrange the A matrix such that it has diagonal structure. In this way, 
the model’s eigenvalues appear directly on the diagonal, [0, λ1, λ2] in Figure 7.10. 
This facilitates stability analysis and simplifies integration of the ordinary differ-
ential equations with time and/or conversion from continuous to discrete time. A

necessary requirement for the model to have observable states is that the A matrix 
can only contain one eigenvalue equal to zero. This free integrator term is associ-
ated with SOC. The coulomb counting equation (7.3) is a free integrator with an 
eigenvalue of zero. This sometimes requires clever manipulations so that all other 
states of the model have negative real eigenvalues such that their states converge to 
zero if the battery is left at rest. With battery dynamics controlled by diffusion and 
reaction processes, the eigenvalues of a battery model have no imaginary (oscilla-
tory) part. They are purely real and have quantities less than or equal to zero.
7.4.6  State Estimator
Shown in Figure 7.11, a state estimator operates using principles of feedback con-
trol. At each instant in time, a small correction is made to the model state equation. 
This correction is proportional to the error between the model predicted voltage 
and the actual measured voltage. The hat symbol (e.g., ˆx) indicates an estimated 
quantity. To analyze convergence criteria, we substitute the measured voltage minus 
the model voltage times the gain into the state equation

Collecting the terms for ˆx, we find the eigenvalues of the system with the estimator 
in the loop are the eigenvalues of the matrix A – LC. For the estimator to be stable 
and converge, these eigenvalues must all be less than zero. With the A matrix of 
the battery model formulated in diagonal form and the C matrix a row vector, it is 
straightforward to find a diagonal L matrix that satisfies this condition. If feedback 
control is to be applied based on the state estimates, it is good practice for control 
stability to separate the time scales of the estimation and control functions by an 
order of magnitude. It is general practice in controls to make estimator eigenval-
ues faster than controller eigenvalues; however, given the weak observability of 
battery internal states, it may be advisable to do the opposite: slowly adjust state

for estimator error.

have full rank. This condition is what imposes the requirement on the battery refer-
ence model that it is A matrix only have one eigenvalue equal to zero, as is the case 
in Figure 7.10.
On a digital controller, the state estimator is implemented in discrete time rath-
er than continuous time. The estimator operates based on sensor measurements 
and calculations made at the present time step, k, and updates the states that are 
carried forward for operations at the next time step, k + 1. First, the output equa-
tion is evaluated, then the state equation is updated

The discrete time model uses different matrices for its state and output equations 
than the continuous model. The matrices can be transformed from continuous to 
discrete time by zero-order hold, Tustin, or any number of other digital control 
methods. In the case where the A matrix of the continuous time model is in diagonal 
form, an exact solution to the continuous time ordinary differential equation may 
be used and the continuous to discrete transformation for time step or sampling 
time, Ts, is simply given by

real versus imaginary parts, or in other words, the absolute value of the complex 
eigenvalues must be less than 1.
In Figure 7.10, the battery model is presented as a simple linear model. In 
reality, the battery is a nonlinear system. It is quite common in control theory to 
use linear control techniques even for nonlinear systems, although stability is not 
always guaranteed and must be thoroughly tested. To capture nonlinearities of the 
system, the A,B,C,D,y0 matrices of the battery model can be scheduled as func-
tions of known nonlinearities of the system, generally temperature and SOC. In 
this form, the model is called a linear parameter varying (LPV) system. There are 
numerous references to LPV systems in the control literature [32]. For discrete time 
implementation, the continuous time LPV matrices may be transformed to discrete 
time at each time step using (7.10) to (7.13).
Control and estimation theory provides many extensions to the simple linear 
state estimation algorithms introduced here. These are summarized in Table 7.1. Of 
these, the unscented Kalman filter is perhaps the most popular for battery estima-
tion [9, 14]. It handles nonlinearities well, has fast computation time, and generally 
has smaller steady-state error compared to the extended Kalman filter.
7.4.7  Current/Power Limits Calculation
One of the functions of the BMS is to report the charge and discharge power avail-
able to/from the battery. Several versions of available power may be needed to sat-
isfy the supervisory controller depending on the time scale of the control. Available 
power may be specified as (1) an instantaneous limit, (2) a pulse limit available for 
Δt seconds into the future, and/or (3) a continuous limit. Regarding (3), if energy is 
the constraining factor, the continuous limit may be calculated based on the energy 
available divided by the desired charge or discharge time window. If high tempera-
ture is the constraining factor, the continuous power may be constrained by the

ability of the thermal system to accommodate the cells’ heat generation rate as a 
function of power.
Prediction of instantaneous and pulse power limits requires a model to estimate 
how much power is available into the future without hitting a cell internal or exter-
nal limit (e.g., maximum/minimum voltage limits). In the case of pulse power, this 
is for some predetermined time window extending into the future. In vehicles, for 
example, power limits may be for just 2-second duration to accommodate pulses 
of charge current received during regenerative braking or for 10-second duration to 
accommodate discharge power needed for acceleration of the vehicle.
We introduce a simple reference governor method to estimate limits using the 
state variable model of the battery and system states estimated by an onboard al-
gorithm, each discussed previously. The reference governor inverts the model at the 
present states to find the limiting current (model input) that hits the constraint limit 
Δt seconds into the future. This algorithm relies on (approximate) linear behavior 
of the battery over the short time period. Since current, rather than power, is the 
model input in Figure 7.10, we calculate limits in terms of current. Power limits 
may be approximated by multiplying charge/discharge current limits by the maxi-
mum/minimum cell terminal voltage. If these assumptions of linearity are too re-
strictive, model predictive controls (MPC) provide a means to calculate the limits.
The reference governor seeks to enforce a general constraint in the model out-
put, ymin < y(t) < ymax and calculate for the supervisory controller a limiting input, 
in this case u(t) = I(t), such that at some Δt seconds into the future y(Δt) = ylim. The 
constraint is usually minimuim and maximum cell terminal voltage. Inverting the 
model, we find the limiting current

Equations (7.14) and (7.15) assume the A matrix has diagonal form.
As a final consideration, either the BMS and/or the supervisory controller may 
need to derate these power limits to achieve acceptable lifetime. Often the battery 
cooling system is the limiting factor, not electrochemical limits, that one unable to 
continuously cool the cells to an acceptable temperature necessary for long life.
7.5  Design Process
The design process of complex systems must be carefully managed to coordinate the 
efforts of multiple teams and fields of expertise. The “V” design cycle [15], shown 
in Figure 7.12, provides a logical order for phases of the design process. Design 
phases proceed from left to right. Most complex items such as systems appear at the 
top. Less complex items, such as components, appear at the bottom. The process 
starts from the top left side of the “V.” The first phase is business analysis and re-
quirements definition for the system, followed by the trickle-down of requirements 
and design of subsystems and components. Once individual components (sensors, 

184 
�������������
System Design
electrical/thermal controls, packaging, etc.) are developed and ready, on the right 
side of the “V” they are integrated and tested as subsystems and finally complete 
systems.
Verification testing is performed to ensure each component and system meets 
its stated requirements. Validation testing is performed to assess the overall sys-
tem’s effectiveness in meeting its original goals. Battery lifetime testing is a particu-
larly time consuming endeavor, requiring anywhere from 6 to 24 months of testing 
before a new product can be fielded. For emerging technologies, it may be desirable 
to quickly field prototype units in limited quantities as part of a demonstration 
phase of the business plan. The performance and reliability of the demonstration 
units may be tracked for a year or more before making final decisions to deploy 
at scale. Given the low cost of data telemetry and storage, it is advisable to track 
energy storage system performance down to the individual cell level so that infant 
mortality rates or problems with individual cells may be assessed.
7.6  Design Standards
Mature industries using energy storage have established design standards. These 
include consumer electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. These design 
standards provide an evaluation method to assess the safety level of possible failures 
to hardware, software, or system. These standards generally define the technical 
state of the art. Failure of the system to meet the technical state of the art exposes 
the manufacturer to liability in the case of an accident.
An example standard in the automotive realm is ISO 26262, “Electrical Sys-
tem Functional Safety Standard for Road Vehicles” [16]. The standard addresses 
Figure 7.12  “V” design cycle. (Adapted from [15].)

possible hazards caused by the malfunctioning of electronic and electrical systems. 
Recognized throughout the automotive industry, ISO26262 defines the so-called 
“technical state of the art” for electrical systems such as throttle-by-wire and bat-
tery pack systems. The basic tenant of ISO 26262 hinges on assigning an automo-
tive safety integrity level (ASIL) for a given hazardous event. The ASIL can have a 
value of A, B, C, or D, with A as the least severe and D as the most severe in terms 
of hazard to the user and any other exposed individual.
The ASIL is a product of values assigned from within three categories: Severity, 
Exposure and Controllability: 
	
ASIL = Severity × Exposure × Controllability	
Possible values for each of the three categories are shown in Table 7.2.
The most severe hazard level, ASIL D, results from combination of worst clas-
sifications of each category: 
	
ASIL D = (S3) × (E4) × (C3)	
 If any one category is reduced, then the ASIL drops one level. For example, if 
(C3) is reduced to (C2), the hazard becomes ASIL C. At ASIL A there is no safety 
issue and only standard quality management processes are applied.
ISO26262 considers the entire product life cycle from development, to opera-
tion, to decommissioning EOL. Note that ISO 26262 does not apply to electri-
cal shock, flammability, shorting, or thermal abuse events. Relevant standards are 
discussed in Chapter 5. Multiple safety standards covering abuse, have adopted 
EUCAR hazard levels, summarized in [17].
7.7  Case Study 1: Automotive Battery Design
In this case study, we highlight some design trade-offs encountered by the auto-
motive system designer whose goal is to meet battery performance and lifetime 
requirements at minimum cost. In order to explore these trade-offs, we first develop 
a battery life predictive model and regress its parameters to cell-level experimen-
tal aging datasets. This life model captures the dominant aging characteristics of

Li-ion batteries. Temperature is the most important aging stress factor and, given its 
importance, this case study provides simple models to predict battery temperature 
for different ambient environments and thermal management strategies. Last, the 
lifetime of a PHEV40 battery is explored for several temperatures, excess energy 
sizes, and charge control strategies.
7.7.1  Life Predictive Model
Using methods introduced in Chapter 4, a semiempirical lifetime model is fit to ag-
ing data from the literature for the graphite/NCA Li-ion chemistry. For the NCA 
chemistry, main aging features observed in the data are
1.	 SEI growth proportional to square root of time, with rate accelerated by 
high temperature, T, and open-circuit voltage, Voc;
2.	 Loss of active sites with cycling, accelerated with high DOD;
3.	 Electrolyte oxidation at the positive electrode, accelerated by high T and 
Voc.
As an aside, we note that similar aging behavior can also be observed for the graph-
ite/NMC chemistry. For the graphite/FeP chemistry, electrolyte oxidation is negli-
gible due to the lower operating voltage of the FeP positive electrode.

In (7.16) and (7.18), the variable N denotes number of charge/discharge cycles. 
This definition is clear for simple constant current cycling; however, the model 
requires minor modifications to accommodate complex charge/discharge cycling 
profiles such as experienced in electric-drive vehicles. From the fatigue literature, 
the rainflow algorithm is used to break up a complex depth of discharge time his-
tory, DOD(tcyc) into an array of individual macro- and microcycles, ΔDODi. The 
algorithm also tracks whether each cycle was a full discharge and charge cycle or a 
single-ended charge or discharge, storing this information in an array Ni with each 
element having a value of either 1.0 for a full cycle or 0.5 for a half cycle. Miner’s

••
tcyc represents the short-time cycling history encountered by the cell at one 
state of life; 
••
tlife captures the long-time changes in battery resistance/capacity health with 
life.
In a modeling environment, tcyc is the time step of performance models (e.g., 
simply listed as “t” in Figure 7.10, usually with units of seconds, and representing 
a unit period of cycling or storage at one state of life of the battery). In contrast, 
tlife is time step of the life model, with units of days, months, or years, representing 
changes in states of life. 
Degradation rate constants ki = {a1,a2,b1,c2} depend on the aging condition. 
They can either be taken directly from data for one aging condition, interpolated 
between data sets for several aging conditions or, following our previous work [4], 
mapped as rate laws that are functions of known stressors to the battery. Neglect-
ing high C-rate and low temperature operation, we find degradation rates for the 
NCA chemistry are well described with functional dependence on T, Voc, and DOD

In (7.25) through (7.28), Ea, α, β, and ki,ref are fitting parameters, Rug is the uni-
versal gas constant; F is the Faraday constant, and Tref = 298.15K, Vref = 3.6V, and 
ΔDODref = 1 are arbitrary constants included for convenience of comparing ki,ref 
to standard aging conditions. Degradation rates are calculated for a representative 
duty cycle period, Δtcyc. Given the prominence of calendar aging of Li-ion chemis-
tries, it is important that the representative duty cycle include not only periods of 
cycling, but also rest periods such as overnight while an EV is parked. Degradation 
rates should be calculated for a repeatable unit of aging time. A good practice is to 
use one full day or one full week of data to represent Δtcyc.
7.7.2  Fitting Life Parameters to Cell Aging Data
Equations (7.21) to (7.28) constitute the life model. Modifications may be required 
to match aging behavior of other cells and/or chemistries. This model has 19 fitting

Here, we give brief examples of the model fitting process. The NCA aging data used 
here is not all for the same cell design; hence the aging model results presented later 
are meant to illustrate design trade-offs and not the behavior of a specific cell or 
vehicle battery design.
Figure 7.13(a) shows examples of equations, R = a0 + a1tlife1/2, separately fit to 
individual storage aging tests at 20°C, 40°C, 60°C, and 50%,100% SOC [18]. We 
refer to these individual fits as local models, as they each represent just one aging

condition. The coefficient a0 takes on slightly different values due to manufacturing 
variations across the six cells, with apparent ± 2% resistance differences at BOL. 
In contrast, the degradation rate a1 varies by more than an order of magnitude 
depending upon the temperature and SOC. Values of a1 for the six local models 
are plotted in Figure 7.13(b) versus the inverse of temperature. The storage terms 
of the rate law, (7.25), with ΔDODi = 0, can be fitted to match these six aging 
conditions, with best fits provided by Ea,a1 =70,700 J mol–1 K–1 and αα1=0.062. 
Not shown, the coupling of (7.25) with the cycling ΔDOD term is weak, suggest-
ing

=  is reasonable for (7.25). Instead, cycling dependent resistance growth is 
captured using the a2 term of the resistance growth model equation (7.21).
Figure 7.14(a) shows values of a2 resulting from local model fits with equations 
R = 1 + a1(T,Voc) tlife1/2 + a2tlife, for aging conditions at various DODs, EOCVs, 
and cycles per day [19]. In fitting the rate law equation (7.26), we estimate the time 
history of open-circuit voltage, Voc(t), based on SOC(t), as it varies greatly across 
these cycling conditions. In particular, the cells experiencing 1 cycle per day dwell 
at high SOCs (equivalently, high values of Voc) for long periods of time during their 
daily cycling. In contrast, the four cycles per day test cases do not dwell for long at 
high SOCs. The fitted rate-law for a2 is shown as the solid line in Figure 7.14(b),

Models for capacity fade may be regressed in a similar manner to that described 
for resistance growth. Figure 7.15 shows the results of a global model for capacity 
fade. The 1 cycle/day cases are controlled by calendar fade/Li loss equation (7.22), 
while most of the 4 cycle/day cases are controlled by cycling fade/site loss equation 
(7.23). Fitted values of rate law coefficients to reproduce this data set [19, 22] are

Lastly, reference degradation rates are matched to NCA Li-ion batteries de-
signed for automotive application and tested under automotive cycling conditions 
[11]. This includes HEV-specific cycling presented by Belt [23] and PHEV-specific 
cycling by Gaillac [24]. Reference values representing those data sets well are a0 =

= 1.794 × 10-4 day-1/2, and c1,ref = 1.074 × 10-4 day-1.
7.7.3  Prediction of Battery Temperature in Vehicle
Ambient conditions of a geographic region will strongly influence the average life-
time temperature of any battery that lives outside, such as a vehicle battery. Average 
lifetime temperature is perhaps the most important factor in determining battery 
life. The thermal network model shown in Figure 7.16 captures the impact of am-
bient temperature and solar radiation on the vehicle battery. Table 7.3 provides 
typical parameters for the model, representing a Toyota Prius passenger cabin and 
battery located in the car’s hatchback trunk. Solar radiation on a vehicle parked 
in full sun can increase the lifetime average battery temperature by 1°C to 3°C 
relative to a vehicle experiencing no solar radiation. This number varies with the 
solar intensity of the geographic location and battery thermal mass. Compared to

large BEV batteries, small HEV batteries will experience larger temperature swings 
during the daytime due to their smaller thermal mass.
By simulating the vehicle thermal network model using ambient temperature 
and solar radiation data for different geographic locations, one can predict battery 
temperature and lifetime due to passive heat transfer. Figure 7.17 shows capacity 
fade for PHEV batteries in two climates. For the hot, Phoenix, AZ environment, 
solar radiation can reduce battery lifetime by 20% if the car is continuously parked

in the sun. The figure also shows simplifying assumptions for approximating tem-
perature fluctuations of a given ambient environment. A good approximation of 
the passive thermal environment is to only consider four ambient temperatures 
throughout the year, each representing the average temperature of winter, spring, 
summer, or fall. In the automotive industry, it is common to conduct accelerated 
four-season aging tests in this manner, where the test article is subjected to cycling 
at four levels of ambient temperature.
Adding to the passive thermal environment model, the impact of different ac-
tive thermal management strategies was previously shown in Figure 7.5. These

simulations augment the passive model by adding the effects of battery heat genera-
tion due to cycling and cooling due to active thermal management. This is accom-
plished by introducing a term for heat generation minus cooling to the battery tem-
perature node, Tb, in Figure 7.16. The results given in Figure 7.5 are for Phoenix, 
AZ climate with the PHEV40 driven 12,000 miles/year. In this hot environment, a 
thermal management strategy that uses a refrigeration system to condition chilled 
liquid to cool the battery can extend battery life by 40% compared to using outside 
ambient air to cool the battery. Compared to oversizing the battery to achieve the 
same lifetime, this chilled-liquid thermal management can cost up to $500 more 
than the oversized air-cooled battery and still pay for itself, assuming $300/kWh 
battery cost.
7.7.4  Control Trade-Offs Versus Lifetime
In addition to determining thermal system strategy and requirements, additional 
questions for the systems designer include how much excess energy the battery 
must be sized with and how the battery should be best controlled within whatever 
degrees of freedom are acceptable to the end user. Typical expectations for automo-
tive battery lifetime are on the order of 10 years and 100k to 150k miles with 20% 
to 30% capacity loss.
Here, we present a simple example for a PHEV with 40 miles of all-electric 
range. If the vehicle consumes 285 Wh/mile on average, then 11.4 kWh of useable 
energy are required to propel the PHEV for 40 miles. Assumptions follow:
••
This simplified life analysis assumes all driving occurs in charge depletion 
mode, the worst case.
••
The typical U.S. driver travels approximately 12,500 miles per year. With 
this annual mileage, the battery would undergo, on average, 12.5k miles/
year divided by 365 days per year, divided by 40 miles/day, or 0.856 cycles 
per day.
••
Time spent at high SOC shortens battery life. For the SOC time profile, 
we assume the vehicle starts its day with the battery at full charge, SOC = 
SOCmax. One 20-mile trip is taken at 8 a.m., depleting the battery to SOC = 
SOCmax – ΔDOD/2. A second 20-mile trip is taken at 5 p.m., depleting the 
battery to SOC = SOCmax – ΔDOD. For the nominal case, the battery is re-
charged between 10 p.m. and midnight to SOC = SOCmax, where it remains 
until the next morning’s drive.
••
We set a minimum allowable SOC limit of 10% due to the inability of the 
battery to provide sufficient power required for acceleration below this level. 
EOL is reached either when remaining total capacity drops below 70% or 
the battery can no longer provide 70% of the PHEV40’s nameplate 11.4-
kWh useable energy without dropping below 10% SOC.
Figure 7.18 shows capacity degradation versus time for the PHEV40 operated 
to several different ΔDODs, under the assumptions of 30oC average lifetime tem-
perature, 95% SOCmax, and 12.5k miles/year. At 60% ΔDOD or 67% excess en-
ergy, the battery lasts 10 years. At 50% ΔDOD or 100% excess energy, the battery 

7.7  Case Study 1: Automotive Battery Design 
195
lasts 10.7 years, but costs 20% more due to the additional excess energy required 
by this more conservative design.
These results are highly specific to the use pattern. For NCA and other Li-ion 
chemistries, battery life is dependent on:
••
Temperature;
••
Maximum SOC (or equivalently EOCV);
••
Time spent at combined high SOC and high temperature;
••
DOD and number of cycles.
Figure 7.19 presents a sensitivity analysis of each of these factors on lifetime. 
The nominal case is 30°C, 95% SOCmax, 60% ΔDOD and charging time delay of 
4 hours. Perturbing the nominal 30°C temperature by +5°C and –5°C changes the 
nominal 10-year life by –2.2 years and +3.2 years, respectively. For the moderate 
to warm temperature cases investigated here for the PHEV40, life is controlled by 
calendar limitations—(7.22) rather than cycling limitations—(7.23). The calendar 
life model equation (7.22) has weak sensitivity to DOD, but strong sensitivity to 
all other factors included in Figure 7.19. Given that the cost, mass, and volume 
of the battery are all inversely proportional to the usable DOD, it makes sense 
to maximize usable DOD as much as possible. For the PHEV40, this implies a 
design should use as much of the battery as possible at BOL, and compensate for

this degradation by employing a combination of effective thermal management, 
reduction of maximum SOC, and delayed charging, all of which show substan-
tial lifetime benefits in figure 7.19. In particular, delayed charging (or limiting the 
charge rate) costs almost nothing to implement and is very effective in extending 
calendar life. Limiting maximum SOC also costs nothing to implement, however it 
limits the usable energy of the battery. An effective life control strategy will increase 
SOCmax during winter months to compensate for reduced range due to sluggish 
cold temperature performance. The strategy might also gradually increase SOCmax 
throughout lifetime to regain a portion of the lost usable capacity.
As a final note, the PHEV40 design explored here generally experiences no 
more than one deep discharge and charge cycle per day. This is because the average 
U.S. driver travels only 33 miles in a single day. Calendar life controls the overall 
system life. For HEV and PHEV10 designs, many more cycles per day may be en-
countered and usable DOD may need to be restricted compared to this example to 
ensure that cycle life does not limit the overall system life. 
7.8  Case Study 2: Behind-the-Meter Peak-Shaving of a Large Utility 
Customer
In this case study we investigate the application of energy storage for demand charge 
reduction (i.e., peak shaving) for a large electricity customer with a large amount of 
on-site PV power generation. The end user’s goal is to reduce their monthly utility

bills as much as possible in the presence of a budget constraint. Therefore, our ob-
jective is first to identify a set of system properties that best meets the customer’s 
goal, then to define a technical specification that will drive the detailed design and 
validation of the cell, modules, and overall system.
7.8.1  End User Needs and Constraints
The customer in this case is NREL, a research laboratory that studies and develops 
efficient, renewable energy technologies including wind and solar power as well 
as energy storage and a myriad of other topics. More than 2,000 staff work at its 
327-acre Golden, CO campus [25]. The large campus and nature of its work of-
fer many viable locations for installing an energy storage system; thus, physical 
size and interconnection requirements are not a primary concern. As a stationary 
system, mechanical robustness to shock and vibration are also of little concern. 
Safety will need to be addressed, as the system may be installed in close proximity 
to working employees. Thermal must also be addressed, as the system may be in-
stalled outdoors and Golden is subject to high levels of solar irradiance, which can 
result in high battery temperatures affecting safety and degradation. However, of 
primary concern are the system electrical requirements, which must be derived from 
a techno-economic analysis to meet the end user’s primary objective: cost savings.
7.8.2  End User Load Profile and Rate Structure
True to its name, NREL “walks the talk” with multiple LEED-rated buildings and 
4,400 kW of onsite PV generation [26]. The shape of the campus load profile is 
thusly dominated by the PV power profile. Figures 7.20 and 7.21 show the campus 
demand for 30 and 7 days, respectively. Here it can be seen that peaks in the de-
mand history are most often due to the intermittency of PV power. As these peaks 
are relatively short in duration, the load profile appears a good fit for the use of 
storage as a demand charge mitigation tool—large reductions in peak power can be 
had with a relatively small amount of energy storage.
We will assume the utility rate structure described in Table 7.4 applies, which 
offers opportunity for substantial savings from demand charge reduction (as dis-
cussed in Chapter 6). Note that this rate structure includes no time-of-day depen-
dence for demand charges or electricity costs. Rather, demand charges vary only 
by season, and electricity costs are constant year round at $0.0473/kWh. As such 
there is no added value in cycling the battery for energy shifting once monthly peak 
loads have been minimized, simplifying control. Further note that in comparison 
to more aggressive demand charge structures (see, for example, those of San Di-
ego Gas & Electric, or of Southern California Edison as referenced in Chapter 6), 
these demand charges offer much less opportunity for savings. Thus, we can expect 
similar combinations of storage and facilities to offer better economics in select 
markets.
7.8.2.1  Preliminary Techno-Economic Sizing Analysis
With the load profile and utility rate structure in hand, we can proceed with a 
coarse sizing analysis to estimate the battery power and energy level that is most

economically advantageous for this customer. For this we apply NREL’s Battery 
Lifetime Analysis and Simulation Tool for Behind-the-Meter Lite (BLAST-BTM 
Lite). This tool is designed specifically for such tasks: it applies a simplified model 
of energy storage (kWh accounting) in combination with an optimal peak shaving 
controller to a user-supplied load profile and utility rate structure, then computes 
the electrical response and cost savings of a specified energy storage unit. 
What BLAST-BTM Lite lacks in fidelity, it gains in computational efficiency, 
making it perfect for a preliminary investigation of a broad range of storage op-
tions as is needed here. With this tool we can quickly simulate 42 different energy 
storage units spanning seven different energy levels and six different power-to-
energy ratios. Note that in such full-factorial studies, it is often best to employ a 
power-to-energy ratio instead of specifying both battery power and energy levels 
directly. The latter approach may result in unrealistic systems when a broad scope 
of parameters is sought (e.g., systems requiring unrealistically high C-rates).
Annual savings for the simulated systems are shown in Figure 7.22. Clearly, 
higher energy and higher power systems lead to greater annual savings. However, 
increasing energy and power both require increased capital investment in the bat-
tery and inverter, respectively. Assuming that total system cost scales approximate-
ly with the energy and power levels of these two components at a rate of $500/kWh 
and $500/kW (additive), we can estimate a simple payback period (estimated total

system cost divided by the calculated annual savings) for each system as shown in 
Figure 7.23. 
While this approach includes many approximations, and certainly a more rigor-
ous consideration of savings and costs will be required, it provides a telling looking 
into the interplay of system power and energy for sizing such a system. Clearly, the 
best return on investment (minimum payback period) occurs when small amounts 
of energy are installed and the power-to-energy ratio is high. However, this also re-
sults in relatively small annual savings, which may not justify the project given the 
reality of certain flat or fixed costs that do not scale strongly with energy or power 
(e.g., system design and analysis or permitting). On the other hand, as energy levels 
are increased, return on investment falls even after optimizing the power-to-energy 
ratio (Figure 7.24).
A better approach where a budget constraint is in play may be to view annual 
savings against total system cost. Applied with a budget of $110,000, we find that 
a 72.5-kWh system with a 2:1 power to energy ratio appears near optimal for 
maximizing annual revenues at $16,000/yr and an annual return on investment of 
~14%.
7.8.2.2  Electrical Analysis
Before inspecting the electrical response of this battery in any meaningful way, it is 
important to make our simulation more realistic. In particular, we seek to improve 
the nature of our electrical model, thermal model, and control model as discussed 
below. To implement these changes, we switch our analysis tool from BLAST-BTM 
Lite to the full BLAST-BTM software.
Electrical model. We upgrade the kWh accounting model to a zero-order equiv-
alent circuit model. At the moment, higher-order dynamics are still not required, 
but we do wish to include the relation of OCV to SOC and add a resistive ele-
ment that is sensitive to both SOC and temperature. In this manner we can apply 
minimum cell voltage limits to observe the impact of thermal response on available 
energy and calculate the amount of heat generated by operating the battery.
Thermal model. We upgrade from complete omission of temperature effects 
to a lumped capacitance thermal model of the system consisting of battery, invert-
er, container, soil, and ambient nodes parameterized representative of a standard 
20' containerized storage unit. Heat dissipated by both the battery and inverter is 
assumed to be dumped to the container (which is thermally connected to ambi-
ent). Combined with the effects of solar irradiation, the container temperature can 
thereby greatly exceed ambient temperature—an important effect to account for. 
We specify a max battery temperature constraint of 50°C so that the battery will 
not respond to charge or discharge commands when it exceeds this level. Typical 
meteorological year data for Golden, CO is employed for ambient temperature and 
solar irradiance histories [28].
Control model. In the preceding analysis we have assumed the ability to per-
fectly forecast future load to the end of each month. It is unlikely this can be 
achieved in practice, and reducing the accuracy and/or time horizon of this forecast 
will significantly affect cycling behavior and resultant savings. To represent more 
realistic forecasts, we will assume a 48-hour forecast is computed once per day, 
and that the forecast for each 15-minute interval load has a random error in the

System Design
range of +/–65 kW (+/–2.5% of the average annual load). Our previous simulations 
also assumed that the anticipated battery response perfectly matched the actual 
response by utilizing identical models for control and simulation. Herein we will 
keep the simple kWh accounting method for computing peak shaving load targets, 
a lower fidelity model than the equivalent circuit model employed for simulation. 
In this manner, we begin to address the difference in anticipated and actual battery 
response. 
Auxilliary loads. An auxiliary load of 300W is assumed herein to represent 
control and management functions. We also include the ability to account for heat-
ing and cooling loads when present.
As our forecast error element is random in nature, we must run the simulation 
multiple times for the same system. Resultant value is found to fluctuate between 
$12,500 and $14,500 per year, averaging $13,600 per year. This represents a de-
crease of ~15% of the value predicted by our more simplistic simulations. Further 
inspection reveals that almost all of this deduction is due to the presence of forecast 
error.
As shown in Figure 7.25, the electrical duty cycle is affected as well. Under our 
perfect forecast assumption, the battery duty cycle is dominated by a small number 
of consistently deep discharges to our target EOD SOC (20%) over the course of 
the year. However, in our more realistic simulation, cycling frequency increases as 
does the variation in depth of discharge. Sometimes the algorithm will overpredict 
loads, sets an overly conservative load target, and thus result in a small peak load 
reduction and smaller battery DOD than targeted. At other times it underpredicts 
loads, sets an overly aggressive load target, then discharges the battery past the 
target SOC (defined as the minimum SOC that we would prefer that the battery 
reaches on any given day) in an attempt to achieve that load target. On occasion, 
this results in the battery discharging to 0% SOC and the metered load exceeding 
the load target. Figure 7.26 shows an example of this behavior, which can result in 
increased cost to the user if it sets the max load for the month.
7.8.2.3  Thermal Analysis
Over the course of a year, battery temperature is predicted to range from –18°C to 
+47°C, averaging to 11°C. Ambient, container, and battery temperatures are shown 
in Figures 7.27 and 7.28 for the maximum and minimum temperature days, respec-
tively. Several important factors are evident from these figures. First, we see that 
the container temperature can rise drastically above ambient due to its exposure to 
solar irradiance. Second, battery temperature is only minimally affected by the con-
tainer temperature fluctuation as the battery has significantly more thermal mass 
than the rest of the container, and the container has a strong thermal connection to 
ambient. Additionally, we see that both the battery and container temperature are 
strongly affected by heat generation of the battery and inverter when the system is 
charging or discharging (which drives the maximum battery temperature in Figure 
7.27). 
This predicted maximum temperature may be close to or above the operational 
range of some Li-ion cells, leaving little to no margin for cases where atypical 
hot spells occur where the campus loads induce more aggressive battery cycling 
or where heat generation is increased in later years from resistance growth of the

battery. Similarly, while we may have seen limited impact of minimal temperatures 
on performance herein, these same factors could amplify the impact of temperature 
under conditions we have not yet assessed. For these reasons, evaluation of various 
thermal management strategies should be considered.
Having noted that container temperatures are strongly correlated with solar ir-
radiance, we first investigate locating the system in a shaded area. We simulate this

by reducing the solar irradiance by 50% (allowing for diffuse solar radiation). Such 
an approach will incur little to no extra cost where shaded sites are available, such 
as a parking structure or under existing solar panels. We find, however, that while 
this approach has a strong effect on container temperatures, it has little impact on 
maximum or average battery temperature. As discussed previously, heat generation 
by the battery and inverter is the primary driver of maximum temperature.
Similarly, we can explore the addition of a cooling system to the container 
such as a conventional air conditioning unit. This approach may suffer similar is-
sues as the shading approach—without a stronger thermal connection between the 
container and battery (that may require a large increase in volume), cooling the 
container may not have a large effect on battery temperatures. To investigate, we

simulate a container air conditioning system with the ability to 10 kW of heat from 
the container and reject it to the environment with a coefficient of performance of 
2.5. Set to activate when container temperatures exceed 30°C, we find that average 
and maximum battery temperatures fall by approximately 2°C and 4°C, respective-
ly. Ultimately, battery temperature continues to closely track ambient temperature 
when in standby, and heat generation continues to drive peak temperatures when 
operational.
Alternatively, we can investigate use of a dedicated battery cooling system 
rather than a container cooling system. Such a system may employ liquid cooling 
paths direct to the cells and a refrigerant-based system for removing heat from said 
liquid, as is employed on advanced vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt [29, 30]. For 
our system we will assume only half of the total heat rejection capability as with 
the container air conditioning unit, but otherwise operationally similar—5 kW of 
heat rejection at a coefficient of performance of 2.5, active at and above 30°C. Re-
moving this heat directly from the battery results in a much larger 10°C reduction 
in maximum battery temperature to less than 37°C. An example high-temperature 
thermal response of this system is shown in Figure 7.29. Note that even when the 
system is actively charging and discharging—as evidenced by the spike in container 
temperature late in day 184 driven by inverter heat dissipation—the cooling system 
is capable of constraining the battery temperature to less than 33°C.
In addition to superior control of battery temperature, the direct battery cool-
ing system consumes half of the energy of the container cooling system. However, 
Figure 7.29  Thermal response of system: hot, direct battery cooling.

other components installed in the container may require temperature control as 
well (inverter, computerized controls, etc.), thus container temperatures cannot be 
wholly ignored. For this purpose, however, simply shading the container may be 
sufficient. Accordingly, we will elect to install the unit in a shaded location with a 
direct battery cooling system.
7.8.2.4  Degradation Analysis
Now we proceed to analyzing the long-term performance of the system. We will 
now extend the duration of our simulations to 10 years and activate the life model 
[4] included in BLAST-BTM. This model will calculate the change in battery resis-
tance and capacity at the end of each day, considering the current, voltage, SOC, 
and temperature history that has transpired. As the battery ages, this will result 
in less energy available for reducing peak loads, and thus utility bill savings may 
decline. Resistance increases will also amplify the heat generated by the system and 
possibly raise maximum temperatures. There are three key factors to adjust that can 
affect these behaviors (see Table 7.5).
7.8.3  Baseline
We begin with a baseline scenario where we employ a 100% maximum SOC, 20% 
target SOC, and cooling system active at and above 30°C. As seen in Figure 7.30, 
10 years of operation of such a system is calculated to result in ~17% resistance 
growth and ~22% capacity loss. Note that we also see the degradation rates are 
sensitive to ambient temperature, as they are higher in the summer than the winter. 
Annual savings (Figure 7.32) fluctuate but show no strong trend year to year. 
Recall that we expect savings to decline. The lack of a clear downward trend im-
plies that the effect of our applied random forecast error overwhelms the economic 
effects of aging in this scenario.
Temperature data in Figure 7.31 reveals that average temperatures are constant 
year to year. This is due to the fact that average temperatures are a strong function 
of ambient conditions rather than operational ones. Maximum temperatures, on 
the other hand, are strongly coupled to how the battery is operated, coinciding 
with the occurrence of high-rate, large DOD discharges late in the afternoon of a 
hot summer day. While we do see some trend of increasing temperature year after 
Table 7.5  Key Factors to Adjust Degradation
Control Parameters
Maximum SOC
Reducing the maximum SOC can reduce battery degradation, but also re-
duces the amount of energy available for peak shaving.
Target SOC
Raising the target SOC will reduce the annual battery throughput, maximum 
DOD, and the amount of energy available for peak shaving, and increase the 
margin for poor load forecasting.
Thermal Parameters
Cooling thermostat
Lowering the temperature at which the cooling system is active will decrease 
battery temperature, and thereby battery degradation, but will increase aux-
iliary loads.

year due to the increase in battery resistance, the random forecast error affects this 
parameter as well.
7.8.4  Increased Cooling
In this case we reduce the temperature at which the cooling system becomes active 
from 30°C to 20°C. We see that while peak temperatures are reduced slightly later 
in life (Figure 7.33), effects on both capacity fade and resistance growth are neg-
ligible. This analysis suggests that, for our assumed chemistry, increasing battery 
cooling beyond that necessary to constrain peak temperatures to operationally ac-
ceptable limits may not significantly benefit longevity. While energy costs associated 
with powering the more aggressive cooling system are increased, ultimately changes 
in average savings are within the noise of our random forecast error effect. 
7.8.5  Reduced Target SOC
Here we reduce the target SOC of the peak shaving algorithm from 20% to 10%. 
This effectively increases the energy available for peak shaving, which could result

in increased savings. It also, however, decreases the margin for error associated with 
poor load forecasting and may affect the duty cycle in such a way as to increase 
max temperatures and degradation. Results of this simulation again show negligible 
impact on thermal response and wear. Further, annual savings (Figure 7.34) suggest 
that the decrease in target SOC has only a minor effect on total value, again on the 
scale of variation induced by our random forecast error.
7.8.6  Decreased Maximum SOC
Finally, we reduce the maximum SOC used for charging the battery from 100% to 
90%. This directly decreases the energy available for peak shaving, which could re-
sult in decreased savings but will also decrease degradation rates. As seen in Figure 
7.35, this strategy delivers as expected in terms of battery degradation: resistance 
change is decreased from +17% to +12%, and capacity change is decreased from 
–22% to –17%. This is due to the fact that the battery spends a large amount of 
time in the fully charged state awaiting an infrequent discharge order. Reducing the 
maximum SOC directly affects the wear induced during these times. However, there 
does appear to be a decrease in annual savings as well (Figure 7.36).

sent the resistance growth due to calendar and cycling effects, respectively. Q1 and Q2 represent the capacity 
fade due to calendar and cycling effects, respectively.

7.9  System Specification
The preceding system-level, long-duration analyses has begun to quantify the trades 
possible with a large energy storage system for behind-the-meter demand charge 
management. We have identified energy and power levels that offer the best annual 
savings within our allotted budget. We have also identified that an active direct-
to-battery cooling system will be required to constrain maximum temperatures to 
acceptable levels. With respect to degradation, we have found that calendar fade at 
high SOC is the predominant factor in battery wear, as the battery spends a large 
amount of time resting in a fully charged state. While we have seen that reducing 
the maximum allowed SOC can offer gains in this area, more aggressive use of the 
cooling system does not. 
Unfortunately, we have also seen that uncertainty in campus load forecasting 
affects the economics of the system more strongly than many of these factors. Run-
ning a large number of simulations at each condition and analyzing the results sta-
tistically is strongly recommended to address such factors. Barring such additional 
analysis, this factor encourages being conservative in setting our target SOC.
The identified system architecture is readily summarized in Table 7.6. It is im-
portant to note that we specify the 72.5 kWh as available energy because several 
simulations predict that all of this energy will be utilized. It is also important that 
we reference SOC to this available energy figure as well, as this aligns with our 
control assumptions and methods.

To continue with more detailed development activities, such as the design of 
cells, modules, thermal management systems, and so forth, we must now define 
more concise worst-case scenarios and duty cycles. 
Inspection of simulation results can reveal such worst-case power requirements 
and thermal environments. For example, container temperature simulations reveal 
that container temperatures can span –20°C to +50°C. Electrical duty cycles vary 
substantially but show occasional occurrence of max power and full discharge op-
eration. Given these results, Table 7.7 defines a reasonable protocol to use for 
simulation and testing in developing hardware.

Conclusion
Batteries have come a long way from the hobbyist voltaic pile to energy storage for 
entire communities.  So have the processing and analysis tools used in the industry. 
Computational power available to design engineers has increased by several orders 
of magnitude, enabling the virtual design of entire battery packs.  The theoretical 
bases for computational battery design are now sufficiently mature; the software 
tools have evolved from academic software to standard practice in the industry. 
Battery makers today have access to virtual design of cells of different formats 
based on newer and emerging chemistries.  Optimization, which has traditionally 
been carried out by extensive design of experiments, is now performed by a series of 
computational case studies.  Battery assembly traditionally performed in chemical 
plants has now been automated over clean rooms and robotic assembly lines.  The 
technoeconomic evaluations have in turn adopted such sophisticated models and 
tools to provide users the ability to base their investment decisions on the actual 
physics of the batteries.  Most importantly, the battery community has grown from 
the traditional group of materials chemists and solid-state physicists to encompass 
a variety of disciplines from environmental enthusiasts to industrial engineers.  This 
has resulted in a paradigm shift in battery design, from the traditional wisdom in 
building batteries for consumer electronics applications, to assembling large battery 
packs. As outlined in Chapters 4 through 7, the contributions from the different 
groups enable the expedition of the technological maturity and deployment of bat-
teries applications that demand several MWh of energy storage.
For instance, simple thermal management solutions utilized in single-cell appli-
cations such as cell phones are no longer effective in a battery pack several kWh in 
size. In fact, to date, there is very little guidance on thermal management for these 
large batteries.  The calorimetric studies outlined in this book were built over the 
years evaluating different pack designs and have been shown to be effective indica-
tors of battery performance under different load conditions.  What remains to be 
implemented is the design of cells and packs that maximize utilization for specific 
applications, accounting for efficient heat distribution.  For instance, affordable 
tuning of coolant flow rates in accordance with the response of the battery to am-
bient temperatures, and adaptive heat dissipation devices are currently being intro-
duced in the market.  Such implementations can build on the thermal evaluation of 
batteries outlined in Chapter 3.
As demonstrated Chapter 5, the linear extension of circuit-breakers and fuses 
used to protect small cells is not always a reliable means to ensure sequestration of

Conclusion
a large-format cell in a vehicle battery pack.  Even when identical cells are used, the 
implications on battery safety are widely different depending on the application at 
hand.  The question of how well safety at the single-cell level translates to safety 
of the battery pack is raised more often in applications involving high-energy and 
power demands.  The safe operating window for large format-cells is set based on 
different sets of metrics adopted by different organizations.  The need for a sound 
understanding of these limits and a uniform set of test conditions that meet safety 
assessment under a variety of scenarios is yet to be developed.  In part, this gap 
arises from the rapidly evolving nature of the technology.  As addressed earlier, the 
understanding of the underlying factors by the diverse crew involved in battery 
manufacturing and utility will significantly help address this challenge.
On-board electronics available for battery management in the market today 
areÑ sufficiently robust that we believe the tools outlined in the book will help 
control engineers and thermal management designs to take advantage of the in-
sight the offline analyses provide, in order to design more reliable fuel gauges and 
battery life estimators for battery packs.  Smart grid design based on physical state 
estimators is not far-fetched from the algorithms outlined in Chapter 4.  Not only 
will such tools enable more efficient utilization of existing battery packs, they can 
promote the planning and distribution of load requirements across the day of the 
week or time of the day based on these routines. Field data on such topics is still 
sparse given the relatively recent usage of large-format Li-ion batteries in these ap-
plications.  However, as the vehicle and grid-scale applications mature, readers will 
build more confidence in the utility of detailed analyses similar to the case studies 
outlined in Chapter 7.
In fact, among the first of assignments every prudent reader of this book should 
undertake would be to employ the tools outlined in this book for a design problem 
relevant to their immediate line of work.  This effort will provide sufficient con-
fidence in the methods and help to appreciate the multifaceted nature of battery 
technology.
