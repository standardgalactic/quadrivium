ing. You know who you are. No matter what, you continue to do that voodoo
that you do . . . so well. . . .
Author’s Acknowledgments
A book is as much about environment, accidents, incidents, and circum-
stances as it is about research. This group of people fits the bill for creating
all of the above, and I’d like to offer my sincere gratitude, because it is the
sum of their interactions with me that often leads to interesting ideas and
observations that make their way onto the written page.
I’d like to thank the subscribers and sources of Joe-Duarte.com for their
continued interest and support.
My wife, Lourdes, my son, Metheny, my mother and father, Raquel and Jose,
and Angela, the book maven, are always there, no matter how grumpy I get
near manuscript deadlines. Thanks to them.
Sal, Lib, and the office gangs, this one was harder on all of us than I would
have expected. Thanks as usual.
Frank Kollar is as good a partner as anyone could have. Thanks, and enjoy
that kafi.
Greg Morris, thank you for lunch, and all kinds of intangibles.
John Duke, for all the e-mails . . . and stuff.
Marty, thanks for the annual pilgrimage to Starplex, where the soul gets
renewed.
And especially Grace, without whom there would be no book gigs. Keep them
coming. 
And thank you for your ongoing support to: 
Jim, Mary, John, and Liz at Financial Sense News Hour. 
Tom Bemis at MarketWatch.com. 

Gail Essary at Financial Wire.
Charly Butcher and the gang at WOWO.
Jill Woerner at CNBC. 
A very special thanks to the new gang at Wiley — Stacy, Tim, Neil, and com-
pany. It’s good to be back in the saddle. 
Very special thanks to Thom Calandra, whose early support allowed my writ-
ings to go farther and wider than I could have ever imagined. Stay well, and
no worries. 
Coffee and tea . . . fuel for life . . . and writing books.

Introduction
R
isk and uncertainty go hand in hand with opportunities to make money.
Goods, services, and basic materials probably will undergo major price
swings, up and down, at one time or another during the next 20 years. The
volatility of the markets is only going to increase. And the chances for sus-
tainable trends that last for decades, the way the stock market rallied in the
1980s and 1990s, are less likely than they were a few years ago.
If global warming doesn’t get you, then politicians, militants, or dictators are
almost certain to try. That’s why learning how to trade futures and options is
important for investors who not only want to diversify their own portfolios
but also want to find ways to protect and grow their money when times are
hard in traditional investment venues such as the stock market.
The world has changed since the events of September 11, 2001. And the
December 2004 tsunami and the New Orleans disaster with Hurricane Katrina
are more proof of what’s in store.
Whereas in the past, investors could afford the luxury of buying and holding
stocks or mutual funds for the long term, the post September 11, 2001, world
calls for a more active and even a speculative investor. The new world calls
for a trader. And futures and options markets, although high risk, offer some
of the best opportunities to make money trading in volatile times.
So you need to get ready to work as a stock trader, a geopolitical analyst, a
money manager, and an expert in the oil markets. I have to keep up with news
about the economy, disruptions in the supply of oil, the weekly trends of oil
supply, weather patterns, and the stock market, both in a macro and micro
universe. As a futures and options trader, you have to do the same with your
contract of choice, and you have to pay attention to time factors, especially
expiration dates and how much time you have left to decide whether you
have to exercise your option.
Remember that successful traders
 Have a plan, follow it, and adjust it to changing conditions.
 Look at trading as a business.
 Are disciplined in their personal and professional lives.
 Understand the risks and the game they’re playing.

 Know and accept that they will make mistakes.
 Never forget their mistakes and learn from them.
 Never enter into a trade without knowing their exit strategy — how
they’ll get out of the market.
 Never risk money that they aren’t willing to or can’t afford to lose.
 Never allow a bad trade to lead to a margin call.
Trading futures and options isn’t gambling; it’s speculating. It’s also gathering
information and making judgment calls about situations that are unfolding,
and it’s a process of self-protection and an ongoing education.
You may think of yourself as a dummy. But after you read this book, you’ll
know how trading futures and options is done and how to stay in the game as
long as you want, not necessarily by hitting home runs but rather by showing
up to work everyday, getting your uniform dirty, and playing good, consis-
tent, fundamental baseball.
About This Book
Futures markets are resurging and are likely to be hot for several decades,
given the political landscape. Changing world demographics and the emer-
gence of China and India as economic powers and consumers, coupled with
changing politics in the Middle East, are likely to fuel the continued promi-
nence of these markets.
I take you inside these markets and give you tools that you can use for
 Analyzing, trading, or just gaining a better understanding of how
money works and affects your daily life.
 Starting fresh in your views of how the markets work. A traditional
buy and hold mind-set is a recipe for trouble in futures and options trad-
ing, while profit taking or hedging a position before the weekend is
normal operating procedure.
 Discovering that time is on your side in the stock and bond markets,
but it’s your enemy in futures and options. You’ve got to be on top of
how much time you have left before your trading position expires worth-
less or when you have a load of something delivered with a bill for a
large sum of money.
 Reading a sentence just the way it’s written. No tricks, hidden clues,
political agendas, or attempts to make you look foolish. If you don’t get
it, I didn’t do a good job of writing it.
 Remembering that measuring the return of your money is more
important than measuring the return on your money.

Futures & Options For Dummies 

Conventions Used in This Book
To help you make the best use of this book, I use the following conventions:
 Italics are used for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms.
 Boldfaced text is used to indicate key words in bulleted lists or the
action parts of numbered steps.
 Monofont is used for Web addresses.
What I Assume about You
I had to start somewhere, so I assumed some things that may or may not
apply to you. I’m not trying to offend you or to be condescending. So here’s
what I’ve assumed about you:
 You’re curious about the futures and options markets, but you don’t
know enough to trade them and want to find out how to do it without
losing your shirt.
 You’ve been a stock trader, but you’d like to know more about using
charts, indicators, and trading psychology.
 You want to find out how to decrease the risk within your portfolio.
 You want to become a more active trader and make money more consis-
tently by letting your profits run and cutting your losses short.
 You want to know how to make sense of the big picture in the markets
and to try your hand at trading currencies, bonds, and commodities.
 You like the idea of trading on margin, and you’re not afraid of leveraging
additional money.
 You aren’t afraid of being wrong five or six times in a row when trading,
but you’re willing to try again until you succeed.
 You want to investigate more about how politics, wars, weather, and
external events can be used as opportunities to trade.
If these assumptions describe you, you’ve picked up the right book.
Nevertheless, I also assume that you have some tools and resources at your
disposal. Here’s what you need to get started in futures and options trading:
 Plenty of money and a cast-iron stomach to boot. You need to have at
least twice the amount that your broker/advisor lists as a minimum for
opening an account. And you have to be ready to lose it all, fast.
 Your head screwed on straight before you start. Futures and options
trading is really dangerous and can wither away your trading capital fast.

Introduction

 A quiet place to prepare, set up your trading station, and make sure
you know your market stuff really well. Exchange hours, what brokers
do and don’t do, what trading terms like bid and offer mean, and how to
read a brokerage statement are only some of what you need to know.
 A fast computer with a fast Internet connection.
 Access to good charts. You can gain access to charts either through the
Web or a good trading software program and the ability to test your
strategies before you commit to them.
 Subscriptions to newsletters, books, magazines, and software. Be
ready to spend some money for these important information resources.
You can also take courses, and you need to get used to paper trading
(practicing without money) before jumping into the deep end.
How This Book Is Organized
I’ve organized Futures & Options For Dummies into six parts. Parts I and II
introduce you to the futures markets and market analysis — technical and
fundamental. Parts III through V take you into the nuts and bolts, the
exchanges, the contracts, trading strategies, and indicators. Part VI is the
now famous For Dummies Part of Tens, in which you can discover a little
about a lot of different futures and options information.
Part I: Understanding 
the Financial Markets
Sure, this sounds like a lot to swallow, but if you don’t understand how the
pieces fit together, you won’t get the finer points that can make you a better
trader.
This part shows you three things:
 Where money comes from and why markets move the way they do
 What the function and role of futures and options markets are
 How the financial markets work together

Futures & Options For Dummies 

Part II: Analyzing the Markets
This part is where you get your basic training. It’s all about fundamental and
technical analyses, and it gives you details about supply and demand, how to
use economic reports, and how to take advantage of seasonal and chart pat-
terns and market sentiment.
Part III: Financial Futures
Most stock investors think the stock market is the center of the universe.
After you read this part, you’ll see things differently, because I look at the role
of the bond market, and how it’s really the tail that wags the dog.
Part IV: Commodity Futures
Yeah baby! We finally get to pork bellies, soybeans, and wheat. But more
important, this part is about trading oil, natural gas, steel, copper, gold, you
name it — all of which are affected by strange things like weather, pollution,
and electricity, thrown in for good measure.
Part V: The Trading Plan
This part is a big case of the nuts and bolts of trading. Relax, it isn’t catching,
but it is likely to get you a bit more organized. Who can’t use a little disci-
pline, eh?
This part details how you can set up, organize, execute, and operate a trading
business, starting with the trading calendar and working your way all the way
to deciding what your best markets and surefire strategies are and how to
mix and match approaches while trading and hedging.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Here I give you lists of rules and resources that can help you make money
and keep you from losing big chunks of it whenever the markets turn on you.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies books use little pictures, called icons, to flag certain chunks of
text and information that are of particular interest. Here’s what they actually
mean to you, the reader:
Yup, this one is important. Don’t forget the stuff marked with 
this icon.
The bull’s-eye gives you info that you can put to use right away, such as when
to trade or how to engage a specific strategy.
I like this one best, because it reminds me of Inspector Clouseau of The Pink
Panther fame. The “bemb,” as Clouseau would say, is a sign that you need to
read the information highlighted by it carefully. If you ignore this icon, you
can end up in a world of hurt.
Although you can skip this important, but not necessarily essential, informa-
tion without repercussion, you may not be able to impress your friends at the
water cooler as much as you otherwise would.
Where to Go from Here
For Dummies books are set up so you can start reading anywhere. Don’t feel
as though you have to read everything from beginning to end. If you’re a true
beginner, I recommend that you read Parts I and II carefully before you start
skipping around. Here’s to profitable futures and options trading.

Futures & Options For Dummies 

Part I
Understanding the
Financial Markets

In this part . . . 
You’ll get a handle on where money comes from and
the important details about how the futures and
options markets work in this part of Futures & Options For
Dummies. I start you out with the key relationship between
central banks and the bond markets and take you on a tour
of the futures markets, while offering a little history lesson
along the way. That leads you into an overview of today’s
markets — how they work with and depend on one another.
And before moving on, I tell you about option strategies that
are designed to help you get the most out of your trading.

Chapter 1
The Ins and Outs of Trading
Futures and Options
In This Chapter
 Trading futures and options versus traditional investing
 Finding out who’s successful at trading futures and options
 Gathering your trading tools and know-how
 Checking out market analysis, short trades, and money management
 Discovering how fun trading can be
I
f you’re one of those people who look at their mutual fund portfolios once
a year and wonder how the results came about, futures trading isn’t for
you — at least until you make some changes in how you view the financial
markets, your knowledge base, and in general, how the world works.
No, you don’t have to live in a monastery and wear a virtual-reality helmet
that plugs into the Internet, has satellite TV, and features real-time quotes
and charts. You are, however, going to have to take the time to review your
current investing philosophy and find out how futures trading can fit into
your day-to-day scheme of things without ruining your family life and your
nest egg.
Trading is not investing; it’s speculating. Speculating is defined as assuming a
business risk with the hope of profiting from market fluctuations. Successful
speculating requires analyzing situations, predicting outcomes, and putting
your money on the side of the trade on which way you think the market is
going to go, up or down. Speculating also involves an appreciation of the fact
that you can be wrong 70 percent of the time and still be a successful futures
trader if you apply the correct techniques for analyzing trades, managing
your money, and protecting your account.

Basically that means you have to chuck all your preconceptions about buy-
and-hold investing, asset allocation, and essentially all the strategies that
stock brokerages put out for public consumption.
And just so you don’t call your brother-in-law the broker and get the publisher
and me in trouble, what I mean is that buy-and-hold doesn’t work in the
futures markets. They’re designed for trading.
Futures trading is risky business and requires active participation. It can be
plied successfully only if you’re serious about it and committed to it.
That means you must be able to develop your trading craft by constantly
reviewing and modifying your plan and strategies.
To be a successful futures and options trader, you’re going to have to become
connected with the world through the Internet, television, and other news
sources so you can be up-to-date and intimately knowledgeable with regard
to world events. And I don’t mean just picking up on what you get from occa-
sionally watching the evening or headline news shows.
You’re also going to have to spend some time and money setting up for this
endeavor. You’ll need a computer, trading program, and brokerage account of
some sort, not to mention how much money you need or how well capital-
ized you have to be to be able to survive.
In essence, you must either make some changes, or your foray into trading
futures and options will be nothing more than a quick endeavor.
Who Trades Futures and Options?
Aside from professional speculators and hedgers, whose numbers are many,
the ranks of futures traders essentially are made up of people like you and me
who are interested in making money in the markets — the wide variety of
people who trade futures and options contracts at the retail level.
In his book Starting Out in Futures Trading (McGraw-Hill), author Mark Powers
cites a study by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) that described the
profile of a futures trader in the 1970s as a male between 35 and 55 years of
age with middle- to upper-class income. The study indicated that
 Fifty-four percent were professionals, including doctors, lawyers, den-
tists, and white-collar workers, especially upper-management types.
 Sixty-eight percent were college graduates.
 Their overall tendency was toward short-term trading.
10
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

By 1999, Futures Industry magazine surveyed futures brokers regarding online
futures trading. A summary of the results identified
 Some general tendencies but couldn’t settle on a description for a typi-
cal online futures trader.
 Account sizes ranging from $14,000 to $30,000 at brokerages aimed at
retail investors, with average transaction sizes within that group ranging
from 1.6 to 5 contracts.
 Account sizes ranging from $40,000 to millions of dollars at brokerages
with mostly institutional clienteles, with average transaction sizes within
that group ranging from 17 contracts to even larger transactions.
The bottom line seems to be that to be able to trade futures and options, you
need to have a certain amount of education and the necessary technological
and financial means to get started.
Who Is a Successful Futures Trader?
Everyone knows that it helps to know a few things about the financial mar-
kets and that you need the ability to at least consider online trading and, of
course, some finances to trade futures contracts.
But how do you become good at it? How do you manage to survive, even
when you’re not particularly good at it?
The answer is simple. You must have enough money and be able to develop a
trading plan that enables you to keep making trades in the markets long
enough to make enough money so you capitalize on your next big trade.
Simply put: If you don’t have enough money, you won’t last. And if you don’t
have a good trading plan, your money quickly disappears.
Indeed, your success depends more than anything else on how you prepare
yourself financially, intellectually, technologically, and personally through the
development of a detailed and easy-to-implement trading plan.
What You Need to Trade
You need money, knowledge, patience, and technology to be able to trade
futures and options contracts.
11
Chapter 1: The Ins and Outs of Trading Futures and Options

In terms of money, many experienced traders say that you need $100,000 to get
started, but the figures from the previous section show that retail investors
rarely have that much money in their accounts — at least as of 1999.
The truth is that there are many talented traders who have made fortunes
after starting out with significantly less than $100,000. However, it would be
irresponsible for me to lead you astray and give you the false impression, as
some would, that the odds are very much in your favor if you start trading at
a very low equity level.
The reality is that different people fare differently depending on their trading
ability, at any level of experience. A trader with a million dollars in equity can
lose large amounts just as easily as you and I with $10,000 worth of equity in
our account.
My only point here is to make sure that you understand the risk involved and
that you go into trading with realistic expectations.
If you don’t have that much money and are not sure how to proceed, you
need to either reconsider trading altogether, develop a stout trading plan and
the discipline required to heed its tenets, or consider managed futures con-
tracts. I discuss these topics in detail in Chapter 17. Would-be traders who
have less than $30,000 should also consider the managed futures opportuni-
ties like the ones I tell you about in Chapter 17.
When it comes to technology, you need an efficient computer system that has
enough memory to enable you to look at large numbers of data and run
either multiple, fully loaded browsers or several monitors at the same time.
You also need a high-speed Internet connection. If you get serious about trad-
ing, you also need to consider having two modes of high-speed Internet
access. For a home office, a full-time trader often has high-speed Internet
through the cable television service and through DSL (digital subscriber
line), with one or the other serving as a backup.
Trading Modalities
Trading futures and options contracts is truly a hybrid that lies somewhere
between the types of trading that are separately based on technical analysis
and fundamental analysis.
The fundamental side of trading (see Chapter 6 for all the details) involves
your getting to know the following:
12
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

 The industry in which you’re making trades
 Contract specifications
 Seasonal tendencies of the markets
 Important reports on which you need to keep an eye
The technical side of trading (at least that part that I concentrate on) focuses
on what the market is doing in response to fundamentals. When you use tech-
nical analysis, you’ll be looking at jargony-sounding things, such as trading
volume, price charts, and open interest, and how they respond to factors like
the global economy, interest rates, and politics — just a few influences on
prices. To do that you need to have access to and be able to read charts and
to know how to use indicators, such as trend lines, moving averages, and
oscillators. (I show you how in Chapters 7, 8, and 20.) Without these instru-
ments and indicators, your trading is likely to suffer significantly, because
they help you to keep track of prices and guide you in choosing when and
how best to place your trades — getting in and out of the markets.
To be sure, there are other approaches to technical analysis ranging from those
listed in this book to rather esoteric techniques that are not mentioned, such
as using astrology, or rather precise but not so commonly seen chart patterns.
My goal here is to give you methods and examples that you can begin to see
and use immediately. See Chapter 7 for more on technical analysis.
It’s always better to make money than to be right. The key is not what you
think should happen, but rather what the market does in response to events
and fundamental information and how you manage your trade. Success
comes from letting winning positions go as long as possible and cutting
losses short before they wipe you out.
Getting Used to Going Short
The concept of going short usually troubles stock investors. Going short
means that you’re trying to make money when prices fall. It involves borrow-
ing a marketable asset from someone so you can sell it at a high price, wait
for prices to fall, buy it back at the lower price, return the asset to the lender,
and pocket the difference between what you sold it for and what you had to
pay for it.
Although this may sound confusing, trading software simplifies the concept
by giving you a button choice for short selling. Chapters 7 and 8 offer nice
examples, including illustrations of what short selling is and when it’s the
correct strategy to follow.
13
Chapter 1: The Ins and Outs of Trading Futures and Options

In futures trading, every transaction involves a trader who’s trading short
and one who’s trading long.
You can also bet on the market falling by using options called put options.
These instruments let you decide whether you want to sell something at a
predetermined price before a certain future date when the put option con-
tract expires. For more about puts and their counterparts known as calls,
turn to Chapters 4 and 5.
If this confuses you, you definitely need to read this book carefully before
you consider trading futures contracts, or aggressively trading stocks, for
that matter.
Managing Your Money
To be a successful trader, you must have a successful money management
system that includes a minimum of these three components:
 Having enough money to start: You need enough money to get a good
start and to keep trading. Undercapitalization is the major reason for
failure. See “What You Need to Trade,” earlier in this chapter.
 Setting appropriate limits: You need to set attainable limits on how
much you’ll risk, how you’ll diversify your account, how much you’re
willing to lose, and when and how you take profits. Knowing your limits
and sticking to them with regard to all these factors is important to suc-
cessful trading. You’ll get there by doing things like developing and regu-
larly reviewing your trading plan, and using techniques such as placing
stop-loss orders under your trades, to limit losses if you’re wrong. See
Chapters 17, 18, 19, and 20 for trading strategies.
 Avoiding margin calls: Margin calls will come if your account’s equity
falls below critical levels. Margin levels are different for each contract
that you trade. A margin call is what happens when you hold a position
that is falling in value beyond a limit set by the exchange. For example, 
if you were trading widgets with a margin set at $1,000, and your widget
contracts fell below $1,000, your broker would call you and ask you for
more money. If you can’t put more money in the account, either by
wiring it or by selling what’s left of your widgets, the broker sells the
widgets to raise the money, and your account is inactive until you raise
the amount of money needed to meet future margins. Margin calls are
explained in detail in Chapter 12.
14
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Analyzing the Markets
One of the most important steps you can take toward being a good trader is
developing a knack for analyzing the markets. That means you need to under-
stand the technical and fundamental aspects of the market with respect to
the underlying asset that you’re trading.
The two basic ways for choosing what you’ll trade are
 Monitoring different markets to see which ones are moving or are
likely to move. Assuming that you have an understanding of the envi-
ronment and the variables that move the markets, you can then trade
them. The advantage to knowing these factors is that you’re likely to
have more activity in your account. The disadvantage is that when
you’re just getting started, you certainly won’t be an expert in too many
markets. Chapters 6 through 8 focus on technical and fundamental
analyses of the economy, the futures markets, and basic speculating
strategies.
 Becoming an expert (on the technical and fundamental aspects) in at
least one or two markets, and then trading them exclusively. The
advantage is that you get a good feeling for the subtleties of these mar-
kets and that your chances of success are likely to increase. The disad-
vantage is that you may have a good deal of dead time or dull stretches
if the markets you choose don’t move much. Chapters 10 through 16
cover the major mainstream futures markets in detail, including trading
strategies.
Enjoying Your Trading Habit
I trade regularly, based on my time commitments to other activities and
based on market conditions.
What I’ve discovered through years of trading, though, is that few times have
I not enjoyed the process of analysis and decision-making that is involved in
trading.
To me, trading is just about as good as it gets. Maybe it’s something that’s
programmed into my DNA, personality, or mojo that just keeps me coming
back.
15
Chapter 1: The Ins and Outs of Trading Futures and Options

As you progress through this and other books about trading futures and
options, you’ll discover whether your connection to the force (your karma) 
is good for trading.
Just remember that when you’re ready to trade, you’re going to be excited.
That’s okay, because the thrill of the hunt is one of the reasons everyone
trades. However, you need to temper that excitement and hone it to your
advantage. If you can manage the exhilaration of trading and turn it into an
awareness of what is happening, you’re likely to be more successful.
Welcome to one of the final frontiers left on the planet Earth.
If you start trading and you’re not enjoying it, you need to revise your trading
plan or find another way to put your investment capital to work.

Chapter 2
Where Money Comes From
In This Chapter
 Understanding where and how money does its work
 Investigating the inner workings of central banks
 Relating to money’s effect on the global financial system and futures and options 
markets
M
oney doesn’t grow on trees. But the truth isn’t far from that. In fact,
money is manufactured inside the world’s central banks, especially the
United States Federal Reserve System, essentially from thin air.
Okay, so there is some method to the madness. But the global monetary
system mostly seems like madness that is far from leading to any certain 
outcomes, which, of course, is what makes trading a potentially profitable
occupation — as long as you know what to look for.
If you know how the system works and how to use it, you can turn it to your
advantage. In this chapter, I tell you how the Federal Reserve System in the
U.S. (the Fed — the central bank of the United States) and other central banks
around the world have branch offices throughout their respective countries,
where economists directly monitor economic activity by going out into the
community and talking to businesses, by designing and refining models, and
by compiling reports based on all the data collected.
I also let you in on what happens when the Fed and its branch chiefs meet a
few times every year to look at all this economic information so they can
make informed decisions about how much money to pump into the system
and how easy (or hard) they’re going to make it to borrow that money.
You can’t get into the inner workings of the Fed without knowing about the
interactions between money supply, interest rates, and inflation, so I also
include these topics and tie them together with the Federal Reserve, central
banks, and money and the markets in general.
When I talk about the Federal Reserve, unless I say otherwise, I also refer to
other central banks, because they all work in similar fashion. When there are
important differences in the way they go about their business, I also let you
know.

How Money Works: The Fiat System
The global monetary system is what’s called a Fiat system in which money is
a storage medium for purchasing power and a substitute for barter. Each
dollar bill, euro, yen, gold ingot, or whatever currency you choose enables
you to buy things as the need or want arises, thus making the barter system
(trading one service or product for another) mostly obsolete.
Money then enables enterprises to development and societies to establish sub-
specializations, thus fostering a sort of dynamic progression toward the future.
For example, before there was money, anyone who owned land produced
their own necessities and traded the surplus with other people for the things
they needed.
Money changed that system by its inherent ability to store purchasing power,
thus giving people the opportunity to make plans for the future and to spe-
cialize. In other words, if you’re a good wheat farmer, then you can specialize
in wheat, and buy your equipment, hire workers, and look for neighbors’ land
to buy to expand your wheat farm.
Markets and central banks then value the relative worth of the paper (cur-
rency) based on the perception of how a particular country is governing
itself, the current state of its economy, and the effects the interplay of those
two factors have on interest rates.
Money’s money because we say it’s money
Most of the world’s money is called fiat money, meaning it is accepted as
money because a government says that it’s legal tender, and the public has
enough confidence and faith in the money’s ability to serve as a storage
medium for purchasing power. A fiat system is based on a government’s man-
date that the paper currency it prints is legal tender for making financial
transactions. Legal tender means that the money is backed by the full faith
and credit of the government that issues it. In other words, the government
promises to be good for it. I know how it sounds. But that’s what the world’s
financial system is based on.
Fiat money is the opposite of commodity money, which is money that’s based
on a valuable commodity, a method of valuation that was used in the past. At
times, the commodity itself actually was used as money. For instance, the use
of gold, grain, and even furs and other animal products as commodity money
preceded the current fiat system.

Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Where money comes from
Central banks create money either by printing it or by buying bonds in the
treasury market. When central banks buy bonds, they usually buy their own
country’s treasury bonds, and their purchases are made from banks that own
bonds. The money from the central banks goes to the bank vaults, and
becomes loan-making capital.
When the Fed wants to increase the money supply in the U.S., it buys bonds
from banks in the open market and uses a pretty simple formula to calculate
how much money it actually is creating.
Instead of using gold as the basis for the monetary system — as was the
custom until 1971, the Fed requires its member banks to keep certain specific
amounts of money on reserve as a means of keeping a lid on the uncontrolled
expansion of fiat money — in other words, to keep the money supply from
exploding. These reserve requirements are the major safeguard of the
system.
When the economy slows down, the Fed attempts to jump-start it by lowering
interest rates. The Fed lowers interest rates by injecting money into the
system. The monetary injection is sort of like a flu shot for an ailing economy.
But instead of a vaccine, the Fed injects money into the system by buying
bonds from the banks.
To keep the system from becoming inflationary, the Fed keeps a lid on how
much banks can actually lend by using a bank reserve management system.
The reserve management system, to be sure, is not an exact science, but over
the long haul, it tends to work as long as the public buys the validity of the
system, which in the United States, it does.
Here’s how the reserve requirements work:
 If the current formula calls for a 10 percent reserve ratio, it means that
for every dollar that a bank keeps in reserve, it can lend ten dollars to its
clients.
 At the same time, if the Fed buys $500 million in bonds in the open
market, it creates $5 billion in new money that makes its way to the
public via bank loans.
 The reverse, or opposite, is true when the Fed wants to tighten credit
and slow down the economy. It sells bonds to banks, thus draining
money from the system, again based on the reserve formula.
19
Chapter 2: Where Money Comes From

Fiat money is created (and gotten rid of) out of thin air, but the process isn’t
by hocus-pocus from some wizard’s wand. Its power comes from its use as
accurate storage for purchasing power that is based on
 The public’s acceptance of the legal-tender mandate. See the earlier sec-
tion on “Money’s money because we say it’s money.”
 The market’s expectations that a government’s promise to make its cur-
rency legal tender, by law, will hold.
Understanding Central Banks (Including
the Federal Reserve)
Central banks are designed to make sure that their respective domestic
economies run as smoothly as possible. In most countries, central banks are
expected at the very least to combat inflationary pressures.
The overarching goal of the central banks is to repeal (or keep in check) the
boom and bust cycles in the global economy. So far this goal is only an inten-
tion, because boom and bust cycles remain in place and are now referred to
as the business cycle.
One good impact has come from the actions of the Fed and other central
banks. They’ve been able to lengthen the amount of time between boom and
bust cycles to the extent that they’ve smoothed out volatile trends and cre-
ated an environment in which the futures markets offer a perfect vehicle for
hedging and speculation.
Prior to the advent of central banks, booms and busts in the global economy
came about as often as every harvest season. Because money was hard to
come by prior to the centralization of the global economies, a bad harvest, a
spell of bad weather, or just a bad set of investment decisions by a local bank
in a farming community could devastate the economy in an area or even a
country.
The central bank of the United States
(and the world): The Federal Reserve
The Fed is the prototype central bank, because of its relative success, not
because it was the first central bank. Created in 1913 to stabilize the activities
of the money and credit markets, it administers the Federal Reserve Act,
which mandated the creation of an agency intent on “improving the supervi-
sion” of banking and “creating an elastic currency.”
20
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

The current objectives of the Fed are to fight inflation and maintain full employ-
ment to keep the consumption-based U.S. and global economies moving.
Under Chairman Alan Greenspan (whose appointment as a member of the
Fed Board of Governors expired on January 31, 2006), the Federal Reserve
became the most important financial institution in the world. In reality, the
Fed is the central bank to the world, especially having grown in prestige and
deeds during Greenspan’s more than 18 years as chairman.
The fact that Greenspan’s term expired and he can’t be reappointed may offer
up a considerable amount of volatility in the markets and give futures traders
a nice chance to make some money.
How central banks function
The Fed has two official mandates: keeping inflation under control and main-
taining full employment. However, it has some leeway and in many ways has
outgrown its mandates, becoming lenders of last resort and sources of
money in times of crises. In many speeches, especially after September 11,
2001, Greenspan and other Fed governors made it clear that their perception
of the Fed’s duties included maintaining the stability of the financial system
and containing systemic risk.
Some central banks, such as the European Central Bank (ECB), use inflation-
ary targets to gauge their successes. Unlike the Fed (which didn’t set such tar-
gets under Chairman Alan Greenspan, but may do so in the future), the ECB
must keep raising interest rates until the target is achieved, even if unemploy-
ment is high in Europe and inflation is above the central bank’s target.
The positive side of inflation targeting is that it gives the market a sense of
direction with regard to what the central bank’s actions may be toward inter-
est rates. The negative side, as is evident in Europe, is that the use of inflation
targets often prevents the ECB from moving on interest rates. As a result, the
European economy has lagged in its ability to grow. In other words, the dogma
of adhering to the target set by the central bank has hurt the European econ-
omy. In contrast, despite frequent criticism, the U.S. economy, albeit in fits and
starts, has continued to be the leading economy in the world. Much of that is
because of the relatively good management of interest rates by the Fed.
The ECB’s mandate opens up opportunities for trading currency, interest
rates, and commodity futures, because after a central bank starts down a cer-
tain policy route, it usually stays with it for months, creating an intermediate-
term trend on which to base the direction of trading.
For example, after September 11, 2001, the Fed lowered interest rates an amaz-
ing 14 times, which also shows that the Fed generally tends to raise or lower
rates in a series of moves (except for the period between 1995 and 1998).
21
Chapter 2: Where Money Comes From

The Fed reversed its course and began raising interest rates in June 2003. As of
November 2005, the Fed had raised interest rates 12 times, with the rate rising
four-fold from 1 percent to 4 percent as measured by the Fed’s official short-
term rate, the Fed funds rate, which governs overnight loans between banks.
Understanding Money Supply
Money supply is how much money is available in the economy to buy goods,
services, and securities. The money supply is as important as the supply of
goods in determining the direction of the futures and options markets.
The four money supply figures to watch are
 M0: The M0 is the money supply figure that’s mentioned least often, but it’s
as important as any other, because it’s all the cash and coins in circulation.
 M1: The M1 money supply is M0 plus the amount of money housed in all
checking and savings accounts.
 M2: The M2 money supply is M1 plus money housed in other types of
savings accounts, such as money market funds and certificates of
deposit (CDs) of less than $100,000.
 M3: The M3 money supply is M2 plus all other CDs, deposits held in
euros, and all repurchase agreements (Repos), in which one party sells
securities to another party and agrees to buy them back at a later date.
A Repo is essentially a secured loan.
Money supply and inflation: 
The inevitable equation
I don’t like equations, and you don’t either, but this one is important. It’s
called the monetary exchange equation, and it explains the relationship
between money supply and inflation as:
Velocity × Money Supply = Gross Domestic Product (GDP) × GDP Deflator
Velocity is a measure of how fast money is changing hands, because it records
how many times per year the money actually is exchanged. GDP is the sum of
all the goods and services produced by the economy. The GDP deflator is a
measure of inflation, or a sustained rise in prices. Inflation is usually defined
as a monetary phenomenon in which prices rise because too much money is
in circulation, and that money’s chasing too few goods.
22
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Here’s what’s important about the money supply as it applies to futures and
options trading:
 Money supply is related to inflation because of the number of times it
actually changes hands (see the definition of velocity in the previous
paragraph).
 More money in the system — chasing goods and services at a faster 
rate — is inflationary.
 A rising money supply tends to spur the economy and eventually fuels
demand for commodities.
 A rising money supply usually is spawned by lower interest rates.
 Whenever the money supply rises to a key level, which differs in every
cycle, eventually inflationary pressures begin to appear, and the Fed
starts reducing the money supply.
 Deflation is when money supply shrinks because nobody wants to buy
anything. Deflation usually results from oversupply, or a glut of goods in
the marketplace. The key psychology of deflation is that in contrast to
inflation, consumers put off buying things, hoping that prices will fall 
further — as opposed to times of inflation when consumers are willing
to pay high prices in fear that they will rise further.
 Reflation is when central banks start pumping money into the economic
system, hoping that lower borrowing costs will spur demand for goods
and services, create jobs, and create a stronger economy.
 The more money that’s available, the more likely that some of it will
make its way into the futures and options markets.
As a general rule, futures prices respond to inflation. Some tend to rise, such
as gold, and others tend to fall, such as the U.S. dollar (see Chapters 11 and 14).
Each individual area of the futures market, though, at any time, is more respon-
sive to its own fundamentals and its own supply-and-demand equation. Other-
wise, here is a quick-and-dirty guide to general money supply/commodity 
tendencies:
 Metals, agricultural products, oil, and livestock contracts generally tend
to rise along with money supply. This tendency is not a daily occurrence
but rather one that you can see over an extended period of time if you
compare graphs and charts of economic indicators with futures prices.
The overall trend is toward higher consumer prices, which have resulted
from higher commodity prices.
 Bonds and other interest-rate products do the opposite. Generally, bond
prices fall, and interest rates or bond yields rise in response to inflation
(see Chapter 10).
23
Chapter 2: Where Money Comes From

 Stock index futures are more variable in their relationship with the money
supply, but eventually, they tend to rise when interest rates — either from
the Fed or market rates in the bond and money markets — are falling, and
they tend to fall when interest rates reach a high enough level. In other
words, the relationship of money supply to the stock market and stock
index futures is indirect and has more to do with how effective the Fed
and the bond market are bringing about the desired effect on the econ-
omy, whether slowing it down or speeding it up. However, during some
periods, such as 1994 and most of 2005 when the Fed raised interest rates,
stocks and stock index futures stayed in a trading range.
 Currencies tend to fall in value during times of inflation.
In a global economy, many of these dynamics occur simultaneously or in close
proximity to each other, which is why an understanding of the global economy
is more important when trading futures than when trading individual stocks.
Something from something 
is something more
The wildest thing about money is how one dollar counts as two dollars when-
ever it goes around the loop enough times in an interesting little concept
known as the multiplier effect.
For example, if the Fed buys $1 worth of bonds from Bank X, then Bank X
lends it to Person 1. Person 1 then buys something from Person 2, who then
deposits the dollar in Bank 2. Bank 2 then lends the money to Person 3, who
then deposits it in Bank 1, where the $1, in terms of money supply, is now $2,
because it’s been counted twice.
By multiplying this little exercise by billions of transactions, you can arrive at
the massive money supply numbers in the United States, where as of late
2004, the M0 alone was $688 billion.
As of March 21, 2005, M1 was $1.38 trillion, M2 was $6.41 trillion, and M3 was
$9.5 trillion.
Getting a handle on money supply 
from a trader’s point of view
Although you and I can use money supply data in many ways from an acade-
mic point of view, believe me, it won’t make you the life of the dinner party.
The key to making money by using money supply information is to have a
good grip on whether the Fed actually is putting money into the system or
24
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

taking it out. What’s even more important is how fast the Fed is doing what-
ever it’s doing at the time.
Still another equation
I have a quick-and-dirty formula that I use to figure out how fast the money
supply is growing or shrinking. Every week I check Barron’s Web site
(www.barrons.com) for a Money Supply table that can be found under
“Economic Indicators” in the Market Laboratory. Figure 2-1 is a reproduction
of one of the tables.
Because I’m not an economist, I ignore the seasonal adjustments and go
straight to the raw data in the table, calculating a ratio of the growth rate.
Although it isn’t scientific, it works.
For example, I plug the M2 numbers for the same time frame this year and
last into this simple equation:
[(This year’s M2 ÷ Last year’s M2) – 1] × 100 = percentage growth
With the numbers from Figure 2-1 plugged in, the equation looks like this:
[(6,471.4 ÷ 6,176.8) – 1] × 100 = 4.7 percent
The 4.7 percent growth rate is what I care about, because that’s how fast the
M2 money supply grew during the past year and that means that on a yearly
basis, as of the date in the figure, 4.7 percent more money was in circulation
than the year before.
Sifting through the data
I have about ten years worth of money-supply data, so I can look through my
spreadsheets and get an idea of how the money supply has fluctuated over
various longer-term time frames.
For example, I checked the growth rate for October 11, 2004, and found that it
was 4.8 percent. In December 2004, it was 5.4 percent, and on October 10,
2003, the growth rate was 6.3 percent.
Although the Fed was raising interest rates during this period, the money
supply was still showing an upward rate of growth, despite the fact that it
was at a lower rate of growth in November 2004 than in October 2003, 5.4 per-
cent versus 6.3 percent. The message to take away is that the Fed still had a
long way to go in its quest to decrease the growth rate of the money supply.
My analysis proved correct, because by November 2005, the Fed was still
raising interest rates and telling the market in its statement after the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) met on November 1 that “monetary policy
accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is
providing ongoing support to economic activity.”
25
Chapter 2: Where Money Comes From

From a trading standpoint, the only thing that can be surmised is that the Fed
was being careful in its handling of the economy. And if the Fed is being care-
ful, you and I need to be careful in our trading.
What the market is saying
Look at other markets and indicators during the time frame of your analysis
to make use of the information when setting up your trading. I like to use the
CRB Index as an overall gauge of inflation, knowing that it is limited by its
heavier weight toward grains, not metals. The combination of rising commod-
ity prices and year-over-year growth in money supply is a recipe for higher
interest rates because prices for commodities, as measured by the CRB
Index, were rising.
When the Fed is being careful, you need to be careful, but you also need to be
monitoring the markets. For example, both the S&P 500 Index and the December
2005 crude oil complex had big rallies in the 2003–2004 period. The connec-
tion was the money supply, which had been growing steadily since the Fed
began lowering interest rates after the events of September 11, 2001. By 2003,

the economy began to grow, demand for oil picked up, and the S&P 500 Index
began to indicate an economic recovery.
The money supply growth rate, when put together with other market indica-
tors such as consumer prices and the CRB Index, likewise can be a useful set
of trading tools.
Putting Fiat to Work for You
The average person may find the fiat concept difficult to grasp. But as a
futures trader, it is the center of your universe. If you can figure out which
way interest rates are headed and where money is flowing, most of what hap-
pens in the markets in general will fall into place, and you can make better
decisions about which way to trade. Keep these relationships in mind:
 Futures markets often move based on the relationship between the bond
market and the Fed, which means that when either the Fed or the bond
market moves interest rates in one direction, the other eventually will
follow. See Chapters 6 and 10.
 Higher interest rates tend to eventually slow economic growth, while
lower interest rates tend to spur economies.
A perfect example of how the system works occurred after the events of
September 11, 2001. In response to the catastrophe, the Fed lowered key offi-
cial interest rates, such as the Fed funds and discount rates, but it also
bought massive amounts of government treasuries, thus making much more
money available to the banking system.
Currency traders, who are not well-known for their patriotism, sold dollars,
and bought euros, yen, and other currencies, and effectively moved money
out of the United States.
Much of the money that the Fed injected into the system made its way to
China and ended up fueling the major economic boom in that country that
marked the post September 11, 2001, economic recovery.
China used the infusion of foreign money to finance a building boom that, in
turn, led to increased demand for oil and raw materials, such as copper, steel,
and lumber.
This major change in the flow of money spread to all the major futures mar-
kets and led to a bull market in commodities, because China bought increas-
ing amounts of steel, copper, and the fuel needed to power the boom — oil.
27
Chapter 2: Where Money Comes From

When the Fed began to raise interest rates, it did so partially with the inten-
tion of cooling off the growth in China and diverting the flow of dollars away
from Beijing and back to the U.S.
Get in the habit of watching all the markets together. When the Fed starts
lowering interest rates, it is doing so because it wants the economy to grow
and jobs to be created. When the Fed starts to ease rates, as a trader, you
want to start looking at what happens to commodities like copper, gold, oil,
and so on. The commodities markets provide you with confirmation of what
the markets in general are starting to expect as the Fed makes its move.
Normally, you begin to see these markets come to life at some point before or
after the Fed makes a move. For example, if you see the copper market start-
ing to move, you want to check on what the bond and stock markets are
doing, because smart money starts pricing in expectations of a change in
trend by the Fed.
Bonding with the Fed: The Nuts 
and Bolts of Interest Rates
If you want to make money in futures, you need to become intimately familiar
with what the Fed does and how it goes about it.
Credit makes the world go around. Credit enables everyone to have the
things they want now and to pay for them later. How much stuff you can buy
depends on how easy the Fed makes it for you to borrow the money. The Fed
wants to create an environment that prompts consumers to buy as much
stuff as they want without letting them create inflation.
One way the Fed raises and lowers interest rates is by buying or selling U.S.
Treasury bonds in the open market. In past decades, the market had to guess
what the Fed was trying to do with interest rates where the bond market was
concerned.
In the latter years of Alan Greenspan’s terms as Fed chairman, the central
bank became more open in its communications with the markets, but a fair
amount of Fedspeak, the often-difficult-to-decipher language from the central
bank, still was in use. In some cases it was even conjecture.
No matter what you think of the Fed and central banks in general, they’re a
fact of life, and the better you can understand them and decipher some of the
things they say and do, the better you can trade and make other decisions
about your money.
Finding out how central banks work is easier than trying to decipher what
they say and do. They buy and sell bonds and inject or extract money from
28
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

the banking system they control. When the Fed buys bonds, it gives the mar-
kets and the economy money. When the Fed sells bonds, it takes money out
of the markets and the economy. Pretty simple, right?
The amount of money that the Fed uses to buy bonds can signal which way the
Fed’s Board of Governors wants interest rates to go. This relationship is pretty
simple any more, because the Fed rarely goes into the bond market — other
than for routine maintenance of the money supply — without making a state-
ment. Routine maintenance is conducted by the New York Fed. An example is
when the Fed adds more reserves than usual during holiday periods, such as
Christmas, to make sure banks have enough money on hand to handle the shop-
ping season. In the new year, the Fed drains the extra reserves from the system.
This maneuver usually isn’t meant as a major economic action by the Fed.
When an announcement about interest rates is made, however, the Fed usu-
ally follows the announcement with a market action, either buying or selling
bonds to agree with its statement.
Relating Money Flows to 
the Financial Markets
Central banks have convinced the world’s population that money and its
wonderful extension, credit, are the centerpieces of the world’s economic
system. And the easier it is to borrow money, the more things get done and
the bigger things get built.
When central banks buy bonds from banks and dealers, they’re putting
money into circulation, making it easy for people and businesses to borrow.
At the juncture where money becomes easier to borrow, the potential for
commodity markets to become explosive reaches its zenith.
Commodity markets thrive on money, and their actions are directly related to
 Interest rates
 Underlying supply
 The perceptions and actions of the public, governments, and traders, as
they react to
• Supply — how much is available and how fast it’s going to be 
used up
• Demand — How long this period of rising demand is likely to last
Demand is not as important for most of the business cycle as the supply side
of the equation.
29
Chapter 2: Where Money Comes From

The higher the money supply, the easier it is to borrow, and the higher the
likelihood that commodity markets will rise. As more money chases fewer
goods, the chances of inflation rise, and the central banks begin to make it
more difficult to borrow money.
If you keep good tabs on the rate of growth of the money supply, you’ll proba-
bly be ahead of the curve on what future trends in the markets are going to be.
To make big money in all financial markets, futures and options included, you
have to find out how to spot changes in the trend of how easy or difficult it is
to borrow money. The perfect time to enter positions is as near as possible to
those inflection points in the flow of money — when they appear on the
charts as changes in the direction of a long-standing trend.
These moves can come before or after any changes in money supply or
adjustments to borrowing power appear. However, when a market trends in
one direction (up or down) for a considerable amount of time and suddenly
changes direction after you notice a blip in the money supply data, you know
that something important is happening, and you need to pay close attention
to it.

Chapter 3
The Futures Markets
In This Chapter
 Exploring how and where futures contracts originated
 Defining futures contracts, markets, and exchanges
 Understanding how futures contracts are governed
A
futures contract is a security, similar conceptually to a stock or a bond,
while being significantly different. For example, when you buy a stock,
you’re buying part of a company, while a bond makes you a lender to a gov-
ernment or a corporation.
Whereas a stock gives you equity and a bond makes you a debt holder, a
futures contract is a legally binding contract that sets the conditions for the
delivery of commodities or financial instruments at a specific time period in
the future.
Futures markets are the hub of capitalism, because they provide the bases
for prices at wholesale and eventually retail markets for commodities ranging
from gasoline and lumber to key items in the food chain, such as cattle, pork,
corn, and soybeans.
Futures contracts are available for more than just mainstream commodities,
including stock index futures, interest rate products — bonds and treasury
bills — and lesser known commodities like propane. Some futures contracts
are even designed to hedge against weather risk and for trading electricity.
Futures markets emerged and developed in fits and starts several hundred
years ago as a mechanism through which merchants traded goods and ser-
vices at some point in the future, based on their expectations for crops and
harvest yields.
Now virtually all financial and commodity markets are linked, with futures
and cash markets functioning as a single entity on a daily basis. Thus, as a
successful trader, you need to understand the basics of all major markets —
bonds, stocks, currencies, and commodities — and their relationships to
each other and the economic cycle.

In this chapter, you gain an understanding of who the major players are, how
the futures markets evolved to their prominent role in the global economy,
and what basic rules and regulations keep the markets as fair and reasonable
as possible.
Who Trades Futures?
The futures and options markets serve two major constituencies, hedgers
and speculators, two groups with differing interests, but without whose par-
ticipation the markets would not function.
Hedgers, in general, are major companies that actually produce the commodi-
ties, or others (like farmers) who have an inherent interest in the market.
Exxon Mobil is a perfect example of a hedger in the oil markets, because the
company must gauge the potential risk of weather, politics, and other exter-
nal factors on future oil production.
Hedgers may employ professional traders to use options and futures con-
tracts on commodities and related products to decrease the company’s risk
of loss. Their goal is not to profit from futures trading, but rather to cover
their risk of losses and keep company operations moving forward.

Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 
Considering the effects of a crash
The stock market crash of 1987 had one positive
result. It ushered in the era of the one market.
After that fateful day, October 19, 1987, anyone
who’d ever invested in any market understood
that all markets are linked, regardless of the
underlying securities traded on them, and that
money can and does flow at the speed of light
from one type of market to another. In fact, the
futures markets, according to Mark Powers, in
his book Starting Out In Futures Trading
(McGraw-Hill), are like “convenient laborato-
ries” for conducting market analysis.
After the 1987 crash, the Brady Commission
coined and defined the concept that all markets
were linked, because the action in one or more
of them had an influence on one or several
others. But the commission did little to dissuade
the media’s and the public’s perception that
the futures markets were not to blame for the
crash — something the Federal Reserve con-
cluded in its post-crash study released in 1988.
Another positive of the post-crash environment
was the implementation of circuit breakers, or
intraday limits on trading that slow or stop trad-
ing in specific products when the markets for
those products are moving too fast. The Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the Fed), the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC), and the various exchanges
(see the “Futures Exchanges: Where the Magic
Happens,” section later in this chapter for a list
of exchanges) also developed better techniques
for monitoring position sizes and overall market
liquidity after the crash.

Speculators, the second constituency (you and I), trade futures and options
contracts with a goal of making money from market trends and special situa-
tions. In other words, the speculator’s job is to see where the big money is
going and follow it there, regardless of whether prices are going up or down.
So although hedgers may actually take delivery or receive products specified
in a futures contract, speculators are trying to ride the price trend of those
products as long as possible, while always intending to cash in before the
delivery date.
Contract and Trading Rules
Futures contracts are by design meant to limit the amount of time and risk
exposure experienced by speculators and hedgers, those traders who use
them. As a result, futures contracts have several key characteristics that
enable traders to trade them effectively.
I briefly list them and describe them in the sections that follow and use these
explanations to expand on how the contracts work throughout the book.
Expiration
All futures contracts are time-based; they expire, which means that at some
point in the future they will no longer exist. From a trading standpoint, the
expiration of a contract forces you to make one of the following decisions:
 Sell the contract and roll it over by buying the contract for next front
month or another that’s further into the future.
 Sell the contract (taking your profits or losses) and just stay out of the
market.
 Take delivery of the underlying commodity, equity, or product repre-
sented by the contract.
Daily price limits
Because of their volatility and the potential for catastrophic losses, limits are
placed on futures contracts that freeze prices but do not freeze trading. Limits
are meant to let markets cool down during periods of extremely active trading.
It’s important to remember that the market can trade at the limit price but not
beyond it. Some contracts have variable limits, which means that the limits are
changed if the market closes at the limit. For example, if the cattle markets
close at the limit for two straight days, the limit is raised on the third day.

Chapter 3: The Futures Markets

Size of account
Most brokers require individuals to deposit a certain amount of money in a
brokerage account before they can start trading. A fairly constant figure in
the industry is $5,000.
For most people, depositing only $5,000 with the brokerage firm probably is
not enough to provide you with a good trading experience. Some experienced
traders will tell you that $100,000 is a better figure to have on hand, and
$20,000 is probably the least amount you can actually work with.
These are no hard and fast rules, though. The bottom line is that to be a suc-
cessful trader, you should know yourself and your risk tolerance, get a good
handle on your trading plan, let your winners ride, and cut your losses short.
You Can’t Just Swipe a Card: Exploring
the Uniqueness of the Futures Markets
Futures contracts are nothing like credit-card transactions. Buying something
and promising to pay for it later, the way you do when you go shopping with
a credit card, doesn’t make a futures contract. True futures contracts must
meet these six criteria, which have developed since the inception of the
futures markets:
 Trading must be conducted on an organized exchange, a physical place
where trading actually takes place either by open-cry trading in a trading
pit, which is what you always see on television when you turn on the busi-
ness channels, or by electronic means, which is an increasing phenome-
non, especially in Europe, where trading already is done electronically.
 Common rules govern all transactions. The two most important ones are
as follows:
• Trading occurs in one designated place, the ring or pit of the
exchange, by open outcry during specific trading hours, with every
participant having equal access to the bids and offers and the flow
of trading.
• No exchange member can offer to fill or match an order without
first offering it to the crowd. A member is a firm or an individual
that buys a seat on the exchange, or the privilege to trade directly
for his own account and to be an intermediary for other traders.
When a floor broker fills an order, he is fulfilling your request from
his own inventory of futures contracts. When a floor broker matches
an order, he is fulfilling your request by finding a buyer or seller in
the trading crowd and matching the buyer with the seller.
34
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

 Contract sizes, delivery dates, mode of delivery, and procedure are
standardized.
 Traders negotiate only the original transaction with each other. Beyond
the original agreement, the exchange becomes a clearinghouse, and the
obligation of the parties to a futures contract transaction is with the
exchange.
 Futures contracts are canceled, or closed out, by offset. When a trader
sells a contract to deliver a specific amount of a marketable product for
December delivery, he has an obligation to deliver that product to the
exchange by December. If he buys a contract for the same amount of
that product before December, then he has met his obligation; he has
offset the original sale with an equivalent buy and is out of the market.
 The exchange clearinghouse acts as a guarantor, or guardian, for each
transaction, requiring its members to have minimum amounts of work-
ing capital and enough funds to meet their outstanding debts. Exchange
members that are not clearinghouse members must associate with
exchange members that are to guarantee and verify all contracts.
Futures Exchanges: Where 
the Magic Happens
Several active futures and options exchanges are open for business in the
United States. Each has its own niche, but some overlaps occur in the types
of contracts that are traded. In this section, I cover the basics of three of the
more frequently used Chicago exchanges. The names of the exchanges are
as follows:
 Chicago Board Options Exchange (www.cboe.com): The premier
options exchange market in the world, the CBOE specializes in trading
options on individual stocks, stock index futures, interest rate futures,
and a broad array of specialized products such as exchange-traded
mutual funds. The CBOE is not a futures exchange but is included here
to be complete, because futures and options can be traded simultane-
ously, as part of a single strategy.
 Chicago Board of Trade (www.cbot.com): Trades are made in futures
contracts for the agriculturals, interest rates, Dow Indexes, and metals.
Specific contracts traded on the CBOT include
• Agricultural futures: Corn, the soybean complex, wheat, ethanol,
oats, rough rice, and mini contracts in corn, soybeans, and wheat
• Interest rate–related futures: Treasury bonds, spreads, Fed funds,
municipal bonds, swaps, and German debt
35
Chapter 3: The Futures Markets

• Dow Jones Industrial Average: Dow Jones Industrial mini contracts
• Metals futures: Gold and silver and e-mini contracts for gold and
silver
 Chicago Mercantile Exchange (www.cme.com): The CME is the largest
futures exchange in North America. It trades a wide variety of instru-
ments, including commodities, stock index futures, foreign currencies,
interest rates, TRAKRS, and environmental futures. Among the contracts
traded on the CME are
• Commodities: Live cattle, milk, lean hogs, feeder cattle, butter,
pork bellies, lumber, the Goldman Sachs Commodities Index (and
associated futures contracts), and fertilizer
• Stock index futures: S&P 500, S&P 500 Midcap, S&P Small Cap 600,
NASDAQ Composite, NASDAQ 100, Russell 2000, and the corre-
sponding e-mini contracts for all the major indexes traded
• Other important stock-related contracts: Single stock futures,
futures on exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and futures on Japan’s
Nikkei 225 index
• Options: Options on the futures contracts the CME lists
 Kansas City Board of Trade (KCBT, www.kcbt.com): The KCBT is a
regional exchange that specializes in wheat futures and offers trading on
stock index futures for the Value Line Index, a broad listing of 1,700 stocks.
 Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGEX, www.mgex.com): MGEX is a
regional exchange that trades three kinds of seasonally different wheat
futures, and offers futures and options on the National Corn Index and
the National Soybeans Index.
 New York Board of Trade (NYBOT, www.nybot.com): A major interna-
tional exchange, the NYBOT offers a broad array of products, including
• Commodities: Sugar, cocoa, cotton, frozen orange juice, ethanol
and pulp, and the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
• Currencies: U.S. dollar index and a wide variety of foreign currency
pairs and cross rates
• Stock index futures: Russell Equity Indexes and NYSE Composite
Index
 New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX, www.nymex.com): The
NYMEX is the hub for energy trading in
• Energy futures: Light sweet crude, natural gas, unleaded gasoline,
heating oil, electricity, propane, and coal
• Metals: Gold, silver, platinum, copper, palladium, and aluminum
Futures contracts for the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index and options on
the futures contracts that the CME lists also are traded on the CME.
36
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

E-mini contracts are smaller-value versions of the larger contracts, and they
trade for a fraction of the price of the full value instrument and thus are more
suitable for small accounts. The attractive feature of e-mini contracts is that
you can participate in the market’s movements for lesser investment amounts.
Be sure to check commissions and other prerequisites before you trade,
though.
The Trading Floor: How Trading
Actually Takes Place
The United States still uses the open-cry system of futures trading, where
traders on a trading floor or in a trading pit shout and use hand signals to
make transactions or trades with each other. Futures contracts are traded
in a clear, albeit nonlinear order.
When you call your broker, he relays a message to the trading floor, where a
runner relays the message to the floor broker, who then executes the trade.
The runner then relays the trade confirmation back to your broker, who
tells you how it went. The order is just about the same when you trade
futures online, except that you receive a trade confirmation via an e-mail
or other online communiqué.
Trade reporters on the floor of the exchange watch for executed trades,
record them, and then transmit these transactions to the exchange, which,
in turn, transmits the price to the entire world almost simultaneously.
Shifting sands: Twenty-four-hour trading
Around the world, most futures exchanges have converted from open-cry
to electronic trading. In the U.S., physical commodities, such as agriculturals
and oil, are still traded primarily by an open-cry system; however, most futures
markets also offer electronic models of trading because they provide
 A more level playing field
 More price transparency
 Lower transaction costs
Globex, the electronic data and trading system founded in 1992, extends
futures trading beyond the pits and into an electronic overnight session.
Globex is active 23 hours per day, and contracts are traded on it for
Eurodollars, S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, foreign exchange rates, and the CME 
e-mini futures. You can also trade options and spreads on Globex.
37
Chapter 3: The Futures Markets

When you turn to the financial news on CNBC before the stock market opens,
you see quotes for the S&P 500 futures and others taken from Globex as
traders from around the world make electronic trades. Globex quotes are
real, meaning that if you kept a position open overnight, and you place a sell
stop under it, or you place a buy order with instructions to execute in
Globex, you may wake up the next morning with a new position, or out of a
position altogether.
Globex trading overnight tends to be thinner than trading during regular
market hours (usually from 8:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. eastern time), and it tends
to be more volatile in some ways than trading during regular hours.
You can monitor Globex stock index futures, Eurodollars, and currency
trades on a delayed basis overnight free of charge at www.cme.com/
trading/dta/del/globex.html.
Here are a few questions that you’ll want to ask your futures broker about
trading via Globex:
 Does the brokerage firm that you’re using provide access to Globex? If
so, what kind of an interface, front-end system or link to Globex does it
supply? You want to know whether the system is compatible and how
smoothly it works.
 Are the commissions for Globex trading different than the commissions
charged for using the firm’s regular trade routing?
 Are there any other rule or requirement changes, such as limits on the
number of contracts that you can trade, margin requirements, or other
particulars?
 You may want to put in an order by phone. Does the firm offer customer
support in after-hours trading?
You can find out more details about what you need to ask your broker about
using Globex at www.cme.com/files/Questionstoaskyourbroker5-9.pdf.
Talking the talk
If you’re going to trade futures, you have to know trader talk. Knowing sev-
eral key terms helps you get the job done and helps you understand what
reporters and advisors are talking about.
38
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Some key terms that refer to your expectations of the market include
 Going long, which means that you’re bullish, or positive on the market,
and that you want to buy something. When I say I’m long oil, in the con-
text of futures trading, it means that I own oil futures.
 Being short, which means that you’re bearish, or negative on the
market, and that your goal is to make money when the price of the
futures contract that you choose to short falls in price. If you deal in the
stock market, you know that you have to borrow stocks before you can
sell them short. In the futures market, you don’t have to borrow any-
thing; you just post the appropriate margin and instruct your broker
that you’re interested in selling short.
I know this can be confusing, so it is best looked upon from the point of
view of reversing, or offsetting, your position. Let’s look at an example in
a vacuum, just to illustrate the point. If you sell a crude oil contract
short at $59, and the price drops to $54, you have a $5 profit. At that
point, if you decide that you’ve made enough of a profit, you then offset
the position by buying back the contract to cover your short sale. In
other words, what you are selling short is the contract, and by offsetting
the position, you are now finished with the trade.
 Locals, which means the people in the trading pits. They’re usually among
the first to react to news and other events that affect the markets.
 Front month, which refers to the futures contract month nearest to expi-
ration. This time frame may not always feature the most widely quoted
futures contract. As one contract expires, the next contract in line
becomes the front month.
 Orders, which are instructions that lead to the completion of a trade.
They can be placed in a variety of ways, including
• A stop-loss order, which means that you want to limit your losses at
or above a certain price.
A stop-loss order becomes a market order (see next entry) to buy
or sell at the prevailing market price after the market touches the
stop price, or the price at which you’ve instructed the broker to
sell. A buy stop is placed above the market. A sell stop is placed
below the market. Stop orders can also be used to initiate a long or
short position, not just close (offset) an open position.
• When you place a market order, you’re not trying to get fresh fish.
It means that you’ll take the prevailing price that the market has
to offer.
• A trailing stop is a self-adjusting stop order. When you place a trail-
ing stop, it changes automatically depending on the price of the
underlying asset.
39
Chapter 3: The Futures Markets

 Hedging, which is a trading technique that’s used to manage risk. It may
mean that you’re setting up a trade that can go either way, and you want
to be prepared for whichever way the market breaks. In the context of
large producers of commodities, hedging means that they put strategies
in place in case the market does the opposite of what is expected, such
as a major and sudden rise in oil prices caused by a hurricane.
Some terms that can help you understand hedging are
• Putting on a hedge, which means that you’re setting up a trading
situation that enables you to cover all the bases for whichever way
the market decides to go. Hedgers often account for 20 percent to
40 percent of all the open, or active, futures contracts in a particu-
lar market. They’re usually companies or large entities that are
protecting their investments against the risk of price fluctuation
in the future by buying or shorting futures contracts.
• A cross hedge isn’t fancy shrubbery; it’s the act of using a different
contract to manage the risk of another contract in which you’re
primarily interested. For example, an oil company may use gaso-
line contracts to hedge the risk of their crude oil contracts.
 The Pit, which isn’t Hell, although if you’re on the wrong end of the
trade, it can be. The pit is where all futures contracts are traded during a
regular-hours trading session in the futures markets.
 Speculators, which are traders (usually small- to medium-sized) who are
trying to make money only from the fluctuation of prices without intend-
ing to take delivery of the contract.
 Floor brokers, who are agents that receive a commission to buy and sell
futures contracts for their clients, who generally are futures commission
merchants. A floor broker may also trade for his own account, under
certain restrictions. Floor traders rarely make agent trades. They use
their exchange membership to buy and sell futures for their own
accounts, taking advantage of very low commissions and immediate
access to market information. Floor brokers, by exchange rules, cannot
place their own orders ahead of yours. Your broker can trade for him-
self, but he cannot put his order in ahead of yours.
 Bid, which means the price at which you want to buy something.
 Offer, which means the price at which you are willing to sell something.
 Taking delivery, which means that you will take the product on which
you were speculating.
 Supply and demand equation, which is trader talk referring to whether
there are more buyers than sellers. When there are more sellers than
buyers, the equation tilts toward supply, and vice versa.
40
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

 Expiration, which isn’t referring to death or breathing out. When a con-
tract expires, expiration means that it’s no longer trading.
 Delivery, which is what futures contracts are all about — someone
actually delivering or handing something to someone else in exchange
for money.
Understanding the Individual Players
As I mention in “Who Trades Futures?” earlier in this chapter, the two major
categories of traders are hedgers and speculators.
Hedgers ain’t pruners
Farmers, producers, importers, and exporters are hedgers, because they
trade not only in futures contracts but also in the commodity, equity, or prod-
uct represented by the contract. They trade futures to secure the future price
of the commodity of which they will take delivery and then sell later in the
cash market. By buying or selling futures contracts, they protect themselves
against future price risks.
People who buy commodities, or holders, are said to be long, because they’re
looking to buy at the lowest possible price and sell at the highest possible
price.
Short sellers sell commodities in the hope that prices fall. If they are correct,
they offset, or close, the position at a lower price than when they sold it.
Futures contracts are attractive to longs and shorts, because they provide
price and time certainty, and reduce the risk associated with volatility, or the
speed at which prices change up or down. At the same time, hedging can
help lock in an acceptable price margin, or difference between the futures
price and the cash price for the commodity, and improve the risk between
the cost of the raw material and the retail cost of the final product by cover-
ing for any market-related losses. Note: Hedge positions don’t always work,
and in some cases, they can make losses worse.
The best current example of a hedger is an airline in the post September 11,
2001, world, and its fuel costs. Aside from labor, airplane fuel is by far the
most expensive component of an airline’s costs. A good airline also has
expertise in the oil market.
41
Chapter 3: The Futures Markets

Let’s say that Duarte Air (I know, I know, it’s self-serving promotion) is pro-
jecting a need for large amounts of jet fuel for the summer season, based on
the trends in travel during the past decade. Because I’m the CEO, my airline
also knows that demand for gasoline tends to rise in the summer; thus prices
for the jet fuel I need are also likely to rise because of refinery usage issues —
refineries switch a major portion of their summer production to gasoline.
Wanting to hedge my costs for crude oil in the summer, Duarte Air starts
buying July crude oil and gasoline futures a few months ahead of time,
hoping that as the prices rise, the profits from the trades can offset the costs
of the expected rise in jet fuel.
Say for instance that Duarte Air bought July crude futures at $50 per barrel in
December, and by June they were trading at $60 per barrel.
As the prices continued to rise, Duarte would start unloading the contracts,
pocketing the $10-per-barrel profit and using it to offset the higher costs of its
fuel in the spot market (during the summer travel season).
On the other hand, if Duarte’s hedging was wrong, and the price of oil went
down, the airline could always use options to hedge the futures contracts, or
go short, by selling futures contracts high and making money by buying them
back at lower prices if there was a sudden price drop. See Being short in
“Talking the talk,” earlier in this chapter.
Speculators don’t wonder
Speculators, in contrast to hedgers, are betting on the price change potential
for one reason only — profit. Speculators are doing the opposite of the
hedgers; they’re looking to increase risk and increase the chances of making
money.
A hedger tries to take the speculator’s money and vice versa. So a normal
futures transaction is likely to include a member of each of these subgroups.
A speculator, then, would likely be buying a contract from a hedger at a low
price, while the hedger is expecting the price to decline further.
Think of this dance in terms of risk. Hedgers are transferring the risk of price
variability to others in exchange for the cost of the hedge. Speculators
assume price variability risk, thus making the transfer possible in exchange
for the potential to gain. A hedger and a speculator can both be very happy
from the outcome of price variability in the same market.
42
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

This interaction between speculators and hedgers is what makes the futures
markets efficient. This efficiency and the accuracy of the supply-and-demand
equation (see the earlier “Talking the talk” section) increase as the underly-
ing contract gets closer to expiration and more information about what the
marketplace requires at the time of delivery becomes available.
Margin Basics
Margin is what makes futures trading so attractive, because it adds leverage
to futures contract trades. The downside is that if you don’t understand how
trading on a margin works, you can take on some big losses in a hurry.
You can reduce the risk of buying futures on margin by
 Trading contracts that are lower in volatility.
 Using advanced trading techniques such as spreads, or positions in
which you simultaneously buy and sell contracts in two different com-
modities or the same commodity for two different months, to reduce the
risk. An example of an intramarket spread is buying March crude oil and
selling April crude. An example of an intermarket spread is buying crude
oil and selling gasoline.
Trading on margin enables you to leverage your trading position. By that I
mean that you can control a larger amount of assets with a smaller amount of
money. Margins in the futures market generally are low; they tend to be near
the 10 percent range, so you can control, or trade, $100,000 worth of com-
modities or financial indexes with only $10,000 or so in your account.
Trading on margin in the stock market is a different concept than trading on
margin in the futures market.
In the stock market, the Federal Reserve sets the allowable margin at 50 per-
cent, so to trade stocks on margin, you must put up 50 percent of the value of
the trade. Futures margins are set by the futures exchanges and are different
for each different futures contract. Margins in the futures market can be
raised or lowered by the exchanges, depending on current market conditions
and the volatility of the underlying contract.
Generally, when you deposit a margin on a stock purchase, you buy partial
equity of the stock position and owe the balance as debt. In the futures
market, a margin acts as a security deposit that protects the exchange from
default by the customer or the brokerage house.
43
Chapter 3: The Futures Markets

When you trade futures on margin, in most cases you buy the right to partici-
pate in the price changes of the contract. Your margin is a sign of good faith,
or a sign that you’re willing to meet your contractual obligations with regard
to the trade.
In the futures market, your daily trading activity is marked to market, which
means that your net gain or net loss from changes in price of your outstand-
ing futures contracts open in your account are calculated and applied to your
account each day at the end of the trading day. Your gains are available for
use the following day for additional trading or withdrawal from your account.
Your net losses are removed from your account, reducing the amount you
have to trade with or that you can withdraw from your account.
I provide more detail about margins in Chapters 4 and 5, which are about
options.

about Options

I
f you’re confused about options, you’re not alone. You’ve probably heard
many crazy stories, such the as one I heard from an old friend about how
he lost his entire college loan portfolio on the advice of a fellow who had a
brother who supposedly was an options wizard.
The two of them, my friend and his pal, gave all the money they received for
college aid to the broker brother, who then quickly lost it in the markets
making bad trades.
That kind of story is enough to put a chill on anyone’s best intentions of
exploring how options work. And although risk exists, the options market
nevertheless is an area of the investment arena that truly goes hand in hand
with the futures markets.
In fact, when used properly, options give you an opportunity to diversify your
holdings beyond traditional investments and to hedge your portfolio against
risk. That’s what this chapter is about: discovering how to use options the
right way.

Decisions, Decisions: Figuring Out
Whether Options Are for You
Options probably are the most misunderstood members of the family tree of
securities. First, they go by strange names like puts and calls, and trading
strategies in the options markets sound even worse, with names like spreads,
hedges, strangles, and straddles.
Other confusing terms like premiums and strike prices also make understand-
ing options even more complex.
In a world where the stock market rules the publicity roost and mutual funds
rarely use options as a main part of their strategies, the average investor
thinks of these instruments as something better left alone.
The truth is, average investors probably are correct in avoiding options and
futures until they’ve at least done their homework. However, futures traders,
as you know, are not average investors. Futures traders, at least the ones who
survive the initial stages of torment and can ride out the inevitable and dis-
couraging down periods, are by nature risk takers. And options are an inte-
gral part of the trading game that futures traders play, although it is worth
noting that options and futures are viable stand-alone vehicles for trading.
Here is a quick checklist that should give you a good idea whether to include
options in your trading platform, although most of these points hold true in
one form or another for most investments:
 Options are a zero-sum game. By zero-sum game, I mean that for every
dollar someone makes, someone loses a dollar. In other words, options,
like futures, have both a seller and a buyer. The exception is when you
sell a covered call and the stock prices go up, you can exercise the call
and no one loses.
When you make a losing trade, someone else gets an amount equal to
your losses transferred to his or her account, and you get charged com-
mission. The exchanges also get a fee.
 If you win, you will probably owe taxes. The treatment of options in the
tax code is complex, and much of it deals with whether you have short-
term or long-term gains. The details are provided in the option disclosure
statement, which is required reading before you ever trade options. You
need to read that document carefully and discuss the tax-related details
with your accountant before trading. The statement is part of the packet
of information your broker gives you along with the account application.
46
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

 When you trade options, you’re up against ruthless, skilled, and vet-
eran professionals. Their main goal is to take your money away from
you. Some options market opponents are individuals, but others are
well-paid and well-informed traders for large corporations that trade
options every day as part of their business strategies.
 You need to know your trading opportunities well. George Kleinman,
in Trading Commodities & Financial Futures (Financial Times Prentice
Hall), calls patience “the number one essential quality for trading suc-
cess.” A patient trader waits for the right opportunities. Being overanx-
ious, he says, uses up your capital and kills your account over time.
Patience works on both sides of the equation. If you find a good trade,
then you must be able to wait until it plays itself out before you sell.
 Forget on-the-job training. Go into your trades with a well-thought-out
and well-researched plan.
 Lose the emotion, but keep the guts. That means you must be able to cut
your losses, admit that you were wrong, and wait for the next opportunity.
Can you win at the options-trading game? The answer: Yes, as long as you
understand the game and develop your trading plan accordingly.
Before you trade though, visit the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC) Web site at www.cftc.gov/opa/brochures/opafutures.htm.
There you can find a Web page entitled, “What You Should Know Before You
Trade.” It’s an excellent resource that provides you with a summary of what
you need to know before you open an options trading account and what to
avoid after you open one.
Although some traders trade options (and do it well) purely as a primary
vehicle of speculation, the primary function of a listed option (as it was
intended) is risk management, not speculation. This, of course, like anything
else, can be a controversial topic. For example, options, when applied prop-
erly, do offer limited risk and unlimited reward potential, and can be more
compelling than straight futures, especially for those who want to speculate
with less than $30,000.
Getting the Lay of the Land:
Stocks Versus Options
Just like stocks and futures contracts, options are securities that are subject
to binding agreements. The key is that options give you the right to buy or
sell an underlying security or asset, without being obligated to do so, as long
as you follow the rules of the options contract.
47
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

The key differences between options and stocks are
 Options are derivatives. A derivative is a financial instrument that gets
its value not from its own intrinsic value but rather from the value of the
underlying security and time. Options on the stock of IBM, for example,
are directly influenced by the price of IBM stock.
 Options, like futures contracts, have expiration dates, while stocks do
not. In other words, while you can hold the stock of an active company
for years, an option will expire, worthless, at some point in the future.
Options trade during the trading hours of the underlying asset.
 Owning an option doesn’t give the holder any share of the underlying
security. The right to buy or sell that security is what options are all
about.
Options, Not Love, American Style
The two major categories of options are based on the way they can be exer-
cised. When you exercise an option, you invoke the right to do what the
options contract gives you the right to do with regard to ownership of the
underlying asset. For example, if you own a call option, a bet that an underly-
ing asset will rise in value, and you exercise that bet, it means that you pay
for and now own the underlying asset.
 American-style options can be exercised, or acted upon, if your intent is
to do what the option gives you the right to do on or before the expira-
tion date. The person holding the option decides.
 European-style options can be exercised only on the date of expiration.
European-style options are traded on many of the cash-based indexes
that I detail in the next section. Most individual stock options and some
index options are traded under American-style options exercise rules.
All options can be exercised only once.
The advantage of American-style options is that you have more flexibility
when and how to exercise them. The advantage of European-style options is
that you are certain about the timeline you have until the option is exercised.
All stock options and some index options are American-style options. Some
cash-based index options are European-style. In addition, index options
are cash-based.
For example, options based on the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial
indexes are European-style. This distinction was put in place because of pres-
sure from institutional investors, large-scale traders who often have a difficult
time in executing strategies without tipping off the market that something is
going on.
48
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

If a large mutual fund has a complex option strategy in place that’s based on
American-style options, and a rival trader exercises the options involved in
the strategy, the mutual fund stands to lose millions of dollars without
expecting to do so.
By using European-style options, the fund may lose the same amount of
money upon exercise by a rival, but it doesn’t come as a surprise, because 
the fund manager knows when the option can be exercised. In other words, the
mutual fund has the opportunity to put a strategy in place to counteract the
effect of a potential exercise before it happens.
In other words, institutions prefer to write options on instruments that
restrict exercising by the buyer to only one day so that they can maintain the
hedge for the majority of the life of the trade and collect as much of the pre-
mium generated before buying back the position to close out. European style
allows them to do this while American style does not.
It’s also important to note that when institutions want to avoid tipping off the
market of their identity, they use brokerage accounts with different brokers
or have their orders worked offshore through the third market or Over The
Counter.
Choosing an options broker
One of your most important decisions about options trading is whether you
want to use a broker, which entails whether you want assistance with strat-
egy development, research, monitoring open positions, working orders, and
trade ideas or whether you want to do that yourself. Your futures broker usu-
ally can handle your options activity as it relates to futures and may be able
to handle stock option transactions. If you want to do all that stuff yourself,
then you just want to get access to the markets through the lowest cost
medium, usually an online discount broker.
Con artists, and unscrupulous advisors, lurk around every corner and prey
on the unsuspecting and uninformed options trader, so doing your options
homework is prudent and highly advisable. A few extra days or weeks of cau-
tion are not going to hurt you in the long run.
Unscrupulous people prey on the innate human need to have more than what
they start with and their generalized need to get something for nothing.
For example, just because someone recommends their brother-in-law to you
as an options wizard, you don’t necessarily want to give the guy your life’s
savings. Remember the example I described at the start of this chapter and
follow this advice:
 Be careful of financial advisors that advertise instant riches based on small
amounts of money and promise that they will return all of your money.
49
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

 Get to know who’s doing the trading and what methods they’re using
before you give them any of your money. Radio and television show
hosts who spend a lot of time on the air aren’t very likely to even see
your money, much less protect it. They’re too busy promoting their
shows and their management firms. They’ll have someone who they
employ do the trading. It may be someone who’s qualified or someone
who’ll cost you a great deal of money fast.
If you are interested in trading options, but aren’t sure about your own ability
to trade them, you need to find out everything that you can about the mar-
kets and find a good options broker/advisor to help you out.
When selecting a broker/advisor, you need to ask him or her these important
questions before deciding whether you’ll go with an advisor/broker or just a
broker who executes your trades. These questions are applicable to broker
and advisor candidates for online and managed accounts:
 What kinds of services does the brokerage firm offer?
 What commissions and other costs are charged and under what 
circumstances?
 How experienced in options trading is the broker who was assigned
to me?
 Is my broker registered with the Commodities Futures Trading
Commission/National Futures Association (CFTC/NFA)? This is applica-
ble to options on futures only. For stock options, the NASD and CBOE
memberships are critical.
If so, you can contact those organizations to find out whether the firm or
the broker is in good standing or if public records of previous discipli-
nary actions exist.
If disciplinary actions have been taken, ask for audited results, and
check out the auditor because they’ve had their own problems.
 What kind of results can I expect from the broker assigned to me?
Compare fees and services between the different advisor/broker candidates,
and match their results with their costs.
If you decide to establish a managed account, make sure early on that you’re
getting your money’s worth. Aside from getting good results, you’re paying
for customer service. If an advisor won’t talk to you and explain what he or
she is doing and why, or won’t meet with you on a regular basis to discuss
the account, that advisor probably is the wrong choice, especially when
you’re losing money. Most advisors will meet with you at least on a yearly
basis. Many meet with you on a quarterly basis.
Conversely, if your advisor is a little too friendly, you again may want to con-
sider changing. Developing more than a professional relationship can be costly.
50
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

If you’re an active trader and your advisor calls you with trades frequently,
make sure that he’s giving you winning trades. Otherwise, he’s probably
churning your account.
Make sure that you tell your advisor how much risk you are willing to take
and how involved you want to be. If he or she does things that make you
uncomfortable despite your wishes regarding the amount of risk you’re will-
ing to take, it’s time to say goodbye to that advisor. A good advisor tells you
whether (or not) you’re a good customer-match for the methods he’s accus-
tomed to using. When I meet with clients whose risk tolerance is different
from my own, I never take on their accounts. Avoiding discomfort before
money changes hands is the best course.
Risk tolerance is best measured in the context of your overall personality. If
you own a nice car and you have to go to the garage in the middle of the
night to see whether there are scratches on it, you are not a good candidate
for options trading.
What you want to know before trading
Not all options are created equal. In his book, Starting Out In Futures Trading
(McGraw-Hill), author Mark Powers offers the following checklist of what you
need to know before you start trading, which I’m paraphrasing:
 Are you trading a U.S. or a foreign option? And is it an exchange-
traded or dealer-traded option? U.S. options are easily followed, and
they’re regulated by the CFTC and so are all the parties involved in issu-
ing the contract. Exchange-traded options are standardized contracts
that are more liquid and can be hedged better against risk. That isn’t
always the case with other, over-the-counter options.
 Who is guaranteeing the transaction? U.S. exchanges and firms are con-
stantly monitored for liquidity and solvency. Foreign institutions are not
necessarily as well monitored, so their futures and options contracts
need to be checked individually, especially in the case of foreign options
or options that are not exchange traded. You want to know what the
markup is on the premium.
 How much of the premium that you pay is actually the value of the
option? In some cases, the fees involved when you deal with indepen-
dent options dealers can be very high and can hurt your transaction.
 What is the break-even price for your option? In other words, how
much price appreciation will be needed before you make money?
 How much in commissions are you paying, and what kind of service
are you getting for what you’re paying?
51
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

 Will your advisor/broker check several independent sources to find
out what expectations are with respect to the future price of the
underlying asset? If there is a widespread expectation that price will
change very little in the future, the premium that you pay should be low.
 How will you and your advisor/broker exercise your option, and
what will you receive when you do? Always know how you and your
broker will communicate. That means that you have to read and under-
stand the terms of the management contract carefully before you put
any money down.
 How will your broker let you know when your options contract has
been executed, and what the status of your account is? Online brokers
usually let you know this information automatically after your trade is
executed. Some traditional brokers call you sometime after the order
is executed. You have to do what is most comfortable for you. It’s impor-
tant to keep in mind, though, that options trading can be very short-term
oriented, and that the more you know combined with the greatest speed,
the better your chances are of keeping up with your account, and the
better the set of decisions you can make.
Types of options
Two types of options are traded. One kind lets you speculate on prices of the
underlying asset rising, and the other lets you bet on their fall. Options usu-
ally trade at a fraction of the price of the underlying asset, making them
attractive to investors with small accounts.
Calls
I think of a call option as a bet that the underlying asset is going to rise in
value. The more formal definition is that a call option gives you the right to
buy a defined amount of the underlying asset at a certain price before a cer-
tain amount of time expires. You’re buying that opportunity when you buy
the call option. If you don’t buy the asset by the time the option expires, you
lose only the money that you spent on the call option. You can always sell
your option prior to expiration to avoid exercising it, to avoid further loss, or
to profit if it has risen in value.
Call options usually rise in price when the underlying asset rises in price.
When you buy a call option, you put up the option premium for the right to
exercise an option to buy the underlying asset before the call option expires.
Buying the call option gives you the right to exercise it. When you exercise a
call, you’re buying the underlying stock or asset at the strike price, the prede-
termined price at which an option will be delivered when it is exercised.
52
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Puts
Put options are bets that the price of the underlying asset is going to fall. Puts
are excellent trading instruments when you’re trying to guard against losses
in stock, futures contracts, or commodities that you already own.
Buying a put option gives you the right to sell a specific quantity of the
underlying asset at a predetermined price, the strike price, during a certain
amount of time. Like calls, if you don’t exercise a put option, your risk is lim-
ited to the option premium, or the price you paid for it.
When you exercise a put option, you are exercising your right to sell the
underlying asset at the strike price.
Puts are sometimes thought of as portfolio insurance, because they give you
the option of selling a falling stock at a predetermined strike price.
You can also sell puts. For more details, check out the section “Being bullish
with puts,” later in this chapter.
Types of traders
Option buyers are also known as holders, and option sellers are known as
writers.
Call option holders have the right to buy a stipulated quantity of the underly-
ing asset specified in the contract. Put option holders have the right to sell a
specified amount of the underlying asset in the contract. Call and put holders
can exercise those rights at the strike price.
Call option writers have the potential obligation to sell. Put option buyers
have the potential obligation to buy.
Understanding option quotes
When you trade options, you have to look at quote boards on your machine,
even if you’re using a broker. You need to be familiar with what the broker is
looking at when he or she is providing you with an options quotation.
Figure 4-1 shows you a good generic example of a quote board provided by the
Chicago Board of Options Exchange, www.cboe.com, in an excellent online
tutorial at www.cboe.com/LearnCenter/Tutorials.aspx and www.cboe.
com/LearnCenter/cboeeducation/Course_01_01/mod_01_01.aspx.
On the quote board, you find information about option classes, series, and
pricing.
53
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

The strike price for the option in Figure 4-1 is $30, which means that upon
exercise, if you own a call, you can buy 100 shares per contract at $30 per
share, or if you own a put option and the strike price is $30 and you exercise
it, you can sell 100 shares per contract at $30 per share.
The May 30 call option for XYZ is the example used in Figure 4-1. So XYZ is
the option class, while May 30 is the option series, which is a grouping of
puts or calls of the same underlying asset with the same strike price and
expiration date. If you look above and below the May 30 series, you find other
option series listed, such as the May 25 puts and calls, listed two sections
above the circled series.
The premium, or the price, on the May 30 XYZ is two points. If this was a call
to buy XYZ stock, you’d pay $200, because options for stocks give you the
right to control 100-share lots of the stock.
Here’s an example of how options can be used efficiently:
Say you bought 100 shares of XYZ at $30. In that case, you’d pay $3,000
plus commission for the same number of shares that you can control
with a May 30 call option of XYZ.
If your XYZ shares went down $4 and you sold them at $26, you’d be out
$400. In contrast, if you own the option, even if you were to allow it to
expire worthless without exercising it, you’d lose only $200, your original
option premium.
The attractiveness of buying call options is that the upside potential is huge,
and the downside risk is limited to the original premium — the price you pay
for the option.

Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Don’t forget the expiration date
All stock options expire on the third Friday of the month. Options on futures
expire on different days depending on the contract. Sometimes different
classes of options expire on the same day.
These days are known as double-, triple-, and quadruple-witching days:
 Double-witching days are when any two of the different classes of options
(stock, stock-index options, and stock index futures options) expire.
 Triple-witching days are when all three classes expire simultaneously,
which happens on the third Friday at the end of a quarter.
 Quadruple-witching days are when all three classes of options expire
along with single stock futures options.
A summary of a sample call option trade
The CBOE tutorial summarizes how an options trade works and provides a
good overview of how the process works. See Figure 4-1 for an illustration.
Assume that you think XYZ stock is going to trade above $30 per share by the
expiration date, the third Friday of the month. So you buy a $30 call option
for $2, with a value of $200, plus commission, plus any other required fees.
If you’re right, and XYZ is up to $35 per share by the expiration date, you can
exercise your option, buy 100 shares of XYZ at $30, which costs you $3,000,
and then sell it on the open market at $35, realizing a gain of $500 minus your
initial $200 premium, commissions, and other fees.
In this case, your option is in the money, because the strike price is less than
the market price of the underlying asset.
When you, the option holder, put in your order, the dealer searches for some-
one on the other side of the trade, in other words the option writer, with the
same class and strike price of the option. The writer is then assigned the
trade and must sell his shares to you, if you exercise the option.
So, a call assignment requires the writer, the trader who sold the call option
to you, to sell his stock to you. A put assignment, on the other hand, requires
the person who sold you the put on the other side of the trade (again, the put
writer) to buy the stock from you, the put holder.
You have two other possibilities: You can hold the stock, knowing that you
have a $5 cushion, because you bought it at a discount, or you can sell the
option back to the market, hopefully at a profit.
55
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

According to the CBOE, most options never are exercised. Instead, most
traders sell the option back to the market.
A summary of a sample put option trade
For this example, you need to check out Figure 4-2. It shows a typical CBOE
options quote board, this time highlighting an August XYZ 30 put. If you buy
this put option, you buy the right to sell 100 shares of XYZ at a strike price of
$30 per share by or on the expiration date.
Here is a typical situation where buying a put option can be beneficial: Say, for
example, that you bought XYZ at $31, but you start getting concerned, because
the stock price is starting to drift down because the market is weakening.
A good way to protect yourself when you’re in this situation is to buy a put
option. So you decide to buy an August 30 put for a $1 premium, which costs
you $100.
By buying the put, you’re locking in the value of your stock at $30 per share
until the expiration date on the third Friday in August. If the stock price falls
to $20 per share, you still can sell it to someone at $30 per share, as long as
the option has not expired. Indeed, the put option gives you the right to sell
the stock at $30 no matter how low the price falls.
Using the put option as portfolio insurance fixes your worst risk at $200, which
includes the $100 premium you paid for the put option and the $1 per share
you can lose after originally paying $31 per share for the stock, if you exercise
the put.

Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Your other alternative when the stock falls below $30 is to sell the put to the
market and profit from the appreciation of the option while holding onto
the stock.
Being bullish with puts
You can sell put options and become a put writer. In doing so, you’re hoping
that the price of the underlying stock rises in a bullish strategy that actually
is more commonly used than the more highly publicized buying of puts.
When you write a put, you’re buying the obligation to buy the stock at the
striking price, and you receive the put option premium. If the underlying
stock advances and the put expires worthless, your maximum profit is equal
to the premium you received.
The catch to selling puts is the large downside risk. If the stock falls in price,
the put option appreciates and you can face large losses.
Writing uncovered puts is a strategy that’s similar to writing covered calls.
The least aggressive application of this strategy is to write the put when the
price of the stock is above the striking price.
For most beginning traders, it may be best to become familiar with covered-
call writing first, and then research this technique thoroughly, trying it out on
paper until you become comfortable with it.
Options on Futures
The major difference between trading stock options and options on futures —
the real meat of this discussion of options, in general — is that aside from
committing all the basic concepts of options to memory, you need to know
the particulars of the futures contract underlying your option strategy.
A good example is an option that is based on the S&P 500 Index futures con-
tract. The major characteristics of an S&P 500 Index futures contract are that
the underlying value of the contract is $250 multiplied by the value of the S&P
500 Index. So if you have a single contract that settled when the value of the
S&P 500 Index was 1,000, the value of the futures contract would be $250 ×
1,000, or $250,000. If the contract rose three points in value for that day, you’d
make $250 × 3, or $750.
57
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

The language barrier
You need to know several terms to be able to trade options. Most of this stuff
is fairly simple after you get the hang of it. But, if you’re like me, it isn’t much
fun when you start. Still, if you’re going to trade options, you must dig in and
continue to grapple with the lingo, including these terms:
 In the money: A call option is said to be in the money whenever the
strike price is less than the market price of the underlying security. A
put option is in the money whenever the strike price is greater than the
market price of the underlying security.
An example of an in-the-money call is when the XYZ stock was trading at
$35 per share while the call option’s strike price was $30 per share.
 At the money: Options are considered at the money when the strike
price and the market price are the same.
 Out of the money: Calls are out of the money when the strike price is
greater than the market price of the underlying security. Puts are out
of the money if the strike price is less than the market price of the
underlying security.
The Greek stuff
Options require you to pick up a bit of the Greek language, which is okay,
because you need to learn only four words, but they all are important.
The Greeks, as they are commonly called, are measurements of risk that
explain several variables that influence option prices. They are delta, gamma,
theta, and vega.
John Summa, who operates a Web site called OptionsNerd.com (www.
optionsnerd.com), summarizes the four terms nicely in an article he wrote
for Investopedia.com, which you can find at www.investopedia.com/
articles/optioninvestor/02/120602.asp.
But before actually getting into the Greek, you need to know the factors that
influence the change in the price of an option. After that, I tell you how it all
fits into the mix with the Greek terminology.
The three major price influences are
 Amount of volatility. An increase in volatility usually is positive for put
and call options, if you’re long in the option. If you’re the writer of the
option, an increase in volatility is negative.
58
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

 Changes in the time to expiration. The closer you get to the time of
expiration, the more negative the time factor becomes for a holder of
the option, and the less your potential for profit. Time value shrinks as
an option approaches expiration and is zero upon expiration of the
option.
 Changes in the price of the underlying asset. An increase in the price of
the underlying asset usually is a positive influence on the price of a call
option. A decrease in the price of the underlying instrument usually is
positive for put options and vice versa.
Interest rates, a fourth influence, are less important most of the time. Higher
interest rates make call options more expensive and put options less expen-
sive, in general. Now that you know the major and minor influences on price,
I can describe the Greeks.
Delta
Delta measures the effect of a change in the price of the underlying asset on
the option’s premium. Delta is best understood as the amount of change in
the price of an option for every one-point move in the underlying asset or the
percentage of the change in price of the underlying asset that is reflected in
the price of an option.
Delta values range from –100 to 0 for put options and from 0 to 100 for calls, or
–1 to 0 and 0 to 1, if you use the more commonly used expression in decimals.
Puts have a negative delta number, because of their inverse or negative rela-
tionship to the underlying asset. Put premiums, or prices, fall when the
underlying asset rises in price, and they rise when the underlying asset falls.
Call options have a positive relationship to the underlying asset and thus a
positive delta number. As the price of the underlying asset goes up, so do call
premiums, unless other variables are changed, such as implied volatility, time
to expiration, and interest rates.
Call premiums generally go down as the price of the underlying asset falls, as
long as no other influences are putting undue pressure on the option.
Here is how it works: An at-the-money call has a delta value of 0.5 or 50,
which tells you that the option’s premium will rise or fall by half a point with
a one-point move in the underlying asset.
Say, for example, that an at-the-money call option for wheat has a delta of 0.5.
If the wheat futures contract associated with the option goes up 10 cents,
the premium on the option will rise approximately by 5 cents, or 0.5 × 10 = 5.
The actual gain will be $250 because each cent in premium is worth $50 in the
contract.
59
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

The further into the money the option premium advances, the closer the rela-
tionship between the price of the underlying asset and the price of the option
becomes. When delta approaches 1 for calls, or –1 for puts, the price of the
option and the underlying asset move the same, assuming all the other vari-
ables remain under control.
Key factors about delta to remember are that delta:
 Is about 0.5 when an option is at the money and moves toward 1.0 as the
option moves deeper into the money.
 Tends to increase as you get closer to the expiration date for near or at-
the-money options.
 Is not a constant, because the effect of gamma (see the next section) is a
measure of the rate of change of delta in relation to the underlying asset.
 Is affected by changes in implied volatility. (See the section on “Under-
standing Volatility: The Las Vega Syndrome,” later in this chapter, for a
full discussion of implied volatility.)
Gamma
Gamma measures the rate of change of delta in relation to the change in the
price of the underlying asset, and it enables you to predict how much you’re
going to make or lose based on the movement of the underlying position.
The best way to understand this concept is to look at an example like the one
in Figure 4-3, which shows the changes in delta and gamma as the underlying
asset changes in price. The example features a short position in the S&P 500
September $930 call option as it rises in price from $925 on the left to $934 on
the right and is based on John Summa’s explanation of the Greeks. The chart
was prepared using OptionVue 5 Options Analytical Software, which is avail-
able from www.optionvue.com.
The further out of the money that a call option declines, the smaller the
delta, because changes in the underlying asset cause only small changes in
the option premium. The delta gets larger as the call option advances closer
to the money, which is a result of an increase in the underlying asset’s price.
In this case, the more out-of-the-money the option is, the better it gets for the
short seller of the option.
Line 1 of Figure 4-3 is a calculation of the profit or loss for the S&P 500 Index
futures 930 call option — $930 is the strike price of the S&P 500 Index futures
option that expires in September, as featured in Figure 4-3. The –200 line is
the at-the-money strike of the 930 call option, and each column represents a
one-point change in the underlying asset.
60
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

The at-the-money gamma of the underlying asset for the 930 option is –0.79,
and the delta is –52.34. What this tells you is that for every one-point move in
the depicted futures contract, delta will increase by exactly 0.79.
The position depicts a short call position that is losing money. The P/L line is
measuring Profit/Loss. The more negative the P/L numbers become, the more
in the red the position is. Note also that delta is increasingly negative as the
price of the option rises.
Finally, with delta being at –52.34, the position is expected to lose 0.5234
points in price with the next one-point rise in the underlying futures contract.
If you move one column to the right in Figure 4-3, you see the delta changes
to –53.13, which is an increase of 0.79 from –52.34.
Other important aspects of gamma are that it:
 Is smallest for deep out-of-the-money and in-the-money options.
 Is highest when the option gets near the money.
 Is positive for long options and negative for short options.
Theta
Theta is not often used by traders, but it is important because it measures
the effect of time on options. More specifically, theta measures the rate of
decline of the time premium (the effect on the option’s price of the time
remaining until option expiration) with the passage of time. Understanding
premium erosion due to the passage of time is critical to being successful at
trading options. Often the effects of theta will offset the effects of delta,
resulting in the trader being right about the direction of the move and still
losing money.

As time passes, and option expiration grows near, the value of the time pre-
mium decreases, and the amount of decrease grows faster as option expiration
nears.

The concept of how theta affects the price of an option can best be summa-
rized by looking in the fourth column of table, where the figure for T + 19
measures theta six days before the option’s expiration. The value 93.3 tells
you that the option is losing $93.30 per day, a major increase in time-influ-
enced loss of value compared with the figure for T + 0, where the option’s
loss of value attributed to time alone was only $45.40 per day.
Theta rises sharply during the last few weeks of trading and can do a consid-
erable amount of damage to a long holder’s position, which is made worse
when the option’s implied volatility is falling at the same time.
Understanding Volatility:
The Las Vega Syndrome
Vega measures risk exposure to changes in implied volatility and tells traders
how much an option’s price will rise or fall as the volatility of the option varies.
Vega is expressed as a value and can be found in the fifth row of Figure 4-4,
where the example cited in the figure shows that the short call option has a
negative vega value — which tells you that the position will gain in price if
the implied volatility falls. The value of vega tells you by how much the posi-
tion will gain in this case.
For example, if the at-the-money value for vega is –96.94, you know that for
each percentage-point drop in implied volatility, a short call position will gain
by $96.94.

Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Volatility is a measure of how fast and how much prices of the underlying
asset move and is key to understanding why option prices fluctuate and act
the way they do. In fact, volatility is the most important concept in options
trading, but it also can be difficult to grasp unless taken in small bites.
Fortunately, trading software programs provide a great deal of the informa-
tion needed to keep track of volatility. Nevertheless, you need to keep in
mind these two kinds of volatility:
 Implied volatility (IV), which is the estimated volatility of a security’s
price in real time, or as the option trades. Values for IV come from formu-
las that measure the options market’s expectations, offering a prediction
of the volatility of the underlying asset over the life of the option. It usu-
ally rises when the markets are in downtrends, and falls when the mar-
kets are in uptrends. Mark Powers, in Starting Out In Futures Trading
(McGraw-Hill), describes IV as an “up-to-date reading of how current
market participants view what is likely to happen.”
 Historical volatility (HV), which also is known as statistical volatility
(SV), is a measurement of the movement of the price of a financial asset
over time. It is calculated by figuring out the average deviation from the
average price of the asset in the given time period. Standard deviation is
the most common way to calculate historical volatility. HV measures
how fast prices of the underlying asset have been changing. It is stated
as a percentage and summarizes the recent movements in price.
HV is always changing and has to be calculated on a daily basis. Because it
can be very erratic, traders smooth out the numbers by using a moving aver-
age of the daily numbers. Moving averages are explained in detail in Chapter
7, which is about technical analysis. In general, though, the bigger the HV, the
more an option is worth. HV is used to calculate the probability of a price
movement occurring.
Whereas HV measures the rate of movement in the price of the underlying
asset, IV measures the price movement of the option itself.
Most of the time, IV is computed using a formula based on something called
the Black-Scholes model, which was introduced in 1973 (see the next sec-
tion). The goal of the Black-Sholes model, which is highly theoretical for
actual trading, is to calculate a fair market value of an option by incorporat-
ing multiple variables such as historical volatility, time premium, and strike
price. I’ll let you in on a little secret here: The Black-Sholes formula alone isn’t
very practical as a trading tool, because trading software automatically calcu-
lates the necessary measurements; however, the number it produces, IV, is
central to options trading.
63
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

HV and IV are often different numbers. That may sound simple, but there’s
more to it than meets the eye.
In a perfect world, HV and IV should be fairly close together, given the fact
that they are supposed to be measures of two financial assets that are intrin-
sically related to one another, the underlying asset and its option. In fact,
sometimes IV and HV actually are very close together. Yet the differences in
these numbers at different stages of the market cycle can provide excellent
trading opportunities. This concept is called options mispricing, and if you
can understand how to use it, options mispricing can help you make better
trading decisions.
When HV and IV are far apart, the price of the option is not reflecting the
actual volatility of the underlying asset. For example, if IV rises dramatically
and HV is very low, the underlying stock may be a possible candidate for a
takeover. Under those circumstances, the stock probably has been stuck in a
trading range as the market awaits news. At the same time, option premiums
may remain high because of the potential for sudden changes with regard to
the deal.
The bottom line is that HV and IV are useful tools in trading options. Most
software programs will graph out these two variables. When they are
charted, big spreads become easy to spot, and that enables you to look for
trading opportunities.
An overview of the Black-Scholes formula
The Black-Scholes formula was discovered by economists Myron Scholes,
Robert Merton, and the late Fischer Black. Scholes and Merton won the
Nobel Prize in economics for this formula in 1997. The formula is viewed by
some in the financial world as akin to the discovery of the DNA double helix.
Figure 4-4 presents this formula in all it’s glory.
The good news is that options software easily calculates values for HV and IV,
so as long as you know that option prices and their behavior are based on
the Black-Scholes formula and other models, all you have to do is worry
about how to trade.
Option buyers want to see high volatility, but sellers want to see low volatil-
ity. Figure 4-5, summarizes a short S&P 500 option position that has a nega-
tive vega, which means that the position will gain when IV falls. The negative
vega also indicates how much the position will gain.
64
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Option buyers want to see high volatility after they buy an option. Option
sellers want to see low volatility after they sell an option. For both scenarios,
the word “volatility” refers to both statistical and implied volatility.
C is the current call option value.
C = SN(d1) - Le-rTN(d1 - σ
)
T
S is the current stock price.
T = time to maturity of the option in years
N(d1) is a fraction (whose value is between 0 and 1) determined by the price of the
stock, the exercise price, the risk-free interest rate, the time to maturity of the call
option, and the volatility of the underlying stock price.
d1 is derived from the following formula:
where ln = natural logarithm, S = price of the stock, E = exercise price, r = risk-
free interest rate
σ = the volatility of the stock
is a fraction (whose value is between 0 and 1) determined by the price of the
stock, the exercise price, the risk-free interest rate, the time to maturity of the
option, and the volatility of the underlying stock price.
L is the exercise price, the price at which you have the right to buy the stock
when the call option expires.

value of money.

Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

Other vega facts that keep you out of the poorhouse are that it
 Can rise or fall without the price changes of the underlying asset.
 Can increase if the price of the underlying asset moves quickly, espe-
cially when the stock market declines fast or a commodity makes a big
move.
 Falls as expiration of the option nears.
Using volatility to make trading decisions
In Options As A Strategic Investment (Prentice-Hall Press), author Lawrence
McMillan, one of the gurus of options trading, notes that some option traders
ignore the price of the underlying asset, and trade the volatility chart. The
volatility chart usually is in a trading range, unless something extraordinary
happens, such as a takeover or a bad earnings report for a stock or a major
disruption of supply and demand for commodities.
Think of decreasing volatility as a coiled spring that is about to explode. As a
trader, you want to be able to predict when changes in volatility — and thus
changes in prices — are coming. One way to do that is to keep tabs on HV.
You can chart 10-, 20-, 50-, and 100-day volatility figures.
Watch the trends during each of the four periods. If the 100-day volatility was
60 percent and the 10-day volatility was 10 percent, the volatility in price of
the underlying asset is slowing. When prices begin to congregate in narrower
trading ranges, volatility begins to decrease, and it can be sign that a big
move is coming. That’s when you can

 Start paying closer attention to the option series and making potential
trading plans.
 Decide whether IV is cheap or expensive, no matter what you may think
the prospects of the underlying asset are.
 Play the momentum, which is also a good strategy with options, regard-
less of volatility. A couple of simple but powerful algorithms are buying
calls or selling puts in stocks currently trending higher, or buying puts
and selling calls in markets currently trending lower. In other words,
paying attention to strong price trends can outweigh all volatility 
considerations.
When the majority of traders expects the underlying asset to be nonvolatile,
as indicated by low volatility measurements, or wide spreads between HV
and IV appear (see the previous section), you need to be buying volatility.
That means when everyone else is selling options, you need to analyze the
situation and pick the options with the best potential to buy, always knowing
that you can be wrong and making plans to get out of the positions before
you lose a whole lot of money.
Selling expensive options
and buying cheap ones
The key to trading options based on implied volatility and to buying and sell-
ing them correctly at market extremes is to determine whether the option is
at an extreme either because that’s the way the market sees things or
because someone with inside information is setting up to make some money
when the news breaks.
Option premiums (prices) reach extremes for logical reasons. The two most
common reasons are that the market has just reached an extreme — because
the market is doing what it thinks is best — or that someone knows some-
thing that the rest of the market does not and is setting up a trade to make
some big money. That inside knowledge can be anything from a corporate
takeover to obtaining grain or oil supply information in advance of its regu-
larly scheduled release. Most of the time, these signs appear in near-term
options, especially the at-the-money strike price and sometimes the next
strike price out of the money.
67
Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

The next step is recognizing that other option series are starting to gather
momentum, because market makers smell that something is up and start
buying options for their own accounts to cover their short positions. Market
makers tend to be short more often than not to protect themselves, because
with access to all the trading activity data, they have better information than
the public in general.
When option volume and IV pick up, look at the underlying assets and at the
action in other option series. If the underlying asset doesn’t make a move and
the action in other options doesn’t start to pick up, then what’s probably
happening is that a hedge fund or other market mover is putting on a big
hedge or establishing a large position to protect its portfolio.
Rising options prices combined with the propagation of high volume and/or
implied volatility, with or without a rise in the price of the underlying asset,
are signs that the options market makers are on the move. These smart guys
usually can tell when someone is putting on a hedge or when something else
is really up. Most of the time, market makers are in risky positions against the
market trend. When the action starts to pick up, the first thing they do is try
to figure out whether the spike in activity is something major or just a hedge.
If market makers determine that something major is going on, they try to buy
all the options they can find on the other side of their current positions. If
they can’t find options, they start buying the underlying assets — stocks or
futures contracts.
When you see big rises in trading volume and implied volatility in an option,
it’s a fairly good sign that somebody knows something that few others know.
Staying away from such trades, or at least not selling in volatility, is a good
idea. These can be highly risky situations that can turn on a dime and can
make you lose money very quickly.
I show you a real-time example of a series of options in Table 4-1 that I got
using a shareware program. These options show high implied volatility and
how to make sense of it. The program is called Open Interest, and you can
download it for free from Rocky Point Software, www.rpsw.com/index.html.
Shareware like Open Interest is a good way to get familiar with options data
without spending a bunch of money.
The options series is for the volatile biotech stock Affymetrix, which has an
options symbol that features the letters FIQ.

Chapter 4: Understanding the Not-So-Hair-Raising Truth about Options

As you can see in the table, implied volatility is high for the May series of
calls and puts. The letters C and P next to the strike prices let you know
whether the option is a call or a put. The software highlighted more put
option series with high implied volatility than calls, however, which suggests
that market makers feared something bad was going to happen.
I owned Affymetrix stock while writing this chapter, so I had a vested interest
in knowing what was happening. I went to affymetrix.com, looked in its
news link, and found that the company was going to be making several key
scientific presentations at several meetings in May.
If you look at the open interest and volume columns in the table, you see that
at least at the time I looked, no evidence that market makers were scrambling
to cover their short positions could be found and nothing indicated that any
negative news was about to hit the pipeline.
Screening for volatility with software
Options screening software helps you cut through the clutter. For more
sophisticated analysis than the bare-bones provided by free software, you
have to spend some money.
Many good options-trading programs are available. Among the most popular
programs is OptionVue 5 Options Analysis Software. This program has been
around since 1982, and it has just about everything anyone could want to
analyze options and find trades. Many traders use OptionsVue and consider
it the benchmark program.
Most programs on the market are good enough to generate decent data. You
want to find the one that’s easiest for you to use and in the right price range.
Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities magazine, www.traders.com,
has excellent software reviews, and it operates an annual readers’ poll to
determine which programs its readers think are the best. This magazine/Web
site is a good place to do your homework.

his chapter covers the bare minimum of option strategies, so it isn’t
meant to cover every possible permutation of this complex style of
investing. This chapter does, however, cover the more commonly used
strategies and offers plenty of examples to get you going.
As a rule, paper trading — simulating or practicing real trades on paper —
before you make real trades is never a bad idea. Another good rule for begin-
ning traders who insist on trading real money is to trade only in small lots
or small amounts of money, one contract at a time. Finding a good options
advisor/broker, one with a conscience who can run your option strategies for
you — at least until you get your feet wet — is another worthy consideration.
If you find such a person, you need not balk if his or her fees are higher than
the competition, because you probably are getting your money’s worth.
The basic option techniques outlined in this chapter are complex but not
complicated. You need to understand several important factors about the
process, so you have to pay close attention not only to what you’re doing but
also to why you’re doing it.
Before you decide to trade options, you need to know that some option posi-
tions have the potential for unlimited losses and that those losses can hit you
hard and fast if you get caught on the wrong side of the trade.

The four mainstream groups of options available to trade are options on
stocks, index options, options on futures, and long-term options on stocks.
Each has its own particular quirks but still is dependent on the basic rules of
volatility and the action of the underlying asset. This chapter deals mainly
with options on stocks. Options on futures will be dealt with on an individual
basis because they pertain to each area of futures and each individual strat-
egy (see Chapters 13, 14, and 16).
Options on stocks are the most popular set of options, and, for the most
part, they’re widely listed and traded at several exchanges. The Chicago
Board Options Exchange (CBOE), the American Stock Exchange (Amex), the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX), and the Pacific Stock Exchange (PCX)
all trade in stock options. Your broker will route your trades to be executed
at different exchanges at different times.
In this chapter, you dig into basic option strategies in the stock market. The
goal is simple: Avoid losing your shirt.
Avoiding the Terrible Mistake
All traders, myself included, are prone to major screw-ups.
For some reason, even when you’re good at following your trading rules, you
have one of those periods where for years you ask yourself why you did what
you did that one time that cost you a bunch of money. Trading in options is
especially apt at bringing about these revealing moments about your lack of
smarts. You’re gonna do it anyway, so you may as well get it over with and
move on.
One of my more regrettable trades occurred in 1994, as the Federal Reserve
(the Fed) was ending a long line of interest-rate hikes.
I bought some Eurodollar futures. At that time, the interest-rate cycle had
reached its inflection point, or the point where a market turns — which
is totally unpredictable and becomes obvious only after the fact — and the
price of the contract was experiencing some volatility. I bought a futures
contract that had plenty of time left in it, just so I could be patient.
But when the volatility started, I just couldn’t stand it. I started freaking out
about getting a margin call. I didn’t want to be stopped out or automatically
taken out of my position because of volatility only to see my former position
rally without me. So I was following the trade by making phone calls on a fre-
quent basis to check how I was doing, because online trading was not as
advanced then as it is now.
72
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

After three worrisome days of market watching, I was completely exhausted,
and made one of those, “Oh my God,” phone calls to Lind-Waldock, the broker
where I had my account, and got out of the contract in the after-hours session
on Globex.
Within a few days of my panic sale, the bond market began a huge rally as the
Fed signaled that it was through raising rates. Eurodollar futures soared, and
I could have made a nice tidy little sum, several hundred dollars, if I remember
correctly, if I hadn’t been so nervous.
The worst thing is that I knew I was right about interest rates, because all my
indicators were flashing buy signals, and the economic data was showing
good evidence that the Fed had done its job in slowing the economy, and the
market was acting right.
Nevertheless, I truly got psyched out by the market’s movements and the
thought of getting a margin call.
The most important things to remember: Never trade against the trend, and
you have to stick with your trading plan.
In this case, I was right about everything and totally blew it on the execution
end, because I got totally freaked out about getting a margin call. The biggest
mistake I made was that I didn’t have a good trading plan to start with, and I
didn’t have a good way to monitor my trade, and that is a recipe for losing
your shirt.
And you need to be keenly aware of how much money you’re willing to risk. If
you’re writing (selling) calls, for example, and the stock continues to rise,
momentum is against you. If you’re buying puts, and the stock keeps rising,
that also is a sign that you’re in trouble, and you need to make a decision.
A Little Bookkeeping First, Please:
The Options Agreement
You have to sign an options agreement with your options broker to be able to
trade options. An options agreement, by the way, is separate from a margin
agreement. You actually need to sign both before you can trade options,
which trade mainly from margin accounts. Margin agreements are fully cov-
ered in Chapter 3, which is about the futures markets.
Option trading agreements came into being after brokers were sued because
of major losses in options trading by their clients. These documents are
pretty stout, spelling out the risks of options trading above your signature
and not only holding you liable for knowing the stuff on the agreement but
also expecting you to make good on the promises you make in the agreement.
73
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

You can trade options in cash or margin accounts. Some IRAs enable you to
trade certain kinds of options. Trading For Dummies by Michael Griffis and
Lita Epstein (Wiley) gives you an excellent overview of trading-account
requirements and details.
Rules for the use of margin on options accounts are very complex, and they
can vary from dealer to dealer. An excellent overview of margin rules for
options can be found at www.cboe.com/Institutional/Margin.aspx.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which governs the trading of
stocks and options on stocks, changed margin requirements for options trad-
ing in 1999 and now allows brokers to lend up to 25 percent of the required
margin to options traders, which means you must keep 75 percent of the
value of your positions in your account to be able to continue trading options
on margin.
That amount is important because the amount of money that the broker is
allowed to lend you to trade options is less than the amount of money he can
lend you for trading stocks. In other words, options already have a great deal
of leverage and risk built into them, and the SEC is trying to keep traders from
taking risks to levels that can lead to losing the entire value of their account.
When trading stocks on margin, you must keep only 50 percent of the amount
of the portfolio in your account.
For futures, on the other hand, you are allowed to keep much smaller
amounts of margin in the account. Remember, margin in futures is a good-
faith deposit. The broker is not lending you any money. Futures markets mar-
gins by design are lower than other margins, because futures contracts are
meant to be highly leveraged trading instruments, and their main attraction
is the potential they have for yielding large profits with small cash require-
ments. The flip side of course is the risk involved.
Margin requirements for different options and strategies sometimes are diffi-
cult to calculate and may vary among different brokers. Before setting up an
account, read the options and margin agreements from your broker carefully
so that you fully understand margin requirements for each individual class of
options that you’re trading.
Avoid Getting Caught Naked: All About
Covered Call Writing
When you write a call, you sell someone the right to buy an underlying stock
from you at a strike price that’s specified by the option series. As the writer,

you are now short the option. The buyer of your call is long the option. You
also are obligated to deliver the stock if the buyer decides to exercise the call
option.
When you write a naked call option, you’re selling someone else a chance to
bet that the underlying stock is going to go higher in price. The catch is that
you don’t own the stock, so if the buyer exercises the option, you need to
buy the stock at the market price to meet your obligation.
When you write a covered call option, you already own the shares. If you’re
exercised against, you just sell your shares at the strike price.
As a call writer, naked or covered, you are hoping that
 The stock goes nowhere
 You collect the premium
 The option expires worthless so you don’t have to come up with a hun-
dred shares of the stock to settle when the holder exercises the call,
which is what can happen with naked call writing
Covered call writing is a perfect strategy if you’re looking to smooth out your
portfolio’s performance and collect the extra income from the call premiums.
When you write a covered call, it means that you already own the underlying
stock. When the call expires worthless, you get to keep the stock and collect
all the dividends that accrued during the time the call was in play — not bad,
eh? When you write naked calls, however, it means that you do not own the
stock, but if the call expires worthless, you still keep the premium.
Writing covered calls is a safer strategy than writing naked calls. If the holder
exercises a naked call option, you have to buy the stock before you can
deliver it to him. If the stock price has risen in the interim, you could sustain
a serious loss in meeting the exercise.
Suppose ABC stock is selling at $50 per share, and a July 45 call sells for $5.
For a covered call strategy on ABC, your investment is $5,000 to buy 100
shares, minus the $500 premium that you receive for selling the July 45 call.
The potential return for this transaction is $500 ÷ $5,000, or 10 percent, with-
out including any dividends that the stock pays during the holding period or
the commissions you must pay to make the transactions.
If you sell an ABC July 45 call without owning the stock, your profit is limited
to 5 points, or $500. You make money if ABC is at or below $50 per share
when the call expires. However, if ABC rises in price, you can lose big bucks.
For example, if the price goes up to $100, the call would be priced around
$50. If you bought the option back at $100, you’d lose 50 points, or $4,500.
75
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

You can get around losing that much money when writing naked calls by fig-
uring out your break-even point and unwinding the position if the price
reaches that point. In the ABC example, it’s $55. Getting out of the trade
at your break-even point enables you to decide what you’re willing to lose
before ever making a trade. You have $500 in your pocket, so that’s not a bad
place to stop the bleeding if the trade goes against you.
Here are some tips to keep in mind about writing calls:
 A low volatility stock is perfect for call option writing.
 Writing in-the-money options offers better risk protection than writing
out-of-the-money options; however, the profit potential is greater when
you write out-of-the-money call options.
Think of your stock and your option as two different parts of one single posi-
tion. Each part
 Has its own role to play and is dependent on the other to perform a com-
plete job for your portfolio.
 Has its own cost, so you need to know the price of the stock when you
bought it and add in the price of the premium that you gain when you
sell the call.
Figure out how much you get from the strike price and the premium if the call
option is exercised against you. Always know your worst-case scenario
before you hit the trade button.
For the covered-call strategy to work best, you need to try to execute the
trades — buy the stock and write the call option — at the same time by
establishing a net position in which your goal is to achieve your net price, or
the price you set as your investment goal for the order. You can establish a
net position by placing a contingent order with your broker, which stipulates
how you want the order executed.
Contingent orders — also referred to as net orders — are not guaranteed by
the broker, who sometimes may refer to them as not-held orders, because if
the broker thinks the order is too difficult to fill, you’ll receive a “nothing
done” report, and the order won’t be filled.
If you’re unwilling to sell the stock against which you’re writing the covered
call, you shouldn’t even consider writing the option. You’ll probably get hurt
if someone exercises a call against you.
Here’s an example, loosely adapted from Lawrence McMillan’s Options As A
Strategic Investment. Buy 500 shares of ABC stock, at $38, in January, and sell
five July $40 call options at 3, for a total of $1,500. With this strategy, you’ve
76
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

established a covered-call position with a six-month duration. Selling the
options gives you $1,500, or 3 points (a point, in options language, as it per-
tains to this example is worth $100) per share of downside protection on
your 500 shares of ABC.
You lose money on your overall position if the price of your stock falls more
than the amount of downside protection you gained by selling the call option.
In other words, if ABC drops below $35, you’ve lost money on the overall
position, so you really need to do the math before you ever write a call.
Think about it. If the price of ABC falls three points ($3 per share) and you still
own the stock, you’ve lost $1,500 of the value of that portion of the position.
However, because you wrote call options, you had $1,500 worth of downside
protection, so at the $35 price level, you’re essentially breaking even. In other
words, by using the call-writing strategy, you’re essentially back where you
started on the overall position. The alternative would have been a $1,500 loss
(in the value of the stock — at least on paper), had you not written the call
option and held the stock without the protection of the option strategy.
If you change your mind after selling an option, you can buy it back in the
marketplace. The buyer can also sell his options to the marketplace. This
rule applies to both puts and calls.
Service after the Sale: Following Up
after Writing a Call
Your job as an options trader starts when you make the transaction. The
heavy lifting is what lies ahead — managing the position, which is more diffi-
cult in some ways than opening the position. You can do some pretty tricky
things with options, and in this section, I keep the examples and the tech-
niques as simple as possible, because there’s simply no way I can cover all
the subtleties of position management in one section of one chapter.
Two factors that are important to managing the position include
 What to do if a stock falls after you’ve written a covered call
 What to do as the covered call approaches expiration
Protecting your trade by diversification
A diversification strategy is pretty simple, and it works best when you own
more than a couple of hundred shares of a stock.
77
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

You can sell more than one covered call at different strike prices and for dif-
ferent time frames. Again, the goal is to spread out your risk against volatility
and your risk against the call you sold being exercised.
You can accomplish this strategy by writing in-the-money calls on some
stocks and out-of-the-money calls on other stocks in your portfolio. However,
setting up this strategy is difficult because writing out-of-the-money calls the-
oretically works better when you write them against stocks that do well.
In other words, to carry out this strategy, you are forced to decide which
stocks you think are likely to do better than others, which is difficult to do in
a simple stock picking strategy without the option strategy.
Conversely, writing in-the-money calls works better for stocks with low
volatility.
One way to get around this problem is to write half of the position against in-
the-money and half against out-of-the-money on the same stock.
In the ABC example featured in the previous two sections, you can accom-
plish this position by writing July 35 calls on one half of the position and July
45 calls at the same time on the other half; but to make the transaction sim-
pler, you’d have to own 600 shares — as opposed to the 500 shares you
owned in the previous example.
Knowing what to do when the stock rises
If your stock goes up, you can just let the buyer have it at the higher price.
You made your premium, and you sold your stock at a price that you were
comfortable with.
If you want to be aggressive, you can buy back your option, and roll up, or
write another call at a higher strike price. When you do, though, you incur a
debit in your trade, because you have to put up more money into the account.
Rolling up can be risky, because you can end up with a loss. Lawrence
McMillan, author of Options As A Strategic Investment (Prentice-Hall Press),
suggests that you shouldn’t roll up whenever you can’t withstand a 10-
percent correction in the stock’s price.
Rolling forward
Rolling forward is what you may want to do as your option’s expiration time
nears. You have to buy back your option and sell a new one with a longer
term but the same strike price.
78
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

You can let the stock be called away, but if your stock has low volatility and
your option strategy has been working for you, rolling forward usually is best.
How you make your decision is based on your projected costs of commis-
sions, fees, and what your break-even point will be for the position.
If you’re writing calls, make sure you’re willing to let the underlying stock get
called away. Otherwise, you’re likely to become sorry at some point. If the
position is going against you and you keep rolling up and forward, you’re
probably only making matters worse. At some point, you will hit the panic
button and buy back your calls at a loss. You’ll probably start selling put
options to generate some credits, but you’ll also end up placing yourself in a
position that can wipe out your whole account.
Hoping to Make Big Bucks with Small
Amounts of Money: Buying Calls
Call buying is different than call writing, because it isn’t usually used by
traders as a hedge against risk. Instead, call buying is used to make money on
stocks that are likely to go up in price.
Call buying is the most common technique used by individual investors, but
beware that success in this form of trading requires good stock-picking skills
and a sense of timing.
The main attraction of buying call options is the potential for making large
sums of money in short amounts of time, while limiting downside risk to only
the original amount of money that you put up when you bought the option.
When you buy a call option, you pay for it in full. You have to post no margin.
Here’s some advice to keep in mind when buying call options:
 Choose the right stock. Easier said than done, right? Buy call options on
stocks that look ready to break out. That means that you need to become
familiar with charting techniques and technical analysis (see Chapter 7).
 Use charts over fundamentals when you trade call options.
 Out-of-the-money calls have greater profit potential and greater risk.
 In-the-money calls may perform better when the stock does not move as
you expected.
 Don’t buy cheap call options just because they’re cheap.
 Near-term calls are riskier than far-term calls.
 Intermediate-term calls may offer the best risk/reward ratio.
79
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

Calculating the break-even price for a call
Before you buy any call option, you must calculate the break-even price by
using the following formula:
Strike price + Option premium cost + Commission and transaction costs =
Break-even price
So if you’re buying a December 50 call on ABC stock that sells for a $2.50 pre-
mium and the commission is $25, your break-even price would be
$50 + $2.50 + 0.25 = $52.75 per share
That means that to make a profit on this call option, the price per share of
ABC has to rise above $52.75.
Calculating the break-even price for a put
To calculate the break-even price for a put option, you subtract the premium
and the commission costs.
For a December 50 put on ABC stock that sells at a premium of $2.50, with a
commission of $25, your break-even point would be
$50 – $2.50 – 0.25 = $47.25 per share
That means the price per share of ABC stock must fall below $47.25 for you to
make a profit.
As a rule, make sure that you understand the fee structure used by your
broker before making any option trades. Fees differ significantly from one
broker to the next. Brokers frequently charge round-trip fees, which refer to
the fees that you’re charged on the way in and on the way out of an options
trading position. To figure out round-trip commission fees in the break-even
formula above, simply double the commission cost.
Two reasons for buying call options are
 Because you expect the stock to rise. ABC stock is selling at $50, and
you buy a six-month call, the December 55, at $3. You pay $300 for the
position. For the next six months you have a chance to make money if
the stock rises in price. If the stock goes up 10 points, or 20 percent,
your option also will rise, and because of leverage, the option will be
worth much more. If the price drops below $55 by the expiration date,
all you lose is your original $300 if you didn’t sell back the option prior
to that.
80
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

 Because you expect to have money later and don’t want to miss a
move up in a stock. Say for example, that you expect a nice sum of
money in a couple of weeks, and a stock you like is starting to move. You
can buy an option for a fraction of the price of the stock. When you get
your money, if you’re still interested, you can exercise your option and
buy the stock. If you’re wrong, you only lose a fraction of what you
would have by owning the stock.
Using delta to time call-buying decisions
Delta measures the amount by which the price of the call option will change,
up and down, every time the underlying stock moves 1 point.
Options are not good for day trading, but McMillan recommends trading the
underlying stock in a day-trading situation. This strategy follows the key con-
cept of using delta: The shorter the term of the strategy, the greater your
delta should be. The delta of the underlying stock is 1.0. Thus, the stock is
the most volatile instrument and therefore is best suited for day trading. Here
are some general rules to follow when using delta to time your call buying:
 For trades that you expect to hold for a week or less, use the highest
delta option you can find, because its moves will correlate the closest
with the underlying asset. In this case, short-term, in-the-money options
are the best bet.
 For intermediate-term trading, usually weeks in duration, use options
with smaller deltas. McMillan recommends using at-the-money options
for this time frame.
 For longer-term trading, choose low-delta options, either slightly out-of-
the-money or longer-term at-the-money options.
 How long you expect to hold an option determines in part which option
to buy.
Two good rules to keep in mind after you buy a call option:
 If the underlying stock tanks, you need to consider whether to sell your
option or to let it expire unexercised, because selling the option will
incur a commission cost.
 If the option rises in price, especially if it doubles in a short period of
time, take some profits.
A third rule consists of implementing a spread strategy by selling your prof-
itable option and buying a higher strike price option in the same stock. The
problem with this move is that you can lose money fast if the stock turns
around. If you sold your profitable initial position and stayed out of the
options in that particular stock, you kept your profit.
81
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

If you decided to do nothing, you can lose everything at expiration. For my
money, a good profit in my pocket is better than a great one that may never
come — the one that got away.
Spread strategies are extremely risky and recommended only for experienced
traders. They require margin, and each individual brokerage firm has differ-
ent specifications regarding how much margin is required. At the beginning of
an options trading strategy, keeping it simple is the best way to go. As you
become more experienced, you can start making more sophisticated bets.
McMillan offers extensive reading in the area of spreads in his book.
From the Top: Basic Put Option
Strategies
When you buy a put option, you’re hoping that the price of the underlying
stock falls.
You make money with puts when the price of the option rises, or when you
exercise the option to buy the stock at a price that’s below the strike price
and then sell the stock in the open market, pocketing the difference.
So, if you bought an ABC December 50 put, and ABC falls to $40 per share,
you can make money either by selling a put option that rises in price or by
buying the stock at $40 on the open market and then exercising the option,
thus selling your $40 stock to the writer for $50 per share, which is what
owning the put gave you the right to do.
Buying put options
Put options are either used as pure speculative vehicles or as protection
against the potential for stock prices to fall.
When you buy a put option, you are accomplishing essentially the same con-
cept without some of the more complicated details of short selling. Put
options also give you leverage because you don’t have to spend as much
money as you would trying to short-sell a stock.
By buying a put option, you limit your risk of a loss to the premium that you
paid for the put.
82
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Making the most of your put option buys
Out-of-the-money puts are riskier but offer greater reward potential than in-
the-money puts. The flip side is that if a stock falls a relatively small amount,
you’re likely to make more money from your put if you own an in-the-money
option.
McMillan points out an important point: Call options tend to move more dra-
matically than puts. You can buy the right put option, and the underlying
stock may have fallen significantly. Still, the market decided that the put
option should rise only 1 or 2 points. In an ideal world, you’d expect to be
greatly rewarded for buying a put option on a stock that collapses. But, in the
world of options pricing, things are not always what you’d expect them to be
because of the vagaries of trading, the time to expiration, and other major
influences on option pricing (see Chapter 4 for more about the Greeks).
To avoid this disappointment, you’re better off by buying in-the-money puts
unless the probability that the underlying stock is going to fall by a signifi-
cant amount is extremely high.
In contrast to call options, you may be able to buy a longer-term put option
for a fairly good price. Doing so is a good idea, because it gives you more
time for the stock to fall. Buying the longer-term put also protects you if the
stock rises, because its premium will likely drop less in price.
What to do if you have a huge profit
in a put option
If you’re lucky enough to get a nice drop in a stock on which you own a put
option, you can do several things:
 Take profits. Doing so guarantees that you lock in a gain if you execute
the trade in a timely manner.
 Do nothing.
 Sell your in-the-money put and buy an out-of-the money put. By opting
for this strategy, you’re taking partial profits and then extending your
risk and your profit potential if the stock continues to fall.
 Create a spread strategy by selling an out-of-the-money put against the
one you already own.
The first three strategies are self-explanatory, but creating a spread adds an
important new wrinkle to the possible strategies you can use.
83
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

One way to create the spread is to sell a different put option than the one you
already own.
You can, for instance, sell a December 45 put to offset the already profitable
December 50 put that you own, all so that you make some money off the sale
and lock in some of the costs of having bought the original December 50 put.
If the stock goes above 50, you lose everything. But if the stock falls below 45
and stabilizes, you make the 5-point maximum profit from the spread, which
is the best of all worlds in this strategy.
The second spread involves buying a call option. You can buy a December 45
call to limit your risk if the stock rises. See the previous sections about writ-
ing calls. Again your cost would be 5 points. Some of your costs of owning the
put have already been covered. And this spread guarantees you 5 points no
matter where the stock closes at expiration.
Spreads get the best results when the stock stabilizes in price after the
spread is put on. But it is more important that the stock price stays in the
profit range of the spread.
Buying put options — fully dressed
Buying a put option without owning the stock is called buying a naked put.
Naked puts give you the potential for profit if the underlying stock falls. But if
you own a stock and buy a put option on the same stock, you’re protecting
your position and limiting your downside risk for the life of the put option.
A good time to buy a put on a stock that you own is when you’ve made a sig-
nificant gain, but you’re not sure you want to cash out. You can also use puts
to protect against short-term volatility in long-term holdings.
In the first instance in the previous paragraph, your put option acts as an
insurance policy to protect your gains. In the second instance, if your put
goes up in value, you can sell it and decrease the paper losses on your stock.
You decide which put option to buy by calculating how much profit potential
you’re willing to lose if the stock goes up.
Out-of-the-money puts are cheap, but they won’t give you as much protection
as in-the-money puts until the stock falls to the strike price. In-the-money
puts are more expensive but can provide better insurance.
84
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Creating straddles
You can create a straddle when you simultaneously buy a put and a call for
the same stock at the same strike price and of the same duration.
With a straddle, if the underlying stock moves far enough, you can
 Make large potential profits
 Keep your losses to the amount of your initial investment
Say, for example, that you built a straddle based on ABC stock at $50 per
share and you bought a July 50 put option at 5 and a July 50 call option at 2.
You’d pay the difference between the two, which is 3 points.
If the stock rises to $55 at expiration, your call option would likely be worth
more than what you paid for it, and you could make money even if your put
expired worthless. If ABC was at $45 at expiration, then your put option
should be worth more than you paid for it, and you could make money on it.
If the stock is somewhere between the break-even points of $45 and $55 per
share at expiration, you’ll lose money.
The chances of losing all of your money in a straddle are small, but the
chances of making money in this strategy when you hold the position until
the expiration date also are small.
You want to build straddles on stocks that are likely to be volatile.
Taking small profits in a straddle can cost you money in the long run. You may
have to take a few small losses before you hit a big win. This particular gut-
wrenching quality about straddle strategy is what makes it more suitable for
experienced investors. If you’re interested in straddles, using an experienced
options broker/advisor who truly understands this strategy, at least during
your early trading experiences, may be your best, well, option.
You build a strangle with a put and a call that usually have the same expira-
tion date but different strike prices.
Strangles work best when the put and the call are out of the money. Strangles
are a risky strategy because you can lose money anywhere along the spread,
as opposed to straddles where you can only lose money at the strike price.
85
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

Getting naked with put sales
Selling naked put options is similar to buying a call option, because you make
money when the underlying stock goes up in price; however, it is a strategy
that is used more often than a covered-put sale, which is a totally different
and very complex strategy that isn’t worth discussing in this context.
Selling naked puts means you’re selling a put option without being short the
stock, and in the process, you’re hoping that the stock goes nowhere or rises,
which enables you to keep the premium without being assigned. If the stock
falls in a big way, and you get assigned, you can face big losses from having
to buy the stock in the open market to sell it to the party exercising the put
you sold.
You need to put up collateral to write naked puts, usually in an amount that is
equal to 20 percent of the current stock price plus the put premium minus
any out-of-the-money amount.
Here is how it works.
ABC is selling at $40 per share, and a four-month put with a striking price of
$40 is selling for 4 points. You have the potential to make $400 here or the
potential for a huge loss if the stock falls. Your loss is limited only because
the stock can’t go below zero.
The amount of collateral you’d need to put up would be $400, plus 20 percent
of the price of the stock, or $800. The minimum you’d have to put up, though,
would be 10 percent of the strike price, plus the put premium, even if the
amount is smaller than what you just calculated.
For beginning traders, it’s best to cut losses short whenever the underlying
stock drops in price.
Selling covered puts
Selling covered puts is a strategy that rarely is used, because it may be
among the most complex strategies in the options market and is not particu-
larly recommended for beginners.
A put sale is covered, not by owning the stock, but rather by having an open
short position on the underlying stock. Your margin is covered if you’re
also short the stock.
This strategy has the same kind of potential as buying a naked call — unlimited
upside risk and limited profit potential.
86
Part I: Understanding the Financial Markets 

Taxing issues: How the IRS gets
at your put options
The IRS taxes short-term and long-term profits on every sale of every trade
you make, except in a retirement account for which it taxes you later on,
when you withdraw the money. Some tax-specific details you need to know if
you’re trading put options include the following:
 Buying put options has no tax consequences if you’re a long-term holder,
usually greater than six months.
 Forfeiting any accrued time during the holding period, if you’re a short-
term holder of the stock and you buy a put option. Holding time won’t
begin to accrue again until you sell the put, or it expires.
Be sure to consult with your accountant before you trade any options.
Dividing issues: How dividends affect
put options
Dividends make put options more valuable, and the larger the dividend, the
more valuable the put becomes.
When stocks go ex-dividend, the day the dividend gets paid out, the amount
of the dividend reduces the price of the stock. As the stock falls, the put
increases in value.
The prices of puts and calls are not reduced by dividends. Instead, the price
reflects the effect of the dividend on the stock. Call prices fall as the stocks
pay out their dividends. Put prices rise as of the ex-dividend date.
Exercising your put option
Put and call options rarely are exercised in the stock market. Most option
traders take the gains on the options if they have them or cut their losses
short as early as possible if the market goes against them.
But if you’re the holder of a put option and you decide to exercise it, you’re
selling the underlying stock at the striking price, and you can sell the stock at
the strike price any time during the life of the option. If you write, or sell, the
put, you’re assigned the obligation of buying the stock at the strike price.
87
Chapter 5: Yeah Baby! Basic Stock Option Strategies

You can sell stock that you own at the strike price or buy stock in the open
market if you don’t own it, as in the case of a naked strategy, and then sell it
at the strike price.
You notify your broker how you’ll deliver or receive the stock. You must
make sure that you can satisfy any margin or other requirement involved,
and the exercise procedure and share transfer will be handled by the broker.

W
hen I started trading, I was overwhelmed by the amount of data that
was available. I had a hard time correlating how that data was related
to the movement of prices, and I thought that the whole thing was random.
My first reaction was to ignore the data and concentrate on the charts.
Although chart-watching worked well for a while, it wasn’t good enough to
get me in and out of positions fast enough or to prevent getting taken out of
positions only to see them turn around and go in the direction that I expected
them to go in the first place. I knew that I needed something else, so I began
watching how the market moved in response to economic data.
This is not the only approach to trading, as there are purists on both sides of
the aisle: those that propose charting as the best method, and those who
swear by the fundamentals. But rather than confuse you with a bunch of
jargon and useless justifications on either side, I can tell you that you’ll
decide what works best for you, and that for me, the best method is to use
charts as well as to keep my hands on the pulse of the economy.
It’s also fair to say that my problem in my early trading career was one of a
lack of experience, which could have been remedied by a much finer use of
different charting methods, as well as a better use of charts with different
time frames. See Chapter 7 for more on technical analysis.
Just remember that as you progress, you’ll gain your own insights into what
works best for you. Think of this book as a great place to get started.

Achieving a balance between what I want to know about the economy, what
I need to know, and what I can use took time. So, after considerable trial
and error, I’ve reached a comfortable middle ground: I am both an avid
chartist, or someone who studies price charts and uses technical analysis
of the financial markets to make trades, and also an avid follower of trends
in the economy, although not as in depth as you’d expect from a Nobel
Prize–winning economist.
The bottom line: Like many other successful traders, I understand how the
markets and the monthly economic indicators can morph into a nice and
reliable trading method. And so this chapter focuses on the effects of impor-
tant economic indicators on the bond markets, stock indexes, and currency
markets.
I purposely chose to illustrate examples of how economic reports can affect
the market from April 2005 for two major reasons. First, I wanted to show you
that the concepts that I describe in the chapter are relevant to what’s going
on now, in a global economy, during a controversial period in U.S. history, the
post-September 11, 2001, era. And second, the period of time chosen had just
about anything that a futures trader could ask for in the way of data that can
move the markets, especially a significant amount of activity in the oil
market, a booming housing market, and a Federal Reserve that was just hit-
ting its stride in a major cycle of interest-rate hikes.
Examples used to illustrate concepts and key economic reports in this chapter
and throughout most of the book are fairly current — mostly from 2005. I like
to make my books as current as possible. By the same token, I also look for
examples that are classical in nature. In other words, my goal is to make the
examples current but universal so that you can use them for an extended
period of time. Most markets behave similarly, but certainly not identically,
over time, so you have to be flexible in your interpretation of real-time trading.
When I provide examples, my goal is to give you as classic a set of parameters
as possible.
Understanding the U.S. Economy
Market experts and those well-versed in economic theory, along with politi-
cians and pundits, like to muddle things up when it comes to interpreting
data and formulating working summaries of economic activity. That’s how
they keep their jobs . . . by confusing the public when it comes to what’s
really happening with the economy.
92
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

But understanding how the economy works and making it fit your trading
approach doesn’t have to be that complicated. Simply stated, the United
States economy, the largest in the world, is dependent upon a series of deli-
cately intertwined relationships, so keep these factors in mind:
 Consumers drive the U.S. economy.
 Consumers need jobs to be able to buy things and keep the economy
going.
 The ebb and flow between the degree of joblessness and full employ-
ment, how easy or difficult it is to get credit, and how much the supply
of goods and services is in demand drive economic activity up or down.
As a rule, steady job growth, easy-enough credit, and a balance between
supply and demand are what the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
(the Fed) like to see in the economy. When one or more of these factors is out
of kilter (teeters off balance), the Fed has to act by raising or lowering inter-
est rates to either
 Tighten or loosen the consumer’s ability to obtain credit.
 Rein in a too high of a level of joblessness.
 Increase or decrease the supply side to bring it in line with demand, or
vice versa.
Each variable is monitored by individual government and private agencies
that produce a key series of monthly and quarterly reports. These reports, in
turn, are released on a regularly scheduled basis throughout the year. They
provide futures-and-options traders with a major portion of the road map
they need to decide which way the general-direction prices in their respec-
tive markets are headed. It’s all about the government and private-agency
reports and how the markets respond. Businesses are just the pawns of the
Fed and the markets.
The overall focus of the markets is on only one thing . . . what the Federal
Reserve is going to do to interest rates in response to the report(s) of the day
(see Chapter 1). Based on how traders (buyers and sellers) perceive their
markets before the Fed makes its move and their reactions after the Fed’s
response to economic conditions is announced, prices move in one direction
or the other.
As a futures and options trader, you need to understand how each of these
important reports can make your particular markets move and how to pre-
pare yourself for the possibilities of making money based on the relationship
93
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

between all of the individual components of the market and economic equa-
tion. Now that you know these basic truths about the U.S. economy, I’m going
to discuss the most important sets of data released by key reporting agencies
and how to use the information to make trades.
Getting a General Handle on the Reports
Economic reports are important tools in all markets, but they’re a way of life
for futures-and-options traders.
Each individual market has its own set of reports to which traders pay special
attention. But some key reports are among the prime catalysts for fluctuations
in the prices not only of all markets, but especially in the bond, stock, and cur-
rency markets, which form the centerpiece of the trading universe and are
linked to one another. Traders wait patiently for their release and act with
lightning speed as the data hit the wires.
Even so, some reports are more important during certain market cycles than
they are in others, and you have no way of predicting which of them will be
the report of the month, the quarter, or the year.
Nevertheless, Gross Domestic Product, the consumer and producer price
indexes, the monthly employment reports, and the Fed’s Beige Book, which
summarizes the economic activity as surveyed by the Fed’s regional banks,
are usually important and highly scrutinized.
The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) report, formerly the national pur-
chasing manager’s report, produced by the Institute for Supply Management,
also is important, and so is the Chicago purchasing manager’s report, which
usually is released one or two days prior to the ISM report.
Consumer confidence numbers from the University of Michigan and the
Conference Board usually are market movers, with bond, stock, and currency
traders paying special attention to them.
Sometimes weekly employment claims data can move the market if they
come in far above or below expectations. Retail sales numbers, especially
from major retailers, such as Wal-Mart, can move the markets, and so can the
budget deficit or surplus numbers. Consumer credit data can sometimes
move the market as well.
I highlight key reports that affect each individual market in the chapters that
deal specifically with those markets.
94
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Cable news outlets, major financial Web sites, and business radio networks —
CNBC and Bloomberg are two that I follow — broadcast every major report
as it is released, and the wire services send out alerts regarding the reports
to all major financial publishers not already covering the releases. The gov-
ernment agencies and companies that are responsible for the reports also
post them on their respective Web sites immediately at the announced time.
Exploring how economic reports are used
From a public policy standpoint, economic reports find their way into politi-
cal speeches in the House of Representatives and on the Senate floor. The
president and his advisors, other politicians, bureaucrats, and spin doctors
quote data from these reports widely and often, using them to suit their
current purposes.
From a trader’s point of view, you can best use them as
 Sources of new information: No one should ever have access to the data
in economic reports prior to their release — other than the press, which
receives it expressly under embargoed conditions, with instructions not
to release the data prior to the proper time — and key members of the
U.S. government, such as the Fed and the president. Anyone else who
has the data before the release can be prosecuted if they leak it to
anyone else.
 Risk management tools: You can place your money at risk if you ignore
any of the reports. Each has the potential for providing important infor-
mation that can create key turning points in the market.
 Harbingers of more important information: Individual headlines about
economic reports are only part of the important data. The markets
explore more data beyond what’s contained in the initial release.
Sometimes data hidden deep within a report become more important
than the initial knee-jerk reaction characterized within the headlines
and cause the market to reverses its course.
 Trend-setters: Current reports may not always be what matters. The
trend of the data from reports during the last few months, quarters, or
years, in addition to expectations for the future, also can be powerful
information that moves the markets up or down.
 Planning tools: Trading solely on economic reports can be very risky
and requires experience and thorough planning on your part.
95
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

Gaming the calendar
As a trader, your world is highly dependent on the economic calendar, the
listing of when reports will be released for the current month.
Each month a steady flow of economic data is generated and released by the
U.S. government and the private sector. These reports are
 A major influence on how the futures and the financial markets move in
general.
 A source of the cyclicality, or repetitive nature, of market movements.
You can get access to the calendar in many places. Most futures brokers post
the calendar on their Web sites and can mail you a copy along with key infor-
mation on their margin and commission rates — pretty convenient, eh?
Customer service in the futures market actually is quite awesome if you can
handle the greasy guys that you sometimes have to talk to.
The Wall Street Journal, Marketwatch.com, and other major news outlets also
publish the calendar, either fully posted for the month or for that particular
day or week.
The reports follow a familiar pattern, usually following each other in similar
sequence from one month to the next.
Exploring Specific Economic Reports
Some reports are more important than others, but at some point, they all have
the potential to influence the market. The reports that consistently carry the
most weight and result in the biggest shifts in the markets tend to be the
employment report, the Producer Price Index (PPI), the Consumer Price Index
(CPI), and two reports on consumer confidence. Other economic data that
have an important bearing on the markets include the Purchasing Manager’s
report from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), Beige Book reports pro-
duced eight times a year by the Federal Reserve, housing starts compiled by
the U.S. Department of Commerce, and of course, the granddaddy of all, the
Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which the Fed also produces.
In addition to these major economic releases, each individual market has its
own set of key reports. For example, the cattle markets (Chapter 15) aren’t
likely to be moved by data in the Purchasing Manager’s Report, but may be
moved by grain storage prices.
96
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Working the employment report
The U.S. Department of Labor’s employment report is the first piece of major
economic data released each month. It’s released on the first Friday of every
month and is formally known as the Employment Situation Report. Bond,
stock index, and currency futures are keyed upon the release of the number
at 8:30 a.m. eastern time.
The release of the employment data usually is followed by frenzied trading
that can last from a few minutes to an entire day, depending on what the data
shows and what the market was expecting. The report is so important that it
can set the trend for overall trading in the entire arena of the financial mar-
kets for several weeks after its release.
When consecutive reports show that a dominant trend is in place, the trend of
the overall market tends to remain in the same direction for extended periods
of time. The reversal of such a dominant trend can often be interpreted as a
signal that bonds, stock indexes, and currencies are going to change course.
The employment report is most important when the economy is shifting
gears, similar to the way it did after the events of September 11, 2001, and
during the 2004 presidential election. During the election, the markets not
only bet on the economic consequences of the report, but they also bet on
how the number of new jobs would affect the outcome of the election.
Traders use the employment report as one of several important clues to pre-
dict the future of interest rates.
For trading purposes, the major components of the employment report are
 The number of new jobs created: This number tends to predict which
way the strength of the economy is headed. Large numbers of new jobs
usually mean that the economy is growing. When the number of new
jobs begins to fall, it’s usually a sign that the economy is slowing.
 The unemployment rate: The rate of unemployment is more difficult to
interpret, but the trend in the rate is more important than the actual
monthly number. A workforce that is considered to be fully employed
usually is a sign that interest rates are going to rise, so the markets
begin to factor that into the equation.
Other subsections of the employment report have their moments in the sun.
For example, the household survey, which uses interviews from people that
work at home, was heavily scrutinized during the 2004 election season. The
numbers of self-employed people became more important as the election
neared, because the market began to price in an economic recovery based on
adding together the data from both the traditional establishment survey, which
measures the people who work for companies, with the household survey.
97
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

Be ready to make trades based on the reaction and not necessarily the report.
As with all economic and financial reports, the report may not be as important
as the market’s reaction to the report in terms of a trader making or losing
money.
Probing the Producer Price Index (PPI)
The PPI is an important report, but it doesn’t usually cause as big of market
moves as the CPI and the employment report.
The PPI measures prices at the producer level. In other words, it’s a measure-
ment of the cost of raw materials to companies that produce goods. The
market is interested in two things contained in this report:
 How fast these prices are rising: If a rise in PPI is significantly large in
comparison to previous months, the market checks to see where it’s
coming from.
For example, the May 2005 PPI report pegged prices at the producer
level as rising 0.6 percent in April, following a 0.7-percent increase in
March and a 0.4-percent hike in February. At first glance, the market
viewed the April increase (compared to the previous two months) as a
negative number. However, market makers discovered a note deeper in
the report, indicating that if you didn’t measure food and energy — in
this case (especially) oil prices — producer prices at the so-called core
level rose only 0.1 percent. The market looked at the core level, and
bonds rallied. You and I know that food and energy are important
expenses, and that if they are more expensive, we pay more. But futures
traders live in a different world when they’re in the trading pits and in
front of their trading screens, meaning they trade on their perceptions of
the data and not what you and I find intuitive.
 Whether producers are passing along any price hikes to their con-
sumers: If prices at the core level are tame, as they seemed to be in the
April 2005 report, traders will conduct business based on the informa-
tion they have in hand at least until the CPI is released — usually one or
two days after the PPI is released. In this case, based only on the PPI,
inflation at the core producer level was tame, so traders wagered that
producers were not passing any added costs onto the consumer.
Browsing in the Consumer Price
Index (CPI)
The CPI is the main inflation report for the futures and financial markets.
Unexpected rises in this indicator usually lead to falling bond prices, rising
interest rates, and increased market volatility.
98
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Consumer prices are important because consumer buying drives the U.S.
economy. No consumer demand at the retail level means no demand for
products along the other steps in the chain of manufacturers, wholesalers,
and retailers.
Here are some key factors that govern consumer prices and the inflation that
they measure:
 Prices at the consumer level are not as sensitive to supply and demand
as they are to the ability of retailers to pass their own costs on to con-
sumers. For example, clothing retailers can’t always or immediately
pass their wholesale costs for fabric components or labor to consumers,
because they’ll start buying discount clothing if premium apparel is too
expensive. Much of this volatility has to do with the fact that a large
amount of retail merchandise is made in Asia, where labor is cheap and
competition is stiff.
 Supply tends to be more important in many cases than demand. When
enough of something is available, prices tend to stay down. Scarcities,
however, don’t necessarily mean inflation (but they certainly can
accompany it).
 Inflation is not a price phenomenon but rather a monetary phenome-
non. When too much money is chasing too few goods, inflation appears.
 Inflationary expectations and consumer prices are related. This factor
is true because inflationary expectations are built into the cost of bor-
rowing money.
 By the time prices begin to rise at the consumer level, the supply-and-
demand equation, price discovery, and pressure on the system have
been ongoing at other levels of the price chain for some time.
The relationship between prices and interest rates is key to developing an
intuitive feeling for futures trading.
The true return on an investment is the percentage of the investment that
you gain after accounting for inflation. If your portfolio gains 20 percent for
five years and inflation is running at 10 percent during that period, you actu-
ally gained only 10 percent per year.
The release of the CPI usually moves the markets for interest-rate, currency,
and stock-index futures, and it’s one of the best reports with which to trade
option strategies, such as straddles. (For more about options strategies, see
Chapter 4.)
As with the PPI, traders want to know what the core CPI number is — that is,
prices at the consumer level without food and energy factored in.
99
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

The April 2005 CPI was another classic report. The initial line from the Labor
Department quoted consumer prices as rising 0.7 percent, a number that, if it
stood alone, would have caused a big sell-off in the bond market. However, as
the report revealed, that core number was unchanged, bonds and stock
futures had a big rally, which spilled over into the stock market that day.
Managing the ISM and purchasing 
manager’s reports
The Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) Report on Business usually
moves the markets, or is a market mover, however you want to say it. It mea-
sures the health of the manufacturing sector in the U.S. This report is based
on the input of purchasing managers surveyed across the U.S. and is com-
piled by the ISM.
The Report on Business is different from the regional purchasing manager’s
reports, although some regional reports, such as the Chicago-area report, often
serve as good predictors of the national data. You also need to know, however,
that the regional reports are not used as a basis for the national report.
The report addresses 11 categories, including the widely watched headline,
the PMI index.
Here is how to look at the ISM report:
 A number above 50 on the PMI means that the economy is growing.
 You want to find out whether the main index and the subsectors are
above or below 50.
 Just as important is whether the pace of growth is slowing or picking up
speed. The report, which is available at the ISM Web site at www.ism.ws/
ISMReport/ROB052005.cfm, clearly states whether each individual
sector is growing or not growing, and whether it is doing so because its
pace is slowing or picking up speed.
 The data for the entire report is included with a summary of the econ-
omy’s current state and pace near the headline of the report.
The April 2005 report concluded that the economy had been growing for 42
straight months and that the manufacturing sector had been growing for 23
straight months. The report concluded that although prices paid by manufac-
turers were on the rise and inventories were low, both the economy and the
manufacturing sector were still growing, but the growth rate was slowing.
The bond market rallied. The dollar strengthened. And stocks had a moder-
ate gain.
100
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

This particular ISM report had something for everybody, especially when you
compare it to the economic trends around the world in which Europe had
flat-to-lower growth rates, and China had a robust but also moderating
growth rate. A U.S. economy that is growing is good. But one that is growing
too fast can lead to inflation, so the bond markets also liked the report.
Steady growth with low production costs is good for company earnings, so
the stock markets liked it. Economic growth is likely to keep interest rates
steady or slightly higher, so the currency markets — which like to see steady
to higher interest rates — liked the report, too, particularly the dollar.
Considering consumer confidence
The report that measures consumer confidence is a big report that comes
from two sources that publish separate reports, the Conference Board, a pri-
vate research group, and the University of Michigan.
The Conference Board Survey
The Conference Board, Inc., publishes a monthly report based on survey
interviews of 5,000 consumers.
Key components of the Conference Board survey are
 The monthly index
 Current conditions
 Consumers’ outlook for the next six months
In April 2005, the monthly index fell, and so did the current condition and out-
look portions of the survey. The result: Bonds rallied, stocks rallied, and the
dollar remained steady. The report became another piece of the economic
puzzle at a key time in the U.S. economy. The way the market looked at the
data, following eight straight Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, showed
that the economy was starting to slow. To a layman, a slowing economy would
be bad news, but to a futures trader, the data meant that the Fed may be near-
ing the end of its rate hikes (or that interest rates may be leveling off).
The University of Michigan Survey
The University of Michigan conducts its own survey of consumer confidence,
and it publishes several preliminary reports and one final report per month.
Key components of the University of Michigan Survey are
 The Index of Consumer Confidence
 The Index of Consumer Expectations
 The Index of Current Economic conditions
101
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

In April 2005, the University of Michigan reported that “Consumer confidence
sank in April, marking the fourth consecutive monthly decline, with the
Sentiment Index falling to its lowest level since September 2003.”
The report cited “rising gas prices” and a poor job outlook as reasons for the
sag in consumer confidence and the increasingly negative data for consumer
expectations. The impact on the markets was predictable. Bonds rallied and
so eventually did stocks . . . after an initial dip.
Again, the key to the report was that consumer confidence was falling. When
consumers are less confident, the Fed is less likely to continue to raise inter-
est rates.
Perusing the Beige Book
The Beige Book is a key report from the Federal Reserve that is released eight
times per year. In each tome, the Fed produces a summary of current eco-
nomic activity in each of its districts, based on anecdotal information from
Fed bank presidents, key businesses, economists, and market experts, among
other sources.
The 12 Federal Reserve District Banks are located in Boston, New York,
Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis,
Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.
The Federal Reserve produces the Summary of Commentary on Current
Economic Conditions, otherwise known as the Beige Book. In it, the Fed sum-
marizes anecdotal reports on the economy by district and sector and pack-
ages it into a comprehensive summary of the 12 district reports. Each Beige
Book is prepared by a designated Federal Reserve Bank on a rotating basis.
The Beige Book is released to the members of the Federal Open Market
Committee (FOMC) before each of its meetings on interest rates, so it’s an
important source of information for the committee members when they’re
deciding in what direction they’ll vote to take interest rates.
On April 20, 2005, the Federal Reserve district in Dallas had its turn to pub-
lish the Beige Book and summarized its findings as follows:
Eleventh District economic activity expanded moderately in March and
early April. The manufacturing sector continued to rebound, while activ-
ity in financial and business services continued to expand at the same
pace reported in the last Beige Book (the one released March 9, 2005).
Retailers said they were disappointed with recent sales growth.
Residential construction continued to cool from last year’s strong pace,
amid signs that commercial real estate markets were slowly improving.
The energy industry strengthened further, and contacts said exploration
102
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

activity was expanding on the belief that energy prices would remain
high. Agricultural conditions remained generally positive. While activity
was strong in some industries, in many sectors contacts reported slightly
less optimism about the strength of activity for the rest of the year,
largely because demand has not been picking up as quickly as they had
hoped.
Traders look for any mention of labor shortages and wage pressures in the
Beige Book. If any such trends are mentioned, bonds may sell off, as rising
wage pressures are taken as a sign of building inflation in the pipeline. In this
edition, the book noted that banking and accounting were seeing some price
competition caused by a shortage of qualified workers but added that “most
industries said there was little or no wage pressure.”
Here’s a good habit to get into so you can capitalize on knowledge from one
area of the market as you apply it to another: After the initial headlines and
market reactions, I like to read through the report on the Internet. You can
find links to it on the Fed’s Web site, www.federalreserve.gov, or you can
do a Google or Yahoo! search for “Beige Book.”
What I look for when I scan the full text on the Web is what the Beige Book
says about individual sectors of the economy. Under manufacturing in April
2005, the Beige Book said that although little pickup was reported in the
growth for electronics, slightly rising demand was noted for networking
switches and other related products in telecommunications.
If you see something like that, you can start looking at the action of key
stocks in that sector. Interestingly, the stock of Cisco Systems, the leader in
switches and related products, made a good bottom in the month of April,
and on April 21, a day after the Beige Book was released, it began to rally. By
May 20, the stock was up 13.26 percent.
The Beige Book usually is released in the afternoon, one or two hours before
the stock market closes. The overall trend of all markets can reverse late in
the day when the data in the report surprise traders.
Homing in on housing starts
Bond and stock traders like housing starts, because housing is a central por-
tion of the U.S. economy, given its dependence on credit and the fact that it
uses raw materials and provides employment for a significant number of
people in related industries, such as banking, the mortgage sector, construc-
tion, manufacturing, and real-estate brokerage.
Big moves often occur in the bond market after the numbers for housing
starts are released.
103
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

Released every month, housing starts are compiled by the U.S. Commerce
Department and reported in three parts:
 Building permits
 Housing starts
 Housing completions
The markets focus on the percentage of rise or fall in the numbers from the
previous month for each component.
For example, the April 2005 report showed a 5.3 percent growth in the
number of building permits, an 11 percent growth in housing starts (with a
6.3 percent growth in single-family homes), and a 3.4 percent growth rate in
housing completions.
A volatile series of numbers, this data can be greatly affected by weather, so
it is also seasonally adjusted and includes a significant amount of revised
data within each of the internal components.
For example, when winter arrives, snow storms and cold weather tend to halt
or slow new and ongoing construction projects, so housing permits and hous-
ing starts can start to decline. If you don’t know that, you can make trading
mistakes by betting that interest rates are going to fall. The problem comes
when the weather clears, and the projects get underway, and the numbers
swell. Markets look at the seasonally adjusted numbers, which are smoothed
out by statistical formulas used by the U.S. Department of Commerce.
Even then, this set of numbers is tricky. The Commerce Department dis-
claimer notes that it can take up to four months of data to come up with a
reliable set of indicators.
Staying Awake for the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators
The Conference Board looks at ten key indicators in calculating its Index of
Leading Economic Indicators. Included are the
 Index of consumer expectations
 Real money supply
 Interest-rate spread
 Stock prices
104
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

 Vendor performance
 Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance
 Building permits
 Average weekly manufacturing hours
 Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods
 Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods and materials
In April 2005, the overall index dropped and so did much of the economic
data for that month. At the same time, the trend of economic growth
remained up, once again confirming the notion that interest rate increases
ordered by the Federal Reserve were starting to slow down the economy, but
they weren’t dragging it into a recession.
The Index of Leading Economic Indicators is another lukewarm indicator that
sometimes moves the markets and other times doesn’t. It is more likely to
move the markets whenever it clearly is divergent from data provided by
other indicators. For example, if in April, the leading indicators were showing
a drastic decline, the markets would start worrying about a recession loom-
ing on the horizon. That, in turn, may be a catalyst to knock down stock and
commodity prices and the value of the dollar, but on the other hand, it may
bring about a huge rally in the bond markets.
Grossing out with Gross Domestic 
Product (GDP)
The report on Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measures the sum of all the
goods and services produced in the United States. Although GDP can yield
confusing and mixed results on the trading floor, it sometimes is a big market
mover whenever it’s far above or below what the markets are expecting it to
be. At other times, GDP is not much of a mover. Multiple revisions of previous
GDP data accompany the monthly release of the GDP and tend to dampen the
effect of the report. Although the GDP is not a report to ignore, by any means,
it usually isn’t as important as the PPI and CPI and the employment report.
GDP has a component called the deflator, which is a measure of inflation.
The deflator can be the prime mover whenever it is above or below market
expectations.
Getting slick with oil supply data
Oil supply data became a central report outside of the oil markets in 2004
and 2005 as the price of crude oil soared to record highs after the war in Iraq.
105
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

The Energy Information Agency (EIA), a part of the U.S. Department of
Energy, and the American Petroleum Institute (API) release oil supply data for
the previous week at 10:30 a.m. eastern time every Wednesday.
Traders want to know the following:
 Crude oil supply
 Gasoline supply
 Distillate supply
A build is when the stockpiles of crude oil in storage are increasing. Such
increases are considered bearish or negative for the market, because large
stockpiles generally mean lower prices at the pump. A drawdown, on the
other hand, is when the supply shrinks. Traders like drawdown situations,
because prices tend to rise after the news is released.
Every week, oil experts and commentators guess what the number will be.
Although they almost never are right in their predictions, the fact that they’re
wrong sets the market up for more volatility when the number comes out and
gives you a trading opportunity if you’re set up to take advantage of it.
A good way to set up for the oil report, or any report, is to set up an options
strategy called a straddle (see Chapter 5 for details).
A straddle gives you a chance to make money if the market rises or falls; it
essentially sets you up for any surprises. For the oil markets, you can set up
straddles on crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, or gasoline futures. You can
also set up straddles on individual oil stocks such as Valero Energy (NYSE:
VLO), which usually is a big mover on reports.
Although crude oil supply is self-explanatory as the basis for the oil markets
and is important year-round, two other supply factors are affected by these
seasonal tendencies:
 Distillate supply figures are more important in winter, because they
essentially represent a measure of the supply of heating oil.
 Gasoline supplies are more important as the summer driving season
approaches.
Other holidays sometimes can affect oil supply numbers. The market tends
to factor their effect into the numbers, though, so for other holidays to have
a big effect on trading, the surprises have to be very big.
106
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

The market has changed, however, because of problems with refinery capac-
ity in the U.S. and the aftereffects of two major hurricanes (Katrina and Rita)
in 2005 in the Gulf of Mexico region. Volatility in the markets and supply num-
bers will evolve over the next few years. See Chapter 13 for a full rundown of
the energy markets.
CNBC covers the oil supply release number. Sometimes, the reporter gets the
gist of the data wrong, and the market can be increasingly volatile because of
it. Although this scenario is not frequent, I’ve seen it happen, and I have seen
it have an effect on trading.
Enduring sales, income, production,
and balance of trade reports
The hodgepodge of data that trickle out of the woodwork throughout the
month about retail sales, personal income, industrial production, and the bal-
ance of trade sometimes causes a bit of commotion in the futures markets,
but these individual reports mostly cause only a few daily ripples, unless, of
course, the effect of the data is dramatic.
As a futures and options trader, you need to know that these reports are
coming, but a good portion of the time, they come and go without fanfare or
trouble, unless the economy is at a critical turning point and one of these
reports happens to be the missing piece to the puzzle.
Of these four reports, the one most likely to get the most press is the balance
of trade report. Because the Chinese economy is getting so much attention
these days, the currency and bond markets may move dramatically whenever
the balance of trade report shows a much greater than expected trade deficit
or trade surplus. If several consecutive reports show that the United States is
reversing its trend toward more imports than exports, you may see a major
set of moves in the futures markets.
The prices for imports also are an important factor in the trade data that can
be a sign of inflation and, again, can affect how the Federal Reserve moves on
interest rates.
Trading the Big Reports
The greatest effect that each of the reports highlighted in this chapter can
have is on the futures and related options markets associated with bonds,
stock indexes, and currencies. Thus, the best strategies for trading based on
these reports are found in those markets.
107
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

Any report can make the market move up or down if the market finds some-
thing in the report to justify the move, but some general tendencies to keep
in mind include the following:
 Reports that show a strengthening economy are less friendly to the bond
market and tend to be friendlier toward stock-index futures and the dollar.
Although this isn’t a hard and fast rule, as always, trade what’s happening,
not what you think ought to happen (see Chapters 10, 11, and 12).
 Signs of slowing growth or a weak economy tend to be bullish, or positive,
for bonds and less friendly toward stock indexes and the dollar.
 Short-term interest-rate futures, such as in Eurodollars (see Chapter 10),
may move in the opposite direction of the 10-year Treasury note (T-
note) or long-term (30-year) bond futures.
 Gold, silver, and oil markets may respond aggressively to these reports.
(To find out more about the markets in these commodities, see Chapters
13 and 14.)
 The Federal Reserve may make comments that accelerate or reverse the
reactions and responses to economic reports.
Making It Easy on Yourself: Straddle
Futures and options traders can set up complicated strategies in advance of
the release of a big economic report, but here is one that is simple to execute
that can be very profitable, if you set it up correctly.
You can, for example, set up a straddle, which means that you buy both a call,
which gives you an opportunity to profit if the market rises, and a put, which
gives you an opportunity to profit if the market falls (see Chapter 5 for details
on setting up straddles), on the front contract, which is the most active and
frequently quoted futures contract at any given moment. After establishing
the straddle, you then can sell the option (put or call) that’s on the wrong
side of the report.
The market will respond when it’s surprised by a report. When the report
is released and the market responds, you can participate in the move with
a defined amount of risk, based on the way you set up your straddle —
compared to what you can lose if you played the futures markets directly
or you owned individual stocks that responded to the report.
For example, if the market decides that a higher-than-expected consumer
price index was not necessarily inflationary, bond prices may actually rise
and interest rates would fall.
108
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Looking at two scenarios, you can compare what would happen if you owned
a short position on T-note futures or a straddle on T-note futures.
If you had the short position in T-note futures, you are betting that T-note
futures prices will fall in response to the economic report. In this case, how-
ever, the bond market actually goes up. That means that you will lose money
because you own a short position.
If, on the other hand, you set up a straddle, you’d be in a better position,
because a straddle has two components:
 A call that lets you profit when the underlying asset goes up in price
 A put that lets you profit when the underlying asset goes down in price
All you have to do is wait for the report and the market’s response. In the
example, the correct response would be to sell the put and hold onto the call.
Timing is also important. Note that waiting until the day before an important
report is released will typically result in some pretty horrible pricing for the
straddle. Option sellers are also aware of the report’s scheduled release, and
they raise the implied volatility on the options that they sell. The trick is to
find options whose implied volatility does not reflect the buyer’s anticipated
statistical/price volatility that will result from the data/report’s release.
Some of the factors to consider when setting up your strategy are that you can
 Establish your straddle at least a day before the release of the data.
You can do it at the close of regular trading, or by using Globex in the
overnight session. If you own a call option and a put option on the U.S.
10-year T-note futures, the call will likely rise in price as the put falls
when the market responds to the CPI report. As the put falls, you can
sell it (and take your loss) and review your choices of how to capitalize
on the opportunity provided by the call.
 Build multiple strategies simultaneously. Because long- and short-term
interest rates can move in opposite directions in response to news from
economic reports, you can build other strategies (in addition to your T-
note straddle) by using other options and contracts to build another
straddle using Eurodollars, which are short-term interest-rate instru-
ments. The T-note straddle is a long-term interest play. If you set up a
straddle for T-bills or Eurodollars, you’re setting up a play on short-term
interest rates.
You can also use the same kind of straddle strategy in the currency mar-
kets for the same trade, although doing so may be a bit more difficult
than hedging your bets in the interest-rate and stock-index contracts.
109
Chapter 6: Understanding the Fundamentals of the Economy

Time works against you in the options market. Don’t assume that you can sell
the part of the options straddle that’s going against you right away without
first considering the possibility of managing the position. You can best
accomplish that by working with the scenarios of options strategies that I
provide in Chapter 5. For example, holding onto the put option, even if the
market moves in a way that makes your call option more profitable, may be
the right thing to do. After a short period of time, the market may reverse
itself, and at that point, you can take profits on the call and see what happens
with the put.
No hard-and-fast rules exist here other than keeping your head in the game,
understanding what can happen before it does, and having a good road map
to guide your decisions.

Chapter 7
Getting Technical Without 
Getting Tense
In This Chapter
 Embracing the purpose and uses of technical analysis
 Choosing a good charting service
 Adopting specific charts and interpreting chart patterns
I
’m a visual person, and my first experience with trading came from read-
ing a chart in 1988, right before Memorial Day weekend, when I made my
first stock trade: 100 shares of Quanex Corp. (NYSE:NX), a steel pipe and tube
maker. I bought the stock somewhere around $12 and sold it at essentially the
same price in a few days after it hadn’t done much of anything. I was most
unhappy with the commissions I had to pay and the fact that the stock didn’t
do what I had expected it to do — rise substantially in price.
I bought the stock based on a chart that exhibited a cup-and-handle pattern,
a chart pattern made famous by Investor’s Business Daily founder William
O’Neil. This pattern isn’t very useful in futures trading, but it can be helpful in
trading stocks. It shows up when a stock forms a rounded base and then
trades sideways in a narrow range, giving the appearance or impression of a
cup and a handle.
In my first trade, I identified such a pattern, from an Investor’s Business Daily
chart. I was lucky. My first stock trade cost me only a hundred bucks, and I
had enough money left to keep on trading. But that failure within my small
account — breaking even and paying a $50 commission on the purchase and
the sale — is what prompted me to find out more about charts and how they
work together with the fundamentals of the markets.
What I didn’t realize at the time was that Quanex had only recently come out
of some major difficulties and was restructuring. A longer-term view of the chart
would’ve revealed that trading was volatile and that the stock was, in fact,
stuck in a trading range and not in a significant up or down or breakout trend.

I also discovered that I didn’t know anything about the state of the steel indus-
try at the time, the company’s management, or its plans for the future. All are
important when trading futures, options, and their underlying equities.
My mistake was that the cup-and-handle pattern, although genuine, was only
a snapshot of the trading action over a few months. Had I known better — as
I do now — I would’ve looked at a multiyear chart, and put the cup-and-handle
pattern from the newspaper in its proper context.
The major lesson that I brought home during that relatively traumatic experi-
ence was that a chart pattern is nothing more than a chart pattern. In essence,
it’s only a beginning. Although you can’t be a great futures trader without under-
standing and using technical analysis, aside from its key role in decision-
making, it’s also a tool that leads you toward exploring more information
about why the pattern suggests that you need to buy, sell, or sell short the
underlying instrument. See Chapters 8 and 12 for speculating strategies and
using technical analysis for trading stock index futures.
In this chapter, I introduce you to the basics of recognizing interesting chart
patterns that can lead you either to more study of the situation or to plug in
what you already know about a market that is giving you a visual signal.
Picturing a Thousand Ticks: The Purpose
of Technical Analysis
I like to think of stock or futures charts as summaries of the collective opin-
ions of all the participants in a market. In essence, a chart is a tick-by-tick his-
tory of those opinions as they evolve over time, factoring in everything that
market participants know, think they know, and expect to happen with regard
to the asset for which the chart was compiled.
And although a picture is worth a thousand words to most people, to a
trader, a chart is worth a chance to make some money. Technical analysis, or
the use of price charts, moving averages, trend lines, volume relationships,
and indicators for identifying trends and trading opportunities in underlying
financial instruments, is the key to success in the futures and options mar-
kets. The more you know about reading charts, the better your trading
results are likely to be.
After you become better acquainted with the basic drivers and influences of
a particular market and how that information — key market moving reports,
the major players involved, and the general fundamentals of supply and
demand — fits into the big picture of the marketplace in general, the next log-
ical step is to become acquainted with how the fundamentals are combined
with the data that is compiled in price charts.
112
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

By becoming proficient at reading the charts of various security prices, you
gain quick access to significant amounts of information, such as prices, gen-
eral trends, and info about whether a market is sold out and ready to rally or
overbought, meaning few buyers are left and prices can fall. By combining
your knowledge of the markets and trading experiences with excellent chart-
ing skills, you vastly improve your market reaction time and your ability to
make informed trades.
Technical analysis takes into account so much data and methodology that I
can’t possibly cover everything about it in only one chapter. So here are a few
recommendations of excellent books in which you can find useful information
as you progress with chart reading and trading. This list by no means is com-
prehensive, but these references serve as great supplements to this chapter.
The books are not named in any particular order, because each has something
good to offer and can serve you in different ways at different times:
 Technical Analysis For Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley)
 Trading For Dummies by Michael Griffis and Lita Epstein (Wiley)
 Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets by John J. Murphy (New York
Institute of Finance)
 Candlestick Charting Explained: Timeless Techniques for Trading Stocks
and Futures by Gregory L. Morris (McGraw-Hill)
By reading the information in Futures & Options For Dummies and the books
in the preceding list, you can build a foundation for technical analysis.
However, as you gain trading experience, technical analysis will become more
of an individualized endeavor for you, because you’ll find that you gravitate
to some areas more than others.
My own experience is that the simpler the analysis, the better, so my analyti-
cal style relies on moving averages, trend lines, and a few oscillators and indi-
cators. Your style will develop as you learn more.
These guidelines can help organize your expectations about reading charts:
 Charting, in my opinion, isn’t meant to replace fundamental analysis. In
my trading, charts are meant to complement and enhance it, enabling
you to make better decisions. That’s not to say that there aren’t those
very talented people out there who make millions as pure chartists,
because there are. Just keep an open mind on this.
 Understanding the fundamentals of supply and demand in your particular
segment of the market is necessary for you to be able to trade futures and
options based on charted technical signals. Knowing the fundamentals and
the technical analysis makes investing your hard-earned money easier.
 Becoming familiar with more than one set of indicators and being able to
combine them gives you more than one perspective from which to view
113
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

the markets. I use different combinations of indicators for different types
of trading to find more ways of looking at the markets. Narrow-minded
traders don’t go too far.
 Learning the basics of following moving averages, identifying trend
reversals, and drawing trend lines is important so you can add new
layers of analysis, such as moving average crossover systems, Fibonacci
retracements, and other more sophisticated techniques as you gain
more experience. I discuss them all in this chapter.
 Continuing to expand your knowledge of technical analysis is important.
You can do so by reading books and magazines like Technical Analysis of
Stocks & Commodities and Active Trader magazine, which are excellent
sources of interesting articles. Investor’s Business Daily, either the print
or the digital version of the paper on its Web site, is a chart reader’s par-
adise for stock and futures traders.
 Exercising care so that you avoid clutter in your charts, even as you
become more sophisticated in your approach to trading futures and
options, is important. The simpler your charts, the better the picture
you get and the better your decisions will be.
First Things First: Getting 
a Good Charting Service
You need a reliable charting service — a provider of quotes, charts, and
market data — either one that your broker provides or an independent one
such as Barchart.com, and you need a reliable set of software tools to be able
to trade well. Many such services, programs, and combinations of the two are
available. Some online trading houses offer a range of services, from bare-
bones to sophisticated charting modules, on their respective Web sites.
Charting and quote services come in different packages. They start at bare
minimum with basic charts and indicators and work their way up to very
complex systems used by professionals.
Some brokers charge you extra for using their in-house, more sophisticated
charting and software services, but others let you use them as part of a pack-
age deal, especially if you’re an active trader placing trades through the spon-
soring trading house. Extra charges vary, but a difference of $30 to $40 per
month between the low end and the high end are not uncommon. You need
to check with each individual service before deciding on a charting service.
No matter what, you’re obligated to pay exchange fees to get real-time quotes
from the exchanges, and those fees can add up to hundreds of dollars per
month, depending on the number of exchanges from which you get quotes.
114
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

A good way to start is with a bare-bones charting system or the next step up.
You can move up to progressively more elaborate systems as your trading
skills become more sophisticated.
Software and charting services are available as downloads or as individually
boxed packages that are Web ready.
Here are the characteristics that a charting service/online brokerage must have:
 Reliability: The service must be up and running when you want to place
trades, and the data it provides must be accurate. If your service tells
you to come back later because it’s unavailable anytime when the mar-
kets are open — in other words, during peak trading times — you need
to quit the unreliable service, demand a refund, and find another more
reliable service. A good way to know whether a service is reliable is to
find user’s groups online or in your town and read their bulletin boards,
or you can attend a meeting or two and listen to any complaints. You
also need to sign up for a trial period so you can see how you like the
system before you pay for it.
 Accessibility: The service needs to be available to you virtually any-
where, either online or by the use of a convenient online interface. You
need to be able to check your quotes, open positions, and make your
decisions from home, work, or elsewhere — even on your laptop at the
airport.
 Support: Make sure that the service offers a toll-free telephone number
to call for support and that it provides online support. Call the toll-free
number before you purchase the software, just to test the availability of
support. If your software malfunctions and you have to wait 30 minutes
before talking to anyone, think about what effect that kind of a delay
may have on your investments, especially if you’re trying to place a
trade when a big economic release is moving the markets.
 Charting tools: The charts provided by your charting service must be
easy to read and user-friendly. You shouldn’t have to punch five or ten
keys or toggle your mouse for ten minutes while trying to make your
chart look right. Sure, you can expect a learning curve with most pro-
grams, but if you can’t make the software do what you want (and what
the provider says it will do) after a few days, it isn’t the right setup for
you, and you need to consider getting a new program.
 Real-time quotes: Trading futures without real-time quotes is a sure path
down the road to ruin. Real-time quotes are up-to-the-minute market
prices, as they happen. They provide you with up-to-the-minute pricing
for your particular security, futures contract, or option, thus enabling
you to make timely decisions. Without them, the prices you get from
your charting service may be subject to a standard 20-minute delay,
during which markets can move to their limits (or even reverse course),
leaving you faced with a margin call.
115
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

 Live charts: If you’re going to trade, you need access to live charts that
actually change with every tick (up or down movement) of the market.
You can set them up to update the bars or candlesticks in your charts
over a broad range of different time frames. The key: You want your chart
to be updated to reflect the direction in which the market is trading.
 Time-frame analysis: Make sure that your charting service enables you
to produce intraday charts. You want to be able to look at different time
frames simultaneously. For example, if the long-term trend in the S&P
futures is headed up on a six-month chart, but you see that a top is
building on your intraday chart, your strategy for your S&P 500 Index
fund may not be affected. But if you have two S&P 500 long contracts
open and a few call options, you may need to adjust the strategies on
your futures positions. For example, you may want to consider moving a
sell stop closer to the current price if you’re concerned about remaining
in the position. Or you may want to sell the position outright.
 Multiple indicators: Make sure that the service to which you subscribe
lets you plot price charts and multiple indicators at the same time. A
standard page may include prices, a combination of moving averages,
stochastics, and MACD and RSI oscillators. I go into more details on
these indicators, and how to use them, in Chapter 8. Chapter 13 features
a great example of how to use RSI in the energy markets. But for now,
you need to concentrate on the charting information you need for tech-
nical analysis.
Some charting services offer access on hand-held electronic devices. This
feature may be attractive to you if you’re on the road and have open posi-
tions. Don’t trade and drive, though.
You can get a pretty good preview of a good, basic, real-time charting pro-
gram online at currency brokerage Xpresstrade.com: www.xpresstrade.com/
forex_charts.html. This set of pages gives you free access to real-time
quotes in the currency markets and provides a good overview of several
levels of charting that are available. You can sample many free currency
charts on this site, which also offers trading software. In general, this site is a
good place to get your feet wet and to make use of some of the concepts in
this chapter as they apply to the currency markets. The basic charting princi-
ples that you discover in one market are easily applicable to other markets.
Stockcharts.com (www.stockcharts.com) has an excellent free Java charting
system on which you can practice drawing trend lines and analyzing charts.
Deciding What Types of Charts to Use
Security analysis relies on these four basic types of charts: line charts, bar
charts, candlestick charts, and point-and-figure charts. Line charts almost
116
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

never are used in trading. Bar and candlestick charts commonly are used in
stocks and futures trading, and point-and-figure charts have a smaller but
loyal following as trading tools.
I don’t use point-and-figure charts, so I won’t include them in this discussion.
However, for a nice short overview of point-and-figure charting, check out
Technical Analysis For Dummies (Wiley). If you like what you read there and
want even more information about it, I also recommend John Murphy’s
Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets (New York Institute of Finance).
In general, I concentrate on bar and candlestick charting, but the bulk of my
explanation in this chapter is based on candlestick charts, because they’re
the most commonly used charts in futures trading, and they offer the best
information for shorter holding periods (like the ones common to day trad-
ing) or for longer trading periods where you have open positions that you
may stay with for a few days.
Confused? Don’t be. Both types of price charts are useful, and you’ll develop
your own style and preferences for the ones that work best for you. At this
point, however, you merely need to be aware of what these charts are, how to
recognize them, and how you can start thinking about putting them to use.
Bar charts are made up of thin single bars that define the movement of a price
over a period of time. You can use one for analyzing a longer period of the
market. I like them for this purpose because they’re a bit less cluttered.
Candlestick charts, on the other hand, are made up of thin- and thick-bodied
candles, such as in Figure 7-1, which explains why they basically look like can-
dles with wicks at both ends. Figure 7-3, on the other hand, shows how you
can incorporate candlestick patterns with key indicators, such as moving
averages and oscillators. Both sets of charts offer the same basic kind of
information — price, volume, and general direction of the market.
Stacking up bar charts
Bar charts used to be the most commonly displayed charts on most trading
software programs. The bars displayed low and high prices for the specific
time frame of the chart, with the body of the bar representing the range of
trading action during that time frame. The time frame of a bar chart can be
set according to whatever time period the user wants to use, regardless of
whether it’s for part of a day, a day, a week, a month, a year, or longer.
No hard-and-fast rules govern whether one type of chart is better than
another. For example, bar charts and candlestick charts can be used for trad-
ing during any time span that you like, whether day trading or trading inter-
mediate-term positions in which you stay with the underlying asset as long as
the trend remains in your favor.
117
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

I prefer to use candlestick charts for intraday charts, because the color tells
me what I want to know rapidly. For longer-term charts from which I just
want to get the big picture about whether I want to buy or sell the underlying
asset, I tend to use bar charts. The best thing to do is work with both kinds of
charts when you are a beginner and develop your own tendencies.
Bar charts are useful when
 You’re looking for a quick snapshot of a particular instrument, sector, or
market, or when you’re doing basic trend analysis.
 You’re trading individual stocks or mutual funds, and you’re looking at a
long-term chart, such as a five-year time span.
Weighing the benefits 
of candlestick charts
Candlestick charts provide the same sort of information as bar charts, but
they’re better for making trading decisions, because they take the guesswork
out of the overall trend in the underlying contract by the use of color coding.
They’re especially suited for the short-term trading that’s common in the
futures markets.
Candlestick charts can be broken down into several parts, including the 
following:
 Real body: The real body is the box between the opening and closing
prices depicted by the candlestick. The body can be white or black. White
bodies are bullish, meaning that the price depicted is rising. Black bodies
are bearish, meaning that the price depicted by the candlestick is falling.
 Lower and upper shadows: The thin lines that extend above and below
the real body (the candlewicks) are the lower and upper shadows. The
shadows, or wicks, extend to the high and low prices for the time frame.
Figure 7-1 summarizes the basic anatomy of candlestick charting.
Although bearish candlesticks traditionally are solid black, many software
programs and charting services have replaced the black color with red to
correspond with the standard method of displaying falling prices on quote
systems. They’ve also replaced normally white bullish candlesticks with
green ones, again to conform with the quote systems standards. In fact, many
software programs will even let you decide which color you want to use for
bullish or bearish charts. In this chapter, though, green and white refer to
bullish conditions, and red and black mean bearish.
118
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

When a candlestick has no body but only vertical and horizontal shadows,
meaning that it is a line with no box, it forms what is known as a doji pattern.
Doji patterns are a sign of indecision in the market. The three types of doji
patterns (see Figure 7-2) are
 Plain: A plain doji looks like a cross and may just be a sign of a short-term
pause. Other kinds of doji bars can be important signs of a trend reversal.
 Dragonfly: A dragonfly doji has a long lower shadow, or single-line body —
the dragonfly appears to be flying upward. If you see this kind of pattern, it
means that sellers were not successful in closing the contract at the lows
of the day. When that happens as the price is bottoming out, it can mean
that buyers are gaining an upper hand. If a dragonfly doji occurs after a big
rally, it can mean that buyers are not able to take prices any higher.
 Gravestone: A gravestone doji looks like an upside-down dragonfly, with
a longer upper shadow — the dragonfly appears to be flying downward.
Gravestone dojis occur when buyers push prices higher but can’t get
prices to close at those higher levels. If a gravestone doji appears after a
rally, it can signal that a reversal is coming.
On the other hand, a gravestone doji in a downtrend may mean that a
bottom is forming.

Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

Barbara Rockefeller points out in Technical Analysis For Dummies that a doji
is best interpreted in the context of the pattern that you see in the preceding
candlesticks.
Here is why candlesticks can be superior to bar charts:
 Trends are easier to spot. For example, a sea of rising green (or white),
meaning a large grouping of bullish candles on a candlestick chart, is
hard to mistake for anything other than a strong uptrend. Because can-
dlesticks tend to have a body in most cases, the overall trend of the
market often is easier to identify.
 Trend changes are easier to spot. Candlestick patterns can be dramatic
and can help you identify trend changes before you can recognize them
on bar charts. Some candlestick patterns are reliable at predicting future
prices.
 Shifts in momentum are as easy to spot. Conditions in which a security
is oversold and overbought, along with trends and other kinds of indica-
tors, may be easier to spot on candlestick charts than on bar charts
because of the presence of doji candles and color. For example, an
engulfing pattern (see Figures 7-3 and 7-6 and the “Engulfing the trend”
section, later in this chapter), which can be either negative or positive,
is easier to spot in a candlestick chart.
Candlestick bars that are changing in size, especially at the end of a market
run in a single direction, often are a sign that traders have reached an impor-
tant point in how they’re looking at the market and that an important end
point may have been reached. For example, a long green (white) bar after a
big rally often means that buyers are out of gas, and that’s when you need to
start paying attention to other signs of weakness. The same can be said after
a long red (black) bar that follows a major bout of selling — you can start
looking for signs of strength.
Getting the Hang of Basic 
Charting Patterns
Charting patterns can get out of control if you’re not careful, so I like to keep
it simple. That means that if you understand the basic tenets of charting and
the most important, easy-to-spot patterns, you can make solid trading deci-
sions as long as you remember that charting is most useful to you when you
couple it with fundamental and situational analysis of the markets.
120
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

So before you start looking for patterns, follow this three-step rule:
1. Get the feel for whether the basic trend is up or down.
Just look at the chart. If the price starts low and rises, it’s an uptrend. If
the opposite is true, it’s a downtrend.
2. Gauge how long that trend has been in place.
Using longer-term charts sometimes can help you spot just how long the
trend has been in place.
3. Consider the potential for a reversal.
The longer the trend has been in place, the higher the chance that it can
turn the other way.
After you get comfortable with this process, you can advance to looking for
the charting patterns that I describe in the sections that follow.
Analyzing textbook base patterns
Bases, whether tops or bottoms, are sideways patterns on price charts;
they’re pauses in the uptrends or downtrends in security prices. Bases are
formed as some traders take profits and other traders establish new posi-
tions in the other direction. 
In futures markets, someone always buys, and someone always sells. So a
base is what happens when the number of buyers and sellers is in fairly good
balance and prices remain steady.
Bases, in general, are points in the pricing of a security at which the market
takes a break before deciding what to do next. A base can come before the
market turns up or down, and it can last for a long time, even years. If after it
forms a base, the market decides that more selling is called for, a new down-
turn, or falling prices, can start on a candlestick chart, despite the fact that
the market has based after a decline. When the base forms after a rally, it can
either resolve as a top, and the market can fall, or indicate only a pause in a
continuing uptrend. You can’t, however, predict with full certainty which way
the markets will break after they pause (in either direction).
Figure 7-4 (later in this chapter) shows some key technical terms, including
price tops and bottoms and basing patterns.
121
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

A base and a bottom accomplish the same thing, except that they can occur at
different places. A base can be seen after the market climbs, after the market
falls, or even during an uptrend or downtrend. A bottom usually is seen in ret-
rospect, after the market rallies from the basing pattern. Similarly, a top usu-
ally is seen in retrospect, after the market declines from a basing pattern.
Although you can’t predict tops and bottoms with 100-percent certainty,
some reliable indicators can help you make better guesses than without
them. Some reliable indicators are
 Specific patterns seen in price oscillators, such as when the RSI and MACD
indicators move in different directions than the price of the security (see
Chapters 8 and 13).
 Major turns in market sentiment (see Chapter 9).
 Key price movements above and below important price areas, such as
resistance or support points (see Figure 7-4 and the section on “Using
lines of resistance and support to place buy and sell orders,” later in the
chapter).
Downtrends
Here are some important factors to remember about a base at the bottom of
a downtrend:
 A good trading bottom usually comes when everyone thinks that the
market will never rise again.
 Downtrends can die in two ways: in a major selling frenzy or over a long
period of time in which a base forms.
 At some point, all markets become oversold, and they bounce. Any such
bounce can be the beginning of a new bullish uptrend in the market.
After a long time of falling prices, you have to be ready to trade all turns
in the market, even if you get taken out as the downtrend reasserts itself.
The most important area of a chart that is making a bottom is known as sup-
port. Support is a chart point, or series of points, that puts a floor under
prices. That’s where the buyers come in.
Uptrends
Here are some important factors to remember about a base at the top of an
uptrend:
 Most participants at the top in the market are bullish, which is why three
or four failures often occur before the market breaks toward the downside.
 Downturns that follow long-term rallies tend to spiral downward for a
long time. That’s exactly what happened with the multiyear chart of the
dollar index shown Figure 7-5, later in the chapter.
122
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

 Tops are more likely to lead to reflex rallies, meaning that long-term
downtrends are likely to be more volatile than are uptrends. For short
sellers, it’s a very rough ride, no matter which market you’re trading.
The most important area of a chart that is making a top is known as resis-
tance. Resistance is a chart point, or series of points, that puts a ceiling above
prices. That’s where sellers come in.
Using lines of resistance and support 
to place buy and sell orders
Drawing lines of resistance and support for a particular market or security
(see Figure 7-4) can help you maintain your focus when placing your buy, sell,
and short-sell orders. Buy orders usually are placed above resistance lines,
and sell orders and sell-short orders are placed below support levels. One
thing you can count on in the futures markets is the disciplined way by which
traders respond to the signals, and that’s what makes technical analysis ideal
for futures trading.
Support and resistance lines define a trading range. In Figure 7-4 (later in the
chapter), the trading range is called a basing pattern, because it precedes a
breakout.
Support and resistance levels can be fluid, flowing up and down within the
trading range. When combined with a moving average (see the next section),
they provide a useful tool that indicates how market exit and entry points are
progressing in relationship to the price of the security.
Moving your average
Moving averages are lines that are formed by a series of consecutive points that
smooth out the general price trend. Moving averages are a form of a trend line.
In terms of a security’s closing price, for example, a 50-day moving average is
a line of points that represent the average of the closing prices of the security
during each of the previous 50 days of trading.
Figure 7-3 shows two classic moving averages that are frequently used in
technical analysis, the 50-day and 200-day moving averages. This particular
figure shows a bullish long-term trend in which the bond fund is trading
above the 200-day moving average and a crossover in which the price of the
bond fund began trading above the 50-day moving average, a sign that prices
were moving higher.
123
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

Moving averages come in many different types, but for illustrative purposes, 
I use these three classics:
 20 days: The 20-day moving average traditionally is thought of as a
short-term indicator.
 50 days: The 50-day moving average is considered a measure of the
intermediate-term trend of the market.
 200 days: The 200-day moving average is considered the dividing line
between long-term bull and bear markets.
As a general rule, when a market trades above its 200-day moving average,
the path of least resistance is toward higher prices; however, no hard-and-fast
rules exist. Some traders prefer to use a 21-day moving average instead of the
20-day average, while others think moving averages are useless altogether. I
personally like using them to define dominant trends in the markets but not
necessarily as guides to placing buy or sell stops.
Short-term charts, such as the charts used for day trading, where one price
bar can equal as short a period of time as 15 minutes, have moving averages
that measure minutes instead of days. The same decision rules apply, though.

Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

The exception for me is when a market has been in a major uptrend or down-
trend for an extended period, and it suddenly breaks below or above the 200-
day average, which can signal that the long-term trend in that market has
made a drastic change in the opposite direction.
Most trading software programs offer moving averages as part of their default
charting systems. You may have to adjust these moving averages to your par-
ticular trading style or delete them if you decide that you don’t like them.
The moving averages that you use in futures trading more than likely will be
defined in terms of minutes or hours — rather than days or week — depending,
of course, on the time frame you use to make your trades. Nevertheless, know-
ing the longer-term trends of the markets in which you’re trading is essential
for knowing when to make trades with the trend rather than against it. The
basic rules are the same.
You can give your position more room to maneuver by using longer-term
moving averages. In the futures markets, however, that strategy is not always
the best, because some markets are more volatile than others. If you’re using
moving-average trading methods, your best bet is to back test several differ-
ent combinations of moving averages for each specific market.
Back testing is a trading method by which you review or test your proposed
strategy over a period of time using historic charts. For example, if you want
to see how a market relates to its 20-day moving average, you can look at a
five-year chart that includes the 20-day moving average and gauge what prices
do when that market is priced above or below that average. When back testing,
you’re better off looking at many different indicators and combinations of them.
You usually can find a combination that works best for any particular market.
When you back test your strategy, you improve your chances of finding the
best combination of indicators to keep you on the right side of the trend.
Breaking out
A breakout happens when buyers overwhelm sellers and prices begin to rise.
Breakouts usually follow some kind of basing pattern, or sideways movement
in the market. A good rule is that the longer the base, the higher the likelihood
of a good move after the underlying security breaks out of its trading range.
Figure 7-4 shows a great example of a chart breakout coming out of a head-
and-shoulders pattern, a basic and easy-to-find pattern that can be found in all
markets. Notice the almost perfect head-and-shoulders bottom in the crude oil
contract marked H for the head and S for the left and right shoulders, as it
forms the basing pattern that precedes the crude-oil price breakout in text-
book fashion.
125
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

Some of the characteristics of a head-and-shoulders base are that it
 Is a common but not always reliable technical pattern. It doesn’t always
point to a breakout the way it does in Figure 7-4.
 Always is shaped like a head and shoulders. Arrows in Figure 7-4 illus-
trate how the volume drops off as the shoulders are being formed, a
textbook characteristic of the head-and-shoulders bottom. Head-and-
shoulder tops are the same formation turned upside-down. When they
happen, they can lead to a breakdown in the underlying asset.
 Indicates that any resulting breakout will take out the resistance at the
neckline of the head-and-shoulders pattern.
 Results in an increase in share volume as the price breaks out above the
head-and-shoulders bottom (see the five-pointed star in Figure 7-4). The
volume increase is another important characteristic of a chart breakout,
and it indicates that many buyers are interested in the security and that
prices are likely to go higher.
Using trading ranges to establish 
entry and exit points
Markets often trade in channels. A channel is another name for a trading
range. Figure 7-5 shows a rising or uptrending channel. The upper line defines
the top of the channel, and the lower line defines the bottom of the channel.

Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Regardless of whether the trend is up or down, channel lines can point to
great places to set trading entry and exit points for these reasons:
 The longer the channel holds in place, the more important a break
above or below it becomes for a particular market or security.
 They can indicate a multiyear bear market if the breakout occurs below
the rising channel. (That’s what happened to the dollar in the late 1990s
in Figure 7-5.)
 They can indicate that a major bottom is in place and that a bear market
has come to an end if a downtrend line is broken. (That’s what happened
to the dollar in 1985 and 2005 in Figure 7-5.)
Resistance is the opposite of support, because it’s a price point on a chart
above which prices cannot move higher. It’s also the place where sellers are
lurking and a place where breakdowns ultimately occur. A breakdown is a
point in the market when sellers overwhelm buyers and prices begin to fall. A
breakdown usually comes after a market forms a top. Figure 7-5 shows the
U.S. Dollar Index making a multiyear top. In this case, the top actually is indi-
cated by a triple top, because the dollar failed to move higher in three sepa-
rate attempts. (The numbers 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the three tops, or
failures, before the breakdown began in Figure 7-5.)
As with most definitive bases at the top of an uptrend, the crucial signal is
the failure to make a new high for the move. Note how the number 3 top is
lower than the number 2 top and then is followed by fast and furious selling.

Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

Seeing gaps and forming triangles
Gaps and triangles are two of the more common occurrences on price charts.
Each has its own meaning and importance.
Triangle, or wedge formations, can predict future price actions more reliably
than gaps, but gaps can also be useful.
The three basic triangle shapes found on price charts are
 Ascending triangles: These triangles point upward and can be good
signs of a price pattern with an upward bias (see Figure 7-5). In that
example, the Dollar Index uses the lower rising channel line as support
to build an ascending triangle. A horizontal line (above the triangle)
marks the resistance point that completes the triangle.
 Descending triangles: These triangles point downward and are the
opposite of ascending triangles, usually coming before downtrends.
 Symmetrical triangles: These triangles are symmetrical in that they
show neither an upward nor downward trend and thus are unpre-
dictable price formations.
Gaps, on the other hand, are unfilled points on price charts. They are more
frequently visible and therefore less important in the price charts of thinly
traded instruments, such as obscure futures contracts and some small
stocks. However, when they occur in more common contracts and more
heavily traded stocks, they can be much more important and have the follow-
ing effects (Figure 7-5 shows all three such gaps):
 Breakaway gaps: This gap happens when an underlying security gets
out of the gate very strongly at the start of the trading day. Breakaway
gaps often come after the release of economic indicators, such as the
monthly employment report. They are signs of a strong market.
Breakaway gaps are more meaningful when they are bigger than the
usual trading range of a security. For example, if you know that a futures
contract usually trades within a range of three point ticks and it opens
ten ticks higher or lower, the result is a major breakaway gap.
128
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

 Runaway gap: This gap occurs when a second gap appears on a price
chart in the same direction as a breakaway gap. Runaway gaps are signs
of continuing and accelerating price trends.
 Exhaustion gap: This gap is a sign that a market has run out of buyers or
sellers and indicates almost a last gasp in the market before the trend is
reversed. Some exhaustion gaps may have telltale candlestick patterns
associated with them, such as a hanging man (see the next section),
doji, or cross.
Seeing through the Haze: Common
Candlestick Patterns
Even though candlestick patterns are not 100 percent reliable, they certainly
are worth paying attention to. As you gain more and more experience, you’ll
come to know many different patterns. In this section, I concentrate on the
more common and meaningful patterns that can serve as signals that a
market is starting to reverse course.
Engulfing the trend
An engulfing pattern is what you see when the second (or next) day’s real
body, or candlestick, completely covers the prior day’s candlestick. An
engulfing pattern signals a potential reversal. Figures 7-6 and 7-3 show first a
schematic of bullish and bearish engulfing patterns (Figure 7-6) and a real-
time (Figure 7-3) engulfing pattern. Note that the body of the second candle is
larger than the first candle and that it predicts a change of the trend. The
bullish engulfing pattern predicts a trading bottom, and the bearish engulfing
pattern, a top. Action on the third day often is key to whether the pattern will
hold.
Engulfing patterns are characterized by a second-day candlestick that is
larger than, or engulfs, the first day’s candlestick. The larger candlestick pre-
dicts a potential change in the trend of the underlying security’s price. For
example, a bullish engulfing pattern usually appears at or near a trading
bottom and predicts an upturn in prices, while a bearish engulfing pattern
appears at or near the trading top and predicts a downturn in prices.
129
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

In Candlestick Charting Explained (McGraw-Hill), Greg Morris, a mutual fund
manager (PMFM funds), software designer, and an early proponent of candle-
stick charting, offers several important rules of recognition for engulfing 
patterns:
 A definite trend must be under way.
 The second-day candlestick’s body must completely engulf the prior
day’s candle. In other words, the high and low prices of the second-day
candlestick must be respectively higher and lower than the high and 
low for the previous day. Morris points out the subtleties of engulfing
patterns by indicating that if the tops and bottoms of both candlesticks
are identical, the pattern isn’t engulfing, but if one or the other are equal
and the second-day candle still engulfs the previous day’s candle on the
other end, the pattern is valid.
 The color of the first day’s candle must reflect the trend. So if prices
are trending upward, and the first candle is red, the pattern doesn’t hold.
 The second day’s candle must be the opposite color of the prevailing
trend. This rule is the corollary to the previous rule. If the first day’s
candle is red or black, showing a downtrend in prices, the second day’s
candle must be green or white.

Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Figure 7-3 (earlier in the chapter) offers a great example of a real-life engulfing
pattern that meets all criteria. Notice the following:
 The bar started out at a higher opening price, but clearly closed at a
lower level, a sign of a clear reversal.
 The engulfing bar was huge compared to the prior day.
Hammering and hanging for traders, 
not carpenters
The hammer and the hanging man also are common patterns. A hammer is a
small white candlestick with a long shadow, while a hanging man is a small
black candlestick with a long shadow (see Figure 7-7).
Making sense of these patterns is difficult, because they can appear virtually
anywhere on just about any chart. They are best used after a long series of bars
of the same color and are most reliable as indicators of a possible reversal.

131
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense

A white-body hammer that follows a long series of black bars in a downtrend
usually means that a reversal is coming. A black hanging man pattern that
appears after several white bars in an uptrend usually means that some sell-
ing and a downturn is on the way.
Seeing the harami pattern
A harami pattern is an excellent example of a reversal pattern. It forms when
a long candlestick of one color is followed by a smaller candlestick of another
color. The color of the second candle indicates which way the market is likely
to go. You can see it in a real-world example back in Figure 7-3.
The harami is an excellent pattern for indicating a trend change or pause.
The stock needs to be in a strong trend, and for the harami to be a valid pat-
tern, the second real body must form completely inside the first. The color of
the second candle needs to be the opposite of the first. Confirmation of this
pattern is recommended.
A harami pattern is most useful when a trend has been in place for some
time, like the six-week downtrend in Figure 7-3, but you need to keep close
tabs on the volume along with the candlesticks (the way I explain in the next
few paragraphs).
Say, for example, that you’ve been selling bonds (I use the exchange traded fund
TLT in this example, but it is equally applicable to bond futures) short for sev-
eral days and suppose that you’re starting to get comfortable with a downtrend
when you spot a long red (black) candle on your chart. Your initial response,
especially if you’re using bar charts, is to think that the downtrend is extending
and that you’re going to make more money in the next few days.
However, on the next day, prices reverse and close higher after other short
sellers have covered their short positions.
Although the bar for the second day is green (white), it’s nevertheless
smaller as new short sellers come into the market at the end of the day.
They’re thinking that the downtrending security is a good opportunity to ini-
tiate new short sales after missing out on the last move.
You gain a more accurate picture of the situation by looking at the volume on
the two days, as shown by the down-pointing arrow in Figure 7-3. Average
volume on the long black day followed by higher volume on the short white
day suggests that the trend is about to change, and you indeed have a harami
pattern.
132
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

The action on day three tells you whether the harami pattern will hold true
and send prices higher.
Figure 7-3 shows real-time candlestick patterns that defined the trend in the
bond market in 2005. The chart is of the Long-Term Bond Exchange-Traded
fund (TLT). The TLT is closely related to the U.S. 10-year Treasury note and
the U.S. Long Bond (30-year) futures contracts. The TLT can be traded both
long and short, and offers a good trading vehicle for investors who want to
participate in the overall trend of futures markets without actually opening
an account with a futures broker. The commission and the effort spent trad-
ing the TLT is the same as with trading any stock.
Several important technical-analysis-related points to get out of the harami
pattern in Figure 7-3 include
 The arrow shows the close correlation between the low-volume red or
down day and the higher volume up day and clearly conforms to the
rules laid out by Morris where a low-volume down day is followed by a
higher volume up day.
 Day three is an up day, confirming the trend change.
 The harami was followed by more selling until the market hit a lower
bottom.
 The MACD indicator also correctly correlated the bottom by crossing
over a few days after the harami pattern occurred.
This is a perfect example of how you can use candlestick charts and standard
indicators together to form accurate buy and sell signals.
133
Chapter 7: Getting Technical Without Getting Tense
Bears, bulls, and a bunch of crazy names
According to John Murphy’s Technical Analysis
of the Financial Markets (New York Institute of
Finance), 68 different candlestick patterns are
commonly used by futures traders. Murphy lists
8 bullish continuation patterns, 8 bearish con-
tinuation patterns, and 26 bullish and bearish
reversal patterns. Some candlestick patterns
are composed of two, three, four, and five can-
dlesticks. Some of my favorite names for pat-
terns are
 Abandoned baby
 Dark cloud cover
 Concealing swallow
 Three white soldiers

nexperienced investors tend to ignore the value of a good understanding
of technical analysis. That ignorance, on the part of those who ignore
charting, is, of course, bliss for traders like you (and me), because it gives
you an advantage, albeit a small one, in light of the fact that the big guys with
the big money are all chartists, and most of them are excellent at the craft.
Bob Woodward, in his book about Alan Greenspan, aptly entitled Maestro
(Simon & Schuster), describes how the chairman of the Federal Reserve has
one of the best technical charting data arrays in the world and is an avid
watcher of the financial markets using charts.
Good friends of mine in the business tell me about employees of the Federal
Reserve they’ve taught as students at technical analysis seminars.
The truth is that any good speculator with an ounce of honesty will tell you
that they rely as much on their charts as they do on information gathered by
other means.
The true money-making trader uses both fundamental and technical analy-
ses. To be sure, analyzing the futures and options markets is both an art and
a science and just a little bit of cooking, like when you add that extra salt and
pepper to a pot of chili.
The bottom line is that your trading will be enhanced when you apply what
you know about the economy and the markets to your charts. And in this
chapter, I put together several topics from the fundamental and technical
worlds to help you do just that.

Using Indicators to Make 
Good Trading Decisions
Indicators are instruments that help you confirm what you see when you look
at a chart. They are an intrinsic part of trading if you use technical analysis.
Graphs produced by the indicators are displayed along with the prices of the
underlying asset on the same chart. The indicators are derived from formulas
whose components include the price of the underlying asset.
The more common ones are known as moving averages, oscillators, channels
(of which there are several kinds), and trend lines. These indicators are part
of most price charts in the futures markets (see Figure 8-1).
Making good use of moving averages
A moving average is a series of points that enable you to determine which
way a major trend is moving within a market and whether your trade is with
or against the trend (see Chapter 7). Long-term charts use days and weeks
for moving averages. Short-term, intraday (within the same trading day)
charts use minutes to create moving averages. Generally speaking, moving
averages are useful tools because
 Markets trade higher when prices are consistently above the moving
average.
 When markets cross over a moving average in one direction or the other
(above or below), you need to be mindful of a potential change or shift
in the existing trend.
 The longer the moving average, the more important the trend and trend
reversals become. For example, when the dollar crosses above its 200-
day moving average, the chance that the trend has changed from a falling
market to one that’s about to rise is greater than when it crosses a 50-day
moving average.
 Trading by using only moving averages is risky business. Market prices
can jump above and below them many times before actually starting a
new trend or continuing an old one. Prices repeatedly jumping above or
below a moving average during a short period of time are a great exam-
ple of a whipsaw. Whipsaws can occur when you use extremely short-
term moving averages or even when you use long-term moving averages
(like the 200-day moving average).
Comparing multiple moving averages of varying lengths (20, 50, and 200
days) with the daily price for an instrument enables traders to find important
breakout and crossover points that they use to formulate their trading plans.
Figure 8-1 compares these key data from June 2004 to June 2005 with that of
136
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

the euro currency. Note how in October 2004 the value of the euro rallied
above its 20- and 50-day moving averages and how the 20-day moving average
of the euro moved above its 50-day moving average, creating a bullish
crossover. A bullish crossover is an episode in which a shorter-length moving
average crosses above a longer-term moving average, which usually is good
confirmation of a rising trend and a signal to buy the underlying asset. A bear-
ish crossover is the opposite, when a shorter-length moving average falls
below a longer-term moving average. It usually confirms a falling trend. Figure
8-3 also highlights a bearish crossover.
A good trading technique is to buy a small stake in a market when a bullish
crossover occurs. That’s what you see labeled as “buy point 1” in Figure 8-1.
You can see that the euro moved sideways for a bit longer and then broke
out; that’s “buy point 2” in Figure 8-1.
The buy signal held true, and the euro’s rally stayed alive until the bearish
crossover occurred and the euro fell below both its 20-day and 50-day
moving averages in January 2005.
Figure 8-1 is important because the chart points to a significant amount of
information about the value of the euro, including the following:
 Downtrends: When the euro traded below its 20-, 50-, and 200-day
moving averages, it progressed through short-, intermediate-, and long-
term downtrends.
 A negative crossover: When both the 20- and 50-day moving averages
crossed below the 200-day moving average, the resulting negative
crossover confirmed a long-term downtrend.

 A positive crossover: When the 20-day moving average crossed above
the 50-day moving average, the resulting positive crossover confirmed
an uptrend.
 A sustained uptrend: The rally in the euro that followed the positive
crossover points to a sustained uptrend.
Understanding and using oscillators
Oscillators are mathematical equations that are graphed onto price charts 
so you can more easily decide whether the price action is a correction in an
ongoing trend or a change in the overall trend. Oscillators usually are graphed
above or below the price charts.
Several oscillators are commonly used by traders. In this section, I show you
two of them, the MACD and stochastic oscillators, in detail. Discovering the
basics of these two oscillators will enable you to easily understand the rest of
them, because they all share the same characteristics.
Biting into a Big Mac without special sauce: MACD
The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is the result of a formula
that’s based on three moving averages derived from the price of the underly-
ing asset. When applied to the asset prices, the MACD formula smoothes out
fluctuations of that asset. For example, in Figure 8-1, the MACD is smoothing
out three moving averages based on the price of the euro. The software pro-
vided by your charting service will help you to display MACD oscillators
based either on your own trading criteria or the software’s default criteria.
The MACD data shown in Figure 8-1 are displayed as a histogram. An MACD
oscillator that’s moving up usually is considered a bullish development, con-
firming that an uptrend has been well established when it actually crosses
above the zero line.
On the left side of the MACD oscillator chart, note how the line under the
MACD slopes higher, while the line under the price of the euro on the index
chart above it is flat. The sloping MACD means the oscillator established a
higher low, even though the price remained flat, which is called positive diver-
gence. Although prices did not rise, the positive divergence points to selling
momentum that is less than it was during the previous low on the MACD
oscillator, and that’s a signal that prices may be getting ready to rise. In
Figure 8-1, the MACD oscillator was right.
In November, however, a turnaround occurred as the MACD histogram rolled
over. The price of the euro continued to rise, but the MACD provided a non-
confirmation signal, meaning that its overall direction was now lower. Note
how the line above prices is on the rise from late November through early
138
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

January, but the second peak on the MACD is lower than the first. This diver-
gence is a sign that buyers are getting tired and that prices may be getting
ready to fall. And again, Figure 8-1 shows the MACD was right.
Taking stock with stochastics
Stochastic oscillators indicate classic overbought and oversold situations in
the markets. An overbought market occurs when prices have been in a rising
trend for a long time and buyers are starting to get tired. An oversold market
is just the opposite; sellers are getting tired as prices are trending down.
Whenever either of these situations occurs, as a trader, you need to know
whether your position is in danger of getting caught in a trend change.
Markets can remain in overbought or oversold conditions for short or long
periods of time before the trend changes. A four-month rally in the euro
during the fall of 2004 was overbought for a long time based on stochastic
oscillator analysis. So if you had sold based on this indicator alone, you
would’ve missed out on making a lot of money. In fact, looking at Figure 8-1,
you can see that the stochastic indicator showed the market was overbought
when the breakout occurred at buy point 2. Without the crossover and MACD
indicators for backup, you would’ve sold way too early.
Thus, like any indicator, stochastics need to be used in combination with
other indicators. Figure 8-1 shows how you can combine MACD, stochastics,
and moving-average crossovers to execute your trading plan most efficiently.
I use stochastic indicators as an early warning system. When stochastics
signal overbought or oversold markets, I take it to mean that I should start
paying close attention to my other indicators, such as MACD and moving
averages.
Note in Figure 8-1 that before the rally, the second low on the stochastic indi-
cator was higher than the first, just like the pair of lows on the MACD, thus
providing confirmation of the MACD data by the stochastics, which also ulti-
mately turned out to be correct.
The trend became clear in January when the stochastic oscillator indicated
the market was oversold. The second low was lower than the first, correctly
indicating a negative situation in which the euro fell to a lower low soon after
the lower low was reached on the stochastic oscillator.
By using moving averages and two simple oscillators, you could’ve easily
traded those profitable moves in the euro on the long and the short sides.
When watching moving averages and oscillators together, use minute-based
moving averages for shorter-term trading. The method is the same except that
you’re reading the pricing data in a different, shorter, time frame. You may
want to give yourself another layer of information to confirm the shorter-term
data by looking for key reversal patterns on candlestick charts.

Getting relative (not jiggy) with RSI
The RSI (Relative Strength Indicator) was developed by Welles Wilder and
was introduced in 1978. I once got a letter from Wilder about an indicator
that I developed in my early days in the business. I still have the letter and
look at it once in a while. It was a nice thing for a well-known person in the
business to do for someone who was just getting started. But more than
stroke my ego, the letter got me interested in RSI.
RSI is a very useful tool, by itself or in combination with other oscillators.
RSI uses a mathematical formula to measure price momentum and calculate
the relative strength of current prices compared to previous prices.
Like stochastic indicators, RSI’s strength is that it’s good at telling when the
market is overbought or oversold (see the previous section).
I like to use RSI in markets that tend to stay in a particular trend for an
extended period. Energy markets are an example. See Chapter 13 for a classic
example of how to use RSI.
Seeing how trading bands stretch
As your use of technical analysis grows more sophisticated, you’ll want to
know the potential price limits of certain trades. This information helps you
ponder when to enter and exit trades and when markets may stall and
reverse trend. A good tool for those purposes is a trading band.
Trading bands also are known as trading envelopes, because they surround
prices, thus providing visual cues about where price support and resistance
levels are at any given time. I like to think of trading bands as variable chan-
nels. Chapter 7 shows you trading channels that are defined by trend lines
that you draw. Trading bands are similar to trend channels in that they pro-
vide you a visual framework of a trading range. The only difference is that
trading bands are more dynamic, because they change with every tick in the
price of the underlying asset.
Don’t get confused here. Trading bands are, in fact, trading channels that
change with every tick. In other words, trend channels, which are drawn
either by hand or with software, are straight lines, pointed either up or down,
connecting the high or low points of the top or the bottom of the price range.
When you look at trading channels, you’re getting a visual representation of
the trading range.
Trading bands go further by giving you both the parameters of the trading
range along with clues as to where the trading range may be heading in 
the future.
140
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

The most commonly used trading bands are Bollinger bands, which were
introduced and made famous by John Bollinger, a pioneering technical ana-
lyst and television commentator.
Introducing Bollinger bands
Bollinger bands essentially mark flexible trading channels that fluctuate by
two standard deviations above and below a moving average. The bands are
helpful in defining trading ranges and telling you when a change in the trend
is coming. Bollinger introduced the bands with the 20-day moving average,
but you can set them up for use with any moving average, and they’ll work
the same way.
In terms of the market, a standard deviation is a statistical expression of the
potential variability of prices, or the potential trading range. The two-stan-
dard deviation method is a default used by most software programs because
it catches most intermediate term trends. That means when you punch up
Bollinger bands on your trading software, you’ll see bands defining the trad-
ing range that are two standard deviations above and two standard devia-
tions below the market price.
As you progress and become more experienced, you may want to use smaller
or larger standard deviations. If you want more frequent signals, you shorten
or use less standard deviation. For longer-term trading, you use larger or
more standard deviation.
Don’t get too hung up in the statistical language. The important concept to
remember is that the market tends to follow some semblance of order, nonlin-
ear order, which is predictably unpredictable.
The Bollinger bands are good at displaying the order for you. And here’s how.
Figure 8-2 shows you how to apply Bollinger bands to a trading situation that
involves the price of the euro during the same period of time highlighted in
Figure 8-1.
When using Bollinger bands to analyze the markets, you need to
 Watch their general direction. If the bands are rising, then the market is
in an uptrend. If they’re falling, the market is in a downtrend.
 Watch the width between the upper and lower bands. Shrinking
Bollinger bands — where the distance between the upper and lower
bands is narrowing — signal a decrease in volatility and indicate that a
big move is on the way. I like to call this a squeeze. Arrows in Figure 8-2
point to a nice squeeze in the bands that preceded a false breakout and
a clear downturn, or breakdown. Here’s another good squeeze: Notice
how the bands tightened around prices before the euro broke out and
headed higher. Decreasing price volatility is usually a prelude to a big
move. Widening bands usually are a signal that the trend has changed
141
Chapter 8: Speculating Strategies That Use Advanced Technical Analysis

and that the general tendency of prices is likely to continue in the direc-
tion of the new trend.
Futures traders work in a time frame of a gnat, and a breakdown can be
two hours of falling prices if you’re using charts featuring five-minute
bars (see Chapter 7 for more about charting).
The direction is not always certain, though, so you need to wait until the
market moves, and catch the move as early as possible.
Bollinger bands also are excellent for staying with the trend. Watch for prices
to be
 Walking the bands. Markets that move along either of the (upper or
lower) bands for an extended time are interpreted as a signal that the
current trend is going to continue for some time. The bracket from
September to November shows a nice example of how the euro walked
the band for a good while during its late 2004 rally.
I realize that reference to “some time” can be frustrating and may be
confusing to readers who require certainty in their trading and more
precise time frames. But when you’re trading, all you can do is under-
stand the possibilities and monitor your trades accordingly until the

market tells you that the trend has changed. That’s one of the reasons
that you should never rely on a single indicator without using others as
backups. In Figure 8-2, the “some time” turned out to be three months.
By monitoring your trade closely, you could’ve followed this market
movement for the entire period.
 Breaking outside the bands. When a market’s price breaks outside the
bands around a moving average, it usually means you can expect rever-
sal in the market — a trip to the opposite band. Breakouts don’t always
indicate a shift in the market, but if the market goes outside the bands
enough times, the price eventually makes a trip in the opposite direction.
When the market touches either of the bands, it’s only a matter of time
before it eventually touches the other band; however, the specific amount
of time it takes for this kind of reversal to occur is not as predictable.
The block arrow in February in Figure 8-2 points to a great example of how
the lower band can serve as a launching pad for a bounce back up to the
upper band. The euro not only touched the band, but spent several days just
outside of it.
An easy way to remember how Bollinger bands work is to think of them as
tight rubber bands and the moving average as a magnet. When the rubber
bands get stretched too far, the magnet pulls the market back into a more
normal state, inside the bands.
Trading with Bollinger bands
Bollinger bands can be used alone, but they work much better when used in
combination with oscillators and other moving averages.
As with any indicator, Bollinger bands are not perfect. Sometimes, the price of
the underlying asset rises above the upper band, and you think that a trip to the
lower band is possible, thus prompting you to sell. Sometimes, you’ll be right.
At other times, however, prices fall back inside the band, stay there a couple of
days, and rally right back up, continuing to walk along the upper band.
That’s when other indicators, such as MACD and stochastic oscillators and
moving-average crossovers, come in handy as checks and balances.
You can visualize a good example of Bollinger bands being used in conjunc-
tion with other indicators by viewing Figures 8-1 and 8-2 together. The
squeezing Bollinger bands in Figure 8-2 occurred at the same time that the
MACD oscillator failed to confirm the higher high in the euro currency. The
combination of the two — the bands signaling that a big move was in the
offing and the negative divergence in the MACD — was confirmed when the
euro began a downtrend.
143
Chapter 8: Speculating Strategies That Use Advanced Technical Analysis

I use Bollinger bands on all my trades, regardless of whether I’m looking at intra-
day 15-minute candlestick charts or longer-term daily or weekly bar charts. And
I always use a 20-period chart marked with candlesticks at 15-minute intervals
for my intraday charting. Using short-term charts, I can tell what the market is
doing much better than I can when using longer-term charts. You’ll figure out
what works best for you when you gain more trading experience. The only rule
when it comes to charting: Use the parameters that you’re comfortable with and
that make you money.
You can use Bollinger bands, oscillators, and moving averages as guidelines
when placing your trades. Here’s how:
 When looking to go long (see Chapters 7 and 20), you can set your buy
points just above the lower Bollinger band so that you catch the bounce
when prices bounce back into the band, and a new uptrend starts.
 When looking to go short, you’re selling high; thus you put your sell-
short entry point as the market breaks, and it comes back inside the
upper band. In this case, you’re looking for prices to break and to profit
from the break, which is why you’re selling short.
 When taking profits, you can use the moving average to set your sell
points to take profits based, of course, on where other indicators show
the market is headed when market prices reach those points.
 When adding to your position (buying), you can use the moving aver-
age to establish new buy points to bolster your position. When prices
fall back to the moving average and hold, you can add to positions there.
 When the market breaks outside the upper band, on the way up, you
can sell your position there if you’re long. See the “Take profits” arrow in
Figure 8-2. As the market breaks back into the band, you can then sell
the market short.
 When the market drops below the lower band, you can take profits on
short positions and go long at the lower band.
Trading with trend lines
Trend lines are much like Bollinger bands but without so much flexibility.
Trend lines directly reflect the overall trend of the market, but they’re static
because you draw them on your charts with the drawing tool in your soft-
ware package. This tool is best used for spotting a key change in the overall
direction of the underlying market.
Trend lines are just lines on charts, such as the ones shown in Figure 8-5
(numbered 1 through 4). The correct way to draw a trend line is to connect at
least two points in the price chart without crossing through any other price
areas. If you can draw the trend through more than two points, it can become
144
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

more accurate; however, trend lines are another tool that needs to be used
with other indicators.
You can use trend lines for both short- and long-term trading, and in both
cases they tell you the same thing, the overall trend of the market. The
important trend-line concept to remember is that rising prices remain in a
rising trend as long as they’re above the trend line. Likewise, falling prices
remain in a downtrend as long as they’re below the falling trend line. Breaks
above or below the trend lines signal that the trend has changed. Correctly
drawn trend lines (see previous paragraph) help you stay on the right side of
the market as follows:
 In uptrends, trend lines connect the lowest low to the next low that pre-
cedes a new high without passing through any other points. Two uptrend
lines, numbered 2 and number 3, are shown in Figure 8-3, a long-term
chart covering five years of trading in the U.S. Dollar Index. The price
break above Trend line 1 shows you when to buy right after a downtrend
line is broken. Trend line 3 shows you how to add to your position as the
price holds above the trend line.
 In downtrends, trend lines connect the highest high to the next high
that precedes a new low without passing through any other points. Two
downtrend lines in Figure 8-3 include an intermediate-term trend line that
lasts for month, Trend line 1, and a long-term trend line, Trend line 4.
Trend line 1 shows you how to remain in a short position as long as the
price remains below the falling trend. Trend line 4 shows you that you
need to be buying the dollar when the price of the dollar breaks above
the multiyear trend. Needless to say, as long as prices stayed below
Trend line 4, the primary trading direction was to be short the dollar.
Short-term trend-line trading
When trading futures, at times you can easily get caught up in the jargon.
Short-term trading should never be confused with short selling. Short selling
means that you’re betting that prices will fall. Short-term trading means that
you’re not interested in holding a position for longer than a few hours or 
days at most.
To trade the long side (or buy by using trend lines), you can
 Buy a portion of your position when a downtrend that you’ve been fol-
lowing, or shorting, is broken (see Figure 8-3).
 Draw your trend line as the market is developing an uptrend and then
buy when the market touches the uptrending line for the third time with-
out breaking below it.
 Supplement trend lines with oscillators and moving averages to make
sure that the odds of a winning trade are increased. You should never
rely on only one indicator to make your trades.
145
Chapter 8: Speculating Strategies That Use Advanced Technical Analysis

I find it easier to trade after a trend line is initially broken. Sometimes I use
successful tests, or price moves back to the trend line without breaking the
line, to add to my position (see next section). This strategy works well in the
oil markets and with the dollar.
Long-term trend-line trading
Say you’ve been short selling a downtrend in the value of the U.S. dollar for
several weeks, but you’re not sure how much longer the position will do well.
Aside from using moving averages, Bollinger bands, and a few oscillators, a
good trend line can be the best indicator for the job.
Figure 8-3, a five-year chart of the value of the U.S. dollar, provides a great
example of how drawing trend lines on long-term charts can help you spot a
meaningful change in a long-term trend.
A meaningful break in a long-standing trend often means that the trend is
changing directions. You can see in Figure 8-3 that at least a meaningful inter-
mediate-term advance in the dollar began in 2005 and lasted for several
months following a break in a long-term downtrend.
If you’re drawing trend lines, then it’s a good bet that big-money players are
drawing them, too. As Barbara Rockefeller points out in Technical Analysis
For Dummies (Wiley), big traders sometimes sell their positions long enough
to find out what happens when market prices touch the trend line. In essence,
that means trend lines can encounter points of high volatility, and you can
get shaken out of a position more than once if you’re not careful, especially
when you base your trades only on trend lines. Instead of relying on only

cators, just to make sure that the odds of success are as much on your side
as possible.
Lining Up the Dots: Trading 
with the Technicals
Technical analysis is like solving puzzles — kind of like connecting the dots.
You start with a price chart, and you start adding lines, bands, oscillators,
and indicators.
As you go along, things can grow cluttered, and you can lose your way. The
good thing is that trading software has “Clear” buttons, which means you can
wipe out all the lines and squiggles on your charts and start over anytime
things get out of control. Save your work first, though, in case you need to
refer back to it.
In the next section, I deal with chart clutter by focusing on staying with 
the trend.
Identifying trends
Trading is not only about swimming with the tide; it’s also about knowing
when the tide is going to turn against you. Good traders figure out which way
the trend is moving before they risk their money. It really is as simple as that.
However, you also need to remember that several time frames are involved in
price activity, and that knowing which ways the short-, intermediate-, and
long-term trends are headed in your markets is equally as important.
Finding the trends is easy; you simply look at price charts for multiple time
frames every day. Daily, weekly, and monthly charts, spanning months,
weeks, and even years are the best way to go. Checking them all before you
look at your intraday price charts will enable you to be on the right side of
the market for the time frame in which you plan your trades.
If, for example, you’re day trading in wheat, you at least want to know where
the market has been during the last few weeks or months, because intraday
prices of wheat are likely to be guided by that overall trend.
You can also use long-term price charts as the basis for spotting key long-
term support and resistance points and for identifying those same points on
your shorter-term charts.
147
Chapter 8: Speculating Strategies That Use Advanced Technical Analysis

Thereafter, you can use the trend lines in conjunction with moving averages
and oscillators to help identify the dominant trend before you trade.
Think of short-term charts like the zoom lens on your camera; they help you
zoom in for a closer look at the long-term action.
Before making a trade, make sure that you know the dominant trends. Keep a
trading log so you can write them down on a daily basis before hitting the
daily action.
Getting to know setups
As a trader, you’re a hunter, and good hunters appreciate high levels of activ-
ity and the quiet periods in between. Remember, only three things can
happen in a market. Prices can rise, fall, or move sideways for an extended
period of time.
As a trader/hunter, your job is to look through all of your charts for setups,
or chart formations that signal when a change is about to occur in the market
you’re studying and want to trade in.
As you look for trading opportunities, watch for the following:
 Constricting Bollinger bands, which point to the potential for a big
move getting closer
 Sideways price movements following advances and declines, which
indicate volatility is easing as traders try to decide what to do next
 Breakouts that occur when prices break above or cross over key sup-
port or resistance levels, trend lines, oscillators, moving averages, or
other market indicators
After you find them, setups call for careful observation in which you apply
the principles of the indicators explained earlier in this chapter.
A good rule to follow is to place your entry and exit points right above or
below the setup in the direction of the dominant trend.
Buying the breakout
Breakouts are exciting. Prices suddenly burst out of a basing pattern. Volume
can swell, and suddenly your trading screens are flashing my favorite trading
color, green, as buyers come into the market.
148
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

A breakout is a signal for you to go to work. Because it can come at virtually
any time, you need to be prepared to react.
Figure 8-1 (earlier in this chapter) shows you a classic example of a nice
setup, a breakout, and the right outcome.
The euro formed a 41⁄2-month base and then delivered a nice breakout in mid-
October, after testing resistance levels in July, August, and twice in
September. Important features to notice about this classic basing pattern are
that the euro found support twice during the basing period, and its value did
not retreat to the bottom of the trading range after September.
These two factors together indicated that buyers slowly were starting to take
the upper hand. In addition, higher lows indicated by the MACD oscillator
and positive basing action (see Chapter 7) predicted the breakout.
The ideal entry point (labeled in the figure) for buying the breakout is after
the price clears all of the previous resistance and begins moving higher — in
a hurry.
Don’t be too concrete here. Setups are setups. They look the same on long-
term charts as they do on short-term charts. For example, if you’re using a
chart to cover one day’s trading, say around six hours, your bars or candle-
sticks may be anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes, meaning that by the end of a few
hours, your chart will be full. You can use the same indicators on these charts.
Bollinger bands shrink just the same. Prices will rise and fall above nine-minute
moving averages. And MACD and stochastic oscillators will be just as applica-
ble. The key is that the principles stay the same, no matter the time frame.
Swinging for dollars
Swing trading enables you to take advantage of markets that are stuck in
narrow trading ranges or prices that are moving sideways or within trading
channels, up or down between levels of support and resistance. The euro in
Figure 8-1 was in a narrow trading range before it broke out in October.
To be able to make profitable trades in markets with narrow trading ranges,
swing traders rely on trend lines, Fibonacci levels, and moving averages to
identify the levels of support and resistance that they use to establish price
points at which they buy, sell, and sell short their investments. When prices
reach support and resistance levels, swing traders take action, in general
buying on weakness at the bottom of the trading range and selling on weak-
ness at the top of the trading range. In other words, swing traders set targets
for their trades and anticipate trend changes when the market reaches those
targets based on their analysis of their respective markets.
149
Chapter 8: Speculating Strategies That Use Advanced Technical Analysis

The bible of swing trading is Alan Farley’s The Master Swing Trader 
(McGraw Hill).
You can combine support and resistance lines with Bollinger bands and sto-
chastic oscillators to become a pretty decent swing trader. The euro provided
plenty of opportunities for swing trades in the 41⁄2 months before its October
breakout — shown in Figures 8-1 and 8-2. Note how the support and resis-
tance lines, the market action close to the Bollinger bands, and overbought
and oversold readings on the stochastic oscillator all work together as the
euro reached the tops and bottoms of its multimonth trading range.
Swing trading, however, is risky business, the same as any other form of trad-
ing. In the Figure 8-1 example, you could’ve lost significant amounts of money
if you happened to use the 200-day moving average to set up a swing trade in
late April and May. The key: The MACD oscillator failed to confirm the
attempted bottom above the moving average.
Selling and shorting the breakout 
in a downtrend
Regardless of whether you’re a momentum trader buying on breakouts or a
swing trader setting up and knocking down targets, changing trends are the
trader’s bread and butter. And one of the hardest things for a trader to do is
getting up the guts to sell an instrument short. Fortunately, the complexities
of the market, the popular psychology that shorting is immoral, and the high
risk of losing large sums of money serve as three major deterrents against the
practice.
And yet, if you keep close tabs on trend lines, oscillators, and moving aver-
ages to spot changes in a market’s price trends, and watch Bollinger bands
and Fibonacci retracement levels to predict when important shifts in the mar-
kets are likely, you can manage your risk and make some money selling short.
You also need to use protective stops, just in case you’re wrong.
Selling short is a different animal. It’s essentially the practice of turning the
world upside down and making money from someone else’s miscues,
whether political, corporate, or otherwise.
The two basic strategies for short selling are swing trading (see the previous
section) and selling into the breakdown of prices.
When you’re selling into the breakdown, you have to wait for bad things to
happen. A good rule of thumb is to consider that a market is worthy of short-
selling consideration when it has been going up for an extended period of
time. It can be weeks, months, or years.
150
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

When selling short, or shorting, you can do the following:
 Anticipate the breakdown by looking at the Bollinger bands and
• Watching for the bands to constrict and the market to stop walk-
ing the band. If trend lines are broken toward the downside, you
can short an instrument. Be sure to place a stop just above the
trend line.
• Watching for the market action near the moving average inside the
bands, which can signal support.
 Monitor your short sales positions carefully at all times but especially in
markets that respond to news and at times of high political tension.
Bonds and currencies are especially susceptible to news and political
tensions.
 Give your short sales positions room to move. Setting your exit stops
too tightly can get you whipsawed. Different markets have different
inherent ranges. Before you sell an instrument short, you need to
become aware of its normal price movements and adjust your position
accordingly.
You can count several trading periods and get an idea of the average number
of days that a particular market moves along rising or falling Bollinger bands.
This time frame won’t be exact, but you want to have a good idea neverthe-
less. Shares of Starbucks, for example, usually hug the lower Bollinger band
anywhere from four to ten days before they bounce up. Although knowing
that time frame doesn’t guarantee that the bounce will last, you still can be on
the lookout for increased activity that can affect your trades during that period
of time in the market you’re trading and in other markets. Technical Analysis
For Dummies (Wiley) offers a fairly detailed introduction to these topics.
Setting your entry and exit points
Where you set entry and exit points — whether mentally or automatically on
your trading platform — can make a big difference in your trading perfor-
mance. Although no hard-and-fast rules determine where to set these points,
some fairly reliable guidelines are available. Here’s a quick lineup:
 Tailoring the strategy to the market. Get to know how fast your market
moves and how volatile trading can be before you ever start trading. It’s
a good idea to do this through paper trading, a way to practice trading
without assuming the financial risk. Most online futures brokers will
have practice trading available on their Web sites. Use this technique to
become familiar with each market you trade.
 Knowing your risk tolerance. If you know wheat moves too fast for your
liking, try the U.S. Dollar Index, which moves more slowly.
151
Chapter 8: Speculating Strategies That Use Advanced Technical Analysis

 Giving a fast-moving market more room to maneuver than a slower
one. As a general rule, you need to give fast-moving markets a bit more
room to maneuver (bears repeating). I usually give myself a few ticks
above or below the support or resistance area that I’m using as my line
in the sand so I avoid getting whipsawed.
 Setting sell stops. Where you set your sell stops depends not only on
your experience, but also on the market’s volatility and your risk 
tolerance.
 Using trailing stops. You can reset these manually; use prices as a guide
or percentages. Again, much depends on the inherent volatility and gen-
eral tendencies of each individual market, which is why you need to
exercise care and be aware of how all contracts that you trade fluctuate
before committing any money to a trade.
 Hurrying gets you nowhere. Never be in a hurry when trading. Some
traders like to give markets an extra day before selling or buying. For
example, if you spot a trend change on the S&P 500 futures chart on
Tuesday, you may want to wait until Wednesday before you make your
decision.
 Using technical analysis to establish market entry and exit points.
Fibonacci levels, moving averages, trend lines, and support and resis-
tance points provide you with plenty of references for where to place
entry and exit points. The figures in this chapter offer a good foundation
for beginning strategies.
 Expanding your strategies. As you gain more trading experience, you
can find out more about the Fibonacci theory, Eliott waves, and Gann
strategies by reading more about them and other approaches to trading.
Technical Analysis For Dummies (Wiley) offers a fairly detailed introduc-
tion to those topics.

 Watching for signs of soft sentiment
A
s a contrarian thinker, my first memory of a real-life experience with
contrarian market analysis was in 1990. Sure, I’d read the books and
articles that tell stories about how stocks need to be sold when the
shoeshine boy starts recommending stocks to you as he polishes your shoes
at the airport. But, for me, 1990 was the literal proof in the pudding.
At some point in August 1990, stocks were failing in the United States mar-
kets, and the price of crude oil was testing the $40-per-barrel resistance level.
At the time, $40-per-barrel oil was an extremely high price, but cheap com-
pared to the $60 prices to which it eventually soared in 2005.
Both times the rise in the price of oil to what was then a record high was
caused by a war in Iraq.
During the latter stages of the oil rally in 1990, a picture of an Arab holding a
gun was on the cover of BusinessWeek magazine with the headline of head-
lines above it: “Hostage To Oil.”
That caught my eye. And sure as shootin’ that cover story appeared only a
few weeks before the price of oil topped out and actually collapsed when the
United States invaded Iraq a few months later.
My contrarian stance was reinforced once again by the markets in 1991;
that’s when the first U.S. invasion of Iraq touched off a decade-long bull
market in the stock market.

In this chapter, I take you through the major aspects of contrarian thinking
and explain how to know when to use it and how to make it part of your 
trading arsenal.
Understanding Contrarian Thinking
Contrarians trade against the grain at key turning points when shifts in
market sentiment become noticeable.
For example, a contrarian may
 Start looking for reasons to sell when everyone else is bullish.
 Think a good time to buy is when pessimism about the markets is so
thick that you can cut it with a knife.
More can be made of contrarian trading than just using the prevailing senti-
ment in the market, because sentiment trading is inexact and can lead to
losses whenever you pull the trigger too early during the cycle.
The bullish extremes reached during the buildup of the Internet bubble were
unprecedented. Although traders who sold early were vindicated, they never-
theless lost a great deal of money by getting out too early. Another extreme is
when the bear market in stocks ended in 2002. Traders who got into stocks
during the seven-month period from June 2002 to March 2003 were whipsawed,
or shaken out of positions with losses and tortured by the extremes in volatil-
ity that can happen as the final bottom of the mega bear market finally formed.
Throughout the three-year period during which the bear market in stocks
unfolded, plenty of opportunities opened up to trade on the long side, mean-
ing to buy stocks based on sentiment, but most of them proved false until the
final bottom was reached.
Unfortunately, sentiment analysis, although an inexact science, is only part of
the picture, a part that works better when combined with technical analysis.
This chapter helps you combine sentiment and technical analyses within
your trading arsenal to lead you to better decision-making.
Survey Says: Trust Your Feelings
Two popular sentiment surveys affect the futures markets: Market Vane and
Consensus, Inc.
154
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Consensus, Inc., www.consensus-inc.com, is based in Kansas City, and is
published weekly as a newspaper that you get in the mail or as an Internet
publication.
Consensus offers sentiment data on the following:
 Precious metals: Silver, gold, copper, and platinum
 Financial instruments: Eurodollars, U.S. dollar, Treasury bills (T-bills),
and Treasury bonds (T-bonds)
 Currencies: The U.S. dollar, Euro FX, British pound, Deutschemark,
Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, and the Japanese yen
 Soybean complex: Soybeans, soybean oil, and soybean meal
 Meats: Pork bellies, hogs, cattle, and feeder cattle
 Grains: Wheat and corn
 Stock indexes: The S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 stock indexes
 Foods: Citrus fruits, sugar, cocoa, and coffee
 Fibers: Cotton and lumber
 Energy complex: Crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and heating oil
Market Vane, www.marketvane.net, offers a similar set of measures under
the name Bullish Consensus. Snapshots of both surveys for stocks, bonds,
Eurodollar, and Euro currency are available weekly in Barron’s magazine, under
the Market Laboratory section or at Barron’s Online, www.barrons.com.
What you’ll find when reading Barron’s or another of these publications are
percentages of market sentiment, such as oil being 75 percent bulls, or bull-
ish, which simply means that 75 percent of the opinions surveyed by the edi-
tors of Market Vane or Consensus are bullish on oil. Usually such sentiment 
is interpreted as a sign of caution, but not necessarily as a sign of an impend-
ing top.
After you find out the market sentiment, technical analysis kicks in. A high
bullish reading in terms of sentiment should alert you to start looking for tech-
nical signs that a top is in place, checking whether key support levels or trend
lines have been breached, or checking whether the market is struggling to
make new highs. See Chapters 7 and 8 for more details on technical analysis.
Sentiment surveys are popular tools used mostly by professional traders to
gauge when a particular market is at an extreme point with either too much
bullishness or too much bearishness. Their major weakness is that they’re
now so popular that their ability to truly mark major turning points is not as
155
Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

good as it was even in the late 1980s or early 1990s. Still, when used within
the context of good technical and fundamental analysis, they can be useful.
Of the two sentiment surveys, Market Vane is better known, and according to
its Web site, Market Vane’s Bullish Consensus has been published on a weekly
basis since 1964 and on a daily basis since 1988. Other particulars that
describe the sentiment surveys are that they are
 Based on advisor polls that are conducted either by reading the latest
publications sent to the survey editors or by telephone polling of a
group of advisors.
 Indirect measures of public opinion about the individual markets.
 Interpreted as a measure of public opinion because they’re based on
advisory opinions usually subscribed to by the public. However, market
professionals traditionally considered the public to be wrong, especially
at market turning points.
Sentiment survey readings must be at extreme levels to be useful. In other
words, sentiments below 35 to 40 percent for any given category usually are
considered bullish, because few advisors are left to recommend selling.
You can use sentiment surveys as trend-following systems. A market that hits
a new high as sentiment is rising along with it — without hitting any caution-
ary points on the charts — can be taken as a sign that more upside potential
exists. Even so, when using sentiment to help guide your decision-making,
always
 Check your charts and other indicators to confirm what the surveys 
are saying.
 Avoid trading on sentiment data alone, because doing so is too risky.
 Check sentiment tendencies against technical and fundamental analyses,
even though it may make you a little late in executing your entry or exit
trades. Making sure is better than missing a significant part of an
advance if you’re long or a decline if you’re short.
Even though the sentiment surveys are not giving you textbook numbers,
they nevertheless can be useful. Figure 9-1 highlights a set of key market turn-
ing points in the 2004–2005 time period.
Keep tabs on Consensus and Market Vane. One or the other is likely to give
you a fairly timely and useful signal at most market turning points.

Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Understanding Volume (And How 
the Market Feels about It)
Trading volume is a direct, real-time sentiment indicator. As a general rule,
high trading volume is a sign that the current trend is likely to continue. But
consider that advice as only a guideline. Good volume analysis takes other
market indicators into account.
Figure 9-2, which shows the S&P 500 e-mini futures contract for September
2005, portrays an interesting relationship between volume, sentiment, and
other indicators.
In April, the market made a textbook bottom. Notice how the volume bars at
the bottom of the chart rose as the market was reaching a selling climax, as
signified by the three large candlesticks, or trading bars. This combination of
signals — large price moves and large volumes when the market is falling —
is often the prelude to a classic market bottom, because traders were panick-
ing and selling at any price just to get out of their positions.

Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

Notice how the volume trailed off as the market consolidated, or started
moving sideways, making a complex bottom that took almost two weeks to
form. Consolidation is what happens when buyers and sellers are in balance.
When markets consolidate, they’re catching their breath and getting set up
for their next move. Consolidation phases are unpredictable and can last for
short periods of time, such as hours or days, or longer periods, even months
to years.
A third important volume signal occurred in late May and early June as the
market rallied. Notice how volume faded as the market continued to rise.
Eventually, the market fell and moved significantly lower as it broke below
key trend-line support.
Finally, note in Figure 9-2 that open interest (see the “Out in the Open with
Open Interest” section, later in this chapter) fell during the last stage of the
rally in late June, which usually is a sign that more weakness is likely,
because fewer contracts remain open, suggesting that traders are getting
exhausted and are less willing to hold on to open positions.
Using volume indicators in the futures markets has limitations. The example
in Figure 9-2 needs to be viewed within the context of these limitations:
 The release of volume figures in the futures market is delayed by one day.
 Higher volume levels steadily migrate toward the closest delivery month,
or the month in which the contract is settled and delivery of the under-
lying asset takes place. That migration is important for traders, because
the chance of getting a better price for your trade is higher when volume
is better. In June, for example, the trading volume is higher in the S&P

500 futures for the September contract than for other months, because
September is the next delivery month. Volume for the delivery-month
contract increases for a while as traders move their positions to the
front month, or the commonly quoted (price) contract at the time. Say,
for example, that the volume data for June 24, 2005, shows 36,717 con-
tracts traded in the September 2005 contract, 170 in the December 2005
contract, and 21 in the March 2006 contract. None of the other listed
contracts had any volume on that day.
 Limit days (especially limit up days), or days in which a particular con-
tract makes a big move in a short period of time, can have very high
volume, thus skewing your analysis. A limit up day, when the market
rises to the limit in a short period of time, usually is a signal of strength
in the market. Limit up or limit down days tend to happen in response to
a single or related series of events, external or internal, such as a very
surprising report. When markets crash, you can see limit down moves
that then trigger trading collars (periods when the market trades but
prices don’t change) or complete stoppages of trading.
The opposite is true when you have a big move on low volume, such as
the first of the last two bars pictured in Figure 9-2. On the day of the first
break of the rising trend line, volume was lower than in the prior few
days. On the second day of selling, volume rose, suggesting that more
trouble was coming.
When analyzing volume, be sure that you
 Put the current volume trends in the proper context with relationship to
the market in which you’re trading, rather than thinking about hard-and-
fast rules. It’s important to note that trends tend to either start or end
with a volume spike climax (typically twice the 20- or 50-day moving
average of daily volume).
 Remember the differences in the way that volume is reported and inter-
preted in the futures market — compared with the stock market.
 Check other indicators to confirm what volume is telling you.
 Ask yourself whether the market is vulnerable to a trend change.
 Consider key support and resistance levels.
 Protect your portfolio by being prepared to make necessary changes.
Out in the Open with Open Interest
Open interest is the number of active contracts for any given security during
any trading period. It is the most useful tool for analyzing potential trend
reversals in futures markets.
159
Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

A more formal definition is this: Open interest is the total number of con-
tracts entered into during a specified period of time that have not been liqui-
dated either by offsetting transactions or by actual delivery. Open interest
applies to futures and options but not to stocks.
Open interest
 Measures the total number of short and long positions (shorts and longs).
 Varies based on the number of new traders entering the market and the
number of traders leaving the market.
 Rises by one whenever one new buyer and one new seller enter the
market, thus marking the creation of one new contract.
 Falls by one when a long trader closes out a position with a trader who
already has an open short position.
In the futures markets, the number of longs always equals the number of
shorts. So when a new buyer buys from an old buyer who is cashing in, no
change occurs in open interest.
The exchanges publish open-interest figures daily, but the numbers are
delayed by one day, so the volume and open interest figures on today’s
quotes, therefore, are only estimates.
Charting open interest on a daily basis in conjunction with a price chart
helps you keep track of the trends in open interest and how they relate to
market prices. Barchart.com (www.barchart.com) offers excellent free
futures charts that give you a good look at open interest.
Open interest is one of the most useful tools you can have when trading
futures. Even though the figures are released with a one-day delay, they still
are useful when you evaluate the longer trend of the market.
Rising markets
In a rising trend, open interest is fairly straightforward:
 Bullish open interest: When open interest rises along with prices, it sig-
nals that an uptrend is in place and can be sustained. This bullish sign
also means that new money is moving into the market.
Extremely high open interest in a bull market usually is a danger signal.
 Bearish open interest: Rising prices combined with falling open interest
signal a short-covering rally in which short sellers are reversing their
160
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

positions so that their buying actually is pushing prices higher. In this
case, higher prices are not likely to last, because no new buyers are
entering the market.
 Bearish leveling or decline: A leveling off or decrease in open interest
in a rising market often is an early warning sign that a top may be 
nearing.
Sideways markets
In a sideways market, open interest gets trickier, so you need to watch for the
following:
 Rising open interest during periods when the market is moving sideways
(or in a narrow trading range; see Chapter 8), because they usually lead
to an intense move after prices break out of the trading range — up 
or down.
When dealing with sideways markets, be sure to confirm open-interest
signals by checking them against other market indicators.
 Down-trending price breakouts (breakdowns). Some futures traders use
breakouts on the downside to set up short positions, just like commer-
cial and professional traders, thus leaving the public wide open for a
major sell-off.
 Falling open interest in a trader’s market. When it happens, traders with
weak positions are throwing in the towel, and the pros are covering their
short positions and setting up for a market rally.
Falling markets
In falling markets, open-interest signals also are a bit more complicated to
decipher:
 Bearish open interest: Falling prices combined with a rise in open inter-
est indicate that a downtrend is in place and that it’s being fueled by
new money coming in from short sellers.
 Bullish open interest: Falling prices combined with falling open interest
is a sign that traders who had not sold their positions as the market
broke — hoping the market would bounce back — are giving up. In this
case, you need to start anticipating, or even expecting, a trend reversal
toward higher prices after this give-up phase ends.
161
Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

 Neutral: If prices rise or fall, but open interest remains flat, it means that
a trend reversal is possible. You can think of these periods as preludes
to an eventual change in the existing trend. Neutral open-interest situa-
tions are good times to be especially alert.
 Trending down: A market trend that has shifted downward at the same
time open interest is reaching high levels can be a sign that more selling
is coming. Traders who bought into the market right before it topped
out are now liquidating losing positions to cut their losses.
Flat open interest when prices are rising or falling means that a trend reversal
is possible.
Putting the Put/Call Ratios to Good Use
The put/call ratio is the most commonly used sentiment indicator for trading
stocks, but it can also be useful in trading stock index futures, because with it
you can pinpoint major inflection points in trader sentiment. Put/call ratios,
when at extremes, can be signs of excessive fear (a high level of put buying
relative to call buying) and excessive greed (a high level of call buying rela-
tive to put buying).
These indicators are not as useful as they once were because of more sophis-
ticated hedging strategies that are now often used in the markets.
As a futures trader, put/call ratios can help you make several important deci-
sions about
 Tightening your stops on open positions
 Setting new entry points if you’ve been out of the market
 Setting up hedges with options and futures
 Taking profits
Put/call ratios are best used in conjunction with technical analysis, so you
need to look at your charts and take inventory of your own positions during
the time frame in which you’re trading futures contracts. In other words, a
good time to check the put/call ratio is when you have a long position in S&P
500 Index futures and the stock market has been rising for several weeks, but
it’s running up against a tough long-term resistance level that it’s failed to
penetrate a few times during the last few weeks. From your read of the
put/call ratio, you can consider which of the four strategies in the previous
162
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

list you need to use. You can turn this scenario around for a falling market in
which you have either a short position or hold put options.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) updates the ratio throughout
the day at its Web site, www.cboe.com/data/IntraDayVol.aspx, and pro-
vides final figures for the day after the market closes.
The sections that follow describe two important ratios with which you need
to become familiar when trading stock index futures.
Total put/call ratio
The total put/call ratio is the original indicator introduced by Martin Zweig, a
prominent money manager and author who was one of the few traders who
sidestepped the market crash of October 1987 and made money by buying
put options. The put/call ratio is calculated using the following equation:
total put options purchased ÷ total call options purchased
The total ratio includes options on stocks, indexes, and long-term options
bought by traders on the CBOE. Although you can make sense of this ratio in
multiple ways, I’ve found it useful when the ratio rises above 1.0 and when it
falls below 0.5. When the ratio rises above 1.0, it usually means too much fear
is in the air and that the market is trying to make a bottom. Readings below
0.5, however, usually mean that too much bullishness is in the air and that
the market may fall.
Index put/call ratio
The index put/call ratio is a good measure of what futures and options play-
ers, institutions, and hedge-fund managers are up to. When this indicator is
above 2.0, it traditionally is a bullish sign, but when it falls below 0.90, it
becomes bearish and traditionally signals that some kind of correction is
coming. Because these numbers are not as reliable in the traditional sense as
they used to be, please consider them only as reference points, and never
base any trades on them alone. Don’t forget that put/call ratios need to be
correlated with chart patterns.
In June 2005, the CBOE index put/call ratio was high during the period from
June 17 through 23, which included an options expiration week. During those
five trading sessions, three readings of the index put/option ratio were above
2.00; the highest reading of 2.75 occurred on June 21. If you took these numbers
163
Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

at face value, you probably went aggressively long, expecting a likely rise in
stock index futures. Unfortunately, you would have been wrong!
On June 23 and 24, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 290
points, and the rest of the market got clobbered, too. Hindsight obviously
tells you that in this case, the rising put/call ratio was a signal that some-
body, or a group of people somewhere, was aware of information that some-
thing interesting might happen that could shake the markets.
Common knowledge tells you that many people with lots of money have
access to information to which you and I would never be privy and that we’d
never be able to gather. The job of the trader is to look for signs that some-
thing may be brewing.
And there it was . . . on Thursday, June 23, China’s third largest oil company,
CNOOC, bid $18 billion to purchase American oil company Unocal. The politi-
cal firestorm kicked off by this event certainly gave players a reason to sell
stocks.
Put/call ratios are best used as alert mechanisms for potential trend changes.
Traditionally, high ratios tend to signal that a great deal of pessimism exists
in the markets and that the markets should move higher. However, the truth
is that in current markets, where hedge funds and large institutions always are
running complex derivative strategies, high put/call ratios can be misleading.
Don’t ignore abnormal put/call ratio readings. Doing so can cost you signifi-
cant amounts of money in a hurry. As a result, take the following actions
apart from your daily routine:
 Check the put/call ratios after the market closes. The CBOE usually
updates the numbers by 5 p.m. central time.
 Favor thoughts of dramatic market reactions over thoughts of where
the market is headed when you see abnormally high or low put/call
ratios. Be ready to handle dramatic changes.
 Immediately look for weak spots in your portfolio whenever abnor-
mal activity occurs in the options market. Abnormal activity should
trigger ideas about hedging.
When you see abnormal put/call ratio numbers, consider the following:
 Tightening stops on your open stock index futures positions.
 Exploring options strategies, such as straddles, and strangles. See
Chapters 4 and 5 for an overview of the options market and option
strategies.
164
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

 Reversing positions. If you have a short position in the market, make
sure you’re ready to reverse and go long or vice versa if you have a long
position.
 Looking to the bond, currency, and oil markets for other trading oppor-
tunities with a goal of both hedging any problems in your stock index
futures and options and possibly expanding your profits in those areas.
Combining Open Interest, 
Volume, and Options
Table 9-1 summarizes the relationship between volume and open interest.
Figure 9-2 shows a great example of how to combine open interest and
volume to predict a trend change.
Generally, volume and open interest need to be heading in the same direction
as the market. When the market starts rising, for example, you want to see
volume and open interest expanding. A rising market with shrinking volume
and falling open interest usually is one that is heading for a correction.

Note in Figure 9-2 how the market started to rally in early June. Both volume
and open interest (the line coursing above the volume bars) moved up. This
chart confirmed the rising trend in the E-mini S&P futures.
After June 13, however, the market started going sideways. Volume began to
fade, and open interest began to flatten out. Three days before the June 24
break, open interest fell precipitously, signaling that the rally was running out
of gas. Fading volume provided a great example of how smart money was
taking profits and being replaced by new, weaker buyers. Likewise, falling
open interest not only confirmed an impending downturn, but it also revealed
165
Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

to you that traders with weak short positions were bailing out. The market
thus was losing buyers and sellers and its liquidity, which, in turn, made it
vulnerable to external events, such as the CNOOC/Unocal news.
When you plugged in rising put/call ratios with falling open interest in stock
futures, the result was a sign that the smart money sensed a rising risk in the
market and was preparing itself by buying portfolio insurance in the form of
put options, which rise in price during falling markets.
Smart money refers to large institutions, hedge funds, or individuals. They
have better access to information than the market at times, and they tend to
act ahead of the crowd. Sometimes they’re correct, and other times they’re
wrong. In this example, they were correct.
Using Soft Sentiment Signs
Soft sentiment signs usually are out of the mainstream and are subtle, non-
quantitative factors that most people tend to ignore. They can be anything
from the shoeshine boy giving stock tips or a wild magazine cover (classic
signs of a top) to people jumping out of windows during a market crash (a
classic sign of the other extreme). These signs can be anywhere from dra-
matic to humorous, and they can be quite useful. By no means should you
make them a mainstay of your trading strategy. But they can at times be 
helpful.
Scanning magazine covers 
and Web site headlines
Based on my 1990 experience with BusinessWeek and the top in oil prices,
every time crude oil rallies, I start looking for crazy headlines.
When crude oil reached an all-time high on June 17, 2005, I scanned the
covers of Time, Newsweek, and BusinessWeek. Time’s cover featured the late
Mao TseTung, BusinessWeek had senior citizens, and Newsweek had
dinosaurs. None of them even mentioned oil — a good soft sentiment sign
that the oil market still had some room to rise.
166
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Monitoring congressional investigations
and activist protests
Another soft sign that a top may be near is what politicians and activists say
or do in relation to how the markets move.
So, as oil made a new high, I scanned the news for signs of senators and other
members of Congress or of activists who were calling for investigations or
alleging that the oil companies were price gouging.
It took a while, but by the end of June, with Congress in full swing, the
attempted takeover of Unocal mobilized both sides of the aisle. Letters to
President Bush were written. Hearings were held at which Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan and Treasury Secretary John Snow argued about China’s newly
found role as a world power and what the circumstances would likely be.
The markets worried about protectionism, as well they should . . . the last
depression in the United States came as a result of Congress and President
Herbert Hoover concocting the Smoot-Hawley tariff.
As a contrarian, you must understand that the public going wild over an issue
can be a sign that a major turning point is on the way in the market.
Politicians and activists are no different these days, except that their lives
usually are not touched by reality the same way yours and mine are. They
start talking about something that you and I have experienced for months
only after they’ve read a new poll or received lots of letters and phone calls
from their constituents about the subject.
Political activity and outrage are no accident. It usually means that the public
is interested in the current set of developments. The thing is, when politi-
cians and activists finally pick up the chant, they do so because they see
some kind of advantage for their cause or their chances of being re-elected.
And that’s usually a sign that things are at a fever pitch, and the trend can
change, possibly in a hurry.
Don’t be in a hurry. Just because your initial scan of the news fails to reveal
important findings doesn’t mean that those events are not on the way. People
in Washington sometimes take several days to catch on to what’s happening
in the real world. Keep looking, especially when the market keeps moving in
the same direction.
167
Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

Watching the Drudge Report
Along with Congress, all good traders need to keep an eye on the Drudge
Report. The Drudge Report almost replaced BusinessWeek, Newsweek, and
Time as a barometer for when life has gone over the top. Aside from learning
what former President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, and anybody with a thirst for
power is doing, the daily news report compiled by Matt Drudge also is a
barometer for public opinion, or at least Drudge’s current attempts to influ-
ence public opinion. As a contrary sign for the markets, the Drudge Report is
a useful tool.
The Drudge Report headline on oil, after it closed at an all-time high of $59.18
per barrel on Friday, June 17, 2005, was benign. However, by Sunday night,
Drudge had the following in huge letters at the top of the page:
OIL $59
Still, because the revolving light that Drudge uses for his more dramatic Web
headlines was not flashing, the report was something worth watching but not
necessarily getting too worked up about.
If Drudge had known what he was doing, he would have used the flashing
light next to a headline reading, “December Crude at $60,” which truly was
alarming and more telling of what the market was pricing in for the future.
By June 21, Drudge was in full swing, along with CNBC, CNN, and most local
news outlets and newspapers. After the market closed that day, Drudge ran
the following headline:
Oil hits new high amid Norway strike fears . . . 
‘COULD TEST $70’ . . . 
Pickens predicts $3 gasoline. . . . “
By the time the CNOOC/Chevron story hit the wires, Drudge was having a
field day. During the weekend, on June 25, he ran this headline regarding the
attempted takeover of Unocal by the Chinese:
WHAT TO DO?
In comments at an oil conference, according to Reuters, famed Texas oil
investor T. Boone Pickens told an audience that $70 oil was on its way within
five years. But the wire services and the news hypers took the news out of
context, and created the panic-type feeling that preceded the top.
Pickens became one of the loudest bull voices for the rising price of oil. Like
Warren Buffet and George Soros before him, Pickens (and his billion-dollar
168
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

fund) was out in front of the bull run, coaxing every tick higher. Whether he
was selling into the frenzy, no one will know for sure. But the fact is that on
June 27, 2005, oil topped out at $60.54 per barrel for the August contract. In
December, the top was above $62.
What few of the mainstream news outlets carried was the fact that other ana-
lysts and experts who didn’t manage billion-dollar investments in oil were
scratching their heads, because oil supply figures were 8 percent ahead of
what was available the year before.
That meant that at some point, oil prices had to crack because of all the mis-
directed hype.
By June 30, August crude had closed at $56.50, a 6.7-percent drop in three
trading sessions and a potentially major hit to your oil contracts if you hap-
pened to get caught on the wrong side of the trade.
Figure 9-3 highlights the period during the month of June when many wild
headlines were written about rising oil prices.

Chapter 9: Trading with Feeling Now!

Despite all the soft media sentiment, some important technical signs also
were worth noting during the crude oil rally:
 Low volume when the all-time high for that period of time was reached.
The high volume on the second day of selling meant that the market was
ripe for a correction.
 Low volume on a breakout, especially one that leads to all-time highs, is
a sign of weakness.
 High volume as the market sells off is a sign that more selling is likely.
 A clean breakdown in the market, like the way oil prices cleanly sliced
through the rising trend line, is notable because it means that little
demand is in the market at the time and signals that more selling is
coming.
As with put/call ratios, wild headlines, Congressional hearings, and plenty of
attention on cable and local news channels are an alert that something dra-
matic is going to happen.
Developing Your Own 
Sentiment Indicators
A hot market eventually changes trends. It gets cold. No one knows when that
market is going to change trends. By using sentiment indicators and confirm-
ing one with another, you can get early warnings of pending changes.
When any market makes a new high, I usually go to the Drudge Report and
look for the headline. If it’s sensational enough, I start being careful about
that particular area of the market.
Here are two of my favorite personal indicators:
 If I start bragging to my wife about how much money I’m making in the
markets, I look for reasons to sell.
 When my mother tells me that I need to start watching the NASDAQ the
way she did in the summer of 1999, I start to shake in my boots.
When everybody starts giving me tips, I run for the door. You can develop
your own private set of indicators by monitoring your own excitement level.
If you start feeling invincible, as if you’re the best trader in the world, being a
little more careful is a good idea.
170
Part II: Analyzing the Markets 

Make a mental checklist. I always check my gut when I trade. If I’m all tied up
in knots, I’m less concerned than if I’m happy as a lark, because if I’m wor-
ried, I’m awake. Mind you, don’t make yourself sick over it. If you can’t stand
what you’re doing, then it isn’t for you.
The key is to search for some kind of balance within yourself by keeping your
eyes open, doing your homework, and comparing what’s going on in the
charts with what you’re reading and hearing from others.

with interest-rate futures, going international with the
currency markets, and taking stock of stock-index futures.
These three markets often set the tone for the trading day in
all markets, because they form a focal point or hub for the
global financial system. What’s good about these markets is
that they’re great places for you to get started in futures
trading, so I provide you with tips for doing just that.

T
he bond market rules the world. Everything that anyone does in the
financial markets anymore is built upon interest-rate analysis. When
interest rates are on the rise, at some point, doing business becomes difficult,
and when interest rates fall, eventually economic growth is energized.
That relationship between rising and falling interest rates makes the markets
in interest-rate futures, Eurodollars, and Treasuries (bills, notes, and bonds)
important for all consumers, speculators, economists, bureaucrats, and
politicians.
This chapter provides you with a detailed and useful introduction to a 
snapshot of how you can structure your analysis and trading in these major
instruments, but it isn’t meant to be an all-inclusive treatise on interest rates
and trading techniques.
Bonding with the Universe
At the center of the world’s financial universe is the bond market. And at the
center of the bond market is its relationship with the United States Federal
Reserve (the Fed) and the way the Fed conducts interest-rate policies.

By law, the Fed’s two main functions are
 Creating and maintaining conditions that keep inflation in check
 Maintaining full employment
Full employment is viewed by some as being potentially inflationary, because it
creates a scenario of too much money chasing too few goods and services — a
primal definition of inflation that’s not far from also defining capitalism.
Inflation decreases the return on bondholders’ investments, acting the way
sunlight does to a vampire. When you buy a bond, you get a fixed return, as
long as you hold that bond until it matures or, in the case of some corporate
or municipal bonds, until it’s called in. If you’re getting a 5 percent return on
your bond investment and inflation is growing at a 6-percent clip, you’re
already 1 percent in the hole, which is why bond traders hate inflation.
The connection between the bond market, the Federal Reserve, and the rest
of the financial markets is fundamental to understanding how to trade futures
and options and how to invest in general. In the next section, I discuss the
most important aspects of how it all works together.
Understanding the Fed and 
bond-market roles
The Fed cannot directly control the long-term bond rates that determine how
easy (or difficult) it is to borrow money to buy a new home or to finance long-
term business projects. What the Fed can and does do is adjust short-term
interest rates, such as the interest rate on Fed funds, the overnight lending
rate used by banks to square their books, and the discount rate, or the rate at
which the Fed loans money to banks to which no one else will lend money.
As the Fed senses that inflationary pressures are rising through analyzing
key economic reports, such as consumer prices, producer prices, the
employment report, and its own Beige Book (see Chapter 6), it starts to
raise interest rates.
The Fed usually raises the Fed funds target rate, which focuses on overnight
deposits between banks. Occasionally, when the Fed wants to make a point
that it’s in a hurry to make rates rise, it raises the discount rate, the rate that
the Fed charges banks to borrow at its discount window, which usually is a
loan of last resort for banks and a signal to the Fed that the individual bank
is in trouble.
176
Part III: Financial Futures 

When the Fed raises the Fed funds and/or the discount rates, banks usually
raise the prime rate, the rate that targets their best customers. At the same
time, credit-card companies raise their rates.
As the bond market senses inflationary pressures are rising, bond traders sell
bonds and market interest rates rise. Rising market interest rates usually trig-
ger rate increases for mortgages and car loans, which usually are tied to a
bond market benchmark rate. For example, most 30-year mortgages are tied
to the interest rate for the U.S. one-year Treasury note. I know that sounds
confusing, but that’s the way these things are structured.
When it comes down to recognizing when inflation is lurking, sometimes the
bond market takes action ahead of the Fed, but other times the Fed is ahead
of the market. Sometimes the bond market senses inflation before the Fed
does. When that happens, bond prices fall, market rates rise (such as the
yield on the U.S. ten-year T-note), and the Fed raises rates if its indicators
agree with the bond market’s analysis. Whenever the Fed disagrees with the
markets, it signals those disagreements usually through speeches from Fed
governors or even the chairman of the Fed. Interest rates are a two-way
street: The bond market sometimes disagrees with the Fed, and the Fed
sometimes disagrees with the markets.
Disagreements between the Fed and the bond market usually occur at the
beginning or at the end of a trend in interest rates. Say, for example, that the
Fed continually raises interest rates for an extended period of time. At some
point, long-term rates, which are controlled by the bond market, begin to drop,
even though short-term rates are on the rise. Falling long-term bond rates 
usually are a sign — from the bond market to the Fed — that the Fed needs to
consider pausing its interest-rate increases. The opposite also is true: When
the Fed goes too far in lowering short-term rates, bond yields begin to creep up
and signal the need for the Fed to consider a pause in its lowering of the rates.
Hedging in general terms
In general, hedging is taking a position in the market that’s in the opposite
direction of a trading position you’ve already established; it’s a form of insur-
ance against a reversal of trends. You need to know what the opposition is
doing anyway so that you’re better able to make your market move. In the
world of short-term interest rates, aside from speculators, the big money
comes from money-market funds and corporations.
Generally, they (money–market fund managers and corporate traders) go
long or short in the direction that’s opposite their borrowing or lending.
Borrowers generally want to hedge against rising interest rates, so they tend
to short the market. That way, if interest rates rise, they either reduce their
future interest-rate costs or actually profit from the situation.
177
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

Money-market funds and corporations borrow and lend millions of dollars on
a daily basis, so the short-term interest-rate market, especially in Eurodollars
and related contracts, is the way they hedge their exposure. Here’s how hedg-
ing works for the various participants:
 Lenders: Banks and other lending institutions want to hedge against
falling interest rates, so they tend to be long on the market. They know
that they’ll be lending money to someone in the future, and if interest
rates continue to fall, their profits will be reduced accordingly. By using
futures strategies, they lessen the impact of having to charge less inter-
est and thus help curtail potential future losses.
Institutions decrease their risk when they sense that rates are going to
fall by establishing long positions in bonds, T-bills, or Eurodollar futures
contracts and wanting to protect their future earnings. The money that
they make when they sell their contracts goes to the bank’s bottom line,
balancing revenue lost from lending to customers at lower interest rates.
This strategy is by no means perfect, but if it’s done correctly by the
institution, it at least cushions the blow.
 Corporate treasurers: These big-money institutions use sophisticated
formulas based on the need to protect their cash flow and future
expenses. They also hedge against the risk of adverse international and
geopolitical events and against nonpayment by high-risk customers by
using the short- and long-term interest-rate futures markets.
For example, say you’re the chief financial officer at an international
paper products company that has multiple risks, such as the price of
lumber and pulp to make paper and related products and a large cus-
tomer base in Latin America, meaning that political instability is a major
factor you must consider when running your business. By using lumber
futures and currency hedges and by varying your strategies based on
market conditions and analysis, you can decrease the risk of material
shortages and political instability to your company’s earnings.
 Speculators: Traders just like you and I always want to trade with the
trend, which is why technical analysis (see Chapter 7) is so helpful in
futures trading. By the time a tick is printed on a chart, it’s as good of a
snapshot as there is for all hedging and speculating that’s taken place up
to that instant in time.
Speculators generally trade on the long side when a particular market is
rising and then go short when the market is falling. Speculative hedging tech-
niques involve setting up option strategies that are the opposite of estab-
lished trading positions, such as buying stock index put options on the S&P
500 to hedge a long S&P position.
The same is true when you have a short position. In that case, speculators
buy call options on the S&P 500.
178
Part III: Financial Futures 

In a flat market, a speculator can write S&P 500 calls to hedge the same long
position. And you can use intermarket trades. For example, if you have a
long dollar position and you’re not sure that the market is topping out, but
you’re not quite ready to sell your position, you can consider buying a gold
call option, because gold tends to rise when the dollar falls. (For more about
speculating strategies, see Chapter 8.)
Globalizing the markets
Globalization, or essentially the spread of capitalism around the world, has
increased the number of short-term interest-rate contracts that trade at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) and around the world. Although details
of market globalization are not the focus of this chapter, you nevertheless
need to know that these contracts exist and that the volume of trades at
times is just as heavy in Eurodollars as it is in T-bills.
In fact, just about every country in the world with a convertible currency has
some kind of bond or bond futures contract that trades on an exchange
somewhere around the world. The following are not complete lists, but they
offer snapshots of some of the more liquid contracts.
Short-term global plays include the following:
 Fed funds futures: Fed funds futures trade on the CME and are an almost
pure bet on what the Federal Reserve is expected to do with future inter-
est rates. Fed funds measure interest rates that private banks charge each
other for overnight loans of excess reserves. These interbank loans usu-
ally are intended to square or balance the books of the banks involved.
The rates often are quoted in the media as a means of pricing the probabil-
ity of the Federal Reserve raising or lowering interest rates at an upcoming
meeting into the market, and they usually are accurate at doing so.
Each Fed funds contract lets you control $5 million and is cash settled.
The tick size as described by the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) is
“$20.835 per 1⁄2 of one basis point (1⁄2 of 1⁄100 of 1 percent of $5 million on a 
30-day basis rounded up to the nearest cent).” Margins are variable,
depending on the tier in which you trade, and they range from $104 to
$675. A tier is just a time frame. The longer the time frame before expira-
tion, the higher the margin. For full information, you can visit the CBOT’s
margin page at www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/page/0,3181,2142,00.
html#1b. Fed funds contracts are quoted in terms of the rate that the
market is speculating on by the time the contract expires, and they’re
based on the formula found at the CBOT: “100 minus the average daily
Fed funds overnight rate for the delivery month (for example, a 7.25 
percent rate equals 92.75).”
 LIBOR futures: These futures are one-month, interest-rate contracts
based on the London Interbank-Offered Rate (LIBOR), the interest rate
179
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

charged between commercial banks. LIBOR futures have 12 monthly list-
ings. Each contract is worth $3 million. The role of LIBOR futures is to
offer professionals a way to hedge their interest portfolio in a similar
fashion to that offered by Eurodollars. The minimum increment of price
movement is “0.0025 (1⁄4 tick = $6.25) for the front month expiring con-
tract and 0.005 (1⁄2 tick = $12.50) for all other expirations.” The major dif-
ference: Margin requirements are less for LIBOR, at $473 for initial and
$350 for margin maintenance, compared with margins of $945 and $700
for respective Eurodollar contracts. A good way for a new trader to decide
between the highly liquid and popular Eurodollar and LIBOR contracts —
which offer essentially the same type of trading opportunities — is to
paper trade both contracts after doing some homework on how each 
contract trades.
It’s easy to be put off by the large amounts of money that are held in
futures contracts, such as the $3 million in a LIBOR contract. No matter
what contract you trade, though, you need to think in terms of short
holding periods, especially if the position is moving against you.
Consider how much you may actually have to pay up (if you’re long) if
you don’t sell before the contract rolls over (the amount specified by
the contract — $3 million). Small traders usually trade Eurodollars,
while pros with large sums and more experience tend to trade LIBOR.
See the section on “Playing the Short End of the Curve: Eurodollars & 
T-Bills,” later in this chapter.
 Euroyen contracts: These contracts represent Japanese yen deposits
held outside of Japan. Open positions in these contracts can be held at
CME or at the SIMEX exchange in Singapore. Euroyen contracts are
listed quarterly, trade monthly, and offer expiration dates as far out as
three years. That long-term time frame can be useful to professional
hedgers with specific expectations about the future.
 CETES futures: These 28-day and 91-day futures contracts are based on
Mexican Treasury bills. These instruments are denominated and paid
in Mexican pesos, and they reflect the corresponding benchmark rates
of interest rates in Mexico.
Longer-term global plays include Eurobond futures. The Eurobond market is
composed of bonds issued by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Swiss
Confederation that usually are the second most traded bond futures con-
tracts in volume after the U.S. Treasury bonds. On some days, however, they
can trade larger volumes than U.S. Treasuries.
Eurobonds come in four different categories: Euro Shatz, Euro Bobl, Euro
Bund, and Euro Buxl. The duration on each respective category is 1.75 years,
4.5 to 5.5 years, 8.5 to 10.5 years, and 24 to 35 years. The contract size is for
100,000 euros or 100,000 Swiss francs, depending on the issuer. Eurobonds
can be traded in the United States. The basic strategies are similar to U.S.
bonds, because they trade on economic fundamentals and inflationary expec-
tations, and they respond to European economic reports similar to the way
U.S. bonds respond to U.S. reports.
180
Part III: Financial Futures 

Some particulars about Eurobond futures:
 Foreigners hold half of all Euro Bunds.
 Euro Bunds are the most active Eurobond contract traded at the totally
electronic Eurex Exchange in Frankfurt.
 Both Euro-Schatz and Euro-Bobl contracts rank in the top ten of all
futures contracts in global trading volume.
Yielding to the Curve
The yield curve is a representation on a graph that compares the entire spec-
trum of interest rates available to investors. Figures 10-1 and 10-2, respec-
tively, are excellent illustrations of the U.S. Treasury yield curve and rate
structure at a time when inflationary expectations are under control and the
economy is growing steadily. The curve and the table are from July 1, 2005,
just two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for the ninth con-
secutive time in a 12-month period.
Figure 10-2 depicts a standard, table-style snapshot of all market maturities
for the U.S. Treasury. You can view an up-to-date version at bonds.yahoo.
com/rates.html.
As you review Figures 10-1 and 10-2, notice the following:
 The longer the maturity, the higher the yield: That relationship is normal
for interest-paying securities, because you’re lending your money to
someone for an extended period of time, and you want them to pay you
a premium for the extra risk.
 The yield on all securities rose: Starting with the 3-month Treasury bill
(T-bill) and ending with the 30-year bond, all yields rose, compared with
the previous week and month, after the Fed raised interest rates. That’s
because the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), in remarks made
after announcing the most recent rate increase in the Fed funds rate, told
the market that inflation was controlled, but economic growth still war-
ranted a “measured” pace of continuing interest-rate increases. To a bond
trader, that meant that the Fed would continue raising interest rates until
it otherwise saw fit, and it meant that the economic perceptions of the
bond market and the Fed were in agreement.
Had the bond market disagreed with the Fed, yields for longer-term maturi-
ties would have fallen, because the bond market would be signaling to the
Fed that the economy was starting to slow and that it (the Fed) needed to
consider taking a pause or even ending its rate hikes.

Deciding Your Time Frame
From a trader’s standpoint, you want to consider trading the short term, the
intermediate term, or the long term.
Each position has its own time, place, and reasoning, ranging from how much
money you have to trade, your individual risk tolerance, and whether your
analysis leads you to think that the particular area of the curve can move

A quick and dirty rule of thumb is that the longer the maturity, the greater
the potential reaction to good or bad news on inflation. In other words, the
further out you go on the curve, the greater the chance for volatility.
Eurodollars are the best instrument for trading the short term, because they
are liquid investments, meaning that they’re easy to buy and sell because the
market has a large number of participants. The opposite of a liquid market is
a thin market, in which the number of participants tends to be smaller, the
spread between bid and offer prices tends to be farther apart, and the poten-
tial for volatility is larger. Grain markets can be thin markets (see Chapter 16).
For long- and intermediate-term trading, you can use the 10-year T-note and
30-year T-bond futures.
Eurodollars are well suited for small traders, because margin requirements
tend to be smaller, and the movements can be less volatile; however, don’t
consider those attractive factors a guarantee of success by any means. Any
futures contract can be a quick road to ruin if you become careless.
Ten-year T-note and T-bond futures can be quite volatile, because large
traders and institutions usually use them for direct trading and for compli-
cated hedging strategies.
You can use options for trading all of these interest-rate products by applying
the basic options rules and strategies described in Chapters 4 and 5.
Shaping the curve
Several informative shapes can be seen on the yield curve. Three important
ones are
 Normal curves: The normal curve rises to the right, and short-term 
interest rates are lower than long-term interest rates. Pretty simple, eh?
Economists usually look at this kind of movement as a sign of normal eco-
nomic activity, where growth is ongoing and investors are being rewarded
for taking more risks by being given extra yield in longer-term maturities.
 Flat curves: A flat curve is when short-term yields are equal or close to
long-term yields. This type of graph can be a sign that the economy is
slowing down, or that the Federal Reserve has been raising short-term
rates.
 Inverted curves: An inverted curve shows long-term rates falling below
short-term rates, which can happen when the market is betting on a
slowing of the economy or during a financial crisis when traders are
flocking to the safety of long-term U.S. Treasury bonds.
183
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

Checking out the yield curve
By keeping track of the yield curve, you’re achieving several goals that Mark
Powers describes in Starting Out In Futures Trading (Probus Publishing). By
checking out the yield curve, you can
 Focus on the cash markets. Doing so enables you to put activity in the
futures markets in perspective and provides clues to the relationship
between prices in the futures markets.
 Watch for prices rising or falling below the yield curve, indications that
can be good opportunities to buy or sell a security.
 Know that prices above the yield curve point to a relatively underpriced
market.
 Know that prices below the curve point to a relatively overpriced market.
Sound Interest-Rate Trading Rules
Interest-rate futures serve one major function. They enable large institutions
to neutralize or manage their price risks.
As an investor or speculator who trades interest-rate futures, you look at the
markets differently than banks and other commercial borrowers. The 
interest-rate market is a way for them to hedge their risk, but for you, it’s a
way to make money based on the system’s inefficiencies, which often are cre-
ated by the current relationship between large hedgers, the Fed, and other
major players, such as foreign governments.
A perfect example of an inefficient market is when a large corporation wants
to sell a big bundle of bonds but can’t seem to find buyers. As market bids
raise the yields on the bond offering, treasury prices may fall as some players
sell treasury bonds to raise money to buy the corporate bonds.
That kind of situation arises occasionally and can create volatility. Some-
times, short-term gyrations can offer entry points into the bond market on
the long and the short sides, depending, of course, on the prevailing market
and the price trends at the time.
Generally, you want watch for the following:
 Opportunities to trade the long-term issues when interest rates are falling
 Opportunities to stay on the shorter-term side of the curve when inter-
est rates are rising
184
Part III: Financial Futures 

Nevertheless, regardless of rules or general tendencies of markets, focusing
on what’s happening at the moment and trading what you see are important
guidelines to follow.
When trading international interest-rate contracts, you must consider the
effects of currency conversion. If you just made a 10-percent profit trading
Eurobunds, but the Euro fell 10 percent, your purchasing power has not grown.
When getting ready to trade, make sure that you do the following:
 Calculate your margin requirements. Doing so enables you to know how
much of a cushion for potential losses you have available before you get
a margin call and are required to put up more money to keep a position
open. Never put yourself in a position to receive a margin call.
 Price in how much of your account’s equity you plan to risk before you
make your trade.
 Canvass your charts so that you know support and resistance levels on
each of the markets that you plan to trade, and then you can set your
entry points above or below those levels, depending, of course, on
which way the market breaks.
 Be ready for trend reversals. Although you need to trade with the trend,
you also must be ready for reversals, especially when the market
appears to be comfortable with its current trend.
 Understand what the economic calendar has in store on any given day.
Knowing the potential for economic indicators of the day to move the
market in either direction prepares you for the major volatility that can
occur on the day they’re released.
 Pick your entry and exit points, including your worst-loss scenario —
the possibility of taking a margin call.
 Decide what your options are if your trade goes well and you have a sig-
nificant profit to deal with.
Playing the Short End of the Curve:
Eurodollars & T-Bills
When you trade the short end of the curve, you’re using Eurodollars, T-bills,
LIBOR, or short-term Eurobond futures as your trading vehicle.
Treasury bills and Eurodollars are not the same thing, although they are
expressions of short-term interest rates and trade in the same direction.
You can lose money trading T-bill futures, just as you can when you trade
Eurodollar futures.
185
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

Eurodollar basics
A Eurodollar is a dollar-denominated deposit held in a non-U.S. bank. A
Eurodollar contract gives you control of $1 million Eurodollars and is a 
reflection of the LIBOR rate for a three-month, $1-million offshore deposit.
Eurodollars are popular trading instruments that have been around since
1981. Following are some facts about Eurodollars that you need to know:
 A tick is the unit of movement for all futures contracts, but in the case
of Eurodollars, a point = one tick = 0.1 = $25. If you own a Eurodollar 
contract, and it falls or rises four ticks, or 0.4, you either lose or gain
$100, respectively. Eurodollars can trade in 1⁄4 or 1⁄2 points, which are
worth $6.25 and $12.50, respectively.
 Eurodollar prices are a central rate in global business and are quoted in
terms of an index. For example, if the price on the futures contract is
$9,200, the yield is 8 percent.
 Eurodollars trade on the CME with contract listings in March, June,
September, and December. Different Eurodollar futures contracts suit 
different time frames. Some enable you to trade more than two years
from the current date. This kind of long-term betting on short-term 
interest rates is rare, but sometimes large corporations use it. For full
details, it’s always good to check with your broker about which con-
tracts are available, or go to the CME Web site.
 Trading hours for Eurodollars are from 7:20 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time
on the trading floor, but they can be traded almost 24/7 on Globex,
the electronic trading home of a large variety of futures contracts. For
Eurodollars, Globex is a shut down only between 4 and 5 p.m. nightly.
 The initial margin, or the minimum you’d need in your account as of
June 20, 2005, to trade a single Eurodollar contract at CME was $945 for
nonexchange members. The maintenance margin, or the minimum you
need in your account to keep the trade going, was $700.
Trading Eurodollars
Eurodollars are the most popular futures trading contract in the world,
because they offer reasonably low margins and the potential for fairly good
return in a short period of time.
You want to trade Eurodollars when events are occurring that are likely to
influence interest rates. If you grasp the concept of trading Eurodollars, you’re
also set to trade other types of interest-rate futures, as long as you understand
186
Part III: Financial Futures 

that each individual contract is going to have its own special quirks and idio-
syncrasies. The CME provides a good overview of all of its interest-rate con-
tracts online in a PDF file called How to Get Started Trading CME Interest Rate
Products at www.cme.com/files/I19_How_to_Interest.pdf.
If you trade interest-rate futures, here are some basic factors to keep in mind:
 Check the overall trend of the market.
 Consider whether the market is oversold or overbought.
 Decide how much you’re willing to risk before you enter the trade.
 Look at the overall background for the trade you’re going to execute
before doing so.
Picking your spot to trade
A good opportunity for trading Eurodollars futures was the week ending 
July 1, 2005, when the economic calendar was heavy in terms of the number
of releases and their importance regarding what the Fed was likely to do next
with interest rates. Included on the calendar, the Fed had a two-day meeting
scheduled at which it was widely expected to raise interest rates.
Aside from the Fed’s announcement on interest rates the afternoon of June
30, the economic calendar featured two particularly tradable reports on 
July 1: the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and the Institute
for Supply Management (ISM — purchasing manager’s) report. Each is a key
barometer of activity for a major cog in the economic food chain.
The Fed raised interest rates on June 30 and told the markets that they could
expect them to be raising rates again in the future. Economic reports all
showed signs of a strengthening economy. And the markets were poised for
such a set of developments.
Figure 10-3 shows three months’ worth of trading in the July 2005 Eurodollar
contract. Note that the price break below the moving average, the thin line
between the price bars, correctly predicted a fall in prices. Also note the over-
all downtrend in the Eurodollar during the three-month period, which is a sign
of rising interest rates. The implied (interest) rate for this contract at the close
on July 1 was 3.6175 percent, up from 3.40 in May. You can calculate the
implied rate by subtracting the contract price from 100, as described in the
earlier “Globalizing the markets” section.
You want to trade with the trend, so the path of least resistance in this trade
was to go short. (See Chapters 7, 8, and 20 for more information about going
short.)
187
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

Eurodollars trade almost around the clock, so great gains from a good intra-
day session can be wiped out or significantly reduced if a major event hap-
pens overnight. All futures that trade on Globex or other electronic
round-the-clock systems are affected in the same way.
Managing your trade
Assume for a moment that you shorted one contract when the price slipped
below the four-day moving average on June 27 so that your order was filled at
the close of the regular session at 9,642. To protect yourself and cover your
short position, you put a buy stop five ticks above the moving average, thus
limiting your loss to $125 above the crossover price. Thereafter, you adjust
the stop on a daily basis to protect your gains based on your risk tolerance.
In this example, I use broad numbers, but you need to set your stop in a way
that you don’t risk a margin call if the trade goes against you. In other words,
in this trade, your losses need to be limited to no more than $245 (roughly a
ten-tick loss), because a $245 loss will get you a margin call if all you had to
start with was the minimum margin of $945.
Setting your stop a good distance from the margin call is a good idea,
though, to allow some leeway in case the market moves fast against you.
The more room between your stop and the margin call, the better you are.
The more you trade, the more you’ll develop a sense of what your risk
tolerance is.

A stop is not a guarantee that you’ll get out of a position at the point specified
by your stop-loss order. Sometimes you get the closest price to the stop,
depending on market conditions. See Chapter 3 for a review of different types
of orders.
The trade that I describe in this section is a high-risk and purely hypothetical
trade that’s intended only to illustrate how to manage your margin and how
the Eurodollar market works. You should never trade any futures contract
unless you have enough equity in your account to do so, which in this case
you don’t.
As a general rule, you should never risk any more than 5 percent of your equity
on any one trade with a small account. The bare minimum requirement for
trading futures as an individual small speculator is widely accepted to be no
less than $20,000. See Chapters 17, 18, and 19 to review trading plans and
strategies.
By the close of trading July 1, after a five-day holding period, the gain on the
hypothetical trade was $937. If you had $945 in your account as your only
margin, you essentially would have doubled your money.
During this trade, your margin never fell to $700, because you set your stop
to get you out before you got a margin call.
A 1-point move in the July Eurodollar contract (Figure 10-3) is worth $2,500
per contract. This move is huge, so I’m only using it to illustrate the big 
picture.
If you happened to be short, or betting on falling Eurodollar prices, like in
the example, a fall of this size would make you a good profit. If you were long,
or betting on higher prices, you’d lose $2,500. In reality, if you used good risk-
management techniques, such as a trailing stop like the one described in the
example that accompanies Figure 10-3, you wouldn’t let a Eurodollar contract
move against you that far. See Chapter 17 for more about trading plans.
At this point, the example trade has earned a nice profit of 3.75 ticks, or
$93.75 per contract over five days. So right before a three-day July 4th holi-
day weekend, when the Group of Eight was meeting in London with large
numbers of demonstrators present, and a nine-country rock concert was
planned to raise awareness for the famine in Africa, you could have
 Closed the position and taken your profits, less commissions.
 Tightened your short covering stop by setting it at 9641.05, just above
the closing price (9,640.0625) on Figure 10-3.
189
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

 Sold a portion of your position if you had more than one contract, taking
a part of your profits and adjusting the remaining position by tightening
your stop.
 Considered establishing option strategies. In this case, because you’re
short, a call option would be the correct move. A put option would be
the correct choice if you were long, because a put option generally rises
in price when the market falls. (See Chapter 3 to find out how to select
options.)
By now, you’re probably wondering what to do if you’re the subject of a
margin call. For starters, you need to follow a good rule of thumb used by
professionals: Never risk more than 50 percent of your total account equity
when trading. For example, if you had followed that rule, you never would
have bought the one Eurodollar contract in the example above, because you
had only $945 in your account. Assuming that you had more money, and you
made a good trade, in the future, you’d still buy one Eurodollar contract and
keep 50 percent of your equity in your account.
If you do get a margin call, you can
 Liquidate your position to meet the call and then take a break for a few
days until you get your wits back together.
 Sell some of your position to meet the call.
 Deposit new money into your account to meet the call.
Plan your trades so that you never get a margin call. That’s the best way.
Do it by carefully following the rules outlined in this section, having enough
money in your account, never risking more than 10 percent of your equity
on any one position (5 percent if your account’s small), and calculating your
maximum risk while keeping it below the amount that results in a margin call.
Trading Treasury-bill futures
A 13-week T-bill contract is considered a risk-free obligation of the U.S. gov-
ernment. In the cash market, T-bills are sold in $10,000 increments, such that
if you paid $9,600 for a T-bill in the cash market, an annualized interest rate
of 4 percent is implied. At the end of the three months (13 weeks), you’d get
$10,000 in return.
Risk free means that if you buy the T-bills, you’re assured of getting paid by
the U.S. government. Trading T-bill futures, on the other hand, is not risk free.
Instead, T-bill futures trades essentially are governed by the same sort of risk
rules that govern Eurodollar trades. T-bill futures
190
Part III: Financial Futures 

 Are 3-month (13-week) contracts based on $10,000 U.S. Treasury bills.
 Have a face value at maturity of $1,000,000.
 Move in 1⁄2-point increments (1⁄2 point = 0.005 = $12.50) with trading
months of March, June, September, and December.
Trading Bonds and Treasury Notes
The 10-year U.S. Treasury note has been the accepted benchmark for long-
term interest rates since the U.S. stopped issuing the long bond (30-year U.S.
Treasury bond) in October 2001. Thirty-year bond futures and 30-year T-bonds
(issued before 2001) still are actively traded, and the U.S. Treasury announced
in August 2005 that new 30-year T-bonds were going to be issued and hit the
market in February 2006.
Ten-year T-note yields are the key for setting long-term mortgage rates. By
watching this interest rate, you can pinpoint the best entry times for remort-
gaging, relocating, or buying rental property, and you can keep tabs on
whether your broker is quoting you a good rate.
What you’re getting into
Bond and note futures are big-time trading vehicles that move fast. Each tick
or price quote, especially when you hold more than one contract and the
market is moving fast, can be worth several hundred dollars. Some other facts
about 10- and 30-year interest-rate futures that you need to know include that
they are
 Traded under the symbols TY for pit trading and ZN for electronic trading
in the 10-year contract.
 Valued at $100,000 per contract, the same as for a 30-year bond
contract (which is traded under the symbol US for pit trading and ZB
for electronic trading).
 Longer-term debt futures that have higher margin requirements
than Eurodollars. As of June 2005, the initial margin for 10-year and 
30-year note and bond contracts, respectively, were $1,013 and
$1,553. Maintenance margins, respectively, were $750 and $1,150
per contract.
191
Chapter 10: Wagging the Dog: Interest-Rate Futures

 Quoted in terms of 32nds and that one point is $1,000 and one tick must
be at least
• 1⁄2 of 1⁄32, or $15.625, for a ten-year issue.
• 1⁄32, or $31.25, for a 30-year issue.
When a price quote is “84-16,” it means the price of the contract is 84
and 16⁄32 for both, and the value is $84,500.
 Traded on the CME from 7:20 a.m. to 2 p.m. central time Monday
through Friday. Electronic trades can be made from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. cen-
tral time Sunday through Friday.
Trading in expiring contracts closes at noon central time (Chicago time)
on the last trading day, which is the seventh business day before the last
business day of the delivery month.
U.S. note and bond futures have no price limits.
What you’ll get if you take delivery
If you take delivery, your contract will be wired to you on the last business day
of the delivery month via the Federal Reserve book-entry wire-transfer system.
What you get delivered to you, as of June 2005, is a series of U.S. Treasury
bonds that either cannot be retired for at least 15 years from the first day of the
delivery month or that are not callable with a maturity of at least 15 years from
the first day of the delivery month. The invoice price, or the amount that you’ll
have to tender, equals the futures settlement price multiplied by a conversion
factor with accrued interest added. The conversion factor used is the price of
the delivered bond ($1 par value) to yield 6 percent.
Bonds that are not callable remain in circulation until full maturity, which
means that the holder receives all the interest payments until the bond
expires, when the principle is returned. Callable bonds put the holder at risk
of receiving less interest because of an earlier retirement of the bond than
the holder had planned.
For T-notes, you’d receive a package of U.S. Treasury notes that mature from
61⁄2 to 10 years from the first day of the delivery month. The price is calcu-
lated by using a formula that you can find on the CBOE Web site. As a small
speculator, your chances of getting a delivery are nil.
Figures 10-4 and 10-5 show the ten-year U.S. T-note futures for December
2005. Figure 10-4 shows a good example of a moving-average trading system
during the same time period featured in the Eurodollar sections earlier.
192
Part III: Financial Futures 

During the time frame shown in Figure 10-4, even as Eurodollars and short-term
instruments fell in price, longer-term instruments rallied because the market
continued to believe that higher short-term interest rates eventually would
slow down the economy. Elsewhere in the mix were pressures from hedge
funds, foreign governments, and big traders setting up huge derivative trades
in the options market. The overall effect, however, was to keep long-term inter-
est rates going down and bond prices rising on the long end of the curve.
In June, after the ninth interest rate increase by the Fed, the market decided
that the economy was likely to keep strengthening and that the Fed would
keep raising rates. According to bond trader rules, rate increases in a strong
economy spell a strong sign of inflation and a reason to sell bonds. Other fac-
tors that are evident in Figures 10-4 and 10-5 include the following:
 T-note futures rose during the period of interest rate increases until the
month of June, when the contract began to struggle. In the cash bond
market, long-term rates had been falling until the same time period when
they became volatile.
 The trend was above the trio of moving averages — the 5-day, the 20-
day, and the 10-day — much of the time.
 An excellent entry point is found in April in Figure 10-4 where the 5-day
moving average crosses over the 10-day and the 20-day moving averages.
Buying a portion of your position at the first crossover is a common prac-
tice when using the moving average crossover as a trading method. You
then buy the second portion of the position at the second crossover. You
could have bought as the 5-day average crossed over the 10-day average,
and again when the 10-day average crossed over the 20-day average.

 The uptrend stayed intact until June, so reversing the crossover is just
as easy as the chart points out. You can also hedge your position if
you’re unsure whether the crossover is temporary or you’re seeing a
significant top by buying a put option.
 The break below all three moving averages was clear in late June, giving
you an opportunity to sell short.
 You need to use trailing stops when trading all futures contracts so that
even when you aren’t sure whether a top was reached, you nevertheless
are stopped out when the price falls below the three moving averages.
Figure 10-5 highlights the use of good trend-line analysis. Take note of the 
following:
 A double top in bond prices and a key break below the rising trend
line. Note that when the Fed raised interest rates June 30, bond prices
failed to close above the previous day’s intraday high price, a signal that
the market was exhausted. Sure enough, it closed significantly lower the
next day.
 The price on July 1. Closing within the gap is a good example of how
gaps become magnets for price reversals at some point in the future.
 The 116 support level. Your next indicator to watch is when the market
tests the 116 key-support area. If you shorted the break in prices below
118, you’d be looking to cover at least some of your short position by
buying the contract back and specifying that you are doing so with
intent to cover the short position or buying some call options to hedge
your position near that area.

I
n a global economy, investors have come to realize that stocks and bonds
are not the only games in town. Currencies are among the fastest growing
segments of the capital markets.
Aside from the currency futures, foreign currencies trade in a busy spot
market. In fact, explaining how much of the action in currencies takes place
in the spot market takes up a good portion of this chapter.
The major goals of this chapter are to introduce you to the currency market,
provide a broad overview of the important role it plays in forging relationships
between other markets, and give you a good sound base from which to expand
your foreign exchange (or as it’s known in the business . . . forex) activities.
My first experience in the currency markets was with trading the U.S. dollar
index. I broke all the rules and lost some money, but I discovered some valu-
able lessons that have enabled me to make some profitable trades since then.
These days, because of time commitments and a general distaste for volatility,
I still trade currencies, but I do so by using mutual funds, a nice development
in the evolution of trading that enables me to participate in a market that I
truly love while not having to suffer the hair-raising action that can go along
with directly trading currencies and currency futures.

If that sounds like your cup of tea, be sure to check out the currency mutual-
fund timing system that I explain on my Web site at Joe-Duarte.com,
because I use my fund trades as guides for the timing system. For now,
though, I’ll stick to the currency markets in a more traditional style.
Understanding Foreign Exchange Rates
Foreign exchange rates are influenced by internal and external factors. Internal
factors can be as simple as determining whether a country has specific controls
or limits on its currency. The most current example of a controlled currency
is the Chinese yuan, which the Chinese government maintains in a narrow trad-
ing band. Other global currencies, especially the ones coming from emerging
markets and less developed countries, also are controlled by their respective
governments. External factors deal mostly with trade issues (disputes) or the
market’s perception of the political and economic situation in a given country.
Of course, wars and natural disasters also qualify as potential market-moving
events.
The most important influences on currency values are
 Interest rates: As a rule, higher interest rates lead to higher currency
prices.
 Inflation rates: Higher inflation tends to lead to a weaker currency. This
general rule doesn’t apply when the rate of inflation is leading a country’s
central bank to raise interest rates. In that case, despite higher inflation,
the markets are likely to bid up that country’s currency as they expect
interest rates there to continue to rise.
 Current account status: Countries that tend to export more than they
import tend to have stronger currencies than countries that import more
than they export. This relationship is soft, however, because some coun-
tries, such as Japan, purposely keep their respective currencies weak by
selling them in the open market just to keep their exports high. These
countries don’t export their currencies; instead, their central banks sell
them into the open market by making trades just like any other trading
desk. The net effect is to increase the amount of a country’s currency that
is floating in the markets, thus decreasing its value to indirectly affect the
balance of trade.
 Budget status: Countries with budget surpluses, again, as a general rule,
tend to have stronger currencies than countries with budget deficits.
This rule also is soft, because it doesn’t hold up all the time. For exam-
ple, the United States (U.S.) has chronic budget and current-account
deficits, but the U.S. dollar experiences long rallies in which its strength
is quite impressive.

 Political stability: Along with interest rates and economic fundamentals,
politics are more than likely the most consistent determinants of the
exchange rates that are quoted on a regular basis. Despite a fairly strong
economy, an otherwise strong dollar during the Clinton administration
suffered during the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
Exploring Basic Spot-Market Trading
The spot market is where most of the currency trading is done. It’s operated
nearly exclusively by large banks and corporations. Here’s the lowdown on
the basics of the spot market:
 Trades on the spot market are made continuously Monday through
Friday, starting in New Zealand and following the sun to Sydney, Tokyo,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Frankfurt, Geneva, Zurich, Paris,
London, New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles before starting again.
 When big banks and institutions trade currencies on the spot market,
they are usually exchanging your currency with another individual party.
Both parties usually know and recognize each other.
 One third of foreign exchange transactions in the world are done on an
over-the-counter basis in the spot forex market, with no exchange being
involved. Over-the-counter trades are made directly between two indi-
viduals or institutions, usually by phone.
 The interbank market, where most of the transactions in the spot market
take place between banks and corporations, is a network of banks that
serve as intermediaries or market makers or wholesalers. Participants
buy and sell currencies in the interbank markets, where trades are settled
within two days. The two-day settlement is fair to both parties, allowing
plenty of time for money to change hands, considering the amount of time
it sometimes takes to gather large sums together in one place.
 The retail market is where the rest of the currency transactions take
place. Individual traders conduct these trades over the phone and via
the Internet by using brokers as intermediaries. Settlement on the retail
market is defined as the transaction day plus one day.
Dabbling in da forex lingo
Like anything else in life, foreign exchange (forex) has its own language, and
your currency trading skills will grow faster when you get the terms right
early on, that is, before risking your money-making trades in this volatile but
mostly sensible market.

Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies

Foreign exchange transactions are exchanges between two pairings of cur-
rencies, with each currency having its own International Standardization
Organization (ISO) code. The ISO code identifies the country and its currency
using three letters. The pairing uses the ISO codes for each participating cur-
rency. For example, USD/GBP pairs the U.S. dollar and the British pound. In
this case, the dollar is the base currency, and the pound is the secondary cur-
rency. Displayed the other way, GBP/USD, the pound is the base currency, and
the dollar is secondary.
My favorite thing about currencies is the pip, the smallest move any currency
can make. It means the same thing as a tick for other futures and asset
classes. Incidentally, there is no mention of whether Gladys Knight trades
currencies anywhere, with or without The Pips.
The four major currency pairings are
 EUR/USD = euro/U.S. dollar
 GBP/USD = British pound sterling/U.S. dollar (also known as cable)
 USD/JPY = U.S. dollar/Japanese yen
 USD/CHF = U.S. dollar/Swiss franc
When you read an exchange rate that’s quoted on a screen, you’re reading
how much of one currency can be exchanged for another. If you see
GBP/USD = 1.7550, that means you can exchange one British pound for
1.7550 dollars. The base currency is the pound; it’s the one that you’re
either buying or selling.
When you trade currencies, you are, in effect, buying one currency and simul-
taneously selling another, or vice versa.
When you view a trading screen, you see a frame with two prices. One side is
marked “sell” and gives you the selling price, and the other side is marked
“buy” and gives you the buying price.
If you want to sell, you click on the sell side. If you want to buy, you click on
the buy side. To reverse or close out your trade, you do the opposite of your
current position.
Currency on the spot market is bought and sold in groups made up of 100,000
units of the base currency. On the spot market, buyer and seller are required
to deposit a margin, which usually is 1 to 5 percent of the entire value of the
trade. In other words, if you buy 100,000 GBP/USD at 1.7550, you’d put down
the appropriate margin in dollars, while the seller of sterling, who is buying
your dollars, would reciprocate by putting down an appropriate margin in
sterling.
198
Part III: Financial Futures 

Location, location, location
Some special currency trading issues are dependent upon where your dealer
is located. If you’re trading in the spot market, and your dealer is in the U.S.,
you deposit your margin in dollars. If, however, you’re trading through a for-
eign dealer or using a currency other than the one required by the broker,
you have to convert your capital and margin requirements to the currency of
the foreign dealer. Each situation is different, but you need to check out all
the variables before making any trades.
Here’s how it works: If you’re trading the USD/JPY (U.S. dollar/Japanese yen)
pair, the value of your trade will be calculated in yen, JPY. If your broker uses
the dollar as his home currency, then your profits and losses in this trade are
converted back to dollars at the relevant USD/JPY offer rate.
Although trading currencies may seem confusing, you can work it out by
carefully studying exchange rates and doing some practice trades. Most
online currency dealers will enable you to open a practice account so that
many of the nuances of trading currencies become self-evident with practice.
Don’t get cross over crossrates
Crossrates are the exchange rates between non-U.S. dollar currency pairings.
Andy Shearman of Trader House Network, www.traderhouse.net, offers a
nice example of how crosses work. I’ve adapted it below to show the cross
between the pound sterling and the Swiss franc, and your trading screen
shows the following crossrates:
 EUR/USD = 1.0060/65
 GBP/USD = 1.5847/52
 USD/JPY = 120.25/30
 USD/CHF = 1.4554/59
These four pairings are key crossrates. For example, the GBP/USD pairing is
the bid (1.5847) and ask (1.5852) price for the British pound sterling and the
U.S. dollar exchange rate at the moment. The difference between them, 0.0005,
is the spread, which amounts to the commission that the dealer collects.
So to calculate the GBP/CHF (British pound for Swiss franc) crossrate, do the
following steps:
1. Find the GBP/USD exchange rate.
Bid: 1.5847 Offer (ask): 1.5852
2. Find the USD/CHF exchange rate.
Bid: 1.4554 Offer: 1.4559
199
Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies

3. Multiply the bid amount for the GBP/USD exchange rate with the same
for the USD/CHF exchange rate, and then do the same with the offer
amounts.
1.5847 × 1.4554 = 2.3063 and 1.5852 × 1.4559 = 2.3079
4. Jot down the answers.
GBP/CHF = 2.3063/2.3079
The calculations work for all currencies if you follow these steps. Foreign
exchange quotation services and trading software also give you the amounts,
but perhaps a little quicker.
Electronic spot trading
Aside from traditional phone-based trading, you can trade currencies in the
spot market electronically, but you need to be prepared to sit in front of your
screen and manage your trade actively; otherwise, you risk losing large sums
rapidly.
You also need to know that you’ll pay more for trading currencies in the spot
market than the pros do. That’s because you’re a little guy, and they’re not.
That’s the way of the world, and you need to know that before you get into
trading anything.
Something else to keep in mind is that some foreign-currency Web sites and
brokers will tell you that trading on their site is commission free. That isn’t
true. They do collect a fee that amounts to the spread between the bid and
ask prices on the currency quotes.
If you keep that in mind, you’ll save yourself a lot of grief, and can get on with
trading.
Getting your charts together before you trade
If you’re going to trade forex, you’ll need a good command of technical analy-
sis. You can apply the principles of technical analysis that I discuss in
Chapter 7, because the same general principles and indicators apply to for-
eign exchange rates.
Some particulars about the forex that you need to keep in mind are that curren-
cies tend to trend for a long time, usually months to even years, but within the
major long-term trends (see Figure 11-1), countertrend moves usually occur,
and a large degree of intraday volatility is common. Some other factors
common to long-term currency trends like the one seen in Figure 11-1 include
200
Part III: Financial Futures 

 Long-term bull (and bear) markets can last for years. The bull market
for the euro seen in Figure 11-1 lasted four years.
 Trend indicators work well in the currency markets. Note the 
intermediate-term tops marked by the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI)
and its nice correlation with the MACD oscillator. See Chapter 7 for more
about oscillators.
 Trend lines are especially useful. Note how the bull market clearly
ended when the four-year trend line was broken.
Likewise, note how the double-top failure marked on the chart corresponds
with the failure in the RSI and the break below the zero line on the MACD. A
momentum failure, coupled with major breaks in the trend indicators and a
break below a four-year rising trend line, was a clear sell signal.
Using long-term charts to track currencies is a great way to trade forex instru-
ments. The long-term charts are your guides to the prevailing trend; however,
within those long-term trends, you can find significant countertrend ebb and
flow, during which you can trade against the long-term trend by
 Going long, or buying when the long-term chart is pointing up.
 Looking for opportunities to go short when the long-term trend is down.
 Using shorter-term charts to guide your shorter-term trades, both long
and short.

Countertrend moves are an ever-present part of the market that require
adjustments. As such, you always need to keep the long-term trend in mind
so you don’t grow too comfortable trading in the wrong direction, or counter
to the long-term trend line.
When a currency breaks below a long-rising trend line, you must consider
that the long-term trend has changed direction. The trend may not change
every time this situation occurs. In fact, some markets return to the original
trend soon after a break. A countertrend rally is another possible trading sce-
nario. In a countertrend rally, the market remains in a long-term up- or down-
trend, but trades in the opposite direction for a short to intermediate period
of time can last for days, weeks, or even months before returning to the long-
term trend.
You can see a countertrend rally in Figure 11-2, which shows a one-year chart
of the euro that focuses on the last year of trading pictured in Figure 11-1.
The vertical line in the middle of the chart connects these three key points:
 The reversal of the euro
 A bottom in the RSI indicator
 A bottom in the MACD indicator

Long-term charts are best used for keeping an eye on the big picture. When
you see something that looks small on a long-term chart, use a short-term
chart to magnify the time frame. Figure 11-2 magnifies the double top and
momentum failure in Figure 11-1. When you look at the shorter-term chart,
the momentum failure looks much clearer, and your decision-making there-
fore is enhanced.
Take your long-term charts seriously. If you’ve been trading in a certain direc-
tion for weeks or months, you’re bound to get a fairly good reversal. Any rever-
sal can be big enough to change the long-term trend, so you can play every
reversal as one that may be the big one. In Figures 11-1 and 11-2, the long-term
charts were correct, even though the one-year chart was less sensitive.
Keep your time frames in perspective. Intraday charts are useful for short-
term trading. What looks like a major trend reversal on a three-day chart
using 15-minute candlesticks may not amount to much in the big picture. But
it’s enough of a shift for you to use your short-term strategy.
Setting up your trading rig
Currency trading is heavy metal, so like heavy-metal bands, you need some
serious hardware and software to keep your shirt on and your trousers dry.
Top on that list of needs is an electronic brokerage service that enables you
to do straight through processing (STP), where you trade directly with the
dealer through your computer using integrated quotations and transactional
and administrative functionality. You can gain access to STP through your
online broker, and you can gain access to a decent system through many online
brokerage-services providers. You can find other online brokerages that offer
STP by using your favorite online search engine.
You need to evaluate different brokers before deciding on one. A good elec-
tronic brokerage service gives you access to live, streaming data and enables
you to make direct trades through your broker’s Web site.
Most online brokers offer plenty of free goodies that you can look at to get a
feel for how the forex markets work. They also offer free real-time quotes and a
good basic charting service that you can use. Here are a couple of good ones:
 Electronic Brokering Services (EBS — www.ebs.com)
 Pronet Analytics (www.pronetanalytics.com)
 Nostradamus (www.nostradamus.co.uk)
I also maintain a good Web page with currency information on my Web site’s
directory. You can visit my site at www.joe-duarte.com/free/directory/
software-forex.asp.

Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies

Here are some other essentials for forex trading:
 A reliable margin account broker. For details on margin and how to
choose a broker, see Chapters 3, 4, and 17.
 A fast and reliable Internet connection. You need a good, reliable, broad-
band connection with your computer terminal dedicated to trading —
not instant messaging for your teenager or educational stuff for your
homeschooler.
 A big-time computer system on which you can run several big programs
at the same time without crashing. You need as much memory and stor-
age as you can muster. A gigabyte of RAM (random access memory) is a
good start, but if you’re going to run multiple monitors, you may need
more, plus the setup for it. You need a good printer for printing your state-
ments and a good backup system. If you plan to take a break and keep a
position open, a good Wi-Fi setup for a laptop is a good idea. You also
need all the security — antivirus, firewall, and spyware protection — that
you can muster to keep your personal data from being stolen.
 Good trading software on which you can open and manage positions and
conduct big-time technical analysis.
 Separate computer monitors, so you can
• Handle market data
• Submit dealing instructions
• Look at charts and indicators all at once to keep tabs on all your
open positions
• Adjust your stops and place other orders
• Keep an eye on how much money you have in your margin account
Two screens is a good number to get you started, but some traders may
need more, especially when they trade more than one market at a time.
Using the right orders for your forex trading goals
You can use market orders when trading forex futures and other instruments,
but because the forex markets move so fast, you need to set some automatic
exit and entry points to manage your risk as part of your armaments.
A stop loss is the same kind of order in all markets: It gets you out either at
your specified price or the closest possible price depending on market condi-
tions. Same thing’s true of a limit order, which you use to set your entry point
at a predetermined price.
204
Part III: Financial Futures 

Some other useful orders for the forex market include
 Take profit orders (TPO): A TPO enables you to get out of your position
at a price that you target before you enter the trade. This kind of order
specifies that a position needs to be closed out when the current
exchange rate crosses a given or set threshold. You can set up a TPO
above a long position and below a short position.
 One cancels the other (OCO) orders: An OCO is an order that has two
parts; actually it’s made up of two separate orders bundled into one
package. An OCO is made up of a stop-loss order and a limit order at
opposite ends of a spread. When one order is triggered, no matter which
direction the market is trending, the other is terminated. In effect, you
enter an entry point and protect your position by limiting your losses
immediately. Here’s how the OCO works:
• Going long: If you’re going long in the market, you set the stop loss
below the market spread and the limit-sell order above the market
spread. If the base currency rate breaches the limit order thresh-
old, then your position automatically is sold at or near the price at
which you set the limit, and you no longer need the stop loss,
which then is canceled. Alternatively, if the rate falls to the stop-
loss trigger price, then the position is closed out at or near the trig-
ger price, and you no longer have any need for the limit order.
• Going short: If you’re shorting the market, you set the stop loss
above the market spread and the limit order below — just the oppo-
site of the long position. If the exchange rate rises to the stop-loss
trigger price, then the position is closed out, thus canceling the limit
order. If the exchange rate falls to the limit-order trigger price, then
the limit order is activated, you buy back the position at the prede-
termined limit-order price, and the stop-loss order is canceled.
Sampling the goods
Here’s a simple example of a trade in the spot market:
 Buy a 100,000 lot of GBP/USD at the offer price of $1.7550.
The trade is valued at a total of $175,500.
 Need to put your broker’s margin of 2 percent, or $3,510, in your margin
account. You get that amount by multiplying 0.2 × $175,500.
 Profit when your trade goes well and the GPB/USD exchange rate rises
to $1,760.
Your profit is $500, or 100,000 × (1.760 – 1.7550), or a 14-percent yield.

Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies

The U.S. Dollar Index
The Federal Reserve Board introduced the U.S. dollar index in March 2003. The
index was the result of the Smithsonian Agreement, which repealed the Bretton
Woods Agreement. What does that mean? The Bretton Woods agreement fixed
global currency rates 25 years earlier. The Smithsonian agreement, which was
viewed as a victory for proponents of free markets, enabled global currencies
to float based on market forces.
The U.S. dollar index is used by traders to get the big picture of the overall
trend of the dollar and is widely quoted in the press and on quote services. It
is similar to the Fed’s dollar index, which is a trade-weighted index, meaning
that the Fed gives value to each individual currency in the index based on
how much it trades within the U.S. However, the value of each index is differ-
ent, and they shouldn’t be confused with one another.
For example, as of July 10, 2005, the Fed’s dollar index was quoted at 86.39
on the Fed’s Web site. The spot price for the U.S. dollar index on the same
day was 90.25. So according to the Fed’s index, based on trade, the dollar had
lost some 14 percent of its value since March 2003; however, according to the
market — in other words, based on traders’ perception of the global economy,
the geopolitical situation, inflation, and interest rates, among other factors —
the dollar had lost only 10 percent of its value (or purchasing power) since the
creation of the index.
The U.S. dollar index has traded as high as the 160s and as low as the 70s.
Interestingly, though, both the Fed and the trader indexes hit bottom in
December 2004.
The U.S. dollar index trades on the New York Board of Trade at Finex and at
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Here are the particulars of the index:
 A minimum tick is 0.1 and is worth $10.
 Futures contracts expire in March, June, September, and December.
 The overall value of a contract is 1,000 times the value of the index in
dollars.
 Delivery is physical, meaning that you receive dollars based on the value
of the index on the second business day prior to the third Wednesday
during the month of the expiring contract. On the last trading day, trad-
ing ceases at 10:16 a.m.
 Delivery day is the third Wednesday of the contract month.
 No trading limits are placed on the U.S. dollar index. Trading hours are
from 8:05 a.m. to 3 p.m. with overnight trading from 7 to 10 p.m.
206
Part III: Financial Futures 

The U.S. dollar index was modified at the inception of the euro and is weighted
in a way that’s similar to the Fed’s trade weighted index, as follows (expressed
in percentages):
 Euro’s weight: 57.6 percent
 Japanese yen: 13.6 percent
 British pound: 11.9 percent
 Canadian dollar: 9.1 percent
 Swedish krona: 4.2 percent
 Swiss franc: 3.6 percent
The U.S. dollar index is best used as an indicator of trends in the currency
markets.
The U.S. dollar index isn’t as good of a trading vehicle as the individual cur-
rencies. The best way to trade the index is by using currency mutual funds.
The Profunds Rising Dollar Fund (RDPIX) and Falling Dollar Funds (FDPIX) are
two such funds. Rydex, another mutual fund company, is in the process of
registering its own set of dollar trading funds. I use these funds to capitalize
on the long-term trends that are possible in the currency markets.
I know that this book isn’t about trading mutual funds, but one of the secrets
of trading success is understanding what kind of a person you are. If you’re
overwhelmed by the big expensive trading rig you need to make any money
in FOREX and upset (I know I am) because you can’t take a coffee or bath-
room break for fear the market will move against you and in the blink of an
eye you’ll end up with a margin call, then you need to consider using these
funds. By using the funds, you are, in essence, taking away a good deal of the
problems that you can face by directly trading currencies. The funds are
priced only once a day. If you check the dollar index a few times during the
day, then you have a pretty good idea as to how your fund is going to close
that day.
Trading Foreign Currency
Trading currencies can be exciting and lucrative. For me, it’s a great market
because of the way politics affect the trends. Elections, strikes, and sudden
developments, both good and bad, can lead to significant trading profits — if
you stand ready to trade.
207
Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies

Trading the euro against the dollar
The euro is a convenient currency, because it encompasses the policies and
the economic activity and political environment of a volatile but predictable
part of the world — Europe.
Because France, Italy, and Germany, the largest members of the European
Union (EU), are socialist countries, they normally operate under high budget
deficits and tend to keep their interest rates more stable than the U.S., where
the free-market approach and a usually vigilant Federal Reserve make more
frequent adjustments on interest rates.
The general tendency of the Fed is to make the dollar trend for very long peri-
ods of time in one general direction.
Aside from the technical analysis, here are some general tendencies of the
euro on which you need to keep tabs:
 The European Central Bank is almost fanatical about inflation, given
German’s history of hyperinflation in the first half of the 20th century
and the repercussions of that period, namely the rise of Hitler. That
means that the European Central Bank raises interest rates more easily
than it lowers them.
 The European Central Bank’s actions become important when all other
factors are equal, meaning politics are equally as stable or unstable in
the U.S. and Europe, and the two economies are growing. For example,
if the U.S. economy is slowing down, money slowly starts to drift away
from the dollar. In the past, that meant money would move toward the
Japanese yen; however, because the market knows that Japan’s central
bank will sell yen, the default currency when the dollar weakens often is
now the euro.
 The flip side is that the market often sells the euro during political prob-
lems in the region, especially when the European economy is slowing,
and the economy in the United Kingdom (UK), which often moves along
with the U.S. economy, is showing signs of strength.
As usual, you want to closely monitor major currencies and the crossrates.
It’s okay to form an opinion and have some expectations, but the final and
only truth that should make you trade is what the charts are showing you.
The direction that counts is the one in which the market is heading.
208
Part III: Financial Futures 

The UK pound sterling
The pound is active against the dollar and the euro, offering good opportuni-
ties to trade both pairs (GBP/USD and USD/GBP, see the section on “Dabbling
in da forex lingo,” earlier in this chapter). The UK is a pivotal nation, because
it bridges the economical, geographical, and ideological divide between the
U.S. and Europe.
Economically, the UK is more free-market oriented than Europe, and it tends to
share a more common set of views with the U.S. At the same time, the UK can’t
totally disassociate itself from Europe, given its history and its geography.
The upshot is a currency that is affected by politics at home and on the two
continents to which its destiny — or at least its economy and politics — is so
closely related.
Because the UK is an oil producer, the pound can be affected more directly
by oil prices than other currencies. The relationship between oil and the
pound is fading, however, because production in the UK’s North Sea oil fields
is steadily decreasing.
The Japanese yen
The Japanese yen is a manipulated currency, which basically means it is kept
low artificially by the Japanese government.
The combination of low interest rates (zero for the last several years — as of
the summer of 2005), the lasting economic effects from the bursting of the
Japanese real-estate bubble, and the collapse of the stock market and the
banking system in Japan have forced its government to keep the yen’s value
low by selling it in the open market when it reaches a certain level.
The main purpose of maintaining a weak currency is to keep the Japanese
export machinery operational. Over the long term, however, a weaker cur-
rency will continue to hurt Japan’s chance of achieving a lasting recovery.
The most useful time to trade the yen is when political and potential military
problems are taking place in Asia. China’s rise as a global power can eventu-
ally lead to a major and uncontrolled weakening of the yen. The best way to
trade the yen is not against the dollar but rather to use crossrate analysis,
especially against the euro and the Swiss franc.
209
Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies

The Swiss franc
The Swiss franc is considered a reserve currency, or one that is reliable and
tends to hold its value when others don’t. It also is a currency to which
traders and other investors flow during times of global crisis. Its strength is
based on three traditional expectations in the market:
 Reliable economic fundamentals: Switzerland has a history of low infla-
tion and current account surpluses. It also is a country whose banking
system is well known for holding the deposits of extremely wealthy and
stable clients.
 Gold reserves. The Swiss franc still is backed by gold, because
Switzerland’s gold reserves significantly exceed the amount of currency
it has placed in circulation. Switzerland has the fourth largest holding of
gold in the world. Relative to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the level of
international reserves — with or without gold — is far ahead of all other
countries.
 Little political influence: Switzerland’s political neutrality enables it to
set a monetary policy that operates (essentially) in a vacuum and thus
enables its central bank to concentrate its effort on price stability. In
December 1999, the Swiss National Bank changed the way it manages
monetary policy, from one that traditionally targeted the money supply
to one that targets inflation. The bank’s goal is a 2-percent annual infla-
tion rate.
The two major factors to keep an eye on when trading the franc are
 Economic data: The franc can be affected by several key economic
reports, including
• The release of Swiss M3, the broadest measure of money supply
• The release of Swiss CPI
• Unemployment data
• Balance of payments, GDP, and industrial production
 Crossrates: Changes in interest rates in the EU or the UK can alter cross-
rates and have an effect on the U.S. dollar. For example, if the euro or the
pound rises and the Swiss franc weakens against them, the franc also is
likely to move with regards to the dollar, thus offering traders like you
three potential trading vehicles. The general tendency is for a sudden
move in EUR/USD — which can be triggered by a major fundamental
factor, such as an unexpected change in government, a terrorist attack,
or a major economic release — to cause an equally sharp move in
USD/CHF in the opposite direction.

Arbitrage Opportunities and
Sanity Requirements
The 24-hour trading day in spot currency markets — and its potential for
activity whenever any major event occurs and develops — offers great
opportunities for arbitrage, or trading both on the long and short side by
using different currencies. Arbitrage is a sophisticated strategy that you can
use when you become experienced at trading.
Here are some basic arbitrage rules to keep in mind:
 Currencies move in response to news events. Keeping a calendar of
economic releases for Europe, the U.S., the UK, Japan, and Switzerland is
a good habit to get into. When a major economic release is outside the
realm of expectations, currencies will move, and you can be poised in
those situations to make large sums of money in short periods of time.
 Major events, such as September 11, 2001, hurricanes, and other nat-
ural disasters also make the currencies move. I’m not trying to be
morbid, but trading on bad news is a fact of life. As a trader, you can
make bad-news decisions that are profitable if you’re watching for them.
 Keep an eye on crossrates and bond markets. These areas move
together, and they often move in opposite directions. After you become
comfortable with currencies, you may want to consider setting up trades
in interest-rate futures and currencies, which can serve as either a hedge
or a profit-making opportunity.
211
Chapter 11: Rocking and Rolling: Speculating with Currencies
The panic response
The Swiss franc often is a financial instrument
of refuge for wealthy individuals, corporations,
and traders. After the events of September 11,
2001, and the July 2005 bombings in the London
Underground, the Swiss franc was the immedi-
ate beneficiary of the flight to quality trade,
as traders acted on reflex, at least initially,
and moved money toward traditional safe
havens. The U.S. dollar used to be more of a
safe haven prior to September 11, 2001, but that
distinction has changed, because the markets
have adjusted their expectations based on the
fact that even though no more major attacks
have occurred in the United States, the U.S.
nevertheless remains the primary target of Al-
Qaeda. Whenever a major terrorist attack
occurs, the markets always react as though the
attack may be followed by a strike on the
United States. Besides the Swiss franc, other
safe havens include U.S. Treasury Bonds, U.S.
Treasury Bills, and Eurodollars.

 Research your opportunities in the options markets, and develop a
program that includes options. Currency and interest-rate futures offer
option opportunities. By using currency and/or interest-rate options,
you can protect your currency positions at a fraction of the cost of
owning the direct contract or lot.
 Use the hypothetical trading systems. Available on the Internet, you can
use these Web tools to try different strategies or dissect new charting
setups. ActionForex.com has some good demos. Get comfortable with
the way the currency markets work first, however, before you risk any
large sums of money.
 Beware of using mini accounts. Although mini accounts enable you
to trade forex for $300 or less, such trades are a good way to get hurt,
given the speed at which these markets can move. Instead, you need to
be well capitalized before you make your move into this trading arena.
 Don’t give up your day job unless you’re a truly gifted trader. Most
people are not gifted traders, and they need to use the currency markets
only as part of an overall strategy to build wealth steadily and to protect
their overall investment program and goals.
Don’t try to trade around the clock. Much of the action in currencies takes
place overnight. Europe and Asian trading in currencies can be extremely
powerful, and any open position that was profitable when you went to bed
can be wiped out by morning. Use your stops wisely, and close out any posi-
tions that make you uncomfortable when you’re done for the day.

S
tock-index futures came of age October 19, 1987. That’s when a major
stock market crash was fueled by something known as portfolio insurance,
or the sale of futures contracts to protect losses in individual stock positions.
The most important and lasting influence of the 1987 crash was that the world
was awakened to a new era of investing — the era of the one market — in
which stock-index futures and the stock market became a single entity.
I remember October 19, 1987, vividly. I had no money and no investments at
that time. Boy, was I lucky. But market activity on that day and during the
ensuing months is responsible for turning me into a financial-market junky
and enabling me not only to save for my retirement but also to earn a living
doing something that is exciting and enjoyable — trading and teaching others
how to trade.
My first real-life experience with money in a stock-market crash came in 1990,
when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. My next experiences came in 1997 and
1998 when the Asian currency crisis hit the markets. Each step of the way, I
remember watching the relationship between the cash market and stock-index
futures. That interplay sets up the potential strategies for speculation and for
hedging that I describe to you in this chapter.
You don’t need to trade every major index contract in the world to be success-
ful; you just need to find one or two with which you’re comfortable — the ones
that enable you to implement your strategies. In this chapter, I focus on the

Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) Stock Index futures, a well-known contract
that is central to the markets. Any of the lessons that I describe with respect
to the S&P 500 can, however, be applied to just about any contract.
Getting a Grip on the Noise
Stock-index futures are futures contracts based on indexes that are composed
of stocks. For example, the S&P 500 futures contract is based on the popular
market benchmark of the same name — the S&P 500 Stock Index, a group of
500 commonly traded stocks (see the section “The S&P 500 futures [SP]” later
in this chapter).
When you trade stock-index futures, you’re betting on the direction of the
contract’s value, and not on the individual stocks that make up the index.
In a sense, by focusing on the value and general trend of the stocks as a
group, you’re blocking out a good deal of the noise that often is associated
with the daily gyrations in the prices of the individual stocks.
Stock-index futures are an integral part of the stock market’s daily activity. As
of July 2005, more than 70 stock-index futures contracts traded on at least 20
exchanges around the world. As a percentage of the total number of futures
contracts traded, stock-index futures are by far the largest category of
futures contracts traded. That dominance clearly speaks of the major role
that stock-index futures play in risk management for the entire stock market.
I can think of several major reasons for trading stock-index futures. Here are
some of the more common ones:
 Speculation: When you speculate, you’re making an educated guess
about the direction of a market. I hope you gather from reading this and
other chapters of this book that an educated guess is based on careful
examination of market history, trends, and key external events that can
affect the prices of financial assets. When you speculate, you can deliver
trading profits to your accounts by going long or short on index futures,
or betting on prices rising or falling, respectively.
 Hedging: A hedge is when you use stock-index futures and options to
protect either an individual security in your portfolio or in some cases
the entire portfolio from losing value. For example, if you own a large
number of blue-chip, dividend-paying stocks, and you’re getting some
nice income from them, you have to think long and hard about selling
them. Yet, in a bear market, your portfolio is going to decrease in value.
214
Part III: Financial Futures 

By using stock-index futures and options, you can sell the market short
and protect the overall value of your portfolio, while continuing to
receive your dividends.
 Tax consequences: Gains in the futures markets are taxed at a lower rate
than stock-market capital gains. At the top rate, short-term gains
(because that’s what futures and options traders deal with, primarily) in
stocks are taxed at a 39.6 percent rate. Capital gains from successful
futures trading are blended by the IRS as follows:
• The IRS has a complex set of rules for taxing gains in the futures
markets with specific forms with which you must become familiar,
such as IRS Form 4797 Part II for securities or Form 6781 for com-
modities. I could devote at least a third of a chapter to tax rules,
but space restrictions won’t allow it, so that means that you need
to check with your accountant before you start trading.
• The flip side is that you can deduct your losses and get preferential
treatment on your gains if you form the right kind of corporation
and set up retirement plans and other kinds of shelters. These fac-
tors may vary depending on the state in which you reside, and
they may change over time as new tax laws are written. Again, be
sure to check with your accountant.
• The IRS also taxes stock-index futures at a different rate than com-
modities, such as soybeans. Short-term gains in the former are
taxed up to 35 percent, while short-term gains in the latter average
out to 23 percent.
For example, for every $10,000 you make in short-term gains as a
result of trading individual stocks, you may have to pay as much as
$3,960 in taxes, but when you trade stock-index futures, every
$10,000 short-term gain can be taxed for only $2,784. The $2,784 is
based on the blending formula used by the IRS. Again, check with
your accountant for the numbers that may apply to you and your
tax bracket.
 Lower commission rates: Many futures brokerages offer lower commis-
sion rates. This practice is not as widespread as it was before online
discount brokers for stocks became a mainstay of the business. But
you still can find low commission rates in the futures markets, a factor
that becomes more important as you trade large blocks or quantities
of stocks.
 Time factors: If something happens overnight, when the stock market
is closed, and you want to hedge your risk, you can trade futures on
Globex while Wall Street sleeps. Globex is a 24-hour electronic trading
system for a wide variety of futures contracts (see Chapter 3).
215
Chapter 12: Stocking Up on Indexes

Contracting with the Future:
Looking into Fair Value
Fair value is the theoretically correct value for a futures contract at a particu-
lar point in time. You calculate fair value using a formula that includes the
current index level, index dividends, number of days to contract expiration,
and interest rates.
Without getting caught up in the details, the important thing for you to
remember about fair value is that it’s a benchmark that can be a helpful tool
for your analysis of the markets.
For example, when a stock-index futures contract trades below its fair value,
it’s trading at a discount. When it trades above fair value, it’s trading at a
premium.
Knowing the fair value is most helpful in gauging where the market is headed.
Because stock-index futures prices are related to spot-index prices, changes
in fair value can trigger price changes.
If the spread between the index and cash widens or shrinks far enough, you’ll
see a rise in activity from computer-trading programs.
Here’s how it works:
 If the futures contract is too far below fair value, the index (cash) is sold
and the futures contract is bought.
 If the futures contract is too high versus its fair value, the futures con-
tract is sold and the index (cash) is bought.
 If enough sell programs hit the market hard enough over an extended
period of time, you can see a crash, or a situation where market prices
fall dramatically.
 If enough buy programs kick in, the market tends to rally.
Fair value is the number that the television stock analysts refer to when dis-
cussing the action in futures before the market opens.
Major Stock-Index Futures Contracts
You can trade many different stock-index contracts, but they all share the
same basic characteristics. I describe many of these general issues in the sec-
tion that follows, and I address any particular differences with descriptions of
other individual contracts throughout the rest of this section.
216
Part III: Financial Futures 

The S&P 500 futures (SP)
The biggest stock-index futures contract is the S&P 500, which trades on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). This index is made up of the 500 largest
stocks in the United States. It’s a weighted index, which means that component
companies that have bigger market capitalizations, or market values, can have
a much larger impact on the movements of the index than components with
smaller market capitalizations. For example, a stock like IBM has a larger
market capitalization than the stock of a smaller company in the index, such
as retailer Costco.
Some of the particulars about the S&P 500 Index include the following:
 Composition: The S&P 500 is made up of 400 industrial companies,
40 financial companies, 40 utilities, and 20 transportation companies,
offering a fairly diversified view of the U.S. economy.
 Valuation: The S&P 500 Index is valued in ticks worth 0.1 index points
or $25.
 Contracts: S&P 500 Index futures contracts are worth 250 times the value
of the index. That means that when the index value is at 1,250, a contract
is worth 250 × $1,250, or $312,500. A move of a full point is worth $250.
 Trading times: Regular trading hours for S&P 500 Index futures are from
8:30 a.m. to 3:15 p.m., but S&P 500 Index futures contracts are another
example of how 24-hour-a-day trading enables traders to respond to eco-
nomic news and releases in the premarket and aftermarket sessions. The
evening session starts 15 minutes after the close (at 3:30 p.m.) and con-
tinues in the overnight until 8:15 a.m. on Globex.
 Contract limits: Individual contract holders are limited to no more than
20,000 net long or short contracts at any one time.
 Price limits: Price limits should not be confused with circuit breakers
(see next list item). Price limits halt trading above or below the price
specified by the limit. A price limit is how far the S&P 500 Index can rise
or fall in a single trading session. The limits are set on a quarterly basis.
If the index experiences major declines or increases beyond these limits,
a procedure is in place to halt trading. You can find the price limits
detailed on the CME’s Web site (www.cme.com).
 Circuit breakers: Circuit breakers halt trading briefly in a coordinated
manner between exchanges. The limits that trigger circuit breakers
are calculated and agreed upon on a quarterly basis by the different
exchanges.
The collar rule addresses price swings related to program trades that
move the Dow Industrial Average more than 2 percent by requiring index
arbitrage orders, or orders that bet on the spread between the futures
and cash of stock indexes, to be stabilizing. That means that traders
217
Chapter 12: Stocking Up on Indexes

using these methods can’t pile on orders on the sell or the buy side in an
attempt to exaggerate the gains or losses for the market. In effect, what
this rule does is decrease the chance for huge gains or losses as a result
of futures trading. Details can be found at the Web site for the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC — www.sec.gov). For this overview
chapter, it’s good to know that the collar rule exists and that it can have
an effect on trading.
 Final settlement: For all stock-index futures, settlement on the CME is
based on a Special Opening Quotations (SOQ) price, which is calculated
based on the opening prices for each of the stocks in an index on the
day that the contract expires. Don’t confuse the SOQ with the opening
index value, which is calculated right after the opening. Note: Some
stocks may take a while to establish opening prices.
 Margin requirements: Margin values for S&P 500 Index contracts are
variable. In July 2005, the initial margin for the S&P 500 contract was
$19,688, and the maintenance margin was $15,750.
 Cash settlement: Stock-index futures are settled with cash, a practice
known as, you guessed it, cash settlement. That means if you hold your
contract until expiration, you have to either pay or receive the amount
of money the contract is worth as determined by the SOQ price (see the
“Final settlement” list item earlier). Cash settlement applies to all stock-
index futures.
Overnight and premarket trading can be thin and dangerous, especially
during slow seasons in the stock market, such as in summer, fall, and around
winter holidays.
The NASDAQ-100 Futures Index (ND)
The NASDAQ-100 Futures Index contract is similar to the S&P 500 Index
futures contract. Here’s what you need to know about it:
 Composition: The NASDAQ-100 Stock Index is made up of the 100 largest
stocks traded on the NASDAQ system, including large technology and
biotech stocks.
 Valuation: The ND is valued in minimum ticks of 0.5 that are worth $50.
 Contract limits: No more than 10,000 net long or short contracts can be
held by any individual at any one time.
 Margin requirements: Margins required for NASDAQ-100 Index futures
are similar to the S&P 500 Index futures. In July 2005, the initial margin for
the ND contract was $18,750, and the maintenance margin was $15,000.
218
Part III: Financial Futures 

Minimizing your contract
The e-mini S&P 500 (ES) contract and the e-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ) are among
the most popular stock-index futures contracts, because they enable you to
trade the market’s trend with only a fifth of the requirement. The e-mini S&P is
a favorite of day traders because of its high intraday volatility and major price
swings on a daily basis. The mini contracts are marketed to small investors,
and they offer some advantages. However, they also carry significant risks,
because they’re volatile and still have fairly high margin requirements.
The mini contract can be very volatile and can move even more aggressively
during extremely volatile market environments. Here are some particulars
about the e-mini contracts:
 Composition: The ES and EQ e-mini contracts are based on the same
makeup as the respective S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 index contracts.
 Valuation: One tick on ES is 0.25 of an index point and is worth $12.50.
One tick on EQ is 0.50 of an index point and is worth $10.
 Contracts: The value of an ES contract is $50 multiplied by the value of
the S&P 500 Index. The value of an EQ contract is $20 multiplied by the
value of the NASDAQ-100 Index.
 Trading times: The e-mini contracts trade nearly 24 hours per day, with
a 30-minute maintenance break in trading from 4:30 to 5:00 p.m. daily.
 Monthly identifiers: Monthly identifiers for both mini contracts are H
for March, M for June, U for September, and Z for December.
 Margin requirements: Margins for the ES and EQ contracts are less than
for the normal-sized contracts. As of July 2005, the ES requires $3,938 for
initial margin and $3,150 for maintenance, and the EQ requires $3,750
and $3,000, respectively.
The day-trading margin is less than the margin to hold an overnight position
in S&P 500 e-mini futures. Traders, though, are obligated to pay for the differ-
ence between the margins for entry and exit points, which means that if you
lose, you’re likely to pay up in a big way at the end of the day.
When you own normal-sized contracts and e-mini contracts in one or the
other of the underlying indexes, position limits apply to both positions,
meaning that each of the contracts is counted as an individual part of the
overall position, and the combined number of contracts can’t exceed the
20,000 contract limit for the S&P 500-based index and the 10,000 contract
limit for the NASDAQ-100-based index.
219
Chapter 12: Stocking Up on Indexes

Trading Strategies
Now that you know the basics of some of the futures contracts that you can
trade, the next step is to put this information to use in formulating strategies.
As with any other futures trading, you may want to try some of these in paper
trading, or by using an online trading simulator. It’s always better to get the
feel of trading a contract before jumping in with real money.
You can apply every technique described in this book to trading stock-index
futures. Moving averages, RSI, MACD, the Swing Rule, pattern recognition,
support/resistance levels, and many others (see Chapter 8) — with or without
fundamental analysis — all work, and if you applied them properly, you’re
likely be fairly successful.
Using futures instead of stocks
At the beginning of this chapter, I noted that stock-index futures can be used
for hedging or for speculating. Here is a good example of how you can use
them as a substitute for individual stocks.
Assume that you have a $500,000 portfolio of Treasury bonds (T-bonds) that
are paying you a fairly decent return of 5 percent to 6 percent. You aren’t
planning to sell any of them, because you want to hold on to those decent
yields as long as possible. And based on your knowledge of technical analy-
sis, market sentiment, and your analysis of the economy (see Chapters 6, 7,
and 9), suppose that you’re looking at a scenario which in the past has led to
a market rally, and you’d like to take advantage of that opportunity.
One way to do it is to sell $40,000 of your portfolio and split it into two. For sim-
plicity’s sake, assume that the margin, or the amount that you will have to fork
over for one S&P 500 futures contract, is $20,000. With that you buy one S&P
500 futures contract, where the margin is roughly $20,000 (Amount 1), while
you keep the remaining $20,000 (Amount 2) in your margin account to give you
some flexibility, such as leveraging your position with options, considering
other strategies, and for protecting you if you’re wrong and get a margin call.
Amount 1 ($20,000) should provide enough in your margin account for you to
buy one S&P contract, and at the July 15, 2005, closing price of 1230.80, it
would give you control of roughly $307,700.
With Amount 2 (the other $20,000), you can invest in and collect interest on
Treasury bills and look for other opportunities, perhaps in the options mar-
kets, as you look to hedge your S&P 500 contract or to leverage it further,
depending on market conditions.
220
Part III: Financial Futures 

This strategy isn’t without risk, but again, it isn’t irresponsible either, and it’s
sensible if your goal is to take advantage of what you think is a coming rally
in the stock market. By using stock indexes with a portion of your bond port-
folio, you are
 Simplifying your exposure to stocks. You don’t have to go out and buy
10 or 15 individual stocks to diversify your stock portfolio using the
stock indexes.
 Still leaving most of your money in income-yielding T-bonds. In other
words, you’re still guaranteed a reliable rate of return.
 Taking prudent risks. If you act responsibly, monitor your position, and
follow sound trading rules (see Chapter 17), including prudent profit
taking, position hedging, and cutting any sudden and unexpected losses,
your risks remain tolerable, even if the market goes against you.
 Benefiting financially. The flip side of risk is that if you’re correct, you
may make a large sum of money in a relatively short period of time.
Protecting your stock portfolio
Another good hedge involves a well-diversified stock portfolio of dividend-
paying stocks and the stock-index futures. Using the $500,000 example again,
assume your portfolio is made up of stocks rather than bonds.
You can see in Figure 12-1 that the S&P 500 Cash Index made a new high in
March, but the relative strength indicator (RSI) failed to match it. That clear
divergence was enough cause for concern for you to start monitoring all of
your high-yield, dividend-paying stocks. Even though you find that they’re
actually holding on pretty well, you’re still not sure about what will happen if
the market starts selling off, because you have no guarantee that even low-
volatility stocks won’t be sold in a significant price correction.
You have several possible decisions to make. You can
 Take profits on your stock portfolio.
 Sell call options or buy put options on each of your individual stocks.
Call options essentially are bets that the underlying stock is going
higher. Put options are bets that the underlying stock is going to fall. If
you sell a call option, you collect a premium that cushions any losses.
If you buy a put option, the appreciation of the value of the put (if your
stock falls) cushions any losses. See Chapters 4 and 5 for more about
option strategies.
 Look to the futures market for a good way to hedge your stocks.
221
Chapter 12: Stocking Up on Indexes

Option strategies on individual stocks may be a good way to go unless you
have 10 or 20 positions to hedge, which can take most of your time to moni-
tor and manage.
The idea is to understand that the futures and spot markets are linked, which is
what became widely known through the unfortunate circumstances surround-
ing the market crash in 1987. Since then, this relationship has become widely
accepted.
In the example that follows, I look at two charts of the S&P 500. Figure 12-1 is a
chart of the S&P 500 Cash Index. Figure 12-2 is a chart of the S&P 500 Index
futures. Both are from the same date, July 15, 2005. The object is to find out
how futures and cash indexes work in tandem and how you can use this rela-
tionship to protect your stock portfolio. For better reference, you need to real-
ize that the futures chart offers a zoomed-in view of the time period.
Using the RSI and cash market in Figure 12-1 as your guide, here is the
anatomy of a hedge trade for your stock portfolio using the S&P 500 Stock
Index futures:
 The indicators: The RSI’s lack of confirmation in the cash market was a
caution signal and should have alerted you to a potential change in trend.
 The trend-line analysis: The trend line on the cash index confirmed a
major market break. The break below Trend Line 1 by the S&P 500 Cash

Index in Figure 12-1 confirmed your expectations and was your signal to
do one of the following:
• Short one S&P futures contract
• Buy an S&P futures put option
Notice how RSI kept falling despite the attempted rally in the S&P 500. The
descending trend line above the S&P 500 exhibited resistance in the market,
and the failure at the trend line led to another leg down for the S&P 500.
Likewise, note how the RSI bottomed along with the market and how the S&P
in the cash and futures contracts broke back above the uptrend line. If you
played this trade correctly, you made some money and protected your port-
folio (or both).
And notice how the action in the S&P futures was closely mirroring the action
in the cash index. If you covered your futures short position in April, you
didn’t have to do much more to manage your stock portfolio because the
market rallied for another two months after that.
The tendency of most traders would be to stay too long in the trading posi-
tion that I just described — as the market was making a bottom in April.
That’s what the markets do to fool you. Futures traders don’t have the same
amount of time to make decisions as someone who’s trading only stocks. If
you played this trade correctly, you made money. If you weren’t sure about
what to do, you could have covered the risk to your short position in the
futures contract by setting up an options straddle so you could sell the put as
the market reversed and ride out the call as the market rallied.
A straddle is when you buy both a put and a call, and it’s best used when
you’re not sure which way the market will break. A successfully executed
straddle means that you must sell the side of the straddle (the put or the call)
that the market moves against. Check out Chapters 4 and 5 for more about
straddles.
Swinging with the rule
A little-used strategy that you sometimes can use to help you know when to
take profits is called the swing rule. In the example used in the previous sec-
tion, the swing rule worked well, but you need to take a close look at some
six-month indicators. Looking at Figure 12-2, which shows the S&P 500 Index
futures, note the “Swing line” label, right at the 1,200 level. A swing line is a
line that you can draw across the dome formed by the price changes in the
futures contract from February to March. As you can tell, the price made a
full swing (up and over) during that time frame, ending up right about where
it started before it rallied for a few weeks.
223
Chapter 12: Stocking Up on Indexes

To calculate the swing rule, you take the top price of that dome, which is
roughly 1,240, and subtract the bottom, or the level across which you drew
the swing line (roughly 1,200) to get a 40-point swing. Swing lines serve as
guides to how much you can allow the market to fall before you consider
taking at least partial profits.
In this case, the swing rule worked perfectly, because the market bottomed
near 1,160, just about 40 points below the swing line at 1,200.
Speculating with stock-index futures
Aside from hedging, you can simply speculate with futures contracts just by
using technical and fundamental analyses (see Chapters 6 and 7).
Stock-index futures are almost guaranteed to move in response to economic
indicators. You can set up positions with both futures and options as you
wait for the news to hit. In the last several years, the monthly employment
report, which is issued the first Friday of every month, has been an excellent
mover for stock-index futures.
Using Your Head to Be Successful
If you’re disciplined, you stand a much better chance of being more success-
ful or even extremely successful.

Get real
You can’t win every time, and you can’t have the same success as a pit trader.
Even though the kind of trading, due to the use of different time frames used
and strategies, that pit traders and retail investors use are different, it’s still
unrealistic to expect the same kinds of results.
Most pros will tell you that a large portion of their trades break even, lose a
little, or gain a little, and that it’s only about 30 percent of the time that they
can hit home runs. So if you don’t develop a trading plan and prepare your-
self for the reality of the game, you’re not going to enjoy it.
Get a grip on your money management
Professional traders rely on a few standards, and although the figures change
slightly, the principles of those standards remain firm:
 Risk no more than 5 percent of your equity on any one trade.
 Limit your losses to no more than 5 percent per trade. If you only 
risk 5 percent, it takes 20 trades to wipe you out if you pony up $10,000
in the first place. This is a dynamic process. Adjust your 5-percent loss
limit to your current equity level. That means that as your equity rises,
the amount risked also gets larger, and as your equity falls, so does the
amount risked. That’s how you stay in the business, by letting your win-
ners run and keeping a short leash on your losers.
Choose your contracts carefully
The more you know about a particular type of contract, the better off you
are. Here are some actions you can take to become a specialist:
 Figure out how many days a particular contract tends to spend rising
or falling along a Bollinger band. Bollinger bands are flexible bands of
price support and resistance levels described fully in Chapter 7. When
you find out, you’ll have an idea about when that contract is likely to
turn around. This tool is particularly useful when you’re swing trading
near a top or bottom. Although the Bollinger band trends won’t be
exact, as long as you know that the index usually turns five to ten days
after moving along the band, you can then start to follow the index more
closely and watch for trading opportunities.
 Try different sets and combinations of moving averages. Watching var-
ious moving averages, one with the other, you can find out which con-
tracts trade better, for example, with a five-day exponential average, and
which ones work best with a nonexponential moving average.
225
Chapter 12: Stocking Up on Indexes

 Try different oscillators and combinations of them. By trying them out,
you can find out which ones work best with each index that you trade.
The RSI oscillator works better with some futures contracts, while the
MACD and other oscillators work better with others.
 Check out the charts from the past. Don’t be afraid to go back months
or even years to look at charts of what some indexes have done in the
past. Patterns shown in the charts tend to repeat time and again, which
is why pattern recognition becomes so useful.
 Try different option parameters with your index trading. Find the
ones that tend to work best for you and your time frame. Experiment
with different strike prices, and consider paper trading with straddles
and with individual options. See Chapters 4 and 5.
Take your trading seriously
If you’re not up to trading on any given day, that’s fine. But if you turn on
your screen when your mind is in the clouds and you start making trades,
you’re going to get hurt. Trust me when I tell you that even if you have only a
$5,000 account and you’re trading only one contract at a time, a $500 loss
amounts to about 10 percent of your entire account. In the futures market,
that kind of pitfall can take all of about five minutes’ worth of action.
Never be afraid of selling too soon
If you set your targets and they get hit almost immediately after a news
release, follow your rules. Your objective got hit; take the money and run. By
the same token, don’t get greedy. If you’re looking at a nice profit, take it
before it turns into a loss.
Never let yourself get a margin call
I’ll probably get hit by my editor for saying this too many times, but you can’t
say it, read it, or hear it enough: Never let yourself get a margin call. Set loss
limits, no matter what. In the rare case that you do get a margin call, even if
you’ve set up good stops, the markets must have done something remark-
able. Meet your margin call. Figure out why you got it. And keep an eye on the
market, because other opportunities may soon arise.

I
never realized that I was going to become an expert in energy until I 
wrote a book titled Successful Energy Sector Investing (Prima-Random
House, 2002).
The truth is that I essentially stumbled into what has become my second
career. After finishing a book on biotech investments, Successful Biotech
Investing (Prima Money, 2001), the book company was interested in me writ-
ing another book. More than happy to oblige, through my research I discov-
ered that few books had been written about investing in energy, at least at 
the level most investors could understand, so I put together a proposal, and
it was accepted. Although the book got mixed reviews, it nevertheless sold
steadily, and it will continue to be available, because I now own the rights,
and it has proven to be a pretty good read, even if I do say so myself.
Researching and writing those books opened up a whole new world of possi-
bilities for me as a writer, an analyst, a commentator, and a trader. In a sense,
I owe a great deal of my livelihood to the oil markets, which are an interesting
bucketful of issues on their own.

What I’ve discovered about the energy markets can’t be fully described in
only one chapter, so in this chapter, I provide you with a good summary of
the way professionals think about and execute their trades in the energy mar-
kets and the way I make recommendations on energy stocks on my Joe
Duarte.com Web site (www.joe-duarte.com).
Energy markets are where the action will be for many more years. By focusing
on oil futures to figure out their complexities, sensibilities, and basically how
they work, you can find out how to use them to make money, especially over
the long term.
The emphasis in this chapter is on the entire energy complex from a specula-
tor’s standpoint, concentrating on the practical. The goal is understanding
how you can use supply and demand, geopolitics, and technical analysis to
reach sensible decisions about making good energy market trades.
In this chapter, when I refer to interest rates, unless I specifically say so, I’m
referring to both the United States Federal Reserve adjusted rates and the
bond-market rates.
Some Easy Background Info
Trading began in energy futures in 1979, and it is centralized at the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), the world’s largest physical commodity
futures exchange. The 132-year-old NYMEX trades futures and options con-
tracts for crude oil, natural gas, heating oil, gasoline, coal, electricity, and
propane. The NYMEX also is home to trading in metals (see Chapter 14).
Trading is conducted on the NYMEX in two divisions:
 The NYMEX division, which trades energy, platinum, and palladium.
 The COMEX division, which trades the rest of the metals.
NYMEX offers e-mini contracts for oil and natural gas for smaller traders,
which also are traded on the Globex network of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange (CME).
The NYMEX Web site, www.nymex.com, offers a good deal of information and
is worth a visit. The calendars and margin requirements, which are listed
individually for each contract, are especially useful to traders.
Next to interest rates, energy — especially oil — is the center of the universe
not only for industry but also for the financial markets.

Part IV: Commodity Futures 

Completing the Circle of Life: 
Oil and the Bond Market
Much of what happens in the world — from your mortgage rate to how easy
it is to find a job — depends on what I like to call the “Circle of Life” formed
by energy prices and interest rates. For the sake of simplicity, the term oil
(unless I note otherwise) can be used interchangeably with the term energy
in the rest of this chapter.
This relationship is important because it ties together the two most impor-
tant aspects of the global economy: energy, the fuel for growth, and interest
rates, the catalyst that powers borrowed money to do things. Sometimes 
the price of oil leads to a rise in interest rates, both in the bond market and
through the actions of central banks, and at other times, the opposite hap-
pens. In this chapter, when I use interest rates, it means both unless I specify
one or the other. The relationship depends on where the economic cycle of
supply and demand and politics happen to be at the time. After September
11, 2001, traditional relationships were somewhat changed but not com-
pletely abolished.
For example, in mid-2005, one of the major reasons for the Fed to continue to
raise interest rates, according to speeches made by Fed governors and Fed
Chief Alan Greenspan, was that the rise in oil prices was creating inflation. At
the same time, the bond market was struggling with the possibility that high
energy prices were increasing the chances of a recession.
As a result, the Fed kept raising interest rates, and the bond market was
stuck in a trading range with rates slowly creeping higher.
Here is the way it works. If oil prices rise high enough, one of two things hap-
pens: The Fed starts worrying either about inflation or the economy slowing
down because oil prices are so high that people can’t buy enough of other
things.
If inflation is the dominant theory at the Fed, the central bank will raise inter-
est rates. If a slowing economy is more likely, the Fed will start lowering 
interest rates. The bond market eventually will catch up with whatever the
Fed does, and sometimes leads the action of the Fed.
If the Fed worries about inflation enough, its Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) starts raising the interest rates banks charge for borrowing money. If
the opposite is true, such as when the economy slows, then the FOMC starts
to consider lowering interest rates to stimulate the economy.
231
Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

Watching the bond market
You’re probably wondering how you can determine — or at least take an edu-
cated guess about — how the Fed will act? Your best clue can be found by
monitoring the bond market. If bond-market interest rates begin to rise along
with oil prices, it’s a sign that the bond market is growing concerned about
high oil prices triggering inflation. If bond-market rates rise high enough, the
Fed is likely to increase bank interest rates. If rates start falling in the bond
market, then bond traders are expecting a slowing of the economy, and the
Fed is likely to reduce interest rates. As I noted in the previous section,
though, sometimes the Fed makes the first move by raising interest rates, 
and the bond market follows.
This explanation isn’t infallible, but it holds true a fair amount of the time. In
2004 and 2005, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called persistently
low bond-market interest rates combined with the Fed’s continuously high
interest rates, a “conundrum.”
Nevertheless, when oil prices are rising along with bond yields and/or inter-
est rates from the Fed, then you must look for an inflection point, such as
where bond yields and overall interest rates have gone high enough to lead
to a break in the price of oil, because traders have started factoring in the
fact that oil prices have risen to a point where they’re becoming a hindrance
to economic growth.
Looking for classic signs as oil prices rise
The overall markets are likely to project certain signs as oil prices rise and
traders start gauging the effect of the increases on the economy, including
 Decreasing traffic in stores and malls (and on the highways, for that
matter): By August 2005, as oil prices were reaching all-time record
highs, retailers began blaming a slowing of sales on high gasoline prices.
 Decreasing consumer confidence: By August 2005, consumer confi-
dence was skidding. Plenty of reasons could be cited for falling con-
sumer confidence and rising gasoline prices. Hurricane Katrina did
significant amounts of damage to the Gulf of Mexico’s coastline in the
United States. The City of New Orleans was rendered nearly useless. The
port of New Orleans, a major import hub for oil and export hub for agri-
cultural products, was shut for days. And the oil and gas production and
refining infrastructure of the area, which accounts for 20 percent of the
gasoline and natural gas used in the United States, was shut down and
took several months to be brought back online.
232
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 Crazy headlines: Look for increasing emphasis on oil prices on the
evening news and in the media that don’t normally cater to business
news. A perfect example was the call from Congress for a windfall profit
tax on oil companies and repeated calls for hearings on price gouging by
gas stations and fuel retailers.
Here’s a key to the relationship between oil prices and the economy in gen-
eral: At some point, interest rates will rise enough to cool off the demand for
oil. When that point is reached, oil prices will start to fall, and at some point
after that as traders begin to factor in a slower economy, so should bond
yields.
The Fed’s main goals are to keep prices steady and everyone employed, but
achieving them is nearly impossible. So that means the Fed will make mis-
takes and create inefficiencies in the market that are key to traders making a
profit. As a trader, one thing you definitely know is that the Fed will act. As 
a result, oil always is on the move, and that creates opportunities for you to
trade. You have to throw ideology out the door. Regardless of the party you
vote for or what you believe, in the oil market, it’s what you see that can
make you money.
Check out Figure 13-1 (later in this chapter), which shows the relationship
between interest rates in the bond market and oil prices, and then notice the
following:
 Oil prices and interest rates generally move in the same direction when
viewed over long periods of time. Note the overall upward trend of both
charts. Keep in mind that a wide band of movement is involved in this
relationship and that I’m discussing only the very big picture. The impor-
tant point to remember is that rising oil prices can lead to inflation, and
that inflation eventually will lead to higher interest rates, both in the
bond market and at the bank. See Chapters 2, 6, and 10 for more about
bonds, inflation, and the economy.
 Oil prices generally rise enough for interest rates to start to slow down
the pace at which they (oil prices) rise as the economy slows from
higher borrowing costs. Higher borrowing costs eventually slow 
demand for fuel.
Note that oil prices made a new high in March 2005, but interest rates in
the bond market did not. At that point in time, you needed to be thinking
that a top in oil prices was possible because interest rates in the bond
market didn’t make a new high along with oil prices. Even though you
may not have been right, you nevertheless needed to think about it.

Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

Examining the Peak Oil Concept
If you believe in the concept of peak oil, you believe that the world is running
out of oil. Proponents of this concept assert that global oil production will
probably reach a peak during this decade. After the peak, the world’s oil pro-
duction of crude oil will fall, never to rise again.
Although I’m not sure about peak oil, it doesn’t matter what I think, because
somewhere in the back of just about every oil trader’s mind is the thought
that the world may just be running out of oil — a thought that now maintains
essentially a permanent influence on the oil markets. Needless to say, the
concept of peak oil
 Gathered steam after the events of September 11, 2001, and it became
well established in many corridors of trading during the mega bull
market in oil that ensued.
 Received support in July 2005 when Saudi Arabia told the world that 
in ten years, its production wouldn’t be able to keep up with global
demand if demand continued to grow at rates that were prevalent at 
the time.
The Post-September 11, 2001, 
Mega Bull Market in Energy
After September 11, 2001, the world changed. The invasions of Afghanistan
and Iraq were only a small part of what happened, not so much in human 
and political terms, but rather in terms of the financial markets.
Figure 13-1 is a picture of the effect that the events of September 11, 2001,
had on energy and related markets. Just prior to September 11, 2001, the U.S.
was scrambling to recover from the bursting of the Internet bubble; however,
the attacks on the World Trade Center derailed the economic improvement
and plunged the country into a deep psychological and logistical nightmare
in which businesses closed their doors and job losses began to mount.
The four charts in Figure 13-1 summarize the five-year post-September 11,
2001, period, as of November 1, 2005. When looking at the figure, be sure to
note the factors in the list that follows, because they set the stage for the 
rest of the chapter.
234
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 The U.S. dollar went into a multiyear bear market. Money left the
United States as the Fed lowered interest rates, making the dollar less
attractive. Politically, the world also viewed the United States as unsta-
ble, unpredictable, and vulnerable because of the attacks. Note also that
the U.S. dollar rose out of the bear market as the Fed raised interest
rates during the period and that bond rates began to rise. The dollar
usually rises when interest rates (bond and/or central bank rates) rise
for a long enough period of time.
 Oil and natural gas entered once-in-a-lifetime secular bull markets. A
secular bull market is defined as one that lasts years to decades. It didn’t
take long for traders to start bidding up the price of oil, initially because
of the connection of the terrorists who attacked the U.S. to Saudi Arabia,
the world’s largest oil producer. However, as time passed, a new
dynamic developed as money began to flow into China.
In other words, as the U.S. appeared to be entering a period of uncer-
tainty, traders began looking for places where economic growth was not
as affected by what happened on September 11, 2001. They found China,
whose currency was pegged to the dollar.
As the dollar fell, so did the tendency of the Chinese yuan to remain
weak. It solidified even more, because the Chinese government artifi-
cially kept the currency at a level that would increase exports to other
countries, especially Europe and the United States. As more foreign
money flowed into China for those exports, the Chinese economy
became more and more able to produce goods and export them to the
entire world.

Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

 Long-term interest rates entered a downward sloping and wide trad-
ing range. The yield on the U.S. ten-year Treasury note initially rose,
because traders began to price in the likely collapse of the U.S. econ-
omy. By 2003, it was clear that the U.S. economy, although not as strong
as it would have been had September 11, 2001, not occurred, was not
going to collapse.
As the economy stabilized, interest rates began to rise. Note, though, that
the dollar didn’t bottom out until 2005, a full two years after bond yields
started to rise. That’s because these relationships can take significant
amounts of time to reach points in which they become evident. In other
words, sometimes it takes a large number of interest-rate increases and a
long period of rising bond yields to turn a major currency like the dollar
around. Don’t forget that the politics and general stability of a country
play big roles in how strong its currency will be. In the post-September
11, 2001, period, the markets were not immediately convinced that the
U.S. would be able to survive the attack and remain a major world power.
Understanding Supply and Demand
Wanna know a secret? Although most people think that demand is what
makes prices change, supply rules in the energy markets. As the U.S. econ-
omy slowed during the months that followed the World Trade Center attack,
the Chinese economy picked up steam, and its demand for oil increased.
The increased Chinese demand, however, was not enough to boost oil prices.
Instead, the markets correctly began to price in the possibility of attacks on
the oil-producing infrastructure and the increasing challenges of getting oil
out of the Middle East. More important, as the U.S. attacked Iraq, the market
again correctly factored the loss of Iraq’s oil supply into the markets.
Keep these important tidbits about the oil markets in mind:
 The world runs on oil, and any threat to the oil supply leads to rising
prices.
 As an oil trader, your primary goal is to consider the effects of events on
supply and to correlate those effects with your charts.
 Demand fluctuates, but supply is finite. Weeks are needed to ramp up
supply or to turn it back down. Refineries are a bottleneck in the system.
So even if plenty of oil is sitting in storage, if the refineries can’t turn it
into gasoline or heating oil, the supply of those products is impaired.
236
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

Playing the Sensible Market
The energy markets make sense, regardless of whether you believe in the
concept of peak oil.
Real companies have huge trading desks with hundreds of traders all betting
on the price of oil. Banks and brokers join oil, trucking, and airline companies
in using the oil markets on a daily basis to hedge their future price risks and
for pure speculation. Even Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch got into the oil
storage and distribution business in the early part of the 21st century in the
wake of September 11, 2001.
In other words, the oil market is about real people trying to figure out how
much oil they’re going to need to run their businesses in the next few months
to years, regardless of whether they’re suppliers or users.
Stock prices are built mostly on analysts’ drivel, such as price/earnings ratios
and new paradigms, such as the nonsense that sank the Internet stocks. Oil,
gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas prices, on the other hand, are based
more on real-life circumstances and aren’t usually influenced by the kind of
fiction spawned by slick Wall Street analysts penning negative e-mails about
the stocks they push onto the public.
237
Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures
Charting refinery capacity in the U.S.
The United States has not built a new refinery
since the 1970s. The combination of environmen-
tal concerns, red tape and paperwork, huge costs
in the billions of dollars, and the multiyear time
frame needed to finish a new refinery are prohib-
itive and have prevented any new oil-refining
capacity from coming online. In essence, the
United States is now in a position in which any
increase in demand for oil or oil products cannot
be met by domestic refinery capacity. That means
that now more than ever, the U.S. depends on for-
eign resources for its oil and refined products.
Damage to refining and shipping capabilities
caused by hurricanes Katrina and Rita brought
the U.S. refinery issue to the forefront as gaso-
line prices skyrocketed. The markets and con-
sumers also reacted as prices reached a level
that was high enough to decrease consumption
and lead to lower prices.
The net effect of the post-September 11, 2001, bull
market in oil, though, was to reset fuel prices at a
higher level than prior to that date. I don’t think
gasoline prices below $1.50 will ever be seen
again, barring some truly extraordinary event. If
the price goes that low, then I’m wrong — it can
happen.

Supply rules the energy markets, and here are the basics of it:
 The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) supplies 30
to 40 percent of the world’s oil. Russia, the next big supplier, and other
non-OPEC producers like Mexico, Norway, and the United Kingdom make
up the rest of the world’s supply. The United States also is an oil and nat-
ural gas producer, with Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico being the largest
areas. The U.S. ranks above Mexico and Canada in proven oil reserves.
The total oil reserves in the U.S. are roughly one-tenth of those in Saudi
Arabia.
 From a practical standpoint, supply is made up of production, or what
comes out of the ground, what can be refined, and what can be deliv-
ered, both before it gets to the refinery and after it’s refined into gaso-
line, heating oil, and diesel and other fuels.
 The potential for disruptions in supplies can occur at any of several
steps along the route from extraction through the point of sale, and each
step has its own unique chance of being the culprit for supply screw-ups
that make prices rise.
 Worker strikes, hurricanes and other natural disasters of all kinds, 
accidents, spills, sabotage, and even market manipulation by OPEC 
and other producers all end up affecting supply, not demand.
 Oil without a doubt is a political tool. The Venezuelan government 
didn’t like President Bush, so it threatened to cut shipments of oil to 
the United States. Sabotage of oil pipelines was a major weapon in 
Iraq in the early days of the U.S. invasion.
The one constant in supply, especially in the United States, is that not enough
refinery capacity is available to keep up with any more than normal demand.
That means when winters are extremely cold, refineries are a key bottleneck
in the oil delivery system.
In the new world, with China, India, and the U.S. gobbling up increasing sup-
plies of oil, oil markets in general have to deal with the reality that supplies
are going to be tighter than they were even five or ten years ago. That’s why
prices stayed high in spite of the fact that the war in Iraq settled into a less
hectic rhythm and why even if prices fall from levels above $50 per barrel,
the days of $10 oil are not likely to return in our lifetimes unless the global
economy collapses.
Handling Seasonal Cycles
Energy demand, especially for heating oil, gasoline, and natural gas, is
extremely seasonal in nature, and if you look at your own life, you can easily
understand how these cycles work.
238
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

In winter, you heat your house. If you live on the East Coast of the U.S., that
means you use heating oil. Everywhere else you burn natural gas and some-
times coal. Some areas rely on nuclear energy. Likewise, during summer, 
you drive your car or fly off somewhere colder than where you live to go 
on vacation.
Traders anticipate the ebb and flow of these cycles and factor them into their
bets. A good number of traders work for companies, energy and otherwise,
that use the futures market either to have fuel delivered to them for resale or
for their own use. Others use energy futures to hedge the cost of the energy
they need to run their businesses. Still others like you and me are speculating
and trying to make a buck.
All cycles are variable and describe the oil markets only in broad strokes, so
you never should expect the course of the oil business to be perfect each
time you trade. You will, however, be a better trader if you remain aware of
these cycles and watch for their presence. In general, crude oil futures
 Experience a lull in the spring months when refineries convert produc-
tion from heating oil to gasoline. When that happens, the price of heat-
ing oil starts to fall, and gasoline prices firm up.
 Swing up and down during the summer based on gasoline supplies. As
the end of the summer nears, another pause occurs when refineries
switch over from gasoline back to heating oil production.
This broad cycle became unreliable after September 11, 2001, because prices
bucked the cyclical trends and pretty much went higher.
Bear in mind, though, that a seasonal tendency for price action does exist.
For example, you don’t generally want to look to trade long on gasoline in
winter. Instead you want to focus on heating oil during cold-weather months.
At the same time, you need to consider natural gas as a potential short sale
during the spring and early summer.
Preparing for the Weekly Cycle
A more useful cycle hinges on what happens on Wednesday mornings — or
on Thursday mornings after three-day weekends. That’s when the American
Petroleum Institute (API) and the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA)
release their weekly supply data reports.
Analysts all pony up their estimates for the reports usually on Monday and
Tuesday. They’re all focusing on supply, not demand, and they want to know
whether inventories are building (increasing in supply) or drawing down
(decreasing in supply).
239
Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

Making trades based on the API and EIA supply data is a good idea to consider,
because you can generate some nice short-term profits if you play it right.
The markets focus mainly on the report from the EIA, because it’s a govern-
ment agency that requires companies to provide their supply statistics. The
API uses data supplied on a volunteer basis. Thus the API data tends to be
less exact because of its information-gathering system.
Analysts almost never get it right. That means that the market usually jumps
up or down after the data are released. I do just about everything I can possi-
bly do to rearrange my schedule so I can be in front of my trading screen
when that report is released.
A great time for a coffee break is at 10:30 a.m. eastern time Wednesdays so
you can watch for the energy supply data. Setting up some potential trades
ahead of the release of the reports can help you get a jump on executing
them based on the new supply data. Wednesdays can be the most profitable
day of the week in the energy pits.
Checking other sources before Wednesday
On Monday and Tuesday, I start scanning news sources for analysts’ opinions
about the oil market. Doing so gives me a good idea about what may happen
if the market is priced wrong regarding current supply levels.
Some good stuff to read before the release of the reports include Myra
Saefong’s column at MarketWatch.com (www.marketwatch.com). It pro-
vides a good summary of expectations. Reuters (www.reuters.com) and
Bloomberg (www.bloomberg.com) also provide good summaries of what the
market is setting itself up for when the data are released. If your broker gives
you access to good news data, Dow Jones Newswires is about as good as 
any source to get the same data. Dow Jones Newswires is a subscriber ser-
vice that is accessible online, usually through brokers and financial-service
institutions.
How to react to the report
Making trades based on the supply reports isn’t an exercise in being exact,
because analysts usually are clueless about what’s coming up. What you want
to look for are instances when they all agree one way or another. For example,
if they’re all leaning toward a build (increased supply) of crude, be ready for
the market to go higher if the report even hints of a supply shortage. The
same is true for when the market gets set up for a drawdown (decreased
supply) — be ready for the market to go lower if the report hints of more
abundant supplies. Here are a couple of tips for trading the supply reports:
240
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 Be careful when the report comes out. Give it some time before you
jump in. The first few trades can be volatile. After a minute or two, your
real-time chart should start to show you the way the market is headed.
 Consider some option strategies. As with other reports, a straddle is a
good potential strategy to consider. Other hedging techniques, such as
holding some long positions in blue-chip oil stocks and selling the
futures, or buying puts on the futures, also may work.
If the markets are surprised with the supply data in a big way, the move can
be huge, and prices are likely to gap up as the figure is released. In this case,
three scenarios can apply:
 You’re already out of the market. If you aren’t already in the market,
you miss a chance to make some money. However, don’t go chasing
prices trying to get into the market. You’ll end up being sorry.
 You have an established position. You take advantage of the data being
in your favor by ratcheting up your sell stops so you can take as much
profit as possible if the market happens to turn on you. If you’re using a
broker, you either gave him instructions on what to do in this situation,
or you better have his number on speed dial and hope that you’re one of
his favorite clients.
 Your position is stopped out. If you were in the market but were
stopped out because you guessed wrong, be glad you’re out. Reassess
your position and wait for a better opportunity. When you get stopped
out, it means that the stop-loss order you placed to limit your losses was
triggered as prices dropped to the level you specified.
Forecasting Oil Prices 
by Using Oil Stocks
One of the most reliable methods of forecasting futures prices is using the
action in oil stocks. John Murphy is one of the most prominent promoters of
this dynamic, and I’ve found his approach a very useful starting point.
Changes in oil stocks tend to precede the moves in oil prices and should also
confirm them. Sometimes oil stocks also will move along with or just after
crude oil futures.
Although oil stock prices may sound unpredictable, under normal circum-
stances, as a new bull market in oil starts, oil stocks will either start rising
along with crude prices before or right after crude oil futures start rising.
Much of the time, although not always, oil stocks will rise or fall before the
price of crude oil rises or falls.
241
Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

Similarly, as the falling trend line of a bear market in oil takes hold, oil stocks
will either break sometime before, along with, or just after crude oil futures.
Figure 13-2 provides a good example of the dynamic.
Take note of how
 The price of Exxon Mobil stock bottomed out before the oil index (XOI)
took off.
 The XOI index began to rally at a much steeper rate of rise than the
December 2005 crude oil futures (CLZ5) contract. Some of the steeper
rise is caused by the fact that the volume of trading in the December
2005 contracts didn’t pick up until 2003 and then really started booming
in 2004. Nevertheless, oil stocks clearly began to rally before the futures.
 Oil service stocks (OSX) kept pace with the XOI and Exxon.
 Exxon stopped rallying in February 2005, while oil futures and the rest of
the oil stocks continued to move higher. Every time oil futures made a
new high, Exxon didn’t confirm them — a classic technical divergence
that requires confirmation. Figure 13-2 shows a classic double-top pattern
in Exxon. A double top is when the market reaches a price that’s similar to
a previous price and then rolls over. A double top is a sign of failing price
momentum. Notice how the double top in Exxon was followed by a break-
down in the price of oil, which on November 1 dropped below $60.
Figure 13-3 is an enlarged version of Figure 13-2, and it shows in greater detail
how the double top in Exxon coincided with the breakdown in the price of
the December crude oil contract and how the break in the stock preceded the
break in the futures. Be sure to check out these points in Figure 13-3:

 Relative strength indicator (RSI) for Exxon and for CLZ5: Lower highs
are found on both charts; however, the Exxon chart also shows clear
overhead resistance on the stock’s price, a sign that sellers are waiting
to unload as soon as Exxon nears $64 per share.
 How the crude futures chart continues to make new highs: The RSI
oscillator for crude futures also is cause for concern for the same reason,
because it also fails to confirm the new high in crude, a sign of a momen-
tum failure.
When the price of Exxon stock no longer confirms the new high in crude oil,
it’s time to start being careful and monitoring the momentum and trend indi-
cators so you can prepare to sell your crude futures position. In other words,
Exxon, in this case, flashed a correct warning sign that oil prices were likely
to fall.
As a futures trader, the situation shown in Figure 13-2 gave you little choice
but to continue to trade crude futures on the long side. However, in this case,
because Exxon was warning you, and the RSI oscillator was not confirming
the rallies, you need to be very careful and use tight stop-loss points or con-
sider trading only with options to curb your risk.

Burning the Midnight Oil
Crude oil trades around the world, but New York’s Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX) is considered the hub of global oil trading.
Light, sweet crude is high-grade, low-sulfur crude oil that is more easily
refined than thicker oils. It also yields better products. When it isn’t going 
by that name, it’s called West Texas Intermediate. High-sulfur crude, such 
as that which comes from Venezuela and certain Saudi Arabian wells,
requires special refineries that process only the heavier crudes.
NYMEX also provides trading platforms for futures contracts based on the
following:
 Dubai crude oil. This contract is a futures contract for Dubai crude oil.
 The differential between the light, sweet crude oil futures contract and
Canadian Bow River crude at Hardisty, Alberta.
 The differentials between the light, sweet crude oil futures contract and
four domestic grades of crude oil, including Light Louisiana Sweet, West
Texas Intermediate-Midland, West Texas Sour, and Mars Blend.
 Brent North Sea crude oil.
 Oil options.
Crude oil is the world’s most actively traded commodity, and the NYMEX
contract for light, sweet crude is the most liquid of all crude oil contracts.
The NYMEX Web site (www.nymex.com) is well worth a visit.
Here are the particulars of a crude oil contract:
 Contract: Each crude oil contract contains 1,000 barrels of oil that will
be delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.
The e-mini contract trades on the CME Globex electronic platform are
cleared at NYMEX and hold 500 barrels of light, sweet crude.
 Valuation: A barrel of oil holds 42 gallons and trades in U.S. dollars per
barrel worldwide. The minimum tick of $0.01 (1 cent) is equal to $10 per
contract.
 Trading: NYMEX offers both open-cry trading during regular hours and
electronic, Web-based trading after hours. Open outcry trading hours
are from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. After-hours futures trading takes place on
the NYMEX ACCESS, an Internet-based trading platform, starting at 
244
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

3:15 p.m. Monday through Thursday and ending at 9:30 a.m. the follow-
ing day. Sunday trading starts at 7 p.m.
 Margins: The initial crude oil contract margin for nonmembers as of July
2005 was $4,725 (April 2005 through September 2005), with the mainte-
nance margin for customers at $3,500.
 Settlement: Contract settlement is physical, and delivery takes place at
Cushing, Oklahoma, or similar pipeline or transfer facilities.
Contract listings and termination dates can be found at www.nymex.com/
lsco_fut_termin.aspx.
Getting the Lead Out with Gasoline
Gasoline has become a hugely important contract for several reasons. It is
the largest-selling refined product sold in the United States and accounts for
almost half of the nation’s oil consumption. Two important factors that you
need to know about the gasoline futures contract are that
 Refinery capacity is limited. As the global economy continues to grow,
the global demand for gasoline also is rising. As is true in the United
States, the number of cars in China also is growing, contributing to this
increased global demand. For many of the same reasons, environmental
and otherwise, gasoline demand outpaced refinery capacity for a good
portion of 2005.
 International competition for oil and geopolitical problems in South
America are on the rise. Although a bit more subtle, the importance of
Venezuela as a major exporter of oil and gasoline to the United States is
becoming a major global market factor. As rhetoric grew more intense
between Venezuela’s president Hugo Chavez and the United States in
2005, so did the risk of Venezuela cutting off exports.
As I write, no evidence suggests that Venezuela actually is cutting off exports
to the United States, but the Chavez government is actively pursuing the
development of alternative markets for its oil products, including China and
other areas of South America. Indeed, Chavez is making production, explo-
ration, and refinery deals with Russia, Brazil, India, Iran, and Cuba. At some
point, if Chavez is successful, the United States may indeed encounter supply
problems. I’d expect that the U.S. can buy oil and gasoline from alternative
sources. The key is that prices are likely to be higher because of the logistics
involved.

Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

Contract specifications
You need a $5,400 initial margin per contract to trade a gasoline futures 
contract in all months except August and September, when you need $6,750.
Market activity for August and September contracts is higher because they
are peak months during the summer driving season. Maintenance margins
are $4,000 and $5,000, respectively.
A contract gives you control of 1,000 barrels or 42,000 gallons of unleaded
gasoline. A 25-cent move in the per-gallon price of gasoline is worth $10,500
per contract, and that amount is the limit move. Each tick of $0.01 (1 cent) 
is worth $4.20 per barrel. Delivery is physical to the New York harbor.
Trading strategies
Keep the following general tendencies in mind when trading gasoline con-
tracts, but understand that they’re not guaranteed to occur or to follow 
any particular script.
Gasoline prices tend to move along with prices for crude oil; however, gaso-
line prices are not guaranteed to mirror crude prices, because they move
according to their own supply and demand scenario.
Gasoline prices tend to be the highest during summer months when demand
is highest. Prices tend to rally for the July, August, and September gasoline
futures contracts during April and May. Figure 13-4 shows the start of the rally
in the September contract at the beginning of May. The figure also exhibits
choppiness in the market as expectations for less driving are incorporated
into gasoline prices. This chart is particularly important, because it shows 
the consistency of the overall seasonal pattern. In 2005, gasoline supplies
were below historical stockpiles because of an overall tightness in the market
and problems experienced within the refinery industry.
You also need to take note within Figure 13-4 that although Hurricane Katrina
pushed gasoline futures prices above $2, the seasonal pattern held. Aside
from the usual decrease in demand caused by seasonal factors, in this case,
the market was essentially flooded with gasoline imports from Europe, while
President Bush also suspended the need for refining a multitude of different
grades of gasoline that normally are produced to meet clean-air standards.
The combination of these three individual variables led to the decline in
gasoline prices.

Part IV: Commodity Futures 

Keeping the Chill Out with Heating Oil
The price of heating oil has a tendency to rise as the winter months approach.
As is true with all energy commodities, supply is the key, and chart watching
is as important as keeping up with supply when trading heating oil futures.
After gasoline, heating oil, which also is known as No. 2 fuel oil, makes up
about 25 percent of the yield from a barrel of crude oil. Here are the particu-
lars of trading heating oil futures:
 Contract: Heating oil futures trade in the same units as gasoline: 1,000
barrels of 42 gallons each, or a total of 42,000 gallons. The contract is
based on delivery to New York harbor, the principal cash-market trading
center.
 Margins: Margins for heating oil are quite high, and they’re based on a
tiered structure that’s designed to give a more precise assessment of
risk. Each tier consists of at least one futures month, and all of the
months within a given tier are consecutive. In general, as of August 2005,
the Group 1 margin for nonmembers was $6,075. Groups 2 through 4 ini-
tial margins, respectively, were $5,738, $5,063, and $4,388. Maintenance
margins, respectively, were $4,500, $4,250, $3,750, and $3,250.
If you trade nearby contracts, contracts that expire in months that are in
close proximity to the current month, your margin will be higher,
because the volatility and the chance for profit is higher, and you’re
being charged a premium for that.
 Valuation: The price relationship of each tick is identical to gasoline,
with 1 cent equaling $4.20 per barrel.
The airline industry, refiners, and others in the oil business use the heating
oil futures contract to hedge diesel-fuel and jet-fuel prices, which ultimately
means that you’re trading against a savvy group of adversaries when you
trade heating oil contracts.
Figures 13-4 and 13-5 also show the general tendency of heating oil to rally
with oil, gasoline, and natural gas prices. During the time frame depicted in
the figure, the contract started to show some price compression in late
August and had joined gasoline in diverging from crude oil prices, which sug-
gested that a big move was coming.
Looking for confirmation from different markets is important. As Figures 13-4
and 13-5 show, the energy complex was running into trouble. Crude oil
topped out first, followed by gasoline, heating oil, and finally natural gas.

Getting Natural with Gas
Natural gas is an increasingly popular fuel. Its reputation for burning cleaner
than crude oil and coal has made it the number-one choice of environmental-
ists and a commodity with a rising demand profile.
Russia has the world’s largest natural gas reserves. The United States has
roughly a tenth of the reserves of Russia, and Iran has the second-largest nat-
ural gas reserves.
Natural gas supplies about 25 percent of the energy used in the United States
and is increasingly important in generating electricity, especially during the
summer months, when it is used primarily for air conditioning.
Natural gas contracts have nine margin tiers, with initial margin requirements
ranging from $10,800 at Tier 1 down to $2,025 at Tier 9. The range of the main-
tenance margins is from $8,800 at Tier 1 down to $1,650 at Tier 9.
A natural gas contract gives you control of 10,000 million British thermal
units (mmBtu), and a 0.1 cent move is equal to $10 per contract.
Aside from the usual supply-and-demand dynamics, natural gas is subject to
pressures from the hurricane season, because many major natural gas rigs
are located in the Gulf of Mexico. Figure 13-5 shows how natural gas prices
held up better than heating oil and gasoline during the week and weekend
leading up to the climactic run toward land of Hurricane Katrina.
Getting in Tune with Sentiment 
and the Energy Markets
Sentiment is a nebulous (unclear) concept. To some it can mean sadness; to
others, it means great joy. In the financial markets, it means greed and fear.
Greed usually is associated with market tops, while fear usually is the hall-
mark of market bottoms. These diverging concepts are, of course, what make
up the contrarian thesis of investing. (For more information about contrarian
thinking, see Chapter 7.)
In the summer of 2005, when oil prices had risen by roughly 50 percent from
the previous summer, the huge rise in prices was attributed to a three-
pronged combination of refinery problems, significant weather changes, and
steady economic growth, compounded by event fear and fanned by the
flames of the greatest extension of a bull market in oil that started after
September 11, 2001.
250
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

It was in this context that I was prompted to start carefully tracking market
sentiment.
When I appeared on CNBC on August 24, 2005, the first question I was asked
was, “How high can oil go?” My response was that $60 or $70 was possible,
but that I wasn’t sure. I also said that the market had been going up for some
time and that it was due for a pause.
When I returned to my office after the interview, the network pundits were
talking to Professor Michael Economides, author of The Color of Oil (Round
Oak Publishing, 2000), and he was predicting $100 oil, although he didn’t say
by when. All day long on CNBC and elsewhere in the financial media, cover-
age of the oil markets was rather dramatic, and so were the perceptions of
what was coming.
The next day oil prices fell more than a dollar, and the headline “SCREAMS AT
THE PUMP” appeared on the Drudge Report a few days later, signifying that
life in the oil markets was about to become even more interesting.
By August 26, 2005, the market was trying to decide what effect Hurricane
Katrina was going to have. The market close on that Friday was inconclusive,
but by Sunday, August 28, it became clear that Katrina was a major storm and
that the oil infrastructure in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast area, which is
responsible for a major portion of the energy supply and distribution of the
United States, was in peril.
Although oil had traded above $70 per barrel as the storm was brewing
overnight August 28, not enough data were available to support prices at that
level. As the storm hit on the morning of August 29, damage reports began
trickling in, and by August 30, oil finally burst above $70 per barrel during a
regular trading session.
As the news of the storm trickled in, and the damage assessment became
clear, the oil market took on an entirely new, extremely serious tone that was
certain to suddenly make the American public keenly aware of daily price
fluctuations.
By the end of trading August 30, crude oil futures for October closed at 69.85,
just shy of $70, but nevertheless, still at an all-time record high.
On September 17, I appeared on the Financial Sense News Hour radio show
with Jim Puplava, and Jim and I both agreed that oil prices were looking as if
they were making a top. Few other analysts were on that side of the trade at
the time. I submitted an article to Rigzone.com, in which I reported the con-
versation Jim and I had, and I forwarded the article to CNBC, which was inter-
ested enough to call me back for an interview.
251
Chapter 13: Getting Slick and Slimy: Understanding Energy Futures

I was back on CNBC the week after I made the call on the Jim Puplava show,
and told them that if oil fell below $56, it could go to $40. During the next sev-
eral weeks, the oil market dropped from the $70 area to around $60 by
November 1, when Republicans were agreeing with the Democrats in
Congress and starting to discuss adding a windfall tax to oil companies for
making too much money, another sign that prices could fall further.
A second storm, Hurricane Rita, also hit the Gulf region just a few weeks after
Katrina, but the damage, although significant, was not as bad.
By the time this book is released, the full story of Katrina’s wrath may be told
as events unfold.
What was apparent in November is that at least 50 percent of the oil and nat-
ural gas production infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico was off-line, although
refinery capacity was steadily coming back online. The United States was run-
ning on imported gasoline from Europe, and yet prices still were going lower,
and still people were calling for $100-per-barrel oil.
Some Final Thoughts about Oil
I’ll end this chapter with a list of some final thoughts to illustrate several
points that you need to know about the oil markets in the summer of 2005:
 The bull market in oil was three to four years old. If you count
September 11, 2001, as the date of its birth, or just a little beyond that
point in time, that means the bull market was getting old, even by secu-
lar, or long-term bull market standards, which are measured in years and
sometimes decades.
 The prevailing wisdom in August 2005 was that oil prices couldn’t go
anywhere but up. The world, after all, was running out of oil, and the
global economy could never slow down.
 Mainstream media, the majority of the experts, and the tabloids were
starting to pick up the chant about impending high oil prices. The only
reasonable conclusion was that oil was ready to make a top. I still get
chills when I realize that contrarian analysis worked so well during that
period.
Always trade with the trend, but develop a sense of when the market can
turn, and don’t be afraid to put your money where your mouth is. Don’t let
what you want to see happen get in the way of what’s happening. And don’t
let what you’d like to happen get in the way of your trading. The market will
almost always prove you wrong until you throw in the towel on your beliefs
and what your analysis is telling you. Then, if you’re not careful, it will swal-
low you whole.

W
hen I think of heavy metal, I think of loud music, long hair, and fast
guitar licks. And if you look hard enough, you may even see me at one
of those increasingly popular 1980s metal shows during the summer, because
I like to see those old boys still strut their stuff.
The other side of heavy metal has nothing to do with music, but it’s still quite
industrial and can be just as profitable as record sales and concert grosses
for some of the more famous heavy metal bands of the 1980s.
Indeed, metal futures (you knew I’d get around to it, didn’t you) experienced
a significant revival because the global economy, largely influenced by
aggressive growth in China, has brought the luster back into what was a
largely faded area of the futures markets.
Metals are divided into two major categories: precious and industrial. The
markets of the two different classes look at the same side of the economy but
from different angles. Although precious metals are thought of as hedges
against inflation, price changes in the industrial metals usually are precur-
sors to the start and often the end of economic cycles.
In this chapter, I focus on gold and copper, but I also tie in enough informa-
tion about silver, platinum, and the other industrial metals to understand
how the markets for each of them work.

From a trading standpoint, especially from that of a beginner, the best way to
get started in the metals markets, in general, is to become familiar with the
gold and copper markets. They are the two most economically sensitive of all
the metals.
Tuning in to the Economy
The prices of precious and industrial metals are linked to economic activity.
Gold steals all the headlines, but the industrial metals do much of the work.
Here’s what I mean: Rising economic activity leads to increasing demand for
industrial metals. When industrial activity reaches the point where demand
starts to outstrip supply, inflationary pressures start to build in the system.
At that point, gold prices can start to rise.
Industrial metal prices are sensitive to demand. Copper prices, especially,
can be a leading indicator of an increase in economic activity, given the wide-
spread use of the metal in housing, electronics, and commercial construction.
The flip side is that the copper market can start to sag, and prices can start
to drop several months ahead of the data, such as Gross Domestic Product
numbers (see the section on “Getting into Metal without the Leather: Trading
Copper,” later in this chapter).
The key word here is can. With most of the world’s supply of gold in the hands
of central banks — whose main goal is fighting inflation — the managers of
those central banks know that speculators see rising gold prices as a sign of
inflation. When gold rallies tend to get out of hand, central banks start selling
the metal from their huge stockpiles, and prices eventually fall.
No one really knows whether central banks are heavy buyers of gold when
the price starts to fall; however, it is plausible that when the fears of deflation
hit the market or prices continually decline, central banks can become gold
buyers of last resort.
The fact that central banks tend to be gold sellers during rallies doesn’t mean
that gold prices can’t rally for significant periods of time. It just means that
central banks are a formidable market opponent of the everyday trader and
that the days of straight-up advances in gold where smart speculators make
or break their lifetime’s fortune, although still possible, are not as likely as
they once were.
And just so you don’t go around thinking that I’m pushing conspiracy theo-
ries, you can check out all kinds of extreme and sensible commentaries on
central banks and gold anywhere on the Internet.
254
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

A good commentary at Financial Sense.com (www.financialsense.
com/fsu/editorials/2004/0308.html) summarizes a fully disclosed
five-year plan of gold sales by central banks.
The highlights are simple. The central banks
 Acknowledge that gold is “an important element of global monetary
reserves.”
 Set limits of sales over the five-year period of the program to no more
than 500 tons per year and no more than 2,500 tons over the entire five-
year period.
 Won’t sell more gold than they have in reserve.
 Review the agreement in five years.
The bottom line is that gold is a tricky market because of central banks and
the role they play in it. On the other hand, industrial metals such as copper
offer more transparency in their pricing patterns because of their close rela-
tionship with economic expectations and economic activity.
From an investment standpoint, gold still is central to the world’s monetary
system, no longer because it is a standard for payments, but rather because
it is the most strategic holding common to the world’s central banks and
often is used as a tool to cool off the world’s view of inflation.
When you invest in gold, you’re swimming against the tide. The world’s cen-
tral banks hold 25 percent of all the gold ever mined. According to the World
Gold Council, in 2003, central banks held ten times the amount of gold that
was mined in that year — 33,000 metric tons housed in vaults versus 3,200
metric tons mined. I’m not saying that you need to avoid gold completely; I’m
simply noting that the average investor is up against a gargantuan market-
making opponent in the world’s central banks.
Gold Market Fundamentals
South Africa is the world’s largest producer of gold, accounting for 25 percent
or more of all global production and 50 percent of the accessible reserves.
Russia, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Brazil make up the rest of
the top-tier producers.
The all-time high in gold prices was set in January 1980, when the price of 
the October contract hit $1,026 per ounce as the spot-market price rallied 
to $875. As I write in August 2005, gold is trading near $440 per ounce.
255
Chapter 14: Getting Metallic without Getting Heavy

Here are two key factors to keep in mind about the gold market:
 Two major influences have an effect on gold prices. They are
• Major political upheaval. Political crises tend to be the major
reason for gold prices to rise.
• Inflation. The influence of inflation on gold prices is much less
intense than it was in the past because of the management of gold
prices by the central banks.
 The most reliable influence in the gold market is its relationship to
the U.S. dollar. Figures 14-1 and 14-2 show how the trends of gold and
the U.S. dollar were reversed after the events of September 11, 2001. The
Federal Reserve (the Fed) lowered interest rates, in effect printing
money and decreasing the value of the dollar, which brought the gold
bugs out of hibernation.
Gold prices and the U.S. dollar tend to go in reverse of each other. This rela-
tionship is not a perfect one, but it is worth looking for, and over long periods
of time, it tends to hold up well.
The price of gold can be confusing, so here’s a quick primer.
The international benchmark price for gold is the London Price Fix, which is
set in U.S. dollars and is quoted in troy ounces twice daily as the a.m. fix and
the p.m. fix. The London exchange summarizes global gold trading as these
composite prices.
Gold trades around the world on major exchanges in China, the United
Kingdom (UK), and the United States. India and China are countries with
expanding demand for gold.
Spot gold and gold futures trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange
(NYMEX). Gold futures also trade on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) and
have relatively low margin requirements for speculators. That means gold
can be an attractive market for small accounts. As of August 2005, initial
margin was $1,350, and maintenance was $1,000. The mini contract for gold
futures also trades on CBOT.
Mini contracts are smaller versions of the original contract. In the case of gold,
a mini contract contains 33.2 troy ounces of gold, compared with a full-sized
contract that holds 100 troy ounces. The margin requirements are smaller, but
the general characteristics and fundamentals of the market remain the same.
The mini contract has a $317 initial margin and a $235 maintenance margin —
compared to $952 and $705 for the full-sized contract at the CBOT.
Several reliable information sources for gold can be found on the Internet.
Two of the ones I like to use are the World Gold Council (www.gold.org)
and Kitco.com (www.kitco.com).
256
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

When trading gold and gold futures, you need to watch the following:
 Actions taken by central banks around the world: Central banks tend
to be net sellers. As a general rule, they either sell or stay out of the mar-
kets. See “Tuning in to the Economy,” earlier in this chapter.
The Fed, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, and the
National Bank of Switzerland usually are major players in the gold
market, but any central bank is a potential seller, especially during 
periods of heightened inflationary expectations.

Chapter 14: Getting Metallic without Getting Heavy

 The geopolitical situation: Asia, the Middle East, and South America 
are global regions full of potential instability. The chance for terrorist
attacks is rising on a daily basis and is likely to become something 
that remains a big influence from time to time during the next several
decades.
 Wars: Wars can lead to volatility in the price of gold. The expectations
for higher prices during wars is often not met, given the frequency of
major regional conflicts around the world and the frequent selling by
central banks.
 General weakness of the dollar and other major global currencies:
The general relationship is for gold to rise when the dollar weakens. 
As with other traditional relationships, this rule isn’t set in stone, but
rather a tendency caused by central-bank intervention in the gold and
currency markets.
 Inflation: If the Fed starts talking seriously about inflation and starts
raising interest rates aggressively, the gold market is likely to respond
with higher prices. For a major rally in gold to develop, the markets have
to start believing that central banks can no longer control inflation. That
hasn’t happened since the 1970s. In 2005, though, the Fed and other
global central banks began talking more seriously about inflation. When
they did, gold prices began showing some rising power.
 Technical analysis indicators: They can keep you on the right side of
the trade. As with other markets (see Chapter 7 for an overview of tech-
nical analysis), moving averages, trend lines, and oscillators such as the
MACD and RSI work with gold prices and need to be an integral part of
your gold trading.
Getting into the habit of looking at long-term commodity charts on a weekly
basis makes you better able to deal with any titanic shifts in the long-term
trend, such as what occurred September 11, 2001. Figure 14-2 clearly marks
the “inflection point” in the gold market’s key reversal and subsequent 
bull run.
Lining the Markets with Silver
Silver is a hybrid metal, because it is used for industrial purposes and as a
precious metal in jewelry. The silver market is extremely volatile and can be
difficult to trade.
Mexico and the U.S. are the largest producers of silver. Silver mines usually
can’t be operated profitably when market prices fall below $8 per ounce. As a
result, when prices fall below that level, production of silver wanes consider-
ably, with much of it coming as a byproduct of copper, lead, and zinc mining
processes.
258
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

When trading silver, you need to know these nuts and bolts:
 One silver contract contains 5,000 troy ounces, with a 1 cent move being
worth $50.
 The modern-day trading range for silver is from 35 cents during the
Great Depression up to $50 per ounce when the Hunt brothers tried to
corner the silver market in the late 1970s.
 When copper, lead, and zinc prices rise, especially because of decreased
production, the price of silver is likely to rally, because much of the
world’s silver is a byproduct of mining and processing the other three
metals.
Catalyzing Platinum
The platinum market is heavily influenced by Japan, where it’s the precious
metal of choice. Although a precious metal, platinum also has hybrid quali-
ties. In fact, it is more often used as the key component in making catalytic
converters for cars.
The relative economic strengths in Japan, in the automobile market and in
the medical and dental fields — where platinum is also in demand — are the
major influences on the price of platinum.
Platinum trades on the NYMEX in contracts containing 100 troy ounces. It can
be thinly traded, though, and is best avoided by beginning traders. As with
gold, South Africa is the world’s largest producer, with Russia second, and
North America, where some recent finds have occurred, third.
As with any other market, you can apply the usual method of finding out
about the fundamentals combined with technical analysis.
Platinum usually trades at a higher price than gold, because supply is much
smaller — only 80 tons of the metal reach the market in any given year. For
example, on October 28, 2005, platinum futures closed at $941 per troy
ounce, while gold futures closed at $474.
Industrializing Your Metals
Technical indicators are the key to predicting future trends in industrial
metals, so you need to be on the lookout for the early clues before a trend
changes.
259
Chapter 14: Getting Metallic without Getting Heavy

The most important industrial metals (copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead,
and palladium) start to rally when the market senses that demand is starting
to increase, or they start to fall back when it senses supplies starting to stabi-
lize. In general terms, then, at these transition points, trends in the industrial
metals markets start to turn. As a trader, you can’t get caught in the expecta-
tions game, though. You need to wait for the markets to make their moves.
No prize is awarded for being the first trader to buy something.
Although gold still is an important asset, the industrial metals complex is a
better place for speculators to trade, because it’s where supply and demand
information and easily measured economic fundamentals (with good correla-
tion to prices) are available and tested by price action and overall response
in the markets.
Getting into Metal without the 
Leather: Trading Copper
Copper is the third most used metal in the world, and it’s found virtually
everywhere around the globe. The most active copper mines are in the
United States, Chile, Mexico, Australia, Indonesia, Zaire, and Zambia.
A beginning trader may be tempted to dive into the gold market, but some
good reasons exist for considering copper first, especially its close connec-
tion to the economic cycle and the housing market.
Generally, I like to trade markets that have a good correlation to a sector of
the stock market where I have access to company earnings and where indus-
try executives are required by law to provide truthful information to the
market using widely disseminated means, such as television and major media
outlets. You can see what I mean in the next section.
Before that, though, there are few things that you need to know about copper
before you start trading it, and they have nothing to do with leather, smoke-
filled stages, or headbanging. The keys to trading copper that I tell you about
in this list set the stage for the more-involved data that follow.
 Uses: The major uses for copper are in
• Construction and housing for plumbing and wiring
• High technology for wiring
• Semiconductor-related industries for wiring
260
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 Markets: Copper trades at the COMEX, which is a division of the NYMEX
in New York, and at the London Metals Exchange. The London contract
trades several times more than the U.S. contract in terms of volume, but
both are liquid and active contracts.
 Contracts: The COMEX contract is for 25,000 pounds of copper, while
the London contract is for 55,000 pounds. New York prices are quoted in
dollars and cents per pound, while London prices are quoted in dollars
and cents per ton. Thus, a 1-cent move in New York is worth $250, while
a $1 move in London in worth $25.
You can use stock prices and trends as predictors of industrial metal prices.
Setting up your copper-trading strategy
Figuring out key relationships within any market is your first step when ana-
lyzing it from a technical standpoint. One of my favorites is the relationship
between the copper market and the stock of Phelps Dodge, and in turn, its
relationship with the bond and housing markets. These interrelationships are
as important as any you can find in the futures market, primarily because all
the pieces depend on one another for a complete picture of their respective
markets to emerge. Here’s why:
 Phelps Dodge is a leading smelter and producer of copper. As a result,
the stock has an excellent record of predicting the trend in market for
the metal. Stock investors start betting on the future trend of earnings
for the company based on their expectations for copper demand, and
thus, its connection to the company’s earnings.
 The housing market has a good correlation to the price action of hous-
ing stocks. The key is the information provided in monthly housing
reports, especially housing starts and building permits. These two
reports are the lifeline of the whole equation, because the Fed looks at
them closely as it tries to figure out what to do with interest rates.
The housing stock that you use for this purpose needs to be one that
behaves similarly in each cycle. I usually use Centex (NYSE symbol:
CTX) or Toll Brothers (NYSE symbol: TOL), because they are large capi-
talization stocks that service significant portions of the housing market.
Toll Brothers is an upscale builder that usually is one of the last to top
out because it serves richer customers who can last longer. Centex is a
good cross-section builder that also works on commercial properties.
 The bond market takes its cues from inflationary indications. For
example, if housing prices rise too rapidly, and signs of bottlenecks
appear in commodities markets for copper and lumber, the bond market
would start to sell off and interest rates would rise.
261
Chapter 14: Getting Metallic without Getting Heavy

Charting the course
Putting copper market interrelationships together requires you to keep a
close watch on charts of the components that I explained in the previous sec-
tion, including copper futures, shares of Phelps Dodge Corporation, housing
starts and building permits, and the bond market.
Figures 14-3 and 14-4 show good examples of how these relationships work.
Notice the general trends of the metal (Figure 14-3) and the stock (Figure
14-4) and how they usually change directions within a close time frame of
each other. Phelps Dodge topped in March, while the metal was drifting
lower. Soon after, though, the metal made a new low, and both rallied starting
in May and heading into August.
In Figure 14-5, you can see how housing starts started drifting lower in the
spring of 2005 after hitting a high point in January. The slowing of housing
starts correlates well with an intermediate-term top seen in the price of
Phelps Dodge stock. Notice that as housing starts stabilized, Phelps Dodge
and copper each staged yet another rally, reaching new highs as it extended
into August.
According to Figure 14-7 (later in this section), Centex, a good representative
of the housing sector, rallied a full two years before Phelps Dodge took off on
its own rally. The reason the rally in Centex led to the rally in Phelps Dodge
shows up in Figure 14-6. Copper prices were forming a base in the late 1990s,
but only when the market started to price in the fact that demand for the
metal would likely outstrip supply did the rally in Phelps Dodge begin.

Check out Figure 14-7 to see something very important: Centex (right), a
major U.S. homebuilder, began to falter at the same time housing starts began
to drift. This move is more obvious in Figure 14-8, which shows the U.S. ten-
year Treasury note yield rising dramatically on August 6, 2005, in response to
a strong U.S. employment report. Note that on the day of the big move up in
interest rates, Centex fell apart.

By August 16, Phelps Dodge also had fallen, but then something interesting
happened in September and October. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico coast, leading to massive housing and commercial building
destruction.
As a result, the market started pricing in a rebound in new construction, dri-
ving prices higher.

At the same time, China’s economy, as measured by gross domestic product
(GDP), continued to grow at a 9.4-percent clip as the U.S. economy grew at a
faster-than-expected rate, and copper prices moved to a slightly new high 
as the market factored in a rise in demand for copper in the wake of the
rebuilding.
My point is that markets react to circumstances as well as perception. A
major top in copper was building as the housing market began to respond to
higher interest rates, but an intangible set of events — in this case, the hurri-
canes — and the persistent growth of the Chinese and American economies
led to a new leg up in prices. These circumstances give more credence to the
relationship between interest rates, the price of copper, and the housing
market.
Organizing the charts
I find it useful to organize the way I look at my charts on a time line, and you
may benefit from organizing the way you look at charts, too. Here are the
steps that I take:
1. Look at daily charts.
Starting with a glimpse of daily charts helps you to get the current pic-

2. Look at longer-term charts.
I like to take a step back and view charts spanning years so I can put 
the current picture (from Step 1) in the right perspective. Orienting 
the short-term with longer-term charts helps you decide whether the
current trading activity is within the long-term trend or a countertrend
move.
3. Look at shorter-term charts.
By shorter-term, I mean checking out charts that span either a few days
or maybe even only an intraday time period (hours or even minutes)
with an eye on optimizing my entry and exit points.
Use a charting program that enables you to look at more than one chart at a
time.
Here’s what you need to watch for when viewing your charts:
 Differing time lines: By looking at the same chart using at least three
different time lines, you focus in on a much clearer picture of what’s hap-
pening in the market. With practice, you can compile the trio of time line
data in only a few minutes.
 Overall trends: Using a long-term chart like the one in Figure 14-5 as your
guide, you can check out a market’s overall trend. You need to plan your
trades based on the primary long-term trend. For example, if copper is in
a three-year uptrend, you can expect pullbacks. You can short the pull-
backs whenever they look like they’re going to last. However, as a trader,
your main focus needs to be on trading the long side until an irrefutable
break to the downside occurs. When that break occurs, you need to turn
your sites to short selling, all the time knowing that you’ll eventually get
short-term opportunities to go long.
 Trend lines: Never ignore a sustained move above or below a multiyear
trend line. Watch trend lines closely. Figure 14-6 shows a new bull market
forming in copper, starting in 2003 as the multiyear downtrend line was
broken. So just as Pink Floyd sings, “How can you have any pudding if
you don’t eat your meat?” if you trade futures, keep this in mind: If you
don’t read your charts, you’ll miss important turning points in the
market.
 Divergence in your charts: Make sure copper stocks and copper futures
are moving in the same general direction. If they’re not, you have a tech-
nical divergence, a situation that can result in one of two scenarios:
• Futures will turn in the direction of the stocks.
• Stocks will turn in the direction of the futures.
266
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

Figures 14-3 and 14-4 show a small divergence between Phelps Dodge
and the September futures contract. Although they bottomed in May, the
move in copper was stronger than in the stock. It took until June for the
full reversal in Phelps Dodge to confirm the rally in the futures.
 Interest-rate trends: Interest-rate trends are your leading indicator,
because the housing market thrives on low interest rates. The big move
up in rates in early 2005 was not the top in copper, but it was enough to
take the wind out of the rally’s sails for quite some time.
Making sure fundamentals 
are on your side
Success in the futures market depends on how well you know the market in
which you’re trading, technically and fundamentally. The economically sensi-
tive metal markets are too difficult to trade without using both technical and
fundamental analyses.
Here are some key tips for how you can make sense of technical and funda-
mental information:
 Check housing starts. This key report shows you whether the current
trend in copper is sustainable. For example, housing starts were flat in
June 2005, a factor that was reflected in the July 19 report, which you
can view at The Wall Street Journal online, www.wsj.com, when you 
subscribe.
 Look beyond the headlines. The full text of the June housing report
contained some important details about single-family home starts being
down 2.5 percent from the May report. However, the number of building
permits still was rising so that particular number held up the market.
Still, as the newspapers flaunted the never-ending housing boom, the
June report was cautionary.
 Check supply and demand. You need to know what supply-and-demand
indicators like the Purchasing Manager’s (ISM) reports are saying.
A good way to get a grip on supply and demand is to see which industries
are reporting growth and which are not from the ISM report, which also is
available in full on The Wall Street Journal Web site. The July 2005 report
was released August 5, 2005, just a few days after the Fed started to set
the stage for a more aggressive stance toward higher interest rates and
just before the housing stocks began to show signs of weakness. The list
of industry sectors that the July ISM report said were growing included
“Instruments & Photographic Equipment; Food; Wood & Wood Products;
Electronic Components & Equipment; Leather; Miscellaneous*; Industrial
& Commercial Equipment & Computers; Transportation & Equipment;
Furniture; Chemicals; Fabricated Metals; and Textiles.”
267
Chapter 14: Getting Metallic without Getting Heavy

The sectors that the July ISM said were decreasing in activity included
“Printing & Publishing; Glass, Stone & Aggregate; Primary Metals;
Apparel; Rubber & Plastic Products; and Paper.”
A quick glance at these sectors shows these factors:
• Several housing-related sectors were growing, especially the fabri-
cated metals, such as steel and textiles and wood, which are used
in furniture. Indeed, furniture also was growing. The overall picture
for housing, however, was mixed.
• Primary metals, copper included, were one of the weak sectors.
At a point in the copper market like the one described in the list above, you
want to be careful, watch the charts, and wait for the next month’s report to
confirm your suspicions that the trend may slow.
Getting a handle on the Fed
You must maintain a continued awareness of when the Fed’s board of gover-
nors and open market committee are meeting.
Nothing happens to interest rates without the Fed getting into the game. 
So you have to keep an eye on the central bank to watch for clues about
whether the Fed is happy with current rates. Remember, the Fed, by design,
is paranoid about inflation, and the central banks, as members of the Fed, 
can control gold prices, thus making the markets wonder about inflation.
However, the Fed and the central banks can’t sweep rising housing and 
commodity prices under the rug, so they have to do something about it.
In early 2005, the Fed was getting annoyed with the housing market. Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan had described regional bubbles in selected markets
and expressed mixed feelings about them. In July, Greenspan pointed to “signs
of froth in some local markets where home prices seem to have risen to unsus-
tainable levels.”
The Fed’s governors like to make speeches or leak key concepts to the press.
And that’s clearly what happened in 2005 just before the employment report
was to be released August 6, 2005.
On August 3, 2005 (a Wednesday), Greg Ip, a reporter for The Wall Street
Journal with a pretty good pipeline into the Fed, wrote: “As the Federal
Reserve prepares to raise short-term interest rates again next week, officials
there increasingly believe the bond market, which sets long-term rates, is
diluting their efforts to tighten credit and contain inflation.” And it got even
scarier: “Some policy makers worry that bond yields are being kept in check
by overly complacent investor sentiment, which could rapidly dissipate,
pushing up mortgage rates and shaking the housing market. Indeed, some
Fed officials see similarities between the attitudes of bond investors today
and of stock investors in the late 1990s.”
268
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

Pulling it together
After you determine the long-term trend and check for potential land mines,
such as the Fed clearly telling the markets that interest rates are going way
up and for a long time, you need to core down your technical analysis toward
the short term by doing the following:
 Use trend lines, moving averages, and oscillators (see Chapters 7 and 8)
to look for clear and precise entry points above key resistance when
going long and below critical support levels when going short.
 Always confirm your trades with at least two technical oscillators, such
as MACD and RSI, before diving in.
 Set sell stops or buy-to-cover stops, depending on the direction of 
your trade, by referring to moving averages or percentages as your
guidelines. 
Never lose more than 5 percent on any given trade, and you’ll stay in the
game.
269
Chapter 14: Getting Metallic without Getting Heavy
Getting beyond gold and copper
Other metals besides gold and copper trade in
the futures markets. After you master — or at
least become familiar with — the gold and
copper markets, you can try your hand at alu-
minum, zinc, nickel, lead, and tin.
Most of them are more thinly traded than gold
and copper, with the exception of aluminum,
which can be very liquid.
The major influences are similar to the eco-
nomic fundamentals for gold and copper: strikes
and wars, individual metal stocks released reg-
ularly by the exchanges, and inflation.

f you’re like I was before I began trading, the first image of futures trading
that comes to mind is something like pork bellies or orange juice. You prob-
ably start chuckling and start shaking your head, saying, “No way man . . . not
for me . . . no sir.”
Then there’s the Hollywood take on commodities traders, usually shown as
not too smart, greedy fellows, looking for an edge and a quick buck.
In the movie Trading Places, Eddie Murphy and Dan Akroyd turn the tables 
on two old scoundrels played by Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche, who were
gaming the orange-juice market with inside information before the release 
of the monthly data hit the wires.
Although the movie was entertaining, and the two old buggers got what they
deserved, it unfortunately painted a lopsided picture of the futures market.
To be sure, some traders in the futures markets probably would seriously
consider trading on insider information, but given the tight surveillance of
the markets, and the potential for being caught, finding out just how the mar-
kets work and whether you’re cut out to trade probably is the best route for
you to take.

Trading, after all, is a serious business, and the meat markets are basically
about how much you and I have to pay to eat. If you look at it from that
standpoint, you start taking it a bit more seriously.
Meat markets are as much about farmers, producers, and other industry-
related traders using the markets to hedge their bets against potentially nega-
tive outside influences — weather, herds that catch plagues, and even fad
diets like the low-carb craze that took hold in the last decade — as they are
about people like you and me who look at charts and real-time quotes and try
to make money by trading meat.
This chapter is meant to provide a good overview of basic trading strategies.

kets and becoming familiar with the action that takes place in these markets
before you decide whether you want to trade in them.
Exploring Meat-Market Supply and
Demand, Cycles, and Seasonality
Like all commodities markets, meat markets are based on supply. More than
with other commodities markets where supply is key, in the meat markets, a
more equitable relationship exists with demand. The two major temporal fac-
tors to understand about the meat markets are the longer meat cycle, which
is different for cattle than it is for hogs, and the more reliable — although not
perfect by any means — aspect of seasonality.
The meat market goes through several phases where herds are built up and
subsequently sold. When farmers increase the number of cattle in their
herds, it’s called the accumulation phase, and when they thin the herd for sell-
ing, it’s called the liquidation phase. For hogs, the spectrum starts with expan-
sion and ends with contraction.
272
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

The time that passes from accumulation to liquidation and from expansion to
contraction is called the livestock cycle. In the past, the cycle for cattle usu-
ally lasted 10 to 12 years, and for hogs, it usually was around four years. The
actual length of the cycle is measured either from one trough, or the low point
in inventory, to the next, or from one peak, or high point in inventory, until
the next. The time that it takes for female swine to reach breeding age has a
direct effect on the hog expansion phase.
Seasonality, on the other hand, can be short term or have more of an interme-
diate duration. During summer months, the demand for certain cuts of beef
that can be grilled outside tends to increase. The same is true for the demand
for turkeys at Thanksgiving time. When consumers are flocking to one kind 
of meat at specific times, prices can be affected, and the market reacts and
adjusts. For example, some specific times that affect specific meat markets
include
 January through March: These three months tend to be strong ones for
feeder livestock prices, because grain prices tend to be lower during the
same period. Feeder cattle are steers, castrated males, and heifers, or
females that have not calved. These animals weigh anywhere from 600 to
800 pounds when they arrive at the feedlot, with a goal of reaching 1,000
to 1,300 pounds before they’re slaughtered.
 April through August: The spring and summer usually are weak months
for feeder prices.
 September through December: These four months are a second season
of strength in feeder prices; however, the January through March period
historically has been the stronger of the two periods.
Feeder cattle and oat prices sometimes move before live cattle prices. So reli-
able is this tendency that some traders actually describe this relationship as
“Feeders are the leaders.”
Understanding Your Steak
Here’s a quick-and-dirty overview of the cattle business to get you rolling in
the right direction.
Despite increasingly frequent scares about mad cow disease, the steak that
everyone loves to eat starts off with a cow/calf operation, which in short is a
cattle-breeding business that consists of a plot of land that holds a few bulls,
some kind of feed, and an average of at least 42 cows, according to govern-
ment statistics provided by the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA). The cow/calf operations are where natural or artificial insemination
takes its course and calves are born.
273
Chapter 15: Getting to the Meat of the Markets: Livestock and More

The breeding process
Producers breed cattle in the late summer or early fall, because nine months
are required to birth a calf. Most of the cattle production in the United 
States takes place in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa,
Minnesota, and Montana. Many of these areas of the country endure tough
winters, so birthing calves in spring gives them a better chance for survival.
Calves spend six months or so with their mothers and then are either released
into the feedlot or undergo backgrounding, a period where smaller animals
catch up in size and weight, essentially a process by which they are fed until
they grow to 600 to 800 pounds, which is considered large enough to enter the
feedlot and become feeder cattle.
Feedlots are where calves, again steers and heifers, are fattened up to become
the beef that humans consume. Cattle hotels are commercial feedlots that
account for only about 5 percent of all lots that are involved in raising feeder
cattle, but they produce 80 percent of the cattle sold. Feedlots sometimes
buy cattle for their clientele or will charge farmers a fee to custom feed their
stock.
Commercial operations offer farmers convenient services, such as boarding
and feeding cattle, and often serve as middlemen by setting up deals between
farmers and slaughterhouses. In other words, commercial operations fatten
up herds and use their industry contacts with packing plants to sell their
client/farmer’s herds. Sometimes commercial operations combine smaller
herds from several farms into one feedlot and then sell them to the 
slaughterhouses.
Feeder cattle are fed a high-energy diet consisting of grain, protein supple-
ments, and roughage. Putting on weight fast is the idea. The grain portion
these cattle are fed usually is made up of corn, milo, or wheat if the price is
low enough. Usually, the protein supplement includes soybeans, cottonseed,
or linseed meal. The roughage usually is alfalfa hay or even sugar beet pulp,
depending on market prices.
The packing plant
When feedlot animals reach specific weights, they are sold to the packing
plant. The packing plant is where live cattle and hogs are sent to be slaugh-
tered. Packers sell the meat and by-products, including the hides, bones, and
glands, to different customers, including retailers, such as grocery stores and
manufacturers of clothing and furniture.
274
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

The feeder cattle contract
Feeder cattle contracts are made up of feeder cattle, the precursor to live
cattle, and are the province of the feedlot operator. See the section about
“Understanding Your Steak,” earlier in the chapter, for details about feeder
cattle, and the next section for details on live cattle.
The prices of feeder cattle contracts are dependent on two major raw materi-
als, the number of animals on the feedlot and the price of grain.
Feedlot operators increase the number of animals based on the demand for
feeder cattle, which is dependent on the demand for live cattle. Corn and
other grain prices influence the costs of maintaining an animal on the feedlot.
Cheap grain prices usually correlate well with higher feeder cattle prices
when you trade this contract. Low supplies of grain stocks, on the other
hand, usually lead to weak feeder prices. Here are some of the specifics of
feeder cattle contracts:
 Composition: This contract holds 50,000 pounds of feeder cattle, with
specifications calling for a 750-pound steer, such that each contract
holds an average of 60 animals.
 Valuation: Prices are quoted in either cents per pound or dollars per
hundredweight.
 Settlement: Delivery is cash settled and is based on an index, with the
final price being the price of the index on the contract’s last day.
 Price limits: The price limit is equal to the live contract limit, which is
300 points or 3 cents per pound, or $3 per hundredweight, above or
below the closing price for the previous day.
The CME live cattle contract
The main difference between the live cattle contract and the feeder cattle
contract is that the animals in the live cattle contract are ready for slaughter.
Buyers of live cattle usually are meat packers who sell the meat and by-
products. In general, prices for live cattle tend to rise from January to March,
start falling in April, bottom out in July, and then remain below average until
October, according to monthly averages on the CME from 1992 through 2003.
This shifting of prices results from the pattern of cattle slaughter. According
to USDA data from 1992 through 2003, the number of cattle slaughtered peaks
during the period from June through August, making a second but lower peak
in October, and then declining into February, when the cycle starts rising
again until the June/August top.
275
Chapter 15: Getting to the Meat of the Markets: Livestock and More

Live cattle contracts are much like feeder cattle contracts, with the same
daily limits (300 points, 3 cents per pound, or $3 per hundredweight) above
or below the previous day’s close, but each contract consists of 40,000
pounds of slaughter-ready animals.
Beef prices are susceptible to mad cow disease and other health-related 
stories — such as being linked to cancer and heart disease — that occasionally
appear in the press. These stories can remain in the headlines for several
days or weeks. During those periods, avoiding the beef market is best.
Understanding Your Pork Chop
The hog market is similar in many ways to the cattle market, but it has some
important distinctions:
 Pork demand rises in spring because of Easter and in winter because of
the holiday season.
 Hog prices tend to rise in January and peak in May and June, rolling over
in July and falling into fall and the holiday season.
 During the period of rising hog prices, the number of slaughters
decreases.
Living a hog’s life
Similar to cattle, hogs being raised for the market go through significant
stages that traders need to track. The two basic stages are preslaughter and
postslaughter. The preslaughter stage is known as the farrow-to-finish opera-
tion, which means basically the entire process from breeding and rearing a
hog to slaughter, because the hog stays on the same farm from birth to finish.
When hogs reach 220 to 240 pounds in a period of about six months, they’re
sent to market.
Different from beef, a significant amount of pork is processed into smoked,
canned, or frozen ham.
Pork bellies
As a frustrated baseball announcer, I love a good slice of bacon, so I thought
I’d do the next best thing by shouting out the title of this section as if it were
Sammy Sosa striding up to the plate.
276
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

Pork bellies, though, are not a laughing matter. Indeed, they are the part of
the hog from which bacon is derived. Hogs are cash settled, based on a
USDA-calculated index.
Here are the basics of what you need to know about pork-belly contracts:
 Contracts: Pork-belly contracts are traded in lots of 50,000 pounds, com-
pared with 40,000 pounds for the live-hog contract.
 Valuation: When trading hogs and pork bellies, a 1-cent move in hogs is
worth plus or minus $400 per contract, while a 1-cent move in pork bel-
lies is worth $500 per contract.
 Market makeup: Speculators make up 85 percent of the trading volume
in pork bellies.
Pork bellies are among the most treacherous of futures contracts. The combi-
nation of a big move with just a penny’s movement in the price and the
volatile nature of the contract in general make the pork-belly contract one
that you need to be extremely careful about when you trade it.
Matching Technicals with Fundamentals
If you’re a livestock producer, you have to be thinking about hedging tech-
niques, because you have real cattle that you must deliver to the market at
some point. Thus, futures markets offer you a great opportunity to reduce
your risk, and fundamentals combined with technical analysis can help you
set up your hedging trades.
Figure 15-1 shows a fairly classic six-month chart for feeder cattle prices.
Note how prices rallied in the early part of the year and started to roll over
during the summer months.
As a speculator, you want to understand the market from a hedger’s point of
view, but you need to focus on these keys to the cattle market:
 Understanding the seasonal cycle: Livestock prices tend to be cyclical
in nature, but more important, you want to confirm that the cycle is
working the way it usually does. In the case of the chart in Figure 15-1,
you’d be correct in playing the long side of the market during the early
part of the year.
 Using technical analysis: You’re not out on the farm, so you must trust
the price action. Trend lines, moving averages, and oscillators are useful
in trending markets, such as the one shown in Figure 15-1. See Chapter 7
for a full overview of technical analysis.
277
Chapter 15: Getting to the Meat of the Markets: Livestock and More

 Keeping your strategies fluid: As with other contracts, you need to keep
up with government reports that are scheduled for release and hedge
your regular positions by buying options or by selling futures contracts
if you’re long.
 Following your trading rules: If you set a sell stop or a buy-to-cover
stop on a short position, don’t change it other than to keep ratcheting it
up or down as your position becomes more profitable. And when your
rules say the time is right, don’t hesitate to take those profits.
If you get stopped out, you either saved yourself a lot of trouble or
didn’t give yourself enough room. That dilemma is easily remedied. Go
back and check the usual price range of the commodity for the specific
time frame in which you’re trading. If you’re trading 15-minute bars and
the commodity tends to move one to two ticks during that period, then
set your stop just outside of or close to the normal movement. That way,
if you get stopped out, it was because of an abnormal movement by the
market against your position, and you’ve likely saved yourself from an
even bigger loss.
Watching for Big Reports
As with virtually all other commodities markets, given their connection to
supply and demand, meat-market traders need to keep an eye on their own
distinct set of key reports. The CME and your broker have calendars that
warn you when these key reports are going to be released. You need to take
seriously the reports I describe in the sections that follow, because they’re

the most important inside influence on prices. Many times, the information in
one of them is enough to change the overall trend of the particular market for
extended periods.
Of course, some reports are more important than others, but you’re asking
for trouble if you either have an open position or you’re trying to set one up
without knowing what to expect when one of these potential bombshells hits
the street.
Counting the cattle-on-feed reports
Released every month by the USDA’s National Agricultural Statistics Service
(NASS), the cattle-on-feed report usually moves the market and is made up of
these three parts:
 Cattle on feed: This part of the report focuses on the actual number of
cattle in the feedlots.
 Placements: This part of the report focuses on the number of new ani-
mals placed into feedlots during the previous month. This number is an
important predictor of future supply, because an animal placed in a feed-
lot can be market ready in 120 to 160 days.
 Marketings: This part of the report focuses on the number of animals
taken out of the feedlots. This number is a hazier piece of data because
it can be affected by an individual operator’s feeding methods and par-
ticular animal-specific idiosyncrasies.
For example, depending on demand and how well a particular animal
grows, feedlot operators can vary their marketings from month to
month.
Playing “This Little Piggy”: 
The Hogs and Pigs Report
The Hogs and Pigs Survey, which is released quarterly by NASS, reports pig
crop data from 16 major hog-producing states and is the most important
report for the hog and pork-belly markets. Information in it can lead to limit
moves that can last for several days whenever surprises are reported.
This report definitely is a market mover, but it can be wrong . . . although you
won’t be able to verify whether it’s right or wrong for six months or so.
279
Chapter 15: Getting to the Meat of the Markets: Livestock and More

Here are the nuts and bolts of the Hogs and Pigs Survey:
 Total numbers of pigs: This figure is the pig crop, and it shows where
the market volume is at the time the report is released.
 Breeding herd numbers: This figure tells you the total number of hogs
not sent to slaughter that are to be kept for breeding purposes.
 Farrowing intentions: This number provides an indication of breeding
levels expected in the future.
 Market hogs: This number is the portion of the report that gives you the
number of hogs that are being taken to market.
Other meat-market reports to watch
If you want your research to be complete, take note of these reports:
 Cattle Inventory Report: This report is released in January and July and
provides the numbers of mature animals and the numbers of calves in
the annual crop.
 Cold Storage Report: This report is a monthly release that tells you how
much meat is stored in the freezers, including beef, chicken, and pork. It
usually moves the pork-belly markets more than anything else.
 Out of Town Report: This report is released after the markets close
every Tuesday and, like the Cold Storage Report, is aimed mostly at pork-
belly traders. It measures whether pork bellies were put into freezers or
taken out of storage. Rising numbers of bellies going into freezers is bear-
ish. Falling numbers of bellies in storage is bullish.
 Daily Slaughter Levels: This report measures the daily activity of meat
packers.
Understanding the Effects of Key Reports
Reports in March and June 2005 affected the ebb and flow of the August 2005
pork-belly contract by starting a recovery in the market’s recovery and point-
ing to two trading opportunities you can use to catch this kind of market
bottom.
Figure 15-2 shows the pork-belly contract for August 2005 and how it broke
above the first trend line and marked a trading bottom and how a second
trend line marked a break in the downtrend. The first break in the market
280
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

occurred soon after the release of the March Cold Storage Report from the
USDA, usda.mannlib.cornell.edu/reports/nassr/other/pcs-bb/
2005/, which contained the following line:
“Total red meat supplies in freezers were down 1 percent from last
month, but up 4 percent from last year. Frozen pork supplies were up 9
percent from last month and up 14 percent from the previous year. Stocks
of pork bellies were up 19 percent from last month and up 32 percent
from last year.”
This reported glut of pork was not worked off until June when the govern-
ment’s Cold Storage Report indicated:
“Frozen pork supplies were down 9 percent from May, but up 24 percent
from the previous year. Stocks of pork bellies were down 9 percent from
last month, but up 97 percent from last year.”
By July:
“Frozen pork supplies were down 4 percent from last month, but up 32
percent from the previous year. Stocks of pork bellies were down 14 per-
cent from last month, but up 90 percent from last year.”
That was three months of sequential decreases in the amount of pork in stor-
age, which was good enough for the market to make a bottom. The chart in
Figure 15-2 clearly shows how a series of reports can influence the sensible,
supply-and-demand driven pork-belly market.

Notice the following key technical developments on the charts in Figure 15-2:
 Open interest (line on bottom of chart above volume bars) rose as sell-
ing accelerated, which is a bearish sign because it shows more people
are selling.
 Open interest declined as the pork-belly contract started to bottom,
which is bullish because it shows selling is losing strength.
Outside Influences that 
Affect Meat Prices
This section presents an important set of background factors that can affect
meat prices. Some are short-term influences, but others have been in the
pipeline for some time and can suddenly be felt when a certain catalyst hits
the news, such as an article that shows that beef is not as healthy for con-
sumption as it was thought to be.
Some longer-term and softer influences on meat prices are
 Population changes: If a demographic shift occurs in which more chil-
dren are born, more baby food will be sold, which tends to be more veg-
etable based.
 Income changes: The overall economy affects the kinds of food people
buy and whether they will go out to a restaurant and order higher-priced
items, such as steaks.
 Prices of substitutes: Higher beef and pork prices are likely to lead to
increased use of chicken, that is until the price of chicken gets too high
and the potential for a shift back to pork and beef increases.
 Prices of complements: With a sudden increase in the price of barbecue
sauce, you can see a decreased demand for beef or pork.
 Changing consumer tastes: This anomaly can be described as the clas-
sic Atkins diet effect. Pork, beef, and chicken prices rose when the low-
carb craze swept the United States. If a soybean-based diet was to catch
on in the same way, you’d likely see a similar phenomenon.
Some shorter-term but more constant influences on meat prices are
 Weather: A tough winter can lead to big animal losses, which, in turn,
can affect supply for extended periods of time. Cold winters also tend to
282
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

make animals eat more but gain less weight. So even if no animal deaths
occur, the time to market can be delayed because producers need more
time to fatten up animals, in effect delaying their time to market. What
then can result is a glut in the market at a later time, lowering prices
after the initial rise caused by the short-term shortage.
 Grain prices: Generally speaking, high feed prices result in liquidation,
and low feed prices result in accumulation. The liquidation/accumula-
tion ratio also is affected by the kind of prices producers get for their fin-
ished products. If meat prices are high, then producers can spend more
money on feed and pass along the added price.
A forced liquidation, a period where large numbers of animals are sent to
market because of droughts or periods of high feed prices, can lead to a
longer-term boom in prices. For example, in 1996, all-time high prices in corn
led to forced liquidation of both corn stores and herds. Cattle prices fell, only
to rebound strongly after the excess supply was taken off the market.

The Bumpy Truth about
Agricultural Markets
In This Chapter
 Steering clear of bad trades
 Cycling through seasonal crop fluctuations
 Keeping track of grains and beans
 Understanding other commodity softs
A
griculture is less popular in modern futures markets than it was in 
years past. During the first 70 years of futures trading, agriculture was
dominant, given its Japanese origin in the rice markets. On the other hand, if
weather patterns continue to change in volatility and intensity, and fossil-fuel
prices remain above historical price ranges, interest in grain markets is likely
to increase among traders.
For entry-level futures traders, the most important agricultural contracts 
are the corn and soybean contracts. They are the most actively traded and
quoted agriculture contracts, so I devote much of this chapter to explaining
corn and soybean contracts with regard to the grain and seed complexes.
After you gain a basic understanding of the concepts of seasonality and crop
cycles and how external factors influence them, adapting to other contracts
becomes relatively easy. In addition to the two major grain contracts, I also
briefly touch on coffee, sugar, and lumbers futures in this chapter.
Staying Out of Trouble Down on the Farm
From a real-world economic standpoint, futures contracts in the agricultural
markets are important; however, they are not for the fainthearted because of
their volatility, the thinness of trading that sometimes accompanies them,
and the dependence of prices on the influence of the weather.

Indeed, trading grains and softs can be very challenging, especially during
periods of volatile weather, which if recent history is any guide will become a
rule more than an exception, especially during hurricane season. Softs, by the
way, is the name given to a group of commodities that includes cocoa, sugar,
cotton, orange juice, and lumber. Here are some characteristics of trading
grains and softs that you need to know to stay out of the doghouse and the
poorhouse:
 Thinly traded contracts: Grain contracts and softs are not traded as
much as stock-index or financial contracts, which leaves traders open to
the effects of decreased liquidity, or the availability of money in the mar-
kets. Decreased liquidity, in turn, can lead to wide price swings in short
periods of time, which make trading difficult. See Chapters 7 and 8 for
information on technical analysis and details on trading gaps.
 Low liquidity: A lack of cash in these markets can lead to lots of chart
gaps and limit moves.
Before you trade any agricultural futures, you need a refined understanding
of the fundamentals of the particular sector and market in which you’re trad-
ing. For example, at the very least, you need to know about growing and har-
vesting seasons, geopolitical risks in the growing area, and how the weather
affects the crop. In other words, these contracts are better left for serious
and experienced traders, because they’re more adept at collecting informa-
tion, putting it in the proper context, and managing risk. I’m not saying that
you shouldn’t trade these markets. I’m just saying that they are not the best
ones to start with. As you gain more experience with the general aspects of
futures trading, you’ll be able to do more in these areas.
Corn, soybeans, and other agricultural futures are excellent contracts to
allow someone else to trade for you, either through a commodity fund that
specializes in these markets or a good advisor with a good record who knows
what he or she is doing.
Agriculture 101: Getting a 
Handle on the Crop Year
You need to know what the crop year is to be able to understand grain trad-
ing. The crop year is the time from one crop to the next. It starts with planting
and ends with harvesting. During that time, crops are going through what the
United States Department of Agriculture and Joint Agricultural Weather facil-
ity call the moisture- and temperature-dependent stages of development.
What happens between planting and harvest tends to affect the prices of the
crops the most. For example, the weather is a major factor. Drought, flooding,
and freezing are the major events. Other external events, such as shipping
286
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

problems, can also affect delivery at key times, such as when Hurricane
Katrina hit the port of New Orleans, from which much of the Midwestern
grain makes its way out of the U.S.
Think of the supply of grain brought to market as a rationed situation. By that
I mean that although grains are used year round, most of them are replen-
ished only one time during the year. As a result, prices are affected by a com-
bination of current supplies and future supply expectations. The way a grain
market perceives future and current supplies and the way that traders pre-
dict the effect of internal and external factors on prices is a major set of vari-
ables to consider. In other words, in all markets there is a certain fudge
factor, or an intangible influence on prices.
Think of it along these terms. In futures markets, as in all markets, perception
is as much a part of pricing as reality. The markets are efficient, and that
means they react to the information that they have available instantaneously,
which leads to short-term price volatility. As with the hog and pig report I dis-
cuss in Chapter 15, data in a single quarterly report may be significantly off
the mark as slaughter approaches, and thus the reality in any market, grains
and softs included, can be different than the original report indicates. So you
need to know that markets can retrace major moves as better information
becomes available.
As with most other commodities, trading in corn and soybeans is all about
supply.
Except during times of extraordinary circumstances, such as dietary fads or
major external, political, climactic, or geological events, demand stays within
a fairly predictable range.
If under normal circumstances, demand fluctuates within certain bands
based on the number of people and animals to be fed at any given time, the
market focuses on anything that affects how much grain will be available to
feed them from year to year.
That’s doesn’t mean that demand isn’t important. For example, just for the
sake of illustration, the markets are used to a certain amount of demand for
soybeans from China every year; however, if China’s weather changes dra-
matically and its domestic crop suffers, global demand for soybeans will
increase, thus having a direct effect on the markets.
Assuming that U.S. supply remains stable in a year that China’s weather
changes, you’re likely to have an increase in prices caused by the increased
demand.
Likewise, if the supply of soybeans is decreased because of a crop plague in
the U.S. — which supplies most of the world’s soybeans — and global
demand remains the same, prices are likely to rise.
287
Chapter 16: The Bumpy Truth about Agricultural Markets

The situation is similar in virtually all markets; changes in supply tend to
affect prices more strongly than changes in demand. See Chapter 13 for more
details about how supply rules the markets.
In general, high levels of current supplies and/or expectations of high supply
levels in the future usually lead to lower prices. Conversely, low levels of cur-
rent supplies and/or expectations of future shortages usually lead to higher
prices.
Weathering the highs and lows of weather
Weather plays the main influence on crops, and significant weather develop-
ments affect crop markets. Globally, weather is important in grain and seed
markets. Some basic points to keep in mind about the weather include
 Spring weather in the United States (or anywhere for that matter) affects
planting season. Too much rain can delay planting.
 Summer weather affects crop development. Crops need rain to develop
appropriately. Droughts play havoc with crop development.
 During the North American winter, agricultural market watchers and
traders concentrate on the weather in South America, because it’s
summer there. Likewise, dormant winter wheat in North America needs
enough snowfall to protect the crop from winterkill, or freezing, because
not enough snow is on the ground to insulate the crop.
 A wet harvest can cause delays and decrease crop yields.
These factors all can raise prices.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bulletin, www.usda.
gov/oce/waob/jawf/wwcb.html, is an excellent resource for information
about weather trends and potential developments. You can subscribe to the
report for $60 per year. The USDA releases it on Wednesdays. It may not be
worthwhile subscribing to these reports unless you’re a farmer who’s looking
into the small details. As a trader, especially one using charts, you’ll be react-
ing to the market’s response anyway.
Weather markets, or periods when crops are being affected by droughts,
floods, or freezing temperatures, create possibly the most volatile types of
markets, and they’re risky to boot. Droughts or unusual snowfall or rainfall
patterns are among the more common events that trigger weather markets.

Looking for Goldilocks: The key 
stages of grain development
Prices for grain and soybean futures can move significantly during three key
time frames when seasonal and logistical expectations are the result of the
cultivation and growing cycles. At these three times of year, weather condi-
tions can’t be too hot, too cold, or certainly not too wet. Like Goldilocks and
her porridge, conditions have to be “just right” during
 Planting season: When it’s time to plant, rainfall is the major influence.
Too much rain means a late planting season that can lead to smaller,
lower-quality crops, which in turn, can lead to higher prices. A wet plant-
ing season offers traders an opportunity to trade on the long side.
 Pollination or growing season: Rain and heat are the keys when seeds
are pollinating and growing. Too much heat and too little rain lead to
lower levels of pollination, which again can lead to smaller crops. Cold
temperatures and too much water can have the same effect.
 Maturation and harvest season: When plants are maturing and harvest
is near, too much heat and too much rain can mean poor crops from dif-
ficult field conditions and the spread of fungus among crops.
Cataloging Grains and Beans
The grain complex has multiple components, including soybeans, soybean
meal, soybean oil, Canola, palm oil, corn, oats, and wheat. I concentrate on
the soybean and corn markets, because they are the most heavily traded
markets and offer the best opportunity for small accounts and beginning
traders. However, you can apply what you find out about these grains and
how these markets work to develop an understanding of other grain markets
and to set up strategies.
One caveat is that individual markets have their own subtle sets of parame-
ters, and you’ll have to figure them out as you expand your trading horizons.
The soybean complex
The soybean complex is made up of three separate futures contracts for deliv-
ery of soybeans, soybean meal, and soybean oil. Soybeans are legumes, not
grains, but they’re traded and cataloged as part of the grain complex. Don’t
let this weird stuff confuse you. Markets and traders are efficient, and they
look for convenience. Besides, can you imagine somebody on TV talking
about legume futures? Egads!
289
Chapter 16: The Bumpy Truth about Agricultural Markets

Until 2004, the United States was the largest soybean producer with about a
50 percent market share. Until 1980, the U.S. held an 80-percent share, but the
Carter administration’s grain embargo, a political maneuver in 1980 that was
designed to protest the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, cost the U.S. farming
industry dearly.
Currently, South America produces most of the other half of the world’s soy-
beans, with China picking up the rest.
Soybeans are the protein source used most by humans and animals around
the world. The primary uses of soybeans are for meal for animal feed and oil
for human consumption.
Soybean contracts
The soybean contract trades on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Here are
the particulars of a soybean contract:
 Contract: A contract is 5,000 bushels, and prices for soybeans are
quoted in dollars and cents per bushel.
 Valuation: A 1-cent move in the price of soybeans is worth $50 per con-
tract, with daily price movements shifting as much as 50 cents per day.
 Limits: Trading limits in soybeans are variable based on prevailing
market conditions.
 Margins: As of July 2005, the initial speculative margin requirement was
$2,295 per contract, and the maintenance margin requirement was
$1,700 per contract.
Soybean meal contracts
Soybean meal (what’s left after the extraction of oil from soybeans) can be
fed to cattle, hogs, and poultry. A 60-pound bushel of soybeans yields 48
pounds of meal. Forty percent of U.S. meal production is exported. The rest is
used domestically. Here are the particulars of the soybean meal contract:
 Contract: A soybean meal contract is 100 short tons (200,000 pounds),
with a (short) ton equal to 2,000 pounds. Prices are quoted in dollars
and cents per ton.
 Valuation: A $1 move in the per-ton price of soybean meal is worth $100
per contract.
 Limits: Price movements are limited to $20 per day, which is also vari-
able, again depending on market conditions. If the market closes at the
limit, the limit is raised for the three subsequent days to accommodate
traders. Although this tactic may seem a bit strange, remember that the
role of the futures markets, especially in key commodities such as
290
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

grains, is to enable commerce to take place — capitalism at its finest. If
market conditions are such that limits need to be expanded, the
exchanges are more than happy to accommodate the markets.
 Margins: As of July 2005, the initial margin requirement was $1,485, and
the maintenance margin was $1,100.
Soybean oil contracts
Soybean oil is the third major soybean product for which futures contracts
are bought and sold. A bushel of soybeans produces 11 pounds of oil, and
soybean oil competes with olive oil and other edible oils. Soybean oil is
extracted by a multistep process that involves steaming, pressing, and perco-
lating (similar to brewing coffee) the beans. If you’re really into how soybean
oil is extracted, plenty of background info can be found on the Internet. Have
at it! Here are the basics of what you need to know:
 Contract: A soybean oil contract is 60,000 pounds. Prices are quoted in
cents per pounds.
 Valuation: Be careful trading soybean oil. A 1-cent move is equal to 100
points, which is worth $600 per contract.
 Limits: Trading limits are set at 1 cent, but they can be adjusted,
because soybean trading can be very volatile because of the weather
and other external factors. Thus, trading limits are variable, meaning
that they can be changed if prices continue to be very volatile over a
period of time. See Chapter 3 for more about trading limits.
 Margins: As of July 2005, the initial margin requirement was $1,080, and
the maintenance margin requirement was $800.
Getting corny
Corn is the most active commodity among grain contracts, and it is the major
crop grown in the U.S. American farmers grow about 50 percent of the world’s
corn supply, and 70 percent of U.S. production is consumed domestically.
Corn futures are known as feed corn, or corn that’s fed to livestock — not the
same stuff that you and I eat at summer picnics or find behind the Jolly Green
Giant label. Here are the particulars of corn futures:
 Contract: A contract holds 5,000 bushels, and a 1⁄4-cent move is worth
$12.50 per contract. Prices are quoted in cents and 1⁄4 cents.
 Limits: The daily limit is 20 cents, or $1,000. There are no limits in the
spot month.
 Margins: As of July 2005, the initial margin requirement for speculators
was $675 per contract, and the maintenance margin requirement was
$500 per contract.
291
Chapter 16: The Bumpy Truth about Agricultural Markets

The CBOT’s Web site (www.cbot.com) can provide you with a great deal of
useful background information, charts, and even trade summaries. I highly
recommend a good review of the data there.
Culling Some Good Fundamental Data
Although charts are the most useful tools for trading futures, getting a grip
on the fundamental expectations of price movements in the particular con-
tract you’re trading is important. The fundamentals, of course, are back-
ground information, and you need to be aware that even the best guesses can
be wrong. The key is to gauge what the expectations are for the market and
then find out what prices actually do.
Getting a handle on the reports
You can find plenty of good fundamental information at the USDA’s Web site
at www.usda.gov. Here is a good sequence of data and market factors to
keep in mind for getting a handle on a market’s supply and demand:
 Beginning stocks: The beginning stock is the amount of grain that’s left
over from the previous year — as reported by the government.
 Production: Production is the estimated amount of a crop that will be
harvested during the current year.
 Weekly Weather and Crop Report: The USDA releases a weekly Crop
Progress Report that updates the crop and weather conditions. This
report usually is released on Wednesday. See the earlier section on
“Weathering the highs and lows of weather” for data included in this key
report.
 Import data: The U.S. is a grain exporter, so this data rarely is signifi-
cant. If that ever changes — permanently or temporarily — the markets
will let everyone know.
 Total supply: The total supply is the sum of beginning stocks, produc-
tion, and imports.
 Crush: (No, I’m not talking about your favorite orange or grape soda —
although a grape would taste great right about now.) Crush refers to the
amount of demand being exhibited by crushers, or businesses that buy
raw soybeans and make them into meal and oil.
 Exports: Two export reports are released each week; they are
• Export inspections — released on Monday after the market closes
• Export sales — released on Thursday before the market opens
292
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 Currency trends: Trends in the currency markets, especially those of
the dollar, can affect export reports.
 Seeds and residual: Usually 3 to 4 percent of the crop is held for seeding
the next year’s crop. Seeds are important because they’re the next
season’s planting stock. Residuals are the portions of soybean oil that
are not used in food-related processes. Soybean oil also is used as an
additive in pesticides and has biochemical uses, including medications.
It’s also used as grain spray to prevent dust from settling on stored
crops.
 Total demand: Total demand is the sum of exports, seeds, crush, and the
residual figure.
 Ending carryover stocks: Ending carryover stock is a big number that
tends to move the markets. It’s the total supply minus total demand.
Don’t forget the Deliverable 
Stocks of Grain report
The Deliverable Stocks of Grain report is an interesting report that merits its
own section, because every Tuesday the CBOT tallies the number of bushels
of corn, wheat, soybeans, and oats stored in elevators that are licensed to
deliver grains in relation to trades made on the CBOT.
This report is important, because the information contained in it is a good
way to determine whether enough grain is in storage for delivery. If not
enough grain is in storage, then the market experiences a short squeeze,
because traders with short positions don’t have any way to make good on
their deliveries, so they have to buy futures contracts to make good on their
bets. A short squeeze happens when large numbers of traders have open
short positions, or bets that the market will fall. If the market goes against
those short positions, traders have to buy contracts to prevent their losses
from getting worse. When large numbers of short positions must cover their
positions at the same time, the market rallies.
The Deliverable Stocks of Grain report is issued as a Microsoft Excel spread-
sheet and can be found on the CBOT Web site. The best way to use it is to
keep track of deliverable stocks and watch how the data are trending over a
period of time. In fact, you can view several reports and then construct your
own chart on the figures so that the trend becomes visible. Otherwise, you
must rely on the market’s reaction to the release.
293
Chapter 16: The Bumpy Truth about Agricultural Markets

Gauging Spring Crop Risks
The risk premium is the influence of future expectations of supply on current
prices, and it’s the basis for price fluctuations in the futures markets.
As mentioned in the “Looking for Goldilocks: The key stages of grain develop-
ment” section, earlier in this chapter, crops are most vulnerable during plant-
ing, pollination, and harvesting. During these stages, the markets begin to
apply a risk premium to prices. This kind of pricing can be an emotional
rather than rational process, which is why prices can fluctuate wildly on
weather reports, fires, and reports of diseases and insect infestations in the
fields.
Corn and soybeans are planted in spring, so they tend to compete for
acreage, which makes the price relationship between the two important.
You need to realize that risk is around every corner during each stage of the
crop year. Any external news event, such as flooding, drought, crop plagues,
or unusual weather developments — late freezes or even the accidental intro-
duction of a foreign beetle that flourished as crops emerged — can shake the
markets.
A perfect example of crop risk and its effect on the markets was associated
with the rise of orange juice prices in October 2005. Aside from the damage
to Florida orange orchards from Hurricane Wilma, an increase was reported
in canker, a bacterial infection of citrus fruit trees that’s spread by wind. Any
citrus tree within 1,900 feet of an infected tree had to be cut down.
Planting risk premiums tend to be higher than pollination risk premiums,
because of the market’s fear that the crop won’t ever be planted. Pollination
risk tends to be less, because after the crop is planted, there’s a greater
chance that at least some of the crop will emerge and thus at least some 
of the crop will be pollinated. The third risk comes at harvest time, when
traders begin to fear that crops will wither in the field because of bad
weather or other events.
As the market begins pricing in risk premiums, futures contracts in corn and
soybeans tend to rise during the months of March and April because of the
following:
 Corn planting starts in late March and usually is completed by late May.
March and April tend to be months during which corn tends to rally.
 Corn pollinates in late June or early July. June can be a strong month for
corn.
 Soybeans usually are planted in mid-March through May. March and
April can be good rally months for soybeans.
294
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 Soybean pollination usually takes place in August. August beans can
experience a small rally.
 October and November are harvest months. Rallies during these months
usually are not very profitable, because harvest usually takes place, and
barring truly extraordinary circumstances, supply and demand find a
balance.
During the summer of 1973, the Russians made large purchases of grains.
Supply fear (the fear that planting, pollination, or harvest won’t be success-
ful) truly gripped the market, and the resulting rally was violent, but it didn’t
last long, because grain prices responded in the absence of major problems
with planting, pollination, or harvesting by falling back to their mainstream
trend lines, which is rather simple technical analysis.
During May and June, you need to tailor your trades toward going long in
corn and soybeans; however, after August, you need to be looking to go short
so you can capitalize on the normal trends of the market. The key word is
“looking,” because external factors like the weather can cause the market to
deviate from general seasonal tendencies.
The bumps, rallies, and valleys of the grain markets are only tendencies.
Before deciding to make a trade, be sure to
 Find out from your charts whether the market actually is following sea-
sonal patterns that have tended to happen in the past. In 2005, trading
was difficult in the corn market, but it was easier in soybeans because
the market tended to trend for longer periods.
 Look for evidence that confirms what prices are telling you. In the case
of corn in 2005, open interest started to rise in conjunction with prices,
which is as good a confirmation of a rising trend as there is. Rising open
interest means that more buyers are coming into the market. Compare
the open interest in soybeans with that of corn, and you can see that the
open interest rate for corn actually was flat. Corn contracts had no life in
them at that time.
Agriculture 102: Getting Soft
Coffee, sugar, orange juice, and cocoa are known as the softs. Some call them
the breakfast category of futures. They can deliver some profitable moves if
you take the time to become familiar with the standard stuff that goes on in
the softs markets.
In contrast to grains and beans, much of the action in softs goes on overseas
and often in remote regions of the world, especially in places that from time
to time are politically unstable. As a result, trading the softs can be more
volatile.
295
Chapter 16: The Bumpy Truth about Agricultural Markets

Having coffee at the exchange
Coffee trades in the U.S. and in London, with the U.S. trading the largest
amount and most active contract at the New York Board of Trade.
Coffee is all about supply, and the 2001 International Coffee Agreement (ICA),
a product of the International Coffee Organization, is meant to provide guide-
lines with regard to managing the global coffee supply and to encourage con-
sumption. Like all such agreements, the ICA isn’t foolproof. It can be
circumvented and thus can create controversy in the markets.
Coffee supplies can be affected by smuggling and by quantities of coffee that
are not a part of the quota system and arrangements agreed upon by the ICA.
Prices can fall whenever the market is hit with data or rumors suggesting that
smuggling is on the rise. For details of the 2001 ICA, visit the ICA’s Web site at
www.ico.org/2001_agreement.asp.
Coffee is produced in two classes, Arabica and Robusta, and thus two coffee
contracts are traded. These two classes of coffees can trend differently
during short periods of time, but they tend to trade along the same long-term
trend line.
Arabica
Arabica beans account for 60 percent of the world’s coffee supply. Arabica is
a cool-temperature, high-altitude crop. Brazil and Columbia combined pro-
duce a third of the world’s Arabica coffee. Costa Rica, Mexico, Guatemala,
Honduras, and El Salvador also are major producers of Arabica, and
Indonesia, Uganda, and Vietnam produce the rest.
Arabica is the more important of the two coffee classes when analyzing the
North American markets. Supply, as is usual with commodities, is the key.
Weather, blights, moves by big retailers, and political events in Africa, Asia,
Brazil, and South America, in general, can cause volatility in the coffee markets.
Robusta
Robusta is a less mild variety of coffee that comes from Africa and Asia.
Robusta trades in London and is most often used as instant coffee because 
of its stronger flavor.
Trading coffee
Coffee trading is centered on the New York Board of Trade (NYBOT, www.
nybot.com) for Arabica and the Euronext-LIFFE (www.euronext.com) for
Robusta. Euronext consolidated the futures markets in Belgium, France, The
Netherlands, and Portugal. LIFFE stands for London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange. Here are the particulars for coffee trading:
296
Part IV: Commodity Futures 

 Contract: The contract size for coffee in New York is 37,500 pounds of
Arabica, and it trades at the NYBOT. Robusta coffee futures trade at
Euronext-LIFFE. A Robusta contract contains five tons of coffee.
 Valuation: A 1-cent move is worth $375 per contract for Arabica. The
minimum tick is $1 per ton for Robusta.
 Limits: A 6-cent limit applies only in the back months for Arabica. No
limits are in place for the two front months, which makes this contract
extremely risky. Colombian coffee gets a 2-cent premium upon delivery.
No limits are in place for Robusta.
 Trading hours: The markets are open for trading Arabica in New York
from 9:15 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Trading hours for Robusta in London are
from 9:40 to 16:55 London time.
Staying sweet with sugar
Sugar is another breakfast commodity, and it’s another volatile commodity
that is best left for more experienced traders. As with all commodities, you
have to understand the basics of the industry, the key reports that move the
market, and how to apply technical analysis to trading. Unlike coffee, most
sugar-producing countries produce much of the sugar that they use and then
export the rest.
Cuba, India, Thailand, and Brazil are major sugar cane producers. Russia and
the European Union are the major sugar beet producers. Russia, China,
Europe, the U.S., China, and Japan are the biggest importers, and Cuba,
Australia, Thailand, and Brazil are the biggest exporters.
The two sugar contracts are
 #14, which has subsidy-supported sugar.
 #11, which has free-market sugar. The free-market sugar contract is the
one to trade. A contract is for 112,000 pounds, and a 1-cent move is
worth $1,120.
Sugar trades on the stock-to-usage ratio, which is the level of supplies com-
pared to demand. Sugar traders talk about tightness, which means the state
of the supply/demand scenario. A ratio of 20 to 30 percent is low and usually
leads to higher prices.
Traders also watch for candy sales and the price of corn, because of competi-
tion from high-fructose corn syrup, which competes with sugar as a commer-
cial sweetener.

Building a rapport with lumber
Lumber is another so-called soft. Why that is, I couldn’t tell you. Some traders
think that it’s lumped in with the rest of the softs because another place can’t
be found for it.
Lumber is used in homebuilding, and the price can be volatile. In some cases,
lumber prices peak or trough before housing busts or booms, respectively.
Several months can elapse before a glut or a major shortage finds its way
from the futures markets to the housing industry.
The lumber contract calls for 80,000 board feet (construction grade two-by-
fours) manufactured in the Pacific Northwest or Canada. Prices are quoted in
dollars and cents per board foot. A $1 movement in price equals $80 in the
contract. Lumber is another thinly traded contract that you can work your
way toward trading as you gain more experience.

I
n this chapter, I help you decide whether you or someone else will do your
trading, and I explain how you can go about setting up your trading infra-
structure.
Deciding just who will do your trading is as important a decision as you can
make, because your success or failure, or how fast you get there, can depend
on how you decide to make your trades.
Each side of the aisle has advantages and disadvantages, and much of decid-
ing whether to trade for yourself or have someone do it for you depends on
your personality, how much hand-holding you need, and what your expecta-
tions are.
If you decide to make your own trades, you must fully commit your time and
efforts to the enterprise. In a very real sense, you’re starting a new business,
and any casual notion you have that becoming a trader will be an easy, effort-
less road to riches is the way to disaster.
The decisions you make have a direct and usually quick bearing on how
much money you make or lose while trading.

Financing Your Habit
The most difficult question that you must answer about trading has to do
with where you’re going to get the money to trade futures.
A simple rule: If you have to borrow money, you shouldn’t trade futures or
anything else. Money for trading needs to be money that you can afford to
lose, period.
You may have to develop a savings plan over several years that will finance
your new endeavor. As a result, you may need to make changes in your
spending habits, such as missing a vacation, driving a more modest car, or
eating at less fancy restaurants.
Regardless of how you do it, the best way to trade futures is using your own
money. When it’s your money that you’re trading, you’re more likely to be
extremely careful about what you do with it.
Although most discount brokers enable you to open a self-managed futures
trading account for $5,000, most Certified Trading Advisors (CTAs) require a
minimum of $50,000, with the range usually being anywhere from $25,000 up
to several million dollars. See the next section for more details about choos-
ing a broker or CTA.
Deciding Who’s Going to Do the Trading
After you’ve made up your mind to trade futures, you need to decide who’s
going to do the actual trading. The choice is pretty simple; either you or
someone else will do it, but that also means you have to decide whether to
use an advisor, a broker, or a managed account.
Choosing has its subtleties. Keep in mind that when a broker is doing your
trading — depending on your agreement — he or she may have to call you
and ask your permission to trade on your behalf. That can delay your ability
to make short-term profits. Conversely, you may choose to give your broker
full trading authority and discretion to make trades for you. If you do, then
you have to abide by the results of the broker’s decisions, which means you
may face some conflict down the line if your broker is either unscrupulous or
not very talented.
A managed account is akin to a mutual fund. It is a pooled amount of money
that is managed by an individual or a group. Those managers don’t have to
ask for permission to trade your money, because they trade the entire pool
simultaneously, and shareholders make or lose money depending on the
results of the pool’s trades and the number of shares they respectively hold.
302
Part V: The Trading Plan 

The main advantage of letting someone else do the trading is that you can
spend time learning to trade while your account grows, assuming that you
find a good firm or broker to manage your account. The main disadvantage is
that you have little control of your money, and if you need control, you’ll
probably be miserable.
Here are your basic trading options:
 Manage the account yourself based on your own analysis.
 Manage the account yourself based on advice from newsletters, publica-
tions, or even a broker.
 Have a CTA manage the account.
 Buy an interest in a limited-partnership pool managed by a professional
CTA. Limited-partnership pools also are known as futures funds.
Other advantages of managed futures, either individual accounts or trading
pools, are as follows:
 Good CTAs have more experience than novice traders and therefore
have a better chance of making money.
 Trading pools have more money to invest than individuals and thus can
establish better positions in the market.
 Trading pools can pay lower commissions when they trade and thus
save you money on costs.
 Trading pools are structured as limited partnerships, entities that limit
your risk. They spread risk across all the partners, with the managing
partner or the manager/management firm assuming the largest part of
the risk. You’re liable only for losses or any required restitution for fraud
and so on, and your liability is limited to the percentage of the partner-
ship that you own. So if you own 2 percent of the shares, and the part-
nership goes belly up, you’d be at risk of losing only an amount
commensurate with what you put in.
Some managed futures funds guarantee the return of your initial investment,
if you remain with the fund for a set number of years. The disadvantages of
that option are that your return from these funds may be lower, and you usu-
ally must hold the fund until maturity, so your money’s tied up in the fund,
regardless of how well it’s doing.
The disadvantages of managed futures accounts are
 Higher fees, loss of control of your money, and the general illiquidity
associated with them.
 The fact that you have to part with (or give up control of) your money
for an extended period of time and be willing to weather some volatility
during that holding period.
303
Chapter 17: Trading with a Plan Today So You Can Do It Again Tomorrow

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) provides an excellent
summary of what a CTA is and how the commodities trading system func-
tions at www.cftc.gov/opa/backgrounder/opacpocta.htm. Managed
Accounts Reports (MAR), www.marhedge.com, is a good resource for infor-
mation about managed futures.
Choosing a CTA
A CTA is a professional money manager who must register with the CFTC and
undergo a rigorous FBI background check before being allowed to trade other
people’s money. A knowledgeable CTA can manage your futures trades.
You can find a CTA either through a broker or by subscribing to services such
as MAR, which can become expensive.
Reviewing the CTA’s track record
After you get a few names of potential CTAs, review their disclosure documents,
which by law have to present all their vital information and their track records.
Track records (also by law) have to be presented in a way that is easy enough
for you to understand, regardless of whether the advisor has made money. They
include comparisons with benchmarks such as the S&P 500 and the Lehman
Brothers Long-term Government Bond Index.
The track record also has to show
 How much money was being managed
 How much money per month came from trading
 How much came from new deposits or was lost to withdrawals from 
the fund
 Amounts of fees charged by the fund
 Amounts of fees paid by the fund
 Earnings from interest
 Net return on investment after all fees and trading were taken into
account
Be careful in how you look at the posted returns of CTA candidates. Here’s an
example: Suppose you have two advisors, X and Y, and advisor X’s three years
of returns are +10 percent, +40 percent, and –20 percent, while advisor Y’s
returns for the same three years are +15 percent, +10 percent, and +5 percent.
304
Part V: The Trading Plan 

At first glance, you’re probably inclined to think that X is the better of the two,
but if you do the math, you’ll see that if you gave them each $1,000, after three
years, X would have $1,232, while Y would have $1,328.
Other CTA characteristics to watch for
Use this checklist to make your best choice of CTAs. Above all, make sure
that you match the CTA to your risk tolerance.
 Check how long the CTA has been in business. The longer the advisor
has been in business, the better he is likely to be, because he’s a 
survivor.
 Find the CTA’s largest drawdown or the biggest loss he’s ever had. The
two important things to find out are how bad the loss was and how long
it took the CTA to get the money back after the loss.
 Evaluate the returns of prospective CTAs based on risk. The CTA who
has a lower return but took less risk may be a better choice, because he
or she is likely to provide more stable returns, and you may sleep better.
 Check out the stability of the business. Make sure that plenty of signs
point to the CTA having a stable business and a stable methodology.
Look for consistent but not necessarily high returns.
 Ask about risk management. Look for reasonable answers with regard
to money management and risk aversion.
 Look for conflicts of interest. Is the CTA getting paid by certain brokers
to use their services? Is that costing you money? What kind of fees is the
CTA collecting from other sources as fees and commissions?
Considering a trading manager
Another possible suggestion is employing a trading manager or a middleman
when you’re trying to choose a CTA. If you’re overwhelmed by the thought of
having to plow through hundreds of documents while screening your list of
potential CTAs, managed funds, and trading pools, a trading manager can act
as an investment counselor, serving as an independent resource who can 
sift through the jungle of paperwork to help you evaluate CTAs, funds, and
managers.
Trading managers collect a fee for doing your legwork, and they get a per-
centage of your profits, which turns out to be a good incentive for them to
find someone who is good for your money. Large investors usually employ
trading managers.
305
Chapter 17: Trading with a Plan Today So You Can Do It Again Tomorrow

Choosing a Broker
If you decide to trade for yourself, you need to choose between a full-service
and a discount broker. A full-service broker charges you a larger commission
but is expected to provide you with good advice about your trades. Some
also serve as middlemen between you and CTAs.
Be careful whenever you deal with brokers, CTAs, mutual funds, annuities,
and so on, because brokers and advisors sometimes earn large incentives for
steering you in certain directions, regardless of whether taking those direc-
tions with your money is in your best interest.
Look for full access to the following when you open an account:
 All markets: Even if you’re interested in only a handful of markets right
now, you may want to consider expanding your horizons in the future,
so choosing a broker who can give you all the choices under one roof 
is best.
 Research: Some brokers offer discounts to newsletters and Web sites,
while others offer direct access to their own research departments.
Some offer live broadcasts from the trading pits.
 The full gamut of technical tools: You really want an opportunity to get
as fancy with your trading as you want to in the future, including having
the ability to run multiple real-time charts with oscillators and indica-
tors and receive intermarket analysis.
 Intelligent software: Some brokers offer you access to software and
charting packages that enable you to back test, or review, the results of
your trading strategies and indicators.
 Forward testing your strategy: Nothing guarantees that you’ll match the
results predicted by the software, but being able to forward test your
trading strategies is a nice tool to have. Back testing shows you how
your trades would have worked based on historical data. Forward test-
ing is based on the probability of certain conditions occurring in the
future and is more related to how much money you’d make if certain
things happened; however, it’s a useful tool only in hypothetical settings.
Follow these suggestions when boiling down your choices between brokers:
 Test more than one trading platform. Most brokers will offer you a trial
of their software and trading platforms if you register on their Web sites.
 Make sure the broker offers a 24-hour customer-service line. This line
of communication is crucial if you decide to exit a position overnight in
306
Part V: The Trading Plan 

the face of events that are costing you money. If you have to wait until
the morning, your losses can be larger than you’d expect. The 24-hour
nature of futures trading is another reason to use stop-loss orders.
 Make sure that you have the choice of entering trades via either the
Internet or phone. If phone lines are busy and you have to make a trade,
you want access. If your Internet connection and your backup connec-
tion are down, you’d like to have phone access to either check your
positions or make trades.
 Check all potential trading fees before you sign up and make a trade.
Check all fees, including whether all the trading bells and whistles are
included in the commission or whether extra charges or conditions
must be met, such as a minimum number of trades to qualify for certain
services.
 Open an account with a well-known firm. Going with the established
broker can be a good idea, at least when you’re getting started. If you try
to save a few bucks with a smaller firm, you may be sorry later on, espe-
cially if you’re concerned about order execution, software glitches, and
hidden fees. Large firms are not exempt from fraud, but because of their
size, information about their practices is more readily available.
 Check for current trading scams: Look on the CFTC’s Web site
(www.cftc.gov) under the “Consumer Protection” heading for current
trading scams and for disciplinary actions taken against firms and bro-
kers. You’ll find important bulletins and helpful Web links to important
information about general rules and recent enforcement actions. On the
National Futures Association’s (NFA) Web site (www.nfa.futures.org/
basicnet), you can search for brokers, trading pools, and CTAs.
Falling in the pit of full service
Some of the same criteria that apply for choosing a CTA can be used for
choosing a full-service broker (see the earlier sections on “Reviewing the
CTA’s track record” and “Other CTA characteristics to watch for”). Especially
important is whether you’re dealing with an experienced broker, who earns
his or her keep.
With brokerage firms, many times you meet the lead guy once, but you never
see him again. You’re left dealing with underlings, and that can be just like
Russian roulette. If you get a good one, you’ll be mostly okay, if you can
handle the larger fees. Much of the time, especially when you have a smaller
account, you’re relegated to someone just starting out with the firm, and that
may or may not be in your best interest.
307
Chapter 17: Trading with a Plan Today So You Can Do It Again Tomorrow

Choosing a futures and 
options discount broker
Going the route of the discount broker may be a better alternative if you’re
adventurous and do your homework, which includes practice trading in simu-
lated accounts.
A large number of discount brokers operate in the futures markets, and you
can find most of them by using your favorite search engine on the Internet, or
looking at advertisements in Futures, Active Trader, The Wall Street Journal,
and other publications.
Aside from the important aspects, such as service in general, availability of
24-hour service, commissions, and ease of access to the trading desk, dis-
count brokers offer online trading services. You want to make sure that the
trading platform the discount broker provides is easy to use and that the
orders you place online are executed in a reasonable amount of time.

In This Chapter
 Finding out what’s on your trading mind
 Accounting for what’s in your wallet
 Investigating what you’re worth
T
he futures markets are a zero-sum game. Someone always loses, and
someone always wins. In other words, any money that you make trading
is money that you’ve taken away from someone else who’s also trading.
Put the shoes on your own feet, and you get a better picture of the situation.
Yup, out there in cyberworld or in some crazy trading pit, someone is waiting
to take your money away from you. So before you decide to start trading, you
need to figure out whether you measure up mentally and financially.
I’m not talking about your self-esteem or your intellect here, although good
measures of both are required for success in trading. More important than
how much of those innate qualities you have, you need to know how much
money you have and whether you can manage it well enough for continued
success in trading futures and options — enough to stay in the game.
In this chapter, I tell you about some basic issues that can help you decide
whether you should be a trader or think about doing something else with
your money until your finances are in good enough shape to enable you to
trade comfortably.
In a sense, you need to keep track of two personal balance sheets, a mental
one from which you figure out why you want to trade, and a financial one
from which you decide whether you have enough money to finance your
trading venture.
Both are equally important, and ignoring one or the other is a recipe for 
disaster.

Exploring What’s on Your 
Mental Balance Sheet
Your expectations about futures and options shape the role they play in your
portfolio. As a general rule, futures and options need to be a part of an over-
all financial plan that includes stocks, bonds, mutual funds, annuities, real
estate, and other assets. Although not a mandatory component, futures can
be useful in the portfolio of individuals with large net worths, especially as a
hedge against risk. However, the central tenet of your mental balance sheet is
understanding why trading futures and options appeals to you.
Why do you want to trade?
Most people look to the excitement often associated with gambling and
equate it with trading futures. Unfortunately, trading futures, options, or
other assets is not gambling. Trading isn’t associated with glitz and shouldn’t
be associated with liquor or other diversions. In fact, the more aware you are
of the current global situation and the current situation in your market, the
better off you’ll be.
Here’s how I answer the question: Trading is a hedge for my life. I have two full-
time jobs, my medical practice and my financial business. On occasion, one or
the other takes over as a major income producer. When my trading business
isn’t going well, my medical practice still provides a relatively stable income
and vice versa. (I’ve experienced periods when the opposite has been true.)
I trade for these two reasons:
 It’s my business. Trading and the by-products of trading, such as writing
books, selling subscriptions to my Web site, and occasionally providing
consulting services, are major contributors to my income. By trading,
I’m not only making money, I’m also testing strategies in real time that I
eventually can pass on to my subscribers (www.joe-duarte.com) in
the form of recommendations and insights.
 Trading provides income diversification and enables me to maximize
the total return on my retirement fund. I add as much to my IRA every
year as is legally possible within my means. I don’t miss an opportunity
to contribute to it, no matter what. Some years, I fund my IRA entirely
from the income that trading and related endeavors produce.
For me, trading is an important source of income and income diversification
that I derive from a tremendously enjoyable and agreeable mental and intel-
lectual exercise.
310
Part V: The Trading Plan 

When pondering the question that heads up this section, make sure that your
answers are truthful. Just because you’re looking for kicks, and you think that
trading will fix all your problems, don’t fool yourself. Trading is work that
requires personal and financial commitment, even if it isn’t your primary
source of income. If you take it seriously, then you need to think about what
you’re expecting to get out of it. If you decide that you’re not going to take it
seriously, don’t trade.
Consider the following caveat:
Trading is a sporadic way to produce income. You can experience long
stretches during which no matter how you feel or how accurately you
follow your trading plan, you’ll still have few opportunities to ply your
craft, or you’ll end up going through a long and steady string of losses. In
a good year, I can make as much or more money by trading than I’m
allowed to add to my IRA. By adding money every year, I increase the
overall rate of accumulation in the account. But in a bad year, I may have
to consider taking out a loan to cover my taxes and to fund my IRA.
Trading is a serious game that should not be taken lightly. The key to being a
successful trader is to be comfortable with yourself, your motivation, and
your ability to formulate a plan and put it into action. Before you start trad-
ing, it’s important that you understand why you want to trade and look at
your own life and situation to make a decision that you can live with when it
comes to how much time and effort you can devote to trading and whether
you’re willing to stick to it.
Trading as part of an overall strategy
Trading futures and options needs to be put into proper perspective. After
you’ve sorted out your mental balance sheet, you can consider where trading
fits into your life.
Trading can be a part-time endeavor, or it can be a full-time job. If you’re like
me, you consider trading as full-time work, but all the same, if you do it part
time, it can be a useful source of income.
Say, for example, that you’re a buy-and-hold investor in stocks, concentrating
on income-producing preferred, blue-chip, and utility stocks. Trading futures
can add a more aggressive element to your portfolio.
One ideal way for you to trade to your advantage takes place during times
when a market is moving sideways, and you can improve your income by
writing call options (see Chapters 4 and 5 for more about options). Another
way is when a market is ready to top out, and you can either sell stock-index
futures short or buy put options to protect your stock portfolio.
311
Chapter 18: Looking for Balance Between the Sheets

Trading for a living
On the other hand, when you’re trading futures for a living, you may want to
consider moving to Chicago or New York and looking for a job in the industry.
If that is your goal, it probably will take several years to learn the craft and
may require significant amounts of capital, guile, risk taking, and effort on
your part to accomplish it.
Regardless of what you decide, you can derive at least some benefit from fig-
uring out your mental balance sheet.
The Financial Balance Sheet
The high-risk world of futures trading requires a higher litmus test of your
finances than other forms of investing. In the same way that you took the
time to explore the reasons why you want to trade and how trading is going
to fit into your life, you now must look at your finances with the least amount
of flattery possible.
The big question is whether you have enough money to take risks as a trader.
If you’re struggling to pay your bills every month, and your idea of being sol-
vent is transferring your credit-card balances to a new card every six months
to increase your credit line, you’re better off not trading futures or options.
On the other hand, if you have enough money, you may want to find someone
to do the trading for you. And if you’re somewhere in between, having no
money for trading at all and enough not to worry, you’ll probably have to do
at least some of the work yourself.
Organizing your financial data
Getting organized may sound elementary, but it’s the only place to start. But
before you start adding and subtracting, make sure that you have the follow-
ing matters under control and accounted for within your monthly finances:
 Your living expenses, especially food, mortgage, rent, and car pay-
ments: If you can’t live the way you want to on what you make, looking
for the futures markets to save you from your current situation is not
prudent. You have to have enough money for the basic necessities, food,
transportation, and rent, before you do anything else.
 Your life insurance coverage: The amount here is variable and needs to
be based on your family’s expected expenses after your death. Some
basic life insurance–need calculators are available online. I recommend
a quick Internet search using your favorite search engine.
312
Part V: The Trading Plan 

 Your health insurance needs: Again, the amount of health coverage you
have is based on your family and your individual needs. You need to
figure in a worst-case scenario, though.
 Your retirement plan: This aspect of your finances needs to be one of
your highest priorities before any kind of investing. Make sure that you
establish one and that you fund it as fully as possible before doing any
other kind of investing or trading.
 Your savings plan, including how you’re going to pay for your chil-
dren’s college educations: Start by calculating your savings rate, the
percentage of last year’s earnings that you didn’t spend. 
 Your emergency fund: Set up an emergency fund and don’t even think
about using it to fund your futures trading. At least three to six months’
worth of living expenses is a good start.
When you have the essentials covered, you can turn your sights on reducing
or restructuring your debt with a clear and concise end point in mind so you
can pay it off and start thinking about accumulating money to trade with. One
way is to set yourself up with an allowance every month or every paycheck.
If by some miracle you find that you have enough money left over, congratu-
lations, you can consider trading.
A good place to gather information for preparing this kind of a budget is your
tax return or any recent loan application you’ve filed. You can develop a good
inventory of your assets and liabilities by reviewing credit-card statements,
your checkbook ledger, and your monthly receipts, especially expenses that
are recurring every week or month, such as grocery, cellphone, and utility
bills, and car and house payments.
Don’t forget to include intangibles, such as car repairs and impromptu med-
ical and dental bills, because they can add up in a hurry, and be sure to cate-
gorize your expenses according to their similarities, much like when you’re
preparing your tax return.
Get a second opinion from a financial planner about the state of your
finances. Be careful when your do, because most will tell you that trading
futures and options is too risky, and some will try to sell you high front-
loaded and back-end-loaded mutual funds instead. If you visit a financial advi-
sor or planner, make sure that you tell him upfront that you’re interested only
in him checking your work and your calculations.
Setting realistic goals
Set the bar on your finances high enough that you won’t be sorry later.
Ideally, you need $100,000 or more as an initial trading stake. If you can’t
313
Chapter 18: Looking for Balance Between the Sheets

come up with that kind of money, wait until you can at least meet the lowest
$30,000 to $50,000 trading threshold.
When setting your financial goals, consider the following:
 Your age: How old you are is especially important whenever you’re not
well capitalized. Make sure that you can make your money back if you
happen to have a disastrous start or streak.
 The size of your family: Again, the number of people who rely on you
financially is more important when you’re not well capitalized. If your
income is a significant portion of the family’s well-being, then that takes
precedence regardless of the circumstances. Never sell your family short.
 Job security: Most traders and would-be traders need a steady infusion
of income that’s provided by a steady job. If you decide that trading is
your job, you still need to find a way to supplement your income during
the times when trading won’t provide you with enough money.
 Your family’s attitude toward trading: If your spouse is going to harass
you about trading, or you lose contact with the family because you’re up
at strange hours trading currencies, you’re going to have a major prob-
lem at some point.
 Your own risk tolerance and emotional status: If you can’t stand the
thought of what you’ll do if you get a margin call or you get wiped out,
find something else to do.
Calculating Your Net Worth
Your net worth can guide you in making your final decision about whether
you can actually afford to become a futures trader. The calculation is simple,
but it requires attention to detail. Widely used financial computer programs
like Quicken can help you do the work. A quick search on your favorite
Internet search engine takes you to several Web sites that feature other pro-
grams that also can help. You can find a simple free calculator on the Web
through a quick search, or ask your bank for a checklist.
You can also do the calculations by hand. If you need a major helping hand
with this aspect of getting set up, pick up a copy of Eric Tyson’s Personal
Finance For Dummies (Wiley).
Figure 18-1 shows you a generic personal balance sheet that’s self-explanatory.
First, you list your assets and add them all up. Next do the same with your
liabilities. Finally, you subtract the liabilities from the assets, and you get
your net worth.
314
Part V: The Trading Plan 

That bottom-line number, your net worth, is the amount you hope that you
can get out of all the things you own after you pay off all the debt you owe if
for some reason you have to sell everything. And that’s the number that can
tell you whether trading futures is a good idea.
Pay special attention to the amounts that you have in the following:
 Cash: Cash means the amount of money you have in money-market
funds, your pocket, and even stashed in your secret hiding place.

Chapter 18: Looking for Balance Between the Sheets

 Stocks, bonds, and retirement accounts: Most people hold stocks,
bonds, and mutual funds in their retirement accounts, although some
also own them outside of their retirement plans. Any money that’s in a
retirement account will be subject to tax consequences and early with-
drawal penalties, so you need to include those amounts in the calcula-
tion. However, you also need to be realistic. You’re not likely to cash in
your IRA or 401(k) plan to go speculate on soybeans. After reading this
book, you better not.
 Business assets: Consider how much of your business assets are
involved in cash flow and inventory. Be careful not to be too generous 
in this category.
 Credit-card balances, second mortgages, and adjustable-rate mort-
gages: Pay special attention to these amounts under liabilities, and be
sure to include the latest credit-card balance and make sure the amount
includes any big purchases that you’ve recently made. Don’t hesitate to
check your account online for the most current, real-time statement on
your credit cards.
After you do all of the calculations, here’s a useful guideline: If your net worth
is less than $200,000, you shouldn’t be trading at all, much less trading
futures.
Differentiating between trading and investing is important. If you have
$200,000 or less, investing in mutual funds is perfectly acceptable, perhaps
even in a mixture of stocks and funds, as long as you’re careful to follow
sound money management and loss management rules and have a long
enough time frame to make it profitable. But, if you are trading, which by defi-
nition means aggressively and actively deploying your money, you’ll want to
keep the following in mind as a bare-bones set of criteria:
Never risk more than 10 percent of your net worth as a trading stake
unless you have a net worth of at least $500,000 to $1 million or more and
you’re a well-equipped, stable, and experienced trader. If you are, you
may want to risk as much as 20 percent of your net worth to trade, pro-
vided your expenses and long-term investments are covered. However,
risking more than 25 percent of your net worth in any trading venue is a
crapshoot and will likely get you into trouble.

In This Chapter
 Choosing what to trade and understanding how to trade it
 Keeping those profits coming
 Checking and practicing trading strategies
 Timing your markets for entry and exit points
 Checking your trade results and adjusting for success
A
solid trading plan consists of developing a broad understanding of what
you’ll be trading, getting a handle on your emotions, finding out about
different strategies, and tempering your expectations of and interactions with
the market. It also takes in the more methodical nuts and bolts of actually
putting together a step-by-step detailed plan in which you microscopically
map out your strategies and rules.
In this chapter, I give you the background needed to create a more specific
trading plan than you ever imagined.
Deciding What You’ll Trade
I have no secret here, no magic rules or revelations. I can tell you only that
you need to trade what you like and use what you already know to your
advantage as much as possible. So when preparing a trading plan, take the
following into account:
 Use your experience. Use what you know to focus on areas in which
you’re already an expert, but trade what feels right and what you have
success in.
 Get specific and get good by applying and refining your knowledge.
It’s great to be a one-trick pony. Of all the currencies, I prefer the euro. I

find that for me, it makes sense. European monetary policy moves at the
pace of molasses, and the European economy usually is slow moving at
best. In other words, the news from Europe is less likely to move the
markets directly. Instead, the euro is a reactionary currency that tends
to move in a slow, steady, one-directional trend, as opposed to other cur-
rencies that can be more volatile, such as the Japanese yen, the Swiss
franc, and the British pound.
 Study the markets. See which ones appeal to you the most. If you enjoy
trading stocks, you may do well with stock-index futures. If you like a
particular sector, such as energy, try a few paper trades (practicing with-
out money) with oil, natural gas, heating oil, or gasoline.
If you’re a political junkie like me, the bond and currency markets may
suit you well, because they’re the markets that move the most with poli-
tics and world crises.
If you’re in real estate and construction, consider copper and bond
futures. Interest rates are the fuel for mortgage rates, while copper is
one of the key building materials in home building.
If you own a gas station, you probably have a good understanding of
supply and demand in the energy markets.
If you work in produce, you may have a leg up in grains and seeds.
 Remain flexible. If you discover that you have a penchant for trading
well in the soybean markets, even though you’re not in the business and
you never knew anything about it before, add soybeans to your trading
arsenal.
Adapting to the Markets
A major part of your trading success is your ability to adapt. Even if you’re a
specialist trading one or two markets primarily, you still encounter periods
when those markets trade in difficult patterns.
The major point to understand is that no plan works for all situations.
However, you can rely on these realities of the markets. They trade in threes:
 Three market directions: Up, down, or sideways
 Three trading styles: Trading the reversal, momentum trading, and
swing trading
You need to be familiar with the three major trading directions and styles.
318
Part V: The Trading Plan 

Trading the reversal
When trading the reversal, you’re looking for the market’s turning point, when
either a bottom or a top is being made. To find that turning point, you need to
keep an eye on the current trend and watch for a significant trend change.
The longer a trend stays in place, the more important the reversal will be,
and the longer the new trend is likely to stay in place. Here are some tips for
identifying a change in trends:
 Use moving averages, trend lines, and oscillators to predict and pinpoint
as precisely as possible the meaningful trend changes. I describe how to
use these indicators in Chapter 7, which is about technical analysis, and
in the numerous examples of individual trades throughout this book.
 Set your entry points just above the breakout if you’re going long and
below the trend breakdown (a switch by the market to a downtrend) if
you’re going short. See Chapters 7, 8, and 20 for more trading tips. Use a
sell stop for long trades and a buy stop to cover your shorts when
you’re betting on a breakdown.
Trading with momentum
Trading with the trend or with the momentum of the market is a classic style
of participating in the markets. In fact, it’s something that I always recom-
mend that you do. It works the same way in uptrends that it does in down-
trends. Just keep the following in mind:
 If the market is trending up, your position needs to be long. Even if
you’re day trading, your primary goal needs to be to look for opportuni-
ties to trade when the market is rising.
 If the market is falling (trending down), you need to be short.
 As with any other trade, protect yourself by using stops. Stops are
preset instructions that direct your broker to sell your position when a
certain price is reached and keep your losses from expanding beyond
control (see Chapters, 7, 8, and 20).
 Use the market as your guide in momentum trading. You need to let
the market help you make decisions for buying and selling.
 When you’re going long, you need to look for breakouts as entry
points. Breakouts are signs of market strength.
 When you’re going short, you need to look for breakdowns to enter
your short position. Breakdowns are signs of market weakness.
319
Chapter 19: Developing Strategies Now to Avoid Pain Later

A rising channel can be used as an opportunity to swing trade or to trade by
using momentum strategies. In this case, every pullback to the lower trend
line was yet another opportunity to go long, and every tag of the upper trend
line was an opportunity to either take profits and watch for what the market
would do next or consider a short-term opportunity by short-selling the
market. I tell you more about swing trading in the next section.
Swing trading
Swing trading is the best method for trading in markets in which prices are
moving sideways, neither going up nor down. For more information about
swing trading, see Chapter 8.
Managing Profitable Positions
One of the most important aspects of trading is deciding what to do when
you’ve earned a nice profit, and you’re getting antsy about cashing in. This
situation may occur during the course of a normal market or one that is
reaching the irrational exuberance, or blow-off, stage.
You must watch for several important indicators during a blowoff, or in a
market that seems unstoppable and experiences short-term corrections. That
can mean that sometimes the market sells off in the middle of the day, and
buyers are waiting for the market to drop so they can buy at lower prices.
In this kind of market environment, especially when you’ve earned big prof-
its, taking profits is a good idea whenever the market drops for two consecu-
tive days.
On the other hand, if the market opens down significantly without news, take
it as a sign that worse things may be coming. And if the market fails to set a
new high after a short-term correction, it’s pointing to an important sign that
a significant top is developing.
Whenever the market breaks and you don’t sell your position in time, use the
snap-back rally, which is when the market bounces after an aggressive period
of selling that usually develops so you can move out of your position and into
the next.
320
Part V: The Trading Plan 

Building yourself a pyramid 
(without being a pharaoh)
Futures traders add to profitable positions by pyramiding, or adding more
contracts to existing profitable positions.
Never use a reverse or inverted pyramid strategy when trading. By that I
mean that the first number of contracts you buy needs to be the guideline for
your maximum risk. If, for example, you bought three crude-oil contracts,
doubled your initial investment in the trade, and the market still looks attrac-
tive, you can add to your position, but only by a maximum of three contracts
each time you add to your pyramid. The goal is to keep adding contracts as
long as the market remains in the same trend or until reality sets in and you
run out of the money that you’d set aside for this trade.
When you pyramid a position, you’re adding to your existing holdings, not
selling your holdings and starting a new position. Check out the example at
the end of this section, where I detail how to pyramid a position in which
your initial buy is ten contracts.
Use a pyramid strategy only during the early stages of a move, such as the
breakout and subsequent early stages of the breakout. If you try it when the
market has been moving in one direction for a long time, you’re likely to 
lose money.
Preventing good profits from 
turning into losses
When you trade and the market turns on you quickly, you obviously have to
get out with whatever you have left. But when your positions show nice prof-
its, don’t let the market take away your hard-earned gains.
Stay on top of your profits by setting protective sell stops as the market
moves. For more details about stops, see the previous section and Chapters
3, 7, 8, and 20. With protective stops, you can (at all costs) make every
attempt to at least break even on nice big profits, especially when you’re
trading markets that move quickly and can change at the drop of a hat if
you’re not paying attention.
For example, say you establish a position in the euro at 8 a.m., the market ral-
lies, and by 11 a.m. you have a nice profit. In the middle of the day while you
take a lunch break away from your trading screen (bad idea), news breaks,
321
Chapter 19: Developing Strategies Now to Avoid Pain Later

and the euro tumbles, taking your profit with it. If you had set a (protective)
sell stop and had adjusted it higher as your profits accumulated, you would
have gotten stopped out with more money than you started.
Never adding to losing positions
When the market goes against you, it’s time to get out. If you average down,
or add to positions at lower prices in the futures markets, you’ll get hurt badly.
Back Testing Your Strategies
Back testing is the practice of using historical data to test how well your indi-
cators work in a particular market. It’s a tricky practice, because software
programs enable you to look at past markets and test how different methods
and indicators have worked in the past. These capabilities amount to a
double-edged sword in a chaotic universe, because although your indicators
may back test well, you still can get a false sense of security. Similarly, what
didn’t work in the past may somehow start working.
In other words, no trades ever work exactly the same way twice, so you have
to take your back-testing results with a grain of salt. Back testing can, how-
ever, help give you a broad feel for how markets behave under certain condi-
tions and help you spot important characteristics of the market, such as the
following:
 Seasonal trends: Seasonal trends work best when trading the grain,
seed, and livestock markets, because those markets are dependent on
well-established planting and harvesting cycles. In other markets, such
as bonds and currencies, seasonality is often less reliable, except during
short periods of time. For example, stock prices tend to rise at the end
of every month and the first few trading days of a new month, because
institutions put new money to work during that time frame.
 Market tendencies: The amount of time that a particular market tends
to run in a certain direction is a great example. If you look at a long-term
chart of the U.S. dollar index, you immediately see that its trend lines tend
to last for months to years after they’re established (see Chapter 11).
 Indicators: Use your indicators wisely after you confirm their accuracy
by back testing them. Get the big picture. For example, if you’re testing a
moving average crossover method, remember that the one you’re study-
ing now may not work as well later. However, if your testing shows that
moving average crossovers work in the market you’re testing, get a
handle on several combinations, and then monitor them in the current
market to find out which ones work best.
322
Part V: The Trading Plan 

Setting Your Time Frame for Trading
The aspects of trading that are most often mismatched are the trader’s per-
sonality and the time frame of the trade. Some people are just more patient
than others. To be a good trader, you have to find that delicate balance between
your level of patience and the reality of the market. If you try to impose your
personality on the market, you’re going to get hurt. At the same time, you have
to let your general tendencies guide you toward your trading style.
Day trading
Day trading is a misunderstood and oft maligned term. Day trading is the
practice of holding positions open for short periods of time during the trad-
ing day with the goal of accruing small, but numerous, profits. Usually it
means that you exit all positions at the end of the trading day and return to
the market with a fresh slate the next day. What it doesn’t mean is that you
trade every day or that you open positions at the open of the trading day no
matter what.
When day trading, you still need to keep basic trading principles in mind,
such as picking good entry and exit points, placing protective stops, manag-
ing your money, and using technical analysis. And you still need to keep an
eye on the news and on the overall trends of the markets.
Intermediate-term trading
Traditionally, intermediate-term trading means that you hold a position for
several weeks to several months, which ultimately is impractical in the
futures markets, where volatility can lead to margin calls and where leverage
makes holding positions for extended periods extremely dangerous.
So in the futures markets, intermediate is more likely to mean several days
and is more often referred to as position trading, where you use a longer-term
time frame as your reference point for keeping a position open.
Long-term trading
Long-term trading is impractical in the futures markets, unless you’re
extremely well capitalized, and you’re hedging your business. When that is
the case, however, you can use contracts that are several months to even
years ahead as your positions as long as you’re mindful of expiration dates
and other parameters. 
323
Chapter 19: Developing Strategies Now to Avoid Pain Later

Setting Price Targets
Setting price targets is a useful strategy, especially when you’re swing trad-
ing, which is where you ease into and out of positions by closely watching a
market’s trading range. Setting targets in momentum markets, however, may
do more harm than good, because you may sell a potentially huge profitable
position too soon.
Adapting your strategy to the market’s overall trend is the better approach,
but Fibonacci levels and support and resistance levels can help you set tar-
gets for taking profits.
Reviewing Your Results
After each trade, finding out why you did well or why you failed is a good
idea. Checking your trading data from the time you enter a position to the
time you exit it on every single trade can be tedious, but it also can be
extremely useful. Here is a fairly good overview of the kinds of information
and questions you may want to check and answer after good or bad trades:
 Exit and entry points: Review your exit and entry points and then ask
yourself whether you adapted the right strategy to the right market and
whether you used the best possible method to protect yourself.
Did you give yourself enough room to maneuver? For example, was your
sell stop too tight? Should you have given the market more room?
 Your charts: Go back and look at the charts you used to make your
trade to find out whether the market you were trading is acting similar
to the way history shows it has acted in the past. If it isn’t, then try to
figure out what’s different about the market.
 Fundamentals: Did you really understand what the fundamentals of the
market were telling you? Did you understand the nuts and bolts of the
industry? For example, did you pay attention to the part of the livestock
cycle that the market was in when you traded hogs? Or did you check
the weather reports before you shorted soybeans?
 Market suitability: Are you really suited for trading in a given market?
Does it move too fast or too slow for you? If you’re trading currencies,
for example, can you handle moves that last for several days and keep
your positions open overnight? Or does that frighten you and make you
lose sleep? If you lose sleep, you’ll be flat-footed when you wake up, and
you’re thus bound to miss something. A 20-minute gap in a chart can be
324
Part V: The Trading Plan 

closed in an hour, because the bad or good news that moved your cur-
rency turned out to be a false alarm, and the market moved briskly
beyond (above) where it was trading before the news hit.
 Technical analysis: Did you let your own personal judgment ruin your
trade because you thought you knew better than the charts? Always
trade what you see and not what you think you know. You may eventu-
ally be right, and then you can trade the other way, but in the present,
trade with the charts, follow the market’s response to the news that hit
today, and forget what the talking heads are saying.
 Market volume and sentiment: Did you consider the market’s volume
and the overall sentiment before you bought that top and got stopped
out in a hurry? Low volume and high levels of pessimism often mean
that a market has bottomed, while huge volume and a feeling of invinci-
bility are the hallmark of a pending top.
 Subtleties: Don’t miss the subtle stuff. Did you pay attention to your
indicators? Did you look at your RSI and MACD oscillators for signs that
the market’s bottom that you missed came on a lower low on the charts
but a higher low on the indicator?
Remember Your Successes 
and Manage Your Failures
When things go well, you need to remember the moment in your gut, your
mind, and your being. If you fail, do the same. That way, if you’re ever faced
with a similar set of situations, you have a visceral and mental archive that
will let you react in the correct manner.
This strategy is tailor-made for trading. For example, when you make a big
profit, you need to sear the particulars of that trade into your mind. Try to
remember how you did it, what you saw, what you felt, and what decisions
you made along the way.
Following your trading plan all the way down to your checklist always is the
better approach to trading, because then you already have a road map with
which to evaluate your performance.
When managing your failures, avoiding the markets that you just don’t under-
stand is best. For example, I don’t trade gold. It just doesn’t work for me, so I
manage it by avoiding it.
325
Chapter 19: Developing Strategies Now to Avoid Pain Later

In the rare instances when I do consider trading gold stocks or other gold-
related instruments, I always ask myself really tough questions, such as
whether I can stand the lack of sleep. The result: I rarely trade gold.
Making the Right Adjustments
After evaluating your successes and your failures, you can make changes that
keep you out of trouble by
 Avoiding markets that you don’t understand or that make you 
uncomfortable.
 Not adding to positions without planning your strategy before pulling
the trigger.
 Having your roadmap ready and not deviating from it unless you’ve pre-
viously decided how you’ll do it and how far you’re willing to go.
 Not making the same mistake twice. If you get nailed in the oil market,
don’t trade oil until you’ve figured out why you got hammered.

T
his chapter is all about putting together the analysis, the execution, and
the management of a trade. Although throughout this chapter, that infor-
mation generally is hypothetical, it nevertheless relies on real-life examples
of trading, starting with your pretrade analysis and then detailing the actual
execution of the trade through a phone conversation with your trading desk,
managing the position, and then closing out the trade.
The trade I outline chronologically in this chapter obviously is idealized, but
it isn’t meant to be a Pollyanna-like exercise. Instead, it’s an exercise of dis-
covery that uses a real-life example in an active market — the oil market —
during a crucial period of time.
Setting the Stage
Here’s the scene: The oil market has been in a bull run during the last two
months, but a major sell-off took place August 17, 2005.
Following that sell-off, you know that these three scenarios are possible:
 A major break in the bullish trend is near, which (in this case) gives you
a chance to go short.
 The market is about to bounce, which gives you an opportunity to play the
countertrend rally, meaning that although you suspect that the primary

trend is the dominant trend, you can still make money in the coun-
tertrend by buying a position at a lower price, when the market is over-
sold in the short term (see Chapter 7 for more about oversold and
overbought markets) if there are signs of a bottom. You can then ride
the rising price until it once again turns lower.
 A short-term pullback is occurring in a market that is plenty strong, 
and by buying on this pullback, you can snag a nice profit as things pick
up steam.
If you’re trading a short-term pullback, and the rally is a good rally, then it
can carry the market on to new highs. If you’re trading a countertrend rally, it
will fail. You’ll know which one it is after the fact. The important factors: You
can identify a market that is poised to rally, you know that it can be a rally
that fails or a rally that carries the market to new highs, and you can prepare
yourself to deal with either possibility.
With these three possibilities in mind, you begin analyzing the oil market,
starting August 18, 2005, the day after the big sell-off.
Your three major goals are
 Analyzing the situation. Combine your knowledge of technical and fun-
damental analyses with the psychology of a market in the midst of a
major bull run.
 Designing a trading strategy. Based on your analyses, you must design
a well-crafted, step-by-step, careful plan that either makes you some
money or gets you out of the position with as little damage as possible
(if you’re wrong), or the market turns against you.
 Putting the plan into action. Make the trade, establish the position, and
then manage it as you take the plunge into chaos.
After the sell-off, you wake up the next morning, get your coffee ready as your
computer boots up, and survey the landscape. As you sip coffee while going
through your stretching routine, you scan the latest news on CNBC, in The
Wall Street Journal, or on Google News or the Dow Jones Newswires. You
probably ought to check Reuters and Bloomberg, too.
As you scroll through all that information, you have only one goal in mind,
watching the different markets as they set up for trading.
What you know for sure is that the date is August 18, 2005, a bull market is
raging in oil and has been for several years, and the market is clearly at a 
critical juncture, because crude oil futures took a tumble the day before after
the release of supply data showed a greater-than-expected fall in gasoline
328
Part V: The Trading Plan 

inventories. Normally that would have been a bullish piece of news, but the
sudden downturn, of course, got you thinking that the oil market either is
making a major top or may be providing you with a long entry point at a
cheaper price.
You take another sip of coffee, and find out that oil is trading near $64 per
barrel, the dollar is stable, and stock index futures are flat. Bonds are waiting
for the release of the morning’s economic data.
You’re focused on oil. It’s the hot market, and it’s the one that suits your style
and the one where you’ve had your share of success.
Getting the Big Picture
As you pour yourself another cup of coffee and grab a roll, you realize that
you have some time before heavy trading in crude gets going in a couple of
hours, but you note that the price has steadily crept higher in the overnight
markets. The economic data of the day include initial jobless claims, July
Conference Board leading indicators, the Dow Jones-Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
(DJ-BTM) Business Barometer, and the August Philadelphia Fed Business
Index, but these releases aren’t usually big market movers.
The news is grizzly, but not particularly so, despite the usual and awful body
count emanating from Baghdad and the war in Iraq.
One item catches your eye, though. Although not well covered by the media,
some of the intelligence services that you subscribe to have commented on
the 400 bombs that went off almost simultaneously in Bangladesh. Although
an unlikely place for the dramatic, Al-Qaeda is high on the list of suspects in
the bombing, and the analysis from the intelligence services suggests that it
may be a prelude to an escalation.
So you decide that for now, you’ll just be a spectator, watching the oil mar-
kets during the next couple of days while sorting through thoughts that the
mainstream media hasn’t covered the Bangladesh situation well. You ponder
the idea that because Bangladesh is in Asia, Asian traders have been paying
some attention to it and that may be why oil has stabilized. You’re thinking
that somebody with some money somewhere may be thinking that some kind
of an attack is possible, and as a result, has been building a long position in
oil, which is why the market has been steady overnight. You know that big
money is also fast money, so you decide to watch and wait and do a little
more leg work.
329
Chapter 20: Executing Successful Trades

Viewing the long-term 
picture of the market
You pull up your one-year chart for the December crude-oil contract and note
that the August 17 sell-off was preceded by a warning sign from the Relative
Strength Index (RSI) oscillator, a reliable indicator for oil. See Chapters 8 and 13
for more about the RSI oscillator.
The RSI oscillator is an important and key indicator that tends to serve as a
good early warning system. Your point of view is now narrowed, because you
expect that oil will likely bounce, but the bounce may be limited by the long-
term overbought nature of the oil market. An overbought market is one that
has been rising for an extended period of time, and as the term implies, has
gone too far. When markets reach extremely overbought states — for exam-
ple, when markets have been rising for many years — corrections, or pull-
backs, are more likely.
A perfect example is shown in Figure 20-1. The label “RSI sell signal” marks an
important momentum failure, because the RSI oscillator failed to make a new
high when the crude oil contract made a new high. This situation is called a
nonconfirmation and usually is a sign that a top has been made.
You’re all set now. You have the background from which you’ll approach your
trade, albeit with some reservation. Until proven otherwise, a top is possible,
but the opportunity for a short-term trade on the long side is worth keeping
an eye on.
The oil market still is bullish, and formulating a hypothesis is a good idea.
However, the only thing that matters is not whether you were right or wrong;
it’s whether you make money.
Doing a little technical analysis
Check out the technical status of the oil market by
 Examining the long-term trend. The crude oil contract is above its 20-,
50-, and 200-day moving averages. The long- and intermediate-term
trends clearly are up, meaning that your focus needs to be on whether
those key moving average support levels hold. If key support levels fail,
then you’ll feel more comfortable about shorting this market. (See
Chapter 7 for more about market trends and support.)
 Watching the behavior of the market in relationship to the Bollinger
bands. All the way up this huge bull run, the Bollinger bands — both
upper and lower — have served as support and resistance for crude oil
(see Figure 20-1). Notice that every time oil prices tag one or the other of
330
Part V: The Trading Plan 

the bands, the result usually and eventually leads to a reversal and a tag
of the opposite band.
 Noticing that the 20-day moving average also provided fairly good
support for this market.
In this example, the chance of a bounce is fairly good, based on the technical
analysis, because the contract remains above the 20-day moving average,
which is roughly at $64 per barrel. A quick Fibonacci check of the current
trading range, with a high near $68.16 and a low near $58.23, gives you a trad-
ing range of $9.93. By dividing $9.93 by two, you figure that $4.96 is the mid-
point of the range and that somewhere around $63.19, crude may make a
stand — give or take 50 cents on either side for good measure. The number
for the 20-day moving average adds good support and confirmation to the
mix (see Chapters 7 and 8).
Now that you have your parameters, you can set up alarms on your trading
software to alert you when crude prices fall to $63.19 per barrel.
Stalking the Setup
You’re now waiting for the setup, or a key set of developments that need to
come together almost simultaneously before you pull the trigger and make
the trade.
As you wait for these circumstances to occur, you can set your sights on the
short-term chart (see Figure 20-1) and run through the following checklist to
get ready for the trade:
 Check the status of your account.
 Review the key characteristics of your contract.
 Hone in on the short-term chart.
 Fine-tune your strategy.
 Review your plan of attack.
Checking your account
Always know how much money you have in your account. You can check
your account status online. Say, for example, that you have $100,000 worth 
of equity. Your margin check shows that you need an initial margin of $4,725
per December contract and a maintenance margin of $3,375 in the months
beyond September. See Chapter 3 for details about margins.
331
Chapter 20: Executing Successful Trades

By consulting the margin requirements for the December contract for crude
oil, you quickly calculate that you have enough in your account for going long
or short on two contracts, because the margin is $4,725 × 2 = $8,750. You
want to figure in how much to limit your losses to, so you have $1,350 per
contract that you can play with before you start getting worried about a
margin call ($4,725 – $3,375).
Reviewing key characteristics 
of your contract
As you formulate this trade, reviewing the characteristics of the crude-oil
futures contract is a good idea. A barrel of oil holds 42 gallons and trades in
U.S. dollars per barrel worldwide. The minimum tick of $0.01 (1 cent) is equal
to $10 per contract. A single futures contract for light, sweet crude is in the
amount of 1,000 barrels, or 42,000 gallons of oil.
That means that each penny you gain or lose is $10 worth of gain or loss in
the contract, so you figure that $1 in price movement in crude oil is $1,000
worth of gain or loss. That means that your loss limit has to be 50 cents per

contract, or 5 percent, a standard loss limit used by professional traders that
usually gives the market enough room to fluctuate but also steers you clear
of huge losses. See Chapter 17 for the details about trading plan and money-
management rules. You need to follow the rules you establish, or else you’ll
eventually get into trouble.
Looking at the short-term chart
Careful observation of Figure 20-2, which covers the 24-hour trading cycle for
crude oil over a three-day period from August 17 through August 19, 2005,
reveals that the $63.50-per-barrel price range is a key short-term support
level. You focus on that level, noting that as the regular trading session ends
on August 18, the market breaks below $63 and touches $62.75 per barrel,
which is where buyers come out, and by the 2:30 p.m. regular close, they’ve
driven the price back above $64, where it stayed overnight.
Regular open-cry trading hours at the NYMEX are from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
(14:30) eastern time. After-hours futures trading takes place electronically via
NYMEX ACCESS, an Internet-based trading platform, beginning at 3:15 p.m.
Monday through Thursday and concluding at 9:30 a.m. the following day. On
Sundays, the session begins at 7 p.m.
Now you know that your Fibonacci analysis held up (see the “Doing a little
technical analysis” section, earlier in the chapter) and that you have a decent
chance to go long if the market holds near $64 in the next trading session —
whether overnight or during the regular session — unless something goes
awry in the oil market overnight.

Chapter 20: Executing Successful Trades

Fine-tuning your strategy
You decide that if the oil market holds above $64 per barrel by the morning,
you’ll place a market order for one contract and watch what happens.
Prepare and then write down your trading strategy in clear terms before you
go to bed: For example, you may write: “Buy one contract at $64 or slightly
higher, and depending on market conditions, place a sell stop at $63.50. Buy a
second contract if market continues to hold.”
Reviewing your plan of attack
After you come up with a plan, review it just to be on the safe side. Because
you decided to wait to see what happens overnight, you want to make sure
that you’re up and running in the morning. So going over what’s happened,
what you’ve done to prepare, and taking any steps needed to shore up your
strategy is a good last step before you go to bed.
Here’s what you’ve accomplished:
 You were attracted to the oil market (the right one for you), because it’s
where the action is. You understand the oil market, so it’s okay to trade it.
 You’ve figured out the key trading range (see the earlier section on
“Looking at the short-term chart”), and you were able to pick out a major
potential bottom using moving averages and Fibonacci retracement-level
analysis (see the earlier section on “Doing a little technical analysis”).
 You’ve waited patiently for the right setup.
 You’ve calculated your risk, and you’ve decided on your entry point and
your sell-stop placement, as described in the tip under “Fine-tuning your
strategy.”
Understanding Intermarket Relationships
You’re getting ready to trade an oil contract, which means that you’re about
to put your money up against some very heavy hitters, including hedge-fund
traders, traders for Southwest Airlines, Exxon Mobil, the Saudi government,
Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and other dark-cloaked and hooded figures lurking 
out there.
334
Part V: The Trading Plan 

As you wait for your setup to gel, you need to check what other pertinent
markets are doing, including the following:
 Gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas: As of August 18, 2005, these mar-
kets were all in recovery mode — the same as crude oil after the selling
period earlier in the week. The key is that all of these markets, including
oil, were trending in the same direction.
 Oil, oil service, and natural gas stocks: In this real-life example, these
sectors also were in the same general trading pattern.
 The U.S. dollar: The dollar was recovering after some selling earlier in
the month. That often means that money is looking for refuge, and it was
a reassuring sign, if as you originally thought, the smart money was get-
ting concerned about the Bangladesh bombing being a clue that some-
thing else may be in the works on the terrorist front.
 The bond market: Again, bond yields were stable and slightly lower
than they had been a week earlier, which also was supportive of the idea
that money was moving toward safe havens.
You can never have too much information when risking your money in the
futures market. Your thorough and methodical analysis of the situation is
reassuring and supportive of your overall thesis, which is that oil was due for
a bounce and that fear of terror may have been making its way back into the
energy market.
Oil always is a politically influenced market. But in 2005, it was the most polit-
ically influenced market. That meant that all kinds of interesting strategies
may have been lurking, waiting for your two contracts to hit the market so
that your stake could be shaved to nothing in a hurry.
Waiting for the Catalyst
Catalysts can always affect the markets, because at some point sellers will
overwhelm buyers, or buyers will overwhelm sellers. As a futures trader, the
direction of the market doesn’t matter as much as your preparation and your
reaction.
Waiting for something to jump-start the market is tricky business, because
the market can move based on virtually any piece of news, on something
purely technical, or just because buyers or sellers overwhelmed the other
side at a particular time, and limit orders that were just above or below a key
chart point were triggered.
335
Chapter 20: Executing Successful Trades

You’ve done your homework. You have your strategy. The only thing left to
do is wait and then put your strategy into play.
Jumping on the Wild Beast: 
Calling in Your Order
You wake up on August 19, 2005, and see that nothing changed overnight. You
checked oil prices just before going to bed, and you know that you never set
alarms overnight to wake you up, because the resulting lack of sleep can
impair your judgment during the regular trading session.
When you wake up, you check your 30-minute chart, and observe that oil has
traded near $64 all night long. So after you do your morning check of the news,
events, and the currency and bond markets, you decide to place your trade.
You decide that you want to wait for the regular trading session, and you
place the call about 15 minutes after the market opens. That may or may not
be enough time to allow for any adjustments from the overnight session to
take place, but the charts are telling you that you need to make your decision.
You have good trading software, but you decide to call your broker, because
she’s been good about giving you good fills, and the guys at the trading desk
are good at making sure that you, as a fairly young trader, get the kind of
order that you want executed.
So you place the call, using all the correct language. Here’s a good template
to follow when calling in an order:
1. Say who you are.
“This is Tom Smith.”
2. Say what kind of order you’re placing.
“This is a futures order.” If it was an options order, that’s what you’d say
at this point.
3. Give your account number.
“My account number is 8648642.”
4. In a clear voice, say what you want done.
Buy one October crude oil, $63.39 stop.
5. Ask for a reading of your order before you agree to have it sent to the
floor.
The desk usually does this automatically, but it doesn’t hurt to remind
the person with whom you’re working that you need confirmation.
336
Part V: The Trading Plan 

If for any reason you’re unsure about your order or unsure whether the desk
understood it, make sure that you either cancel it or confirm that the trading
desk person knows exactly what you want to do.
You just told the trading desk that you wanted to buy one October crude oil
contract at the market price and that you wanted to place a sell stop at
$63.39. The desk reads the order back to you, and you agree. The order then
gets transmitted to the trading floor, and the desk informs you that you’re
filled at $64.10 and gives you your order number.
If you wanted to keep the order active indefinitely, you would have told the
trading desk that it was a good-’til-canceled (GTC) order. If you wanted to
make it a limit order, you would have specified the limit. The fact that you
didn’t make the order a day order, which would be canceled at the end of the
day, makes it a market order, so the point is not that important here. See
Chapter 3 for more details about the different types of orders.
When you open an account with a broker, the broker sends you detailed
information about how to place orders and what the correct language is.
Some have special trading desks for new and inexperienced traders. Most
futures brokers are fully aware of the fact that they need your business and
will do everything they can to make your life as easy as possible short of
guaranteeing that you’ll make money.
Riding the Storm
As the day progresses, the market stays fairly quiet, so you decide to put in a
second market order that also gets filled at $64.10. At 11:30, the market takes
off, and your positions are looking good.
You have some gains after all that waiting — hurrah! And you’re still pro-
tected by your stop. Now, you raise your stop to $64.50 as the market is start-
ing to take off. As the regular trading close nears, the market is rallying even
more, so you raise your stop to $65, and you’re nicely ahead now, with a guar-
anteed paper profit of $900 per contract if your stop gets hit without a major
catastrophe knocking prices down so where you get stopped out below your
protective stop. A good rule of thumb in a market that is moving rapidly is to
raise your stop by 50 cents for every 50-cent rise in the market. You can also
place a trailing sell stop and set it at 5 percent. Although I’m giving you guide-
lines here, the more you trade and the more you become familiar with the
way each individual market trades, the more likely you’ll develop your own
guidelines. The message here is that as the market rises, you need to raise
your sell stop to lock in gains.
Now you have a decision to make. Your overall profit is more than $2,000 as
the market nears the close on August 19, 2005, a Friday. Your options are
337
Chapter 20: Executing Successful Trades

 Selling both contracts and taking stock of your position on Monday.
This strategy makes sense, because you never know what’s going to
happen over the weekend.
 Tightening your stops. This strategy can get you stopped out of the
market, which means that your sell stop is triggered, your position is
closed, and you’re out of the market. That would be good if the market
crashed, or lost ground, and it may cost you some money if you no
longer have a position and the market rallies again. Remember, you want
to let your profits run.
 Selling one contract. You can take profits on one of your positions,
while you let the other one run.
 Setting up an option position. By using a put and call straddle, you can
protect yourself. A straddle is when you buy a call option and a put
option at the same time. If the market goes up, your call option goes up
in price. If the market goes down, your put option goes up in price. The
call falls in price in a falling market, and the put falls in price in a rising
market. To make money from a straddle, you sell the losing option and
keep the rising option. In this case, you can keep your oil futures con-
tract(s) and hedge your position with the straddle. If nothing happens,
you can sell both the put and call on Monday and be back to trading only
the oil futures. See Chapters 4 and 5 for more about options strategies.
Knowing When You’ve Had Enough
Presented with the four trading options in the previous section, I’d choose to
take profits on one contract and see what happens during the weekend. I am
a cautious trader, and I don’t like leaving large positions open during the
weekend. By taking profits on one contract and leaving a protective sell stop
on the open contract, I’ve accomplished two things. First, I took partial prof-
its on a good trade, and second, I’ve left myself with a reasonable and tolera-
ble risk over the weekend, without having to worry about the straddle, its
commissions, and the added risk that can accompany options trades. You
can choose whichever maneuver suits your personality. The key is that so far
you have a nice profit, and you’re not likely to let it turn into a loss.
By the time crude opened Sunday night, August 21, 2005, the October con-
tract was trading above $66, adding to your profit. You can raise your stop
higher overnight by using your trading software or by calling your trading
desk. Most brokerages offer overnight and 24-hour trading desks.
At this point, you can once again take profits by closing out the position or
continue to raise your stops. I’d choose to ride this position out and continue
to manage it by raising the sell stop, keeping a close watch on any resistance
levels that are nearby.
338
Part V: The Trading Plan 

You’ve done well with this particular trade, but you need to know about some
trading mistakes that you want to avoid, including the following:
 Becoming impatient with your stops. Impatience can get you out of a big
win faster than necessary. After you’ve made a big profit, the natural ten-
dency is to tighten your stops too fast. That’s where using a trailing stop
will help you. If you set it at 5 percent and leave it alone, the market will
take care of the position, meaning that a 5-percent move will stop you
out automatically.
 Forgetting that the market has resistance near the $67 level. You can
expect increased volatility as the price of crude approaches that price,
which means that your sell stop may get hit nearer the $67 price level.
 Buying more contracts as the price closes in on resistance levels.
 Applying an options strategy to your position when the price of crude is
so close to resistance levels. Even though the trend still is in your favor,
spending money on protection may be more trouble than it’s worth.
However, if you decide to apply some kind of an option strategy at this
point, use extreme care.
 Shorting the market before it breaks to the downside. Wait for the 
breakdown.
 Bragging to your friends about how much money you’re making in the
futures market.
Reviewing Your Trade
After your trade is completed, you need to review what you did right and what
you did wrong. One way to conduct such a review is to answer these questions:
 Was this market the right one for me to trade? If you understood the
fundamentals, and you knew that the action was here, then you traded
the right market.
 Should you have bought into this market sooner? More than likely your
answer is no. In a bull market, you bought strength as the crude contract
rallied above $64.
 Did you risk the right amount? You followed your own rules by risking no
more than 10 percent of your total equity in one market, and you used the
right amount of protection as you set your stops. Best of all, you profited.
 Were you patient enough? Yes, indeed. You didn’t jump into the market
until you were convinced that the odds of a bounce back to the top of
the range were on your side. Then you waited until the trend was clearly
established before adding to your position, and you raised your stops at
a steady and patient pace.
339

Learning the Right Lessons
The trade outlined in this chapter probably is a good prototype for a beginning
trader. I tried to make it easy to relate to and used easy-to-follow indicators.
This example is as much about approach as it is about the tools traders use.
You can make trading as simple or as sophisticated as you want, but in the
end, the only thing that counts is whether you make or lose money using
those tools.
Other books may offer different approaches, and as you gain more and more
trading experience, you’ll develop your own methods. Nevertheless, at the
end of the day, trading is all about knowing your market, setting up your
strategy, being patient, executing your trading plan, managing your position
properly through vigilance, and following your strategy as well as the market
will enable you.
Finally, remember that a two- or three-day time frame in the futures markets
can be a profitable time if you understand how to trade for short periods of
time and how to use technical analysis.

trading abilities. Rules, resources, and strategies are

T
rading is 90 percent head games and 10 percent money. If your head isn’t
screwed on straight, you’re going to lose a lot of money in a hurry. So in
this chapter, I help you keep the old noggin atop your shoulders by providing
you with a road map to ten of the best trading rules I’ve discovered during my
17 years of trading. These rules can help you keep your mind and money where
they’re supposed to be — between your ears and in your pocket, respectively.
Trust in Chaos
Chaos theory rules the markets. By definition, chaos is nonlinear order. In
other words, what some describe as random actually is orderly in its own
peculiar way. Look at the basic tenets of chaos, and then look at a market
chart. It isn’t hard to see a connection.
Prices follow a nonlinear order. They tend to stay within defined channels or
trading ranges. When they rise above or below the range, they enter an area
of disorder, but once they enter a new price range, they either go up, down,
or sideways, again seeking and eventually finding nonlinear order.
Big money can be made when you learn to spot the limits of chaos and the
transitions from chaos to disorder and back to chaos. By making this concept
the basis of your trading, you’ll find that working the market is much easier
than buying and holding something forever, hoping its price goes up, and much
better than having the market work you or (more precisely) work you over.

When you trade with chaos as your guide, you find it easier to accept that the
market will do whatever the market wants to do and that your job is to do
your best to be on the profitable side (the right side) of the trade and to cor-
rect your mistakes as soon as you can.
Avoid Undercapitalization
If you don’t have enough money, don’t trade, period. It’s as simple as that. Many
people open futures trading accounts with $5,000 and lose half of it within a
month only to run with their tails between their legs back to something safer. I
know. That’s what happened to me the first time I tried to trade futures.
How much money do you need? Most pros say that you need $100,000 mini-
mum to open a futures trading account. If you whittle at them long enough,
they’ll come down to $20,000 to $50,000, but few will tell you that you need
anything less than $20,000.
More important is the fact that your $20,000 to $100,000 needs to be money
that you can afford to lose.
Why do you need so much money? Bluntly, it needs to last long enough for
you to endure all the bad trades until you can finally make a good trade that
makes you plenty of money.
Be smart with your money. Don’t be one of those fools who maxes out his
home equity just to be able to trade oil futures. Sure, you may get lucky and
make it work, but the odds truly are against that. You can lose your money,
and you’ll probably lose your spouse, your family, your home, and your shirt.
Be Patient
The two times when you need patience in the financial markets are when
you’re becoming a good trader and finding good trades.
The problems with today’s markets are that you have access to so much
information that you can fool yourself into believing that you must trade all
the time, and that can get you into big trouble.
In fact, trading for the thrill of it, or because you’re bored, is a recipe for dis-
aster. I can remember periods where I haven’t traded for days or weeks at a
time. These periods of market inactivity occur more often as I’ve developed
344
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

my trading skills. When I first started, I overtraded, and I paid the price for it.
Luckily, I don’t make my entire living by trading and can afford to take my
time picking and choosing the right times to trade.
Exercising this kind of patience can be to your advantage, too, because you
can pick and choose when and how you trade.
You need to take time to think about your trading life. Some tough choices
await you, and here are some important questions to ask before you jump in
to the chaotic fray:
 How much of my livelihood do I intend to make by trading futures and
options?
 How much time am I willing to put into analyzing the markets to improve
my chances of delivering profits consistently?
 How much money am I willing to spend to educate myself and obtain a
good trading setup?
 How long will I give myself to fully develop my trading talents?
 When will I trade?
Trade with the Trend
Investors are obsessed with the fundamentals. Futures trading isn’t investing;
it’s speculating, so you need to be interested in technical and fundamental
analyses. But the key here is that technical analysis tells you the direction in
which the market you’re trading is headed — how it’s trending — something
you need to know from the get-go.
When trading futures, the market trend, your time frame, your entry and exit
points, and the protection of your capital in between are all that matter. If
preservation of your capital jibes with the fundamentals of the market and
you make money, you can take a few minutes to celebrate and then go right
back to worrying about the following:
 Keeping an eye on your charts
 Following your trading rules
When trading with the trend, never lower your sell stops just because you
think that the market will turn around and you were too tight in setting them.
Likewise, when selling short, never raise your stops if the market starts going
against you.
345
Chapter 21: Ten Killer Rules to Keep You Sane and Solvent

Believe in the Charts, Not 
the Talking Heads
The ultimate truth about trading is the price action. Few sources offer a
better view of price action than price charts, especially in the fast-moving
world of the futures markets.
Opinions are numerous. Some are going to be right; some are going to be
wrong. However, the majority of commentators have their own self-interest in
mind. In other words, their goal is to look good in front of the camera or in
print so they can keep their jobs. If they traded, they wouldn’t have time to
talk so much or to write reports.
That isn’t to say that when I’m on CNBC, I won’t be giving you the benefits of
my experience, though, or that CNBC and other television channels don’t pro-
vide access to good guests and good timely information. My point is that you
always need to look at all information through the jaded eyes of a trader, and
that means looking at the market’s response to a story or an opinion and
trading on what the market is doing, not on what the story is telling you.
Remember, Diversification Is Protection
In the stock market, diversification means spreading your risk among a large
number of stocks and asset classes. Asset allocation models therefore have
become quite handy. An asset allocation model is just a way to divide your
investment portfolio and is often depicted as a pie chart. A common asset
allocation model calls for a 60-percent exposure to stocks, a 35-percent allo-
cation to bonds, and a 5-percent allocation to cash.
In the futures markets, however, diversification is different. It has more to do
with how much cash you have on hand and how you allow seasonal tendencies
of the market to affect your trading. What futures diversification boils down to
is your ability to manage your capital, your time, and your experience.
If you have more than one or two positions open at the same time in the
futures market, you may find yourself in a dilemma, because you have a hard
time keeping up with what’s happening when the markets move so fast.
The way to get around this problem is to limit the number of markets that
you trade at any one time. For some of us, it’s one, or maybe two. Much
depends on which markets you develop a knack for trading as you progress.
346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Limit Losses
Limiting your losses while trading is a simple rule that should make sense,
but it’s a rule that bears repeating.
The 5-percent rule is commonly used by traders and is easy to see and remem-
ber. Don’t risk any more than 5 percent of your trading capital on any given
position, and limit your losses to 5 percent of the value of any given trade.
Get used to limiting your losses early on in your experience so you become
disciplined in your approach to trading.
For a futures trader, a 5-percent loss is probably as much as you’ll ever want
to handle. If you’re day trading, you can use period moving averages to iden-
tify where to place your stop-loss orders.
Make it a rule never to get a margin call. You’ll sleep better.
Trade Small
Trading small goes along with limiting your losses. But above all else, trade
within your means. If you have $5,000 equity, which is way too little to think
about trading futures, you should never trade contracts that require a $5,000
margin. A bad day can wipe out your entire equity position, and you’ll soon
be getting a margin call.
For most beginning traders, trading one or two contracts at a time is a good
rule of thumb. If you’re trading crude oil, your margin is somewhere near
$4,700 per contract, which means that you need to have at least $100,000
total equity to be able to trade one contract. See the previous section about
how much to risk in any particular market. Your loss limit from that starting
point is $235, or 5 percent of $4,700. See the previous section with regard to
limiting losses to 5 percent. (Check out Chapter 3 for more about margins and
the futures markets.)
A perfect, or nearly perfect, contract for small accounts is the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange (CME) Eurodollar contract. Margins for the Eurodollar
contract tend to be less than $1,000 per contract, so you’re thus at least
closer to following the 5-percent rule.

Chapter 21: Ten Killer Rules to Keep You Sane and Solvent

Have Low Expectations
Most good traders are right a third of the time on average and half of the time
during periods when they’re hot. The way you stay in business is to manage
your money so that you cut losses short.
Good traders are masters of the low-expectations game. That’s where you
think that if you come out even or a few bucks short, it’s a good day. Pros
readily admit they tend to make a lot of trades just on either side of breaking
even. Known as scratch trades, they’re the most common experience that
you’re likely to have while trading futures and options.
Having enough money and the sense to be able to continue to trade is key.
The longer you stay in the game, the greater your chances of making the
occasional big trade.
Set Realistic Goals
After you become well funded, develop a good money-management system, and
set your expectations at the right level. The next step is to set realistic goals.
Here are a couple of ideas:
 Some pros shoot for a three-to-one reward-to-loss ratio. If you choose
this strategy, that means when things are going well, your goal is to
double your money twice over, while (of course) setting prudent stops
and managing your money correctly.
 Take profits when you’ve made 20 percent. I like to take at least partial
profits when I make 20 percent on anything. In futures trading, applying
this rule is not always possible when you have only one contract, because
commissions and fees can eat away at the profit. However, my 20-percent
rule works well in the stock market, when I’m trading several hundred
shares of stock.

More Than Ten Additional
Resources
In This Chapter
 Exploring futures and options through government and general-information Web sites
 Knowing the commodity exchanges
 Reading more books about trading
 Checking out the newsletters and magazines
I
f you’re going to trade on your own, you need some help, at least in the
way of information, so you can apply what you’ve discovered in this book
and in your newfound experiences with trading futures and options.
Literally hundreds of Web sites and publications deal with trading futures
and options. This chapter lists and describes some of the more reliable infor-
mation sources. Although the list may not be large, it is full of useful Web
sites, books, and other sources of information that can actually help you
become a better trader.
Government Web Sites
The Web sites of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC —
www.cftc.gov), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA —
www.usda.gov), and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(www.federalreserve.gov) are useful in their own ways.
 The CFTC Web site is a great resource for reviewing trading laws and
regulations and finding out what kind of recent advisory rulings have
been handed down. When laws and regulations change, your trading can
be affected. These changes can affect anything from higher fees to what
you can and can’t trade under certain circumstances.

 The USDA Web site runs the gamut from important crop and livestock
reports to vital weather information. The USDA site can be of great use
to you when you trade commodities.
 The Federal Reserve Web site offers the Fed Beige Book, a great sum-
mary of where the Fed thinks the economy has been and is headed. The
Beige Book is the Fed’s roadmap for interest rates, and it sets the stage
for much of the action in the bond and stock markets.
General Investment Information 
Web Sites
In this section, I list several important Web sites that can serve as libraries of
information about trading futures, options, and other securities and financial
instruments. Some of these sites require a fee; others don’t. I like them all and
visit them regularly.
 The “Economy” section of Wall Street Journal.com: This section of The
Wall Street Journal’s Web site is one of my favorites. It’s an excellent
resource for catching up on the big picture before you trade. The editor-
ial content is first class, but for a futures trader, the best part is the data
library, where you can find charts that chronicle the major economic
indicators and enable you to perform a good visual inventory of eco-
nomic activity.
 Marketwatch.com’s “Commodity Summary” (marketwatch.com):
Usually penned by commodities reporter Myra Saefong, this summary
provides a great overview of the commodities markets, usually with a
pretty heavy emphasis on oil. The best part: It’s free, but it works better
if you register.
 Reuters.com (reuters.com): Another excellent free news site, I espe-
cially like to check out Reuters early in the morning, because it offers
good summaries of the overnight markets.
 Barchart.com (barchart.com): The most complete Web-based charting
service, Barchart.com offers real-time data to subscribers, but its delayed
data and charting are excellent for beginners who are trying to get a grip
on the knowledge part of trading before they move on to the real thing.
 CandlesExplained.com (candlesexplained.com): This free site is
from Greg Morris, the author of Candlestick Charting Explained (McGraw-
Hill). It’s a good site for anyone who wants an online review or a quick
reference to candlestick charting beyond what is available here in
Futures & Options For Dummies.
350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Commodity Exchanges
The Web sites of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME — www.cme.com),
the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT — www.cbot.com), and the New York
Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX — www.nymex.com) are excellent resources,
especially for beginning traders.
All three exchanges provide excellent overviews of the commodities that
trade within their jurisdictions, margin requirements, and delayed charting.
Trading Books
Very few high-quality trading books about the futures and options markets
are available, given the public’s major interest in stocks. Here is a good sam-
pling of some of the better books that I’ve run across:
 Trading Commodities and Financial Futures (Financial Times-Prentice
Hall, 2005) is written by George Kleinman, an author with a pure trader’s
mind-set. It offers an excellent step-by-step guide into the analysis and
execution of trading.
 Starting Out in Futures Trading, 5th Edition, by Mark J. Powers (Probus
Publishing, 1993, largely out of print) offers a trader’s point of view,
moving between an analyst’s and an academic’s perspective on the
futures markets. You can find used copies at very low prices online.
 Options as a Strategic Investment, 4th Edition, by Lawrence G. McMillan
(New York Institute of Finance, 2002), is widely accepted as the bible for
options trading. It is full of details, offers clear direction, and provides
excellent examples about which strategy is best suited for particular 
situations.
 The Murphy triad: Author John Murphy has compiled and written what
some consider a classic trilogy of technical analysis in these three tomes:
• Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets: A Comprehensive 
Guide to Trading Methods and Applications (New York Institute 
of Finance, 1999)
• Intermarket Analysis: Profiting from Global Market Relationships
(Wiley Trading, 2004)
• Technical Analysis of the Futures Markets: A Comprehensive 
Guide to Trading Methods and Applications (New York Institute of
Finance, 1983)
351
Chapter 22: More Than Ten Additional Resources

 Candlestick Charting Explained by Gregory L. Morris (McGraw-Hill, 1995)
is the easy-to-read and use bible for candlestick charting. No trader
should be without this one in his or her library.
 Technical Analysis For Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller (Wiley, 2004) is a
pretty good reference book that can be a companion to Futures &
Options For Dummies. This book offers excellent tutorials for beginners,
and it is a great book to read for building a base for more complex fare,
such as Murphy’s triad.
 Trading For Dummies by Michael Griffis and Lita Epstein (Wiley, 2004) is
another excellent entry-level book that offers the basic principles of
trading not only in great detail but also in an easy-to-digest style. This
book is great for someone who is interested in trading but isn’t quite
ready to delve into it.
 Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Edwin Lefevre (Fraser Publishing,
1980) is the classic trading book. Although it deals with the stock market
during a different era, no other book that I’ve ever read captures the
spirit of speculating better. At the heart of it, this book is about cutting
losses at small levels and letting winners run.
Newsletter and Magazine Resources
Many futures publications are available, and many of them can be accessed
on the Internet. A few, though, have been around for enough time to have
become quite reliable, including the following:
 The Hightower Report (www.futures-research.com): As Fred
Sanford of Sanford & Son used to say, “This is the big one, Elizabeth.”
The Hightower Report is the most widely circulated futures newsletter in
the United States, and it covers the entire futures complex.
 Consensus National Futures and Financial Weekly (www.
consensus-inc.com): This subscriber-supported service, whose major
calling card is its weekly sentiment index, provides a poll of bullish and
bearish investors on all commodities and futures, from interest rates to
energy and livestock.
 Futures Magazine: The name says it all; it’s the monthly bible of the
industry covering all aspects of the trade.
 Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities (www.traders.com):
This magazine is written by traders, and it’s where I got my start as a
writer and an analyst. It’s a good resource to scan regularly for good
trading ideas.
 Active Trader: Similar to Technical Analysis of Stocks and Commodities,
this publication tends to offer more about short-term trading.
