Preface
Book 1 of the CRC Press Comprehensive Dictionary of Mathematics covers analysis, calculus, and
differential equations broadly, with overlap into differential geometry, algebraic geometry, topology,
and other related fields. The authorship is by 15 mathematicians, active in teaching and research,
including the editor.
Because it is a dictionary and not an encyclopedia, definitions are only occasionally accompanied
by a discussion or example. Because it is a dictionary of mathematics, the primary goal has been to
define each term rigorously. The derivation of a term is almost never attempted.
The dictionary is written to be a useful reference for a readership which includes students, scien-
tists, and engineers with a wide range of backgrounds, as well as specialists in areas of analysis and
differential equations and mathematicians in related fields. Therefore, the definitions are intended
to be accessible, as well as rigorous. To be sure, the degree of accessibility may depend upon the
individual term, in a dictionary with terms ranging from Albanese variety to z intercept.
Occasionally a term must be omitted because it is archaic. Care was takenwhen such circumstances
arose because an archaic term may not be obsolete. An example of an archaic term deemed to be
obsolete, and hence not included, is right line. This term was used throughout a turn-of-the-century
analytic geometry textbook we needed to consult, but it was not defined there. Finally, reference to
a contemporary English language dictionary yielded straight line as a synonym for right line.
The authors are grateful to the series editor, Stanley Gibilisco, for dealing with our seemingly
endless procedural questions and to Nora Konopka, for always acting efficiently and cheerfully with
 
CRC Press liaison matters.

Abel summability
A series ∞
j=0 a j is
Abel summable to A if the power series
f (z) =
∞

j=0
a jz j
converges for |z| < 1 and
lim
x→1−0 f (x) = A.
Abel’s Continuity Theorem
See Abel’s
Theorem.
Abel’s integral equation
The equation
 x
a
u(t)
(x −t)α dt = f (x),
where 0 < α < 1, a ≤x ≤b and the given
function f (x) is C1 with f (a) = 0. A con-
tinuous solution u(x) is sought.
Abel’s problem
A wire is bent into a pla-
nar curve and a bead of mass m slides down
the wire from initial point (x, y). Let T (y)
denote the time of descent, as a function of the
initial height y. Abel’s mechanical problem
is to determine the shape of the wire, given
T (y). The problem leads to Abel’s integral
equation:
1
√2g
 y
0
f (v)
√y −v dv = T (y).
The special case where T (y) is constant leads
to the tautochrone.
Abel’s Theorem
Suppose the power se-
ries ∞
j=0 a j x j has radius of convergence R
and that ∞
j=0 a j R j < ∞, then the original
series converges uniformly on [0, R].
A consequence is that convergence of
the series  a j to the limit L implies Abel
summability of the series to L.
Abelian differential
An assignment of a
meromorphic function f to each local co-
ordinate z on a Riemann surface, such that
f (z)dz is invariantly deﬁned. Also mero-
morphic differential.
Sometimes, analytic differentials are call-
ed Abelian differentials of the ﬁrst kind,
meromorphic differentials with only singu-
larities of order ≥2 are called Abelian dif-
ferentials of the second kind, and the term
Abelian differential of the third kind is used
for all other Abelian differentials.
Abelian function
An inverse function of
an Abelian integral. Abelian functions have
two variables and four periods. They are a
generalization of elliptic functions, and are
also called hyperelliptic functions. See also
Abelian integral, elliptic function.
Abelian integral
(1.) An integral of the
form
 x
0
dt
√P(t),
where P(t) is a polynomial of degree > 4.
They are also called hyperelliptic integrals.
See also Abelian function, elliptic integral
of the ﬁrst kind.
(2.) An integral of the form

R(x, y)dx,
where R(x, y) is a rational function and
where y is one of the roots of the equation
F(x, y) = 0, of an algebraic curve.
Abelian theorems
Any theorems stat-
ing that convergence of a series or integral
implies summability, with respect to some
summability method. See Abel’s Theorem,
for example.
abscissa
The ﬁrst or x-coordinate, when
a point in the plane is written in rectangu-
lar coordinates. The second or y-coordinate
is called the ordinate. Thus, for the point
(x, y), x is the abscissa and y is the ordinate.
The abscissa is the horizontal distance of a
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

point from the y-axis and the ordinate is the
vertical distance from the x-axis.
abscissa of absolute convergence
The
unique real number σa such that the Dirichlet
series
∞

j=1
a je−λ js
(where 0 < λ1 < λ2 · · · →∞) converges
absolutely for ℜs > σa, and fails to converge
absolutely for ℜs < σa. If the Dirichlet se-
ries converges for all s, then the abscissa of
absolute convergence σa = −∞and if the
Dirichlet series never converges absolutely,
σa = ∞. The vertical line ℜs = σa is called
the axis of absolute convergence.
abscissa of boundedness
The unique real
number σb such that the sum f (s) of the
Dirichlet series
f (s) =
∞

j=1
a je−λ js
(where 0 < λ1 < λ2 · · · →∞) is bounded
for ℜs ≥σb +δ but not for ℜs ≥σb −δ, for
every δ > 0.
abscissa of convergence
(1.) The unique
real number σc such that the Dirichlet series
∞

j=1
a je−λ js
(where 0 < λ1 < λ2 · · · →∞) converges
for ℜs > σc and diverges for ℜs < σc. If the
Dirichlet series converges for all s, then the
abscissa of convergence σc = −∞, and if the
Dirichlet series never converges, σc = ∞.
The vertical line ℜs = σc is called the axis
of convergence.
(2.) A number σ such that the Laplace trans-
form of a measure converges for ℜz > σ and
does not converge in ℜz > σ −ϵ, for any
ϵ > 0. The line ℜz = σ is called the axis of
convergence.
abscissa of regularity
The greatest lower
bound σr of the real numbers σ ′ such that
the function f (s) represented by the Dirichlet
series
f (s) =
∞

j=1
a je−λ js
(where 0 < λ1 < λ2 · · · →∞) is regu-
lar in the half plane ℜs > σ ′. Also called
abscissa of holomorphy. The vertical line
ℜs = σr is called the axis of regularity. It is
possible that the abscissa of regularity is ac-
tually less than the abscissa of convergence.
This is true, for example, for the Dirichlet se-
ries (−1) j j−s, which converges only for
ℜs > 0; but the corresponding function f (s)
is entire.
abscissa of uniform convergence
The
unique real number σu such that the Dirichlet
series
∞

j=1
a je−λ js
(where 0 < λ1 < λ2 · · · →∞) converges
uniformly for ℜs ≥σu + δ but not for ℜs ≥
σu −δ, for every δ > 0.
absolute continuity
(1.) For a real val-
ued function f (x) on an interval [a, b], the
property that, for every ϵ > 0, there is a
δ > 0 such that, if {(a j, b j)} are intervals
contained in [a, b], with (b j −a j) < δ
then  | f (b j) −f (a j)| < ϵ.
(2.) For two measures µ and ν, absolute
continuity of µ with respect to ν (written
µ << ν) means that whenever E is a ν-
measurable set with ν(E) = 0, E is µ-
measurable and µ(E) = 0.
absolute continuity in the restricted sense
Let E ⊂R, let F(x) be a real-valued
function whose domain contains E. We say
that F is absolutely continuous in the re-
stricted sense on E if, for every ϵ > 0
there is a δ > 0 such that for every se-
quence {[an, bn]} of non-overlapping inter-
vals whose endpoints belong to E, 
n(bn −
an) < δ implies that 
n O{F; [an, bn]} <
ϵ. Here, O{F; [an, bn]} denotes the oscil-
lation of the function F in [an, bn], i.e., the
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

difference between the least upper bound and
the greatest lower bound of the values as-
sumed by F(x) on [an, bn].
absolute convergence
(1.) For an inﬁnite
series ∞
n=1 a j, the ﬁniteness of ∞
j=1 |a j|.
(2.) For an integral

S
f (x)dx,
the ﬁniteness of

solute curvature (ﬁrst, or absolute geodesic
curvature) of the regular arc C described by
n parametric equations
xi = xi(t)
(t1 ≤t ≤t2)
at the point (x1, x2, . . . , xn).
absolute maximum

image of a function f (x) on a set S, such
that f (x) ≤M, for all x ∈S.
absolute minimum
A number m, in the
image of a function f (x) on a set S, such that
f (x) ≥m for all x ∈S.
absolute value
For a real number a, the
absolute value is |a| = a, if a ≥0 and |a| =
−a if a < 0. For a complex number ζ =
a + bi, |ζ| =
√
a2 + b2. Geometrically, it
represents the distance from 0 ∈C. Also
called amplitude, modulus.
absolutely continuous spectrum
See
spectral theorem.
absolutely convex set
A subset of a vector
space over R or C that is both convex and
balanced. See convex set, balanced set.
absolutely integrable function
See abso-
lute convergence (for integrals).
absorb
For two subsets A, B of a topolog-
ical vector space X, A is said to absorb B if,
for some nonzero scalar α,
B ⊂αA = {αx : x ∈A}.
absorbing
A subset M of a topological
vector space X over R or C, such that, for
any x ∈X, αx ∈M, for some α > 0.
abstract Cauchy problem
Given a closed
unbounded operator T and a vector v in the
domain of T , the abstract Cauchy problem
is to ﬁnd a function f mapping [0, ∞) into
the domain of T such that f ′(t) = T f and
f (0) = v.
abstract space
A formal system deﬁned
in terms of geometric axioms. Objects in
the space, such as lines and points, are left
undeﬁned. Examples include abstract vector
spaces, Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces,
and topological spaces.

of a particle in space, as a function of time.

accretive operator
A linear operator T on
a domain D in a Hilbert space H such that
ℜ(T x, x) ≥0, for x ∈D. By deﬁnition, T
is accretive if and only if −T is dissipative.
accumulation point
Let S be a subset of
a topological space X. A point x ∈X is an
accumulation point of S if every neighbor-
hood of x contains inﬁnitely many points of
E\{x}.
Sometimes the deﬁnition is modiﬁed, by
replacing “inﬁnitely many points” by “a
point.”
addition formula
A functional equation
involving the sum of functions or variables.
For example, the property of the exponential
function:
ea · eb = ea+b.
additivity for contours
If an arc γ is
subdivided into ﬁnitely many subarcs, γ =
γ1 + . . . + γn, then the contour integral of a
function f (z) over γ satisﬁes

tinuous functions. The adjoint differential

where Mg is the operator of multiplication
by g. The adjoint differential equation of
L f = 0 is, therefore, L+ f = 0.
For a system of differential equations, the
functions {a j} are replaced by matrices of
functions and each ¯a j above is replaced by
the conjugate-transpose matrix.
adjoint operator
For a linear operator T
on a domain D in a Hilbert space H, the ad-
joint domain is the set D∗⊂H of all y ∈H
such that there exists z ∈H satisfying
(T x, y) = (x, z),
for all x ∈D. The adjoint operator T ∗of
T is the linear operator, with domain D∗,
deﬁned by T ∗y = z, for y ∈D∗, as above.

nection on B, that is, a choice {Hb}b∈B, of
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

subspaces Hb ⊂Bb, for every b ∈B, such
that
(i.) Bb = Hb + Vb (direct sum) where Vb is
the tangent space at b to the ﬁber through b;
(ii.) Hbg = g∗(Hb), for g ∈GL(n, R); and
(iii.) Hb depends differentiably on b.
afﬁne coordinates
Projective space Pn
is the set of lines in Cn+1 passing through
the origin. Afﬁne coordinates in Pn can be
chosen in each patch U j = {[(x0, x1, . . .,
xn)] : x j ̸= 0} (where [(x1, x2, . . . , xn)] de-
notes the line through 0, containing the point
(x0, x1, . . . , xn)). If z
= [(z0, . . . , zn)],
with z j ̸= 0, the afﬁne coordinates of z are
(z0/z j, . . . , z j−1/z j, z j+1/z j, . . . , zn/z j).
Also called nonhomogeneous coordinates.

sion.
afﬁne diffeomorphism
A diffeomorphism
q of n-dimensional manifolds induces maps
of their tangent spaces and, thereby, a
GL(n, R)-equivariant
diffeomorphism
of
their frame bundles. If each frame bundle
carries a connection and the induced map of
frame bundles carries one connection to the
other, then q is called an afﬁne diffeomor-
phism, relative to the given connections.
afﬁne differential geometry
The study of
properties invariant under the group of afﬁne
transformations. (The general linear group.)
afﬁne length
Let X be an afﬁne space,
V a singular metric vector space and k a
ﬁeld of characteristic different from 2. Then
(X, V, k) is a metric afﬁne space with metric
deﬁned as follows. If x and y are points in X,
the unique vector A of V such that Ax = y
is denoted by
−→
x, y. The square afﬁne length
(distance) between points x and y of X is the
scalar
−→
x, y 2.
If (X, V, R) is Euclidean space,
−→
x, y 2 ≥
0 and the Euclidean distance between the
points x and y is the nonnegative square root

−→
x, y 2. In this case, the square distance is
the square of the Euclidean distance. One
always prefers to work with the distance it-
self rather than the square distance, but this is
rarely possible. For instance, in the Lorentz
plane
−→
x, y
2 may be negative and, there-
fore, there is no real number whose square
is
−→

afﬁne minimal surface

exists j ∈{1, 2, . . . , 5} and, for any R > 0,
a simply connected domain D ⊂{z ∈C :
|z| > R} such that f (z) is a conformal map
of D onto A j. If f (z) has a ﬁnite number of

algebra of differential forms
Let M be
a differentiable manifold of class Cr(r ≥
1), Tp(M) its tangent space, T ∗
p (M)
=
Tp(M)∗the dual vector space (the linear
mappings from Tp(M) into R) and T ∗(M) =
∪p∈MT ∗
p (M). The bundle of i-forms is
∧i(T ∗(M)) = ∪p∈M ∧i (T ∗
p (M)),
where, for any linear map f : V

between two vector spaces, the linear map
∧i f : ∧i V →∧iW

···∧f (vk). The bundle projection is deﬁned
by π(z) = p, for z ∈∧i(T ∗
p (M)).
A differential i-form or differential form of
degree i is a section of the bundle of i-forms;
that is, a continuous map
s : M →∧i(T ∗(M))
with π(s(p)) = p. If Di(M) denotes the

are sometimes called ﬁelds and σ-ﬁelds of
sets.
algebraic analysis
The study of mathe-
matical objects which, while of an analytic
nature, involve manipulations and character-
izations which are algebraic, as opposed to
inequalities and estimates. An example is
the study of algebras of operators on a Hilbert
space.

of a complex (or real) variable, which satis-
ﬁes a polynomial equation

where a0(z), . . . , an(z) are polynomials.

tion about points in a measure space). For ex-
ample, a sequence of functions { fn(x)} con-
verges almost everywhere to f (x), provided
that fn(x) →f (x) for x ∈E, where the
complement of E has measure 0. Abbrevi-
ations are a.e. and p.p. (from the French
presque partout).

f (x) on
(−∞, ∞) such that, for every ϵ > 0, there is
a p = p(ϵ) > 0 such that, in every interval
of the form (t, t + p), there is at least one
number τ such that | f (x + τ) −f (x)| ≤ϵ,
for −∞< x < ∞.

For
a complex-valued function f (g) on a group
G, let fs : G × G
→C be deﬁned by
fs(g, h) = f (gsh). Then f is said to be
almost periodic if the family of functions
{ fs(g, h) : s ∈G} is totally bounded with
respect to the uniform norm on the complex-
valued functions on G × G.

group
On a (locally compact, Abelian)
group G, the uniform limit of trigonometric
polynomials on G. A trigonometric polyno-
mial is a ﬁnite linear combination of char-
acters (i.e., homomorphisms into the multi-
plicative group of complex numbers of mod-
ulus 1) on G.
alpha capacity
A ﬁnancial measure giving
the difference between a fund’s actual return
and its expected level of performance, given
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

its level of risk (as measured by the beta ca-
pacity). A positive alpha capacity indicates
that the fund has performed better than ex-
pected based on its beta capacity whereas a
negative alpha indicates poorer performance.

amplitude function
For a normal lattice,
let e1, e2, e3 denote the stationary values of
the Weierstrass ℘-function and, for i
=
1, 2, 3, let fi(u) be the square root of ℘−ei,
whose leading term at the origin is u−1. Two
of the Jacobi-Glaisher functions are
csu = f1, snu = 1/f2,
which are labeled in analogy with the trigono-
metric functions, on account of the relation
sn2u+cs2u = 1. As a further part of the
analogy, the amplitude, am u, of u, is deﬁned
to be the angle whose sine and cosine are snu
and csu.
amplitude in polar coordinates
In polar
coordinates, a point in the plane R2 is written
(r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin
and θ ∈[0, 2π) is the angle the line segment
(from the origin to the point) makes with the
positive real axis. The angle θ is called the
amplitude.

number A is the amplitude.
analysis
A branch of mathematics that
can be considered the foundation of calcu-
lus, arising out of the work of mathematicians
such as Cauchy and Riemann to formalize the
differential and integral calculus of Newton
and Leibniz. Analysis encompasses such top-
ics as limits, continuity, differentiation, inte-
gration, measure theory, and approximation
by sequences and series, in the context of
metric or more general topological spaces.
Branches of analysis include real analysis,
complex analysis, and functional analysis.

unbounded component of the complement of
K. Let A(K) denote the set of functions f,
analytic on (K), such that f (∞) = 0 and
∥f ∥(K) ≤1. If K is not compact, A(K) is
the union of A(E) for E compact and E ⊂
K. The analytic capacity of a planar set E is
γ (E) =
sup

| f ′(∞)|.
If K is compact, there is a unique function
f ∈A(K) such that f ′(∞) = γ (K). This
function f is called the Ahlfors function of

rect analytic continuation of a function g(z),
analytic on an open disk B, provided the
disks A and B have nonempty intersection
and f (z) = g(z) in A ∩B.
We say

uation of g(z) if there is a ﬁnite se-
quence of functions f1, f2, . . . , fn, analytic
in disks A1, A2, . . . , An, respectively, such
that f1(z) = f (z) in A ∩A1, fn(z) = g(z)

is a direct analytic continuation of f j(z).

Sup-
pose f (z) is a function, analytic in a disk D,
centered at z0, g(z) is analytic in a disk E,
centered at z1, and C is a curve with end-
points z0 and z1. We say that g is an analytic
continuation of f along C, provided there is
a sequence of disks D1, . . . , Dn, with centers
on C and an analytic function f j(z) analytic
in D j, j = 1, . . . , n, such that f1(z) = f (z)
in D = D1, fn(z) = g(z) in Dn = E and,

fold with an atlas, where compatibility of
two charts (Up, φp), (Uq, φq) means that the
composition φp ◦φ−1
q
is analytic, whenever
Up ∩Uq ̸= ∅. See atlas.
analytic neighborhood
Let P be a poly-
hedron in the PL (piecewise linear) n-
manifold M. Then an analytic neighborhood
of P in M is a polyhedron N such that (1) N
is a closed neighborhood of P in M, (2) N is
a PL n-manifold, and (3) N ↓P.
analytic polyhedron
Let W be an open set
in Cn that is homeomorphic to a ball and let
f1, . . . , fk be holomorphic on W. If the set
 = {z ∈W : | f j(z)| < 1, j = 1, . . . , k}
has its closure contained in W, then  is
called an analytic polyhedron.
analytic set
A subset A of a Polish space X
such that A = f (Z), for some Polish space Z
and some continuous function f : Z →X.
Complements of analytic sets are called
co-analytic sets.
analytic space
A topological space X (the
underlying space) together with a sheaf S,
where X is locally the zero set Z of a ﬁnite set
of analytic functions on an open set D ⊂Cn
and where the sections of S are the analytic
functions on Z. Here analytic functions on
Z (if, for example, D is a polydisk) means
functions that extend to be analytic on D.
The term complex space is used by some
authors as a synonym for analytic space.
But sometimes, it allows a bigger class of
functions as the sections of S. Thus, while
the sections of S are H(Z) = H(D)/I(Z)
(the holomorphic functions on D modulo the
ideal of functions vanishing on Z) for an
analytic space, H(Z) may be replaced by
ˆH(Z) = H(D)/ ˆI, for a complex space,
where ˆI is some other ideal of H(D) with
zero set Z.

The angle between
the tangents of two curves. See tangent line.

Let f (z) be analytic
in the unit disk D = {z : |z| < 1}. Then f
has an angular derivative f ′(ζ) at ζ ∈∂D
provided
f ′(ζ) = lim
r→1−f ′(rζ).
antiderivative
A function F(x) is an an-
tiderivative of f (x) on a set S ⊂R, provided
F is differentiable and F′(x) = f (x), on S.
Any two antiderivatives of f (x) must differ
by a constant (if S is connected) and so, if
F(x) is one antiderivative of f , then any an-
tiderivative has the form F(x)+C, for some
real constant C. The usual notation for the
most general antiderivative of f is

f (x)dx = F(x) + C.

sity point of E and F|E is differentiable at c.
The approximate derivative of F at c is the
derivative of F|E at c.
approximation
(1.) An approximation
to a number x is a number that is close to
x. More precisely, given an ϵ > 0, an ap-
proximation to x is a number y such that
|x −y| < ϵ. We usually seek an approxi-
mation to x from a speciﬁc class of numbers.
For example, we may seek an approximation
of a real number from the class of rational
numbers.
(2.) An approximation to a function f is a
function that is close to f in some appropri-
ate measure. More precisely, given an ϵ > 0,
an approximation to f is a function g such
that ∥f −g∥< ϵ for some norm ∥· ∥. We
usually seek an approximation to f from a
speciﬁc class of functions. For example, for
a continuous function f deﬁned on a closed
interval I we may seek a polynomial g such
that supx∈I | f (x) −g(x)| < ϵ.

argument function
The function arg(z) =
θ, where z is a complex number with the rep-
resentation z = reiθ, with r real and non-
negative. The choice of θ is, of course, not
unique and so arg(z) is not a function without
further restrictions such as −π < arg(z) ≤π
(principal argument) or the requirement that
it be continuous, together with a speciﬁcation
of the value at some point.

Let f (z) be analytic
on and inside a simple closed curve C ⊂C,
except for a ﬁnite number of poles inside C,
and suppose f (z) ̸= 0 on C. Then  arg f ,

arithmetic-geometric mean
The arithmet-

a0 ≡a and b0 ≡b, then iterating
an+1 = 1

converge toward each other, since

But √bn < √an, so

Now, add an −bn −2√anbn so each side

The AGM is useful in computing the values
of complete elliptic integrals and can also be

When p = 2 or p = 3, there is a modular

Propagation Theorem. If { fn(x)} is an
equicontinuous sequence of functions on

convergent on [a, b].
Selection Theorem. If { fn(x)} is a uni-
formly bounded, equicontinuous sequence
on [a, b], then there is a subsequence which
is uniformly convergent on [a, b].

asymptotic stability
Given an autonomous
differential system y′ = f (y), where f (y) is
deﬁned on a set containing y = 0 and satis-
ﬁes f (0) = 0, we say the solution y ≡0
is asymptotically stable, in the sense of Lya-
punov, if
(i.) for every ϵ > 0, there is a δϵ > 0 such
that, if |y0| < δϵ, then there is a solution
y(t) satisfying y(0) = y0 and |y(t)| < ϵ, for
t ≥0; and
(ii.) y(t) →0, as t →∞.

Whenever (i.) is satisﬁed, the solution
y ≡0 is said to be stable, in the sense of
Lyapunov.

atlas
By deﬁnition, a topological space M
is a differentiable [resp., C∞, analytic] man-
ifold if, for every point p ∈M, there is
a neighborhood Up and a homeomorphism
φp from Up into Rn. The neighborhood Up
or, sometimes, the pair (Up, φp), is called a
chart. Two charts Up, Uq are required to be
compatible; i.e., if Up ∩Uq ̸= ∅then the
functions φp ◦φ−1
q
and φq ◦φ−1
p
are differ-
entiable [resp, C∞, analytic]. The set of all
charts is called an atlas. An atlas A is com-
plete if it is maximal in the sense that if a pair
U, φ is compatible with one of the Up, φp in
A, then U belongs to A.
In the case of a differentiable [resp., C∞,
analytic] manifold with boundary, the maps
φp may map from Up to either Rn or Rn

automorphic function
A meromorphic
function f (z) satisfying f (T z) = f (z) for T
belonging to some group of linear fractional
transformations (that is, transformations of
the form T z = (az+b)/(cz+d)). When the
linear fractional transformations come from
a subgroup of the modular group, f is called
a modular function.

auxiliary circle
Suppose a central conic
has center of symmetry P and foci F and
F′, each at distance a from P. The circle of
radius a, centered at P, is called the auxiliary

axiom of continuity
One of several
axioms deﬁning the real number system
uniquely: Let{x j}be a sequence of real num-
bers such that x1 ≤x2 ≤. . . and x j ≤M
for some M and all j. Then there is a num-
ber L ≤M such that x j →L, j →∞and
x j ≤L, j = 1, 2, . . . .
This axiom, together with axioms deter-
mining addition, multiplication, and ordering
serves to deﬁne the real numbers uniquely.
axis
(1.) The Cartesian coordinates of a
point in a plane are the directed distances of
the point from a pair of intersecting lines,
each of which is referred to as an axis.
In three-dimensional space, the coordinates
are the directed distances from coordinate
planes; an axis is the intersection of a pair
of coordinate planes.
(2.) If a curve is symmetric about a line, then
that line is known as an axis of the curve. For
example, an ellipse has two axes: the major
axis, on which the foci lie, and a minor axis,
perpendicular to the major axis through the
center of the ellipse.
(3.) The axis of a surface is a line of sym-
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

metry for that surface. For example, the axis
of a right circular conical surface is the line
through the vertex and the center of the base.
The axis of a circular cylinder is the line
through the centers of the two bases.
(4.) In polar coordinates (r, θ), the polar axis
is the ray that is the initial side of the angle
θ.

Beurling’s Theorem
Every closed sub-

unit disk T which is invariant (zf ∈M, for
all f ∈M) and nontrivial (M ̸= {0} and
M ̸= H2) has the form M = BH2 = {B f :
f ∈H2}, where B is an inner function (B(z)
is analytic for |z| < 1 and |B(z)| = 1, almost
everywhere on T).
Generalizations of the theorem include
characterizations of the invariant subspaces
of L2(T) and H2
C(T), based upon a separa-
ble Hilbert space C. In both these cases, it
is necessary to take into consideration reduc-
ing subspaces of the operator of multiplica-

bifurcation equation
Given an equation
G(λ, u) = 0, where G :  × E →F, with
E and F Banach spaces and  a parame-
ter space with a bifurcation point (λ0, u0)
(see bifurcation point); an associated ﬁnite
dimensional equation, having the same solu-
tions as G(λ, u) = 0, near the point (λ0, u0).
For example, suppose λ0
=
0 and
u0(0) = 0. Let L0 = Gu(0, 0) (Fr´echet
derivative) have a kernel K of dimension n.
Let P be the projection on K commuting with
L0 and let Q = I −P. From the equation
G(λ, u) = 0 we obtain the system
QG(λ, v + w) = 0, PG(λ, v + w) = 0
where v = Pu and w = Qu. If w = w(λ, v)
is a solution of the ﬁrst of these equations
(existing by the Implicit Function Theorem
for Banach spaces), then, close to the bifur-
cation point (λ0, u0), solutions of the origi-
nal equation G(λ, u) = 0 are in one-to-one
correspondence with those of the bifurcation
equation
PG(λ, v + w(λ, v)) = 0.

Let an equation G(λ, u)

point (λ0, u0) ∈ × E is a bifurcation point
or branch point if, for some smooth curve γ

passing through (λ0, u0), there is a neigh-
borhood U of (λ0, u0) in  × E with U\γ

for c1, c2 scalars and x1, x2 ∈X, and also
satisﬁes ∥T x∥Y ≤C∥x∥X, for all x ∈X and
for some real number C.
The norm of T is the smallest such con-

brachistochrone
A wire is bent into a
planar curve from point A to point B, be-
low. The brachistochrone problem is to de-
termine the shape of the curve that will result
in the shortest time of descent. The problem
leads to a differential equation of the form
y[1 + (y′)2] = c, where y = y(x) is the curve
sought. Solving by separation of variables,
yields the solution x = a(θ −sin θ), y =
a(1 −cos θ), which are the parametric equa-
tions of a cycloid. The word brachistochrone
derives from the Greek (brachistos = shortest
+ chronos = time).
branch
Let D1 and D2 be disjoint, open,
connected sets in the complex plane C. Sup-
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

pose a function f (z), analytic in D1, can be
continued analytically along a curve, termi-
nating in D2, and that the continuation leads
to a function f1(z), analytic in D2. Then f1
is called a branch of f . The terminology is
used when different curves lead to more than
one analytic function in D2, so that f may
have several distinct branches in D2.
For example, the function
f (z)
=
log(z) = ∞
j=1(−1) j(z −1) j/j is analytic
in D1 = {z : |z −1| < 1} and continua-
tion around the two arcs of the circle z =
±eit, 0 ≤t ≤π, lead to two branches f1(z)
and f2(z), analytic in D2 = {z : |z+1| < 1},
one satisfying f1(−1) = π and the other sat-
isfying f2(−1) = −π.
When two curves around a singularity lead
to different branches, the singularity is called
a branch point or algebraic singularity. In
order to remove the multi-valued character
of an analytic function caused by a branch
point, a curve terminating in that point may
be removed from the plane. For example, for
the logarithm function, the positive imagi-
nary axis might be removed. Such a removed
curve is called a cut or barrier.
branch point
(1.) A branch point of an
analytic function. See branch.
(2.) A branch point of an equation. See bi-
furcation point.
Branges’ Theorem [deBranges’ Theorem]
Let f (z) be univalent in the unit disk and
have power series
f (z) = z + a2z2 + a3z3 + . . .
then |an| ≤n. Equality occurs for the Koebe
function f (z) = z(1−z)−2. This had been a
famous conjecture known as the Bieberbach
conjecture until proved by Louis deBranges.

Hilbert space H. Suppose that T1T2 −T2T1
is compact, T1 and T2 have the same essential
spectrum A ⊂C and T1 −λI and T2 −λI
have the same index, for λ /∈A. Then T1
is unitarily equivalent to a compact perturba-
tion of T2.
Actually, an additional hypothesis on the
set A is required (A must be homeomorphic
to a subset of a 1-complex).

The Busemann function b, corresponding to
the ray γ , is
bγ (q) = lim
t→∞[t −d(q, γ (t))].
The limit exists because the expression in

manifold which may be chosen arbitrarily in
one canonical coordinate frame.
canonical bilinear mapping
The map-
ping from the Cartesian product E × F of two
vector spaces to their tensor product, E ⊗F,
sending (x, y) to x ⊗y. See also canonical

canonical coordinate system
Let n ≥
1. Consider the vector space K n, over a
ﬁeld K, and let E1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0), E2 =
(0, 1, . . . , 0), . . ., En = (0, 0, . . . , 1). The
set {E1, . . . , En} is called the canonical ba-
sis of K n. Let V be a K-vector space, and A
an afﬁne space over V . An afﬁne system of
coordinates in the space A is given by a point
O ∈A and a basis {e1, . . . , en} of V . This
coordinate system is denoted Oe1 · · · en. If
A = An, then the afﬁne coordinate sys-
tem OE1 · · · En in which O = (0, 0, . . . , 0)
and {E1, . . . , En} is the canonical basis of
K n and is called the canonical coordinate
system. Note that in this coordinate system,
every point (x1, . . . , xn) ∈An has itself as
coordinate n-tuple.
canonical decomposition
(1.) Of a poly-
nomial: Let F be a ﬁeld and let f (X) ∈
F[X], the polynomial ring in X over F.
Then we can write
f (X) = f1(X)n1 · · · fr(X)nr
(ni ≥1),
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

where f1(X), . . . , fr(X) are distinct irre-
ducible monic polynomials uniquely deter-
mined by f (X). We then refer to the above
expression as the canonical decomposition of
f (X).
(2.) Of a vector: Any point x in a Hilbert
space E can be written uniquely as
x =

xk,
where xk ∈Ek, for orthogonal subspaces
E1, E2, . . ., of E, and the sum is convergent
(the partial sums converge in norm to x) in
E. The above relation is called the canonical
decomposition of a vector x in a Hilbert space
E. Classically, the subspaces E1, E2, . . . are
taken to be the eigenspaces for distinct eigen-
values of a self-adjoint operator on E.
canonical divisor

pact Riemann surface M having the form
D = (ω), where ω is a non-zero meromor-
phic 1-form on M. Here, D is deﬁned so that,
if Ua is an open set from a ﬁnite open cover
if M, and if, locally, ω|Ua = fa(z)dz, then
D|Ua = ( fa) =  ai pi − b jq j, where
each pi is a zero of fa of order ai and each
q j is a pole of fa of order b j.
canonical divisor class
The module
n(X) of n-dimensional regular differential
forms on an n-dimensional, smooth variety X
has dimension 1 over the algebra of polyno-
mials k(X). This implies that the divisors of
all the forms in n(X) are equivalent. The
divisor class of these equivalent divisors is
the canonical divisor class of X.
canonical model
In the study of a class of
mathematical objects, it is sometimes possi-
ble to select a special subclass, constructed in
a natural way, such that each member x in the
original class is isomorphic to some unique
member of the subclass, called the canonical
model of x.
For example, for the class of contraction
operators on Hilbert space (operators T with
∥T ∥≤1), every such T is similar to the re-
striction of the adjoint of the unilateral shift
(on a vector valued H2 space) to one of its
invariant subspaces. One can call such a re-
striction the canonical model of T .

A set of parame-
ters {pi, qi}, all of which satisfy the Poisson
bracket relations

Proceeding inductively, one can deﬁne f on
all open intervals of the form ( j
3n , j+1
3n ) and
extend the deﬁnition to all of [0, 1] by con-
tinuity. The resulting monotonic function is
continuous and nonconstant but has deriva-
tive 0 on a subset of [0, 1] of Lebesgue mea-
sure 1 (the complement of the Cantor set).
See Cantor set.
Cantor set
Generally, any perfect subset
of R which contains no segments.

maining. Next, one removes the open middle
thirds from both the intervals in E1, with E2

c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

thirds set is C = ∩∞
j=1E j. C has the addi-
tional property that it is uncountable, but has
Lebesgue measure 0.
Instead of middle thirds, one can remove
open middle segments of length δn, where
1 > δ1 > δ2 > . . ., from [0, 1]. One obtains
a perfect set containing no intervals, but it
may have positive measure, depending upon
the sequence {δn}.

G ranges over all countable families such
that G ⊂F ∩{S : diam(S) ≤δ} and

γ ≤∞we have the existence of a mea-
sure ψ(A) = limδ→0+ φδ(A) = supδ>0(A)
whenever A ⊂X. ψ is a measure on X, and

Cartesian coordinates
(1.) A point in a
plane has Cartesian coordinates (x, y) that
locate the point relative to two lines (usually
labelled the x-axis and the y-axis) that in-
tersect at a point referred to as the origin.
The axes are usually (but not necessarily)
perpendicular. The ﬁrst coordinate (the x-
coordinate, or abscissa) is the signed dis-
tance of the point from the y-axis, measured
parallel to the x-axis. The second coordinate
(the y-coordinate, or ordinate) is the signed
distance of the point from the x-axis, mea-
sured parallel to the y-axis.
(2.) A point in space has Cartesian coordi-
nates (x, y, z) that locate the point relative to
three planes (the coordinate planes) that in-
tersect at a common point (the origin). The
coordinate planes are usually (but not nec-
essarily) perpendicular. The lines of inter-
section of pairs of coordinate planes are the
coordinate axes, which are usually referred
to as the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis.
The coordinate planes can be described by
the axes they contain. For example, the y, z-
plane contains the y- and z-axes. Each co-
ordinate of a point is the signed distance of
the point from a coordinate plane, measured
parallel to a coordinate axis. For example,
the x-coordinate is the signed distance of the
point from the y, z-plane measured parallel
to the x-axis.
Cartesian plane

imposed a system of Cartesian coordinates.
Also called Euclidean plane.

al space upon which is imposed a system of
Cartesian coordinates. Also called Euclidean
space.
Cassini’s oval
The locus obtained as the
vertex of a triangle which satisﬁes the follow-
ing condition: the side opposite that vertex is
ﬁxed with length 2a, and the product of the
lengths of the sides adjacent to the vertex is a
constant b. If b > a2 then a single oval is ob-
tained. If b < a2 then two ovals are actually
obtained. If b = a2 then the curve obtained
is a lemniscate.
catenary
If an idealized weightless chain
is hung from two points that lie on a horizon-
tal line, the resulting plane curve is referred
to as a catenary. With appropriate choice of
coordinates, a catenary can be described by
the equation y = cosh x.

nary is rotated about its axis.
Cauchy condition
A sequence {an} in a
metric space such that d(am, an) →0 as
m →∞and n →∞. In other words,
for every ϵ > 0 there exists an N such that
d(am, an) < ϵ for all m > N and all n > N.
Cauchy criterion
The Cauchy criterion
for convergence of a sequence of real or com-
plex numbers is that a sequence converges if
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

and only if it is a Cauchy sequence. The
Cauchy criterion can be applied to conver-
gence of a series by checking for the conver-
gence of the sequence of partial sums of the
series. The Cauchy criterion is used to de-
ﬁne a complete metric space. By deﬁnition,
a metric space is complete if and only if all
Cauchy sequences converge.

Cayley transform
(1.) The mapping of
the extended complex plane onto itself de-
ﬁned by f (λ) = (λ −i)(λ + i)−1. This
transform maps the real line to the unit cir-
cle, with f (∞) = 1. The upper half plane
transforms to the interior of the unit circle,
and the lower half plane transforms to the
exterior of the unit circle, with f (−i) = ∞.
(2.) For a closed operator A on a Hilbert
space, the operator deﬁned by f (A) = (A −
i I)(A + i I)−1, where I is the identity oper-
ator. If A is self-adjoint, f (A) is unitary. If
A is symmetric, f (A) is isometric.
center
If a curve has symmetry about a
point, then that point is known as the center
of the curve.

ture of a curve at a point on the curve is the
center of the osculating circle at that point.

chain of simplices
Let K be a simplicial
complex and let G be an Abelian group, with
the group operation being denoted by addi-
tion. An r-dimensional chain (or r-chain) x
is deﬁned by x = g1S1+g2S2+. . .+gnSn =
n
i=1 gi Si, where each Si, for i = 1, . . . , n,
is an oriented r-dimensional simplex of K.
Replacing gi Si by −gi Si in a chain has the
same effect as reversing the orientation of the
simplex Si. The r-chains form a group under
the addition induced from the group G. G is
usually taken to be the integers or the inte-
gers modulo n, for some n ≥2; in that case
the boundary operator δ can be deﬁned. If
S is an oriented r-dimensional simplex, and
if B1, B2, . . . , Bn are the oriented (r −1)-
dimensional faces of S, then the boundary
of S is the chain δ(S) = n
i=1 ϵi Bi, where
ϵi = 1 if Bi and S are coherently oriented,
and ϵi = −1 otherwise. The boundary of the
chain x is δx = n
i=1 giδ(Si). If a chain has
a boundary equal to zero, it is called a cycle;
in particular, the boundary of any chain is a
cycle: δ(δx) = 0 for any chain x.
chain rule
(1.) If f and g are differen-
tiable functions, then the composition func-
tion h deﬁned by h(x) = f (g(x)) is dif-
ferentiable with derivative given by h′(x) =
f ′(g(x))g′(x). If we write y = f (u) and
u = g(x), then the chain rule can be written
dy
dx = dy
du

dx .
More precisely, the chain rule is valid if g is
differentiable at x = x0, if f is differentiable
at u = g(x0), and if each deleted neighbor-
hood of x0 contains points in the domain of
the composition function h.
(2.) If f is a differentiable function of several
variables u1, u2, . . . , um and if the variables
u1, u2, . . . , um are each differentiable func-
tions of several variables x1, x2, . . . , xn, then
the composition function h deﬁned by
h(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = f (u1(x1, x2, . . . , xn),

complex numbers of modulus 1, having the
properties φ(a+b) = φ(a)φ(b) and φ(0) =

characteristic
(1.) If a positive (rational)
number is written in scientiﬁc notation k·10n,
where 1 ≤k < 10 and n is an integer,
then the common logarithm of the number
is log10 k + n. The characteristic of this log-
arithm is the integer n.
(2.) If a ring has the property that there ex-
ists a positive integer n such that na = 0 for
all elements a in the ring, then the smallest
such integer is known as the characteristic of
the ring. If no such integer exists, the ring is
said to have characteristic zero. If a ring is an
integral domain with non-zero characteristic,
then the characteristic must be prime.
characteristic curves
The conjugate curves
on a surface S with the property that at every
point P of S the tangents to the curves are
the characteristic directions on S at P.
characteristic directions
At any point P
on a surface S (with the exception of umbili-
cal points) there is a unique pair of conjugate
directions that are symmetric with respect to
the lines of curvature on S through P. These
are the characteristic directions on S at P.
The angle between the characteristic direc-
tions is the minimum of the angles between
conjugate directions on S at P.
characteristic equation
Let A be a square
matrix and I the identity matrix with the same
order. If det denotes the determinant of a
matrix, then the characteristic equation of
A is det(λI −A) = 0. The roots of the
characteristic equation are the characteristic
roots, or eigenvalues, of the matrix A.
characteristic exponents
Consider the
system of differential equations dx
dt =A(t)x,
where A(t) is an n × n matrix-valued function
which is periodic with period ω. If X(t) is an
n×n matrix-valued function whose columns
form a basis for solutions for the system, then
X(t) is invertible for each t and the matrix
C = X−1(t)X(t + ω) is a constant matrix,
which can be written in the form C = eωR
for an n × n matrix R. The eigenvalues of R
are called the characteristic exponents of the
system.
characteristic function
(1.) The charac-
teristic function of a square matrix A is its
characteristic polynomial det(λI−A), where
det denotes determinant and I is the identity
matrix with the same order as A.

of a random variable, then the characteristic
function of the random variable is the func-
tion g(t) =

(3.) The characteristic function of a set A is
the function
χA(x) =



1 ifx ∈A
0 ifx /∈A.
characteristic multiplier
Consider the
system of differential equations dx
dt = A(t)x,
where A(t) is an n × n matrix-valued func-
tion which is periodic with period ω. If X(t)
is an n × n matrix-valued function whose
columns form a basis for solutions for the
system, then X(t) is invertible for each t and
the matrix C = X−1(t)X(t + ω) is a con-
stant matrix, which can be used to reduce
the system to a system with constant coefﬁ-
cients. The eigenvalues of the matrix C are
referred to as the characteristic multipliers
of the system. If the characteristic multipli-
ers are distinct, then X can be chosen so that
C is a diagonal matrix with the characteristic
multipliers on the diagonal, and the solutions
to the system can be written in terms of the
characteristic multipliers.
characteristic operator function
(1.) If
T is a contraction operator on a Hilbert space,
deﬁne QT = (I −T ∗T )1/2 and QT ∗= (I −
T T ∗)1/2. Let DT be the closure of the range
of QT , and DT ∗be the closure of the range
of QT ∗. The characteristic function for T is
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

the operator valued function
T (λ) = −T + λQT ∗(I −λT ∗)−1QT |DT .
For each complex number λ for which it is
deﬁned, the operator T (λ) is a bounded op-
erator between the Hilbert spaces DT and
DT ∗. If T is completely non-unitary, then
the characteristic operator function uniquely
determines T and can be used to construct a
functional model for T .
(2.) If T is a closed operator on a Hilbert
space, deﬁne QT = |I −T ∗T |1/2, QT ∗=
|I −T T ∗|1/2, JT = sgn(I −T ∗T ), and
JT ∗= sgn(I −T T ∗). DT and DT ∗are de-
ﬁned as above, but these are considered as
Kre˘ın spaces with indeﬁnite inner products
determined by JT and JT ∗. The characteris-
tic function for T is the operator valued func-
tion
T (λ) = −T + λQT ∗(I −λT ∗)−1QT |DT .
For each complex number λ for which it is
deﬁned, the operator T (λ) is a bounded op-
erator between the Kre˘ın spaces DT and DT ∗.
Functional models based on the characteris-
tic function have been developed only in the
case where T is uniformly bounded on the
open unit disk.
characteristic polynomial
For a square
matrix A, the polynomial det(λI −A), where
det denotes determinant and I is the identity
matrix with the same order as A.
characteristic root
A root of the charac-
teristic polynomial (of a given square ma-
trix).

tic root (or eigenvalue) of a square matrix A,
then a characteristic vector (or eigenvector)
associated with λ is any non-zero vector x
satisfying Ax = λx.

ﬁxed point (the center) in the plane.
circular cone
The solid bounded by a cir-
cular region (the base) and the line segments
joining points on the circular boundary of the
region to a ﬁxed point (the vertex) that is not
in the plane of the base. The axis of the cone
is the line through the vertex and the center
of the base. If the axis is perpendicular to the
plane of the base, the solid is a right circu-
lar cone; otherwise it is an oblique circular
cone.
circular cylinder
Consider two circles of
the same radius lying in two parallel planes,
and the line ℓjoining the centers of the circles.
A circular cylinder is the surface consisting
of the plane regions bounded by these circles
(the bases) and the line segments parallel to
ℓthat join points on one circle to points on
the other. The line ℓis the axis of the cylin-
der. If the axis is perpendicular to the planes
of the bases, the cylinder is a right circular
cylinder; otherwise it is an oblique circular
cylinder.

intersection of C1, C2 with a line L through
P. The cissoid of C1, C2 with respect to P is
the locus of a point p on such line L satisfying
Pp = P Q2 −P Q1 = Q2Q1.
classical theory of the calculus of varia-
tions
A branch of mathematics which is
a sort of generalization of calculus. Calcu-
lus of variations seeks to ﬁnd the path, curve,
surface, etc., for which a given function has
a stationary value (which, in physical prob-
lems, is usually a minimum or maximum).
Mathematically, this involves ﬁnding station-
ary values of integrals of the form
I =
 a
b
f (y, ˙y, x) dx.
I has an extremum only if the Euler–
Lagrange differential equation is satisﬁed,
i.e., only if

derivatives, then
M(x) = 0

closable operator
Let T be a linear oper-
ator with domain and range in normed linear
spaces. T is called closable if there is a linear
extension of T which is a closed operator.
closed
(1.) In a topological space, a closed
set is the complement of an open set. A set
is closed if and only if it contains all of its
accumulation points. A set is closed if and
only if it contains its boundary.
(2.) Within a topological vector space, a
closed subspace is a subspace that is also a
closed set in the topology of the space. The
adjective closed may be similarly used to de-
scribe an object contained within other struc-
tures that include a topology, such as a closed
submanifold of a topological manifold, a
closed subgroup of a topological group, etc.
(3.) A set is said to be closed with respect
to a binary operation if applying the binary
operation to any pair of members of the set
always gives a member of the set.

such that the set of points interior to γ (having
a nonzero winding number with respect to γ )
is a convex set. See closed curve, convex set.
closed convex surface
A closed surface
that is convex, in the sense that any plane
section of the surface is a convex curve.
closed curve
A curve that has no end
points. If the curve is viewed as the im-
age of an interval [a, b] under a continuous
mapping f , then it is closed if and only if
f (a) = f (b). Equivalently, a closed curve
may be viewed as the image of a circle under
a continuous mapping.
closed differential form
A differential
form ω such that dω = 0.
Closed Graph Theorem
If T is a closed
linear operator whose domain is a Banach
space and whose range is contained in a Ba-
nach space, then T is continuous. The name
of the theorem derives from the fact that T
closed is equivalent to the graph G(T ) =
{(x, T x)} being closed in the Cartesian prod-
uct of the two Banach spaces.

closed interval
The closed interval [a, b],
with −∞< a and b < ∞, is the set of all
points x on the real number line with a ≤
x ≤b. If a = −∞[resp. b = ∞], the
interval (−∞, b] = {x : −∞< x ≤b}
[resp. [a, ∞) = {x : a ≤x < ∞}] is also a
closed interval.
closed linear subspace
A closed subset of
a topological vector space V, which is closed
under the operations of vector addition and
scalar multiplication of V. See topological
vector space.
closed operator
Suppose A and B are Ba-
nach spaces. A linear operator T : A →B
is called closed if it has a closed graph. This
means that, if D is the domain of T in A, then
the set {(x, T x) : x ∈D} is a closed subspace
of the Banach space A × B. Equivalently, T
is closed if and only if the following condi-
tion holds: Suppose xn is in D for each n, xn
converges to x, and T xn converges to y; then
x ∈D and T x = y.
Closed Range Theorem
For a densely de-
ﬁned operator T on a Banach space, the range
R(T ) is closed if and only if R(T ∗) is closed.
closed surface
A surface that has no
boundary curves. A closed surface can be
characterized as a connected compact metric
space in which every point has a neighbor-
hood that is homeomorphic with the interior
of a circle.
closure
(1.) The closure of a set S is the in-
tersection of all closed sets containing S, and
is therefore the smallest closed set containing
S. The closure of S can also be described as
the union of S and the set of accumulation
points of S, or the union of S and the bound-
ary of S.
(2.) The closure of a closable operator is the
closed extension of that operator, with mini-
mal domain.

A point x is a cluster point
(or accumulation point) of a subset A of a
topological space if every neighborhood of x

for the equation, i.e., u is required to satisfy
u(x, 0) = f (x), where f is deﬁned on D and
is required to satisfy certain conditions on the

where Mi j (the minor of ai j) is the determi-
nant of the matrix obtained by deleting row i

can be expanded by the elements of row i and
their cofactors by det(A) = n

Similarly, the determinant can be expanded

Let S be an oriented
n-dimensional simplex with an ordered set
of vertices (p0 p1 . . . pn), and let B be an ori-
ented (n −1)-dimensional face of S. The
vertices of B will then consist of the ver-

and B are said to be coherently oriented if
the orientation of B is given by the order
of its vertices (up to an even permutation)
(pi+1 pi+2 . . . pn p0 . . . pi−1).

be the group of r-dimensional cocycles of
K and let Hr be the group whose elements
are cycles that are either zero or cobound-

Since ∇maps (r −1)-dimensional chains to

A diagram is a
conﬁguration of three or more sets with maps
between the sets. The diagram is commu-
tative if, whenever there are two composi-
tions mapping one of the sets A to another
set B, those two compositions are equal.
Thus, we may have sets A, B, C and maps
α : A →B, β : B →C, γ : A →C. This
produces two maps, β ◦α and γ , mapping
A to C. Commutativity requires that they be
equal.

bound has a least upper bound. For exam-
ple, the real numbers are a complete ordered
ﬁeld.

ric space that every Cauchy sequence in the

are equivalent.

completion
(1.) If a ﬁeld has a minimal
extension that is algebraically complete, then
that extension is called an algebraic comple-
tion of the ﬁeld. For example, the complex

(2.) Let X be a uniform topological space.
Then there is a complete uniform space X∗
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

and a uniform isomorphism f from X to a
dense subset of X∗. Such a pair ( f, X∗) is
known as a completion of X. If X is a Haus-
dorff uniform space, then it has a Hausdorff
completion that is unique up to uniform iso-
morphism. In particular, a metric space X
has a unique completion to a metric space
X∗. The completion can be identiﬁed with
a space of equivalence classes of Cauchy se-
quences, where two Cauchy sequences {xn}
and {yn} are equivalent if xn −yn →0 as

ﬁned by (a+bi)+(c+di) = (a+c)+(b+d)i
and (a+bi)(c+di) = (ac−bd)+(ad+bc)i.

See conic section.
conic section
A curve obtained as the in-
tersection of a plane with a right circular con-
ical surface. Depending on the orientation
of this plane, the conic section obtained is a
circle, ellipse, hyperbola, parabola, or (if the
vertex of the conical surface lies in the plane)
a degenerate conic section—a point, a line,
or a pair of intersecting lines.
Any conic section can be described in
Cartesian coordinates by an algebraic equa-
tion of degree two in two variables. Con-
versely, any such equation which has a real
solution has as its graph a conic section (pos-
sibly degenerate).
A conic section can also be described as
the locus of a point such that the ratio of its
distance to a ﬁxed point (the focus) and its
distance from a ﬁxed line (the directrix) is a
constant (the eccentricity e). The curve ob-
tained is an ellipse if 0 < e < 1, a parabola
if e = 1, or a hyperbola if e > 1. By conven-
tion, the eccentricity of a circle is taken to be
e = 0. In polar coordinates, with the focus
at the origin and with a horizontal or vertical
directrix at a distance d from the focus, the
equation of a conic takes one of the forms
r =
de
1 ± e cos θ ,r =
de
1 ± e sin θ .
conical surface
The surface formed by the
union of the lines passing through a ﬁxed
point (the vertex) and intersecting a ﬁxed
curve (the directrix). Each of these lines is
called a generator of the surface. A circu-
lar conical surface is one that has a directrix
which is a circle. The axis of a circular con-
ical surface is the line through the center of
this circle and the vertex. A circular conical
surface is called right if the axis is perpen-
dicular to the plane containing the directrix.

uation) and the distance from z to z0 times
the distance from w to z0 equals r2. By ex-
tension, z and w are conjugate points with

covariance
Given n sets of random vari-
ables denoted {x1}, . . . , {xn}, a quantity
called the covariance matrix is deﬁned by
Vi j = cov(xi, x j)
≡⟨(xi −µi)(x j −µ j)⟩
= ⟨xi x j⟩−⟨xi⟩⟨x j⟩,
where µi = ⟨xi⟩and µ j = ⟨x j⟩are the
means of xi and x j, respectively. An indi-
vidual element Vi j of the covariance matrix
is called the covariance of the two random
variables xi and x j, and provides a measure of
how strongly correlated these variables are.
In fact, the derived quantity
cor(xi, x j) ≡cov(xi, x j)
σiσ j
,
where σi, σ j are the standard derivations, is
called the correlation of xi and x j. Note that
if xi and x j are taken from the same set of
random variables (say, x), then
cov(x, x) = ⟨x2⟩−⟨x⟩2 = var(x),
giving the usual variance var(x). The covari-
ance is also symmetric since
cov(x, y) = cov(y, x).
For two variables, the covariance is related
to the variance by
var(x + y) = var(x) + var(y) + 2 cov(x, y).
For two independent random variables x =
xi and y = x j,
cov(x, y) = ⟨xy⟩−µxµy
= ⟨x⟩⟨y⟩−µxµy = 0,
so the covariance is zero. However, if the
variables are correlated in some way, then
their covariance will be nonzero. In fact, if
cov(x, y) > 0, then y tends to increase as x
increases. If cov(x, y) < 0, then y tends to
decrease as x increases.
The covariance obeys the identity
cov(x + z, y) = ⟨(x + z)y −⟨x + z⟩⟨y⟩⟩
= ⟨xy⟩+ ⟨zy⟩−⟨⟨x⟩+ ⟨z⟩⟩⟨y⟩
= ⟨xy⟩−⟨x⟩⟨y⟩+ ⟨zy⟩−⟨z⟩⟨y⟩
= cov(x, y) + cov(z, y).
By induction, it therefore follows that

that γ (0) = p and γ ′(0) = v, and let w(t)

normal projection vector of (dw/dt)(0) onto
the tangent plane to S at p.

curvature
(1.) A measure of how sharply

C in two- or three-dimensional Euclidean
space that is traced out by a vector function
r(t). Let s(t) represent arc length and let
T(t) = r′(t)/∥r′(t)∥be the unit tangent vec-
tor for the curve. The curvature κ of C is de-
ﬁned as κ = ∥dT/ds∥. (The vector dT/ds is
said to be the curvature vector.) In particular,
if the curve is the graph in two-dimensional
space of y = g(x), then κ =
|y′′|
[1+y′2]3/2 .
(2.) A measure of the manner in which
a surface bends. Consider a point p on a
smooth surface S in three-dimensional Eu-
clidean space, and let n be a normal vector
to the surface at p. For each plane that is
through p and parallel to n, the intersection
of the plane with S is a curve, called a nor-
mal section. For each normal section, put
k = ±κ, where κ is the curvature of the
normal section and the plus is chosen if the
curvature vector points in the same direction
as n while the minus is chosen if the curva-
ture vector points in the opposite direction.
The principal curvatures, k1 and k2, at p are
by deﬁnition the extreme values of the set
of all values of k. The Gaussian curvature
is G = k1k2; the mean curvature is said by
some to be H = k1 + k2, while others say

whose ﬁrst derivatives are solutions of a cer-
tain equation of order n −1.

Denjoy integrable function
See Denjoy
integral.
Denjoy integral
A function f : [a, b] →
R is Denjoy integrable provided there exists
a function F : [a, b] →R, which is of gen-
eralized absolute continuity in the restricted
sense and such that F′ = f , almost every-
where on [a, b]. See generalized absolute
continuity in the restricted sense.
The Denjoy integral of f over [a, b] is
F(b) −F(a). See Denjoy-Lusin Theorem.
Denjoy integral in the restricted sense
Construct a transﬁnite sequence (of the type
 + 1) of more and more general integrals
which we call Dξ-integrals, and which we
denote by
(Dξ)
 b
a
f (x) dx
(1)
for a function f (x) deﬁned on the closed in-
terval [a, b].
The integrals (1) are deﬁned inductively.
Namely,
(D0)
 b
a
f (x) dx
is to be understood as simply the Lebesgue
integral
(L)
 b
a
f (x) dx.
We shall now assume that we have deﬁned
integrals (1) for all ξ < η, where η ≤. If
η is a number of the ﬁrst kind and η−1 is its
immediate predecessor, then, setting
b
T
a
( f ) = (Dη−1)
 b
a
f (x) dx,
we deﬁne the integral Dη by means of the
formula
(Dη)
 b
a
f (x) dx =
b
T∗
a
( f ).
But if η is a number of the second kind,
then we include in the class of functions
which are Dη-integrable on the closed inter-
val [a, b] all functions f (x) which are Dξ-
integrable on this segment for at least one
ξ < η, and we set, by deﬁnition,
(Dη)
 b
a
f (x) dx = (Dξ0)
 b
a
f (x) dx,
where ξ0 is the smallest of these ξ. Thus, if
η is a number of the second kind, then the
class of functions which are Dη-integrable
is the set-theoretic sum (over all ξ < η) of
classes of Dξ-integrable functions. There-
fore the deﬁnition of the integrals (1) which
we have just given can be written in terms of
the following symbolic relations:
D0 = L,
Dη = (Dη−1)∗,
Dη =

ξ<η
Dξ,
where the second relation must be used if η
is a number of the ﬁrst kind and the third if η
is of the second kind.
In particular, taking ξ = , we arrive at
the Denjoy integral in the restricted sense.
The Denjoy integral in the restricted sense
of the function f (x), deﬁned on the closed
interval [a, b], is the integral
(D)
 b
a
f (x) dx.
(2)
This integral is called the Denjoy–Perron
integral. Instead of the notation (2), it is usu-
ally denoted by
(D)
 b
a
f (x) dx.
Using the same notation as above, we can
write the formula
D =

ξ<
Dξ,
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

so that every function which is Denjoy-
integrable is also Dξ-integrable for some
ξ <  and if the smallest of these ξ is ξ0,
then

f (x) dx = (Dξ0)

Denjoy integral in the wide sense
Sup-
pose
b
T
a
( f ) is an arbitrary given integral. We
shall construct a generalization,
b
T
a
∗( f ).
Namely, we include in the class T ∗([a, b])
every function f (x) which is deﬁned on
[a, b] and satisﬁes the following four con-
ditions:
1) the set ST = ST ( f ; [a, b]) is nowhere
dense and f (x) is not Lebesgue-summable
on ST ;
2) if {(an, bn)} is the set of intervals com-
plementary to ST , then the limit
In = lim
β
T
α
( f )
(an < α < β < bn, α →an, β →bn)
exists and is ﬁnite for every n;
3) the inequality

n
|In| < +∞
(1)
holds;
4) if there are an inﬁnite number of inter-
vals (an, bn) and
Wn = sup |
β
T
α
( f )|
(an < α < β < bn),
then
lim Wn = 0.
(2)
We see that the difference between the
deﬁnitions of the classes T ∗([a, b]) and
T∗([a, b]) consists in replacing the single re-
quirement

n
Wn < +∞
(3)
by the two requirements (1) and (2). Since
|In| ≪Wn, (1) and (2) follow from (3), from
which we have
T∗([a, b]) ⊂T ∗([a, b]).
It follows from this, in particular, that
the classes T ∗([a, b]) are non-void. We can
show that the system of these classes is legi-
timate.
Having introduced the classes T ∗([a, b]),
we can deﬁne a functional
b
T
a
∗on each of
them by associating the number
b
T
a
∗( f ) =

n
In + (L)

ST
f (x) dx
with each f ∈T ∗([a, b]).
This integral is constructed with the aid
of the integral T ∗, in exactly the same way
that the integral in the restricted sense was
constructed with the aid of T∗.
Namely, we introduce the transﬁnite (of
type  + 1) sequence of integrals
(Dξ)
 b
a
f (x) dx,
(4)
deﬁned by induction. For ξ = 0, integral (4)
is simply the Lebesgue integral. If integrals
(4) have been deﬁned for all ξ < η, where
η ≤, then we set
Dη = (Dη−1)∗
for all η of the ﬁrst kind and we set
Dη =

ξ<η
Dξ
for η of the second kind.
The integral
D =

ξ<
Dξ
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

is the Denjoy integral in the wide sense.
It can be proved that the Denjoy integral
in the wide sense is more general than the
Denjoy integral in the restricted sense. More-
over, we have in general that the integral Dξ
is more general than Dξ for arbitrary ξ ≤.

differential operator
A linear opera-
tor, between two vector spaces of func-
tions, whose action consists of taking cer-
tain derivatives and multiplying by certain
functions. A differential operator may not
be bounded and, hence, may be deﬁned only
on a proper subspace (the domain). For ex-
ample, a differential operator on an L2 space
usually has only functions with appropriate
degrees of differentiability in its domain.
differential-difference
equation
Any
equation which approximates a system of
ordinary differential equations by replacing
each space derivative by a difference op-
erator, in the manner of (for example) the
Runge–Kutta methods.
differentiation
The process of taking the
derivative of a function. See derivative. Of-
ten the evaluation of the limit in the deﬁnition
of derivative can be avoided, with the use of
certain rules of differentiation. Examples of
such rules are
d
dx xn = nxn−1, d
dx log x = 1

on a Hilbert space H, an operator L : H′ →
H′ on a Hilbert space H′ ⊃H, such that
T nx = PLnx, for n = 1, 2, . . . and for x ∈
H, where P is the orthogonal projection of
H′ on H. See unitary dilation.
dilation theorem
Any theorem asserting
the existence of a dilation of a particular type,
for certain classes of operators on Hilbert
space. See dilation. For example, B. Sz.-
Nagy proved that any contraction operator
(operator of norm ≤1) has a unitary dila-
tion, which is unique, if certain minimality
conditions are satisﬁed.
dimension
(1.) For a vector space, the
number of elements in a basis, when a ba-
sis with a ﬁnite number of elements exists,
is called the dimension of the vector space.
When no such basis exists, we say the vector
space is inﬁnite dimensional.
(2.) For a manifold M which, by deﬁnition,
must be locally homeomorphic to a Euclid-
ian space Rn, the dimension is the number n.
A manifold which is locally homeomorphic
to an inﬁnite dimensional vector space (such
as a Banach manifold) is said to be inﬁnite
dimensional.

sor D on an irreducible, projective variety
X, let L(D) denote the vector space consist-
ing of the function 0 and all nonzero rational
functions f on X such that ( f )+ D is effec-
tive. (See effective divisor.) The dimension
of L(D) is called the dimension of the divisor
D. The dimension is invariant under equiva-
lence of divisors and so can be deﬁned to be
the dimension of the divisor class of D.

direct method in the calculus of variations
Any method for maximizing or minimiz-
ing a given deﬁnite integral
I =

a
F[y(x), y′(x), x] dx
which attempts to approximate the desired
function y(x) successively by a sequence of
functions u1(x), u2(x), . . . selected so as to
satisfy the boundary conditions imposed on
y(x). Each function ur(x) is taken to be a dif-
ferentiable function of x and of r parameters
cr1, cr2, . . . , crr. The latter are then chosen
so as to maximize or minimize the function
Ir(cr1, cr2, . . . , crr)

solution y(x) obtained in this manner as the
limit of a sequence of approximating func-
tions, still needs to be proved to maximize
or minimize the deﬁnite integral.
Analogous methods of solution apply to
variational problems involving more than one
unknown function and/or more than one in-
dependent variable. If accessory conditions
are given, they are made to apply to each ap-
proximating function; the approximating in-
tegrals may then be maximized or minimized
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

by the Lagrange-multiplier method. Direct
methods can yield numerical approximations
and/or exact solutions. Note also that every
direct method for the solution of a variation
problem is also an approximation method for
solving differential equations.
The Rayleigh–Ritz is another direct meth-
od in the calculus of variations.

The union of two algebraic
structures A and B, inheriting the algebraic
properties of A and B, but with no interaction

with addition and scalar multiplication de-
ﬁned by (a1, b1)+(a2, b2) = (a1 +a2, b1 +

A relationship between
two variables x and y of the form y = kx,
where k is a constant, known as the constant
of variation (or constant of proportionality).
In this case, we say that y varies directly as

numbers are used for points on the other side
of the origin.

a sign, positive or negative. In a geomet-
ric context, a number with a negative sign

there are two numbers p1 and p2 whose quo-

(If p1/p2 is real and rational, then f (z) is a

du Bois Reymond problem
The du Bois
Reymond problem asks whether the Fourier
series of a continuous function converges
almost everywhere. P. du Bois Reymond
showed in 1876 that there is a continuous
function whose Fourier series diverges at a
point. In 1966 L. Carleson showed that the
Fourier series of an L2 function converges
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

almost everywhere, thus answering the prob-
lem in the afﬁrmative. R.A. Hunt later (1967)
showed that the Fourier series of an L p func-

where.

with f ∈Y ′, the dual space of Y, and g ∈X′,
the dual space of X, satisfying the equation
(T x, f ) = (x, g) identically for x ∈D(T ).
Since g is uniquely determined by f , deﬁne
g = T ′ f . Then T ′ is a linear operator called
the dual operator (or conjugate operator) of
T . This is an extension of the notion of trans-
pose of a matrix in matrix theory.
dual space
Let V be a vector space over
the ﬁeld F. The space L(V, F) of all lin-
ear transformations from V into F (the so-
called linear functionals of V ) is called the

x = 0, and
2. if B(x, y) = 0 for all x ∈E, then
y = 0.

eccentric angle
The parameter in the para-
metric forms for the equations of ellipses
and hyperbolas. For the ellipse x2/a2 +
y2/b2 = 1 with parametrization x = a cos θ,
y = b sin θ, θ is called the eccentric angle
of a point (x, y) on the ellipse. Similarly,
for the hyperbola, x2/a2 −y2/b2 = 1 with
parametrization x = a sec θ, y = b tan θ, θ
is called the eccentric angle of (x, y).
eccentricity
A conic section can be de-
ﬁned as the set of all points P in the plane
such that the ratio of the undirected distance
of P from a ﬁxed point (the focus) to the undi-
rected distance of P from a ﬁxed line (the di-
rectrix) that does not contain the ﬁxed point
is a positive constant, denoted e. The con-
stant e is called the eccentricity of the conic
section. It can be shown that if e = 1, the
conic is a parabola, if 0 < e < 1, it is an
ellipse, and if e > 1, it is a hyperbola. (If
e = 0, the conic section is actually a circle.)
For an ellipse and a hyperbola, the eccentric-
ity can be deﬁned as the ratio of the distances
between the foci and the length of the major
axis. See also conic section.

α(k) is called the co-echelon space,
where the superscript λ× denotes the dual,
that is, the set of sequences (x j) for which
 λ j x j < ∞, for all (λ j) ∈λ. The echelon
space corresponding to (α(k)) is the intersec-

Edge of the Wedge Theorem
A theo-
rem on analytic continuation for functions
of several complex variables. Let S be an
open cone in Rn (i.e., an open set such that
y ∈S ⇒ty ∈S, for every positive t) and let
V be the intersection of S with an open ball,
centered at 0 ∈Rn. For E ∈Rn a nonempty
set, let W + = E +iV, W −= E −iV ⊂Cn.
The sets W ± are the wedges and E is the
edge. One version of the Edge of the Wedge
Theorem states:
There is an open set  ⊂Cn, which con-
tains W + ∪E ∪W −with the property that
every f (z), continuous on W + ∪E ∪W −
and holomorphic on W + ∪W −has an ana-
lytic continuation into .

plicities λ1, . . . , λr.
eigenfunction
Let T be a linear operator
on a vector space V over the ﬁeld F. If c is
an eigenvalue for T , then any vector v ∈V
such that T v = cv is called an eigenfunc-
tion of T associated with the scalar c. Also
eigenvector, characteristic vector.
eigenfunction expansion
This is a tech-
nique for the solution of a linear differential
equation (either ordinary or partial) with lin-
ear boundary conditions for which a com-
plete set of eigenfunctions which satisfy the
boundary conditions are known. The solu-
tion function, if sufﬁciently smooth, can be
expanded as an inﬁnite series in the eigen-
functions with unknown coefﬁcients. From
the given equation and the boundary condi-
tions, equations can then be determined for
the unknown coefﬁcients. (See also eigen-
function.)

eigenvalue
Let T be a linear operator on
a vector space V over the ﬁeld F. A scalar
c in F is an eigenvalue for T if there is a
non-zero vector v in V such that T v = cv.
Eigenvalues are also known as characteristic
values, proper values, spectral values, and
latent roots.
eigenvalue problem
Given a linear opera-
tor L(·), with boundary conditions B(·) there
will sometimes exist non-trivial solutions to
the equation L[y] = λy. When such a solu-
tion exists, the value of λ is called an eigen-
value. Finding such solutions is called the
eigenvalue problem. (Note: The solutions
may or may not be required to also satisfy
B[y] = 0.)

Here m is the dimension of the space and c is
a smooth function bounded away from zero.
In applications, c is the speed of the wave, and
the surfaces r(x1, · · ·, xm) = const. are the
wave fronts. The rays are the characteristics
of the eikonal equation.
The mathematical theory of geometrical
optics can be regarded as the theory of the
eikonal equation. The solution of the eikonal
equation may have singularities. Their the-
ory is part of that of the singularities of dif-
ferentiable mappings.

elementary function
A function which
belongs to the class of functions consist-
ing of the polynomials (see also polyno-
mial function), the exponential functions
(see also exponential function), the logarith-
mic functions (see also logarithmic func-
tion), the trigonometric functions (see also
trigonometric function), the inverse trigono-
metric functions (see also inverse trigono-
metric function), and the functions obtained
from those listed by the four arithmetic oper-
ations and/or by composition, applied ﬁnitely
many times. This class of functions occurs
most frequently in mathematics, but so do
functions which are not elementary. For ex-
ample, while the derivative of an elementary
function is also an elementary function, the
indeﬁnite integral or antiderivative of an ele-
mentary function cannot always be expressed
as an elementary function. As a speciﬁc ex-
ample, consider

ex2dx,
which is the antiderivative of an elementary
function but is not itself elementary.
elementary function of class n
An alge-
braic function of a ﬁnite number of com-
plex variables is called an elementary func-
tion of class 0. The functions ez and log z are
by deﬁnition elementary functions of class
1. Inductively, assuming elementary func-
tions of class at most n −1 have been de-
ﬁned, deﬁne elementary functions of class n
as follows: let g(t) and g j(w1, . . . , wn) (1 ≤
j ≤m) be elementary functions of class at
most 1 and f (z1, .., zm) be an elementary
function of class at most n −1. Then the
composite functions g( f (z1, . . . , zm)) and
f (g1(w1, . . . wn), . . . , gm(w1, . . . , wn)) are
called elementary functions of class at most
n. An elementary function of class at most n
which is not of class at most n −1 is called
an elementary function of class n.
elementary set
The Cartesian product of
intervals (open, closed or semi-open) in Rn.
ellipse
A planar curve, one of the so-called
conic sections (see also conic section), ob-
tained by the intersection of a double-mapped
right circular cone with a plane which is not
parallel to any generator of the cone and does
not pass through the vertex. (A circle is a spe-
cial case of the ellipse, in which the cutting
plane is also perpendicular to the axis of the
cone.) An ellipse may also be deﬁned as the
locus of points in the plane, the sum of
whose distances from two ﬁxed points, F1
and F2, is a constant. Each such point is
called a focus. In an ellipse, the distance be-
tween the foci is called the focal distance
and is usually denoted by 2c. The midpoint
of the line segment joining the two foci is
called the center of the ellipse. The line on
which the foci lie is called the major (or
ﬁrst) axis, and the line through the center of
the ellipse perpendicular to the major axis is
called the minor (or second) axis. Using this
deﬁnition it is possible to derive equations
for the standard ellipses centered at (h, k). If
the principal axis is horizontal, the equation
is
(x −h)2
a2
+ (y −k)2
b2
= 1, a > b.
If the principal axis is vertical, the equation
is

ellipsoid
A type of quadric surface (i.e.,
the graph in three-space of a second degree
equation in three variables). The standard
form for an ellipsoid centered at (0, 0, 0) is
x2
a2 + y2
b2 + z2
c2 = 1,
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

where a, b, and c are positive. Note that if
z is zero, the resulting cross section of the
ellipsoid in the xy plane is the ellipse
x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1.
The cross section of the ellipsoid with the
plane z = k yields the equation
x2
a2 + y2
b2 = 1 −k2
c2 .
In this case, if |k| < c, the resulting cross
section is a planar ellipse and the lengths of
its semiaxes decrease to 0 as |k| increases to
the value c. If |k| = c, the intersection of the
plane z = k with the ellipsoid is the single
point (0, 0, k). If |k| > c, there is no inter-
section. Similar cross sections result if we
consider intersections by planes parallel to
either of the other two axes. The numbers a,
b, and c are the lengths of the semiaxes of the
ellipsoid. If any two of these three numbers
are equal, we have an ellipsoid of revolution,
also known as a spheroid.

if e1 > e2 > e3, they can be labeled so as to
satisfy the inequalities
ρ ≥e1 ≥σ ≥e2 ≥γ ≥e3.
The surfaces ρ = constant, σ = constant,
and γ

boloids of one sheet, and hyperboloids of
two sheets respectively. Cartesian coordi-
nates are expressed in terms of ellipsoidal
coordinates by the equations

ellipsoid F and a point X(x, y, z) not in the
principal plane, construct three more quadric
surfaces, F′, F′′, and F′′′ with the properties
that they are confocal, pass through X, inter-
sect each other, and are mutually perpendic-
ular. One is an ellipsoid, one is a hyperboloid
of one sheet, and one is a hyperboloid of two
sheets. Let k1, k2, and k3 be the values of
the parameter k in the equation above cor-
responding to these three surfaces. The pa-
rameters k1, k2, and k3 are called the elliptic
coordinates of the point X. The coordinates

essential singularity
If a complex func-
tion f (z) is analytic in a region 0 < |z−a| <
δ, then z = a is called an isolated singular-
ity of f (z). An isolated singularity z = a
such that limz→a |z −a|α| f (z)| is neither 0
nor ∞for any α is called an essential sin-
gularity. Thus, in the neighborhood of an es-
sential singularity f (z) is at the same time
unbounded and comes arbitrarily close to 0.
essential spectrum
For a linear operator
T on a complex, normed vector space X, the
set of complex numbers λ such that one of
the following fails to hold.
(1.) the operator λI −T has a ﬁnite dimen-
sional null space (kernel);
(2.) the range (image) of the operator λI −T
is a closed subspace of ﬁnite codimension in
X. See Fredholm operator.
For a self-adjoint operator on Hilbert
space, the essential spectrum is the set of
limit points of the spectrum, together with
the eigenvalues of inﬁnite multiplicity.
essential supremum
Let
f
be a µ-
essentially bounded function with domain S,
i.e., there is a µ-null set N such that the re-
striction of f to S\N is bounded. The quan-
tity
inf
N sup
s∈S
| f (s)|,
where N ranges over the µ-null subsets of
S is called the µ-essential supremum of
| f (·)| or the µ-essential least upper bound
of | f (·)|.
essentially bounded function
Let µ be
an additive set function deﬁned on a ﬁeld of
subsets of a set S. A subset N of S is said
to be a µ-null set if v∗(µ, N) = 0, where
v∗is the extension of the total variation v of
µ. A function f deﬁned on S is said to be
µ-essentially bounded, or simply essentially
bounded, if there is a µ-null set N such that
the restriction of f to S\N is bounded.
essentially self-adjoint operator
A lin-
ear operator whose least closed linear exten-
sion is self-adjoint. See closed operator. See
also self-adjoint operator.
Euler formula
There are several formu-
las attributed to Leonhard Euler. Euler’s for-
mula for complex numbers is
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ.
Euler’s formula for polyhedra is
V −E + F = 2,
where V = the number of vertices, E = the
number of edges, and F = the number of
faces in the polyhedron. The formulas for the
Fourier coefﬁcients of a periodic function of
period 2π (see Fourier series) are also some-
times referred to as Euler’s formulas.

Euler transform
To obtain solutions of a
linear differential equation
L[u] + µu = 0
in the form of an integral representation, the
method of integral transforms is often use-
ful. In place of the unknown function u(z)
we introduce a new unknown function v(ζ)
of the complex variable ζ = ξ +iν by means
of an equation
u(z) =

C
K(z, ζ)v(ζ)dζ,
where the transformation kernel K(z, ζ) (as-
sumed analytic in each complex variable)
and the path of integration C are to be suit-
ably determined. The differential equation
then takes the form

C
(L[K] + µK)v(ζ)dζ = 0,
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

where here the differentiation process L
refers to the variable z and it is assumed that
the process L is interchangeable with inte-
gration. K may be speciﬁed by subjecting
it to a suitable partial differential equation,
and various kernels are used in practice. The
kernel
K(z, ζ) = (z −ζ)α
produces the Euler transform if the path
of integration is suitably chosen. See also
Laplace transform.
Euler’s angles
Suppose we have two rect-
angular coordinate systems, (x′, y′, z′) and
(x, y, z), sharing the same origin. The cor-
relation of the two is given by Euler’s an-
gles (θ, φ, ψ), where θ is the angle between
the z axis and the z′ axis, φ is the angle be-
tween the zx-plane and the zz′-plane, and ψ
is the angle between the z′x′-plane and the
z′z-plane. These angles are subject to the in-
equalities 0 < θ < π, and 0 < φ, ψ < 2π
and are used in the dynamics of rigid bodies.

named for the Swiss mathematician Leon-

a sequence of rational numbers whose limit
is x. In most cases, a is taken to be the con-
stant e, deﬁned as

This irrational constant has the approximate
value 2.718281829. (See also exponential

For z = x + iy a complex number, the

exterior algebra
The algebra of the exte-
rior product, also called an alternating alge-
bra or Grassmann algebra. The study of exte-
rior algebra is also called ausdehnungslehre
or extensions calculus. Exterior algebras are
graded algebras.
In particular, the exterior algebra of a vec-
tor space is the direct sum over k = 1, 2, . . .,
of the vector spaces of alternating k-forms
on that vector space. The product on this al-
gebra is then the wedge product of forms.
The exterior algebra for a vector space V is
constructed by forming monomials u, v ∧w,
x ∧y ∧z, etc., where u, v, w, x, y, and z are

for n ≥2 with compact boundary S. The
classical Dirichlet problem is the problem of
ﬁnding a harmonic function in D that as-

is called an exterior problem. (See also inte-
rior problem, Dirichlet problem.)
exterior product
For ω and θ differential
forms of degree r and s respectively, the ex-
terior product ω ∧θ is the differential form
of degree r + s deﬁned by
(ω ∧θ)p = ωp ∧θp,
p ∈M, where M is an n-dimensional topo-

i1 < i2 < . . . < ir, j1 < j2 < , . . . , < js and
sgn(i; j) means the sign of the permutation
(1, 2, . . . ,r + s) →(i1, . . . , ir, j1, . . . , js).
Note that if ω1, ω2, . . . ωr are differential
forms of degree 1, then

factor analysis
A data reduction technique
which builds a model from data. The tech-
nique ﬁnds underlying factors, also called la-
tent variables and provides models for these
factors based on variables in the data. For ex-
ample, suppose a market research survey is
given, which asks the importance of 9 prod-
uct attributes. Suppose also that three under-
lying factors are found. The variables which
load highly on these factors give some in-
formation about what these factors might be.
For example, if three attributes such as tech-
nical support, customer service, and avail-
ability of training courses all load highly on
one factor, one might call this factor service.
This technique can be very helpful in
ﬁnding important underlying characteristics,
which might not themselves be observed, but
which might be found as manifestations of
variables which are observed. Another good
application of factor analysis is for group-
ing together products based on a similarity
of buying patterns. By using factor analy-
sis one might locate opportunities for cross-
selling and bundling.
The factor analysis model is similar to
a multivariate model, but several of the as-
sumptions are changed. It is assumed that
each observation vector yi has E(yi) = µ
and Cov(yi) = ϵ. For n observations, the
factor analysis model is
Y = µ′ + X B + e,
where Y is n×q and X is n×r. The assump-
tions about the rows of e are: E(ϵi) = 0,
Cov(ϵi, ϵ j) = 0, i ̸= j and Cov(ϵi) = A,
with A diagonal. Each row of X is assumed
to be an unobservable random vector with
E(xi) = 0, Cov(xi, x j) = 0, i
̸=
j,
Cov(xi) = Ir, and Cov(xi, ϵ j) = 0 and i, j.
The matrix B remains a ﬁxed but unknown
matrix of parameters. The coefﬁcients of
matrix B are called the factor loadings.
See also factor score, factor loading.
factor loading

ysis model can be written for the value of
variable j for individual i as
z ji =
m

p=1
a jpFpi + d jU ji,
i = 1, 2, . . . , N, j = 1, 2, . . . , n. In this
expression, Fpi is the value of a common
factor p for an individual i, and each of
the m terms a jpFpi represents the contribu-
tion of the corresponding factor to the linear
composite, while d jU ji is the residual error
in the theoretical representation of the ob-
served measurement z ji. The common fac-
tors account for the correlations among the
variables, while each unique factor accounts
for the remaining variance (including error)
of that variable. The coefﬁcients of the fac-
tors are called factor loadings.
factor of automorphy
Let X be a com-
plex analytic manifold and  a discontin-
uous group of (complex) analytic automor-
phisms of X. A set of holomorphic func-
tions (without zeros) on X, { jγ (z), γ ∈},
is called a factor of automorphy if it satisﬁes
the condition jγ γ ′(z) = jγ (γ ′(z)) jγ (z) for
all γ, γ ′ ∈, and z ∈X.

isotropy µt of En+1 onto En+1 such that µ0

(i.) µt | (En+1 −(Ti × E1)) = 1,
(ii.) µt changes (n + 1)st coordinates less
than ϵ, and

Then,

obtained up to renormalization, from the

whether the line enters or leaves the diagram

ﬁeld
A nonempty set F with binary opera-
tions + and · deﬁned on it, is said to be a ﬁeld
if the following axioms are satisﬁed. (1.) The
Associative Laws: a +(b +c) = (a +b)+c
and a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c for all a, b, c ∈F.
(2.) The Commutative Laws: a + b = b + a
and a · b = b · a for all a, b ∈F. (3.) The
Distributive Law: a ·(b+c) = a ·b+a ·c for
all a, b, c ∈F. (4.) Existence of an Additive
Identity: there is an element 0 ∈F satisfying
a + 0 = a for all a ∈F. (5.) Existence of
a Multiplicative Identity: there is an element
1 ∈F, 1 ̸= 0, satisfying a · 1 = a for all
a ∈F. (6.) Existence of Additive Inverses:
for each element a ∈F, there is an element
−a ∈F satisfying a + (−a) = 0. (7.) Ex-
istence of Multiplicative Inverses: for each
element a ∈F, a ̸= 0, there is an element
a−1 ∈F satisfying a · a−1 = 1. For exam-
ple, the set of all real numbers R with usual
addition + and multiplication · is a ﬁeld.
ﬁeld of scalars

set S such that if E, F ∈F, then (i.) E ∪F ∈
F, (ii.) E\F ∈F, and (iii.) S\F ∈F. If F
is also closed under the taking of countable
unions, then F is called a σ-ﬁeld. Fields and
σ-ﬁelds of sets are sometimes called alge-
bras and σ-algebras of sets, respectively.

F in X is a family of subsets of X satisfy-
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

ing (1.) the empty set is not a member of F,
(2.) the intersection of any two members of
F is a member of F, and (3.) any subset of
X which contains a member of F is a mem-
ber of F.
ﬁlter base
Let X be a nonempty set and
F, a ﬁlter in X. A family B of subsets of X
is a base for the ﬁlter F if F = { f : f ⊂X
and b ⊂f for some b ∈B}.
ﬁnal set

operator. The ﬁnal set of a partial isometric
operator V is also called the ﬁnal space of
V . See partially isometric operator.

generation) asserts that a point x is in the
convex hull of a set S if and only if x is in
the convex hull of a ﬁnite subset of S.
Finiteness Theorem

vector ﬁeld on the real plane has a ﬁnite
number of limit cycles. This is the Finiteness
Theorem for limit cycles.
(2.) Let R be a compact Riemann surface
and  be the sheaf of holomorphic func-
tions on R. The ﬁrst cohomology group
H1(R, ) is a ﬁnite dimensional complex
vector space. This is the Finiteness Theorem
for compact Riemann surface. The dimen-
sion of H1(R, ) is called the genus of R.
Finsler manifold
A Cr Banach manifold
M is a Finsler manifold if for every p ∈M,
there is a norm ∥· ∥p deﬁned on the tangent
space Tp(M) such that ∥· ∥p is continuous
in p.
Finsler metric
Let M be an n-dimensional
manifold, T (M) be the tangent bundle of M,
Tp(M) be the tangent space at p ∈M, and
X p ∈Tp(M). A Finsler metric on M is a
function F : T (M) →[0, ∞) satisfying
(1.) F is continuous; (2.) for every p ∈M,
F(X p) = 0 if and only if X p = Op, where
Op is the zero vector of Tp(M); (3.) for every
p ∈M, every vector X p ∈Tp(M) and every
complex number α, F(αX p) = |α|F(X p).
Finsler space
A differentiable manifold
M with a Finsler metric F deﬁned on it is
called a Finsler space.
ﬁrst category

cal space is of the ﬁrst category if E is the
countable union of nowhere dense sets.
ﬁrst Cousin problem
Let  be a domain
in Cn and {Gα : α ∈%} be an open cover of
. For each α ∈%, let there be given a mero-
morphic function fα deﬁned on Gα such that
for any α, β ∈%, the difference fα −fβ is
analytic in Gα ∩Gβ. Find a meromorphic
function f deﬁned on  such that f −fα is
analytic in Gα for all α ∈%. This is called
the ﬁrst Cousin (Pierre Cousin, 1867–1933)
problem. A domain  for which the prob-
lem can be solved is called a Cousin domain
of the ﬁrst kind. For example, any domain 
in Cn for which the Cauchy-Riemann equa-
tions on  can be solved is a Cousin domain
of the ﬁrst kind. In particular, any polydisk
in Cn is a Cousin domain of the ﬁrst kind.
ﬁrst fundamental form
Let F be an arbi-
trary smooth function of the three Cartesian
coordinates. Deﬁne a surface S to be the set
of all solutions of an equation
F(x, y, z) = 0.
(1)
Restricting the Euclidean metric of the em-
bedding space R3 to S, we obtain an expres-
sion for the square of the arc element, namely
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2. If we substitute the
deﬁning equations x = x(u, v); y = y(u, v);
z = z(u, v) (x, y, z smooth), equation (1) re-
duces to a homogeneous second degree poly-
nomial P in the coordinate differentials du
and dv. P so constructed is called the ﬁrst
fundamental form. See fundamental form.

ﬁrst-order derivative
Let f : D →R
be a function with domain D ⊂R . We
say f (t) is differentiable at t if f (t) is de-
ﬁned in a neighborhood of t and the limit
f ′(t) = lim
h→0
f (t+h)−f (t)
h
exists. The func-
tion f ′(t) deﬁned for those t for which the
limit exists is called the ﬁrst-order derivative
of f (t). The ﬁrst-order derivative of f (t)
is usually called the derivative or the ﬁrst
derivative of f (t).
ﬂabby resolution
Let S be a sheaf (of
Abelian groups) over a topological space. A
resolution of the sheaf S is an exact sequence
0 →S →S1 →S2 →· · ·, where each Si,
i = 1, 2, 3, . . . is a sheaf. The resolution is
a ﬂabby resolution if each sheaf Si in the se-
quence is ﬂabby.
ﬂat function
A function f (t) is said to be
ﬂat at t0 if it is inﬁnitely differentiable at t0
and its derivatives of all orders at t0 are 0.
That is, f (n)(t0) = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2 . . ..
In other words, if f (t) is ﬂat at t0, then its
formal Taylor expansion at t0 vanishes. A
function is a ﬂat function if it is ﬂat at a
point of its domain. For example, the func-
tion f (t) = e−1/t for t > 0 and f (t) = 0
for t ≤0 is a ﬂat function for it is ﬂat at 0.
ﬂat point
Let M be a surface and p ∈
M a point on M. The point p is a ﬂat (or
planar) point if both principal curvatures at
p are zero.
Floquet’s Theorem
Let y′ = A(t)y be a
homogeneous, ﬁrst-order system of n linear
differential equations in which the coefﬁcient
matrix A(t) is periodic of period p (A(t +
p) = A(t)). Any fundamental matrix Y(t)
of the system can be expressed as Y(t) =
B(t)eCt, where C is an n × n constant ma-
trix, and B(t) is periodic of period p.
ﬂux

ﬁned on an oriented surface S with a contin-
uous unit normal vector n in R3. The ﬂux φ

point F is not on the line L. For any point
P in the plane, let d(P, L) be the (perpen-
dicular) distance between P and L, and let
d(P, F) be the distance between P and F.
A conic is the set of all points P in the plane
satisfying d(P,L)
d(P,F) = e. The conic is called a
parabola, if e = 1; an ellipse, if 0 < e < 1;
and a hyperbola, if e > 1. The ﬁxed point F
is called a focus of the conic.

See foliation.
foliation
Let M ⊆Cn be a real Ck mani-
fold. A foliation  of M is a set of complex
submanifolds of M and a Ck map ρ : M →
Rq such that

everywhere on M,
(2.)  = {ρ−1(S) : S ⊂Rq}, and
(3.) each member of  has the same dimen-
sion, as a submanifold of Cn.

Fourier Integral Theorem
Let f (t) be
an absolutely integrable function on the en-
tire real line. If f (t) is piecewise smooth on

Frechet derivative
Let X and Y be Ba-

said to be Frechet differentiable at p if there
is a bounded linear operator L : X →Y
such that lim

c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

operator L is usually denoted dF|p and is
called the Frechet derivative of F at p. If
F is Frechet differentiable at p, then its
Frechet derivative is unique. For example,
let X = Rn, Y
= Rm and F(x) = y,
where x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈Rnand y =
(y1, y2, . . . , ym) ∈Rm. If F is Frechet dif-
ferentiable at p, then all ﬁrst-order partial
derivatives ∂yi/∂x j (i = 1, 2, . . . , m and
j = 1, 2, . . . n) exist at p, and dF|p has the
m × n matrix whose i j-entry is the value of
∂yi/∂x j at p.
Frechet distance
Let C be a curve and
z be a point in the complex plane. The
distance d(z, C) between z and C is de-
ﬁned by d(z, C) = inf{|z −w| : w ∈

the complex plane. The Frechet distance
DF(C1, C2) between the curves C1 and C2
is deﬁned by DF(C1, C2) = sup{d(z, C2) :
z ∈C1}. Frechet distance DF possesses
the following properties: (1.) DF(C1, C2) ≥
0; (2.) DF(C1, C2)

C1 = C2; (3.) DF(C1, C2) = DF(C2, C1);

Fredholm operator
A bounded linear op-
erator T : X →Y from a Banach space X
to a Banach space Y such that: (1) the range

dimension of the kernel kerT of T is ﬁnite,
and (3) the dimension of the kernel kerT ′ of
T ′, the Banach space adjoint of T , is ﬁnite. If
X and Y are Hilbert spaces, then the opera-
tor T ′ in (3) is to be replaced by the operator
T ∗, the Hilbert space adjoint of T .
Fredholm’s Alternative Theorem
Let
T : X →X be a compact operator on a
Banach space X, λ ̸= 0, a nonzero complex
number, and A = T −λI. Then, the operator
A is a Fredholm operator, and the dimension
of the kernel kerA of A and the dimension
of the kernel kerA′of A′ are equal. In other
words, the operator A is a Fredholm opera-
tor and either ranA = X and kerA = {0}, or
ranA ̸= X and kerA ̸= {0}. If X is a Hilbert
space, then the operator A′ is to be replaced

Fuchs relation
Consider the second-order
linear homogeneous differential equation
y′′ + p(z)y′ + q(z)y = 0. Assume that the
equation has only isolated regular singular
points at z1, z2, . . . , zn and ∞. The Fuchs
relation states that
n
i=0
(αi + βi) = n −1,
where α0 and β0 are the roots of the indicial
equation at ∞, and αi and βi are the roots of
the indicial equation at zi, i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
function
For two sets X and Y, a subset G
of X ×Y, with the properties (1) (x, y1) ∈G
and (x, y2) ∈G imply y1 = y2 and (2) for
every x ∈X, there is y ∈Y such that
(x, y) ∈G. Instead of the set G, a function
f : X →Y is usually thought of as the rule
that assigns x to y, where (x, y) ∈G, and
one writes f (x) = y.
function element
A pair ( f, D) where D
is an open disk (or region) in the complex
plane and f is an analytic function on D.

tion f (z) whose argument z is a complex
number.

terval [a, b], for which there is a positive
constant C such that

function of class Cr
Let r be a positive
integer. A function f of a single variable is
of class Cr if it is r times continuously dif-
ferentiable. If f is a function of several vari-
ables, then it is of class Cr if all of its partial
derivatives up to and including order r exist
and are continuous. This class of functions
is also denoted by the symbol Cr.

dowed with a topology. For example, the

set G with the compact-open topology is a
function space.

the ﬁeld F. A functional f on V is a function
(usually linear) from V to F.

matical analysis which studies the analytical

functional calculus
A formula or deﬁni-
tion for taking functions of an operator or
class of operators on Hilbert space. Strictly
speaking, a multiplicative homomorphism of
an algebra of functions into the operators
from a Hilbert space to itself, sending the
function f (z) = z to a given operator.
For a bounded operator T , with spectrum
K and the class of functions analytic in a
neighborhood of K, one may deﬁne a func-
tional calculus by deﬁning
f (T ) =
1
2πi

C
(λI −T )−1dλ,
where C is a simple closed curve with K in
its interior (Dunford calculus).
For a self-adjoint operator T , with spec-
tral resolution E(λ), and the bounded mea-
surable functions on R, one may deﬁne
f (T ) =
 ∞
−∞
f (λ)dE(λ).
A similar construction works for any normal
operator (Von Neumann calculus).
For a completely nonunitary contraction
operator T , one may use the minimal unitary
dilation U to deﬁne f (T ), for f (z) analytic
and bounded in |z| < 1, by
f (T ) = P f (U).
(Sz.-Nagy-Foias calculus).
functional differential equation
A dif-
ferential equation which depends on the past
state of its variable. For example, let t0 > 0
be a ﬁxed positive constant. The differential
equation
dy(t)
dt
= F(t, y(t), y(t −t0)) is a
functional differential equation for it depends
on the past state y(t −t0) of the variable y.
functional equation
A relation satisﬁed
by a function. For example, the functional
equation f (x + λ) = f (x) expressing peri-
odicity of f (x).
functional model
A structure, including a
function space, with which an abstract math-
ematical object is realized. For example, if
N is a normal operator on a separable Hilbert
space H, then there is a ﬁnite measure space
(X, µ) and a function ϕ ∈L∞(X, µ) such
that N is unitarily equivalent to the multi-
plication operator Mϕ on L2(X, µ) deﬁned
by Mϕ f = ϕf . Thus, the functional model
{Mϕ, L2(X, µ)} is a realization (through
unitary equivalence) of the pair {N, H}.
functional value
A value of a function f ;
thus, each element of the range of the func-
tion f .
fundamental form

Finsler metric F, with Hessian Gab: the form
 = iGα ¯βdzα ∧dzβ
on ˜M, the tangent bundle minus the 0-section
of a real ﬁnite-dimensional manifold M.
fundamental invariant (for an equiva-
lence relation)
Let E be an equivalence
relation on a set X. If T is another set, a
function f : X →T is called a fundamen-
tal (or complete) invariant for E if x Ey ⇔
f (x) = f (y).
Fundamental Lemma in the Calculus of
Variations
Let ϕ(t) and ψ(t) be two
ﬁxed piecewise continuous functions de-
ﬁned on the interval [a, b]. Let ℘be the set

fundamental period
Let f (x) be a peri-
odic function. The smallest p > 0 for which
f (x + p) = f (x) for all x in the domain of
f is called the fundamental period of f (x).
fundamental period parallelogram
Let
f (z) be a doubly periodic complex-valued
function deﬁned on the entire complex plane
C. Thus, there is a nonzero α ∈C of least
modulus satisfying f (z + α) = f (z) for all
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

z ∈C. Moreover, there is another nonzero
β ∈C of least modulus such that β/α is not
a real number and f (z + α) = f (z) for all
z ∈C. The pair {α, β} is called a fundamen-
tal period pair of the function f (z). For each
complex number a ∈C, the parallelogram
with vertices a, a + α, a + β, a + α + β is
called a fundamental period parallelogram.
fundamental solution
Let P be a com-
plex polynomial of n variables and P(D) be
the corresponding linear partial differential
operator. A distribution ϕ in Rn is called a
fundamental solution of P(D) if ϕ satisﬁes
the partial differential equation P(D)ϕ = δ,
where δ is the Dirac delta “function.”
fundamental space
A complete metric
space. That is, a metric space X where each
Cauchy sequence in X converges to a point
in X.
fundamental system
A set of solutions
which forms a basis of the solution space
of a linear homogeneous differential equa-
tion or of a ﬁrst order linear homogeneous
system. Thus, the set {y1, y2, . . . , yn} of
solutions of such an equation or system
is a fundamental system if the solutions
y1, y2, . . . , yn are linearly independent and
every solution of the equation or system can
be expressed as a linear combination of these
solutions.
fundamental system of solutions
A ho-
mogeneous linear differential equation of or-
der n has at most n linearly independent so-
lutions. A set of n linearly independent solu-
tions constitute a fundamental system of so-
lutions of such an equation.
fundamental system of solutions
A set
of solutions (over a common interval) of
a homogeneous linear differential equation
such that every solution of the equation can
be represented as a linear combination of so-
lutions from this set. Furthermore, no proper
subset of this set will allow the representa-
tion of every solution.
One can show that an equation of order
n has exactly n linearly independent func-
tions in each such fundamental system. For
ﬁrst order systems over Rn, the fundamen-
tal system consists of n linearly independent
n-vector solutions.
A condition that ensures that a set of n
solutions forms a fundamental system is the
non-vanishing of the Wronskian Determi-
nant of this set of functions.
fundamental tensor of Finsler space
The
notion of Finsler space arises in an attempt to
provide a notion of length of arc in a differen-
tiable manifold which is independent of the
parametrization and of the sense of traversal.
A differentiable manifold is called a met-
ric space if there is a continuous function
F(x, ξ) deﬁned for all points x and all tan-
gent vectors ξ and having the following
properties: a) F(x, ξ) is positive deﬁnite in
ξ; b) F(x, λξ) = |λ|F(x, ξ), i.e., F(x, λξ)
is positive homogeneous of degree 1 in ξ.
The length of the arc x(t), t ∈[a, b] is de-
ﬁned to be |
 b
a F(x, ˙x)dt |.
A metric space is called a Finsler Space
if


gik(x, ξ)ηiηk > 0,
f or ξ ̸= 0, η ̸= 0,
where
gik(x, ξ) ≡1

∂ξi ∂ξk (x, ξ),
i.e., if the metric tensor is positive deﬁnite
and is obtained from the metric function. Ev-
ery Riemannian space is a Finsler Space.
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

sume that f is a Riemann integrable func-
tion on the closed real interval [a, b]. If there
is a real-valued differentiable function F on
[a, b] such that F′ = f , then
 b
a
f (x)dx = F(b) −F(a).
More general versions of this theorem,
e.g., for Lebesgue theory, can be formulated
and proved. The Lebesgue version requires
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

that F be differentiable at every point of
[a, b], and not just almost everywhere.
Extensions of this theorem to higher di-
mension are known as Green’s Theorem (in
dimension 2), the Divergence Theorem (in di-
mension 3) and Stokes’ Theorem in general.
Fundamental Theorem of the Theory of
Curves
Let (a, b) be an open interval con-
taining 0.
Let κ(s) and τ(s) be real-valued func-
tions deﬁned on (a, b), with κ(s) positive
and with continuous ﬁrst derivative there,
while τ(s) is continuous. Then there exists
one and (up to rigid motions) only one curve
in R3 for which κ(s), τ(s), and s are curva-
ture, torsion and arc-length, respectively.
Fundamental Theorem of the Theory of
Surfaces
Also known as Bonnet’s Funda-
mental Theorem. Let  be an open, simply
connected subset of R2 and suppose that α(u)
and β(u) are quadratic forms on the tangent
space to R2 at u, u ∈. Assume further
that their coefﬁcients αi j(u) and βi j(u) are
sufﬁciently differentiable functions of u. If
α(u) is positive deﬁnite and the Gauss cur-
vature equation and the Codazzi-Mainardi
equations are satisﬁed, then:
a) There exists a surface f :  →R3
whose ﬁrst and second fundamental forms
are α and β, respectively;
b) given any two surfaces f and g deﬁned
on  which have the same ﬁrst and second
fundamental forms, there exists an isometry
 : R3 →R3 such that f =  ◦g.

sheaf of -modules on X.

gamma function
Let z be a complex vari-

tion can be extended via the use of some
standard theorems from complex variable

whole complex plane, with an entire recip-
rocal.
The gamma function is familiar in the
context of the factorial function, since
(n + 1) = n! f or n = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
which is a special case of the more general
relation (z+1) = z(z). Several other for-

well-known formula satisﬁed by the Gamma

gamma structure
(1.) The study of
schlicht functions leads to the differential
equation P(w)dw2
w2
= Q(z)dz2
z2
which is
solved by w = f (z), the schlict function un-
der study. Any zero of Q(z) inside the unit
circle is mapped to a zero of P(w).
Any arc on which Q(z)dz2
z2
has a con-
stant argument is mapped on an arc on
which P(w)dw2
w2
has a constant argument.
These arcs are called trajectories, vertical if
Q(z)dz2

≤0, horizontal if Q(z)dz2
z2
≥0.
Let w be the set of maximal vertical tra-
jectories of P(w)dw2
w2
which do not begin
and end at the origin. This set is ﬁnite and
each trajectory that is part of this set con-
nects a zero to a zero, a zero to a pole, the
pole at ∞to the pole at 0, and only a ﬁnite
number of trajectories issue from the zeros
and from the pole at ∞.
In the z-plane, one carries out the same
construction, but limited to |z| ≤1, and de-
notes by z the set of trajectories contained
in the circle. z and w make up the -
structure.
(2.) Let E and M be topological spaces,
φ : E →M, be a homeomorphism of an
open set U ⊂E to an open set V ⊂M.
φ is called a local coordinate system of M
with respect to E. A set  of local coordi-
nate systems of M with respect to E is said
to deﬁne a -structure on M if  satisﬁes
the conditions: a) the totality of the images

Gateaux derivative
Let x, η ∈X, where
X is a vector space, and let Y be a normed
linear space. We deﬁne the Gateaux deriva-
tive of u : X →Y at x in the direction η as
the limit
Du(x)η = lim
α→0

if such limit exists. We say that u is Gateaux
differentiable at x if it is Gateaux differen-
tiable in every direction. In this case, the op-
erator Du(x) : X →Y is called the Gateaux
derivative at x.
gauge function
Let A and B be subsets
of a vector space X over R. We say that A
absorbs B if there exists λ > 0 such that
B ⊆µA for all µ with |µ| ≥λ. If A ab-
sorbs every ﬁnite subset of X, then A is said
to be absorbing. For an absorbing set A, the
function
pA(x) = inf {λ > 0 : x ∈λA}
for any x

Minkowski) function of A.
gauge transformation
In electromag-
netic theory, the electric ﬁeld vector ⃗E =
(E1, E2, E3) and the magnetic ﬁeld vector
⃗H = (H1, H2, H3) are related, in the absence
of electric charges, by Maxwell’s equations.
It is convenient to express ⃗E and ⃗H in terms
of a four-dimensional electromagnetic po-
tential (A0, A1, A2, A3), by setting
⃗E = gradA0 −
∂
∂x0
⃗A,
where grad A0 = ( ∂A0
∂x1 , ∂A0
∂x2 , ∂A0
∂x3 ), ⃗A =
(A1, A2, A3), and ⃗H = curl ⃗A.
The potential (A0, . . . , A3) is not uniquely
determined by the vectors ⃗E and ⃗H, since
they do not change under any transformation
of the type
A′
j(x) = A j(x) + ∂f
∂x j
(x),
for j
=
0, 1, 2, 3, where f is an arbi-
trary function. This transformation is called
a gauge transformation.
Gauss equations
Several equations fall
under this general name.
(1.)
DXY = ¯DXY −(L(X), Y)N;
where M is a hypersurface in Rn; Y is a C∞
ﬁeld on M; ¯D is the natural connection on
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

Rn; N is a unit normal ﬁeld that is C∞on
M; L(X) ≡¯DX N for X tangent to M and
(·, ·) is the Riemannian metric tensor. L is
also known as the Weingarten map. The im-
portance of this equation resides in the fact
that D can be shown to be the Riemannian
connection on M, and that ¯DXY can be de-
composed into its tangent and normal com-
ponents relative to M.
(2.) Gauss curvature equation. Let the pre-
vious notation hold; let X, Y and Z be C∞
ﬁelds on some open set  in M. Then
DX DY Z −DY DX Z −D[X,Y]Z
= (L(Y), Z)L(X) −(L(X), Z)L(Y).

See Gaussian frame.
Gauss’s circle problem
(1.) In his study
of the cyclotomic equation x p −1 = 0, which
is important both in the study of the solvabil-
ity of arbitrary degree equations by radicals
and also in the (related) construction of regu-
lar polygons with p sides, Gauss showed that
the roots of the equation can be expressed as
rational functions of the roots of a sequence
of equations, fi(x) = 0,
i = 1, 2, . . .,
whose coefﬁcients are rational functions of
the roots of the preceding equations of the
sequence. The degrees of the equations fi =
0 are the prime factors of p −1; there is
an fi for each factor, even if repeated; each
of the fi = 0 can be solved by radicals so
that the original cyclotomic equation can be
also so solved. This leads to the conclusion
that a regular polygon of p sides can be con-
structed by ruler and compass if p = 22n +1
is a prime, extending the number of poly-
gons known to be constructible from classi-
cal times.
(2.) Let r(n) denote the number of integer
solutions of the equation x2+ y2 = n, where
n is an integer. The problem of estimating
the sum 
n≤x r(n) is the problem of count-
ing the number of integer lattice points in-
side the circle of radius √x, and is called
Gauss’s circle problem.
Gauss’s formula
(1.) Formulae relating
the sides and angles of a spherical triangle.
Let A, B and  denote the length of the three
sides of a spherical triangle, with α, β and γ
denoting the opposite angles. We have:

(3.) Gauss’s Theorem, also known as the Di-
vergence Theorem or Ostrogradsky’s Theo-
rem.
Gauss’s Theorema Egregium
This theo-
rem states that two isometric surfaces in R3
must have, in some sense, the same geom-
etry: in particular, the curvature K(p) can
be computed from the ﬁrst fundamental form
and its ﬁrst and second partial derivatives. In
more formal terminology, we have:
Let M be a surface in R3, with Mp the
tangent space at the point p, and let X and
Y be an orthonormal basis for Mp. Then
the total curvature K(p) = det(L p) =
(L(Y), Y)(L(X), X)−(L(X), Y)(L(Y), X)
= (R(X, Y)Y, X), where L is the Wein-
garten map, (·, ·) denotes the Riemannian
metric on R3 and R(X, Y)Z ≡DX DY Z −
DY DX Z −D[X,Y]Z, where [·, ·] is the
bracket operator, and DXY is the induced
covariant derivative on the surface.
The theorem can be generalized to the
case where M is a k-dimensional submani-
fold of a Riemannian manifold.

Gauss’s Theorema Elegantissimum
This
is a corollary to the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem
that assumes the boundary arcs are geodesic
segments and thus with curvature 0. The re-
sult follows from the Gauss-Bonnet formula,
which loses those integral components.
Gauss-Bonnet formula
We start with a
simple form of the result, according to Bon-
net (1848). Gauss had earlier proved a simi-
lar result for geodesic triangles.
Let M denote a connected, oriented Rie-
mannian 2-manifold. Let A ⊆U ⊂M,
where U is a coordinate patch and ∂A is a
simple closed curve with exterior corner an-
gles α1, . . . , αr. Then

r

j=1
α j −

A
K
where k is the geodesic curvature function
on ∂A and K is the Riemannian (Gaussian)
curvature function on A.
A more general version frees the result
from the requirement that A ⊆U (a co-
ordinate domain), by requiring that A be a
union of images of squares (with disjoint in-
teriors) under orientation-preserving diffeo-
morphisms.
Let A ⊂M be as described; let ∂A be a
ﬁnite disjoint union of simple closed curves;
let α1, . . . , αr be the exterior angles of ∂A.
Then

∂A
k = 2πχ(A) −
r

K,
where χ(A) is the Euler characteristic of A.
If M is a compact connected oriented
Riemannian 2-manifold with Riemannian
curvature function K,

M K = 2πχ(M).
Furthermore, if M is a compact even-
dimensional hypersurface in Rk+1, then

M K = 1
2πkχ(M), where πk is the volume
of the unit k-sphere Sk.
Gaussian frame
Let the surface f :  →
R3, where  is a domain in R2 be given; let
(x, y) ∈; let fx and fy denote the tangent
vectors to the surface at (x, y); let n =
( fx × fy)/| fx × fy| denote the unit nor-
mal ﬁeld along f . The 3-frame ( fx, fy, n)
is called the Gaussian frame of the surface
f :  →R3. The mapping n :  →S2 ⊂
R3 is called the Gauss Map.
Gel’fand-Fuks cohomology
Let X(M)
denote the space of all smooth vector ﬁelds
on a smooth manifold M. Under the bracket
operation [X, Y] = XY −Y X, where the
vector ﬁelds are regarded as endomorphisms
of the space C∞(M) of smooth functions
on M, acting as ﬁrst order differential op-
erators, X(M) has the structure of a Lie al-
gebra. We introduce on X(M) the topology
of uniform convergence of the components
of vector ﬁelds and all their partial deriva-
tives on compact sets of M. We deﬁne a
cochain complex : C0 = R, C p = {φ :
φ : X(M) × . . . × X(M) →R, p ≥1},
where the product is taken p times. We de-
ﬁne a coboundary operator d on C p as
(1) dφ = 0, for φ ∈C0;
(2) dφ(X1, . . . , X p+1)
=

i< j(−1)i+ j
φ([Xi, X j], X1, . . . , ˇXi, . . . ˇX j, . . . , X p+1)
for φ ∈C p, p ≥1.
The cochain complex is ⊕{C p, d} and
the cohomology group H∗(X(M)) of this
complex is called the Gel’fand-Fuks coho-
mology group of M. The result according to
Gel’fand and Fuks is that, if M is a com-
pact oriented manifold of dimension n, the
dimension of H p(X(M)) is ﬁnite for all
p ≥0, and H p(X(M)) = 0 for 0 ≤p ≤n.
Gel’fand-Shilov generalized function
These are the continuous linear functionals
on function spaces on Rn or Cn which have
(at least) the properties (1) they are count-
ably normed spaces or countable unions of
such spaces; (2) their topology is stronger
than that of pointwise convergence.
By countably normed we mean that the
space has a topology induced by a countable
set of compatible norms. See Generalized
function for an example of such a countable
set of norms.

Gelfand transform
Let B be a commu-
tative Banach algebra and let  be the set
of all continuous, multiplicative homomor-
phisms from B to the complex numbers. For
x ∈B and h ∈, denote by ˆx(h) the homo-
morphism h evaluated at x:
ˆx(h) = h(x).
The map x →
ˆx from B to the algebra
of complex functions on  is called the
Gelfand transform. See Banach algebra.
general analytic space
A ringed space
(X, OX) is a general analytic space if
(1.) it is locally isomorphic to a ringed space
(A, HA), where A is an analytic set in a do-
main G ⊂Cn;
(2.) HA = (OG/J ) |A for some coher-
ent analytic subsheaf J of J (A) such that
supp(OG/J ) = A.
The notion of analytic space can also be gen-
eralized by going to inﬁnite dimensions (an-
alytic sets in complex Banach spaces).
general curve
A one-dimensional contin-
uum. In R2 this coincides with the Cantor
deﬁnition: a curve in R2 (two-dimensional
Euclidean plane) is a continuum that is
nowhere dense in R2.
A continuum is a connected compact
metric space consisting of more than one
point. A topological space is said to be con-
nected if there are no proper closed subsets
A and B of X such that A ∩B = ∅and
A ∪B = X.
general geometry of paths
This refers to
an alternative deﬁnition of connection on a
Finsler space, based on curves satisfying ap-
propriate second order differential equations
and called paths.
general rational function
A quotient of
polynomials in the form:
R(z) =
A (z −a1)λ1 (z −a2)λ2 . . . (z −an)λn
(z −b1)µ1 (z −b2)µ2 . . . (z −bm)µm
where λ j and µ j are positive integers, A, a j
and b j are complex numbers, and z is a com-
plex variable.
General Tauberian Theorem
See Taube-
rian Theorems. The version given here is
Wiener’s General Tauberian Theorem:
Let K ∈L1(R) and f ∈L∞(R). As-
sume ˆK(ξ), the Fourier transform of K(x),
does not vanish for any ξ, and
lim
x→∞

K(x −y) f (y)dy = H

K(t)dt,
for some constant H. Then
lim
x→∞

K ′(x −y) f (y)dy = H

K ′(t)dt,
for all K ′ ∈L1(R).
general term
This refers to sequences and
series. The general term of a sequence is
sometimes known as the nth term and refers
to the pair (n, Sn) in the graph of the se-
quence as a function from the (non-negative)
integers to its range space. Since a series is
the sum of a sequence, the general term of
the series refers to the nth summand.
generalized absolute continuity
Let E ⊂
R, let F(x) be a real-valued function whose
domain contains E. F(x) is a generalized
absolutely continuous function on E if: a)
F is continuous on E; b) E is the sum of
a countable sequence of sets En such that F
is absolutely continuous on En for all n.
generalized absolute continuity in the re-
stricted sense
This refers to the same gen-
eralization of the notion of absolute continu-
ity in the restricted sense that was introduced
for generalized absolute continuity.
generalized conformal mapping
Let 
be a domain in R2 and f
:  →R3 a
continuous surface. The mapping f (u, v) =
(x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v)) is a generalized
conformal mapping if the partial derivatives
of x, y and z with respect to u and v ex-
ist almost everywhere in , are square inte-
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

grable, and angles are preserved (almost ev-
erywhere) by the mapping.
generalized convolution
(1.) A general-
ization of the operation of convolution. Let
(X, X, m X), (Y, Y, mY ) and (Z, Z, m Z) be
σ-ﬁnite measure spaces. Assume further that
l(·, ·) maps pairs of measurable functions f
and g, deﬁned on X and Y respectively, to
measurable functions deﬁned on Z. We say
that l is a convolution structure if
(i.) for f ∈L1(X), g ∈L1(Y),
∥l( f, g)∥1 ≤∥f ∥1∥g∥1;
(ii.) for f ∈L1(X), g ∈L∞(Y),
∥l( f, g)∥∞≤∥f ∥1∥g∥∞;
(iii.) for f ∈L∞(X), g ∈L1(Y),
∥l( f, g)∥∞≤∥f ∥∞∥g∥1.
(2.) An extension of the usual operation,
meaningful on spaces of generalized func-
tions. If u is a distribution and φ is a C∞
function of compact support, the convolution
u ∗φ is a function f of class C∞, f (x) ≡
u(y)(φ(x −y)). For distributions u and v,
at least one of which has compact support,
there exists a unique distribution w such that
w ∗φ = u ∗(v ∗φ) for all φ ∈C∞
0 . This
distribution is called the generalized convo-
lution of u and v and is denoted by u ∗v.
generalized Fourier integral
See gener-
alized Fourier transform. (The Fourier inte-
gral of a function and the Fourier transform
are either the same or differ by a normaliza-
tion constant.)
generalized Fourier transform
(1.) The
extension of the notion of Fourier trans-
form from Euclidean (or locally Euclidean),
spaces to more general spaces, e.g., topo-
logical groups. In this context, a general-
ized Fourier transform is an invertible inte-
gral transform whose kernel, and the kernel
of its inverse, are of the form K(xy), i.e., a
function of a product.
(2.) The Fourier transform of a generalized
function. One needs to ﬁnd conditions on
the generalized functions that sufﬁce for the
product theorem: the Fourier transform of
a convolution is the product of the indi-
vidual Fourier transforms. For distributions
of compact support, the function ˆu(ξ) =
ux(e−i<x,ξ>) is deﬁned for every complex
vector ξ ∈Cn, and is an entire analytic func-
tion of ξ, called the Fourier-Laplace trans-
form of u. For temperate distributions, we
can deﬁne the Fourier transform as ˆv(φ) ≡
v( ˆφ) for all functions φ which, along with
their derivatives, vanish at inﬁnity faster than
any (reciprocal) polynomial. One can show
that, for such u and v, the Fourier trans-
form u ∗v is a temperate distribution, and its
Fourier transform is precisely the temperate
distribution ˆu ˆv.
generalized function
The linear func-
tionals on some function space. They were
introduced in order to understand and for-
mulate the behavior of solutions of partial
differential equations, and thus the functions
have multiple derivatives and convergence
usually requires convergence of the deriva-
tives. We give one example, observing that
the imposition of different conditions on the
underlying function space gives rise to dif-
ferent spaces of generalized functions. See
also Gel’fand-Shilov generalized function.
Let  denote an open set in Rn; let Ck
0()
denote the set of all functions u deﬁned and
with compact support in , whose partial
derivatives of order ≤k all exist and are
continuous. Let α denote a multi-index, α =
(α1, . . . , αn).
A generalized function (or distribution) u
in  is a linear form on C∞
0 () such that for
every compact set K ⊂ there exist con-
stants C and k such that
| u(φ) | ≤C

|α|≤k

0 (K).
generalized helix
A curve in R3 for which
the ratio torsion/curvature is a constant. It
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

can be easily shown that general (or cylindri-
cal) helices are precisely those curves whose
tangents make a ﬁxed angle with a given di-
rection.
generalized isoperimetric problem
A
natural generalization of the isoperimetric
problem: among all closed curves of a given
length l, ﬁnd the curve enclosing the greatest
area. The length of the enclosing curves is
the ﬁxed, equal (= iso) perimeter. The prob-
lem is sometimes known as Dido’s problem,
since the mythical founder of Carthage was
offered as much land as she could encom-
pass in a cow’s skin.
We can state the generalization as follows:
ﬁnd the curve y(x) = (y1(x), . . . , yn(x)) in
Rn for which the functional
F(y) =
 b
a
F(x, y1(x), . . . , yn(x),
y′
1(x), . . . , y′
n(x))dx
has an extremum, and where the admissi-
ble curves satisfy the boundary conditions
yi(a) = yia, yi(b) = yib, for i = 1, . . . , n,
and a < b, and are such that another func-
tional
G(y) =
 b
a
G(x, y1(x), . . . , yn(x),
y′
1(x), . . . , y′
n(x))dx
takes a ﬁxed value, say l.
generalized Jacobian
Let (T, A) be a
continuous plane mapping, where A is a do-
main (e.g., a simply or multiply connected
region bounded by one or more simple Jor-
dan curves) in R2 and T is a continuous map
from A to R2. Using notation from Geocze
area, we have a function v(T, π) (there is
only one projection) deﬁned over the class
of all simple polygonal regions π ⊂A.
Denote by v+(T, π) and v−(T, π) the
functions

A
(1/2)(|γ (z; C)| ± γ (z; C))dxdy,
respectively. From these, we have functions
V (T, A), V +(T, A) and V −(T, A), which
can be identiﬁed to the total variations of v,
v+ and v−.
If the mapping (T, A) is of bounded vari-
ation, the derivatives of V , V + and V −at a
point can be deﬁned (by using squares with
sides parallel to the coordinate axes, contain-
ing the point and of diameter tending to 0),
and it can be shown that such derivatives
exist and are ﬁnite almost everywhere. The
generalized Jacobian at x ∈A is the func-
tion J (x) ≡(V +)′(x) −(V −)′(x).
generalized Lam´e’s differential equation
A linear second order complex differ-
ential equation with rational function coefﬁ-
cients. More precisely, let a1, a2, . . . , an−1,

generalized trigonometric polynomial
Functions of the form m
n=1 αneiλnx, where
{λn : n = 1, 2, . . .} are real numbers, and
{αn : n = 1, 2, . . .} are complex numbers.
Recall that eiλnx = cos(λnx) + i sin(λnx).
They are almost periodic functions in the
sense of Bohr.
generalized trigonometric series
Let
Sm(x) = m
n=1 αneiλnx, n = 1, 2, . . . be a
sequence of generalized trigonometric poly-
nomials, and assume that limm→∞Sm(x)
exists uniformly in x. Then ∞
n=0 αneiλnx
is a generalized trigonometric series, and is
also almost-periodic in the sense of Bohr.
generating curve
A moving curve which
traces out a surface. Usually, the curve is ro-
tated around an axis in R3, and the surface
generated is a surface of revolution.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

generating function
(1.) Given a se-
quence of numbers or functions Pn(x),
where x ranges over some common domain,
and n = 0, 1, . . ., the formal power series
P(x, t) =
∞

n=0
Pn(x)tn
is called a generating function for the Pn(x).
For example, the Legendre polynomials
have generating function
P(x, t) = (1 −2xt + t2)−1/2.
Generating functions arise naturally in the
theory of eigenfunction expansions, in num-
ber theory and also in probability theory,
where, for example, Pn is the probability that
the random variable x will take the value n.
(2.) A similar idea arises with regard
to canonical transformations and contact
transformations: the generating function is
one whose (partial) derivatives provide the
components of the desired transformation.
generating line
A moving line which
traces out a surface. A special case of gen-
erating curve. Surfaces that possess a gener-
ating line are known as ruled surfaces.
generic property
Let X be a topological
space, and let P denote a property which is
either true or false of each element of X. We
say that property P is generic in X if the set
{x ∈X : P is true for x} contains a set which
is open and dense in X.
Geocze area
Let (T, A) be a surface,
where A is a domain (e.g., a simply or mul-
tiply connected region bounded by one or
more simple Jordan curves) in R2 and T is
a continuous map from A to R3; let E1, E2
and E3 denote the coordinate planes in R3,
and let Ti, i = 1, 2, 3, denote the compo-
sition of T with the projection on Ei. Let
∂π be the positively oriented boundary of a
polygonal domain π in A and Ci be the ori-
ented image of ∂π by Ti. The rotation num-
ber γ (z; Ci) of z with respect to the closed
plane curve Ci, is a measurable function of
z(= x + iy). We can deﬁne vi = v(Ti; π) =

Ei |γ (z; Ci)|dxdy, and v(T ; π) = (v2
i +
v2
2+v2
3)1/2. Let S denote any ﬁnite collection
of non-overlapping polygonal domains con-
tained in A. The Geocze area V of (T, A) is
deﬁned as V (T, A) = supS

π∈S v(T ; π).
There is a variant, the Geocze area
U of (T, A), where ui
=
u(Ti; π)

Ei γ (z; Ci)dxdy, and u(T ; π) = (u2
i +u2

u2
3)1/2, with U(T, A) = supS

π∈S u(T ; π).
Geocze problem
This is the problem of
determining whether the Lebesgue area of a
surface (T, A), where A is a domain in R2
and T is a continuous map from A to R3, is
the same as that obtained by using the set of
all sequences {(Fn, On) : n = 1, 2, . . .} such
that (Fn, On) converges to (T, A) and each
(Fn, On) is inscribed in (T, A). The answer
is positive if A is a Jordan domain and the
Lebesgue area is ﬁnite.
geodesic
(1.) The shortest curve connect-
ing two given points on a surface and lying
on the surface. On the surface of a sphere, a
geodesic is an arc of a great circle; in a Eu-
clidean space it is a line segment.
(2.) More generally, let M denote a smooth
n-dimensional manifold, let D denote a con-
nection (or covariant differentiation) on M,
and let σ be a smooth curve on M with tan-
gent ﬁeld . We say that σ is a geodesic if
D = 0, (i.e., the tangent ﬁeld of σ is par-
allel along σ).
geodesic arc
An arc of curve on a smooth
manifold which satisﬁes the condition of be-
ing a geodesic.
geodesic coordinates
Let M be an n-
dimensional smooth manifold, let Nx be an
open neighborhood of x ∈M. Let (U, φ)
be a chart containing Nx, φ : U →Rn.
We call φ a geodesic or normal chart if it
maps geodesics through x to line segments
through 0 ∈Rn.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

geodesic correspondence
Two surfaces,
with a diffeomorphism between them, which
maps geodesics to geodesics. This map is
also called geodesic preserving or connec-
tion preserving. A fairly immediate conclu-
sion is that a surface is locally geodesically
correspondent with a plane if it is a surface
of constant curvature.
geodesic curvature
Let M be a Rieman-
nian manifold with Riemannian connection
D. Let σ be a C∞curve in M with tan-
gent vector ﬁeld  = σ∗(d/dt). Assum-
ing that  does not vanish on the domain of
σ, we deﬁne the unit tangent vector T (t) =
(t)/|(t)|, where the Riemannian require-
ment allows for a notion of length of tangent
vectors. The geodesic curvature vector ﬁeld
of σ is deﬁned to be DT T , and its length is
the geodesic curvature of σ.
geodesic line
Given two points on a Rie-
mannian manifold, a curve of least length
joining the two points. For points on an em-
bedded hypersurface (dim = 2), the principal
normal of this curve coincides with the nor-
mal to the surface at each point on the curve.
geodesic polar coordinates
Let M be a
two-dimensional smooth manifold, let Dϵ be
a disk of radius ϵ centered at 0 ∈R2. A
map φ : Dϵ →M is called a geodesic
polar coordinate system if it maps line seg-
ments in Dϵ passing through the origin into
geodesics on M, and it maps the orthogonal
curves r = constant and θ = constant on
Dϵ to orthogonal curves on M.
geodesics
Curves that satisfy the con-
dition that their tangent vector be parallel
along them. See geodesic.
geometric mean
For n real numbers
x1, . . . , xn, the number (x1x2 · · · xn)1/n.
More generally, for G a locally compact,
Abelian group and w a nonnegative function
in L1(G), the geometric mean of w is
(w) = exp

G
log w(x)dx.
geometric progression
A sequence a0,
a1, . . ., such that an+1/an = d, for some
number d and all n ≥0.
geometric series
A series such that the
successive terms form a geometric progres-
sion.
geometry on a surface
Beside Euclidean
geometry, which is based on properties of
the Euclidean plane, and, in particular, the
parallel postulate, one can introduce ge-
ometries on other two-dimensional surfaces.
Such surfaces can be spheres, leading to
the well-known spherical geometry, hyper-
boloids, leading to the geometry of N. I.
Lobatchevski, or any other surface one de-
sires. The properties of the geometric objects
will depend on the geometry of the surface
on which the objects are deﬁned. See non-
Euclidean geometry.
germ of a set
Let T be a topological
space, A a subset of T , a a point of T . The
germ of A at a, denoted by Aa, is the set of
all subsets  of T which coincide with A on
some T -neighborhood of a.
germ of analytic set
A set A is an ana-
lytic subset of a complex analytic manifold
M if for every a ∈A there exists a neighbor-
hood  of a and a ﬁnite number of analytic
functions φ1, . . . , φn on  such that
A ∩
= {x ∈ : φ1(x) = . . . = φn(x) = 0}.
We deﬁne Aa, the germ of A at a, as a
germ of a set. See germ of a set. Each germ
Aa is associated with an ideal in the ring of
germs of holomorphic functions at a.
germ of holomorphic function
Let z0
be a point in the complex plane. We deﬁne
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

an equivalence class of holomorphic func-
tions at z0: two functions belong to the class
if there exists an open neighborhood of z0
on which the two functions coincide. This
equivalence class is the germ of the holomor-
phic function at z0. The notion can be ex-
tended in the obvious way to higher dimen-
sional manifolds, and holomorphic functions
of several complex variables. See sheaf of
germs of holomorphic functions.
Gevrey class
The notion of Gevrey class
provides a description of the growth of the
derivatives of a function. Let β be a non-
negative number. A function f (x) deﬁned
on the real interval [a, b] is said to belong
to the Gevrey class Gβ[a, b] if it has deriva-
tives of all orders on [a, b] and satisﬁes
the inequalities | f (q)(x)| ≤C Bqqqβ, q =
0, 1, 2, . . . for some constants B and C, de-
pending, possibly, on f .
Some consequences are that, for β ≤1,
an f (x) in Gβ[a, b] is an analytic function.
Furthermore, an analytic function in [a, b]
is in G1[a, b]. When β > 1, the class Gβ
contains functions which are not analytic.
In the case of n variables, let  be a
closed region, and let Gβ() be the collec-
tion of all functions deﬁned, continuous and
inﬁnitely differentiable on , which satisfy
the inequality:
| ∂q1+...+qnu(x)
∂xq1
1 . . . ∂xqn
n
|
≤C Bq1
1 . . . Bqn
n qq1β
1
. . . qqnβ
n
,
for q1, . . . , qn = 0, 1, 2, . . . The class G1
consists of functions analytic in each of their
variables. The class Gβ is closed under addi-
tion, multiplication by scalars and differenti-
ation.
Gibbs’ phenomenon
A phenomenon that
arises in the Fourier (or any continuous eigen-
function family) approximation of discon-
tinuous functions. As the number of terms
in the Fourier representation increases, the
approximation to the discontinuous function
near the discontinuity both overshoots and
undershoots the actual functional values, and
continues to do so, with a percentage of er-
ror bounded away from 0, regardless of the
number of terms in the representation. More
speciﬁcally, the function
f (x) =
+1, for 0 < x < π,
−1, for π < x < 2π
can be represented by a series periodic in
x with period 2π. One can show that, if
σn(x) represents the partial sums of the se-
ries containing all terms up to sin(nx), then
limn→∞σn(π/(2n + 1)) ≈1.179, thus indi-
cating an overshoot of about 18%.
global analysis
The determination of
maxima and minima of functions over Eu-
clidean spaces is part of what is known as
local analysis, i.e., the study of local proper-
ties of geometric or functional objects. When
we examine properties of objects deﬁned
on manifolds, which are locally Euclidean
spaces, we move into the domain of global
analysis. It includes the study of differential
operators on manifolds, and their extensions
to Banach manifolds, Morse theory and the
study of critical points, Lie groups, dynami-
cal systems and structural stability, singular-
ities, and others.
global concept
A mathematical concept
that is meaningful on a manifold. A certain
property or statement is assumed dependent
on the whole space, considered as a single
object.
global dimension
Let A be an analytic
subset of a complex analytic manifold G.
The global dimension of A is supz∈A dimz A,
where dimz A is the local dimension of A.
The local dimension of A is given by the di-
mension of the range of the covering map-
ping that exists due to the nature of A as a
k-sheeted ramiﬁed covering space.
Global Implicit Function Theorems
A
group of theorems which provide conditions
for the existence of global homeomorphisms
between topological spaces. Recall that
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

the standard Implicit Function Theorem pro-
vides a local homeomorphism only.
(i.) Global Inverse Function Theorem
(with differentiation): let φ : Rn →Rn
be C1 and proper (inverse images of com-
pact sets are compact). Assume further that
det(Dφ(x)) ̸= 0 for each x ∈Rn. Then φ is
a global diffeomorphism.
(ii.) Global Inverse Function Theorem
(with differentiation): let X and Y be Ba-
nach spaces, φ
∈C1(X, Y), [Dφ(x)]−1
exists and there is a constant K such that
|[Dφ(x)]−1|
≤K for all x ∈X. Then φ
is a homeomorphism of X onto Y.
(iii.) Global Implicit Function Theorem
(without differentiation): let X, Y be metric
spaces and assume that φ : X →Y is con-
tinuous and proper. If X \ φ−1(φ(W)) (W
is the set of critical points of φ, i.e., those
points at which φ is not invertible) is non-
empty, arcwise connected and Y \ φ(W) is
simply connected, then φ is a homeomor-
phism from X \ φ−1(φ(W)) onto Y \ φ(W).
(iv.) Global Inverse Function Theorem
(without differentiation): assume the condi-
tions of (iii.) hold. If W = ∅and Y is simply
connected, then φ is a homeomorphism from
X onto Y.
Goursat’s Theorem
Let D be any ﬁnite,
simply connected domain in the complex
plane C. Let γ be any closed, rectiﬁable
curve contained in D. If the function f (z)
is differentiable in D, then

γ f (z)dz = 0.
Notice that this theorem requires only
that the function f be differentiable, rather
than holomorphic.

In classical vector analysis, the
gradient of a function f on Rn is deﬁned to
be the vector ﬁeld

The notion can be extended to Riemannian
manifolds.
Gramian determinant
Let v1, . . . , vn
be vectors in a unitary or Euclidean space; let
x1, . . . , xn be indeterminates, and consider
the vector equation v1x1 + . . . + vnxn =
0. Performing scalar multiplications by
v1, . . . , vn in succession, leads to the scalar
system
(v1 · v2)x1 + . . . + (v1 · vn)xn = 0,
...
...
...
(vn · v1)x1 + . . . + (vn · vn)xn = 0.
The determinant



(v1 · v1), . . . , (v1 · vn)
...
(vn · v1), . . . , (vn · vn)


is called the Gramian of the vectors v1, . . . , vn.
It can be shown that the vectors v1, . . . , vn
are linearly independent if and only if their
Gramian determinant does not vanish.
graph
Several slightly different notions
pervade the mathematical literature. We
shall indicate the most common.
(1.) A graph G is a pair (V, E), where V
(the set of vertices) is a ﬁnite set and E (the
set of edges) is a subset of the collection of
subsets of V of cardinality two. If E is a set
of ordered pairs of elements of V , then G
is called a directed graph (or digraph). This
deﬁnition is used in combinatorics, in par-
ticular in the analysis of the time and space
complexity of algorithms.
(2.) A graph is a one-dimensional simplicial
complex. This terminology is used in topol-
ogy, and coincides with the deﬁnition in (1.).
(3.) In mathematical analysis, we deﬁne the
notion of graph in terms of sets and func-
tions. Let f be a function from a set X to
a set Y (the two sets could coincide). The
collection of all pairs (x, f (x)) in X × Y
is called the graph of the function f . Con-
versely, we can deﬁne a function in terms of
a graph, i.e., a subset of X × Y such that no
two elements of this set have the same ﬁrst
entry with different second entries.
(4.) More colloquially, a graph is a pictorial
representation of a relation among variables.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

In particular, a function can be given a visual
geometric meaning by plotting the points of
its graph on an appropriate coordinate sys-
tem.
graph norm
Let f : X →Y, where X
and Y are normed spaces. The graph norm
on X with respect to f is given by:
∥x∥f
=
∥x∥X + ∥f (x)∥Y .
(Thus it is deﬁned only for elements of X in
the domain of f .)
graph of equation
See graph.
graph of function
See graph.
graph of inequality
The set of points sat-
isfying the inequality. For example, the in-
equality x > a, for a ∈R, is the set of
points {x : x ∈R, x > a}. For the in-
equality f (x1, . . . , xn) ≥a, xi ∈Xi for
i = 1, 2, . . . , n, the graph consists of the
subset of the product X1 × . . . × Xn con-
sisting of all n-tuples (x1, . . . , xn) satisfying
the inequality.
graph of relation
Given sets X and Y
(where Y and Y could be the same set), a
relation from X to Y (or on X, if Y = X) is
a subset of the product set X × Y. This sub-
set, a collection of pairs, is also known as the
graph of the relation.
graphing
The process of obtaining a geo-
metric pictorial representation of a relation
among two or more variables by using its
graph to determine points in a coordinate
system.
Grauert and Remmert’s Theorem
Let
M and N be real analytic manifolds. Then
the set of real analytic maps from M to N
is dense in Cr
S(M, N), for 0 ≤r ≤∞, the
space of functions with continuous deriva-
tives up to orderr, where S denotes the strong
(graph) topology over the underlying set.
Grauert’s Theorem
Let X be a complex
manifold of dimension n and F a coherent
analytic sheaf over X. Let f : X →Y be a
holomorphic map of complex manifolds. If
f is a proper map, then f q
⋆F, the qth direct
image of F, is coherent for all q ≥0.
greatest lower bound
Given a set of real
numbers , the greatest lower bound of  is
a number b with the properties:
a) x ≥b for every x ∈;
b) if x ≥c for every x ∈, then b ≥c.
Green line
Assume u is a harmonic func-
tion over some domain D. The set {w :
u(w) = constant} is called a level or equipo-
tential surface for u. A point where grad(u)
vanishes is called critical. For each non-
critical point there exists an analytic curve
through it such that grad(u) is tangent to it
at every point of the curve. A maximal curve
with this property is called an orthogonal
trajectory. When u is a Green’s function, this
orthogonal trajectory is called a Green line.
Green measure
Let u(w) be a Green’s
function with pole w0. Let E be the family
of orthogonal trajectories issuing from the
pole. Let a be a closed level surface for u,
which, for sufﬁciently large a, is an analytic
closed surface homeomorphic to a spherical
surface. If A = E ∩a is a measurable
set, then the harmonic measure of A at w0
with respect to the interior of a is called
the Green measure of E. M. Brelot and G.
Choquet proved that all orthogonal trajecto-
ries issuing from the pole, except for a set
of Green measure 0, are Green lines issuing
from the pole, and u goes to 0 along them.
Green space
A generalization of a Rie-
mann surface on which a Green’s function
exists.
Green’s formula
(1.) In the context of or-
dinary differential equations. Let A(t) be a
continuous n × n matrix-valued function on
a t-interval [a, b]. Let A⋆(t) denote the com-
plex conjugate transpose of A(t); let f (t)
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

and g(t) be continuous n-vector-valued
functions on [a, b]. Let y(t) denote a solu-
tion of y′ = A(t)y+ f (t), while z(t) denotes
a solution of z′ = −A∗(t)z −g(t) on [a, b].
Then for all t ∈[a, b],
 t
a
[ f (x) · z(x) −y(x) · g(x)]dx
= y(t) · z(t) −y(a) · z(a).
(2.) In the context of complex variable the-
ory, partial differential equations or differ-
ential geometry. Let D be a bounded domain
whose boundary ∂D consists of a ﬁnite num-
ber of closed surfaces (or arcs) that are
piecewise of class C1. Let u and v have con-
tinuous ﬁrst and second order partial deriva-
tives and suppose the partial derivatives ux,
uy, vx, vy have ﬁnite limits at every bound-
ary point. Let n be the unit outer normal on
∂D, let dµ denote the inﬁnitesimal volume
element on D and let dσ denote the inﬁnites-
imal area element on ∂D. Then we have, as
a special case of Stokes’ Theorem:

D
(uv −vu)dµ
=

∂D
(u ∂v
∂n −v ∂u
∂n)dσ,
where  is Laplace’s operator.
If u and v are also harmonic in D, we have

∂D
(u ∂v
∂n −v ∂u
∂n)dσ = 0.
Green’s function
Green’s functions arise
in the solution of boundary value problems.
(1.) A typical such function for ordinary dif-
ferential equations: let A(t) be a continuous
n × n matrix-valued function on a t-interval
[a, b]. Let f (t) be a continuous n-vector-
valued function on [a, b].
Consider the system x′ = A(t)x + f (t),
on which we impose appropriate boundary
conditions.
The Green’s function for the boundary
value problem is a function G(t, τ), t, τ ∈
[a, b], such that the function
u(t) =
 b
a
G(t, τ) f (τ)dτ
exists on [a, b] and solves the boundary
value problem.
(2.) From complex variable theory, let D be
a region of ﬁnite connectivity in the complex
plane whose boundary is a ﬁnite sum of an-
alytic contours. Let z0 ∈D, and let G(z, z0)
be the solution of the Dirichlet problem in
D with boundary values log |ζ −z0|. The
Green’s function of D with pole at z0 is the
function g(z, z0) = G(z, z0) −log |z −z0|.
This function is harmonic in D, except at z0
and vanishes on the boundary.
(3.) In general, if the solution of a boundary
value problem has an integral representation,
the Green’s function for the boundary value
problem is deﬁned to be the kernel function
of the integral representation. See Green’s
operator.
Green’s operator
Consider a (partial)
differential equation (usually elliptic) as an
operator between pairs of function spaces,
say A : X →Y, with appropriate bound-
ary conditions. A Green’s operator (relative
to the boundary conditions), if one exists, is
the mapping A−1 : Y →X. Note that the
domain of A in X will depend on the bound-
ary conditions.
If a Green’s operator admits an inte-
gral representation, the kernel function as-
sociated with the representation is called
the Green’s function for the boundary value
problem.
Green’s tensors
Green’s functions that
arise in the solution of Stokes’s differential
equation in R3, or the equation  u + a
grad div u = 0 in a bounded domain D
with smooth boundary ∂D. They satisfy the
condition G(P, Q) = (gik(P, Q)) = 0 for
Q ∈D and P ∈∂D.
Green’s Theorem
Let E be an open set
in R2, with α and β two continuously differ-
entiable functions on E. Let  be a closed
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

subset of E, with positively oriented bound-
ary, ∂. Let d A denote the inﬁnitesimal area
element in R2. Then

∂
(αdx + βdy) =


(∂β
∂x −∂α
∂y )d A.
The theorem is often stated in terms of
differential forms and chains, and is one of
the many generalizations of the fundamental
theorem of calculus.
Gronwall’s inequality
Let u(t) and v(t)
be non-negative continuous functions on
[a, b]; let C ≥0 be a constant; assume that
v(t) ≤C +
 t
a
v(τ)u(τ)dτ
for a ≤t ≤b. Then v(t) ≤C exp
 t
a u(τ)dτ
for a ≤t ≤b. In particular, C = 0 implies
that v(t) ≡0.
Gross area
Let X be a Borel set in R3, let
E be any plane in R3; divide R3 into a mesh of
half-open cubes M1, M2, . . . with uniform
diameter d > 0; let m j denote the supremum
over all planes E of the Lebesgue measure
of the orthogonal projection of M j ∩X to E.
limd→0

j m j is called the Gross area (the
two-dimensional Gross measure) of X.
Gross measure
Starting from the family
F of all Borel subsets of Rn, deﬁne a func-
tion ζ(S) as the least upper bound of the m-
dimensional Lebesgue measures of the or-
thogonal projections of the Borel set S over
all m-dimensional hyperplanes of Rn.
The Caratheodory construction applied to
this ζ(S) gives rise to Gm the m-dimensional
Gross measure over Rn, where m ≤n.
Gross’s Theorem
Let w =
f (z) be a
meromorphic function, and let P(w, w0) be
a function element of the inverse function
centered at w0. Consider the set of half-lines
centered at w0 and parametrized by their ar-
gument. Then the set of arguments of half-
lines along which the analytic continuation
meets a singularity at a ﬁnite point is of mea-
sure 0.
Grothendieck group
Let A be an op-
erator algebra (usually assumed to be an
AF-algebra) and D(A) the projections in
A modulo the equivalence relation: e
∼
f
⇐⇒
e = v∗v, f = vv∗, for some
v ∈A. D∞(A) denotes the direct limit of
Dn(A) = D(Mn(A)), where Mn(A) denotes
the n × n matrices, with entries in A. The
Grothendieck group, K0(A), is the quotient
group of A. That is, K0(A) is the set of all
pairs of elements (α, β) ∈K0(A) × K0(A),
modulo the equivalence relation (α, β) ∼
(α′, β′) if α + β′ = α′ + β.

Setting
x
=
log (sec θ + tan θ), we deﬁne θ to be the Gu-
dermannian of x, gd(x). With it we can
express many relationships between trigono-
metric and hyperbolic functions; for exam-
ple: sinh (x) = tan (gd(x)).

Haar measure
A translation-invariant
Borel measure on a topological group.
Haar space
A locally compact topologi-
cal group X with a Borel measure µ, such
that µ(U) > 0 for every non-empty Borel
open set U, and µ(x E) = µ(E) for every
Borel set E and x ∈X. Such a measure is
called a Haar measure.
Hadamard manifold
A complete, simply
connected, Riemannian manifold of nonpos-
itive sectional curvature.
Hadamard’s Composition Theorem
Let
f (z) ≡∞
n=0 an zn, g(z) ≡∞
n=0 bn zn
and h(z) ≡∞
n=0 an bn zn, where an, bn, z ∈
C. For each of the functions one can deﬁne
the principal or Mittag-Lefﬂer star, A[ f ], as
the set of all those points a ∈C such that f
can be continued analytically along the line
segment [0, a]. We deﬁne A[ f ] ∗A[g] ≡
{A[ f ]c·A[g]c}c, where A[ f ]c is the comple-
ment of A[ f ] and the product set is {z1 z2 :
z1 ∈Z1 and z2 ∈Z2}. Hadamard’s Compo-
sition Theorem says that A[h] ⊂A[ f ]∗A[g].
Hadamard’s Factorization Theorem
If
f (z) is an entire function of ﬁnite order ρ,
then
f (z) = eg(z) zk P(z),
where g(z) is a polynomial of degree q ≤
ρ, k is a non-negative integer, and P(z) is a
canonical product of order σ ≤ρ. If ρ is not
an integer, then σ = ρ and q ≤⌊ρ⌋. If ρ is
an integer, then at least one of q and σ equals
ρ.
Hadamard’s Gap Theorem
One of many
results about the noncontinuability of a
power series beyond its circle of conver-
gence. Such series are called gap or lacunary
series.
Given the series ∞
n=0 anz jn, an ̸= 0,
where limn→∞n/jn = 0, if there exists a
ﬁxed λ > 1 such that for all n, jn+1/jn ≥λ,
then the series has its circle of convergence
as its natural boundary.
Hadamard’s
Theorem
(1.)
This
is
also known as the Prime Number Theo-
rem, originally conjectured by L. Euler:
let x be a nonnegative real number; let
π(x) be the number of prime numbers
≤
x. Then limx→∞π(x)/(x/log(x))
=
1. The theorem was proven by Jacques
Hadamard in 1896.
(2.) If a particle is free to move on a surface
which is everywhere regular and has no inﬁ-
nite sheets, the potential energy function be-
ing regular at all points of the surface and
having only a ﬁnite number of maxima and
minima on it, either the part of the orbit de-
scribed in the attractive region is of length
greater than any assignable quantity, or the
orbit tends asymptotically to one of the po-
sitions of unstable equilibrium.
Hadamard’s Three Circles Theorem
Let
f (z) be holomorphic in |z| < R, and set
M(r) = M(r; f ) = maxθ | f (reiθ)|. If 0 <
r1 ≤r ≤r2 < R, then
log M(r) ≤logr2 −logr

Hahn-Banach Theorem
If E is a sub-
space of the linear space X, if f is a sub-
additive functional on X such that f (ax) =
af (x) for a ≥0, and if g is an additive, ho-
mogeneous functional on E such that g(x) ≤
f (x) for every x ∈E, then there exists an
additive homogeneous extension h of g to all
of X such that h(x) ≤f (x) for every x ∈X.

half-plane
In R2, the collection of all
those points that lie on one side of an inﬁnite
straight line. The half-plane can be closed,
thus containing all the points of the deﬁn-
ing line, or open, thus containing no points
of the deﬁning line. Other conditions, where
part of the line belongs to the half-plane, are
also possible.
half-space
The portion of a linear space
bounded by a hyperplane. A number of gen-
eralizations of this notion are possible, for
example: let Y be the domain of positivity of
a formal real Jordan algebra A and let H be
the subset A ⊕
√
−1 Y = {x +
√
−1 y : x ∈
A, y ∈Y} of the complexiﬁcation AC of A.
H is called the half-space belonging to A. If
A = R and Y is the set of positive real num-
bers, then H is the upper half-plane in C, so
it is a half space in more common terms.
Hallstrom-Kametani Theorem
A gap-
value theorem, complementing, for mero-
morphic functions, those that E. Picard
proved for entire functions.
A single-valued meromorphic function

the coarsest topology in which the mappings

Hamilton’s equations
See Hamiltonian
function.
Hamiltonian function
In mechanics, the
behavior of a system with n degrees of free-
dom can be expressed in terms of a func-
tion of both position (qi) and momentum
(or velocity; pi). Such a function, usually
denoted by H(q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn, t), is
called the Hamiltonian of the system and sat-
isﬁes the system of Hamiltonian differential
equations:
d pi
d t = −∂H
∂qi
,
d qi
d t = ∂H
∂pi
,
for i = 1, . . . , n.
In the Lagrangian formulation, with La-
grangian
function
L(q1, . . . , qn, ˙q1, . . . ,
˙qn, t), we let pi
=
∂L/∂˙qi, for i
=
1, 2, . . . , n. The function n
i=1 pi ˙qi −L is
also called the Hamiltonian of the system.
Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld
Let (M, ω) be a
symplectic manifold and H : M →R a Cr
function, r ≥1. The vector ﬁeld X H given
by ω(X H, Y) = d H ·Y, is called the Hamil-
tonian vector ﬁeld with energy function H.
We restate this in more classical terminol-
ogy: Let (q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn) be canon-
ical coordinates for the symplectic 2-form ω,
so that ω =  dqi
 dpi. Then, in these
coordinates, the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld is
given by
X H = (∂H
∂pi
, −∂H
∂qi
) = J · d H,
where J =

. Thus (q(t), p(t)) is an
integral curve of the vector ﬁeld X H if and
only if Hamilton’s equations hold.

the quadratic form S(x, y) = n−1

See also Toeplitz matrix.
Hankel operator
An operator Hφ
:
H2 →H2⊥deﬁned by
Hφ f = (I −P)φf,
where P is the orthogonal projection from
L2 to H2, φ is bounded and f = f (eit) ∈
H2. For more general φ, Hφ can be deﬁned,
as above, for f a trigonometric polynomial,
and extended, when possible, to a bounded
operator deﬁned on all of H2. The matrix
of Hφ, with respect to the orthonormal ba-
sis {ei jt} of H2, is the Hankel matrix (ai+ j),
where {a j}, j = 0, 1, . . ., are the (forward)
Fourier coefﬁcients of φ. Often the change
of variables eit →e−it is applied to the right
side of the deﬁnition of Hφ, when an opera-
tor from H2 to itself is desired.
Hankel operators can also be deﬁned on
the Bergman space B2 and on H2 spaces in
several variables. In these cases, there are
two possibilities for the projection I −P
above. When I −P, for P the projection
from L2 to B2 [resp. H2] is used, the re-
sulting Hφ is called a large Hankel operator.
When, instead, I −P is replaced by the pro-
jection of L2 on the space of conjugates of
B2 [resp. H2] functions, then Hφ is called a
small Hankel operator.

Hardy-Littlewood Theorem
If limx→1

This is a generalization of the original
theorem of Tauber’s (and the ﬁrst ofﬁcially
Tauberian theorem; it was in this context
that Hardy and Littlewood introduced the
term), which assumed that an = o(1/n).
harmonic
(1.) Any function which satis-
ﬁes Laplace’s equation.
(2.) In the representation of functions in
terms of sums of periodic functions, any
function whose frequency is an integral mul-
tiple of a given one is called a harmonic of
the given one. Terms associated with this in-
terpretation are ﬁrst harmonic or fundamen-
tal frequency, where the nth harmonic has n
times the frequency of the ﬁrst.
harmonic analysis
The study of math-
ematical objects like functions, measures,
etc., deﬁned on topological groups. The
group structure is used to place the objects
in a translation-invariant context. The sim-
plest such context is provided by the circle
group and Fourier analysis.
harmonic boundary
Let R be a Riemann
surface, let R⋆be a compactiﬁcation of R,
 = R⋆\ R, an ideal boundary of R. We
deﬁne a set  to be the harmonic bound-
ary of R with respect to R⋆in the following
manner:  consists of those points p⋆∈
such that lim infp→p⋆,p∈R P(p) = 0, for ev-
ery positive superharmonic function P for
which the class of non-negative harmonic
functions smaller than P consists only of the
constant function 0.  is a compact subset of
R⋆and is the desired harmonic boundary.
If R is not compact, the non-uniqueness
of the compactiﬁcation of R implies that
the harmonic boundary is dependent on the
compactiﬁcation chosen.
harmonic continuation
Let H
be a
schlicht domain in R2 containing the domain
G. Let u be a harmonic function in G. If
there exists a harmonic function in H which
coincides with u on G, this function is called
the harmonic continuation of u. A funda-
mental result is that, if such a continuation
exists, it is unique.
harmonic differential form
Let M be a
Riemannian manifold of dimension n. A k-
form α on M satisfying α = 0 is called
harmonic.  is the Laplace-deRahm opera-
tor,  = dδ + δd.

A polynomial func-
tion in the variable x can be uniquely divided
(decomposed) into a sum of harmonic poly-
nomials times powers of |x|.
harmonic ﬂow
Let u be a harmonic func-
tion on a domain D; let a be an equipo-
tential surface u(w) = a, and let 0
a be the
complement in a of the critical points of u.
The family of orthogonal trajectories pass-
ing through a subdomain of 0

These are ker-

harmonic majorant
Given two functions
f (z) and g(z) deﬁned on a domain G (and
on its boundary), g(z) is a harmonic ma-
jorant of f (z) if g is harmonic on G and
g(z) ≥f (z) at all points of G. It can be
shown that, if f is subharmonic and g(z)
majorizes f (z) at all but a ﬁnite number of
points on the boundary of G, then g(z) is a
majorant of f (z) at all points in G, thus ex-
tending the majorization to the interior.
harmonic mapping
A map f : M →N
between Riemannian manifolds M and N
such that ∂f∗= 0, or, equivalently, such
that the trace of its second fundamental form
β( f ) vanishes. If f is a solution of Laplace’s
equation, then it is harmonic.

of positive numbers. The harmonic mean of
these numbers is given by

Let D be a bounded
domain whose boundary consists of a ﬁnite
set  of rectiﬁable Jordan curves. Let  =
α∪β, where α and β are ﬁnite sets of Jordan
arcs with Int(α)∩Int(β) = ∅. The function
ω(z, α; D), which is harmonic in D and as-
sumes the value 1 on α and the value 0 on
β, is called the harmonic measure of α with
respect to D, evaluated at the point z.
harmonic progression
A sequence of the
form pn = 1/(a + nd), n = 0, 1, . . ., where
a ̸= −n d for all n. In particular, the recipro-
cals of the pn form an arithmetic progression.

Harnack’s condition
A condition arising
in the constructive deﬁnition of integrals, in
particular Denjoy integrals.
Let S be an integral operator, K(S, I) a
set of real valued functions on a closed in-
terval I = [a, b] which is in the domain of
S. Let E be a closed subset of I0 ⊂R, {Ik}
be a sequence of intervals contiguous to the
set consisting of the points of E and the end-
points of I0, and f be a function on I0 satis-
fying the conditions:
(1.) let fE(x) = f (x)χ(E), where χ(E) is
the characteristic function of E. Then fE ∈
K(S, I0);
(2.) fk = fIk ∈K(S, Ik) for each k;
(3.) 
k |S( fk; Ik)| < +∞and limk→∞
O(S; fk; Ik) = 0 when the sequence {Ik} is
inﬁnite.
O(S; fk; Ik) is the variation of S( fk) on
Ik, i.e., the least upper bound of the numbers
|S( fJ; J)|, where J denotes any subinterval
of Ik.

Let {wn

n = 1, 2, . . .} be a sequence of real-valued
functions, harmonic in a bounded domain
 ⊂R2, continuous in ¯, and uniformly
convergent on the boundary of . Then
the sequence {wn} is uniformly convergent
throughout ¯ and the limit function w is

Harnack’s Lemma
This is also known as
Harnack’s inequality.
Let u be harmonic and non-negative in a
disk D of radius R with center at z0. For any
point z of D, and r = |z −z0|, the following
inequalities hold:
R −r
R + r u(z0) ≤u(z) ≤R + r
R −r u(z0).
Harnack’s Second Theorem
Let {u j}
be a sequence of harmonic functions on a
bounded domain D in the plane such that
{un(p)} is increasing for each point p ∈D
and that {un(p0)} is bounded for some point
p0 ∈D, then {un} converges uniformly on
compact subsets of D, to some harmonic
function u.
Hartogs’ Continuation Theorem
Let D
be a domain in Cn of the form D = D1× D2
with D1 ⊂Ck and D2 a bounded domain in
Cn−k having boundary S. Then any function
holomorphic in a neighborhood of [(cl(D1) ×
S)∪({a}×cl(D2)], for some a ∈D1, can be
holomorphically extended to D. Here cl(X)
denotes the closure of a set X.
Hartogs’ Theorem of Continuity
Let G
be a domain of holomorphy in Cn containing
domains Sj, Tj, j = 1, 2, . . .. Suppose that
(i.) cl[Sj ∪Tj] is contained in G,
(ii.) sup{| f (z)| : z ∈Tj} = sup{| f (z)| : z ∈
Sj ∪Tj for all f holomorphic in G}
(iii.) S0 = lim Sj is bounded.
Then for T0 = lim Tj, cl(T0) ⊂G implies
cl(S0) ⊂G. Here cl(S) denotes the closure
of a set S.
Hartogs’ Theorem of Holomorphy
Let
f be a complex-valued function deﬁned in
a neighborhood of z0 ∈Cn. Then f is
holomorphic in the n-dimensional variable
z = (z1, . . . , zn) if it is holomorphic with
respect to each coordinate variable z j sepa-
rately. A major part of the theorem is that the
continuity of f follows from the existence of
the n partial derivatives.
Hartogs-Osgood Theorem
Let G be
a bounded simply connected domain in
Cn, n

Then every function holomorphic in a neigh-
borhood of the boundary of G extends to a
function holomorphic in G. This is very dif-
ferent from the behavior in the case of one
complex variable.
Haupt’s Theorems
Theorems concerning
the stability of solutions of the differential
equation
u” + (λ + γ F(x))u = 0,
where λ, γ are parameters and F(x +2π) =
F(x). (Note that this is a special case of
Hill’s equation and a generalization of Math-
ieu’s equation.) For ﬁxed γ , there are two
countably inﬁnite sequences {λ j}, {λ′
j} cor-
responding to periodic and half-periodic so-
lutions respectively with
λ0 < λ′
1 ≤λ′
2 < λ1 ≤λ2 < λ′
3 . . . .
For λ ∈[(λ2 j−1, λ2 j) ∪(λ′
2 j−1, λ′
2 j)] the
equation has unstable solutions and for λ in
the complementary open intervals, it has sta-
ble solutions. These results are useful when
applied to the Mathieu functions arising in
problems in oscillation theory.
Hausdorff dimension
For the Hausdorff
measures m p and A a Borel set in the metric
space X, there exists a unique p0 such that
m p(A) = ∞
if
p < p0
and
m p(A) = 0
if
p > p0.
(See Hausdorff measure.) This unique p0 is
the Hausdorff dimension of A. This coin-
cides with the natural concept of dimension
for nice sets in Euclidean spaces.

Hausdorff measure
A collective name
for a class of measures on a metric space
X deﬁned in the following manner: For
l = l(A) a non-negative function deﬁned
on a class of open sets in X, let λ(B, ε) =
inf{l(Ai) : B ⊂∪i Ai,l(Ai) < ε}. The
Hausdorff measure λ(B), of B, is deﬁned by
λ(B) = lim
ε→0 λ(B, ε).
Most frequently, l is taken to be a function
of the diameter deﬁned on the class of open
balls in X. In the most important examples,
we have lp(A) = diam(A)p, 0 < p < ∞, to
yield the Hausdorff measures m p. Hausdorff
measures appear in many different parts of
analysis related to capacity, minimal sur-
faces, fractals, etc..

Heaviside’s function
A seemingly in-
nocuous function deﬁned by
H(x) =

x ≥0
0
if
x < 0.
This corresponds to the case of a constant
unit input or output, in a system beginning at
time 0. Obviously H′(x) = 0 if x ̸= 0. This
function has played a central role in moti-
vating the theory of distributions, in which
H′(x) = δ0, the Dirac delta function.
Heine’s series
A generalization of the hy-
pergeometric series deﬁned by
φ(a, b, c; q, z) = 1 + (1−qa)(1−qb)
(1−q)(1−qc) qz
+ (1−qa)(1−qa+1)(1−qb)(1−qb+1)
(1−q)(1−q2)(1−qc)(1−qc+1) q2z + . . .
Taking q = 1 + ε, z = 1
ε log x, and letting ε
tend to 0, we obtain the hypergeometric se-
ries in the limit.
helicoidal surface
A surface generated
by a curve simultaneously rotated about a
straight line with a constant angular veloc-
ity and also translated in the direction of the
line at a constant linear velocity.
helix
A curve in three-dimensional space
on the surface of a cylinder that intersects all
generators of the cylinder at constant angles.
Often the circular case, i.e., the spiral stair-
case, is simply referred to as a helix and the
cases of more general cylinders are called
generalized helices. Occasionally, the anal-
ogous curve on the surface of a cone is also
called a helix. All the above are special cases
of curves of constant slope.
Helly’s Theorem
If σ(x) and σn(x), n =

rem, concerning convergence of sequences
of monotone functions, both of which are
sometimes referred to as Helly’s Theorem.
Helmholtz differential equation
The
partial differential equation ( + k2)u(x) =
0, where  is the Laplacian operator, u =
(u11 + u22 + . . . + unn). A generalization
of Laplace’s equation, this equation occurs,
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

among other places, in the solution of higher
dimensional heat and wave equations. It is
usually accompanied by boundary condi-
tions on u and can be solved explicitly via
Fourier series, in the cases of simple geome-
tries for the domain of u.
Helson set
A compact subset K of a lo-
cally compact Abelian group G with a thin-
ness condition. Speciﬁcally, K is a Helson
set if there is a constant C such that the norm
of µ is bounded by C times the sup norm of its
Fourier transform, for all regular Borel mea-
sures µ on K, i.e., ∥µ∥≤C∥ˆµ∥∞. Here the
Fourier transform is considered as a function
on the dual group of G. There are several
other equivalent conditions for a Helson set.

Herglotz Theorem
Let {an} be a positive
deﬁnite sequence of complex numbers, i.e.,

ically increasing bounded function α(t) on

quence with such an integral representation
is positive deﬁnite).

weight function w(x) = e−x2. The nth Her-
mite polynomial satisﬁes the Hermite equa-

the formula

Hermitian form
A mapping

from L × L into C, where L is a vector
space, such that, for each x, y ∈L, fx(y) =
f (x, y) is antilinear and f y(x) = f (x, y) is
linear and f (x, y) = f (y, x). These are the
properties necessary to deﬁne an inner prod-
uct by (x, y) = f (x, y).

Hermitian linear space

ﬁned; generally referred to simply as an in-
ner product space, a pre-Hilbert space or,
sometimes, as a vector space if the inner

Hilbert module
A Hilbert space H, to-

A on H, denoted (a, x) →ax for a ∈A and
x ∈H, satisfying

a(bx) = (ab)x,
(ii.) a(x + y) = ax + by, and
(iii.) the map (a, x) →ax is continuous
from A × H to H.
A consequence of (iii.) is that
∥ax∥≤C∥a∥∥x∥,
for all a ∈A and x ∈H, for some constant
C. If the constant C can be taken to be 1, we
call the Hilbert module contractive and if H
is similar to a contractive Hilbert module (if
the Hilbert module K = L H L−1 is contrac-

where aLx = Lax for the Hilbert module
K), then H is called cramped.

Hilbert’s problem
Any one of 23 prob-
lems posed by David Hilbert (1862–1943)
at the International Congress of Mathemati-
cians, held in Paris, in 1900. Hilbert was
generally considered to be the leading math-
ematician of his time and these problems,
ranging over a wide spectrum of mathemati-
cal endeavor, served as a stimulus and guide-
line for much subsequent mathematical re-
search.
The term is also used to refer to a gen-
eralized isoperimetric problem in the calcu-
lus of variations, namely, that of ﬁnding the
curve of ﬁxed length bounding a maximum
area, subject to an auxiliary condition that
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

the variation of some functional stay ﬁxed;
the constraint also involves some differential
equations.
Various other problems are associated
with Hilbert’s name, but they usually contain
an additional noun. Hilbert’s problem can re-
fer to the problem of ﬁnding a sectionally
holomorphic function F(z), deﬁned on the
set , the complex plane C cut along a set of
arcs F1, F2. F is required to be of order zn at
∞and at each z in , the limiting values of
F(z) from opposite sides of F1 and F2, sat-
isfy F1(z) −aF2(z) = f (z), for some ﬁxed

of {z ∈Cn : | f (z)| ≤sup | f (w)|, w ∈K}.
holomorphic mapping
A function
f
mapping an open set G ⊂Cn into Cp such
that u ◦f is holomorphic for every contin-
uous linear mapping u : Cp →C. This
can be generalized to the case of an open G
contained in an analytic space or a complex
manifold.
holomorphic modiﬁcation
An analytic
space X is called a holomorphic modiﬁca-
tion of an analytic space Y if there exist
two analytically thin sets (a technical condi-
tion for “small” sets) M ⊂X and N ⊂Y and
a map φ taking X\M isomorphically onto
Y\N.

at a. Note that such a Laurent series exists
whenever f is holomorphic in such an an-
nulus.
holomorphically complete domain
A
domain G in Cn, which is equal to the com-
mon existence domain of the holomorphic
extensions of all functions holomorphic on
G. That is, there is no larger domain G1 with
the property that every holomorphic function
on G extends holomorphically to G1.
holomorphically convex domain
A sub-
set of Cn equal to its holomorphically con-
vex hull. See polynomially convex region.
holonomic system
A system of N parti-
cles in R3 whose 3N position coordinates
at time t satisfy constraints of the form
f j(x1, . . . , x3N, t) = 0, j = 1, . . . k, with
f j(x, t) ∈C2. These equations are the only
constraints on the motion of the particles and
do not explicitly contain any velocities or ac-
celerations. However, by differentiating the
constraints, we see that velocity and acceler-
ation also inﬂuence the constraints.
homogeneous integral equation
An inte-
gral equation in which the sum of all terms
containing the unknown function is equal
to 0. For example, an equation of the form
f (t) +

X
f (x)k(x, t)dµ(x) = 0.
Alternatively deﬁned as an integral equation
in which every scalar multiple of a solution
is also a solution. The concepts are equiva-
lent for linear equations.
homogeneous linear differential equation
A differential equation of the form
y(n) + p1(x)y(n−1) + . . . + pn(x)y = 0,
where the functions p j are continuous and
y( j) = d j y/dx j. The term could also refer
to a partial differential equation of the form
Ly = 0, where L acts on a function y by
multiplications and partial derivatives of var-
ious orders and satisﬁes
L(c1y1 + c2y2) = c1Ly1 + c2Ly2.

homology
Homology theory is based on
associating a certain sequence of groups to a
topological space and using algebraic prop-
erties of these groups and their homomor-
phisms to study topological properties of the
space and its mappings. There are several
different types of homology theories. Ho-
mology is particularly relevant to questions
concerning dimensions and degrees of map-
pings.
homothety
A transformation of Euclidean
space, depending upon a point O, such that
each point P is mapped to a P′ such that
dist(O, P′) = kdist(O, P) for some real
k > 1. The concept can be extended to more
general contexts such as afﬁne spaces.

H¨ormander’s Theorem
Any one of sev-
eral theorems in partial differential equations
due to L. H¨ormander. The most common ref-
erence is to an existence theorem. Let P(D)
be a partial differential operator with con-
stant coefﬁcients. The solutions of P(D)u =
0 are all C∞if and only if P(D) is hypoel-
liptic, i.e., if P(ζ + iη) = 0 and |ζ + iη| →
∞, then |η| →∞.
hyperbola
A conic section equal to the in-
tersection of a double cone and a plane par-
allel to the axes. Equivalently, it can be de-
ﬁned as the set of all points, the difference of
whose distances from two ﬁxed points (the
foci) is constant. An example is the graph of
x2 −y2 = 1.
hyperbolic differential operator
A lin-
ear partial differential operator in the vari-
ables t, x1, . . . , xn of second order.
L(u) = utt −

a0iuti −

ai jζiζ j
has two distinct real roots λ1(t, x, ζ) and
λ2(t, x, ζ) for any ζ = (ζ1, . . . , ζn). The
classic example is the wave equation, for
which the above condition simpliﬁes greatly.
For higher order equations, there are several
different deﬁnitions of hyperbolic; the con-
cept is most often deﬁned in terms of unique-
ness of solutions of Cauchy problems.
hyperbolic equation
A partial differential
equation of the form L(u)= f (t, x1, . . . , xn),
where L is a hyperbolic differential operator.
See hyperbolic differential operator.
hyperbolic function
Any of the six real
or complex functions sinh, cosh, tanh, coth,
sech, or csch deﬁned by
sinh(x) = ex −e−x
2
,
cosh(x) = ex + e−x
2
,
tanh(x) = sinh(x)
cosh(x),
coth(x) =
1
tanh(x),
sech(x) =
1
cosh(x),
csch(x) =
1
sinh(x).
They are related to hyperbolas, as the trigono-
metric functions are related to circles and the
multitudinous trigonometric identities each
tend to hold in the corresponding hyper-
bolic case, except for some occasional minus
signs. A further connection to the trigono-
metric functions is given in the complex case
by sinh(ix) = i sin(x) and cosh(ix) =
cos(x). The hyperbolic functions appear in a
wide variety of analysis problems, especially
involving differential equations.
hyperbolic paraboloid
A quadric sur-
face in R3, two of whose coordinate cross-
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

sections are parabolas and the third of which
is a hyperbola. The simplest example is the
graph of z = x2 −y2, whose critical point at
the origin is the classic example of a saddle
point.
hyperbolic point
A point on a surface
where the Gaussian curvature is strictly neg-
ative, which is equivalent to the condition
that the approximating quadric surface at
that point be a hyperbolic paraboloid.

that the cross-sections in two coordinate di-
rections are hyperbolas and, in the third, el-
lipses. For example, the graph of x2

one or two sheets accordingly as the hyper-
bolas do not or do intersect the axis of the
hyperboloid.

roots.
hyperelliptic Riemann surface
A Rie-
mann surface arising as a two-sheeted cov-
ering surface for the function F(z, w) =
w2 −P(z). (See hyperelliptic integral.) An
alternative deﬁnition is a Riemann surface
of a function having the form f (z) = (z −
a1)

bers a1, . . . , an.
hyperfunction
A member of the largest
class of generalized functions that are bound-
ary values on R of holomorphic functions.
Hyperfunctions can equivalently be consid-
ered as locally ﬁnite germs of continuous
linear functionals deﬁned on real-analytic
functions or formal derivatives of continuous
functions of inﬁnite order differential opera-
tors of local type.
hypergeometric differential equation
An
ordinary differential equation of the form
z(1−z)w”+(γ −(α+β+1)z)w′−αβw = 0,
for α, β, γ constants, w = w(z) and ′ =
d/dz.
hypergeometric function
An analytic
continuation of the hypergeometric series
that is single-valued in some domain in C.
(See hypergeometric series.) It is a solution
of the hypergeometric differential equation.
(See hypergeometric differential equation.)
These functions form a well-known class of
special functions with a wide variety of ap-
plications and can be generalized in many
different contexts.
hypergeometric function of conﬂuent type
A solution of the differential equation
z2w” + (γ −(α + β)z)w′ −αβw = 0.
This corresponds to the hypergeometric dif-
ferential equation with the regular singular
point considered to be at ∞, i.e., a conﬂu-
ence of singularities. Its solutions, hyperge-
ometric functions of conﬂuent type, can be
expressed as
F(α, γ, z) =
 α
n!γ
α + 1
γ + 1 . . . α + n −1
γ + n −1zn,
for |z| < ∞.
hypergeometric integral
An integral over
a suitable path C in the complex plane of the
form

functions.

for the hypergeometric differential equation.
(See hypergeometric differential equation).
It converges in |z| < 1, for all α, β, γ .
hyperinvariant subspace
A closed lin-
ear subspace, most often in a Hilbert space
or Banach space, that is invariant for (i.e.,
mapped into itself by) all operators commut-
ing with a given linear operator.
hypersurface
A higher dimensional ana-
logue of a standard surface in three di-
mensions. That is, a subset of n + 1-
dimensional space, for n > 2, consisting
of points (x1, . . . , xn, xn+1), such that xi =
fi(u1, . . . , un), i
= 1, . . . , n + 1, where
the fi are continuous functions deﬁned on
a common n-dimensional domain.

xn) and y ∈R, the point (y, x), together
with the n-dimensional hyperplane y∗−
y =  c j(x∗
j −x j) in Rn+1, for constants
c1, . . . , cn.
hypocycloid
A curve traced in the plane
by a ﬁxed point on a circle that rolls without
slipping on the inside of another circle.
hypoelliptic differential operator
A dif-
ferential
operator
P(D),
ordinary
or
partial, with constant coefﬁcients such that,
if P(ζ + iη) = 0 and |ζ + iη| →∞,
then |η| →∞. More generally, if P(D) =
 aα(x)Dα, where D is either an ordinary
or partial derivative and α is an integer or
multi-index, respectively, of order at most m,
having C∞coefﬁcients, then P(D) is called
hypoelliptic if the solutions of P(D)u =
g(x) are of class C∞, for all C∞functions
g(x). (See also H¨ormander’s Theorem).
hypofunction
A generalization of a func-
tion, with a range which includes inﬁnite val-
ues, that arises in constructing solutions of
the Dirichlet problem using Perron’s method.
See Dirichlet problem, Perron’s method.
hyponormal operator
A bounded lin-
ear operator T , deﬁned on a Hilbert space,
whose self-commutator (T ∗T −T T ∗) is pos-
itive. This generalizes the concept of nor-
mal operator, for which the self-commutator
is 0. An extensive theory for hyponormal op-
erators has been developed, which includes
spectral theory and singular integral models.
hypotenuse
The side of a right trian-
gle opposite the right angle; the hypotenuse
is best known for its central role in the
Pythagorean Theorem.
hypotrochoid
A curve traced in the plane
by a point rigidly attached to a circle, not
at the center, where the circle rolls without
slipping on the inside of a ﬁxed circle.

I
ideal boundary
For a compact Hausdorff
space X, a set of the form Xc\X, where Xc
is a compactiﬁcation of X, (i.e., a compact
Hausdorff space containing X as a dense
subset).
idempotent measure
A regular, bounded
measure µ on a locally compact, Abelian
group G such that µ ⋆µ = µ, where ⋆de-
notes convolution of measures, deﬁned by
λ ⋆µ(E) =

G λ(E −y)dµ(y). By dual-
ity, this is equivalent to the condition that
the Fourier transform ˆµ be idempotent un-
der multiplication, (i.e., ˆµ(γ ) = 0 or 1, for
all γ ∈G).
identity function
A function mapping a
set to itself assigning each element of its do-
main to itself as an image, (i.e., f (x) = x).
image
(1.) The set of values assumed by a
function f : A →B; that is, { f (a) : a ∈A}.
(2.) The value assumed by a function at a
point a, by a function f : A →B may be
called the image of a (under f ).
imaginary axis
The y-axis in the complex
plane. Namely, the vertical axis, under the
standard representation of the complex num-
bers as points in the plane, via the Cartesian
coordinate system, where (x, y) corresponds
to the complex number z = x + iy, with the
points on the vertical axis corresponding to
the pure imaginary numbers.
imbedded submanifold
The image, in a
manifold M, of an imbedding F : N →M
having a manifold N as domain. See imbed-
ding.
imbedding
A homeomorphism of a topo-
logical space M into a topological space N,
so that M is homeomorphic to a subspace of
N. If M and N are differentiable manifolds,
an imbedding is also required to be differen-
tiable. The term is also spelled embedding.
immersed submanifold
A manifold M,
together with an immersion of M into an-
other manifold N. Frequently it is the case
that M is a subset of N with a not necessar-
ily compatible structure, and the immersion
is the inclusion map. A famous result is that
an n-dimensional manifold can be immersed
in R2n−1 (and imbedded in R2n+1). See also
Whitney’s Theorem.
immersion
A continuous mapping
f
from a topological space X to a topological
space Y, for which each point x ∈X has
a neighborhood mapped homeomorphically
onto its image f (U); hence, a local homeo-
morphism. In the case of differentiable man-
ifolds, f is required to be differentiable and
have maximal rank at each point x ∈X.
implicit differentiation
A process by
which an implicitly deﬁned function is dif-
ferentiated via the chain rule without ﬁrst
solving for the function explicitly. For ex-
ample, if y is a function of x, satisfying
y4 + y −x −x4 = 0, implicit differenti-
ation yields dy/dx = (1 + 4x3)/(1 + 4y3),
without having to solve for y in terms of x.
implicit function
A function y = f (x),
deﬁned by a relation of the form F(x, y) =
0. Often additional conditions, such as a
value (x0, y0) through which y
=
f (x)
passes, is required to determine the function
uniquely.
Implicit Function Theorem
A theorem
establishing the existence of a function y =
g(x1, . . . , xn), from an implicit relation of
the form f (x1, . . . , xn, y) = 0. In its sim-
pler case, it states that if f (x1, . . . , xn, y)
is continuously differentiable on a domain
G ⊂Rn+1 and if f (P0) = 0 and the partial
derivative fy(P0) ̸= 0, then, in a neighbor-
hood of P0 = (x0, y0) there exists a unique
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

function g(x1, . . . , xn), such that
f (x1, . . . , xn, g(x1, . . . , xn)) = 0
and g(x0) = y0.
improper integral
An expression, having
the form of a deﬁnite integral, in which either
the domain is unbounded, or the integrand is
unbounded on the region of integration. The
improper integral is deﬁned to be a limit of
appropriate deﬁnite integrals. For example,
 ∞
0
1
(1 + x)2 dx
= lim
R→∞
 R
0
1
(1 + x)2 dx = 1.
inclination of a line
The angle that a
straight line makes with some ﬁxed reference
line. For lines in the xy-plane, the reference
line is generally taken to be the x axis.
inclination of a plane
The smallest of the
dihedral angles that a plane makes with some
ﬁxed reference plane. Somewhat of an old-
fashioned concept, the direction determined
by the normal vector to the plane frequently
is used to describe the inclination of a plane.
incomplete beta function
The function
deﬁned by
Bx(a, b) =
 x
0
ta−1(1 −t)b−1dt,
for 0 ≤x < 1, a, b > 0. B1(a, b) =
B(a, b) is the standard beta function. Bx is
frequently deﬁned with a factor
1
B(a,b) in
front of the integral. See also beta function.
incomplete gamma function
The func-
tion deﬁned by
x(m) =
 x
0
e−ttm−1dt,
for 0 ≤x, 0 < m. ∞(m) = (m) is the
standard gamma function. x is sometimes
deﬁned with a factor of
1
(m) in front of the
integral. (See also gamma function.)
increasing function
A real-valued func-
tion, deﬁned on a set D of real numbers,
such that, for any x1, x2 ∈D with x1 < x2,
we have f (x1) < f (x2). Often the condi-
tion f (x1) ≤f (x2) is used in place of the
strict inequality above. The former case is
called strictly increasing and the latter non-
decreasing. The concept is easily extended
to the case of a function mapping any di-
rected set into a directed set.
increasing sequence
A sequence {an} of
real numbers, such that an < an+1 for all n.
As with the term increasing function, the in-
equality an ≤an+1 is often used in place of
strict inequality. Note that an increasing se-
quence can be deﬁned as an increasing func-
tion deﬁned on the positive, or nonnegative,
integers. See increasing function.
increment
A change in the argument or
values of a function. For example, for a func-
tion y = f (x), x2−x1 = x is called the in-
crement in x and f (x2)−f (x1) = y2 −y1 =
y is the corresponding increment in y.
indeﬁnite D-integral
A generalization of
the Lebesgue integral due to Denjoy. For a
real-valued function f on [a, b], if there ex-
ists a function F, of generalized absolute
continuity in the restricted sense, whose ap-
proximate derivative ADF(x) = f (x), a.e.,
then F is an indeﬁnite D-integral for f . (See
Denjoy integral.)
indeﬁnite integral
An integral

f (x)dx,
without limits of integration, deﬁned up to
an additive constant, often considered to be
the whole class of functions F(x)+C, where
F′ = f and C is an arbitrary constant. This
can also be written as F(x) =
 x
a f (t)dt,
where a is an arbitrary real number. Also
called antiderivative or primitive function.
index of an eigenvalue
For a linear oper-
ator T : X →Y, where X and Y are Banach
spaces, the number
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

ν(T, λ) = dim Ker(T −λI)
−dim Ker(T −λI)∗.
The index ν is especially important when the
operator T −λI is Fredholm. See Fredholm
operator.
index set
For a family of objects {aλ : λ ∈
},  is called the index set for the fam-
ily.  can be considered to be the domain
of a function f , mapping  into {aλ} with
f (λ) = aλ. In the simplest case,  is the set
of natural numbers, in which case, {aλ} is a
sequence.
Index Theorem
A theorem which estab-
lishes a relationship between the analytic in-
dex of a linear operator D mapping L0 into
L1, where the analytic index
ia(D) = dim ker(D) −dim coker(D),
and a topological index, namely some topo-
logical dimensions related to D, L0 and
L1. The most famous index theorem is
the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem, involv-
ing elliptic pseudo-differential operators and
sections of vector-bundles on differentiable
manifolds.
indicial equation
(1.) For the differential
equation xr dy
dx = A(x)y, A(x) an n × n ma-
trix function, analytic at 0, with A(0) ̸= 0,
the equation det(A(0) −ρI) = 0 is called
the indicial equation at x = 0. The roots of
the indicial equation determine the behavior
of the solution of the above equation at the
singular point x = 0.
(2.) If x0 is a regular singular point for a
linear nth order differential equation
pn(x)dny
dxn + pn−1(x)dn−1y
dxn−1 + . . .
+p0(x) = 0,
with polynomial coefﬁcients, and if y = (x −
x0)r(a0 + a1(x −x0) + . . .) is substituted
in the equation, then the coefﬁcient of the
lowest power of x −x0 is called the indicial
equation. It is a polynomial in r of degree n.
See regular singular point.
inferior limit
See lower limit.
inﬁnite determinant
For an inﬁnite ma-
trix A = (ai j), with i, j
= 1, 2, . . ., a
limit in the natural sense of the determi-
nants of An = (ai j), i, j = 1, 2, . . . , n.
Another meaning involves compact linear
operators of trace class, deﬁned on an
inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space. For T a
trace class operator, with eigenvalues {λ j},
counted with multiplicities, the inﬁnite de-
terminant of I +T is deﬁned by det(I +T ) =
(1 + λ j). The product can be shown to be
either ﬁnite or convergent; if T has no eigen-
values, the product is taken to be 1.
inﬁnite sequence
A function f , deﬁned on
the natural numbers, {1, 2, . . .}, into a given
set, where we denote f (n) by an. Usually,
a sequence is thought of as a progression of
terms a1, a2, . . ., or a countable set {an}, n =
1, 2, . . ., indexed by the natural numbers.
inﬁnite series
A formal expression of the
form
∞

j=1
a j = a1 + a2 + . . . ,
generated by the sequence a1, a2, . . . , an, . . .
of real or complex numbers. The elements an
are referred to as terms and the elements
sn = (ak + ak+1 + ak+2 + · · · + an)
are partial sums of the inﬁnite series.
If the sequence s1, s2, . . ., is convergent,
its limit is referred to as the sum of the in-
ﬁnite series. It is conventional to denote the
sum of the series by the same expression or
symbol as the series itself. For example, ei-
ther
∞

k
an = M
or ak + ak+1 + ak+2 + · · · + an + · · · = M
means that the series is convergent and its
sum is M.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

The concept of series is not restricted to
series of real or complex numbers. In ab-
stract, a series can be generated by a se-
quence of the elements of a set X in which
“addition” and “closeness” are deﬁned.
inﬁnite type power series space
Let K
be any ﬁeld with a principal valuation v and
uniformizer π. Taking v to be normalized,
we have v(π) = 1. We denote by Ov the
valuation ring, (π) the maximal ideal and
k = Ov/(π) the residue class ﬁeld. Let us
take a set of representatives A for k in Ov;
thus each element of A is congruent (mod
π) to exactly one element of k. For conve-
nience we assume that O ∈A, so that O is
represented by itself.
Given c ∈K ∗, suppose that v(c) = r.
Then cπ−r is a unit, so there exists a unique
ar ∈A such that cπ−r ≡ar (mod π); more-
over, ar ̸= 0. It follows that v(c −arπr) ≥
r +1, so there exists a unique ar+1 ∈A such
that
(c −arπr)π−r−1 ≡ar+1
(mod π).
Now an induction shows that for any n ≥r
we have a unique expression
c ≡
∞

r
aiπi
where ai ∈A, r = v(i), ar ̸= 0.
(1)
Here r can be any integer, positive, negative
or zero. From the deﬁnition of r as v(c) it is
clear that r ≥0 precisely when c ∈Ov. The
structure (ﬁeld) of K is entirely determined
by expression (1) for its elements, together
with addition and multiplication tables for the
transversal. By this we mean: given a, a′ ∈
A, the elements a + a′ and aa′ lie in Ov and
so are congruent (mod π) to uniquely deter-
mined elements of A:
a + a′ ≡s,
aa′ ≡p (mod π),
where s, p ∈A.
The space with the structure described above
is an inﬁnite type power series space.
inﬁnite-dimensional linear space
A vec-
tor space having an inﬁnite linearly indepen-
dent set of vectors.
inﬁnite-dimensional manifold
A mani-
fold such that each point has a neighborhood
that is homeomorphic to an open subset
of an inﬁnite-dimensional topological vec-
tor space. See also Banach manifold, Hilbert
manifold.
inﬁnitely differentiable function
(1.) A
function f (x), of one variable, such that dn f
dxn
exists and is differentiable, for all n.
(2.) A real or complex-valued function
f (x1, . . . , xn) such that the partial deriva-
tives of f of all orders exist and are dif-
ferentiable. The notation C∞(D) is used for
the inﬁnitely differentiable functions with
domain D.
inﬁnitesimal
(1.) The differentials dx, dy
were regarded as inﬁnitely small, and of-
ten called inﬁnitesimal, at an early stage of
the development of calculus. Using this (not
formally justiﬁed) idea, the tangent line to
a curve was considered to be a line pass-
ing through the two points (x, y) and (x +
dx, y + dy) which were considered to be in-
ﬁnitely close to each other with the slope dx
dy .
This ambiguity was resolved later, using the
concept of limits, by mathematicians such as
Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass.
(2.) A function f together with a point a
such that limx→a f (x) = 0. For example,
x = x −a is an inﬁnitesimal.
(3.) Let (x1, . . . , xn) be the coordinates of
a point in Rn. Also, let a(t) = (a1(t), . . . ,
an(t)), a(0) = e be a differentiable curve
in Rn. The tangent vector α =
da
dt |t=0 to
a(t) at e is called the inﬁnitesimal vector
of a(t).
All vectors α
∈Rn are inﬁnitesimal
vectors of some differentiable curves, say
a(t) = αt. Therefore, the set of inﬁnitesimal
vectors is an n-dimensional vector space.

inﬁnitesimal transformation
A group G
of linear fractional transformations of D =
{z : |z| < 1} onto itself contains inﬁnites-
imal transformations if there exists a se-
quence {Sn} of elements of G such that none
of Sn is the identity mapping I in group G
and limn→∞Sn(z) = z for all z in D.
inﬁnitesimal wedge
An open set C ⊆Cn
which is sitting in a set U + i, where U
is an open set in Rn and  is an open cone in
the space Rn
y of the imaginary coordinates,
having the property that for every proper sub-
cone ′ of  and for every ϵ > 0 there exists
δ > 0 such that {x ∈U : dist(x, ∂U) >
ϵ} + i(′ ∩{|y| < δ}) ⊆C. The set U is
called the edge of the inﬁnitesimal wedge C.
By a proper subcone of  we mean a sub-
cone with the property that the intersection
of its closure with the set {|y| = 1} is con-
tained in the interior of .
inﬁnity
The symbols +∞and −∞by
which one can extend the real number sys-
tem R. The extended real number system is
obtained by adjoining these symbols to the
set R and then extending the addition + and
multiplication · as in the following.
a + (+∞) = (+∞) + a = +∞,
for a ∈R;
a + (−∞) = (−∞) + a = −∞,
for a ∈R;
a · (+∞) = (+∞) · a = +∞,
a > 0, a ∈R;
a · (−∞) = (−∞) · a = −∞,
a > 0, a ∈R;
a · (+∞) = (+∞) · a = −∞,
a < 0, a ∈R;
a · (−∞) = (−∞) · a = +∞,
a < 0, a ∈R.
This extension facilitates the study of behav-
ior of real-valued functions of real variables
in the intervals where the absolute value of
either a variable or values of a function in-
crease without bound.
However, any other extensions such as
(+∞) −(+∞);
+∞
+∞;
(+∞)0;
etc., would lead to some inconsistency in the
system and hence should be left as an inde-
terminate form.
The extended complex plane is obtained
by adjoining the symbol ∞to the com-
plex plane C and for every ϵ > 0 the set
{z : |z| >1/ϵ} is considered as an open disk
centered at inﬁnity. This extension facilitates
the study of behavior of functions of a com-
plex variable in a region where the moduli
of either a variable or values of a function
increase without bound.
inﬂection point
A function f deﬁned on
an open interval I containing a has an in-
ﬂection point at a if f is a concave function
on one of the intervals comprising I\{a} and
convex on the other. If the second derivative
f ′′ exists on I\{a}, then a is a point of in-
ﬂection of f if and only if f ′′(x) > 0 on one
side of a while f ′′(x) < 0 on the other side.

when the values of u and one of its ﬁrst
derivatives is given, at every point of a cer-
tain surface S. As the knowledge of any ﬁrst
derivative (u being assumed to be known all
over S) is equivalent to the knowledge of any
other one (provided the corresponding direc-
tion is not tangent to S), we shall assume that
the derivative in question is the transversal
one. When calculating the values of u in a
certain region R of an m-dimensional space,
it will be assumed that if, from any point a
of R as vertex, we draw the characteristic
conoid, one of its sheets will cut out a cer-
tain portion S0 (ﬁnite in every direction) of
S and together with S0, be the boundary of a
portion T of our space. This geometric con-
dition is expressed by saying that we have to
deal with the interior problem. Note that no
interior problem exists for non-normal hy-
perbolic equations. Moreover the solution so
obtained satisﬁes all required conditions. On
the contrary, no exterior problem admits a

intermediate integral
In solving a non-
linear partial differential equation of the sec-
ond order
F(x, y, z, p, q,r, s, t) = 0,
it is often desirable to ﬁnd a relation u =
φ(v) in which φ is an arbitrary function and
u, v are two functions of x, y, z, p, q such
that the original differential equation can be
solved by eliminating the arbitrary function
φ. The existence of such a relation is not nec-
essary; however, in case it exists, the relation
u = φ(v)
φ arbitrary,
is called an intermediate integral of the
above equation.
It is known that equations of the second
order for which intermediate integrals exist
are of the general form
Rr + 2Ss + T t + U(rt −s2) = V,
where R, S, T , U, V , are functions of x, y,
z, p, q. Moreover, among others, Monge’s
method is the one that can be used to con-
struct an intermediate integral for the equa-
tion.
Intermediate Value Theorem
If f is a
continuous real-valued function on the inter-
val [a, b] and f (a) ≤k ≤f (b), then there
exists a number c, a ≤c ≤b such that
f (c) = k. In other words, the range of f
is a connected set.

H∞(D) of bounded analytic functions in D
such that f (zm) = wm for every m.
interpolation
Extending the deﬁnition of
a function by assigning a value between
known values, as opposed to outside given
values, which is extrapolation.
For example, if

interval

x < b} or (a, b] = {x : a < x ≤b}.
Unbounded interval: [a, ∞) = {x : x ≥a},
(a, ∞) = {x : x > a}, (−∞, a] = {x :
x ≤a}, or (−∞, a) = {x : x < a}.
The inﬁnite intervals (−∞, a] and [a, ∞)
[resp., (−∞, a), (a, ∞)] may also be called
closed [resp., open] in agreement with the use
of the words closed and open in topology.
Note that the symbol ∞, above, read as
“inﬁnity” does not denote any real number.

invariance
(1.) Invariance of Laplace’s
equation: Suppose U = U(u, v) is a har-
monic function in a domain G in the w-
plane. Then U satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
Uuu + Uvv = 0, for (u, v) ∈G. Now, if
w = f (z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is a con-
formal mapping from a domain D in the z-
plane onto G, then the composite function
V = U( f (x, y)) = U(u(x, y), v(x, y))
is harmonic in D and satisﬁes Laplace’s
equation Vxx + Vyy = 0, for (x, y) ∈D.
(2.) Invariance of contour integrals: The con-
tour integral of a continuous complex-valued
function f along a contour C is deﬁned us-
ing a parameterization z = z(t), a ≤t ≤b,
of C. However, the integral is invariant under
certain changes in the parameterization. For

example, let t = ψ(s), c ≤s ≤d, be a con-
tinuous real-valued function with the range
[a, b]. Furthermore, let ψ have a continuous
derivative ψ′ with ψ′(s) > 0. Then, the new
parameterization z = z(ψ(s)), c ≤s ≤d,
will not change the result of the contour in-
tegral.
(3.) Invariance of arc lengths: The arc length
of a smooth arc is also invariant under the
same changes of parameterizations as for the
contour integrals.
(4.) Translation-invariance: The property
µ(E + λ) = µ(E), for certain measures µ
on a group, where E + λ = {x + λ : x ∈E}
for E ⊆G.
invariant subspace

space M of a Banach space X associated

variant subspaces for T , they are called the
trivial invariant subspaces.

(x, y) ∈
R} associated with the relation
R ⊆X × Y = {(x, y) : x ∈, X, y ∈Y}.
inverse transform
The inverse operator
of a transform. It is most advantageous when
a speciﬁc formula (such as an integral for-
mula) for the inverse transform can be found.
Example: Inverse Laplace transform: Sup-
pose F(s) is an analytic function throughout
the complex s-plane and having poles only
at s j = α j + β j, j = 1, . . . , n. For α0 > α j,
j = 1, . . . , n, the function f (t) deﬁned by

Laplace transform of F(s).
Recall that the Laplace transform F(s) of
f (t) is deﬁned by
F(s) = L{ f (t)} =
 ∞
0
e−st f (t) dt.
inverse trigonometric function
An in-
verse function f −1, where f is a trigono-
metric function, restricted to a subset S of its
domain, so that it is one-to-one on S. For ex-
ample, the function sin x is one-to-one on the
interval [ π
2 , 3π
2 ] (onto [−1, 1]). Thus, sin x
has an inverse function mapping [−1, 1] to
[ π
2 , 3π
2 ].
For each inverse trigonometric function
f −1 there is an alternative notation which
is used interchangeably with f −1 such as
arcsin which is interchangeable with sin−1,
arccos interchangeable with cos−1, etc.

ally an integral operator or other transform.
See inverse transform.
For example, the formula for the Fourier
series of an L2(0, 2π) function can be
thought of as the inversion formula for
the transform taking an L2 function to its
Fourier coefﬁcients. The formula is

An r-jet u = jr
x f from X
into Y is invertible if there is an r-jet v =
jr

deﬁned and equal to the jets of the identity
maps IX and IY , respectively.
Recall that if X, Y, Z are differential mani-
folds and f : X →Y, f : Y →Z are two Cr
maps, r ≥0, with y = f (x), then the jet
jr

involute
Suppose a line L moves tangent
to a curve E from point Q1 to point Q2 on
E. The locus of any ﬁxed point P on L is
an involute of E. The involute depends upon
the point P, but all involutes are parallel.
An involute of a planar curve E is given
by the parameterization
x(t) = α(t) −α′(t) S(t) + C
S′(t)
;
y(t) = β(t) −β′(t) S(t) + C
S′(t)
,
a ≤t ≤b, where C is a constant and E is
parameterized by
α = α(t), β = β(t), a ≤t ≤b;
furthermore, it is assumed that α(t), β(t)
are differentiable functions and S(t)
=

See also involute evolute.
involute evolute
The locus of centers of
curvature of the points of a given curve is
called the evolute of the curve. If a curve
E is the evolute of a curve C, then C is an
involute of E.
If C is a planar curve having parameteri-
zation
x = x(t), y = y(t), a ≤t ≤b,
where x(t), y(t) have continuous ﬁrst- and
second-order partial derivatives, then the
evolute of C is given by
α = α(t)
≡x(t) −y′(t)
x′2(t) + y′2(t)
x′(t)y′′(t) −x′′(t)y′(t);

An involute of the circle
x = R cos t, y = R sin t, 0 ≤t ≤2π
is given by
x(t) = R(cos t + t sin t);
y(t) = R(sin t −t cos t), 0 ≤t ≤2π.

isothermal coordinates
If u = (u1, u2)
are local coordinates on a manifold M such
that u1, u2 are conjugate harmonic func-
tions, then u = (u1, u2) are called isother-
mal coordinates. Note that the line element
in isothermal coordinates looks like

λ(u1, u2)
, λ(u1, u2) ̸= 0.
isothermal parameters
If M is a man-
ifold with a Riemannian metric and carry-
ing a structure ! of class C1, then to every
mapping φ ∈! with domain V there corre-
spond three real-valued functions F, G, and
H in φ(V ), satisfying the conditions F > 0,
F H −G2 > 0. An isothermal parameter
system is a mapping φ ∈! whose associ-

iterative method of solving integral equa-
tions
The method in which one starts with
an approximation for the solution, say φ0(x).
Then substitutes φ0(x) in the integral equa-
tion to get the next approximation, φ1(x). If
one continues this process successively, then
under appropriate conditions the sequence
{φn(x)} obtained would converge to a solu-
tion φ(x).
For example, in the case of the Volterra
integral equation of the second kind φ(x) =
f (x)+
 x
0 k(x, y)φ(y) dy, one can show that
if f (x) is continuous on an interval 0 ≤x ≤
a and k(x, y) is continuous on the square
0 ≤x ≤a, 0 ≤y ≤a, then the sequence
φn(x) =

der 2. See Weierstrass ℘function. Moreover,
associated with ω1, ω2 = ω1 + ω3, and

A ray Arg z = θ0 in the

For example, if f has an essential singu-

anating from the origin, called a Julia direc-
tion, such that f takes every ﬁnite value w,

Kernel Theorem
Let X, Y be open sets
in Rm and Rn, respectively. An operator T
from L2(X) to L2(Y) is a Hilbert-Schmidt
operator if and only if it is an integral opera-
tor associated with a kernel k ∈L2(X × Y).
This means that k is a square integrable func-
tion on X × Y and
T f (y) =

X
k(x, y) f (x) dx.
Recall that a bounded linear operator T from
a separable Hilbert space H1 to a separable

operator if

Kleene’s hierarchy
Projective set theory
is regarded as the theory of the NN analytic
hierarchy of Kleene, where NN is the set of
all number-theoretic functions with one ar-
gument. It was S.C. Kleene who, by using
the theory of recursive functions, established
a theory of hierarchies that generalizes the
classical descriptive set theory.

that homogeneous coordinates are projec-
tive coordinates, and if (ξ0, ξ1, · · · , ξ5) ̸=
(0, 0, · · · , 0), and λ ̸= 0, then (ξ0, ξ1, · · · , ξ5)
and (λξ0, λξ1, · · · , λξ5) represent the same

Write Br(P) for an

L–space
A space X of arbitrary elements
for which, associated with certain sequences

called the limit of the sequence and denoted
a = limn→∞an, such that:
1. If limn→∞an = a and {ank}∞

L’Hˆopital’s Rule
A rule applied to com-

Suppose that the functions f and g are
real-valued and differentiable in a deleted
neighborhood of the point c, for example, in
(c −δ, c) ∪(c, c + δ), where δ is a positive
number. Suppose g′(x) ̸= 0 in that neigh-
borhood, and lim
x→c f (x) = 0 = lim
x→c g(x).
Then

f (x)
g(x) = lim
x→c
f ′(x)
g′(x)
provided that the limit on the right either ex-
ists (as a real number), or is ±∞.
This rule extends to the case where
lim
x→c f (x) = ±∞= lim
x→c g(x).
Also spelled L’Hospital’s Rule. See also

ladder method
A method by which the
main part of a differential equation is de-
composed, in two different ways, into two
factors, each of which has order one, and
from that decomposition is obtained a re-
currence formula involving the parameter.
This method, also called the factorization
method, is helpful in solving the hypergeo-
metric (Gaussian) differential equation.
As an example, consider Legendre’s dif-
ferential equation with a parameter n
d
dx [(1 −x2)dy
dx ] + n(n + 1)y = 0.
Let Bn = (1 −x2) d
dx + nx, Fn = (1 −
x2) d
dx −nx, and Ln[y] = (1 −x2)( d
dx [(1 −
x2) dy
dx ]+n(n+1)y). Then Ln is decomposed
in two different ways, Ln ≡Fn · Bn + n2, or
Ln ≡Bn+1 · Fn+1 + (n + 1)2. If yn is a so-
lution of Ln[y] = 0, then multiplying both
sides of Fn · Bn[yn]+n2yn = 0 by Bn yields
Bn · Fn ·(Bn[yn])+n2Bn[yn] = 0. So Bn[yn]
is a solution of Ln−1[y] = 0. Similarly, mul-
tiplying both sides of Bn+1 · Fn+1[yn]+(n +
1)2yn = 0, we see that Fn+1[yn] is a solution
of Ln+1[y] = 0. Hence we obtain a recur-
rence formula involving the parameter n.

Lagrange multiplier
Consider the sim-

lem in the calculus of variations: Find two
functions y(x) and z(x) so that the func-
tional
J(y, z) =
 x1
x0
F(x, y, z, y′, z′)dx
attains its extrema subject to the condition
G(x, y, z) = 0
and the ﬁxed boundary conditions
y(x0) = y0,
z(x0) = z0,
y(x1) = y1,
z(x1) = z1.
The Lagrange multiplier method is to intro-
duce an auxiliary function F∗= F +λ(x)G,
where λ(x) is to be determined, and convert
the above constrained extrema problem into
the constraint-free extrema problem of the
following functional
J ∗=
 x1
x0
F∗(x, y, z, y′, z′)dx.
The corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation
is

z −d
dx F∗
z′ = 0;
or
Fy + λ(x)Gy −d
dx Fy′ = 0,
Fz + λ(x)Gz −d
dx Fz′ = 0.
Together with the constraint equation G(x, y,
z) = 0 we can eliminate λ(x) and one un-
known function (e.g., z), and obtain a dif-
ferential equation for y(x) of second order.
Then we follow the routine procedure to
solve for y(x), and hence z(x). The associ-
ated λ(x) is called the Lagrange multiplier.

Landau’s symbols
The symbols O and
o, indicating the word “order,” and due to
E.G.H. Landau. Let f and g be two real-
or complex-valued functions. If
""" f (x)
g(x)
""" is
bounded as x →a, then f is called at
most of the order of g as x →a, written
f (x) = O(g(x)) as x →a. If f (x)
g(x) →0, as
x →a, then f is said to be of lower order
than g as x →a, written f (x) = o(g(x)) as
x →a.
Landau’s Theorem
If the complex val-
ued function f (z) = a0 +a1z +· · · (a1 ̸= 0)
is holomorphic in |z| < R and f (z) ̸= 0, 1
in the same domain |z| < R, then there ex-
ists a constant L(a0, a1) depending only on
a0 and a1, such that R ≤L(a0, a1).

a sequence of functions deﬁned in R+

Let X be an oriented n-dimensional dif-
ferential manifold of class C∞with a Rie-
mannian metric ds2 of class C∞. We de-
ﬁne a linear mapping ∗that transforms (C∞)
p-forms to (n −p)-forms. Using ∗we can
deﬁne an inner product for p-forms. Let
d be the exterior derivative, and let δ =
(−1)np+n+1∗d∗which operates on p-forms.
Then d and δ are adjoint to each other with
respect to the inner product. The Laplace-
Beltrami operator is deﬁned by

If a function f (x)
is invariant under the Hankel transform, that
is,
f (x) =
 ∞
0
√xyJν(xy) f (y)dy,
where Jν is the Bessel function, then f (x) is
called a self-reciprocal function (with re-
spect to the Hankel transform).
Applying a self-reciprocal function we
can get the lattice-point formula in number
theory as follows.
Let r(n) be the number of possible ways
in which a nonnegative integer n can be rep-
resented as the sum of two square numbers.
Put
p(x) =

0≤n≤x
′r(n) −πx,
where 
′ means that if x is an integer,
we take r(n)
2
instead of r(n). Then f (x) =

2 (p( x2
2π ) −1) is self-reciprocal with re-
spect to the Hankel transform with ν = 2.

lattice-point problem
In the Euclidean
plane, let O be the origin, and P, Q be two
points not colinear with O. Passing through
P and Q, draw lines parallel to OQ and
O P, respectively, and obtain a parallelogram
O P RQ. Then extend its sides indeﬁnitely,
and draw the two systems of equidistant par-
allel lines, of which O P, QR and OQ, P R
are consecutive pairs, thus dividing the plane
into inﬁnitely many congruent (equal) paral-
lelograms. Such a ﬁgure of lines is called a
lattice. The points of intersection of the lines
are called lattice points.
We choose the lattice whose vertices are
the points in the (x, y)-plane with integer
coordinates. We denote by D the closed re-
gion in the upper right half quadrant con-
tained between the axes and the hyperbola
xy = n, that is, the closed region deﬁned by
xy ≤n, x ≥1 and y ≥1. Let D(n) be the
number of lattice points lying in the closed
region D. Dirichlet proved (1849) that
D(n) = n log n + (2γ −1)n + O(√n),
where γ is the Euler’s constant.
Note that D(n) has another interpretation.
Denote by d(n) the number of divisors of
n, including 1 and n, then D(n) = d(1) +
d(2) + · · · + d(n).
Write D(n) = n log n + (2γ −1)n +
O(nβ). The Dirichlet divisor problem is to
ﬁnd better bounds for the error in the ap-
proximation. Suppose θ is the lower bound
of numbers β. Dirichlet actually showed that
θ ≤1
2. G. Voron¨oi proved (1903) θ ≤1
3, and
van der Corput in 1922 that θ <
33
100, and
these numbers have been improved further
by later mathematicians. On the other hand,
Hardy and Landau independently in 1915
proved that θ ≥
1
4. The true value of θ is
still unknown.
There are many extensions of this prob-
lem.

least upper bound
Let S be a set, and the
relation ≤a partial order on S. Suppose T
is a subset of S. An upper bound of T is
an element b ∈S such that x ≤b for all
x ∈T. A least upper bound of T in S is an
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

upper bound b of T such that if c is another
upper bound of T, then b ≤c. The notation
is b = l.u.b.T, or b = sup T.
Lebesgue area
Let A be a plane domain,
and T be a continuous mapping of A into
the Euclidean space R3. The pair (T, A) is
called a surface. For surfaces (T, A) and
(T ′, A′), and a set B ⊆
A ∩A′, deﬁne
d(T, T ′, B)
=
sup
p∈B
|T (p) −T ′(p)|. Let
(T, A), (T1, A1), (T2, A2), · · · be given. If
An
↑
A, and d(T, Tn, An) →0, then
(Tn, An) (or simply Tn) is said to converge
to (T, A) (or T ), and we write Tn →T .
If A consists of a ﬁnite number of triangles
and T is linear on each triangle, i.e., the im-
age of A under T consists of triangles, then
we replace the notation (T, A) by (P, F),
and denote the area T (A) by a(P, F).
Given a surface (T, A), let ! be the set
of all sequences {(Pn, Fn)} converging to
(T, A). Then the Lebesgue area of (T, A) is
deﬁned to be
L(T, A) = sup
!

Lebesgue decomposition
If µ is a posi-
tive, σ-ﬁnite measure and λ a complex mea-
sure on the same σ-algebra, the Lebesgue
decomposition of λ with respect to µ is
λ = λa + λs,
where λa is absolutely continuous with re-
spect to µ and λs is purely singular with re-
spect to µ.
The Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem
asserts the existence and uniqueness of the
decomposition, under the above hypotheses.
When the measure µ is not speciﬁed, it is as-
sumed to be Lebesgue measure. See absolute
continuity, singular measure.
Lebesgue integral
A real-valued Lebesgue
measurable function φ that assumes only a
ﬁnite number of values, a1, · · · , an, is called
a simple function.
If φ vanishes outside a set of ﬁnite
Lebesgue measure, the integral of φ is de-
ﬁned by

φ(x)dx =
n

i=1
aim(Ai),
where Ai is the set on which φ assumes the
value ai, Ai = {x : φ(x) = ai}, and m(Ai)
is the Lebesgue measure of the set Ai, i =
1, · · · , n.
If E is a Lebesgue measurable set, we de-
ﬁne the integral of φ on E by

E
φ(x)dx =

φ(x) · χE(x)dx,
where χE is the characteristic function of E,
i.e., χE(x) = 1, if x ∈E; 0, elsewhere.
If f is a bounded Lebesgue measurable
function deﬁned on a Lebesgue measur-
able set E with m(E) ﬁnite, we deﬁne the
Lebesgue integral of f over E by

E
f (x)dx = inf

E
φ(x)dx
where the inﬁmum is taken for all simple
functions φ ≥f .
The Lebesgue integral was introduced by
Henri Lebesgue (1902). It generalized the
Riemann integral and overcame some of its
shortcomings. For example, the Lebesgue
integral gives more powerful and useful con-
vergence theorems than the Riemann inte-
gral and it makes the spaces L p complete.
Roughly speaking, the Riemann integral is
calculated by dividing the area under the
graph of a function into vertical rectangles,
while Lebesgue’s theory is to divide the area
horizontally.

Lebesgue measure
Denote the length of

E⊆) In

l(I),
where {In} is any countable collection of
open intervals which cover E, that is, E ⊆
) In, and 
l(I) is the sum of lengths of
the intervals in the collection. The inﬁmum
is taken on all such sums.
A set E ⊆R1 is said to be Lebesgue mea-
surable (due to Carath´eodory) if, for each set
F of R1 we have m∗(F) = m∗(F * E) +
m∗(F * Ec), where Ec is the complement
of E in R1.
If E is a Lebesgue measurable set, we de-
ﬁne the Lebesgue measure m(E) to be the
Lebesgue outer measure of E, i.e., m(E) =
m∗(E).
A Lebesgue measurable function
is a
function f with values in the extended real
numbers, R∪{−∞}∪{∞| whose domain is
a Lebesgue measurable set and such that, for
each real number C, the set {x : f (x) < C}
is Lebesgue measurable.
The Lebesgue measure of an interval is
its length, the Lebesgue measure of any ge-
ometric ﬁgure in R2 is its area, and the
Lebesgue measure of any geometric solid in
R3 is its volume.
Lebesgue outer measure

Lebesgue space
Let (, µ) be a measure
space, and 0 < p < ∞. We say that a func-
tion f (x) on  is of class L p() if f is mea-
surable and the integral of | f (x)|p is ﬁnite.
We consider
two measurable functions to be equiva-
lent if they are equal almost everywhere,
and deﬁne the space L p() to be the set of
equivalence classes. We introduce the norm
∥f ∥p, deﬁned by
∥f ∥p =


| f (x)|p dµ(x)
1/p
.
Then, for 1 ≤p < ∞, L p() is a Banach
space, with the norm ∥f ∥p and for 0 < p <
1, L p() is a metric space with the distance
function
d( f, g) =


| f −g|pdµ.
For any 0 < p < ∞, L p() is called a
Lebesgue space.
Lebesgue’s Convergence Theorem
Sup-
pose that E is a Lebesgue measurable set of
real numbers and the function g is Lebesgue
integrable over E. Let { fn} be a sequence of
Lebesgue measurable functions such that on
E
| fn(x)| ≤g(x)
and such that fn(x) converges to f (x) al-
most everywhere on E. Then

E
f (x)dx = lim
n→∞

The theorem is sometimes called the Domi-
nated Convergence Theorem.
Another convergence theorem of Lebesgue
is the Monotone Convergence Theorem, in
which it is assumed that { fn} are Lebesgue
integrable functions, with f1(x) ≤f2(x) ≤

m(B(x,r))
,
where E is a subset of n-dimensional Eu-
clidian space Rn, B(x,r) denotes the open
ball (with radius r and center x) and m(·) is
Lebesgue measure.
Lebesgue’s Density Theorem states that,
if E ⊆Rn is a Lebesgue measurable set, we
have
D(E, x) = 1 for almost all x ∈E, and
D(E, x) = 0 for almost all x /∈E.
A point x in E with D(E, x) = 1 is called
a point of density for E. Hence the Lebesgue
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

Density Theorem asserts that almost all the
points of E are points of density.
A set E is said to be density open if E
is Lebesgue measurable and D(E, x) = 1
for all x ∈E. The density open sets form
a topology. So the Lebesgue Density The-
orem implies that almost every point of a
Lebesgue measurable set is interior to it (in
the density open topology).
These notions are used to describe ap-
proximate continuity and the approximate
derivative.

Lebesgue’s test
For a function f (x) which
is Lebesgue integrable in (−π, π), denote by
F( f ) its Fourier series. Let ϕx(t) = f (x +

that if

Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral
Suppose that
α(x) is a monotone increasing and right con-
tinuous function on an interval [a, b]. For any
interval I = (x1, x2] ⊂[a, b], we deﬁne an
interval function U(I) = α(x2) −α(x1). It
is nonnegative and countably additive. Us-
ing U(I) we can construct a correspond-
ing outer measure and hence a completely
additive measure. The Lebesgue integral
with respect to this measure is called the
Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral, and is denoted
by
 b
a f (x)dα(x).
Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure
Let f (x) be
a right continuous function of bounded vari-
ation on a closed interval [a, b]. Then f (x)
admits the Jordan decomposition f (x) =
π(x)−ν(x), where π(x) and ν(x) are mono-
tone increasing right continuous functions. It
follows that π(x) and ν(x) induce bounded
measures dπ(x) and dν(x) on [a, b] re-
spectively. See Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral.
The difference dπ −dν of these two mea-
sures is a completely additive set function on
[a, b] which is called the (signed) Lebesgue-
Stieltjes measure induced by f .
left adjoint linear mapping
Let F be a
ﬁeld (not necessarily commutative) with an
antiautomorphism J. For left linear spaces
V, W over F, a mapping ! : V ×W →F is
called a (right) sesquilinear form relative to J
if the following four conditions are satisﬁed:
(i.) !(x + x′, y) = !(x, y) + !(x′, y);
(ii.) !(x, y + y′) = !(x, y) + !(x, y′);
(iii.) !(αx, y) = α!(x, y);
(iv.) !(x, αy) = !(x, y)αJ, for x, x′ ∈
V, y, y′ ∈W, and α ∈F.
Let !′ : V ′ × W ′ →F be another
sesquilinear form relative to J. Then for any
linear mapping u : V →V ′, there exists a
unique linear mapping u∗: W ′ →W such
that
!′(u(x), y′) = !(x, u∗(y′))
for x ∈V and y′ ∈W ′.
This linear mapping u is called the left
adjoint linear mapping of u.

lemniscate
A lemniscate or Bernoulli’s
lemniscate is a two-leaf shaped plane curve.
In a rectangular coordinate system, a typical
equation of a lemniscate is
(x2 + y2)2 = 2a2(x2 −y2),
where a is a constant.
length
A fundamental notion in mathe-
matics, of which many different versions ex-
ist. For example, the length of an interval of
real numbers [a, b] is b −a, the length of a
vector x = (x1, · · · , xn) in Rn is

n
i=1 x2
i ,
etc.. See also arc length, length of curve.
length of curve
Given a curve γ
:
[a, b] →Rk and P = {x0 = a < x1 <
. . . < xn = b} a partition of [a, b], associate
the number
(P, γ ) =
n

n=1
|γ (xi) −γ (xi−1)| .
The ith term in this sum is the distance
(in Rk) between the points γ (xi−1) and
γ (xi) of the curve γ , and the sum is the
length of the polygonal path with vertices at
γ (x0), γ (x1), · · · , γ (xn), in this order.
The length of the curve γ is deﬁned as
(γ ) = sup
P
(P, γ ),
where the supremum is taken over all par-
titions of [a, b]. If (γ ) < ∞, then γ is
called rectiﬁable.
If γ is continuously differentiable, i.e., γ ′
is continuous on [a, b], then γ is rectiﬁable
and
(γ ) =

where
,,γ ′(t)

Leray-Schauder Fixed-Point Theorem
Let D be a bounded open set of a Ba-
nach space X containing the origin O. Let
F(x, t) : D×[0, 1] →X be a compact map-
ping such that F(x, 0) ≡0. Suppose that
F(x, t) ̸= x for any x ∈∂D and t ∈[0, 1].
Then the compact mapping F(x, 1) has a
ﬁxed point x in D. (Here, D is the closure
of D.)

Let u be a harmonic func-
tion. The set {p : u(p) = constant} is called
a level surface of u.
Levi problem
The problem of deciding
whether every pseudoconvex domain is a do-
main of holomorphy.
E.E. Levi proposed this problem. It was
afﬁrmatively solved by Oka (1942, for n =
2, and 1953, for manifolds spread over Cn
for n ≥2), H. Bremermann, and F. Norguet.
The problem was also solved by H. Grauert
in a more general form in 1958 by using re-
sults on linear topological spaces, and by L.
H¨ormander in 1965 by using methods of the
theory of partial differential equations.

a tensor ﬁeld and X a vector ﬁeld (both of

Lifting Theorem
Let T be a contraction
operator on a Hilbert space H and U a unitary
dilation of T , acting on K ⊃H. See unitary
dilation. The Lifting Theorem asserts that if a
bounded operator S commutes with T , then
there exists a dilation V : K →K of S such
that ∥V ∥= ∥S∥and V commutes with U.
limac¸on of Pascal
Suppose r = f1(θ) and
r = f2(θ) are equations of curves C1 and
C2 in polar coordinates. A curve C having
the equation r = λ1 f1(θ) + λ2 f2(θ), where
λ1, λ2 are constants, and C1 is a circle with
center at the origin O, is called a conchoidal
curve of C2 with respect to O. Moreover, if
C2 is a circle and O is on C2, the conchoidal
curve of C2 with respect to O is called a
limac¸on, or limac¸on of Pascal.
The equation of a limac¸on C in a polar
coordinate system having the diameter of a
circle passing through O as its initial line is
r = a cos θ ± b,
while the equation of C with respect to the
Cartesian coordinate system is
(x2 + y2 −ax)2 = b2(x2 + y2).
If a > b, O is a node of the curve, if a =
b, O is a cusp. When a = b, the curve is also
called a cardioid.
limit
A sequence {sn} of real numbers is
said to be convergent to a limit s, written
lim
n→∞sn = s, or sn →s as n →∞, if for
each positive number ε there exists a pos-
itive integer N such that whenever n > N,
we have |sn −s| < ε. The number s is called
the limit of the sequence {sn}.
A sequence {pn} of points in a topologi-
cal space is said to converge to a point p if
for each neighborhood U of p there exists a
positive integer N such that pn ∈U when-
ever n > N. The point p is called a limit
(or a limit point) of the sequence {pn}. Note
that in a Hausdorff topological space if a se-
quence has a limit, then this limit is unique.
For a real-valued function f (x) of a real
variable x deﬁned on a neighborhood of a
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

point c except possibly the point c itself,
if L is a real number, and for each posi-
tive number ε there exists a positive num-
ber δ such that | f (x) −L| < ε holds when-
ever 0 < |x −c| < δ, then we say that
the function f (x) tends to the limit L as x
approaches c. We write lim
x→c f (x) = L or
f (x) →L as x →c.
In the above paragraph replacing 0 <
|x −c| < δ by c < x < c+δ (or c−δ < x <
c), we deﬁne f (x) →L as x →c + 0 (or
as x →c −0). Also write lim
x→c+ f (x) = L
(or lim
x→c−f (x) = L), and call L the limt on
the right (on the left.)
Another notion of convergence is C`esaro
convergence. For a given sequence {sn} of
real numbers, we deﬁne the C`esaro means
of this sequence to be the numbers
σ1 = s1,
σ2 = s1 + s2
2
,
σ3 = s1 + s2 + s3
3
, · · · ,
σn = s1 + · · · + sn
n
, · · · .
If this new sequence {σn} converges to, say,
σ, then the original sequence {sn} is C`esaro
convergent to σ, or convergent in C`esaro
means to σ. The number σ is the limit in
C`esaro means. Note that a sequence {sn}
converges (in the original sense) to L, then
{sn} also converges to σ in C`esaro means,
but not vice versa.
limit in the mean
A sequence { fn} in
L p() (1 ≤p < ∞) is said to converge to
f in the mean, if lim
n→∞∥fn −f ∥p = 0. The
function f is called the limit in the mean,
sometimes written as f = l.i.m. fn.
limit of an indeterminate form
The limit
of an algebraic expression (as x →a), such
that, substituting x = a in the expression
is not deﬁned. Thus, the expression may as-
sume the form 0/0, ∞/∞, 0∞, etc., when
x = a.
For example, let f (x) = cos x and g(x) =
x−π
2 , then lim
x→π
2
f (x) = lim
x→π
2
g(x) = 0, and
the limit of the quotient f (x)
g(x) is of the form
0/0, when x = π
2 , and f (x)
g(x) has an indeter-
minate form.
Other indeterminate forms are 0·∞, ∞−
∞, 00, ∞0, and 1∞.
The limit of an indeterminate form can
sometimes be found by a special algebraic
or geometric manipulation. However, if the
functions involved are appropriately differ-
entiable, L’Hˆopital’s Rule is more conve-
niently applied to solve the limit. In the above
example f ′(x) = −sin x, g′(x) = 1, and
L’Hˆopital’s Rule implies that lim
x→π

Lindel¨of’s Asymptotic Value Theorem
Let f (z) be a complex-valued function that is
holomorphic and bounded in a closed an-
gular domain D = {z : α ≤arg z ≤β}, ex-
cept for the point at inﬁnity. Suppose that
f (z) →a as z →∞along one side of the
angle and that f (z) →b as z →∞along the
other side of it. Then a = b and f (z) →a
uniformly as z →∞in D.

Lindel¨of’s Theorem
Let D be a domain in
the complex plane. Suppose that there exists
an arc of angular measure α that is on a circle
of radius R centered at a point z0 of D and not
contained in D. Let C denote the intersection
of the boundary of D with the disk |z −z0| <
R. If f (z) is a single-valued holomorphic
function that satisﬁes | f (z)| ≤M, and if
lim sup
z→ζ
| f (z)| ≤M for every ζ ∈C, then the
inequality | f (z0)| ≤M1−1/nm1/n holds for
every positive integer n satisfying 2π/n ≤α.

line
In Euclidian space R3, the locus of
the equation γ (t) = (x0+at, y0+bt, z0+ct)
is a straight line which passes through the
point (x0, y0, z0) and parallel to the vector
(a, b, c).
More generally, the term line may refer to
a curve, a continuous mapping γ of an inter-
val [a, b] into Rn.
Historically, Euclid distinguished straight
lines and curves. A straight line in space is
determined by any two points on it. How-
ever, nowadays, lines in the sense of Euclid
are called curves, and a straight line is con-
sidered a curve. C. Jordan was the ﬁrst math-
ematician to give an exact deﬁnition of a
curve by using analytic method in his Cours
d’ analyse I (1893).
Older treatises may refer to right lines in-
stead of straight lines.
line element
Let M be a 1-dimensional
differentiable manifold and f : M →Rn
an immersion. Let x be a point in Rn and
e1, · · · en orthonormal vectors in Rn. Denote
the tangent space of M at x by Mx. For
X ∈Mx, the form ds deﬁned by ds(X) =
(d f (X), e1) is called the line element, which
is used in the theory of curves in differential
geometry.
line integral
(1.) Let γ be a smooth curve
in a region  ⊂R2, with a parameterization
x = φ(t), y = ψ(t)(a ≤t ≤b) and ω =
A(x, y)dx + B(x, y)dy a 1-form in . The
line integral of ω over γ is deﬁned by

γ
ω =
 b
a
[A(γ (t))φ′(t)+B(γ (t))ψ′(t)]dt.
(2.) For a continuous function w = f (z) in
a region  in the complex plane C and γ a
curve in , Let z0, z1, . . . zn be a subdivision
of γ and, for each j, let ζ j ∈γ , between
z j−1 and z j, and form the sum
In =
n

j=1
f (ζ j)(z j −z j−1).
Then f is integrable over γ if there is a num-
ber I such that, for every ϵ > 0 there is δ > 0
such that the sum In is closer to I than ϵ
whenever max |z j −z j−1| < δ. Then I is
called the line integral of f over γ , denoted
I =

f (z)dz.
line of curvature
In the theory of curves in
differential geometry, a curve C on a surface
such that the tangent line at each point of the
curve coincides with a principal direction at
the point.
line of regression
In the theory of curves
and surfaces in differential geometry, at each
point of a space curve C we deﬁne the os-
culating plane, and the family of osculating
planes of C envelops a developable surface S
and coincides with the locus of tangent lines
to C. The surface S is called the tangent sur-
face of C, and C itself is called the line of
regression of S.

used as approximations to solutions of more
general ones. See linear system, linear oper-
ator, linear combination.

Let P be an afﬁne
space of dimension n. A frame f in P is a
list f0, . . . , fn of n +1 points of P such that
the vectors f1−f0, . . . , fn −f0 form a basis
of P# the vector space of all transformations
of P. Relative to a frame f , each point can
be written as
p = [( f1 −f0)ξ1 + · · · + ( fn −f0)ξn] + f0
for a unique list α of n scalars. These scalars
are called the linear coordinates of the point
p relative to the frame f .

tors x1,x2, · · · , xn in a vector space V
over a ﬁeld F that there exist scalars
α1, α2, · · · , αn, not all equal 0, such that
α1x1 + α2x2 + · · · + αnxn = 0.
Vectors x1,x2, · · · , xn of V are called lin-
early independent if they are not linearly de-
pendent. That is, α1x1+α2x2+· · ·+αnxn =
0, only if α1 = α2 = · · · = αn = 0.
linear discriminant function

tion t = aT X, where X is the matrix of obser-
vation, a is a vector and aT is the transpose of
a which is to be determined so that if there are
k observation populations Xi, i = 1, · · · , k,
then the vector a can reveal the differences
of these k populations in a sense that this is
the best possible one. This notion appears in
the multivariate analysis of statistics.

where p0(x), p1(x), · · · , pn(x) and

In global analysis,
consider a nonlinear differential operator
on a ﬁnite-dimensional manifold. By us-

happens that its domain is neither a linear

linear operator can be regarded as a differen-

manifolds. The differential at a point in that
source manifold is called a linearized opera-
tor, to which one can apply various theorems
of linear functional analysis.

Lipschitz condition
The condition | f (s)
−f (t)| ≤M |s −t|α, (for x, y ∈I), for
a real or complex valued function f , on an
interval I. More precisely called a Lipschitz
condition of order α.
A real function satisfying the Lipschitz
condition is absolutely continuous, and hence
differentiable almost everywhere in the inter-
val I.
Lipschitz space
The set Lipα(I), of real-
valued functions f satisfying a Lipschitz
condition of order α on I (0 < α < 1,
and I an interval of real numbers). That is,
f
∈Lipα(I) if there exists a constant c
such that | f (x) −f (y)| ≤c |x −y|α for
all x, y in I. The smallest such constant c is
called the Lip α norm of f and is denoted by
∥f ∥Lipα. Endowed with this norm Lipα(I)
becomes a Banach space provided we iden-
tify functions which differ by a constant al-
most everywhere in I.

Metric Comparison Theorem
On a semi-

connection D such that
(1.) [V, W] = DV W −DW V , and
(2.) X(V, W) = (DX V, W)+(V, DX W)
for all X, V, W ∈χ(M). D is called the
Levi–Civita connection of M, and is char-
acterized by the Koszul formula
2(DV W, X) = V (W, X) + W(X, V )
−X(V, W) −(V, [W, X])
+(W, [X, V ]) + (X, [V, W]).
DV W is the covariant derivative of W with
respect to V for the connection D; [V, W]
is the bracket of V and W; χ(M) is the set
of all smooth vector ﬁelds on M, and ( , )
denotes metric tensor.
The above theorem has been called the

2. Dt(aX + bY) = aDt X + bDtY,
3. Dt( f X) = (t f )X(n) + ( f n)Dt X,
4. The vector ﬁelds DZ X over µ deﬁned by
(DZ X)(n) = DZ(n)X is C∞.
A connection D on a map µ : N →M is said
to be compatible with the metric ⟨, ⟩on µ or
is a metric connection if parallel translation
along curves in N preserves inner products.

ing the points (possibly even poles of the qi)
a1, . . . , am. Fix a0 distinct from a1, . . . , am,
let U be a simply connected neighborhood
of a0, and consider the differential equation
w(n) + q1(z)w(n−1) + · · · + qn(z)w = 0.

Let γ j be a simple, closed curve starting and
ending at a0 which traverses around a j in
a positive orientation. Continuing w(z) an-
alytically along γ j we get the fundamental
system of solutions
γ jw(z) = w j(z) = w(z)Tj
where Tj is a constant, nonsingular n × n

Monodromy Theorem
Suppose f (z) is
analytic in a ﬁnite domain D and that D is
bounded by a simple, closed curve C. Sup-
pose further that f is continuous in D ∪C,
and f is single-valued for each z on C. Then
f is single-valued for every z ∈D.

If
lim

is the same for all paths in the complex
plane, then f (z) is said to be monogenic at
z0. Monogenic, therefore, essentially means
having a single derivative at a point. Func-
tions are either monogenic or have inﬁnitely
many derivatives (in which case they are
called polygenic); intermediate cases are not
possible.

abuse of terminology in dealing with map-
pings such as the above example.

=
(y1, y2, . . . , yn), X′ = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) with
Z′ and Y ′ k2 × n matrices and X′ a k1 × n
matrix.
We assume that:
(a.) the zi are independent normal random
k2×1 matrices (vectors) with zero mean and
common covariance matrix ,,
(b.) the xi j, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, j = 1, 2, . . . ,

(d.) B = B1 and B = B2 are parameter ma-
trices speciﬁed respectively by the hypothe-
ses H1 and H2,
(e.) the yi are stochastic k2 ×1 matrices, and
E1(Y) = X B1′, E2(Y) = X B2′.

natural equation of a surface
An equa-
tion which speciﬁes a curve independent of
any choice of coordinates or parameteriza-
tion. The study of natural equations began
with the following problem: given two func-
tions of one parameter, ﬁnd the space curve
for which the functions are the curvature and
torsion.
Euler gave an integral solution for plane
curves (which always have torsion τ = 0).
Call the angle between the tangent line to the
curve and the x-axis φ, the tangential angle,
then
φ =

κ(s) ds,
where κ is the curvature. Then the equations
κ = κ(s),
τ = 0,
where τ is the torsion, are solved by the
curve with parametric equations
x =

cos φ ds
y =

sin φ ds.
The equations κ = κ(s) and τ = τ(s) are
called the natural (or intrinsic) equations of
the space curve.
An equation expressing a plane curve in
terms of s and radius of curvature R (or κ)
is called a Ces`aro equation, and an equation
expressing a plane curve in terms of s and φ
is called a Whewell equation.
Among the special planar cases which can
be solved in terms of elementary functions
are the circle, logarithmic spiral, circle in-
volute, and epicycloid. Enneper showed that
each of these is the projection of a helix on
a conic surface of revolution along the axis
of symmetry. The above cases correspond to
the cylinder, cone, paraboloid, and sphere.

be F∗TX/TY .

A circle which is tan-
gent to a smooth curve at a point, lies on the
same side of the tangent line to the curve as

outer area
An upper estimate for the area

Pappus’s Theorem
If a region R

is equal to the product of the area of the re-
gion and the distance moved by the centroid
of the region.

One of the conic sections. A
parabola is obtained by intersecting a right
circular cone with a plane which is parallel
to a straight line in the surface of the cone.
Alternately, a parabola is obtained by taking
all points equidistant to a ﬁxed point (the fo-
cus) and a ﬁxed straight line (the directrix).
In a Cartesian coordinate plane, after a suit-
able rotation, a parabola is the graph of a
quadratic function, y = ax2 + bx + c. See
also conic section.
parabolic coordinates
Coordinates (u, v)
for the plane which are related to Cartesian
coordinates by the formulas:
x = u2 −v2

,
y = uv.
The coordinate curves for parabolic coordi-
nates consist of two families of mutually or-
thogonal parabolas.
parabolic cylinder
A generalized cylin-
der set whose cross section is a parabola. Ex-

revolution will reﬂect light emanating from a
source at the focus as a beam parallel to the
axis of symmetry. In reverse, an antenna in
the shape of a paraboloid of revolution can
be used to concentrate at the focus: electro-
magnetic radiation from a distant source.

Let D =
{reiθ : r ≥0, |θ| < α < π}, for some
α. Let A, B, C, δ be positive constants with
0 < δ < π/(2α). Assume f is analytic on D
and continuous on D. If | f (z)| ≤A on the

Picard group
The group of locally prin-
cipal divisors on a variety V modulo the sub-
group of principal divisors; denoted Pic(V).
Picard variety
Let V be a variety, and
write G(V ) for the set of divisors, Gl(V ) for
the set of divisors linearly equivalent to 0,
and Ga(V ) for the group of divisors alge-
braically equal to 0. Then Ga(V )/Gl(V ) is
called the Picard variety. The Albanese va-
riety is dual to the Picard variety.

Let f be an analytic
function with an essential singularity at a

plex number except possibly one number;
furthermore, on D, f assumes each com-
plex number, except possibly one, an inﬁnite
number of times.

Pl¨ucker coordinates
Consider a (straight)
line L on the afﬁne plane over a ﬁeld K. L is
the set of all solutions of an algebraic equa-
tion of degree 1, such as
u0 + u1x1 + u2x2 = 0.
The coefﬁcients u0, u1, u2
∈
K are the
Pl¨ucker
coordinates
of
L.
All
triplets
(u0, u1, u2) are permitted, except those with
u1 = u2 = 0; these would not describe
a nontrivial condition. On the other hand,
the coordinates of a straight line are not
unique, since multiplication of the ui by a
ﬁxed nonzero scalar λ ∈K merely replaces
the above polynomial equation of the line
by an equivalent one. The transition from
(u0, u1, u2) to (λu0, λu1, λu2) with λ ∈K ∗
is called rescaling. Pl¨ucker coordinates are
only determined up to an arbitrary rescaling.
Pl¨ucker’s relations
Relationships be-
tween the number of singularities of plane
algebraic curves. For a given plane curve,
m = n(n −1) −2δ −3κ
n = m(m −1) −2τ −3ι
ι = 3n(n −2) −6δ −8κ
κ = 3m(m −2) −6τ −8ι,
where m is the class, n the order, δ the number
of nodes, κ the number of cusps, ι the num-
ber of stationary tangents (inﬂection points),
and τ the number of bitangents. Only three
of these equations are linearly independent.

u = 0,

This is equivalent to the requirement that on
every complex line, {a + bz : z ∈C}, de-
termined by a, b ∈Cn, the function z →
u(a + bz) is harmonic on {z : a + bz ∈D}.
plurisubharmonic function
A real val-
ued function, u, on a domain D ⊆Cn such
that:
1) −∞≤u(z) < ∞, all z ≤0;
2) u(z) is upper semi-continuous and not
constantly equal to −∞; and
3) if z, w ∈Cn and if r > 0 is such that
{z + sw : s ∈C and |s| ≤r, } ⊆D, then

By condition 3), on every complex line,
{z + sw : s ∈C}, determined by z, w ∈Cn,
the function s →u(z + sw) is subharmonic
on {s ∈C : z + sw ∈D}.
Plurisubharmonic functions play a role in
several complex variables analogous to the
role of subharmonic functions in the theory
of one complex variable. Examples include
log | f | and | f |c, c > 0, where f is holo-
morphic on D. For functions on D with con-

joined to a locally compact topological space,
X, in forming the one point compactiﬁcation
of X. In particular, when X is the com-
plex plane, the addition of a point at inﬁnity
yields a space homeomorphic to a sphere.

tion of the form,

Poisson bracket
A skew symmetric, bilin-
ear form which assigns a smooth, real-valued
function, {F, G}, to each pair of smooth,
real-valued functions on a smooth manifold
and which satisﬁes the Jacobi identity:
{{F, G}, H} + {{H, F}, G}
+{{G, H}, F} = 0
and Leibnitz’ rule:
{F, GH} = {F, G}H + G{F, H}.
When F and G are functions of conﬁguration

Polynomial Approximation Theorem
Every continuous function on a compact sub-
set, X, of Rn can be uniformly approximated
on X by a polynomial function. See Weier-
strass’s Theorem. For a far reaching general-
ization, See Stone-Weierstrass Theorem.

A function of the
form f (x) = anxn + . . . + a1x + a0, where
an, . . . , a0 are either real or complex con-
stants and x is either a real or a complex
variable. There are extensions of this con-
cept to multi-variable functions and to func-
tions whose domains are more complicated
systems, such as matrices or operators on
Hilbert space. For example, a monomial
in n variables is a function of the form

If k is measurable and positive deﬁnite on a
measure space, (X, µ), then the correspond-
ing integral operator on L2(X, µ) is a positive
operator.
positive distribution
A distribution T
such that T (φ) ≥0 for every nonnegative
φ ∈C∞
0 (Rn). See generalized function.
positive harmonic function
See harmonic
function.
positive inﬁnity
A concept useful for de-
scribing the limit of a quantity that grows
without bound. For example, a function
f (x) is said to approach positive inﬁnity
(+∞) as x approaches a, written
lim
x→a f (x) = +∞
provided, given any number M, there exists
a δ > 0, for which f (x) > M holds for all x
satisfying |x −a| < δ.
Other uses of +∞are to describe the car-
dinality or size of a non-ﬁnite set or to indi-
cate the sum of an inﬁnite series. For exam-
ple, the notation +∞
n=1
1
2n = 1 means that
the sum of:
1
2, 1
4, 1
8, . . . , 1
2N
converges to the number 1, as N approaches
+∞.
positive orientation
Given a circle C in
the plane, or, more generally, any simple
closed curve C, we can think of a particle
as traveling around the curve (without stop-
ping) in one of two possible directions. If
the particle travels in the counter-clockwise
direction we say that C has positive orienta-
tion, otherwise it has negative orientation.
More precisely, the movement of the par-
ticle should be described by a parametric
representation (x(t), y(t)) of C and then
the orientation is determined by these repre-
senting functions. See Green’s Theorem and
Cauchy’s integral theorem for important ex-
amples using this concept.
positive semideﬁnite kernel
Let (X, , µ)
be a measure space and suppose that k :
X × X →C is an  × -measurable func-
tion. Deﬁne a linear operator
(K f )(x) =

X
k(x, y) f (y) dµ(y)
on L2(µ). If the operator K is bounded on
the Hilbert space L2(µ) and satisﬁes:
(K f, f ) =

X

X
k(x, y) f (y) f (x) dydx
≥0
for all f ∈L2(µ), then we say that the op-
erator K is a positive semideﬁnite operator
and the function k is a positive semideﬁnite
kernel.
positive variation
(1.) A function P as-
sociated with a given function f of bounded
variation which is deﬁned by P(x)
=
1
2 [T (x) + f (x)], where T is the total vari-
ation of f .
(2.) Let µ be a real measure on a σ-algebra
M. Associated with µ are three positive
measures: the positive variation µ+, the neg-
ative variation µ−and the total variation |µ|.
They have the following properties:
µ = µ+ −µ−,
|µ| = µ+ + µ−
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

and for every measurable set E
−|µ|(E) ≤µ(E) ≤|µ|(E).
This representation of µ as a difference of
positive measures is known as the Jordan de-
composition of µ.
power series
A formal inﬁnite series of
the form:
a0 + a1(x −a) + a2(x −a)2 + . . . .
If the series converges for any x ̸= a, then it
typically converges absolutely on an interval
a−ρ < x < a+ρ, if x is a real variable, and
in an open disk |x −a| < ρ, if x is a complex
variable. The optimum value ρ is called the
radius of convergence of the power series.
Some important examples are:
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + . . .
sin x = x −x3
3! + x5
5! + . . .
where ρ = +∞in both cases, i.e., the for-
mula holds for all real x. The formulas also
hold if x is replaced by z and z is allowed to
be any complex number.
pre-Hilbert space
A complex vector
space with an inner product. That is, a com-
plex vector space H with a complex func-
tion (x, y), called the inner product of x and
y, deﬁned on H × H. The inner product
should be linear in the ﬁrst variable and sat-
isfy: (x, y) = (y, x). Also, (x, x) ≥0 with
the value 0 only for the zero vector x = 0.
The norm of a vector x is deﬁned by
∥x∥= (x, x)1/2. Thanks to the triangle in-
equality
∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+ ∥y∥
an inner product space becomes a metric
space with the metric:
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥.
A Hilbert space is a normed linear space
which is complete in this metric.
Preparation Theorem
Let f (z) be an an-
alytic function in a neighborhood of the ori-
gin. If f (0) = 0 but f is not identically zero,
then
f (z) = zkg(z)
where g(z) is analytic in a neighborhood of
the origin and g(0) ̸= 0. This decomposition
is unique and the integer k is called the order
of the zero of f at the origin.
See Weierstrass’s Preparation Theorem
for the analogous situation for analytic func-
tions in several complex variables.
prime divisor
Let n be a natural number.
A natural number m is said to be a divisor of
n, written m|n, if n = km for some natural
number k. A prime divisor of n is a divisor
of n which is also prime.
Prime Number Theorem
The famous
Prime Number Theorem was proved in the
late 1800s and concerns the distribution of
prime numbers (natural numbers p, with no
factors other than p and 1). Let N(x) be the
number of primes between 1 and x. The the-
orem says that:
lim
x→∞
N(x) log x
x
= 1.
Thus, the number of primes less than x is
approximately
x
log x for large x. So the num-
ber of primes is inﬁnite but represents a very
small proportion of the integers less than x
for large values of x.
primitive function
The primitive of a
function f (x) is any function F(x) satisfy-
ing F′(x) = f (x). In other words, a primi-
tive function is an antiderivative or indeﬁnite
integral of f (x). In symbols,
F(x) =

f (x) dx.
See Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for
the existence and uniqueness of the an-
tiderivative.
principal analytic set
An analytic set in
Cn is a set which is locally the set where
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

ﬁnitely many holomorphic functions vanish.
In the case that the analytic set is generated
by a single holomorphic function, then the
set is called a principal analytic set. See ﬁrst
Cousin problem and second Cousin problem
for more information on the structure of an-
alytic sets.
principal axis
Let A be a real symmet-
ric n × n matrix with n distinct eigenvalues.
Consider the quadratic form:
q(x) = x · Ax.
Thus, for
A =
a b
b c

x =
 x1
x2

we have q(x) = ax2
1 + 2bx1x2 + cx2
2.
The curve
ax2
1 + 2bx1x2 + cx2
2 = 1
will be an ellipse with major and minor
axes obtained by rotating the x1 and x2 axes
through some angle. The rotated axes are
called the principal axes for the quadratic
form.
The vector directions of these axes turn
out to be eigenvectors for A. In general, the
eigenspaces of A are called the principal
axes of q.
principal bundle
Let G be a Lie group.
A (smooth) principal bundle with structure
group G is a pair (P, T ), where
(i.) P = (Q, π, B, G) is a smooth ﬁber bun-
dle.
(ii.) T : Q ×G →Q is a right action of G on
P.
(iii.) P admits a coordinate representation
{(Ua, ψa)} such that
ψa(x, ab) = ψa(x, a) · b,
x ∈Ua, a, b ∈G.
(Note that we write T (z, a) = z · a.)
principal component analysis
Let A be
a Banach algebra. The set of invertible ele-
ments forms a group G under multiplication.
In fact, this is a topological group since mul-
tiplication and inversion are continuous in G.
As a topological space, G has a connected
component G1 containing the identity ele-
ment of A. This set is called the principal
component of G and consists of all con-
nected subsets of G that contain the identity
element e in A.
An elementary example of principal com-
ponent analysis is the following simpliﬁed
version of the Arens-Royden Theorem for
commutative Banach algebras. Suppose that
A is the Banach algebra of all continuous
complex valued functions on the unit circle in
the complex plane. Then, the quotient group
G/G1, in this case, is isomorphic to the addi-
tive group of integers. Moreover, two invert-
ible members of A are in the same coset of G1
if and only if they are homotopic mappings.
principal curvature
A particle traveling
in space with position vector R(t), at time t,
will have a unit tangent vector T(t), princi-
pal normal vector N(t) and curvature κ. See
principal normal. For a unit speed curve, κ is
the length of the component of R′′(t) in the
direction of N(t).
Now suppose we are given a surface S
and point p0 ∈S. Let n0 be the surface nor-
mal at p0. Consider particles traveling on S
at unit speed and passing through the point
p0 at t = 0. The normal curvature of the
surface S at p0, in the direction of the tangent
vector T(0), is the component of R′′(0) in the
direction n0. It turns out that this quantity,
denoted by κn, depends only on the direc-
tion of the path at p0 and hence is a property
of the surface.
The maximum and minimum values κn,
corresponding to all tangent vectors, are
called the principal curvatures of the surface
at the point p0. The corresponding directions
on which these extreme values are attained
are called the principal directions.
principal directions

ture.

principal divisor
Let X be a complex
manifold and OX its structural sheaf. Let M
be the sheaf of meromorphic functions on X,
Pic(X) the Picard group of X and Div(X)
the group of Weil divisors on X. For each
meromorphic function on X, we can asso-
ciate a Weil divisor by taking its zeros and
poles and so we get a map
H0(X, M∗/O∗
X) →Div(X).
The map is an isomorphism and gives rise to
the exact sequence
H0(X, M∗) →Div(X) →H1(X, O∗
X)
→H1(X, M∗).
The image of H0(X, M∗) in this sequence
is the group of principal divisors.
principal normal
A particle traveling in
space with position vector R(t), at time t,
will have a unit tangent vector T(t). The
principal normal vector, written N(t) is de-
ﬁned by:
N(t) =
T′(t)
∥T′(t)∥.
It turns out that these two vectors are per-
pendicular to each other and the plane they
determine is called the osculating plane.
This plane has the greatest contact with the
curve at the point R(t) and best describes the
motion at time t. The bending of the curved
path in this plane is called the curvature. It
is deﬁned by
κ =
0000
dT
ds

and can be used to determine the centipetal
force on the particle by means of the formula:
FN = mκ

principal part
Suppose that we are given
an nth order linear partial differential opera-
tor on Rm
D( f ) =

0≤|α|≤n
cα∂α f
where α = (α1, . . . , αm) and ∂α f denote
the derivative of f
∂α
1
∂x1α
1
∂α
2
∂x2α
2
· · · ∂α
n f
∂xnαn
.
Then, the principal part of the operator is
the sum of the nth order terms, i.e.,
D1( f ) =

|α|=n
cα∂α f
where |α| = n
1 α j. The idea is that the main
properties of the operator can be derived
from the highest order terms.
principal value
For a multiple-valued
function, a designated choice of values in a
particular subset of the domain where the re-
striction is single-valued.
For example, for a ﬁxed value y, −1 ≤
y ≤1, there are inﬁnitely many solutions
to the equation: sin x = y. But, there is a
unique solution with −π
2 ≤x ≤
π
2 . This
solution is called the principal value for the
inverse sine function (or arcsine function).
Thus, the principal value for arcsin 1
2 is π
6
and yet sin( 5π
6 ) = 1
2.
For the complex logarithm, the domain
for the principal value is usually chosen to be
the complex plane with the negative real axis
removed, and the principal value of log(z)
in this domain, sometimes denoted Log(z)
is log |z|+i arg(z), with −π < arg(z) ≤π.
See also Cauchy principal value.
principle of linearized stability
A prin-
ciple giving conditions under which a non-
linear dynamical system is asymptotically
stable near a ﬁxed point. In other words,
when a slightly perturbed initial state will
eventually return to the equilibrium state. As
an example, the linear system
d ⃗x
dt = A⃗x(t)
where A is an n × n real matrix, will be
asymptotically stable at the origin provided
that each eigenvalue λ satisﬁes ℜλ < 0.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

principle of localization
If two functions
(real valued, on [0, 2π]) are equal in an in-
terval I ⊂[0, 2π] then the difference of
their Fourier series converges to 0 on any in-
terval I ′ contained in the interior of I. The
difference of their conjugate series also con-
verges in I ′, but not necessarily to 0. Thus
the convergence of Fourier series is a local
phenomenon (Riemann’s Principle of Local-
ization).
principle of nested intervals
A sequence
of closed bounded intervals [an, bn] of real
numbers, where n = 1, 2, . . ., such that
−∞< an−1 ≤an ≤bn ≤bn−1 < ∞.
A fundamental property of the real numbers
is that there exists a real number x0 which
belongs to all the intervals, i.e., an ≤x0 ≤
bn for all n = 1, 2, . . ..
principle of superposition
Consider a
second order linear differential equation of
the form
y′′ + p(x)y′ + q(x)y = 0.
A solution to this equation is a twice differen-
tiable function y = y(x) which satisﬁes the
above equation for all x. Given two solutions
y1(x) and y2(x) one sees that a third solution
is obtained from the linear combination
y = c1y(x) + c2y2(x),
where c1, c2 are arbitrary real constants.
The principle of superposition states that
every solution to the equation is of the above
form provided that neither y1 nor y2 is a con-
stant multiple of the other. For example, ev-
ery solution to y′′ + y = 0 is a linear combi-
nation of sin x and cos x.
More generally, an nth order, linear,
homogeneous differential equation can be
solved by ﬁnding a system of n linearly in-
dependent solutions y1, . . . , yn and forming
the linear combination
y = c1y1 + · · · + cnyn.
Pringsheim’s Theorem
A continued frac-
tion is an expression of the form
a1
b1 +
a2
b2+...
,
which is understood to be the limit of the se-
quence:
a1,
a1
b1 + a2
,
a1
b1 +
a2
b2+a3
, . . . .
Pringsheim’s Theorem states that the above
sequence converges provided |bn| ≥|an|+1
for all n = 1, 2, . . .. A well-known example
is to take an = 1, bn = 2 for all n; then
the resulting continued fractions converge to
√
2 −1.
progression
Two common propagation
patterns for numerical sequences are
(i.) arithmetic progressions, which are of the
form
a, a + x, a + 2x, a + 3x, . . .
and
(ii.) geometric progressions, which are of the
form
a, ax, ax2, ax3, . . . ,
where in both cases a and x are arbitrary
numbers.
For example, the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, . . .
is an arithmetic progression whereas the se-
quence 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . is a geometric progres-
sion. Thus, the inﬁnite series
∞

n=0
1
2n = 1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + . . . = 2
is called a geometric series because the terms
in the series are a geometric progression.
projection on a line
The projection of a
point p0 on a line l is the unique point p ∈
l which minimizes the distance between p0
and l. In geometry, this point is determined
by constructing a line perpendicular to l and
passing through p0. The point of intersection
between these lines is the point p.

point p0 on a plane $ is the unique point p ∈
$ which minimizes the distance between p0
and $. In geometry, this point is determined
by constructing a line perpendicular to $ and
passing through p0. The point of intersection
between this line and the plane is the point p.
projection operator
An operator from a
vector space X onto a linear subspace E,
which satisﬁes Px = x, for all x ∈E,
and P2x = Px, for all x ∈X. If X is a
Hilbert space and P is a self-adjoint operator
on X, then P is called an orthogonal projec-
tion operator onto E. A Hilbert space projec-
tion which is not an orthogonal projection is
sometimes called a projector.
projective coordinates
The projective
plane P is an object of study in the theory
of projective geometry. It can deﬁned as the
set of lines through the origin or directions in
three-dimensional space R3. In other words,
the point S ∈P of the projective plane is
determined by a triple (x1, x2, x3) of real
numbers, where this triple is assumed not to
be the origin. We call these triples, with the
identiﬁcation
(x1, x2, x3) = (cx1, cx2, cx3),
c ̸= 0
homogeneous coordinates of the point S.
This mapping of P into the set of homoge-
neous coordinates is called the projective co-
ordinate system.
The projective plane can be thought of as
the projective space associated with the vec-
tor space R3. In a similar manner, there are
projective spaces associated with any vector
space.
projective geometry
Given two distinct
planes $, $′ and a central point O not be-
longing to either, one can project a point
p ∈$ to a unique point p′ ∈$′. The point
p′ is the intersection of the line determined
by the points O, p, and the plane $.
Projections of this kind are called central
projections. Notice that lines project to lines
and triangles project to triangles. But a circle
typically projects to an ellipse.
Projective geometry is the study of geo-
metric properties of ﬁgures that are preserved
under central projections. As an example, it
can be proved that every conic projects to an-
other conic (although not necessarily of the
same type).
projective line element
Let K be a ground
ﬁeld. If we denote by P1K (=
P1(K))
(= K ∪{∞}) the one-dimensional projec-
tive line (space) over K, then its points are
the one-dimensional subspaces of K 2 called
projective line elements.
projective set
A member of the σ-algebra
generated by the projections of coanalytic
sets in a Polish space. See analytic set.
projective transformation
Given a vec-
tor space E, we can deﬁne the projective
space P(E) associated with E as the set of
lines through the origin in E. See projective
coordinates. Given a one-to-one linear trans-
formation u : E →F to a vector space F
we get a mapping
P(u) : P(E) →P(F)
determined by the homogeneous coordinates.
This mapping is called a projective trans-
formation if it is bijective, that is, if
dim P(E) equals dim P(F).
prolate spheroid
An ellipsoid produced
by rotating an ellipse through a complete
revolution about its longer axis is called a
prolate spheroid or a prolate ellipsoid.
proper convex function
A convex func-
tion on Rn is any continuous function real-
valued function f (x) satisfying:
f
x + y
2

≤f (x) + f (y)
2
for all x, y ∈Rn.
For example, any linear (or even afﬁne
linear) function is convex because the above
relation holds with an equality.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

A proper convex function is one that sat-
isﬁes the above relation with a strict inequal-
ity. For n = 1, this condition will hold
for any twice differentiable function with
f ′′(x) > 0 for all x ∈R.
proper equivalence relation
See equiva-
lence relation. A proper equivalence relation
is one which makes an actual distinction be-
tween objects.
Thus, the relation among integers that a
is related to b if and only if their difference
is either an odd or an even integer makes no
distinction at all. On the other hand, if we
require the difference to be an even integer,
then we partition the set of all integers into
two distinct classes; i.e., the even integers
and the odd integers.
proportionality
Two quantities x and y
are said to be proportional provided each
one is a constant multiple of the other, i.e.,
the relation y = kx holds, with k ̸= 0.
As an example, one says that the circum-
ference C of a circle is proportional to its ra-
dius r. The familiar formula is C = 2πr so
the constant of proportionality in this case is
k = 2π.
pseudo-differential operator
A pseudo-
differential operator is a mapping f

where
ˆf (ξ) =

is the Fourier transform of f , and where
a(x, ξ) is the symbol of T .
In the special case
a(xξ) =

pseudo-Riemannian metric
A Rieman-
nian metric is an inner product on the tan-
gent vectors to a smooth manifold or surface
which gives a way of measuring “lengths”
and “angles” of tangent vectors. See Rie-
mannian metric.
A pseudo-Riemannian metric is similar
except that the restriction that the inner
product be positive is dropped. Instead,
it assumed that the bilinear form is non-
degenerate, meaning that the only vector or-
thogonal to everything is the zero vector.
Lorentz metrics form an important example
of a pseudo-Riemannian metric.
pseudoconvex domain
See Levi pseudo-
convex domain.
pseudodistance
A real-valued function d
on X × X, for a topological space X, which
satisﬁes the axioms of a metric, except that
d(p, q) may = 0 for certain p, q ∈X with
p ̸= q. See Carath´eodory pseudodistance,
Kobayashi pseudodistance.
pseudolength
A nonnegative real-valued
function F on a vector space X satisfying
F(av) = |a|F(v), for a ∈C and v ∈X.
pseudosphere
The pseudosphere is the
surface of revolution obtained by rotating the
parametric curve
x(t) = sin t
z(t) = log tan t
2 + cos t
for 0 < t < π
2 about the z-axis. The resulting
surface has constant Gaussian curvature −1
and is used as a model for hyperbolic or non-
Euclidean geometry.

pullback
(1.) Pullback diagram. Given
sets A1, A2, K and maps α1 : A1 →K, α2 :
A2 →K, the pullback is a set B, together
with maps β1 : B →A1, β2 : B →A2 such
that
(i.) α1β1 = α2β2, and
(ii.) if C is another set, with maps γ j : C →
A j( j = 1, 2) satisfying α1γ1 = α2γ2, then
there is a unique map δ : C →B with
β jδ = γ j( j = 1, 2).
Normally, the sets are objects and the
maps are morphisms in some category. Pull-
backs exist in Abelian categories and in
some others such as the category of Hilbert
modules.
(2.) Pullback bundle. Given a map F : Y →
X between two complex manifolds and E a
vector bundle over X, deﬁned by a covering
{Uα} of X and corresponding cocycle {gαβ},
the pullback bundle on Y, denoted F∗E, is
deﬁned by the cover {F−1(Uα)} and the co-
cycle {gαβ ◦F}.
purely contractive analytic operator func-
tion
A function C(z), whose values are
contraction operators from one Hilbert space
H to another Hilbert space H∗, analytic in an
open set D and satisfying ∥C(z)∥< 1 in D.
purely contractive part
Suppose that
we are given an analytic contraction-valued
function C(z) mapping one Hilbert space H
into another H∗. (See purely contractive an-
alytic operator function.) If we have the di-
rect sum C(z) = D(z) ⊕V , where D(z) is
a purely contractive analytic function from
L to L∗and V is an isometric isomorphism
from H⊖L onto H∗⊖L∗, then D(z) is called
the purely contractive part of C(z).
purely singular measure
Given a positive
measure µ and an arbitrary measure λ on a
σ-algebra , λ is purely singular with re-
spect to µ (written λ ≪µ) provided E ∈
and µ(E) = 0 imply λ(E) = 0. When µ is
not speciﬁed, it is understood to be Lebesgue
measure.
pushout
Given sets A1, A2, K and maps
α1 : K →A1, α2 : K →A2, the pushout
is a set B, together with maps β1 : A1 →
B, β2 : A2 →B such that
(i.) β1α1 = β2α2, and
(ii.) if C is another set, with maps γ j : A j →
C( j = 1, 2) satisfying γ1α1 = γ2α2, then
there is a unique map δ : B →C with δβ j =
γ j( j = 1, 2).
Normally, the sets are objects and the
maps are morphisms in some category.
Pushouts exist in Abelian categories and in
some others such as the category of Hilbert
modules.
Putnam’s Theorem
Suppose that M, N,
and T are bounded linear operators on a
Hilbert space H. Assume also that M and
N are both normal operators, i.e., they com-
mute with their adjoints operators:
M M∗= M∗M
and
N N ∗= N ∗N.
The Fuglede-Putnam Theorem states that if
MT = T N, then M∗T = T N ∗.
Fuglede proved the case M = N and later
Putnam extended the theorem to the general
case.

Q
quadrant
The Cartesian plane is divided
in half by the x-axis and again by the y-
axis. This forms the four quadrants of the
xy-plane. The quadrant where x > 0 and
y > 0 is called the ﬁrst quadrant. The other
three are numbered in a counterclockwise di-
rection.
quadrant of angle
The Cartesian plane is
divided into four quadrants. See quadrant. If
an angle is oriented so that its initial side is
the positive x-axis and it opens in the coun-
terclockwise direction, then the quadrant of
the angle is the quadrant in which the termi-
nal side belongs. In cases where the terminal
side is an axis, then the angle is a quadrantal
angle.
quadratic differential
Given a rectiﬁable
curve C in space, described by
x = x(t), y = y(t), z = z(t)
for a ≤t ≤b, the length of C is given by
the formula
L(C) =
 b
a

dx
dt
2
+ dy
dt
2
+ dz

Thus, the element of arclength ds can be
thought of as satisfying the quadratic differ-
ential relationship
ds2 = dx2 + dy2 + dz2.
More generally, quadratic differentials
are used to describe the length element in a
Riemannian manifold.

A homogeneous quadratic
form in the variables x1, . . . , xn is a polyno-
mial
q(x1, . . . , xn) =

in which each term is degree two. This form
may be written as a matrix product X BX T .
See also principal axis.
quadratic function
A quadratic function
in the variable x is a polynomial of degree 2
in x. Thus, f (x) = ax2 + bx + c represents
the general quadratic function (if a ̸= 0).
The roots f (x) = 0 can be found using the
quadratic formula,
x = −b ±

quadratic inequality
An inequality of the
form ax2 + bx + c ≥0, where a ̸= 0. A
quadratic inequality can be easily solved us-
ing the quadratic formula and the graph of

quadrature

cle refers to the ancient problem of con-
structing a square with the same area.

(3.) The method of solving a differential

See separation of variables.
quadric curve
A quadric curve is the
graph of a second degree polynomial equa-
tion in x and y
ax2 + bxy + cy2 + dx + ey + f = 0.
Such curves include the equations of circles,
ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. The
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

above curve is also called a conic because
it represents all possible intersections of a
plane with a right circular cone.
quadric surface
The graph of a second
degree polynomial in x, y, and z. For exam-
ple, the graph
x2
a2 + y2
b2 + z2
c2 = 1
yields a “football” shaped surface called an
ellipsoid. Other interesting surfaces are hy-
perboloids and paraboloids. These names
are derived from the conic curves that are
obtained by intersecting the surface with
a plane parallel to the coordinate planes:
x = 0, y = 0, and z = 0.
quasi-analytic class
A class of inﬁnitely
differentiable functions on the circle T such
that the only function in the class which van-
ishes, together with all its derivatives, at any
point t ∈T is the identically 0 function. See
Denjoy-Carleman Theorem.

class.
quasi-conformal mapping
A map be-
tween two differentiable manifolds which,
in local coordinates dz = dx + idy and
d¯z = dx −idy, has the spherical line ele-
ment ds2 = |g1dz + q2d¯z|2 such that
D(z) = |g1| + |g2|
|g1| −|g2|
is bounded for |z| < R, for some R > 0.
Note that D(z) = 1 in the conformal (ana-
lytic) case.
quasi-nilpotent operator
A bounded lin-
ear operator from a Hilbert space H to itself,
satisfying
lim
n→∞∥T n∥1/n = 0.
The notion generalizes that of a nilpotent
operator, satisfying T n = 0 for some positive
integer n.
The spectral radius is 0 for a quasi-
nilpotent operator. See spectral radius.
quasi-norm
A real-valued function ∥· ∥,
deﬁned on a vector space V over a scalar ﬁeld
F (usually the real or complex numbers) sat-
isfying
(i.) ∥x∥≥0, for x ∈V, with equality if and
only if x = 0;
(ii.) ∥x + y∥≤∥x∥+∥y∥, for x, y ∈V; and
(iii.) ∥−x∥= ∥x∥and
lim
α j→0 ∥α j x∥= 0
lim
∥x j∥→0 ∥αx j∥= 0,
where x, x j ∈V and α, α j ∈F. See Frechet
space.
quotient norm
See quotient space.
quotient space
A common situation in
linear algebra is to have a vector space X and
a vector subspace Y. One then obtains the
vector quotient space X/Y whose elements
are the cosets x + Y, for x ∈X. Here, the
coset x1 + Y is equal to the coset x2 + Y if
and only if x1 −x2 ∈Y. One can then deﬁne
the usual vector operations and show that the
quotient space is again a vector space.
If X is a normed vector space, the quo-
tient space can be given the quotient norm,
deﬁned by
∥x + Y∥= inf
y∈Y ∥x + y∥.
If X is a Hilbert space, the quotient norm
of x+Y is equal to the norm of the projection
of x onto the orthogonal complement Y ⊥of
Y and the quotient space X/Y can be natu-
rally identiﬁed with Y ⊥.

The function
deﬁned on the unit circle by
˜u(eiθ) = sup
0≤r<1
|u(reiθ)|
where u(z) is a function deﬁned on the unit
disk. The radial maximal function has im-
portant applications to the theory of Hardy
Spaces. For example, if the function u is har-
monic for |z| < 1 and 0 < p < ∞then
u = ℜf for some analytic function f (z) in
the Hardy Space H p if and only if the radial
maximal function is in the space L p.
radius of convergence
See power series.
radius of curvature
A particle traveling
in space has three associated vectors at time
t, namely: the unit tangent T, the principle
normal N, and binormal B. See principal nor-
mal.
The osculating plane determined by T
and N best describes the motion at time t and
the bending of the curved path in this plane
is called the curvature κ. See curvature. The
reciprocal of k is called the radius of curva-
ture R. The basic idea is that the motion of
the particle is approximately uniform motion
along a circle of radius R in the osculating
plane.
radius of principal curvature
The prin-
cipal curvatures for a surface are the max-
imum and minimum values for the normal
curvatures. See principal curvature. Analo-
gous to radius of curvature for curves, the
radii of principal curvature for a point on a
surface are just the reciprocals of the princi-
pal curvatures.
radius of torsion
A particle traveling in
space has three associated vectors at time t,
namely: the unit tangent T, the principle nor-
mal N, and binormal B. See principal normal.
These form the Frenet frame {T, N, B} and
satisfy
T′ = κN
N′ = −κT + τB
B′ = −τN,
where the scalar quantities are the curvature
κ and torsion τ. See curvature, torsion.
The radius of torsion is deﬁned in similar
manner to the radius of curvature; namely, it
is the reciprocal of τ.
radius vector
The motion of a particle
traveling in space is described by a position
or radius vector R(t) = x(t)i+y(t)j+z(t)k.
The velocity and acceleration vectors are
then obtained by differentiating R(t).

Radon-Nikodym Theorem
Given a pos-

respect to µ, there exists a unique function
h ∈L1(µ) such that

Also known as
Ramanujan’s hypothesis. Ramanujan pro-
posed that

ramiﬁcation number
Let f : M →N
be a nonconstant, holomorphic mapping be-
tween Riemann surfaces. Suppose that we
can choose local coordinates z, vanishing at
a point p ∈M, and ζ, vanishing at f (p)
in N, such that ζ = f (z) = 
j≥n a jz j
(an ̸= 0). The number n is called the ramiﬁ-
cation number of f at p.

number, for a map f between manifolds.
(2.) For a ﬁnite mapping f : X →Y, of ir-
reducible varieties, a point p ∈Y at which
the number of inverse images is not equal to
the degree of f .
Ramiﬁcation Theorem
Let k be an alge-
braically closed ﬁeld and x an indeterminate.
Given y, separably algebraic over k(x), sup-
pose that the ramiﬁcation index e at a place
of k(x, y) over the place x = 0 of k(x) is not
divisible by char k. Then y can be written as
a power series in x1/e.
ramiﬁed covering space
A manifold M∗
is a ramiﬁed covering of a manifold M pro-
vided there is a continuous, surjective map
(the ramiﬁed covering map) f : M∗→M
such that, for every p∗∈M∗there are local
coordinates z∗on M∗, vanishing at p∗, and
z on M, vanishing at f (p∗), and an integer
n > 1 such that f is z = z∗n, in terms of
these coordinates.
ramiﬁed element
Let A be a ring of inte-
gers which is a UFD (unique factorization
domain). Then a ramiﬁed element is a ra-
tional prime p such that there are repeated
factors in the complete factorization of p in

range of function
Let f : X →Y be a
function mapping the set X into the set Y.
The range of f is the set
R f = {y ∈Y : y = f (x)
for some x ∈X}.
Also called image of f (x).
rank
(1.) The row rank of an n × m ma-
trix A with entries in a ﬁeld F is the max-
imum number of linearly independent rows.
Here, linear independence of the row vectors
A1, . . . , Ar over F means that the equation:
c1A1 + · · · + cr Ar = 0
where each ci ∈k, has only the trivial solu-
tion c1 = c2 = . . . = 0.
It is a theorem that the row rank is equal
to the column rank and hence this common
value is called the rank of a matrix.

Rayleigh-Ritz method
Calculus of vari-
ations problems involve minimizing an in-
tegral expression over a class of admissible
functions. For example, according to Fer-
mat’s principle the path of a light ray in
an inhomogeneous 2 dimensional medium in
which the velocity of light is c(x, y) solves
the variational problem


1 + y′2
c(x, y) dx = min
where the admissible functions are all con-
tinuous curves, which have piecewise con-
tinuous derivatives and join the end points
of the path.
The Rayleigh-Ritz method is a numeri-
cal method for constructing a sequence of
functions y1, y2, . . . with the property that
yn →y, where y is the minimizing func-
tion.

real axis
The complex numbers C are
usually depicted as the points in the Carte-
sian plane by means of the identiﬁcation:
a + bi ←→(a, b).
With this identiﬁcation, the x-axis in the
Cartesian plane becomes the real axis in C.

real-valued function.
real Hilbert space
A vector space over R
with inner product for which the metric:
d(x, y) = ∥x −y∥
is complete. See inner product, pre-Hilbert
space.
real linear space
A vector space in which
the scalar ﬁeld is the real numbers. See vector
space.
The most basic example is n-dimensional
Euclidean space Rn but other interesting ex-
amples are function spaces such as the real
linear space of continuously differentiable
real-valued functions deﬁned on an interval,
C1(I).
real variable
Suppose that a function
f (x1, . . . , xn) is deﬁned on n-dimensional
Euclidean space Rn. f is then said to be
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

a function of the n real variables x1, . . . , xn.
Thus, the term real variable refers to the vari-
ables used to deﬁne a function on R or Rn.
real-valued function
A function deﬁned
on a set A and taking values in the set of
real numbers. In calculus, the typical exam-
ples include one-variable functions denoted
y

f (x) or several variable functions,
say T (x, y, z), which measure the tempera-
ture or other physical quantity of a solid 3-
dimensional object.
rearrangement
(1.) A series ∞
j=1 b j is
a rearrangement of ∞
j=1 a j, provided there
is a one-to-one map σ of the positive inte-
gers onto itself such that a j = bσ( j), for
j = 1, 2, . . .. The sum of the series  a j
is the same as the sum of each of its rear-
rangements if and only if  |a j| converges.
(2.) Two real-valued functions f (x) and
g(x) deﬁned on the real line R are said to
be rearrangements of each other provided:
m({x | f (x) > t}) = m({x : g(x) > t})
holds for all real numbers t. Here m(E) de-
notes the Lebesgue measure or length of the
set E.
Intuitively, the graph y = f (x) has been
rearranged by interchanging different parts
of it to form the graph y = g(x). One simple
example would be g(x) = f (x −a), where
a is any real number. The graph of f (x) is
then translated to the left or right to form the
graph of g(x).

ment invariant is a quantity that is deﬁned on
functions, which yields the same value for
any two functions which are rearrangements
of each other. See rearrangement.
As an example, if two nonnegative func-
tions f (x) and g(x) are rearrangements of
each other, then they have the same integrals:
 ∞
−∞
f (x) dx =
 ∞
−∞
g(x) dx.
rectangular coordinates
The system of
Cartesian coordinates which assigns each
point in the plane an x and y coordinate is
also called a rectangular coordinate system
because of the geometry involved in locat-
ing the point (x, y). By comparison, one can
also use a system of polar coordinates when
a problem has a certain amount of circular
symmetry.
In 3-dimensional space there are also
cylindrical and spherical coordinates that
can be used, depending on the needs of the
problem.
rectangular hyperbola
A hyperbola in
rectangular coordinates whose axes of sym-
metry are parallel to the coordinate axes.
Hence the locus of the equation
(x −h)2
a2
−(y −k)2
b2
= 1
where the point (h, k) is the center of the hy-
perbola.
Some authors add the additional require-
ment that a = b in the above.
rectiﬁable curve
A space curve, r(t) =
x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k, where a ≤t ≤b, of
ﬁnite length. If all the functions are continu-
ously differentiable, then the length is ﬁnite
and is given by the formula
L(C) =
 b
a

(x′)2 + (y′)2 + (z′)2 dt
=
 b
a
∥r′∥dt.
In case r is not continuously differen-
tiable, then the curve is said to be rectiﬁable
provided the least upper bound of the set of
all lengths of polygonal paths inscribed in C
is ﬁnite. The length L(C) is deﬁned to be
this least upper bound in this case.
rectifying plane
A particle traveling in
space has three associated vectors at time t,
namely: the unit tangent T, the principle nor-
mal N, and binormal B. See principal normal.
These form the Frenet frame {T, N, B}.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

The Frenet frame at a point on a curve de-
ﬁnes, locally, three planes given by the pairs
of these vectors. The osculating plane is de-
termined by the vectors T and N. The normal
plane is determined by the vectors N and
B and ﬁnally, the rectifying plane is deter-
mined by the vectors T and B.
recurrence formula
A recurrence for-
mula is a way of deﬁning a sequence {x j},
in which, for each j, x j is deﬁned as a ﬁxed
function of x j−1. For example, the Newton
method for ﬁnding roots is to substitute x j−1
in the function x −f (x)/f ′(x) over and over
to produce a sequence
x j = x j−1 −f (x j−1)
f ′(x j−1)
which converges to a root, given an appro-
priate starting value x0.
Closely related is a recursion formula,
which may change with repeated computa-
tions based on previous values of the vari-
ables. For example, j! = j·( j−1)! expresses
j factorial as a formula involving j −1 fac-
torial.
recursion formula
See recurrence for-
mula.
reduced extremal distance
Let  be a
domain in the complex plane. Given a sub-
set E ⊂∂ and a point z0 ∈, one would
like a quantity similar to the extremal dis-
tance between E and z0. Unfortunately, this
is ∞. See extremal distance.
To get around this problem, one computes
the extremal distance between E and a small
circle of radius r centered at z0 and then sub-
tracts the quantity
1
2π logr.
It turns out that the limit exists as r tends to
zero and gives a quantity which we denote
by d(z0, E).
This number is not conformally invariant
so that instead, the reduced extremal distance
between E and z0 is deﬁned to be
δ(z0, E) = d(z0, E) −d(z0, ∂).
This quantity turns out to be nonnegative and
conformally invariant.
reducible germ of analytic set
This topic
refers to the local behavior of the zero set
for an analytic function of several complex
variables. For example, the local properties
of the zero set of an irreducible polynomial
in several complex variables would be an ir-
reducible germ of an analytic set.
reduction formula
In integral calculus, a
reduction formula for an integral is one in
which the integral is expressed by a similar
integral but with smaller values of a param-
eter. Thus, the complete answer can be ob-
tained by repeated use of the formula. A typ-
ical example is

xnex dx = xnex −n

xn−1ex dx.
This formula shows how to compute an in-
tegral above for any positive integer n be-
cause after repeatedly using the formula we
eventually arrive at the elementary integral

ex dx = ex + C.

reﬂection in a line
Given a line through the
origin in Euclidean space Rn, it is possible to
express an arbitrary position vector r as a sum
r = r1 + r2
where r1 is parallel to the line and r2 is per-
pendicular to it.
The reﬂected point is then obtained by re-
versing the direction of r2, i.e.,
r∗= r1 −r2.
In case the line does not contain the origin,
then translate the origin so that it does.
reﬂection in a plane
Given a plane
through the origin in Euclidean space Rn, it
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

is possible to express an arbitrary position
vector r as a sum
r = r1 + r2
where r1 is parallel to the plane and r2 is
perpendicular to it.
The reﬂected point is then obtained by re-
versing the direction of r2, i.e.,
r∗= r1 −r2.
In case the plane does not contain the ori-
gin, then translate the origin so that it does.
reﬂection in a point
In Euclidean space
Rn, the reﬂection of a point with position
vector r, about the origin, is simply its nega-
tive r∗= −r. The reﬂection in a point is ob-
tained by translating the origin to the given
point and proceeding as above.
reﬂection property of conic section
Each
of the conics has an interesting focal prop-
erty. For example, a parabolic mirror is
based on the reﬂection property that rays of
light parallel to the axis of the parabola are
reﬂected to its focus. See parabola. See also
ellipse, hyperbola for similar properties.

boundary ∂ of an open set in Rn such that,
near x0, ∂ can be described as the level set
of a smooth function g(x) = 0 where the
gradient satisﬁes |∇g(x0)| > 0.
regular closed set
A closed subset of Rn
with the property that, locally, it is the inter-
section of a ﬁnite number of regular level sets,
{x : gi(x) = 0}, where the functions gi are
differentiable and have nonzero gradients.
regular embedding
A differentiable func-
tion f : Rm →Rn which is a one-to-one
mapping and such that its derivative matrix
has constant rank m (here m ≤n).
For example, a smooth curve x = x(t),
y = y(t) is a regular embedding of the line
into the plane provided the curve does not
intersect itself and
x′2(t) + y′2(t) > 0
for all −∞< t < ∞.
The deﬁnition can be generalized to
smooth manifolds.
regular factorization
Suppose (z)
:
H1 →H2 is a contractive, analytic, Hilbert
space operator-valued function for |z| < 1.
Let (z) = 2(z)1(z), where 1(z) :
H1 →H′ and 2 : H′ →H2 be a fac-
torization of  into the product of contrac-
tive, analytic, operator-valued functions. Let
(t) : H1 →H1 be deﬁned by (t) =
[I −(eit)∗(eit)]
1
2 , and let 1(t) and
2(t) be analogously deﬁned. The operator
Z : v →21v ⊕1v is an isometry
from L2(H1) into 2L2(H′)⊕1L2(H1),
and can be extended by continuity to the
closures of those spaces. The factorization
 = 21 is called a regular factorization
if the above (extended) Z is unitary. B. Sz.-
Nagy and C. Foias have proved that if  is
the characteristic operator function of a con-
traction operator, then the regular factoriza-
tions of  are in one-to-one correspondence
with the invariant subspaces of T .

essential singularity.

be a point which is a zero of the leading co-
efﬁcient pn(x). If y = (x −x0)r(a0+a1(x −
x0) + . . .) is substituted in the equation,
then the coefﬁcient of the lowest power of
x −x0 is a polynomial in r of degree n. Then
x0 is called a regular singular point of the
differential equation.

A manifold M is
called a submanifold of the manifold M′ if:
(1) The set M is a subset of M′.
(2) The identity map i from M into M′ is an
imbedding of M into M′.

with 0 ≤φ ≤π/2 such that | sin θ| = sin φ.

of φ. The related angle is also known as the
reference angle.

note the sheaf of germs of continuous sec-
tions of F with supports contained in A and
deﬁne F(n) inductively by: F(1) is the sheaf
of germs of continuous sections of Z(1) =
F(0)/F and F(n+1) the sheaf of sections of
Z(n+1) = F(n)/Z(n). We have the natural
exact (quotient) sequences

Rellich’s Uniqueness Theorem
Consider
a physical system in which incoming waves
are scattered by an obstacle and generate
outgoing waves. Suppose U(t) = eAt is the
operator that maps the incoming waves to
the outgoing waves, and let U0(t) be the cor-
responding operator for the system in which
no scattering obstacle is present. A function
f is called eventually outgoing if there is a
constant t0 such that [U0(t) f ](x) = 0 for
|x| < t −t0. Rellich’s Uniqueness Theorem
asserts that if f is a solution of the eigen-
value problem Af = iσ f for a real value σ
in some exterior domain G, and if f is even-
tually outgoing, then f = 0 on G.

Then r is called the remainder.
(2.) In approximation problems, the differ-
ence of the approximating quantity and the
quantity being approximated. Thus, it is ad-
vantageous to be able to show how small the
remainder is, in such problems.

Then f (A) is analytic in Y.
(2.) Remmert’s Embedding Theorem: A
connected, n-dimensional Stein space X can
be mapped homeomorphically by a holo-
morphic f , onto a closed subspace of some
Cm. If X is a manifold, then f can be cho-
sen to be an embedding with m = 2n (except
m = 3, if n = 1).
Remmert-Stein Theorem
Let  be an
open set in Cn and suppose that there is an
analytic disk  ⊂∂ centered at P. De-
note by TP() the tangent space to  at P
and by N its real orthogonal complement in
TP(∂). Assume there is a small neighbor-
hood U of 0 ∈N such that  + U ⊆∂U.
Let D ⊆Cm be strongly pseudoconvex with
C4 boundary. Then there is no proper holo-
morphic map ρ :  →D.
A special case is the fact that there is no
proper map of the ball to the polydisk or of
the polydisk to the ball, in Cn.

In a Hilbert space H,
whose elements are functions with domain
containing a set D, a family of elements of

resolvent set of T, then
(λI −T )−1 −(µI −T )−1
= (µ −λ)(λI −T )−1(µI −T )−1.
This is often called Hilbert’s resolvent equa-
tion.

Riesz’s Theorem
(1.) The projection
from L p[−π, π] to H p is bounded if 1 <
p < ∞. Thus if f ∼∞
−∞aneint ∈L p,
then f+ ∼∞
0 aneint ∈H p. This is a the-
orem of Marcel Riesz. The result is false if
p = 1 or p = ∞.
(2.) If X is a locally compact Hausdorff
space, then every bounded linear func-
tional  on C0(X) has the form f
=

X f dµ, ( f ∈C0(X)), where µ is a regular,
complex, Borel measure on X. This theorem
of Frigyes Riesz is called the Riesz Repre-
sentation Theorem.
Riesz-Fischer Theorem
Let {uα, α ∈A}
be an orthonormal set in a Hilbert space H.
Then for every element (cα) ∈L2(A), there
is an f ∈H with ( f, uα) = cα, for α ∈H.
Together with Bessel’s inequality, this im-
plies that the map sending f to ( f, uα) maps
H onto L2(A).
Riesz-Thorin Theorem
Let (X, , µ),
(Y,  , ν) be measure spaces, with positive
measures µ, ν and D a subspace of L p(µ)
for all p > 0. We say an operator T , deﬁned
on D, taking values in the set of ν-measurable
functions on Y is of (strong) type (p, q) if
∥T f ∥q,ν ≤K∥f ∥p,µ
for f ∈D; that is, if T is bounded from
L p(µ) to Lq(ν) (with domain D).
The Riesz-Thorin Theorem states that if
D contains all the µ-measurable simple func-
tions and if T is of type (p1, q1) and (p2, q2),
1 ≤pi, qi ≤∞, then T is of type (p, q),
whenever

p = 1 −t

The theorem is an example of interpola-

terpolated between the two pairs of spaces.

rigidity of a sphere
The sphere is rigid
in the following sense. Let ϕ: # →S be an
isometry of a sphere # ⊂R3 onto a regular
surface S = ϕ(ε) ⊆R3. Then S is a sphere.
Intuitively, this means that it is not possible
to deform a sphere made of a ﬂexible but in-
elastic material.
Rigidity Theorem
If the faces of a convex
polyhedron were made of metal plates and the
edges were replaced by hinges, the polyhe-
dron would be rigid. The theorem was stated
by Cauchy (1813), although a mistake in this
paper went unnoticed for more than 50 years.

Sard’s Theorem
Let f : M →N be

Let f (z) be analytic

and | f (z)| ≤1 in D, then | f (z)| ≤|z| in
D and | f ′(0)| ≤1 in D. Furthermore, if

Schwarz’s principle of reﬂection
Let
+ be a region in the upper half plane of

val on the real axis such that, for every point

reﬂection of +, and if F(z) = u(z)+iv(z)
is analytic in + and limn→∞v(zn) = 0,
whenever {zn} ⊂+ and zn →x ∈L,
then there is a holomorphic function F(z)
on + ∪L ∪−, with F(z) =

There is a corresponding formulation for
reﬂection over an arc of a circle.

each value of the variable, z. Strictly speak-
ing, a function must be single-valued, but
in some situations, where multiple-valued
”functions” must be considered, the adjec-
tive single-valued is added for clarity.

vided there is a Borel set E with µ(F) = 0,
whenever F is a µ-measurable subset of E
and ν(G) = 0, whenever G is a ν-measurable
set, disjoint from E.
The statement µ is a singular measure
refers to the case where ν is Lebesgue mea-
sure.

has the Lebesgue decomposition λ = λs +
λa, where λs is mutually singular with µ and
λa is absolutely continuous with respect to
µ. Then λs is called the singular part of λ.

Spectral Mapping Theorem
Any of a
number of theorems concerning a linear op-
erator T on a complex Banach space and con-
cluding that, for a certain class of functions
f (z), deﬁned on the spectrum σ(T ) of T ,
one has σ( f (T )) = f (σ(T )). Examples of
Spectral Mapping Theorems include the case
in which T is bounded and f is analytic on (a
neighborhood of) σ(T ) and the case where T
is a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space
and f is continuous on R. See also func-
tional calculus. Spectral Mapping Theorems
in several variables, involving notions of joint
spectrum of several operators, also hold.

rem.

spectral set
(1.) A compact planar set S
is a K-spectral set for a bounded linear op-
erator T on a Banach space, if ∥p(T )∥≤
K supz∈S |p(z)|, for every polynomial p. S
is a spectral set for T if it is a K-spectral set,
with K = 1.
(2.) A connected component of the spectrum
of a linear operator T on a Banach space is
sometimes referred to as a spectral set of T .
(3.) For a bounded, measurable function φ,
the spectral set σ(φ) is the set of complex
numbers λ such that f ∈L2(R) and f ∗φ ≡
0 imply ˆf (λ) = 0. This is the set that ought
to be the closed support of ˆφ, if it existed.
spectral synthesis
Let M be the maximal
ideal space of a commutative Banach algebra
B. The kernel k(E) of a subset E ⊂M is
the ideal ∩M∈E M. A functional ν ∈B∗van-
ishes on an open set O ⊂M if (x, v) = 0,
for every x ∈B such that the support of
ˆx is contained in O. The complement of
the union of all the open sets on which ν
vanishes is called the support of ν, denoted
#(ν). For M ∈M, deﬁne the functional δM
by (x, δM) = ˆx(M), for x ∈B.
A functional ν ∈B∗admits spectral syn-
thesis if ν belongs to the weak-* closure of
the span of {δM : M ∈#(ν)} in B∗.
A closed set E ⊂M is a set of spectral
synthesis if every ν ∈B∗such that #(ν) ⊆
E is orthogonal to k(E).
Malliavin proved that if G is a discrete
LCA group, then spectral synthesis fails for
A(G).
spectral theorem
Let T be a self-adjoint
operator on a Hilbert space H. There ex-
ists a measure µ on the real line R, a µ-
measurable function n : R →Z+ ∪∞, Z+

U from H to a continuous direct sum

where (·, ·)λ is the inner product in Hλ and
n(λ) is the dimension of Hλ.
If µ = µa+µs is the Lebesgue decompo-
sition of µ into its absolutely continuous and
purely singular parts, then the closed sup-
ports of µa and µs are called the absolutely
continuous spectrum and the singular spec-
trum of T . The function n(λ) is called the
spectral multiplicity function of T . (Some-
times spectral multiplicity refers to the es-
sential supremum of n(λ).)
Analogous theorems hold for unitary and
normal operators.

Sphere Theorem
A complete, simply
connected, Riemannian manifold of even di-
mension which is δ-pinched (δ >
1
4) is
homeomorphic to a sphere. If M is of odd
dimension and 1
4-pinched, then, also, M is
homeomorphic to a sphere. (By deﬁnition,
M is δ-pinched if its sectional curvature K
satisﬁes Aδ ≤K ≤A, for some positive
constant A.)
spherical coordinates
A system of curvi-
linear coordinates which is natural for de-
scribing positions on a sphere or spheroid.
Deﬁne θ to be the azimuthal angle in the xy-
plane from the x-axis with 0 ≤θ < 2π (de-
noted λ when referred to as the longitude),
φ to be the polar angle from the z-axis with
0 ≤φ ≤π (colatitude, equal to φ = 90◦−δ
where δ is the latitude), and r to be distance
(radius) from a point to the origin.
Unfortunately, the convention in which
the symbols θ and φ are reversed is frequently
used, especially in physics, leading to un-
necessary confusion. The symbol ρ is some-
times also used in place of r. Arfken (1985)
uses (r, φ, θ), whereas Beyer (1987) uses
(ρ, θ, φ). Be very careful when consulting
the literature.
Here, the symbols for the azimuthal, po-
lar, and radial coordinates are taken as θ, φ,
and r, respectively. Note that this deﬁnition
provides a logical extension of the usual po-
lar coordinates notation, with θ remaining
the angle in the xy-plane and φ becoming
the angle out of the plane.

stationary phase method
A technique
that, in physics, is synonymous with the clas-
sical approximation itself. There is a real
integrand function F of the real variable x
involved. F(x) is supposed to have exactly
one stationary point, which can be either a
minimum or maximum, and which lies at
x = a. A Taylor-type expansion of F(x)
about x = a takes place. Integrals are then
evaluated asymptotically by being replaced
by suitable ﬁnite sums. This procedure picks
out the value of F at its stationary point,
without the necessity of ﬁnding the value of
a. The method can be extended to give val-
ues of other functions of x at the stationary
point. A classical application of the station-
ary phase method has been applied to show
the Ponzano–Regge form satisﬁes Racah’s
identity asymptotically.

that f (x) ̸= f (y);
(iii.) if K is a compact subset of the under-
lying topological space of X, then the holo-
morphically convex hull
ˆK = ∩{x ∈X : | f (x)| ≤∥f ∥K }
is compact, where the intersection is over all

step-by-step method
An method involv-
ing repeated applications of a transformation.
step-down operator
A second order, ordi-
nary differential operator can sometimes be
decomposed, or factored, into ﬁrst order fac-
tors and then solved by ﬁnding a recurrence
formula. (See ladder method.) For example,
for Legendre’s equation
Lny = (1−x2)((1−x2)y′)′+n(n+1)y = 0,
we can write Ln = SnTn + n2, where Tn =
(1 −x2) d
dx + nx and Sn = (1 −x2) d
dx −nx.
Thus, if y is a solution of Lny = 0, Tny is
a solution of Ln−1y = 0 and Sn+1y is a so-
lution of Ln+1y = 0. Tn [resp. Sn] is called
the step-down [resp. step-up], operator with
respect to n.

Stone-Cech compactiﬁcation
Let X be a
completely regular space, C(X) the bounded,
continuous functions on X with sup norm and
M(X) the dual of C(X). Identify X with
ˆX ⊂M(X), the set of atomic measures,

the weak topology of M(X).
Stone-Weierstrass Theorem
Let A be an
algebra of real-valued, continuous functions

that the functions in A and C(K) are real-
valued can be replaced by the assumption
that they are complex-valued and A is self-
adjoint: f ∈A implies ¯f ∈A.

Structure Theorems
(1.) In P-spaces
and P-algebras.
A. The Reduction Theorem. Let ˆP and ˜P de-
note the Samelson subspace and a Samelson
complement for the P-algebra (S; σ). Then
multiplication deﬁnes an isomorphism
g : ∧˜P ⊗∧ˆP
∼=
−→∧P
of graded algebras.
c⃝2000 by CRC Press LLC

Next, let (S; ˜σ) be the ˜P-algebra obtained
by restricting σ to ˜P, and denote its Koszul
complex by (S ⊗∧˜P, ∇˜σ). Then ∇˜σ is the
restriction of ∇σ to S ⊗∧˜P. Moreover,
(S ⊗∧˜P ⊗∧ˆP, ∇˜σ ⊗ι)
is a graded differential algebra.
Theorem 1 (Reduction Theorem). Sup-
pose that (S; σ) is an alternating connected
P-algebra with Samelson space ˆP, and let ˜P
be a Samelson complement. Then there is an
isomorphism
f : (S⊗∧˜P⊗∧ˆP, ∇˜σ ⊗ι)

B. Simpliﬁcation Theorem. The theorem
of this section is, in some sense, a general-
ization of Theorem 1. Let (S; σ) be an alter-
nating graded connected P-algebra. Assume
α: P →S+ · σ(P) is a linear map, homo-
geneous of degree 1, and deﬁne a second P-
algebra (S; τ) by setting τ = σ + α.
Theorem 2 (Simpliﬁcation Theorem). With
the hypotheses and notation above, there is
an isomorphism
f : (S ⊗∧P, ∇τ)

of bigraded differential algebras, such that

C. A third structure theorem. Theorem 3.
Let (∨Q; σ) be a symmetric P-algebra with
Samelson space ˆP and a Samelson comple-
ment ˜P. Then the following conditions are
equivalent:
(i.) (l#
∨Q)+ = 0.
(ii.) σ∨: ∨P →∨Q is surjective.
(iii.) ˜σ∨: ∨˜P →∨Q is an isomorphism.
(iv.) ϱ#
∨Q: H(∨Q ⊗∧P) →∧ˆP is an
isomorphism.
(v.) The algebra H(∨Q ⊗∧P) is generated
by 1 together with elements of odd degree.
If these conditions hold, then
dim P = dim ˆP + dim Q.
These results have been extended to more
general algebras.

is uniquely determined (to within ±1) by
the zeros associated with both the trivial and

is a mapping of π−1(U) into G satisfying
φ(ua) = (φ(u))a, for u ∈π−1(U) and a ∈

Now suppose F is a manifold on which G
acts on the left; we construct the ﬁber bun-
dle E = E(M, F, G, P) over M with stan-
dard ﬁber F and group G, associated with
P. On P × F, let G act on the right, by
(u, ξ) →(ua, a−1ξ), for a ∈G, and let
E = P ×G F be the quotient space of P × F
by this action. The projection πE : E →M
is induced from the mapping (u, ξ) →π(u)
from P × F to M.
The bundle of linear frames over a mani-
fold M is the case where P = L(M) is the set
of all linear frames at all points of M (a linear
frame at x ∈M is an ordered basis of the tan-
gent space Tx(M)), π : L(M) →M assigns
a linear frame at x to x, and G = GL(n; R).

Tauberian Theorems
Any of a group
of theorems whose hypothesis includes the
summability of an inﬁnite series  an, with
respect to some summability method, in ad-
dition to some other hypotheses, and which
concludes that  an < ∞. For example,
Tauber’s Theorem states that if ∞

Abel summable to L and if nan →0, then
∞
n=0 an converges to L.
tautochrone
A piece of wire is bent into
the shape of the graph of a monotonic func-
tion y = f (x). If T (y) is the time of de-
scent, as a function of initial height y, Abel’s
mechanical problem is to ﬁnd f (x), from
T (y). When T (y) is given as a constant,
T (y) = t0, we get the tautochrone prob-
lem. The curve obtained is f (y) = (b/y)1/2
yielding x = a(θ +sin θ), y = a(1−cos θ),
where a = 2gt2
0/π2. The word tautochrone
is from the Greek tauto (same) + chronos
(time), since the time of descent is indepen-
dent of the starting point.

motopic to the identity, by a homotopy that

eled on X, under this equivalence relation.

tensorial form
Let M be a differentiable

uniform asymptotic stability
Consider
the system of autonomous differential equa-
tions of the form
˙x = F(x; M).
(1)
Here, F is a vector ﬁeld which does not ex-
plicitly depend on the independent variable t
and is represented by a map F: Rn × Rm →
Rn; M ∈Rm is a vector of control param-
eters and x = x(t) is ﬁnite dimensional,
x ∈Rn, t ∈R. A solution u(t) of (1) is Lya-
punov stable if, given a small number ε > 0,
there exists a number δ = δ(ε) > 0 such that
any other solution v(t) for which ∥u −v∥<
δ at time t = t0 satisﬁes ∥u −v∥< ε for all
t > t0. Lyapunov stability is also called uni-
form stability because δ is independent of
the initial time t0. A solution {uk} of (1) is
said to be uniform asymptotic stable if it is
uniform stable and
lim

principle
See
Banach-Steinhaus Theorem.
uniform continuity
The property of be-
ing uniformly continuous, for a complex-
valued function.
uniform convergence
A sequence of
bounded, complex-valued functions { fn} on

such that
n ≥n0 ⇒| fn(x) −f (x)| < ϵ,
for x ∈D.

ential equations. See Picard-Lindel¨of Theo-
rem.

as The Uniqueness Theorem comes from
classical Fourier series on the unit circle T:
If f ∈L1(T), T the unit circle, and ˆf ( j) =
0, for all j, then f = 0.
Uniqueness Theorem of the Analytic Con-
tinuation

tions of the same analytic function element
along the same curve result in equivalent
analytic function elements. That is, if the

sets of a set X, a set U ⊆NN × X is univer-
sal for S if, for every A ∈S, there is a ∈NN

universal set is the set of all objects that ap-
pear as elements of a set. Any set that is being
considered is a subset of the universal set.
upper bound

set X, an element x ∈X such that s ≤x, for
all s ∈S.

Wiener’s formula
W( f ) = 2

ψ(τ) cos 2π f τ dτ,
where W( f ) is the power spectrum (spec-
trum of squared amplitudes) and ψ(τ) is
the autocorrelation function for large τ. This
formula appears in cybernetics in the study
of methods of minimizing interference (sep-
arating signals from noise).
Wiener-Hopf equation

Wiener-Levy Theorem
If f : [−π, π] →
(α, β) is a function with an absolutely con-
vergent Fourier series and F(z) is analytic at
every point of (α, β), then F( f (t)) has an
absolutely convergent Fourier series.

winding number
If γ is a closed path in
the complex plane and z is a point off γ , the
winding number of γ about z is the quantity

sents the number of times γ winds in a coun-
terclockwise direction about z.
witch of Agnesi
The locus of a point P lo-
cated as follows: A circle of radius r is cen-
tered at (0,r). If S is any ray from the ori-
gin, cutting the circle at Q and the line y =
2a at A, then P is at the intersection of the
horizontal line through Q and the vertical line
through A. The parametric representation
for the witch of Agnesi is
x = 2a tan t
y = 2a cos2 t.
WKB method
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin
method for applying the Liouville-Green ap-
proximation by relating exponential and os-
cillatory approximations around a turning
point. Sometimes called WKBJ (Jeffreys)
method. See Liouville-Green approxima-
tion.

X
x axis
(1.) In R3, one of the three mu-
tually perpendicular axes, usually horizontal
and pointing west to east.
(2.) In R2, one of the two mutually perpen-
dicular axes, usually horizontal.
x coordinate
When points in R3 are des-
ignated by triples of real numbers, the x co-
ordinate is usually the ﬁrst entry in the triple
and denotes the number of units (positive or
negative) to be traveled parallel to the x axis
to reach the point denoted.
x intercept
A point at which a curve or
graph in R3 crosses the x axis. That is, a
point of the form (x, 0, 0), for some x ∈R,
lying on the curve or graph.
xy-plane
The plane in R3 containing the x
and y axes. It is the set of points of the form
(x, y, 0), for x, y ∈R.
xyz-space
The space R3 of triples of real
numbers, where the three coordinates of a
point (p1, p2, p3) are referred to as the x co-
ordinate (p1), y coordinate (p2), and z coor-
dinate (p3).
xz-plane
The plane in R3 containing the x
and z axes. It is the set of points of the form
(x, 0, z), where x, z ∈R.

Y
y axis
(1.) In R3 one of the three mutu-
ally perpendicular axes, usually horizontal
and pointing south to north.
(2.) In R2, one of the two mutually perpen-
dicular axes, usually vertical.
y coordinate
When points in R3 are des-
ignated by triples of real numbers, the y coor-
dinate is usually the second entry in the triple
and denotes the number of units (positive or
negative) to be traveled parallel to the y axis
to reach the point denoted.
y intercept
A point at which a curve or
graph in R3 crosses the y axis. That is, a
point of the form (0, y, 0), for some y ∈R,
lying on the curve or graph.

Yosida approximation
Let B be a closed
linear operator and let R(λ, B) = (λI −
B)−1 be the resolvent of B. A Yosida ap-
proximation to B is Bλ = λ2R(λ, B) −λI.
B is the generator of a semigroup if and only
if |R(λ, B)| ≤1/λ for all λ > 0; this can
be proved by generating the approximating
semigroup et Bλ.
Young’s inequality
Let f ∈L p(Rn), g ∈

One of the three mutually perpen-
dicular axes, usually the vertical axis, in R3.
z coordinate
When points in R3 are des-
ignated by triples of real numbers, the z coor-
dinate is usually the third entry in the triple
