Introduction
M
aybe you love your iPhone or iPod and are curious about other Apple 
products. Maybe you’ve had one virus scare too many and are fed 
up with Windows. Maybe the daunting prospect of upgrading to Windows 7 
has made you open to other possibilities. Maybe you’re a Mac fan who wants 
to show a friend how easy and productive Macs can be. Wherever you’re 
coming from, I hope you find that this book meets your needs.
Apple Incorporated, of Cupertino, California, is over 30 years old, and few 
brands in the history of business generate such fierce customer loyalty as 
Apple and its Macintosh line of personal computers. That loyalty runs both 
ways. Apple knows that the people who decide to buy its products are, for 
the most part, the ones who have to use them. Offering systems that satisfy 
and even delight its users is a matter of survival for Apple.
Many virtues of the Macintosh are a matter of taste: its easy-to-use graphical 
interface, its elegant industrial design, and its integrated suite of software. 
But one virtue is a simple matter of fact: In recent years, when Windows 
users endured wave after wave of computer viruses, worms, spyware, and 
other types of evil software, Mac users were essentially immune. ’Nuff said.
About This Book
Macintosh computers and the OS X operating system have more in common 
with Windows than all the hoopla would suggest. Still, differences exist, big 
and little, that can cause problems for the unaware.
In this book, you find helpful guides for every aspect of your switch, from decid-
ing that you do in fact want to switch to a Mac to making buying decisions to 
setting up everything. You also find help getting started with all the cool 
software that comes with your Mac, including iTunes for organizing and playing 
music and media and iMovie and GarageBand for making them. You even find 
suggestions for what to do with your old PC.
This book looks at switching to a Mac from a Windows user’s perspective. 
You find out the best way to transfer your information from Windows to a 
Mac, as well as tips on how to do common Windows tasks the Mac way. But 
most any new Mac user can find help here. Users of older Mac operating systems 
who want some perspective on switching to OS X can also find assistance in 
this book, along with a bonus chapter available on this book’s Web 

2
Switching to a Mac For Dummies, 2nd Edition 
page, www.dummies.com/go/switchingtoamacfd2e, which was written 
especially with older Mac users in mind. Similarly, I address the needs of 
both home and business users who are making or considering a switch.
As with Windows, OS X often provides more than one way to accomplish a 
task. I try to describe one straightforward method for each task, perhaps 
with a keyboard shortcut, rather than confuse you with lots of options.
If you have already decided to buy a Mac, you can skip the first chapter. If 
you already bought a Mac, start with the second part of the book.
Of course, you can read this book from cover to cover, if you’re that kind of 
person, but I try to keep chapters self contained so that you can go straight 
to the topics that interest you most. Wherever you start, I wish you and your 
new Mac well.
Foolish Assumptions
Try as I may to be all things to all people, when it comes to writing a book, I 
had to pick who I thought would be most interested in Switching to a Mac For 
Dummies. Here’s who I think you are:
 
✓ You’re smart. You’re no dummy. Yet the prospect of switching to a new 
computer platform gives you an uneasy feeling (which proves you’re smart).
 
✓ You own a personal computer based on an operating system different
from Apple OS X. This book is aimed mostly at Windows XP users, but 
I think it will be helpful to users of Windows 7, Windows Vista, older 
Windows editions, Linux, and even owners of older Macs.
 
✓ You’re considering buying or have bought an Apple Macintosh computer. 
You want to transition to your new computer expeditiously. I suggest 
straightforward methods and don’t attempt to cover every possible 
approach.
 
✓ Alternatively, you’re a Mac user who knows OS X well but wants a 
resource to give (okay, even lend) to friends who are considering 
abandoning the dark side. What a good friend you are.
 
✓ You have used the Internet and know about browsers, such as 
Internet Explorer, and search engines, such as Google. I briefly cover 
getting your own Internet connection in case you’re not hooked up at 
the moment or it’s time to update your service.
 
✓ You’re looking to buy a new Macintosh. While I briefly discuss the 
used market in Chapter 3, this book addresses only the Intel Macs (ones 
based on microprocessors from Intel Corporation), which are all Apple 
has sold since 2006.

 Introduction
Whoever you are, welcome aboard. I think this book can help you.
How This Book Is Organized
I divide this book into the following highly logical (to me) parts. Each is self 
contained, for the most part. Feel free to skip around.
In Part I, “Informed Switching Starts Here,” I explain why the Apple Macintosh 
is a big deal and why you should consider buying one. I also introduce you to 
the Apple product line and present a few different approaches to conversion 
(no dunking in water involved).
Part II, “Making the Switch,” helps you decide what to buy and find what 
you can reuse from your old setup. Then I hold your hand as you make the 
big leap, moving your computing life to a Mac. OS X is a little different from 
Windows. I tell you what you most need to know to get started.
Part III, “Connecting Hither and Yon,” tells you that Macs are to network-
ing what ducks are to swimming: It comes naturally, but a few tricks are 
involved. I describe what you need to do to get your Mac online and talking 
to any other computers you have, including that old PC.
In Part IV, “More Software, More Choices,” you find out that your Mac is supplied 
with a ton (0.907 metric tons) of preloaded software. And, you can buy — or 
even download for free — a lot more. Windows advocates complain that little 
software is available for the Mac, but so much is out there that I could write sev-
eral books. And, yes, lots of cool games are available.
Kids, seniors, and businesses all have a lot to gain from the Mac way of doing 
things. In Part V, “Specialty Switching Scenarios” I also dive a bit deeper into 
OS X.
Part VI, “The Part of Tens.” If you’ve read other For Dummies books, you’re 
no doubt familiar with “The Part of Tens,” which consists of entertaining lists 
containing ten (more or less) elucidating elements. They’re fun to write; I 
hope they’re fun to read.
There’s more! In addition to providing all these elements, I’ve included a 
Cheat Sheet in the front of this book and a glossary in the back. The Mac 
world talks with a vocabulary all its own, and you may encounter other tech-
nical terms on your switching journey. (Everything is a journey these days.) 
I think you’ll be happy to have this glossary of words and definitions on your 
bookshelf.

Typographic Conventions
For the most part, stuff you need to do on a Mac is graphical, but from time 
to time, I may ask you to type something. If it’s short, it appears in boldface, 
like this: type elm. When I want you to type something longer, it appears like 
this:
terribly important text command
Be sure to type the line just as it appears. Then press the Enter or Return 
key. Capitalization usually doesn’t matter on a Mac. But OS X is based on 
Unix (as I discuss in Chapter 19), and Unix considers the uppercase and low-
ercase versions of the same letter to be totally different beasts.
In the text, Web addresses are shown in this typeface: www.ditchmypc.com. 
I leave out the geeky http:// part, which Mac browsers don’t need you to 
type anyway.
Apple keyboards have a special key with a fan-shaped squiggle that looks like 
this: Ô. It has various nicknames — fan key, propeller key, Apple key — but 
in the text I use its formal name, the Command key.
You also see the Apple logo (Ú) in menu commands. It refers to the Apple 
menu headed by that symbol in the upper-left corner of your screen.
Icons Used in This Book
 
A little tidbit that can save you time or money or make life a little easier.

 Introduction
 
Macs keep the gears and pulleys pretty well hidden. This is under-the-hood 
stuff for the technically inclined; if that’s not you, you can skip it.
Where to Go from Here
Hey, it’s a Mac. You’re set. If you have problems not covered here, lots of 
resources are available online to help you. You can visit my Web site, www.
ditchmypc.com. I’d be happy to hear from you directly at switchtomac@ditch
mypc.com. I would love to know what you think of this book and how it can 
be improved, but I cannot promise individual advice.
Meanwhile, use your new Mac to build a Facebook page, create a business, 
solve the world hunger problem, write the great novel of the 21st century, 
produce your first feature film, meet some cool people, or just have fun. After 
all, the rest of your computing life has just begun.

Part I
Informed Switching 
Starts Here

In this part . . .
P
erhaps you’re fed up with Windows and are ready to 
try something different or maybe you’re a happy 
Microsoft user who’s curious to read what silly justifications 
someone might come up with for switching to a Mac. In 
this part I suggest some reasons for switching that I find 
compelling and address common objections. Then I 
introduce you to the Mac family and help you figure out 
what to buy when you’re ready to take the plunge.

Chapter 1
Why Switch? Demystifying 
the Mac Mantra
In This Chapter
▶ Why switch?
▶ Take your best shot — overcoming objections
▶ Advantage Apple
▶ It’s okay to switch
A
pple Macintosh computers aren’t perfect. They can’t cure bad breath, 
save your marriage, or fix a bad hair day. Apple has had its share of 
product recalls. Talk to enough Mac owners, and you’ll find one who thinks 
he got a lemon and wasn’t satisfied with Apple’s service. You can probably 
find a cheaper computer that will do what you really need. The vast majority 
of computer users get by using Microsoft Windows, and you can, too.
So why even think about switching? Macs offer a far better experience, that’s 
why. Value matters in tight economic times. In big ways, such as security and 
industrial design, and in countless little details, Apple makes the extra effort 
to get things right — right for the user, not for some corporate purchasing
department. For those of us who spend a good part of our lives in front of a 
video display, those easier-to-use controls, well-thought-out software choices, 
and better hardware fit and finish all add up to create a tool that lets us do 
what we want and doesn’t get in our way. For more casual users, the simpler 
Mac design means less head-scratching while you figure out how you did that 
task the last time.
Life is too short for Windows aggravation. Computers are now integral parts 
of our lives: We use them for work, for play, to communicate, to find mates, 
to shop, to express ourselves, to educate our children, and to manage our 
money. They help us fix our homes, cure our diseases, and even clean out 
our attics. No one has time to fuss over them, fix crashes, fight viruses, clean 
out hard drives, figure out why the printer won’t work, reload the software, 
or press Ctrl+Alt+Delete. We need computers to be there when we want 
them. And for the most part, Macs are. Macs just work.

10
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Microsoft isn’t run by a bunch of idiots. The company is managed by some 
very smart people, and they hire top-notch engineers. Just getting a product as 
complex as Windows out the door takes extraordinary talent. But Windows is 
designed for corporations. A Microsoft engineer revealed on his blog that one 
of the company’s corporate users had 9,000 programs for Windows. The user 
simply couldn’t afford to update them for new releases. Microsoft Windows 
has to support all the old software that’s out there. Apple is better able to let 
go of the past and is therefore more nimble in developing new ways to make 
your life easier.
Apple sees its mission as harnessing the rapid advances in computing hardware 
to create revolutionary new products that improve our lives. The Macintosh, the 
iPod, and the iPhone are all filled with groundbreaking innovations. They’re cool 
to look at and to own. Why buy boring?
Be Happy You Waited
In many ways, now is an ideal time to switch to a Mac. Windows users who 
upgrade to the new Windows 7 operating system will have a lot of new stuff 
to get used to anyway. So one way or another, a switch is in your future. If 
your PC is more than a year or two old, you’ll probably have to buy a new 
computer or perform a major upgrade of your existing hardware to run 
Windows 7 — the PC industry is counting on it. Meanwhile, Apple has just 
gone through a major transition in its product line that makes Macs much 
more attractive to Windows users. All new Macs now run on Intel micropro-
cessors, the same ones that power most Windows machines. In fact, any Mac 
sold today is a full-fledged, strictly kosher PC, one that can run the Windows 
XP, Windows 7, and Windows Vista operating systems as well as any PC on 
the market. So if you must run software that’s available only for Windows, 
you can use it on a Mac too. Yeah, you have to buy and install Windows sepa-
rately, but I walk you through that task in Chapter 16.
Take Your Best Shot
The question of which is a better personal computer, a Macintosh or a 
Windows PC, provokes passion matched by few other controversies. Were 
the world less civilized, Apple fans would long since have been burned at the 
stake by more numerous Windows users fed up with hearing how great Macs 
are. Instead, the debate rages over claims that Macs aren’t a suitable choice 
because they’re too this or can’t do that. The following sections outline the 
principal objections.

11
 Chapter 1: Why Switch? Demystifying the Mac Mantra
“Macs are too expensive”
These days, every dollar counts. As of this writing, you can buy a new Windows 
XP computer for as little as $300. Netbooks sell for even less. But a cheap product 
that causes you years of aggravation — and has to be replaced in a couple of 
years — is no bargain. When you price configurations from quality manufac-
turers that match the ones that are standard on a Mac — the difference in price 
is less and often disappears. In the United States, you can buy a complete and 
very usable Mac desktop setup for under $600, assuming that you already own 
a suitable display, keyboard, and mouse; you can buy an excellent MacBook 
laptop for under $1,000. If those prices are too much for your budget, see the tips 
in Chapter 3 for getting a Mac for less.
 
The arguments for buying a Mac are based on quality and total cost of owner-
ship, not on initial purchase price. PCs have hidden costs, such as virus pro-
tection software and periodic disk cleaning, and they generally are replaced 
more often than Macs. Few people boast about how cheap their car is or how 
little they spent for their home entertainment center. When cash is scarce, 
quality matters more.
“Switching is too hard”
I’m not saying that switching from Windows to a Mac is painless. If you have 
been using Windows for a while, you’re used to its idiosyncrasies. You made 
a big investment in learning how to use all that Windows software, not to 
mention the amount you paid for it. You may find some aspects of the Mac 
hard to get used to, though I guide you through it all in Chapter 4. But on the 
whole, it’s not that bad. Macs and Windows PCs have more in common than 
they have differences. All in all, I think you’ll find a switch worth the effort.
Steve Jobs’ other company
Steve Jobs helped found Apple and is widely 
credited with creating the company culture of 
excellence. For ten years, Jobs moonlighted in 
another job: running Pixar Animation, now part 
of Disney. There have been many movie studios 
in the history of film, but few have produced 
nine smash hits in a row: Toy Story 1 and 2; A 
Bug’s Life; Monsters, Inc.; Finding Nemo; The 
Incredibles; Cars; Ratatouille; and Wall-E. All 
were critically acclaimed box office successes 
that made extensive use of the very latest in 
computer animation technology. But the key to 
their popularity was subordinating the gee-whiz 
special effects to the telling of a compelling 
story. Want to know what makes Macs differ-
ent? Rent one of these movies.

12
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
“I’ll be left with no software”
Many Windows advocates claim that less software is available for the Macintosh. 
The standard smart-aleck Mac user answer is, “Yeah, we really miss all those 
viruses and spyware programs.” But some truth to this objection exists. 
Certain highly specialized programs in many fields run only in Windows. If 
equivalents exist for the Mac, you might have fewer choices. On the other 
hand, thousands of software titles are available for the Mac, and they cover 
the needs of most users quite well.
Some great software is available only for the Mac. Every new Mac comes with
 
✓ Apple applications: Handle your e-mail, instant messaging, address 
book, calendar, and of course, iTunes.
 
✓ The Apple iLife suite: This collection has programs for managing photos, 
making movies, burning DVDs, creating Web sites, and composing your 
own music. It even teaches you how to play an instrument.
 
✓ A built-in camera and powerful videoconferencing software: All new 
Macs (laptops and iMac desktops) that have a built-in display have the 
camera, and the software works with industry standards.
The Mac OS X operating system is built on top of UNIX, and Apple follows the 
Single UNIX Specification (SUS). A large amount of software developed for 
UNIX and Linux operating systems can therefore run on your Mac, including 
many popular, free, open source packages. Much of that software doesn’t run 
in Windows.
Finally, as I mention earlier in this chapter, Macs can also run Windows, so 
you can still run the odd program for which an equivalent isn’t available on 
the Mac.
“Macs are dying out”
Macs were close to dying a decade ago. Their share of the personal computer 
market was less than 3 percent. However, their share has been climbing steadily, 
and at last report was 10 percent in the United States. But that isn’t the whole 
story. Consumers buy only about 37 percent of the total number of PCs sold. 
The rest are purchased by corporations — think of all those PC-based cash 
registers you see in stores and restaurants. Add in all those office workers 
who have no say in the computers they use. Apple has little presence in 
the corporate world. Most companies restrict Macs to the creative depart-
ments. So that 10 percent of total sales may represent up to 25 percent of 
the consumer market — people who buy computers for their own use. And 

13
 Chapter 1: Why Switch? Demystifying the Mac Mantra
Apple’s share is growing. The success of its iPhone, iPod, and iTunes music 
store makes more PC users consider Apple. More than half of all new Macs 
are purchased by people who were using Windows, and 40 percent of college 
students buy Macs.
“Macs are not expandable”
Since the earliest days of the IBM Personal Computer, PCs have come in big 
boxes that a user could open to install expansion cards or to add memory 
and hard drives. Steve Jobs horrified the techie end of the PC world when 
he built the original Macintosh as a self-contained unit that users weren’t 
supposed to open. Apple later relented and offered the Mac II, which had 
expansion slots — six of them — but few users filled them. So instead, Apple 
developed FireWire, a blazingly fast expansion port that lets users attach high-
performance devices without opening the box. The PC world responded by 
developing its own fast expansion port, USB 2.0, which Apple then adopted.
 
All new Macs offer USB 2.0 ports, and many include a FireWire port, allowing a 
wide range of accessories to be attached just by plugging them in. Macs also 
offer networking and wireless capabilities. In case you think you must have 
expansion cards, the top-of-the-line Mac Pro comes in a big box that you can 
open to install the same expansion cards (called PCI Express) as modern PCs 
use. But I doubt that you will ever need to do that.
See Chapter 2 for an introduction to the Mac models now available.
“Macs don’t comply with 
industry standards”
Early in Apple’s history, Steve Wozniak, a cofounder of Apple and its engineer-
ing genius, came up with a clever way to squeeze more bits onto a floppy disk 
(an early form of portable data storage). Unfortunately, this design made floppy 
disks written on early Macs unreadable on IBM PCs. That gave Apple a reputa-
tion of being an odd duck, from a standards standpoint, which it has never been 
able to shake completely, even though it later added PC-compatible floppy 
drives and is now exemplary in sticking to industry standards. Indeed, Apple 
was the first to popularize now-ubiquitous computer industry standards such as 
Wi-Fi wireless networking and the Universal Serial Bus (USB). Other standards 
gobbledygook that Macs support include Gigabit Ethernet, Bluetooth, IEEE-1394 
FireWire, PCI Express, ExpressCard/34 (see Chapter 3 for more details), and 
now the Intel microprocessor architecture. The Apple Web browser, Safari, now 
also available for Windows, carefully follows Internet standards — more so than 
Microsoft Internet Explorer.

14
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
“I need Windows for work”
So run Windows 7, XP, or Vista on your Mac. You have to buy a copy, which 
is an added expense. But both run fine on a Mac, and you can still use Mac 
OS X when you’re not working. Using third-party virtualization software, you 
can run both operating systems at the same time, with Windows applications 
appearing on the Macintosh OS X desktop alongside native Mac applications. 
I tell you more about how all this works in Chapter 16.
“Macs are a poor game platform”
True, more games exist for the PC, but plenty are available for Macs, many 
of the top titles too, including World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and Spore. And 
many more are coming. The Apple iPhone and iPod touch have proven to 
be successful portable game platforms, attracting new game developers to 
the Apple OS X operating system. All low-end Macs include NVIDIA GeForce 
9400M integrated graphics processors, MacBook Pro laptops add a second 
graphics chip, and the higher-end, 24-inch iMac and the Mac Pro can be 
ordered with top-of-the-line graphics processors, such as the NVIDIA GeForce 
GT 130 and ATI Radeon HD 4850. And the Snow Leopard OpenCL unlocks the 
power of these graphics devices for more computing tasks. If you’re a serious 
gamer, you probably know all about the latest graphics processors, but I tell 
you more about them in Chapter 2.
“Vista, er . . . Windows 7 will kill Apple”
Microsoft spent five years and billions of dollars developing the Vista operating 
system, in part to end the scourge of computer viruses and spyware that have 
plagued the PC world for over a decade. After Vista proved to be an 
embarrassment, Microsoft spent more years and more billions reworking
it into Windows 7. In the same period, Apple has been devoting its energy 
to improving its OS X operating system from the user’s perspective. While 
Windows 7 and Windows Vista were gestating, Apple released five improved 
versions of OS X, code-named Jaguar, Panther, Tiger, Leopard, and Snow 
Leopard. (Someone in Apple likes big cats.) Microsoft has indicated that 
Windows 7 may be its last big operating system release — the race may be 
too exhausting for Microsoft. Still, it will have to find some way to keep up 
with Apple.

15
 Chapter 1: Why Switch? Demystifying the Mac Mantra
Considering All Aspects — 
Advantage Apple
Standard business school theory says that a company that sells the most 
amount of product can’t be stopped because it just gets better and better at 
what it does, to the point where no one can catch up. But Apple has adopted 
strategies that give it important advantages over the competition provided 
by Microsoft.
One neck to wring
Microsoft sells its Windows operating system to dozens of companies that 
make personal computers. This practice has some benefits in that compe-
tition among these PC vendors keeps prices down, but it also means that 
Microsoft has to support a bewildering number of different hardware designs 
and components (for example, displays, hard drives, communications adapt-
ers, and processor chips). And this includes not just all the variations now 
being sold but also products no longer on the market but still in use, includ-
ing PCs made by companies that have left the business. Outside of a brief 
flirtation with licensing in the mid-1990s, Apple has maintained complete 
control over the design and manufacture of products that use its software. 
This vertical integration greatly simplifies Apple development efforts, allow-
ing it to bring out new versions of its operating system much more often than 
Microsoft has been able to.
Will Apple license OS X for other PCs?
A perennial question in the Apple-watching 
community is whether Apple will license its OS X 
operating system to run on other PCs. After the 
Apple switch to Intel processors, there remains 
no technical reason why this cannot be done. 
Indeed Apple has to go to some lengths to 
discourage clever programmers from modifying 
(hacking) OS X to run on personal computers 
sold by other manufacturers. One scenario has 
Apple mimicking the Microsoft strategy and 
selling OS X to anyone to run on any computer 
that meets minimal standards. One company, 
Psystar, is selling PCs with OS X installed, 
claiming that it bought the software from Apple 
and has the right to install it on any computer. 
Apple has sued the company, but the courts 
have yet to rule on the Psystar defense. Every 
indication says that Apple will continue to try 
to keep OS X to itself and follow its high-end 
branding strategy, but Apple is known for creat-
ing surprises.

16
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Vertical integration also has benefits for customers in terms of reliability and 
service. If you have a problem with hardware or software, Apple has a strong 
incentive to fix it. With the computer, operating system, and much of the soft-
ware supplied by a single vendor, Mac users don’t have to worry about being 
shuttled from company to company. (“I’m sorry, but you’ll have to contact 
Fly-by-Night Software to solve your movie-editing bug; it makes that applica-
tion.”) Regardless of the problem with the extensive suite of software that 
comes with a Mac, it’s Apple’s problem. There’s only one neck to wring.
Apple is the industry thought leader
Anyone who follows the high-tech industry is used to reading articles about 
amazing new technologies that are going to revolutionize our lives and then 
never hearing about them again. One of Apple’s roles in the computer industry 
is to pick and choose among those new ideas. For the most part, technologies 
that Apple picks are adopted by the rest of the industry, particularly Microsoft. 
Apple may not have invented the graphical user interface, Wi-Fi wireless net-
working, USB, or the smartphone, but its adoption of these technologies made 
them industry standards. Apple users get the good, new stuff first.
Appearances matter
Sometimes you can judge a book by its cover. Sometimes function follows 
form. Early in Apple’s history, Steve Jobs recognized that aesthetics matter. 
The design team that created the first Macintosh computer included a fine 
artist who was involved in everything from graphical interface design to the 
artwork on the cardboard box that the Mac came in. When Jobs returned to 
Apple in 1996, he restored artistic quality to prominence at Apple. From the 
original lollipop-colored iMac to the latest iPod, Apple products have won 
awards for excellence in industrial design. Figure 1-1 shows the elegant 
current iMac all-in-one computer.
 
Quality industrial design means more than arranging all the buttons and jacks 
in a pleasing way. It means questioning each feature and eliminating unneces-
sary doodads. The result is something that isn’t just easy to look at but is also 
easy to understand and simple to work with.
A case in point is the optional Apple Remote. Remotes for most consumer 
products rival an airplane cockpit in complexity; the Apple version has just 
six buttons.

Looking forward, not backward
Apple leadership in technology extends beyond picking winners. Apple is 
also the company that decides when to tell a technology, “You’re fired.” It 
was the first to introduce 31/2-inch floppy disks on personal computers and 
the first to drop their use as a standard feature. Other technologies that 
Apple was the first to drop include the RS-232 serial port and the dialup 
modem. You can still find these features as external add-ons if you really 
need them, but Apple realized that most of us no longer do. Letting go of old 
technology wards off the feature bloat that plagues the computer industry. 
Unneeded features increase complexity and make machines harder to use 
and more prone to problems.

Getting top-notch products
Apple makes money on the products it sells. Unit for unit, Apple is the most 
profitable company in the industry. How does the company do that with such 
a small share of the market? The same way that Mercedes-Benz or BMW or 
Armani does — by branding. Apple doesn’t sell products that are interchange-
able with products sold by half a dozen other companies. It sells something 
unique — products sufficiently superior for which customers willingly pay a bit 
more. The benefit to you as a Mac buyer is the simple reality that no company 
can keep such an enviable position in the long run without delivering top-notch 
goods. You do get what you pay for.
Innovating with the enemy
For most of the personal computer era, Intel Corporation, inventor of the 
microprocessor and creator of the x86 series of microprocessors that power 
most PCs, was closely allied with Microsoft. The term Wintel, a contraction of 
Windows and Intel, was coined to describe a Windows-compatible PC. Over 
time, however, the interests of Intel and Microsoft have diverged somewhat. 
Other companies, particularly AMD, have cloned the x86. Microsoft keeps its 
software compatible with all current x86 machines. That limits Intel’s ability 
to innovate. Microsoft doesn’t readily adopt new features introduced by Intel 
that aren’t supported by other microprocessor makers.
In 2005, Apple announced that it would partner with Intel. Now, all new Macs 
use Intel chips. Although Apple says it based its decision on the computers 
Intel already had on the drawing board (Intel’s microprocessor road map), 
strong hints have surfaced that Apple expects to take advantage of unique 
innovations from Intel in the future.
iPod and iPhone
Apple’s runaway success with the iPod personal music player, introduced in 
2001, has given the company the kind of market dominance that Microsoft 
has enjoyed in the PC market.
The iPhone has been hailed as a revolution in personal communications. It 
combines a four-band phone that uses the worldwide GSM standard, allowing 
its use anywhere, with iPod music and video technology and direct Internet 

19
 Chapter 1: Why Switch? Demystifying the Mac Mantra
access via Wi-Fi or cellular phone links. Apple includes its OS X operating 
system in the iPhone, with a well-integrated and easy-to-use interface, all in a 
spectacularly elegant package.
Apple gives away a version of its iTunes music software that runs in 
Windows. The company is betting that iPod and iPhone customers who 
use Windows will be impressed by the iTunes ease of use and will give the 
Macintosh a closer look when they’re ready to upgrade their computers. We 
tell you more about iTunes in Chapter 11.
Switching Sides Can Sting
The Mac-versus-PC debate ranks as one of the great divides in the modern 
world. Just because these feelings are whipped up by marketing departments 
doesn’t mean that they lack emotional impact. Your computer choice forms 
part of your personal identity. Mac users have a reputation for a certain 
smugness. (You just got a virus? You mean like a cold?) Much of that is defen-
sive, of course. It’s no fun being a minority in a PC-dominated world. (You 
bought a what? Are they still making those?) Few other choices we make 
in life can be as self-defining — perhaps religion, political party, and sports 
team to cheer for. People who move from New York City to Boston invariably 
suffer mental scars inflicted by changing their baseball allegiance from the 
New York Yankees to the Boston Red Sox. Some never recover and have to 
live the rest of their lives in sheltered halfway houses, eking out a living writ-
ing books for novices about technology.
This kind of psychological trauma doesn’t have to happen to you just 
because you switch computer platforms. Think of it this way: The PC won the 
great war. Apple was forced to abandon the Motorola processor family and 
convert to Intel. Macs are now just PCs in a more stylish package with some 
better software. You’re not abandoning your mother’s cooking — just sam-
pling a different cuisine.
No matter what I say, you probably won’t completely escape the emotional 
side of switching to a Mac. When you feel the shame of betrayal and the 
pangs of guilt coming on, repeat this mantra: “It’s just a computer. It’s just a 
computer. It’s just a computer.”

An optional brief history of Apple
You don’t need to read this sidebar to make your 
decisions, but no book on switching to the Mac 
would be complete without a little history of 
how the Macintosh got where it is today. None 
of the science fiction magazines that warped 
our formative minds dared to predict the level 
of computing power beneath our fingertips or 
in our shirt pockets. But no high-tech story is as 
compelling as the legend of Steve and Bill, two 
kids from the West Coast of the United States 
who revolutionized the world.
Apple Computer was founded on April Fools’ 
Day, 1976, by three young men: Steve Jobs, 
Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. Their 
original mission: Sell low-cost circuit boards on 
which hobbyists would build their own comput-
ers, based on the newly invented microproces-
sor. That mission quickly changed when Jobs 
found that a local electronics shop wanted 
more fully assembled systems and gave him an 
order for several dozen of them. The price of 
the first Apple product, the Apple I, was $666.66. 
That sum would now buy a vastly more capable 
Mac mini. Adjusted for inflation, the Apple I 
would cost about $1,950 in 2009 dollars, enough 
for a MacBook Pro or high-end iMac.
The Apple I used a 6502 microprocessor, 
considered easier to program than the early 
groundbreaking devices from Intel, and fea-
tured a BASIC interpreter. BASIC is a particu-
larly simple computer language invented by the 
Dartmouth professor John Kemeny to help teach 
programming. A young programmer named Bill 
Gates dropped out of Harvard — horrifying his 
parents — to start a business selling software 
to the fledgling microcomputer industry. He 
chose the imaginative name Microsoft for his 
venture. A BASIC interpreter for microcomput-
ers was the company’s first product, and Apple 
was among its earliest customers. The choice 
of corporate names was prophetic: a utilitarian 
contraction versus a friendly fruit icon.
The Apple II quickly supplanted the primitive 
Apple I and propelled Apple Computer to early 
leadership in personal computing. Dan Bricklin 
wrote VisiCalc, the world’s first spreadsheet 
program, for the Apple II. If you crunch num-
bers for a living, imagine what the world was 
like when a spreadsheet was just a wide piece 
of ruled paper on which calculations were 
recorded one at a time by hand, and you can 
appreciate the impact of VisiCalc.
Microsoft got its big break when International 
Business Machines (IBM) decided to try its hand 
at making a personal computer and chose Gates’ 
company to supply the all-important operating 
system. Although IBM is now a well-respected 
name in computing, back in the 1970s it pretty 
much owned commercial computing. Almost 
every major corporation in the world used IBM 
computers. Young computer professionals 
were told by older hands that no one was ever 
fired for buying IBM. Some Apple IIs had made 
their way into the corporate world because of 
VisiCalc, but they were soon replaced by beige 
boxes sporting IBM logos, the Microsoft oper-
ating system named DOS, and an even better 
spreadsheet program — Lotus 1-2-3.
The Apple II was a hard act for Apple to follow. 
Apple made two disastrous attempts, the Apple 
III (a souped-up Apple II) and the Lisa. The Lisa 
was a machine ahead of its time, pioneering the 
use of a mouse to move a pointer on the screen 
and letting users initiate actions by manipulat-
ing icons representing programs, data files, and 
hard drives, for example. But this graphical user 
interface couldn’t overcome a $10,000 starting 
price, and few Lisas were sold.
Jobs, fed up with the increasingly corporatized 
development environment at Apple, led a ren-
egade team to develop a more affordable com-
puter, based on much of the same technology 
as Lisa. The new Macintosh was announced

during the 1984 Super Bowl with what is per-
haps the best television commercial ever made.

info/1984.html.
Besides its mouse and graphical user interface, 
the Macintosh was packaged as a single unit 
with a built-in, high-resolution — for its time — 
black-on-white screen that crisply displayed 
the information that would eventually print 
on paper. IBM PCs offered green letters on a 
black background in just one font. The higher-
quality Mac display enabled a “what you see 
is what you get” document-creation process 
and started the desktop publishing revolution. 
The Mac also introduced 3 1/2-inch floppy disks, 
and its Motorola 68000 microprocessor could 
address more memory than the Intel 8088 in the 
IBM PC, allowing the use of more sophisticated 
programs.
Microsoft hedged its bets by developing soft-
ware applications for the new Mac, including 
the word processing program named Word 
and the spreadsheet named Multiplan. Jobs 
and Gates personally negotiated a contract 
that let Microsoft sell a simplified version of the 
graphical interface named Microsoft Windows 
1.0. When Microsoft later released a full-blown 
graphical user interface in Windows 3.0, Apple 
sued, but the courts ruled it was covered by that 
one-page contract. Word became the flagship 
word processor for Windows, and Excel, with 
a graphical interface like Multiplan, drove out 
Lotus 1-2-3.
Jobs left Apple in 1985 after some disagree-
ments with the board of directors and started 
a new computer company, NeXT. It built a 
graphical interface on top of an operating 
system named UNIX that was originally devel-
oped by the American Telephone & Telegraph 
Company (ATT). UNIX was popular with com-
puter researchers because of its flexible design 
and because a version with source code was 
available.
Apple continued to introduce more powerful 
versions of the Macintosh, adding hard drives, 
laser printers, and high-resolution color dis-
plays. Its share of the personal computer market 
continued to decline relative to IBM PCs and 
their clones. In 1994, Apple switched from the 
Motorola 68000 series microprocessor to the 
PowerPC chip, jointly developed by Motorola, 
IBM, and Apple. The PowerPC was designed to 
allow programs to run faster than those for the 
Intel chips, but the theoretical advantage never 
materialized as Intel chip engineers used inno-
vative techniques to keep up.
In 1997, Apple acquired NeXT and Steve Jobs 
rejoined the company, soon taking the helm. A 
year later, he reinvigorated Apple sales with 
the iMac, an all-in-one computer that echoed 
the original Macintosh. A flat-panel version 
appeared in 2002. Apple soon replaced its OS 9 
operating system, whose lineage goes back to 
the first Macintosh, with a new system, OS X, 
based on the NeXT operating system. The iPod 
was launched in 2001.
In 2005, Jobs ended the personal computer 
microprocessor wars when he announced that 
Apple would switch to Intel microprocessors, 
a transition completed in 2006. In 2007, Jobs 
introduced the Apple TV (ÚTV), extending the 
Apple brand to the living room, and the spiffy 
iPhone, setting a new standard in mobile com-
munication. The companion iPod Touch shares 
many iPhone features except the phone and 
has become a popular game platform. Over 
25,000 inexpensive or free applications for the 
iPhone and iPod Touch are available online at 
the iTunes App Store. In 2009, Jobs announced 
he was taking a six-month leave of absence 
from day-to-day Apple management for health 
reasons.

S
witching to a Macintosh means getting a computer manufactured by 
Apple Inc. No one else currently makes Macs. If you found shopping for 
Windows PCs a bit bewildering, you’re in for a pleasant surprise. Apple has 
only a few models in each category, and each model generally has a name. 
Apple gave up using four-digit model numbers to name its products years 
ago. If you love having many vendors to choose from and lots of catalogs to 
look through, with the prospect that something is always on sale, the Apple 
experience might require some adjustment. In this chapter, I touch on the 
various available Mac models and related products. In Chapter 3, I point out 
your options, including memory size and disk capacity, and help you figure 
out which model is best for you, overall.
 
From time to time, Apple upgrades its products, drops old models, and intro-
duces new ones. Check www.apple.com for the latest specifications.
Checking Out Common Features
Apple typically offers three or so versions of each model: a lowest-price basic 
version, an intermediate version, and a loaded version. Certain features, 
including the following, are common to all current Mac models:
 
✓ Processors: The processor in a computer carries out the instruction 
steps and is sometimes called a CPU (for central processing unit) or a 
microprocessor (because such things once filled large rooms, but now 
are about the size of a postage stamp). All Mac models use fast Intel 
microprocessors with two or more processor cores, similar to those 
used in most PCs, allowing them to perform more than one task at a 

24
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
time. They all support 64-bit operation, allowing main memory greater 
than 4GB, though not all Mac models let you install such large memory. 
Unlike in Microsoft Vista, you don’t need a special 64-bit version of the 
operating system to take advantage of this capability. Mac OS X is 64-bit 
ready and also supports older, more common, 32-bit applications. Apple 
typically offers a couple of faster processor options for each Mac model.
 
✓ Memory: As with PCs, Macs come with two types of memory:
 
• Random Access Memory (RAM): Stores programs and data while the 
computer is actively processing them. With one exception, the 
cheapest Mac mini, all Macs come with at least 2GB (two gigabytes) 
of RAM. The basic mini has only 1GB. Having more RAM lets you 
do more things at a time and is especially important if you work 
with very large files, such as movies.
 
• Hard drive mass storage: For long-term data storage. A bigger hard 
drive means more space for music, photos, and video files.
 
✓ Graphics: All Macs include a powerful graphics processor unit (GPU) to 
speed the display of pictures and video. Low-end Macs use an integrated 
NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics chip. Higher-end models add even more 
powerful GPUs.
 
✓ Software: All Macs come with OS X software, and all Macs except the 
Apple Xserve servers include the integrated iLife suite of digital lifestyle 
applications. I introduce you to OS X in Chapter 5. I describe in Part IV 
the iLife suite and other software goodies you can get for Macs.
 
✓ Wireless networking support: All new Macs have provisions for wireless 
networking using the latest Wi-Fi and Bluetooth standards, and most 
models have wireless built in. (Only the most expensive models don’t; 
they’re often used in industrial settings where wireless isn’t needed.) 
Apple was the first computer company to embrace Wi-Fi, using Apple’s 
own brand name, AirPort.
 
 This wireless support is especially handy in Mac laptops because lots 
of places offer Wi-Fi hotspots where you can jump online. Look for 
hotspots in coffee shops and public libraries, train stations, airline ter-
minals, hotels, shopping centers, and even doctors’ waiting rooms. With 
an Apple laptop under your arm, you’re never out of touch.
 
 The Bluetooth networking is a short-range wireless personal networking 
scheme that connects to nearby electronic devices. Bluetooth connects 
your Mac to wireless keyboards and mice. If your cellphone has Bluetooth, 
you can synchronize your OS X address book with your cellphone and even 
use it to connect to the Internet if your phone and cellular carrier support 
such use.

25
 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
 
✓ Wired networking support: All Macs except the minimalist, ultrathin 
MacBook Air have Gigabit Ethernet jacks for wired networking and con-
necting to high-speed cable and DSL modems. See Chapter 9 for more on 
networking the Macintosh way.
 
✓ No dialup modems or floppy drives: Apple dropped the practice of 
including a built-in dialup modem when it switched to Intel microproces-
sors. Instead, it sells the Apple Modem, a small, external modem, as an 
accessory. Macs haven’t had internal floppy drives for several product 
generations. External USB floppy drives are available from third parties.
 
✓ Multimedia: Most Macs can accept infrared signals from Apple’s com-
pact FrontRow remote control, allowing you to control them with Apple 
FrontRow software for comfy media viewing.
 
✓ SuperDrive: All models except the MacBook Air can read, play, and 
write (burn) CDs and multilayer DVDs, incorporating what Apple calls a 
SuperDrive. The SuperDrive is slot loading, so you have no slide-out tray 
to break. Apple offers an optional external SuperDrive for the Air.
 
✓ HD support: Apple is also tying its wagon to the high-definition (HD) 
video revolution that’s under way. Its displays are normally set up with 
a 16:10 aspect ratio (width versus height), which is ideal for HD video.
Other discriminators between models are screen sizes for laptops and iMacs, 
memory, and hard drive space. The more expensive models also have bigger 
hard drives and faster processors, though the speed difference generally isn’t 
dramatic — 20 percent or so.
In the sections that follow, you take a closer look at how the various Mac 
models are suited for different tasks and uses.
Connecting on the Go with 
Your Apple Laptop
Laptops are the most popular Mac models. Compact and elegantly designed, 
they show up more and more at meetings where clunky Windows laptops 
used to predominate.
One unique feature of Apple laptops is the large Multi-Touch glass trackpad 
on its aluminum models, which understands gestures you make using more 
than one finger at a time. For example, you can pinch an image to shrink 

26
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
it or swipe with two fingers to scroll or with four fingers to move windows 
out of the way so that you can see your desktop. The Multi-Touch trackpad 
registers a click if you push down a little harder on it, avoiding the need for 
a separate button. If you’re wondering about how to work without a second 
button, a click while you have two fingers on the trackpad of any laptop 
model is understood as a right-click. (The trackpad on the plastic MacBook 
supports only two-finger scrolling.)
Another thing that sets apart Apple laptops is their built-in iSight video 
camera. It’s located on the lid, above the display, along with an omnidirec-
tional microphone. Stereo speakers and a headphone jack are also provided. 
Coupled with easy, high-speed Internet connectivity, and OS X iChat com-
munication software, these cameras let you videoconference from just about 
anywhere. You can turn off the camera for ordinary audio phone calls if you 
prefer. No one needs to know what you look like first thing in the morning.
Speaking of the lid, it’s kept closed by a magnet — you find no mechanical 
catch to break. And that’s not the only magnetic feature of Mac laptops: The 
power cord is magnetically attached, too. Apple named it MagSafe because 
it’s designed not to pull your laptop off the table if you trip over the cord. 
MagSafe is a fine example of Apple’s attention to detail.
Apple laptops come with a separate power supply that runs on 100–240 volts 
AC, 50 to 60 hertz, so they can be used anywhere in the world with an adap-
tor or power cord for the wall outlets in the country you’re visiting. Apple 
power supplies meet U.S. EPA Energy Star requirements, reducing energy 
waste. An airplane MagSafe power cord is available as an option.
All Apple laptops come with built-in AirPort Extreme Wi-Fi wireless, support-
ing the 802.11a, b, g, and draft-n standards. They also support Bluetooth 2.0 
with Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). So you can use your Apple laptop with any 
Wi-Fi hotspot and any Bluetooth device.
Apple divides its laptops into three product lines, the MacBook, the MacBook 
Air, and the MacBook Pro. I summarize the different Apple laptop models in 
Table 2-1. Figure 2-1 shows the Apple aluminum laptop lineup, from left to 
right: MacBook Air, and the 13-inch,15-inch and 17-inch MacBook Pro models.

Getting just what you need with MacBook
MacBook is the less expensive Apple laptop line. It’s built into a sturdy, snow 
white plastic case. MacBooks come with a powerful graphics processor and 
lots of ports for connecting peripherals, and have a reputation for great Wi-Fi 
range, due to the plastic body. They go anywhere, do anything. 
 
If you can’t make up your mind about which Mac to buy, get a MacBook. 
Laptops are versatile, and the low-cost plastic model works just fine for most 
folks. (However, I’d also recommend a look at the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 
which only costs a little more and features the cool multi-touch trackpad, 
backlit keyboard, and SD card slot.)
Figure 2-2 shows a white MacBook. MacBooks are a bit more than an inch 
thick (2.75 cm) and weigh 5 pounds (2.2 kg). 
Details, details
Each MacBook includes the following items:
 
✓ Glossy wide-screen display: The display has 1280-x-800 screen reso-
lution and measures 13.3 inches (338 mm) diagonally. (All computer 
screens are measured diagonally, a holdover from the earliest days of 
television, when CRT tubes were round.)

✓ Intel Core 2 Duo processor with 2GB of RAM: Two SO-DIMM slots sup-
port up to 4GB of RAM. More RAM helps you work with bigger files and do 
more things at a time. I discuss how much RAM you need in Chapter 3.
 
✓ NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics processor with full 3D 
support: I explain what you get with low-, middle-, and high-end graphics 
processors in the section “Getting the Right Graphics Processor,” later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ Video out port: You can see full native resolution on the built-in dis-
play and even more pixels on an external display, with the second dis-
play either extending your desktop or duplicating (mirroring) what’s 
on the built-in screen, for use with a projection screen, for example. 
The MacBook has a Mini-DVI port that can display up to 1920 x 1200 
pixels on an external monitor. I say more about video output options in 
Chapter 3.
 
✓ Standard-size keyboard: The keyboard includes 12 function keys and 4 
arrow keys. 
 
✓ Scrolling trackpad for cursor control: The trackpad on the plastic MacBook
supports two-finger scrolling — the glass trackpad on the aluminum 
models understands Multi-Touch gestures.

30

✓ Plenty of hard drive space: The plastic model comes with 120GB of 
hard drive space, but you can order one with up to 500GB of storage. 
This is the memory you need to store your pictures, music files, and 
more. I discuss how much to get and the solid state option in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Lithium-polymer battery: The battery provides as much as five hours of 
battery life with wireless in operation.

Traveling light with MacBook Air
The MacBook Air is the ultraportable laptop for road warriors. Apple has 
stripped out components that aren’t generally needed on the road in an effort 
to keep size and weight to a minimum. MacBook Air features include
 
✓ An Intel Core 2 Duo processor with 2GB of RAM. A slower processor 
with only 2 GB of memory maximizes battery life.
 
✓ A glossy widescreen display with 1280-x-800 screen resolution, measuring 
13.3 inches (338 mm) diagonally.
 
✓ A very thin but strong aluminum case that can slip inside a manila mail-
ing envelope.
 
✓ An NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics processor with full 3D 
support.
 
✓ A single USB 2.0 port.
 
✓ A backlit keyboard for easy texting at night.
 
✓ A smaller, 45-watt AC power module.
 
✓ An NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor; see the section “Getting 
the Right Graphics Processor,” later in this chapter, for details.
 
✓ A 120GB hard drive or 128GB solid state disk drive, if you prefer.
 
✓ A full-size backlit keyboard, including 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys 
(inverted T arrangement).
 
✓ A Multi-Touch trackpad for cursor control.
 
✓ An optional external dual-layer-burning slot-loading SuperDrive.
 
✓ An optional wired Ethernet to USB adapter.
 
✓ A lithium-polymer battery that provides up to 4.5 hours of battery life.

The MacBook Air cable connections include
 
✓ Analog audio output/headphone out — 3.5 mm minijack
 
✓ MagSafe power connector
 
✓ USB 2.0 port
 
✓ Mini DisplayPort external video
Taking the high ground with MacBook Pro
The MacBook Pro is the more expensive laptop line, with a number of fea-
tures that set it apart from the MacBook:
 
✓ A choice of display screen sizes (13, 15 or 17 inches)
 
✓ An aluminum case
 
✓ Faster processors with more memory
 
✓ Two graphics processors on some models for even faster gaming and 3D 
support
 
✓ Faster FireWire 800 port
 
✓ Two USB 2.0 ports; three on the 17-inch model
 
✓ SD card slot (13-inch and 15-inch models) or ExpressCard/34 slot (17-inch 
model)
 
✓ Backlit keyboard for easy use at night
 
✓ Heftier, 85-watt AC power module on some models (can also power a 
MacBook, but the 60-watt power module that comes with the MacBook 
isn’t powerful enough to supply the bigger MacBook Pros)
Details, details, details
Each MacBook Pro includes these items:
 
✓ A glossy wide-screen display: The 17-inch model can be ordered with a 
higher resolution of 1920 x 1200. (Table 2-1 lists standard resolutions.)You 
can order the 17-inch model with a reduced glare screen rather than the 
standard glossy model. Many graphics designers find that glare interferes 
with precision color editing. All MacBook Pro displays feature a screen 
that lights up using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) rather than fluorescent 
lamps, which contain trace amounts of mercury, a hazardous material.
 
✓ Intel Core 2 Duo processor: Two SO-DIMM slots support up to 8GB of RAM.
 
✓ A GeForce 9400M graphics processor: The more expensive models 
add a 9600M and graphics memory; see the section “Getting the Right 
Graphics Processor,” later in this chapter, for details.

 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
 
✓ A 160GB hard drive on the 13-inch model; 250GB on the 15-inch; 500GB 
on the 17-inch: You can order your MacBook Pro with larger disk drives 
or solid state disk drives if you prefer.
 
✓ Mini DisplayPort video out
 
✓ Full-size backlit keyboard: Includes 12 function keys and 4 arrow keys 
(inverted T arrangement).
 
✓ Scrolling Multi-Touch trackpad for cursor control
 
✓ Lithium-polymer battery: Provides up to 7 hours of battery life on the 
13-inch or 15-inch model and 8 hours on the 17-inch model.

Furnishing Your Lair with Mac Desktops
Laptops are great, but sometimes you want more permanence in your setup, 
whether it’s your workplace, home office, or entertainment center. Apple offers 
a range of desktop models — from the petite but well-equipped mini to the 
graceful all-in-one iMac to the industrial-strength MacPro and Xserve — that 
you can use to build just the computing environment you want. In the sections 
that follow, I describe the different models. Their features are summarized in 
Table 2-2.

Starting small — the Mac mini
The mini is Apple’s least expensive Macintosh model. As its name implies, it’s 
quite small, about the size of an external CD or DVD drive. Aimed, in part, at 
PC users who are considering switching to Mac, it doesn’t come with a key-
board, mouse, or video display. It can work with most video monitors. You 
can also use your USB keyboard and mouse, if you like, or order new ones 
from Apple.
The mini’s small size (61/2 inches square by 2 inches high) and unobtrusive 
package fit almost anywhere and make it ideal for living room home enter-
tainment centers. It makes almost no noise and uses very little power when 
it’s idle. Apple has adopted the mini’s quiet styling for other products, includ-
ing the Airport Extreme base station and the Apple TV. In Figure 2-4, you can 
see the mini as well as the optional FrontRow IR remote control (on the left).

Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
The mini has an Intel Core 2 Duo processor with up to 4GB of memory and 
an NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics processor with the ability to drive two 
high-resolution displays. The low-price version has a 120GB hard drive and 
a SuperDrive that can read, play, and burn CDs and DVDs. You can special-
order one with a 320GB hard drive. Both models include AirPort Wi-Fi net-
working, Bluetooth, and IR port for optional FrontRow remote control.
The mini’s power button and all cable connections are on the back, as shown 
in Figure 2-5. These connections include
 
✓ Power connector for cable from separate power adapter
 
✓ Gigabit Ethernet
 
✓ FireWire 800 port
 
✓ Mini-DVI external video
 
✓ Mini DisplayPort external video
 
✓ Five USB 2.0 ports
 
✓ Combined optical digital audio input/audio line in — 3.5 mm minijack
 
✓ Combined optical digital audio output/headphone out — 3.5 mm

The lowest-priced mini comes with only 1GB of RAM. You’ll probably want 
more. You can order it with more memory, have a computer store add 
memory for you, or install more memory yourself. The mini isn’t designed for 
user servicing — you need a putty knife to open its case and a screwdriver 
to remove the hard drive and SuperDrive assembly — but videos on the Web 
describe the process. If you’re not into hardware hacking, spend a few bucks 
and get a pro to add the memory for you.

37
 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
Speaking of hardware hacking, many people have developed interesting mod-
ifications that customize the mini for fun or specialized uses. See Mac mini 
Hacks & Mods For Dummies, by John Rizzo, with contributions from yours 
truly (published by Wiley). Some interesting ideas described there include
 
✓ Upgrading the hard drive and RAM
 
✓ Building a home theater around a mini
 
✓ Modding the mini’s case
 
✓ Automating your home with the mini
 
✓ Using the mini in the kitchen
 
✓ Installing a mini in your car (maybe even a Mini Cooper)
Getting it all in one box: The iMac
The Apple iMac continues a tradition that goes back to the first, revolution-
ary Macintosh — packaging the computer and display as a single unit. Having 
it all in one box means a single power cord, fewer connecting cables, nothing 
to tuck under the desk, and less clutter all around. And who couldn’t do with 
less clutter in their lives?
The current iMacs take this idea one step further. All you have on your desk 
is what looks like an ordinary flat-panel display. Well, not quite ordinary: 
With an aluminum case and sculpted stand, it’s well turned out. But that’s all 
there is. The computer is tucked inside the display. All connections are in the 
back. Figure 2-6 shows the two iMac model sizes: 20 inches and 24 inches.

Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Although the computer is out of sight, it has plenty of mind. The iMac can 
keep up with most desktop machines on the market.
Like Apple laptops, iMacs sport a built-in iSight camera for videoconferencing 
and chat. Both have Intel Core 2 Duo microprocessors, AirPort Wi-Fi, Gigabit 
Ethernet, built-in microphone, and audio in and out. The built-in stereo 
speakers are powered by a 24-watt digital amplifier, with ample volume 
for watching videos or listening to music. Both come with a keyboard and 
Apple’s Mighty Mouse, which are wired, but you can order wireless models.
Both have four USB 2.0 ports and one 800 MHz FireWire port. All ports are 
neatly lined up along the bottom-left of the iMac as you face the rear — no 
groping under the desk to get at cable connections. The wired Apple key-
board has two more USB 2.0 ports built-in, though it uses up one of the USB 
ports on the back of the iMac.
Note that the lower-cost model is good enough for most ordinary uses. The 
next model up offers a lush, 24-inch display, more RAM, and a larger hard 
drive for not that much more money. If you have more to spend, you can 
order up to 8GB of RAM, a terabyte of hard drive space, faster CPU chips, 
and more capable graphics processors. See the section “Getting the Right 
Graphics Processor,” later in this chapter, for the advantages of more power-
ful graphics. The larger screen on the 24-inch model lets you have more open 
windows onscreen when you’re doing complex tasks like editing a video or 
researching a paper.
 
Computer displays aren’t as bright as flat-screen televisions, but if you don’t 
mind dimming the lights in your living room, you can build a complete home 
entertainment center with a 24-inch iMac and an HDTV tuner, such as the 
eyeTV from www.elgato.com. It’s a helpful solution for a small apartment.
Maxing out with a Mac
If you have a big budget and need lots of computing power, Apple has the 
answers. In the following sections, you find out about the stand-alone Mac 
Pro and the rack-mounted Xserve.
Mac Pro
As its name suggests, the Mac Pro is Apple’s most capable Macintosh. Maxed 
out, it can hold dual Intel Xeon quad-core processors, 4 terabytes (4TB) of 
hard drive space, and 32GB of RAM in eight DIMM slots that incorporate 
error-correcting codes (ECC) for greater reliability.

39
 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
Although most Macs are designed with the expectation that their cases will 
never be opened, the Mac Pro is a major exception. It’s built into a full tower–
size case that opens easily to gain access to most Mac Pro components. 
Figure 2-7 shows the Mac Pro the cabinet splayed open to reveal its insides.
 
Figure 2-7:

Pro, opened

Also unlike with other Macs, you have room for expansion. The units contain 
four hard drive bays, and you can install dual SuperDrive optical drives. You 
have your choice of either of these graphics cards:
 
✓ NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 with 512MB of GDDR3 memory, one Mini 
DisplayPort, and one dual-link DVI port. As many as four GT 120 cards 
can be installed.
 
✓ ATI Radeon HD 4870 with 512MB of GDDR5 memory, also with one Mini 
DisplayPort, and one dual-link DVI port.
Three additional full-length PCI Express (PCIe) slots are available for plug-in 
cards, which allow expansion of your Mac’s capabilities. These are the same 
types of expansion cards used in newer PCs. They aren’t, however, compatible 

40
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
with the older PCI, PCI-X, or ISA cards. The PCIe slots can hold high-speed com-
munications cards, such as fiber channel, or as many as three more graphics 
cards, for a maximum of four, total. Three hundred watts of power are avail-
able just to power these cards. The whole Mac Pro can draw 12 amps at 120 
volts — half that at 240 volts. If your office is a bit chilly, convince your boss 
that you need one of these puppies under your desk, fully loaded, and it will 
keep you toasty warm.
The Mac Pro has two connector panels: a main one in back and a smaller one 
in front. The rear panel includes
 
✓ Three USB 2.0 ports
 
✓ Two FireWire 800 ports
 
✓ Optical digital audio input and output Toslink ports
 
✓ Analog stereo line-level input and output minijacks
 
✓ Two independent Gigabit Ethernet ports
The front panel conveniently supplies
 
✓ Two more FireWire 800 ports
 
✓ Two more USB 2.0 ports
 
✓ Stereo headphone minijack
Bluetooth is standard on the Mac Pro; Wi-Fi is optional.
Now serving OS X — the Xserve
People who buy servers — the computers that provide the information we 
consume for the Internet — consider different factors than consumers do 
in making their purchasing decisions. Issues such as reliability, packaging 
density, hot-swappable components, and remote management become para-
mount. Server owners want their machines to be up all the time. When some-
thing like a hard drive or power supply fails, they want to replace it without 
shutting down the machine. The server is often located in expensive server-
farm real estate, and the space it takes up becomes an issue.
The Apple server offering is Xserve, and you’ll find that it offers appealing 
answers to each of these criteria, especially that of space. Apple’s Xserve 
is a 1U device, which means that it’s quite thin and maximizes the number 
of Xserves that can fit in a single rack. That makes server farmers happy — 
more cows in the barn. Figure 2-8 shows three Xserves and an Apple RAID 
storage unit in a minimalist rack.
 
Back in the 19th century, as the railroad and telephone industries got going, 
folks realized that a lot of electrical equipment had to be installed in their 
offices. Mounting equipment in vertical “relay racks” with side bars spaced 19 

41
 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
inches apart became a standard that’s still used today. Even the location of 
the screw holes is standardized, and the devices that fit in these racks have 
heights measured in units (U). The shortest height unit that can still span a 
pair of standard mounting holes is designated 1U.
 
Figure 2-8: 
Three 
Xserves 
and a RAID 
mounted in 
a 19-inch 
rack.

Each Xserve features the following:
 
✓ One or two Intel Quad-Core Xeon Nehalem CPUs
 
✓ Up to 32GB of ECC RAM, banked in four channels for high memory 
throughput
 
✓ NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 processor card with Mini DisplayPort output
 
✓ Two available PCI Express 2.0 slots
 
✓ Hot-pluggable SATA and SAS mass storage (three independent bays)
 
✓ SuperDrive
 
✓ One USB 2.0 port on the front panel
 
✓ Two FireWire 800, two USB 2.0, and two independent Gigabit Ethernet 
ports in back
 
✓ Optional second power supply for redundancy
 
✓ Integrated processor for lights-out management and supporting software

42
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
 
✓ A license for Mac OS X Server software, with no limit on the number of 
clients
 
✓ Optional 24/7 AppleCare service
Also lurking in back is an old-fashioned DB-9 serial port. Most commercial 
server-hosting facilities use DB-9 serial ports for console monitoring from a 
remote station using KVM technology. They’re also needed for some uninter-
ruptible power supplies.
Xsan and RAID
Xsan is Apple’s storage-area network (SAN) software. A storage-area network 
aggregates all disk drives in the local-area network into a single entity, allow-
ing all servers to access that data at the same time. It can support up to 2 
petabytes of data. That’s 2 million gigabytes. It can be used with commercial 
RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks) systems such as the VTrak 
from www.promise.com/apple.
Getting the Right Graphics Processor
In modern personal computers, a graphics processor (GPU) takes over from 
the central processing unit much of the work of generating visual displays. All 
current Apple models come with GPUs designed to perform the intricate math-
ematical calculations needed to render three-dimensional objects realistically 
at speeds fast enough to keep up with real-time game play, and can drive two 
HD displays simultaneously at full resolution. Virtual reality becomes more real 
than life. Apple supports a variety of models in its Macintosh line:
 
✓ The low end: Low-end Apple models use a graphics processor from 
NVIDIA that’s integrated with its support chip set for the Core 2 Duo pro-
cessor line — the GeForce 9400M. These graphics processors are fast 
and quite respectable for editing videos, engaging in moderate 3D game 
play, or visiting 3D virtual reality worlds such as Second Life.
 
✓ The middle range: The MacBook Pro adds a second graphics processor 
to some models, the NVIDIA 9600M, and you can order your 24-inch iMac 
with a choice of optional graphics engines, including
 
• NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 graphics processor with 256MB of GDDR3 
memory
 
• NVIDIA GeForce GT 130 graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 
memory
 
• ATI Radeon HD 4850 graphics processor with 512MB of GDDR3 
memory
 
 You’ll appreciate the better quality of these processors if you’re into 
serious game play or professional video work.

43
 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
 
✓ The high end: If you need the highest performance, the Mac Pro blasts 
out graphics with top-end PCI Express graphics cards. You get your 
choice of the following:
 
• NVIDIA GeForce GT 120 with 512MB of GDDR3 memory, one Mini 
DisplayPort, and one dual-link DVI port. Up to four GT 120 cards 
can be installed.
 
• ATI Radeon HD 4870 with 512MB of GDDR5 memory, also with one 
Mini DisplayPort, and one dual-link DVI port.
 
 ATI, now owned by AMD, and NVIDIA vigorously compete for king of 
the graphics hill. Each has loyal fans. You likely have used one or both 
of these companies’ products in your PC experience, and you may have 
your own opinions.
 
✓ The previous generation: Early low-end Apple models with Intel com-
puters used a graphics processor from Intel that’s integrated with its 
support chip set for the Core Duo processor line — the GMA 950 graph-
ics processor, which wasn’t good for 3D game play. To a large extent, 
Apple’s dual CPU design made up for this lack because the second CPU 
can perform the 3D calculations fairly rapidly. Apple no longer ships the 
wimpy 950, but you may find older models at remainder prices, or con-
sider a used machine. If you’re mostly doing light 2-D graphics or light 
game play (I know someone who did quite well in World of Warcraft with 
an older MacBook), the 950 should meet your needs.
Adding On and Filling In
Apple is judicious in its choice of peripherals and other accessories it pro-
vides. For example, although it was among the first to sell laser printers, 
it no longer brands its own printers, but supports most models made by 
others. Apple does offer displays and other hardware, software, and support 
packages, which may come with your Mac or which you can purchase as an 
add-on. The following sections explain the more popular options to help you 
decide what you might want — or want to ignore.
Apple displays
Apple sells two attractively styled, but pricy, flat-panel displays:
 
✓ 24-inch LED Cinema Display, 1920 x 1200 resolution
 
✓ 30-inch Apple Cinema HD Display, 2560 x 1600 resolution

44
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
The 24-inch display is designed to serve as a docking station for Apple alumi-
num laptops. It includes an iSight camera, a microphone, speakers, a built-in 
power supply that can charge any Apple MagSafe laptop, and a three-port 
powered USB 2.0 hub for your keyboard, mouse, and other accessories that 
stay put, such as a backup hard drive. The display’s cable has three plugs 
that go to the laptop: MagSafe power, USB, and Mini DisplayPort. The last 
connection doesn’t work with the white plastic MacBook or older models, but 
if you can afford this display, you can afford one of the aluminum MacBooks. 
You can use the 24-inch display with the Mac mini or Pro or as a second dis-
play for your iMac (it looks just like an iMac) and still use the MagSafe as a 
charger for your laptop.
The 30-inch display is packaged in anodized aluminum with a narrow bezel, so 
you can put two displays right next to each other. It includes a FireWire 400 
hub and a USB 2.0 hub, each with two ports. The video signal connects via a 
DVI cable, and requires an adapter for Macs with Mini DisplayPort video out.
An optional VESA mounting kit, available from the Apple Store, meets the 
Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) Flat Display Mounting 
Interface (FDMI) standard, allowing you to attach your Apple display to a 
third-party VESA mounting device.
Time Capsule Wi-Fi base 
station and backup disk
The Apple Time Capsule combines a Wi-Fi base station and a 500GB or 1TB 
backup hard drive. Wi-Fi connects computers and other devices in your 
home or office without running wires. Those computers, PCs and Macs, can 
access the Time Capsule hard drive over your wireless network. Macs can 
also use Time Capsule for automatically making backups with the Apple Time 
Machine backup software, described in Chapter 5.
In a normal installation, you run an Ethernet cable from the back of the 
Time Capsule, shown in Figure 2-9, to your high-speed Internet modem — 
cable, DSL, or satellite. If you’re in a school or an office with a direct Internet 
connection, plug your Ethernet cable into that connection.

 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
Time Capsule comes with these features:
 
✓ Support for all Wi-Fi standards: Time Capsule supports all current Wi-Fi 
standards, including 802.11a, b, g, and n-draft. It should work, therefore, 
with just about any Wi-Fi-equipped computer and other Wi-Fi devices, 
such as the iPhone and Apple TV.
 
✓ Two frequency bands: Time Capsule operates on both Wi-Fi frequency 
bands, 2.4 and 5 GHz, simultaneously for maximum range and perfor-
mance.
 
✓ Broad support for security standards: The security standards basi-
cally keep anyone parked on the street or your next-door neighbor from 
hopping onto your network to use your Internet access. Time Capsule 
supports all the Wi-Fi security standards — WEP, WPA, WPA2, 802.11X, 
Radius, and so on — and includes a firewall. I tell you how to turn on 
Wi-Fi security in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Parental controls: You can set permissible times for access for each 
authorized computer, which is great for limiting kid access.
 
✓ Even more ports: Time Capsule does more than just supply high-speed 
Internet to any Wi-Fi device within range, which by the way is about 
150 feet (50 meters), though your footage may vary. In the rear (refer 
to Figure 2-8), it has three local Ethernet ports so that you can hook up 
computers that require a wired connection. It also has a USB 2.0 port that 
lets you attach a printer that can be shared by your network. Or, you can 
attach a second USB hard drive that is then shared over the network.
 
What’s that? You want both a printer and a hard drive? Don’t be so greedy. 
Okay, okay. But you need to get a USB 2.0 hub. It’s inexpensive, and you can 
then have multiple printers and multiple hard drives. Go wild.
Time Capsule is styled like the Mac mini and the Apple TV. It’s 7.7 inches 
(197 mm) square (same as the Apple TV), weighs 3.5 pounds (0.753 kg), and 
runs on 100–240V AC.
AirPort Extreme Wi-Fi base station
AirPort Extreme is basically a Time Capsule without the built-in hard drive. 
As supplied, AirPort Extreme provides the same Wi-Fi base station services 
as Time Capsule and has the same set of connectors on its back, including 
the USB port for a printer or hard drive. Add a big hard drive and you get the 
Time Capsule backup functions, but with more boxes and wires.
The AirPort Extreme is also styled like the Mac mini and the Apple TV. It fits 
in the same footprint as the mini, 6.5 inches (165 mm) square, and weighs 1.7 
pounds (0.753 kg). It comes with an AC power adapter, but runs on 12 VDC, so 
you can put one in your car to run a Wi-Fi network at your next geek picnic.

AirPort Express, a Wi-Fi relay
The AirPort Express is smaller and simpler than the Airport Extreme. Kind of 
like the latté grande at Starbucks — it’s the small model. The AirPort Express 
looks like the Apple laptop power supply (see Figure 2-10). It even has the 
same “duck’s head” snap-off power connector.
Although AirPort Express can function as a Wi-Fi base station to share an 
Internet connection, it’s intended more as a relay and an interface to your 
stereo so that you can pipe music from iTunes to your home entertainment 
system. It supports the 802.11b and g signaling speeds.
AirPort Express has just four connections:
 
✓ An AC wall plug — just stick it in any outlet
 
✓ An Ethernet port
 
✓ A USB port
 
✓ A combined optical digital audio output/headphone out — 3.5mm 
minijack
The USB port supports a shared printer. The audio port can connect to 
your stereo. You just need a 3.5mm stereo phone plug–to–RCA phone plug 
adapter cable. You can get one from the Apple Store or your local Radio 
Shack. If you have more than one sound system, you can install multiple 
AirPort Express units.
 
You can take the AirPort Express in your suitcase and use it to create a Wi-Fi 
network in your hotel if the hotel has only wired Internet.

iPod and iPhone
If you haven’t yet heard of the Apple iPod portable music player or the revo-
lutionary iPhone, please return this book for a full refund. They’re every-
where and have changed the way we listen to music and use our cellphones.
Although iPhones and iPods work fine with PCs, they are particularly well 
integrated with Macs and their digital lifestyle applications, including mail, 
address book, iChat and iPhoto. I talk more about the iPod, iPhone, and its 
mother ship, the iTunes Store, in Chapter 11.
Apple TV
Apple TV is a box that bridges your Macintosh and the Internet with your 
big-screen home entertainment center. It has a 40GB or 160GB hard drive 
inside to automatically store movies and TV shows that you downloaded to 
your iTunes library. You can also display your photos at high definition in 
your living room. Apple TV connects your home computer network (Mac 
or PC) to your living room electronics suite in several ways:
 
✓ High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) for high-definition video 
and audio.
 
✓ Component video for HDTVs that accepts separated red, green, and blue 
(RGB) signals, but no single-cable composite video — it’s not designed 
for conventional TVs.
 
✓ Optical audio for the latest sound systems.
 
✓ Analog RCA stereo audio for just about any home audio system ever 
made.
 
✓ 10/100 Base-T Ethernet if you prefer a wired connection to your 
computer.
 
✓ USB 2.0.
 
✓ AirPort/Wi-Fi 802.11n for fast access to your wireless network.
 
✓ Infrared receiver for use with the Apple Remote — one comes with the 
Apple TV.
The Apple TV is styled like the Mac mini, as you can see in Figure 2-11, but 
is a bit larger: 7.7 inches (197 mm) square, like Time Capsule. It weighs 2.4 
pounds, a bit more than a kilogram. Its power cord connects directly to a wall 
outlet or a power strip, with no space-hogging power adapter. We don’t need 
their kind in our living rooms.

Support
Apple doesn’t just sell hardware — it supports that hardware (and software). 
Most Apple products come with 90-day free telephone support and a one-
year warranty on the hardware, subject to the usual fine print that says it’s 
limited and doesn’t cover products hurled into active volcanoes or used 
to stop stampeding elephants, and other forms of abuse. In my experience, 
Apple gives customers the benefit of the doubt.
Each Apple retail store includes a Genius bar — a section at the back of the 
shop where Apple-trained experts are available to answer your questions 
and provide technical support for Apple products. The service is free, but it’s 
best to make an appointment, which you can do online at www.apple.com/
retail/geniusbar.
The following sections introduce you to the three big support programs 
Apple offers as add-ons.
AppleCare
AppleCare extends the phone service and warranty that come with your Mac, 
usually to three years, but always check the terms before you buy.

49
 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
Service policies are a form of insurance. If they’re priced properly, you pay a 
bit more for the policy than your losses are likely to be on average. But the 
term on average is the kicker. If something goes wrong with your computer 
after the warranty expires, repairs can be very expensive — often a good 
fraction of the cost of a new machine. Portables, like laptops and iPods, take 
a lot of abuse. For a new Mac user, I think the free phone support and the 
peace of mind justify the added cost.
OS X upgrades
OS X is included with new Macs. The version you get has a number, such as 
10.6.2. Here’s what that number means:
 
✓ The 10 refers to OS X. X is the Roman numeral ten.
 
✓ The .6 is a major release; 10.6 is also known by its Apple not-so-secret 
code name Snow Leopard.
 
✓ The .2 is a minor upgrade, known as a point release, that typically 
includes bug fixes, minor enhancements, and support for new hardware.
Apple traditionally provides point releases and other minor changes, such 
as security patches, for free via its Software Update service. You’re notified 
about the availability of such changes once a week unless you change the 
settings.
Expect major releases every 18 months to two years. Apple charges for these; 
in the past, each one cost about $129. You could also buy a family pack with 
five licenses for about $200. When an upgrade comes out, it’s usually a good 
idea to wait a bit to see whether it receives negative reviews or whether the 
upgrade breaks programs you use. But Apple upgrades have been relatively 
painless, and the added features are usually worth the expense. So expect to 
buy an upgrade at least once in the lifetime of your Mac.
MobileMe
MobileMe is an online Apple service that’s integrated with Mac OS X. It isn’t 
an Internet service provider, but it does offer e-mail, chat, groups, Web 
page hosting, a photo and video gallery, and 10GB of storage space. It costs 
$100 per year, and a family pack is available. Keep in mind, though, that you 
can often find a lower price for MobileMe by shopping around, such as at 
Amazon.com.
The Internet-based storage service iDisk shows up on your computer’s 
desktop along with your local disk storage. You can use it to back up files 
or to share files with others.

50
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
The MobileMe service enhances several applications in the Apple iLife suite, 
which is the subject of Part IV. It can also be used to synchronize two or more 
computers’ address books and appointment lists. And, photocasting lets you 
send pictures to other Macs — perfect for grandparents. See Chapter 18.
Application software offerings
Although Macs come with an impressive array of easy-to-use applications 
that are ready to go, Apple sells a number of additional software tools. They 
break down into three groups, roughly by price and power.
Green Apples
Many people insist that corporations they buy 
from must address the impact of the corpora-
tion on global warming and other environmental 
problems. Apple takes these concerns seriously 
and has moved aggressively to make its 
products more green. Some of the steps Apple 
has taken include
 ✓ Improve the energy efficiency of its 
products, especially when they are in Idle 
or Standby mode. Idle computers consume 
substantial amounts of electricity, and 
much carbon dioxide — a major cause of 
global warming — is released, generating 
electricity. All Macs meet stringent 
EnergyStar 4.0 requirements. See www.
energystar.gov.
 ✓ Design its products to be easy to recycle. 
Apple fabricates the chassis of most new 
Macs from the metal aluminum, which is 
particularly easy to recycle and commands 
a high scrap value.
 ✓ Switch its displays to use LED back-
lighting. it’s more energy efficient than the 
fluorescent lamps that it and others previ-
ously used. LEDs are also mercury-free.
 ✓ Eliminate hazardous chemical use when 
making circuit boards, cables, and other 
components for its computers. These 
are now free of BFR and PVC and comply 
with European Union hazardous material 
reduction regulations (RoHS).
 ✓ Reduce the size and waste in its 
packaging.
 ✓ Provide a carbon lifecycle analysis of its 
products. This is something that few com-
panies do. You can find these reports at 
www.apple.com/environment/
resources/environmental
performance.html.
 ✓ Take back old computers and displays 
(even PCs) when you buy a new Mac. Apple 
recycles computers collected in North 
America at carefully vetted facilities in 
North America; it doesn’t ship equipment 
overseas for disposal. To find out about its 
recycling programs, see www.apple.
com/environment/recycling.
For more information on green Apples, visit 
www.apple.com/environment. I suggest 
other beneficial ways to use your computer in 
Chapter 21.

 Chapter 2: Meet the Mac Family
Small, extra-cost upgrades
Apple has a few of these, including QuickTime Pro and JamPacks, that add 
music and tools to GarageBand.
Advanced applications
These applications typically sell in the $80-to-$300 price range and are 
suitable for quality, commercial work. They include the following:
 
✓ Aperture: The top-of-the-line Apple solution for professional 
photographers.
 
✓ BentoBox: This simple-to-use, inexpensive but powerful personal 
database that syncs with a version for the iPhone and iPod touch.
 
✓ FileMaker: This full-featured database application is also available in a 
fully compatible version for Windows.
 
✓ Final Cut Express HD: A big step up from iMovie (the video-editing 
component of iLife) because it captures, edits, and outputs HDV 
(high-definition video).
 
✓ iWork: This Apple office suite includes the Pages word processor and 
page-layout program, Numbers spreadsheet, and Keynote, Apple’s 
answer to Microsoft PowerPoint presentation software.
 
✓ Logic Express: A powerful music-creation package.
Pro applications
These applications are world-class solutions that hold their own against 
any solution on the market and are generally less expensive than their top 
competitors:
 
✓ Final Cut Studio: Everything you need to edit and post-produce a full-
length feature motion picture or a TV series. Movies edited in Studio 
have won an Emmy and received one Oscar nomination. The package 
includes
 
• Color: Adjust the tone and color values of your film.
 
• Compressor: Convert between formats.
 
• DVD Studio Pro: Make professional DVD masters.
 
• Final Cut Pro: Use native HDV and real-time editing.
 
✓ Logic Pro: A powerful music composition tool that I don’t begin to 
understand.

52
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Server software solutions
Mac makes a mean server version of OS X, and the full version is licensed 
without the per-seat head tax that brand-M imposes. Server products include
 
✓ Apple Remote Desktop
 
✓ FileMaker Server, which doesn’t require OS X Server
 
✓ Mac OS X Server
 
✓ WebObjects for Java server applications
 
✓ Xsan Storage Area Network (SAN) for Mac OS X

B
uying a computer can be a bewildering experience. Stores are stuffed 
with oodles of models in different shapes and sizes, and they’re offered 
in a wide range of prices. Many of the options you’re asked to select involve 
options that only a geek could love, like the number of bytes of RAM to 
buy (what if I don’t like lamb?) or the hard drive capacity (what if I prefer a 
soft drive?).
Computer store sales staff can be helpful, but all too often they give 
questionable advice. Many aren’t knowledgeable about the latest features 
and software. Sometimes they receive financial incentives to sell in-stock 
models that aren’t moving.
Buying a Macintosh simplifies things quite a bit. Apple has only half a dozen 
or so models and relatively few options for each one. It doesn’t sell cheap, 
lowball models that require expensive upgrades to do anything useful. The 
lowest-price Apple models can more than meet the needs of most users.
Still, you need to make choices, and you generally should make your decision 
(or at least narrow it to a couple of possibilities) before you go off to the 
store or log on to Apple.com. In this chapter, you find tips that can help you 
decide which type of Mac suits your needs. (If you skipped the two preceding 
chapters, be sure to check out the detailed introduction to the different 
models in Chapter 2.) Switching to a Mac may also affect how you connect 
your computer accessories and access the features you need, because your 
new Mac is likely an upgrade to better technology and some ports and 
options on new Macs are different from those on older Windows computers. 
In this chapter, you find the most important concepts you need to know, and 
I provide a section at the end that helps you decide where to buy.

54
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Selecting a Conversion Strategy
Time to take a deep breath. Before I dig into which model and which options 
to buy, I want you to think about what you’re trying to accomplish and 
then consider the best way to get exactly what you want. (I’m just talking 
about computers here — don’t get excited). There’s more than one way to 
peel an Apple.
To begin, answer the following questions honestly (the mind-reading chip in 
the spine of this book is automatically disabled when you’re on this page, so 
no one will know your answers):
 
✓ How often do you use your computer? Is it less than once a week, 
several times a week, every day, or hours each day?
 
✓ What do you use your computer for? Do you crunch numbers in a 
spreadsheet, write For Dummies books, check social networking sites 
such as Facebook.com, surf the Internet, text friends, look for soulmates, 
download music, or play games?
 
✓ Which new tasks do you want to use it for? Do you want to organize 
photos, develop a Web site, podcast, or edit movies?
 
✓ Where do you use your computer? Do you use it in a den or office, 
anywhere in the house you feel like, at work, at work and at home, or 
on the road?
 
✓ What’s your budget? Do you want to spend less than $1,000, $1,000 to 
$2,000, or whatever it takes?
Depending on your answers, you have several different switching approaches 
to consider. I try to group them sensibly and give the categories cute, easy-
to-remember names.
 
I’m not a big fan of computers for small children. They spend, and will spend, 
too much of their lives in front of video screens as it is. But if you’re buying a 
computer for your kid or kids, make sure that you understand how to set 
limits (by using parental controls). OS X has some useful features to help you 
enforce them. Before buying anything, be sure to look carefully at the section 
that discusses Macs for kids in Chapter 17.
Taking it slow
No need to rush things. The Mac mini is perfect if you’re the cautious type 
who wants to convert gradually and not spend a lot of money. Start out 
with worry-free Internet surfing and switch over additional applications as 

55
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
you become more comfortable with OS X. Of course, you can use the spiffy 
iLife applications that come with the Mac mini as soon as you set it up. 
Taking it slowly, which can be the lowest-cost conversion strategy, assumes 
that you already have a fairly up-to-date PC set up with a good-quality CRT 
or flat-panel display. All you really need to buy is a Mac mini. The tiny mini 
doesn’t take up much room — it’s not much bigger than an external CD 
burner. Just find a spare outlet for it on your power strip.
If you don’t have a compatible USB keyboard and mouse, you can add those 
items to your shopping list — literally. Many supermarkets now carry these 
accessories.
 
For extra convenience, purchase a USB KVM switch, which lets you share a 
keyboard, mouse, and display between two computers. (More expensive KVM 
models can support more than two computers.) In a KVM setup, you can work 
on the PC and, after pressing a special key combination on your keyboard, 
quickly switch to the Mac and check a Web site and then return to the PC with 
another key press. Be sure to buy a USB KVM switch, not the more common 
PS/2 type. (I’m assuming that your PC is new enough to have a USB port. If it 
isn’t, you need a separate keyboard and mouse for your Mac.) I tell you more 
about which items to buy later in this chapter, and I describe how to hook up 
a KVM switch in Chapter 4.
If your PC is already part of a Wi-Fi wireless network, you can easily incorpo-
rate the mini into the network. If you don’t have one, you may need an 
Ethernet router and a cable — inexpensive items. See Chapter 9 for details.
Macs tend to keep their resale value longer than PCs, so you aren’t taking 
much of a financial risk with this approach. If you aren’t happy with the Mac 
mini, you probably won’t have any trouble unloading it on eBay or craigslist.
Living on the go
If you travel a lot or simply like to work or be online in different parts of your 
house, a MacBook or MacBook Pro laptop may be just right for you. If you 
need to bring your computer to work and also have it at home, you probably 
already have a laptop, but maybe you want something more up-to-date.
Mac laptops are complete, powerful computer systems. They’re elegant-
looking and priced competitively with all but the cheapest PC laptops. You 
can buy one and still keep your PC setup intact. They can network with your 
PC, just like the mini, and you can even hook one up to a KVM switch when 
you have it at home, so that you can use your keyboard, mouse, and display 
with the Mac laptop.

56
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Giving your PC the heave-ho
Maybe you’re the type who just dives into the pool without dipping your toe 
in first. You may as well plan on just replacing your PC with a new Mac. I tell 
you how to transfer all your files in Chapter 6. Either the iMac or MacBook 
model can take your old PC’s place in the home:
 
✓ A desktop iMac can fit on your desk where the PC display now sits.
 
 If you have a good-quality video display and enough room, you can 
keep your display on your desk and plug it into the iMac for two-screen 
computing. You need a video adapter cable, and all you have to do is tell 
the iMac where the other display sits relative to the iMac so that OS X 
knows how to match them up to allow you to drag windows from one 
screen to the other, across the adjacent screen edges.
 
✓ If your only computer is a laptop, switching to a MacBook or MacBook 
Pro is simple. If the PC laptop has Wi-Fi networking, the two laptops 
should talk to each other without much ado, allowing you to transfer 
files. (See Chapter 9.) Otherwise, a simple Ethernet cable should do the 
trick. If the laptop is so old that it has no network port, you have to get a 
bit more creative, and I cover those details in Chapter 6.
Spending lots of dough
If you have the money, I recommend a Mac Pro with the large Apple Cinema 
Display — or, even better, two Cinema displays. (Al Gore has three.) It’ll 
knock your socks off. And while you’re at it, grab a thin, light MacBook 
Air laptop to take with you on trips and some MacBooks that other family 
members can use. (You weren’t going to stick your kids or spouse with that 
old PC, were you?)
Why not Linux?
You have another way to escape the clutches of 
Microsoft that’s cheaper than buying a new 
Mac. You have no doubt heard of Linux, an 
operating system developed by volunteer com-
puter programmers. Linux is closely related to 
the Unix operating system that underlies Mac 
OS X, but differences exist. Linux was once a 
toy for übergeeks, but it has come a long way. 
Some people now use it as their only personal 
computer operating system. You can probably 
use it with your existing PC hardware. But Linux 
still lacks the polish and ease of use of a Mac or 
even a Windows PC. If you’re technically 
inclined and want to find out how operating 
systems work, by all means give Linux a try. 
Readers of this book are probably better off 
with a commercially supported operating 
system. The good news is that much of the 
software that runs on Linux also runs on Macs. 
See Chapter 19.

57
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
Gaming glow
Does playing computer games, particularly those with detailed three-
dimensional visuals, dominate your computer use? Your life? If so, you can 
get by with the lower end of the Mac line (the mini, the MacBook, and 
the low-end iMac), all three use a built-in NVIDIA GeForce 9400M graphics 
processor that’s quite powerful. But for higher performance, most MacBook 
Pros, the high-end iMac, and the Mac Pro blast out 3D imagery with more 
powerful graphics engines. The Mac Pro accepts graphics cards from either 
ATI or NVIDIA.
Relaxing as a couch potat-oh
Computers are invading our living rooms. The home entertainment center is 
going online. Channel surfing is merging with Internet surfing. If nothing on 
the tube is worth watching, try YouTube. If you want to integrate your Mac 
with your TV watching, you have these options:
 
✓ Set up a few cables and then relax: All Macs have video outputs 
designed to display stunning images on large-format, high-definition 
TVs and displays — though you probably need adapter cables. See the 
section “Ports that require an adapter for Macs,” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Integrate your computer and TV: The simple-to-use Apple Remote 
coupled with a Mac mini can let you effortlessly switch among broadcast 
content, Internet feed, home movies and slide shows, and other video 
material.
 
✓ Never get off the sofa: Alternatively, you can buy the $229 Apple TV 
(ÚTV), which connects with Macs and Windows PCs around your 
house by way of wireless (or wired) Ethernet. You can play downloaded 
digital content — movies, TV shows, music videos, songs — as well as 
home videos and photos right on your large-screen HDTV or projection 
system. It’s all controlled by the same tiny Apple remote.
Following the KISS principle
KISS stands for keep it simple, stupid. Whichever way you go, I recommend 
that you start with your Mac configured pretty much the way it is when 
it comes out of the box. You can customize lots of settings, and you can 
download software add-ons. But the less of this you do, the less likely you 
are to get into trouble and the easier it is to obtain support. I mention a few 
customizations that I think are worthwhile later in this book.

Figuring Out What’s on Your 
Windows Computer
Before deciding what to buy, figure out what’s on your existing computer. 
You want your new Mac to have at least the capabilities of your present 
Getting a Mac for less
Bargain hunting is harder in the Mac world than 
it is in the PC world. Generally, price reductions 
happen most often when the inventory of a 
product is too high or when a new product is 
about to be introduced. Because so many PC 
manufacturers exist, these supply problems 
happen often for PCs. Apple, however, has 
better control of its distribution chain and tries 
very hard to keep Macintosh clearance sales 
from happening. They still do appear, but 
nowhere nearly as often as with PCs, and even 
when they do, the price cuts are rarely as 
dramatic. If you’re ready to buy a Mac, it’s not 
worth waiting months for one of these sales. 
Peripheral devices such as printers, scanners, 
and hard drives are another matter — they’re 
often discounted. Apple also sometimes offers 
refurbished Macs at its online store. They 
typically come with the standard Apple war-
ranty. You can search the Apple Store with the 
keyword refurbished to find what’s on sale.
Apple often offers an education discount, so if 
you have an affiliation with an educational insti-
tution (student, teacher, staff member), bring ID 
with you when you visit the Apple Store. In my 
experience, the store staff is liberal in which 
types it accepts.
I also don’t recommend buying a used 
Mac in most cases. There’s something about 
unpacking a brand-new machine and setting it 
up that builds confidence. You know the stuff 
was recently tested at the factory and should 
work. You have Apple tech support and, possi-
bly, the people at the retail store to call on if you 
have trouble. In the worst case, you can return 
the Mac for a refund. Switching from one com-
puter system to another is a complex enough 
task without having to worry about possible 
hardware problems. And you may not find much 
of a bargain — Macs tend to command higher 
prices on the used market than PCs of compa-
rable vintage. But if you want to try your luck on 
the used market, here are some tips.
 ✓ Buy locally, such as from www.craigs
list.com or someone you know, and 
pick up your Mac in person. That way, you 
can check it out before you hand over 
money. You also avoid the risk of product 
damage during shipping.
 ✓ Buy only a used Mac that has an Intel 
processor. Select the About This Mac 
option from the Apple (Ú) menu to see the 
processor type. Macs sold before 2006 use 
a different microprocessor, the PowerPC, 
or, if it’s really old, a Motorola 68k series. 
These models are significantly slower, and 
Apple support for PowerPC machines is 
winding down. (The 68k models are for 
antique computer collectors only — a fun 
hobby, but not what this book is about.)
 ✓ If possible, find a machine that has time 
remaining on an AppleCare contract.
 ✓ Don’t pay more than the price of a new, 
low-end Mac. A new Macbook will likely 
approach or better the performance of a 
used MacBook Pro, for example, and you 
receive all the benefits of a new unit.

computer, plus lots of room to grow. You may know some of this information, 
and much of it may be on the sales receipt or the original box your computer 
came in. Of course, if you have added options and peripherals, that info may 
be out-of-date.
 
If you’re having trouble with your PC, skip this section for now and see the 
section on recovering data from a damaged PC in Chapter 6.
The easiest way to find the information on your current configuration is to 
ask Windows to give it to you. Follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Start➪My Computer.
 
 The My Computer window should appear, and you should see a section 
labeled Hard Disk Drives. If more than one drive is shown, start with the 
drive labeled C:.
 
2. Select your C drive and then choose File➪Properties. (Or, you can 
right-click the drive and choose Properties.)
 
 Figure 3-1 shows the Drive C: Properties window, which tells you how 
much disk space is used and how much is available.
 
3. Make a note of the drive’s total capacity and how much of it is used 
space.
 
 The numbers to the right, shown in gigabytes (GB), are all you need. You 
can organize your notes in the following form:

4. When you’re done, click the Cancel button to close the drive’s 
Properties window.
 
5. Repeat this procedure for any other hard drives shown in the My

Navigating from PC to Mac Ports
When you’re deciding which Mac model to buy (and what you can afford), 
you need to figure out which of the devices you already own will work with 
your selected model. Unfortunately, few things about computers are as 

61
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
confusing and annoying as the bowl of spaghetti wiring underneath the desk. 
That’s why you find in this section a quick guide to what goes where in the 
Mac world. Much of it is the same as on a modern PC, but some old favorites 
are no longer with us. In many cases, you can buy adapters to make the 
necessary connections; in other cases, well, it’s time to move on.
Finding your way in the back of a Mac
When you’re trying to figure out where to plug things in, the good news is 
that Apple keeps things simple by limiting the number of ports it uses, and it 
has a good track record of picking the most useful ones. In the sections that 
follow, I summarize the ports available in new Macs now on the market. 
Except as noted, the ports in this section are common to all current Macs. 
They’re also common on late-model PCs.
 
If a plug doesn’t fit into a jack with a firm but modest push, don’t try to force it 
in. Triple-check to make sure that the shapes and icons match up exactly, and 
then look for dirt or other obstacles in both the plug and jack.
Audio input and output
All Macs come with two little round jacks that look like the earphone jacks 
on a portable radio or an iPod. One of them is marked with a tiny pair of 
earphones. The other is a line-in jack, which accepts audio from other 
devices. Both accept 1/8-inch (3.5 mm) stereo plugs, and you can buy a wide 
variety of cables, adapters, and other accessories that work with them at 
your local Radio Shack. But these diminutive jacks are much cleverer than 
that. They also can work with newer optical digital audio devices that use the 
TOSLINK standard, which is becoming more popular in the world of con-
sumer electronics. If you shine a light down the little hole, you can see the 
tiny optical port in the center shining back at you.
Ethernet
Ethernet is the most popular technology for enabling computers to talk 
to each other over a wire. Ethernet came from the same Xerox lab that 
developed the graphical interface that the Mac first popularized. Ethernet is 
available in 10, 100, and 1,000 Mbps versions. Macs support all three, except 
for the Macbook Air, which requires an optional, separate adapter for wired 
Ethernet.
Ethernet connectors look like fatter versions of the connectors used on 
most telephones in North America. Just like with the telephone connectors, 
you find a little, easy-to-break plastic tab that you have to squeeze to pull 
the connector out. Be gentle.

62

Don’t plug your telephone line into this port — it could damage your com-
puter. Current Macs don’t have built-in telephone modems. Apple sells an 
external modem that plugs into a USB port.
ExpressCard/34 (17-inch MacBook Pro only)
The ExpressCard/34 is a standard for expansion modules, which are basically 
cards that you can slide into personal computers, though they’re mostly 
used with laptops.
Only the 17-inch MacBook Pro has an ExpressCard/34 slot. Figure 3-3 shows 
a MacBook Pro with an ExpressCard/34 card installed to access Verizon 
wireless Internet service. Accessing such a wide-area network is probably the 
most common use for the ExpressCard/34 slot.
As its name implies, the ExpressCard/34 card is 34 millimeters (mm) wide, 
about two-thirds the size of a credit card. It replaces an older standard 
known as CardBus PC card, or PCMCIA card. You can also find bigger 
ExpressCard/54 cards (54 mm wide), but no current Apple models support 
them. See www.expresscard.org for more info on which devices are 
available in this format. But before buying one, make sure the manufacturer 
offers Mac drivers.
FireWire
Apple created a different serial bus, FireWire, to support connecting high-
speed devices. Also known as IEEE-1394, it comes in two speeds: 400 megabits 
per second (Mbps) and 800 Mbps. A number of camcorder manufacturers 
adopted FireWire 400 (Sony calls it i.Link), but USB 2.0 is almost as fast and 
most non-tape video recorders now use USB 2.0. Only the white plastic 
MacBook has a FireWire 400 port. High-end Macs sport FireWire 800 ports, 
which use a different connector, although 800-to-400 adapters are available 
and inexpensive.

 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
Infrared
Infrared (IR) is a form of invisible light that’s used in most remote controls 
supplied with televisions, stereos, and other devices. When you press a 
button on the remote, it projects a beam of invisible light out the front 
that’s coded with a signal that tells the TV or other device which button you 
pushed. A magic spot on your TV or device receives these IR signals, and if 
you point the remote in its general direction, the device should do what you 
wanted. A Mac can work with its own, optional Apple Remote, so it has a 
magic spot too.
Mini DisplayPort
Older (analog) methods of sending signals to displays limit the quality of 
pictures that can be shown. A Mini DisplayPort sends images to the display 
in digital form, preserving the images’ full fidelity for viewing on flat-panel 
computer displays and high-definition televisions (HDTVs). The white 
MacBook uses a variant, the mini-DVI connector. The mini has both. 
Apple and other vendors sell converter cables that let you hook up Mini 
DisplayPort and mini-DVI ports to most digital and analog video displays, 
including most large-screen television sets.
PCI Express (Mac Pro and Xserve only)
Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCI Express or PCIe) is the 
newest, blazingly fast incarnation of the classic open-the-cover-and-plug-a-
card-in-the-motherboard expansion model. Only the Mac Pro and the Xserve 
now have these slots. The Pro has four of them, one of which is typically 
occupied by the graphics card. You can use the slots to add more graphics 
cards or for ultra-high-speed communications cards, and they’re handy for 
other specialized applications. These capabilities excite video producers and 
serious gamers, but if you don’t know why you need expansion cards, you 
probably don’t need one.
PCI Express isn’t compatible with the older PCI or PCI-X cards. Xserve has 
three slots that can accept a PCI-X card, one of which is occupied by a 
graphics card.
Universal Serial Bus (USB)
Intel invented USB technology to let a wide variety of low- and medium-speed 
devices connect to a computer using only one type of port. Apple was the 
first to popularize it for use with keyboards and mice. USB is a bus because 
more than one device can share the same port. Serial means that all the 
data marches down a single pair of wires. The current version, USB 2.0, can 
support high-speed devices such as disk drives. All new Macs have two or 
more USB 2.0 ports. Older USB 1.0 and 1.1 devices should plug in and work 
fine in a USB 2.0 port, though they can slow it down.

64
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
Strictly speaking, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth aren’t ports in that there’s no place to 
connect a wire. That’s because they support wireless communications. Wi-Fi 
is mostly used for networking computers within a home or office, and is 
essentially Ethernet without wires. Bluetooth has a shorter range and is 
mainly for connecting small devices, such as printers, wireless keyboards 
and mice, and for wireless headsets of the type used with cellphones. Macs 
generally support both, though Wi-Fi is optional on the Mac Pro.
Ports that require an adapter for Macs
If you have a device with a connection type that a Mac doesn’t support 
directly, you might still be able to connect your device by using an adapter. 
This section covers the types of connections that Macs no longer support, 
but that you can still use with an adapter. By adding the adapters you need 
to your list of items to buy, you can get your new Mac setup running quickly, 
with less hassle.
 
Before you buy any adapter, make sure that the manufacturer supports the 
latest version of Mac OS X. Many don’t support Mac, and some support only 
Mac OS 9 or old versions of OS X. Also realize that when an adapter maker 
says that it supports OS X, it doesn’t guarantee that your printer, scanner, or 
digital bread maker will work perfectly. If you’re buying new stuff, avoid 
peripherals that require an adapter.
Camera memory cards: The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros come with an SD 
card slot, where you can plug in the SD memory cards used in many digital 
cameras and camcorders. Many other card types are out there, but Apple 
apparently chose not to clutter its spiffy boxes with half a dozen camera card 
slots. USB adapters that accept most card types are inexpensive and readily 
available, and you can always hook up your camera by using a USB cable.
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI): This high-performance data net-
work sends information over optical fibers rather than wires. You need a Mac 
Pro or Xserve and a PCI Express FDDI card, which Apple sells and supports.
High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI): HDMI input is standard on 
most flat-panel and high-definition televisions. Although many also allow 
analog input, HDMI is the input to use if you want the video quality you’re 
paying those big bucks for. Apple and other vendors, such as Monoprice.
com, sell adapters that let you connect a Mac to that HDMI port. You may 
also need a separate connection for audio. You’ll be amazed when your 
Mac’s display fills your living room wall. You’ll also need a separate cable 
for audio. See RCA audio later in this list.

65
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI): This music industry standard 
was introduced in 1983 for connecting musical keyboards (the ones with 
black-and-white ivories, not the kind you write e-mail on). The Apple Core 
Audio offers strong MIDI support in software. Many new MIDI devices 
use USB or FireWire interfaces and work directly with Macs that have the 
appropriate interface. Older instruments may have a 5-pin DIN connector 
and, yup, you need an adapter.
Modem: Macs no longer come with dialup modem ports (the type you can 
plug a phone line into). Apple sells a modem built into a short cable that 
plugs into a USB port for about $50. Other USB modems are on the market, 
some cheaper, but make sure that they support Mac OS X.
Parallel printer (IEEE-1284): This printer interface is also known as a 
Centronics port, named after a long-defunct company that made printers for 
minicomputers back when Richard Nixon was president. If you have a printer 
you love that talks only parallel port, Keyspan.com makes a USB–to–parallel 
port adapter that supports OS X.
RCA audio: This simple connector (which dates back to the early 1940s) is 
common on home audio systems. Belkin Monoprice.com and Radio Shack sell 
a cheap cable that plugs into your Mac’s 3.5 mm stereo audio output and has 
a pair of RCA plugs at the other end that can be inserted in your stereo. For 
RCA video, see the S-Video bullet, near the end of this list.
Small computer system interface (SCSI): Apple popularized this interface for 
hard drives with the Mac Plus, and SCSI (pronounced “scuzzy”) is still used in 
high-end applications. However, Apple has long since adopted the Serial ATA 
standard used by most PC manufacturers. USB-SCSI adapters are available, 
but they generally don’t work with OS X. Ratoc Systems, Inc. (www.ratoc
systems.com), sells a FireWire-to-SCSI adapter that it claims does work with 
OS X. It’s a tad pricey, and it uses the latest UltraSCSI connector, so you will 
need special cables for first-generation SCSI devices. That old SCSI scanner 
had better be worth it.
Serial port (RS-232, RS-422): Apple largely dropped serial ports in favor of 
USB ports when it introduced the first iMac. (A serial port is provided on the 
Xserve back panel because the server world expects one.) Several companies 
sell USB–to–serial port adapters. Try Keyspan.com and Serialio.com. You 
can also buy Bluetooth-to-serial adapters that let you control serial devices 
without running wires.
S-Video: Apple sells an inexpensive adapter that converts your Mac’s video 
output to S-Video and composite video (an RCA jack), the two most common 
analog television standards. With one of these adapters, you can show your 
photo collection on any TV with a video input jack.

66
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Video Graphics Array (VGA) and Super VGA: VGA and SVGA are by far the 
most popular ports for connecting older analog computer monitors. Apple 
offers adapters that connect VGA/SVGA displays and other devices to the 
Mac’s video output port. This adapter is free with some Mac models and an 
extra-cost (about $20) option with others.
Stuff that won’t work
You may have some plug-in cards that do specialized tasks in your PC. 
Sorry, but unless they’re PCI Express (PCIe), they don’t work on a current 
Mac. Much of the functionality that these cards were used for, such as 
Ethernet networking, is built into Macs, and USB and FireWire devices 
replace other uses.
Using Your Old Equipment with a Mac
If you’ve been a PC user for a while, you probably have purchased a 
number of accessories. Some of them may be usable with your new Mac, 
saving you the expense of buying new stuff. Whether a particular device is 
Mac compatible depends on its port interface — the type of cable you 
use to hook it to the computer — and whether Mac software is available that 
works with the device.
You might also consider the device’s age and whether your new Mac will 
offer a different and improved way of accomplishing what your old, familiar 
accessories do. Older devices may not have that much life left in them, and 
worse, they may simply be obsolete. Maybe you have a SCSI Zip drive. The 
storage capacity of a Zip drive was impressive in its day, but it’s now dwarfed 
by the capacity of a cheap CD-RW disc that’s usable in any Mac, so it may not 
be worth finding an adapter that lets you hook it up to your new Mac unless 
you have a large collection of Zip disks — and even then, you’re probably 
better off copying them to your PC and then transferring them to the Mac. Or, 
you could look for a Zip drive with a USB connection. It should work on a Mac 
with no fuss.
 
I can’t possibly discuss every combination of Mac model, non-Apple device, 
and software version, so check with the device manufacturer where possible.
Displays and projectors
If you’re buying a mini or Mac Pro, using the display you have can save you 
money. A high-end display often costs more than a computer. Even if you’re 
buying a Mac with a built-in display, an extra display is handy. A Mac can use 

67
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
it as an extension to the desktop area, letting you drag an icon or window 
from one screen to the other. Or, you can set up the second display to mirror 
what you’re seeing on your main display — handy for letting others see what 
you’re doing. (Select System Preferences from the Apple menu and click the 
Displays icon to set it all up.)
The following sections help you assess what you need in order to connect 
your Mac to commonly used displays.
CRT displays
CRT (cathode ray tube) displays are rapidly going the way of the dinosaur, 
perhaps for the same reason: They are too big and consume too much 
energy. Still, if you have a good-quality display and a tight budget or if you 
need the richer color fidelity that CRTs offer for high-end graphics work, 
using that old CRT might make sense. The good news is that almost all 
computer-grade CRTs produced since the 1990s use a VGA cable that should 
work fine with the Apple VGA adapter.
Otherwise, you should replace that CRT with an iMac, saving you acres of 
space on and under your desk — and you have no display cables to worry 
about. See how to recycle your old CRT safely in Chapter 22.
Flat-screen displays and HDTVs
Flat screens work fine with Macs, including those with built-in displays. The 
same goes for flat-panel or high-definition television sets. The only question 
is whether to connect your Mac to your flat-screen display or HDTV using a 
digital or an analog interface (that is, the available port where you connect 
the cable from your Mac to your display). In either case, make sure that 
you have the right adapter cables. Digital and analog interfaces are described 
in this list:
 
✓ Digital: Digital connections generally produce better results. For a 
digital interface, see which video output connector your Mac has (see 
Chapter 2) and which connector or cable your display has. You may 
need more than one cable. For example, if your Mac comes with a 
Mini DisplayPort (most do) and your HDTV has an HDMI connector on 
the back, you need to get a Mini DisplayPort to dual-link DVI cable 
and a DVI-to-HDMI cable. Check the booklet that came with your display 
and the booklet that came with your Mac for details about your specific 
equipment. Also see the list of connector types in the section 
“Navigating from PC to Mac Ports,” earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Analog: You need a VGA adapter that you plug into the DVI port on 
your Mac. Some Macs come with these adapters; otherwise, order one 
from Apple.

68
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Projectors
Big-screen projectors and PowerPoint presentations dominate business 
communication these days and are rapidly taking over our schools. We hate 
to contribute to this cultural disaster, but the truth is that these projectors 
generally work with a Mac. Most take VGA, so you need that VGA adapter.
Keyboard and mouse
When deciding whether you can use a keyboard or mouse that you already 
have, here’s the short version of the story:
 
✓ If you have a two-button scroll wheel mouse with a wire coming out of 
it that has a USB connector: If you have this flat, rectangular, metal plug 
(which is about the size of a fingernail) at the other end, it’s something 
worth keeping.
 
✓ If you have a Windows keyboard with a USB connector: It works fine, 
but a couple of keys are labeled differently from Mac keyboards, and 
that may make it more trouble than it’s worth.
 
✓ If you have a cool keyboard or mouse or another pointing device 
that you like: You might have wireless, for example — read on for the 
longer story.
 
✓ If you have some old piece of junk: Skip this section and buy 
something new.
Connections, connections
Check how your keyboard and mouse connect to your PC. The three most 
common methods are a USB cable, a PS/2 cable, and wireless:
 
✓ A USB cable should work just fine with your Mac.
 
✓ A PS/2 connector is round and has a pastel-colored shell. PS/2 doesn’t 
work with your Mac.
 
 These days, many manufacturers make only USB keyboards and mice 
and include an adapter that converts it to PS/2. So take a closer look 
at what you think is a PS/2 plug to see whether it’s just one of these 
adapters, in which case you’re in luck — just pull the USB plug from the 
adapter and plug it into your Mac.
 
✓ Wireless devices have a built-in radio transmitter rather than a wire. 
The receiver is often in a finger-size pod that plugs into the computer, or 
it can be built in. Some devices transmit using technology that’s proprie-
tary to the maker; others use Bluetooth. All Macs come with Bluetooth 

69
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
inside, and Bluetooth devices generally work with Bluetooth-equipped 
Macs. But you may need special software to take full advantage of this 
feature on a Mac. A wireless device that uses a USB receiver module and 
a proprietary transmission scheme may need special software as well. 
Check with the manufacturer in either case.
Keyboard layout
Mac keyboards have two special keys in the lowest row, to the left of the 
spacebar. One is labeled Option, and to its right is a key with an Apple 
logo (Ú) and a fan symbol (Ô), known as the Command key in Apple-ese. 
On PC keyboards, these two keys are the Windows key and the Alt key, 
respectively. If you just plug a PC keyboard into a Mac, the Windows key 
works as the Command key, and the Alt key works as the Option key. 
Unfortunately, their positions are reversed from where they are on Mac key-
boards. Because you’re new to the Mac way of doing things, you don’t need 
this tactile confusion. You can buy the DoubleCommand software (http://
doublecommand.sourceforge.net), which lets you reverse these keys.
 
If all this seems more trouble than it’s worth (I think so), buy a Mac keyboard. 
Apple offers both wired (USB) and wireless keyboards. You can choose a 
wired keyboard with or without a numeric keypad. Figure 3-4 shows an Apple 
wireless keyboard, with its special keys.

KVM switch
A KVM switch lets you share your keyboard, video display, and mouse 
between two computers — more than two with fancier KVM models. Some 
KVMs also let you share a set of audio speakers or headphones. Two types of 
KVM switches are available, based on the type of connection they use for the 
keyboard and mouse: USB and PS/2. Buy only a USB KVM switch. Most recent 
PCs accept a USB input connection for the mouse and keyboard.

70
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
 
Many USB keyboards and mice come with USB-to-PS/2 adapters. The adapters 
aren’t general-purpose converters, however. The USB keyboards and mice are 
smart enough to also talk PS/2, and the adapters just take the wires from the 
USB connector and jigger them into a PS/2 plug. Don’t expect one of these 
adapters to convert the USB output of your KVM switch to PS/2.
Relics of days gone by
The mice and keyboards supplied with computers in the 1980s used RS-232 
serial port connections. They’re useless. Old Apple USB keyboards work fine 
on current Macs. If you have an older Apple keyboard or mouse with a round 
plug (Apple Desktop Bus), you can get an ADB-to-USB converter, but it’s 
probably not worth the bother.
Printers, scanners, and fax machines
If you want to use your current printer, scanner, or fax machine with your 
new Mac, you may not have to buy anything extra or you may need an 
adapter. The following tips can help you figure out what you need to do:
 
✓ If your PC printer is of reasonably recent vintage and connects with 
USB, Ethernet, or Wi-Fi, it probably works with your Mac with little 
fuss. Macs come with oodles of drivers installed for current devices, 
though it never hurts to check for updated Mac drivers at the printer 
manufacturer’s Web site.
 
✓ Older printers with parallel ports require USB–to–parallel port adapters, 
and chances of them working are a bit more iffy.
 
✓ All-in-one units generally work, but some features, such as receiving 
faxes to your hard drive, may not work with the Mac. (Get an Apple USB 
modem if your all-in-one’s fax feature doesn’t play Mac.)
 
The mantra again is to check with the manufacturer.
The scanner story is much the same. Recent USB and FireWire scanners 
should be fine, the latter assuming that your Mac has a FireWire port. Older 
SCSI devices need a pricey SCSI-to-FireWire adapter and still may not work. I 
wouldn’t bother.
I talk about how to set up printers in OS X in Chapter 5.
External hard drives and flash drives
External hard drives and flash drives are those storage devices you can plug 
into your computer by using USB or FireWire connections. If you have one of 
these drives, you know how handy it is for storing backups or transferring 

71
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
files. USB and FireWire external hard drives should work fine, even if they 
were been formatted for your PC. Just plug them into the appropriate Mac 
port, and a drive icon appears on the desktop, which you can then click to 
access your files. The same goes for USB flash drives.
All Macs except the MacBook Air come with a CD and DVD burner — the 
SuperDrive. Apple sells an external SuperDrive for the Air.
An external USB or FireWire DVD reader or burner can come in handy if you 
want to watch DVDs from countries outside your zone. (The movie industry 
has obnoxiously chopped up the world into six zones, and Macs can play 
DVDs from only one zone.)
Internal drives
Because new drives have so much more capacity than those from even a 
couple of years ago, reusing internal hard drives may not be worth the 
bother. If you have an internal drive that you want to use in your new Mac, 
you can also buy hard drive enclosures that let you install your PC’s internal 
hard drive and then plug it into your Mac via USB 2.0 or, if you have it, 
FireWire. You need to know which type of connection your hard drive uses.
Networking devices
Most of the hardware you use to create a home network (technically, a local-
area network, or LAN) for sharing broadband Internet access should work 
with a Mac, including the items described in this list:
 
✓ Ethernet switches and routers and Ethernet cabling: Create a network 
with wires.
 
 If you decide to buy a new Ethernet router or hub, be sure to get a 
model that supports at least 100Base-T speeds (1000Base-T is blazingly 
fast but expensive and probably more than you need). If you own older 
10Base-T equipment, you can use it, if you like.
 
✓ Cable modems and DSL modems: These modems come with high-speed 
Internet connections from your cable or digital subscriber line (DSL) 
provider, respectively. In all likelihood, you don’t need any different 
hardware to use your existing Internet connection with your Mac.
 
✓ Wireless routers and access points: Set up the popular Wi-Fi wireless 
networking. The 802.11a, b, g, and n standards also work with a Mac. 
The n version is the fastest, and b is the slowest.

72
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
 
 Wi-Fi networks work at the speed of the slowest device on the network, 
so an older laptop that supports only 802.11b is best left off the network 
when it isn’t needed.
 
 The Wi-Fi standard 802.11a operates in a different frequency band 
(5 GHz) from b and g modes (2.4 GHz). The radios in Wi-Fi-equipped 
Macs can operate on the 802.11a band as well, and newer models can 
work both bands simultaneously.
Digital cameras and camcorders
Macs and OS X provide extensive support for digital photography. Macs 
work with most digital cameras and support the RAW mode that high-end 
cameras produce when you want the best-quality images from them. The 
most common way to connect a camera to your Mac is by using a USB cable. 
The 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros come with an SD card slot, the most popu-
lar high-end camera memory card. Macally.com sells an ExpressCard Media 
Reader that works with a 17-inch MacBook Pro. (For details about ExpressCard 
technology, see the section “ExpressCard/34,” earlier in this chapter.)
Digital video recorders are also well supported. Some use USB 2.0, and 
others use FireWire, though manufacturers may call it IEEE-1394 or i.Link 
(the Sony brand name). USB works fine on all Macs; for FireWire, you need a 
FireWire-equipped Mac and, likely, a FireWire 400 to FireWire 800 adapter. 
The movie-editing software that comes with new Macs also supports the 
new high-definition (HD) camcorders, so you’re ready for the latest in 
videography.
PC cards
PC cards, also known as PCMCIA cards, are about the size of credit cards, 
though a bit thicker, and they’re designed to plug into special slots on PCs — 
primarily, laptops. The good news is that many of the capabilities that PC 
cards were typically used for, such as adding Ethernet, are built into Macs or 
can be added in other ways, such as with the Apple USB modem.
If you need to add functionality to your Mac by using a card, you have a 
couple of options:
 
✓ Get a MacBook pro with ExpressCard/34. ExpressCard/34 slots are 
basically the latest version of the PC card technology. With the introduc-
tion of Intel-based laptops, Apple switched to this newer standard. The 
ExpressCard, which is a little smaller than a PCMCIA card but has a 
much faster connection to a computer’s innards, is available for many 
other uses because newer PC laptops come with ExpressCard slots, too.

73
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
 
 ExpressCard/34 is available only on the 17-inch MacBook Pro.
 
✓ Get a USB PC card reader that works with your card. If you depend on 
a PC card for what you do, this may be your only choice. You insert your 
PC card into the reader and then plug the reader into your Mac by using 
the USB port.
Portable music players and cellphones
Needless to say, iPods and iPhones work hand in glove with Macs — after all, 
Apple makes both items.
Most other music players can connect to your Mac by way of USB so that 
you can at least transfer music files in an open format (such as MP3) to the 
player. Non-Apple players don’t play songs purchased from the iTunes Store 
directly under OS X; however, you can burn a playlist to CD and then read it 
back in and transfer the files to your player.
The Microsoft Zune music player doesn’t even have this USB option. Some 
third party may create a way to transfer files between Macs and Zunes, and 
of course, you can run Windows on the Mac and transfer files that way. But 
if you’re seriously considering purchasing a Mac and a Zune, you may be 
reading the wrong self-help book.
Miscellany
You probably have accumulated a pile of computer-related items. Some of 
them are still useful, and others can be given away or recycled. This list gives 
you the rundown:
Blank discs: Keep full-size blank CD-Rs and DVD-Rs. Miniature discs and discs 
the size of credit cards don’t work in the Mac’s slot-loading drive (don’t even 
try it), though they work in external tray-loading optical drives. Blank floppy 
and Zip disks can go away unless you work with folks who still use them and 
can get hold of an external drive that supports them. (Save one floppy disk to 
show your grandchildren.)
Cables: Ethernet, USB, and FireWire cables are worth hanging on to. Serial, 
SCSI, and proprietary cables can go. The ubiquitous 3-pin power cords used 
with most desktop PCs (IEC–C13) don’t fit most Macs. One or two are always 
handy to keep around, however, for peripherals.
Computer furniture: A desk is a desk, and switching to a Mac can free some 
space on one, but if yours doesn’t have good ergonomic design (see www.
apple.com/about/ergonomics) or just looks terrible, it may be time for 
an upgrade.

Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Floppy disk holders: Holders for the ancient 51/4-inch floppy disks are 
handy for CDs and DVDs. Holders for 31/2-inch disks are good for organizing 
tchotchkes such as flash drives, the Apple Remote, camera memory cards, 
and small cable adapters.
Power strips and surge protectors: You always need more of these.
Printing supplies: You can use your printer paper, address labels, and ink or 
toner cartridges for your printer, if you’re keeping it.
Uninterruptible power supply (UPS): Some of these connect to your com-
puter to tell it to shut down when the power goes out. Check with the UPS 
manufacturer to see whether it has Mac software to support this feature. If 
not, you can still use it to supply backup power.
USB and FireWire hubs: Connect more than one device to a single port. 
Don’t forget to save the matching power supply, if you have one.
Getting Ready to Buy
After you review the different approaches to switching and consider which 
items you can use from your PC, you’re most likely ready to decide what 
to buy. I tell you about the different Apple models in Chapter 2. It’s time to 
take out a sheet of paper and work up a couple of configurations that meet 
your needs, compare them to your budget, and pick one. The rest of your 
computing life begins today.
Choosing options for your new Mac
All the Macs that Apple sells are complete, usable systems, but some options 
and accessories are worth considering. Apple typically stocks three or four 
configurations for each model, and you can custom-order additional options. 
The following sections walk you through the key decisions you need to make 
when you order.
Hard drive size
The hard drive is where your computer retains information that you want 
to keep. If you plan to manage your photos, movies, and music on your 
Mac or if you plan to run Windows, you want lots of hard drive space. You 
can buy an external drive (and you want one for the Apple Time Machine 
backup feature), but it’s handy to have your main files in one place. On 
some models — the Xserve, the Mac Pro, and, surprisingly, the low-end 
MacBook — adding a bigger drive is easy, but most models require a 
technician to install one.

75
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
 
Bottom line: Spend a little more for a bigger hard drive, but save some money 
in your budget for an external unit, too.
Processor speed
Apple charges a little extra for the fastest versions of the Intel processors it 
uses. Computer reviews tend to dote on 10 percent differences in speed, 
when most users hardly notice the difference. All Macs have more than one 
central processing unit (CPU) — the part of the chip that carries out program 
instructions. Most have two, but the highest-performance models have four 
or more. If you don’t know why you would need that much processing power, 
you probably don’t.
Random access memory
Random access memory (RAM) is where your computer temporarily stores 
information so that the CPU can quickly (in billionths of a second) access the 
data while it’s working on that data. Other terms used include DRAM and 
SDRAM. When your computer runs out of RAM, it writes to the much slower 
hard drive the data it hasn’t used in a while.
 
Adding memory reduces the need for these memory swaps and can typically 
improve performance more than getting a faster chip. The 1GB of RAM (one 
billion or so characters of information) that low-end Mac minis are supplied 
with is barely adequate. Other models come with 2 or 4GB. Getting at least 
4GB is usually worth the money.
Selecting other accessories
Configure your computer the way you want it when you buy it. You can buy 
other accessories with your purchase or later, when you need them.
AppleCare
A Mac typically comes with a one-year warranty and 90-day free phone 
support. You can extend the warranty and phone support by signing up for 
AppleCare. Although you can do this at any time before the warranty expires, 
extending the warranty when you buy is best; otherwise, you may forget. 
Alternatively, mark your iCal calendar about a month before the warranty 
expires. Also see ProCare at the end of this list.
 
Apple could change its terms, so verify the warranty info in this section before 
you buy — don’t take my word for it.
External floppy drive
If you have a collection of 31/2-inch floppies, your best bet is to read them 
all onto your PC’s hard drive and then back them up, either directly to 
a CD or DVD or to your Mac when you transfer the rest of your files (see 

76
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Chapter 6). But if you accumulate too many of them and don’t want to spend 
the time, get an external USB floppy drive. Your Mac should be able to read 
PC floppies using an external drive.
External hard drive
 
If you don’t already own a high-capacity external hard drive, get one — at least 
500GB worth. It’s pretty much a must-have item if you want to get decent use 
from the Apple Time Machine backup software. The external drive is also 
handy for transferring files from your PC. External hard drives offer capacities 
in the half-terabyte (500GB) range for less than $100. You can buy a terabyte 
(1,000GB) for less than $150. If your Mac supports FireWire, you should get a 
hard drive with both FireWire and USB 2.0 interfaces, giving you maximum 
flexibility. They typically cost a bit more, but that way, you can use USB 2.0 
with your PC and use the faster FireWire with your Mac.
Flash drive
If you don’t already have at least one of these tiny, inexpensive USB mass 
storage units, it’s time you got one. It’s also known as a thumb drive or 
keychain drive. A typical unit is shown in Figure 3-5, with a peanut for com-
parison. There’s nothing like knowing you have the files you need in your 
pocket. Get at least a 4GB unit.
 
Figure 3-5: 
A flash drive 
(USB plug at 
the top) and 
a peanut.
 
Microsoft Office
Microsoft Office is still the most widely accepted tool for creating text 
documents and spreadsheets. You can safely send documents back and forth 
between the Macintosh version of Office and the Windows version. If you feel 
you need Microsoft Office, for work or school, check on whether special 
deals are available with the purchase of a new Mac. Unfortunately, you 
cannot transfer your Windows license to OS X.

77
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
MobileMe
MobileMe is the Apple data storage and sharing service, offered in an annual 
subscription for $99 per year. You get an e-mail address ending in .mac.me.
com and 20GB of online storage space that shows up as another hard drive 
on your desktop and that you can use to store your Web site, photo and 
video gallery, calendar, and backup files, all subject to a terms-of-service 
agreement (no naughty stuff). Many iLife programs have features that take 
advantage of MobileMe, such as a gallery for your photos and video, if you 
have it. Apple typically offers new Mac customers a 30-day free trial, so you 
can check it out before buying.
Modem
Current Mac models don’t include a modem. If you need dialup Internet 
access at home or on the road, or if you need to send fax documents from 
your computer, get the tiny Apple USB modem, which sells for about $50.
Networking equipment
If you already have high-speed Internet access and maybe even a home 
network, your Mac plugs right in. If not, see Chapter 9, where I tell you about 
the various options:
 
✓ Wireless: If you’re buying a laptop or just don’t want wires strung all 
over your den, consider getting a Wi-Fi router. The Apple offering is the 
AirPort Extreme Base Station (AirPort Extreme is Apple’s name for the 
802.11n draft Wi-Fi standard). However, just about any 802.11g or n 
router will do.
 
✓ Ethernet (wired): If you plan to use wired networking, check to see 
whether you have an extra Ethernet port available on your router or 
cable modem. If not, you might need an Ethernet router. Getting one that 
also includes Wi-Fi doesn’t cost much more, however.
Another handy accessory is a USB hub, a small box that multiplies the 
number of USB devices you can plug in at the same time. You may already 
have one, but make sure that it supports the faster USB 2.0 standard. If not 
get a new one, preferably the type with a separate power supply, so it can 
power additional devices.
Printer deals
When you buy a new Mac, you’re typically offered a reduced price or rebate 
on a new inkjet printer. Sometimes the rebate covers the purchase price of 
the printer, so even if you already own a printer, it may be worth getting a 
new one as a spare or to give to someone else.

78
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
 
There’s no such thing as a free lunch, however. Printer manufacturers sell 
their printers cheap and force you to buy ink or toner from them at prices 
that work out to a few cents per page for a text document to a half-dollar or 
more for a color photograph — in effect, a tax on every page. New printers 
often come with “starter” cartridges that print fewer pages than a purchased 
cartridge, so you might as well buy a cartridge with that new printer and save 
yourself a trip to the store.
 
Most inkjet printers use ink that runs when wet, but some are more smear-
proof than others. Ask to have a sample page printed and apply a drop of 
water or saliva to the printing. If you need a relatively waterproof print, go 
with a laser printer.
If you have a printer you like and it’s supported by OS X, you might forgo the 
printer deal and shop for a new one when you need it.
ProCare
For about $100 per year, Apple sells the premium service plan ProCare, which 
offers a number of services that are not included in the standard warranty, 
nor in AppleCare. You buy ProCare only at an Apple retail store (not online). 
It entitles you to personal training, priority repairs, advance registration at 
the in-store Genius Bar, and a yearly preventive maintenance tune-up. (You 
find out more about the Genius Bar in the section “Visiting the Apple Store,” 
later in this chapter.)
If you also purchase your Mac at an Apple retail store and buy ProCare as 
part of the package, the folks at the Apple store can set up your Mac for 
you, including transferring files from your PC to the Mac. The PC has to be 
working and must have an Ethernet port and at least Windows 98 — and of 
course, you have to schlep it in.
How big is a gigabyte?
The international metric system prefix giga 
means 1,000,000,000 — a billion in North 
American English — so a gigabyte is a billion 
bytes, right? Well, in the computer world, it’s 
not so simple. A gigabyte (or GB) sometimes 
refers to that amount, and sometimes it‘s 
1,073,741,824 bytes. (You can make any geek’s 
day by asking him why.) The latter version is 
always used for RAM. Hard drive manufac-
turers use gigabyte to mean 1,000,000,000 
(1 billion) bytes. It’s kind of the opposite of a 
baker’s dozen — they put one less donut in the 
bag. Pretty much every manufacturer does this 
the same way, so you aren’t being cheated. 
And, you should buy at least twice as much 
hard drive space as you think you need, so none 
of this really matters.

79
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
 
Be sure to request complete setup service when you purchase your Mac; 
Apple gives you only a ten-day period in which to ask for it.
Travel accessories
If you’re planning to travel with a Mac laptop, here are some other accesso-
ries worth considering:
 
✓ Airplane power adapter: If you take long plane trips, you might want 
to get the Apple airplane power adapter. Many airlines provide laptop 
power outlets, though less often in economy seating. You can find out 
which seats on your flight have power adapters at www.seatguru.com. 
Note that the Apple adapter powers your laptop but doesn’t charge its 
batteries.
 
 If you’re traveling to other countries, the good news is that the power 
adapter that comes with Mac laptops runs on any AC power source in 
the world — 100–240 volts, 50 or 60 hertz. However, you may need to 
buy a travel adapter to plug it in. You can buy one at Radio Shack and 
many travel stores. You don’t need the transformer type.
 
✓ Three-way extension cord: Those of us who travel spend untold hours 
in airports, and most of them have only a few power outlets, usually 
located for the benefit of the cleaning crew. When you do find a pair of 
outlets, another road warrior has probably already claimed them for his 
laptop and cellphone. But most people are willing to share the outlet if 
you ask nicely and produce your three-way cord.
 
✓ Security cable: If you plan to use your Mac laptop at work or school, 
consider buying a security cable that lets you lock it up when you have 
to leave it unattended. You can find a variety of such locks at www.
kensington.com.
Look for the Mac logo
Macs work with most USB, FireWire, and net-
working devices — such as printers, scanners, 
and wireless base stations — so don’t be afraid 
to try what you already own. But if you’re buying 
new equipment, make sure that the package 
says it’s designed for Mac and OS X. If you do, 
you’re more likely to own a product that works 
with little or no fuss. And, if you run into prob-
lems and don’t find the solution in this book, 
you’re more likely to find useful help from that 
vendor’s customer service department if the 
box specifies that it supports Macs.

Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
Shopping for Your New Mac
You might be fed up with choices by now, if you’ve read the entire chapter, 
but you have one more decision to make: where to buy your Mac. Here’s the 
gist of it: You can buy online or in a traditional brick-and-mortar store, and 
you can do either one directly from Apple or from an independent retailer. 
Both have pros and cons, and the sections that follow can help you decide.
 
Wherever you go to buy your Mac and its accessories, make sure that you 
take a list of all the specs and accessories you know you need, based on the 
information you gathered earlier in this chapter. Your list should include not 
only which Mac model you want, but also how much RAM you need, what size 
hard drive you want, and which options to choose (such as whether you want 
a higher-end graphics card). By having all these notes at the ready, you’re 
much more likely to stay within your budget (if you have one) and get no more 
or no less than what you need.
Shopping at your local computer store
The nice thing about going to a computer store is that you can see the vari-
ous models before you make your final decision. You can also ask the friendly 
salesperson questions and maybe even get useful answers. Assuming what 
you want is in stock, you get to take your new toy home with you. And, if you 
have a problem, most stores have a place where you can talk to someone 
face-to-face. (Ask your salesperson to show you the service department 
before you buy.)
 
Not all computer stores carry Macs. Apple is choosy about which establish-
ments it does business with. It doesn’t want Macs stacked along the wall with 
all the Windows models in a department staffed with salespersons pushing the 
PC that happens to be on sale that week. You can find a list of authorized 
Apple resellers near you at www.apple.com/buy. Call ahead to see whether 
what you want is in stock.
Visiting the Apple Store
Frustrated with the way its computers were being sold, Apple defied conven-
tional business wisdom and built its own chain of computer stores. Designed 
with the usual Apple panache, and propelled by the success of the iPod, this 
venture has made its customers and stockholders very happy. If you choose 
to buy your Mac at the Apple Store, you find that the stores are well stocked 
with most Apple models and attractively displayed — although you probably 
won’t see an Xserve, and the inexpensive minis are usually tucked away 
in a corner. The stores carry lots of accessories, both from Apple and third 

81
 Chapter 3: Deciding What to Buy
parties — printers, external hard drives, carrying cases, software, games, 
and, of course, iPods, iPhones, Apple TVs, and the growing list of Apple 
consumer electronics.
The coolest thing about the Apple Store is its Genius Bar, a section staffed 
with people who know their Macs and can answer your questions. After you 
buy your Mac, the Genius Bar can take your hardware for repair, if necessary. 
If the store is busy, and it usually is, you have to sign in and wait a bit. Most 
stores give you a pager so that you can shop elsewhere or visit the food 
court if the Apple Store is in a mall, as many are. You can visit the Genius Bar 
and bring in your Mac to the Apple Store for service regardless of where you 
purchased it originally. You have to pay for service, of course, if your Mac is 
no longer under warranty or isn’t covered by AppleCare.
Apple claims that a large chunk of the population of North America is within 
a 45-minute drive of an Apple Store. And, you find Apple Stores in many other 
parts of the world. You can find the ones near you by looking at www.apple.
com/buy.
Buying your Mac online
Assuming that you already have an Internet connection, buying online can 
be very convenient. Pick out the model you want and enter your shipping 
address and credit card number, and in a day or so, depending on how 
cheap you were about shipping, your computer arrives. If you don’t have an 
Internet connection or your PC is so riddled with viruses that you don’t trust 
it with your credit card, most online stores also have toll-free phone numbers 
and even printed catalogs you can request.
Surfing to the Apple online store
You can buy all the products Apple makes from its electronic Apple Store at 
www.apple.com (or by calling 1-800-MY-APPLE). You can even watch the 
latest Apple TV ads.
 
The online Apple Store is your best bet if you want to buy a build-to-order 
configuration. Select the Buy Now option on the model you want, and you’re 
presented with all possible options for that model. Of course, you aren’t 
committed to buy anything until you enter your credit card information and 
confirm your order.
Other online retailers
A number of other online stores sell Macs, including Amazon.com, 
MacConnection.com, and MacZone.com. Again, you can find a full list at 
www.apple.com/buy. These stores sometimes offer discounts or deals 
on extra memory. They may stock only the more popular configurations, 
however.

82
Part I: Informed Switching Starts Here 
 
If you live in the United States, you may be able to avoid paying sales tax 
by purchasing from one of the independent online stores. The independent 
store has to collect sales tax only if it has a business presence in the state 
where you live. (Apple has such presence in most states, so it has to collect 
sales tax.)
Apple and netbooks
Netbooks are small, inexpensive laptops that 
have become quite popular. But they make a 
number of trade-offs to keep prices low, includ-
ing having a small screen, slow processor, 
shrunken keyboard, limited battery life, and no 
ability to read, much less write, CDs and DVDs. 
Some models even use the Linux operating 
system, avoiding the added expense of a 
Windows license. At the time this book was 
written, Apple didn’t offer a netbook. Apple CEO 
Tim Cook has said that Apple doesn’t want to 
compete in this market unless it has something 
other than a low-quality, cheap product to offer 
and that the iPhone and iPod Touch offer many 
of the capabilities of netbooks in an even 
smaller package. Many in the industry believe 
that Apple is developing an innovative product 
to compete with netbooks, perhaps a media 
tablet that can connect to the Internet by way of 
the cellular telephone network and Wi-Fi — 
something like an large iPhone. Check my Web 
site, ditchmypc.com, for the latest informa-
tion on these developments and how they affect 
your Mac-buying decision.

in order to get started.

In This Chapter

C
ongratulations! You’ve done it. You bought a Mac. A new world is 
about to unfold. Apple does an excellent job of making the task of 
setting up a new Mac simple and painless, and it usually is. But computers 
are by far the most complex consumer product ever sold, and things can 
go wrong. Also, some simple preparations can make the setup process 
smoother and much less stressful. So resist the temptation to start hooking 
things up, and read on.
Unpacking and Setting Up
You are now ready to unpack your new Mac. (If you did this as soon as you 
got it home, please just gather all the pieces in one place and pretend that 
you didn’t.) I hope you notice the attractive presentation. Apple has elevated 
packaging to an art form, with everything snugly in its place. I also hope 
you notice the tiny manuals that come with the Mac. They explain the 
basics but leave plenty of demand for aftermarket books such as this one. 
Thanks, Apple.
Getting organized
The first thing to do is to make room for the new machine and clear away the 
clutter on your desk or work table so that you can keep track of everything. 
Next, find a shoebox or plastic storage container so that you have a place to 
store the discs, manuals, and other bits of stuff that come with the Mac. A 
friend of mine services computers in his apartment complex and is forever 

86
Part II: Making the Switch 
telling people to put the discs and papers in a safe place when he sets up 
a new computer. When he has to go back some time later, his clients can 
never find the stuff. So think of a place you’ll remember and write down the 
location here, in the margin of this book.
Hooking up your computer
It’s time to put your computer together. Looking through the manual that 
comes with your Mac for the latest info is always a good idea, but the 
following sections provide a quick guide on what to do, depending on your 
computer model.
iMac
The iMac is an easy setup. Apple once ran an ad showing a 7-year-old 
putting together an earlier model. If anything, the task has become easier. 
I don’t recommend letting a 7-year-old lift an iMac out of its box, however, 
particularly if you buy one of the bigger screens. The largest weighs almost 
25 pounds (11 kg), and you really don’t want anyone to drop it. Don’t be 
ashamed to ask another adult for help. Here’s what you need to do:
 
1. Plug the keyboard into one the USB ports located on the back.
 
 Your iMac comes standard with a wired keyboard and mouse.
 
2. Plug the mouse into one of the wired USB ports on either side of the 
keyboard.
 
3. Plug the power cord into the power socket on the back of the iMac 
and plug its other end into an AC wall outlet or power strip.
 
4. If your power strip has a switch, make sure that it’s set to On.
 
 You’re done.
Wireless mice and keyboards
If you purchased a Bluetooth wireless mouse or keyboard, you have to install 
the batteries and introduce the keyboard and mouse to the computer. No, I’m 
not making a joke here; the process is called pairing.
The details are in the little booklets that come with the wireless devices, so 
hang on to them or visit www.apple.com/support/bluetooth. To get 
started, you need a wired USB mouse to run the Bluetooth Setup Assistant 
utility — your PC’s USB mouse will work fine.

87
 Chapter 4: The Big Day: Setting Up Your Mac
 
Always check and double-check which way the batteries are inserted in any 
electronic device. Look for the + and – marks inside the case, and don’t 
assume that you know. Inserting batteries improperly is the most common 
cause of small electronics not working.
MacBook, Macbook Air, and MacBook Pro
Apple laptops require little setup:
 
1. Plug the power adapter into an AC outlet or power strip.
 
 At the other end of the power adapter, you find the MagSafe power 
connector.
 
2. Remove the power connector’s little plastic protective cover and then 
just hold it horizontally and bring it near the power receptacle, 
located on the left side of your laptop, near the display hinge.
 
 When it’s close, the connector snaps into the laptop as though it were 
magnetic — because it is. It doesn’t matter which side of the MagSafe 
connector is up; it works properly either way. The MagSafe connector 
has a tiny light, and when you first apply power to your new laptop, the 
light should be green and then promptly switch to orange, indicating 
that it’s charging the batteries. When the battery is fully charged, the 
light turns green again.
 
 A good friend of mine trashed a nice Apple PowerBook, the predecessor 
of the MacBook Pro, by tripping over the power cord and sending her 
laptop crashing to the floor. It never booted up again. The MagSafe 
connector is designed to prevent such tragedies by popping out if you 
tug on it, without imparting a big enough jerk to pull the laptop off a 
work surface. Still, pulling on the cord isn’t the best way to unplug the 
MagSafe connector from your machine. Apple recommends that you 
grasp the connector itself and pull, but that sucker sticks on tight. The 
easy way to remove it is to gently lift it from the bottom — it tilts up 
pretty easily — and then pull it out.
 
3. While you’re waiting for me to tell you to press the On button, take a 
moment to examine the power adapter.
 
 After you take off all the clear plastic wrapping, you see two little tabs 
on either side of the power cord that swing out to form a cradle on 
which you can wind up the power cord. Also, at least in North America, 
two power blades swing out and plug directly into a power outlet. 
They’re mounted in a small module that Apple calls a duck’s head, which 
you can pull free and replace with the longer power cord that comes 
with the Mac (see Figure 4-1). The U.S. power cord has a grounding plug, 
so if you’re working in a place with older wiring, the duck’s head may be 
more convenient because it fits into just about any outlet.
 
4. Okay, press On now.

Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Xserve
The top and bottom of the Mac line are both a little more complicated to set 
up because neither has a built-in display; you have to supply your own and 
hook it up to the computer. That brings up the ugly question of adapters:
 
✓ The ultra-light Mac mini has both a Mini DisplayPort and a mini-DVI port 
video output connector and comes with a mini-DVI-to-DVI adapter. Apple 
sells a DVI-to-VGA adapter, along with Mini DisplayPort adapters.
 
✓ The Mac Pro is heavy — 42 pounds (19 kg) — but it has conveniently 
placed carrying handles on top that make it easier to lug. The standard 
Mac Pro has a Mini DisplayPort and a dual-link DVI port. It comes with 
no adapters.
 
✓ The Xserve is designed to fit into a standard 19-inch electronics rack. It 
weighs as much as 38 pounds (17 kg), depending on options, and comes 
with the necessary mounting hardware. Consider getting a technician to 
help you install it, though. Xserve comes with a VGA adapter.
Selecting the right adapters can be confusing — you may even need more 
than one.

89
 Chapter 4: The Big Day: Setting Up Your Mac
 
✓ If you’re hooking up to your PC’s monitor: You probably want a VGA 
adapter, but first check your display’s service manual to see whether 
your monitor has DVI input. It’s better to use the latter, if it’s available.
 
✓ If you’re hooking up to a high-definition TV (HDTV): You probably 
need a DVI-to-HDMI cable. The online Apple Store sells one, but you 
might use Google to search for a less pricey model. A better option 
might be the Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter sold by monoprice.com. 
In either case you will also need an 35 mm stereo to RCA stereo audio 
cable if you want sound through your TV. Monoprice sells these as well.
 
 DVI, HDMI, and VGA cover most displays on the market, but you may 
have something different. And older TVs with analog input only are not 
supported by the latest Apple computers.
 
✓ If you plan to use two displays: You need two adapters — of different 
types. For the Mac mini, you need one adapter that plugs into the Mini 
DisplayPort and one that plugs into the MiniDVI port.
Network
If your PC is connected to the Internet using a Wi-Fi wireless network, you’re 
all set. If you have a wired Ethernet network at home, plug your Mac into it. 
You likely have such a network but don’t know it. If you have high-speed 
Internet (via cable TV, DSL, or satellite) and your PC is connected by a wire 
with a plug that looks like a telephone plug but is fatter, that’s what you have. 
You need an Ethernet router or switch to share this connection. If you don’t 
have one, don’t worry. You can unplug the connection from your PC and plug 
it into your Mac for now and pick up a router the next time you’re near a 
computer store, or you can order one online. See Chapter 9 for more on net-
working your Mac.
KVM
 
A KVM box lets you share a keyboard, video monitor, mouse, and speakers 
between your Mac and your PC, as shown in Figure 4-2. You don’t need one, 
but they’re handy if you plan to continue using your PC. Hooking up the box 
involves a lot of wires, but the idea is simple enough. With luck, you got a USB 
KVM. It should say so on the package. If it doesn’t, or if it says PS/2, return it 
and get a USB unit.
The following steps walk you through the setup process:
 
1. Plug your monitor, keyboard, mouse, and speakers into the KVM box.
 
 Normally, the monitor and speakers have only one possible connection 
apiece. You should find two USB jacks, one for the keyboard and one for 
the mouse, but it shouldn’t matter which goes where.
 
 You also have two sets of cables — more if you bought a multiport KVM.

4. Plug the speaker cables into the speaker outputs of each computer, 
and plug the USB plug (you should see only one per cable) into an 
available USB socket on the computer.
 
 Finally, you have a VGA video plug to contend with.
 
5. The VGA plug on the PC cable should find a matching jack on the PC. 
For the Mac cable, you need a MiniDisplayPort-to-VGA adapter or a 
mini-DVI–to–VGA adapter (Apple sell both).
After you have everything set up, switching between the Mac and PC should 
be easy. Check the manual that came with your KVM box for the details on 
which method it uses to control the switching.
Configuring Your New Mac
You’re almost ready to turn on your Mac. Before you do, I recommend 
that you gather some information so that you have it ready during the 
initial setup.
Turning your Mac on and off
The power switch on most Macs is a round, 
white, or silver button marked with the discus 
interruptus, a circle broken at the top with a 
short, vertical line. This is actually the interna-
tional symbol for a soft power switch, one that 
tells the equipment to go on or off but doesn’t 
control the power directly.
As with a Windows computer, you should 
always tell your Mac to turn itself off whenever 
possible, lest you lose data or damage the 
operating system. The Shut Down command is 
on the Apple menu (the one headed by the 
Apple logo: Ú). After you choose Shut Down, 
you’re asked whether you really want to shut 
down your computer. If you choose Restart, you 
see a similar message.
OS X is quite a stable operating system, but if it 
doesn’t seem to do anything after you tell it to 
shut down, you can try a couple of things. First, 
be patient; some programs, particularly the 
Apple Safari Web browser, can take a while to 
close. Also, look at your screen to see whether 
an application is asking whether you want to 
save a file, for example.
If all else fails, you have two last-resort options: 
You can hold down the power button for about 
six seconds, and if that doesn’t work after a 
couple of tries, remove the power cord or, on a 
laptop, remove the battery as well. Restore 
power and press the power button, and you 
should be back in business.

92
Part II: Making the Switch 
Collecting information you need
After you get your Mac plugged in and turned on, your Mac starts asking 
you a bunch of questions. Things go more smoothly if you collect the 
answers ahead of time, so the following sections discuss the information 
you need. With a few exceptions, you can change the information later, but 
you might as well get it right the first time, if you can. Make notes of your 
choices in the margin of this book (assuming that you’re not still browsing in 
the bookstore).
Name
This information seems straightforward enough. But give some thought to 
how you want your name presented: Mary Smith, Mary Ann Smith, M. Smith, 
or M. A. Smith. If you’re setting up the computer for a youngster, you might 
not want to include his last name, but don’t use a too-cute nickname that the 
child will outgrow in a couple of years.
 
If the family is sharing the computer, remember that you can easily set up 
individual accounts for each member. The first account should be the person 
who will be in charge (the administrator) of the computer, though this can be 
changed later and you can have more than one administrator.
Short name
This entry is the name of your home directory, and it can’t be easily changed. 
Your Mac proposes the full name you gave, in all lowercase letters and with 
no spaces. I suggest you pick something shorter, such as msmith or mas.
Password
 
 This is the password you use to log on to your Mac. You’re asked for it at 
other times, too, such as when you install new software or change security 
settings. You can use the password you’ve used for everything else in 
your life, but I suggest you pick something stronger. The security of your 
computer begins with a well-chosen password. When you see the screen 
that asks for the password, look for a little key icon next to the password 
entry box. Click it, and OS X suggests a password. Pick one of its suggestions, 
write down the password, and keep it in a safe place. I explain why and 
give some tips on other easy ways to make up a password and not forget it 
in Chapter 10.
Wi-Fi network name and password
If you already have a Wi-Fi network, your Mac will probably pick up yours, 
along with a couple of others if you live in a built-up area. It helps to know 
your network’s name. If you have WEP or WPA security enabled, you need 
your Wi-Fi password, passphrase, or key. If you have long forgotten them, 
see Chapter 9 for information on how to reset your access point and set up 
new security.

93
 Chapter 4: The Big Day: Setting Up Your Mac
If you’re setting up a new Wi-Fi network, look over Chapter 9 to decide 
whether you need to enable security. If so, see Chapter 10 for how to 
generate a strong passphrase to protect your network. Might as well have 
the passphrase ready before you begin.
Apple ID
If you purchased music or other items from iTunes, you already have an 
Apple ID and password that lets you sign in to the iTunes Store to make your 
purchases. Take a moment to look them up.
Internet account information
Have the following information handy:
 
✓ The name of your Internet service provider
 
✓ Service type: cable, DSL, satellite, dialup, or other
 
✓ Account name
 
✓ Password
 
✓ The ISP’s customer service number
 
✓ The phone number your computer dials (if you have dialup)
E-mail service information
If you check your mail online using your browser — say, if you have an 
account with Yahoo! or Gmail — you needn’t do anything. Otherwise, check 
the Web site of your e-mail service to see whether it has any special instruc-
tions for Mac users. Keep handy the following info for every e-mail service 
you plan to use:
 
✓ Provider name
 
✓ Customer service number
 
✓ E-mail address
 
✓ E-mail password
 
✓ Type of account: POP (the most common), IMAP, or .Mac
 
✓ Mail server address
 
✓ SMTP server address
Getting through the Startup Wizard
Finally, it’s time to press that power button. As your Mac powers on, you 
hear a soft “boing” that has long been part of the new Mac experience. Next, 
follow these steps:

94
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
1. When the Select Main Language screen appears, choose the language 
you prefer.
 
 You see the message Starting Mac OS and then a “welcome” video. 
You’re then asked to select the country or region you’re in. If you chose 
English as your main language, the Mac presents English-speaking coun-
tries. (If you’re somewhere else, select the Show All check box to view 
the complete list, including Heard & McDonald Island and the Holy See.)
 
 Either way, make your choice and click the Continue button.
 
2. Select the country or region you’re in.
 
 You see the choices: US, Canada, UK, AZ, NZ, IRE. You can ask for more 
choices.
 
3. Answer the question: “Do you already own a Mac?”
 
 You’re asked this question because you can transfer information from 
another Mac if you already have one. If not, click the Do Not Transfer My 
Information button and then click the Continue button.
 
4. Select your keyboard layout.
 
 Select U.S. or Canada (you can add other keyboard versions later), and 
then click the Continue button.
 
5. Select a wireless service.
 
 Things start to get exciting now. If you have Wi-Fi at your location and 
you aren’t using exotic security tricks to make your network invisible, 
your Wi-Fi base station should show up on the screen, along with any 
others your Mac has found.
 
 If you have security enabled, you need to know the WEP or WPA pass-
word or key to connect. If all goes well, at this point you’re now online. If 
you’re not, don’t worry; just move on for now. I go over networking your 
Mac in more detail in Chapter 9.
 
6. Enter your Apple ID and its password if you have an iTunes (or a 
MobileMe) account. Click the Continue button.
 
 You can skip this step and enter this info later using iTunes or the 
MobileMe pane in System Preferences.
 
7. Supply the requested registration information, and then click the 
Continue button.
 
8. Continue with some optional questions from the assistant. (You can 
decide whether Apple is being too nosy.)
 
 The questions include where you will use the computer and what “best 
describes what you do.”

95
 Chapter 4: The Big Day: Setting Up Your Mac
 
 Deselect the Stay in Touch check box if you don’t want e-mail announce-
ments. Then click the Continue button.
 
9. In the Set Up This Account screen of the assistant, verify the account 
name and enter your password.
 
 Make sure that the account name is the one you want. This is one thing 
you can’t easily change later; you have to rebuild the whole computer. 
Enter the password you prepared (twice). If you didn’t have a password 
ready, click the key icon next to the password entry field, and Password 
Assistant suggests some passwords. Pick one and write it down on a slip 
of paper that you will keep in a safe place. (See Chapter 10 for more on 
how Password Assistant works.) Finally, click the Continue button.
 
10. Select a picture, if you want, for this account.
 
 If you have a Mac with a built-in camera (the iMac, MacBook, MacBook 
Air, and MacBook Pro all have one), the Startup Wizard now offers to 
take your picture to use as an icon for this account. You can retake 
the photo if you don’t like the results, and you can change it later by 
choosing System Preferences➪Accounts. Alternatively, you can choose 
from a picture library.
 
11. Select a time zone, click the Continue button, and then set your date 
and time, if necessary.
 
 Macs are supplied already set to Pacific standard time (PST) and 
Cupertino-USA, Apple’s hometown. Click the map or select the closest 
city from the list. After your time zone is set, the date and time dis-
played are likely to be close to correct. If you’re connected to the 
Internet, your Mac sets itself by using a time server traceable to the 
U.S. government’s atomic clock.
Are we there yet?
If all went according to plan, you should see an OS X desktop waiting for 
you to work or play with. And, if you have a modern Internet hookup, you 
should be online as well. I give you an introduction to OS X in the next 
chapter. Later chapters tell you more about getting online, setting up e-mail, 
moving files over, increasing your computer’s security level, and solving 
any problems you may encounter. You also find out more about the various 
neat things you can do with your Mac. Chapter 22 suggests some creative 
(and some mundane) things you can do with your old PC.
Dive on in!

Maintaining parental control
As I said in Chapter 3, I’m not a big fan of com-
puters for small children. But even teenagers 
need limits on computer use — games and net-
working sites are highly addictive. Be sure to 
read Chapter 17, which tells you how to use OS X 
parental controls, before you hand over a com-
puter account to your child. It’s very hard to 
introduce those controls later, when you realize 
that she’s spending way too much time in front 
of the screen.

Chapter 5
Mac OS X for Windows Users
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing the similarities between Windows and Mac OS X
▶ Getting used to the differences
▶ Exploring menus and shortcuts
▶ Using the all-important Finder
▶ Discovering other cool OS X features
A
s a PC user, you’re already familiar with the operating system known 
as Windows. It is a complex piece of software developed by Microsoft, 
and some version of it comes with most personal computers now sold, 
with one big exception: Apple doesn’t sell its Macs with Windows software. 
Instead, Apple equips its Macintosh computers with Apple’s own operating 
system, Mac OS X. Apple pronounces it “oh ess ten,” as in the Roman 
numeral ten. (The previous Apple operating system was OS 9.) Apple 
computers are stylish and well made, but OS X is the main reason to buy 
a Mac. (You can have Windows on your Mac in addition to OS X, but you 
have to buy it and install it yourself, as I explain in Chapter 16.)
Apple and Microsoft are locked in a battle over which company can produce 
an operating system that offers a better experience for the user. Both 
companies are forced to keep improving their offerings. Most Mac users 
believe that Apple keeps coming out ahead.
PC and Mac: We Have a Lot in Common
Microsoft adopted many Mac OS features when it created Windows, so you 
find much that’s familiar when you try OS X. The fundamental idea is much 
the same: The operating system
 
✓ Stores data as files that have names
 
✓ Organizes files in a hierarchy of folders
 
✓ Runs applications

98
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
✓ Talks to external devices such as printers, scanners, music players, and 
cameras
 
✓ Connects to other computers by way of local-area networks and the 
Internet
You interact with the computer by using a graphical user interface (GUI), 
which presents a simulated desktop on the screen, with icons you can move 
around and click. Information appears in rectangular windows, and you can 
select from pull-down menus. You use a pointing device, such as a mouse or 
trackpad, to move a cursor around the screen. The cursor is normally an 
arrow, but it sometimes changes its shape to reflect what’s going on.
Over the years, the computer industry has adopted numerous standards to 
ensure that different products can work well together. Nowadays, Apple 
is at the forefront of this process, adopting most standards and frequently 
contributing some new ones that other companies adopt. Here’s a quick 
rundown of the alphabet soup of standards that Mac OS X shares with 
Windows and other operating systems:
 
✓ Data formats: ASCII, H.294, JPEG, MP3, MPEG, PDF, TIFF, Unicode, and 
UTF-8
 
✓ File systems: Apple HFS+, ISO 9660 CDs, Microsoft FAT, Microsoft NTFS 
(read-only), NFS, UDF 1.5 DVDs, ZFS, and 31/2-inch HD floppy (with 
external drive)
 
✓ Input/output: Bluetooth, FireWire/IEEE-1394, PCIe (Pro and Xserve), 
TOSlink audio, USB
 
✓ Networking: Bonjour, Ethernet, HTTP, LDAP, POP mail, RSS, S/MIME, 
TCP/IP, and Wi-Fi
 
✓ Security: AES, HTTPS, RADIUS, SSH, SSL/TLS, WEP, WPA, and WPA2
 
✓ Software standards: BootP, BSD, CalDAV calendering, DHCP, EFI, Java, 
JavaScript, LP64 64-bit, Microsoft Exchange, OpenGL graphics, POSIX, 
PPPoE, Ruby on Rails, SOAP, UNIX 03, X11, and x86
This list isn’t complete, and I don’t expect you to know what all these geeky 
acronyms mean. I explain the more important ones in Chapter 3 and other 
ones as I go, and you can check the glossary for the rest. But I’m about to dive 
into all the differences, and I want to emphasize how much overlap exists 
between the two operating systems. After you get used to a few new concepts 
and some different terminology, you’ll feel right at home using OS X.
Adjusting to the Differences
You do, of course, encounter differences between Windows and Mac OS X. 
Some are merely a matter of terminology. Others just take getting used to, 

99
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
and a few you might find annoying. For most of those annoying issues, I 
point out, in a reasonably familiar way, ways to accomplish what you want 
to do.
Comparing Windows- and Mac-speak
Computers seem to run on jargon. Many of the buzzwords used on Macs are 
exactly the same as those used in Windows: files, users, log on, log out, open, 
close, shut down, help, and most networking and Internet terms. Terms used 
to describe the graphical interface are mostly the same, too: menu, check 
box, dialog or dialog box, radio button, drag, click, and double-click. Table 5-1 
provides the equivalent terms or types of programs for each platform.

Part II: Making the Switch 
Some things, thankfully, have no equivalent in the Mac world. No activation is 
required in order to use OS X; you can skip registration, if you like. You find 
no Windows Genuine Advantage checking and deciding (sometimes inaccu-
rately) whether your copy of Mac OS X is authentic, and no animated paper 
clip offering inane help (unless you’re using Microsoft Office). And you don’t 
run into DLL files or any equivalent of the Windows Registry, both notorious 
sources of problems.
Seeing the big picture: The desktop 
and menus
After you answer all the startup assistant’s questions, you see the Mac 
desktop, shown in Figure 5-1.
The basic idea is the same as on the Windows desktop: Most of the screen is 
filled with a pattern or an image that resembles a tablecloth on which you 
see various icons that represent files, storage media, and applications. You 
also find an arrow cursor that you can move around by using the mouse or 
trackpad. You can move icons around by placing the arrow cursor over them, 
clicking the mouse or trackpad button, and holding down the button as you 
move the cursor.
 
Figure 5-1: 
The 
Macintosh 
OS X desk-
top screen.
 

101
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
The big differences between the Mac and PC desktops are at the top and 
bottom. On the top, you find all OS X menus. Each application has a different 
menu set. The menu set shown is for the application whose window is in 
front — that application is said to have focus or to be the current application:
 
✓ The first menu on the left is always headed by an Apple logo (Ú) and is 
called the Apple menu, naturally. It has system-related stuff, such as 
System Preferences and Shut down.
 
✓ The next menu over is headed by the name of the current application 
(Finder; refer to Figure 5-1). That menu is where you find entries that 
change preferences and quit (exit) the application.
 
✓ Continuing from the left, you typically see File and Edit menus that work 
much like the corresponding Windows menus. The Help menu is always 
on the right.
At the bottom of the screen, you see a bunch of largish icons (you can make 
them smaller or hide them, as explained later in this chapter). This area, 
the Dock, roughly corresponds to the Windows taskbar and tray. Here’s what 
you see:
 
✓ Each icon on the Dock represents an application or a folder; you click an 
icon once to start or open it. Click a folder or stack on the Dock and its 
contents spring out in a graceful arc (refer to Figure 5-1), or as a grid, if 
there are too many items.
 
✓ If you don’t know what an icon represents, move your cursor over it and 
a label appears.
 
✓ Open applications have a little black triangle underneath their corre-
sponding icons on the Dock.
 
✓ You add applications and folders to the Dock by dragging them there.
I say more about menus and the Dock in the following sections.
Pointing the way: The mouse and trackpad
One of the great divides between Apple and Microsoft was over whether 
computer mice should have one or two buttons. You may think it bizarre that 
adults would fret about such a thing, but the debate invoked great passions. 
Apple touted the simplicity of having a single button, avoiding the need to 
explain what each button does. Microsoft eventually found a good use for the 
second button — the one on the right. It displays menus of possible actions 
appropriate to the window in which the right-click occurred. Later, scroll 
wheels appeared, allowing users to move up and down in a window using 
intuitive finger action. Apple added similar functions to its operating system 
and eventually introduced its own multibutton mouse, which it named 
Mighty Mouse.

102
Part II: Making the Switch 
Mighty Mouse comes with the iMac and Mac Pro. You can order a wireless 
Bluetooth version as an option. At first glance, this mouse looks like a 
single-button mouse with a tiny ball toward the front. Here are a few pointers 
on using the Mighty Mouse:
 
✓ The ball acts like a scroll wheel, but it can command horizontal as well 
as vertical scrolling.
 
✓ The top of the Mighty Mouse is a single shell. To perform a right-click, 
you press only on the right half of the shell. Regular (left-) clicks, the 
most common action, can be on the left or both sides simultaneously.
 
✓ The scroll ball can also be pressed down to signal a third type of click.
 
 Each side of the Mighty Mouse has a button you squeeze to represent a 
fourth click.
 
✓ To activate these extra buttons, select Ú➪System Preferences➪Mouse. 
You see many choices for each button. I set the top button to 
Application Switcher and the side buttons to Exposé – Desktop.
So Apple has gone from one button to four, but in a way that still looks 
like one.
 
If your Mac came with a Mighty Mouse, by all means give it a try — I think 
it’s slick. But if yours didn’t or if you find the Mighty Mouse too confusing, I 
suggest that you stick with a standard, two-button, USB, scroll-wheel mouse. If 
you already have one you like, great. If not, go buy one. Wired (as opposed to 
wireless) optical mice are inexpensive, and almost any will do fine. Just plug it 
in to a free USB port or your USB hub. You don’t even have to turn off the 
computer. Apple keyboards have extra built-in USB ports (one on the left and 
one on the right) for the mouse. No setup is necessary. Apple software uses 
the left button for primary clicks, the scroll wheel to scroll up and down, and 
the right button to bring up context-sensitive menus, just as Windows does. If 
you’re a left-handed user, you may want to switch the buttons by using the 
Keyboard & Mouse pane in System Preferences.
Apple laptops also feature a single button. PC laptops generally have two 
buttons. You can signal a right-click on a Mac laptop by holding down the 
Control key and clicking the trackpad button. Another way is available, 
however. The Apple trackpad is clever enough to notice when you have two 
fingers resting on it rather than just one. Check out these trackpad tricks:
 
✓ To scroll, move two fingers up and down on the trackpad.
 
✓ To right-click, rest two fingers on the trackpad when you click.
For the trackpad tricks to work, you need to adjust your settings. To do so, 
choose System Preferences from the Apple menu (in the upper-left corner 
of your screen) and then choose Keyboard & Mouse. Select the Place Two

Fingers on Trackpad and Click Button for Secondary Click check box and 
then close the window. Note that Apple can’t even say the words right-click, 
but that’s what I call it whenever I want you to make it happen. Of course, 
you can use your two-button USB mouse with your laptop, too. Just plug it in.
Gesturing with Multi-Touch
Apple has taken the two-finger trackpad gesture idea a step further. Apple 
laptops, except for the white plastic MacBook, which recognizes only two 
fingers, feature a large, glass trackpad that can tell whether one, two, three, 
or four fingers are touching it. The entire trackpad surface also functions as 
the click button. Here are some gestures you can express with your fingers:
 
✓ Two fingers:
 
 Swipe to scroll up, down, left, or right.
 
 Rotate pictures by twisting your thumb and forefinger.
 
 Pinch or spread two fingers to zoom out or in.
 
✓ Three fingers:
 
 Swipe left or right to change pages, if you have more than one page 
open in the Safari Web browser.
 
✓ Four fingers:
 
 Swipe up to move all windows off the desktop; swipe down to bring 
them back.
 
 Swipe down to show all windows; swipe up to restore their 
previous positions.
 
 Swipe left or right to see all active applications.
You can use keyboard shortcuts for many of these features.
The key to keyboards
Apple keyboard layouts look much like standard Windows keyboard layouts. 
The biggest difference is in the two keys on either side of the spacebar. On a 
PC, the keys closest to the spacebar are labeled Alt; the next ones over sport 
a Windows logo. On a Mac, the keys closest to the spacebar have an icon (Ô) 
that looks like a four-bladed propeller or electric fan. The Mac world calls 
them the Command keys; they have the same function.

104
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
The Command key (Ô) is used in almost all keyboard shortcuts. It’s one of the 
most important things to know about the Mac.
The next one over is the Option key (%). It’s often used as a modifier along 
with the command key.
Another key that may not be familiar to PC users is in the upper-right area 
on Apple keyboards. It’s the eject button ()) for the optical drive (the drive 
that reads and writes CDs and DVDs). You see the same symbol on the eject 
button on home audio devices. To the left of the ) key, you find two keys 
that raise and lower the volume and a key with only a speaker symbol; this 
key turns the system sound on and off. It’s a mute button, in effect. Next to 
the Escape key (esc) on the far left, you find brightness controls and two 
keys with funny symbols, one a box of boxes that shows all windows that are 
open and the other looking like a fuel gauge brings up the Dashboard, which I 
describe later in this chapter. The sound-control, screen-brightness, and 
other controls are also the function keys. To make these keys to work as 
function keys, you hold down the Fn key while pressing the function key you 
want. Older Apple keyboards may have different arrangements.
Backspace versus Del versus Delete
 
 Fasten your seat belts for this one. The large key on the right end of the 
numeral row on PC keyboards is labeled Backspace. Of course, it doesn’t 
really back space; the left-arrow key does that. Instead, the Backspace key 
deletes the character to the left of the insertion point, which is the blinking 
vertical line that tells you where in a block of text you’re editing. Long ago, 
Apple decided to label this key Delete because that’s truly what it does. The 
problem is that PC keyboards have another, regular-size delete key in the 
group above, or sometimes next to, the arrow keys. This delete key deletes 
the character to the right of the insertion point. Apple laptops and standard 
keyboards omit this key. The optional Apple keyboard with numeric pad 
includes the second delete key, also labeled Delete. It has on it a standard 
delete symbol that looks like a boxy arrow pointing to the right with an x in 
it. The big delete key doesn’t have a symbol on it, though one exists, and it 
has the same boxy arrow pointing to the left. On keyboards that don’t have a 
second delete key, you request the right delete function by holding down the 
function key (Fn) when you press the lone Delete key.
Keyboard shortcuts using the Command key versus the Ctrl key
Keyboard shortcuts are little incantations combining a couple of key presses 
that carry out a task without your having to plow through the menus. PCs 
have two kinds of keyboard shortcuts. For some, you hold down the Ctrl key 
and a letter key; for others, you press the Alt key and type one letter from 
each menu item name — often, but not always, the first letter. Mac keyboard 

105
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
shortcuts are similar to the first type, but you use the Command key (Ô) 
rather than the Ctrl key. The following examples show some Mac keyboard 
shortcuts:

Replacing the Ctrl key press with the Command key (Ô) also applies to most 
Ctrl-key shortcuts in programs such as Microsoft Office.
 
The letters in keyboard shortcut combinations are always shown capitalized 
in this book and onscreen, but don’t hold down the shift key unless it’s 
explicitly called for. Thus, Ô+Q means to quit the current application and 
Ô+shift+Q is the Log Out shortcut.
Although the Mac OS X menu layout appears to be intuitive and easy to 
follow, it’s fair to say that Apple gets a little carried away with shortcuts. It 
has dozens of them. Don’t try to remember them all. The most important 
shortcuts are the ones already mentioned, many of which you probably 
already know from Windows. Pick up others as you need them, and take 
advantage of the Cheat Sheet in the front of this book.
OS X displays the available shortcut for each menu item directly on the 
pull-down menu itself. Some combinations use different and even multiple 
modifier keys. Apple uses other symbols in addition to the Ô symbol 
and Ú symbol to indicate these keys. Here’s a quick guide (also see the 
Cheat Sheet):
 
✓ Option (%): This key often modifies a shortcut or menu item by telling 
it to do more. For example, pressing Ô+W closes the front window. 
%+Ô+W closes all windows for the front application. Shortcuts can be 
complex: The shortcut in TextEdit for Edit➪Paste and Match Style is 
%+Shift+Ô+V.
 
✓ Control (#): This key’s symbol looks like a hat. You press the key in 
combination with a mouse click to create a right-click.

106
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
✓ Shift ($): Either the right or left Shift key can be used. Pressing the 
Caps Lock key has no effect on shortcuts that include a Shift key.
 
✓ Escape ((): This key’s symbol looks a lot like the power button icon, but 
it’s different. The line is at an angle and has a little arrow pointing out. 
Escape is a shortcut for Cancel in dialogs.
Many other Mac keyboard shortcuts exist. Open the Apple menu and choose 
System Preferences➪Keyboard & Mouse and then choose Keyboard 
Shortcuts to see a list. The Keyboard & Mouse pane has many other options 
for customizing your input experience. Explore, but don’t get carried away.
 
If you have difficulty holding down combinations of keys, you can activate the 
Sticky Keys feature in the System Preferences➪Universal Access pane. See 
Chapter 17 for other accessibility tips if you have difficulty using computers.
Special characters and other languages
Macs let you enter text in a wide variety of languages. Select Ú➪System 
Preferences➪International➪Input and select the check box labeled Show 
Input Menu in Menu Bar. While you’re there, check the boxes for Character 
Palette, Keyboard viewer and any other input methods shown that interest 
you. On the menu bar, in the upper-right corner, you should see a little 
national flag, corresponding to the language of the keyboard you selected 
during the startup process. For example, the Stars and Stripes appears 
for the U.S. keyboard. If you click this flag, a menu of options appears. Select 
Show Character Palette. You can browse through all available characters 
in OS X — thousands of them exist. Click the small triangles next to the 
Character Info and Font Variation options to discover the name of each 
character and which fonts contain it.
You can add keyboard layouts for other languages from the Apple menu by 
choosing System Preferences➪International and then choosing Input Menu. 
Each language you select shows up as a menu option under the flag icon on 
the menu bar.
Select Flag-->Select Show Keyboard Viewer, and a small keyboard corre-
sponding to the language you chose appears. You can enter characters with 
it by clicking its buttons.
Mac windows versus Windows windows
This section refers to windows spelled with a lowercase w — those rectangu-
lar boxes on your computer’s screen where all the action happens. Again, the 
basic idea in OS X is similar to what you’re used to in the Microsoft operating 
system. You see a title bar at the top of each window, with colored buttons 
you can click. From left to right:

107
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
 
✓ Red: Closes the window
 
✓ Orange: Minimizes the window (it slurps down to the Dock)
 
✓ Green: Resizes the window to make better use of the screen
You move a window by clicking the title bar and dragging with the mouse. A 
scroll bar and slider appear on the right side. You can also adjust the window 
size by dragging a corner — only the lower-right corner on a Mac, but any 
corner in Windows.
May I See the Menu, Please?
As already mentioned, the menu bar in OS X is at the top of the screen, not 
in each window. The menu you see changes depending on which applica-
tion’s window is at the front. You change which application window is in 
front by either clicking a window that’s behind the one in front or clicking the 
application’s icon on the Dock.
 
You can see a summary of all open applications by holding down the 
Command key (Ô) and pressing the Tab key. As shown in Figure 5-2, you 
see a translucent bar with icons for each running application. Release the 
Command key, and the selected application comes to the front. Keep holding 
down the Command key and press the Tab key repeatedly to cycle through 
all applications. This feature is similar to the one performed by pressing 
Alt+Tab in Windows. If you hold down the Command key and press the accent-
tilde key, `~ (just above the Tab key), OS X cycles through the open windows 
of the front application.
 
Figure 5-2: 
The Ô+Tab 
display.
 
Keep it simple
You have oodles of ways to customize Mac OS X 
using system and application preferences, 
and you can download software that gives you 
even more possibilities. I recommend restraint. 
Don’t customize OS X more than necessary, 
particularly when you’re first getting used to 
working with it. The closer your Mac software 
is to its out-of-the-box configuration, the easier 
it is to get help when you have a problem, 
whether it’s from this book, from Web sites, or 
from Apple customer service.

108
Part II: Making the Switch 
Apple menu
The leftmost menu is always the Apple menu, and it always offers the same 
set of choices, regardless of which applications are in use. Those choices are 
described in this list:
 
✓ About This Mac: Provides a quick summary of your computer’s configu-
ration, including memory, processor, and operating system release. 
Choose More Info for an excruciatingly complete rundown of everything 
in, on, or attached to your computer.
 
✓ Software Update: Updates your Mac to the latest versions of the 
software that came with it. Your Mac checks for updates every week 
automatically unless you change the setting, labeled, unsurprisingly, 
Software Update, in the System Preferences pane.
 
✓ Mac OS X Software: Opens the Apple Web site, where you can download 
neat stuff — some free, some not.
 
✓ System Preferences: Lets you see and change the numerous settings 
associated with OS X system software. It’s the equivalent of Control 
Panel in Windows. Figure 5-3 shows the main window you see when you 
choose System Preferences, with all the icons you click to complete 
specific settings chores.
 
✓ Dock: Lets you control the size, location, and behavior of the Dock. 
Depending on your choices, the Dock can be your best friend or be truly 
annoying.
 
 The option I like best is Turn Hiding On, which moves the Dock off the 
screen until you steer your cursor all the way to the bottom edge, at 
which time the Dock pops up, ready to do your bidding. Move the cursor 
away from the bottom of the screen, and the Dock hides itself again.
 
Figure 5-3:

109
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
 
✓ Recent Items: Offers a quick way to return to the application, document, 
or server that you were just using. You can tell OS X how far back the 
Recent Items lists should go in the Appearance pane under System 
Preferences. The default is ten items.
 
✓ Force Quit: Lets you kill any application that isn’t responding to com-
mands (see Figure 5-4). Yes, Mac applications freeze, just as Windows 
applications do. Commit to memory the Force Quit keyboard shortcut: 
Option+Ô+Esc. You may need it if you can’t open the menu for some 
reason. It’s the Mac equivalent of the Windows “three-finger salute”: 
Ctrl+Alt+Delete.
 
✓ Sleep, Restart, Shut Down, and Log Out: These commands perform 
the same tasks as they do in Windows. Apple provides only one sleep 
option; there’s no separate hibernate nonsense. You control the sleep 
settings in the Energy Saver pane of System Preferences.
 
Figure 5-4:

Quit

Application menu
The menu to the right of the Apple menu has the same name as whichever 
application is in front, and looking at the menu is the easiest way to find out 
just which application is active, if more than one is open. As with the Apple 
menu, this menu’s contents are essentially the same from application to 
application. The top item displays the About screen for the application, 
which gives the application’s version number and copyright notice and any 
other information that the application’s developers want to tell you.
Other menu choices to expect are described in this list:
 
✓ Hide and Hide Others: These items (and their keyboard shortcuts) 
are handy to keep in mind when your screen becomes cluttered. 
Keep pressing Ô+H until the application you want is in front; press 
Option+Ô+H to hide the rest.

110
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
✓ Preferences: Choose this menu item to change the application’s set-
tings. It’s one of the most important menu items to know about for 
PC-to-Mac switchers.
 
✓ Quit (and its shortcut, Ô+Q): Tells the program to terminate; it’s 
equivalent to Exit in Windows.
 
✓ Show All: Brings all windows for this application ahead of any other 
applications’ windows you may have open.
 
The Finder’s application menu is where you empty the Trash.
File and Edit menus
In most applications, the two menus just to the right of the Apple menu 
are the File and Edit menus. These two closely resemble their Windows 
counterparts.
 
One big difference is that the Quit command isn’t on the File menu; instead, 
it’s on the application menu, to the left. This is one of the more annoying 
differences between Windows and OS X. Just remember the Ô+Q shortcut 
and avoid the aggravation. Also, Preferences, the OS X equivalent of Settings 
in Windows, isn’t on the Edit menu. It’s on the application menu. It has a 
shortcut, too: Ô+, (command comma).
When you save a new document for the first time or choose Open or Save As 
from the File menu, you see a dialog much as you would see in Windows XP 
or Vista when doing the same things. Figure 5-5 shows many of the navigation 
features of this window, including the sidebar with your favorite destinations 
and the option to select among Icon, List, and Column views. Note also the 
disclosure triangle in the upper-right corner.
 
Figure 5-5: 
The Save 
As dialog.
 

111
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
 
If you see the shortened version of the Save As dialog, shown in Figure 5-6, 
rather than the full version (refer to Figure 5-5), click the little disclosure 
triangle button to the right of the filename text field toward the top of the 
dialog to bring back the full dialog.
 
Figure 5-6: 
The stunted 
Save As 
dialog box.
 
Help and Window menus
The Help menu is located to the right of the menus associated with the 
application, just as in Windows. To the Help menu’s left, you usually find a 
Window menu, similar to the one found in many Microsoft Windows applica-
tions. The Window menu lists which windows the application has open and 
lets you bring the one you want to the front. You can also press Ô+~ (tilde) 
to cycle through an application’s open windows.
Applications typically have several other menus between the Edit and 
Window menus; these other menus are usually organized in ways that should 
be familiar to Windows users.
Filing Away in OS X
Files in OS X are similar to files in Windows or any other operating system, 
with one exception that you probably don’t need to know about. So skip the 
next paragraph unless you’re curious.
 
In most operating systems, a file is just a bucket of bits — 1s and 0s that 
programs can interpret as a text document, photograph, music, or whatever. 
The operating system is responsible for storing the file accurately and copying 
or deleting it if asked to, but that’s it. Macs may add the resource fork to 
this notion of what a file is supposed to be. (Fork is used here in the sense of a 
fork in the road, not a fork in the steak.) The resource fork contains additional 
information about what’s in the file that the application can use. The good 
news is that you probably don’t have to worry about this issue. Resource 
forks are less common in newer applications, and OS X handles the forks 
automatically. The files you bring over from Windows don’t have resource 
forks, anyway.

112
Part II: Making the Switch 
File types
Many of the file types you’re used to on the PC are supported directly by 
OS X: documents in Microsoft Word format, photographs in JPEG format, and 
music MP3s, for example. Others require additional software. Still others, 
particularly music files purchased under one of the proprietary Microsoft 
formats, such as for the Zune music player, may not be usable, except, of 
course, when you’re running Windows on your Mac. I give you the gory 
details about moving files from your PC to your Mac in Chapter 6.
Filenames
Filenames in Mac OS X can be as long as 255 characters, and you can use any 
characters you like except the colon (:). Windows doesn’t allow any of these 
special characters in filenames:
: \ / | * ? " < >
 
If you’re planning to move files back and forth between your PC and Mac, 
follow the more restrictive Windows naming rules so that filenames don’t get 
mangled.
Extensions
In the Windows world, filenames have extensions: a period (.) and a few cryp-
tic letters that are added to the end of a filename — for example, Chapter5.
doc. The file extension tells the operating system which type of file it is so 
that the OS knows which program should open it. OS X uses file extensions in 
the same way, but it also has a separate way to know the file’s creator, using 
a special four-character code that is assigned to each application and is 
stored with the file’s directory entry.
Pathnames
A file is stored in a folder, which may be in another folder, which may be in 
another folder, and so on. Operating systems keep track of all that hierarchy 
by using a pathname, which lists all the folders you have to visit in turn to 
find your file. The names are separated by a special character. In Windows, 
this character is the backslash (\). For Macs — and in Unix, in Linux, and on 
the Internet — the forward slash (/), sometimes called the front slash, is 
used. You can make nice patterns stringing them together, like so: 
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/ — but this has nothing to do with what I’m talking 
about.

113
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
Disks and volumes
Disk drives appear on the desktop just as files do, but with distinctive icons 
(see Figure 5-7). The main hard drive icon looks like the real hard drive 
in your computer. Unfortunately, most people have never taken apart a com-
puter and don’t have a clue what a hard drive looks like. External hard drive 
icons resemble an external drive, with either a FireWire or USB logo on it, 
indicating the manner of connection. Optical disc icons look like, well, optical 
discs. Flash drives usually look like an old external floppy drive, as do virtual 
volumes that appear whenever you open a disk image file (which has a .dmg 
extension).
The Mac way to eject or dismount one of these disk volumes is to drag the 
volume to the Trash. This peculiar idiom goes back to the earliest Macs. 
You aren’t deleting any information when you do this, and the Trash Can 
changes to an Eject icon ()) when you’re dragging a disk or volume, to 
emphasize that nothing is being trashed. If dragging disks to the Trash seems 
too weird — you’ve become a true Mac person when it makes sense — 
right-click the disk or volume icon and select Eject from the menu that 
appears. All ejectable volumes also appear in Finder window sidebars and 
have Eject symbols ()) next to them that you can click.

Aliases
Maybe you used shortcuts in Windows. A shortcut is an icon that points to 
another file, program, or disk drive. Macs have a similar feature, alias, which 
is quite handy. You can create an alias by clicking the name or icon of the 

114
Part II: Making the Switch 
file, program, or disk volume you want to alias and then choosing Make Alias 
from the Finder’s File menu. It’s worth remembering the keyboard incanta-
tion for making aliases: Ô+L. Just as in Windows, the alias icon appears with 
a little arrow in its lower-left corner, and you can move the alias anywhere 
you want. You can even move it to the Trash if you no longer need it; the 
original file doesn’t go away. Mac OS X has one big improvement over this 
Windows feature, however: In Windows, if you move the original file to 
another folder or change its name, Windows becomes unhappy and doesn’t 
know where to find the file any more. OS X keeps track of where the file went, 
and the alias still works as long as the file stays on the same drive. Of course, 
if you delete the original file or eject the drive it’s on, there’s not much OS X 
can do.
Watch out for aliases when you want to copy files to another medium, such 
as an external hard drive, CD-R, or flash drive. If you drag an alias, only the 
alias is copied, not the file. To copy the file or folder that the alias points to, 
click the alias and choose File➪Show Original, or just press Ô+R.
The Finder Is Your Friend
When you first start your computer, you find yourself in a special program 
that Apple calls the Finder. The Finder is somewhat like Windows Explorer, 
but it’s an even more basic tool on the Mac than Explorer is in Windows. You 
use it all the time.
You can reach the Finder by clicking anywhere on the desktop or selecting 
its icon from the Dock. Pressing Ô+F3 makes all other windows go away, 
and you see only the desktop and the Finder. Press Ô+F3 again to bring 
everything back.
Moving around with Finder windows
You use Finder windows to move around among folders. You see a window 
when you double-click a folder or choose File➪New Finder Window from 
the Finder.
As shown in Figure 5-8, the name of the folder is at the top of the Finder 
window. The icon to its left is live; you can click it and drag it to wherever 
you want, just as you would drag the folder’s icon in its parent folder or on 
the desktop.

115
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
 
Figure 5-8: 
A Finder 
window in 
Cover-Flow 
view.
 
 
Finder windows have a sidebar on the left with a list of available storage 
volumes at the top and selected folders at the bottom. You can customize 
them by dragging folders into or out of the list area. Each Finder window has a 
toolbar at the top. You can select from four different ways to view files: by 
icon, list, column, or cover-flow. List view includes details such as when the 
file was last modified, its size, and its kind (Word document or picture, for 
example). Folders have small triangles next to them. If you click one, the folder 
expands. You can expand and manipulate more than one folder this way. 
Column view shows you the contents of the current folder and the folder that 
contains it, along with, optionally, a preview of any file you select. Widen 
columns by dragging the II icon below the scroll bars. You can customize the 
contents of the file view by choosing Finder➪View➪Customize View Options.
Cool Cover-Flow view is based on the way iTunes and iPods display album 
covers to help you find the music you want, but in the Finder, Cover-Flow 
view shows a preview of file contents. Click the Quick Look “eye” icon at the 
top of the window (or press the spacebar), and you see a readable, scrollable 
preview of the center file. Click the double-arrow icon at the bottom of that 
view and you see a full-screen version. Quick Look supports text files, PDFs, 
movies, Keynote presentations, and Microsoft Word and Excel files — no 
need to open files in an application just to see what’s inside.
The Finder window toolbar also has backward and forward arrow buttons 
that are initially grayed out. As you open and close folders, these buttons 
let you return to a previous view, in much the same way as you would with 
buttons in an Internet Web browser. The Finder window toolbar also has 
an action menu with a gear icon that lets you choose options that are also 
available on the Finder menu. You can even customize the toolbar from the 
Finder’s View menu and add icons. I find the Path icon particularly useful 
because it shows all the folders that include the current one and lets you pop 

116
Part II: Making the Switch 
back to any one of them. You can also drag files and folders to the Finder 
window toolbar and the item then appears in all Finder windows. Right-click 
the icon to remove it from the toolbar. A temporary (Temp) folder can be 
handy when you’re rearranging files, for example.
 
The text at the bottom of each Finder window tells you how much space 
remains on the disk drive or storage volume on which the folder is located. 
This is the easiest way to find out how much disk space you have available.
Getting info
Click an icon on the desktop or in a Finder window and press Ô+I. A window 
appears with everything you always wanted to know about that file but were 
afraid to ask, including what kind of file it is, how big it is, where it’s located, 
and when it was created and last modified. You can find much more if you 
click the little triangles next to other items in the Get Info window, such as 
Name & Extension, Open With (which lets you pick the application to open 
this file or all files of this type), Preview, and Ownership & Permissions. 
This last section lets you control who can read and who can change the file 
or folder. See Chapter 19, the section about understanding file permission 
basics, for more info on permissions.
Looking at optical drives: CDs and DVDs
All new Macs (except the MacBook Air) can read and write (burn) CDs and 
DVDs. An optional external SuperDrive is available for the Air.
 
Most Macs come with slot-loading optical drives that work with only full-size 
CDs and DVDs. Full-size discs are about 43/4 inches in diameter (120 mm, to 
be exact). Don’t even think of trying to insert a smaller disk or one of those 
cute CD thingies the size of a credit card. If you need to read or create smaller-
format discs, get a tray-loading external drive that supports them and is Mac 
compatible.
Singing the Blu-ray blues
As the time this book went to press, Apple didn’t offer a drive that can read 
Blu-ray discs. These discs are the same size as CDs and DVDs, but hold much 
more data — up to 50GB — and are used to distribute high-definition (HD) 
movies. You can buy Blu-ray drives from MCEtech.com that you can install 
in a Mac Pro. MCE also sells external Blu-ray drives that work with other 

117
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
Macs, and it will even install one to replace your Mac’s internal SuperDrive. 
(It reads and writes CDs and DVDs, too.) You can use the Blu-ray drive to 
back up files and, if you buy the extra software, create HD movies that you 
can play on standard Blu-ray players.
The one thing you can’t do is play commercial Blu-ray movies on your Mac 
under OS X. (You can do that if you boot under Windows.) Apple isn’t happy 
with the Blu-ray license terms — Steve Jobs called them “a world of hurt.” 
Maybe things will be worked out by the time you read this chapter. Then 
again, Apple distributes HD movies via the iTunes store, so adding Blu-ray 
may not be on the top of Apple’s priority list.
Providing accessibility
Mac OS X has a range of features designed to improve accessibility for users 
with disabilities. These features include ways to make the mouse easier to 
use (including making the cursor bigger) and to operate the computer by 
using only the keyboard; the speech recognition technology, which lets OS X 
respond to spoken commands; and the ability to attach some assistive 
technology devices. You find the settings for most of these features by 
choosing System Preferences from the Apple menu and then selecting either 
Universal Access or Speech. See Chapter 17 for more on accessibility.
Installing software
When you try to install software on your Mac, OS X asks you for a password. 
If more than one user has an account on the computer, only those with 
administrative privileges can install software. Chapter 10 has more on setting 
up accounts; also, see the section “Setting up additional accounts,” later in 
this chapter. If you give your kids an account, don’t give them admin status. 
That way, you can control what software they load.
After you give a valid password, installing software on your Mac is simple. In 
most cases, the downloaded file or installation disc opens as a window, such 
as the one shown in Figure 5-9. You then just drag the icon or folder that 
contains the application into the Applications folder, which normally is in 
the sidebar of all Finder windows. Some applications come with install 
scripts. For those, you just double-click the install icon and follow the 
instructions. You may be given an option to customize your installation. 
Unless you’re absolutely sure that you know what you want, installing the 
default configuration recommended by the software’s publisher is best.

118

If you’re new to the Mac and are buying only new software, you aren’t likely to 
run into software written for the older PowerPC processors that Apple used to 
use. But it’s worth knowing that your Intel Mac can run software written for 
older PowerPC Macs as long as that software is designed for OS X. Apple uses 
some fancy Rosetta technology to do this. You have to install Rosetta first; it’s 
in the Optional Installs folder on the Restore disk that comes with your Mac. 
Mac OS X on Intel Macs isn’t designed to run software written for Mac OS 9 
and older editions — the so-called classic Mac software. Ways exist to work 
around this limitation, but they aren’t easy or fully functional. I describe some 
in the bonus chapter at www.dummies.com/go/switchingtoamacfd2e.
Uninstalling software
You uninstall software in OS X by moving into the Trash the folder or icon 
you originally installed. If you don’t know where the program icon is, right-
click any of its aliases, including the one on the Dock. Then select Show in 
Finder from the menu you see. If the program icon looks like a package, 
drag it to the Trash. If the icon is contained in a folder associated with the 
software, drag the folder to the Trash. In either case, don’t empty the Trash 
until you’re sure that everything else is working properly.

 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
Printing on the Mac
Printers are the Bermuda Triangle of personal computing: Setting them up 
strikes fear in the hearts of most geeks. Apple has done a lot to simplify 
the process. It has introduced the Bonjour technology, which many printer 
manufacturers have adopted. Bonjour automates all the messy stuff. Also, 
OS X comes with drivers for dozens of printer models. So, if you have a fairly 
new printer, everything should go smoothly.
To set up your printer and do a test print, follow these steps:
 
1. Make sure that the printer has power and is connected to your Mac.
 
 If it’s a USB printer, plug it into one of your USB ports. If it’s an Ethernet 
printer, make sure that it’s connected to the same network as your Mac. 
If it’s a Wi-Fi printer, make sure that AirPort is on. Bluetooth printers 
may take some extra steps; check the printer’s manual for instructions.
 
2. Turn on the printer.
 
3. Open a short document or create one using TextEdit.
 
4. Choose Print from the File menu. Your printer’s name should appear 
in the Print dialog. Select it and off you go.
If your printer doesn’t appear, try these steps:
 
1. Choose System Preferences➪Print & Fax and click the plus (+) icon.
 
2. Wait half a minute.
 
3. If your printer still doesn’t appear in the list, click the More Printers 
button and select the type of printer you’re using from the list at 
the top.
 
4. If nothing seems to work, go to the printer manufacturer’s support 
Web site for the printer you’re using and see whether you can find 
software for Mac OS X to download.
 
 See Chapter 20 for more printer troubleshooting tips.
Setting up additional accounts
If more than one person will be using the computer, you should give each 
person her own account. To do so, follow these steps:
 
1. On the Apple menu, choose System Preferences➪Accounts.

120
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
2. In the Accounts pane, click the plus sign (+) under the list of accounts.
 
 If the list is grayed out, click the lock icon beneath it to unlock it. You 
may have to enter your password to complete this step.
 
3. For each new account you create, when prompted, enter the account 
holder’s name, a short name that is the name of the account holder’s 
home directory, and the password chosen for the account.
 
 The account holder can change her password later, if she wants.
 
4. (Optional) Select a picture for the account holder.
 
5. (Optional) Specify which programs will start up automatically for that 
account.
 
6. (Optional) Set up parental controls if this account is for a child.
 
 Read Chapter 17 before setting up the account; I have lots of tips about 
the best way to set up an account for a child.
Backing up
The most important thing to remember about backing up is to swivel your 
head to look in all directions before putting the car in gear — do not rely on 
the rearview mirror. Wait, that’s not the right advice for this book. The most 
important thing to remember about backing up your computer is to do it. 
Regularly. Most people don’t back up their data even once a month, and that 
isn’t often enough.
National Public Radio once ran a story about a woman who worked for a 
company that recovers data from defunct hard drives. The company charges 
lots of money for this service, but it isn’t successful for all customers. The 
woman was trained as a grief counselor, and the company hired her to break 
the bad news to those unfortunate customers that their precious data was 
gone forever.
Time Machine and Time Capsule
Fortunately, the OS X feature Time Machine makes backing up your computer 
easier than backing up your car. Plug an external drive into your Mac, and 
Time Machine asks whether you want to use it as your backup device. Agree, 
and Time Machine takes over, backing everything up. It works in the back-
ground so that you can carry on with whatever you’re doing with your Mac. 
You want a big external drive, 250GB or more. The Apple Time Capsule 
includes a large hard drive and a Wi-Fi router that lets all Macs running at 
least OS X version 10.5 to back up using Time Machine.
Time Machine awakens every night at midnight and backs up everything that 
has changed since the last backup. You can change the time, of course, and 
your Mac must be on or sleeping, not shut down. Time Machine organizes 

121
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
the backup files by date and presents the data as a series of Finder windows 
stacked up behind each other, stretching into the past. You can easily cycle 
back to the time you want and restore the version of the file you want. If you 
have stuff you’d rather not back up — and I won’t speculate on what those 
items might be — you can tell Time Machine to skip them. You can also tell 
Time Machine to back up to a server on your network, if you prefer: Just click 
the Time Machine icon in System Preferences to make all these choices. And, 
if you’re planning to back up out of your driveway, make sure that no toys, 
kids, or pets are behind your car before you get in.
Optical discs
 
Time Machine is truly cool, but I still like to burn important files to CD-ROMs 
or DVD-ROMs every now and then and keep them in a location that’s separate 
from where I keep the computer. I like having data on something I can touch 
and know won’t be reused for something else.
Portable media
For short-term backup, you can’t beat USB flash drives. They’re tiny and 
inexpensive, and many can hold many gigabytes of data. Having all the 
projects you’re working on in your pocket feels good and lets you work on 
other computers when you need to.
The information superhighway
A number of services on the Internet offer large amounts of storage that you 
can use to back up files. Free services include Google Gmail and Adrive.com. 
The $99-per-year Apple MobileMe service includes storage space. These 
plans offer the following advantages:
 
✓ They provide off-site backup — your files are safe even if your house 
burns down.
 
✓ The companies that provide these plans generally back up their servers, 
so you have an additional layer of protection.
 
If you’re concerned about what’s left of our privacy in the information age, you 
should be aware that, in the United States at least, your data enjoys far fewer 
legal protections when it is stored outside your premises.
Enjoying the Difference
So far in this chapter, I concentrate on what you need to get comfortable 
with Mac OS X, but there is much more to know. The following sections 
offer a quick rundown on some of the cooler features. I cover others in later 
chapters.

122
Part II: Making the Switch 
Dashboard
Press F4 (the key with the meter symbol) and a whole new window of 
small applications appears as the screens you were viewing fade into the 
background. Welcome to Dashboard. You see, out of the box, only a few 
programs — Apple calls them widgets: a calculator, an analog clock, a desk 
calendar, and a weather forecast. Move the cursor over the lower-right 
corner of the analog clock. A little i appears. Click it. The clock flips over 
so that you can change its settings. Try the same trick on other widgets. 
Press F4 a second time and Dashboard goes away, letting you resume your 
other work.
You can download thousands more Dashboard widgets, and many for free. 
Just choose Ú➪Mac OS X Software or go to www.apple.com/downloads/
macosx. Some of my favorites include
 
✓ iStat Pro: System monitor
 
✓ Kennedy Space Center: Video feed
 
✓ Quotes.com: Stock-price service
 
✓ Systran: Language translator (as in French and German, not C++ and 
Python)
You can even make your own widgets; see Chapter 15, the section about 
adding handy widgets to the Dashboard, for more info.
Exposé
Exposé is a handy set of functions that Apple assigned to these function keys:
 
✓ F3: Separates all open windows on your display so that you can pick the 
one you want. (Check the symbol on the F3 key for a depiction.) When 
you have lots of windows open, the images that pressing F3 presents can 
become tiny. If you hover the cursor over an image, its title is displayed 
legibly. Click an image and it becomes the front window.
 
✓ Control+F3: Does the same trick as F3 but only for the application 
in front.
 
✓ Ô+F3: Makes all open windows scurry to the edges of the screen so that 
you can see the desktop. Click in the empty desktop space to see the 
Finder.

123
 Chapter 5: Mac OS X for Windows Users
Pressing any of these keys a second time restores your original view of the 
screen.
 
If you have a laptop with the Apple Multi-Touch trackpad, you can access 
Exposé with four-finger swipes. You can set up Mighty Mouse, if you have 
one, to do this as well. See “Pointing the way — the mouse and trackpad” and 
“Gesturing with Multi-Touch,” earlier in this chapter.
Front Row
You filled your Mac with music, photos, and videos. It’s time to kick back and 
let your Mac entertain you. That’s where the tiny, simple, optional Apple 
Remote takes over. Click its menu button and your messy work screen 
dissolves into a simple screen that lets you choose which media to play, in 
much the same way as you pick songs on the iPod. This feature, Front Row, 
is something you can take lying down.
Spotlight
Spotlight is the Apple search tool for Mac OS X. Its icon, a magnifying glass, is 
located on the menu bar in the upper-right corner of your screen. Its key-
board shortcut is Ô+spacebar. Mac OS X maintains an indexed database of 
keywords and updates it as new files are added, so searches are fast. 
Spotlight starts displaying stuff as you type, so you often don’t even have to 
finish typing the word you’re searching for. Here are some tips on using 
Spotlight:
 
✓ If you type more than one word: Spotlight searches for items that 
match both words.
 
✓ If you want searches to match either item: Place a vertical bar (|) 
between them.
 
✓ If you want Spotlight to exclude a word: Precede the word with a 
hyphen. For example, you might search for dogs|cats –lions –pitbulls.
You also find a Spotlight search box in the upper-right corner of each Finder 
window. If you click the Save button under the search box, OS X saves the 
results of a search in a smart folder, which updates automatically as you add, 
change, and delete files. You can also tell Spotlight to ignore certain files by 
using its pane in System Preferences.
Sometimes you just want to search for an old-fashioned filename. In that 
case, in the Finder, choose File➪Find (or press Ô+F) and select your options.

124
Part II: Making the Switch 
Screen saver and desktop background
Leave it to Apple to turn the boring screen saver into a killer app. Choose 
System Preferences➪Desktop & Screen Saver. The Desktop tab that appears 
lets you select a background pattern or photo for your screen when you’re 
working. Make your pick and then click the Screen Saver tab. The screen 
saver kicks in after your computer has been idle for a few minutes. (You can 
tell it how many minutes with the slider you see.)
 
Apple provides several artistic displays to choose from (I like Cosmos), but 
the choice I like best is the Pictures folder. The screen saver randomly selects 
and animates pictures from your collection. You can also limit its choices to a 
folder or slide show. If you enjoy taking pictures but rarely get to look at them, 
using this screen saver will bring tears to your eyes.
Apple has gone one step further, however. You can set things up so that you 
can send pictures to someone else’s Mac over the Internet. It’s a helpful way 
to let grandparents keep up with what’s happening with their grandkids. See 
Chapter 17 for more details.
Is Windows 7 a copy of OS X?
The computer industry wouldn’t be where it is 
today if companies didn’t build on the good ideas 
of others. Still, some features of the new Microsoft 
Windows 7 operating system seem awfully close 
to a slavish copy of features in OS X. Windows 7 
has a facility that looks very much like Dashboard, 
but the programs are called gadgets rather than 
widgets. The Windows 7 search box is in the 
lower-left corner of the screen rather than in the 
upper-right, its OS X hangout. The Windows 7 
color schemes seem awfully familiar to users of 
older versions of OS X.
The good news is that learning to use OS X helps 
prepare you for Windows 7. The bad news is that 
Microsoft’s ability to innovate seems to be fal-
tering. In the five years it took Microsoft to 
develop Vista, Apple released three major 
operating system upgrades — Jaguar, Panther, 
and Tiger — with a fourth, Leopard (OS X 10.5) 
released a couple of months after Vista Home 
Edition. Snow Leopard and Windows 7 came out 
at approximately the same time (second half of 
2009). Some analysts are speculating that 
Windows 7 may be Microsoft’s last personal 
computer operating system, though I think that’s 
unlikely. Microsoft will have to keep catching up 
with Apple.

Chapter 6
Moving Files from Your 
PC to the Mac
In This Chapter
▶ Backing up your PC to the Mac
▶ Recovering files from a trashed PC
▶ Handling common file types
▶ Purging files before getting rid of your hard drive
You have your Mac up and running and you played around with OS X 
a bit, so you at least know how to start programs and make folders. 
You’re ready to take the plunge and begin using your Mac for the bulk of your 
work. It’s time to move those files off that PC and onto your Mac.
Backing Up and Movin’ On
I hate to be a nag, but when was the last time you backed up your PC? If 
you’re like most users, it has been awhile. Even if you’re planning to keep 
using your PC, it’s worth moving your files to the Mac just to have another 
backup. The next PC virus could be your last.
I subscribe to the belt-and-suspenders approach to backing up. You should 
back up everything to your Mac and make copies of your most important files 
to permanent, write-once CDs or DVDs.
If you made an inventory of your PC’s files, as I suggest in Chapter 3, look 
over the inventory and add anything you may have missed. If not, now 
would be a good time to make an inventory. One important question your 
inventory should answer is how much data you need to back up. If you save 
mostly word processing documents and e-mail, you may well have less than 

126
Part II: Making the Switch 
the 700MB that a single CD-R optical disc can hold. If you take some digital 
pictures and occasionally download music, all your files may fit on a 4.7 GB 
DVD-R or an 8 GB flash drive. If you’re an avid photographer, videographer, 
or music collector, you’re better off using an external hard drive.
The good news is that you have many different methods by which to 
accomplish this moving job. I describe a bunch of ways, but you don’t need 
to read them all. Pick one that sounds as though it might work for you and 
give it a try.
External hard drive
High-capacity external hard drives are quite affordable these days. You can 
buy a 1 terabyte (TB) drive for less than $150. A terabyte equals a trillion 
bytes or 1,000 gigabytes or the equivalent of 700,000 floppy disks — a stack 
over a mile high. You probably don’t need that much space, but drives half 
that size (500GB) sell for less than $100.
 
Be sure to buy an external drive labeled “for Mac and PC.” These drives are 
usually formatted using the Microsoft FAT32 format, which both Macs and PCs 
handle well. If your drive is formatted in the newer Microsoft NTFS format, 
your Mac should be able to read it, although writing to it may be a problem. 
You can reformat the drive with the OS X Disk Utility after you finish transferring 
your data.
Here’s how transferring files with an external drive works:
 
1. Plug the external drive’s USB cable into your PC and copy your files to 
the drive.
 
2. After everything is copied, shut down Windows and unplug the hard 
drive’s data cable from the PC.
 
3. Plug the cable into your Mac.
 
 The drive’s letter or name should appear on your Mac’s desktop.
 
4. Double-click the drive icon.
 
5. Copy your files from the external drive to your Mac.
 
 Either copy everything to the Mac (make a folder for all the files), or 
just copy the files you need and keep the rest on the external drive. 
Remember that you can use the Finder to navigate to your Documents 
folder, Pictures folder, and others.

127
 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
Flash memory and iPods
USB flash drives are handy for moving modest amounts of data — as much 
as 32GB. Follow the same procedure for an external hard drive, as outlined 
in the preceding section. You can also use an iPod in disk drive mode to 
transfer data. The larger models hold 120 gigabytes, enough to back up most 
older PCs. In either case, you can again follow the same procedure as for an 
external hard drive. Go to apple.com/macosx/switch/howto/ipod.html 
for tips on using an iPod to transfer files.
Optical media — burn, baby, burn
If your PC has a CD burner or, even better, a DVD burner, you can move 
files by burning discs on your PC and reading them on the Mac. Use ISO 
format and avoid “sessions” or “packet write.” This approach has the added 
advantage that your files will be stored on a separate medium that you can 
put away for safekeeping. I like read-only media, such as CD-Rs and DVD-Rs, 
better than read-write (R/W) media because I’m not tempted to reuse it for 
something else. Read-only media tends to last longer, too. One source of free 
CD and DVD writing software is cdburnerxp.se.
Ethernet or Wi-Fi at your service
If your PC has an Ethernet port or a Wi-Fi wireless connection, you can 
network your PC to the Mac, set up your PC as a file server, and then copy 
over everything you need. This process has five steps:
 
1. Connect the Mac and PC to the same network.
 
2. Enable file sharing on the PC.
 
3. Make sharable the files and folders you want to transfer.
 
4. Access the shared folders from your Mac.
 
5. Move the files.
 
When it works, networking is the easiest way to transfer your files. But some 
settings can easily be messed up along the way, and you might find it hard 
to figure out what the obstacle is when networking becomes notworking. 
You also need enough free disk space on the Mac to hold all your files. When 
you’re all done transferring the files, you still should make a backup copy of 
everything. These are the reasons I recommend using an external hard drive 
in most cases.

128
Part II: Making the Switch 
I talk more about networking in Chapter 9, but here’s a quick approach to 
setting up your PC for file sharing:
 
1. If your home network doesn’t have Wi-Fi, you need an Ethernet cable. 
Plug the Mac into your Ethernet router or, even better, just run an 
Ethernet cable between the Mac and the PC.
 
 You can borrow the cable that connects your PC to your high-speed 
Internet modem, if you have one. Don’t forget to put it back when you’re 
done.
 
2. Determine whether your Mac has already detected your PC on the 
network. In the Finder, choose Go➪Network. Then click the various 
icons in the Network browser that appears, to see whether your PC’s 
icon is among them.
 
3. If you don’t see your PC from the Mac, choose Start➪Control Panel 
on the PC and double-click the Network Setup Wizard icon. Follow its 
instructions.
 
 Make a note in the margin of the name you give your computer and the 
workgroup name that’s assigned.
 
4. After you set up file sharing, drag to the Shared Folder on the PC 
desktop the folders on the PC that you want to access on your Mac.
 
 Alternatively, you can right-click any folder you want to share and select 
Properties from the menu that appears. Click the Sharing tab and select 
the Share This Folder on the Network check box (see Figure 6-1).
 
Figure 6-1: 
The Folder 
Properties 
Sharing tab.
 

129
 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
 
5. On the Mac side, choose Go➪Network and look for icons with the 
names you just assigned. Double-click those icons.
 
 You should see your PC folders appear on the Mac desktop.
 
6. From the Finder menu, choose New Folder. Name the folder My PC 
files or whatever you want.
 
7. Drag all the files you want to this folder.
 
 For extra neatness points, make separate folders for each folder you 
bring over from the PC, such as My Documents, My Pictures, and My 
Movies, matching the names you used on your PC. After your files and 
folders are safely on the Mac, you won’t regret spending some quality 
time organizing them. When you’re done, move them all to your Mac’s 
Documents folder.
Commercial solutions
Moving files isn’t that hard, but if you’d rather leave this task to someone 
else, some folks would be happy to help for a modest fee.
Apple ProCare
Perhaps the easiest way to move your files is to sign up for the $99 Apple 
ProCare premium service plan when you buy your Mac at an Apple retail 
store. As part of the ProCare plan, the folks at the Apple store move your files 
for you. You have to bring them your PC within a limited time after you buy 
the Mac. Ask at the store for current details.
Apple offers additional suggestions on moving files at www.apple.com/lae/
switch/howto.
Move2Mac
Move2Mac is a commercial file-transfer product from Detto.com that costs 
about $75, though it’s often discounted. It comes with a special cable that 
you must use to transfer the files. Detto offers two types of cables. Both have 
a USB connector at one end that you plug into your Mac. If your PC has USB 
ports, you should buy the cable with a second USB connector. If the PC has a 
parallel printer port and is an older model, with no USB ports, or is running 
Windows 95 (which doesn’t support USB), you can use the cable that Detto 
offers with a USB connector at one end and a parallel printer port plug at the 
other.

130
Part II: Making the Switch 
You have to install Move2Mac software on both machines, so the PC must 
be in good enough shape to do this. Just in case it isn’t, I explain other 
approaches later in this chapter.
 
You cannot use a standard USB cable for installing Move2Mac software. 
USB is intended only to connect slave devices to an active computer, so 
the connector at the other end of a standard USB cable doesn’t plug into a 
computer. Detto cables have a blivit (a “something”) in the middle with a 
chip in it that lets the connection be made. The cables are for use only with 
Move2Mac software. You can’t use the Detto cable for any other purpose, 
such as hooking up a printer or networking two computers.
A big advantage of using the commercial solution is that providers of these 
services have worked through many more moving scenarios than I have 
space to tell you about. Move2Mac claims to handle documents, spread-
sheets, photos, music, files, folders, IE favorites, an IE home page, graphics, 
databases, an address book, and backgrounds.
Move2Mac doesn’t try to convert application data files from PC format to 
Mac format. I discuss those issues later in this chapter. If your life is on the 
PC, a commercial solution may be worth the money.
Clone your PC on your Mac, 
virtually speaking
If you’re thinking about running Windows on your Mac, consider using one of 
the third-party virtual hosting solutions — Parallels or VMWare — described 
in Chapter 16. Both allow you to copy your entire PC, operating system, 
applications, files, and settings to your Macintosh. Of course, you need to 
have enough hard drive space on your Mac to hold everything that’s now on 
the PC and still leave plenty of room for all the Mac stuff you want to add. 
And, you have to determine what the licenses you have for Windows and 
your application packages permit. In all likelihood, you need to remove all 
purchased software from the PC after you successfully make the transition. 
Make sure that you have a complete backup of everything before erasing the 
PC’s hard drive. See Chapter 22 for suggestions on what you might do with 
the erased PC.
In some ways, this solution is ideal. You have your complete PC environment 
on the Mac — files, applications, and all your settings. On the other hand, 
you haven’t yet transitioned to OS X; you merely have a new PC. Still, this 
approach allows you to take things gradually, moving one set of applications 
and files at a time as you’re ready. Meanwhile, you can surf the Internet in 
safety from the OS X side of your computer.

131
 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
Files on floppies, Zip disks, magnetic tape, 
and other media
If you have a collection of files on floppy disks, Zip disks, magnetic tape, or 
other obsolescent removable media, the simplest solution is to read them all 
onto your PC’s hard drive and then move them to the Mac with your other 
files. If you have too many disks or tapes for this strategy to be practical, or 
if you have only a few disks you really need but you’re not sure which ones, a 
few possibilities exist. You can also buy Zip drives with a USB interface from 
Iomega (www.iomega.com). For 3
1⁄2-inch floppy disks, Iomega (and others) 
sell a USB floppy drive that can read PC floppies. For other media, such as 
5
1⁄4-inch floppies or magnetic tapes, some companies can transfer your files 
for a fee, but you may be better off hanging on to your old PC until you’re 
sure that you no longer need any of the older files.
 
Before sending out removable media for conversion, or working on them 
yourself, open the write-protect tab on the media to reduce the likelihood of 
accidental erasure.
Recovering Data from a Damaged PC
We all know the safe computing rules by heart: Use a good antivirus program, 
never open e-mail attachments you weren’t expecting, and back up your 
files regularly. Most of us aren’t so careful. Or, maybe your kids figured out 
how to get around whatever security system you set up. Anyway, your PC is 
barely working, if it even boots. What do you do?
This problem has a number of solutions; a whole industry is devoted to it, in 
fact. The following sections cover a couple of these solutions.
Try accessing your PC from the Mac
If your PC boots, try accessing it from your Mac using an Ethernet cable, as 
described previously in this chapter. Even if the PC is barely responding, the 
server software may still be fully functional.
 
If your PC is so trashed that the mouse no longer works, you may still be able 
to control it using the Windows accessibility tools. To do so, follow these 
steps:

132
Part II: Making the Switch 
 
1. Press the Windows key on your PC’s keyboard to open the Start menu.
 
2. Use the arrow keys to highlight the Control Panel option, and then 
press Enter.
 
3. Use the arrow keys to highlight the Accessibility Options option; then 
press Enter.
 
4. Press Shift+Tab and then the right-arrow key to select the Mouse tab.
 
5. Press Alt+M to select the Use Mouse Keys check box; then press Enter.
 
6. Press Num Lock to turn on the numeric keypad.
 
 You should now be able to use the numeric keypad to move the cursor 
around without using the mouse. The 5 key is the mouse button. Press – 
(the minus key) for right-clicking and press / (the division sign) to get 
back to left-clicking. Press Insert to hold down the mouse button for 
dragging, and press Delete to stop dragging.
If you mess up at some point, remember that pressing Esc activates the 
Cancel button in dialog boxes in Windows — and in OS X.
Use the Windows System Restore program
The System Restore tool in Windows lets you roll the operating system back 
to a kinder, gentler time, before all the nasties got into it. To use it, follow 
these steps:
 
1. Save any open files.
 
2. Choose Start➪All Programs.
 
3. Choose Accessories➪System Tools➪System Restore.
 
4. Select the Restore My Computer to an Earlier Time option and then 
click the Next button.
 
5. Select a date far enough back when you dimly remember that your 
computer was working well; then click the Next button.
 
 If this restore date works, transfer your files and perform a backup as 
described earlier in this chapter. If the date you chose doesn’t work, you 
can try other dates, earlier or later.
Knoppix to the rescue
The complete PC operating system Knoppix fits on a single CD-R optical disc 
and can automatically boot up most PCs. It isn’t Windows or OS X, however; 
Knoppix is a version of the Linux operating system. That’s the bad news and 
the good news:

133
 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
 
✓ The bad news: You have enough of a challenge on your hands getting 
used to OS X without being introduced to a third system.
 
✓ The good news: Linux isn’t affected by whatever cooties your computer 
has. Also, you need to deal with only a few Linux commands.
You can make a Knoppix disc on your Mac that should boot in your PC, 
assuming that the PC hardware isn’t broken and its peripheral devices are 
fairly standard. Knoppix can detect and use most common peripherals. 
However, if your PC’s hard drive is encrypted, Knoppix can’t read it.
To make the Knoppix disc, you need a blank CD-R disc. Here’s the recipe:
 
1. Go to www.knoppix.org and click the English flag in the upper-left 
corner, assuming that Sie sprechen kein Deutsches.
 
2. Click the Order button and find a company in your country that sells 
Knoppix on CD for a nominal fee. Or, click the Download button and 
select a download server located on your continent.
 
 You’re asked to concur with a “use at your own risk” agreement. (You 
expect a warranty with free software?)
 
 If you accept the agreement, you see a list of available downloads. You 
normally want the latest English version, which will have a filename 
that looks something like KNOPPIX_V6.0.1CD-2009-02-08-EN.iso, 
where 6.0 is the version number, EN means it’s an English version, and 
.iso means it’s a disc image. You also can download files with similar 
names but with the extensions .md5 and .sha1. These cryptographic 
signatures enable you to verify that the files are authentic. For extra 
credit, download them as well. They’re very short, and you might as well 
act as though you’re interested. The .iso file, on the other hand, is big — 
about 700MB. It just fits on a CD-R. The size isn’t a big deal if you have a 
broadband connection, but plan on an overnight download if you use a 
dialup connection.
 
3. Download the files you selected by dragging them to the desktop; do 
the short ones first.
 
 When you have the .iso file on your Mac’s desktop, you’re ready to 
burn it to the blank CD-R disc.
 
4. Open the Application folder and then the Utilities folder.
 
5. Double-click the Disk Utility icon, and when the Disk Utility window 
opens, click the Burn button in the upper-left corner.
 
6. In the Select Image to Burn dialog, find the .iso file, click it, and 
click the Burn button.
 
7. Pop in a blank CD-R and let ’er rip.
Chill.

134
Part II: Making the Switch 
When the CD-R is all cooked, you see a message saying whether the burn 
was successful; if it wasn’t, try again on a fresh CD-R. After you complete a 
successful burn, eject the CD by right-clicking its icon and choosing Eject 
from the context menu. Label the CD with a soft marking pen.
Now you can put your new Knoppix disc into the PC’s CD reader and restart 
your PC. Knoppix takes a couple of minutes to boot, and lots of text flashes 
by as it does its thing, but when it’s done, you should see a nice welcome 
screen. On the left side of the screen, you see icons for all the drives that 
Knoppix found as it booted up. You should see an icon for your PC’s hard 
drive if it’s working. It’s labeled something like hda1. Double-click that icon. 
You should see the contents of your PC’s hard drive. With your PC contents 
on display, you can gather your files in one of the following ways:
 
✓ If you have one, connect a portable hard drive or a flash drive to the 
PC. Its icon should appear on the Knoppix desktop. You can now drag 
files from the PC to the device you plugged in.
 
 When you’re done transferring files, right-click the removable drive’s icon 
and select Unmount. Or, you can just shut down Knoppix by selecting Log 
Out from the K menu in the lower-left portion of the Knoppix taskbar.
 
✓ If you have an Internet e-mail account, such as Yahoo! or Gmail, you 
can email the files to yourself. Log on to your account using Konqueror, 
the Knoppix Web browser and file manager, and mail yourself files as 
attachments.
 
✓ If your PC hardware has a second optical drive that can burn optical 
discs, you can also write your files to a CD or DVD using Knoppix. 
Right-click in an open directory window, choose Action➪Create Data CD 
with K3b, and follow the instructions.
Knoppix can do a lot more, including repairing a damaged Windows file 
system and networking directly with your Mac, but these topics are too 
complex to cover here. Take a look at Knoppix For Dummies, by Paul G. Sery 
(Wiley Publishing), if you want to do more with this powerful tool.
Should you run antivirus software 
before transferring your files?
PC viruses don’t hurt OS X, but they could cause 
problems if you plan to run Windows on your 
Mac or exchange files with Windows users. So, 
updating and running your antivirus program 
before transferring your files is probably a wise 
move. However, if your PC is truly on the edge, 
you probably should move your important files 
off before running any programs. In that case, I 
suggest doing the file transfer twice, before and 
after an antivirus run. If the latter transfer goes 
smoothly, the first set of files can be erased.

 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
More extreme measures
If none of the above measures work, consider removing the drive and putting it 
in an external drive enclosure to mount on your Mac. It’s a bit tricky — you have 
to determine what type of hard drive you have to get the right enclosure — and 
more often than not in a bad PC it’s the disk that’s shot. If you’re not experienced 
in doing work on your computer’s insides, get a technician or repair shop to do 
this. Get an enclosure that’s designed to work with Macs as well as with PCs. 
Units that employ the Oxford chipset generally do. Putting your PC hard drive 
into a portable enclosure gives you another usable backup of your old files. It 
makes more sense if the hard drive is 20GB or more because it can later serve 
as a useful accessory to your Mac. Note that disks formatted in Windows NTFS 
open on OS X as read-only. When your Mac offers to reformat the drive, don’t 
allow the reformat unless you’re satisfied that all data is safely transferred and 
backed up. Then you can use the OS X Disk Utility to reformat the drive (which 
deletes all your files but doesn’t erase them fully) and use it as you want. Disk 
Utility can also erase the drive after you format it. Click the Erase tab and then 
click the Erase Free Space button.
If truly valuable (more than $1,000) files are on your hard drive, look for a 
hard drive data recovery firm. Visit www.myharddrivedied.com for 
interesting presentations on the process. They suggest some things you 
can do yourself if you’re willing to risk doing more damage.
Dealing with Common File Types
Most PC file types can be used with appropriate programs on the Mac. The 
following sections describe some of these file types.
Portable document format (.pdf)
The popular portable document format, originally developed by Adobe.com, 
is the standard display mode on OS X. The Preview program that comes with 
the Mac conveniently displays PDF documents. OS X can also create PDF 
files; it’s an option you find by choosing File➪Print for most programs. You 
don’t need to download or buy software to work with PDF files, although 
Adobe Acrobat offers additional capabilities beyond what OS X provides.
JPEG photos (.jpg)
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the name of the committee 
that pulled together the format. Macs love JPEGs. The OS X Preview application 
displays them, and the iPhoto program stores them, organizes them, slices 

136
Part II: Making the Switch 
them, dices them, and spits out slide shows and coffee table books. Both 
programs come with every Mac sold. I discuss iPhoto more in Chapter 12, 
but the quick way to get your photos into iPhoto is to move the files to your 
Pictures folder, open iPhoto, and choose File➪Import to Library.
MPEG movies (.mpg)
The Motion Picture Experts Group came up with this family of standards for 
moving images. Apple QuickTime, which comes with each new Mac and is 
available free for Windows, is happy to screen MPEG-1 and MPEG-4 files for 
your viewing pleasure. Apple offers an MPEG-2 Playback Component that you 
can download for about $20 from www.apple.com/quicktime/mpeg2.
A free open source alternative media player, VLC, handles all MPEG formats 
and a whole lot more. It’s available from www.videolan.org.
If you’re into video editing, see the discussion of iMovie in Chapter 13.
Music (.mp3, .aiff, .wma, and others)
The iTunes program in Windows is compatible with iTunes on the Mac, so 
if you’re using iTunes on your PC, you can transfer all the music, video, 
audiobooks, and podcasts you have accumulated. One exception is .wma 
files — Macs don’t play them without additional software. Inexpensive 
solutions you can download are available from Flip4mac.com and 
easywma.com. You can also import any music or other sound files that are 
in .mp3 format (MP3). You can also import files in .aiff or .wav format. 
However, your Mac cannot play files in Microsoft PlaysForSure (.pfs) or 
Zune format. These files use a digital rights management technique that isn’t 
compatible with the Apple FairPlay system.
 
You have a number of ways to transfer your iTunes music library from a PC to 
a Mac. You can simply copy all the files from the Music\iTunes folder on your 
PC over to the Music folder on the Mac and then choose File➪Import within 
iTunes. Apple recommends that you use the Backup to Disc feature in iTunes. 
You need a CD burner or, better yet, a DVD burner on your PC. See support.

 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
ASCII text (.txt) and rich text format 
(.rtf) files
Text files are supposed to be as simple as anything gets in computers. 
They’re just a bunch of characters in American Standard Code for Information 
Interchange (ASCII) encoding. Unfortunately, even these files aren’t so simple. 
The three different operating system families — Windows, Unix, and Mac OS — 
use different conventions for ending a line, or paragraph, of text. Unix uses a 
line-feed (LF) character, Mac OS 9 used a carriage return (CR), and Windows 
uses both (CR+LF).
Digital rights management — curse or blessing?
A popular form of entertainment on the Internet 
is trolling, or mentioning a hot-button topic in a 
discussion group and watching the heated con-
troversy erupt. Few topics are more effective as 
troll bait than digital rights management (DRM), 
which is seen as either an enabling technology 
that allows music and movies to be enjoyed 
by way of the Internet, or as an evil, danger-
ous technology that allows all information to be 
centrally controlled by powerful interests. Both 
viewpoints have merit.
The rights that DRM manages are the rights that 
copyright law gives to content owners. When it 
works, DRM encrypts content and then allows 
decryption only on the computer or player that 
the copyright holder authorizes. DRM can also 
restrict the number and quality of copies made 
and the number of times content can be viewed. 
Providers of Blu-ray high-definition video are 
insisting that all computers that will show such 
content implement strict DRM.
Anti-DRM activists are concerned that the 
technology gives content creators too much 
power. Apple has switched from its own DRM 
system, FairPlay, which was relatively benign, 
to selling DRM-free music on its iTunes music 
store. (Apple calls DRM-free music iTunes 
Plus.) You can even unlock past purchases for 
a small fee. But movies and iPhone applications 
still use DRM.
Apple president Steve Jobs called for an end to 
DRM music in February 2007, saying “Imagine a 
world where every online store sells DRM-free 
music encoded in open licensable formats. In 
such a world, any player can play music pur-
chased from any store, and any store can sell 
music which is playable on all players. This is 
clearly the best alternative for consumers, and 
Apple would embrace it in a heartbeat.” Check 
out the rest of his comments at www.apple.
com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic.

138
Part II: Making the Switch 
The TextEdit program that comes with OS X reads text files created by 
Windows, Unix, and Mac OS. However, by default, it saves files in rich text 
format (.rtf), which, among other things, preserves basic formatting of 
text. You can change the default settings to text format in the TextEdit 
Preferences.
Transferring your e-mail address book
If you’re using an online e-mail service such as Yahoo! or Gmail, you don’t 
need to do anything — your address book is stored on the mail service’s 
servers and you can access it just as well from your Mac.
If you’re using Outlook Express, you can transfer the addresses by using 
vCard records. To do this, prepare a new folder on your external hard drive 
or flash drive. You can call it Outlook Addresses. Start Outlook Express and 
choose Tools➪Address Book. Choose Edit➪Select All. Drag all addresses to 
the folder you created. You can then import them into the Apple Mail program 
(see Chapter 8). I discuss moving your AOL address book in Chapter 8.
Purging Your Files Before 
Disposing of the Disk
When you’re satisfied that you have all your files safely moved to your Mac 
and backed up, it’s time to remove from your PC hard drive any data that you 
may not want others to see. It can include e-mail, personal correspondence, 
proprietary work documents, and financial information. Sensitive informa-
tion, including credit card numbers and passwords, may be stored in your 
computer without your knowing about it, in the form of temporary cache files 
and cookies. Cookies are blocks of information that your Internet browser 
often stores so that Web sites you revisit know about your past usage.
The simplest solution is to erase everything on the PC’s hard drive. Doing 
so makes your computer much less usable if you decide to sell or donate it, 
however. If you still have the original discs that came with the computer, you 
can restore the operating system after you erase. You can also restore any 
applications you own.
Alternatively, you can just erase the data files you’re concerned about. The 
My Documents folder is an obvious candidate, but you must also check to 
see where other files may be stored. This approach is more risky, and I 
recommend it only if you’re planning to give the computer to another family 
member or someone else you trust.

139
 Chapter 6: Moving Files from Your PC to the Mac
Removing the hard drive
A third approach, and perhaps the safest one, is to simply remove the hard 
drive before you dispose of your PC. This is relatively easy for a tower PC, 
but more tricky for a laptop. You can pay a technician at a computer store 
to do this for you. Of course, the computer will be much less usable without 
a hard drive, although it can still be used with a Knoppix CD, as previously 
described. If the machine is reasonably current, it may be worth it for the 
next owner to install a new, perhaps larger, hard drive. These drives are 
relatively inexpensive.
You can simply keep the old hard drive in a safe place, or you can ask the 
technician who removes it from your PC to install it in a portable hard drive 
enclosure. See “More extreme measures,” earlier in this chapter.
Wiping data off your hard drive
Safely removing files from your PC isn’t just a simple matter of deleting them. 
When Microsoft Windows deletes files, it only removes information about 
those files from its file directory and makes the space on the hard drive 
available for reuse. It doesn’t erase the data itself. Programs are available 
that can often recover deleted files if they haven’t been erased. Even if a file 
has been erased once on older hard drives of less that 15GB capacity, it’s 
sometimes possible to recover data by using highly specialized equipment. 
However, according to the U.S. National Institute of Science and Technology, 
“most of today’s media can be effectively cleared by one overwrite.” You can 
use the following programs to overwrite your data one or more times:
 
✓ SDelete: Microsoft suggests using this free command-line program. You 
can see instructions and a download link at
www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/utilities/
SDelete.mspx
 
✓ Eraser: This program is also free, although a donation is suggested to 
help support the author. You can download it at
www.heidi.ie/eraser
 
✓ Darik’s Boot And Nuke: You burn this free program to a self-contained 
boot disk. It also works with Macs. You can download it at www.dban.org.
 
Mac OS X has a built-in file-wiping utility. When you drag files to the Trash, 
you can choose Secure Empty Trash from the Finder menu. In addition, the OS 
X Disk Utility can erase all your free space, so you can get rid of any files you 
didn’t securely erase.

140
Part II: Making the Switch 
Safely destroying your PC hard drive
 
Perhaps you don’t want to or can’t reuse your PC’s hard drive but simply 
want to destroy it. Maybe it’s so far gone that you can’t access it with any 
program but you know it contains sensitive data that someone with the right 
tool and a big budget could still get at. You have a bit of a problem. It’s hard to 
dispose of it in a truly safe and environmentally friendly way. The most widely 
recommended ways include melting, incineration, crushing, or shredding — 
yes, shredding. Some companies offer this service.
Perhaps the simplest solution is to erase it as best you can, remove it from 
the PC, and take it apart. You need some small screwdrivers, and often a 
screw or two is hidden under a label. The process is instructive, though, and 
you find some neat, powerful magnets inside. Simply bending the disks renders 
them essentially unreadable. (Some newer disks — generally more than 
50GB — are made of glass and may shatter, so pick a safe location and 
wear eye protection.) Figure 6-2 shows a disassembled hard drive with an 
ordinary claw hammer used to bend the platters. The super magnets are in 
the upper-left corner of the hard drive case. Be careful with them; they’re 
strong enough to pinch.

T
he Mac OS X, from Apple, comes with an amazing collection of software 
programs to help you create and enjoy what Apple refers to as your 
digital life: music, photos, home movies, and Web content. They’re so useful 
that I devote Chapters 11 through 14 to telling you more about them. I also 
cover the quite capable word processor TextEdit later in this chapter. The 
programs in the iLife suite and the chapters that cover them are described in 
this list in the order I cover them:
 
✓ iTunes: Manages your music and videos, syncs with your iPod, and talks 
to the online iTunes Store. (See Chapter 11.)
 
✓ iPhoto: Takes care of everything associated with digital photography, 
including retrieving images from your digital camera, performing basic 
editing, organizing images into slide shows and albums, and printing 
albums. (See Chapter 12.)
 
✓ iMovie: Lets you import and edit all those home movies you took 
of your vacations and kids (but never watch) and turn them into 
professional-looking mini-biopics that won’t bore your guests. They 
might even garner 15 minutes of fame on YouTube. In your work life, 
you can produce video clips that compellingly present your ideas. (See 
Chapter 13.)
 
✓ iDVD: Burns those edited iMovie shorts and epics (along with iPhoto 
slide shows) to DVDs that you can play on almost any DVD player or 
computer with a DVD reader. Make the grandparents very happy. (See 
Chapter 13.)

142
Part II: Making the Switch  
 
✓ GarageBand: Helps you put together the original score for the home 
video epic or just fan your long-suppressed creative musical talents. 
Also use it to record podcasts and learn to play guitar or piano. 
(See Chapter 13.)
 
✓ iWeb: Builds all this creative output into spectacular Web pages. 
(See Chapter 14.)
Because all these programs are built by Apple, using the OS X toolbox, they 
all work well together. You can use an iTunes playlist as a background for 
your iPhoto slide show. You can integrate iPhoto images into your iMovie, 
animating the images by using cinematographic techniques popularized by 
Ken Burns. Your creations can also extend beyond your Mac. You can carry 
your digital works on your iPod and iPhone or show them on your home 
entertainment center using Apple TV.
Although Apple emphasizes the personal use of these products, they have 
obvious business uses as well: organizing slide shows for presentations, 
presenting sales and training videos, and creating less-boring Web sites.
 
You don’t need to worry about installing iLife. It’s on your Mac already, in 
your Applications folder, with shortcuts on the Dock. There’s nothing extra to 
do. Sorry.
Although iLife covers many needs, you may have applications on your PC 
that you use regularly or need occasionally that don’t have direct equivalents 
among the programs included with OS X. In the rest of this chapter, I guide 
you through the more common situations and point you to additional 
resources for others.
Keeping Your Appointments with iCal
OS X comes with the sophisticated calendar program iCal. You find it on the 
Dock, represented by an icon that looks like a desk calendar open to today’s 
date. (Does anyone even remember what a desk calendar looked like?) It 
supports multiple calendars (for example, work, personal, and rule-the-world 
conspiracy) and offers daily, weekly, and monthly views of your schedule. 
Apple iCal is based on the iCalendar standard, which is supported by many 
other calendaring systems, including Microsoft Outlook.
You can move your Outlook calendar to your Mac by following these steps:
 
1. Export your Outlook calendar in iCalendar format using the free tool 
available at outlook2ical.sourceforge.net.
 
2. Move the resulting .ics file to your Mac.

143
 Chapter 7: Switching Applications
 
 Chapter 6 explains all sorts of ways to move files from your PC to 
your Mac.
 
3. Import your Outlook calendar into iCal by selecting File➪Import.
Synchronizing with Entourage is also supported, as is using the older 
.vcs files. If you have a MobileMe account, you can keep your calendars 
constantly in sync with all your Apple toys and with your desktop, laptop, 
iPhone, iPod touch, and even your PC.
iCal works with other calendaring systems that support the CalDAV standard 
to let you check your colleagues’ availability, arrange meetings with them, 
and book a conference room with a projector and party hats. You send 
everyone meeting material by simply dragging the document icon or icons to 
the event in the iCal window.
Processing Words and Numbers
Once upon a time, in the dim ages of the past century, people who wanted 
to produce a written document for other people to read sat down in front 
of a mechanical contraption, called a typewriter, that was filled with levers 
connected to keys arranged in much the same way as the keys on a computer 
keyboard. Writers checked their spelling by looking up words in a paper book.
Today, it would be considered a form of abuse to make someone write without 
the aid of a good word processor. If you’re working with other people in most 
organizations, you’re pretty much expected to read and produce documents 
in a format compatible with Microsoft Office — particularly Microsoft Word.
The need for Microsoft Office compatibility complicates what would 
otherwise be a clean, bare-knuckle-competitive relationship between Apple 
and Microsoft. Apple needs Office, and Microsoft makes good money selling 
it to Mac users. Bill Gates once half-joked that he made more money when 
Apple sold a Mac than when a Windows PC was sold, because Mac users 
were more likely to buy Office.
Many word processing solutions work with a Macintosh, ranging from the 
software that comes free with OS X to the full Microsoft Office for Mac suite 
to a number of other possibilities.
 
Although most word processing programs can open documents in certain 
older formats, if you have documents that have been around a long time or 
were created using obsolete applications, you may not be able to read them 
directly from the standard Mac office suites that I describe in the following 
sections. MacLinkPlus, found at www.dataviz.com, converts numerous older 
types of documents (it goes back as far as WordPerfect DOS 5.0) to modern 
formats. See the DataViz Web site for a complete list: www.dataviz.com.

144
Part II: Making the Switch  
TextEdit
The humble word processor included with OS X, TextEdit, is quite powerful, 
with many more features than its Windows equivalent, Notepad. You find 
TextEdit in the Applications folder. In particular, TextEdit can read and 
save documents produced by Microsoft Word 97, 2003, and 2007. Although 
TextEdit reads ASCII text files generated in Windows, UNIX, Linux, and Mac 
OS, unless you change its preferences, it doesn’t save files in ASCII text 
format, for reasons discussed in the previous chapter. Instead, TextEdit 
normally saves files in rich text format, .rtf, a relatively simple format for 
styled documents that was introduced by Microsoft in 1987. TextEdit can 
also read and save documents in HyperText Markup Language (HTML), 
Microsoft Word (.doc), Microsoft Extensible Markup Language (XML), Open 
Office XML, and OpenDocument formats. It can also produce PDF documents 
by using its Print command.
TextEdit supports character formatting and the inclusion of graphics and 
multimedia images. Some of its more powerful features can be a little hard to 
find. For example, to make and edit tables, you choose Format➪Text➪Table. 
Choose Format➪Text to find more list management features. TextEdit allows 
sophisticated control of letter spacing and even speaks text aloud, but it 
doesn’t support multicolumn documents. Its simple editing screen, shown in 
Figure 7-1, understates its capabilities.
 
Figure 7-1: 
The simple

TextEdit has full support for Unicode, a computer industry standard character 
set that includes the written characters of most of the languages now used in 
the world — and a few ancient ones, such as Linear B. (See Chapter 5 for more 
information on keying in special characters and other languages.) A committee 
is studying the addition of Egyptian hieroglyphs to Unicode. In the meantime, 
you can purchase the glyph processor MacScribe 2.1 at www.macscribe.
com. The site is in French, but if you understand Egyptian hieroglyphics, you 
probably speak French, too.

145
 Chapter 7: Switching Applications
 
If you want to edit HTML files in TextEdit, choose TextEdit➪Preferences and 
select the Ignore Rich Text Commands in HTML Files check box. You also see 
this option for a particular file when you choose File➪Open.
Word and Office from Microsoft
Microsoft Word and the other Microsoft Office applications (Excel for 
spreadsheets and PowerPoint for presentations) are the most widely used 
standards in most workplaces and schools. Microsoft sells versions of these 
programs for the Mac. If you frequently need to use files created by these 
programs, buying Word or the entire Office suite may be a wise investment. 
Microsoft Office 2008 is file-compatible with Office 2007 for Windows.
You can buy Microsoft Word, shown in Figure 7-2, by itself, or you can 
buy the entire Office suite, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and 
Entourage, a Mac program similar to Outlook in Windows but with somewhat 
different features. I discuss Entourage a bit more in Chapter 8.
Microsoft Office is pricey, especially if you aren’t upgrading from a previous 
version and don’t qualify for the Home & Student version. As mentioned 
previously, TextEdit, which comes with OS X, can open files in Microsoft 
Word (.doc) format. You have other alternatives if you want full independence 
from the Redmond empire.
 
If you’re planning to install Microsoft Windows on your Mac and you need to 
work with Office documents only occasionally, one approach is to install the 
Windows version of Office in Windows and use it there. If you use the virtual 
technologies for installing Windows, the Office applications can be used 
alongside Mac applications. You can also use the CrossOver Mac program 
from CodeWeavers.com (www.codeweavers.com). It runs the Windows 
versions of Office 97, Office 2000, and Office 2003 on your Mac without installing 
Windows. The CodeWeaver approach isn’t always perfect, however. See 
Chapter 16 for more on all these options. But if you’re planning heavy use of 
Office, you’ll be happier installing the Mac version. Get with the program, 
program.
 
Note that Microsoft Office 2008 doesn’t support Visual Basic for Applications 
(VBA). If your life depends on VBA, you might want to get hold of a copy of the 
older Office 2004 (try eBay). A version of Basic that runs on the Mac is available 
from www.realbasic.com, or you can use AppleScript, which Office 2008 
supports. OpenOffice.org 3.0, which I’m about to tell you about, has limited 
support for VBA and runs many Office macros.

OpenOffice.org
OpenOffice.org is a suite of office applications developed by the open source 
community that largely parallels the capabilities of Microsoft Office. The 
program can generally read and write files in the various Microsoft formats, 
but is most comfortable with OpenDocument format. Oh, and it’s open 
source and free.
OpenOffice.org says that it appends the .org suffix to its name because 
someone else owns the OpenOffice trademark. The program can be used on 
a variety of computing platforms besides the Macintosh, including Windows, 
Linux, and most other forms of Unix. OpenOffice.org consists of these 
components:
 
✓ Base: A relational database management system
 
✓ Calc: A spreadsheet
 
✓ Draw: A vector graphics drawing program
 
✓ Impress: A presentation program, similar to PowerPoint
 
✓ Write: A word processor

147
 Chapter 7: Switching Applications
OpenOffice.org 3.0 runs on the Mac using the normal OS X user interface. 
(Earlier versions employed X11, a windowing system developed years ago at 
MIT.) To install it, follow these steps:
 
1. Point your Web browser to http://download.openoffice.org and 
click the Download Openoffice.org link.
 
2. While the installation image is being downloaded, OpenOffice asks 
you for a voluntary donation.
 
 Be nice and give up some money — the software is quite a good deal. 
You can also look at the large library of available extensions and try 
versions of OpenOffice still under development, though I suggest that 
you stay away from the latter. Downloading experimental software voids 
the warranty on this book — oh, right, we’re not offering a warranty.
 
3. After the installation image has downloaded, double-click it (it’s in 
your Downloads folder) and drag the OpenOffice.org icon into the 
Applications folder.
 
 A screen shot of OpenOffice.org displaying a draft of this chapter, stored 
as a Microsoft Word document, is shown in Figure 7-3.
All in all, OpenOffice.org is a powerful program. In the previous edition of 
this book, which covered the older, X11 version of OpenOffice.org, I said 
it was an excellent example of both the strengths and weaknesses of open 
source software. I’m not sure that the new Mac-friendly version exhibits 
many weaknesses.

Part II: Making the Switch  
iWork
The Apple program iWork includes Pages, a word processing program; 
Numbers, a spreadsheet program; and Keynote, a presentation program. All 
are quite impressive.
Pages
Pages incorporates many of the features of a page-layout program. You don’t 
just type and format text with pages — you create finished documents ready 
for printing or display on the World Wide Web or as PDF files. For example, 
check out these features:
 
✓ Charts: Pages has three-dimensional charting capabilities, with the 
ability to rotate the chart image in 3D mode to create exactly the effect 
you want.
 
✓ Image editing and page layout: You can edit images in Pages; you don’t 
need to jump back and forth to an image editor for image adjustments. 
You can crop images to arbitrary shapes that you create in Pages and 
flow text around them. And, Pages comes with a set of templates that 
Apple has designed to give your documents a professional look.
 
 Nearly everything can be edited in real time.
 
✓ Mailings: Pages can do mail merges, even using your address book or 
a spreadsheet table in Numbers to create personalized mailings and 
newsletters.
 
✓ Organizational tools: Outline mode lets you create a multilevel outline 
that you can quickly reorganize by dragging and dropping. To help with 
long documents, Pages shows detailed color thumbnail images for every 
page in the left sidebar of your screen.
 
✓ Tables and calculations: Pages can create tables that perform simple 
calculations, such as addition, multiplication, and averaging.
Pages can read and export Microsoft Word, HTML, RTF, and text-only files 
from the Mac or PC. It even supports Apple’s older AppleWorks format. Pages 
does a good job of retaining the formatting of documents it imports, including 
Word revision tracking. It also works with the popular MathType and 
EndNote programs for adding math equations and bibliographic references, 
though you need to buy the latest Mac versions of these programs.
Numbers
The world runs on spreadsheets, but they’re kind of boring. Apple adds 
pizzazz with a flexible canvas on which you can place intelligent tables, 3D 
charts and graphs, text, pictures, and whatever. Canned templates and lots 

149
 Chapter 7: Switching Applications
of small touches, such as one-click formulas and Formula List view, make 
Numbers easy for non-bean-counters to use. Don’t worry: It can read and 
write most Excel files.
Keynote
Keynote is Apple’s attempt to one-up Microsoft PowerPoint, which has 
become the primary means of business communications in the 21st century. 
In a joke about two kidnapped businesspeople about to be executed who 
are offered a last request, the first person asks whether he can finally give 
the presentation he had been working on before his capture. The second 
person asks to be killed first so that he doesn’t have to sit through one more 
PowerPoint presentation.
Keynote is designed to make it easy to create killer presentations that don’t 
bore the audience to death. Apple president Steve Jobs claims that he is 
Keynote’s prime customer, and that he demands ever-improved features for 
his numerous presentations. Keynote has a dizzying array of special effects, 
transitions, slide builds, animation tools, and templates. It also calls on tools 
from Pages and the iLife suite to simplify slide creation so that you can have 
tables that update when you change the numbers and 3D charts that you 
can rotate. You can also export Keynote presentations in PowerPoint format 
(.ppt), but some of the cooler effects may not translate fully.
 
Always be sure to preview your presentation on the computer, the program, 
the projector, and, if possible, the room you will use when your audience 
shows up. Put your presentation on automatic play and sit in the back of the 
room to see how legible those slides are from that vantage.
Web-based office applications
In a major new trend in computing, Web sites are offering software applications, 
either free or for a subscription fee. All you need to use them is a computer 
with a reasonably modern Web browser. You don’t have to download any 
software. You sign up for the service and access the document and the 
programs you need to create and then edit them over the Internet. It works 
a lot like Web-based e-mail, and it’s no surprise that one of the foremost 
vendors of this type of service is Google, but others have gotten in the act as 
well. Here’s a quick looks at the pros and cons of Web-based apps:
 
✓ The upside: A special advantage is that you can access documents 
stored on the Web site from any computer, anywhere you find an 
Internet connection. Your documents are password-protected, of 
course, but most sites have a way for you to share documents with 
colleagues and work on them collaboratively.

150
Part II: Making the Switch  
 
✓ The downside: Obviously, you cannot work when you’re out of range 
of an Internet connection — say, when traveling with your laptop. Also, 
you need to have a fast Internet connection, and even then, response 
times can be slow compared to desktop programs.
Google Docs & Spreadsheets
Google offerings include a word processor and a spreadsheet. If you have a 
Google account and password for Gmail, groups, or another Google service, 
you simply log on to use Docs & Spreadsheets. Otherwise, you can register 
for a new account with little effort. All Google requires is your e-mail address. 
Even your full name is optional. Docs & Spreadsheets lets you
 
✓ Create or upload documents: They’re stored on Google’s servers. You 
can also upload documents in Microsoft Office .doc and .xls formats, 
as well as .rtf, OpenDocument, and of course, plain-text formats.
 
✓ Share a document with other people: Enter someone’s e-mail address 
and that person receives an e-mail invitation and can see and edit your 
document as soon as sign-in is complete. Multiple people can view and 
edit a document at the same time. The spreadsheet program even has a 
chat window, allowing all the editors to discuss what they’re up to.
 
✓ Track changes to a document: You can see who made changes, when 
the changes were made, and what was changed.
 
✓ Store, download, or post the final document: When you’re done, you 
can leave the document on the Google server. You can also download 
the document to your Mac in a variety of formats, including .csv, .doc, 
.html, .ods, .odt, .pdf, .rtf, and .xls. You can also publish your 
document on the Web in .html format.

uploaded to Google in Microsoft Word .doc format. Figure 7-5 shows a 
simple Google spreadsheet.
Other online office applications
A number of other Web sites are offering online office applications; this list 
describes a few:
 
✓ EditGrid: This online spreadsheet program has strong collaboration 
features. It’s free for personal use and requires a monthly fee for 
businesses. See whether you can guess its Web address.
 
✓ ThinkFree: ThinkFree.com (www.thinkfree.com) offers Write, 
for word processing; Calc, a spreadsheet program; and Show, for 
presentations.
 
✓ Zoho: Zoho Virtual Office includes word processing, spreadsheets, and 
presentations. It’s available free for individuals at www.zohox.com. 
Business users pay a small monthly fee and get a few additional features.

Personal finance
If you use Quicken or QuickBooks in Windows, you’ll be glad to know that 
versions of these programs are available for the Mac from Intuit.com. It’s 
possible to transfer records between the Windows and Mac versions of these 
programs, but the process isn’t perfect and some types of data don’t get 
converted. You can find full information at www.intuit.com/support. 
Select the product you are interested and enter “converting to Mac” in the 
search box. I’d advise waiting until the end of your accounting year to change 
from the PC version of a program you depend on to the Mac version, or just 
keep running the PC version you already use under Windows on your Mac. 
(See Chapter 16.)
MYOB sells another popular line of accounting packages that work on both 
platforms. (www.myob-us.com) You’ll find other business and finance 
applications for your Mac at www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/

Part II: Making the Switch  
Accessing Databases
The only major application missing from Microsoft Office for the Macintosh 
is Access, the Office database component. Not only is Access not supported 
on the Mac, but Microsoft also doesn’t make it easy to transfer Access 
databases to other systems. Your simplest option is to export Access tables 
as Excel files on your PC and then import those data tables into whichever 
database solution you choose on the Mac. You have to reconstruct any 
relations, forms, or queries on the Mac side. The following sections describe 
the main database alternatives available on the Mac, from simple to more 
complex and esoteric.
Bento
Bento is an inexpensive ($49) consumer- and small business-oriented database 
program from FileMaker, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Apple. Its name 
alludes to the tidy, compartmented bento boxes used to serve assortments 
of Japanese delicacies (yum). Bento is well integrated with standard OS X 
applications, such as Address Book, iCal, and Mail as well as Numbers and 
Microsoft Excel. And there’s a $5 version of Bento for the iPhone and iPod 
touch that syncs with the Mac version. Although you can easily configure 
Bento to your own database needs (if they’re not too complex), it comes 
with a wide variety of preformatted and themed database templates — from 
Animal Stats to Wine Collection. Small-office templates include Customers, 
Inventory, Issue Tracking, and Time Billing. No programming or configuring 
needed; just enter your data.
FileMaker
FileMaker is a full-featured, commercial database program, also (duh) from 
FileMaker, Inc. Considered one of the better database programs out there, it 
has a loyal following. It’s easy to use (for a database) and has many powerful 
features. FileMaker is also available in a Windows version, and the two versions 
can be networked, allowing databases to be shared between users employing 
both platforms. The .fp7 database format is the same on both platforms, but 
differing fonts can sometimes cause problems if you don’t stick to OpenType 
fonts or the Windows TrueType fonts on both platforms. FileMaker is suitable 
for a range of applications from small and simple to large and complex, with 
Web-based access. If you add ODBC-compliant drivers, it can interact with 
Microsoft Access data. A strong community of FileMaker developers exists. 
FileMaker Pro costs about $300, and numerous add-ons are available, including 

153
 Chapter 7: Switching Applications
FileMaker Server, FileMaker Advanced, and FileMaker Server Advanced. A 
server version is even available for Linux. FileMaker provides the following 
white paper that compares its database to Access:
www.filemaker.com/downloads/pdf/fm_access_comparison.pdf
MySQL
This multiuser, Web-oriented database powers some of the most famous 
sites on the Internet, such as Craigslist.org classified ads, Flickr.com photo 
sharing, and the Wikipedia.org free online encyclopedia. The Mac OS X server 
edition comes with MySQL built in. Using MySQL requires programming 
skills and is significantly beyond the level of Microsoft Access. For more info 
on this powerful tool, see PHP & MySQL For Dummies, 3rd Edition, by Janet 
Valade (Wiley Publishing).
OpenOffice Base
The Base component of OpenOffice.org is a relational database written in 
the Java programming language. Its look and feel mimic Access, but it has 
limited ability to import and export database files, and then only in the 
Windows version. See the following Web page for details:
wiki.services.openoffice.org/wiki/Connecting_to_Microsoft_
Access
Base, a relatively new open source project, is still being improved. It’s free 
with the rest of the OpenOffice.org suite. It’s worth playing with or trying out 
on small projects. Future releases may be more suitable for mission-critical 
stuff.
Finding Graphics and Design Programs
Many people use graphics and design programs for personal and professional 
uses, and the market leaders in each category have versions for both 
Windows and the Mac, with good compatibility between them. For the most 
part, all that’s involved in switching is getting hold of a Mac version of the 
program in question. Check with each vendor to see whether switching to the 
Mac version entitles you to the upgrade price or other discounts.

154
Part II: Making the Switch  
Graphics editing
Basic graphics editing capabilities are built into the Apple iLife suite (see 
Chapter 12), including the ability to crop images, adjust brightness and 
contrast, and remove the red-eye effect that sometimes appears when taking 
pictures of people while using flash illumination. Apple’s Aperture (see 
Chapter 12), a professional photographer’s program, provides still more. 
Still, these programs don’t match the capabilities of top-of-the-line graphics 
editors.
The Adobe Photoshop graphics editor has altered the meaning of photography 
from being a way to capture reality to a way to make an image of anything 
imaginable. My favorite example of the sophistication of this program is a 
wrinkle-removal feature that includes a slider so that you can adjust how 
many wrinkles to remove. It lets you make a portrait subject look just a bit 
younger — but not so much as to strain credulity. Photoshop is available in 
Mac and Windows editions that share underlying .psd file types. The CS3 
and CS4 versions of Photoshop have native support of Intel.
Photoshop Elements, Photoshop’s less expensive sibling, also has file 
compatible versions for both platforms, as do most of the members of the 
Adobe family. Although not as capable as Photoshop, Elements can meet 
the needs of many amateur photographers and is much less expensive than 
Photoshop. It is often included free with products such as scanners.
The GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a free, open source 
graphics-editing program with many, but not all, of the capabilities of 
Photoshop. GIMP requires the X11 window manager, which comes with 
OS X. (A limited version named Seashore, at seashore.sourceforge.net, 
which uses the OS X window manager, is available). Because it runs under 
X11, the GIMP user interface, shown in Figure 7-6, is more Windows-like 
than Mac-like. In particular, menus are associated with each window, and 
keyboard shortcuts use the Control key rather than the Ô key that you 
expect with OS X native programs So, in Gimp, Ctrl-X means “cut” and Ctrl-V 
means “paste,” for example,.
GIMP is one of the most mature open source programs, with a wide following 
and much Internet support. For example, visit www.ghuj.com for a large 
collection of GIMP tutorials. GIMP handles a wide variety of image formats 
and allows editing by layers and individual color channels. If your budget 
is limited and you need more image-manipulation capabilities than the iLife 
suite provides, GIMP is worth a try before you spend lots of money on brand 
P (Photoshop). You can find more info at www.gimp.org. If you want to give 
it a try, download the Mac application bundle for GIMP, available at gimp-
app.sourceforge.net. Open the disk image for the application bundle and 
drag GIMP to your Applications folder. When you start GIMP, it automatically 
starts the X11 window system. When you quit Gimp, you still must separately 
quit the X11 system.

GraphicConverter, found at www.lemkesoft.com, is an extremely handy 
shareware program that has long been a part of the Macintosh universe. It 
includes a number of image-editing tools, and even accepts many Photoshop-
compatible plug-ins, allowing a variety of special effects. But its best attribute 
is its ability to import some 200 different file formats and save in 80 formats. 
It’s well worth the $35 shareware fee.
Page-layout programs
Desktop publishing was born on the Macintosh, taking advantage of Apple’s 
introduction to the industry of a high-resolution, what-you-see-is-what-you-
get (WYSIWYG) display, a graphical interface, and laser printing. Even in 
corporations that have standardized on the Windows operating system, Macs 
are plentiful in the graphics design department. As mentioned previously, 
Apple’s Pages program provides many tools for high-quality page layout 
and may be all you need if you’re not a professional designer. But Pages is 
no threat to the top two programs the industry uses: Adobe InDesign and 
QuarkXPress. Both programs have a long and strong association with the 
Mac platform. QuarkXPress started on the Mac, and InDesign traces its lineage 
to PageMaker, also a Mac-first program. Both are strongly supported on the 
Mac, and file transfer is generally straightforward. In fact, Quark uses the 
same application on both platforms.
Adobe also sells the document-processing program FrameMaker, often used 
for high-end technical documentation. However, the current version isn’t 
available for OS X, so if you need it, run it in Windows on your Mac.

156
Part II: Making the Switch  
Replacing Specialized Programs
Some software categories still exist for which the market leader doesn’t offer 
an equivalent program that runs on Macs. Also, some companies expect 
their employees to use programs developed by that company’s information 
technology (IT) department that run only in Microsoft Windows. The simple 
answer to these situations is to install Windows on your Mac, a process I 
discuss in detail in Chapter 16. In some of these software categories, you 
find some quality Mac programs that are worth switching to. And, more IT 
departments are replacing their internal applications with software that can 
be accessed from any Web browser.
Computer-aided design
In the early 1970s, when industry first began to use computer-aided design (CAD) 
systems to replace old-fashioned drafting boards, the software ran on 16-bit mini-
computers with 
1⁄1000 the speed and 
1⁄10,000 the memory of a low-end Mac. Those 
systems cost a couple hundred thousand dollars per seat, back when a single 
family home cost less than $50,000. Modern CAD programs run on standard 
personal computers but are still pricey, often costing more than the computers 
they run on. The most popular CAD program now on the market is probably 
AutoCAD, from Autodesk. Autodesk doesn’t sell a Mac version of AutoCAD.
However, several CAD programs for the Mac are well reviewed and can 
exchange .dwg files with AutoCAD. Some players in this field include 
ArchiCAD, BOA, CADintosh, CADtools, DenebaCAD, MacDraft, PowerCADD, 
TurboCAD, VectorWorks, and Vellum Draft.
In addition, Google offers Google SketchUp (sketchup.google.com), which 
can meet many design needs. Check out Google SketchUp 7 For Dummies, by 
Aidan Chopra (Wiley Publishing) for help getting started with this program. 
Another option is OmniGraffle from www.omnigroup.com — it’s a really nice 
alternative to Visio. The Web site www.architosh.com has reviews and 
other information for people, especially architects, who want to work with 
CAD on the Mac.
Share the wealth
Many of the most creative ideas in personal 
computers come for individual developers who 
distribute their products as shareware. Most let 
you try their program for free, simply asking for 
a modest payment if you choose to keep using 
the program. Some distribute programs as free-
ware, possibly asking for a donation from those 
so motivated. So do the right thing and pay up 
when these programs save your butt!

 Chapter 7: Switching Applications
GPS navigation
The global positioning system (GPS) has revolutionized navigation. Adding 
GPS to a laptop can enable any number of innovative applications, from 
vehicle navigation (cars, boats, planes, and even balloons) to collecting 
survey data. For a long time, GPS receiver manufacturers supported only 
the PC. In 2006, Garmin, a leading brand, announced plans to fully support 
Mac users. Mac GPS software is also available at www.gpsy.com and www.
macgpspro.com.
You also need a GPS receiver. Many GPS units communicate using a serial 
protocol. This can often be accommodated using a serial-to-USB adapter, 
but it typically means keeping track of two cables. Newer GPS receivers use 
USB or even Bluetooth. Both are better for Mac use, and Bluetooth is ideal 
because no cable is required.
Voice dictation
“Take a letter.” In days of old, an executive would utter those words and a 
secretary would enter the office with a notepad in hand, ready to take down 
the boss’s words in shorthand, for later transcription on the newfangled 
typewriter.
These days, good software is available for personal computers that converts 
your speech into text and that you can edit and use with a word processor. 
The current top-rated product is Dragon NaturallySpeaking for Windows, 
from Nuance.com. Fortunately, a version of the Dragon speech-recognition 
engine, MacSpeech Dictate, is now available for OS X from MacSpeech (www.
macspeech.com). The package includes, for best performance, a headset 
with a certified, noise-canceling microphone. MacSpeech Dictate can also 
control your Mac by using voice commands. Of course, you can run the 
Nuance product under Windows on your Mac, if you already own it.
OS X has built-in speech recognition that allows you to verbally order the 
operating system around. It also has the ability to go the other way, to turn 
text into speech. I talk more about these features in Chapter 17.
Adding Functionality As You Need It
Oodles of shareware and freeware programs are out there that you can 
download to add functionality to your Mac. I recommend that you take it 
easy at first and work with your Mac pretty much as it comes out of its box. 
Explore this rich world of add-ons when you’ve grown more used to your 
Mac and have an easier time detecting when something isn’t quite right after

a program is installed. Still, I recommend making a few downloads sooner 
rather than later because they have particular relevance to easing the 
switching experience. I already mentioned GraphicConverter, the excellent 
Swiss Army knife for image formats by Lemkesoft, earlier in this chapter. The 
following sections describe a few more you might keep in mind.
Adobe Flash Player and RealPlayer
Flash and Real are two other popular multimedia formats. Both have free 
players available for OS X. Adobe Flash used to be Macromedia Flash, and 
Real used to be RealAudio. Companies like to change their names because 
it cuts down on those nasty profits by confusing consumers, so they end up 
paying less in taxes. You can download the free players from www.adobe.
com and www.real.com, respectively. Adobe has two versions, one for Intel 
Macs and the other for the older PowerPC Macs. RealPlayer can also play 
QuickTime files and offers to take over for QuickTime Player, if you let it.
Flip4Mac
Quite a bit of content on the Internet is available only as Windows Media 
files (.wma and .wmv). With Windows Media Components for QuickTime, 
by Flip4Mac, you can play these files directly in QuickTime Player as long 
as they don’t have digital rights management (DRM) restrictions. Flip4Mac 
also lets you view Windows Media content on the Internet from your 
Web browser. A free version is available from the Microsoft Mac site, 
www.microsoft.com/mac (click the Other Products link), or you can 
look for the link to the free version at flip4mac.com.
StuffIt Expander
OS X can open a variety of compressed files and archives and can do 
Zip compression (you right-click a file or folder and choose Compress 
<filename>). StuffIt Expander (www.stuffit.com), from Smith Micro 
Software, can open many more formats, including some older Mac formats 
such as .sit and .hqx. It comes free from the Web site, but you have to 
navigate past offers for more capable programs that aren’t free.

ikely the first things you want to do after your Mac is 
set up are get online and check your e-mail. Apple 
software makes it easy to accomplish these tasks — most 
of the time. But connection scenarios vary and hiccups 
happen. In this part I help you get on the air quickly. Then 
I take a closer look at the various ways you can network a 
Mac. In Chapter 10, I deal with security. Hassle-free safe 
surfing is one of the great benefits of switching to a Mac, 
but you can do some simple things to make Mac use even 
safer.
If you’re browsing in the bookstore and have no intention 
of buying a Mac or this book, at least read what I have to 
say about security in Chapter 10. The advice there can 
reduce security problems with your Windows and Internet 
use, and that’s in everyone’s interest.

G
etting a Mac online is like teaching a duck to swim: It usually comes 
naturally. If you answered all the questions during the setup process 
outlined in Chapter 4, you’re probably already online and working away. But 
if you have a problem, the solution may not be obvious.
Using Your Current Internet Account
If you have Internet service that you like, you can probably stick with it. Most 
Internet service providers (ISPs) support Macintosh users, and Macs can 
generally connect anyway with the few that say they don’t. The first thing 
is to see whether your Internet connection works. If you have a high-speed 
modem — cable, DSL, or satellite — you should be all set.
If you run into a glitch, the fixes depend on whether you’re using an Ethernet 
or a wireless connection for high-speed service. Also, if you’re using dialup or 
a service at work or school, you have different items to check. The following 
sections have the details.
 
If you’re looking to upgrade to cable, DSL, or satellite high-speed service, see 
the section “Upgrading Your Internet Service,” later in this chapter.

162
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
Checking wires on an Ethernet connection
A wired Ethernet connection uses an Ethernet networking cable that plugs 
into your computer. Ethernet cables have plastic plugs that look like the 
plugs used on telephones in North America, only fatter. (But don’t try to use 
a phone cable.) The following tips can help if you have this type of connection:
 
✓ If your high-speed modem is connected to an Ethernet router, see 
whether the router has an extra Ethernet port and run an Ethernet cable 
from it to the Ethernet port on your Mac.
 
 If you don’t have a router or switch, you should get one; they’re cheap 
enough. In the meantime, you can unplug the Ethernet cable from your 
PC and plug it into your Mac to get started.
 
✓ If your PC is connected to your high-speed modem by a USB cable — 
a rectangular metal plug — you may not be able to use that cable with 
your Mac, even though the Mac has USB ports. Check with the modem 
manufacturer to see whether it supports USB connections to OS X. If not, 
you must use an Ethernet cable.
 
 Most modems that support USB connections also have Ethernet jacks, 
but with many, you can only use one or the other, not both together. 
If you want to use the PC and your Mac but your PC doesn’t have an 
Ethernet port, you need a combined USB and Ethernet router.
Picking up Wi-Fi signals at home
If you will be using wireless Internet with your computer, life is even easier. 
Most new Macs include built-in AirPort, the name Apple uses for Wi-Fi. 
Another common name is 802.11, Wi-Fi’s very own IEEE standard number. 
The number 802.11 is followed by a letter that indicates the speed and 
frequency band supported. Macs handle them all.
All you need to use an existing Wi-Fi service is a password, and not even 
that if security isn’t enabled. See Chapter 9 for more about Wi-Fi security, 
including what to do if you forget the password you initially set up.
If you don’t already have Wi-Fi and have or plan to get an Apple laptop, 
consider buying a Wi-Fi router. It offers these benefits:
 
✓ Having one lets you use your laptop anywhere you choose to work, as 
long as it’s within range of the router’s signal.
 
✓ If your desktop installation isn’t near a phone or cable TV jack, the 
wireless capability means that you don’t need to run cables everywhere.

163
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
 
Apple sells a Wi-Fi router combined with a backup hard drive named Time 
Capsule. It has many cool features that make it worth considering as your first 
Wi-Fi base station. You can find out more about Time Capsule in Chapter 9, too.
Setting up dialup service
If you’re connecting to the Internet using an old-fashioned dialup connection — 
the kind that makes “beep-boop-beeep-wahh-wahhh” noises (often called 
whale songs) every time you connect — you need a USB dialup modem to 
continue using that connection with your Mac. New Macs don’t have built-in 
modems. Apple sells a tiny USB + dialup modem for about $50. Other USB 
dialup modems may work. Again, check with the manufacturer.
To get your dialup service to work on your new Mac, you need certain 
information, such as your account name, password, and the phone number 
your computer must dial to get connected. If you don’t have this information 
handy, and you’ve been using your PC to access your dialup account, follow 
these steps on your PC to find the information you need:
 
1. Choose Start➪Control Panel and double-click the Network 
Connections icon.
 
2. Right-click your ISP’s icon in the dialup area and select Properties 
from the context menu.
 
3. Write down the setting info you see.
 
Alternatively, just give your ISP a call and ask the folks which settings you 
need. In either case, save the paper with the dialup setting info along with 
your Mac’s manuals or write the settings in the margin here.
When you have the needed information, follow these steps to set up your 
modem on your Mac:
 
1. Plug your modem into a USB port and then plug the phone cable into 
the modem.
 
2. Select System Preferences from the Apple menu.
 
3. Click the Network icon.
 
4. Click the modem line in the sidebar.
 
5. Fill in the requested information.

164
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
Connecting at school, work, or elsewhere
If you plan to use your Mac at work or school, you will likely connect using 
that organization’s Internet service:
 
✓ If Wi-Fi is available, try selecting the school’s or company’s signal 
under the Wi-Fi icon on your Mac’s menu bar and then open your Web 
browser. A page will likely open with instructions for logging in.
 
✓ If you will be using wired Internet, look for instructions on your 
organization’s Web page or intranet from another computer, or visit 
your system administrator. Fresh-baked cookies are always welcome.
Surfing the Wi-Fi cloud
Many people who operate a Wi-Fi access point 
or router don’t turn on any security. Because the 
usable range of a Wi-Fi signal can be a couple 
of hundred feet, someone outside the premises 
of the router owner can see the access point in 
his list of available connections and may be able 
to connect by using it. Your computer may con-
nect to another available access point without 
much warning if the access point you normally 
use isn’t available. In densely populated urban 
areas, several open signals can be available 
from many locations.
A Wi-Fi connection is open because its owner 
didn’t take the extra steps necessary to turn on 
one of the encryption features included in all 
Wi-Fi access points. That can happen because 
the owner didn’t know how to turn on encryp-
tion, didn’t want to be bothered, or deliberately 
chose to leave it off, thereby inviting others to 
use it. I go over the steps necessary to secure 
your Wi-Fi connection in Chapter 9.
Open Wi-Fi access points raise questions of 
security, ethics, and legality:
 ✓ Security: If your computer is well locked 
down, and you use secure sites for activi-
ties like online banking, you have relatively 
little risk that an intruder will access your 
files through an open Wi-Fi signal — yours 
or someone else’s.
 ✓ Ethics: Advocates of open access argue 
that turning on encryption is simple enough 
that any open access point is an implicit 
invitation for use.
 ✓ Legality: Someone could use your con-
nection for a nefarious purpose and you 
might have some explaining to do to the 
authorities. Sharing your Wi-Fi connection 
with others may violate your ISP’s terms of 
service, and many jurisdictions have laws 
against unauthorized access to someone 
else’s computer.
Quite a few locales offer free Wi-Fi hotspots, 
and some municipalities have free Wi-Fi in cer-
tain neighborhoods. OS X conveniently shows 
you which access points are open in the list 
that drops down when you click the Wi-Fi icon 
in the menu bar — they’re the ones without lock 
icons. A quick check of your e-mail or being 
able to find directions to a restaurant from any 
street corner or coffeehouse is certainly handy, 
and it’s neighborly to allow that. The use of 
open Wi-Fi access is growing despite the many 
concerns raised.

165
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
Upgrading Your Internet Service
When you buy your new Mac, you may find that it’s a good time to upgrade 
your Internet service. If you’re still using dialup, check out DSL, cable, or 
satellite service. Or, maybe you just got a MacBook and want the ability to go 
online wherever you go. Whatever your reasons, the following sections help 
you get started with common Internet service upgrades.
Speeding up with DSL or cable service
If you’re using dialup or you aren’t satisfied with the service you’re using, 
now may be a good time to upgrade. If you live in an urban area, you probably 
have a choice of getting high-speed Internet service from your telephone 
company or from your cable television provider. The telephone company 
service is usually DSL (digital subscriber line), but you may encounter the 
older term asymmetric DSL (ADSL). Both cable and DSL can work quite well, 
so it’s worth checking what pricing plans and special features each one 
offers. Here are some things to remember:
 
✓ High-speed service can be more expensive than dialup, but you can 
share it with several computers and it doesn’t tie up your landline voice 
service.
 
✓ The speeds quoted by service providers are best-case speeds. Things 
can run slower at peak times of the day or when a news event draws 
many people to the Net. Also, speeds for downloading data may be 
much faster than those for uploading, such as when you send messages 
with large attachments.
 
✓ Top cable speeds are generally higher than those for DSL, but cable 
prices are usually higher as well.
 
✓ You may not be able to get DSL service if you’re too far from the tele-
phone company’s switching equipment.
 
✓ Some phone companies are installing fiber-optic lines to homes and 
businesses. These allow very high-speed connections.
 
✓ You may have a choice of buying the high-speed modem you need or 
renting it from the service provider. Find out the difference in price, 
and figure out how long it will take to pay for the modem in higher fees. 
Also consider that rented modems usually include free service if the unit 
dies, which isn’t uncommon.
 
✓ Check for package deals that bundle Internet access, television, and 
even phone service. These can be significantly cheaper than buying the 
services individually, but watch out for promotional prices that are only 
good for six months or a year. Ask what the rates will be after the pro-
motion expires.

✓ Ask whether your service provider has a phone number you can call for 
dialup access when you’re traveling.
 
✓ Ask your neighbors which Internet provider they’re using, whether they 
like it, and what their customer service experiences have been like.
 
✓ Back up your data before your installation appointment and disconnect 
the backup device. The service provider’s personnel aren’t necessarily 
computer experts and can cause unexpected problems.
Mobile Internet: Taking your 
connection with you
If you use your Mac when traveling, you can choose from a number of ways 
to access the Internet. Some involve little expense. Look for hotels that 
offer free Internet access when making travel reservations. Coffeehouses 
and public libraries often offer free Wi-Fi connections. You can also take 
advantage of the Wi-Fi cloud, described in the nearby sidebar, “Surfing the 
Wi-Fi cloud.” If you need something more dependable, you can try using a 
wide-area network (WAN) or using your cellphone as a modem.
In this section, you just skim the surface of connecting to the mobile Internet 
with your Mac. If you’re curious about all the mobile Internet has to offer 
businesspeople or the whole family, check out Mobile Internet For Dummies, 
by Michael J. O’Farrell, John R. Levine, Jostein Algroy, James Pearce, and 
Daniel Appelquist (Wiley Publishing). Also, check out free articles and videos 
that can help you get started at Dummies.com.
The Mac road-warrior kit
If you’re on the road a lot with your Mac porta-
ble, consider creating a travel kit that’s always 
ready to go. Here are some items you should 
include:
 ✓ A short (3-foot) Ethernet cable
 ✓ A cheap three-way extension cord — to 
share power outlets at airports and lamp 
sockets in hotel rooms
 ✓ An airplane MagSafe power adapter 
(available at the Apple store)
 ✓ International power adapters (use Radio 
Shack Model 273-1405 or visit the Apple 
store)
 ✓ USB flash drive loaded with backup copies 
of files you need
 ✓ Apple Ethernet adapter if you use a 
MackBook Air
 ✓ A couple of blank CD-Rs or DVD-Rs or a 
spare flash drive
 ✓ A checklist for other items you want to take, 
including your laptop and cellphone char-
gers and the serial number of your laptop

167
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
Going first class
Many cellphone service providers offer wireless wide-area networking 
(WWAN) that communicates via radio signals using a special device that 
you plug into your laptop. Wide-area service is most often used by 
businesspeople. Although this service can be pricey, you typically get 
connect-anywhere service within the provider’s coverage area. If you’re 
considering this service, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ Some WWAN radios are in ExpressCard/34 format. For these, you need 
the MacBook Pro because it’s now the only model that accepts these 
cards.
 
✓ Other WWAN radios plug into a USB port; you should be able to use 
them on any new Mac.
 
✓ Don’t get a WWAN card in PC card, PCMCIA, or ExpressCard/54 format. 
It doesn’t plug into in any Mac now sold — though you may be able to 
find a clumsy adapter that works.
 
✓ Make sure that the coverage area covers the areas you cover.
Where am I on the Internet?
The Internet has two ways of referring to a 
computer hooked up to it: A domain name is has 
several snippets of text separated by dots, as in 
www.dummies.com. The last snippet (.com, 
in this case) is the top-level domain (TLD). Other 
common TLDs include .edu for schools; .gov, 
reserved for the U.S. government because it 
invented the Internet; and .org, usually for 
not-for-profits. Two-letter TLDs are country 
codes: .us for the United States, .uk for the 
United Kingdom, .bk for Burkina Faso, and so 
on. You can find a complete list of TLDs at www.
iana.org/root-whois.
To find a computer, the inner guts of the 
Internet use a bunch of numbers known as the 
IP address. When you type a domain name into 
your browser’s address bar, the name is sent 
to special computers on the Internet, domain 
name servers, that look up the corresponding 
IP address in their databases. The common 
form of IP address (IPv4) consists of four num-
bers separated by dots, such as 123.4.56.78. 
Each number is between 0 and 255. A computer 
with full status on the Internet has a perma-
nently assigned IP address. Most individuals 
that connect through an Internet service pro-
vider are assigned one “leased” IP address 
for their entire home network. That number 
may change from time to time. Special blocks 
of IP addresses are reserved for private net-
works and are never transmitted on the public 
Internet — your router uses them for local com-
puters. A newer form of IP addressing, known 
as IPv6, has lots more numbers, so every com-
puter, cellphone, and refrigerator can have its 
own IP address. Macs can handle IPv6, but the 
system has yet to be widely adopted.

Putting your cellphone to work as a Bluetooth modem
Some cellphones can connect your Mac to the Internet — a feature called 
tethering. You don’t even need a special cable — the cellphone talks to your 
Mac using Bluetooth wireless networking. You need a cell phone with this 
capability and a cellular service provider that allows such use — some don’t 
or require additional monthly fees.
Internet from space — satellite service
If you live far from a cable or DSL Internet service and want something better 
than dialup, consider getting Internet service via satellite. Compared to other 
high-speed services, satellite Internet service can have performance problems, 
particularly with online games and Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony, because 
of the relatively long time it takes for signals to reach a satellite in a geo-
synchronous orbit and back down to Earth. Also, upload speeds are slower 
than download speeds. Despite the drawbacks, high-speed Internet service 
can make rural living feel a lot less isolated, and satellite service may well be 
worth the money if no other high-speed services are available.
The following tips can help you get started:
 
✓ A couple of variations exist, but you should look for two-way satellite 
service. It’s relatively expensive, with a high initial cost for equipment 
and high monthly usage fees.
 
✓ Professional installation is generally required at an added cost. A small 
dish antenna is mounted outside your home.
 
✓ The installer needs to place the dish in a spot with an unobstructed 
view of the southern sky — assuming that you live in the Northern 
Hemisphere.
 
✓ One satellite ISP that explicitly supports Macintosh customers is 
Skycasters.com. A Google search can find others.
Starting Up Your Web Browser
To surf the Internet, you need a browser. Most people use Internet Explorer 
as their PC browser, but you may have switched to an alternative browser, 
such as Firefox or Safari. In this section, you find out what your browser 
options are and find a quick introduction to Safari, the browser included in 
Mac OS X.

169
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
Picking a browser
In addition to Apple’s own browser, Safari, you can use Mac versions of 
several other popular browsers, including Firefox. You can download the 
following browsers for free and use with your Mac:
 
✓ Camino: www.caminobrowser.org
 
✓ Chrome: www.google.com/chrome
 
✓ Firefox: www.mozilla.com
 
✓ OmniWeb: www.omnigroup.com/applications/omniweb
 
✓ Opera: www.opera.com
 
✓ Shiira: www.shiira.jp
For the most part, the choice of browser is a matter of taste. Various Mac 
browsers interpret Internet standards in different ways. As a result, some 
Web sites don’t work with Safari but work with Firefox, for example. Opera 
has strong support of accessibility — you can use it without a mouse. Camino 
boasts speed and elegance. Shiira has excellent Japanese support.
 
I suggest that you start off using Safari, unless you already use and like the PC 
version of one of the other browsers previously listed. Consider downloading 
and installing Firefox too. It’s a chance to practice installing a Mac program, 
and you’ll have it handy if you run into a Web site that doesn’t work with 
Safari. The Firefox screen is shown in Figure 8-1.

Some Web sites and corporate intranets require Internet Explorer for 
Windows. The most common reason is that they use ActiveX controls, which 
are available only in Windows. If you need to access a Web site that depends 
on ActiveX controls, you can run Windows on your Mac or use your old 
Windows machine.
Introducing Safari
Safari is a full-featured Web browser with good support for numerous Web 
standards. It includes these features:
 
✓ Tabbed browsing
 
✓ Bookmarks set up to match the popular iTunes interface
 
✓ Built-in Google search box
 
✓ Password management using Keychain, a well-respected security system 
built into OS X
 
✓ Automatic form filler
 
✓ Pop-up ad blocker and anti-phishing feature
Safari, shown in Figure 8-2 displaying the Alliance for the Prudent Use of 
Antibiotics page, is built on WebKit, an open source Web-rendering engine. 
This computer program knows how to display the various multimedia for-
mats that the Web is built on. Apple has added much functionality to WebKit, 
and it’s being used by several other open source projects. Safari is built into 
the iPhone, and a free version is available for Windows.

 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
Setting up Safari
Safari is ready to go out of the box. You might want to adjust these settings 
to suit your needs:
 
1. Select Preferences from the Safari menu.
 
2. If you don’t see the General preferences pane, shown in Figure 8-3, 
click the General icon in the upper-left corner and select the options 
you prefer.
 
 The General pane lets you specify your home page and control where 
downloaded files are stored and how long they’re kept. You can also 
change your default browser here.
 
 Note that tabbed browsing is off by default. Click the Tabs icon and 
select the Enable Tabbed Browsing check box if you want to try this 
feature.
 
 The Open Safe Files after Downloading check box is worth remembering. 
It’s normally selected, allowing many types of multimedia to start up 
automatically after you download them. If you hear about viruses 
affecting these types of files on a Mac, deselect this check box for the 
duration of the security scare.
 
 Reach other Safari preference panes by clicking the icons at the top of 
the window.
 
3. When you’re done, close the preferences window.
The Firefox Preferences settings are similar to Safari’s.
 
Safari, Firefox, and most other browsers keep a history of the sites you’ve 
visited in the past few days. This can be handy when you want to go back to 
something interesting you saw, but it can compromise your privacy if others 
have access to your computer. The following items describe how to clear your 
history:
 
✓ In Safari, choose History➪Clear History.
 
✓ In Firefox, choose Firefox➪Preferences and click the Privacy icon. Then 
click the Clear button on the History line.

Switching Your E-Mail to Your Mac
These days, just about everyone has an e-mail address. A large part of getting 
your Mac online is transferring all your e-mail accounts and addresses.
Moving to Apple Mail
OS X comes with the good e-mail program Mail. Although other mail readers 
are available for OS X, Apple Mail has a couple of big advantages:
 
✓ It’s free and already installed.
 
✓ Apple supports it, so no finger pointing takes place if you have a 
problem and call AppleCare.
 
✓ It’s well integrated with OS X and applications that come with it, 
including Address Book, iChat, and iPhoto. You can search individual 
mail messages by using Spotlight, the OS X search tool, and you can 
easily include photos, resizing and cropping them as needed without 
leaving Mail.

173
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
I’ve long been a fan of plain-text e-mail. It’s what nature intended e-mail to 
be. But the world has gone for a more multimedia e-mail experience. Apple 
Mail leads the way with stationery templates that let you include photos, 
artwork, and fancy backgrounds in every message. You can (and should) 
have separate stationery for different purposes: personal messages, business 
correspondence, love letters, party invitations, marriage proposals, press 
releases, breakups, birth announcements, subpoenas, sympathy cards, 
classified documents, extortion notes, book proposals — the list is endless. 
Apple supplies a set of professionally designed templates to get you started. 
Figure 8-4 shows Apple Mail composing a templated message.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Apple Mail 
with a 
template.
 
Another cute Mail feature lets you send messages to yourself. Called notes, 
these reminders are integrated with the Apple calendar program, iCal, so you 
can tack a note or to-do list to an appointment or another type of event.
 
I discuss how to get the information you need to set up an e-mail account in 
Chapter 4. If you entered that information when you first turned on your Mac, 
you may already be good to go. Otherwise, Mail guides you through the process 
when you first start it up. And, if that doesn’t work, enter the information by 
selecting Preferences from the Mail menu and clicking the Accounts icon. See 
Figure 8-5.

174
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
Figure 8-5:

preferences.
 
You can move your collection of e-mail messages from your PC. Mail can 
import mailboxes created by a number of other mail systems, including 
Outlook Express, Eudora, and Mozilla Netscape.
Exchanging data with Microsoft Exchange
If you work for an organization that uses Microsoft Exchange e-mail and 
calendaring system, you should be all set. In Snow Leopard, support for 
Microsoft Exchange 2007 is built into OS-X Mail, Address Book, and iCal. 
Snow Leopard accesses your e-mail, contacts, and calendar on your 
organization’s Exchange Server using the Microsoft Exchange Web Services 
protocol. Simply select Exchange 2007 from the Account type list when 
setting up your work mail account.
Choosing Entourage (from Microsoft)
A number of other mail readers work well in OS X. I have used Eudora for 
years and am happy with it. But if you’re new to the Mac, you should stick 
with Apple’s Mail. You might also consider Entourage, the Microsoft e-mail 

175
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
and personal organizer for the Mac. Entourage is included in Microsoft Office 
for the Mac and is the Mac equivalent of Outlook in Windows. If you really 
like Outlook or have to work with a Microsoft Exchange mail server at work, 
Entourage may be a better choice. The Mail program can work with Exchange 
server and is certainly worth a try, but the one-neck-to-wring philosophy 
works against Mail here. Using a Microsoft product to connect to a Microsoft 
server may get you better support from Microsoft and your company’s IT 
department.
Using Address Book and iSync
In OS X, Address Book is a separate application. Mail and other OS X 
applications, including iChat, make use of the Address Book database of 
contacts. You can search it with Spotlight. You can sync your address book 
with cell phones via Bluetooth and with other Macs you own via MobileMe 
and the OS X iSync application. Apple’s Address Book supports industry 
standards for contact information, including vCard and IMAP. You can even 
beam contacts from a Palm device to your Mac if it has an infrared port (all 
but the Pro and Xserve).
Some mobile devices require additional third-party software to sync with 
your Mac. For example, Pocketmac.com sells software that adds support for 
the BlackBerry and Windows Pocket PC devices. It can also link Entourage on 
your Mac with a wide variety of mobile devices. Markspace.com sells iSync 
software for Palm OS, Windows Mobile, and Sony PSP.
Transferring addresses from other mail services
You’ll want to use the large collection of contact information you have 
accumulated over the years on your Mac. Different mail services often use 
proprietary formats for storing this information. Many tools are available on 
the Web that can assist you in moving your contacts.
Transferring your Outlook Express addresses
Fortunately, Outlook Express addresses are relatively easy to transfer. You 
start by grabbing your contacts from your PC:
 
1. Plug a flash drive or external hard drive into your PC.
 
2. Create a new folder on that drive and name it — for example, 
addresses to transfer.
 
3. From your PC’s Start menu, open Outlook Express.
 
4. Choose Tools➪Address Book, and then choose Edit➪Select All.

176
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
5. Drag the selected addresses to the addresses to transfer folder.
 
6. Click the Remove Hardware icon in the Windows system tray.
 
7. Click the Safely Remove Mass Storage Device line that matches your 
flash drive in the window that appears. Count to ten, and then unplug 
the drive.
On your Mac, you then follow these steps:
 
1. Open the OS X Address Book application.
 
 The Address Book should be in the Dock; if not, it’s in the Applications 
folder.
 
2. Plug the drive into your Mac.
 
3. Double-click the drive icon and then the addresses to transfer 
folder.
 
4. From the Finder menu, choose Edit➪Select All.
 
5. Drag the selected contacts to the Address Book window.
 
6. Right-click the drive icon and select Eject.
Transferring your AOL address book
Of course, you can use your AOL address book if you continue to use the 
AOL mail service. However, you may want to switch to Apple’s Mail or 
another service, or you might want to consolidate all your contacts in the 
Apple Address Book. If this is the case, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ AOL Sync (aolsync.aol.com) synchronizes your AOL address 
book with Outlook Express, and you can transfer from there to the 
Mac, as described in the previous section. You can also use AOL Sync 
to synchronize your AOL address book with an iPhone or iPod touch, if 
you have one. From there, you can sync to the OS X Address Book.
 
✓ Another option is the Windows program ePreserver, from Connectedsw.
com. It can also transfer your AOL address book to Outlook Express.
 
✓ Other possible approaches don’t require a PC, but they typically involve 
transferring data through several e-mail programs.
Opting for online mail services
If you use your PC Web browser to access one of the online mail services, 
such as Google Gmail, MSN Hotmail, or Yahoo! Mail, you can continue to do 
so using any of the Mac browsers. Just enter the URL you normally use in the 
Mac browser’s address bar.

177
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
Gmail and Yahoo! Mail also allow you to download and read your mail on 
your computer, using a mail program such as Apple Mail. Both support the 
Post Office Protocol (POP). This feature is free in Gmail, but you must pay 
$20 per year to use it in Yahoo! Mail or Hotmail.
 
✓ For Gmail instructions, go to the Gmail Web site’s Help page and click 
the POP Access link.
 
✓ To sign up for the Yahoo! Mail POP service, click the Mail Upgrades link 
in your Yahoo! Mail window and then click the Upgrade to Yahoo! Mail 
Plus button.
 
✓ Hotmail users should sign up for Hotmail Plus.
Hushmail.com, a secure e-mail service, supports OS X and is worth considering 
if mail confidentiality is a concern. Read the part in Chapter 10 on picking a 
strong pass phrase before signing up.
Handling common e-mail problems
The utility of e-mail has diminished in recent years because of the rise of a 
number of antisocial uses. The first was junk e-mail advertising, known as 
spam. The name comes from a skit on Monty Python’s Flying Circus, the BBC 
television comedy series. A Google search for Monty Python spam video is 
likely to find a clip of the original sketch. Watch it.
Unsolicited commercial e-mail or spam
One big problem with spam is that it can drown out your real messages, 
wasting your time and possibly causing you to miss something important. 
Most of the better e-mail services use special software intended to filter out 
spam. They aren’t completely effective, however. The Mail program has 
its own spam filter that you train by indicating messages you think should 
have been caught as spam. It learns some of your criteria as you do this. For 
example, it might realize you’re happy with the size of your body parts and 
suppress messages offering to enlarge them.
 
You can reduce the amount of spam you receive by selecting an unusual 
e-mail address, either random letters or some initials your friends might 
remember but spammers wouldn’t come up with, such as agrfromnyc. 
Avoid e-mail addresses that end in numbers, such as sampark456. And 
don’t post e-mail on Web sites and mailing lists without a disguise, such as 
reinhold{you know what to type here}theworld.com.
The mail order virus
Another concern is the use of e-mail for distributing viruses, worms, and 
other malware. This issue is less prominent on Macs because few OS X 
viruses have been found in the wild.

178
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
Still, it’s worth remembering the advice you have followed as a PC user: Don’t 
open file attachments you weren’t expecting. The Mac has an added twist 
because it asks for permission and a password when installing new software. If 
you get this type of request after opening an e-mail or its attachment, just say 
no. And, if you have other people with accounts on your Mac, particularly 
kids, don’t give them administrative privileges. That way, they have to ask you 
before this type of installation takes place.
See Chapter 10 for more security tips.
419s and phishing
 
Most of us have been deluged with mail requesting assistance in handling a 
large sum of money, in return for which you receive a nice cut of the proceeds. 
If you reply, you’re eventually asked to advance a modest sum of money for 
necessary fees — a trivial amount compared to your eventual cut. After the 
criminals have you on the hook, you see more requests for fees and perhaps 
an invitation to travel to a Third World country, where all sorts of mischief 
await. This type of e-mail is sometimes known as the 419 scam. Reportedly, it 
violates Section 419 of the Nigerian penal code. (Nigeria is one country where 
running these confidence games is a major industry.) Never respond to one 
of these e-mails. Never. Period. The people who run them are experts at 
exploiting that tiny flicker of hope that, against all reason, the story is true. 
They can even make large sums of money appear in your bank account for a 
while. These disappear when the bank finds out that no funds are available to 
cover a transfer along the line. Don’t respond. Ever.
Phishing is sending mail that pretends to be from one of your regular business 
contacts, a major bank, eBay, or PayPal, for example. You’re asked to update 
your records, validate your credit card, or confirm a purchase you obviously 
didn’t make. These messages often appear authentic, with corporate logos 
and valid links to the real company’s Web site, such as links to the company’s 
privacy policy or a Web page where you can report suspected fraud (always 
a nice touch). But they all contain an action link that takes you to a fake 
Web site that, again, looks like the real thing. There, you’re asked to enter 
your password, credit card number, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, 
and other details, such as an expiration date — everything a hard-working 
identity thief could want. Dealing with these e-mails is tricky. The messages 
describe situations that could be true — unlike that e-mail from the heartbroken 
spouse of an executed African dictator with $35 million in a frozen bank 
account who found you through a mutual friend.
 
If you think that a message from eBay, PayPal, your bank, or some other 
source you’re familiar with isn’t authentic, don’t click any of its links, handy 
though that may seem. Instead, type the URL of the business, (ebay.com, for 
example) directly into your Web browser’s address bar. Then navigate to your 
personal account and log on to see whether any such requests are pending. 
If you’re still not sure, call the company, using a phone number from a recent 
bill or bank statement, not from the suspect e-mail.

 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
Instant Messaging
You used to see ads in the New York subway for a stenography school that 
read “if u cn rd ths u cn gt a gd job.” Nowadays, the ability to read that ad 
just means that you use text instant messaging, or IM. The difference between 
IM and e-mail is that IM is live. You and the other person are both online at 
the same time. You type, the other person sees what you type, and he types 
something back.
Systems like this, and the same abbreviated argot, go back to the dawn of 
electronic communication, with Morse code telegraphers chatting with each 
other over hundreds of miles of wire. The deaf community has been using 
this type of communication for decades, under the name TDD. The early 
Internet introduced the system Internet Relay Chat (IRC), which was similar, 
but no permanently assigned names existed. It took commercial services, 
such as America Online, to add that important feature. Texting has since 
been added to cellphones, with the phone number serving as a unique identi-
fier. Teens love it.
With your Mac and an Internet connection, you can take your pick of pro-
grams and services for reaching out to others. The following sections cover 
The most dangerous button
One button on your computer screen can get 
you into no end of trouble. It’s the Send button 
in your e-mail program. When you click it, your 
message is on its way, irretrievable. It’s all too 
easy to click the Send button when you think 
you’ve finished your message, particularly if 
you’re replying to something that ticked you off. 
E-mail correspondence is different from speak-
ing to someone in person or on the phone. No 
tone of voice exists to clue you in to the underly-
ing emotions, and e-mail lacks the instant feed-
back of objections, grunts, and even pauses. 
And, e-mails are written documents, easily pre-
served and searched for. Billion-dollar lawsuits 
and criminal trials have turned on a surfaced 
e-mail message.
E-mail may be the most powerful tool ever cre-
ated for creating misunderstanding. Even if you 
think your message is levelheaded and couldn’t 
possibly be taken the wrong way, it may con-
tain typos and grammatical errors that change 
its meaning, or just create an impression of 
carelessness.
Get in the habit of clicking the Save As Draft 
button rather than the Send button. Go have a 
cup of coffee, and give yourself some time to 
think it over. Then read the e-mail aloud — even 
to an empty office — before you send it.
One of my favorite Mary Tyler Moore Show 
moments was when Rhoda showed Mary a 
letter that Rhoda had written, professing undy-
ing love to a man she had just met. When asked 
for ways to improve the letter, Mary replied, 
“The important thing is that you don’t send it.” 
Sometimes, the best use of mail is to get your 
thoughts on paper and then just leave them in 
the Drafts folder.

the more popular ones: iChat and other IM systems, Skype (the favorite pro-
gram for free Internet phone calls), and social networking sites.
iChat
Unfortunately, the different commercial services rarely allow intercommuni-
cation among their systems. The Apple iChat program comes close to being a 
universal communicator for instant messaging, and it can do a lot more than 
“how r u?” text messaging. In iChat, you have these features at your disposal:
 
✓ You can chat on AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) as well as Apple’s own 
MobileMe Mac.com system and Google Talk. iChat also supports Jabber, 
a new open standard for IM. Jabber, in turn, lets you connect to ICQ and 
Yahoo! Messenger. You can also chat directly with other OS X users on 
your local network by using Bonjour.
 
✓ iChat can support voice and live video communications. The latter 
requires you to have a suitable video camera — iMacs and Apple lap-
tops have them built in. You can invite as many as nine other people for 
a voice conference or three other people for a videoconference. Video 
is transmitted using the ITU H.264 standard, which sends high-quality 
pictures over a limited bandwidth. You can videoconference with people 
on Windows computers as long as they have AOL Instant Messenger ver-
sion 5.5 or later. It gets better:
 
• iChat Theater: Lets you share a slide show or Keynote presenta-
tion with friends or business associates. They even see a live image 
of you as you give your presentation.
 
• iChat Screen Sharing: Lets you and another person control a 
single computer desktop, making it easy to collaborate on a proj-
ect or help someone with a computer problem.
 
• MobileMe: Can automatically encrypt chats with other MobileMe 
members. You both must enable this option, and the encryption 
uses public key certificates generated by Apple, which means 
Apple or anyone who can serve Apple with a subpoena, can poten-
tially read your chats.
 
• OS X Server: Lets businesses set up private, secure iChat systems 
on their local networks. The internal system can include non-Mac 
computers.
 
✓ Finally, iChat includes parental controls that let you limit what your kids 
can do and whom they can chat with.

181
 Chapter 8: Getting Your Mac Online
All you need to set up iChat are the account names and passwords for each 
chat account you use. If your Mac doesn’t have a built-in camera, you can 
use a FireWire camera or any USB camera that’s UVC (Universal Video Class) 
compliant. If you have an older USB camera, check out iUSBCam, from www.
ecamm.com/mac/iusbcam. The inexpensive software might let you use the 
camera you already own.
Other IM systems
You can use your Mac to chat on other IM systems. Yahoo! Messenger and 
MSN Messenger both have OS X clients you can download for free:
 
✓ Yahoo! Messenger: messenger.yahoo.com/mac.php
 
✓ Microsoft Messenger for Mac: www.microsoft.com/mac/products/
messenger
 
✓ Mercury Messenger: www.mercury.to (offers a Java-based MSN client 
that runs on OS X)
The MSN Messenger client is also included in Microsoft Office.
Certain tricks let you access MSN and Yahoo! IM using iChat via Jabber serv-
ers. They’re not for the fainthearted, though. These links can get you started:
www.jabber.org.au/ichat
www.allforces.com/2005/05/06/ichat-to-msn-through-jabber
Still another alternative is Adium, a popular open source messaging client 
for OS X that supports AIM, Google, ICQ, Jabber, MSN, and Yahoo!. You can 
download it for free at trac.adiumx.com.
Internet telephony via Skype
Apple iChat has voice communications built in. Other systems allow voice 
communications over the Internet (VoIP), which are more like using a tele-
phone. The Skype system, from www.skype.com, is an example and is free 
when you talk to other Skype-equipped computers. These can be Windows, 
Linux, and Pocket PC machines as well as Macs. Skype can also transfer files 
and do video, if you have a camera.

182
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
Skype offers a paid service that lets you call telephones all over the world for 
a small fee. Other paid services include inbound calls from telephones, voice 
mail, and SMS messages to and from cellphones.
Social networking sites
Social networking Web sites, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Twitter, 
and the like, operate over the World Wide Web, and your Safari browser con-
nects you to them just fine. All you need are your passwords. Apple’s iPhoto 
makes it easy to upload your photos to these sites. See Chapter 12. And see 
Chapter 14 for ways to make social networking sites even more fun and useful 
with your Mac.

C
omputers without network connections are like fish without water 
except that they don’t start to smell bad. And, Macs are great network 
swimmers. They can connect to just about anything.
Apple uses widely accepted standards such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi for digital 
communication between computers. Apple leads by integrating multiple 
networking technologies into its products and by fielding innovative ways 
to make networking easier to use. One example is Bonjour, a set of software 
tools that let your computer find other services, such as printers, on a 
local-area network, without your having to type magic incantations.
In this chapter, I cover the basics of Macintosh networking, including setting 
up wired and wireless networks. I also cover accessories such as keyboards, 
mice, and cellphones that network over short distances using Bluetooth 
technology. At the end of this chapter, you can also find out about unique 
ways of networking and about sharing files over your network.
Getting Wired with Ethernet
Important elements of the technology in Macintosh computers originated at 
the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The most famous example is 
the graphical user interface, but Ethernet, invented at PARC in the mid-1970s, 
was just as revolutionary. It let computers talk to each other without one 
being made a master of ceremonies that dictated which computer could talk 
and when. The key idea in Ethernet was teaching computers “manners” so 
that they kept their messages short and didn’t interrupt another computer 

184
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
when it was talking. And if by chance two computers started talking at the 
same time, both would silence themselves for a random few microseconds, 
making it less likely that they would collide a second time.
All recent Macs have an Ethernet port, as do many PCs and quite a few printers 
and other devices, including the Apple TV. All you need to connect two such 
computers is an Ethernet cable. The cables are inexpensive, and you can find 
them in varying lengths at computer and electronics stores and many drugstores 
and supermarkets. With two devices connected via an Ethernet cable, you can 
create a local network that lets you transfer files easily.
Many offices have Ethernet jacks in the walls, allowing you to plug in to the 
corporate network. Check with your friendly IT staff before you do.
Although connecting two devices with a cable is easy, you most likely want 
a network that’s a little more capable. For example, your home network can 
enable two or more computers to share a printer and an Internet connection. 
To complete that type of setup, you have a bit more work to do to set up an 
Ethernet network. The following sections walk you through the process.
Configuring Ethernet on your Mac
For the most part, Ethernet just works. If you need to configure its settings, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select Ú➪System Preferences and then click the Network icon.
 
 You see the System Preferences pane, shown in Figure 9-1.
 
Figure 9-1: 
The System 
Preferences 
Ethernet 
pane.
 

185
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
 
2. Select Built-in Ethernet from the sidebar.
 
 The pane you see tells you your Mac’s IP address and the IP address 
of your router, assuming that it sees it. Write down your router’s IP 
address on a sticky note or blank label and stick it on your router. You 
want it handy if you need to configure the router. You also see your 
address in the new, nobody-is-using-it-yet IPv6 addressing scheme.
 
3. If you click the Advanced button, you see a pane, shown in Figure 9-2, 
with a row of buttons labeled TCP/IP, DNS, WINS, AppleTalk, 802.1X, 
Proxies, and Ethernet.
 
 If you aren’t a networking guru, don’t mess with any of them unless 
someone instructs you to do so, such as a tech support person from 
your Internet service provider (ISP) or office IT department. Because 
many of these support people have limited Mac training, it’s good to 
know where to find these settings. You may click the Ethernet button 
to see the unique address assigned to your Macintosh’s Ethernet. It’s a 
Media Access Control (MAC) address (no relation to a Mac computer). 
You can also find it in the Hardware section of the About This Mac 
More Info display on the Apple (Ú) menu. The Ethernet Advanced pane 
also shows the local IP address of your Mac and the IP address of your 
router.

Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
Understanding routers
If you want to connect more than two computers and hook them all up to the 
Internet, you need an Ethernet router. This small box has several Ethernet 
jacks so that you can plug in each computer. You use a special jack to 
connect the router to your high-speed Internet modem or to another router. 
Some routers also include a Wi-Fi access point. I get to that topic in the next 
section.
Your router has a small computer inside that knows how to send the right 
messages to the right computer attached to it. Most routers have blinking 
lights in front that clue you in to what’s working and active. Routers include 
a number of capabilities, such as firewalls for increased security and parental 
controls. You configure a router using your Web browser — its setup screen 
appears as a Web site with a special address.
Devices on your Ethernet are automatically assigned IP addresses in one of 
the special ranges that are reserved for private networks. These never go 
out on the public Internet, so you and your neighbors can be using the same 
addresses on your respective home networks without a problem. These 
numbers are usually assigned automatically. From the outside, your local 
network is known by the globally unique IP address assigned to it by your 
Internet service provider. Your computers — you can network more than 
one — use their internal addresses, and your router converts those to the 
external address automatically as needed, a process known as Network 
Address Translation (NAT).
Hooking up your router
You may already have a router as part of your PC installation. If so, you 
just need to run an Ethernet cable from your Mac to an empty port on your 
router. If not, and if you want to share your Internet connection with multiple 
computers, you should purchase a router. Apple makes some nice ones, 
including Time Capsule, that also includes a large hard drive for over-the-
network backup. See Chapter 2 for more information.
The exact procedure for setting up a router can vary for different models, 
so look over the instructions that come with it and then save them with the 
other papers that came with your Mac. The installation generally goes like 
this:
 
1. Run an Ethernet cable from your high-speed modem to your router’s 
WAN port.

187
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
 
2. Run an Ethernet cable from each computer you want to wire to the 
network to one of the router’s LAN ports.
 
 If you have a Wi-Fi router, you don’t need to run a cable to a Wi-Fi-
equipped computer, though you can if you want.
 
3. Hook up power to your router.
 
 Typically, you plug the power unit that came with the router into an 
outlet on the wall or a power strip and then plug the power unit’s wire 
into your router.
Configuring your router
Your router sits on your network like any other computer. Most routers — 
but not Apple’s, which I explain in a bit — put up their own Web site on your 
local network that you access with any Web browser, such as Safari. You 
configure the router through this Web site. Don’t confuse this Web site with 
the router manufacturer’s Web site, such as www.linksys.com. The one 
you use to change settings is literally inside your router and is accessible 
only from computers on your local network.
Your router keeps one internal IP address for itself, and you need to know 
that numeric address to access the browser’s Web site. The default address 
your browser uses is in its manual. In case you lost it, here are the IP 
addresses most often used by popular manufacturers, though the one used 
for your model may vary:
 
✓ D-Link:192.168.0.1
 
✓ Linksys: 192.168.1.1
 
✓ Netgear: 192.168.0.1
 
✓ SMC: 192.168.2.1
 
✓ USRobotics: 192.168.123.254
With the IP address in hand, you can set up your router as follows:
 
1. Open your Web browser and type your router’s IP address on the 
address bar.
 
 For most SMC routers, you type 192.168.2.1 in your browser’s address 
bar to access the router’s Web page.
 
2. When the router’s logon screen appears and asks for a password and, 
on many models, a username, enter the information that’s requested.

188
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
 If you assigned a password and forgot it, the simplest thing to do is to 
reset the router. However, you lose any configuration information, such 
as game ports, you had previously set up. You might first try one of the 
common default passwords: admin, password, 1234, 12345, and none 
(that is, leave the password field blank).
 
 If all else fails, reset your router. You can often press a small button 
hidden behind a hole in back of the case. The standard method is to 
use a toothpick or straightened paper clip. After it resets, your router 
accepts a default username and password. Again, check your manual. 
If you don’t know your router’s default password, try the ones listed 
previously or check the booklet that came with the router. If you can’t 
find it, check the manufacturer’s Web site. It helps to know the router’s 
model number, too. Also, this Web site compiles default usernames and 
passwords for routers: www.phenoelit-us.org/dpl/dpl.html.
 
3. After you get past the router’s logon screen, you see what looks like 
a miniature Web site with many pages you can navigate to change 
settings.
 
 Figure 9-3 shows a typical router configuration page.
 
Figure 9-3: 
An SMC 
router’s 
configura-
tion screen.
 
 
 Exactly what you can do varies by model, but common capabilities 
include these actions:
 
• Set a new username and password.
 
• Configure how your router connects to your high-speed Internet 
modem.

189
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
 
• Turn on or off a built-in firewall that helps protect computers on 
your local network from attacks over the Internet. To do this, you 
block most ports, which are special code numbers your computer 
can respond to.
 
• Allow certain ports to be visible through the firewall, a capability 
needed for many online games.
 
• Set parental controls, such as limiting Internet use on certain 
computers to certain hours. (See Chapter 17.)
 
4. When you’re done, follow the prompts to save your settings, if 
needed, and exit your router’s internal configuration page.
Networking Wirelessly
Apple didn’t invent Wi-Fi wireless networking, but it was the first company 
to popularize its use, under the brand name AirPort. A geekier name for 
the same thing is its Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers spec 
number, IEEE 802.11. Most new Macs, including all laptops, come with Wi-Fi 
built in and ready to go. The MacPro just needs to have an AirPort card 
installed to be on the air.
Ethernet has a geek name, too: IEEE 802.3. And, as the numbers suggest, Wi-Fi 
is related to Ethernet. But rather than send short messages over wires, Wi-Fi 
sends them by way of radio signals. The Wi-Fi protocol is more complicated 
than Ethernet’s because radio signals can fade in and out as laptops move 
around, and you can move from one access point to another automatically.
Understanding access points
The heart of a Wi-Fi network is an access point that supervises the 
communications. An access point may be built into your Ethernet router, 
or it may be a stand-alone unit. Each access point has a limited range, up to 
about 300 feet, or 100 meters; however, you can have more than one access 
point, and they can talk to each other. To let Wi-Fi computers within range 
access the Internet, at least one access point has to connect to your Internet 
modem, usually with an Ethernet cable.
Wi-Fi comes in several flavors, denoted by lowercase letters attached to the 
geek name. They are 802.11a, 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n. The 802.11b was 
the first version that Apple introduced. It’s also the slowest: nominally, 11 
Mbps (megabits per second). The 802.11g version came later and can operate 

190
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
at 54 Mbps. The a version is as fast as g but operates on a different frequency 
band. The latest version is 802.11n. It’s as much as five times as fast as g and 
can use both frequency bands. New Macs support all four standards.
The speeds listed for the various versions are maximum speeds. The speed 
you see depends on many factors, and it’s usually no more than half the 
maximum. A big advantage of the faster speeds is the ability to stream media 
files between computers and to your home entertainment center’s Apple 
TV. If you’re connecting to the Internet using Wi-Fi, you’re also limited by 
the speed of your Internet connection, which, even with high-speed cable or 
DSL service, is often slower than even 802.11b. Be aware that a Wi-Fi network 
automatically throttles down to the speed of its slowest member, so if you 
have an older laptop that only knows how to speak 802.11b, you might want 
to turn it off or shut down Wi-Fi on it when it’s not in use.
Dealing with Wi-Fi security
Another issue Wi-Fi has to deal with is security. Ethernet signals are pretty 
much confined to the wire, so unless a snoop enters your premises and 
taps in, your communications stay private. Wi-Fi is radio and can go beyond 
your walls. A snoop could park on your street and possibly pick up your 
Wi-Fi signal with a laptop, or receive it from miles away with a high-gain 
directional antenna. (Instructions are available on the Internet for making a 
good antenna out of a Pringles potato chip can.) So the Wi-Fi folks added an 
encryption option, which evolved into these two options:
 
✓ WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy): The first form of encryption, WEP was 
meant to offer the same level of security you enjoy with wired Ethernet. 
Researchers soon found gaping holes in its design; using WEP is like 
posting a Keep Out sign on your property. Honest people respect it; 
crooks don’t.
 
✓ WPA (Wireless Protected Access) and WPA2: These two newer security 
standards were added in response to the problems with WEP. The 
latter, WPA2, has the geek name of IEEE 802.11i. WPA and WPA2 provide 
protection more like a high chain-link fence (WPA2 adds barbed wire on 
top). But a fence isn’t worth much if the gate has a lock that’s easy to 
pick. To take full advantage of WPA and WPA2, you need to set a strong, 
cryptovariable-grade password or pass phrase when you set them up. I 
tell you how to pick strong passwords in Chapter 10.
 
If you have to use WEP for some reason, be especially careful to check 
whether Web sites are secure — look for the closed-lock icon — before 
entering passwords and other personal information. If you need to access 
corporate or other sensitive sites, see whether they support a virtual private 
network (VPN). VPNs use “end-to-end” encryption, so data intercepted by a 
wireless snoop is meaningless to them.

191
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
Setting up your Wi-Fi hardware
Most of the heavy lifting needed to set up a Wi-Fi network takes place at the 
access point or base station. In the sections that follow, you find out how to 
set up Wi-Fi connections in a number of different ways. I start by explaining the 
Apple access point and other access points. But this isn’t your only option. 
Depending on your setup, you may want to make your Mac an access point or 
just network several computers wirelessly. Read on for details.
Apple’s Time Capsule base station
If you already have a Wi-Fi router or access point, you can use it with your 
Mac. (See the next section in this chapter.) But if you don’t have one or want 
to move up to the faster 802.11n standard or just want more coverage in your 
home or office, consider getting the combined Apple Wi-Fi base station and 
backup disc, Time Capsule. Chapter 2 offers a quick overview of what Time 
Capsule offers as I write this book. One cool trick worth noting here is that 
Time Capsule can stream content — such as music, movies, and slide 
shows — to an Apple TV in your home entertainment center. The streamed 
content can come from your Mac or the shared disk. Everything plays 
together. Welcome to the future.
If you don’t want the backup drive, Apple sells a similar product without one: 
AirPort Extreme. It has the same connection ports as Time Capsule, including 
the USB port, so you can add an external backup drive if you want. To set 
up your Time Capsule or AirPort Extreme from OS X, you run the AirPort 
Setup Assistant program. It’s in the Utilities folder that’s inside your 
Applications folder. If you want to access the shared printer and hard drive 
from your PC, you load on your PC the Bonjour for Windows software that 
comes with the base station. You need to be running at least Windows XP 
with Service Pack 2.
Configuring other base stations
Most non-Apple Wi-Fi base stations are built into a router and are configured 
using your Web browser, as described in the section “Configuring your 
router,” earlier in this chapter. When you enter the browser’s IP address, 
username, and password, you see the usual router Web page, such as the one 
shown earlier, in Figure 9-3, with router configuration options plus additional 
ones for wireless, which include options for these tasks:
 
✓ Turn on Wi-Fi so that your hardware is enabled. This is also the place 
where you can turn off Wi-Fi if the need arises.
 
✓ Specify which Wi-Fi modes are allowed — your old friends a, b, g, and n.
 
✓ Give your network a name, or service set identifier (SSID). Avoid using a 
name that reveals your identity, such as thereinholds. Be creative.

192
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
✓ Decide whether to broadcast that name. Turning off SSID broadcast 
makes it a little harder for snoops to find you, but it’s also harder for 
you to find your own network.
 
✓ Decide whether to turn on security and, if you do, decide which mode to 
use: WEP, WPA, or WPA2. If you know that all the computers and other 
Wi-Fi devices you’re using are relatively new and support WPA2, that’s 
the security mode to use. Otherwise, I suggest WPA, which works with 
most stuff out there except for some game controllers. WEP is a last 
resort, to be avoided if possible.
 
 See the section “Dealing with Wi-Fi security,” earlier in this chapter, for 
details.
 
✓ Decide what password to use for wireless security. The password you’re 
asked to enter has nothing to do with your computer’s logon password 
and should be different. WPA and WPA2 are both quite strong encryption 
schemes, as long as you use a WPA password that’s hard to crack. WPA 
uses its password as a cryptographic key, and that key can be broken 
if the password is too simple. I discuss picking strong passwords in 
Chapter 10. But the bottom line is to use 16 or more random letters. 
Write them down and keep them somewhere safe. Yeah, I know, 
someone told you never to do that. I don’t agree. You can read my 
reasons in Chapter 10. If you forget your Wi-Fi security password, reset 
the unit as described in the section “Configuring your router,” earlier in 
this chapter, and create a new password.
Making your Mac a Wi-Fi access point
If you have a Wi-Fi–equipped Mac connected to the Internet by a wired 
Ethernet connection or even a dialup modem, you can turn that Mac into a 
Wi-Fi access point and share the connection with other Wi-Fi-equipped Macs 
and even PCs.
A RADIUS you can ignore
When you set up an access point (other than 
AirPort), you may see configuration options for 
RADIUS or 802.11x. They’re generally used by 
enterprise-scale installations that have com-
puter servers set up to manage user authen-
tication. Wi-Fi access points can be set up to 
communicate with these Remote Authentication 
Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) servers to get 
their cryptographic keys, and so on. It’s good 
stuff, but probably not something you need for 
a home or small office. If you work in a large 
enterprise that uses RADIUS, the IT staff can 
clue you in on what to do. If you are the IT staff, 
try reading a different book.

193
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
To do this, follow these steps on the computer that has the Internet connection:
 
1. Select Ú➪System Preferences or click its Dock icon, and then click the 
Sharing icon.
 
2. Click the Internet tab.
 
3. From the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu, select the way 
this computer is connected to the Internet: It’s typically Ethernet, 
Modem, or Bluetooth.
 
4. In the To Computers Using section, select the AirPort check box.
 
5. Click the AirPort Options button.
 
6. Assign your new network a name.
 
7. Turn on encryption, if you like (icky WEP is the only option) and enter 
a password.
 
8. Click the OK button.
 
9. Back in the Sharing pane, click the Start button in the Internet Sharing 
section.
Your other computers should now see your new Wi-Fi network. When you 
no longer want your Mac to serve as an access point, go back to the System 
Preferences Sharing pane and click the Stop button in the Internet Sharing 
section.
Creating a network with no base station
If you just want to network with a bunch of other Wi-Fi-equipped computers, 
you don’t need no stinkin’ base station. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Select Create Network from the Wireless icon list.
 
2. Give your network a name.
 
3. Turn on wimpy WEP encryption if you like — that’s all Apple offers, 
so don’t use this mode for sensitive information.
 
 For some added protection, be sure to use 128-bit mode with a random 
password that you change frequently. See diceware.com/airport.
html.
 
 You’re on the air.
Windows can do this trick, too, and you can join each other’s networks. 
These computer-to-computer networks show up in a separate section of the 
Wireless icon list.

Connecting with Wi-Fi
After you set up your hardware, you’re ready to connect to your network. 
Turn on AirPort — the Apple name for Wi-Fi — by following these steps:
 
1. Click the Wireless icon at the top of your screen (see Figure 9-4).
 
Figure 9-4: 
You have 
lots of Wi-Fi 
networks 
to choose 
from, includ-
ing one 
that’s open.
 
 
2. Click the Wireless icon again, just once.
 
 Be patient. Count to five.
 
3. In a couple of seconds, a list of wireless networks that your Mac can 
hear appears (refer to the list shown in Figure 9-4).
 
 Hopefully, yours is on the list.
 
 Beware of Wi-Fi phishing! In public places, such as airports (the kind 
with runways) and computer trade shows, you commonly see computer-
to-computer networks with names like Open Hot Spot or Free Internet 
Access. The people who set up these networks usually don’t have your 
best interests at heart. Windows users who log on to these sites often 
receive a free virus sampler for their efforts, and Mac viruses may 
show up one of these days. So stay away from computer-to-computer 
networks you don’t know about, and definitely don’t give out personal 
information, such as a credit card number or even a home address — 
criminals pay for information such as “the Smith family is waiting to 
board a plane to Europe.”
 
4. Select the network and enter your password when asked, assuming 
that you set one.
 
 If you’re joining a network that doesn’t broadcast its name for the world 
to see, select Other from the Wireless icon list. You’re then prompted 
for the name of the network (spelling counts), the type of security used, 
and the password, if any.

ers preferred and the order in which it tries to connect, while giving you the 
option to change that information.

Fixing interference problems
The performance you enjoy can also be reduced by interference from other 
radio signals. The b and g versions of Wi-Fi operate on a radio band, 2.4 GHz, 
where licensed operation is permitted. This band is shared with other users, 
including Bluetooth hardware, cordless telephones, microwave ovens, and 
amateur radio, not to mention your neighbor’s Wi-Fi network. The a version 
operates at 5 GHz, also unlicensed, but at a less-cluttered spot on your 
microwave dial. Wi-Fi can use several different channels in each band — the 
number varies by country — so a fair amount of band sharing is possible.
Somewhere in the back of your computer’s manual with all the other legal 
notices, you should see this notice:
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to 
the following two conditions: (1) This device may not cause harmful interfer-
ence, and (2) this device must accept any interference received, including 
interference that may cause undesired operation.
Of course, this legalese applies within the United States, but other countries 
have similar rules. If you have interference, you’re usually on your own.

196
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
You can take the following steps to combat interference and other signal 
problems:
 
✓ Move your laptop. Closer to the access point is usually better, but any 
change in position and orientation can help, even a few inches. (One-
quarter wavelength at 2.4 GHz is about an inch-and-a-quarter — that can 
be the difference between a signal null and a hot spot.)
 
✓ Move the access point. Put it in a more central location, hang it high on 
a wall, or move it away from a known source of interference, such as a 
cordless phone base station or a microwave oven. Experiment.
 
✓ Adjust the access point’s antenna. Try small increments. If it has two 
antennas, have them point in different directions, at right angles to each 
other.
 
✓ Turn off your cordless phone and unplug the base station. If that 
reduces the interference, move your cordless phone and base station 
farther from the access point and from your laptop. Plug the base 
station into a different outlet. If those steps don’t help, replace your 
cordless phone with a model that operates on a different frequency 
band (the band is usually marked on the package), or just go back to 
wired phones. (You probably carry a cellphone anyway.)
 
✓ Get a new microwave oven. You can easily tell whether your microwave 
oven causes network problems — the problems happen only when it’s 
cooking. If the microwave is used infrequently, you might just live with 
the interference, but if it’s used a lot, say, in a small office at lunchtime, 
consider buying a newer model. It’s cheap and you can return the new 
one if it’s no better. Also, make sure that the microwave is on a different 
electrical circuit from your laptop and access points.
 
✓ Buy a Wi-Fi repeater. These units plug into a wall outlet and retransmit 
Wi-Fi signals from your access point for greater coverage. Having a 
second signal source may reduce interference problems.
Getting Personal with Bluetooth
The mission of the Bluetooth wireless technology differs from Wi-Fi’s. Wi-Fi 
connects the computers and other devices within a home or place of business 
to create a local-area network. Bluetooth has a much shorter range, about 
30 feet. It’s designed to create a personal network around an individual. The 
most familiar example is the Bluetooth headset — a friend calls them Borg 
implants, after the evil Star Trek cyborgs. These units fit over your ear and 

197
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
connect wirelessly to Bluetooth-equipped cellphones. They let the wearer 
talk hands-free. Bluetooth can also be used to connect a keyboard and mouse 
to your Mac without wires. Nintendo uses Bluetooth in its Wii game controllers. 
Bluetooth can link your Mac to your iPhone and other cellphones, allowing 
address book updates to be shared among all devices, in the process known 
as synchronizing.
Bluetooth was the nickname of a tenth-century Danish king, Harald I, who 
unified many warring tribes. Like its namesake, Bluetooth networking can 
unify may disparate devices to create your own, personal computing empire. 
Next-generation Bluetooth will let small devices talk to each other without an 
intervening personal computer.
Pairing before sharing
Two Bluetooth devices can’t talk with each other until they have been formally 
introduced, a process called pairing. You can easily understand why this is 
necessary. You don’t want your Bluetooth cellphone chitchatting with the 
cellphone of the person sitting next to you on the bus — unless that person 
is cute. You might wonder how to get them to pair if they can’t talk to each 
other. The answer is that you have to put one of them in the special state 
known as discoverable. How this is done differs for each device. In some 
cases, you press a special button or hold down a regular button longer, or 
you must navigate through a cellphone menu maze. The details are in each 
device’s manual. This leads me to state the following law:
 
King Harald’s First Law of Bluetooth: Never throw out the instruction booklet 
supplied with a Bluetooth device. In Chapter 4, I suggest that you find a place 
to keep all the manuals and discs that come with your computer and 
accessories — one you won’t forget about. You can keep cellphone and 
Bluetooth papers there, too. If you do lose the booklet, check the device 
manufacturer’s Web site. Most have instructions online for recent models.
Configuring Bluetooth
You configure Bluetooth on the Mac side by clicking the Bluetooth icon at the 
top of your Mac’s screen. The list you see includes options to turn Bluetooth 
on and off, make your Mac discoverable by other Bluetooth devices, and 
browse for files on Bluetooth devices. You can also open the Bluetooth 
preferences screen, shown in Figure 9-6, which is also available from System 
Preferences.

Networking in Other Ways
Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are the main ways to network Macs, but the 
following other tricks may come in handy:
 
✓ FireWire: You can connect a FireWire cable between two Macs that 
have FireWire ports, and OS X can use that cable as a network 
connection. FireWire shows up in the System Preferences Network 
pane’s pop-up menu list, just like Ethernet or AirPort. You simply select 
it and configure it, if necessary, the same way you would configure 
Ethernet.
 
✓ FireWire disk mode: Another way to use FireWire to transfer data 
between two FireWire-equipped Macs is to reboot one of them (not 
both) while holding down the T key. That Mac starts up in what Apple 
calls FireWire disk mode. You see a large FireWire logo dancing around 
your computer’s screen. If you then plug the other end of the FireWire 
cable into the Mac you didn’t reboot, the first Mac’s hard drive appears 
on the second Mac’s desktop as just another hard drive. You can then 
move files to it or transfer files out of it, just like on any external hard 
drive.
 
✓ MobileMe: The Apple MobileMe service lets subscribers share access to 
their iDisks. You can even synchronize files, contacts, and appointments 
between two Macs. Space is limited, however.
 
✓ Sneakernet: The ultimate fallback networking scheme is to use a USB 
flash drive to transfer data from one computer to another. A flash drive 
can easily fit in your pocket, and most incorporate a loop so that you 
can attach them to a key chain. Some people hang theirs around their 
neck on a lanyard. Wearing sneakers is optional.

199
 Chapter 9: Networking the Mac Way
Sharing Files over Your Network
Regardless of how you establish your network, you probably want to use it to 
share files with other connected computers.
Sharing files from your Mac
You can tell your Mac to make files available to other computers on your 
local network, or even over the Internet. From an administrator account, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Select Ú➪System Preferences or click its Dock icon, and click the 
Sharing icon.
 
 You see the Sharing pane, shown in Figure 9-7.
 
Figure 9-7: 
The System 
Preferences 
Sharing 
pane.
 
 
2. Select the check boxes next to the sharing modes you want to use.
 
 Personal File Sharing allows other Macs to access files on this machine. 
To let your PC see your Mac files, click the Options button and then 
select the Share Files and Folders Using SMB check box. You then have 
to specify which accounts on your Mac can use Windows sharing. 
Normally, only the Public folder is shared, but you can specify other 
folders to be shared.
 
You can select more than one sharing mode, but because each one has 
potential security risks, don’t select more modes than you plan to use.

200
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
Sharing files from your PC
I cover setting up PC file sharing from Windows XP in Chapter 6. (You right-
click a folder you want to share, choose Properties, and select the Share 
This Folder on the Network check box.) File sharing from Windows Vista is 
controlled from the Network and Sharing Center Control Panel. You select 
the check boxes next to the modes you want to enable. It works much like 
the process in OS X, except that Vista shares files only in a Shared folder, and 
you have to promise Vista you won’t share anything bad.
Seeing the files you shared
To see shared files from your Mac, follow these steps:
 
1. Select Connect to Server from the Finder’s Go menu, and then click 
the Browse button.
 
 Or, you can click the Network icon in the sidebar of an open Finder 
window.
 
2. Click the Servers line.
 
 You see the Network browser, shown in Figure 9-8.
 
3. Click the server you want to access and log on.
 
 You need a password for the other machine, if one has been set.

Staying Secure in a 
Connected World
In This Chapter
▶ Feeling safe — the OS X security model
▶ Picking safe passwords
▶ Making Mac OS X even more secure
▶ Disposing of your old computer
A
s you most likely know, the convenience of hopping on the Internet has 
its downside: viruses, spyware, identity theft, and more. You’re better 
equipped to avoid these hassles if you have at least a basic understanding of 
what they are and how to keep them at bay. One reason you may be switching 
to a Mac is precisely because you’re looking for better security.
In this chapter, Mac security features are in the spotlight. You find out not 
only what Mac OS X does behind the scenes to keep the gunk away from your 
computer but also how to take advantage of features and techniques that 
improve on its already good defenses — namely, strong passwords and file 
encryption tools.
What Makes a Mac More Secure?
Macs have a reputation for security on the Internet, and for the most part, 
it’s well deserved. Critics say Macs have such a small share of the overall 
computer market that computer criminals and hacker hobbyists don’t consider 
them worth the time to mount an attack. That may indeed be part of the 
story, but Mac users aren’t complaining about being ignored. Popularity isn’t 
always a good thing.

202
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
However, there is much more to Mac security. Apple built OS X on top of 
the operating system Unix, which AT&T developed for its internal use, back 
when it was the telephone monopoly in the United States. UNIX had good 
security tools, and Apple added more.
Modern operating systems, such as OS X and Microsoft Windows, assign 
different levels of privilege to different programs. Operating systems are the 
gatekeepers of a computer, deciding which programs are allowed to run and 
what they’re allowed to do. Intruders have two goals: to be able to run their 
evil programs on your computer and to get maximum privileges for their 
programs. After they get that gold pass, the programs can install themselves 
in the innards of the operating system in ways that are hard to detect. The 
maximum permission level on many operating systems is the root level, and 
hacker tools that can penetrate to this level are rootkits.
Windows XP lets many programs run at a maximum privilege level. If an 
attacker can subvert one of these programs — and he often can — the hacker 
is home free. OS X is more careful with the privileges it doles out. You can 
tell Windows to be more careful too, but doing so can cause problems for 
legitimate programs that were designed to operate at a high privilege level. 
OS X has always restricted application program privileges, so all Mac 
applications are cool with those restrictions.
Just as in Windows, users can adjust security settings up or down in Mac 
OS X, but because OS X is shipped with security set at a high level to begin 
with, and most people never mess with the settings, Mac viruses are hard 
to spread. Epidemiologists have learned that they don’t have to inoculate 
an entire population with a vaccine to stop an epidemic. As long as a large 
enough fraction of the population is immune, the disease stops spreading. It 
works the same for computers. Having most Macs set at a high security level 
makes it difficult for any Mac virus to propagate.
Protecting Yourself with Passwords
Never write down your password. Eat five servings of fruits and vegetables 
every day. Use a different password for every account. Get 30 minutes of 
aerobic exercise four times a week. Always select passwords with uppercase 
and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Every time you’re 
with that special someone, be sure to use a — well, you get the idea. We’re 
constantly bombarded with good advice — advice that we know we should 
listen to — but most of us fall short.
As computers and Internet technology have crept into more and more aspects 
of our daily lives, our use of passwords has exploded. E-mail, instant messaging, 
online banking, brokerage accounts, automated teller machines, computers, 

203
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
Internet routers, multiplayer games, social networking Web sites — they all 
ask for passwords. And then we need a bunch more at work and school. The 
average computer user accesses dozens of different password-protected 
thingies. And the consequences of forgetting a password or having one fall 
into the wrong hands range from inconvenience to disaster.
Following a proper personal 
password policy
Your Mac isn’t an island, and no amount of fiddling with its security settings 
can protect you if you don’t use passwords wisely. But advice that made 
sense when most people had one or two passwords to remember becomes 
impossible to follow when people have 20 or 30 to keep track of. Increasingly, 
computer security experts are realizing that the traditional password policy 
is unrealistic at best and counterproductive at worst. So, in the following 
sections, I present some suggestions for using passwords that you can 
actually follow and that can make your computer far more secure than the 
vast majority out there.
Use a common password for unimportant accounts
If someone figures out the password for your newspaper subscriptions and 
other informational Web sites that demand registration for no good reason, 
it’s not the end of the world. So it’s reasonable to use one password for all 
those accounts. For extra credit, you might have two common passwords: 
one for stuff you really don’t care about and a second for sites that feature 
social networks or instant messaging, for example, where you have no big 
risk of financial loss but you want to maintain some privacy.
Use separate, stronger passwords for important work accounts and for 
personal accounts, such as online banking, where real potential exists for 
misuse that can cost you money or enable identity theft.
Write down your passwords
Most people can’t memorize as many passwords as they need for optimal 
security. You can too easily to forget the ones you don’t use daily. Instead, 
they just keep recycling one or two easily remembered passwords. If software 
at work makes them pick a password with mixed cases and special characters, 
they add the minimum needed to get past the password police.
You’re more likely to pick strong passwords if you know that they’re written 
down someplace so that you run no risk of forgetting them. The trick is to 
keep the list safe. The classic Post-it note stuck to your monitor isn’t what I 
have in mind. Good choices include the following places:

204
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
✓ Your wallet: You have other valuable information in there already, 
such as your credit cards and driver’s license. You’re careful with it by 
habit. If you lose it, you quickly notice it’s gone and you can change 
the passwords on your computer accounts at the same time you’re 
canceling your charge accounts.
 
✓ A clever hiding place at home: Use your ingenuity. A slip of paper 
doesn’t take up much space. You probably have lots of nooks and 
crannies. But be sure to pick a location you’ll remember. The first place 
you think of is one you’ll likely remember again.
 
✓ A safe-deposit box: Although it’s awkward when you need to add 
new accounts, it can be a good place for your master list. Keep recent 
changes in your wallet. If you plan ahead, your next of kin will have a 
much easier time dealing with your estate if someone can acquire a list 
of your passwords after you’re gone. If you want to take some secrets to 
the grave, use a separate password and leave it off this list.
 
✓ A password manager program: These applications keep all your 
passwords in an encrypted file. All you need to remember is one 
master password. And, most of these programs offer to generate 
strong, random passwords for you when you open new accounts.
 
Mac OS X has the built-in password manager Keychain. OS X automatically 
uses Keychain to store the passwords it needs, such as for Wi-Fi, networks, 
and accessing various Web sites. You can see the passwords it stores, and 
add more entries if you want, by opening Keychain Access in the folder that 
opens when you choose Applications➪Utilities. You need to enter your login 
password to see the stored passwords. Figure 10-1 shows the Keychain Access 
displaying a stored password. To add a new password, click the plus sign icon 
(+) in the lower-left corner of the window.

Access.
 

205
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
Quite a few password manager applications (known as apps) are available 
for the iPhone and iPod touch. Some are free or 99 cents, and others cost 
ten dollars, relatively expensive, as iPhone apps go. One problem with this 
category of application is that you have no easy way to move your data from 
one application to another. You generally have to type everything again — 
a real pain if you have lots of passwords. So try the one you selected for a 
while before you enter all your data.
None of the iPhone password managers I’ve found is open source, so it’s 
impossible to check how well the encryption and password-generation 
features are implemented. Some allow only a numeric code to access your 
data — that’s not secure enough. I’ve been using SplashID, which syncs with 
a Mac or PC if you purchase the more expensive version of SplashID for those 
platforms.
The following good password managers are available for Mac OS X and 
Palm OS:
 
✓ Mac programs include only the Java version of Password Safe 
(passwordsafe.sourceforge.net) and Password Gorilla 
(www.fpx.de/fp/Software/Gorilla). Both are free and open source 
and are compatible with each other and with their Windows and Linux 
versions.
 
✓ For Palm OS, I suggest Keyring (gnukeyring.sourceforge.net), also 
free and open source. It’s a handy program, but note that although you 
can back up your password file to your Mac during a HotSync operation, 
you can read the password file only on a Palm OS device.
Change your passwords only when you have a good reason
I know, the password police say to change passwords every few months. 
Some companies configure their software to require periodic changes. I find 
this advice dubious at best for most people. A miscreant who gets hold of 
your password is likely to use it promptly. And, people forced to change 
passwords soon learn the minimum change they need to make to get past 
the password-change program. Attackers know those tricks, too. The time 
to change passwords is when you think they may be compromised, such as 
when you have to give someone else a password — never a good thing to 
do, but it happens — or when a trusted employee quits or is fired. Using a 
sensitive password at a cybercafé is another occasion for a change.

206
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
Picking powerful passwords
Passwords are like medicine: If all you have is a common cold, you might pick 
up whichever remedy catches your eye on the drugstore shelves. But if you 
have a serious condition, you want prescription drugs that are tested and 
known to work. Picking passwords is similar. If you’re protecting stuff that 
doesn’t matter all that much, most any password will do. But if your password 
is guarding information that could do real harm if the wrong people got hold 
of it — harm to yourself, your family, your business, or your clients — you 
need a method of picking passwords whose quality is measurable.
You find lots of advice on how to create a password, and much of it is 
negative. Don’t pick a single word in a dictionary. Don’t use a password 
shorter than eight characters. Don’t use passwords that people who know 
you might easily guess, such as the name of your kid, pet, or significant 
other. The positive advice mostly asks you to do something clever, like 
think of a famous quote, lyric, or title and then abbreviate it; for example, 
2bornot2b, 0saycanuc, or S2Mac4D. The problem is that people who write 
password-cracking programs know all these tricks and have built them into 
their programs. And, those password-cracking programs and dictionaries are 
widely available on the Internet.
Assessing risk
Security doesn’t exist in a vacuum. You have to 
consider the risks you face. For computer secu-
rity, risks fall into two major categories: outside 
and inside. Outside risks refer to things bad 
guys can do without entering your premises: 
sniff your Wi-Fi signal from your parking lot, 
capture your data as it makes its way through 
the Internet, or just steal your laptop, for exam-
ple. Inside risks cover things that can be done 
by guests, family members, fellow employees, 
and the cleaning people.
By using passwords, you make outside risks 
generally easier to protect against than inside 
risks. A determined insider has too many ways to 
capture your password, ranging from installing 
keystroke-capture software on your computer to 
placing a concealed video camera above your 
desk. (With tiny, inexpensive wireless cameras, 
this is now alarmingly easy to do.)
The best practice for large organizations that 
demand strong internal security requires two-
factor authentication. Users demonstrate who 
they are to the computer by knowing a password 
or PIN and by having in their possession a small 
device called a token. Some tokens plug into the 
computer; others display a number that changes 
frequently. The user types the number into the 
computer along with the password during logon. 
At least one vendor, Cryptocard.com, supports 
two-factor authentication on Macs.

207
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
The amazing power of random
 
Few silver bullets in life exist, but one is available for picking passwords. If 
you pick the letters or symbols of your password at random and make it long 
enough, the odds of someone guessing it become astronomically low.
Most security experts don’t push random passwords, out of concern that 
most users won’t accept them. The passwords seem ugly and hard to 
remember. Because it’s possible that you’ve now read several chapters of a 
computer-advice book, I think you’re exceptional and might be willing to put 
in the little bit of effort needed to get the best security you can.
One reason I take a contrarian view on some standard password maxims is 
that they encourage less secure behavior. Asking people to have separate 
passwords for every account, telling them to never write down passwords, 
and forcing them to change passwords regularly absolutely guarantees that 
they will find ways to circumvent the process. The ways most users do that 
are all too predictable. I think it’s better to write down a random password 
than to memorize an easy one that won’t stop an attacker anyway.
Another old saw asks people to include a mix of uppercase and lowercase 
letters, digits, and special characters in their passwords. The well-intentioned 
idea is to make their passwords more random. But most people simply add 
a digit or special character to their favorite password. And, they typically do 
that in predictable ways. Security expert Bruce Schneier recently found that 
the most commonly used password on MySpace.com was password1.
Scoring a password
One nice thing about random passwords is that you can measure their strength. 
You can easily assign a point score that says how hard they are to guess. Each 
additional point means that it’s twice as hard to guess the password.
The way you figure the score is quite simple: Each character or symbol 
in the password scores a certain number of points, and you just add them up. 
The number of points per character depends on how many possibilities you 
choose from. If you pick a character at random from the 26 letters a to z, it 
receives 4.7 points. If the possibilities include the 26 letters and the 10 digits 
0 to 9, you receive 5.1 points per character. Pick at random from any of the 94 
possible characters on a standard U.S. computer keyboard — lowercase and 
uppercase letters, digits, and special characters — and you score 6.5 points 
per character.
The thing to note is that the fancy passwords score more, but not that many 
more, points per character. An 11-character password of single-case letters 
a through z has the same strength as an 8-character password made up of all 

208
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
94 possible keyboard characters: about 52 points. Which password style you 
choose is mostly a matter of taste. Both are equally secure. If you use your 
password a lot, saving three characters may be worth the trouble. On the 
other hand, if you travel to other countries and plan to use local computers 
there to log on to your accounts, you may have trouble. Some of the special 
characters in your password may not be on the keyboards you find there, 
and the ones that are present may be in unfamiliar locations on the local 
keyboards. And, typing special characters on handheld devices, such as the 
iPhone, can be a pain.
Making passwords memorable
Remembering passwords that contain special characters can be easier if 
you use short nicknames for the special characters. Table 10-1 offers some 
suggestions.

 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
Tell me a story
One way to memorize a random password is to make up a story that goes with 
the letters and symbols. For example, to remember the following password
l!30c;tF
you might make up a story about hearing one bang when you were 30 and 
seeing a winking tall fighter. I have a Google spreadsheet online that converts 
ten random letters into a memorable sentence. For example, twpxjrufhc 
converts to “Tom’s wild peacocks expertly join rude uncles finding happy 
comfort.” The sentence is just to aid memory. You use the ten characters as 
your password. You’ll find a link to the spreadsheet at DitchMyPC.com.
Permitting Password Assistant to assist
The phrase pick at random is easier said than done. Computers are designed to 
do the same thing every time you run a program. Most computer programming 
languages include “random number generator” functions that aren’t truly 
random. Better operating systems, including OS X and Windows, have ways 
of making things truly random, measuring exactly how long it takes hard 
drive arms to move, for example. Unfortunately, many programs on the 
Internet that claim to make random passwords don’t use these tools.
OS X includes its own password generator: Password Assistant. It’s designed 
to help you pick passwords for your Mac OS X accounts, but you can use it 
for other purposes. Here’s one way to do that:
The true meaning of password points
You may be wondering what these points I keep 
talking about represent. Or not — in which case, 
feel free to skip this sidebar. The points I’m 
using refer to the concept of entropy, and in the 
technical literature, the points are bits. Entropy 
measures how random things are; the concept 
goes back to the 19th century, when scientists 
were trying to figure out how to make better 
steam engines. One bit or point is the amount of 
randomness introduced by flipping a fair coin. 
The formula I use to assign points to passwords 
was discovered by the great physicist Ludwig 
Boltzmann and is carved on his tombstone.

1. Open Keychain Access; it’s in the Utilities folder, inside the 
Applications folder.
 
2. Click the plus sign near the bottom to create a new entry.
 
 You don’t have to save your new password in Keychain, but you can if 
you want. This is just one way to reach Password Assistant.
 
 
3. Click the Key icon next to the Password field.
 
 
 The Password Assistant window appears, as shown in Figure 10-2.

 For an explanation of the other options, see the nearby sidebar 
“Ordering up passwords from Password Assistant.”
 
5. If you want your password to be a particular length, move the Length 
slider.
 
 See the section “How long does it have to be?” later in this chapter, for 
details about how password length affects security.
 
6. After you select the password you want from the Suggestion field, 
write it down or save it in Keychain — or both.
 
7. To save your new password in Keychain, fill out the Keychain Item 
Name and Account Name fields and click the Add button. Otherwise, 
click the Cancel button.
 
If you use computers a lot, you’ll face the need to come up with a new pass-
word from time to time, often in situations when you’re in a bit of a hurry. If 
you click the arrow next to the Suggestion field, Password Assistant shows 
you a list of candidate passwords. Write down a bunch on a slip of paper and 
carry it in your wallet so that you always have a few handy.

 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
Finding other ways to pick 
random passwords
Be leery of password-picking programs you find while perusing the Internet. 
Many are poorly written, and it’s hard to tell which ones do an acceptable 
job. The password managers I mention earlier in this chapter are good. 
Here’s a link to a password generator I wrote and trust: www.theworld.
com/~reinhold/passgen.html.
One way to guarantee that your password is random is to select the letters 
one at a time, using ordinary, six-sided dice:

 ✓ Memorable offers passwords made up 
of two dictionary words separated by a 
number and a special character; for exam-
ple, rig25{laden. They’re good for 
medium-level security with a strength in the 
40- to 45-point range. Longer passwords of 
this type aren’t much stronger, so pick one 
about 12 characters long.
 ✓ Letters & Numbers mixes uppercase and 
lowercase letters and digits; for example, 
io5ItCqm8N. Used that way, the pass-
words are worth almost 6 points per letter. 
If you don’t want to mess with the Shift 
key, make all the letters the same case, in 
which case their worth drops to 5.2 points 
per letter. This number isn’t much of a loss, 
but remember to type your single-case ver-
sion: io5itcqm8n. Don’t cut and paste 
from Password Assistant.
 ✓ Numbers only is handy for picking new 
personal identification numbers (PINs) for 
credit cards and so on, but you need a long 
number for a strong password. Digits are 
worth 3.3 points each.
 ✓ Random uses all characters on the key-
board and produces passwords that look 
like G!0chN6-j2. Score 6.5 points per 
character.
 ✓ FIPS-181 compliant makes up letter-only 
passwords that are relatively easy to 
pronounce, such as voofyaidia. The 
method used is specified in a U.S. gov-
ernment Federal Information Processing 
Specification; hence the name. FIPS-181 
passwords are worth 4 points per letter.

2. Use the two numbers you roll to pick a character from Table 10-2.
 
 Use the die that lands to the left to pick the row and use the other die to 
pick the column. (Yes, die is the singular of dice.) So, rolling a 3, 5 adds 
the letter q to your password.
 
3. Keep rolling and picking letters or numbers from the table until the 
password is the length you’re looking for.

How long does it have to be?
Your password, that is. As with other size questions, this one generates 
much controversy. Here are some guidelines I think are reasonable for most 
users:
 
✓ Low security doesn’t require much to achieve. An 8-character Password 
Assistant Memorable password does fine. Or, you can recycle an old, 
inactive password you remember well, as long as you haven’t used it in 
a while and it isn’t similar to others you use.
 
✓ Medium security doesn’t stop a determined and skilled attacker, but the 
attacker will probably go pick on someone else who’s an easier mark. 
I suggest at least 46 points, a 7-character Password Assistant Random 
password, 10 random letters, or a 12-character FIPS-181 pronounceable 
password — breaking it into two words may make it easier to remember. 
(If you’re unsure what the points mean, see the section “Scoring a 
password,” earlier in this chapter.)
 
✓ High security is an open-ended concept, but I suggest at least 56 points, 
a 9-character Password Assistant Random password, or 11 random 
letters and numbers.

213
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
 
✓ Cryptovariable passwords are for programs that turn your password 
into an encryption key. Most applications that employ passwords use 
them as gatekeepers. Know the password, and you’re allowed access to 
the computer or program in question. But some passwords work harder. 
They’re used as the key or cryptovariable in an encryption algorithm. 
Examples of passwords that need cryptovariable strength include
 
• WPA and WPA2 wireless network passwords
 
• Your OS X master password
 
• FileVault passwords
 
• Passwords for encrypted e-mail
 
• Passwords of other disk-encryption schemes
 
 For cryptovariable applications, people often use passphrases rather 
than passwords. A passphrase is longer and often made up of words 
selected at random, on the theory that a sequence of words is easier to 
memorize than a long sequence of letters. See www.diceware.com for 
suggestions for picking a strong but memorable passphrase using dice.
 
 Cryptovariable passwords should have at least 65 points. This requirement 
can be met with a 10-character Password Assistant Random password, 
14 random letters, or a 5-word Diceware passphrase.
 
✓ Windows passwords: If you continue to use your Windows computer 
along with your Mac, know that a longstanding security flaw exists in 
Windows XP and earlier versions of Windows, having to do with support 
for the old network standard LAN Manager. You can turn off LAN 
Manager (and it’s a good idea), but you can avoid the problem entirely 
by using passwords that are at least 15 characters long.
Hardening OS X
Out of the box, OS X offers good security. But you can do a number of things — 
besides picking good passwords — to make it even stronger. Read on for 
details about using FileVault, making encrypted volumes, and using other 
security tricks and tips.
Locking up your data with FileVault
With FileVault, OS X can encrypt each user account. All the data associated 
with that user is scrambled using the widely accepted AES-128 cipher.

214
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
Using FileVault is an excellent idea if you store sensitive data and you travel 
with a laptop, or if many people have access to your computer. Microsoft has 
a similar feature, BitLocker, but it’s available only in the more expensive 
versions of Vista and Windows 7.
 
Encryption slows hard drive access somewhat and may affect tasks that 
involve a lot of data, such as movie editing or Photoshop work, and it makes 
restoring files backed up by Time Machine more awkward. One compromise 
is to have two user accounts — one with FileVault for sensitive work and the 
other without FileVault protection for work where processing speed matters.
To turn on FileVault for a user, follow these steps:
 
1. Log on as that user.
 
 If you like, you can turn on FileVault while creating a new account — 
you see a check box to select. See the section on setting up additional 
accounts in Chapter5.
 
2. Select Ú➪System Preferences and click the Security icon.
 
3. Click the FileVault tab at the top, if it isn’t already highlighted.
 
 You see the FileVault setup window, shown in Figure 10-3.
 
Figure 10-3: 
The 
FileVault 
setup 
window.
 
 
4. If you haven’t already done so, set a master password for your Mac by 
clicking the Set Master Password button.
 
 This step allows you to recover data for any FileVault user who has 
forgotten his password. Knowing the master password also lets you 
reset any user’s login password.

215
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
 
5. Choose a cryptovariable-level password, as described in the section 
“How long does it have to be?” earlier in this chapter, and write down 
that password.
 
 You can call up Password Assistant to help you choose this password 
by clicking the Key icon next to the password entry field.
 
6. Because FileVault encrypts your home directory by using your login 
password, your account should have a high-security-level password. 
If you need to change your login password, select Ú➪System 
Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
 
7. Change your login password. Log out and log back in to make sure 
that everything is working.
 
8. After you have a master password set and you like your login password, 
return to the System Preferences Security pane and click the Turn On 
FileVault button.
 
 Depending on how much data is in your home directory, the initial 
encryption process can take awhile. If you’re working on your laptop, 
plug in the charger. If you already have sensitive info stored in your 
account, select the Secure Erase check box to ensure that OS X obliterates 
the unencrypted data when it’s done encrypting.
 
When you log out of a FileVault account, OS X often asks your permission to 
tidy up and recover some unused space. Say Yes only if you have time and 
battery power for the operation to complete. Otherwise, tell OS X to wait.
Making an encrypted volume
If you have some data you want to protect but don’t want to go to the bother 
of encrypting your entire user directory, you have another option: Create an 
encrypted disk image. This file looks like a disk volume when you open it. 
It looks much like the volume typically created when you download an 
application program. It even has the same .dmg extension, but you need a 
password to open it.
To create an encrypted volume, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the Utilities folder in your Applications folder and open Disk 
Utility.
 
2. Choose File➪New➪New Blank Image.
 
3. Pick a size for your volume that’s large enough for everything you 
plan to store in it, with room to spare.

216
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
 If you keep the volume size below 700MB, the encrypted volume fits on a 
CD-R, in case you choose to back it up that way; 4.38GB can fit on a 
DVD-R.
 
4. Give the volume a name, such as Super Secret War Plans or Recipes.
 
5. Select AES-128 Encryption.
 
6. Click the Create button.
 
7. When prompted, enter a password.
 
 If you click the small Key icon, Password Assistant appears and offers 
suggestions. See the sidebar “Ordering up passwords from Password 
Assistant,” earlier in this chapter, for more on using this feature and for 
password selection in general.
 
8. If you don’t want OS X to store the password in Keychain, deselect the 
Remember Password check box.
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
The security features in OS X use an algorithm, 
the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), for 
scrambling data. AES was selected by the U.S. 
National Institute of Standards and Technology 
(NIST) in 2001 after a lengthy public competi-
tion. The winning design was submitted by two 
Belgian researchers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan 
Daemen. AES is a block cipher: It takes data in 
128-bit chunks and scrambles it into another 
128 bits. The exact way it scrambles the data 
is determined by another block of digital data, 
called a key or cryptovariable. AES comes in 
three flavors, with 128-, 192-, or 256-bit keys. 
Apple uses the 128-bit version. Although it 
didn’t participate in the original design and 
selection, the U.S. National Security Agency 
has stated that the AES cipher can be used 
to protect classified information; the 128-bit 
version, which Apple uses, is approved for 
information at the Secret level. That doesn’t 
mean that you can use Macs to take home 
classified documents. The NSA has a stringent 
approval process for devices used to store and 
transmit such data — you must consider a lot 
more than the strength of the codes. But it’s a 
strong vote of confidence in AES.
A stronger version of AES doesn’t add security 
if you’re using a password as a key, unless the 
password has a comparable number of bits. 
Here’s what a 192 bit-strength password looks 
like:
erdl ubym 09ie u9fj lbg9 f4dd 7s1t 
zwmi 6iyd0
If you’re not willing to use such a long pass-
word, don’t expect more “bits” in the cipher to 
add security.

217
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
Enhancing your Mac’s security
Besides choosing good passwords, you can do a number of things to make 
your Mac even more secure.
Setting safer settings
Select Ú➪System Preferences. Click the Security icon and then click the 
System tab. You see the window shown in Figure 10-4. You can select several 
check boxes to enhance your Mac’s security, usually at the price of some 
minor added inconvenience in operation. Here’s a rundown of the check 
boxes and what they mean for your security:
 
Figure 10-4: 
The OS X 
Security 
settings 
window.
 
 
✓ Require Password X Minutes after Sleep or Screen Saver Kicks In: A 
common security problem is the unattended machine: You go get a cup 
of cappuccino and someone sits down at your computer and does as 
she pleases. Selecting this check box and, perhaps, the Log Out after xx 
Minutes of Inactivity check box can help prevent this situation, but you 
have to type your password a lot.
 
✓ Disable Automatic Login: Select this check box if you care about 
security. If you don’t select it, the computer automatically logs on to 
the primary account without asking for a password every time you (or 
anyone else) restarts it.

218
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
✓ Require Password to Unlock Each System Preferences Pane: If many 
people share your computer (your kids, in particular) and you want to 
retain strict control, select this check box. Otherwise, don’t bother.
 
✓ Use Secure Virtual Memory: If you plan to use FileVault, select this 
check box. Your Mac sometimes writes temporary information to disk to 
free more of its main memory. Because this temporary information can 
contain sensitive information, you want it encrypted, too. This option 
slows things down a bit.
 
✓ Disable Remote Control Infrared Receiver: Someone with a remote 
could have your computer display images you’d rather not share. If this 
prospect frightens you, select this check box.
Keeping up to date with Software Update
Computer security is a moving target. Researchers and hackers are constantly 
finding holes in software. And new revisions of software intended to add 
features can also inadvertently introduce new security bugs. Apple works 
hard to correct problems and periodically distributes corrections over the 
Internet. Out of the box, your Mac checks for available updates weekly. To 
check now, select Ú➪Software Update. You can change how often automatic 
checking occurs by selecting Ú➪System Preferences and clicking the 
Software Update icon. This is also the place to check which updates have 
already been installed, if you care.
Securing your e-mail
If you use programs such as Pretty Good Privacy (PGP, from www.pgp.com), 
Gnu Privacy Guard (GnuPG from macgpg.sourceforge.net), or Hushmail.
com to encrypt and electronically sign e-mail, you’ll be glad to know that Mac 
versions of these programs are available.
Remember to transfer your PGP keyrings with the rest of your files. Make 
sure that everything is working properly before disposing of your PC.
Watching out for phishing
As a PC user, you undoubtedly encounter phishing, or sending e-mail messages 
that look like legitimate requests from upstanding organizations. The message 
includes a link that opens what seems like the Web site of that organization, 
where you’re asked to enter your account number, password, and any other 
personal info they think you can be conned into surrendering. If you have any 
doubt that the message is phony, do not click the link in the message. Go to 
the organization’s Web site by typing its URL in your browser’s address field 
and navigate to your account.

219
 Chapter 10: Staying Secure in a Connected World
Locking it up
Computer security is almost meaningless without physical security. If a 
sophisticated attacker gets to spend quality time alone with your Mac, all the 
fancy technology may be of no avail. Laptops are easier to steal than desktop 
machines, but they’re also easier to lock in a desk or safe. All Mac laptops 
and the Mac mini have a hole in the side, designed to accept a mechanical 
locking device, such as those made by Kensington.
Another cheap thing to do is to record your computer’s serial number. 
Select About This Mac from the Apple menu. The serial number is listed in 
the hardware Overview section. Write down the number and keep it in your 
wallet, with a copy at home. You need the serial number in order to file a 
police report if your laptop is lost or stolen. You should also mark your 
computer with your name and address. You can place an address label inside 
your laptop’s battery compartment. A colored sticker on the outside of your 
laptop makes it harder for a thief at the airport to hide in a crowd.
Securing empty trash and 
erasing free space
 
If you store sensitive data on your computer, particularly on a laptop, get in the 
habit of selecting Finder➪Secure Empty Trash whenever you want to empty the 
Trash. It’s the Mac equivalent of the Windows Recycle Bin, the place where files 
are moved when you delete them. Otherwise, your data remains in unassigned 
areas of your hard drive until the operating system needs that space to store 
something else. With today’s large hard drives, that may be never.
The Secure Empty Trash option can take a while if you’re deleting large files, 
and even if you’re careful to use it all the time, you should write over all the 
free space on your hard drive every so often. Apple supplies a tool for doing 
this, which works as follows:
 
1. Open Disk Utility.
 
 It’s in the Utilities folder, inside the Applications folder.
 
2. Select your hard drive and then click or select the Erase Free Space 
button.
 
3. Choose one of the three overwrite options.
 
 The default option, which overwrites all free disk space with 0s just 
once, can take an hour or more — longer if your disk is big and relatively 
empty. The 7-pass method can take overnight, and the 35-pass method 
for the paranoid can take a couple of days.

220
Part III: Connecting Hither and Yon 
 
 I suggest using the default one-pass method, unless you’re clearing an 
older hard drive — one with a capacity of 15GB or less. Current guidelines 
for the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST Special 
Publication 800-88) say that modern high-capacity drives “can be effectively 
cleared by one overwrite.” I’ve also talked to someone at a major data 
recovery company, and it can’t retrieve files that have been overwritten 
even once. For older drives, do the 7-pass erase — on a smaller, older 
drive, 7 passes won’t take long. If the security provided by overwriting 
isn’t enough, your best option is physical destruction. See the section in 
Chapter 6 on safely destroying your PC hard drive.
Checking checksums
Security-related programs are often distributed with a checksum or hash 
that lets you verify that the program you received hasn’t been modified — a 
good practice. Two types of checksums are widely used: md5 and sha1. OS 
X can compute either type by using the Unix command line in the Terminal 
window. (See Chapter 19.) The command for md5 is just md5, followed by a 
space, followed by the file path. For sha1, type the command openssl sha1, 
followed by a space, followed by the file path.
 
Drag the file’s icon to the Terminal window, and the file path is filled in 
automatically.
Virus protection?
Coming from the Windows world, you may feel 
naked without a virus-protection program. At 
the time this book was written, no reported OS X 
viruses were in circulation — the buzz phrase is 
in the wild. However, although Apple has done a 
good job with OS X security, no one claims that 
it’s perfect, and Apple market share is increas-
ing, making it an ever more tempting target for 
virus writers. Several PC antivirus companies 
offer programs for OS X and, of course, if you 
install Windows on your Mac and plan to con-
nect it to the Internet, you should install a PC 
antivirus program for Windows in that partition. 
Based on the current situation, I think you can 
hold off buying a Mac antivirus program as 
long as you check Software Update regularly, 
keep an eye on at least one independent Mac 
information Web site, and hang on to your 
PC-user caution about installing strange 
software.
One exception is if you regularly exchange 
files created in Microsoft Office. One class of 
virus uses the Office macro feature, and a few 
of those viruses can infect Macs if they’re run-
ning versions of Office earlier than the 2008 ver-
sion. More likely, you can spread a virus you got 
from one user to others in your office. The major 
antivirus vendors sell versions for the Mac. A 
free antivirus program for the Mac, ClamXav, 
is available from www.clamxav.com. It’s 
based on the open source antivirus project 
ClamAV.

acs come with a ton of software. I introduce the 
Apple iLife digital lifestyle suite and discuss other 
software that comes with your Mac. These programs are 
simple, but powerful and fun to use. They let you buy and 
listen to music, manage your photo collection, edit your 
videos, make your own music, and put your creations on 
the World Wide Web. And, because they come from Apple, 
all the programs play well together. But if you’re a long-
time Windows user, there’s likely to be an application in 
Windows that you miss. You have several options for 
running Windows on your Mac. I discuss them in the last

f you have an iPod, you already know about iTunes. It’s the lone 
program from the iLife collection that’s available for Windows PCs, and 
it’s absolutely necessary to use an iPod. Many Windows users who don’t own 
iPods use iTunes as their music player. The short story is that iTunes on the 
Mac is pretty much the same as iTunes in Windows.
iTunes is a program for organizing and playing media — including music, 
video, and podcasts — on your Mac. If you have an iPod that you used

Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
The Magical iPod
If you don’t own an iPod or iPhone but you still love music, find something 
to use as a bookmark here while you go to the store and buy one. It’s the 
greatest improvement in recorded music since the introduction of high 
fidelity in the 1950s. Owning an iPod welds music to your personal space. It 
becomes something you always have with you. William Congreve got it right 
in The Mourning Bride, back in 1697 (reportedly while attending an early Vista 
planning meeting):
Musick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast,
To soften Rocks, or bend a knotted Oak.
I’ve read, that things inanimate have mov’d,
And, as with living Souls, have been inform’d,
By Magick Numbers and persuasive Sound.
The iPod isn’t just a digital accessory — it informs our living souls.
Yes, an iPod can do other things. It can serve as a utilitarian portable hard 
drive, an older sibling to the flash drive. And, the spiffy video model can store 
(or play) movies, TV programs, music videos, games, and your photograph 
collection. An iPod is also helpful for listening to podcasts and recorded 
books. The iPhone and iPod touch can do pretty much anything a computer 
can do, and then some. But the ability to add one’s favorite music to the 
unavoidable humdrum of the day — that’s life changing.
Digital rights management and iTunes Plus
In the past, music sold over the Internet has 
been protected by digital rights management 
(DRM) technology, which encrypts the music 
data and allows play only on authorized devices. 
The Apple iTunes Store now sells music without 
DRM restrictions. Such files aren’t subject to the 
five-computer limit, and they can be played on 
any music player, not just on iPods. However, 
TV shows, movies, and software are still sub-
ject to DRM restrictions. Also, if you bought 
music from iTunes before 2009, it’s likely to be 
protected by DRM. Apple allows you to remove 
the DRM encoding for 30 cents per song or 30 
percent of an album’s price. Remove the DRM 
by selecting Upgrade to iTunes Plus on the 
iTunes Store home page.
When you’re ready to ditch the PC, I suggest 
you disassociate your PC from your iTunes 
library. Only authorized computers can play 
restricted media that you’ve purchased from 
the iTunes Store, and Apple limits the number of 
computers you can associate with your library. 
These restrictions don’t affect the newer DRM-
free music, but you might as well disassociate 
your old PC while it’s still running. For the steps, 
see “Managing authorizations in iTunes,” later 
in this chapter.

225
 Chapter 11: Easy Listening with iTunes 
Getting Started with iTunes
When you first open iTunes, you have a few setup tasks to complete. The first 
is completing the Setup Assistant, which lets you make iTunes your default 
music player. If you use iTunes on your PC, be sure to step through the section 
on importing your iTunes collection on your new Mac, later in this chapter. 
If you’re new to iTunes, check out the tips on playing with iTunes, which 
explain a few basic tasks you need to know to work in the iTunes program.
Setting up iTunes
When you first get your Mac, you need to follow a fairly simple setup process 
to organize all your music. Follow these steps:
 
1. Double-click iTunes, either on the Dock or in the Applications folder.
 
2. Work through the Setup Assistant, which offers to have iTunes 
handle audio content from the Internet, making it your audio-helper 
application.
 
 Unless you downloaded other audio software, the alternative is to use 
Apple QuickTime.
iTunes then offers to search your home folder for MP3 and AAC music files. 
If you have transferred a bunch over from your PC, this is an opportunity to 
get them all organized by iTunes. Always double-check that you have backed 
up all the files. You can easily add them later, if you prefer. See the section 
“Importing your iTunes collection,” later in this chapter, for details.
iTunes then offers to take you to the iTunes Store. The next section introduces 
you to the store.
Importing your iTunes collection
If you already have a collection of music and videos on your PC, copy the 
files from your PC to the Mac. (See Chapter 6.) Did that already? Then you 
may need to follow these steps:
 
1. On your Mac, open iTunes and choose File➪Add to Library.
 
2. Find the folder that contains all the music and video files you copied 
to your Mac.

226
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
3. Click the Choose button.
 
 iTunes on the Mac adds the PC files to its library, all neatly organized 
the way you had them. However if you had any .wma files you need 
additional software to play them. Inexpensive solutions that you can 
download are available from Flip4mac.com and easywma.com.
 
If your PC is so hosed that you can’t recover your iTunes library and you 
don’t have a backup, you still have hope. Apple allows you to transfer from 
your iPod to another computer the music you previously purchased from the 
iTunes Store. In iTunes, choose File➪Transfer Purchases from iPod.
Two freeware programs, Ollie’s iPod Extractor and Senuti, are also available 
to copy any songs from your iPod to your Mac, without duplicating the ones 
that are already there. Find them in a Google search or try your favorite 
download site.
Managing authorizations in iTunes
As I mention earlier in this chapter, the Apple digital rights management 
scheme lets you have DRM-protected media you purchased on iTunes 
playable on as many as five computers at any time. If you’re planning to keep 
your PC for a while and you aren’t close to the five-computer limit, you can 
leave the PC authorized.
To authorize your Mac, just try to play one of your purchased songs. iTunes 
asks for your Apple ID and password. Be sure to enter the ones you used to 
purchase the song. You have to do this task for one purchased song.
When you’re ready to get rid of your Windows PC, be sure to deauthorize it 
first by following these steps:
 
1. Open iTunes on your PC.
 
2. Choose Store➪Deauthorize Computer.
 
3. Select Deauthorize Computer for Apple Account.
 
4. Enter your Apple ID and password and confirm your intentions.
 
Apple determines a Windows computer’s identity by looking at a number of 
factors, including the amount of RAM and the hard drive size, so don’t mess 
with these before you deauthorize your PC. (Macs have a hardware serial 
number, so changing the hard drive or adding RAM, for example, doesn’t 
affect things.)

227
 Chapter 11: Easy Listening with iTunes 
If your PC is so messed up that you can’t run iTunes to deauthorize, or if you 
just forgot to do it before you ditched the PC, it stays on the list of machines 
that count against your five-computer limit. However, you have an escape 
valve. When you reach the point where you have used up all five slots, you can 
blow them all away and reauthorize the computers you still want by playing 
a purchased song on each of them. However, Apple limits you to resetting the 
authorized computer list only once a year. To reset the list, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose View My Account from the iTunes Store menu.
 
2. Enter your password.
 
 If you’ve reached the five-computer limit and you haven’t exercised this 
option in the past 12 months, you should see a Deauthorize All button 
on the Account Information screen.
 
3. Click the Deauthorize All button.
 
4. Play a song on each computer that you want to authorize.
Playing with iTunes
After you transfer your library to the Mac, it’s time to enjoy your music and 
other media files in their new home. You won’t find things much different 
from iTunes on your PC. If you’re new to iTunes, here are a few popular tasks 
to help you get started:
 
✓ To sync your iPod to your iTunes library: Just plug its cable into a USB 
port on the Mac that has the library stored on it. You can sync to only 
one iTunes library.
 
✓ To create a new play list: Click the plus icon (+) at the bottom of the 
iTunes sidebar.
 
✓ To add a tune to your playlist: Simply drag it from the music list to the 
play list entry in the sidebar.
 
✓ To create a mix disc: Insert a blank writable CD and choose File➪Burn 
Playlist to Disc.
Filling iTunes with Music and More
You can fill your iTunes library in a few different ways. The iTunes Store 
is the hub for the many types of content iTunes can play, including music, 
movies, TV shows, and podcasts. Adding music on a CD to iTunes is easy, 
too. The following sections explain the more popular options.

Shopping the iTunes Store
When you first start iTunes, it opens the front window of the iTunes Store. 
If iPod has revolutionized the way we listen to music, the iTunes Store has 
revolutionized the way it is sold.
Notice that I said sold, not distributed. Only a small fraction of the songs 
in iTunes (or played on iPods) have been purchased through the iTunes 
Store. Much of it comes from compact discs that people already own and 
simply copy into iTunes. The rest comes from file-sharing programs such as 
BitTorrent and Lime Wire.
It seems that the recording industry didn’t think through all the implica-
tions when it switched to CDs from the older vinyl LP records, the kind with 
a wiggly spiral groove that made a needle vibrate to reproduce sound. After 
computers and the Internet became fast enough, the digital data on CDs was 
too easily copied and shared.
Apple figured that many people would do the right thing and buy their music, 
instead of downloading it for free, if the price was right and the process was 
convenient enough. Users have downloaded more than 6 billion songs from 
the iTunes Store, and it ranks among the top three music retailers in the 
United States. Amazon.com now sells DRM-free MP3 music as well.
To get to the iTunes Store, open iTunes and click iTunes Store in the sidebar. 
You see a screen similar to that shown in Figure 11-1, with ads for various 
offerings and a list on the left of different types of content that are for sale. 
The following steps walk you through the store:
 
1. Click the Sign In button in the upper-right corner.
 
2. If you already have an Apple account (for example, if you use iTunes 
on your PC), enter your account name and password.
 
 Otherwise, click the Create New Account button and have your credit 
card handy. After you complete the signup process, you can move to 
Step 3.
 
3. Browse by genre or use the search box in the upper-right corner of the 
iTunes window.
 
 The iTunes Store has a huge selection of recorded music, but Apple 
makes it easy to find what you want. Search results appear in the lower 
half of the iTunes window, and you can sort by genre, title, artist, album, 
popularity, price, or running length. Just click the headings in the listing.
 
 If you double-click a song’s entry in the list, you hear a 30-second selection 
from the song.

Store front

4. To purchase a song or other item, click the Buy button, and you’re 
asked for your password.
 
 The song, album, or other item is automatically downloaded to your 
Mac and then to your iPod the next time you plug it in.
Apple has tried to make shopping simple at the iTunes Store by having an 
easy-to-understand price structure, but pressure from content owners has 
forced Apple to allow greater variation in pricing. In return, Apple is eliminating 
digital rights management (DRM) restrictions on downloaded music — 
though not on other content, such as movies and TV programs. At the time I 
write this book, songs cost 69 cents, 99 cents, or $1.29 apiece; TV shows are 
$1.99; and 30-day movie rentals are $3.99 for current hits and $2.99 for older 
flicks. Music albums, complete TV seasons and feature movies can range 
from $8 to $15 and up. High definition versions of TV programs and movies 
are often available for an additional charge.
Another big category on the iTunes store is applications for the iPhone and 
iPod Touch. Many are free; others range in price from 99 cents to $10 and 
more. The app store has been a runaway success with over 30,000 application 
titles and 1 billion downloads in the first nine months. You can even buy 
games for your older video iPod.

Copying CDs to iTunes
If you’ve never used iTunes, you’ll want to add some music. If you own music 
CDs, you can add them to the iTunes library by simply sliding them into 
your Mac’s CD/DVD slot. iTunes should open automatically, but if it doesn’t, 
launch it in the usual way by double-clicking its icon. iTunes copies the files 
from the CD to its library while it plays the CD for you. The CD doesn’t take 
as long to copy as it does to play, however, so you can stop the music when 
iTunes says the transfer is done.
The AAC compression scheme is used by default when iTunes imports CDs. 
You can change to another format, such as MP3, by following these steps:
 
1. Select Preferences from the iTunes menu.
 
2. Click the General icon and then the Import Settings button.
 
3. Choose the import format you prefer.
 
 Your choices are AAC, AIFF, Apple Lossless, MP3, and WAV.
 
 You can change many other options in the iTunes preferences, including 
playback options, such as subtitles and closed captioning, and setting 
parental controls for younger users.
Adding video to iTunes (and an iPod)
Transferring video is another matter. Of course, video you download from 
the store isn’t a problem. But you can’t simply put a movie DVD into your 
Mac and transfer the movie to view on your iPod. Movie DVDs have copy 
protection, whereas music CDs generally do not. You have to do two things 
to make such a transfer possible:
 
✓ Extract the movie from the DVD in an unencrypted format.
 
✓ Convert the file to one of the video formats that the iPod can understand.
Software is available that can perform each step. A Google search on DVD to 
iPod should find several resources. The first step involves getting past the 
copy protection on the DVD. The movie industry says that’s illegal, though 
others say you should have the right to view DVDs you own any way you 
want.
Video that isn’t copy protected, such as your home movies, must still be 
converted to an iPod-friendly format. One way to do this is to use iMovie, 
already installed on your Mac. Select iPod from the iMovie Share menu. I tell 
you more about iMovie in Chapter 13.

231
 Chapter 11: Easy Listening with iTunes 
Subscribing to podcasts
Podcasts are talks, performances, or pretty much any kind of digital content 
that someone thinks someone else might be interested in. You can listen to 
podcasts on your computer, but what makes them special is that you can 
easily download them to your iPod or iPhone. Indeed, the introduction of the 
iPod made podcasts popular.
Podcasts can be just audio or they can be video. You find them in the iTunes 
Store by clicking Podcasts in the pane to the upper left of the main window. 
You find thousands of podcasts to choose from, on every imaginable topic, 
broken down into many categories. If you find one you like, you can automati-
cally have others in the series downloaded to your iPod as they appear by 
clicking the Subscribe button. Podcasts awaiting your attention are marked 
with a blue dot in the Podcast section of your library. Podcasts you’ve lis-
tened to lose the blue dot and are automatically removed the next time you 
sync your iPod unless you mark them as unread by right-clicking their names.
iTunesU
Wouldn’t it be nice if the top professors at the 
world’s greatest colleges recorded their lec-
tures as podcasts so that you can enjoy the 
best teaching the world has to offer as you 
commute to work or burn some calories on the 
treadmill? Well, they have, and you can. The 
Apple Store section iTunesU is chock-full of 
great talks and courses. Nothing but time and 
effort are required in order to benefit from the 
finest education the world’s universities have to 
offer. Of course, iTunesU doesn’t offer degrees 
and you miss the classroom camaraderie and 
beer parties in the dorms, but you don’t go into 
lifelong debt paying tuition bills, either. Courses 
in iTunesU are absolutely free.

Picturing iPhoto
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring your image collection to iPhoto
▶ Importing new photos from your camera
▶ Filing and editing photos with iPhoto
▶ Finding faces and mapping places
▶ Alternatives to iPhoto
O
nce upon a time, taking photographs involved buying a roll of film, 
loading it in a camera, shooting 24 or 36 pictures, taking the film out of 
the camera (don’t forget to rewind first!), taking the exposed film to a camera 
store or drugstore, waiting a day or so, picking up the pictures, selecting a 
few negatives to be copied or enlarged, sticking the rest in a shoebox until 
the day you have more free time to organize them (which birthday party was 
that, and who’s the guy next to Aunt Harriet?), and then pasting them into a 
photo album. More serious photographers experienced a long interlude in a 
dark room with red lights and temperature-controlled trays of smelly chemicals.
Except for those who truly love the film process — and there’s a lot to love — 
digital cameras have taken over photography. Good-quality digital cameras are 
inexpensive, and top-of-the-line models, which are becoming more affordable, 
rival the best film cameras for image quality. Try to buy a cellphone now that 
doesn’t have a camera. The one in the iPhone is a respectable 2 megapixels. 
You have no more film to buy — just AA batteries and maybe a memory card 
or two. And, that shoebox is now a hard drive. But you’re likely still waiting 
for the free time you need in order to organize your photos.
Wouldn’t it be helpful to have a program that can suck down photos from any 
camera as soon as you plug it in, keep shots organized according to when 
you took them, let you see a large swath of your collection spread out on 
the screen like a light table, and let you annotate and organize photos into 
albums and slideshows? Shouldn’t the program also display a slide show on 
your screen or television and maybe add music from your iTunes collection? 
And, why not allow you to ship those photos off for printing on your color 
printer or send them to a professional shop — and maybe even a place 
that will print a bound book of your photos so that you can have paste-free 
albums?

Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
That’s iPhoto in a nutshell. If you’ve used Google Picasa on your PC, you’re 
familiar with the concept. But with iPhoto, you have nothing to download: It’s 
waiting for you in the Applications folder. (If you love Picasa, you’ll be glad to 
know that it has a version for the Mac. We discuss it later in this chapter.)
Getting Started with iPhoto
If you own a digital camera, you most likely can use it with iPhoto. iPhoto 
supports most brands and models. You can check to see whether your model 
is supported by visiting the iPhoto Web site, www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto, 
or just shoot a few pictures and plug your camera into the appropriate USB 
or FireWire port.
 
When iPhoto first starts, it asks whether you want it to take over every time 
you plug in your camera. iPhoto knows about almost every digital camera out 
there. You could go to your camera manufacturer’s Web page to download its 
software, but why bother? Just say Yes.
You likely have many valuable images stored on your PC. You can move your 
collection from your PC to your Mac through iPhoto by importing photos. 
iPhoto adds your photos to its database and creates thumbnail versions 
for fast display. In the following sections, you find out what image files you 
can work with in iPhoto and the tips and how-tos you need to know before 
importing your image collection.
Checking out supported file types
iPhoto can read a wide variety of file types, including those listed in Table 12-1.
Table 12-1 
Image File Types Supported by iPhoto
BMP
FlashPix
GIF
JPEG/JFIF
MacPaint
Photoshop (with layers)
PICT
PNG
RAW
SGI
Targa 
TIFF
RAW is the native format for high-end digital cameras. iPhoto supports dozens 
of models. Visit support.apple.com/kb/HT1475 for the current list. A 
number of movie formats supported by still cameras are also handled nicely.

235
 Chapter 12: Picturing iPhoto 
iPhoto lets you export files in their original form or converted to JPEG, TIFF, 
or PNG format.
Setting up a successful import
 
iPhoto can store up to 250,000 photos — about 250 shoe boxes’ worth. 
But iPhoto has its own idea of how to store photos in its library. If you already 
have a large collection of digital photos, all organized in folders, you might 
want them kept that way. You can order iPhoto to do just that:
 
1. Select iPhoto➪Preferences.
 
2. Click the Advanced button.
 
3. Deselect the Copy Files to iPhoto Library Folder When Adding to 
Library check box.
 
4. Close the Preferences window.
Now whenever you import photos, iPhoto leaves them organized the way you 
had them in the folders you set up, rather than use the normal method of filing 
the photos by date. However, if you edit one of those photos within iPhoto, it 
saves the edited version in its library, leaving the original where it was.
Importing your photos
To import your photos to iPhoto, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy your PC photos to the Pictures folder.
 
2. Open iPhoto and choose File➪Import to Library.
 
3. Find the folder or folders with the photos you want to import and 
select them.
 
4. Click the Import button.
You can also just open iPhoto and drag the folder with your pictures to the 
iPhoto window.
 
You may want to experiment with bringing folders in one at a time to find the 
way of organizing the photos in iPhoto that works best for you. You might try 
the iPhoto folder import script at http://scriptbuilders.net/files/
iphotofolderimport1.0.html. Drag a folder that contains photos to this 
script’s icon and it imports all files in the folder and creates an appropriate 
folder and albums in iPhoto.

236
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
After you move all your photos from your PC into iPhoto, you should back up 
your OS X Pictures folder. If you enabled Time Machine, it does the backup for 
you. If not, or if you like the added security of having a backup in a separate 
place, copy your Pictures folder to a DVD-ROM or an external hard drive. For 
extra credit, find a safe place to store the backup that isn’t in your home — 
maybe your office, a safe-deposit box, or even a friend’s house. (A friend of 
mine’s house burnt down recently, and he lost much of his photo collection.) 
I cover various ways to back up data in Chapter 6. Having all your photos 
organized and safely backed up offsite is a great feeling.
Organizing the iPhoto Way
iPhoto has its own way of storing and organizing photos. You can choose to 
look at them in several ways, listed on the left side of the iPhoto window:
 
✓ Events: iPhoto groups all photos you take in a single day as an event 
that you can name. As you slide your mouse pointer across an event’s 
cover image (Apple calls it a key photo), you see all photos in the event, 
an effect that Apple calls skimming. You can move individual photos 
from one event to another by simply clicking and dragging. To merge 
two events, drag one event into the other. To split an event, open it by 
double-clicking, select the photo to begin the second half of the split, 
and click the Split button at the bottom of the screen.
 
✓ Photos: You see all your photos as though they were laid out on a light 
box. You can scroll through your entire library.
 
✓ Faces and Places: Apple has built face recognition into iPhoto and can 
organize your photos by who’s in them and where they were taken. 
More on Faces and Places later in this chapter.
 
✓ Albums: An album is a named set of photos. A photo can be in more 
than one album. The photo is stored only once, however, so having 
photos in more than one album doesn’t waste space. Albums work a lot 
like playlists in iTunes. To create a new album, choose File➪New Album 
or click the plus icon (+) in the lower-left corner. You add photos to an 
album by selecting and dragging them from the main display.
 
✓ Smart albums: A smart album contains photos based on search criteria 
you select. It works a lot like Spotlight. To make a smart album, choose 
File➪New Smart Album. Select your criteria, such as date in the range of 
12/24/2008 to 12/26/2008, from the dialog that appears, and click OK.
 
✓ Folders: Folders in iPhoto are a way to add organization to your collection. 
You create a new folder from the File menu. Folders can contain albums 
and other folders. They can also contain slide shows, books, calendars, 
and other iPhoto projects. Again, you can drag things into and out of 
a folder and move them around as you want. Items can be in only one 
folder, however.

237
 Chapter 12: Picturing iPhoto 
Viewing and sorting your photos
The main iPhoto display area, shown in Figure 12-1, shows small versions of 
your photos arranged on a dark background, much like a slide sorter from 
the film era. How small? The slider on the lower-right border of the iPhoto 
window lets you adjust the thumbnail size to suit your needs.
 
Figure 12-1: 
The main

display in 
Photo mode.
 
iPhoto offers a number of ways to see just what you want:
 
✓ Choose Photos in the sidebar, and all your photos are displayed.
 
✓ Click a folder or an album, and just those photos are shown.
 
✓ Choose View➪Sort Photos and then select one of the following options:
 
• By Event: This is the default view.
 
• By Date: The date is stored with the file when you import your photo.
 
• By Keyword: Add these tags to a photo by clicking the key icon 
in the lower-right corner of the window or pressing Ô+I. iPhoto 
comes with a simple set of keywords, but you can invent your own 
in iPhoto Preferences by clicking the Keyword tab.

238
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
• By Title: A photo’s title is the name or number given to it by your 
camera, but you can change the name by clicking the small I icon 
in the lower-right area of the window.
 
• By Rating: The By Rating sort doesn’t refer to how professional-
looking iPhoto thinks your photos are. You assign your own 
rating to photos, from one to five stars. It’s worth remembering 
the keyboard shortcuts. Select the photo or photos you want to 
rate and press Ô+1 for one star, Ô+2 for two stars — up to Ô+5 
for five stars. Pressing Ô+0 means no rating. If you forget, choose 
Photos➪My Rating. This menu choice has all the options and can 
remind you of the shortcuts.
 
• Manual: Move photos around by dragging them. This option is 
ideal for slide shows.
 
 You can also select the Ascending or Descending sort order.
Finding faces
iPhoto can help you organize your photos by faces they contain and where 
you were when you took them. This section explains how it all works.
First, lower your expectations. Apple face recognition technology is far from 
perfect, but it’s a big help if you have lots of photos of people. The technology 
has two parts: finding faces in images and assigning names to the individual 
faces. iPhoto is better at the first part than the second — you get a lot of 
wrong recognition matches, some weirdly inappropriate — but iPhoto makes 
it quite easy to correct wrong matches. And, yes, it can handle more than one 
face in an image.
To get started, follow these steps:
 
1. Click on a photo in your iPhoto library that has a good face shot of a 
person you want iPhoto to keep track of.
 
2. Click the Name button at the bottom of the iPhoto window.
 
 You see a white box around the face with a black label underneath.
 
3. Type the name of the person in the label.
 
 iPhoto tries to find a matching name in your Mac’s address book.
 
4. If iPhoto finds the right name, click it; otherwise, just finish typing the 
name you want to use for the person and then click that name when 
you’re done.
 
5. Click the small arrow (>) next to the person’s name.
 
 iPhoto shows you other photos it thinks may contain the same 
person’s face.

239
 Chapter 12: Picturing iPhoto 
 
6. Click Confirm Name at the bottom of the iPhoto window.
 
 iPhoto shows you just the face in each photo that it thinks is the same 
person, with the words click to confirm underneath.
 
7. Confirm or correct the names that iPhoto has matched with the faces.
 
 To confirm, click each correct face once. The person’s name appears 
under the face in green.
 
 To tell iPhoto it messed up, double-click a face and the name changes to 
red with the word not in front. If you’re not sure of an image, just leave it 
unclicked.
 
8. Review the photos you categorized. If you got one wrong, click the 
face to change from green to red or from red to green. When you have 
them all squared away, click Done.
 
 iPhoto may show you another batch of faces. Later batches tend to 
include more erroneous matches, but also many good calls. In a few 
minutes, you’ll have all photos of that individual tagged.
 
After you tag faces, you can click Faces in the sidebar to see a tile for each 
person you named. Double-click a tile to see all pictures in which you tagged 
someone.
Finding where in the world 
that picture was taken
Fancier digital cameras, including the one in the iPhone 3G, have a global 
positioning satellite (GPS) receiver and add location information to each 
image — a process known as geotagging. The geotag contains geographic 
coordinates, longitude, and latitude, but iPhoto knows how to read these 
geotags and translate the position into intelligible information, such as 
Boston or Paris. It even knows about popular spots where lots of pictures 
are taken, such as the USS Constitution or the Eiffel Tower.
To check out your photos’ geotags, follow these steps:
 
1. Click Places on the left side of the iPhoto window.
 
 You see a Google map of the world with pins showing the locations 
where you took the geotagged photos in your library.
 
2. Double-click near the pins to zoom in further — all the way down to 
street level.
If your camera lacks GPS or you have old photos that aren’t geotagged, you 
can add locations to individual photos or events because the shots made in a 
single day are often in the same locale. Follow these steps:

240
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
1. Click a photo or an event to select it and then click the small i button 
in the lower-right area.
 
 You see an information pane with space to type the location.
 
2. Enter a city name. Or, type an address and ask Google to look it up.
 
You can also name places that you use often, such as your home or a favorite 
campground. You can then use that name as a shortcut when geotagging your 
photos. In iPhoto, select Window➪Manage My Places and then click Google 
Search and enter the address.
Editing Your iPhotos
Even the best photographers appreciate the ability to adjust digital photos 
after checking how they turned out. Although iPhoto isn’t the most powerful 
photo editor, it comes with many tools for fine-tuning your photos.
When you select a photo in the main display and click Edit at the bottom 
of the window, iPhoto presents you with several editing icons, again at the 
bottom of its window, as shown in Figure 12-2. Unlike in higher-end editing 
programs, you aren’t given a bewildering array of tools and options. iPhoto 
gets right to the point.
You have these options:
 
✓ Rotate turns photos in 90-degree increments. The default is clockwise. 
You can select counterclockwise in the iPhoto➪Preferences dialog or 
press the Option key while clicking to see the opposite rotation.
 
✓ Crop selects the area of the photo you want to see using a gray overlay 
that you can move or adjust to size.
 
✓ Straighten lets you correct for a small tilt in your camera relative to the 
screen — up to plus or minus 10 degrees. A temporary grid overlays 
your photo to aid you in making the adjustment.
 
✓ Enhance applies filters that Apple thinks will generally do the right 
thing. They usually do.
 
✓ Red eye asks you to simply click the center of each eye in a portrait. 
iPhoto does the rest. This option doesn’t work on photos of cats or 
dogs.
 
✓ Retouch gets rid of scratches and dust marks. Just rub over them with 
the cursor.

241
 Chapter 12: Picturing iPhoto 
 
Figure 12-2:

options in 
iPhoto.
 
 
✓ Effects displays a matrix of image treatments, such as Antique, Black & 
White, Boost Color, Edge Blur, Fade Color, Matte, Sepia, and Vignette, 
with your original in the center. Pick one you like.
 
✓ Adjust shows a pane with sliders to control individual attributes such 
as exposure, contrast, saturation, definition, highlights, shadows, 
sharpness, noise, temperature, and tint.
 
No matter what you do to your photo, you can always undo it all: Choose 
Photo➪Revert to Original.
Sharing Photos in Slide Shows and Prints
What to do with all those photos? Why, show them to someone else, of 
course. iPhoto excels in having tools to share your images, including slide 
shows and easy ways to make prints.

242
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
The simplest way to share photos is online, on photo sharing sites or by 
e-mail:
 
✓ Photo sharing sites and communities: You can upload selected photos 
to your Facebook or Flickr account or to your Web Gallery on MobileMe, 
if you’re a subscriber, letting the world see your photos or protecting 
them with a password.
 
✓ E-mail: To share your photos with friends by e-mail, just click the Email 
icon at the bottom of the window. iPhoto asks you to select which photo 
size to send.
If you want a fancier way to share your photos, try slide shows, prints, or 
photo books. The following sections explain these options in more detail.
Spicing up photos with a slide show
At its simplest level, creating a slide show involves selecting a bunch of 
pictures and putting them in order to tell a story. In iPhoto, that’s just the 
beginning. Here’s how to create a slide show:
 
1. In iPhoto, select and arrange your photos in the main display.
 
2. Click the Slideshow icon at the bottom of the window.
 
 An icon for your new slide show appears in the sidebar — you can 
rename it — and Slideshow view appears in the main display.
 
3. Rearrange the thumbnails of the images that appear at the top, if you 
like.
 
 At the bottom are icons that allow you to add excitement to your show. 
You can select from a variety of transitions, or ways to change from one 
slide to the next.
 
4. If you like, select background music for your show from your iTunes 
library, GarageBand, or the sample selections supplied with iPhoto by 
clicking the Music icon in the lower-right corner of the window.
When you’re done, you can display your show onscreen, burn it to DVD, 
upload it to MobileMe, or use it in other ways such as podcasts or online 
presentations. See the Share menu for options.
Printing photos with iPhoto
Although slide shows and e-mail are handy, many people still appreciate 
photos they can hold in their hand. Until everyone carries a video iPod or 
iPhone, paper prints still have a role. To create prints, iPhoto offers the 
following options:

243
 Chapter 12: Picturing iPhoto 
 
✓ You can print photos on your color printer by choosing File➪Print.
 
✓ You can order professional prints for a fee over the Internet. Click the 
Order Prints icon in the lower-right corner.
 
✓ You can use iPhoto tools to make custom greeting cards, calendars, and 
album books from your photos. You can drag photos one at a time or 
ask iPhoto to “flow” a bunch of them into the template you select. Click 
the appropriate icon at the bottom of the iPhoto window to get started 
(refer to Figure 12-2).
Moving Up to Aperture
Apple sells a more advanced photo-management software package, named 
Aperture, shown in Figure 12-3, that’s aimed at professional photographers. 
It has more support for RAW images and can work with a much bigger photo 
library. It has more image-editing capabilities, but it can also integrate with 
Adobe Photoshop. You find tools to help you manage projects, including the 
ability to work with several versions of the same photo at a time. A handy 
image loupe magnifies a small area of the photo as you slide the loupe over 
the screen.
If you’re serious about photography and have invested big bucks in camera 
iron and glass, the $200 Aperture price tag shouldn’t be an obstacle to 
moving up.

The Picasa alternative
The Google Picasa photo management tool has 
long been popular on PCs. Perhaps you’ve been 
using it for your photos. The good news is that 
Google now has a version of Picasa for the Mac 
that you can download for free at http://
picasa.google.com/mac. Like its PC 
cousin, Picasa for the Mac leaves your photos 
where it finds them — unlike iPhoto, which 
prefers to move all your images to its library. 
When you first launch Picasa on your Mac, 
it goes through all photos on your hard drive, 
even those in your iPhoto library. You can then 
look through all your images by date and folder. 
You can also make simple image edits, fix red-
eye, make photo collages, and upload images 
to the online Google Picasa Web Albums. (A 
Google plugin lets you do this from iPhoto as 
well.) Google is extra careful with your iPhoto 
library, not making any changes but asking 
instead whether you want to store edited iPhoto 
images separately.
The only bad news, at least in the beta version 
that was available as I wrote this book, is that 
Google doesn’t provide a way for moving your 
Picasa collection from the PC to the Mac. Sure, 
you can move all your photos and Picasa will 
preserve their folders, but other organizational 
changes you might have made on the PC side, 
such as making albums, aren’t transferred.

▶ Editing your own movies with iMovie

▶ Making music and picking up an instrument with GarageBand
S
ome parts of what Apple calls the digital lifestyle appeal to most people 
who own a computer: surfing, sending and receiving e-mail, listening 
to music, organizing and viewing digital snapshots. But iLife also lets you 
do more exotic activities: edit and publish movies, create your own music 
and podcasts, and even learn to play an instrument. The Apple iMovie and 
GarageBand programs let anyone try their hand at these activities. What you 
do with these tools depends on you. I can only help you get started.
Producing Your Own Epic with iMovie
Great movies aren’t created in a studio or on location. They’re created in the 
editing room. The pioneering Russian filmmaker Lev Kuleshov proved the 
point by splicing a shot of a famous Russian actor between shots of a plate 
of soup, a girl at play, and an old woman in a coffin. It appeared that he was 
looking at each one. Audiences who were shown the short admired the 
different emotions that the actor displayed as he viewed each scene. But 
Kuleshov had used the same shot of the actor in each setting. The juxtaposition 
or montage created the strong emotion in the minds of the viewers.
For most of the 20th century, films were edited by cutting strips of film 
apart with a blade, arranging them artfully, and splicing them together to 
form the master image. Many specialized machines were invented to help 
in the cutting room. But no filmmaker in the first eight decades of motion 
pictures imagined the powerful editing capabilities that are supplied with 
your Macintosh for free, in the form of iMovie. Professional filmmakers now 
use still more capable software products. Apple makes one of the best, Final 

246
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
Cut, which I talk about later. But if you‘ve never edited film, the limitations of 
iMovie won’t hold you back for some time. As Walter Murch, who won three 
Oscars for editing and sound mixing, put it:
Film editing is now something almost everyone can do at a simple level 
and enjoy it, but to take it to a higher level requires the same dedication and 
persistence that any art form does.
By the way, Murch was honored with a fourth Oscar nomination for Cold 
Mountain, which he edited using Apple’s Final Cut Pro on a Macintosh G4, a 
wimpy machine compared to Macs now on sale.
Importing video from your camera
 
First things first: Make sure that you have enough hard drive space. Movies 
use lots of bits. Fifteen minutes of conventional video can occupy 3.2 to 10GB 
of space — the highest numbers apply if you’re shooting in high definition 
(HD). Remember that you need space for all the raw footage you plan to edit, 
not just for the final product. I suggest buying an external hard drive with at 
least a terabyte of storage for any large film-editing project you undertake. If 
your Mac has a FireWire port, buy a drive that includes a FireWire interface. 
FireWire offers better video performance than USB 2.0.
If you have some digital camcorder footage you want to edit, follow these 
steps to import it into iMovie and begin editing:
 
1. Connect your video camera to your Mac with the camera’s cable and 
put the camera in the proper mode (typically, PC Connect).
 
 You should see the iMovie Import window, and newer cameras present a 
list of clips. If not, select File➪Import from Camera.
 
2. Select the clips you want to import in Manual mode, or select 
Automatic in the Import window to import them all.
 
3. When you’re ready, click Import All or Import Checked.
 
 FireWire camcorders show additional controls that let you rewind and 
fast-forward to the segments you want to download.
 
4. Select the disk where you want the data stored and choose whether to 
add the video to an existing event or start a new one.
 
 iMovie automatically divides your video into separate clips by looking 
at the time codes recorded on the tape. Stills from the beginning of each 
clip, and roughly every 5 seconds thereafter, appear in the Clips pane 
in the bottom of the iMovie window, shown in Figure 13-1. You adjust 
the interval between stills with the slider in the lower-right corner. As 

247
 Chapter 13: Producing Movies and Music on Your Mac
you move the mouse pointer over each clip, you see it play and iMovie 
stores video clips in a common library, by event, as iPhoto does. You 
see a list of events stored in your library in the lower-left corner.
 
Figure 13-1: 
The begin-
ning stages 
of an iMovie 
project.
 
Importing video from your PC
If you have video you transferred from your PC, you can incorporate it into 
your iMovie project by using the File➪Import command. iMovie, which can 
accept any format that QuickTime understands, can work with high-definition 
video sources, including HDTV in 720p and 1080i formats.
One thing that vanilla QuickTime can’t understand is Microsoft Windows Media 
(.wmv) files. Plug-ins from flip4mac.com can usually solve this problem.
Finding other sources for video
You can use the following other sources to insert video into your iMovie:
 
✓ Built-in camera: Want to try out iMovie but you don’t own a digital 
camcorder? If you have a recent Apple laptop or iMac, you already have 
a built-in iSight camera, which you can use as an input source for iMovie. 
Just click the Camera icon on the central toolbar. iMovie shows you 
sitting in front of your keyboard, with a button that lets you start and 
stop recording from iSight. Lights, camera, action!

248
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
✓ A Webcam: Most FireWire Webcams and some newer USB Webcams work 
with iMovie. Many additional USB Webcams are supported using drivers 
available from the Macam project, (webcam-osx.sourceforge.net).
 
✓ iPhoto: Still photographs can be added to your iMovie project and 
animated by using the Ken Burns effect (see the nearby sidebar, “Ken 
Burns and his effect”). If your camera takes videos, you can grab those 
from iTunes as well.
 
✓ Internet video: A vast amount of video is available on the World Wide 
Web. Anything you download in a QuickTime-compatible format can 
be imported to iMovie. But be careful of copyright issues. (When I first 
typed the previous sentence, the fifth word read copyfight. That typo 
pretty much sums up what you want to avoid.)
Editing video in iMovie
Editing is where the fun begins. The following steps walk you through the 
basic process using iMovie:
 
1. Edit each clip to show just what you want to include in your movie.
 
 Click a clip, and an adjustable yellow box appears, showing the segment 
you selected.
 
2. Drag the clip to the project pane in the upper-left corner, placing clips 
in the order you like.
 
 You can use different segments from the same cut. If you just click a clip, 
iMovie selects a 4-second segment. To play a selected clip, press the 
spacebar.
 
3. Add sound, photos, titles, scene transitions, and animated maps by 
using the icons to the right of the central toolbar.
 
 Click an icon to see the options, and drag each one you want to your 
project window, placing them where you want them — even between 
clips.
 
 Sound sources include iTunes, two sets of prerecorded effects, and your 
Mac’s microphone. To record narration, click the microphone icon.
 
4. Continue editing your movie until the clips and effects are arranged 
the way you want.
 
 You can rearrange elements of your movie by dragging. Click an element 
to edit it and press Delete to remove it from the movie.
 
5. If you want to save your project, know that iMovie saves your project 
as you work on it.

249
 Chapter 13: Producing Movies and Music on Your Mac
 
 You can choose File➪Versions to save a checkpoint (the current version 
of your movie) so you can go back to it if your later edits mangle what 
you’ve done up to this point.
 
6. When your movie is ready, use the Share menu to transfer it to 
iTunes, an iPod, the Web, and more.
 
 One sharing option, DVDs, uses a separate iLife application that I talk 
about in “Burning Movies with iDVD” later in this chapter.
 
If your hand was a bit shaky when you took that once-in-a-lifetime shot, iMovie 
may be able to fix your precious video. Select one or more clips and choose 
File➪Analyze for Stabilization. (You’re also given this option when you import 
video from a camera, but the process can take quite a while, so you may be 
better off importing first and then stabilizing only the clips you want to use.)
Themes and precision editing
 
Like other iLife programs, iMovie comes with Apple-designed themes. Drag a 
bunch of clips to the project window. Rearrange them the way you like and 
pick a theme by choosing File➪Project Properties➪General and clicking the 
theme you want. iMovie then fills it in with your clips. You won’t win any 
awards for editing, but after just a few minutes of work, you have a serviceable 
movie complete with title and credits to share a special vacation or birthday 
party with family members and friends.
At the other extreme, iMovie gives you fine-grain control of each clip transi-
tion. Select Window➪Precision Editor (Ú-/) and iMovies replaces the bottom 
clip window with a screen that lets you get each transition just right — even 
carrying the audio from the first clip into the next one.
Moving up to Final Cut
You can accomplish a lot with iMovie, but it has its limits. When you’re ready 
for the training wheels to come off, Apple has excellent industrial-strength 
solutions waiting for you, some at consumer-strength prices.
The top-of-the-line Apple video-editing suite is Final Cut Studio. It includes 
these features:
 
✓ Final Cut Pro: Not many computer programs win Emmys. It has also 
been used to edit more than two dozen feature-length films. It supports 
most high-definition formats.

250
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
✓ Soundtrack Pro: As Apple puts it, the soundtrack is half the picture. 
Soundtrack Pro includes more than 50 professional-effect plug-ins.
 
✓ Motion: This animation package creates motion graphics in real-time.
 
✓ DVD Studio Pro: Transfer HD content to optical disc formats.
 
✓ Color: Use this product for professional color grading.
 
✓ Compressor: This audio and video compression application automates 
encoding and format conversions.
Apple separately sells Shake, a video-compositing tool for professional 
special effects.
 
If you’re still waiting to be green-lighted for that full-length epic, Apple has a 
scaled-down version of Final Cut, Final Cut Express, in the under-$200 class. 
It has the same interface as Final Cut Pro but not all tools and formats. It also 
comes with a scaled-back, but still powerful, version of Soundtrack. Figure 13-2 
shows the rich interface of Final Cut Express.
For more on iMovie and the subject of the next section, iDVD, see iMovie 
& iDVD ’09 For Dummies by Dennis R. Cohen and Michael E. Cohen (Wiley 
Publishing).

Burning Movies with iDVD
When your epic is ready, pull down the Share menu to find all the things you 
can do with it, from placing it in iTunes so that you can view it on your iPod 
or iPhone to uploading it to YouTube or your MobileMe Gallery to exporting 
it in QuickTime or another format that Apple FinalCut accepts. If you want to 
burn a DVD, you want to use iDVD. Read on.
Apple iDVD is something of a one-trick pony: It transfers content to DVD-R 
so that it can be shown on ordinary DVD players. The content includes stuff 
you created with other iLife applications (your iMovie films and iPhoto slide 
shows) and other video content you may have on your hard drive.
You need a Mac that can burn DVDs: the Apple SuperDrive. The MacBook Air 
doesn’t have an optical drive, but Apple offers an optional external USB DVD 
burner.
 
If you want only to back up your media or other files to a DVD, you don’t need to 
use iDVD. The OS X Finder lets you do that. Just don’t try to play your backup 
DVD on your home entertainment center.
Ken Burns and his effect
The documentary films of Ken Burns have 
brought to life, for millions of viewers, whole 
eras of American history — the building of the 
Brooklyn Bridge, the rise of jazz and baseball, 
and the development of radio. For his most 
acclaimed series, The Civil War, Burns faced 
an opportunity and a problem. The Civil War 
was fought after the invention of photography, 
and archives were filled with black-and-white 
images, some by excellent early photographers 
such as Mathew Brady. These archives pre-
sented an opportunity to visually tell the story 
of this horrific war. The problem was how to 
keep from boring an audience that was used to 
seeing movie footage of war. Burns solved the 
problem by panning the camera across the still 
images and slowly zooming in or out to create 
a sense of motion. The Civil War won numer-
ous awards, including two Emmys, for its ability 
to not just convey the facts of history but also 
examine its emotional impact.
Apple has incorporated into its iLife suite the 
technique that Ken Burns made such masterful 
use of. It’s even called “the Ken Burns effect.” 
It operates by default in iPhoto slide shows and 
even in the OS X screen saver. But you can 
customize it by selecting starting and ending 
versions of the image. The same feature is 
available in iMovie (select a clip and press the 
C key), allowing you to incorporate iPhoto stills 
as dynamic images in your cinematic projects.

252
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
Most of what iDVD does is kind of boring: Convert stuff to the right video 
formats and put the bits in the place on the DVD where consumer players 
expect them. But Apple can add some pizzazz in one place: themes for the 
main DVD menu. Here’s how it works:
 
1. The main screen of iDVD shows a collection of Apple-created themes 
on the right side. Select one you like by clicking it.
 
 In Figure 13-3, you can see the travel theme.
 
Figure 13-3: 
The iDVD 
theme 
selection 
screen.
 
 
2. Drag movies and photos from the Finder or any iLife application to 
designated image areas within the themes.
 
 iDVD can even animate the images so that your menu is even more 
inviting.
 
 If you want a scene selection menu, iDVD can add one based on your 
iMovie chapter divisions.
 
3. Choose File➪Burn DVD.
If you need to create a DVD quickly, use the OneStep DVD function that burns 
the entire contents of the tape in an attached DV camcorder. Just select 
OneStep DVD from the iDVD File menu.
Composing Using GarageBand
There’s an old joke about someone asking a police officer in Manhattan 
how to get to Carnegie Hall. “Practice six hours every day” comes the reply. 
Making music has traditionally required both talent and manual skills that 

253
 Chapter 13: Producing Movies and Music on Your Mac
take years to master. People who don’t start young and keep working at their 
instrument are consigned to taking guitar or piano lessons at adult education 
class, where they might progress to plunking out a few tunes at a party.
Computers have leveled the playing field somewhat. Programs such as Apple 
GarageBand, shown in Figure 13-4, come with prerecorded loops that you can 
transform and combine to create a sound you want. You can add your own 
tracks by connecting a keyboard or another instrument that has a MIDI or 
USB interface, or just use the onscreen keyboard. If your performance isn’t 
quite up to snuff, you can try again or edit out the imperfections. You can 
also add tracks that were performed live and recorded with a microphone.
 
Figure 13-4: 
GarageBand 
lays down 
tracks.
 
Apple offers add-ins to GarageBand in the form of $99 Jam Packs, which 
include
 
✓ Remix Tools Jam Pack
 
✓ Rhythm Section Jam Pack
 
✓ Symphony Orchestra Jam Pack
 
✓ Voices
 
✓ World Music Jam Pack
You can export your composition to iTunes or use it as part of the sound-
track for your slide show or iMovie. The latter uses may be one of the most 
valuable aspects of GarageBand.

254
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
If you plan to distribute your iLife compositions beyond your circle of family 
and friends, you can’t just dub in selections from your favorite group’s album, 
even if you purchased it fair and square from the iTunes Store. What you 
bought entitles you to listen to, not incorporate into your own work, the 
copyrighted music. Original music and sound effects you create in GarageBand, 
even those that use prerecorded Apple loops, are yours to use as you see fit.
 
For an in-depth look at recording music with GarageBand, check out 
GarageBand For Dummies, by Bob LeVitus (Wiley Publishing).
Podcasting with GarageBand
If you want to try your hand at podcasting (creating audio or video essays 
that are distributed over the Net and often played on iPods), GarageBand has 
the tools you need.
You can use the built-in microphone in your Mac. GarageBand can enhance 
the sound and reduce background noise. If you use a musical soundtrack, 
GarageBand can automatically “duck” the soundtrack under your voice when 
you’re speaking. Add sound effects, if you like — GarageBand comes with 
more than 200. You can also have a video track with a title screen and other 
photos you might want to add. If you have a MobileMe account, you can 
publish your podcast online with a single click.
 
Because programs such as GarageBand make podcasting easy, everyone can 
do it, and it seems like everyone is doing it. If you want your podcasts to stand 
out, follow these tips:
 
✓ Pick topics you know about.
 
✓ Take the time to develop an outline or a script.
 
✓ Pick one point and make it well.
 
✓ Keep it short.
 
✓ Lose the “umms” and “uhs” and “likes.”
Learning to play an instrument 
with GarageBand
If you always wanted to play guitar or piano, or if you already play but want 
tips from some outstanding musicians, GarageBand can help. The program 
comes with two introductory lessons, one for each instrument. Click Learn 
to Play on the left side of the GarageBand window to try them out. You can 
download eight more free lessons for each instrument by clicking Lesson 
Store. But that’s not all: The lesson store also has artist lessons you can 

255
 Chapter 13: Producing Movies and Music on Your Mac
buy, featuring popular performers — from Sara Bareilles to Sting. Each artist 
lesson teaches you to play a simple version of one of that artist’s hits. All 
lessons are highly interactive, making clever use of the GarageBand power to 
help you practice. You can even record your practice sessions in GarageBand 
and save the tracks you like.
Moving up from GarageBand
Just as in iPhoto and iMovie, Apple has better music-creation tools ready 
whenever you are: Logic and Logic Pro. One classic rite of passage for a new 
musical group was coming up with the thousands of dollars needed to rent 
a sound studio for a few hours so that they could cut a demo tape. Modern 
groups have found that, for a lot less money, they can build sound studios in 
their basements to keep up with the pros. A Mac is often at the heart of this 
process. You need additional equipment, including good microphones, 
preamps, and a multi-input audio interface with a USB or, preferably, 
FireWire interface (if your Mac has a FireWire port). Sites such as www.
tweakheadz.com have lots of resources to help you get started.

professional techniques, check out Home Recording for Musicians For

Chapter 14
Building Your Space on the Web
In This Chapter
▶ Establishing yourself on the World Wide Web with iWeb
▶ Getting connected with MobileMe
▶ Facing the world with Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter
P
sychologist Abraham Maslow suggests that we have a hierarchy of 
needs. After our physical requirements for survival and safety are met 
and we have satisfactory personal relationships (friends, marriage, children), 
we seek to establish our presence in the larger world, a process that Maslow 
calls self-actualization. In the past, it might have meant running for political 
office, joining a performing group, or writing a self-help book. Now, more and 
more people seek recognition as individuals and find ways to make an impact 
on the world by creating a personal space on the Internet.
In this chapter, you find out a few popular ways to create your space on 
the Web:
 
✓ Building a Web site: Your Mac comes with excellent tools for expressing 
your thoughts, feelings, and ideas — iPhoto, iMovie, GarageBand — that 
I’ve talked about in the preceding three chapters. The final element 
of the iLife suite, iWeb (which I describe in this chapter) lets you pull 
together all that creative content and let others view it by way of the 
World Wide Web. You also discover how to get your own domain name 
and a few tips for building a successful site.
 
✓ Having your Web storage and sharing space with MobileMe: You can 
subscribe to MobileMe from Apple, and get not only a personal space for 
storing files and more, but also tools for hosting your site, simply sharing 
photos and synchronizing multiple computers.
 
✓ Social networking: If you haven’t already, check out sites such as 
Facebook, MySpace, and LinkedIn.

Creating a Web Site
When you’re setting up your own space on the Web, building your own site 
offers the most creative possibilities but is also the most technical. To make 
Web-page creation accessible to those without the technical knowledge, 
Apple iWeb brings the iLife predefined template concept to the process of 
building personal Web pages. The program comes supplied with 21 themes. 
Each theme has coordinated templates for the welcome page, narratives, 
photos, movies, blogs, and podcasts. See Figure 14-1. You can modify or 
customize the templates, if you want. iWeb relieves you from coding or other 
internal Web page tasks, and its automated tools simplify blogging.
If you have MobileMe, you can publish your page and update it with a single 
click, but iWeb supports other Web hosting services as well. I have more to 
say about MobileMe later in this chapter.
 
Figure 14-1: 
An iWeb 
template.
 
In the sections that follow, you find details about working with iWeb as well 
as tips for building a successful site and getting your own domain name.

259
 Chapter 14: Building Your Space on the Web
Starting your first iWeb site
If iWeb isn’t on your dock, you can find it in your Applications folder. Launch 
the program, and it first asks you whether you have a MobileMe account. If 
you already do, give it your username and password. If not, skip this step.
Next, you’re asked to choose a theme for your Web site. Here’s what you 
need to know about themes as you get started:
 
✓ Your theme options enable you to set a look and feel for your site. 
The Apple Web designers have supplied more than twenty themes, with 
looks that range from highly elegant and professional to frivolous and 
whimsical.
 
✓ The themes help you coordinate pages for different types of site 
content. Each theme includes matching page designs for a welcome 
screen, biographical information, photos, albums, movies, blogs, 
podcasts, and a blank theme page that you can easily customize for 
whatever inspires you.
 
✓ You can switch themes easily. Pick a theme to get started. Because all 
pages follow a similar organizational style, you aren’t locked into your 
initial theme choice after you start building your page. For the most 
part, you can change themes at will.
Each theme page template, except the blank one, is filled with placeholder 
pictures and text so that you see what the result will look like. The body text 
consists of a Latin passage by the ancient Roman orator Cicero in which he 
explains that no one deliberately seeks out grief. (He wrote the passage 
centuries before Windows was created). You can customize the placeholders 
as follows:
 
✓ Replacing text: Double-click any bit of text to select it and then just type 
what you want or cut and paste it from another document.
 
✓ Deleting placeholders: To get rid of an element you don’t want, select 
the element and press Delete.
 
✓ Replacing placeholders with photos: On the right side of your screen, 
you see the Media Browser, an area with headings labeled Audio, 
Photos, Movies, and Widgets. Click Photos and you see photos and 
albums from your iPhoto library. Select a photo and drag it to one of the 
placeholder images and your photo appears instead.

260
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
 If you have lots of photos, you may find it more convenient to search in 
iPhoto itself and then drag the selected photo from iPhoto to the iWeb 
placeholder image. All iLife programs cooperate nicely.
 
 Of course, you can continue to replace photos you selected with others 
until you find the one that best suits your purpose.
 
✓ Moving and resizing images: You can also click and drag images to 
move them, and you can resize them by clicking one and then dragging 
the control boxes that surround the image. If you move something by 
mistake, just choose Edit➪Undo or press Ú-Z.
 
✓ Adding new elements to a page: You can add elements to any page, 
such as text boxes, shapes, images, and movies. For text boxes and 
shapes, click the appropriate icon at the bottom of the iWeb window. To 
add photos and other media, drag them from the Media Browser.
 
✓ Putting a widget on a page: Another type of element that you find in 
the Media Browser is a widget, which is a block of programming code 
in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the computer language that 
describes Web pages. Widgets perform specialized functions, such as 
displaying Google Maps or YouTube videos. You can even display paid 
advertising using the Google AdSense program. By paid, I mean that 
you’re paid when people click the ads. See the later sidebar “Google 
AdSense” for more information.
 
The individual pages of your site have a navigation bar at the top that lets 
visitors move from one page to another. Clicking in that bar while you’re in 
iWeb to select a different page to edit is tempting, but it doesn’t work. You 
have to use the navigation pane on the right side of the iWeb window to 
access different pages in the site you’re editing.
Saving your pages is no different from any Mac or Windows app: File➪Save. 
If you forget, like all apps, iWeb asks if you want to save your changes when 
you quit the program.
Publishing your site
Just because you build a site in iWeb doesn’t mean it’s online for all to see. 
When you’re ready to share your creation, you have to publish it to the Web.
 
Before you share your site with others, take a look to make sure that all 
placeholders have been replaced with your content. Also be sure to give your 
site a name. To get ready to publish your site, follow these steps:
 
1. Click the top icon in the navigation bar on the left side of the iWeb 
windows.

261
 Chapter 14: Building Your Space on the Web
 
2. In the Site Publishing Settings pane that appears, you name your site, 
provide a contact e-mail address, and (optionally) make your site 
private by requiring guests to enter a password you select.
 
3. (Optional) Tell iWeb to automatically notify your Facebook profile 
whenever you change your site. Just select the Facebook check box at 
the bottom of the pane.
 
4. In the Publishing settings pane, you also select where you want to 
publish your site, either your MobileMe account or another Web 
hosting service using File Transfer Protocol (FTP).
 
 Your hosting service should provide you with the necessary server 
address, username, password, directory path, and protocol you must 
use with FTP.
 
5. To close this pane, click some other element on the navigation bar.
 
6. After you enter all the information, click Publish at the bottom of the 
iWeb screen.
 
 Apple nags you to ensure that you have rights to all content you’re 
putting online. Publishing can take a few minutes, so don’t close iWeb 
until you receive confirmation that your site has been published. The 
confirmation box tells you the Web address of your site, which is 
information you should write down somewhere, and gives you the 
option of announcing your site by either sending e-mail or visiting the 
site immediately.
If you find mistakes (everyone does) or information you want to change or 
add, don’t worry. Open the site again in iWeb, make your changes, and click 
Publish again.
 
The Internet can be a dangerous place for young people. Before you let your 
kids set up their own Web pages or join social networking sites, take a close 
look at the section in Chapter 17 that talks about Macs for kids.
Moving up from iWeb
iWeb is narrowly focused on personal Web pages. You might be able to adapt 
its templates to a simple business, but that’s about it. Apple lacks a high-end 
program for Web page design. If you’re looking for a program that’s more 
robust that iWeb, I suggest looking into the following options:
 
✓ Adobe Dreamweaver is probably the tool that’s most often used by 
professionals using Macs and Windows. For help creating a site with 
Dreamweaver, check out Dreamweaver CS4 For Dummies or Web Sites 
Do-It-Yourself For Dummies, both by Janine Warner (Wiley Publishing).

✓ You can find a good free, visual Web page editor at www.kompozer.
net, though you may need to load Rosetta in order to use it. Rosetta 
is in the Optional Installs folder on the restore DVD supplied with your 
Mac. See the section on installing software in Chapter 5. The SeaMonkey 
Web application suite. www.seamonkey-project.org, also includes 
a Web editor.
Making Web sites that work
With tools such as iWeb, creating a Web page is easy. Making one that 
accomplishes your goals is another matter. Here are some tips for making 
your Web site effective:
 
✓ Make sure that you’re providing information that someone else cares 
about. You don’t need a large audience, but you must address the needs 
of your niche. Content counts.
 
✓ Say what you most need to say on the first page a visitor sees. Keep 
it simple. You have, at most, ten seconds to convince visitors to delve 
deeper into your site. Be sure to include any keywords that you want 
Google to index in the initial paragraphs.
 
✓ Pick an easy-to-remember Web address. Pick one that’s in the .com 
top-level domain, if you can. No, they aren’t all taken. If a name you like 
isn’t taken, register it immediately. One-year registrations are cheap. 
Mark the renewal date a month ahead on your iCal calendar so that you 
don’t forget to renew. Some domain name registrars, such as GoDaddy.
com, automatically renew you, but you must keep your credit card 
information up to date. After you settle on a name, don’t change it. 
Links to your site are priceless.
 
✓ On the garish World Wide Web, restraint stands out. Use color and 
graphics to enhance your messages. Avoid clichés such as animated 
.gif files and Under Construction signs. If one of your pages isn’t ready, 
don’t link to it.
 
✓ Put up what you have now and improve it later. The visitors you 
missed today won’t be back tomorrow.
 
✓ Test your site by using different browsers. Include Internet Explorer in 
Windows (a good use for your old PC) and Firefox on Mac and Windows. 
Test your site on a dialup connection, too.
 
✓ Ask someone who doesn’t know your site to find it and check it out 
while you watch. Keep your mouth shut during the evaluation — it isn’t 
easy — and take notes or, better, videotape the session. You want to 
understand how a new visitor experiences and navigates your site so 
that you can make any changes needed to improve the user experience 
and make sure your visitors do whatever you’re hoping they’ll do on 
your site.

263
 Chapter 14: Building Your Space on the Web
 
✓ Keep your site current. Inspect it at least one a month. Out-of-date 
information destroys the credibility of your entire site. Regularly purge 
references to “upcoming” events that have already happened and to 
dead external links. Don’t include high-maintenance items such as events 
if you aren’t prepared to keep them updated. Less is more.
 
✓ Give visitors a compelling reason to return to your site. That reason 
depends on the goals of your site, but it must have a clear benefit for 
visitors, not just for you.
Getting your own domain name
Having your own domain name makes you a first-class citizen on the Internet. 
Web addresses have several parts strung together by periods, like this:
www.dummies.com
You decode a Web address from right to left:
 
✓ Top-level domain, or TLD: The rightmost part of a name (com, in the 
preceding example).
 
✓ Organization or Web site name: Located to the left of the TLD (dummies). 
Two-letter TLDs are reserved for different countries, such as us, fr, 
or uk. Three-letter TLDs denote a type of use. The most widely known 
is .com, typically used for commercial sites. Many browsers, including 
Safari, insert .com in the Web address if no TLD is specified, so this TLD 
is particularly desirable.
 
✓ Particular service within the organization: The part to the left of the 
organization name (www).
Google AdSense
If you sign up for the Google AdSense program 
and place the AdSense widget on your site, 
Google automatically puts ads on your page. 
You can select from a number of ad for-
mats, from the discrete to the garish. Google 
selects ads to show to your visitors based on 
the content of the site and on information that 
Google and its partners have accumulated 
about your visitor. Yes, all your Web activity is 
being tracked, and, if you use AdSense, you’re 
helping with the tracking. You won’t get rich 
with AdSense, unless you have a spectacularly 
popular site. Google pays you each month, but 
only after your earnings exceed $100. The folk 
singer Linda Lavin once complained, “You can 
make hundreds of dollars as a folk singer.” That 
limit on expectations applies to Web sites using 
AdSense, even ones that receive hundreds of 
hits a day.

264
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
The www, which stands for World Wide Web, is common in Web addresses, 
but large organizations often further subdivide their Web addresses by site 
or department.
The last two hunks of a hostname are known as the domain. For example, 
dummies.com is a domain name. (In some countries, an extra hunk identifies 
broad categories, such as in bbc.co.uk, in which co has a meaning similar 
to .com.)
Domain names are assigned by various registrars. Their price varies from $8 
to $35 per year, and you usually have to pay the first year up front. I’ve had 
good experiences with GoDaddy.com. For a list of organizations that can 
register a domain name for you, see
www.icann.org/registrars/accredited-list.html
 
Internet service providers often charge substantial additional fees for setting 
up and supporting new domains. But registrars such as GoDaddy often offer a 
free service that sends people who enter your domain name in their browser 
to the more clunky address that your Internet provider chooses. For example, 
visitors to ditchmypc.com are automatically redirected to http://web.
me.com/agr/Site/Welcome.html.
MobileMe for You
MobileMe is the Apple collection of online services that are available by 
subscription. (It used to be named .Mac — or “dot-mac” — and iTools before 
that) MobileMe costs $99 a year or $149 for a family pack that supports as 
many as five users. MobileMe works for PCs and Macs, but Apple offers a 
60-day free trial to new Mac buyers. For the $99 fee, you receive these services:
 
✓ Web hosting: You can have one or more Web sites, all managed by 
iWeb, as described earlier in this chapter. Note that the Apple terms of 
service for MobileMe say that it’s “designed for personal use and not 
intended to be used for commercial business purposes, including, but 
not limited to, transacting online sales or software distribution via an 
e-commerce site.” But you can show Google AdSense advertisements.
 
✓ A me.com electronic mail account for each user: For example, 
SteveJobs@me.com. Mail addressed to your MobileMe account is 
automatically sent to your Mac, your iPhone or iPod touch, and even to 
Microsoft Outlook. You can even access your mail on someone else’s 
computer by using a Web interface.

265
 Chapter 14: Building Your Space on the Web
 
✓ iDisk online storage: Access it from your Mac just as you would access 
an external hard drive. You can use iDisk for backing up or to share files 
with others — under password protection, if you want. You can access 
your iDisk from a PC as well. The basic plan offers 20GB of total storage 
space, including your e-mail, photos, and Web sites. Additional users on 
the family plan have 5GB each, and, of course, Apple will happily rent 
you more space, if you need it.
 
✓ Contacts and calendars: MobileMe can synchronize all address books 
and calendars that live on your desktop or laptop or your iPhone or 
iPod and in Microsoft Outlook, the Windows address book, Google, and 
Yahoo! Plus, you can access your information from a Web application.
 
✓ Photo gallery: Upload and store your photos from your computer or 
iPhone. The gallery is integrated with iPhoto and Aperture for effortless 
uploads. Friends can view pictures and even add their own to your 
gallery. MobileMe even works with AppleTV, letting your viewers see 
your photos on their big-screen TVs.
Many services that MobileMe provides are available for free or less expensively 
from other Internet services. For example, Google and Yahoo! offer free e-mail 
with address books and online storage. And, sites such as Flickr.com host 
your photos for free. MobileMe ties up everything in a single package that’s 
reliable and easy to use. The time you spend in figuring out how to use a 
bunch of free services is worth something, too.
Social Networking from your Mac
You don’t need your own Web site to establish a personal presence on the 
Internet. Several sites designed to give individuals a place to do their thing 
have become wildly popular:
 
✓ LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) focuses on your work life and helps you 
find and network with people who can help your career.
 
✓ Facebook (www.facebook.com) was originally intended for college 
students, but it’s increasingly used by people in older and younger age 
brackets.
 
✓ MySpace (www.myspace.com) is a bit more freeform, with everything 
from dating to business sites to music distribution and the promotion of 
TV shows and movies.
 
✓ Twitter (www.twitter.com) lets you send short text messages, or 
tweets, from your computer or cellphone so that your friends and others 
can read them.

266
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
If you already have an account on one of these social networking sites, you 
don’t have to do anything when you switch to a Mac — just log in to the site 
with your Safari browser and do what you usually do there. You need your site 
passwords, however. If you forget them, the sites will generally mail you a new 
password to the e-mail address they have on file for you. So test your passwords 
to make sure they work (and write them down) before you abandon your old 
e-mail account. See Chapter 10 for tips on password management.
This list describes some social networking resources specifically for your Mac:
 
✓ Facebook Widget: A dashboard widget that’s designed to show 
notifications such as messages, pokes, friend requests, and group and 
event invites. You can download it from facebookdesktopwidget.com.
 
✓ FMenu: Adds an icon to your menu bar that lets you quickly access 
your Facebook pages. This product (at http://sourceforge.net/
projects/fmenu) tells you about various Facebook events, such as 
new wall posts, new inbox messages, status changes, and the release 
of the Facebook Growl feature. In addition, it lets you quickly access 
almost all your Facebook pages. See www.applesource.com.au/
os-x/soa/Mac-plugins-for-Facebook for more examples.
 
✓ Spyder: A fast, versatile MySpace browser (www.spyderx.com) aimed 
at OS X.
 
✓ Twitterrific: A free, ad-supported application from IconFactory that lets 
you send and receive tweets from your Mac in a little side window that 
floats in front of your other windows so you’ll never miss the latest hot 
tweet. (Give them $15, and they’ll drop the ads.) You can find it at
www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/email_chat/
twitterrific.html
 
✓ OS X support groups for Mac users: Often accessible on social networking 
sites. Try searching for macintosh computers on Facebook.
Should you friend your teenager?
Facebook and other social networking sites 
allow only a member’s full content to be viewed 
solely by other members who have mutually 
agreed to be friends on the site. That arrange-
ment raises the question of whether parents 
should insist that their kids make them friends 
(or “friend them,” in the argot) on these sites. 
Parents need to supervise younger kids’ 
Internet activities, but the case can be made to 
allow older teens some privacy online. They’ll 
be on their own in a few years anyway, and 
having the opportunity to experiment and even 
make mistakes online while you’re still active in 
their lives can be a good learning experience. 
It’s a tough judgment call that you have to make. 
Still, a review of the online guidelines for young 
people that I present in Chapter 17 is always in 
order.

Enjoying Other OS X Goodies
In This Chapter
▶ Filling the Dashboard with widgets
▶ Finding the window you need with Exposé
▶ Organizing the screen with Spaces
▶ Searching your Mac with Spotlight
M
ac OS X is filled with programs and features that make time spent in 
front of your computer more productive, more interesting, and more 
fun. In this chapter, I introduce some of my favorites.
Adding Handy Widgets to the Dashboard
Dashboard provides an easy way to see and use widgets, which are mini-
applications that grab specific information from the Internet or help with 
narrow but useful tasks. Figure 15-1 shows a typical Dashboard arrangement, 
including a calendar, clock, translator, flight tracker, weather program, and 
more. Of course, you can move widgets around, add new ones, and drop stale 
ones. You’re in charge. Some widgets are silly, some are fun, and some seem 
indispensable after you’re used to having them around.
To work with widgets, you just need to know a few tips:
 
✓ To make your widgets appear: Press F4, the key with a meter icon on it. 
The desktop you’ve been working on “grays” into the background, and a 
layer with colorful widgets appears.
 
✓ To add more widgets: Click the plus sign (+)in the lower-left corner. A 
scrolling list appears at the bottom of your screen. Click the icons for 
the widgets you want to add.
 
✓ To delete widgets: Click the plus sign to do this task, too. When you do, 
all current widgets show up with an X in their upper-left corner. Click 
the X, and they’re gone.

268
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
✓ To adjust settings: Many widgets have a lowercase i in their lower-right 
corners. Click the i, and the widget flips over to show you which settings 
you can adjust to customize it.
Apple includes a collection of widgets with OS X, but many more are available 
from www.apple.com/downloads/dashboard. Many are freeware, and 
some ask for a fee. Many work only when your computer is connected to the 
Internet.
 
Figure 15-1: 
The 
Dashboard.
 
You can have multiple instances of a widget running simultaneously with 
different customizations, such as a clock with different time zones or weather 
reports from different locales. Some of the widgets supplied with OS X are 
described in this list:
 
✓ Address book: Gain easy access to your contact list.
 
✓ Calendar: What day is the 23rd of next month?
 
✓ Dictionary and thesaurus: Don’t guess — look it up.
 
✓ Flight tracker: Where’s that flight now? When will it arrive?

269
 Chapter 15: Enjoying Other OS X Goodies
 
✓ Language translator: Translate a sentence or two between Chinese, 
Dutch, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Korean, Russian, and 
Spanish.
 
✓ Movies: Find what’s playing where, see previews, and buy tickets from 
Fandango.
 
✓ Phone book: Let your mouse do the walking.
 
✓ Ski report: Packed ice or fresh powder?
 
✓ Stickies: These items don’t fall off your monitor.
 
✓ Stocks: Watch your favorite securities and funds fluctuate.
 
✓ Tile game: Check out this classic.
 
✓ Unit converter: Sure, it can convert from metric to English, but it also 
knows currency exchange rates.
 
✓ Weather: Look up the temperature highs and lows and a six-day forecast.
 
✓ World time: Is it too early to call Tokyo?
You even have a Widget widget to help you manage all your widgets. To see 
the widgets available and add some to your Dashboard, press F4 to open 
Dashboard and then click the plus sign (+) in the lower left of your screen.
Download more
You can find many more widgets to play with. Here are some examples — all 
are freeware:
 
✓ Countdown Dashboard: Make a countdown timer to any event you 
choose: graduation, vacation, dental appointment, or book deadline, for 
example.
 
✓ Corporate Ipsum: Generate nonsense text whenever you need it, such 
as “interactively orchestrate superior portals without team-driven 
platforms, collaboratively actualize plug-and-play outsourcing and 
maintainable applications, distinctively simplify front-end platforms 
before backward-compatible relationships.”
 
✓ Fans: Your Mac has cooling fans inside that spin at different rates 
depending on how hard your CPU is working. Seriously. The first time 
my normally quiet MacBook started to sound like an airplane taking off 
was a tad alarming. The Fans widget shows animated fans spinning to 
match the current speed of your real fans.

270
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
 
✓ I Love Lamp: You’ve seen or heard of the infamous lava lamp from the 
1960s?
 
✓ iStat Pro: Display the status of the CPU, memory, hard drives, internal 
and external IP address, bandwidth, battery, uptime, and fans.
 
✓ Kennedy Space Center Video: Watch what’s happening at everyone’s 
favorite spaceport. You have more than a dozen Webcams to choose 
from.
 
✓ Mirror: See yourself onscreen and touch up your hair (uses your iSight 
camera).
 
✓ Starry Night: See the planets and constellations as they appear right 
now at any location on Earth.
 
✓ Sudoku: Get your rivals at work hooked on this wildly popular number 
game. Sudoku and career success are ensured.
Thousands more widgets are available, and more keep popping up.
Roll your own
You can select a portion of a Web page and create a widget that shows the 
latest version of just that piece, a feature Apple calls WebClips. Follow these 
steps:
 
1. Open Safari and go to the Web site you want to “widgetize.”
 
2. Choose File➪Open in Dashboard or click the Dashboard icon.
 
3. Select the section of the page you want to capture.
 
 In the upper-right corner of Figure 15-1, you see two Web clips I made. 
One is from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (www.dhs.gov), 
showing the current terrorist threat level; the other, from Dummies.com, 
shows a search box for finding the latest For Dummies titles.
Apple even provides the Dashcode program to help you build your own 
widget. Make a widget to track your favorite blog. The possibilities are 
endless. Dashcode is in the Xcode folder on your OS X installation DVD. 
Controlling Windows Fast with Exposé
The more useful computers become, the more cluttered the screen gets. At 
any given time, you may be working with half a dozen applications at one 
time, each with multiple windows open. Exposé provides the following short-
cuts to help you find the window you’re looking for:

271
 Chapter 15: Enjoying Other OS X Goodies
 
✓ Press F3. All open windows shrink and arrange themselves on your 
screen so that none of them overlaps. (The icon on the key suggests 
the separated windows.). You see an overview of everything. Click the 
window you want and it moves to the front, or press F3 again and your 
screen returns to its previous mess.
 
✓ Press Control+F3. It works like pressing F3, but rearranges only the 
windows from the application you’re working on. Or click and hold any 
application’s icon in the Dock to get the same effect for that application.
 
✓ Press Ô-F3. Make all windows disappear so that you can see your desk-
top. (The windows don’t completely go away — you can see the edges 
of the windows along the border of your screen. Clicking one of those 
window edges moves you out of Exposé with that window in front.)
 
✓ Press F4. Open the Dashboard.
 
Apple sometimes moves these keys around depending on the keyboard you 
have. Also, you can pick different keys to perform these functions and also 
make the corner of your screen a hot spot for the same actions. Follow these 
steps to check on your key assignments and to make changes:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
 
2. Select Exposé & Spaces.
 
 You see a pane similar to the one shown in Figure 15-2.
 
3. Select the keys or onscreen corners for which you want to perform an 
action.

Organizing Work Areas with Spaces
I’m one of those people who always has several projects going on at a time. 
My fantasy is to have a studio where I can have a table or workbench for 
each project so that I can walk up to it whenever I want and pick up where 
I left off. Apple hasn’t offered me a studio, but OS X provides the next best 
thing — a bunch of virtual work tables named Spaces. You can have as many 
as 16 of them. Specific applications can be assigned to specific spaces, or an 
application can be available to all spaces. You set up Spaces this way:
 
1. Choose Ú➪System Preferences.
 
2. Select Exposé & Spaces, and then click the Spaces tab.
 
 You see a window like the one shown in Figure 15-3.
 
3. Add the applications you want and assign them a space or set them to 
be available to all spaces.
 
 Figure 15-3 shows Spaces with three spaces populated. (See the 
Application Bindings area of the dialog.)
 
 When you’re done with the setup, activate Spaces by pressing 
Fn+F8 and selecting the space you want. (Again, choose System 
Preferences➪Exposé and Spaces for the key on your Mac.) Or, switch 
spaces by holding down Ctrl and pressing either the arrow key or the 
number key that corresponds to the space you want.

Searching for Files with Spotlight
After you use computers for a while, sooner or later you encounter difficulty 
in finding a file, even though you know that it’s in there somewhere. The 
Spotlight search tool helps you find that file by typing words that the file 
likely contains and other characteristics, such as its name, the date you 
created it, and which kind of file it is. Searching through gigabytes of hard 
drive space can take some time, even on a fast computer, so Spotlight keeps 
an index of every word you use in documents, e-mail messages, and other 
areas. It does this in the background, so you hardly notice. But these indexes 
make searching very fast.
A Spotlight icon is located on the menu bar in the upper-right corner of your 
screen. Click it to open a search box. You also see search boxes in each 
Finder window. You can also press Ô+F when the Finder is open.
Customizing searches
You can tell Spotlight your search preferences and how you want to see 
results by clicking the Spotlight icon in System Preferences. You see a pane 
similar to the one shown in Figure 15-4. Deselect the items you don’t want to 
search. You can drag individual lines up and down to reorder the way items 
appear in a search.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Customizing 
the Spotlight 
search 
order.
 

274
Part IV: More Software, More Choices 
Of course, you may have information that you’d prefer not be found in a 
search. Click the Privacy tab in the Spotlight preferences pane and drag into 
the window those files and folders you don’t want to be searched. Spotlight 
doesn’t return matches from those files and folders.
Spotlight normally tries to match all the words you type in its search box. If 
you want to search for dogs or cats, type dogs | cats. If you want to search 
for pets but no dogs, type pets -dogs.
 
You find downloadable plug-ins that let Spotlight search other file types at 
www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/spotlight.
Searching with Smart Folders
Wouldn’t it be convenient to find all files associated with the Zorchcastle 
Project without having to do a search every time? Spotlight offers a tool to do 
this: Smart Folders. Here’s how it works:
 
1. In the Finder, create a folder by choosing Finder➪New Smart Folder.
 
 Of course, if your project isn’t named Zorchcastle, you’re out of luck. 
Smart Folders works only with “Zorchcastle.” Just kidding.
 
2. In the Smart Folder’s search area, enter the words or other criteria 
you want.
 
 You add more criteria by clicking the little plus-sign button (+).
 
3. To keep your handy new Smart Folder around, click the Save button 
and give it a name.
 
 Keep the Smart Folder around, and it will always show the files that 
match the criteria you set, including new files you saved after you set 
up the Smart Folder. The Smart Folder stays wherever you put it, such 
as on the desktop or in your Documents folder. You can find it the same 
way you find any other folder.
 
 Figure 15-5 shows a Smart Folder looking for files created in the past 
month whose name starts with the letters Ch.

Saving Time with Automator 
and AppleScript
Every now and then, you face a task that’s highly repetitious. A bunch of 
photos have to be sized to fit a catalog, or some illustrations have to be 
numbered a certain way to work with a publishing system, for example. 
Apple provides a couple of techniques for completing the task.
If you’re comfortable with computer programming, OS X comes with a 
scripting language named AppleScript. Most OS X applications can be 
invoked from AppleScript programs, so you can use the applications as tools 
in your program, say to extract an address from Address Book or rotate an 
image using Preview. You can find all the details in AppleScript For Dummies, 
2nd Edition by Tom Trinko (Wiley Publishing).
Most of us aren’t eager to write programs every time a tedious chore presents 
itself, so Apple has a simple way to automate your life, named, interestingly, 
Automator. OS X includes a library with hundreds of Automator actions you 
can choose from. See Figure 15-6. You can even ask Automator to watch what 
you’re doing as you work through the routine once and record your actions. 
You can then play back or edit your actions.

Oops, It’s a PC: Running 
Windows on Your Mac
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding the different ways to run Windows
▶ Getting Started with BootCamp
▶ Using virtualization to run OS X and Windows
▶ Running Windows using API translation
T
he Earth moved on June 6, 2005. Pigs flew. All flights to Hades were 
canceled because the runway had frozen over. On that day, Apple CEO 
Steve Jobs announced that Apple would begin using microprocessors from 
Intel in all its new products.
Since the beginning of the rivalry between Apple and Microsoft, one constant 
point of contention was the underlying hardware. Microsoft designed its 
products to run on the Intel x86 microprocessor series. Apple used Motorola 
680x0 “micros,” later switching to the PowerPC, jointly developed by 
Motorola and IBM. Apple ran ads showing Army tanks guarding a G3 Mac, 
briefly subject to U.S. arms export regulation, while stating that Windows PCs 
were harmless.
Jobs concluded that Intel had a better plan for developing the kind of 
microprocessors Apple needed and did the unthinkable. The transition went 
surprisingly smoothly. All Macs sold now not only have Intel microprocessors 
inside but also closely adhere to industry standards for PC design. They are 
truly PCs. If you take a fancy to the elegant Apple hardware but have eyes for 
only Windows 7, you can get the Mac you like and just run Windows 7 on it. 
You do have to buy a Windows 7 license separately — an added expense — 
but otherwise you have just another Windows machine.
The real win for Mac owners is having the ability to run, quite easily, both 
Mac OS X and Windows applications on the same Mac. The tricky part is 
choosing which of several methods exist for doing this. You have three main 
candidates. Here’s a quick rundown (I explain each one in more detail in this 
chapter):

278
Part VI: More Software, More Choices 
 
✓ Dual-booting: You pick your poison when you boot up your computer: 
OS X or Windows. Dual-booting capability is built into OS X, but, again, 
you need to obtain a Windows license. Apple named this technology 
Boot Camp.
 
✓ Virtualization: Run both operating systems at the same time and switch 
between them effortlessly. OS X and Windows play nicely together. Two 
vendors now offer this solution: Parallels.com and VMware.com.
 
✓ API translation: Run Windows applications on your Mac without installing 
Windows. This method doesn’t yet work for all applications, but if you 
need to run only a few applications or games that are on the “okay” list, 
you save money and aggravation by not buying and installing Windows. 
See “CodeWeavers — Wine on a Mac,” later in this chapter.
Pulling the Rabbit Out of the Hat
 
Magic starts with understanding the obvious. How can you run both OS X and 
Windows? Well, if you bought a Mac and still have your old PC, it’s easy — just 
turn them both on. You have the situation shown in Figure 16-1. I labeled one 
computer a Mac and one a Dell, but the second one can be any Windows PC. 
Indeed, as I just mentioned, because your new Mac is a PC, the computer on 
the right can be another Mac.

If you don’t care about spending money, you can buy two Macs, leave OS X 
on one, and replace OS X with Windows on the other. You’d be in the same 
situation as shown in Figure 16-2, which isn’t much different from Figure 16-1.
When you install an operating system on a computer, it’s stored on your 
hard drive. Well, you can have two (or more) hard drives and install a 
different operating system on each one. You can then tell your Mac (and your 
PC) from which hard drive you want to boot (start up).

You don’t even need two physical drives. You can use Disk Utility to split or 
partition your hard drive into two (or more) sections, called volumes. From 
then on, the computer considers each volume a separate hard drive, and you 
can install different operating systems on each volume, with only one physical 
hard drive. This situation is depicted in Figure 16-3.
Why can’t I run OS X on a Dell?
You may be wondering, “If Macs are just like 
any other PC, why can’t I run OS X on a Dell or 
an HP or any other Windows box that doesn’t 
come from Apple?” It’s a good question. And, 
it has two answers. First, some components 
in the Windows PC probably require drivers 
that aren’t available for OS X. Windows drivers 
don’t work in OS X. Apple makes drivers only for 
the components it uses in making Macs. This 
reason prevents cross-use only to a point. You 
find overlap in components, and some people 
are skilled enough to make the necessary driv-
ers, at least for the more popular configurations 
of Windows PCs, and make them available. If 
you want an unsupported, possibly unreliable, 
possibly illegal installation, I won’t say which 
Google search to try.
The other reason is that Apple doesn’t want 
you to run OS X on a Windows box — at least 
for now. Apple makes money selling the com-
plete package: hardware and software. At the 
moment, it isn’t ready to license OS X for other 
computers — it may never be — and it certainly 
doesn’t want people to pirate OS X. So Apple 
has built tests into OS X that can detect a non-
Apple PC. Exactly how closely guarded a secret 
is it? The company has even applied for patents 
on certain techniques for concealing the meth-
ods they use.
One benefit of having OS X run only on Apple 
hardware is that Apple doesn’t require registra-
tion for each new OS X installation. Microsoft, 
by contrast, requires such registration in its 
Windows Genuine Advantage program, and 
changes to a PC’s configuration can trigger a 
request to reregister.

At 10:00 a.m., you boot your Mac in OS X to check your mail and search 
the Web for information you need for a presentation you’re working on. At 
11 a.m., you reboot into Windows to run some corporate applications that 
require Internet Explorer. At 11:30, you reboot into OS X to finish that 
presentation in Keynote. It’s a tad tedious, but it all works.
Getting Started with Boot Camp
Boot Camp is included with Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and the earlier 
10.5 (Leopard). To use it, you need these two items:
 
✓ An Intel Mac with at least 10GB of free hard drive space
 
✓ A bona fide installation disc for Microsoft Windows XP (Service Pack 2 
or later, Home or Professional), Windows Vista, or Windows 7

281
 Chapter 16: Oops, It’s a PC: Running Windows on Your Mac
After you install Windows by using Boot Camp, you select which operating 
system you want, Windows or OS X, by holding down the Option key (the Alt 
key if you’re using a Windows keyboard) while starting up. If you don’t hold 
down the option key, you get OS X, unless you change the default, by selecting 
Ú➪System preferences➪Startup Disk. I would include a screen shot of Boot 
Camp in action, but you already know what Windows looks like.
Virtualize Me
Dual-booting is helpful if you need to use Windows only every so often. Dual-
booting can grow old fast if you need to switch several times a day. Wouldn’t 
it be wonderful if you could run both operating systems at the same time and 
switch between them as easily as you switch between applications in OS X? 
The technology that makes such a switch possible has been around since the 
1960s, but it has taken off in the past few years and has become one of the 
hottest topics in computing: virtualization.
With virtualization, an extra layer, a hypervisor, is inserted between the 
operating system and the computer. Operating systems include supervisor 
software, so the term hypervisor was invented to connote something with 
even more authority than a supervisor. The hypervisor’s role is to divide 
the CPU’s attention between two or more virtual machines, each with its 
own operating system. This concept is shown schematically in Figure 16-4. 
Each virtual machine looks to its operating system as though it had a complete, 
unvarnished CPU all to itself. The hypervisor ensures that each virtual 
machine gets a fair share of the real CPU’s resources and decides which 
operating system gets to appear on the real computer’s display and where to 
direct mouse and keyboard actions.

In the following sections, you find out about the pros and cons of virtualization 
as well as about programs you can use to add this hypervisor to your system. 
The two virtualization solutions for OS X are Parallels from Parallels.com and 
VMware Fusion from VMware.com, which is owned by EMC Corporation. I 
explain both products in more detail later in this section.
The pros and cons of virtualization
 
Virtualization is the most convenient solution to running Windows on a Mac. 
Both operating systems run at the same time, and you can quickly switch back 
and forth, with no rebooting. Virtualization also supports a wide variety of 
operating systems. You want MS-DOS or OS/2 on your Mac? No problem.
Virtualization has these disadvantages:
 
✓ It’s the most expensive solution to running Windows on a Mac because 
you must buy the virtualization package and obtain a Windows license.
 
✓ The hypervisor layer causes a small performance penalty, though spe-
cial hardware, known as Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x), in the 
Intel Core processors used in Macs is designed to speed virtualization.
 
✓ You have to deal with two different operating systems.
 
✓ It discourages you from making the leap to OS X, because the more 
familiar Windows programs are always easily available.
 
✓ Peripheral support may be less than ideal.
Parallels
Parallels is the first company to sell virtualization for OS X. Its product, 
Parallels Desktop, runs on any Intel Mac, though Parallels recommends 
having 1GB of RAM or more and 15GB of free hard drive space. It supports a 
wide range of guest operating systems, 32- and 64-bit, including the ones in 
this list:
 
✓ Most versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with 3.1, 98, Me, NT 
Server, Server 2000, Server 2003, Server 2008, XP, Vista, and Windows 7
 
✓ Many popular Linux distributions, including CentOS, Debian, Fedora 
Core, Mandriva, Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, and Xandrox
 
✓ FreeBSD 4 and 5
 
✓ The legendary IBM OS/2 Warp 4.5
 
✓ Sun Solaris 9 and 10
 
✓ MS-DOS 6.22

283
 Chapter 16: Oops, It’s a PC: Running Windows on Your Mac
Parallels has a Parallels Transporter feature that migrates your existing PC 
to the Mac, which greatly simplifies the process of getting on the Mac. It can 
also use a Boot Camp partition if you have previously created one.
 
Perhaps the sweetest feature of Parallels Desktop is Coherence, which lets 
you run Windows applications from the Mac desktop as though they were Mac 
applications. You don’t even have to look at Windows. You can even drag and 
drop files between the two operating systems. Windows apps show up on the 
OS X Dock with a W symbol, indicating their Windows origin.
Parallels offers a separate tool, Compressor, that the company claims 
reduces the size of a virtual machine stored on your hard drive by 50 percent 
or more, saving disk space and improving performance.
Parallels has support for USB 2.0, Windows 3D and DirectX 9. You can even 
use the built-in camera on your Mac. See http://kb.parallels.com/
en/5028.
VMware Fusion
VMware largely started the x86 virtualization business in 1998. The company is 
a leading supplier of virtualization products, such as its VMware Workstation, 
in the Windows and Linux enterprise markets. Its virtualization product for 
the Mac, VMware Fusion, is based on the same proven technology. So, even 
though VMware entered the OS X market a little later than Parallels, it brings 
along considerable depth of experience, supporting over 60 guest operating 
systems. Virtual machines created with other VMware products can run on the 
Mac, and similarly, virtual machines created with VMware Fusion on the Mac 
can run on other systems. VMware has a Virtual Appliance Marketplace, where 
you can try one of hundreds of preconfigured virtual solutions on your Mac.
One neat feature allows you to take a snapshot of your VMware virtual 
machine when you have it set up the way you like it. You can then roll back 
to that configuration with a single click whenever you want. You can copy 
and paste text between Windows and Mac applications and drag and drop 
files from one to the other. VMware also offers full USB 2.0 support and can 
run some games that depend on DirectX 9.0. VMware has similar installation 
requirements as Parallels Desktop.
Choosing between Parallels and VMware is tough. They’re both good products, 
and both offer free trial versions, so check out both products. If you work in 
an organization that uses other VMware products, that might tip the decision 
in favor of VMware.

284
Part VI: More Software, More Choices 
Imitation, the Sincerest Form of Flattery
One problem exists with both the dual-boot and the virtualization 
approaches: You need a copy of Windows. That’s an added expense, and it 
means that you have one more operating system to maintain, update, and 
defrag, for example. You probably just want to run some Windows-only 
applications. Suppose that you could sneak them onto your Mac without 
having to install the whole Windows boat? You can do that, too — sort of. 
I say “sort of” because it works with only certain Windows applications, 
though the list is growing.
Why running Windows applications 
will (or won’t) work
 
To understand how this approach works, it helps to first consider why it’s a 
problem. Windows programs run on the same Intel microprocessors as newer 
Macs. So why can’t you just insert a Windows program disc in your Mac and 
start it up? The reason is that all applications have to talk to the operating 
system to receive basic services, such as opening files or being notified 
whenever the user clicks a mouse button or presses a key. For programmers 
who create applications, an operating system is nothing more than a giant 
catalog of services they can call. Hundreds of services exist. The geek phrase 
for the collection of services an operating system provides is application 
program interfaces, or APIs. Unfortunately, the APIs that Mac OS X provides are 
set up quite differently from the ones Windows provides. They speak different 
languages, in effect.
Although the languages are different, the underlying concepts are the same. 
Some people came up with the idea of building a layer of software that would 
sit on top of one operating system and provide the APIs that a program for a 
second operating system would expect. This approach is illustrated in Figure 
16-5, showing a compatibility layer known as Wine. On a case-by-case basis, 
translating each operating system service isn’t hard. Intercept a request 
address to the second operating system to open a file, and convert it to the 
open-file request in the host system. What’s hard is getting it all exactly right 
for the hundreds of services involved.
The Wine project, www.winehq.org, was originally aimed at running 
Windows programs, particularly Microsoft Office, on Intel-based Linux 
computers. Microsoft doesn’t offer Office for Linux. The Wine project started 
in 1993, and people have been working on it ever since. One problem is that 
every time Microsoft releases a new version of Windows, dozens of new APIs 
must be added and others may have changed in subtle ways. And, Microsoft 
doesn’t always document its APIs as thoroughly as Wine developers might 
want, so a certain amount of trial and error exists in the Wine development 
process.

CodeWeavers — Wine on a Mac
Mac OS X shares a common Unix heritage with Linux. So when Apple announced 
it was switching to Intel microprocessors, it created the possibility of running 
Wine on Macs. It was such an attractive idea that a company, CodeWeavers.com, 
decided to make a business of creating the OS X version of Wine. The company 
offers three products:
 
✓ CrossOver Mac, for Windows applications, except games
 
✓ CrossOver Games, for selected Windows games, including most of the 
Steam repertoire
 
✓ CrossOver Pro, includes both of the above plus additional support
The good news is that these solutions cost a lot less than a Windows license. 
The bad news, which CodeWeavers freely admits, is that they work fully with 
only a few Windows programs, though the list is expanding.
At the time I wrote this book, CrossOverMac officially supported the following 
applications:
 
✓ Microsoft Office 2007, 2003, XP, 2000, and 97 in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, 
and Outlook. Access is supported only in Office 2000.
 
✓ In addition to Office, CrossOverMac supports Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 6, Microsoft Project, Microsoft Visio, and Quicken.
CrossOverGames officially supports these games:
 
✓ EVE Online
 
✓ Guild Wars

286
Part VI: More Software, More Choices 
 
✓ Prey
 
✓ Steam games, including Call of Duty 2, Civilization IV, Counterstrike, 
Counterstrike: Source, Half-Life 2, Max Payne 2, Peggle Extreme, Team 
Fortress 2, World of Warcraft
Many other programs work to a usable degree, and improvements are 
continually being made. You can check the status of the program or programs 
you’re interested in by visiting the CodeWeavers compatibility center. The 
company even has a process by which you can influence its priorities in 
getting applications to work. See www.codeweavers.com/compatibility.
 
As a Windows user, you probably already have several of the supported 
programs and games. Because CodeWeavers offers a free trial period, you 
have little to lose — except some time — and a lot to gain by downloading the 
trial versions and checking out your favorite apps and games. You may even 
find that old games that no longer run on the Windows software you use come 
back to life on your new Mac.
One other important use for CrossOver exists. If your organization has 
Windows applications and you want them to work on Macs, CodeWeavers 
can test the application to see whether it works on CrossOver, and if not, 
attempt to make it work by fixing problems the way developers fix any bug. 
CodeWeavers even has tools to help you. Because a free trial period is 
available, you have little to lose in giving it a try.
Security issues
It’s neat to have Windows at your disposal on 
your Mac, but remember that it’s still Windows. 
You should follow all security and antivirus 
guidelines recommended for Windows on a 
PC, including enabling Windows Update and 
having up-to-date antivirus software installed. 
As a former Windows user, you know the drill.
Be wise and retrieve your mail and do your Web 
surfing in OS X, and restrict Internet access 
on the Windows side to situations where it’s 
needed, such as accessing sites that you 
already know about and trust and that require 
Internet Explorer or ActiveX. You should also 
pick a password for Windows that’s different 
from the one you use on the Mac. See Chapter 
10 for password suggestions.
One advantage of running Windows on a Mac 
is that you can keep important files on the 
Mac side, using shared folders. Then, if your 
Windows machine becomes infected by nasty 
malware, you can simply delete the Windows 
virtual disk and restore a copy that you saved 
when you were sure it was in a clean state, or 
simply reinstall Windows from the original disc. 
Virus hunters use virtualization for this very 
reason.

The first chapter of this part covers kids, seniors, and 
people with disabilities. Then I discuss using Macs in 
business settings, the heartland of Windows dominance. 
The last chapter in this part dives a bit deeper into OS X 
and introduces the Unix layer underneath all the graphical

uying a computer for home use involves a special set of challenges. 
In a work environment, personal computing may just mean that each 
employee has his own machine. But in a family setting, personal means much 
more. Computers become part of us, woven into our daily routine and even 
into our psyches. The choices we make in which computers we give our 
children and how we set them up can affect their development. For an elderly 
person or someone with a disability, having the right computer can improve 
their quality of life.
In this chapter, you find out about features and software on your Mac that 
help kids, parents, and the whole family enjoy their home computer that 
much more.
Macs for Kids
Kids take to computers like raccoons to suburbia. It may not be the 
environment that nature intended, but kids quickly become comfortable — 
perhaps too comfortable — in front of a screen.
Check out these positive factors about computers for kids. Computers do the 
following:
 
✓ Provide an outlet for artistic expression and creativity
 
✓ Offer information about every topic imaginable (much of it true)

290
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
✓ Let kids chat with friends and be at home at the same time, without 
running up minutes on their cellphone accounts
 
✓ Offer opportunities for personal contact with new people and cultures
 
✓ Help develop and improve reading, writing, and language skills
 
✓ Support kids with special needs and their parents
You find some big negative aspects as well:
 
✓ Video games can be unbelievably addictive, especially for boys.
 
✓ Time spent in front of a computer is time not spent doing chores or 
homework or engaging in ordinary play.
 
✓ Our kids are getting fat from a lack of physical activity. TV is the main 
culprit, but computers are catching up.
 
✓ Kids generally can’t resist the temptation to download music and videos 
without paying for them.
 
✓ It’s also too tempting to copy material from the Web and pass it off as 
their own schoolwork.
 
✓ Like suburbia must seem to raccoons, the Internet is littered with 
“garbage cans.”
Establishing parental control
If you’re switching your kids to a Mac, you have a unique opportunity to 
regain some control over their computer use. You have to act fast, though. 
Your kids probably know more about computers than you do, so you should 
set things up correctly from the beginning. I go over the steps in more detail 
here than for other topics because establishing control over your kids’ 
computer use is vital and because I know how harried and time constrained 
most parents are.
 
The first thing you must do is make yourself the administrator for your kids’ 
Mac. You should be the one to work through the start-up sequence described 
in Chapter 4 and become the first user of the computer. If you’re adding your 
kids’ accounts to the Mac you use, you have in effect already done this.
Next, set up a separate account for each child who will use the computer. If 
you have more than one child and are giving each one her own Mac (what 
good parents you are!), you should still give each kid an account on each 
machine. That way, if one child borrows an older sibling’s Mac, she still has 
the restrictions you impose.

291
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
Setting up accounts is easy. Follow these steps:
 
1. Select Ú➪System Preferences and click the Accounts icon.
 
 It’s the one with a silhouette of two heads. You see the pane shown in 
Figure 17-1.
 
Figure 17-1:

2. Click the plus sign in the lower-left corner to add a new account.
 
 You may have to click the Lock icon first and enter your password.
 
3. When you see a pane that asks for the name and password of the new 
account, as shown in Figure 17-2, fill in the name and password you 
want your child to have.
Computers and young children
I’m not convinced that young kids (the fourth 
grade or younger) need to have computer 
access. Young kids need to relate to the real 
world and, especially, to other people. They 
do that by playing with toys, kids, and adults. 
Computers are mostly a distraction from the 
task of being children. Perhaps you can make 
an argument that computers are less passive 
babysitters than television. But neither is par-
ticularly desirable, and kid computer use should 
be supervised anyway.
Think long and hard before introducing your 
kids to computers, and make careful choices 
about what kind of programs and Web sites 
they’re exposed to.

292
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
Figure 17-2: 
The New 
Account 
pane.
 
 
 Here are some tips for choosing names and passwords specifically for 
kids:
 
• Because the account name and short name are used in OS X for 
many purposes and may show up during Internet use, do not 
include your kids’ last name on the account. Billy or Billy R should 
do fine.
 
• In Chapter 10, I emphasize the security value of using random 
passwords. If anything, security is more important for kids on the 
Internet. You can ask OS X to suggest a short, 8- to 10-character, 
random password of letters and numbers by clicking the Key icon 
next to the password field.
 
• An alternative for kids who are very young is to combine a name 
and number from two different parts of their lives, such as a 
character from a favorite story and their room number in school.
 
• Tape your child’s password to his bed until the child memorizes it. 
It doesn’t take long.
 
• While you’re at it, help your child make up a separate password 
for all the junk Internet sites that require registration. Some sites 
reportedly collect passwords and offer them for sale for nefarious 
purposes.
 
4. Because this account is for a child, select New Account➪Managed with 
Parental Controls.
 
 Other account options include Standard and Administrator. Don’t give 
your kids administrative privileges. They will pester you from time to 
time, though, to enter your password so that they can do something that 
requires these privileges, such as installing downloaded software. Trust 
me: You want to know about these events. Ask questions about how the 
software will be used, and ask to visit the Web site from which it came. 
Don’t be afraid to veto the installation.

293
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
 
5. Click the Create Account button.
 
 When you’re done, you see the Accounts system preferences pane again, 
shown in Figure 17-3, this time with the new account highlighted.

7. Click the Open Parental Controls button.
 
 The Parental Controls System pane appears, as shown in Figure 17-4. 
You see tabs for several other panes:
 
• System

• Mail & iChat
 
• Time Limits
 
• Logs
 
8. Each pane has settings that let you sculpt your child’s computer and 
Internet usage. Using the information in the sections that follow, set 
up the controls for the account.
 
 By logging on as the administrator under your own account, you can 
return to the Parental Controls settings to adjust them, if needed. Just 
open System Preferences from the Apple menu.

The System pane
The first item in the Parental Controls System pane (refer to Figure 17-4) lets 
you require Simple Finder for this account. Simple Finder replaces the usual 
OS X desktop with a screen that contains big, square buttons. Each button 
launches an application from the list of those you permit. Many applications 
provide reduced menus when Simple Finder is in use. Simple Finder removes 
much of the complexity of the OS X interface and makes the computer more 
of an appliance.
Below that choice is an area where you can limit the applications this user 
can launch to only those you specify. Simply deselect those you don’t want 
to allow access to. At the bottom of the pane is a series of check boxes that 
lets you give this user specific privileges:
 
✓ Can Administer Printers: This option might be a good idea for kids 
who are a little older. They might learn enough to help you with printer 
problems.
 
✓ Can Burn CDs and DVDs: Wait on this one until you set clear guidelines 
on what your kids can and cannot share with friends.
 
✓ Can Change Password: Knowing your kid’s password makes it easier to 
check what’s on the computer, but you have other ways to do this.
 
✓ Can Modify the Dock: Let young kids mess with the Dock, and they 
pester you to find the stuff they dragged off it (just to watch it go poof). 
Don’t select this check box.

295
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
The Content pane
OS X offers a number of options to limit what content your kids can see, using 
the Content pane depicted in Figure 17-5. One example is the Hide Profanity 
in Dictionary check box. However, at some stage in your child’s development, 
it might be better for her to find out what words mean from a dictionary 
rather than on the street. You can also ask OS X to try to limit access to adult 
sites automatically. If you then click the Customize button, you can list sites 
you want added or specifically banned. The third option restricts your kids 
to only those sites you specifically choose.
 
Figure 17-5: 
The 
Parental

Content

The rest of the Content pane offers you some choices about what kind of 
content your kids get to see online:
 
✓ Allow Unrestricted Access to Websites: Select this check box only for 
older kids. You can still check the logs to see where they’re going.
 
✓ Try to Limit Access to Adult Websites Automatically: This option 
uses filters that attempt to determine what is and isn’t kid appropriate. 
The filters aren’t foolproof, occasionally letting bad stuff in and, at the 
same time, limiting access to sites that are harmless. And, you find a 
third class of sites to consider: those that provide sound information 
on health, sex, and what’s happening to kids’ bodies as they mature. If 
you select this check box, a Customize button appears. Click it and you 
see a pane with two text areas. In the top one, you specify sites that are 
always allowed, perhaps a site you reviewed with health information 
for kids. The bottom one lists sites that are never allowed, a trickier 
proposition because so many exist.

296
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
✓ Allow Access to Only These Websites: This option may be the sanest 
one for the younger set. You can surf sites first and add ones that you 
deem appropriate. You can even add Safari bookmarks and folders to 
this list.
The Mail & iChat pane
As I mention in Chapter 8, your Mac is an excellent communication tool. 
Your kids will figure out that much faster than you do. The Mail & iChat pane, 
shown in Figure 17-6, lets you decide to whom they can talk to by way of 
e-mail or instant messaging (IM). Note that the controls in this pane apply 
to only Apple Mail and iChat. If your kids can download another mail or IM 
program, such as AOL AIM, all bets are off. Some mail programs, such as 
Yahoo! Mail and Gmail, require only a Web browser. So, if you want your 
white list restrictions enforced, you must limit the programs your children 
can download and also block access to e-mail sites.
 
Figure 17-6: 
The

This pane also lets you specify an e-mail address — yours, presumably — 
where notifications are sent when someone not on the white list attempts to 
contact your kid in Mail or iChat.

I love this feature. Other programs for limiting kids’ use are often too complex 
for mere parents to understand, much less set up and explain to their kids. 
This one is easy. You have two types of control, as shown in Figure 17-7. One 
limits the amount of time a child can use the computer each day. The other 
blocks any usage after bedtime. And, you find two sets of controls for each 
limit: one for weekdays and the other for the weekends. It’s simple, and it 
works.

to-use Time 
Limits pane.
 
The Logs pane
OS X keeps track of what your kids are up to online. You can see the logs by 
periodically visiting this pane, as shown in Figure 17-8.
You can choose to see logged activity for Web sites your child visited, Web 
sites he attempted to visit but access was blocked, applications he used, and 
iChat conversations he engaged in.

Setting limits
Having all these tools at a parent’s disposal is great, but setting limits can 
be hard. It’s always easier to start with more restricted access and add time 
and privileges as the child matures and demonstrates responsibility. For 
very young children, not having computer access may be the easiest starting 
point.
Discuss reasonable computer limits with other parents in your circle. A 
group consensus can be easier to enforce. And, pay attention to your own 
computer usage. Kids learn by example.

Keeping kids safe online
Incidents in which kids get hurt and that have any connection to the Internet 
always get great play in the press. Incidents in which kids get hurt on the 
street or at the playground often don’t. Still, your kids need to develop some 
online smarts about online conduct. Here are some tips you can share with 
them. Avoid heavy-handed lectures with threats of draconian punishment, 
though. You want your child to feel safe coming to you if she encounters 
anything that feels creepy.

299
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
Here are some basic guidelines that you should review periodically with 
your kids:
 
✓ Keep your personal information private. Consider your last name, 
address, and phone number private information that’s not to be shared 
with people you meet online. Be careful if the online person asks a lot 
of questions about you, such as where you go to school or what your 
parents do for a living.
 
✓ Protect your password by keeping it to yourself. No one should ever 
need it.
 
✓ Be aware that people often aren’t who they say they are. Sometimes, 
people on the Internet pretend to be quite different from who they truly 
are. A child may pretend to be an adult, or an adult might pretend to be 
a kid. Someone may pretend to be a teacher or doctor or police officer 
when they aren’t. A boy can even pretend to be a girl, or vice versa.
 
✓ Ask your parents or guardian before meeting someone in person. 
Never agree to see someone in person whom you first met online 
without asking your parents first.
 
✓ Remember that people can find out a lot about your family on the 
Internet. If someone you don’t know says that he’s a friend of your 
family and asks you to go with him, don’t go just because he seems to 
know a lot about you and your parents.
 
✓ Let your parents or a trusted adult be your confidant. If someone 
is making you feel uncomfortable or scaring you, tell your parents. 
Especially be sure to tell your parents if the person asks you not to. 
Don’t close the chat window or turn off the computer.
Social networking sites
Social networking Web sites, such as MySpace.com, Facebook.com, and 
Twitter.com, have integrated themselves into the social lives of teenagers. 
Facebook, originally aimed at high school and college students, has more than 
200 million active users. (It had 16 million when I wrote the first edition of 
this book.) MySpace has more than 100 million users. Facebook and MySpace 
encourage their members to build profiles with personal information, including 
accounts and photographs of recent activities. Members designate other 
members as “friends” who then gain additional access to their page. Both sites 
have privacy options that members can select that can limit which information 
nonfriends can see and which information will be revealed about them in a 
search. Members use the site to send messages to other users.

300
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
MySpace requires members to be at least 14 years old and sets privacy 
restrictions on members 16 and under. Restrictions are also in place for 
members over 18 connecting with the youngest members. However, kids and 
adults can always lie about their age. Potential employers and colleges might 
also look at candidate profiles on these sites.
Young people start using these social networking sites about the same time 
as they stop listening to what their parents say. Still, it’s worth having a 
conversation with your teen about the short-term and long-term privacy 
concerns and the dangers of meeting, in person, people you know only 
online. At some point, they won’t bring you along, but you can still implore 
them to at least bring along a friend for the first meeting.
Also see Chapter 14 for more on whether parents should “friend” their kids.
Downloading music
Another aspect of kid culture on the Internet, downloading music without 
paying for it, continues to generate controversy. The recording industry 
blames the practice for a slowdown in sales. Others question this and point 
to high prices for CDs and a lack of compelling product as the cause.
The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has managed to shut 
down free file-sharing sites such as Napster and Grokster early, through legal 
action, but other peer-to-peer systems, such as BitTorrent.com, which have 
no central indexing service — and which are used for other purposes — have 
proven more difficult to stop. So the RIAA has started taking legal action 
against individual downloaders and their parents. Although some people 
have fought these suits, most are forced to accept expensive settlement 
terms.
If I give my kids a Mac, won’t they be unprepared 
for a Windows world?
I’ve heard this objection more than once. For 
now and the foreseeable future, the work-
ing world is dominated by Windows. Many 
colleges require entering students to have a 
Windows laptop — though some prefer Macs. 
One answer, of course, is that Macs can run 
Windows (see Chapter 16). So, if your child 
takes his MacBook to school, he can use 
whatever software is required. But you have a 
better response. For years, Microsoft has fol-
lowed Apple’s lead in introducing new inter-
faces and features. Several reviewers have 
remarked on the similarities between Windows 
7 and OS X. So, giving your kids a Mac may be 
the best way to prepare them for the Windows 
of the future.

301
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
Whatever you think of the RIAA tactics and their justification, much can be 
said for staying out of their gun sights. Most people agree that performers 
deserve to be compensated for their work. Giving your kid an iPod and a 
computer without giving him the means to pay for songs is asking for trouble. 
You might give a monthly allowance at the iTunes Store, perhaps based on 
chores or schoolwork. Go to the iTunes Store and click the iTunes Gifts link 
in the Quick Links section.
Finding software for kids
Kids have lots to do with just the iLife suite supplied with all Macs. You can 
buy or download many other titles for free. However, adult supervision is 
required whenever software is downloaded from the Internet. One source 
for children’s software that runs on Macs is the Apple Macintosh Products 
Guide, at http://guide.apple.com/uscategories/kids.lasso. You 
can also check out the education page at http://guide.apple.com/
uscategories/education.lasso. Many major Web sites have special 
sections for kids. And, a Google search for kid-safe Web sites turns up several 
guides to this type of site. But no substitute exists for checking out new sites 
yourself before letting your kids visit.
Macs for Seniors
The extraterrestrials who monitor our television signals must be certain that 
no one over 40 buys Apple products because no one older ever shows up in 
its TV commercials. The truth is that people over 40 are more likely to buy 
Macs. One reason may be that older consumers seek quality over price. They 
remember how difficult it was to use computers, and they know who made it 
easy.
A still-older generation, composed of the parents of the 40s and 50s set, in 
many cases has never used computers. Personal computers offer many ways 
to improve the lives of these seniors, and Macs are the ideal choice for them. 
Although some seniors start riding motorcycles and take up scuba diving, 
most have a harder time picking up new skills.
If you’re buying a Mac for your parents, consider that you may end up as 
their main source of technical support. Buying them a computer that’s easier 
to set up, easier to show them how to use, and less likely to require help with 
problems such as viruses and malware will save you time and money in the 
long run.

302
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
More importantly, giving your folks a computer that’s easy to use and less 
trouble-prone makes them more likely to use it and derive benefit from it. 
Seniors can benefit by using a Mac in these areas:
 
✓ E-mail and instant messaging: These are great ways to stay in touch 
with friends and family, particularly grandchildren who are away at 
school.
 
✓ Video iChat: This feature can enable seniors to be part of family events, 
even if they can no longer travel easily. During a recent visit to my 
cousins in California, their new granddaughter ate her first solid food as 
the other grandparents, in New Jersey, watched by way of iChat on my 
cousins’ iMac.
 
✓ Voice over IP (VoIP) services: These can help keep phone bills down, 
especially for relatives in the “old country.”
 
✓ Social networking: Sites such as Facebook aren’t just for college 
students any more. Seniors are finding them a helpful place to connect 
with old friends and make new ones, by posting photos of grandchildren, 
vacation trips, and other mementos.
 
✓ Health maintenance and medical condition sites: Online support 
groups exist for almost every medical condition imaginable.
 
✓ Internet shopping: Seniors who have limited mobility can be 
empowered by shopping on their own.
 
✓ Disability sites: The Mac’s clean interface can make it easier for 
seniors with disabilities to use. I talk more about Macs and people with 
disabilities in the next section of this chapter.
A useful way to preserve family history is to digitize old family photos by 
using a scanner or commercial service and asking your parents to annotate 
them in iPhoto. If typing is a problem, you can put the photos in a slide show 
and have your parents record their comments in GarageBand as they step 
through the photos.
 
Simple Finder, which I mention earlier in this chapter as a way to make Macs 
easier for young children to operate, can perform the same function for 
seniors who may be unfamiliar with computers. To give your elder family 
member a complete guide to using a Mac and its software, written with 
the needs of a computing beginner in mind, check out Macs For Seniors For 
Dummies, by Mark Chambers (Wiley Publishing).

303
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
Determining which model to buy
For seniors who travel regularly, a basic MacBook is an inexpensive, do-
everything companion. By seeking hotel accommodations that include 
Internet access, seniors can stay in touch anywhere in the world. Using 
their digital camera and iSight, iPhoto, and iWeb, they can share their travel 
experiences with family and friends almost as these events happen.
For those who mostly stay at home, the iMac is hard to beat. It’s a single 
unit, so no wires will become accidentally disconnected, resulting in panicked 
service calls to you. The low-end model has everything seniors need.
If seniors enjoy sharing photos of their grandkids, an iPhone or iPod touch is 
another useful gift, allowing them to always carry a whole library of photos 
with them. 
Speeding photos to the grandparents
Perhaps the best application for grandparents is the iPhoto photocasting 
capability. You put the latest photos of your kids into an iPhoto album and 
click the Photocast This Album button. The album is uploaded to your 
MobileMe account, where it’s “published” for authorized subscribers.
Assuming that the grandparents’ computer subscribes to your family photo 
feed, a simple one-time setup, the photos are automatically downloaded to 
their iPhoto library, where they can be watched immediately. The photos 
can even be displayed as their screen saver. As you add new photos to the 
photocast album, they’re automatically uploaded and then downloaded.
To subscribe to a photocast, in iPhoto, choose File➪Subscribe to Photocast. 
Fill in the address of the photocast when you’re prompted. Alternatively, you 
can click a link to the photocast on your Web page or in an e-mail message.
You make a photocast display as the screen saver by following these steps:
 
1. Select Ú➪System Preferences.
 
2. Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon in System Preferences.
 
3. Click the Screen Saver tab.

304
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
4. In the list that appears on the left side of the Screen Saver pane, 
shown in Figure 17-9, scroll down to Pictures and then click MobileMe 
and RSS.
 
5. Click the Options button.
 
6. In the pane that appears, select the feeds you want to display in the 
screen saver.
 
 You can reorder the feeds shown by dragging them to the new order.
 
 Your latest photos of the kids now appear on the grandparents’ Mac as 
soon as you add them to your photocast album in iPhoto.

Saver pane.
 
Macs for Specific Needs
OS X provides an array of accessibility features that enable people to use 
the Mac in ways that are different from — or more comfortable than — 
the standard setup of reading onscreen at the default sizes and using the 
keyboard and mouse to give computer commands. You control most of these 
features from the Universal Access pane in System Preferences. (The lone 
exception is VoiceOver, the Apple screen reader, which has its own setup 
utility in the Utilities folder, but that utility can also be easily accessed from 
the Universal Access Seeing pane. See Figure 17-10.) The following sections 
introduce the available options and describe how they work.

305
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
 
Figure 17-10: 
The 
Universal

Seeing 
pane.
 
Setting up the screen when 
you have limited vision
When you click the Universal Access icon, you see the Seeing pane (refer to 
Figure 17-10), where you can control features that aid people with vision 
difficulties. Note that the pane appears in large type to avoid the Catch-22 
problem where someone with limited vision can’t use the tool to increase the 
type size because the tool’s type size is too small.
Here’s a quick introduction to the available features:
 
✓ VoiceOver: This pane turns VoiceOver on or off and can send you to the 
VoiceOver setup utility. I explain VoiceOver in more detail in the next 
section.
 
✓ Zoom: When you enable the handy Zoom feature, you can mag-
nify the screen by pressing Ô+Option+=. Pressing Ô+Option+- 
(Ô+Option+hyphen) reverses the magnification.
 
✓ Display: In this section, you can change the screen from black on white to 
white on black, if it helps. Move the slider to adjust the contrast, if you like.
 
✓ Enable Access for Assistive Devices check box: Selecting this check 
box enables your Mac to work with a variety of assistive technologies 
and software packages designed to help users with special computer-
use needs. For more information, see the Macintosh Product Guide at 
http://guide.apple.com/uscategories/assisttech.lasso.

306
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
Listening rather than reading
The Apple VoiceOver screen reader was designed to make using a Mac easier 
by speaking the contents of the screen. Although that may seem to be a 
simple and obvious idea, for someone trying to use a computer in this way, 
a poorly designed screen reader is almost useless. A user wants the screen 
reader to speak the text of interest at the moment and as little else as possible. 
The user also wants to be able to speed up the reading as much as possible 
without losing intelligibility. Otherwise, work becomes painfully slow.
Therefore, it isn’t surprising that VoiceOver comes with a plethora of 
customizable options. It also offers several different voices, including Alex, 
a voice that’s engineered to work well when it’s sped up. Figure 17-11 shows 
the VoiceOver Utility Verbosity screen.
 
Figure 17-11: 
The 
VoiceOver 
Utility 
Verbosity 
screen.
 
You find eight options in the sidebar, each with many more options:
 
✓ General lets you control portable preferences.
 
✓ Verbosity controls how much VoiceOver says in various situations, such 
as when it encounters a misspelled word. For example, a user might 
want a different behavior when reading a memo she received versus 
proofreading her own writing.
 
✓ Speech lets you choose among some two dozen virtual speakers and 
adjust their settings. Most are more fun than productive. Voices with 
real names, such as Alex or Kathy, tend to be more suited for serious 
use than nicknames such as Bubbles. But you can find exceptions. 
Princess isn’t bad, but Albert is. The Pronunciation tab lets you customize 
how special characters, initialisms, abbreviations, and other elements 
are spoken.
 
✓ Navigation determines what VoiceOver does as you move around the 
screen and change focus.

307
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
 
✓ Web controls how you hear the content of Web pages — from beginning 
to end (DOM) or with common elements grouped together for faster 
scanning.
 
✓ Sound controls sound output.
 
✓ Visuals controls how VoiceOver elements, such as its cursor, are shown 
onscreen.
 
✓ NumPad lets you assign special functions to the numeric keypad keys.
 
✓ Braille has settings for Braille input and output for people with visual 
disabilities.
Adjusting settings in the Hearing pane
Compared to the Seeing pane, there’s not much to the Hearing pane. A personal 
computer is controlled primarily by visual cues, anyway. In this pane, you 
can tell OS X to flash the screen when it issues an alert, a handy feature for 
those of us with full hearing. You also find a button that opens the Sound 
System Preferences pane, where you can adjust the volume of your Mac’s 
audio. You can generally do that also by using your keyboard.
Changing how the keyboard works
The Keyboard pane, shown in Figure 17-12, offers settings that can make 
using a keyboard easier:
 
Figure 17-12: 
The 
Universal 
Access 
Keyboard 
pane.
 

308
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
✓ If you have difficulty completing complex key presses, such as the 
Ô+Option+= combination for Zoom, mentioned earlier in this chapter, 
try turning on Sticky Keys. The Sticky Keys option, which is controlled 
from this pane, lets you press the keys one at a time to effect the 
combination you want. For example, you first press Ô, and then Option, 
and then the equal sign (=). You can also control what feedback OS X 
gives you when you do this.
 
✓ Another problem that some people have is unsteady hands; they may 
accidentally press a needed key more than once. Another option in 
this pane lets you set a time delay between key presses to reduce this 
problem.
 
✓ Note that you can find additional settings related to the keyboard in the 
Keyboard & Mouse pane of System Preferences.
Speaking of keyboards, a number of specialized keyboards are available to 
assist with various problems, ranging from repetitive stress injuries to users 
who can use only one hand. As long as a specialized keyboard uses a USB 
interface, the keyboard should work on a Mac.
Mousing the way you like
Some people have a hard time using a computer mouse or trackpad. If the 
default mouse or trackpad setup doesn’t work well for you or someone in your 
household, give the following options in the Mouse & Trackpad pane a try:
 
✓ Turn on Mouse Keys: For people who have trouble using a mouse, Apple 
provides an alternative, where you move the cursor around the screen 
by using the numeric keypad. After Mouse Keys is turned on, pressing any 
digit other than 5 or 0 moves the cursor a short distance in the direction of 
that key (relative to 5). The 5 key acts like a mouse click. The 0 key acts 
like press and hold — say, if you want to drag a file to a folder. When 
you have the file where you want to drop it, press 5 to release the hold.
 
 Mouse Keys work best with a keyboard that has a separate numeric 
keypad. If you have a laptop or standard sized keyboard and want to 
make extensive use of this feature, consider adding the Apple Keyboard 
with Numeric Keypad or an external USB numeric keypad.
 
 Mouse Keys is a feature worth knowing about if your mouse or touchpad 
is ever unusable and you’re in a rush to finish something.
 
✓ Increase the mouse cursor size: Another feature that’s located in the 
Universal Access Mouse & Trackpad pane and that’s valuable for all 
users is the ability to make the mouse cursor arrow bigger. Particularly 
when it’s at high-resolution display settings, you can easily lose that 
sucker in the desktop clutter.

309
 Chapter 17: Switching with the Whole Family in Mind
 
✓ Tab to access menus: You can also eliminate the need for mouse use to 
access menus. Instead, you press Tab to move between control items 
and press the arrow keys to select within menus. This option is turned 
on by using the Keyboard & Mouse window in System Preferences, on 
the Keyboard Shortcuts tab. The Full Keyboard Access option is at the 
bottom.
If mice don’t work for you, options other than Mouse Keys are available for 
Macs:
 
✓ Trackballs: Have a smooth, round ball on top that you roll in various 
directions to control the cursor.
 
✓ Touchpads: Allow you to control the cursor by sliding your finger on a 
sensitive surface. Apple laptops have touchpads built-in, but you can 
buy third-party units to use with your desktop setup.
 
✓ Graphics tablets: Have a flat surface with a position-sensing pen. If you 
use one, you can take advantage of the Apple Inkwell technology, which 
can turn handwriting into text that you can use in any application.
Again, you should buy one of these with a USB interface. More than one 
pointing device can be attached and active at the same time. Even if you like 
using a mouse, having an alternative way to enter text can reduce problems 
with repetitive stress.
 
If you use your mouse a lot and feel pain from repetitive stress, one suggestion 
I’ve found useful is to move the mouse and mouse pad to the other side of the 
keyboard so that you use it with your nondominant hand — the left hand, in 
my case. It takes a little getting used to, but if you’re starting to feel fatigued in 
your dominant hand, it’s worth a try.

Chapter 18
Switching Your Business to Macs
In This Chapter
▶ Considering why Macs are good for businesses
▶ Using Macs in small businesses
▶ Adapting mid-sized businesses to Macs
▶ Adding Macs to the enterprise
M
icrosoft owns the enterprise desktop. Owns it. Most of Apple’s small 
market share comes from home and educational users. Many large 
companies have strict Windows-only policies. Lots of business software is 
available only for Windows. So why even think about using Macs? Why did 
we kill a bunch of trees to bring you a chapter pushing Macs for businesses?
In this chapter, you find out how Macs can produce a good return on 
investment for a business, as well as services and products that help small 
and midsize businesses stay nimble and competitive, with Macs working for 
them behind the scenes.
Why Use Macs in Your Business?
The cop-out answer is that Macs now run Windows too, as I explain in 
Chapter 16. That does at least answer the concern about Windows-only 
software you might need for your business. But by itself, it’s not much of 
a reason. It doesn’t make business sense to buy a Mac that may cost a few 
hundred dollars more and then pay Microsoft for a Vista license, just to get 
a pretty computer that runs Windows. Sure, iMacs look spiffy in front offices 
and MacBook Airs turn heads at meetings, but that won’t convince the bean 
counters.

312
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
Total cost of ownership
Another common justification given for businesses switching to Macs is total 
cost of ownership. Macs may cost a bit more up front, but savings can be 
achieved down the road. Here’s why:
 
✓ There’s no need for antivirus software.
 
✓ Training costs are lower because Macs are easier to use.
 
✓ Support costs are lower because Macs have fewer software problems 
and users can often fix their own problems.
 
✓ Macs seem to have a longer service life than Windows machines, so they 
don’t need to be replaced as often.
The total cost of ownership argument has some merit. One organization I 
work with pays over $1,000 per year in support for each Windows PC it owns. 
Cutting that down would go right to the bottom line.
But the counterargument usually given is that the organization has already 
made large investments in a Windows-oriented support organization. 
Firewalls and antivirus and intrusion detectors are already in place. In the 
short run, adding Macs may increase the cost because any additional 
support costs are a new expense. Who has time to worry about the long run?
Increased productivity
You can easily count the initial purchase price of computers you buy. Support 
costs are more difficult to calculate, but a well-run organization has a handle 
on those as well. The impact of your choice of computer platform on individual 
worker productivity is much harder to measure. Most organizations don’t have 
expense-tracking codes for “I’m purging viruses,” “The network is down,” “I 
can’t get the printer to work,” or “I’m waiting for tech support to call back.” 
Pesky problems like that don’t just eat up time — they sap energy, enthusiasm, 
and morale.
You get what you pay for
To succeed in the intense competition of a global economy, everything a 
business does has to stand out from the crowd. Mediocre tools ultimately 
lead to mediocre work. Your salesperson’s PowerPoint presentation will look 
like every other salesperson’s PowerPoint presentation. The huckster with a 
Mac and a Keynote show will stand out.

313
 Chapter 18: Switching Your Business to Macs
Although it’s hard to gauge productivity, it’s not so hard to measure the effect 
of improvements. Suppose that working with a Mac increases productivity just 
5 percent. (I think it’s more.) Sum up the annual pay of each worker who uses 
a computer. Add in fringe benefits and direct overhead — stuff like the cost of 
office space and administrative support. Now multiply that number by 0.05. 
That’s how much using Windows costs you each year.
Plays well with Linux
In most organizations, some workers have little or no creative component 
in their computer work. Surely they don’t need a Mac. They may not need 
Windows, either. A number of Linux distributions can support workers whose 
main job is data entry or telephone support. Mac OS X and Linux share a Unix 
heritage and generally work well together. A great deal of Linux software has 
been ported to Macs, so tools can be used on both platforms. Best of all, you 
don’t need to buy new computers to run Linux. It should run fine on the older 
PCs you’re replacing with Macs.
The only constant in business is change
The best reason to switch to Macs is because computer technology is 
changing, and it’s changing the world along with it. And Apple, not Microsoft, 
is leading the charge. Microsoft is too busy making money off the way things 
were. Stay hitched to Microsoft and you’ll always be safely in the middle of 
the pack — except that the middle of the pack is where businesses wither 
and die.
What are some of these changes? Here’s a partial list:
 
✓ Mobile computing: Our electronic lives are migrating from our desks 
to our laps and now to our pockets and purses. Some of us feel naked 
without a live Internet connection at hand. We carry our most important 
files in our pockets or purses on flash drives. The Apple iPhone and iPod 
touch have created an integrated mobile computing future where we 
have all the tools we rely on with us wherever we go.
 
✓ Electronic commerce: The Internet now drives economic growth and 
levels the playing field between large and small companies. People who 
buy online shop online, and word-of-Web drives sales. First impressions 
of early customers are aggregated by blogs and RSS feeds and spread 
worldwide. Lapses in quality are magnified. You have to get it right the 
first time.

314
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
✓ Web 2.0: The World Wide Web is now a two-way medium. Consumers 
are spending more of their time viewing content produced by other 
consumers. A clever YouTube spoof can undo a multimillion-dollar 
marketing campaign. Speed is of the essence. It can’t wait ’til the 
Monday morning staff meeting.
 
✓ Globalization: Your next competitor could emerge from a country you 
never heard of. And so could your next technology supplier. And so 
could your next market.
 
✓ Open source business software: The open source model — which has 
been quite successful in the development of BSD UNIX, Linux, and Gnu — 
is being taken up by groups trying to create nonproprietary software 
systems. These groups are using open standards and open source code 
to create software that meets basic business needs. The wide adoption 
of XML as a standard for data interchange has spawned many efforts 
to create nonproprietary data exchange formats for specific business 
needs, such as hr-xml.org in human resources. As these efforts 
mature, they provide viable, platform-independent alternatives to 
expensive software packages.
 
✓ Software as a Service (SaaS): The other new approach to business 
software is for vendors to host the software on their own servers and 
sell the services over the Internet on a subscription basis, typically a 
per-user, per-month fee. This solution reduces the need for in-house 
hardware and support personnel and allows employees to access the 
service from remote locations. SaaS systems are accessed by way of 
standard Web browsers, reducing the importance of being on one 
operating system versus another.
 
✓ Virtualization: The relationship between computers and operating 
systems is no longer monogamous. One operating system can span 
several processor cores, and one processor can support several 
operating systems at one time. The impetus for standardizing on the 
operating system you’ve always used makes less business sense. Pick 
the best tool for the job. You can find an introduction to virtualization in 
Chapter 16.
 
✓ Computer crime: In the good old days, malware, such as computer 
viruses and worms, was created by hobbyist hackers interested in the 
intellectual challenge. Now such activities are a big, if illicit, business 
and a significant distraction for legitimate businesses. Direct costs occur 
in terms of data theft and denial of service and the indirect costs of 
cleanup, damage remediation, and reporting. Finally, there’s the hard-to-
measure loss of customer trust and its impact on sales. The malware-free 
Apple track record has saved its users expense and can instill confidence 
in customers.

 Chapter 18: Switching Your Business to Macs
 
✓ High-definition TV: Some of us remember the transition from black-and-
white to color television. At first, color sets were bulky and expensive. 
Programming was limited to a few shows that proclaimed “in living 
color” during their introductions. It took more than a decade, but even-
tually everything was in color. The same sort of transition is under way 
with high-definition TV (HDTV). Apple is following a strategy of “skating 
to where the puck is going to be” and incorporating HD throughout the 
Macintosh line. If your business needs to be HD ready, get Macs.
 
✓ Internet content delivery: Widespread high-speed Internet access has 
led to the Internet becoming a primary means of information content 
delivery. Traditional media is feeling the heat. College students with the 
right concept, like the students who created YouTube and Facebook, 
can become billionaires almost overnight.
 
✓ Lean and mean organizations: To stay competitive in a tight economy, 
businesses are streamlining, outsourcing grunt work, flattening organiza-
tion charts, and increasing the span of control and the number of work-
ers per manager. The emphasis is on lean-and-mean organizations where 
each employee has the ability to recognize opportunities and to respond 
to challenges, and is held accountable for performance. These workers 
need the best tools available.
If some of the changes described here are felt in your business, stop think-
ing of computers as a cost center, like lights and lavatories, and realize that, 
used properly, they are competitive weapons. Realize that many of the most 
creative employees prefer Macs, and respecting their choice attracts them to 
and retains them for your firm. Realize that the quality of the tools you give 
your workers affects your products and services in ways that are hard to 
measure but are inescapable.
Macs in Small Businesses
The case for Macs is easiest to make in a small business. You’re unlikely to 
have legacy software written in Cobol or a staff of information technology 
professionals wedded to doing things “the Microsoft way.” To run a small 
business and grow it into a bigger business, you must have a can-do attitude. 
Two of the most important software tools for small businesses, Microsoft 
Office and QuickBooks (from Quicken.com), already run on Macs. FileMaker 
Pro, from Apple, is highly regarded as a database that can be easily customized 
by nonprogrammers. It’s a cross-platform solution between Mac and 
Windows, with shared access using your in-house network. You can also find 
many specialized programs for Macs, such as computer-aided design and 
cash register operation. Although the selection is smaller than what is 

316
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
available for Windows, the vendors are dedicated to the Mac market and 
generally enjoy the support of a strong user community.
Software as a Service (SaaS) applications, such as ConstantContact.com, 
Salesforce.com, and SugarCRM.com, are a natural fit for small businesses 
because they allow you to have world-class applications at affordable prices 
without the need to hire IT support staff. And, choosing Macs makes a 
statement to prospective staff and customers that you are forward thinking 
and open to new ideas.
Macs in Midsize Businesses
Midsize businesses need an edge to survive against increasingly large 
corporate giants. Small businesses find niches too insignificant to attract 
the giants’ attention. But when a midsize firm finds a good market, a large 
company is soon sniffing around. The midsize firm had better be more nimble 
and creative and in closer touch with its customers’ needs.
The World Wide Web makes reaching customers easier for midsize firms. 
Internet advertising, such as Google AdWords, targets customers who have 
already shown interest in your product categories. The networks of self-
published writers known as the blogosphere can make or break your prod-
uct. Having selected employees write blogs about your industry can be more 
effective than advertising in traditional ways, such as in trade magazines. OS 
X has tools that make blogging easy. Video iChat simplifies and speeds the 
coordinating of responses from different groups in different locales without 
expensive travel.
Macs for the Enterprise
I’m under no illusion that this book will convince any large company to toss 
all its Windows boxes and switch everyone to Macs. I’d be happy if the book 
lowered the barriers to using Macs in a few organizations. The IT staff in 
many companies promulgate strict Windows-only rules. The common 
exception is the graphics department, which produces print and other media 
for outside consumption. My only suggestion is to give Macs a try in other 
places. Equipping a small department or field office with Macs is a low-risk 
experiment. The computers can be converted to Windows, if need be. What 
do you have to lose?

www.apple.com/business. Also try www.macenterprise.org, a 
community of IT professionals sharing information and solutions to support 
Macs in an enterprise.

OS X Advanced
In This Chapter
▶ Taking a look at the file system structure
▶ It’s Unix inside
▶ Text files demystified
▶ Developing software on a Mac
A
pple OS X is a complex piece of software. It draws on rich heritages, 
including earlier versions of Mac OS; Unix, particularly the Berkley 
System Distribution; NeXTstep, developed by a company Steve Jobs 
founded when he left Apple; and the Mach kernel project at Carnegie Mellon 
University. In this chapter, I dive into some of the OS X inner workings. Feel 
free to skip this chapter if you aren’t interested in these details.
Peeking at the File System Structure
One of the most visible influences of Unix on OS X is the way the file system 
is organized. A top-level directory or folder contains these folders:
 
✓ Applications: Holds the entire iLife suite and applications that come 
with OS X. Applications you install, such as Microsoft Office, normally go 
here. It also contains the Utilities folder, where programs such as Disk 
Utility are found.
 
✓ Library: Contains other “under the hood” files that are needed system-
wide. A Library folder also exists within the System folder, and one 
Library folder is available for each user.

318
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
 
✓ System: Contains OS X itself. Nothing you would want to work with 
directly dwells in this folder.
 
✓ Users: Holds each user’s home folder. You can see other users’ folders, 
but you can’t look at files within them without permission, unless you’re 
an administrative user.
You can add files and folders at the top level, but it generally isn’t a good 
idea unless you have a good reason. This situation is more difficult for OS 9 
users to get used to. Normally, you only add files to the Applications folder, 
as part of installing software, or to your user folder.
Exploring the User folder
Each User folder also has a standard set of subfolders. Some longtime 
computer users become quite irritated by all this structure when they first 
encounter it, but later versions of Windows have a similar structure. Swallow 
hard; it’s worth getting used to.
The standard folders in a new User directory are described in this list:
 
✓ Desktop: This folder holds all files on your desktop. Having them in a 
folder like any other is handy. If your desktop gets too cluttered to find 
things easily, you can see its contents in a Finder window instead and 
use the folder-sorting tools to arrange the files and folders on the desktop 
by name, date, size, and other criteria. The Desktop folder is also handy 
when making manual backups, because you can simply copy all desktop 
content to an external hard drive, thumb drive, or optical disc.
 
✓ Documents: Apple intends for you to put all your documents in this 
folder. You don’t have to, of course, but doing it the Apple way avoids 
hassles. You can, and should, add subfolders to whatever depth you 
want within the Documents folder. This is the place to go wild and make 
yourself at home.
 
 If you have all your files neatly organized on your old computer, copy 
them all to the Documents folder. Then move pictures, movies, and 
music to the appropriate folders listed in the following bullets.
 
✓ Library: Programs store data that’s unique for each user, such as 
preferences and caches. You normally don’t add files here yourself, with 
the possible exception of Fonts or some plug-ins. (It’s not the place to 
store your e-books.)
 
✓ Movies: Store your iMovie projects.
 
✓ Music: Stash the iTunes library.
 
✓ Pictures: Store your iPhoto shoebox.

319
 Chapter 19: Desktop to Dashcode: OS X Advanced
 
✓ Public: Each user has this special folder with permissions set so that 
any user on the Mac can access the folder. Within this folder is a folder 
named Drop Box, in which other users can place files and folders but 
can’t look inside. Only the user (and a computer administrator, of 
course) can see what’s in the Drop Box folder.
 
✓ Sites: This folder contains Web page files you created for OS X Web 
Sharing to publish on the Internet — or on your organization’s intranet.
Understanding file permission basics
Permissions determine who can do what with a file. Traditionally, you find 
three levels of permission in a Unix system:
 
✓ Owner: Each file in OS X is owned by someone, such as a user with an 
account, or something, such as the system.
 
✓ Group: A file is also assigned to one group. Groups consist of one or 
more users. You can belong to more than one group, and groups can 
include other groups.
 
✓ Other (sometimes called World): Other refers to anyone with authorized 
access to the computer.
Also in the Unix tradition, you can do these three things with a file:
 
✓ Read it (r).
 
✓ Write to it (w).
 
✓ Execute it (x).
The execute permission takes a bit of explaining. For program files, including 
scripts, it means that you can run the program. For directories, it means that 
you can see which files are inside the directory. It doesn’t mean that you can 
open those files; you just see their names. The letters next to each action are 
abbreviations that are sometimes shown in directory listings.
With this structure, you have nine possibilities: Each level of ownership can 
have any combination of read, write, and execute access to a file, so long as 
owner has privileges at least as high as group, and group at least as high as 
world.
This approach to organizing permissions may seem complex, but it isn’t 
complex enough for some situations. A file can be assigned to only one 
group. What if you want different groups to have different permissions? I 
hope that your personal life isn’t convoluted, but in large organizations, it 
easily can be.

320
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
A more complex set of permissions in OS X is named Access Control List, 
or ACL. Each file and directory can have an ACL. It’s an ordered list of rules. 
Each rule says so-and-so can do such-and-such. OS X ships with ACLs turned 
off, fortunately. The tools to administer them are included in OS X Server.
If you right-click a file and select Get Info from the shortcut menu (or just 
press Ô+I), you see the Info window shown in Figure 19-1. It’s somewhat 
analogous to the Properties window in Windows.
 
Figure 19-1: 
The Info 
window 
for a file. I 
clicked the 
disclosure 
triangles 
to show 
details.
 
Permission information is toward the bottom. You may have to click the tiny 
disclosure triangles to view all the details.
Because permissions are so important to the underlying system software, 
OS X keeps track of what permissions are supposed to be for system files 
and applications installed with the Apple installer. Disk Utility, in the Utilities 
folder, has a Repair Permissions option, for setting the permissions back to 
their pristine values. You should run Repair Permissions every month or so.

 Chapter 19: Desktop to Dashcode: OS X Advanced
Commanding Unix
When I say that OS X is built on top of Unix, you might imagine that I mean 
the way a house is built on top of a foundation: A door or hatch is at the 
ground level, and if you open it, you walk down a creaky set of stairs to a 
place that’s damp and kind of dark, with pipes and wires going every which 
way. It’s good to know about if you blow a fuse or if the heat isn’t working, 
but it’s no place to hang out.
Uh-uh. That’s not what I’m talking about. What I mean is more like a city built 
on top of another city. Tap on a magic mirror, and you’re transported to an 
underground metropolis. The people dress funny and speak a different dialect, 
but the place has lots of interesting places to visit and things to do.
You find a brief introduction to Unix in the sections that follow. You can find 
more online at www.freebsd.org, or pick up a copy of UNIX For Dummies, 
5th Edition, by John R. Levine and Margaret Levine Young (published by 
Wiley).
The magic mirror is Terminal
The magic application that takes you from the outer world of OS X to the 
inner world of Unix is appropriately hidden and unpretentious. It’s Terminal, 
and it’s in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder. Double-click the 
Terminal icon, and you see a window such as the one shown in Figure 19-2. 
The window is labeled Terminal – bash – 80x24.
 
Figure 19-2: 
The 
Terminal 
window.
 

322
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
Here’s a rundown of what you see in the Terminal window:
 
✓ The last number indicates that the window holds 24 lines, each one 80 
monospaced characters long.
 
✓ Drag the lower-right corner of the window and you can make it bigger 
or smaller, but the 80-character initial width has a long history. It’s the 
number of characters in an IBM punch card. (Remember those?)
 
✓ The word bash in the window label isn’t requesting an aggressive act. It’s 
the name of the Unix program attending you, something that the Unix 
world calls a shell. It’s much like the Windows XP command interpreter, 
cmd.exe.
 
✓ The $ character in the Terminal window is the bash prompt — Windows 
uses a right-facing arrow (>) for its prompt. Type anything at the 
prompt. Press Return and the shell program — bash by default in OS X — 
tries to carry out your wishes.
 
✓ The letters bash stand for Bourne-again shell. It’s an open source 
remake by the Gnu project of an earlier shell (sh) written by Stephen 
Bourne when he was at Bell Labs. sh and other popular Unix shells (csh, 
zsh, ksh, tcsh, for example) are available as well, in case you grew up 
with one of them and prefer it.
Bash is more powerful than the Windows cmd.exe, but Microsoft is offering 
a new Windows PowerShell that’s comparable. (My technical editor says 
“Yeah, comparable in the way that a Geo compares to a Maserati.”)
Bash ain’t Windows
You find a number of differences as well as similarities between the Windows 
command line and Unix. Many of these differences go back to the early days 
of DOS and were deliberately introduced to avoid legal problems from AT&T, 
the original developer of Unix:
 
✓ Pathnames: A pathname specifies where a file is located, starting at the 
top-level or root directory. Windows separates names with a backslash 
(\), and Unix, like the Internet, uses a forward slash (/). Versions of Mac 
OS 9 and earlier used a colon (:).
 
✓ Hidden files: Filenames that start with a period (.) are normally hidden 
and are often used to store the settings for various programs. Type ls –a 
to see them.
 
✓ Home directory: Unix uses the tilde character (~) as an abbreviation for 
the home directory. You sometimes see this on the Internet as well. One 
URL for my home page is http://theworld.com/~reinhold. (www.
arnoldreinhold.com redirects you there.)

323
 Chapter 19: Desktop to Dashcode: OS X Advanced
 
✓ Switches: Like Windows commands, Unix commands have switches that 
follow the command name to modify its action. In Windows, switches 
are indicated by a forward slash. In Unix, switches are usually indicated 
by a hyphen (-).
 
✓ More about commands: Windows uses help. Unix uses man, which 
stands for manual. In Unix, type this line:
man command-name
 
 OS X comes with thousands of man pages mostly copied from BSD UNIX. 
Unix aficionados love man pages because they don’t waste verbiage on 
cute analogies and historical asides, and they tend to be authoritative. 
Beginners often find them maddeningly terse. Use the apropos command 
to search through man pages.
Working in the Terminal window
As in Windows, you can use an asterisk (*) as a wildcard in a filename in 
most commands. Also like Windows, bash can complete a partially typed 
command or filename, if it can figure it out, when you press Tab.
You can copy text from the Terminal window, but you can’t cut or insert text. 
If you can paste text into the terminal window, it’s appended to whatever you 
already typed after the prompt.
 
If you drag an OS X file or folder icon to the Terminal window, the pathname of 
the file or folder is inserted where you’re typing.
Introducing Unix commands
Unix has many commands, but I discuss just a few important ones: some that 
work with directories, some that work with files, and a few miscellaneous but 
commonly used commands.
Folders are called directories in Unix. Commands that refer to filenames, as 
most do, assume that you’re talking about files in the working directory. 
When you open the Terminal window, the working directory is set to your 
home directory, abbreviated ~. You see the current working directory and 
your username to the left of its prompt. Table 19-1 lists common directory-
related commands.

As in Windows, you can redirect the output of a command to a text file. So, if 
you want a record of the files in a folder, follow these steps:
 
1. Type cd followed by a space.
 
2. Drag the folder’s icon to the Terminal window.
 
 Its pathname should appear after the cd command.
 
3. Press Return.
 
4. Type ls > mydirectorylist.txt and press Return.
 
 A file named mydirectorylist.txt appears in the folder you chose.
 
 You can open the file in TextEdit to see a list of the files in that directory.

325
 Chapter 19: Desktop to Dashcode: OS X Advanced
Table 19-2 lists commands commonly used when working with files in the 
Terminal window; Table 19-3 explains other handy commands that anyone 
getting started in Terminal will likely want to know.

Working with Files
Command
What You Do with It
cp filename1 filename2
Copy a file.
chmod
Change permissions for access to a file. 
Study the man page before using this one.
diff 
Compare two files line by line (assumes text).
more filename
Display a text file one page at a time. Press the 
spacebar to see the next page; press Q to quit. 
The man command works through more.
mv filename1 filename2
Move a file or change its name.
rm filename
Remove (delete) a file.
 
When you’re working in Terminal, you don’t have a trash can to which deleted 
files are moved pending their ultimate disposal. Delete it and it’s gone. In 
general, Unix has no Undo function.

history
Display the last commands you typed. You can redo a command by 
typing an exclamation point (!) followed immediately (no space) by 
the number of that command in the history list. To repeat the last 
command, type !!. To repeat the last filename, type !*.
pico
Use a simple Unix text editor.
ps 
Display a list of running processes.
sudo 
Carry out commands for which the account you’re using lacks 
authority. You’re asked for an administrator’s password.

326
Part V: Specialty Switching Scenarios 
Text files
 
Plain-text files seem like the simplest, least complicated form of computer 
data. But differences exist in the ways Windows, Unix, and Macs format these 
files. For the most part, if you use standard word processing applications, you 
needn’t worry about these differences, but if you’re mucking around with the 
innards of OS X or moving text files back and forth between different operating 
system, it helps to be aware of the issues.
Unix text files terminate lines with an ASCII LF (line feed) character (decimal 
value 10). Windows uses the pair of characters CR (carriage return) and 
LF (decimal values 13 and 10, respectively). Mac OS 9 and earlier used just 
CR (decimal value 13). Carriage return and line feed go back to the days of 
mechanical teletype machines, which had a printing element that went back 
and forth on a carriage across a roll of paper. Moving the paper up one line 
was a separate operation from returning the carriage to the left edge of the 
page.
OS X would rather forget about text files altogether. By default, TextEdit can 
read any of them, but doesn’t save in text format, preferring the RTF format. 
(You can tell TextEdit to use text format in its Preferences.) Many third-party 
Mac text editors use the OS 9 convention, ending lines in CR, though they 
often give you a choice. The Unix commands in OS X speak Unix, however, 
and expect LF unless you specify otherwise with a switch.
Developing Software on a Mac
Many years ago, my parents asked what I wanted for my 16th birthday. “A 
computer,” I replied. They asked what that was — few people had heard of 
them back then. Then they asked what one cost. “Five hundred thousand 
dollars,” I replied. It was a bad joke on my part (the first of many, you might 
be thinking). The smallest computer IBM made would occupy most of our 
apartment, and back then, half a million dollars was a lot of money. We all 
had a good laugh and I ended up with a shortwave radio receiver.
The reason I wanted a computer was to run programs I would write. That’s 
what one did with a computer for the first couple of decades. It was lots of 
fun. The iMac I’m writing this book on is a million times faster than the 
computer I lusted after as a 15-year-old. That’s not hyperbole — it’s probably 
closer to ten million times faster.

327
 Chapter 19: Desktop to Dashcode: OS X Advanced
But the iMac is harder to program. Sure, much better programming languages 
(too many of them) are available, and compilers do their thing in seconds for all 
except the biggest programs. But everything is so-o-o much more complicated.
Introducing Xcode
Apple hasn’t figured out how to make programming a Mac anywhere near as 
easy as using one. No one has. But Apple is trying its best, and a complete 
programming environment comes with your Mac. You only have to pop in the 
discs that come with it and install Xcode. That’s what Apple named its integrated 
development environment. Xcode supports a variety of compiled programming 
languages: Objective-C, C, C++, Java, and AppleScript. Objective-C is the 
native language for OS X, but the others can be used as well. Apple also 
supports scripting languages, including Perl, Python, and the hot Ruby on 
Rails. Xcode is built on top of many standard Gnu-Unix tools, including the 
GCC compiler and GDB debugger. All the standard Unix tools are there in 
their native form as well.
Xcode also has many Apple-specific tools, such as Interface Builder. The 
Xcode package includes most Apple developer documentation. You even find 
a Research Assistant to help you find application program interface (API) 
details and other arcane stuff you need in order to write programs these 
days.
Xcode supports both Intel and PowerPC Macintosh environments and 
produces universal binaries that run on both. It can produce programs that 
support either 32- or 64-bit addressing.
Dashing to the Dashboard with Dashcode
Apple provides a much simpler environment than Xcode for creating 
Dashboard widgets. It’s Dashcode, and it includes templates that let you 
quickly create an RSS feed, a podcast or photocast viewer, a countdown 
timer, or a gauge. A blank widget template is also available if you want to be 
more creative. You can find out more at developer.apple.com/tools/
dashcode.
When you’re ready to release your spiffy widget, Dashcode collects all the 
little bits of stuff that must be present and packages them for distribution as 
a professional-looking widget. Apple distributes selected widgets on its Web 
site: www.apple.com.

Programming the iPhone
Over 30,000 applications have been developed for the Apple iPhone and 
iPod touch. The Apple iTunes app store distributes these applications on a 
70–30 basis — the developer keeps 70 percent of the sale price, and Apple 
keeps 30 percent. Many people have made a nice side income from iPhone 
applications they develop. Maybe you have some programming skills and a 
novel idea for an app. First make sure that your app doesn’t already exist, by 
searching the app store and Google. Then you need to register as an Apple 
developer at http://developer.apple.com/iphone. (It’s free, but you 
agree to the Apple terms and conditions, which include a nondisclosure 
agreement.) Then download the iPhone Software Developer’s Kit (SDK) — it’s 
available only for OS X. You can test your application on an iPhone simulator 
included in the SDK, but to test it on a live phone and to release it to the 
store, you have to pay a fee that covers issuing you a digital signature that 
you use to sign your code. Apple doesn’t want anonymous software in the 
iPhone.
For help getting started with the actual programming, check out iPhone 
Application Development For Dummies by Neal Goldstein (Wiley Publishing).
The Sun ZFS file system
Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server supports 
ZFS, a new file system developed by Sun 
Microsystems. A file system is the internal 
plumbing of an operating system that organizes 
and stores computer data files on mass storage 
devices. OS X supports several file systems, 
including HFS+, Apple’s own file system; the 
Unix file system, UFS; and a couple of Microsoft 
variants.
Why add another file system to the OS X reper-
toire? Because ZFS is an amazing technological 
achievement. After decades of problems with 
file system design, Sun synthesized a new 
approach that offers nearly unlimited capacity 
and built-in reliability. The Apple HFS+ 
file system achieves its high reliability by 
keeping side notes on what it’s doing so that 
it can recover in case its operations are inter-
rupted by a power failure or software crash — 
a process called journaling. ZFS eliminates the 
need for journaling by protecting the old version 
of data until the creation of a new version is 
complete. So, you have no need for disk recov-
ery utilities and the like. ZFS has lots of other 
neat features, such as integrity checks on every 
file, the ability to add disk drives without creat-
ing separate volumes, and better techniques 
for using multiple disks to create a redundant 
array (RAID) that protects data even if a single 
disk drive dies. Some people think that ZFS may 
become the Apple standard file system.

Ten Terrific Troubleshooting Tips
In This Chapter
▶ Dealing with nasties
▶ Avoiding problems in the first place
▶ Finding places to look for help
M
acs have a deserved reputation for reliability. But they’re not perfect. 
Computer software is extremely complex, and stuff happens. In this 
chapter, I present some suggestions for dealing with problems that can arise 
and tips for preventing problems in the first place.
Take Care of First Things First
Take two aspirins and call me in the morning. Every field has its basic nostrums. 
Here are the basic remedies every Mac user should know:
 
✓ Back it up: It’s the first rule of computing. The Apple Time Machine 
automates the process if you attach a second hard drive and turn on 
Time Machine (see Chapter 5). In addition, I recommend a periodic 
manual backup of your most important files to DVD-R or to an additional 
external hard drive.
 
✓ Reboot: Select Restart from the Apple menu. See the section “Reboot 
a Hung Mac,” later in this chapter, for more details. You should reboot 
every week or so, whether or not you need to.
 
✓ Check the hard drive: Run Disk Utility in the Utilities folder. Select 
your hard drive. Click the Repair Permissions button. Then click the 
Verify Disk button. If Verify Disk reports a problem, you can boot from 
the installation disc that came with your computer by inserting it and 
holding down the C key when you reboot. Running Disk Utility from that 
system gives you the option to repair your disk. Do it.
 
 If you can’t find your installation disc, do a safe boot: Shut down your 
Mac. Press the power button. Right after the startup “boing,” hold down 
Shift. After the safe boot is complete, restart your Mac. Safe booting 
repairs your file system as it starts up.

332
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Fix the preference file: If an application is acting up, the file where it 
keeps your preference settings (the plist file) might be messed up. One 
way to deal with this problem is to change some preference settings 
and close the application. For Finder problems, also change the System 
Preferences Appearance settings.
 
 Another approach is to close the troublesome application, open the 
Library folder in your home directory, and then open the Preferences 
folder. Find the .plist file for the troublesome application and change 
its name by tacking .old or something similar to the end of the filename. 
Then restart the application with its default preferences.
 
✓ Zap PRAM: Every Mac stores some basic info it needs in a small, 
separate memory area known as parameter RAM, or PRAM. To reset it, 
hold down the P and R keys while you reboot.
 
✓ Replace the system battery: If you have a new Mac, you won’t run 
into system battery problems for years. Its small battery keeps the 
clock and PRAM working when power is off; it’s not the one that powers 
your laptop. But if you have an older Mac that’s behaving weirdly (a 
common symptom is the wrong date at startup), the small battery on 
the motherboard that keeps the clock and PRAM working might have 
run down. These batteries are easy to replace on the Mac Pro and older 
Mac desktop machines; it’s a service call on all-in-one units and laptops.
 
 Replacing the battery is also a common solution to problems with 
wireless devices. If you use a wireless keyboard and mouse and they 
don’t seem to be working, replace their batteries.
 
✓ Figure out whether it’s the hardware: If your Mac is crashing frequently, 
it might have a hardware problem. For starters, disconnect all peripherals 
and see whether you still have problems. If they go away, reconnect 
devices one at a time to try to isolate the evildoer. If the problems don’t 
go away, run the diagnostic disc that came with your Mac. It typically 
offers you a fast and more thorough mode. Try fast mode first. Then do 
the slow test overnight. If the diagnostic program reports an error, write 
down exactly what it says, with all the error numbers, and bring that 
info along with the sick computer to your service tech or have it ready 
when you call AppleCare.
Watch the Spinning Beach Ball
Macs rarely crash, but applications sometimes hang. That means the 
application is no longer responding to input from the keyboard or mouse. A 
common indication is a spinning beach ball cursor that doesn’t go away. The 
spinning beach ball is normal from time to time when an application is busy. 
It’s the equivalent of the hourglass cursor in Windows. You can tell that a 
specific application is responsible if the spinning beach ball shows up only 
when the cursor is over one of that application’s windows.

333
 Chapter 20: Ten Terrific Troubleshooting Tips
Show a little patience. The application might be waiting on an Internet 
resource or reorganizing its sock drawer. Go have a cup of coffee. Safari, in 
particular, sometimes takes awhile. If the beach ball is still spinning when 
you get back, I recommend handling the problem as follows:
 
1. Try pressing Ô+Tab to cycle to other applications you might have 
open, and save your work.
 
2. Close these applications using the Quit command. (Press Ô+Q.)
 
 If the Quit command doesn’t work, you can try a more drastic measure: 
Force Quit. Follow these steps:
 
a. Select Force Quit from the Apple menu or press Ô+Option+Esc.
 
 This step opens a small window showing all applications that are 
active. If one of yours is hung, OS X probably notices and marks it 
as not responding in the Force Quit window.
 
b. Select the hung application in the window and click the Force Quit 
button.
 
 If the Finder is hung, pressing Ô+Option+Esc may offer you the 
option to relaunch it. Otherwise, you must reboot.
Reboot a Hung Mac
Hold down the power button while you slowly count to ten. That’s not to 
calm you down. A little power management processor in your Mac looks for 
the extended push and shuts down the main computer.
If that doesn’t work, unplug the computer from its power source and, if it’s 
a laptop with a removable battery, remove it. To do the latter, follow these 
steps:
 
1. Close the screen and gently turn the machine over. (It has been bad 
but doesn’t need to be spanked.)
 
 You see a metal circle with a slot in it.
 
2. Insert a coin in the slot and turn it to the unlocked position.
 
3. Remove the battery.
 
4. Count to ten again and put the battery back in.
 
5. Press the power button briefly (count to one), and your computer 
should reboot.
 
 This restart may take a little longer than usual because your Mac knows 
it wasn’t shut down normally and is checking things out.

334
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If your Mac keeps hanging while it’s booting up and you’ve tried everything 
else, lift it about half an inch and drop it right after you reboot it. The 
resulting jar is often enough to get a stuck hard drive spinning again. If this 
works, take the hint: You’re hard drive is dying. Back up your files now and 
bring your Mac in for service.
Reconnect to the Internet
Your browser whines that you aren’t connected to the Internet. Mail 
complains that it can’t find the server. Debugging Internet connectivity 
problems can be frustrating. Many steps are involved in getting you online, 
and any of them can be the problem.
Safari offers you a Network Diagnostics button in the dialog that appears 
when Safari can’t connect. Click it. You see a list of the steps needed to 
connect, with colored lights that show green if that step has passed 
successfully and red if it hasn’t.
If the Network Diagnostics feature doesn’t help you resolve your problem, 
the following list offers other testing advice:
 
✓ Test for service: Before you spend too much time tracking down 
possible problems, try these simple tests. If you’re connected by a 
telephone line (dialup or DSL), ensure that you have a dial tone on your 
landline telephone. If you use a cable modem, ensure that you have TV 
reception. If not, the problem isn’t in your computer equipment. Call 
your phone company or cable company.
 
✓ Check the blinking lights: If you have a modem and router or a WiFi/
AirPort access point, check that their lights are on and appear normal.
 
✓ Can you hear me now? If you’re using WiFi/AirPort, determine whether 
you have a strong enough signal — at least two solid arcs on the Signal 
Strength icon on the menu bar. If not, click the icon to turn it off and 
back on. Move your laptop. Moving closer to the router or access point 
is usually better, but any move can help. See Chapter 9 for more tips on 
getting a signal and solving interference problems.
 
✓ Follow the wires: If you’re using a wired Ethernet connection, check 
that all cables are connected properly. Disconnect and reconnect them 
at each end. You have to press a little tab to remove the cable, just like 
on a telephone cable. You should hear a little click when it snaps into 
place as you reconnect. Follow the wire to make sure that the one 
entering your computer is the same one entering the router or modem 
and that it hasn’t been damaged.

335
 Chapter 20: Ten Terrific Troubleshooting Tips
 
✓ Cycle the power: Shut down your computer and turn off power to every 
device. Count to 30. Then, one at a time, power up each unit, starting 
with the modem, and then the router and access point, and then the 
computer.
 
✓ Check network settings: Select System Preferences from the Apple 
menu and click the Networks icon. Make sure that its settings match the 
instructions your ISP gave you. Also, check your router’s settings. See 
Chapters 8 and 9.
Handle Printing Problems
Most long-term Mac users have gotten calls from friends that go something 
like this: “I know you suggested I buy a Mac, but the salesman said the 
ZorchPC is just as good and he saved me $300 on a package. I got it set up all 
by myself, but the printer doesn’t work. Could you come over and help me?” 
The Apple Bonjour technology has made connecting a printer much simpler, 
even in the Windows world. But sometimes you click the Print button and 
nothing happens. The following steps can help you resolve your problem:
 
1. Click the Print & Fax icon in System Preferences.
 
2. Make sure your printer is listed in the window that appears.
 
 Your printer manufacturer and model number should be listed in the 
window. If not, make sure the printer has power and check the connection 
cables.
 
3. Look at the printer’s lights and display for any error messages, such as 
one saying that it’s out of paper or ink. Press its Resume or OK button.
 
4. Turn off the printer, wait until it shuts down completely, and then 
turn it back on.
 
5. Ensure that all cables are connected.
 
 Refer to the “Follow the wires” bullet in the preceding section.
 
6. Download the latest drivers from your printer manufacturer’s Web 
site.
 
 Avoid using drivers on the disc that came with the printer. They’re often 
out-of-date.
If you’ve done all these things and still don’t have a solution to your print-
ing problem, check the printer manual for other suggestions and the service 
number to call.

Reset Passwords
Okay, everybody forgets a password sooner or later. That’s why I advise 
most users to write down passwords and keep them in a safe place. See 
Chapter 10. Here’s how to handle forgotten passwords:
 
✓ If a user on your Mac forgot his password: Reset it to a new password 
by clicking the Accounts icon in System Preferences. You must click the 
Lock icon and then enter your administrator password. If the person 
forgot the user’s keychain password, use Keychain Access, located in 
the Utilities folder.
 
✓ If you forgot your administrator password: Reset it by inserting the 
installation disc that came with your computer and holding down the 
C key while you reboot. Select Reset Password from the menu that 
appears.
Eject CDs, DVDs, and Flash Drives
Most Macs come with slot-loading optical drives: You insert a CD or DVD into 
the wide, thin slot on your Mac where it just fits. Never insert a miniature-size 
CD or DVD into the slot. If you’re having trouble ejecting a CD or DVD, here 
are some tips:
 
✓ The Eject button is on the keyboard, in the upper-right corner, and is 
marked ).
 
✓ You can also right-click the disc’s icon in the Finder and select Eject 
from the menu that appears, or click the eject icon next to the disc’s 
name in a Finder window sidebar.
 
✓ OS X won’t eject a disc if a program thinks it’s using it. If your disc 
doesn’t eject when you press the button, close the application that was 
last using it (or close all applications, if you’re not sure which one is 
using it).
 
✓ If all else fails, restart the computer while holding down the mouse or 
trackpad button. That should eject the disc.
Flash drives and other removable hard drives have to be “ejected” as well. 
There’s no mechanical response; you still have to unplug them yourself. But 
ejecting tells OS X to finish what it was doing and leave the file system on the 
removable device in a proper state. Right-click the drive icon and select Eject 
from the shortcut menu. Wait for the icon to disappear from the desktop and 
then a few seconds more before unplugging.

337
 Chapter 20: Ten Terrific Troubleshooting Tips
If you removed a flash drive prematurely, the file system may be damaged. 
Even if the drive isn’t readable on your Mac (try a reboot first), it might be 
readable on another computer, including your old PC. If you’re able to read 
it, back it up by copying its contents to the hard drive of the machine that 
could read it. You can reformat a flash drive on your Mac by using Disk 
Utility. Select the FAT file system format. You lose all data on the drive.
Track Down Weird Noises
If your normally quiet new Mac starts making loud noises that sound a bit like 
a jetliner revving for take off, don’t be alarmed. The Intel processors in your 
Mac use more power when they’re thinking hard, as when rendering movies 
or 3D images. They can sense their own temperature and call for the fans in 
your Mac to blast some air to cool things down. Sometimes an application 
crashes in a way that keeps the processors and the fans at full tilt. A reboot 
usually quiets things. The Dashboard widget iStat Pro from www.islayer.
com reports on system temperatures and fan speeds. CoreDuoTemp from 
macbricol.free.fr puts temperature information on your menu bar.
Prevent Running Out of Disk Space
If you find that your Mac’s hard drive is filling up for no reason, you can try 
several fixes. For starters, empty the Trash. The command is on the Finder 
menu.
Next, check for extraordinarily large files to delete or back up to a removable 
drive or disc:
 
1. In the Finder, open a new Finder window (press Ô+N).
 
2. Open your home directory — it’s normally the House icon in the 
sidebar.
 
3. Choose Finder➪View➪As List.
 
4. Choose Finder➪View➪Show View Options, and select the Calculate 
All Sizes check box.
 
 When this check box is selected, OS X makes the added effort to show 
you how big each folder is, not just each file. The calculation takes a few 
minutes, typically.
 
5. Look to see whether any of your folders seems unreasonably large. If 
so, look for unnecessary stuff to delete or move elsewhere.
 
 Do the same procedure on subfolders as needed.

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Another possible cause of disappearing disk space is overgrown log files. 
UNIX can generate lots of logs as applications do their thing. Mac OS X runs 
special maintenance programs periodically to clean them out. They run in 
the wee hours of the morning, so be sure to leave your Mac on overnight 
sometimes. A reboot can often help. You can also use shareware programs 
that clean out the logs. Yasu and Onyx are two popular programs.
A final possibility is to defragment the hard drive. OS X tries to keep individual 
files from fragmenting, but the disk structure as a whole can suffer from 
having too many small, unused patches. Apple recommends against 
defragmentation for most users, as long as they aren’t doing disk-intensive 
work, such as video editing, and their hard drive isn’t close to being full.
Of course, your hard drive might be filling up because you have lots of files 
you want to keep. In that case, consider getting a large external hard drive 
and moving less frequently used files and folders to it. You generally should 
keep free at least 20 percent of the space on your main drive.
Keep Your Mac Safe and in Tiptop Shape
Taking care of a Mac is mostly common sense. For the most part, no special 
tricks are required. You just need to pay attention to the software, hardware, 
and your habits every so often.
To maintain the software, keep these points in mind:
 
✓ OS X checks Software Update once a week, unless you change its 
settings. I suggest leaving them as is.
 
✓ Dig out Disk Utility from the Utilities folder every few weeks and run 
Repair Permissions. If security is a concern, run Erase Free Space as 
well. Do this overnight because it can take awhile.
 
✓ Be judicious in the software you download and install. Although 
malware hasn’t been a big problem on Macs, there’s always a first time.
 
 The biggest risk in installing every software gizmo that catches your eye 
is that some are poorly written and can make OS X less stable.
 
✓ When your Internet connection is working properly, take a look at 
your router and modem — the box that connects your network to the 
telephone line, TV cable, or satellite dish. Note what the blinking lights 
look like when everything is okay so that you can recognize the difference 
when it isn’t.

339
 Chapter 20: Ten Terrific Troubleshooting Tips
Following these tips can help you keep the hardware in good working order:
 
✓ The MagSafe connector is designed to keep an Apple laptop from falling 
if someone trips on its power cord. But avoid balancing yours precariously 
on top of books, papers, and other work-surface litter. Remember that 
MagSafe protects only the power cord. Someone tripping on an Ethernet, 
USB, FireWire, or audio cable can still send your laptop flying. And avoid 
sharp bends in the power cord, particularly where it meets the MagSafe 
connector, to prevent eventual failure.
 
✓ Don’t use cleaners that contain alcohol or ammonia or other strong 
solvents on your computer. And, don’t spray any liquids directly on 
your computer. Apple suggests a soft cloth dipped in a little plain water 
for cleaning display screens. If that’s not sufficient, Klear Screen from 
klearscreen.com is recommended.
 
✓ Your Mac is designed to run in an ordinary home or office environment. 
Avoid running it in excessively hot locales or exposed to direct sunlight. 
If you put your laptop on a soft or cluttered surface, make sure that the 
fan exhaust, which is at the hinge, isn’t blocked.
 
✓ Keep an eagle eye on your laptop in public places. Be especially vigilant 
while walking through airport security.
Last but not least, the following tips can keep you computing comfortably 
day in and day out:
 
✓ If you spend much time at your computer, you owe it to yourself to take 
ergonomic precautions. Repetitive motion injuries are best avoided 
altogether. Comfortable seating that puts your keyboard and mouse or 
trackpad at a level where your forearms are at right angles to your body 
tops the list. Apple has extensive suggestions at apple.com/about/
ergonomics.
 
✓ Finally, you weren’t put on this planet to be a computer peripheral. 
Practice the push-away exercise several times a day. Place both hands 
at the edge of your desk and slowly push your body away from the 
keyboard. Then get up and walk outside for a while.
Find Help
I mention some common problems here and suggest how to fix them. But I 
can’t foresee everything that can happen. You have a number of places to 
turn when problems arise that these tips don’t fix.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Google
I always check the Internet first. Usually someone else has come up with an 
answer to the same problem, and Google (www.google.com) can find it if 
you come up with the right search request.
Be sure to include the term OS X or Mac in your search; otherwise, the 
answer gets lost in PC replies. Google seems to know that OS X is a single 
search term, even though a space is in it. But don’t be too specific at first. 
You may have a MacBook, but the person who solved your problem may 
have seen the same problem on an iMac. Try searching different ways, such 
as once with the word printer and once with your printer’s make and model.
Also try your search at Google Groups. Click the More link at the top of the 
Google home page.
The online Mac community
The fabled loyalty of Mac users is reflected in a strong online community of 
Mac Web sites. Some are dedicated to rumors of new products; others strive 
to keep up with the latest problems and their fixes:
 
✓ MacInTouch.com: One of the most comprehensive sites, with a strong 
focus on reviews and issues with new products and freshly released 
software
 
✓ VersionTracker.com: Lets you know if you have the latest software
 
✓ MacOSXHints.com: Filled with tips on solving problems and improving 
performance
 
✓ Macnn.com and MacRumors.com: Lets you read the latest Mac stories, 
along with user discussions
 
✓ LowEndMac.com: Has resources you can use with an older Mac
Apple
It may seem surprising that I don’t list Apple first when searching for help. 
But Google and the online communities can be checked in seconds and often 
pop up relevant links to the Apple Web site. So many problems are quickly 
resolved this way that it’s worth a try before calling AppleCare or visiting 
your local Apple store’s Genius Bar.

341
 Chapter 20: Ten Terrific Troubleshooting Tips
But Apple is the ultimate resource. New Macs typically come with 90-day free 
telephone support. You can extend this period by purchasing AppleCare, 
which is generally a good idea if this is your first Mac. See Chapter 3 for more 
on the Apple service options.
User groups and consultants
Numerous Apple user groups are scattered about the planet. Apple tries to 
find one near you if you visit www.apple.com/usergroups. Getting to know 
the folks at your local user group can be valuable when you’re stuck and in 
a hurry. Having a Mac-knowledgeable friend you can call can make all the 
difference. Your local user group can also recommend good Mac consultants 
in your area and give you some idea about what fees to expect. You meet 
some nice people too.

Ten Ways Your Mac Can 
Help the Planet
In This Chapter
▶ Saving energy
▶ Running on alternative power
▶ Putting your idle Mac to good use
You can use your Mac to get your work done, stay in touch, and just have 
fun, but you can also employ it in ways that help the environment and 
humanity. In this chapter, I describe just a few.
Saving Energy with Energy Saver
The Energy Saver control panel, shown in Figure 21-1, lets you adjust set-
tings that can reduce your Mac’s energy consumption. To see it, choose 
Ú➪System Preferences➪Energy Saver.

Part VI: The Part of Tens 
If you have an Apple laptop, you have a choice of settings: one for operating 
on battery power and one for when you’re connected to the power adapter. 
The default settings are based on the assumption that you want to use less 
power when you’re operating on battery power in order to extend battery 
life. But there’s no reason to waste energy when you’re on the power adapter. 
To select the energy-saving setting while you’re using your power adapter, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Settings For➪Power Adapter.
 
2. Choose Optimization➪Better Energy Savings.
 
 While you’re at it, make sure that Better Energy Savings is selected 
under the Battery option.
 
If you find the Better Energy Savings setting a bit annoying — for example, if 
the system is going to sleep too often — you can select Custom from the 
Optimization menu and pick a longer sleep time.
Organizing Your Accessories 
for Power Savings
Ever notice any of those tiny power adapters you have plugged in around 
your home or office? They power or charge the increasing number of electronic 
gadgets you have: computers, printers, modems, routers, cellphones, and 
video games, for example.
 
Whenever an adapter is connected to an electrical outlet, it consumes a little 
power even when the device it powers is turned off or disconnected. If all 
your adapters are plugged in all the time, that power adds up to significant 
energy use. Unplugging the adapters when they aren’t in use is one way to 
save energy, but it can be a bit tedious. An alternative is to plug into their own 
power strip all the chargers that can be turned off at night so that you can 
turn them all off together.
If you want to make this process a bit more automatic, consider getting a 
Colman Cable Smart Strip. This unit looks like an ordinary power strip, with 
color-coded outlets. One is a control outlet where you plug in a device (such 
as your computer) that you turn on and off. The strip senses when this happens 
and turns six other outlets on and off automatically, in sync with the control 
device. If you plug accessories (such as displays and USB hubs) into the 
smart strip and they’re off when your computer is off, you save standby 
power. The strip also has three outlets that are always on for devices that 
need to stay on, such as a router that others use.

 Chapter 21: Ten Ways Your Mac Can Help the Planet
Running on Alternative Power
Generating your own power — running off the electrical grid — by means of 
renewable power is the ultimate form of energy saving. Taking your entire 
home or business off grid is one way to do this, but it’s beyond the scope of 
this book (Check out Solar Power Your Home For Dummies, by Rik DeGunther, 
if this topic appeals to you).
If you want an off-grid Mac, a laptop is your best bet, because it consumes less 
power and it come with a battery so that you can work when the sun is behind 
a cloud or at night. All you need is a solar battery charger. A number of 
chargers of this type are on the market, but many don’t fit the MagSafe power 
connector on your Mac laptop. Two products that offer this vital link are
 
✓ The Solar Cell Apple Juicz: From quickertek.com
 
✓ The Voltaic Generator Solar Laptop Charger: From voltaicsystems.
com
Neither is cheap, but if you need to be online from someplace sunny with no 
commercial electric power or you just want to make a green statement, they 
may be for you.
A final option is to see whether your electric utility lets you choose your 
energy supplier and sign up for one that generates electricity from an 
alternative source, such as wind, hydro, or solar.
Monitoring Power Use
Your computing setup consists of more than just your Mac. You might have a 
printer, a display, an external hard drive, a scanner, a camcorder, a router, an 
HDTV, and other devices. If you’re keeping your PC, it and its peripherals will 
be plugged in as well. But how much energy does each one use?
Measuring the power and energy consumption of peripherals and other 
electronic gadgets that run off wall outlets is easy with the Kill A Watt EZ 
electricity usage monitor from P3 International (www.p3international.
com). This compact meter, which costs about $50, plugs into a standard 
outlet or a power strip. You plug the unit to be tested into the outlet on the 
front of the Kill A Watt. An LED display shows you the power and energy 
usage since the last time you reset the meter. The Kill A Watt can also display 
instantaneous power, voltage, current, and power-factor levels. (The power 
factor measures how close a load comes to an ideal resistor; low power 
factors mean energy is being wasted.) You can check other appliances in 

346
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
your home that plug into a 120-volt outlet, such as refrigerators and lamps. 
After you know how much energy your equipment uses, you can identify the 
best ways to reduce energy consumption, whether it’s turning off peripherals 
or installing compact fluorescent bulbs in your desk lamp.
iChat AV: The Green Way to Visit
Transportation fuel use — for automobiles and airplanes — is a major source 
of carbon dioxide, a gas that traps heat in the atmosphere and contributes to 
global warming. Cutting down on travel can reduce your carbon footprint — the 
amount of carbon dioxide you produce as a result of your activities. It can 
also save you money.
Short-notice airfares have long been the bane of small business. If you live in 
Boston and want to visit Aunt Ellie in L.A. and can plan your trip two weeks in 
advance, you can often easily find a nonstop round-trip flight online for less 
than $300. But if you need to go tomorrow to solve a customer’s problem or 
make that last-minute presentation to win a sale, you spend close to $1,000.
Using the Apple iChat AV to hold a videoconference, rather than catch that 
last-minute flight, can save you enough to cover the cost of your Mac with just 
one trip avoided. The iSight camera built into your iMac or laptop is all you need. 
Plug-in cameras are available for Mac minis and Pros. You can even video-
conference with Windows users by using AOL Instant Messenger for Windows.
You always see yourself as well as the other people on the call. If you have 
visual materials to make your case, iChat Theater lets you share an iPhoto 
slide show or a Keynote presentation while letting your audience see you as 
you talk them through it.
If you’re working on a proposal or report with a remote colleague who also 
has a Mac, you can both edit the same document or search the Web together 
with iChat screen sharing, which lets one chatter control the other’s desktop. If 
security is a concern, connecting through MobileMe allows you to automatically 
encrypt your chat. Look for the Lock icon in the upper-left corner.
For more on iChat AV, see Chapter 8.
Automating Your Home
Years ago, home automation meant buying X10 lamp modules from Radio 
Shack and putting a controller on the night table so that you could dim the 
lights from your bed. Home automation now means that you control every 
electrical device in your home, fine-tune your heating and air conditioning, 

347
 Chapter 21: Ten Ways Your Mac Can Help the Planet
and even patch in alternative forms of energy. You can also add video 
surveillance and intrusion detection systems, with security images shipped 
off-site where an intruder can’t get at them. And, you can control all these 
tasks remotely and securely over the Internet.
The Indigo software package from Perceptiveautomation.com lets your Mac 
control both X10 and the newer Insteon family of home automation controls.
 
If you’re using your Mac as a home controller, be sure to select Energy Saver 
in System Preferences, click Options, and check the Restart Automatically 
after a Power Failure box.
Living the Paperless Portable Life
Okay, this is a pet fantasy of mine, but did you ever think about how much 
of our living situation is devoted to storing and managing papers? Imagine 
scanning every piece of paper that matters to you and storing it all on an 
external hard drive (such as Time Capsule, covered in Chapter 5). Legal 
documents you need in original form can be stored in a rented safe-deposit 
box, along with jewelry and small mementos. If you have books and bigger 
tchotchkes you can’t part with, rent a small storage room or a corner of a 
friend’s basement. Imagine getting everything you need down to a laptop and 
portable hard drive. You’re free! You can go anywhere, at any time.
Even if you aren’t ready to go this far, you can still cut your use of paper. 
You’re probably already using texting and e-mail to stay in touch with 
friends. Here are a few other suggestions:
 
✓ Use online bill-paying systems. Your bank or broker probably offers 
such a service.
 
✓ Ask to get bills and statements via e-mail rather than on paper. Many 
banks, utilities and other vendors offer this service.
 
✓ If you’re in school, ask your instructors whether they accept essays 
and other submissions in electronic form. It never hurts to ask.
 
✓ Turn off your printer and see how long you can get by without it. You 
save on ink and toner cartridges as well. (Don’t forget to recycle your 
old ones — many stationary stores take them back for credit.)
Curing Cancer
Your Mac is one powerful computer. How powerful? One Mac sent back in 
time to the 1940s or ’50s could alter the balance of power in the world. Yet 

348
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
yours spends most of its time patiently waiting for commands. Can I find you 
a Web page? Can I? Can I maybe read you your e-mail? Pretty please?
Rather than consign your Mac to total boredom, you can give it interesting 
work to do — work that helps cure cancer and other diseases. Living cells 
assemble proteins by linking different amino acids in a sequence specified by 
the cell’s DNA. As the protein is completed, it folds itself up into a 3D shape 
that determines how it functions in the cell. These days, biologists can 
determine a protein’s sequence from the DNA, but figuring out how it 
folds up takes extremely demanding calculations. The Stanford University 
Folding@home project uses the idle cycles on your Mac to help carry out 
these computations. Visit folding.stanford.edu and download the OS X 
client. You have lots of options to choose from, but start with the Screensaver 
version, which makes only moderate demands on your computer and quickly 
gets out of the way when you want to get your work done. After the Folding@
home screen saver has run long enough to produce some results, it displays 
the molecules it’s working on so that you can see what’s being accomplished.
Retiring Old Electronics Responsibly
Computers wear out. Mac last longer than PCs on average, but even they die 
or become obsolete eventually. Disposing of them improperly can add to 
landfill pollution. Worse, in many cases, old computers are shipped to Third 
World countries, where they’re stripped of valuable parts in unsafe conditions, 
often by children. The section in Chapter 22 on recycling equipment safely 
explains better ways to get rid of old equipment.
Switching a Friend to a Mac
The Mac model’s environmentally friendly design and long service life make 
them ideal for environmentally conscious users. Apple competes against 
computer companies battling to see who can produce the cheapest Windows 
computer. These perpetual price wars lead to corner cutting and products 
that need frequent replacement.
The one thing that has kept Apple alive through difficult years is the loyalty 
of its customers. If you like having a commercial alternative to Microsoft and 
Windows, consider helping a friend make the switch. If you found this book 
helpful, the friend might too.

Chapter 22
Ten Creative Uses for Your Old PC
In This Chapter
▶ Selling your PC to someone else
▶ Letting your kids discover something new from the PC
▶ Keeping the PC as a storage center
▶ Finding an artistic destiny for your PC
▶ Recycling the PC safely and responsibly
A
s you wean yourself from Windows, you may wonder what to do with 
your old PC. Here are ten suggestions, some more creative than others.
 
Before you send away your computer, be sure to clear its hard drive of all 
sensitive files. Dragging items to the Recycle Bin and then emptying it doesn’t 
erase your data. See Chapter 6 for instructions for better ways to delete data.
Sell It on Craigslist
If your PC is of fairly recent vintage, it may have some resale value. I suggest 
listing it on your local craigslist (www.craigslist.org). It’s free to use and 
less complicated than eBay.com. Because Craigslist enables you to create a 
local listing, you can ask the buyer to pick up the PC, avoiding shipping 
hassles. You can get an idea of what your computer is worth by checking 
what’s now on sale — but don’t assume that the listed asking price is what 
people are getting.
Load Ubuntu Linux on It
I love OS X, but Linux — the free, open source operating system — is also 
becoming an important alternative to Windows. You can download and 
burn a CD to load your PC with the friendly version of Linux, Ubuntu (www.
ubuntu.com).

350
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
By the way, this is the only way I recommend giving your old PC box to your 
kids. I’d rather see them have a Mac, but setting up and using Linux has real 
educational value — and fewer games are available. Get the kids a copy of 
Ubuntu Linux For Dummies, by Paul G. Sery (Wiley Publishing), and let them 
figure it out.
Give It to Charity
Donating your computer to a worthwhile organization is an admirable thing 
to do, and you may even get a tax deduction. However, most charitable 
organizations aren’t interested in computer donations from individuals — 
they’re inundated with them. Your best bet is to contact organizations you 
know. An offer to help set up the PC may be appreciated. Don’t take offense if 
they say no.
A posting in the free section of craigslist.org often works — you can specify a 
preference for charities, but often a donation to an individual can be a good 
deed. In any case, be sure to include all software discs and documentation 
that came with the PC, if you still have them.
Use It as a Pedestal
Years ago, my employer sold all its computers to a leasing company and 
leased them back on a seven-year note. The equipment was obsolete after 
three years, so we kept the racks they were mounted in, which is where the 
leasing company’s inventory tags were affixed, and used them for printer 
stands. The bean counters from the leasing company dutifully came around 
every six months and were satisfied to see that the stuff that secured their 
loans (and our printers) was still there. A PC makes a great plant stand, but 
be sure to install the antitipping hardware that probably came with it. Two 
PCs of the same height with a wide board across them creates a nice work 
surface for young kids.
Have Your Kids Take It Apart
These days, kids don’t get much opportunity to see how things are put 
together. Place the computer on an old bed sheet, give the kids a screwdriver 
set, and see how far they can go in taking apart the computer. Hard drives 
are a bit tricky to open — you usually find one or two screws under the 
“you’ll void the warranty” labels — but they’re full of fascinating parts, 
including some powerful magnets.

351
 Chapter 22: Ten Creative Uses for Your Old PC
 
Adult supervision is required. Some parts have sharp edges. Those magnets 
are strong enough to pinch if two snap together. This activity isn’t one that 
kids younger than five should be anywhere near, because small parts are a 
choking hazard. And never try to take apart a video monitor or any computer 
that includes a CRT display — it has high voltages inside, and its CRT tubes 
can implode violently. See “Recycle It Safely,” at the end of this chapter, for 
disposal tips.
Enjoy It As Art
If you’ve never looked closely at a computer’s circuit board, you’re missing 
a cultural experience. Those objets d’art are marvels of design, filled with 
colorful electronic components, including numerous integrated circuits in 
mysterious black slabs and covered with thousands of tiny copper traces 
that carry all the signals. I think they’re worthy of hanging on the wall. Some 
craftspeople even use them as raw material for jewelry.
Use It for Target Practice
I’m not seriously suggesting this one. It can be dangerous and may be 
contrary to laws in some locations, but years ago, when I had a gig at a local 
company that made spreadsheet software, someone brought in a 386 PC 
filled with .30 caliber bullet holes. Everyone appreciated the gesture.
Disconnect from the Internet
One way to continue to use a Windows machine safely is to disconnect it 
from the Internet. Unplug its Ethernet cable and remove any wireless networking 
card. If the machine has built-in wireless capability, such as Intel Centrino, 
change the password on your wireless network hub and don’t give the PC the 
new password. For extra credit, turn off wireless networking in the Network 
Connections section of the Control Panel or remove the wireless card, 
because the PC can still connect through a neighbor’s open hub. When you 
need to move files between the PC and your Mac, use a USB flash drive.
Keep It for Old Media
If you have a PC old enough to have 5
1⁄4-inch floppy drives , wrap it in one 
of those big plastic bags you get from the dry cleaner and store it in the 

352
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
basement. Sooner or later, the world will no longer be able to read those old 
disks, and you’ll be a hero for saving your machine. Or not. (And if some of 
the dire predictions for cyberwar come true, old machines may be the only 
computers that still work.)
Recycle It Safely
Keep computers and displays out of the town dump. Did you know that an 
old CRT monitor can contain four pounds of lead? Also, many computer 
recycling operations send computers and displays to developing countries, 
where they’re dismantled under hazardous conditions — often by child 
labor — and worthless parts are simply dumped somewhere. Here are a 
few tips to help you find a good way to safely recycle an old and unwanted 
computer:
 
✓ In the United States, the Apple take-back program accepts your old 
computer and monitor — regardless of manufacturer — when you buy a 
new Mac. It also takes back old cellphones and iPods, even if you don’t 
buy anything.
 
✓ Several other brand-name PC manufacturers, including HP and Dell, 
have recycling programs that use safe and responsible methods. Check 
the home page of the folks who made your PC.
 
✓ Also check with your municipal trash collection department to see what 
programs it offers for old PCs and monitors.
 
✓ Finally, you can find out about organizations that take PCs and recycle 
them responsibly at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Web 
site, www.epa.gov/plugin.
