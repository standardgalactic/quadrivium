Introduction
1.1  General Background
The first step in presenting a scientific or technical subject is providing clear and 
distinct definitions and “reflectarrays” are not an exception to this general rule. 
“Reflectarray antenna” refers to the class of radiating structures that are comprised 
of an array of radiating elements, reradiating the energy that is impinged on them 
from one or more radiating feeds that are located in free space. The whole diver­
sity and variety in the world of reflectarray stems from the variety of constituent 
elements used, the way they are set into a lattice, and the method of feeding the 
structure. 
Reflectarray technology is a hybrid of conventional reflector and phased ar­
ray technologies [1, 2]. Constituent elements of the reflectarray that are set into a 
regular lattice mimic the function of phased array radiating elements and the free 
space acts as the transmission medium between the elements and the signal source 
(feed). The fact that the reflectarray, in its most general form, collimates the plane 
wave that impinges on its surface into the feed constitutes the affinity between the 
conventional parabolic reflector and reflectarray. Generally, adjustment of the geo­
metrical features of constituent elements of reflectarray is utilized to realize desired 
aperture field distribution [3, 4]. Contrary to conventional microstrip phased ar­
rays that employ printed transmission lines and henceforth suffer from excessive 
loss at higher frequencies [5], reflectarrays use the free space medium to transmit 
the electrical signal from the feed to the elements and thus avoid degradation in the 
gain performance as a result of loss in the feeding system.
Open waveguide structures are among the radiators that have a long record of 
implementation both as an isolated or array of radiator(s). Therefore, open wave­
guide turned out to be a natural choice for initial introduction and realization of 
a reflectarray that was comprised of 426 lattice of open-waveguides fed by a horn 
antenna [6]. Complexity of the fabrication process of waveguide structures, espe­
cially when their operating frequency band is high, hindered further development 
of waveguide-based reflectarray. Subsequent developments and advances in litho­
graphic technology was an impetus to reflectarray research and raised its profile 
as a viable and appealing high gain antenna with versatile and flexible features as 
will be described throughout this book. Amenability of reflectarray technology to

Introduction
etching and lithographic techniques is an important advantage for reflectarrays as 
it permits adoption of new developments in fabrication technology to further en­
hance the functionality and performance of reflectarrays. For instance, microelec­
tromechanical system (MEMS) technology was utilized to realize reconfigurable 
reflectarray [7], amplifiers were embedded in a cell to enhance power handling of 
reflectarray at higher frequencies [8], or laser induced plasma was exploited in re­
alization of beam switched reflectarray [9]. A more exhaustive presentation of vari­
ous reflectarray structures with added functionalities that demonstrate exploitation 
of emerging fabrication techniques will be given in the coming chapters.   
1.2  Why Reflectarrays?
Geometrical rules are the basis of the first-order synthesis and analysis algorithms 
in the case of conventional parabolic reflectors. Physical optics and Geometrical 
Theory of Diffraction (GTD) are used to increase accuracy in the design and analy­
sis [10]. It is important to note that the laws of geometry are neutral to the operat­
ing frequency and polarization of the incoming wave. In other words, the surface 
of a conventional solid parabolic reflector does not distinguish different frequency 
bands or polarizations of the incoming signal and treats them the same to the first 
order of approximation. Therefore, a conventional parabolic reflector is capable 
of operating at a given frequency band and polarization as long as the feed accom­
modates that same frequency band and polarization. However, constituent printed 
elements of a reflectarray that are located on its surface impart a given phase onto 
the incoming wave that depends on frequency, polarization, and angle of incidence 
of the incoming wave. Therefore, a judicious design of the constituent elements of 
reflectarray leads to a unique aperture field distribution for each of its operating 
bands and polarizations. This fundamental difference between the underlying op­
erating principles of conventional reflector and reflectarray brings about a whole 
range of flexibility and versatility in operation of reflectarray that is not readily 
available in the case of conventional reflectors as will be pointed in the coming 
sections. 
A reflectarray is shown in Figure 1.1 that is comprised of printed dipoles. Lith­
ographic technology is a low-cost and mature technology that can be used for 
fabrication of printed reflectarrays. As noted above, the reflected phase response 
of the elements depends on their geometrical features. A different class of elements 
with a given phase response to polarization and/or frequency that is different from 
the polarization and/or operating frequency of the first set of elements, can be 
embedded within the lattice of the first set of elements to achieve collimation for 
this second set of elements [1]. It is obvious that the coupling between the two sets 
must be accounted for in the design process [11]. Having embedded two sets of ele­
ments within the reflectarray lattice, two different focal points can be achieved and 
only one focal point is dedicated to each combination of frequency band and state 
of polarization. Figure 1.2 shows the case of a reflectarray with two focal points, 
each dedicated to a given linear polarization. Two sets of dipoles are shown on the 
reflectarray with different orientations. Each set collimates the incoming field with 
horizontal or vertical into a separate dedicated feed. The possibility of achieving 
a dedicated focal point for each given frequency and/or polarization is not readily

available in the case of conventional solid reflectors, whereas reflectarray structure 
is inherently amenable to multifoci operation for multibands [12]. This can result 
in major simplification of the feed system as will be pointed out in Chapter 4. 
One of the challenges in high gain antenna technology is design of antennas 
that are portable and easily deployable in extreme and adverse environmental 
conditions. Reflectarrays are superior in terms of portability as a result of its flat 
shape. Transportation and deployment of large conventional reflectors can pose 
challenges in using such antennas in extreme field conditions. However, multipanel 
rendition of flat reflectors offers an effective response to portability and deploy­
ability factors. 
Radar cross section (RCS) and volume specifications of antennas can be an im­
portant factor in a particular application. The flat nature of reflectarrays is better 
suited to the fulfillment of volume requirements. Reduced volume of the antenna is 
generally tantamount to lower RCS. However, more involved reflectarray designs 
can be implemented to disperse selected frequency bands in order to further reduce 
RCS at given bands.

Introduction
Severing the ties with Euclidean geometry in the operation of reflectarray al­
lows for straightforward design and fabrication of conformal reflectarray antennas 
[13]. This does not necessarily require a complicated feed design as opposed to con­
ventional reflectors. The same feed structure can be used and the feed complexity 
can be relegated to the adjustment of the cell elements that can be addressed easily 
by appropriate lithographic technology. In closing, in the light of the aforemen­
tioned arguments, the opening question of this section (why reflectarrays?) should 
be transformed into an exploratory one: Why not reflectarrays? 
1.3  The Structure of the Book
The present text is meant to serve as a complete exposition of design, analysis, 
fabrication, test, and operation of reflectarray antennas. An emphasis has been 
laid on the presentation of underlying physical principles of such radiating struc­
tures. Chapter 2 is devoted to description of general design guidelines in which a 
direct comparison with conventional reflector antenna is provided, focusing on 
conventional efficiency figures of reflectors [14]. Important design parameters in 
the synthesis of reflectarrays composed of patch or printed dipole elements will be

focal points, each dedicated to a given linear polarization.

described and the effect of such parameters as substrate thickness and permittivity 
on the performance of reflectarrays will be presented [15].
As noted above, the choice of cell element has an important impact on the type 
of application and level of performance that is realizable in a reflectarray. Chapter 
3 focuses on different types of cell elements, their special features, and consider­
ations that might make one type of cell element superior to another for a given 
set of specifications that addresses a particular application. Conventional resonant 
cell elements such as single patch [15], stacked patch [16], slotted patch [17], and 
different variations of loop elements [18] will be studied in this chapter. Also, the 
novel and emerging subwavelength coupled resonant (SCR) [19] elements and frag­
mented elements will be presented in this same chapter. 
Chapter 4 deals with different types of reflectarrays. Depending of the types 
of elements used as the expanded constituent elements, the range of functionalities 
of reflectarrays can be expended [1]. Different types of elements can be combined 
and/or novel aperture field distributions can be realized. Examples are multifeed, 
multiband/multipolarization reflectarrays, beam shaping, and power combining.
The basis of most synthesis methods in the design of reflectarrays is calculation 
of scattering from an infinite periodic structure that is illuminated by a plane wave. 
Knowledge of the phase of scattered field (direct reflection component) versus the 
size of geometrical features of the cell elements is utilized to realize the desired phase 
transformation [15]. Smooth variation of the cell elements across the reflectarray 
surface justifies application of infinite periodicity assumption. Method of moment 
(MoM) is among the most versatile and conceptually rich numerical methods that 
have been used in the calculation of scattering from infinite periodic structures il­
luminated by plane wave [20, 21]. MoM is briefly described in Chapter 5 in the 
context of its application to the design of reflectarrays. Physical insights obtained 
from the application of the method are presented. Characteristic mode (CM) [22] 
is another promising numerical method that has recently been applied in the design 
of reflectarrays comprised of fragmented elements. These methods are suited to the 
analysis of cell elements that are rather complicated. New developments in com­
mercial software [23] as far as related to the analysis and design of reflectarrays 
have been presented in this same chapter. It is demonstrated that intelligent applica­
tion of the commercial software can lead to important insight and understanding 
of reflectarray performance, such as bandwidth, the origin of undesired radiation 
components such as cross-polarization, and feed image. 
Limited operational bandwidth has been a major shortcoming of reflectarrays 
as compared to conventional solid reflectors. In the case of a solid reflector, the 
bandwidth is limited by the bandwidth of the feed structure, whereas the nature of 
elements and the size of the structure (its geometric size and focal/distance (F/D)) 
limit the operating bandwidth of the reflectarray. Chapter 6 is devoted to the pre­
sentation of extensive research on broadening bandwidth of reflectarray structures 
[16, 23].
Extension of the range of application of reflectarrays calls for utilization of 
low-cost substrates. However, low-cost substrates are generally lossy and special 
techniques that are subject of Chapter 7 should be developed to prevent degra­
dation of the performance as a result of lossy substrate. Subwavelength coupled 
resonant (SCR) cell elements will be shown to be quite promising in mitigation of 
loss [24, 25].

Introduction
Various other antenna structures have emerged as a result of research on re­
flectarray and among these are transmitarrays and subreflectarrays, which will be 
presented in Chapter 8. A transmitarray [26] emulates conventional lens through 
implementation of consecutive periodic structures to manipulate the phase front 
of the outgoing beam that emanates from a feed structure. The design procedure 
is more involved as compared to reflectarray because both phase and amplitude of 
transmission should be optimized to achieve desired performance. Subreflectarray 
[27, 28] mimics the function of a solid subreflector. Analytic formulas are obtained 
for the design and simulation and experimental results will be shown to verify the 
validity of the design equations. Subreflectarrays have also been used for the phase 
correction on the main reflector, which suffers from fabrication error or mechani­
cal loading [28].
As was pointed out above, reflectarrays are inherently well suited to integra­
tion of electronics that can be used for reconfigurability. The subject of Chapter 
9 is presentation of extensive research that has been carried out in this field [7, 
29–31]. Also, several novel mechanical techniques will be presented for switched 
beam and beam-steering applications [32]. These mechanical techniques do not 
necessarily lead to degradation of radiation pattern of the steered or switched beam 
that is in contrast to deterioration of performance in the case of solid reflectors 
when the beam is steered through mechanical means such as movement of the feed. 
Reflectarrays can benefit highly from new developments in the material science in 
the context of materials with electrical properties (refractive index, conductivity, 
permeability, and so on) sensitive to light, voltage, and temperature. A detailed 
presentation of the implementation of photo-induced reflectarray on high resistiv­
ity silicon is given to elucidate the importance of emerging materials in the context 
of reflectarray research [9, 33].
The fundamental building block of a reflectarray is its cell element and particu­
lar care should be exercised in the fabrication process to maintain fine features of 
the cell elements. The smaller the cell element, the smaller the feature size and thus 
the tighter the fabrication tolerance required. The effect of etching tolerance on the 
performance of reflectarrays will be presented in Chapter 10. Also, the application 
of novel techniques such as inkjet printing in the fabrication of reflectarrays will 
be presented. The technique is promising for the fabrication of reflectarrays that 
employ SCR elements and operate at higher bands (Ka-band and above). A detailed 
study will be presented on the elements that are more prone to fabrication toler­
ance, which has an impact on the selection of appropriate cell element for a given 
application.
Chapter 11 includes concluding remarks on the future directions of reflectarray 
research and also potential applications of the technology in face of the emergence 
of new fabrication techniques to accommodate both passive and active elements.

Fundamentals of Reflectarray and General 
Design Guidelines
General design equations of a reflectarray antenna that imitates the operation of 
a conventional parabolic antenna will be given in Section 2.1. The flexibility of 
reflectarray antennas has rendered them as suitable candidates in a wide range of 
applications as will be described in subsequent chapters. Therefore, performance 
criteria and benchmarks are needed to assess the efficiency of the reflectarray and 
fulfillment of design specifications. Resemblance between reflectarrays and conven­
tional reflectors justifies tailoring the efficiency figures that are used in evaluation of 
the latter to gauge the performance of the former. In the meantime, particular atten­
tion should be devoted to the modification of the conventional aperture efficiency 
figures of conventional reflectors to capture unique features of reflectarrays, which 
is the topic of Section 2.2. 
Microstrip patches were widely used as the cell element at the initial stages 
of printed reflectarray research and development. The patch cell element is high­
lighted in Section 2.3 to present some general trends in the performance of the 
cell elements of reflectarrays such as the effect of thickness and permittivity of the 
substrate material. Similar trends exist for the more complicated cell elements. This 
should lay the foundation for the discussion of more complicated cell elements that 
will follow in Chapter 3.
2.1  General Design Equations
Reflectarray antennas are comprised of a quasi-periodic set of cell elements often 
set in a regular lattice to emulate a given phase front transformation. In its most 
basic form, the antenna carries out spherical to planar phase front transformation 
which is akin to the function of its conventional counterpart, namely, the center-fed 
parabolic reflector. The side view of a reflectarray antenna is shown in Figure 2.1 
which is comprised of printed elements on a substrate of thickness h and relative 
permittivity εr. The structure is illuminated by a horn antenna located at the focal 
point F. Patch dimensions are adjusted to realize an equiphase aperture field distri­
bution that is tantamount to broadside radiation from the reflectarray. To achieve 
this objective, the patch element located at A (see Figure 2.1) of the reflectarray

where n is an integer, k0 is the free space wavenumber, and φA is the scattered phase 
generated by the patch located at point A. Fulfillment of (2.1) forces a phase differ­
ence of 2np between any given patch on the reflectarray and the patch located at 
O, which is the center of reflectarray. The phase generated by the patch is limited 
between 0° and 360°. Therefore, the integer n is used to keep φA within this bound. 
The regions of the reflectarray, where φA jumps between 0° and 360°, are called 
transition regions.
The same procedure can be followed to obtain the required phase contribution 
of each given patch to realize a scanned beam reflectarray shown in Figure 2.2. 
The direction of the outgoing beam is represented as rout. The following relation­
ship gives the amount of phase to be imparted by the patch located at point A of 
reflectarray to maintain the scanned beam:

Scanned-beam, center-fed reflectarray is a construct that does not have an 
equivalent in the case of conventional center-fed “parabolic reflector.” Offset re­
flectors have been devised in the past to achieve scanned-beam operation at the 
expense of less mechanical robustness compared to centre-fed reflectors and higher 
cross-polarization. This is an illustration of the one of the many flexibilities offered 
by reflectarrays. 
A reflectarray can be used to emulate phase transformations carried out by 
a shaped reflector. Figure 2.3 shows a known shaped reflector and its equivalent 
reflectarray. The function of the reflectarray is to realize the same aperture phase 
distribution as the shaped reflector. To this end, it is attempted to find the required 
phase shift on the patch located at point B by examination of the ray that emanates 
from the feed phase center F and lands on B after reflection from point A on the 
shaped reflector. Note that point B is at the center of a given cell location on the 
reflectarray. The required phase to be imparted by the patch to realize the same 
phase distribution as the shaped reflector on aperture of reflectarray is given as:

One common factor between these three equations is the presence of free-space 
wavenumber, k0, that corresponds to the design frequency of the reflectarray and 
constrains the desired phase shift to be valid for optimum performance at a given 
design frequency. Therefore, deviation from the design frequency leads to a dif­
ferent value for the required phase that might not be fulfilled once the element 
dimensions have been chosen for optimum performance at the design frequency. 
This leads to loss of gain because of the emergence of phase error on the radiating

aperture of the reflectarray. Techniques will be presented in Chapter 6 to broaden 
the reflectarray gain bandwidth.
So far, we have restricted ourselves to derivation of the phase value required at 
each patch and have not discussed methods to realize this phase. Figure 2.4 shows 
an infinite two-dimensional periodic structure composed of microstrip patches that 
is illuminated by a normally incident plane wave. A typical plot of the phase of the 
reflected wave versus the length of the patch is also shown in Figure 2.4. Lattice 
dimensions along the x-axis and y-axis (Tx and Ty) are selected to be less than free-
space half wavelength (λ0/2) to prevent the emergence of grating lobes. As will be 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 5, the propagating reflected wave is composed 
of direct reflection from the grounded dielectric substrate and patches. The pres­
ence of the ground plane does not allow scattering into the lower half-plane, which 
implies unity amplitude of the reflected wave in upper half plane for lossless dielec­
tric substrate and perfect electric conductor (PEC) patches. However, the phase of 
the reflected wave can be adjusted by changing the length of the patch. Noting the 
gradual variation of the desired phase on the surface of the reflectarray, the infi­
nite periodic structure approximation can be used to synthesize the length of the 
patch based on the desired phase at a given location. In other words, each locality 
of the reflectarray is assumed to be an infinite two-dimensional periodic structure

that is illuminated by a plane wave whose direction of propagation is along the 
ray that connects the feed and that given locality. Then the phase of the reflected 
wave is calculated for this infinite periodic structure using numerical methods that 
will be presented in Chapter 5. Therefore, the required patch phase as outlined in 
(2.1) to (2.4) can be obtained by changing patch dimensions according the phase-
length plot of Figure 2.4(c). The same two-dimensional infinite periodic structure 
assumption can be used for other types of cell elements. Figure 2.5 shows a number 
of conventional cell elements that have been used in reflectarray structure and the 
geometrical feature that is to be adjusted in order to realize the required phase shift.
2.2  Aperture Efficiency of Reflectarray and Comparison with 
Conventional Parabolic Reflector
Aperture efficiency of a conventional reflector has been decomposed into a number 
of efficiency figures to isolate the factors that cause deviation from ideal perfor­
mance [1]. The most common factors that degrade the performance are listed as: 
feed illumination taper, feed illumination spillover, aperture phase error, cross-po­
larization effects, feed blockage, dielectric and conductor loss, and feed mismatch. 
The definitions used in [1] are applied in this section to present a mathematical 
expression for each of these degrading factors and provide a qualitative comparison 
of the performance of reflectarrays with conventional parabolic reflector in terms 
of each of these factors.
2.2.1  Illumination Efficiency
Illumination efficiency is a measure of the uniformity of the feed illumination of 
the reflectarray. It is well known that as the illumination tapers toward the rim 
of the reflectarray or reflector, the sidelobe level tends to decrease and the main 
beam broadens. The mathematical expression for illumination efficiency is given 
as follows:

Fundamentals of Reflectarray and General Design Guidelines
where it is assumed that the desired aperture field is y-polarized and the aperture is 
of circular shape with radius a. In the case of conventional reflector, the feed illumi­
nation taper is solely determined by the feed pattern but in the case of reflectarray, 
the illumination also depends on the radiation pattern of the constituent elements 
of the reflectarray. The broadside radiation pattern of the cell element necessarily 
leads to reduction of intercepted power by the element when it is illuminated by 
rays from the feed that are away from the broadside direction of that given element. 
Therefore, the illumination taper of the feed is further accentuated by the element 
pattern. The element pattern makes an impact for F/D < 0.5 when the illumination 
angle of feed for the edge elements of the reflectarray is increased. This relatively 
larger taper entails marginally lower illumination efficiency in the case of reflectar­
ray and also lower sidelobe levels. 
2.2.2  Spillover Efficiency
This efficiency figure represents the amount of power that is not intercepted by the 
reflectarray and it is calculated using the following expression:

where ψ is the subtended angle of reflectarray or reflector aperture defined in Fig­
ure 2.6 and g(θ, φ) is the feed radiation pattern. It can be seen that for the same D 
and F/D ratio, the subtended angle of the parabolic reflector is slightly larger than 
that of the reflectarray. The difference between the subtended angles of parabolic 
reflector and its equivalent reflectarray increases as F/D shrinks and puts parabolic 
reflector at an advantage in terms of spillover efficiency as compared to its reflectar­
ray equivalent.

structures have the same diameter and F/D ratio.

The illumination efficiency is the product of spillover and taper efficiencies. 
The reflectarray illumination efficiency is plotted in Figure 2.7 for different values 
of n for the feed pattern of cosn(θ). As it is the case for conventional reflector, it can 
be seen for a given feed pattern, there is an optimum subtended angle for which the 
illumination efficiency is maximized. This optimum subtended angle can be trans­
lated into an optimum F/D ratio.
2.2.3  Polarization Efficiency
This efficiency term represents the polarization purity of the antenna radiation and 
is calculated according to the following relation:

The above expression is a measure of the power that is coupled into the cross-
polarization component of the antenna radiation. Normally, a feed with poor 
cross-polarization performance leads to low ηx in the case of center-fed parabolic 
reflector because its surface is indifferent the sense of linear polarization and it col­
limates both co- and cross-polarization components. However, the elements of a 
reflectarray can be selected on the basis of low cross-polarization radiation (such 
as printed dipole), which leads to diffraction and scattering of cross-polarization 
component of the feed radiation. Hence, one can expect superior cross-polarization 
performance with a feed of moderate cross-polarization performance in the case of 
center-fed broadside reflectarray as compared to it conventional reflector counter­
part. The same statement holds for the case of offset-fed reflectors that are plagued 
by relatively high cross-polarization for observation angles off the main beam. The 
equivalent offset-fed reflectarray can attain better cross-polarization as compared 
to its equivalent conventional reflector, as a result of the polarization selectivity of 
its constituent elements. 
2.2.4  Phase Efficiency
Deviation from uniform phase on the radiating aperture of the antenna leads to 
degradation in antenna gain. The measure of phase uniformity is defined as follows:

The uniformity of the aperture field distribution of a reflectarray can be dis­
rupted by three factors. The first stems from using infinite periodic structure as­
sumption at the design stage of the reflectarray. It should be noted that gradual 
variation of the geometrical features of the constituent elements of reflectarray 
throughout its aperture is a deviation from infinite periodic structure assumption at 
the design stage. Therefore, the actual phase that is realized on the reflectarray can 
be different from the desired phase. Departure from desired phase values is more 
intense in the transition regions where there is a phase jump from 0 to 2π, which 
is manifested in abrupt changes of element dimensions in such regions. Noting that 
the phase transformation is carried out in a quantized fashion, a quantization er­
ror might occur for lattice size in excess of λ/2. However, the quantization error is 
less than 0.1 dB if the lattice size is in the order of a half-wavelength and reduces 
rapidly as the lattice size shrinks. Therefore, one can see the importance of main­
taining small lattice size in achieving uniform phase because the quantization error 

2.2  Aperture Efficiency of Reflectarray and Comparison with Conventional Parabolic Reflector 
17
is reduced significantly and also the assumption of infinite periodic structure be­
comes more relevant. The second source of nonuniform phase is fabrication error. 
The etching technology that is used for the fabrication of the reflectarray should 
be capable of exact realization of design dimensions. Any error in fabrication leads 
to deviation from desired phase. Surface roughness in the case of conventional 
solid reflectors acts similarly in degrading phase efficiency. It is usually difficult to 
maintain roughness tolerance for large reflectors that operate in Ka- and higher 
frequency bands, whereas the required fabrication tolerance for reflectarrays in 
such bands is well within the realm of conventional lithographic techniques. The 
last factor that can adversely impact the phase uniformity of aperture field distribu­
tion is deviation of the radiated phase front of the feed from spherical phase front 
and also movement of the feed phase centre throughout the operating band of the 
reflectarray. This issue can either be addressed by careful selection of the feed or 
dispersion engineering of the elements reflected phase to compensate for the move­
ment of the phase center of the feed.
2.2.5  Blockage Efficiency
The feed assembly blocks the aperture radiation and hence degrades the perfor­
mance by reducing the gain and also increasing the cross-polarization. Calculation 
of the following expression gives a measure of the adverse effect of blockage on the 
antenna performance:

where b is the radius of the feed region. Feed blockage is inevitable in the case of 
centre-fed parabolic reflectors. The larger the feed assembly is, the lower is the 
blockage efficiency. However, a center-fed reflectarray can be designed to avoid 
the blockage completely by setting the direction of the outgoing beam appropri­
ately. Implementing this measure, higher blockage efficiency is quite practical in the 
case of center-fed reflectarrays. Additionally, feed return loss can be significantly 
improved in the case of center-fed reflectarray by setting the outgoing beam at an 
off-boresight direction to avoid the feed assembly region.
2.2.6  Dielectric and Conductor Loss
Conductor loss and substrate loss are among the other factors that can reduce the 
efficiency of the reflectarray. These two loss factors lead to less than unity reflec­
tion coefficient for the reflectarray. Methods will be presented in Chapter 7 of this 
book to mitigate the losses of reflectarray structures etched on lossy substrate. This 
particular loss factor can be quantified using the following expression:

where Γn is reflection from the nth cell element and summation has been carried out 
over the total N cells. 
Some of these efficiency figures were estimated in [3] for a typical reflectarray 
structure. Dielectric and conductor losses were underlined in the case discussed for 
two 6-inch reflectarrays that were designed to operate at 28.0 GHz. One of the re­
flectarrays was etched on 0.020-inch Duroid material with εr = 2.2 of loss tangent 
0.0028 and the other was etched on 0.010-inch Taconic TLE substrate of εr = 2.95 
and loss tangent 0.0074. Both reflectarrays were center-fed with the same feed and 
the subtended angle was set to 72°. This translated to −7-dB edge taper at the rim 
of the reflectarray. The reflectarrays were designed to scan the main beam to 25 to 
mitigate the feed blockage. Figure 2.8 shows a view of the reflectarray. Calculated 
efficiency figures for these two reflectarrays are tabulated in Table 2.1. 
In summary, using figures of merit that are used in the case of conventional 
reflector to assess its performance and efficiency leads to meaningful measures in 
the case of reflectarray. However, one should be attentive of the differences of re­
flectarrays and reflectors when using these criteria to assess the performance of the 
former. 
2.3  Simplest Reflectarray Cell Element: Microstrip Patch 
The salient feature of a reflectarray is that it is composed of a quasi-periodic lat­
tice of elements etched on substrate. Therefore, any new insight or technological 
advancement in the fields of periodic structures and printed microstrip patches can 
potentially benefit the performance of reflectarrays. Microstrip patch and printed 
dipole are among the most widely studied radiating printed elements. Therefore,

their use was prevalent at the early phase of reflectarray research and development 
[4, 5]. This section is devoted to presentation of microstrip patch as a cell of a 
reflectarray and description of related trade-offs and trends. It is an overture to a 
more detailed description of different types of cell elements that will be presented 
in Chapter 3.
2.3.1  Phase Versus Length Curves
A microstrip patch is a resonant type radiator [6] and the nature of its resonance is 
a function of its geometrical parameters and also the thickness and permittivity of 
the supporting substrate. However, frequency selective surfaces (FSS) composed of 
microstrip patches have been studied extensively in the past [7]. General trends that 
govern a reflectarray antenna that employs microstrip patch as its cell element can 
be deduced from the prior knowledge and research on microstrip patch antennas 
and also FSS structures comprised of such elements. 
Referring to Figure 2.4, which depicts side and top views of a two-dimensional 
lattice of microstrip patches etched on lossless dielectric substrate, it is well known 
that in the absence of the ground plane, the resulting FSS operates as a reflective 
structure at resonance that represents series resonance [7]. The effect of the ground 
plane on a thin substrate can be approximated to the first order as an inductive 
loading of the series resonance circuit that shifts down the series resonance fre­
quency of FSS while imposing unity reflection throughout the band. The approxi­
mate equivalent circuit of the structure is shown in Figure 2.9. Changing the size of 
the patch shifts the resonant frequency of the FSS without the ground plane. The 
phase variation of the reflected wave versus the length of the patch is plotted in 
Figure 2.10 for the FSS with a ground plane. It is seen that the phase shift swings 
approximately between −160° and 180° and it crosses 0° in between which rep­
resents the resonance of the grounded FSS structure. The slope of the phase curve 
while it crosses 0° is a representative of the bandwidth. The more gradual slope 
corresponds to the wider bandwidth of the element. A demonstration of this state­
ment will be given in Chapter 3 when microstrip and printed dipole cell elements 
are discussed in more detail.

Figure 2.11 gives the phasor diagram of scattering from the FSS with ground 
for a better understanding of the physical phenomenon. It is to be noted scattering 
is composed of scattering from the grounded substrate and the periodic structure 
that is etched on the substrate. The scattering from the grounded substrate is unity, 
whereas scattering from the periodic structure can exceed unity and phasor ad­
dition of these two scattering components amounts to unity. In other words, the 
addition of the two amounts to unity magnitude reflection coefficient and phase φ.
2.3.2  General Trends for Phase-Length Characteristics of the Patch
The effects of structural parameters such as dielectric constant of the substrate, 
substrate height, substrate loss, and angle of incidence of the incoming plane wave 
on phase-length characteristic of the reflectarray cell element are discussed in this 
section. These trends are generally valid for other types of cell elements.
Increasing the substrate permittivity generally leads to lower resonant frequen­
cy for an FSS structure [8]. This general trend when applied to the case of reflectar­
ray cell element translates into the shift of the phase-length characteristics towards 
shorter patches as shown in Figure 2.12. It is also quite insightful to draw conclu­
sions from the point of view of the operation of the cell element at the element

level, namely, microstrip patch. It is known that increasing the substrate permittiv­
ity increases the reactive power which drives up the quality factor Q and reduces 
the bandwidth of a microstrip patch element [2, 6]. Application of this observation 
to the case of the patch as the cell element of a reflectarray leads to the conclusion 
that the phase-length slope increases as the substrate permittivity increases which is 
actually the trend that is observed in Figure 2.12. Generally, the width of the phase 
transition region represents the width of the resonance. Therefore, more gradual 
slope represents a wider transition and also wider element bandwidth.

Fundamentals of Reflectarray and General Design Guidelines
The effect of the substrate height on the phase-length characteristic of the patch 
cell element is shown in Figure 2.13, which demonstrates reduction of the realiz­
able phase range as the substrate height is increased. The reduced phase range leads 
to phase error on the reflectarray because the whole 360° phase range is required 
to realize the correct phase transformation. Therefore, reduced phase range leads 
to lower phase efficiency.
Dielectric substrates are inherently lossy and this is another factor in the deg­
radation of the performance of a reflectarray. The electrical current on the element 
reaches its maximum when the element is resonant for the length that is at the cen­
ter of phase-length curve. Maximum current flow on the elements leads to maxi­
mum loss at resonant conditions. This conclusion can be drawn from Figure 2.14, 
which shows the return loss as a function for dielectric loss. Having established a 
relationship between resonance and loss, one can conclude that the more intense 
the resonance, the higher the loss. Therefore, any factor that enhances the reso­
nance such as: decreasing patch width, decreasing substrate height, and increasing 
substrate permittivity can lead to narrower, more intense resonance and thus higher 
loss. The impact of thickness of the lossy substrate on the return loss performance 
is also shown in Figure 2.14. It is to be noted that ∆L represents deviation from 
resonant length and the peak of the loss occurs when this deviation vanishes. The 
above statements hold for moderate amounts of loss in dielectric substrates and 
some of the above trends might reverse for excessive loss as pointed out in [10]. 
Methods to mitigate the impact of lossy substrates on reflectarray performance will 
be studied in detail in Chapter 7. 
As will be discussed in Chapter 5, the analysis of the reflectarray is based on the 
assumption that it is locally periodic or quasiperiodic. In other words, each region 
of the reflectarray is assumed to be an infinite periodic structure that is illuminated 
by a plane wave propagating along the line that connects the feed to the center

of that same region with same polarization as the feed. For a center-fed reflectar­
ray that is shown in Figure 2.6, it is evident that as the subtended angle decreases 
(smaller F/D ratio), the incident angle of the plane wave for the peripheral regions 
of reflectarray deviates further from normal incidence. Therefore, it is important to 
account for the angular sensitivity of the phase response of the element for reflec­
tarray with small F/D ratio (typically F/D < 0.5). Angular sensitivity of a typical 
patch cell element is shown in Figure 2.15, which shows a noticeable deviation 
from normal incidence as the angle of incidence exceeds θ0 = 20°.

Different Types of Cell Elements for 
Reflectarrays
As noted previously, a reflectarray is a quasi-periodic assembly of elements that 
operates in an array environment to achieve a given phase transformation. These 
elements can be printed elements or volumetric types such as patches [1, 2] or 
dielectric resonators [3], respectively. The advantage of printed elements is their 
simplicity in terms of fabrication process. However, the quasi-periodic nature of a 
reflectarray establishes its similarity to a frequency selective surface (FSS). There­
fore, advancements in the fields of FSSs and printed antenna elements can directly 
benefit reflectarray technology. A large class of reflectarray cell elements has been 
inspired by earlier developments in these two fields.
Different types of cell elements have been devised to respond to different sets of 
requirements in the fabrication and operation of a reflectarray, such as mechanical 
robustness, fabrication accuracy, bandwidth, polarization, and so on. The mecha­
nism through which a periodic arrangement of cell elements imparts phase onto 
an incident plane wave has been adopted in this chapter as a means of systematic 
investigation and study of reflectarray cell elements. Different types of resonant 
cell elements will be addressed. Subsequently, elements that use loading effect as a 
means of shifting the phase of plane wave excitation will be presented. Emerging 
subwavelength cell elements are also included. 
3.1  Resonant Cell Elements
An FSS structure composed of patches was briefly studied in Section 2.3 and it was 
pointed out that by covering the back of the FSS with PEC, its series resonance can 
be used to impart a phase shift of nearly 360° to an incoming plane wave. Printed 
patches are one of the many types of resonant radiators that can be used to realize 
reflectarrays. Among these are stacked patches, different types of loop elements 
(square loop, cross loop, multiloop), and different combinations of slot and patch 
that will be presented in this chapter.

Different Types of Cell Elements for Reflectarrays
3.1.1  Patch Element
The magnitude of the reflection coefficient of FSS without ground plane and the 
reflection phase of the same structure in the presence of the ground plane at the 
back of the substrate are shown in Figure 3.1. Both structures are illuminated by 
normally incident plane wave and it is obvious that the magnitude of the reflection 
for the FSS with ground plane is unity (assuming lossless materials). It is interest­
ing to note that the phase of the FSS with ground plane goes through a 360° cycle 
and the reflection coefficient of the FSS without ground plane goes through series 
resonance. Using this simple physical observation, it is sufficient to judiciously ad­
just the size of the cell element and the height of dielectric substrate to impart a 
given phase shift to the reflection from the reflectarray cell element. The effect of 
the ground plane can be captured by a parallel inductive element that lowers that 
resonant frequency of the FSS. Figure 3.2 shows the phase versus length plot for the 
reflectarray cell element (FSS with ground plane in the back) at f = 7.5 GHz. The 
slope of the phase-length plot corresponds to the bandwidth of the FSS without 
ground plane, as will be shown in Chapter 6. 
The same line of reasoning can be followed to make further conclusions about 
the trends that govern phase-length characteristics of the reflectarray cell element 
from the knowledge of its FSS counterpart. For instance, it is well known [4] that 
the bandwidth of FSS composed of printed patches is reduced as the patch width 
is reduced, which is shown in Figure 3.3. The phase response of the reflectarray 
cell element, which is actually FSS with PEC backing, is shown in Figure 3.4 for 
different widths of the cell element. The phase response of the structure for differ­
ent widths is the same throughout the band apart from the frequency band within 
the dotted enclosure, which is labeled as the resonant region. It is evident that,

within this resonant band, the periodic structure contributes significantly to the 
phase response and the slope of phase-frequency plot is increased as the width of 
the element is decreased, which is an indication of the reduced bandwidth of the 
cell element. 
Having obtained the phase response of a given patch element across the fre­
quency band, it is anticipated that variation of the patch length while the operating 
frequency is held constant leads to a variation of the phase of reflection from the 
periodic structure because changing the patch length changes its resonant condi­
tion. Typical phase-length characteristics for microstrip patch as reflectarray cell 
element are shown in Figure 3.5 for different widths of the patch element. Again, 
it is observed that shrinking the patch width leads to a steeper slope for the phase-
length plot, which is an indication of narrower element bandwidth.
The reduction of the patch width leads to a steeper phase characteristic, which 
implies increased tolerance in terms of fabrication efficiency. Fabrication error is 
amplified by the high slope of the phase-length curve. Printed dipoles are gener­
ally narrowband, which is synonymous to a steeper phase curve. However, such 
elements are highly selective of the polarization of the incoming wave. To improve 
their operating bandwidth while preserving their polarization selectivity, dipole ele­
ments can be set into the Gangbuster configuration that has already been widely 
used in the context of FSS [5]. Figure 3.6 shows a Gangbuster structure along with 
its phase-length curve [6]. It is anticipated that the bandwidth of the element can be 
further enhanced by increasing the order of the Gangbuster structure.
3.1.2  Multiresonant Patch Cell Elements
Stacking two patches that are of slightly different sizes is a known technique to 
broaden the bandwidth of microstrip patch antenna [7]. However, it should be 
noted that structure is more complex in terms of fabrication as compared to a 
single-layer microstrip patch. Wider bandwidth is the result of coupled resonance 
of two patches with isolated resonances in close proximity of each other. Figure 
3.7 shows a two-layer reflectarray that employs stacked patch as its cell element 
[8, 9]. This particular cell element has clearly been inspired by the development

of wideband microstrip radiators and attempts to exploit this same feature of the 
isolated radiator to broaden the operating band of the reflectarray. The variation of 
the size of the cell element was used to achieve the required phase shift for reflected 
wave from the reflectarray as shown in Figure 3.8. The phase characteristic of the

three-layer cell element is also shown in the same figure. It is to be noted that the 
size of patch elements of a given cell were varied simultaneously and the relative 
size of the patches on the layers (whether a two- or three-layer cell element) was 
held constant. As will be seen in the case of multiresonant loop elements, this is only 
one of the strategies in the toolbox of the designer to achieve a wideband cell ele­
ment. For instance, instead of selecting relative size of the patches as constant, one 
can enforce the actual difference between the patch sizes (a1 − a2) to be a constant 
parameter of design. It is evident from Figure 3.8 that coupled resonance of the 
stacked patch cell element has resulted in a smoother and also more gradual phase-
length characteristic. Changing the ratio of the stacked patch elements results in 
the variation of the slope of phase-length characteristics, which will be discussed in 
Chapter 6, and has been used to mitigate frequency dispersion to realize wideband 
large reflectarray structures. 
Multiresonance behavior can also be obtained by embedding a secondary reso­
nant element such as a slot or multiplicity of slots within the patch radiator [10]. 
This same technique has been used in the context of reflectarray cell element to 
broaden the element bandwidth and at the same time use the freedom of control­
ling the resonant frequencies to mitigate frequency dispersion [11, 12]. One pos­
sibility for embedding the slot(s) within the patch is shown in Figure 3.9.
It should be noted that the first resonance of the patch (slot) is capacitive (in­
ductive), which dictates the substrate thickness accordingly to cancel the reactive 
part of the impedance and obtain resonance. Therefore, one of the two resonators 
becomes active depending on the height of the substrate. Phase-slot length char­
acteristics for different heights of the substrate are shown in Figure 3.10 which 
confirms patch only resonance for inductive PEC backed substrate [h = 1.0 mm of 
Figure 3.10(a)] and slot only resonance for capacitive backed substrate [h = 7.0 mm 
of Figure 3.10(c)]. However, both patch and slot are resonant for a substrate thick­
ness between these two extremes [h = 3.175 mm of Figure 3.10(b)], which leads to 
a more gradual phase-slot length characteristic. The full 360° phase span can be 
obtained by using the patch size as a parameter.

3.2  Loop Elements

3.2  Loop Elements
It is well understood in the FSS research that cell element should be as small as 
possible to avoid excitation of higher-order modes and also achieve broadband 
response and stable performance as the incident angle of the incoming plane varies 
[5]. Loop element meets this requirement in the sense that for the same size of the 
loop and microstrip patch, the resonant frequency of the loop is lower. Resonance 
of the loop is dictated by the size of its periphery, whereas resonant dimension of the 
patch is its length, hence follows the possibility of a denser lattice for an FSS com­
prised of loop. The small resonant size of the element serves the twofold objective 
of the exclusion of the higher-order modes and enhancement of the validity of the 
commonly used infinite periodic structure approximation that is used in the design 
of a reflectarray. A smaller reflectarray cell element is also superior in capturing 
sharp and abrupt phase reversals on the reflectarray, as will be pointed out later.
To demonstrate the trends that govern the phase-length behavior of loop struc­
tures, a comparison has been made in Figure 3.11 between phase characteristics 
of infinite periodic structures composed of single-loop cell and double-loop cell 
elements, respectively. As can be seen, the presence of two loops leads to two reso­
nances which are represented as two transition regions in the phase-length charac­
teristics of this particular element. The presence of two transition regions increases 
the attainable phase range as compared to the single ring case. The higher slope 
of the phase-length curve in the second transition region of the two-loop cell ele­
ment points to the simultaneous resonance of both loops for this range of element 
dimensions. It is demonstrated in Figure 3.12 that the attainable phase range can 
be increased for a double-ring cell element in comparison to a solid patch. Another 
parameter that can be utilized to adjust phase versus length slope is the spacing 
between the two rings, as shown in Figure 3.11. 
The cross-loop cell element shown in Figure 3.13 is a variation of the loop cell 
element that has been the subject of intense study for broadband reflectarray op­
eration [14, 15]. Phase versus outer dimension of the cross loop structure is shown 
in Figure 3.14, which confirms the possibility of achieving a very smooth phase 
characteristic by adjusting the separation between the two loops. 
Embedding additional loops within a larger loop gives rise to a higher number 
of resonances and transition regions. Figure 3.15 presents a comparison between

central frequency of 12.5 GHz. (© 2005 John Wiley & Sons. From: [11].)

phase length of multiloop structures to demonstrate clearly one single resonance 
for each additional loop. It is important to note that simultaneous resonance of the 
loops is translated into a higher slope of the phase-length characteristics in such 
regions. A given phase-length characteristic can be tailored by adjusting the cou­
pling between the loops through judicious selection of separation between them. A 
combination of different types of loop elements along with adjustment of separa­
tion between them was used to attain significantly smoother phase-length charac­
teristics as shown in Figure 3.16. A medium-size prototype reflectarray that was 
designed using this element attained a 1-dB gain bandwidth of 24% and 60% 
aperture efficiency [16].
At the border of two neighboring Fresnel zones of a reflectarray, the required 
phase shift switches from 0° to 360°. This abrupt change of phase gives rise to 
similar change in the size of the elements that are located in that neighborhood as 
shown in Figure 3.17. The calculated phase from the Floquet analysis is no longer 
valid in these regions because the infinite periodicity assumption has been violated.

Therefore, special types of elements such as the one shown in Figure 3.18 have 
been devised to overcome abrupt change of the geometry while maintaining the 
phase jump [18]. As can be seen, there is a high similarity between the first and

subwavelength elements to optimize similarity between adjacent elements located 
at border to two Fresnel zones.

The resonant condition of a system can be altered by loading the system with reac­
tive elements. This has been the guiding principle of the early reflectarray [19]. A

patch that is loaded by a microstrip line. The incoming plane wave is intercepted by 
the patch coupled into the line, reflected back from the open circuit, and reradiated 
by the patch. The phase of the reflected wave is determined by the length of the 
microstrip line. Different variations of this element type have been reported in the 
literature. For instance, in a measure to improve cross-polarization performance of 
the reflectarray, mirror symmetry can be enforced on delay lines as shown in Figure 
3.20.
Another loading mechanism is shown in Figure 3.21, which consists of a reso­
nant microstrip patch loaded with a slot in the ground plane [21]. Variation of the 
slot length alters loading condition and changes the phase of the reflected wave as 
shown in Figure 3.22. 
The addition of a varying microstrip line to the slot-coupled patch with a simi­
lar size throughout the reflectarray has led to the element that is shown in Figure

to reside inside dotted ellipses superimposed. (© 1999 IEEE. From: [17].)

3.23 [22]. Two different implementations of the delay line have been have been 
introduced in the figure to realize truncated 360° and phase delay in excess of 360° 
to achieve true time delay and increase the reflectarray bandwidth, as will be dis­
cussed in Chapter 6. The phase versus length of delay line characteristics is shown 
in Figure 3.24 for U-shaped delay line which shows close to 3 × 360° phase shift 
for the whole range of line length. The geometrical parameters of the cell element 
are given in the Table 3.1. The occurrence of phase cycles in excess of a single 360° 
cycle for the reflected phase of the cell element has the effect of delaying the emer­
gence of phase jumps as shown in Figure 3.25, which also provides a comparison 
between the required phase for reflectarrays composed of elements with one and 
three cycles of 360°. This can lead to less phase jumps on reflectarray and higher 
phase efficiency.

This same element was later evolved to a cluster of slot coupled patches with 
delay line loading, which is shown in Figure 3.26. The main advantage of this 
element, as will be explained in Chapter 9, is that it reduces the number of ac­
tive elements by a factor of two for electronically steerable reflectarrays because 
each phase shifter at the end of the delay line can be dedicated to a cluster of two

3.4  Volumetric Cell Elements

The list of reflectarray cell elements based on loading mechanism is not limited 
to what has been presented above and other creative geometries have also been 
reported in the literature. Figure 3.28 shows an example of such an element which 
is based on loading a patch of constant size with a variable interdigital capacitor. 
The variation of the finger size of the capacitor is used to realize close to 1,000° 
phase shift. 
3.4  Volumetric Cell Elements
Resonant radiating elements are by no means restricted to planar structures. Volu­
metric three-dimensional structures such as dielectric resonators (DRs) [25] and 
waveguide-fed antennas [26] have been subject of intensive research and develop­
ment. Therefore, these same resonant radiators can be utilized as cell elements of 
reflectarrays. The resulting reflectarray structure is at disadvantage from the point 
of view of fabrication complexity as compared to its counterpart that utilizes planar 
cell element. 
The first reflectarray comprised of DRs was reported in [27], which suggested 
variation of the length dimension of DR elements to adjust the phase shift. Figure 
3.29 shows the cell element along with the fabricated reflectarray. The phase-DR 
length characteristic is shown in Figure 3.30. Similar to planar resonant elements, 
other methods of realization of phase shift such as loading has been attempted [28]. 
A strip with variable length on the top face of an otherwise similar DR throughout 
the reflectarray was utilized to adjust the phase of the reflected wave [28]. 
Another type of volumetric cell element that is used in the fabrication of reflec­
tarray is rectangular groove [29]. In this case, the height of the rectangular groove 
was changed to adjust the phase of the reflected wave. Figure 3.31 shows a view of 
the cell element and also the reflectarray. 
An important shortcoming of reflectarray composed of volumetric cell ele­
ments is that it is very difficult to embed multipolarization and/or multiband capa­
bilities within such structures. This has been an important shortcoming on further 
development of such antennas.

3.5  Subwavelength, Coupled Resonant Elements
3.5.1  Subwavelength Patches and Loops
The patch element is ubiquitous in antenna engineering in general and finds a com­
fortable home in reflectarray designs. The patch element placed in a resonant lat­
tice (half-wavelength spacing) can be self-resonant; that is, it can exhibit resonance 
irrespective of the adjacent elements in the lattice, provided that the ground plane 
is present and is at an appropriate distance from the patch. This is an expected 
property because a single patch antenna, fed by probe or microstrip line, can be 
a resonant antenna. If the patch is electrically small, it can no longer exhibit reso­
nance and hence cannot be used productively in reflectarray designs. However, 
as additional elements are brought adjacent to the electrically small patch (form­
ing a periodic structure), a coupled resonance can arise. The coupling between

adjacent elements gives rise to a useful resonance and hence electrically small or 
subwavelength, coupled resonant elements can indeed be used to great advantage in 
reflectarray designs. The design approach is indistinguishable from the traditional 
approach involving resonant elements; the only difference is that the lattice size is 
less than half-wavelength and thus a greater number of elements are used in any

given reflectarray design. Lastly, it should be pointed out that the geometry of any 
subwavelength element can be utilized as a resonant element (assuming scaling up 
in size in a larger lattice). The elements discussed in this section are therefore not 
unique to the subwavelength regime. However, they are shown to operate uniquely 
well in the subwavelength regime, with the upcoming elements showing a gradual 
decrease in the overall lattice dimensions in which they reside.
The first suggestion that a subwavelength element can be used in reflectarray 
designs involved subwavelength patches appeared in [30]. The author used the term 
“artificial impedance surface” to describe the elements, but the design approach us­
ing array theory, aperture discretization, and the conversion of a spherical phase 
front to a planar phase front remains unchanged. It was however noted that very 
small feature sizes (small interelement gaps) were required to obtain a full range 
of reflection phase. Nevertheless, the lattice size can be reduced from the standard 
λ/2 lattice to the smaller λ/3 lattice. The benefit obtained through the lattice size 
reduction was an immediate improvement in gain-bandwidth performance. A min­
ute amount of gain was lost, mostly due to a reduction in the phase range, but this 
is deemed an acceptable price to pay for a substantial improvement in bandwidth 
(from 12% to 22%). An example of the gain-bandwidth curves for resonant and

subwavelength-based reflectarrays is shown in Figure 3.32(a) and an example of a 
subwavelength reflectarray layout is shown in Figure 3.32(b).
A paper involving the use of polarization-sensitive subwavelength rectangular 
patches was considered [31] whereby the beneficial wideband behavior was used 
in a reflectarray that also converted linearly polarized feed radiation into circular 
polarization.
To further reduce the lattice size, the authors in [32] used a multilayer stack 
of subwavelength patches. The additional layer improved the phase range for the 
smaller lattice size of λ/4, with the benefits of improved bandwidth obtained there­
after. An example of the gain-bandwidth curves for resonant and subwavelength 
based reflectarrays is shown in Figure 3.33(a) and an example of a subwavelength 
multilayer reflectarray patch element is shown in Figure 3.33(b).
A study on the properties of subwavelength elements was discussed in [33], 
with the conclusion that subwavelength elements provide a reduced angular sen­
sitivity over their resonant counterparts, making them ideal candidates for electri­
cally large reflectarray designs. However, the benefit of reduced angular sensitivity 
is found for any size of reflectarray because the oft-assumed normal incidence is 
approximate for any sized reflectarray. Examples of the reflection phase curves for 
resonant and subwavelength patches are shown in Figures 3.34(a) and 3.34(b), 
respectively, for various angles of incidence.
Further reduction in lattice size was obtained through the use of subwavelength 
loops [34–37]. The subwavelength loop was shown to provide upwards of 300° 
phase range for a substantially smaller lattice size of λ/6. This improved phase 
range and smaller lattice size was found to be possible using modest etching re­
quirements as opposed to more stringent etching requirements of patches [30–33]. 
Currently, λ/6 is the smallest lattice size used in a fabricated reflectarray design (Ku-
band). An additional benefit of the smaller lattice is a substantial reduction in di­
electric and ohmic losses in the substrate and metal regions, which will be discussed

at length in Chapter 7. The superior behavior of the loop element over the patch 
in the subwavelength lattice arises from the additional inductance obtained from 
the loop structure over that of the patch structure [37]. The additional inductance 
effectively lowers the resonance frequency and hence a smaller lattice size can be 
successfully arranged. 
Due to the very low-frequency dispersion of the reflection phase of subwave­
length loops, the gain-bandwidth of a reflectarray using these elements is wide­
band. A reflectarray is designed with specifications: center frequency of 12.5 GHz, 
offset feed of 16°, main beam direct reflection of F/D = 1.13, aperture size of 400 
mm, lattice size of 4 mm, and Rogers 3003 of 125-mil substrate with the feed horn 
Q-par QSH17S15S. The resulting fabricated reflectarray is shown in Figure 3.35(a) 
and the gain versus frequency shown in Figure 3.35(b). The 1-dB gain bandwidth 
obtained is 19% and the aperture efficiency approximately 60%.
3.5.2  Advanced Subwavelength Elements
3.5.2.1  Dogbone Element
More advanced subwavelength elements can be envisioned beyond that of the patch 
and loop elements. An element observed in periodic structure research, mostly in­
volving frequency selective surfaces, includes the dogbone element, shown in Fig­
ure 3.36(a). By varying the numerous physical parameters, one is able to obtain a

myriad of possible reflection phases and phase dispersions (variation of phase with 
respect to frequency). Consider a lattice size of 4 mm, a center frequency of 12.5 
GHz, and a 125-mil FR4 substrate (loss tangent of 0.016 and relative permittivity 
of 4.45). We then vary the dimensions of rectangular patches, rectangular loops, 
and the newly introduced dogbone element over all possible configurations with 
parameter variation density on the order of 0.2 mm. The resulting reflection phase 
versus dispersion is shown in Figure 3.36(b). Note that the patch element offers a 
limited range of reflection phase (<250°) while the loop element provides in excess 
of 300°. Additionally, the dogbone element shows a complete 360° phase range but 
also a much wider range of phase dispersions. As we will discuss in Chapter 6, the 
ability to select from a host of elements with varying phase dispersions for any given 
reflection phase is of paramount importance when designing a wideband reflectar­
ray. Thus, the dogbone element represents a superior selection over the patch and 
loop element if bandwidth is of particular interest. Note that the element is polar­
ization sensitive, which can be undesirable in some applications; a Jerusalem cross 
can be used in its stead for polarization insensitive applications.

Different Types of Cell Elements for Reflectarrays
3.5.2.2  Extended Dogbone Element
We now introduce an additional reflectarray element, which we will denote as the 
extended dogbone element, as shown in Figure 3.37. This element exhibits a very 
large number of tunable physical parameters. However, it was discovered that by 
the selection of d1 = d2 = 0.2 mm and varying L, e1, and e2 in tandem, an interest­
ing property arises. Maintaining identical lattice and substrate parameters from the 
previous basic dogbone example, thus remaining in the electrically small λ/6 lattice, 
the double-resonance phenomenon appears, as shown in Figure 3.38. Despite being 
in the electrically small confines, the element exhibits two resonances: one associ­
ated with the cross-element coupling along the edge associated with the length L 
and a secondary resonance associated with the interelement (self) coupling along 
the length e2. The electrically small element provides over 600 of reflection phase 
variation. It is well established that multiresonant elements can be beneficial in de­
signing wideband elements. An additional unique property of this element is that a 
moderately sized reflectarray designed using the extended dogbone would exhibit a 
smooth transition through the first Fresnel zone due to the property of greater than 
360° phase range.
3.5.2.3  Rectangular Extended Dogbone Element
Consider again the extended dogbone from the previous discussion. Because this 
element has greater than 600° of phase range, and a reflectarray requires only 360° 
(somewhat less with marginal gain drop), we should be able to reduce the size of 
the element and still design a high-gain reflectarray. The first attempt at cell size re­
duction maintains the 4-mm lattice dimension horizontally, but reduces the cell size 
vertically from 4 mm to 1.6 mm (from λ/6 down to λ/15). This leads to an incredibly 
fine aperture sample density along one of the planes, which is fortuitously parallel 
to the polarization associated with sufficient 350° phase variation. The rectangular 
element is shown in Figure 3.39. The parameters are set to d1 = d2 = g = 0.2 mm and

H = 1.4 mm at most. The lengths L1 + L2 + L3 are varied in tandem. The reflection 
phase of this element is shown in Figure 3.40, showing 350° of phase range from 
a λ/6 by λ/15 lattice. Such an element should provide excellent angle of incidence 
insensitivity in a linear polarized reflectarray, allowing for improved aperture ef­
ficiency and lower than typical F/D ratios.
3.5.3  Subwavelength Fragmented Elements
The subwavelength fragmented element for reflectarrays was first introduced in 
[39, 40]. The notion of a fragmented antenna has been used elsewhere (refer to [40] 
for a thorough review) and finds use in the design of reflectarrays. The fragmented 
element concept can be described as the discretization (or fragmentation) of the 
lattice space of a periodic structure and then optimization of the geometry of the 
element can proceed unimpeded by geometric restrictions. In other words, rather 
than simply varying the element length or line width, the entire geometry itself is 
varied amongst many possible shapes. For example, an element that is discretized 
to have 19 × 19 fragments (or pixels) has a startling 4.69 × 10108 possible element 
shapes. Parameter sweeping is obviously not an option; thus, optimization is a 
necessity. In particular, genetic algorithms are a natural selection as the driving 
optimizer for fragmented antennas. An example of a fragmented reflectarray ele­
ment (in unaltered form) is shown in Figure 3.41(a), while an optimized element

dogbone element.

is shown in Figure 3.41(b), and lastly the actual etched element shape shown in 
Figure 3.41(c). As a last point before moving onto practical examples, there are 
two motivating factors in using subwavelength fragmented elements: (1) we know 
that subwavelength elements offer distinct electrical performance advantages over 
resonant elements and (2) due to the smaller physical size of the subwavelength 
element, the electrically dense mesh discretization implies the expansion functions 
describe behavior over electrically small regions and hence will provide a more ac­
curate simulation result.

Different Types of Cell Elements for Reflectarrays
3.5.3.1  Similarity-Optimized Reflectarray Elements
The first application of subwavelength fragmented elements is for the synthesis of 
very high aperture efficiency reflectarrays. As discussed in Chapter 2, a reflectarray 
has an upper bound on aperture efficiency given the feed illumination and spillover 
efficiencies. A reflectarray that exhibits a perfect, error free spherical-to-plane wave 
conversion will obtain aperture efficiency (gain) that reaches this limit. To achieve 
this limit, the elements in the reflectarray must provide precisely the required re­
flection phase. The majority of reflectarrays are designed using periodic structure 
analysis. Namely, an element is placed in an infinite periodic structure, its physical 
properties are varied, and the resulting reflection phase values obtained allow one to 
synthesize the reflectarray surface. When the element is used in practice, it no longer 
resides in the presumed infinite and uniform periodic structure. It now appears in a 
finite structure that is potentially very highly nonuniform. The consequence is that 
the reflection phase is in error in regions where nonuniformity is greatest, that is, 
significant geometric discontinuities in the reflectarray elements. One method that 
can be used to mitigate the nonuniformity is known as the surrounded-element 
technique [41]. Any number of elements in the reflectarray can be simulated in the 
vicinity of the actual environment within which it resides and the physical proper­
ties tuned to obtain the precise reflection phase desired. While effective, it requires 
a fair amount of computational overhead.
Alternatively, we introduce the concept of similarity-optimized reflectarray ele­
ments. The technique can be described simply as the shape optimization of reflec­
tarray elements for both reflection phase and geometric similarity between adja­
cent elements in the reflectarray. This is accomplished by starting with a particular 
reflection phase (e.g., 180), optimizing for the phase and proceeding to the next 
desired reflection phase (e.g., 170°). Upon obtaining the desired phase, the geo­
metric similarity between the current element (170) is maximized with respect to 
the previous element (180°). Upon conclusion, the two elements now provide a 
set of desired reflection phases and additionally exhibit a high degree of geometric 
similarity.
Consider a reflectarray with the following design specifications:
••
Frequency of 12.5 GHz;
••
Offset feed of 16°; 
••
Main beam direct reflection of F/D = 1.13;
••
Lattice size of 4 mm;
••
4-mm air substrate;
••
Feed horn Q-par QSH17S15S.
A collection of elements were optimized for maximum geometric similarity 
while covering a phase range of 300°. These elements are shown in Figure 3.42. 
One can observe a smooth geometric progression as the reflection phase decreases 
from the first element. The consequence is the elements in the reflectarray will 
exhibit similar smooth variation, thereby reducing the effects of nonuniformity. A 
photograph of the resulting fabricated reflectarray is shown in Figure 3.43 support­
ing this claim.

3.5  Subwavelength, Coupled Resonant Elements 
53
For the given feed and aperture configuration, the maximum gain permissible 
is 33.17 dBi. The measured gain of this reflectarray was 33.06 dBi. The measured 
gain is quite close to the upper bound and thus we conclude that the similarity 
optimization technique is effective in reducing the reflection phase errors over the 
aperture of reflectarray antennas.
3.5.3.2  The Mosaic Reflectarray
The mosaic reflectarray is an antenna design that meets both the requirements of 
a particular set of reflection phases over the surface (e.g., the reflectarrays that we 
have designed thus far) and simultaneously attempts to synthesize an optical im­
age with its surface patterning. We therefore utilize the fragmented reflectarray 
elements in a manner that both meets the requirements of reflection phase as well

as using the metal density (which can be thought of as an optical property of the 
element) to simultaneously mimic an optical image, thus forming a mosaic.
A secondary metric is now used to classify a fragmented element: its metal den­
sity. This quantity will be defined in a basic fashion, giving no concern to the actual 
shape and positional dependence of the metal density. It will simply be defined as 
the ratio of the total number of pixels in a given element divided by the total num­
ber of pixels in the starting element shape (a solid patch in all of our examples). 
The first step in our design process is generating a wide variety of elements with 
which to design our mosaic reflectarray. The ideal collection of elements would 
entail groups of elements with reflection phase in, for example, 10° steps (as was 
done before) only now each reflection phase (effectively an index) has numerous 
elements associated with it, each with a different shape and optimistically with a 
variety of different metal densities. As a first optimization approach, we will simply 
optimize the elements to achieve the desired phase to within 2° error in steps of 10°, 
which is precisely the same approach used previously. The only difference now is 
Figure 3.43  Photograph of similarity-optimized reflectarray.

3.5  Subwavelength, Coupled Resonant Elements 
55
we demand 128 elements from the optimizer for each index, thereby synthesizing 
nearly 4,000 fragmented elements. The minimum, average, and maximum metal 
densities of these elements are shown in Figure 3.44, confirming that we have a 
wide range of metal densities for each index, where index 1 is 180°, index 2 is 170°, 
and so on. An example collection of 128 elements is shown in Figure 3.45 for index 
15 representing resonant elements (reflection phase of zero).
We now proceed with the design of two mosaic based reflectarrays. The re­
flectarray design parameters are identical to that of previous section. The desired 
optical image in both cases is apparent from the photographs of the fabricated re­
flectarrays shown in Figures 3.46(a) and 3.46(b). The measured far-field pattern at 
12.5 GHz is shown in Figure 3.47 for the mosaics in Figures 3.46(a) and 3.46(b), 
showing measured aperture efficiencies of 50% and 55%, which is quite high con­
sidering that the reflectarray collimates at microwave frequencies while simultane­
ously displaying the optical mosaic.
3.5.4  Array Thinning with Subwavelength Elements
The electromagnetic nature of subwavelength elements can be best described 
through the interelement coupling between adjacent elements [42]. The individual 
elements are important, but it is the cross-coupling between elements that give 
rise to the interesting behavior of these elements. A consequence of the criticality 
of coupling is that for the single linear polarization excitation of a subwavelength 
element, only certain elements become relevant for this essential cross-coupling. 
This phenomenon is described graphically in Figure 3.48(b). The regions of low-
intensity coupling imply their presence is unnecessary to generate resonance and 
thus play a diminished role in generating the required range of reflection phases

for reflectarray operation. The supposition is therefore that the lattice dimension in 
Figure 3.48(a) can be altered such that the lattice dimension dx can be dramatically 
increased in size while dy remains subwavelength in electrical size (the orientation of 
electric field polarization is important in this regard). In the Ku-band (12.5 GHz),

the reflection phase of a loop element (substrate 60 mils, εr = 3) is considered with 
lattice size 4 mm × 4 mm (traditional subwavelength lattice) and 4 mm × 12 mm (a 
thinned lattice). The thinned lattice experiences no reduction in achievable phase 
range, although the resonance is sharper, implying a potential reduction in reflec­
tarray bandwidth, as shown in Figure 3.49. Two reflectarrays are fabricated using 
the same configuration as Section 3.5.1, one using a fully populated configuration 
of subwavelength loops and the other using the thinned elements described previ­
ously. The resulting gain bandwidth of the reflectarrays is shown in Figure 3.50(a),

center frequency of 12.5 GHz, there is marginal difference in gain with the only 
consequence in using the thinned array being a reduction in 1-dB gain bandwidth 
from 19% to 15%. The latter obtained bandwidth is ample for many Ku-band 
applications. The thinned reflectarray has potential uses in reconfigurable reflectar­
rays since two-thirds of the reflectarray surface is barren.

Different Types of Reflectarrays
Inherent flexibility in the type of cell elements that can be used in reflectarrays and 
creative ways of synthesizing the lattice structure to accommodate different types 
of cell elements on the same substrate give rise to many variations of reflectarrays 
to address specific operational conditions and specifications. Polarization and/or 
frequency sensitivity of the cell elements can be exploited to realize multiband/
multipolarization reflectarrays with simplified feed apparatus as will be discussed.
While the design of the feed for multiband circularly polarized (CP) conven­
tional reflectors can be a challenging task, a particular cell element is suggested in 
this chapter to realize a dual-band CP reflectarray with simplified two single-band 
linearly polarized (LP) feed structures. Folded reflectarrays will be introduced sub­
sequently as a compact alternative for reflectarray structures. Power combining 
and beam splitting using reflectarrays will also be discussed. There has not been 
much precedence in using a conventional reflector structure in such applications. 
Beam shaping by realization of given aperture phase distribution is subsequently 
presented. Subreflectarray design equations are derived afterwards as a special 
case of shaped-reflector structure in the sense that the structure transforms a given 
spherical wave to another spherical wave (whether being used in Cassegrain or 
Gregorian configuration). 
4.1  Multiband Reflectarray 
The elements of the reflectarray can be selected based on their band of operation 
and then set into a periodic lattice configuration either on the same layer [1–3] or 
on separate layers [4, 5]. Another possibility for the realization of multiband reflec­
tarray structures is to replace the ground plane with an FSS and judiciously cascade 
reflectarray thus constructed [6–8]. 
4.1.1  Single-Layer, Dual-Band Reflectarray with Interlaced Elements
Printed microstrip patch and dipole were discussed in detail in Chapter 3 as the 
cell element of reflectarray. Frequency-sensitive behavior of such cell elements can 
be exploited to realize multiband, single-layer reflectarrays. Dipole and microstrip 
patch elements that operate in two different bands can be interlaced onto the same 
layer of substrate as shown in Figure 4.1. The reflectarray was designed to operate 

64

Different Types of Reflectarrays
with Rx/Tx bands of the Ka-band corresponding to 20/30 GHz. To satisfy more 
stringent link budget and bandwidth requirements for the Tx band, wider band 
microstrip patches were employed as the cell element for that band and thin printed 
dipoles were utilized as the cell element of the lower 20-GHz band. The polariza­
tion of the Tx and Rx bands were orthogonal linear with respect to each other, 
which simplifies the design and operation of the reflectarray.
The phase-length characteristics of the elements at the upper and lower bands 
are shown in Figure 4.2. It can be seen the slope of plot for lower-band elements is 
steeper as compared to the one for higher-band elements. Also, it should be noted 
that the variable dimensions of the Rx-band and Tx-band elements are orthogo­
nal to each other to accommodate the orthogonal linear polarizations of the two 
bands. The reader should note that the phase versus length plots of Figure 4.2 have 
been generated using an in-house software that enforces e−jωt time dependence. This 
reversed hysteresis plots as compared to the general phase plots that were given in 
the previous chapter. 
As shown in Figure 4.1, two pyramidal horns have been used to feed the reflec­
tarray, which simplifies significantly the feed apparatus of the reflectarray as com­
pared to conventional reflectors for which the feeding structure must be a wide­
band horn in conjunction with an orthomode transducer to separate the two bands 
from each other. Variation of the gain of the reflectarray is given in Figure 4.3. The 
typical radiation pattern of the antenna in Tx/Rx bands are shown in Figures 4.4 
and 4.5, which show scanned beam in the E-plane for both bands.
The isolation between the upper and lower bands was measured as well and 
the result is shown in Figure 4.6, which demonstrates better than 45-dB isolation 
between the two bands. This high level of isolation between the two feeds relaxes 
the filtering specifications between the two operating bands quite significantly.

4.1  Multiband Reflectarray  
65
The design in Figure 4.1 was the first step of an exploratory study to design 
a Ka-band Tx/Rx reflectarray with active feeds for both bands. The feed block 
was composed of a cavity-backed microstrip with an LNA for the Rx band and 
an array of four patches along with power amplifiers for the Tx band as shown in 
Figure 4.7. Also shown in the same figure is the whole reflectarray structure along 
with the active feed block. The reflectarray was designed to divert its main beam to

elements. The structure is an infinite periodic structure of patches printed on grounded dielectric 
substrate of εr = 2.2 and substrate thickness = 0.020 inch. The lattice size was set to 0.5 cm × 0.5 
cm for both the lower-band and upper-band cell elements and widths of the cell elements were set 
to 0.7 mm and 0.3 cm for the lower-band and upper-band elements, respectively.  (© 2000  IEEE.

θ = 26° to avoid blockage by the feed block and it was used to establish closed link 
to NASA Advanced Communication Satellite Technology (ACTS). Spatial separa­
tion between the Tx and Rx feed blocks reduced the filter requirements at the Rx 
side significantly. Further isolation between the two can be achieved by increasing 
their spatial separations.

4.1.2  Dual-Band, Double-Layer Reflectarray with Stacked Elements
Stacked elements can be used rather than single-layer interlaced elements to achieve 
dual-band reflectarray performance. For the interlaced case, the choice of elements 
is restricted to geometries that can be embedded within a lattice structure, whereas 
this restriction is significantly alleviated for stacked elements [5].
The lower-band elements of a reflectarray with stacked elements are located on 
the top and higher-band elements are located on the bottom. Simulations should 
be carried out to ensure low cross coupling between the elements of the two bands; 
otherwise, the design process will become utterly complicated. Figure 4.8 shows 
a typical dual X/Ka-band reflectarray that was designed in NASA for deep-space 
telecommunication. Circular rings with gaps were used as the cell element for both 
bands. 
The reflectarray is fed by circular polarized (CP) feed and narrow gaps were 
implemented within the rings. It has been established that the phase of the reflected 
CP field can be adjusted by rotating the rings [9]. Specifically, rotation of the ring 
by angle ψ imparts a phase of 2ψ on the reflected CP wave of the same handedness

as the incoming CP field. The rings were intentionally made narrow to reduce their 
cross coupling. Typical radiation patterns of the reflectarray at its two operating 
bands are shown in Figure 4.9. 
Measurement results for radiation patterns with and without X-band elements 
are shown in Figure 4.9. Relatively similar performance was observed for both 
cases in terms of side-lobe level, cross-polarization, and beam pointing which dem­
onstrates relatively low coupling between the elements of the two bands. 
In a different development, stacked patch cell element was used to design a 
reflectarray with distinct focal points for Tx/Rx Ka-band. The reflectarray con­
figuration along with its cell are shown in Figure 4.10 Two different feeds are used 
for the V-polarization in the Tx band (30 GHz) and H-polarization in the Rx band 
(20 GHz) and orthogonal sides of the stacked patch cell elements were used to fo­

cus the given frequency band and polarization. Simulated and measured radiation 
patterns of the reflectarray within its operating bands are shown in Figure 4.11. 
4.1.3  FSS-Backed Reflectarray
The flexibility endowed by innovative manipulation of the ground plane of a reflec­
tarray has been largely neglected thus far. For instance, replacement of the ground 
plane with a frequency selective surface (FSS) that is reflective in the operating band 
of the reflectarray and transparent outside the same can provide a viable alternative 
for multiband/multipolarization operation [6–8]. Figure 4.12 shows two different 
implementations of FSS-backed reflectarrays.
In the first implementation that is shown in Figure 4.12(a), multiple FSS-backed 
reflectarrays are fed by separate feeds and cascaded to obtain multiband operation. 
Observing from the feed side, the reflectarray with higher operating band should

precede the ones with lower operating band [6]. A reverse sequence in the place­
ment of the reflectarrays might result in excitation of grating lobes at the higher 
bands. The second implementation that involves placement of an FSS-backed re­
flectarray on a conventional parabolic reflector is shown Figure 4.12(b). This sec­
tion outlines the results for second implementation and more detailed information 
on the first implementation can be found in [7, 8]. 
The printed dipole was used as the cell element of both reflectarray and also 
FSS backing as shown in Figure 4.13. Reflected phase of the structure was cal­
culated for constant size of elements on the FSS while the size of the elements on 
reflectarray side were changing and results are shown in Figure 4.14. It should be

noted that both phase and amplitude have to be calculated in the design process as 
opposed to conventional reflectarray design that the focus is on the reflected phase 
response. Again, seemingly reverse orientation of the phase-length curve is caused 
by using e−jωt time dependence in the calculations. 
A hybrid reflector-reflectarray structure is depicted in Figure 4.15. A foam 
housing was used to secure the relative location of the FSS-backed reflectarray 
with respect to the conventional solid offset-fed parabolic reflector. The operating 
frequency band of the reflector and reflectarray are the Ku-band and the Ka-band, 
respectively. The measured insertion loss of the FSS-backed reflectarray in the Ku-
band was less 1.0 dB.

Different Types of Reflectarrays
The radiation pattern of the whole assembly was measured in anechoic an­
tenna chamber across its two operating bands and the results are shown in Figure 
4.16. It is to be noted that the hybrid antenna maintains different beam pointing 
angles for its two operating bands, which shows the advantage of this hybrid struc­
ture with respect to a conventional reflector structure. Also, different positions for 
the operating bands focal points simplified feed structure significantly. 
4.2  Circularly Polarized Reflectarrays 
Two different methods have been introduced for the design of a circularly polar­
ized (CP) reflectarray. In the first method, a CP feed illuminates the reflectarray 
comprised of elements that exhibit 180° phase difference in terms of their reflected

phase response to the two orthogonal linear polarizations [9]. It was proven in [9] 
that rotation of such elements by ψ leads to 2ψ phase shift in the reflected phase 
when two-dimensional infinite lattice is illuminated by CP wave. The condition 
of 180° phase difference between the two orthogonal linear polarizations can be 
maintained by using dual stub-loaded patch cell element as shown in Figure 4.17.

0.2 cm, and lattice dimension is 0.6 × 0.6 cm, and f = 27.6 GHz. (© 2005 IEE. From: [6]. Reprinted

��������������������������������
Different Types of Reflectarrays
The radiation pattern and efficiency of a reflectarray that was designed based on 
this principle are shown in Figure 4.18. 
A split square loop cell element is also introduced in [10] to generate CP at X-
band using CP feed. In this method which is depicted in Figure 4.19, the position of 
slots along the perimeter of the square loop is moved instead of rotating the whole 
element as discussed before. It is observed that when the slot position is moved 
along the perimeter of the square loop, the resonant frequency of the structure will 
shift due to the corner effect. To maintain the same operating frequency, the slot 
width needs to be adjusted. Furthermore, it is important to point out that as shown 
in Figure 4.20 the phase variation is no longer a linear function of the rotation 
angle as the conventional method.
A second strand in the design of CP reflectarrays is to synthesize elements that 
simultaneously transform incoming linear polarization (LP) to CP and also col­
limate the beam [11]. The mechanism of LP to CP transformation is described in 
Figure 4.21. The incoming linearly polarized wave is aligned at 45° with respect 
to the two arms of the cross dipole and hence decomposed equally into compon­
ents parallel to the arms. The lengths of the vertical arms have been adjusted to 
impart 90° phase difference between the two orthogonal vector components of the 
reflected wave which is equivalent to excitation of a CP wave, the handedness of 
which depends on phase lead or lag relationship between the phases of these two 
vector components. The same principle can be applied to any element with differ­
ent phase response with respect to the two orthogonal linear polarizations. How­
ever, the amount of the phase shift can be adjusted to obtain beam collimation as 
well. Figure 4.22 shows a dual-band 20/30 GHz CP reflectarray with opposite CP 
handedness for the two bands. The reflectarray utilizes interlaced cross dipoles for 
the both operating bands.

4.2  Circularly Polarized Reflectarrays  
75
Coupling between cross arms at each given band and also between elements at 
the upper and lower bands were extensively studied. Such an analysis is required 
for the design of any dual band reflectarray to guaranty fulfillment of design speci­
fications. To estimate the effect of the lower-band elements on the higher-band 
dipoles, the phase versus length curve of the higher-band dipoles was calculated,

while the lengths of the lower-band dipoles were kept constant. The same proce­
dure was repeated for lower-band elements to estimate the effect of the higher-band 
elements on the lower-band operation. The structure was illuminated by a y-polar­
ized normal incident plane wave. The unit cell that was used in the simulations is 
shown in Figure 4.23. The coupling between the cross dipoles of the two different 
bands are shown in Figures 4.24 and 4.25. 
Using these concepts and design guidelines that were described in the preced­
ing sections, a 45.0 cm × 45.0 cm dual-band CP single-layer reflectarray with F/D 
= 0.5, as shown in Figure 4.26, was designed and fabricated. The feeds of the two 
bands were set 5.0 cm apart from each other. The antenna was tested in the planar 
near-field facilities and the results are shown in Figure 4.27. Also, the gain and the 
axial ratio performance of the reflectarray are listed in Table 4.1 for single frequen­
cies in the lower and upper bands. Aperture efficiency close to 34% was achieved 
for both the upper and lower bands and the axial ratio is less than 1.5 dB for the 
design frequencies.

4.3  Folded Reflectarray
The attempt to reduce volumetric constraints has led to the design of folded re­
flectarray structure [12]. This type of reflectarray utilizes multiple reflections of the 
rays that emanate from the feed along with polarization rotation to increase their 
optical paths before launching them into the free space. Figure 4.28 shows a view 
of the folded reflectarray and the path traversed by a typical ray. As indicated, the 
path of the ray with a given linear polarization starts at the feed and then reflected 
by the top surface that reflects only a given sense of polarization. Upon reflection 
from the top reflector, the ray meets the bottom surface that acts simultaneously

as a polarizer and also imparts the necessary phase shift onto that same ray to 
achieve a collimated beam in a given direction. The upper surface is a polarization 
filter comprised of strip of conductor which reflects the E-field with polarization 
parallel to the strips and is transparent to the E-field that is normal to the strip. The

bottom reflectarray is composed of dipoles that are at 45° orientation with respect 
to the polarization of the wave that is reflected by the upper polarization filter. 
As described in Figure 4.28, the size of the dipoles is adjusted to rotate the E-field 
polarization by 90° and also provide the required phase shift for collimated beam.
The bottom surface of a typical folded reflectarray has been shown in Figure 
4.29. The antenna was designed to operate in the V-band and the size of the anten­
na is 100 mm with F/D = 0.5. The measured 1-dB gain bandwidth of the antenna is 
about 6%. The measured radiation pattern of the antenna is shown in Figure 4.30.
Different versions of the folded reflectarray have been reported in the literature 
to obtain beam shaping and beam scanning [13]. In a novel implementation of this 
same concept, the top surface has been replaced by a reflectarray backed by a po­
larizer to provide both amplitude and phase control for beam shaping [13].

4.4  Power Combining and Beam Splitting
The structure of reflectarray is amenable to integration of active elements within 
the unit cell of the reflectarray or realization of phase front transformations that 
lead to novel application such as power combining and beam splitting. Power com­
bining at higher millimeter-wave band is a measure to avoid the complexity of the 
design and operation of high-power amplifier. Figure 4.31 shows the cell element 
that is composed of a microstrip backed by orthogonal slots and used in [14] for the 
integration of amplifier within the cell element of the reflectarray. The microstrip 
captures a given polarization that is coupled into a given slot and passed through 
the microstrip line while being amplified by the amplifier. The amplified signal is 
coupled to the other slot and radiated by the microstrip in a polarization that is 
orthogonal to the incoming signal. This provides a degree of isolation between the 
input and output, which reduces the possibility of unwanted oscillation. The length 
of the microstrip line that connects the two slots is adjusted to achieve the desired 
phase front transformation. 
Power combining can also be addressed at the feed level by using multiple feeds 
and adjusting reflectarray elements to achieve the phase shift required to combine 
the power of the multiple feeds. Figure 4.32 shows a reflectarray that is designed 
to combine the power of two feeds at f = 30 GHz [15]. The measurements demon­
strated 33% radiation efficiency for the structure.

4.5  Subreflectarray Structures
Utilization of reflectarray technology in the context multiple reflector structures is 
a natural extension of earlier work on single reflectarray structures. Subreflectarray 
provides an appealing possibility for integration of active elements for beam shap­
ing [16] and phase error correction on the main reflector [17].

Different Types of Reflectarrays
The implementation of the subreflectarray in Cassegrain and Gregorian con­
figurations involves the transformation of a given spherical wave that is generated 
by a feed located at one of the focal points of the subreflectarray into another 
spherical wave that emanates from the other focal point of the subreflectarray as 
depicted in Figure 4.33 for ellipsoidal or hyperboloid subreflectarray [18].
Noting the parameters that are defined in Figure 4.33, the required phase for 
the nth element on the ellipsoidal subreflectarray can be calculated from the fol­
lowing equation:

where k is free-space wavenumber in the above two equations and p is an integer. 
The geometrical parameters are defined in Figure 4.33. The similarity of these equa­
tions to similar equations to conventional subreflectors is quite interesting. 
An ellipsoidal subreflectarray was designed based on (4.1) and fabricated and 
subsequently tested. The layout of the subreflectarray is shown in Figure 4.34. The 
size of the subreflectarray was 155 mm × 155 mm and the foci of the structure were 
FR = 155 mm and FV = 61 mm. The subreflectarray was etched on 0.020-inch-thick 
substrate with εr = 3.0. Both radiation pattern magnitude and phase were measured 
in anechoic far-field chamber. The phase pattern was initially measured with re­
spect to a point at the center of the subreflectarray and then the phase center was 
shifted to the location of the other focal point of the ellipsoid through postprocess­
ing of the measured phase data. Figure 4.35 shows HFSS simulation and measure­
ment results for magnitude and phase of the subreflectarray structure. 
Blockage was not accounted in the calculations which accounts for disagree­
ment between simulated and measured results around boresight direction. It is ob­
served that the reflectarray has managed to create a rather spherical phase front up 
to about 40°.

4.6  Beam Shaping
Conventional solid reflectors are shaped in order to obtain a shaped beam [19]. 
As in the case of conventional solid reflectors, two different methods can be used 
for beam shaping in a reflectarray. One can either synthesize the main reflectar­
ray to realize the specified phase front transformation [20, 21] or synthesize the 
subreflectarray of a dual reflector configuration to achieve the same [16, 22]. The 
subreflectarray approach is more advantageous when it comes to integration of 
Figure 4.32   (a) Configuration of reflectarray with multiple feed, (b) top view of the reflectarray composed

active elements for dynamic beam shaping because a much smaller number of active 
elements are required as compared to the main reflectarray with active elements. 
In both methods a given phase distribution over the reflectarray (whether main 
reflectarray or subreflectarray) is achieved by adjusting the cell elements. However, 
in the case of folded reflectarray, both phase and amplitude of the aperture field 
distributions can be optimized [13]. 
An early version of a shaped beam reflectarray was reported in [21] where the 
authors used microstrip patch as the cell element. The phase front transformation 
was projected onto the main reflectarray surface. Figure 4.36 shows the shaped

reflectarray surface that was etched on the Duroid substrate of εr = 2.2 and was 
0.062 inch thick. The cross section of the reflectarray was in the form of an ellipse 
with major and minor axes of 110.0 cm and 90 cm, respectively. It should be noted 
that the choice of microstrip patch as the element leads to a range of unattainable 
phase values that can lead to phase error. The shaped reflectarray was designed to 
illuminate continental Europe at 14.0 GHz with 5% bandwidth. The surface of 
shaped-beam reflector was first synthesized using TICRA [23] and it was then used 
to synthesize the required phase transformation on the face of the reflectarray. The 
reflectarray was fed by a corrugated horn. The antenna was designed for f = 14.15

GHz as the center frequency and the measured coverage for three frequencies are 
shown in Figure 4.37. The measurement demonstrated that within 7% operating 
bandwidth, 99% of the coverage area receives a power in excess of 23 dB, which 
meets the system requirement. 
To further increase the bandwidth of the reflectarray, a three-layer stacked 
patch was used as the cell element. This type of element was discussed in Chapter 
3 and is shown in Figure 3.7. The nature of the elements leads to a more gradual 
slope for the phase plot of the structure and also the whole 360° phase range can 
be achieved. The antenna was designed for the center frequency of 11.95 GHz for 
South America and Florida coverage. The cross section of the reflectarray, which is 
shown in Figure 4.38, was near elliptical with major and minor axis of 83.2 cm and 
80.6 cm, respectively. A phase-only technique was used to synthesize the reflect­
array. The simulated contour plot of the structure is given in Figure 4.39, which 
shows 10% operating bandwidth for the shaped beam reflectarray.
The other possibility for exploitation of reflectarray technology to achieve 
shaped beams is to use a shaped beam subreflectarray. Figure 4.40 shows the cross 
of a dual reflector system that is composed of a solid parabolic reflector and a 
shaped-beam subreflectarray. Double-stacked patch elements were used as the cell 
element of the subreflectarray. The diameter of the parabolic reflector was 1.5m 
and subreflectarray was a square of 56.1 cm × 56.1 cm. The required phase for 
South American shaped-beam coverage is shown in Figure 4.41. The calculated 
contour beam of the dual reflector configuration is shown in Figure 4.42. Although 
the structure does not completely fulfill the requirements, it can be considered as a 
good starting point for further optimization. 
Beam-shaping methods that have been outlined thus far pertain to phase-only 
beam shaping. A folded reflectarray structure can be used to optimize both ampli­
tude and phase of the aperture field distribution [13]. A side view of such a folded 
reflectarray is shown in Figure 4.43.

Different Types of Reflectarrays
A reflectarray that is backed by strips is implemented at the top layer. The top 
surface reflects the radiation from the feed into a given field distribution. Subse­
quently, the bottom reflectarray that is illuminated by the field with given ampli­
tude distribution imparts the required phase onto each ray to rotate its polarization 
by 90° and also provide the required phase distribution for the shaped beam. The 
polarization of the outgoing ray is orthogonal to the top layer strips and reflect­
array dipoles, which makes the top layer invisible to outgoing rays. Figure 4.44 
depicts the operation of the shaped-beam folded reflectarray. The horn has been 
placed at a null of field on the lower reflectarray to improve return loss perform­
ance. ������������������������������������������������������������������������
A 24° sector beam antenna with small beam width in the elevation was re­
alized at 58 GHz. The reflectarrays were 25 mm apart and the size of the lower 
reflectarray was 130 mm × 95 mm and it was etched on 5880 Duroid material of 
0.010-inch thickness and εr = 2.2. The measured three-dimensional radiation pat­
tern of the antenna is shown in Figure 4.45, which shows a sector beam with nar­
row beamwidth in elevation.

Numerical Methods: Pathway to a Better 
Understanding of Reflectarrays
As noted in previous chapters, each region of a quasi-periodic structure such as 
reflectarray antenna can be considered to be an infinite periodic structure illumi­
nated by a plane wave that is incident along the line that connects the feed and that 
specific region. Then numerical methods that have been developed for infinite peri­
odic structures can be utilized to calculate scattered field from that specific region. 
Total scattered field from a reflectarray is addition of the scattered fields from its 
constituent regions. The underlying assumption for the validity of this approach is 
smooth variation of the lattice structure to warrant its approximation as an infinite 
periodic structure. The objective of this chapter goes beyond the sheer presentation 
of numerical methods that have been used in the analysis of reflectarrays to draw 
useful physical insight from the application of such methods. 
The method of moment (MoM) has been widely used in the analysis of periodic 
structures. A summary of the intricacies of this method in the context of periodic 
structures will be presented. The planar grating reflector is also presented to em­
phasize that one is not restricted to a direct reflected (0, 0) Floquet mode in the 
realization of a reflectarray. Later on, different methods that have been applied to 
calculate radiation pattern of a reflectarray, knowing the MoM current distribu­
tions on the cell elements, will be presented. As will be seen, such an analysis can 
be exploited to calculate contribution of each of the constituent components of the 
reflectarray (cell elements, ground plane, and dielectric substrate) to the far-field 
radiation pattern. Then utilization of circuit methods in the design of reflectarray 
will be presented. Considerations on using commercial software in the analysis of 
reflectarrays will be presented through an example to estimate gain-bandwidth 
performance of a large reflectarray. Characteristic mode (CM) theory, which is a 
promising method with a lot of flexibility in the design of reflectarrays, will also 
be presented.

wave, k0 is the free-space wave number, and lattice sizes are denoted as Tx and Ty 
as shown in Figure 5.1. It can be seen from (5.1) that the whole scattered wave is a 
summation of a finite number of outgoing propagating waves and an infinite num­
ber of evanescent waves depending on the real or imaginary nature of zmn

 is of a known functional form with a support through the whole 
scatterer (entire domain) or a limited portion of the scatterer. For a list of possibili­
ties of the basic functions, the reader is referred to [2–4]. It is to be noted that the 
entire domain basic functions should reflect the modal currents of the scatterer. For 
instance, one can use sinusoidal entire domain basis functions to express the cur­
rent distribution on a periodic arrangement of dipoles that are illuminated by plane 
wave [2].  
It is important to note that (5.1) gives only a scattered wave from the cell ele­
ments and it does not include scattering (reflection) from the substrate and ground 
plane structure. Also, the cell size of a conventional reflectarray is small enough to 
exclude the excitation of higher-order modes other than the direct reflection (0, 0) 
order Floquet mode. The total direct reflection from the periodic structure can be

the incident field is preserved. In other words, a TE(TM) incident field gives rise to 
a TE(TM) field. In the absence of excessive depolarization effects from the cell ele­
ment of the reflectarray (which is usually the case for conventional geometries such 
as patches and loops), the most important design parameter is the phase response, 
φT, the determination of which is the basis of the reflectarray design. The starting 
point of the reflectarray design is calculation of the reflected phase as a function of 
a geometrical parameter of the cell element. A variety of phase versus geometrical 
feature size curves were presented in Chapter 4 for different types of cell elements. 
The above analysis can be used for the design and operation of a reflectarray 
based on direct reflection. Therefore, the lattice size should be held close to half a 
wavelength or less to prevent the excitation of higher-order modes. However, the 
quasi-periodic nature of reflectarray gives rise to other possibilities in terms of the 
choice of the propagating mode by the appropriate choice of the lattice parameters. 
The concept of blazed grating is particularly useful in such a development [5]. The 
next higher-order mode of a periodic structure is (0, -1) Floquet mode. For a peri­

The lattice parameters have been shown in Figure 5.2 and θ and φ define the 
direction of the propagation of the incident wave. Equations (5.7) and (5.8) are 
independent of D2. The other lattice parameters can be set to obtain a specific di­
rection of propagation for (0, -1) mode. The grating reflector surface is assumed 
to be composed of regions of periodic structures illuminated by a plane wave that 
is propagating along the line that connects the feed point to the center of that par­
ticular region and then the local lattice parameters are determined to excite (0, -1) 
mode along a given direction. Assuming the desired outgoing field direction to be 
(θ0,-1, φ0,-1)=(Ψ0, 180°), the last two equations can be rewritten as follows [6]:

The lattice parameters (D1, α1, α2) are determined to excite (0, -1) mode along 
a specified direction. For a detailed overview of design procedure, the reader is 
referred to [6]. Once the lattice is knitted together to ensure excitation of higher-or­
der mode along a given direction, the size of the dipole and the substrate thickness 
are optimized to ensure high coupling of incident field into the desired higher-order 
mode. Modal efficiency of a typical grating reflector is shown in Figure 5.3. One 
salient feature of grating reflector is frequency scanned beam as a result of the de­
pendence of diffraction angle of the higher-order mode on the operating frequency, 
as can be seen from (5.10) and (5.11).
Numerical methods based on the finite-difference time domain (FDTD) have 
also been used for the analysis of the cell element of reflectarray in an infinite pe­
riodic medium [7]. However, because the method in its conventional form cannot 
handle the coupling between elements in infinite periodic structure, it has been 
applied to cell elements that have been located within a waveguide that minimizes 
interelement coupling [7]. Generally, spectral-domain methods handle a wider class 
of cell elements and also provide insightful information on the operation of reflec­
tarray in the context of discrete set of scattered Floquet modes.

Numerical Methods: Pathway to a Better Understanding of Reflectarrays
5.2  Application of Circuit Models in the Analysis of Reflectarray Cell 
Element
The concept of equivalent circuit has been widely used in EM analysis with the aim 
of speeding up calculations by replacing the lengthy full-wave simulation with the 
analysis of equivalent circuit. The equivalent circuit of a cell element is based on the 
physical understanding of that particular cell element. Therefore, the applicability 
of method is restricted to that particular cell element. A different frequency band, 
lattice configuration, and/or polarization of excitation might require a different 
equivalent circuit to capture the operation of cell element. The reader is henceforth 
cautioned to comply with the restrictions of applying the equivalent circuit and also 
conclusions that can be drawn from such a model.
The equivalent circuit method was used in [8] to obtain design curves for patch 
and square loop that were arranged in a subwavelength square lattice. The cell ele­
ments along with their equivalent circuits are shown in Figure 5.4. The equivalent 
circuits were based on the common knowledge that the edges normal to the polar­
ization of the incident E-field tend to create a capacitive effect, whereas conduc­
tors parallel to E-polarization have an inductive effect. The extent of capacitive/
inductive effect depends on the separation between adjacent edges, lattice size, and 
conductor width. Detailed formulas can be found in [8, 9]. Figure 5.5 shows a 
comparison between the circuit method and full-wave analysis for patch and loop 
element within the subwavelength lattice. Therefore, rather than relying on lengthy 
full-wave simulations to calculate the phase design curves of reflectarray, a quick 
circuit analysis is sufficient to provide the designer with the same piece information.

5.2  Application of Circuit Models in the Analysis of Reflectarray Cell Element 
101
It is common to integrate active elements into the cell element of the reflectar­
ray to achieve switched-beam and beam-steering capabilities. One example of such 
a development is shown in Figure 5.6 where MEM switches were embedded within 
the cell element to change phase response of the cell element through a combina­
tion of the states of switches [10]. The redundancy in achieving a given phase

using different combinations of the states of switches is used to mitigate frequency 
dispersion of the reflectarray. It is very cumbersome to run the full-wave simula­
tion for all combinations of the states of MEM switches. The whole cell element 
is simulated as an N-port structure where the first port is set as the surface of the 
cell element that is excited by the incident plane wave and the openings on the cell 
element, where the switches were placed, were treated as the rest N − 1 ports as 
shown in Figure 5.7 [11]. A single full-wave simulation was run to obtain scatter­
ing parameters of the cell in the absence of MEM switches. Knowing the equivalent 
circuits for ON/OFF states of MEM, it is a matter of circuit analysis to find the 
phase response of the cell elements for different states of MEM switches [10, 11].
5.3  Calculation of the Radiation Pattern of a Reflectarray
The most straightforward method to find the radiation pattern of a reflectarray is 
to use direct summation of the field radiated by each of the cell elements [12, 13]. 
In this method, the cell element currents are determined by resorting to infinite

able series capacitors. (© 2010 IEEE. From: [10]. Reprinted with permission.)

periodicity assumption subject to plane wave excitation and then the dyadic Green 
function is used to find the radiated field from a given cell element. Total radiated 
field along an arbitrary ˆu direction is summation of the radiated fields of cell ele­
ments [14]:

where F is the feed radiation pattern, A is the radiation pattern of the cell element, 
mr is location vector for the mth cell element, 0ˆu  is the desired direction of the beam, 
and αm is the phase shift imparted by that same element. The shortcoming of this 
method is the assumption of infinite ground plane in the calculation of the radiated 
field from each given cell element. Therefore, a second method was suggested in 
[15] to overcome this shortcoming. In this method, the reflected field on each cell is 
calculated based on the same assumptions that were used in the first method. Then 
the total radiated field is obtained by calculating equivalent electric and magnetic 
current distributions right above the surface of reflectarray using the following 
expressions:

The free-space dyadic Green function can then be used to find the radiated 
field. The emergence of discontinuity on borders of adjacent cells is inherent to 
this method and leads to erroneous results in image beam direction of the feed. To 
smooth out these discontinuities, the spectral integral expressions can be used to 
find the field distribution on the reflectarray surface as the third method. Similar to 
the previous two methods, the current distributions is calculated based on periodic 
structure assumptions and then the following expression is used for spectral E-field 
on surface of reflectarray:

 represents the direction of propagation. Having calcu­
lated the field distribution on the surface of reflectarray, (5.13) and (5.14) can be 
used to find the equivalent currents. The field expressions in the third method are 
based on the continuous plane wave spectrum as opposed to fundamental Floquet 
space harmonics [15]. Figure 5.8 shows comparison of the calculated radiated us­
ing the above three methods and the measured radiation pattern. The second and 
third methods show a relatively good agreement with measurement. The full range 
of measured radiation pattern and calculated radiation pattern from the second 
and third methods are shown in Figure 5.9. The disagreement between the second 
method and measurement around θ = 145° pertains to direct reflection direction 
from the feed. 
It is instructive to use the current and field distribution on the constituent parts 
of the reflectarray (cell elements, ground plane, and dielectric substrate) to calculate 
contribution of each these elements to the total radiated field of a reflectarray [16]. 
Commercial HFSS [17] software has been used in [16] to find H-field distribution 
on the ground plane and right above and below substrate air interface of the reflec­
tarray that is illuminated by a given feed horn. Because the current distribution is

calculated current distribution. To investigate the contributions of the reflectarray 
components to its far-field pattern, a single-layer, center-fed reflectarray of rectan­
gular patches was designed and simulated at a center frequency of 30 GHz (λ0 = 10 
mm). Dielectric permittivity of εr = 3.0 and thickness h = 0.508 mm were selected 
for the substrate. The reflectarray size is 15.5λ0 × 15.5λ0 and the feed phase center 
is located at F = 15.5λ0 from its surface. The current distributions on patches and 
ground plane were calculated from the knowledge of simulated HFSS field and ap­
plication of (5.19) and the results are shown in Figure 5.11.
The symmetry of the reflectarray has been exploited to restrict the computa­
tional domain to a quarter of the reflectarray surface. The regions of the ground 
plane that are underneath resonant or near-resonant patches support strong cur­
rent almost equal to the amplitude of the current on those same patches. This ob­
servation tends to establish similarity between these patches and open resonators 
with upper patch and the underneath ground plane regions as their top and bottom 
conducting surfaces. It is to be noted that the regions of the ground plane that are 
highly exposed to the radiated field from the feed do not support strong current. 
Similarity of the order of current distribution on patches and ground plane, as 
shown in Figure 5.11, implies almost similar radiation patterns for these individual 
current components as shown in Figure 5.12. These radiation patterns suffer from 
high sidelobe level, which disappears after their complex addition. Figure 5.13 
shows a comparison of the complex addition of the radiation patterns of ground 
plane and patch elements with the total HFSS [17] calculated radiation pattern of 
the reflectarray. The discrepancy between the two radiation patterns represents 
contribution of substrate polarization current to the total radiation.

synthesis of full reflectarray structure. The best one could hope for is calculation of

phase response of the cell element with the assumption of infinite periodicity and 
then utilization of that same response to synthesize the reflectarray. 
There are a number of commercial full-wave electromagnetic software such as 
HFSS [17], CST [18], and EMCUBE [19] that can be used for the calculation of the 
phase response of the cell element. Generally, any software that can accommodate 
periodic boundary condition can be used for the calculation of the phase response 
of cell element. 
Although the phase response of the cell element is dependent on the angle of 
incidence of the incoming plane wave, it might still be acceptable to restrict the 
analysis to normal incidence. This statement is particularly valid for a dense peri­
odic structure with a lattice size below a half-wavelength. The periodic nature of 
the structure can be captured by appropriately surrounding the cell element with 
electric and magnetic walls. Pursuing this strategy broadens the range of software 
that can handle calculation of the phase response of cell element to closed-region 
full-wave software that accommodates electric and magnetic walls. However, it 
should be noted that the cell element should have double transverse symmetry 
to span the desire periodic structure by repeated replication through electric and 
magnetic walls of the waveguide simulator [11]. For instance, the waveguide simu­
lator shown in Figure 5.14(a) spans the infinite periodic structure composed of 
microstrip patches whereas it is easy to verify that the waveguide simulator of Fig­
ure 5.14(c) fails to span infinite periodic structure composed of open square rings 
shown in Figure 5.14(b). The multiple reflections of cell element with respect to 
waveguide walls give rise to the structure shown in Figure 5.14(d), which is differ­
ent from the structure in Figure 5.14(b). This restriction should be noted carefully 
when applying electric and magnetic walls to emulate normal incidence onto a 
periodic structure.
Having synthesized the reflectarray following the procedure that was outlined 
above, one can use electromagnetic tools with scattering computation capability to 
analyze the performance of the reflectarray. Obviously, the largest reflectarray size 
that can be handled by the software depends on available computational resources 
and also the complexity of the software. However, using the available commercial 
software intelligently, one can draw useful information on the performance of the 
reflectarray without simulating the whole structure. For instance, calculation of 
scattering from the center row of a center-fed or offset-fed reflectarray gives a good 
estimate of the operating bandwidth of the structure. One of the challenges in the 
design of reflectarray is estimation of gain bandwidth, which is usually hampered 
by the large size of the structure. It was suggested in [20] that scattering from single 
central row of the reflectarray provides a good estimate of the gain bandwidth 
performance. An offset-fed 1.2m × 1.2m Ku-band reflectarray with the radiated 
beam along the direct reflection ray from the feed was used in [20] to demonstrate 
this method. The single row of the reflectarray is highlighted in Figure 5.15. A 
single row of the reflectarray was imported into HFSS and PMC walls were placed 
around it to establish its periodicity. Then the single row was illuminated by a plane 
wave along the direction of the main beam of the original reflectarray and the field 
intensity at the focal point was calculated across the frequency band. The variation 
of the field intensity at the focal point, which is shown in Figure 5.16, provided an 
estimation of the gain bandwidth performance of the reflectarray.

5.5  The Infinite-from-Finite Method
The bulk of electromagnetic simulations involving infinite periodic structures make 
use of absorbing boundary conditions (FDTD and FEM) or periodicity of the gov­
erning Green function (MoM) to extract the desired properties of the infinite array. 
These approaches offer computationally efficient techniques from both the compu­
tation time and the computational resource (i.e., memory) perspectives. However,

5.5  The Infinite-from-Finite Method 
111
the enforcement of infinite periodicity suffers from two shortcomings: (1) the nu­
merical method must necessarily employ more complex coding over finite structural 
analysis (this is especially true in MoM implementations), and (2) the inability to 
assess the properties of finite arrays. 
One technique that can address these two issues is the infinite-from-finite (IFF) 
method [21]. The technique makes one mandatory assumption: all elements in a 
finite periodic structure are illuminated identically (i.e., an incident plane wave) 
and one optional assumption that all elements exhibit identical excitation currents. 
The assumption of identical excitation (perhaps allowing for phase differences to 
account for non-normal plane wave incidence) allows one to probe the properties 
of a finite array without needing to analyze the array in its entirety. If one does in­
deed assume identical excitation currents among all elements, the properties of the 
infinite periodic structure can be extracted using a numerical code that need only 
be capable of analyzing a finite structure, thus forgoing the need to develop new 
numerical codes. 
The IFF method begins by considering a finite periodic structure as shown in 
Figure 5.17. Assume that this periodic structure has M total elements. Any arbi­
trary moment method code would describe the entire structure using the imped­
ance matrix

 is the impedance operator for the infinite pe­
riodic structure. Note that this operator only becomes exact in the limit of M  ∞ 
where M is the number of periphery elements to include in the summation. Nev­
ertheless, one expects acceptable convergence for a finite number of iterations, as 
discussed further in [21]. 
Consider Figure 5.18(a) where a dogbone element is considered and Figure 
5.18(b), which shows the reflection magnitude of the periodic structure as a func­
tion of the number of rings of elements to include in the IFF method compared to 
the reflection magnitude obtained from a well-established commercial code. Note 
that an acceptable amount of convergence is obtained for five rings. Note that 
reflection coefficients can be obtained using the traditional method of exciting the 
structure and observing the scattered field, although a potentially superior tech­
nique is described next using modal techniques.

Characteristic modes (CMs) are a useful numerical analysis tool that determines a 
set of scattered field modes that yield mutually orthogonal far field patterns [23,

of [22]. CMs were used as a numerically efficient technique to extract important 
parameters such as transmission and reflection coefficients for periodic structures 
in [22]. Rather than applying an incident field, computing excitation currents and 
then determining the scattered field, one can alternatively rely on eigenvalue in­
formation alone to determine these parameters. The problem to be solved uses the 
impedance operator Z = R + jX cast in an eigenvalue problem (and readily obtained 
in any moment method formulation) as follows

It can be shown that the eigenvalues are significant electromagnetic quantities, 
representing the ratio of stored energy to radiated power. Consequently, one is then 
able to determine a host of important parameters from these eigenvalues. Of par­
ticular interest is the computation of the transmission and reflection coefficients of 
a free-space periodic structure using the following formulas [22]:

allowing us to state that a resonant mode (λn = 0) implies complete reflection while 
an anti-resonant mode (λn  ± ∞) implies complete transmission. Furthermore, if 
a ground plane is present, the transmission coefficient is zero and the reflection 
coefficient has unity magnitude, while the reflection phase can be obtained from

Coefficients
In the previous section, one was able to compute transmission and reflection coef­
ficients of periodic structures without having to neither excite with an incident field 
nor extract currents or scattered field; the computation was performed excitation-
free using the eigenvalue alone. However, eigenanalysis is a costly computational 
endeavor. Fortunately, it can be shown that the following operator identity exists 
for periodic structures that operate a single characteristic mode [22]:

These are advantageous expression for two main reasons:
1.	 They are computationally straightforward. No fields are computed, no cur­
rents are extracted, and the approach makes use of the computationally 
efficient trace. 
2.	 There is no need to select a reference plane and be concerned with measur­
ing the scattered field at a sufficient distance from the surface of the period­
ic structure. Phase values are referenced to the origin and are independent 
of excitation as no measurement is actually performed.

computed over a very wide frequency range from dc to 40 GHz using: (1) a com­
mercial code, (2) the traditional scattered field approach, and (3) the efficient trace

Reflectarray Bandwidth
6.1  Introduction
The most severe drawback in reflectarray antennas is their inherent narrowband 
performance, and much effort has been made in recent years to overcome this limi­
tation. There are two separate factors that play an important role in setting an 
upper bound on the bandwidth of a reflectarray antenna. The first is the narrow­
band of the radiating elements and the second is the differential spatial phase delay 
resulting from different paths lengths between the feed and each point on the wave 
front of the radiated beam. The first factor has a severe impact on the bandwidth of 
moderate size reflectarrays (<20λ) and F/D > 0.5, while the second factor becomes 
dominant in the case of large reflectarrays (>30l) and F/D > 0.5. However, as will 
be seen later, the second factor can adversely affect the bandwidth for F/D < 0.25 
even for a moderate size reflectarray. 
The required phase value that is to be imparted by the reflectarray element to 
achieve a specific phase front transformation can be obtained using the following 
equation:

 is the distance from the feed horn to the ith element, ir is the position 
vector of the ith element, and or represents the main beam direction as shown in 
Figure 6.1. A constant phase Ψ0 is added here at each frequency, indicating that it is 
the relative refection phase rather than the absolute refection phase that matters in 
reflectarray design. Without loss of generality, let us consider a reflectarray with a 
main beam at the broadside direction (ri, r0 = 0) and assume that Ψ0(f) = 0.

The phase difference between the normalized phase in (6.3) and the real phase 
generated by the reflectarray element (Φei(f)) is defined as error function. It is ob­
vious that this error function is zero at the design frequency f0.

It will be seen later that the above assumption is indeed correct for a large class 
of cell elements. It is clear from (6.5) that A(f0) = 1. Equations (6.4) and (6.5) can

Such an element is a true time delay (TTD) element that completely removes

This equation shows that for the element with infinite bandwidth the phase er­
ror has a direct relationship with the size of reflectarray (Ri-F), and for small and 
moderate size reflectarray as will be explained in next section, bandwidth of the 
element is the main factor of reducing reflectarray bandwidth. 
This chapter is focused on a more detailed presentation of the above factors 
that set an upper bound on the reflectarray bandwidth and also techniques to over­
come their adverse effect. ����������������������������������������������������������
Due to the flatness of the reflectarray structure, the fo­
cal point of a reflectarray is moved along a line as the frequency is shifted across 
the operating band. This phenomenon will also be discussed in this chapter for a 
broadband reflectarray. 
6.2  Bandwidth Limitation by the Reflectarray Element
The phase value that is to be imparted by the elements of reflectarray to achieve a 
specific phase front transformation can be obtained using (6.1). Figure 6.2 shows 
a plot of the required phase for a moderate size (16λ) Ku-band reflectarray at three 
different frequencies. A similar plot has been generated and shown in Figure 6.3 for 
a large size reflectarray (40λ) in the same frequency band and the same F/D as the 
moderate size reflectarray. For the case of moderate size reflectarray, the required 
phase is changed almost linearly as the frequency is swept across the band. This 
phase variation can be compensated by a broadband cell element because a linear 
phase variation with changing the frequency can be achieved using these cell ele­
ments. However, for large reflectarrays as shown in Figure 6.3, the required phase 
is not changed linearly across the band and the broadband cell element cannot com­
pensate this phase variation and the gain drops due to this phase error for the large 
size reflectarrays. Elements with linear phase response are usually used to improve 

122 
����������������������
Reflectarray Bandwidth
the element bandwidth. Utilization of thick substrates for single-layer reflectarray 
composed of patches is one of the techniques that were used in the early days of 
reflectarray research to improve the bandwidth. However, reduced attainable phase 
shift for such structures was synonymous to reduced gain [2]. Inspired by earlier 
research in the field of wideband microstrip patch, stacked patch was later sug­
gested as the reflectarray cell element to achieve wideband operation [3]. This latter 
technology suffers from complexity in fabrication and reduced flexibility for mul­
tiband or multipolarization application. Recently, single-layer multiresonance ele­
ments were introduced to enhance reflectarray bandwidth. Different cell elements 
such as patch loaded with slot [4], windmill elements [5], and multidipole [6] were

introduced in the literature. In this section, the research on realization of broadband 
reflectarray in the context of ring type cell elements is presented. The underlying 
physics behind this choice is described in the next section. Different types of ring 
type cell elements, namely, square ring type, cross ring type, and hybrid square and 
cross-ring cell elements were studied. As will be seen in the case of multiloop struc­
tures, the same multiresonance effect that is the basis of stacked patch design [7] is 
exploited to obtain the optimum phase response.
Recently, subwavelength elements were introduced as another viable alter­
native for broadband reflectarray. Subwavelength elements have dimensions and 
periodicity below the typical resonant half-wavelength interelement spacing.�����
 Sub­
wavelength rings are discussed in this section as a representative of such elements. 
6.3  Multiresonant Elements
Any attempt for broadening the bandwidth of the reflectarray should not solely rely 
on the common knowledge of the behavior of single element in isolation but should 
also exploit the rich literature on periodic structures [8]. Particular constraints and 
restrictions set on the broadband operation of such extensively studied periodic 
structures as frequency selective surfaces (FSS) are quite relevant and advantageous 
in the design of broadband reflectarrays. A prominent example of such an outlook 
is the class of cell elements known as loop elements in FSS nomenclature. The rela­
tively small resonant size of this class of cell elements allows for densely packed 
FSSs that are superior in bandwidth performance and stability of angular response.
The small size of the resonant element serves the twofold objective of exclusion 
of higher-order modes excitation and enhancement of the validity of the commonly 
used infinite periodic structure approximation that is applied in the design stage. A 
smaller reflectarray cell element is also more efficient in capturing sharp and abrupt 
phase reversals on the reflectarray. 
6.3.1  Square-Loop Cell Element
Single- and double-loop elements [9] were thoroughly discussed in Chapter 4 and 
it was demonstrated that each additional loop leads to an additional resonance 
and added range of attainable phase. The phase response of the element can be 
smoothed out by adjusting the coupling between multiloop elements as shown in 
Figure 3.11.
The wider attainable phase range and also smoother phase versus length char­
acteristics of the double loop cell element leads with wider operating bandwidth.
A reflectarray was fabricated at Ku-band using double ring cell element and 
tested in the far-field anechoic chamber [10]. The gain-frequency response for this 
particular antenna is shown Figure 6.4, which shows 14% bandwidth for 1-dB 
gain reduction. The reflectarray is offset-fed with 40 cm × 40 cm dimensions. To 
mitigate beam squint across the frequency band, the direction of the outgoing beam 
was set along the direction of the direct reflected ray with respect to the ray from 
the focal point to the center of the reflectarray [11]. The same practice was fol­
lowed in all offset reflectarrays in this section.

124 
����������������������
Reflectarray Bandwidth
6.3.2  Cross-Loop Cell Element
The cross-loop cell element as was introduced in Chapter 3 and shown in (3.13) is 
another variation of the class of loop elements that can achieve wideband operation.
As it was mentioned in Section 3.2 and Figure 3.14, a gradual variation of 
phase with respect to the loop length is a prerequisite for a wideband element. An 
offset-fed reflectarray composed of cross ring cell elements was designed, fabri­
cated, and tested at Ku-band. The reflectarray dimensions was set at 40 cm × 40 
cm. Gain versus frequency bandwidth of this reflectarray is shown in Figure 6.5, 
which shows a 16% bandwidth for 1-dB gain reduction. 
6.3.3  Hybrid Cell Element
Following an extensive set of simulations for square-ring and cross-loop cell ele­
ments, it was shown that the number of resonances is increased as more rings are 
added to the structure and these resonances can be decoupled from each other by 
maintaining a certain relationship between the sizes of concentric rings. Also, it is 
important to note that simultaneous resonance of the rings results in steeper phase 
characteristics within the coupling region. Therefore, the rings are ought to be de­
coupled in order to obtain more gradual variation of the phase with respect to the 
ring size. The gap between the rings needs to be adjusted to reduce the coupling 
between adjacent rings of the same cell element to achieve gradual phase versus ring 
size characteristic in all regions. These geometrical considerations led to the hybrid 
modified square (rectangular) and cross ring cell elements as the optimized element 
to achieve the necessary phase shift range and gradual phase-ring size variation 
[13]. The phase versus ring size plot of this optimized element based on cell element 
dimensions of [13] is shown in Figure 6.6. 
An offset-fed reflectarray composed of such elements was designed, fabricated, 
and tested. Measured gain versus frequency plot and the radiation pattern of the

antenna are shown in Figures 6.7 and 6.8. A measured 1-dB gain versus bandwidth 
of 24% was achieved using this novel cell element. The efficiency at the center fre­
quency was measured to be 60%.
6.4  Subwavelength Elements
Reflectarray cell elements are traditionally designed with lattice sizes around λ/2. 
It was shown recently that the bandwidth of reflectarray can be improved by using

substantially improve the bandwidth. It was shown in [14] that there is a direct 
relationship between reflectarray cell size and gain bandwidth of reflectarray lattice 
size. In this reference a reflectarray using array of 20 × 20 near-resonant patches on

using subwavelength patches with different cell sizes. The grid spacings and the 
number of elements are selected so that aperture area is the same for all four cases. 
Figure 3.32(a) in Chapter 3 showed the gain versus frequency for all four cases. It 
appears that gain bandwidth increases as the grid spacings become smaller (with a 
fixed aperture size).
Reflectarrays composed of subwavelength patch elements have been widely 
studied in the literature [15]. The minimum gap size between the patch elements is 
a critical factor in controlling the maximum achievable phasing range. 
It was shown in [16] that the phase variation of the reflected wave with fre­
quency is decreased by reducing the cell size of a subwavelength patch, which can 
improve the bandwidth of small and moderate size reflectarrays as shown in (6.12). 
While reducing the cell size can improve the bandwidth of the subwavelength re­
flectarray, it sets tight constraints on etching tolerance. Two-layer subwavelength 
patch elements have been suggested in [17] to achieve the desired phase range 
while maintaining reasonable etching tolerances nevertheless the higher fabrica­
tion complexity because of the additional layer of cell elements. Other subwave­
length elements such as loop and dogbone were introduced in Chapter 3, which can 
be used as reflectarray subwavelength element with smaller cell size as compared 
to subwavelength patch. These subwavelength elements are better candidates for 
broadband operation. Figure 6.9 shows the reflection phase dispersion which is de­
fined as the frequency derivative of the reflected phase (

) versus fre­
quency of a subwavelength loop for different cell sizes [18]. The phase dispersion 
decreased significantly by reducing the lattice size which confirms the observation 
in [16]. However, the subwavelength loop can still furnish the desired phase range 
of 300° with lattice size of λ/6.

Reflectarray Bandwidth
The measured gain versus frequency for a reflectarray with subwavelength loop 
element [19] was shown in Figure 3.35. A 1-dB gain bandwidth of nearly 19% was 
measured for the reflectarray, which is the same as the simulated bandwidth of the 
double layer patch element with cell size of λ/3 reported in [17].
6.5  Bandwidth Limitation by Differential Spatial Phase Delay 
The bandwidth limitation due to differential spatial phase delay resulting from¹ 
different path lengths for the rays emanating from the feed to each reflectarray 
element is the most restrictive factor in bandwidth performance of large-sized re­
flectarrays. The separation between the phase center of feed and each reflectarray 
element produces a different phase delay at each location, which is compensated 
with the reflected phase generated by reflectarray elements. This phase delay can 
be in a range of several multiples of 360° in given regions of a large reflectarray. 
The conventional technique of reflectarray design calls for adjustment of the ele­
ments to compensate the phase delay at the center frequency without taking into 
account the dispersion phase value (∆Φ/∆f), which is the variation of the required 
phase as the frequency is swept across the band. Because of the appreciable amount 
of frequency dispersion for a large reflectarray, and very limited capability of the 
element to compensate for the dispersion, the antenna bandwidth suffers signifi­
cantly. This pathological investigation into the causes of reduced bandwidth in the 
case of large reflectarray might lead the attentive reader to possible solutions to 
overcome this restriction. For instance, the reflectarray elements are ought to be 
selected from among a pool of elements that realize the required phase at the center 
frequency and at the same time are the best fit considering the phase requirements 
at the edge frequencies. In other words, the cell element at a particular location on 
the reflectarray has a twofold function of realizing the desired phase to attain the 
phase transformation at the center frequency and edge frequencies. Having differ­
ent phase requirements at these frequencies would force the designer to select from 
among a pool of elements [20, 21]. The following relationship is used as the error 
function to choose from among a pool of elements:

where l, c, u refer to lower, center, and upper frequencies, m, n refers to element 
indices on the reflectarray grid, and Φ is the phase shift. This error function can be 
used as the objective function in an optimization routine to be presented in next 
section to design moderate and large size reflectarrays.
The issue of frequency dispersion in the case of the large reflectarray can be 
understood from a different perspective. Figure 6.10 shows the phase difference 
between the phase of the elements at the center and the rim of the reflectarray when 
there is no restriction on the amount of phase that can be realized by the elements. 
In other words, the elements are capable of realizing phase values in excess of 360°. 
Wavelength is the yardstick that is to be used in the quantification of the desired 
phase. The physical size of this yardstick changes as the frequency is swept across

the band, which demonstrates the frequency dispersion. This is equivalent to dif­
ferent phase constraints at different frequencies in order to realize the same phase 
transformation. Now, if a mechanism can be contrived to account for the time 
delay of the signal as it travels from the feed to different points on the reflectarray, 
the bandwidth can be increased significantly. 
As was shown in (6.13), the ideal solution to have infinite bandwidth is to 
use element with true time delay (TTD) capability. Figure 6.11 shows slot coupled 
time delay lines that have been introduced in [22] as a TTD measure to improve 
bandwidth. The phase response can be very linear if a proper adjustment of the 
geometry is performed to alleviate the effects produced by multiple resonances. 
Depending on the phase values required at the reflectarray elements, the phase-
shifter is chosen with a simple L1 line segment or with a U-shaped TTD line. The 
phase and amplitude of the reflection coefficient for this type of element is shown

phase that can be attained from the cell element.

in Figure 6.12. The phase variation covers 3 × 360° phase range required for the 
phase-delay distribution and it is compared with an ideal delay line, in which the 
phase should be -2βL, where β is the propagation constant at the corresponding 
frequency and L is the length of the delay line. 
A reflectarray using this element is designed and fabricated at X-band and a 
gain bandwidth of 26% (1.5-dB gain drop) was measured for this reflectarray [22]. 
6.5.1  Verification of the Optimization Method 
The differential spatial phase delay is the main reason of bandwidth limitation of 
large reflectarrays. The idea of optimization as was mentioned in the previous sec­
tion is to select the reflectarray elements from among a pool of elements that realize 
the required phase at the center frequency and at the same time are the best fit con­
sidering the phase requirements at the edge frequencies. A method was introduced 
in [20] to overcome the bandwidth limitation of large reflectarrays by using an opti­
mization routine to adjust all the dimensions of a three-layer printed reflectarray to 
compensate for the frequency dispersion, but using a multilayer configuration leads 
to other shortcomings such as additional fabrication complexity, increased weight, 
and higher loss. The optimization technique introduced in this section is based on a 
single-layer structure and different classes of multicross loop elements were utilized 
in this optimization [23, 24].
For an offset-fed reflectarray that is shown in Figure 6.13 (for simplification, 
only the one-dimensional problem was addressed here and the figure shows the 
cross section of the reflectarray and feed in the xoz plane), the phase value that is 
to be imparted by the elements of the reflectarray to transform the spherical phase 
front of the feed to plane wave at θb can be calculated from the following equation:

the z-axis, Rn is distance from the feed to the nth element, and f and c represent the 
operating frequency and the speed of light, respectively. 
This phase can be normalized to the minimum phase, (Φmin(f)) (global mini­
mum of the required phase shift throughout the reflectarray), for each frequency 
to impose 0° global minimum phase shift for the phase templates at all optimized 
frequencies. An arbitrary phase (Φref(f)) can be added as shown in (6.15) to satisfy 
the dispersion frequency constraint as described here:

Φref is selected in a way to meet ∆Φn-norm/∆f ≤ 0 constraint for all the reflectar­
ray elements (physical restriction). The parameter Φref(f) is adjusted to get zero 
frequency dispersion for the elements at the reflectarray edge while maintaining 
negative frequency dispersion for the rest of elements. This guarantees negative 
(or zero) frequency dispersion for all the other reflectarray elements to make the 
structure physically realizable by appropriate choice of cell elements. As pointed 
out, negative frequency dispersion condition is a universal condition that is to be 
met regardless of the type of element that is used. For a simple case of a broadside, 
center-fed reflectarray (θb = 0), the maximum ∆Φref/∆f can be calculated according 
to the following equation:

where Φref is calculated for the center element, Rmax is the distance from the feed to 
the edge of reflectarray, and F is reflectarray focal length. This equation was calcu­
lated by assuming ∆Φn-norm/∆f = 0 for the element at the edge (Rn = Rmax) and Φmin 
= 2πfF/c in (6.15).

Figures 6.14 and 6.15 show the required phase on a row/column passing 
through the center of a center-fed reflectarray for the center frequency and extreme 
frequencies of a Ku-band 1.2-m reflectarray. These phases were calculated for two 
different ∆Φref/∆f values. The desired phase in Figure 6.14 is calculated based on 
(6.14) to get ∆Φn-norm/∆f = 0 for the elements at the edge of reflectarray. In Figure 
6.15 to get ∆Φref/∆f is not assigned correctly and it is slightly smaller than the one 
calculated in Figure 6.14, therefore the ∆Φn-norm/∆f > 0 for some elements at the 
edge, which cannot be compensated by any choice of reflectarray cell element. The 
phase of center element at center frequency was set to Φ0 = 0° but it can be treated 
as design parameter to obtain a better convergence and less error as a result of 
frequency dispersion. 
Different classes of double-cross loop elements with variable length (see Figure 
6.16) were used for designing the reflectarray. Different loop elements were defined 
by changing the line width (di), loops separation (g1), and cross width (w) (see 
Table 6.1). These sets of loops form the search space for the selection of the ele­
ments according to the criteria outlined in the previous section.
In practice, the error function introduced in (6.13) is tested with all elements 
within the search space and the element with the lowest error function is selected as 
the optimum element from the point of view of bandwidth performance. This same 
procedure was repeated for all the elements to get minimum frequency dispersion 
for all reflectarray elements. In other words, from among all the members of the 
search space that provide a given phase at the center frequency, the one that mini­
mizes the objective function is chosen as the optimum element. Figure 6.17 shows 
the phase of reflected wave versus loop length (L) for the double-cross loop element 
when d1 = d2 = g1 for different cross widths (w). Changing the parameters of the 
cell element generates different slope values. 
The optimization technique was used to design a 1.2-m offset-fed reflectarray 
for a frequency band of 11.4 GHz–12.8 GHz. As noted before the value of ∆ref/∆f 
for the center element is selected in such a way that ∆Φ/f = 0 for the edge elements

and ∆Φ/∆f < 0 for the rest of the elements. Reflectarrays were designed when the 
selection pool is composed of a single type of element or 66 types of elements (see 
Table 6.1). Radiation patterns were calculated for each case using array theory and 
results are shown in Figure 6.18. Comparison between Figures 6.18(a) and 6.18(b) 
demonstrates significant improvements of radiation pattern characteristics as the 
selection pool is enlarged.

in the design of the reflectarray when 66 different cross-loop configurations, as

tabulated in Table 6.1, were used in the optimization. It is evident in this figure that 
element numbers 16, 41, and 66 were used the most in this design. These curves 
have same line width (di) and gap (g1) with cross widths of 3.5 mm, 4 mm, and 4.5 
mm, respectively. Inspection of the phase versus cross loop length of these elements 
reveals their broadband nature. 
This reflectarray was designed and fabricated [24] and the measured H-plane 
radiation pattern for the design and edges frequencies is shown in Figure 6.20. The 
pattern is quite stable for all these frequencies and gain drops less than 1 dB and 
sidelobe level stays below −20 dB within the frequency band. The measured gain 
bandwidth is better than 12% for this antenna, which shows a significant improve­
ment as compared to conventional single-layer reflectarrays with same size.

Whereas the physical shape of reflector antenna is modeled by adjusting the fre­
quency-dependent phase of elements in the case of its reflectarray counterpart, there 
is a focal point shift as the frequency is swept within the operating band of reflec­
tarray. In this section, a study is undertaken to investigate the effect of changing 
feed location (the distance from horn aperture to the reflectarray center) on the 
bandwidth performance of reflectarray [26, 27]. An offset-fed reflectarray as shown 
in Figure 6.21 with D = 160 mm and F/D = 1 is used in this study. The reflectarray 
is designed at center frequency of f = 30 GHz with a main beam at broadside

To derive an approximate expression for the focal shift with frequency that we 
recognize, with reference to Figure 6.22, the boundary of the first Fresnel zone is 
defined by the following equation [25]:

It is evident that the focal point moves to keep the Fresnel zones boundary 
intact as the frequency is swept across the band. That means the values of xoff and 
xfz are fixed for a given reflectarray. Implicit differentiation of (6.17) with respect 
to frequency f allows us to write the focal point shift (∆F) from its center-frequency 
value, along Line #1 shown in Figure 6.21, for a shift (∆f) in the operating fre­
quency from the center frequency:

where P1P3 is the distance from focal point to the boundary of the first Fresnel 
zone at center frequency. It is assumed that the reflectarray elements have elements 
with infinite bandwidth in this expression so the reflected phase shift by elements is 
constant throughout the frequency band. 
The method that was described in Chapter 5 is utilized here to study this feed 
movement further and verify the accuracy of the above equation. The near-field 
intensity on predefined lines in HFSS is used to track the feed movement. An off­
set-fed 15-cm-square reflectarray with subwavelength patch elements designed at 
30 GHz is used in this study. The reflectarray is illuminated with a normal plane 
wave and near-field intensity was calculated on Line #1 in Figure 6.21 at different 
frequencies inside frequency band of 27 GHz to 33 GHz. As frequency is changed 
the maximum field value (the focal point), shifts vertically along Line #1 (normal 
to the reflectarray) as shown in Figure 6.23. In other words, the focal point moves 
towards (away from) the reflectarray surface as the frequency decreases below (in­
creases above) the center frequency of 30 GHz. Specific shifts along Line #1 are 
given in Table 6.2. The feed movement calculated using (6.18) is also shown in this 
Figure 6.22  Schematic top view of a reflectarray, with dashed lines indicating Fresnel zone bound­
aries. Point P1 is shown in Figure 6.21. (© 2012 IEEE. From: [27].)

table and there is a good agreement between the simulation results in HFSS and the 
results calculated using (6.18). 
Understanding of this feed movement can help us to change the frequency op­
eration of reflectarrays by moving the feed location along the line of the feed move­
ment without redesigning the reflectarray as long as the reflectarray elements are 
wideband enough to cover the whole frequency band.

Reflectarrays on Lossy Substrates
7.1  Introductory Remarks
Reflectarray antennas are versatile devices as they can be used in a myriad of ap­
plications with their patterns and functionality spanning a wide range of possible 
specifications. The most common use of reflectarrays, however, is the synthesis of 
pencil beam antenna patterns. An analog to this type of reflectarray is the solid 
parabolic reflector antenna [1]. Such solid reflectors can be mass-produced with 
low costs as evidenced by the pervasiveness nature of commercial satellite digital 
broadcast systems (DBS). Traditional reflectarrays are often designed using Teflon-
based and other low loss microwave substrates. The use of these substrates leads 
to high-aperture efficiency and gain commensurate with solid parabolic reflectors. 
However, low-loss substrates are often quite costly and thus preclude their competi­
tiveness with solid reflectors from the cost perspective. Naturally, reflectarray costs 
can be reduced through use of low-cost substrates (e.g., FR4), but such materials 
tend to have high loss tangents and hence will have reduced gain as compared to 
their solid reflector counterparts [2–5]. At present, it would seem that concessions 
must be made in the deployment of reflectarrays either through increased material 
costs or decreased electrical performance. In this chapter, we will show that this is 
not the case and that costs can be decreased while still maintaining excellent electri­
cal performance. In Section 7.2, we will explore the physical mechanisms that lead 
to reflectarray losses followed with a cataloging of reflectarray elements based on 
their loss performance in Section 7.3. In Section 7.4 we shall further investigate the 
use of subwavelength elements and the relationship between frequency dispersion 
of reflection phase and losses. Lastly, in Section 7.5 we will provide examples of 
high-gain reflectarray designs on lossy substrates with ample experimental mea­
surements to confirm that low-cost, high-performance reflectarrays can indeed be 
realized.
7.2  A Description of the Loss Mechanism in Reflectarray Elements
The loss mechanism in reflectarray elements has been explored previously in [2–5]. 
In all cases, the authors investigate the losses through the use of equivalent circuit

models. One important conclusion made in these prior inquiries is that dielectric 
losses are of paramount importance in describing losses, with metal losses (assum­
ing high-conductivity metals such as copper, silver, or gold) being nearly negligible 
in describing total loss when a lossy substrate is present. This is unsurprising, as 
conductors such as copper and silver are often assumed to be perfectly conducting 
at microwave frequencies with no detriment to the accuracy of the electromagnetic 
modeling. The losses in reflectarrays can be modeled quite simply using a paral­
lel RLC network, as shown in Figure 7.1, with the resistor R being responsible 
for the losses while the phase response is largely determined by the reactive LC 
components. A pole-zero analysis of the RLC circuit modeling square patch ele­
ments is performed in [4, 5], with the conclusion that the simplistic circuit model is 
capable of modeling low to moderate losses, while struggling to model very lossy 
structures. Losses were noted as quite significant, leading to substantial reduction 
in antenna gain if used in a pencil beam reflectarray configuration. It was noted, 
however, that thicker substrates leads to lowered losses with the immediately ap­
parent consequence of higher material costs, weight and profile, and a reduction in 
the achievable phase variability of the patch element. This behavior is confirmed 
and shown in Figure 7.2. 
A study of various elements was also performed in [2], where the authors com­
pared the loss performance of dipole, patch, and dogbone-shaped elements and 
concluded the dogbone element exhibited lower losses as compared to the other 
elements for the same substrate thickness. The metric used in this comparison was 
the Q of the element, leading to the conclusion that lower Q elements exhibit lower 
losses. This is in fact of benefit to reflectarray designs, since reflectarrays designed 
with low Q elements tend to be wideband structures.
7.3  Cataloging Elements Based on Loss Performance
7.3.1  Loss Performance of Narrowband Versus Wideband Elements
It is clear that we seek elements with low Q if we are to successfully use lossy sub­
strates in reflectarray designs. Elements such as resonant patches and dipoles are 
high Q elements and thus absorb an unacceptable amount (with regard to high-
aperture efficiency designs) of incident power. There is the temptation to select a 
wideband element, since wide bandwidth and low Q are often synonymous. How­
ever, one must be cautioned with this approach, because many wideband elements 
are not simple single-resonance structures and hence are not accurately modeled 
using a single RLC circuit for which Q is unambiguously defined. Consider the nar­
rowband patch element shown in Figure 7.3(a) and the wideband double cross-loop 
element in Figure 7.3(b). The reflection phase and magnitude versus element length

of these two elements is shown in Figures 7.4(a) and 7.4(b), respectively. Note that 
while the patch is quite lossy, the double cross loop is as well, despite being a wide­
band element. The peak loss of the patch is much higher than the double cross loop, 
but the double cross loop is lossy for nearly all element lengths. These scenarios are 
representative cases of concentrated loss compared to distributed loss. In the end,

substrate thicknesses. The reflectarray element considered is a square patch with variable dimensions 
residing in a 12-mm-square lattice, simulated at 12.5 GHz with an FR4 substrate with εr = 4.45 and 
tanδ = 0.016.

Reflectarrays on Lossy Substrates
a reflectarray designed using either element would result in unacceptable gain loss 
due to substrate power losses.
7.3.2  Loss Performance of Subwavelength, Coupled Resonant Elements
A class of reflectarray elements known as subwavelength, coupled resonant (SCR) 
elements provides an alternative means of reducing the losses in reflectarray designs. 
By reducing the lattice size below that of the traditional λ/2 spacing, the losses of the 
element tend to be reduced. This has been confirmed for various canonical elements 
including patches, loops, dogbones, and Jerusalem crosses [6, 7], although excep­
tions certainly exist. In particular, consider the reflection magnitude and phase as a 
function of element length for the square patch and loop, as shown in Figure 7.5. 
Both elements exhibit high reflection magnitudes, despite residing on a lossy FR4 
substrate. However, the patch element exhibits a narrower phase variability (260°) 
as compared to the loop (310°). Therefore, the subwavelength loop element offers 
advantages over the patch in this regard. It is possible for subwavelength patches 
to have wider phase range, but one must resort to impractical gap sizes between 
adjacent patches [8] or the use of multiple layers of patches [9], either of which 
lead to increased fabrication costs (a more detailed discussion on the implications 
of fabrication tolerance can be found in Chapter 10). A more reasonable approach 
would involve the use of the subwavelength loops, which can be used to design a 
reflectarray on a single-layer with reasonable element feature sizes.
To emphasize the reduction in losses that occurs due to lattice size reduction, 
consider Figure 7.6 where the reflection magnitude of loop elements residing in 
various lattice sizes is considered. Even for a minor decrease in lattice size from λ/2 
to λ/3, there is significant loss reduction. A summary of the properties of these loop 
elements is found in Table 7.1. One finds sufficient phase variability to design a re­
flectarray with a lattice as small as λ/6, perhaps even λ/8. It should be noted that for 
lattice sizes below λ/8, there is insufficient phase variability to design a high-gain

reflectarray, making the very low losses superfluous to the overall antenna design. 
Lastly, consider that the resonant length of the elements reduces as the lattice size 
reduces. This indicates that the interelement coupling leads to a reduction in reso­
nant frequency and hence the element itself is no longer resonant and is strongly 
dependent on the adjacent elements: a coupled-resonance.

Reflectarrays on Lossy Substrates
In general, it can be said that subwavelength, coupled-resonant elements ex­
hibit low losses and are therefore ideally suited for reflectarray designs where the 
use of lossy substrates is required.
7.4  Frequency Dispersion of the Reflection Phase and Its Relationship 
with Loss
We have shown in Section 7.3.1 that both narrowband and wideband elements can 
exhibit significant reflection losses. An alternative configuration was shown in Sec­
tion 7.3.2, which involved the reduction in lattice size below that of the typical λ/2 
spacing, which leads to very low losses. It is worthwhile exploring the mechanisms 
that lead to this reduction in losses [7].
7.4.1  Qualitative Description of Loss Reduction
It is important to address the question as to why subwavelength elements exhibit 
substantially lower losses than their resonant counterparts. The answer can be 
given qualitatively by observing and describing the mechanism by which resonance 
occurs in both cases. First, one can excite the resonant and subwavelength loop 
elements with identical normally incident y-polarized plane waves and observe the 
total fields and power dissipation surrounding the loops. The substrate considered 
in both of the cases presented in this section is 1.524-mm-thick FR4, identical to the 
material discussed in Section 7.3.2. The loop elements are always placed at the z = 
0 plane with the lengths given in Table 7.1 for the case of λ/2 and λ/6 lattice spacing 
at 12.5 GHz. The near-field distributions of the resonant-spaced loop element are 
shown in Figures 7.7(a), 7.7(c), and 7.7(e). It is essential to recognize that the fields 
are predominantly confined in the lossy substrate and more specifically, immedi­
ately surrounding and directly beneath the element itself, as shown in Figures 7.7(a) 
and 7.7(c) for the field components Ey and Ez. This is indicative of a self-resonant

structure since the field strength is orders of magnitude lower as one approaches the 
adjacent elements as compared to the central element. In other words, the coupling 
between elements in the periodic array does not play a great role in the resonant 
behavior of the loop. These surrounding elements are not shown due to the use of 
periodic boundary conditions. This confinement of fields in the lossy regions leads 
to significant reduction in the reflection magnitude. 
Conversely, as shown in Figures 7.7(b), 7.7(d), and 7.7(f), the fields surround­
ing the subwavelength loop element are evenly distributed in both the substrate and 
air superstrate with Ey predominantly existing between adjacent elements rather

than being associated with individual elements. This is indicative of a coupled reso­
nance since the field magnitudes remains quite large at the median position be­
tween elements (at the periodic boundary). This further suggests that the adjacent 
elements in the array are critical in maintaining resonant behavior. The fact that the 
fields are not strongly confined to lossy regions leads to lowered overall losses. Ad­
ditionally, it should be noted that the fields in the air and dielectric regions as well 
as the currents on the conductors have significantly lower magnitudes as compared 
to their resonant counterparts. In particular, the peak Ey and Ez field magnitudes 
are 12 dB and 3 dB lower for the subwavelength loop as compared to the field 
magnitudes in the resonant loop case, respectively. To ensure a fair comparison, 
identical plane wave excitation is used in both cases. The relaxing of field confine­
ment and the reduced intensity for the field and current suggests the subwavelength 
elements have a lower quality factor (Q) than their resonant counterparts with 
numerical confirmation of this fact in Section 7.4.2. 
7.4.2  Quantitative Description of Loss Reduction
For a quantitative explanation of reduced losses, we can compute the frequency 
dispersion of the reflection phase [Figure 7.8(a)] and reflection magnitudes [Fig­
ure 7.8(b)] for square loop elements for various lattice sizes. The reflection phase 
frequency dispersion is defined as the frequency derivative of the reflection phase:

where φ is the reflection phase in degrees and f is the frequency in gigahertz. Ele­
ment length is selected such that their resonance falls approximately at the desired 
frequency of 12.5 GHz, with the lengths equal to the resonant lengths listed in 
Table 7.1. The λ/2-spaced loop has greater dispersion than its subwavelength coun­
terparts, and consequently has the greatest loss. Notice also the glaring similarity 
between the frequency dependency of dispersion [Figure 7.8(a)] and loss [Figure 
7.8(b)], confirming that dispersion and loss are deeply interdependent quantities. 
The plots are nearly identical but for a change in the variable along the y-axis. If 
one were to plot frequency dispersion of reflection phase versus the reflection mag­
nitude, a nearly linear relationship between these quantities becomes apparent, as 
shown in Figure 7.9. This would appear to have implications on the amount of loss 
we must incur if a particular dispersion is required and vice versa. It also suggests 
that to design a low-loss reflectarray, the elements must have low reflection phase

7.5  High-Performance Reflectarrays Using Lossy Substrates
In this section we will consider reflectarray design examples that make use of ele­
ments with low reflection phase frequency dispersion. Four offset-fed direct-re­
flection reflectarrays were designed, fabricated, and measured, all having identical 
design specifications (denoted reflectarray designs A through D with their details 
summarized in Table 7.2). The design aperture size used was 396 mm × 396 mm 
with the design center frequency of 12.5 GHz (Ku-band). The coordinate origin 
was placed at the center of the reflectarray, with the phase center of the feed located 
at (xf, yf, zf) = (-124 mm, 0 mm, 432 mm) corresponding to a main beam directed 
16° off broadside. The feed used is a Q-par QSG17S15S with a mid-band gain of 
15 dBi leading to an approximate 10-dB edge taper illumination. The reflectarray

configuration is shown in Figure 7.10 with photographs of the designs shown in 
Figure 7.11.
Designs A and B were traditional reflectarray designs using λ/2 spaced loop 
elements with a lattice size of 12 mm. Design A was designed on 125-mil-thick 
Arlon Diclad 880, while Design B was designed on 125-mil-thick FR4 with relative 
permittivity εr = 4.45 and loss tangent tanδ = 0.016. While designs A and B utilize 
substrates with different permittivity, they should both achieve the same aperture 
efficiency at the center design frequency, save for the material losses due to the high 
loss tangent in Design B. 
However, Designs C and D were reflectarray designs using square loop elements 
in a nontraditional subwavelength lattice size of λ/6. Design C used 60-mil-thick 
Rogers 3003 while design D used 60-mil-thick FR4 (identical substrate as Design 
B). It should be noted that a thicker substrate is used for the traditional resonant-
spaced designs. This was performed purposefully as the losses in Design B would be 
too large to make sensible comparisons between the various designs. In this sense, 
we are being generous to the traditional resonant-spaced design technique for com­
parison purposes. The traditional reflectarrays using resonant elements consisted 
of 1,089 elements while the subwavelength based reflectarrays had 9,801 elements 
all using the same aperture size, etching tolerance, and fabrication process, thus 
making material costs the only financially discernible difference between designs.
The reflection coefficient magnitude of Designs B and D are shown in Fig­
ures 7.12(a) and 7.12(b), respectively (lighter colors representing larger reflection 
magnitude). Recall that Designs B and D use resonant and subwavelength element 
spacing, respectively, with both designs residing on lossy FR4. The subwavelength 
reflectarray has substantially larger reflection magnitude over the entire reflecting 
surface as expected. Moreover, we see substantial losses over the entire reflectar­
ray designed using wideband resonant elements. From these simulation results, we

expect the subwavelength-based Design D to achieve higher aperture efficiency and 
thus higher gain as compared to the resonant element-based Design B.
The far-field patterns of the four reflectarrays were measured with the gain 
versus frequency curves for the four reflectarrays shown in Figure 7.13. The two 
reflectarrays designed using subwavelength elements (Designs C and D) achieved 
a 19% 1-dB gain bandwidth, with the lossy FR4 based design losing at most 0.7 
dB of gain at center frequency compared to its low loss (and more costly) Rogers 
3003-based reflectarray. These experimentally measured bandwidths are similar 
to those shown both via simulation and experiment in [6, 9]. Additionally, the 
low-loss subwavelength design achieved higher peak gain than the resonant based 
design, though the low loss resonant design from [10] exhibits a wider bandwidth 
of 25% for 1-dB gain.
However, the reflectarray designed using an FR4 substrate with resonant spaced 
elements (Design B) suffers from a significant gain drop principally due to losses 
in the FR4 material. Note also the dramatic drop in gain around 13.4 GHz, which

154

is attributed to the fact that the elements at the center of the reflectarray are all in 
the vicinity of a very high-Q resonance, thus providing the worst-case scenario for 
losses in reflectarray design: the greatest illumination occurring in regions where 
the reflectarray exhibits the greatest loss.

7.6  Concluding Remarks 
155
It is important to note that the reflectarray designed using resonant elements on 
FR4 is by no means optimized for low loss. However, it is representative of a typi­
cal reflectarray design that would perform quite well on a typical low-loss substrate 
and yet exhibits poor electrical performance due to the lossy substrate. Without 
any optimization and strictly through the reduction of lattice size (and thus element 
size), the subwavelength loop-based reflectarray performs nearly as well on lossy 
FR4 as it does on low loss Rogers 3003 material. A comparison of the far-field gain 
patterns at the center frequency of 12.5 GHz of these two subwavelength-based 
reflectarrays are shown in Figure 7.14. Note that the patterns are nearly identical, 
save for a marginal reduction in gain due to the lossy substrate. There is a stark 
difference in material costs between the two designs, thereby making the slight 
reduction in gain a reasonable price to pay in scenarios where cost reduction is of 
paramount importance.
7.6  Concluding Remarks
In this chapter we have explored the design of reflectarray antennas on lossy sub­
strates. The main motivation for this examination is to take advantage of the lower 
costs associated with lossy substrates. As shown, if attention is not given to the 
selection of reflectarray elements, an otherwise high-performance design would per­
form quite poorly on a lossy substrate. This leads to a discussion of the mechanisms 
by which losses occur in reflectarray elements, showing that both narrowband and 
wideband elements can exhibit a large amount of loss. A class of elements known

Reflectarrays on Lossy Substrates
as subwavelength, coupled-resonant (SCR) elements was shown to exhibit very low 
losses with sufficient phase variability for the design of high-gain reflectarrays. It 
was further shown that SCR loop elements exhibit superior performance over SCR 
patches as they require less restrictive etching tolerance and reduced fabrication 
complexity. 
A comparative study of the near-field behavior of resonant-spaced and sub­
wavelength elements was given, with the conclusion that the strong near-field cou­
pling in SCR elements reduces the overall intensity of the near fields (lower Q) as 
well as a reduction in the confinement of the near fields within the lossy substrate. 
Quantitatively, the SCR elements exhibit lower reflection phase frequency disper­
sion, which is shown to be inextricably linked to the reflection magnitude and 
hence loss. 
Lastly, a collection of reflectarray designs were considered, culminating in a 
high-performance reflectarray residing on a low-cost, lossy FR4 substrate. Com­
parisons were made with reflectarrays designed on high-cost, low-loss substrates 
with only marginal reduction in gain observed due to material losses. Moreover, a 
reflectarray designed using dispersive elements in conjunction with a lossy substrate 
such as FR4 leads to a significant reduction in reflectarray gain. At no additional 
fabrication cost and with significant material cost reduction, a high-performance 
reflectarray antenna can be designed and fabrication on low-cost, high-loss sub­
strate materials.

Transmitarray
8.1  Introduction
Offset-fed reflectarray structures are designed to avoid feed blocking loss. However, 
the offset geometry gives rise to higher cross polarization, beam squint, and feed im­
age. A transmitarray that combines the features of a traditional dielectric lens and 
phased array can overcome the shortcomings of offset reflectarray. In transmitarray, 
the incident electromagnetic wave transmits through the multilayer structure and is 
converted from spherical phasefront into any desired phasefront [1]. The advance­
ment of lithographic etching technology has realized the possibility of low-cost and 
simple methods for fabrication of planar lens structures. However, the design of a 
transmitarray is more complicated than that of a reflectarray antenna because the 
radiating element must provide both the high transmission and phase compensation 
concurrently as compared to reflectarray where only the desired phase compensa­
tion for the reflected wave is required. 
Different techniques for designing transmitarray and a number of its applica­
tions are introduced in this chapter.
8.2  Antenna-Filter-Antenna Transmitarray
A basic transmitarray structure is divided into two principal devices as shown in 
Figure 8.1 [2]: radiating interfaces for reception and transmission and the process­
ing interface for array phase configuration in each transmitarray cell. The early 
transmitarrays using this technique were introduced in [3, 4]. Figure 8.2 shows an 
example of such transmitarray configuration where resonant patches constitute the 
radiation interfaces and a transmission line delay with varying length was utilized 
between the resonant patches as the processing interface to obtain the required 
phase transformation. Two different types of interconnections between elements of 
opposing faces were used, as illustrated in Figure 8.2. Shorting pin through an aper­
ture in the common ground plane is the first interconnection type and slot-coupled 
aperture is the second type.

Fabrication complexity, limited bandwidth, and reduced phase shift range that 
reduce the aperture efficiency are some of the main drawbacks of these planar 
lenses. 
An alternative approach was developed based on nonuniform array of antenna-
filter-antenna (AFA) elements [5, 6]. These elements have been previously demon­
strated and used in uniform arrays for designing frequency-selective surfaces (FSS) 
[7]. Different types of bandpass filter with required phase delays, acting as the 
processing interface in Figure 8.1, can be used for the design of the transmitarray.

Figure 8.3 was introduced in [8] to design an AFA planar lens. The antenna ele­
ments are hexagonal patches, etched on glass substrates. The middle resonator is 
a half-wave resonator that couples the power between top and bottom patches 
with 180° phase difference at its flared ends. A circuit model for this structure is 
shown in Figure 8.4. As shown in this figure, the AFA structure can be viewed as a 
bandpass filter between two radiation ports. The cell elements of the structure were 
single-polarized and present the required frequency response only for the incident 
waves polarized in parallel with the CPW resonators as shown in Figure 8.3. 
To use this element in a transmitarray, the desired phase-shift between the in­
put and output of each array cell should be realized. To achieve different values of 
phase shift, the elements are retuned in the vicinity of the operating frequency by 
scaling the transversal dimensions. The maximum range of phase shift that can be 
obtained in this method is equal to the in-band variations of the phase delay, which 
is close to 180° in the case of a three-pole AFA.
The main drawback of the structures introduced so far is relatively large in­
terelement spacing between the array elements which makes the phase response 
more sensitive to the angle of incidence. Additionally, the cell elements of these

transmitarrays have limited phase variation which results in reducing the aperture 
efficiency.
Recently, a new technique was introduced to design transmitarray where fre­
quency selective surfaces (FSS) were used as phase processing interface [9]. The 
phase shift required for beam collimation was achieved from the phase response of 
the transfer functions of the cascade of FSSs. The phase shift that can be achieved 
from a bandpass FSS is directly related to the type and order of its frequency re­
sponse. In this transmitarray a multilayer stack of subwavelength patch-grid as 
shown in Figure 8.5 is utilized to design an nth-order passband FSS [10] that has 
n capacitive layers of subwavelength patches and n - 1 inductive layers of grids. 
The phase and amplitude of transmission coefficients of this bandpass FSS with 
second, third, and fourth orders are shown in Figure 8.6. As seen from Figure 8.6, 
the higher the order of the response, the larger is the achievable phase shift range.
According to Figure 8.6, a fourth-order frequency response would be sufficient 
if a phase variation of more than 270° but less than 360° is needed for the high 
transmission frequency band. The synthesis procedure described in [10] was used

to achieve the required phase front on the aperture of the transmitarray. The di­
mensions of subwavelength patches, grids, and separation between adjacent layers 
can be adjusted to synthesize the required phase response. Figure 8.7 shows the 
phase and amplitude of the transmission coefficient of this FSS for different con­
figurations [9]. As shown in this figure about 170° phase variation was achieved 
at 10 GHz. 
8.3  Multilayer Transmitarray Using Matching Impedance
In this method, multilayer FSS with appropriate surface impedance values were 
cascaded and the separations between them were adjusted to have the entire wave 
transmitted at design frequency with a specified phase front. As will be outlined 
next, different configurations were used for designing transmitarray based on this 
technique, some of which are introduced here.
8.3.1  Transmitarray with Multilayer of Dipoles
A multilayer dual-polarized transmitarray composed of cross dipoles [11, 12] is 
shown in Figure 8.8(a). The size of the dipoles was changed to control the imped­
ance of each layer and the separation between the layers is adjusted to maximize 
transmission at the design frequency. The s-parameters of two infinite FSS with 
airgap d between the substrates under a normally incident plan wave illumination 
as shown in Figure 8.8(b) can be calculated using matrix propagator method [13]. 
In this method the scattering matrix of single layer is calculated and then the fol­
lowing equations are utilized for the calculation of the scattering parameters of the 
whole structure.

magnitude of transmitted wave for different number of layers up to four layers as 
a function of the dipole length. Both the phase and magnitude of the transmitted 
wave are improved by increasing the number of layers. The phase and magnitude 
of the transmitted wave of a four-layer transmitarray for different separations be­
tween layers are shown in Figure 8.10. A phase variation close to 300° with a 
magnitude less than 3 dB was achieved for 1-mm separation between the layers.

A lens that consists of four substrates with identical thickness of 0.508 mm and 
permittivity of εr = 3 as shown in Figure 8.11 was designed and fabricated at for 
operation at 30 GHz The cross dipoles with identical arms were etched on top of 
each substrate and the size of cross dipoles were adjusted to collimate the beam 
of spherical wave emanating from the feed. The size of cross dipoles with similar 
transverse coordinate on substrates was identical. There is an air-gap of d = 1 mm 
between adjacent layers. The transmitarray was designed for F/D = 0.9 with dimen­
sions of 15 cm × 15 cm and the cell size of 6 mm × 6 mm. The radiation pattern of 
this antenna is shown in Figure 8.12. 
8.3.2  Dual-Band Transmitarray
A dual-band transmitarray designed for two frequency bands of 20 GHz and 30 
GHz has been reported which was essentially the same as single-band transmitarray 
except that cross dipoles for two bands were interlaced on each layer of the struc­
ture as shown in Figure 8.13. The pyramidal horns were located at the focal point 
of the structure with 4-cm separation between the centers of two feeds to minimize 
coupling between the feeds. The phase versus arm length for both bands is shown 
in Figure 8.14. The coupling between the bands is taken into account in this simula­
tion by assigning the length of the 20-GHz dipole at resonance for the simulation of 
the 30-GHz dipoles and vice versa. A four-layer transmitarray with same substrate 
configuration (dielectric constant, thickness, and separation between adjacent lay­
ers) as for the single-band transmitarray that was described in the previous subsec­
tion, was designed and fabricated and the gain versus frequency for both bands are 
depicted in Figure 8.15.

8.3.3  Multilayer Transmitarray Using Loop Elements
One of the main disadvantages of the method explained in the previous section is 
infeasibility of achieving the full 360° phase shift using a single layer that enforces 
utilization of multilayers to achieve the full phase span [14]. In this section square 
loop is introduced as an alternative cell element to cross dipole to increase the phase 
variation and enhance transmitarray bandwidth.

To reduce the number of layers that are required in the transmitarray antenna, 
the magnitude of phase shift per layer of the transmitarray should be maximized. 
Therefore, a second concentric ring has been added to yield the double square 
ring element, as shown in Figure 8.16(b). The transmission magnitude and phase 
versus frequency graphs are illustrated for generic single- and double-square ring 
geometries in Figure 8.17. As the dimensions of the element change, the magnitude 
and phase responses shift higher or lower in frequency, and thus the phase change 
seen at a particular frequency can be controlled. In optimizing the position of the 
two resonances, the extra degree of freedom of the inner ring can be used to find 
the best balance between the phase change and the transmission magnitude band­
width. From Figure 8.17, it is seen that the addition of the second inner ring has in­
troduced a second resonance in the frequency response and has increased the slope

tween the two resonances at 22 GHz and 32.5 GHz), a greater total phase change 
can be obtained from the double square ring element as its dimensions are varied.
Four different design strategies were investigated as illustrated in Figure 8.18. 
In the “fixed-gap” approach, the gap size between the inner and outer rings was 
set to a constant value and the width of the element was varied in order to control 
the phase variation. In an effort to improve the bandwidth, the second strategy em­
ployed a variable gap, in which the gap size is a function of the element width; this

approach was used to delay the onset of the second resonance into the desired 30-
GHz operating band. A double-sided design was also investigated to determine if 
an increased coupling between the rings could either widen the element bandwidth 
or lead to a larger per-layer phase change. Finally, an element with a fixed outer 
ring width was simulated; in this case the phase variation is controlled by specify­
ing the width of the inner ring. This last design is unique in that it combines two 
different geometries which together are meant to cover the full 360° phase range.
Having selected the fixed-outer-ring approach and determined the optimized 
single-layer dimensions for this unit cell, the next step is to simulate the multilayer 
structure. To avoid time-consuming full-wave simulations, the matrix propagator 
method as explained in the previous section was used to calculate the magnitude 
and phase responses of the proposed design for two-, three-, and four-layer struc­
tures for a variety of layer separations from 1 mm up to 10 mm. An identical 
3-mm air gap between each of the layers was found to yield the highest 30-GHz 
transmission magnitude over the intended inner ring width range for all three mul­
tilayer designs. The multilayer structures for this optimum layer spacing were then 
simulated in HFSS and Figure 8.19 shows the 30-GHz transmission magnitude and 
phase curves versus inner ring width for multilayer geometries ranging from two 
to four layers; in each case, the separation between layers is 3 mm. The four-layer 
magnitude and phase responses calculated from the matrix propagator method are 
also superimposed on the graphs and good agreement between the two approaches

is obtained. Note that the graphs also indicate the range of values covered by each 
of the two geometries. The results show that the minimum transmission magnitude 
experienced by the configurations is −4 dB with close to 270° phase variation in 
total. Figure 8.20 plots the transmission magnitude and phase responses versus 
inner ring width for a four-layer structure for several frequencies ranging from 28 
GHz to 31 GHz. A minimum of 270° phase variation is achieved at each frequency 
across the band and the transmission magnitude over the width range is usually 
above −3 dB. The transmission magnitude begins to decrease for frequencies above 
31 GHz.
The four-layer transmitarray with the fixed-outer-ring unit cell was fabricated 
according to the dimensions of Table 8.1 with an F/D ratio of 0.9. A Rogers RT/
Duroid 5880 substrate was used and foam spacers were inserted between the lay­
ers to create the air gaps. Figure 8.21 shows the measured far-field H-plane and 
E-plane radiation patterns for both copolarized and cross-polarized signals at 30 
GHz as well as the measured peak H-plane gain versus frequency.

As its name suggests, the phase shifting surface (PSS) is a free-standing surface 
or screen that allows for controlled changing of the phase of an electromagnetic

patches/strips etched on multilayer substrate the same as the configurations intro­
duced in Section 8.2.1. However, the layers of PSSs are cascaded closely to get the 
advantage of the coupling between the layers which reduces the thickness of the 
structure. A unit cell as shown in Figure 8.22 was introduced in [15] to design an 
electrically thin PSS antenna. The structure is composed of two thin dielectric sub­
strates with conducting strips etched on two sides (inner and outer) of one substrate 
and on one side (outer) of the second substrate. The objective is to control the value 
of the local phase shift of the transmitted wave while simultaneously minimizing 
the reflected wave. A circuit model for this structure is shown in Figure 8.23. The 
parameter extraction capability in the commercial code [16] was used to determine

the value of the equivalent circuit components. The shunt capacitances C1 and C2 
result from the charge accumulation at the edge of the strips of two adjacent unit 
cells, located on the same layer, but separated by a gap along the y-axis. The series 
inductance L is function of the dielectric constant εr. It was observed in the simula­
tion models that the electric field, which was assumed to be initially polarized in 
the y-direction, was bent between two strips of the same unit cell, providing a z-
component of the field and hence the resulting series capacitance . The structure is 
clearly physically symmetrical, and hence so is the equivalent circuit.

A 15-cm-square cylindrical PSS with F/D = 0.5 was designed and fabricated 
based on this cell element. A photograph of this cylindrical lens is shown in Figure 
8.24. Figure 8.25 shows the measured gain versus frequency for this PSS. A dielec­
tric lens with the same size as PSS and the same F/D was also designed and the gain 
versus frequency of this lens is shown in Figure 8.25 for comparison. The same 
feed was used for both lenses. The same efficiency was measured for both lenses at 
the design frequency (30 GHz). However, the bandwidth of the PSS is significantly 
narrower than the dielectric lens as was expected. 
A two-dimensional PSS with patch instead of strips was also investigated and 
details of the design process and measurement can be found in [17].

New Techniques for Beam Switching or 
Steering in Reflectarray and Transmitarray 
9.1  Introduction
Steerable beam antennas have been used for many decades for many applications 
such as radar, wireless communications, radiometric remote sensing, and imaging 
[1, 2]. Beam steering can be realized by mechanical rotation of the antenna, elec­
tronic phase control of large arrays, or a combination of these two methods (e.g., 
mechanical for azimuth and electrical for elevation). Purely mechanical solutions 
have the advantage of being low-cost compared to their electronic counterparts. 
However, they offer lower-speed beam control, which can be a limiting factor in 
certain imaging and wireless applications especially for the millimeter-wave band 
where more resolution is required. In addition, mechanical steering is more prone 
to correction for vibrations. Replacing these with electronically steered antennas 
would reduce power consumption and remove the need for lubrication and hence 
improve reliability. However, this is currently an unviable option because of tech­
nological limitations, which are imposed on producing reliable and low-loss phase 
shifters in the upper millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave bands.
Electronically reconfigurable reflectarray and transmitarray antennas are re­
ceiving an increasing interest in key areas such as space and terrestrial communica­
tions, remote sensing, microwave imaging and radar systems [3]. Such antennas, 
in fact, potentially exhibit exceptional performance in scanning/tracking velocity, 
tolerance to vibrations, coverage modification, and robustness against interference. 
The low loss associated with the quasi-optical feeding system makes this solution 
preferable to its conventional counterpart represented by direct radiating arrays, es­
pecially at millimeter-wave frequencies. Reconfigurability is typically accomplished 
by employing solid state tuning devices (PIN or varactor diodes, FET). Recent ad­
vances in RF MEMS [4] technology eventually enable the use of such components 
in RF and millimeter-wave systems. Thanks to their inherent low cost and high 
performance, RF MEMS can potentially bring in completely new classes of tun­
able devices and circuits, particularly at high frequencies where the semiconductor-
based counterparts suffer from inevitable limitations such as loss, nonlinearities, 
and cost. In this framework, reflectarrays are of special interest particularly at

millimeter-wave frequencies, where the loss associated with the feeding network 
makes it impractical to use directly radiating phased arrays. 
Some of the most recent developments in reconfigurable reflectarrays and 
transmitarrays will be explained in this chapter. Different mechanical techniques 
for beam scanning of reflectarray and transmitarray will be addressed. The chapter 
will continue by introducing a photonically controlled technique for beam scan­
ning of reflectarray and some novel photoconductive polymer materials will be 
introduced to enhance the efficiency of this technique. Recently, liquid crystal de­
vices (LCD) have been introduced for reflectarray beam scanning at the millimeter-
wave band. This method will be explained. Different electronically reconfigurable 
reflectarray antennas will be introduced at the end of this chapter.
9.2  Mechanical Techniques for Beam Scanning of Reflectarray and 
Transmitarray
Recently, there has been intense research in the field of beam-scanning antenna 
using a mechanical system [5]. The response time of such antennas is about a mil­
lisecond, which is slower than electrical methods; however, these antennas are ex­
cellent in terms of loss, cost, and power consumption compared with those made 
of a semiconductor.
Different mechanical techniques have been introduced to scan the main beam 
of reflectarrays. The simplest on is to put the reflectarray on a two axis steering 
system driven by the desired elevation and azimuth angles. However, these me­
chanical systems are bulky and heavy and scanning speed is slow. Previously, it has 
been shown that if a periphery shorted circular patch antenna is illuminated with a 
circularly polarized signal, it provides upon electrical or mechanical rotation of the 
disk a means for spatially phase shifting the incident circularly polarized signal. A 
method is introduced in [6] that uses the above concept to steer reflectarray beam 
by rotating the elements of the reflectarray. ���������������������������������������
In this method, the reflectarray is il­
luminated with a CP feed and the phase of elements is controlled by mechanical 
rotation of cell element. 
An active Fresnel reflector was also introduced in [7, 8] as a mechanical tech­
nique to scan the pattern of a Fresnel reflector. In this technique the Fresnel surface 
is divided to small cells and the level of the phase imparted by each cell is controlled 
mechanically using an actuator as shown in Figure 9.1. The actuator is placed 
under each reflecting cell, and it allows a displacement of the reflecting cell for two 
different states of 0 and 1, which correspond to 0° and 180° reflection phases, re­
spectively. This can control the position of the Fresnel configuration on the surface 
of the antenna and scan the beam of the Fresnel reflector. 
In both of the above techniques, we need a separate motor or actuator for each 
element to control the cell elements individually, which makes the mechanical sys­
tem very complex and heavy. In this chapter, alternative mechanical techniques will 
be introduced for beam scanning or beam switching of reflectarray and transmitar­
ray that proves to be simpler.

9.2.1  A Mechanical Method for Beam Switching of Reflectarray
The first method is based on a reflectarray cell element [9] introduced in Chapter 
3. The cell element is composed of patches with identical sizes, loaded with slots of 
varying length on ground plane. A view of this cell element is shown in Figures 9.2 
and 9.3 shows the configuration of a mechanically steerable reflectarray that uti­
lizes this type of cell element. The top layer was composed of identical size patches 
and the middle and bottom layers were composed of two sets of slots. In the middle 
layer, the first set of slots (1) all had identical sizes and the second set of slots (2) 
was several groups of slots of dissimilar length. There is no air gap between these 
two sets of slots and each group of slots of varying length corresponds to one and 
only one beam. The slots of identical length acted as a window through which only 
one set of variable slots can be seen by the patches. The slots that belonged to other 
sets were covered by the ground plane. Figure 9.3 shows three sets of such slots in 
each unit cell on layer 2 for collimating the beam at −30°, 0°, and +30 depending 
on the set of slots that are visible to the patch through the “window” in the second

layer. It should be noted that only the slots aligned with the uniform slots are seen 
by the incoming wave. The separation between the slots within the same unit cell 
is 1.0 mm. Therefore, upward or downward displacement of the second layer with 
respect to the first layer is ±1 mm, which resulted in three different beams pointing 
to −30°, 0°, +30°. 
A prototype was made based on the above principle and the fabricated reflec­
tarray is shown in Figure 9.4. The normalized radiation pattern for this antenna at

30 GHz is shown in Figure 9.5. As shown in this figure, the beam can be switched 
between +30°, 0°, and -30° by moving layer (2) with respect to upper patch layer. 
9.2.2  A Mechanical Method for Beam Scanning of Transmitarray
A cylindrical lens based on the multilayer transmitarray introduced in Chapter 8 is 
used to design a one-dimensional beam scanning cylindrical transmitarray at Ka-
band [10]. A photograph of this lens with a schematic front view is shown in Figure 
9.6. This antenna is fed by an array of 2 × 16 microstrip patch elements. The feed 
generate a fan-shaped pattern which illuminate the cylindrical lens. The cylindrical 
transmitarray is designed to change the fan-shaped beam received from the feed 
into a symmetrical pencil-shaped pattern. The beam is scanned by rotating the feed 
mechanically. Because this lens is designed for beam scanning by rotating the feed 
mechanically, the distance between the feed and the transmitarray should be identi­
cal for all feed angles. To do so, the transmitarray is design in a cylindrical shape 
and the elements are designed to collimate the fan-shaped beam coming from the 
feed in elevation plane without changing the feed pattern in azimuth plane. The feed 
is located at the center of cylinder. The transmitarray consists of four identical lay­
ers of substrate with permittivity of εr = 3 and thickness of 0.020 inch (see Chapter 
8). There is a 1-mm air gap between adjacent layers. The transmitarray elements 
are cross dipoles and the phase is adjusted by changing the length of dipoles arms. 
Figure 9.7 shows the measured radiation pattern of this antenna for different feed 
angles in both azimuth and elevation planes. As shown in this figure, the fan-shaped 
beam of the feed is collimated to a symmetrical pencil-shaped beam and ±30° beam 
scanning can be achieved with this antenna without compromising gain and sid­
elobe performance of the transmitarray.

9.3  Reflectarray Beam Scanning Using Reconfigurable Materials
Changing the properties such as permittivity, permeability, and conductivity of ma­
terials, which are used as substrate or radiating elements of reflectarray is one way 
to design reconfigurable reflectarray elements for beam scanning applications. Dif­
ferent tunable materials such as photoconductive materials, liquid crystals (LC), 
and ferroelectric materials are used to design reconfigurable reflectarray elements. 
In this section, tunable reflectarray elements using photoconductive and LCs will 
be presented.
9.3.1  Photonically Controlled Method for Beam Scanning of Reflectarray
Photo-induced plasma in a semiconductor medium is a promising solution for in­
expensive beam steering in the microwave and millimeter-wave bands [11, 12]. The 
key element in these antennas is the interaction of the RF energy with an electron-
hole plasma grating created by optical means. Recently a new photonic technique 
based on photo-induced plasma is presented for beam scanning of reflectarray an­
tennas [13]. The proposed technique is based on varying the slot length by em­
ploying the photo-induced plasma, which establishes the phase shift mechanism 
in a reflectarray configuration. The reflectarray antenna consists of three layers. 
A schematic view of this structure is depicted in Figure 9.8. The first layer is a di­
electric substrate layer onto which an array of microstrip patches of identical sizes 
is etched. The second layer is a silicon wafer with slots of identical size etched on 
its lower surface. An optically transparent substrate layer (glass) is located beneath 
the silicon. There is a small air gap between this glass plate and the silicon wafer. 
An indium tin-oxide (ITO) film is interposed on top of the glass between the silicon 
wafer and glass layer. The ITO sheet is optically transparent but reflective at the 
wavelength of the RF signal. The optical mask is attached to the glass. An optical

source illuminates the reflectarray from the glass side. The photo-induced plasma 
generated inside the silicon changes the slot length which can control the phase dis­
tribution of the reflectarray to scan the beam of the reflectarray in a desire direction. 
Figure 9.9 shows the phase and amplitude of the reflected wave versus the slot 
length when the slot length is changed by photo-induced plasma. The carrier den­
sity of plasma is set to 1017 cm−3, 1018 cm−3, and infinite (perfect conductor). As 
shown in this figure, as the carrier density of the plasma is decreased, the plasma 
loss is increased, and this adversely affects the reflection coefficient of the structure.

Figure 9.10 shows the measured radiation pattern of this reflectarray when the 
optical signal is switched ON and OFF, respectively. The pattern is collimated at 0° 
when the reflectarray is illuminated with optical excitation. 
The photo-induced plasma generated in semiconductor suffers from a number 
of shortcomings, including:
1.	 High-power optical sources are required to avoid excessive losses and ob­
tain adequate efficiency, due to the inverse proportionality of losses inside 
the plasma to the optical power intensity.

2.	 Technological restrictions on processing large high-resistivity semiconduc­
tor wafers preclude the design of monolithic high-gain antenna arrays. 
3.	 Coating a thin layer of high-resistivity semiconductor on a substrate is not 
currently feasible with the present technologies.
To overcome these shortcomings, polymeric materials are being considered as 
an alternative to semiconductors. These materials have many advantages over con­
ventional semiconductors [14]. They are low-cost, easy to process, more efficient, 
and lightweight. A thin layer of the polymer can also be easily coated over a large 
surface area. A photoconductive polymer derived from poly (N-vinyl carbazole)
(PVK) is introduced in [15]. A thin layer of this polymer is coated on one size of 
a glass substrate. To characterize the polymer, the glass substrate coated with the 
polymer is located in front of an open waveguide as shown in Figure 9.11. The 
polymer is illuminated through a slot. The reflection coefficient with and without 
optical excitation is measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA). Figure 9.12 
compares the reflectivity versus frequency of a dark polymer sample and with the 
sample illuminated by an optical intensity of 2.3 W/cm2 (maximum optical power 
generated by halogen lamp). The reflection coefficient of the sample when a metal 
plate is located in front of the slot is also shown as a comparison to the conductiv­
ity of photo-induced plasma generated in the polymer. The similarity of the S11 
of the optically illuminated sample with that of the metal plate indicates highly 
conductive nature of the optically excited polymer sample.
9.3.2  Reconfigurable Reflectarrays Using Liquid Crystals
Liquid crystal (LC) is an anisotropic material showing both properties of a crystal 
and a liquid. The LC state depends on temperature and varies from solid to liquid. 
In the nematic state the rod like molecules float around as in a liquid phase; how­
ever, these are ordered in their orientation. The permittivity of the material can 
therefore be varied at microwave frequencies by changing the molecular orientation

relative to the RF field through application of dc voltage on the LC sample [16,

is aligned parallel to the director of the molecules and ε⊥ when these are aligned 
perpendicular to the RF field.

Figure 9.13 shows schematic of the cross section of a LC tunable reflectarray 
unit cell. The cell consists of a patch printed on a carrier substrate, the ground 
plane printed on a carrier as well, and the LC cavity between patch and ground. A 
thin polyimide film (about 300 nm) is spin coated both on the ground plane and 
on the patches, cured and finally mechanically rubbed, to provide the prealign­
ment of the LC molecules. The director of the LC molecules is initially aligned 
parallel to the patch and ground, owing to the polyimide layer [Figure 9.13(a)]. 
The applied bias voltage between patch and ground generates the external electric 
field for reorientating the director of the LC molecules. The RF field, given by the 
microstrip patch fundamental mode is mainly confined in the LC volume and is es­
sentially perpendicular to the director. Thus, the RF field will perceive an effective 
permittivity εr,eff = ε⊥. Applying an increasing bias voltage, the director will begin to

the LC molecules will tend to align with the bias field lines, until the molecules are 
completely aligned parallel to the bias E-field. In this state, the average direction 
of the main axes of all molecules become parallel to the RF-field and the experi­
enced effective permittivity becomes εr,eff = εr// [see Figure 9.13(c)]. The change in 
relative effective permittivity, Δεr,eff produces a change in the capacitance per unit 
length of the microstrip patch. This leads to a shift in the resonance frequency, ωr, 
and also to a shift of the phase characteristic as shown in Figure 9.14. As shown 
in this figure, about 180° phase variation was achieved at design frequency of f = 
101.72 GHz, between this range of discrete phase variation the amplitude (loss) is 
predicted to vary between 3 and 7 dB. It has been shown that the loss improves in 
LC as the frequency increases [18].
9.4  Electronically Controlled Reflectarray Antennas
Electronically reconfigurable reflectarray antennas are receiving an increasing inter­
est in key areas such as space and terrestrial communications, remote sensing, mi­
crowave imaging and radar systems [19]. Such antennas, in fact, potentially exhibit 
exceptional performance in scanning/tracking velocity, tolerance to vibrations, cov­
erage modification, and robustness against interference. Reconfigurability is typi­
cally accomplished by employing solid state tuning devices (PIN or varactor diodes, 
FET, MEMS). Different electrically controlled reflectarray elements using different 
technologies such as PIN, varactor diodes, and MEMS are introduced in this sec­
tion. The pros and cons of these technologies which are used to design electrically 
reconfigurable reflectarray elements are summarized in Table 9.1 [20]. 
PIN diode and MEMS can be used as a switch for changing the length and 
size of reflectarray elements or rotate the elements for CP applications. Depend

on number of switches for each element, different level of phase quantization can 
be achieved. Various types of tunable reflectarray cell elements have been reported 
based on PIN diode and MEMS. A microstrip patch which is connected with short 
circuit stub-loaded with a PIN diode is reported in [21] as a single-bit quantized 
phase shifter to design a tunable reflectarray cell element at 60 GHz. The length of 
stub is adjusted to get 180° phase change when the PIN diode switches. The design 
of the dc bias line is the main challenge in this method due to the high coupling 
between dc bias circuit and reflectarray elements. 
The other reconfigurable reflectarray element introduced in [22], used PIN di­
ode to change the delay line of a patches aperture-coupled to a microstrip delay 
lines ��������������������������������������������������������������������������
as shown in Figure 9.15. MEMS can also be used for this application as re­
ported in [22]. In the method presented in [22], reflectarray elements are grouped 
in a cluster of two or four and the length of a common microstrip delay line is con­
trolled through a PIN to save the number of control devices and their associated dc 
biasing lines. One PIN diode is used for each pair for producing two phase values 
to realize a reflectarray with beam switching capability. The same technique can be 
extended to N phase states if more electronic devices are inserted in the microstrip 
line. The main drawback of this gathering method is the high risk of generating 
grating lobe because the period of the subarray becomes much greater than half 
a wavelength although this undesirable grating lobe might appear to be far away 
from the main beam region. The reflectarray is designed to simplify the voltage 
control system [24]. 
Tunable reflectarrays using RF MEMS have also been reported recently [25–
27]. The RF MEMS has many advantages such as: low insertion loss, low power 
consumption, small size, and low cost.
However there are some drawbacks of using these components in tunable re­
flectarray element such as low speed, the speed of MEMS in the range of microsec­
ond, power handling, the inability of most MEMS elements to handle more than 
100 mw, reliability, and packaging.
A reconfigurable MEMS reflectarray element is introduced in [28]. In this 
method, double cross loop is loaded with variable digital series MEMS capaci­
tors as shown in Figure 9.16. In this approach, five pairs of MEMS are imple­
mented for each cell which generates 25 discrete states in order to achieve a good

phase resolution. The 360° phase variation can be achieved using these 32 different 
states. The redundancy in the phase states can be exploited to mitigate frequency 
dispersion in large reflectarrays, which is tantamount to a wider bandwidth. A 
method was introduced in Chapter 5 to analyze such a complex configuration and 
reduce the simulation time. In this method first a full-wave simulation of the cell is 
made using commercial software such as HFSS where the MEMS are represented 
by internal ports. The overall structure with MEMS elements then will be analysed 
by the connection of the obtained multiport scattering matrix with impedances 
representing the MEMS as depicted in Figure 9.17.
Another technique to design a tunable reflectarray element using MEMS is 
introduced in [30]. This technique is used when the reflectarray elements are illu­
minated with a CP feed. The phase of scattered wave is controlled by rotating the 
cell element. This can be done by switching the status of the switches in Figure 9.18 
to actually display a rotated element to the incoming wave.

Adding tunability to reflectarray element using varactor diodes is another way 
of designing reconfigurable reflectarray elements [31]. A tunable reflectarray with 
patch as radiator element was introduced in [32]. In this method the radiating edge 
of the patch was loaded with a varactor diode as shown in Figure 9.19 to change 
its electrical length. In this technique continuous phase variation can be achieved 
by varying the dc bias of the varactor diode.

Varactor diodes can also be used as a load to a delay line of patches that were 
aperture-coupled to a microstrip delay line as explained in [33] and shown in Fig­
ure 9.20. However, a combination of PIN and varactor diodes was used in a single 
cross-loop element [34] to enhance the phase variation of the tunable element. Loss 
is the main issue in tunable reflectarray elements with varactor diodes. Recently, 
MEMS elements have been developed to design a variable capacitor which can 
be used as an alternative for varactor diodes [35]. The loss of the MEMS is much

lower than varactor diode although their reliability is still a major impediment to 
their further application in scanned/steered beam reflectarray. 
9.5  Dual Reflectarray Antenna for Beam-Scanning Application
Dual reflector antenna with reflectarray as subreflector and parabolic dish or re­
flectarray as main reflector has been used in many papers for beam-scanning ap­
plications [36, 37]. The phase on the aperture of reflectarray can be controlled 
dynamically by using the tunable elements. The reduced size of the subreflector 
translates in a reduced number of required tunable cells. This configuration can be 
used when a beam scanning with limited angular range is required. 
A dual reflectarray antenna made of a passive main reflectarray and a reconfig­
urable subreflectarray is introduced in [38].The reconfigurable elements are based 
on switched delay lines aperture coupled to square patches, that can be implement­
ed by using either pin diodes or MEMS as was explained in the previous sections. 
The beam scanning can be provided by imposing a phase mask into subreflectar­
ray to emulate the optics corresponding to different virtual foci associated to each 
beam direction as shown in Figure 9.21. By varying the progressive phase distribu­
tion on the subreflectarray, the beam is steered from −8° to 5° with practically no 
distortion on the radiation patterns, as shown in Figure 9.22.

Fabrication Technologies
10.1  Outline of Reflectarray Fabrication Technologies
One of the greatest advantages of reflectarray technology resides in the use of 
straightforward fabrication techniques such as chemical etching [1]. The ubiqui­
tous use of chemical etching for PCB manufacturing allows reflectarray fabrication 
to exploit an already well establish and very mature manufacturing process. That 
being said, PCBs most often operate in the subgigahertz frequency regime where 
etching tolerances and features sizes are appreciably large. Chemically etched reflec­
tarrays are naturally suited for operating frequencies such as X-band (8–12 GHz), 
Ku-band (12–18 GHz), and Ka-band (26.5–40 GHz). Additionally, emerging bands 
such as V-bands (50–75 GHz) can exploit reflectarray technology as well. At these 
higher frequencies, the wavelength is short and hence the reflectarray elements are 
necessarily physically small. The consequence is that the required feature sizes (e.g., 
dimensions of patch elements, width of loops, and so on) become quite small so 
as to flirt with the limitations of chemical etching. Typical minimum feature sizes 
of chemical etching reside around 0.2 mm, while more accurate (and substantially 
more costly) techniques can manage 0.1-mm and even 0.05-mm feature sizes. Ul­
timately, it will be determined by the accuracy of the photomask and hence the 
resource providing the printing service.
An emerging fabrication technique includes routing (or milling). The approach 
can be summarized as simply removing the unwanted copper using a very high-
speed drill. The accuracies are determined by both the speed (revolutions per min­
ute, RPM) of the drill, the size of the drill bit, and the rigidity of the substrate 
involved. Slower drills (at a much lower cost) can be used effectively on firmer 
substrates such as FR4 while softer microwave-friendly substrates, such as those 
that are Teflon-based, require faster RPMs to successfully remove copper and not 
substrate. Feature sizes as small as 0.1 mm can be obtained, as discussed in [2].
Another fabrication technique that is subtractive (along with chemical and 
milling) is laser etching [3]. A laser is used to vaporize the unwanted copper clad­
ding from the surface of the substrate. Once again, care must be taken to ensure the 
substrate is not removed as well, nor damaged during manufacturing. Laser etching 
offers minimum feature sizes as low as 0.025 mm, exceeding the performance of 

200 
������������������������
Fabrication Technologies
the chemical and milling approaches. That being said, as the technology matures, 
finer feature sizes are expected.
Lastly, another emerging fabrication technique that is additive rather than sub­
tractive involves inkjet printing [4]. As the name would suggest, inkjet printing 
involves the use of a printer and nozzle whereby metallic (or possibly dielectric) 
inks are deposited and patterned on a substrate. This technique offers possible cost 
savings, especially for large-volume fabrication, but also opens up many interesting 
possibilities involving the mixing of dielectric and metal inks and possibly the in 
situ printing of active devices. The minimum feature sizes using inkjet printing is 
variably dependent on the printer, ink, and substrate used, but generally speaking 
feature sizes of 0.050 mm are consistently possible with 0.010 mm a reality as the 
technology matures.
10.2  Element Performance and Minimum Feature Size
10.2.1  Traditional Resonant Elements
In this section, we consider the traditional self-resonant reflectarray element: the 
patch. By varying the size of the patch, the required reflection phase can be ob­
tained for the reflectarray design. However, the question of whether the physical 
sizes of the elements and the smallest required feature size remains unaddressed. 
As discussed in previous chapters, the majority of the patch element’s valuable be­
havior occurs for medium sizes of the patch relative to the element lattice. At the 
very smallest physical size, the patch offer negligible phase variation, and as such 
is not required to operate in these regimes. The consequence is that the feature size 
of the patch element is only limiting in terms of the lattice size of the element. The 
resonant patch typically uses a half-wavelength lattice size so the minimum feature 
size is a small fraction of the aforesaid lattice size (e.g., 25% of the lattice size, or 
λ/8). In such a scenario, the minimum feature sizes of 0.2 mm, 0.1 mm, and 0.05 
mm correspond to feasible reflectarray operating frequencies of 187.5, 375, and 
750 GHz, respectively. This does not take into account the etching tolerances of 
the fabrication process, which will be discussed in the Section 10.3. Nevertheless, it 
strongly supports the notion that reflectarrays can be fabricated using conventional 
chemical etching techniques into the subterahertz regime. Note that if laser etching 
or very fine printed electronics technology is used, one should be capable of pushing 
the reflectarray operation into the terahertz regime [5].
10.2.2  Subwavelength Elements
Subwavelength elements offer numerous advantages as discussed in previous chap­
ters. One possible disadvantage of subwavelength elements can be the physically 
smaller size of the elements and hence the physically smaller minimum feature sizes. 
A reflectarray design consisting of subwavelength patch elements residing within a 
λ/6 lattice requires a minimum patch size of λ/24 (the smallest patch size to obtain 
a full phase range). Moreover, as evidenced from [6], the gap width between adja­
cent patches must be as small as λ/700 in order to generate sufficient capacitance 
between patches. For such small gap sizes, the highest operating frequencies for 

10.3  The Impact of Etching Tolerance on Reflectarray Performance 
201
0.2 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.05 mm, and 0.025 mm are 2.15, 4.30, 8.57, and 17.14 GHz. 
This immediately suggests the need for a larger lattice size (which runs contrary to 
the goal of subwavelength elements) should one wish to operate at much higher 
frequencies. This assumes one remains with a patch as the element of choice for 
subwavelength behavior.
However, it was shown [7] that subwavelength loops offered superior perfor­
mance over that of the subwavelength patches, requiring gap sizes and loop widths 
as small as λ/100 for lattice sizes of λ/6. For feature sizes of 0.2 mm, 0.1 mm, 0.05 
mm, and 0.025 mm, this corresponds to substantially higher operating frequencies 
of 15, 30, 60, and 120 GHz, respectively. Through the use of novel elements be­
yond that of the subwavelength loop, it is estimated that subwavelength reflectar­
rays operating at 300 GHz are feasible using fabrication techniques that have the 
smallest minimum feature sizes. If 10-μm feature sizes become a reality using inkjet 
printing (i.e., printed electronics), then even basic subwavelength loops can be used 
up to 300 GHz. Judicious selection of reflectarray elements can mitigate the high-
frequency restrictions imposed by electromagnetics.
10.3  The Impact of Etching Tolerance on Reflectarray Performance
Etching tolerance and fabrication repeatability are also important aspects for re­
flectarray fabrication. In particular, we consider the ability of the manufacturing 
process to maintain a particular consistent feature size from prototype to prototype. 
For example, a loop element with a line width of 0.2 mm can readily be fabricated 
using any modern technology, but will it consistently remain 0.2 mm for all fab­
ricated designs? Naturally, no design process produces identical designs in every 
fabrication run and hence it is worthwhile identifying reflectarray elements that are 
immune to small changes in feature sizes.
10.3.1  Narrowband Resonant Elements 
In this example, we consider a reflectarray design with configuration identical to 
that of Section 7.5. The design consists of resonant patch elements in a 12-mm 
lattice. The lengths are selected based on the phase of the ubiquitous S-curve. This 
particular patch element has a phase range of 300°, leading to at most 30° of phase 
error in particular regions of the reflectarray. The phase error over the aperture of 
the reflectarray is shown in Figure 10.1. We then introduce random errors in patch 
length on the order of 0.02 mm, which represents an excellent etching technology 
with very low etching tolerance and a high degree of repeatability. The resulting 
phase error is shown in Figure 10.2 where the majority of discernible phase error 
due to etching errors is found around the center of the reflectarray. The peak phase 
error amounts to 10° in a very small region, leading to a meager gain drop of 0.025 
dB, which is likely inconsequential in most antenna applications. Running thou­
sands of simulated reflectarray designs, each with randomly introduced etching er­
rors of at most 0.02 mm (with variation being uniformly distributed between −0.02 
mm and +0.02 mm), a maximum gain drop of 0.035 dB was obtained, indicating 
that in the worst case, the majority of fabrication processes will lead to negligible 
gain drops due to etching errors for elements types such as patches in the Ku-band. 

202 
������������������������
Fabrication Technologies
Lower frequencies will therefore be less susceptible to etching errors, while higher 
frequencies will be more susceptible, though the maximum gain drop remains quite 
low, even into the subterahertz regime, assuming that similar etching tolerances are 
considered. 
If a very low-cost fabrication technique were required, the reflectarray gain 
would suffer as a consequence. Consider a fabrication technique that would allow 
up to 0.2 mm of etching variation. This is, of course, an outlying scenario as most

element length introduced, post design to simulate fabrication errors (0.02-mm etching variation).

10.3  The Impact of Etching Tolerance on Reflectarray Performance 
203
fabrication techniques have minimum feature sizes on this order and hence the 
tolerance must necessarily be smaller than 0.2 mm. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile 
investigating the consequences of a fabrication process with very low repeatability. 
For such a scenario, the same reflectarray exhibits an average gain drop of 3.8 dB 
and a peak gain drop of 4.3 dB. This is an unacceptable gain drop in mostly any 
antenna design. An example of the phase error associated with a 3.8-dB gain drop 
is shown in Figure 10.3.
10.3.2  Wideband Resonant Elements
If we now consider a wideband element such as the double cross loop (discussed 
throughout the text, such as in Chapter 6), we expect a design resilient to unex­
pected small variations in length. First, the reflectarray has no phase error if etched 
properly because the element provides a full 360° of phase range. Wideband be­
havior tends to translate into insensitivity in varying element dimensions. For the 
double cross loop, an etching variation of 0.02 mm leads to less than a maximum 
of 2° phase error throughout the reflectarray surface (compare this to 10° phase 
error for the patch element). If the length variation were increased to 0.2 mm, the 
resulting average gain drop is approximately 0.3 dB, substantially better than the 
equivalently error-prone patch reflectarray. Examples of the reflection phase error 
on the reflectarray surface comprised of double cross loops for 0.02-mm and 0.2-
mm etching variation are shown in Figures 10.4 and 10.5, respectively. For identical 
etching tolerance, a wideband reflectarray appears to provide resilience in terms of 
electrical performance over that of a narrowband reflectarray. Even in scenarios 
where narrowband behavior offers sufficient performance, the wideband structure 
will provide some measure of additional margin in fabrication tolerance.

element length introduced, post design to simulate fabrication errors (0.2-mm etching variation).

Fabrication Technologies
10.3.3  Subwavelength Elements
Lastly, we consider a recently introduced cell element topology for reflectarrays, 
that of the subwavelength element. Generally speaking, subwavelength elements 
provide wideband behavior and should therefore provide improved immunity to 
electrical performance variation due to etching errors. However, it should be noted 
that subwavelength elements reside within a physically smaller lattice as compared 
to their resonant element counterparts. The consequence is that smaller variations

ing variation).

in physical size lead to similar phase variation as larger lattice elements. This im­
plies that subwavelength elements should be more sensitive to etching variation 
despite having wideband performance. In other words, frequency insensitivity does 
not always equate to insensitivity to physical change. In particular, if etching toler­
ances of 0.02 mm and 0.2 mm were considered one would expect maximum phase 
errors of 4 and 35, corresponding to gain drops of 0.065 dB and 0.95 dB, with 
their phase errors shown in Figures 10.6 and 10.7, respectively. The impact on

ing variation).

variations in element length introduced, post-design, to simulate fabrication errors (0.2-mm etching 
variation).

gain is substantially less than the narrowband patch element, but greater than the 
wideband loop element.
More detailed studies can be performed that include variation of other details 
such as the loop line widths and lattice sizes, all of which will obviously impact 
performance as etching errors are introduced. Nevertheless, it is a sound design 
approach to utilize wideband elements in any scenario where etching errors are 
expected to be considerable.
10.4  Novel Designs Employing the Sole Use of Material Routing
The most common reflectarray consists of printed elements such as patches and 
loops, fabricated using chemical etching. Such a design consists of a mix of materi­
als from the metal ground plane, to the dielectric supporting substrate and finally 
the metal elements that have been etched on the surface of the substrate. However, 
reflectarray designs that consist of dielectrics-only (save for the ground plane) are 
possible. Additionally, it is feasible to design a reflectarray consisting only of metal 
with absolutely no dielectric present in the design. These design approaches can ex­
ploit milling techniques and hence do not require chemical etching nor microwave 
substrates. Consequently, these designs can offer advantageous cost reductions and 
a high degree of environmental ruggedization. 
10.4.1  Dielectric-Only Reflectarrays
It should be stated from the onset that a dielectric-only reflectarray is somewhat of 
a misnomer in that a ground plane must be present to ensure 100% of the incident 
power is reflected. However, given that a ground plane can consist of a simple sheet 
of low-cost aluminum, with the remainder of the reflectarray consisting of dielec­
tric, we feel that dielectric-only is a sufficient description, especially considering all 
of the phase correction is accomplished strictly via dielectric variations. Two major 
types of dielectric-only reflectarrays are possible: (1) consisting of a ground plane 
and bare substrate with dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs) acting as the phasing 
elements [8], and (2) a shaped dielectric surface that is ground plane backed [9].
The DRA-based reflectarray [8] is shown in Figure 10.8(a) while the schematic 
view is shown in Figure 10.8(b). The physical details of the DRA reflectarray ele­
ment are shown in Figure 10.8(c) and the phase versus length curve is shown in 
Figure 10.8(d). The DRA reflectarray in [8] achieved a respectable 12% 1-dB gain 
bandwidth. Future work using LTCC as a fabrication technique would prove useful 
in extending this design beyond the 30-GHz operation. It is also possible to design 
such an antenna in the reverse using dielectric holes (that still act as resonant ele­
ments) rather than dielectric blocks [9]. This has the advantage of being fabricated 
using a milling technique rather than pick and place as is the case of the DRA 
reflectarray (though milling can be used to design the DRA reflectarray as well).
The second class of dielectric-only reflectarrays consists of what is effectively 
a Fresnel zone reflector, or a ground plane-backed Fresnel lens. This concept is 
hundreds of years old, but was recently viewed from the reflectarray perspective 
in [10]. A typical layout of such a reflectarray is shown in Figure 10.9. Generally 
speaking, such a reflectarray is more difficult to fabricate and have a larger profile 

10.4  Novel Designs Employing the Sole Use of Material Routing 
207
than the block or cavity method described previously, although the proposed de­
sign in [10] can be synthesized using transmission line theory (simulations of the 
reflection properties of the dielectric are in fact unnecessary).
10.4.2  Metal-Only Reflectarrays
In a metal-only reflectarray, the entire antenna structure is constructed using metal, 
with the only dielectric being the surrounding media. Two such designs are possible, 
one consisting of a perforated metal plate, with the perforations (grooves, holes, or 
cavities) acting as tunable resonant cavity elements [11] and alternatively a metal 
surface with varying heights to act as a Fresnel reflector (which is to a solid reflector 
what a Fresnel lens is to a solid dielectric lens).
The metal-only reflectarray discussed in [11] consisted of a collection of metal 
rectangular grooves whose dimensions were varied to provide variable reflection 
phase, as shown in Figure 10.10(a). A fairly unique property of this design tech­
nique was the fact that the reflection phase of the variable dimension groove was

derived in a closed form. That is to say, the reflection was determined exactly 
rather than through electromagnetic simulation. The authors further used compu­
tational techniques to better account for the presence of nonuniform collections of 
elements, which differs from the assumed uniform infinite periodicity. Assuming 
the minimum feature sizes can be milled into the solid piece of metal, this form of 
metal-only reflectarray offers an ideal candidate for high aperture efficiency reflec­
tarrays in the subterahertz frequency range. The resulting reflectarray, designed for 
operation at a fairly high frequency of 90 GHz, is shown in Figure 10.10(b).
It is also possible to design a metal-only reflectarray that is the reflecting analog 
to the Fresnel lens. One simply implements a solid reflector, which has a constant 
curvature to its reflecting surface, that has its curvature sectioned every 360°, just 
like the ubiquitous Fresnel lens. While it remains metal-only and very simplistic in 
its design, it is likely more complicated in terms of fabrication and is far more bulky 
than the metal-only design consisting of metal holes from [11].
10.5  Inkjet-Printed Reflectarrays
In this section we discuss the fabrication of a reflectarray using printed electronics. 
Printed electronics hold promise for cost reduction as well as minimum feature sizes 
well below that of conventional chemical etching techniques.
In our example of a reflectarray design, a single-clad substrate is used as a 
support and a very thin bare substrate is printed on and directly bonded to the 
supporting substrate [12]. A reflectarray comprised of subwavelength loops is then 
Figure 10.9  Example of an uneven dielectric-only reflectarray (fundamentally a Fresnel zone reflec­
tor, or ground plane-backed Fresnel lens). (© 2010 IEEE. From: [10].)

designed, with the layout shown in Figure 10.11(a) and a photograph of the fab­
ricated array shown in Figure 10.11(b). The reflectarray pattern was printed using 
a Fujifilm Dimatrix DMP-2831 printer using Novacentrix JS-B25HV silver ink. 
The simulated reflection phase and amplitude are shown in Figures 10.11(c) and 
10.11(d) for the cases of PEC and silver ink loops, respectively. All designs were 
intended for operation at 30 GHz (Ka-band), with measured performance of the 
reflectarray nearing 55% aperture efficiency at center frequency. 
What is of particular importance in this discourse is the fact that all loops in the 
array had line thicknesses of 0.1 mm, nearing the limits of minimum feature size 
when using chemical etching. It is expected that inkjet printing accuracies will con­
tinue to improve and allow for finer features, allowing one to extend well beyond 
the 30-GHz operation into the subterahertz regime. There is also significant prom­
ise for integrating dielectric and semiconductor inks, leading to the fabrication of 
active reflectarrays using a single self-contained fabrication process.

Conclusion and Future Directions 
Printed reflectarray has its roots in exploratory attempts to utilize a nonuniform 
planar array of microstrip patches to emulate a conventional reflector antenna. The 
technology was initially plagued by the relatively high cost of low-loss substrate 
and narrow bandwidth. However, significant strides were taken to overcome these 
shortcomings, as pointed throughout this book. At a deeper level, reflectarray is a 
confluence of phased array and conventional reflector technology. Its similarity to 
phased array arises from low gain radiators that collectively act together to synthe­
size a given radiation pattern while utilization of free space rather than lossy feed 
network distinguishes it from phased array. 
As pointed out in Chapter 2, phase transformation between the phase front 
of the feed radiation and the desired phase front of the synthesized beam can be 
used to determine the phase response of reflectarray cell elements. A look-up table 
is used to map the required phase to some geometrical feature of the cell element. 
An analogous set of concepts and mathematical expressions as developed for the 
calculation of different efficiency figures of a conventional reflector antenna can be 
used to gauge the performance of a reflectarray antenna. However, care should be 
taken to include some additional efficiency figures that are special to a reflectarray 
antenna such as terms that account for dielectric or conductor loss. The possibil­
ity of achieving a wide range phase response from the reflectarray cell elements is 
essential for its efficient performance. General trends were mentioned in Chapter 
2 in terms of the feasibility of realizing the phase range by changing the substrate 
thickness and permittivity.  
Considering reflectarray as a quasiperiodic arrangement of a specific cell ele­
ment opens up avenues for the advancement of analysis and design of such struc­
tures. New developments in the field of periodic structures (frequency selective 
surfaces, artificial dielectrics, and so forth) and also novel radiating elements can 
potentially inspire designer to contrive innovative reflectarray cell elements. For in­
stance, general knowledge on factors that influence the bandwidth of a microstrip 
patch element can be used to improve the bandwidth of a reflectarray comprised 
of such cell elements. Similar conclusion can be drawn by focusing on FSS com­
prised of rectangular patches. Reduced angular sensitivity and wideband behavior 
of an FSS composed of loops can be specifically instructive when considering loop 
as a potential reflectarray cell element. Background knowledge on cell elements, 
periodic structures, and single radiating elements has led to a wide variety of ge­
ometries of reflectarray cell elements, as pointed out in Chapter 3. Different types

Conclusion and Future Directions 
of resonant cell elements such as patch, stacked patch, slot-coupled patch, stub 
loaded patch, and different types of loops were introduced and techniques were 
presented to synthesize a given phase characteristic. Nonplanar three-dimensional 
reflectarray should not be skipped from such a list and a brief account of using a 
dielectric resonator and shorted waveguide were briefly presented as alternative 
cell elements. Future research on resonant elements should focus on multiresonant 
elements and novel methods to engineer frequency dispersion of such elements 
through judicious control of their resonances. Significant background knowledge 
in the field of filter synthesis has gone largely unnoticed in the design of reflectarray 
while this knowledge is instrumental in the synthesis of desired phase response of 
the cell element.
Subwavelength elements have been shown to be advantageous for a number of 
reasons, not limited to their reduced angular sensitivity, improved array discretiza­
tion, low phase dispersion leading to wider bandwidth and reduced losses, array 
thinning, and facilitating the mosaic reflectarrays. These advantages make sub­
wavelength elements ideal candidates for a number of reflectarray applications. Fu­
ture research on subwavelength elements can involve exploiting the fact that a wide 
variety of element shapes have not been fully explored (e.g., the dogbone element), 
which can be used as dispersive elements should the need arise, while keeping some 
of the subwavelength elements’ advantageous properties (e.g., reduced angular sen­
sitivity). Additionally, it is expected that fragmented subwavelength elements will 
prove a fruitful area of exploration as they provide a fairly unrestricted look at the 
geometry of said subwavelength elements.
The freedom to select the cell element can be exploited to realize novel types of 
reflectarrays. Sensitivity of the cell element to the operating frequency and polar­
ization has been utilized to realize multiband and/or multipolarization operation 
as thoroughly described in Chapter 4. Intelligent use of these features can bring 
about significant simplification of the feed structure. Specifically, the reflectarray 
can be designed so that each operating band and/or polarization corresponds to 
a given feed structure. Knowledge from the fields of periodic structures and ra­
diating antenna elements were used to establish low cross coupling between ele­
ments that correspond to a given frequency band and/or polarization. Design of 
a reflectarray cell element was presented that simultaneously converted the linear 
polarization of the feed into circular polarization (CP) and collimated the beam 
that henceforth relieves the designer from the cumbersome and complicated task 
of the design and fabrication of a multiband CP feed. Replacement of the ground 
plane of a reflectarray by FSS was presented as another method to further enhance 
the flexibility multiband operation. The resulting reflectarray was transparent to 
out-of-band signals and reflective only in its operating band. Shaped beam reflec­
tarray was also presented in Chapter 4 through the synthesis of the main reflectar­
ray or subreflectarray. Reflectarray was also shown to be particularly amenable to 
novel applications such as power combining that is achieved by combining incident 
fields of multiple feeds into a given collimated beam. Reflectarray technology will 
prove to be specifically superior for shaped beam and special applications in the 
high-frequency bands that conventional mechanical methods hinder accurate fab­
rication of shaped reflector antennas. One of the outstanding challenges in multi­
band reflectarray is realization of reflectarray with dedicated feeds for Tx and Rx 
bands when these bands are in close proximity to each other (such as X-band). 

Conclusion and Future Directions  
215
Development of dispersion engineering technique will be specifically useful in the 
design of wideband shaped beam structures considering that even the conventional 
robust reflector technology can be handicapped by this restriction. 
In Chapter 5, the presentation of relevant numerical methods for reflectarray 
analysis was used as an opportunity to gain a better understanding of the underly­
ing physics of reflectarray antenna. Having understood discrete nature of scatter­
ing from a periodic structure in the form of Floquet modes raises the possibility of 
designing reflectarray to collimate a higher-order scattered mode [such as (0, −1) 
mode] rather than the direct reflection mode as is the case in conventional reflectar­
ray structures. On the other hand, the available knowledge base on equivalent cir­
cuit for periodic structures can be used to significantly simplify design and analysis 
of reflectarray antennas and also inspire such innovative concepts as array thinning 
in a reflectarray antenna. Methods were also introduced for accurate calculation of 
the radiation pattern of a reflectarray antenna that were not excessively demanding 
in terms of CPU and memory requirements. These routines were used to identify 
the contribution of the each of the constituent components of a reflectarray in the 
formation of the radiation pattern. The infinite-from-finite numerical technique 
was discussed showing promise in determining unique properties of periodic struc­
tures, namely the electromagnetic differences between infinite and finite arrays. It 
was shown that characteristic mode theory can be used in the synthesis of reflec­
tarrays by way of defining a computationally efficient means of obtaining reflec­
tion phase. Optimization of reflectarrays can be made quite efficient using these 
objective functions. Further advancement of numerical methods in the design of 
reflectarrays should focus on exploiting its quasi-periodic feature to obtain a rea­
sonably accurate estimate of its radiation pattern within its operating band through 
utilization of what is technologically available in terms of CPU and memory. These 
numerical methods can be further attuned to further our understanding of the un­
derlying physics of reflectarrays and pave the way for innovative implementations 
of this technology. Currently, the circuit method is specialized to subwavelength 
lattice reflectarray, whereas the range of this technique can be further extended 
to cover also resonant lattice structure to significantly reduce the computational 
requirements of design and analysis. 
Limited bandwidth of reflectarray antennas was a major shortcoming that pre­
vented their application when broadband operation is required. However, signifi­
cant progress has been made in the recent years to circumvent this restriction. As 
pointed out in Chapter 6, the narrow bandwidth is caused by the element band­
width for the case of moderate size reflectarrays, whereas spatial dispersion further 
aggravates this shortcoming in large reflectarrays. Both factors were presented in 
detail and methods were introduced to overcome these limiting factors. As a result 
of these efforts, reflectarray technology has been demonstrated to suit the band­
width requirement of high gain operation at most of the more favorite and widely 
used bands such as X-, Ku-, and Ka-bands. Future advancement of dispersion en­
gineering should focus on development of theoretical framework for wideband, 
multiband large reflectarrays by development of techniques that allow fulfillment 
of multiple constraints at different frequency bands using one and the same set of 
cell elements.
The concept of losses in reflectarrays was discussed in Chapter 7. The general 
conclusion was that the majority of losses stem from dielectric losses occur mainly 

216

Conclusion and Future Directions 
for elements in the vicinity of resonance. To mitigate these losses, it was shown that 
elements exhibiting low-frequency dispersion of reflection phase have low loss­
es. Subwavelength elements were identified as a class of very low-dispersion (and 
hence low-loss) elements. A highly efficient reflectarray was designed, fabricated, 
and measured combining subwavelength elements and a very low-cost, lossy FR4 
substrate indicating that losses can indeed be mitigated. Future work in this regard 
can focus on determining the theoretical implications of loss being inextricably 
tied to the frequency dispersion of reflection phase as well as exploring the use of 
alternative low-cost (but very lossy) materials.
Transmitarray antenna is the dual of a reflectarray antenna in the sense that 
it is transparent at its operating band and collimates the transmit signal that ema­
nates from the feed. In other words, the phase front transformation is applied to 
the transmitted signal. As discussed in Chapter 8, this objective can be achieved 
by a cascade of periodic structures. It is to be noted that all the cell elements with 
same transverse coordinate on the layers are similar and the phase transformation 
is achieved by simultaneous variation of the size of geometrical features of these 
cell elements. Depending on the separation between the layers, different design 
methodologies were presented for the design of a transmitarray. When interlayer 
separation is large enough to warrant application of a cascade of S-parameters 
of layers, full-wave simulations of isolated single layers are used to find complex 
transmission coefficient of the single layer, which is later cast into a cascade of 
S-parameter matrices. However, when the layers are too close to each other, full-
wave simulation should capture all layers. Similar to the developments in the case 
of reflectarray, constituent layers of the transmitarray can be populated by cell ele­
ments to accommodate multiband/multipolarization operation. The thickness of 
the transmitarray can be reduced significantly by enhancing the coupling between 
layers as performed in the case of phase-shifting surfaces. Maintenance of wide­
band performance in the case of transmitarray is far more complicated than reflec­
tarray because both transmission amplitude and phase should be optimized. New 
developments in the case of transmitarray should focus on an efficient method to 
address wideband performance. Intelligent application of filter theory can be quite 
crucial in handling this challenge.
Reflectarray antenna are particularly amenable to the implementation of new 
developments in the field of electronic miniaturization and also novel techniques 
for the adaptive control of circuit components such liquid crystal, laser induced 
plasma, microelecromechanical embedded elements, and microfludic techniques. 
Implementation of a number of these methods was presented in Chapter 9 in order 
to achieve beam steering or beam switching. It was also demonstrated that the same 
objective can be fulfilled by devising elaborate mechanical movement of reflectar­
ray surface with respect to its ground plane. More advances are expected in this 
field with the development of new fabrication techniques, materials, and devices. 
In Chapter 10, we discussed the various fabrication technologies used for re­
flectarrays. We showed that traditional chemical etching imposes feature size lim­
itations that push the need for alternative techniques such as laser etching and 
printed electronics. These alternative fabrication techniques show great promise in 
pushing the operating regime of reflectarrays into terahertz frequencies.
The strength of reflectarray technology stems from the fact that it can benefit 
from results of intense research in diverse fields. Advances in our understanding of

periodic structures can potentially inspire novel cell elements and new concepts in 
the synthesis of reflectarrays. It can also lead to novel applications. At a more prac­
tical level, research in the areas of new material such smart materials, ferroelectric, 
ferrites, and low-loss substrates leads to reflectarrays with higher efficiency and 
more diverse functionality. Novel fabrication techniques such as printed electronics 
usher exciting possibilities for low-cost integration of active elements into reflectar­
rays to further augment its functionality. In summary, the possibilities for reflectar­
ray technology are very exciting from both theoretical and practical perspectives. 
Future advancements will occur through cross fertilization of research into seem­
ingly unrelated fields.
