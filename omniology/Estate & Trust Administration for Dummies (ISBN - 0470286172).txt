About the Authors
Margaret Atkins Munro, EA, is a tax consultant, advisor, writer, and lecturer 
with more than 30 years’ of experience in various areas of finance and taxa-
tion. She’s an Enrolled Agent, licensed by the federal government to repre-
sent clients in the areas of tax and tax-related issues, and currently operates 
a widely diverse private practice that specializes, among other areas, in trust 
and estate accounting and income taxation. A classic example of living a life 
that doesn’t follow the plan set out in college, Peggy received a B.A. in history 
from The Johns Hopkins University, and has also attended University College, 
Cork, and the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto. She resides 
with her family in Vermont.
Peggy is the author of 529 & Other College Savings Plans For Dummies, and 
the co-author of Taxes (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009) For Dummies. She 
writes a biweekly column on anything and everything to do with money for 
The Montpelier (Vermont) Bridge, and has lectured extensively about taxes 
and tax-related issues. She’s been interviewed on numerous financial and 
tax-related topics by a variety of national media outlets, including CNN Radio, 
Family Circle Magazine, U.S. News and World Report, USA Today, Parents 
Magazine, and the Associated Press.
Kathryn A. Murphy, Esq., is an attorney with more than 20 years’ experi-
ence in the fields of estate planning and administration, including drafting of 
sophisticated estate plans and prenuptial agreements for high-net-worth indi-
viduals. She has also administered many estates and trusts, both large and 
small, and prepared more than her fair share of estate and gift tax returns.
She is a graduate of The University of Michigan, with an A.B. in English 
Language and Literature, received her Juris Doctor from Harvard Law 
School, and is a member of the Massachusetts Bar. Kathy, her daughter, 
Ana, and their poodle, Danny Boy, have recently returned to her home state 
of Michigan after more than 20 years in New England. In her spare time she 
teaches, and is an active member of A Better Life/Moldova, an organization 
devoted to improving the lives of abandoned children in Moldova (www.
abetterlifemoldova.com). Kathy is the co-author of Taxation of Estates 
and Trusts (Michigan Continuing Legal Education), and Estate and Trust 
Administration (Michigan Continuing Legal Education). She has also lectured 
on these topics for Michigan Continuing Legal Education. Her writing is an 
outgrowth of two of her loves: literature and the law.


Dedication
To my dear friend Howard, who gave me the idea for this book, even though 
he didn’t know it at the time, and to the memory of his parents Harry and 
Molly. And to Colin and Jacob, who supported me wholeheartedly as I 
worked on it.
—Margaret Atkins Munro
To my daughter, Ana, who inspires me in many ways. And to my friend, 
Peggy, for asking me to join her in this adventure.
—Kathryn A. Murphy
Acknowledgments
First and foremost, our thanks to Mike Baker, Joyce Pepple, and Diane Steele 
at Wiley, who really listened to this idea one afternoon at lunch and then ran 
with it. Without them, this book would still be a figment of our imaginations. 
And many thanks as well to our technical editor Jim Casement, our copy 
editor Megan Knoll, and especially to Chad Sievers, our project editor, who 
was patience personified as we handed him chapters that were hugely longer 
than scheduled. We could hear him gulping on the other end of the phone, 
but he never complained. 
We’ve both had many mentors over the years, among them Palmer Worthen 
and Frederick Keydel, who were responsible for steering us into our careers 
in trust and estate administration and planning. And we must, of course, 
thank all our friends in the Private Client and Trust Group and the Fiduciary 
Department at Goulston & Storrs, PC, where the two of us met 19 years ago 
and began our long friendship.
Last, but certainly not least, our gratitude to Melinda Haskins, who assisted 
us in so many important ways. This book is as much a testament to her 
efforts as it is to our own.

Introduction
T
his country is aging. Fewer babies are being born, and people are living 
longer and longer. They’re also managing to accumulate more and more 
wealth. Wealth is relative; two generations ago, a middle-income family 
owned a house and maybe a car and perhaps even had a little money in the 
bank. Today, that scenario has become much more complicated. Many who 
would never consider themselves wealthy now own more than one home and 
have investments in the stock market, retirement accounts that continue on 
after death, and debt up to their eyeballs.
With this increased complexity in financial affairs comes a parallel complex-
ity in transferring all these accumulated assets to the next generation(s), 
either at death or before. In the past, heavy-duty trusts were only for the 
very wealthy; today, they’ve become part of the legal landscape for ordinary 
Americans. And because ours is a do-it-yourself society in so many aspects, 
that I-can-do-it-myself attitude has carried over into trust and estate admin-
istration. Why, many people ask, should they pay someone else to do work 
that they themselves can perform just as well for a fraction of the cost?
And that’s why we’ve written this book. Between the two of us, we have 
almost 60 years of estate and trust administration experience, and though we 
want to think we’ve seen it all, we accept that some surprises still lurk behind 
corners, waiting to pounce on us. Still, we’ve come across some unusual situ-
ations in our careers and devised ways to avoid standard pitfalls that await 
the unwary. We’ve written this book to share with you some of this accumu-
lated wisdom — to help you to avoid the mistakes that we’ve made (or nar-
rowly avoided).
About This Book
Estate & Trust Administration For Dummies is the practical reference for those 
who find themselves thrust into a position of great power and authority 
(okay, not-so-great power and authority) after they’ve been appointed as 
executor, administrator, or personal representative of an estate, or as trustee 
of a trust. In these pages, you can find advice on what to do — and what to 
avoid — as you acquire, manage, and dispose of assets that belong to the 
estate or trust you’re administering.

2
Estate & Trust Administration For Dummies 
The world of estate and trust administration is one that can baffle you 
before you ever get out of the starting gate. You’re asked to make decisions 
literally before you’ve had the opportunity to process that your friend or 
family member has died. In those first days after a death, when so much of 
the world seems like it’s at sixes and sevens, you need to decide about the 
funeral, collect house keys, find the decedent’s last will — the list seems 
endless, and so are the opportunities to have seemingly innocuous items fall 
through the cracks.
That’s where this book comes in. We designed it to explain how you can 
administer an estate or trust by yourself. It gives you guidelines on what 
aspects of the work you can undertake on your own, and which areas you 
really want to ask for an expert to help you.
Simply put, Estate & Trust Administration For Dummies is a way to create and 
follow a road map toward successfully completing your appointed task with-
out ripping out your hair and running into the streets screaming. You can use 
this book in a variety of ways:
 
✓ As a reference: Everything’s here, whether you have questions about 
probate, taxes, or how to plan a funeral. The world of trusts and estates 
can seem complicated, but it’s all governed by common sense and rules 
(and plenty of them).
 
✓ As an advisor: Some problems may seem unsolvable when you first con-
front them, but rarely is that truly the case. This book can help you find 
what questions you need to ask and who you should look to for answers. 
It gives you solid advice that you can literally take to the bank and lets 
you know when you would be better served by seeking professional 
advice.
 
✓ As a little light reading: We’ve always found it amazing that anyone 
could find what we do is boring. It’s not! Read on to discover examples 
of the mildly wacky and truly insane situations we’ve found ourselves in.
We try to give you as complete information as possible, but trust and estate 
administration covers a lot of ground, much of it very complex. Still, we have 
to warn you that every situation is different, and periodically having a pro-
fessional check your progress in administering any estate or trust is never a 
bad idea. At best, he or she will confirm that you’re doing a brilliant job; at 
worst, the pro will catch any mistakes you may be making before they have a 
chance to become really serious.

 Introduction
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through this book, we use the following conventions:
 
✓ Italics emphasize and highlight new words or terms that are defined.
 
✓ Boldfaced text indicates keywords in bulleted lists or the action part of 
numbered steps. It also flags the names of specific tax documents so you 
can find them easily in any discussion.
 
✓ Monofont is used for Web addresses.
What You’re Not to Read
In today’s busy world, we know your time is valuable. Of course we’d love 
for you to read every single word we’ve written, but we’re also realistic and 
understand that you probably only have time for just the need-to-know infor-
mation. If you’re overwhelmed and want just the essentials, you can safely 
skip the sidebars without missing any vital info. The sidebars are the shaded 
gray boxes that delve deeper into a particular topic, or provide examples or 
interesting info that’s slightly off the subject to reinforce and illustrate a con-
cept. If you skip them, you can still understand our point.
Foolish Assumptions
The world of estates and trusts is rife with assumptions, foolish and other-
wise. Here are some of the assumptions we’ve made about you:
 
✓ You’re not a professional trustee or executor, or a trust or estate admin-
istrator already (although even if you are, you should find the informa-
tion in this book helpful).
 
✓ You probably have no idea what you bit off when you agreed to act as 
either an executor or trustee, but you’re eager to find out.
 
✓ You’re not scared of hard work, both physical and mental, and you’re 
not afraid to delegate. You can do much of what needs to be done in 
administration yourself, whether it’s prying up floorboards in search of 
the secret money stash or creating a probate account, but you recognize 
that sometimes paying someone else to do a task you feel unprepared to 
tackle makes perfect sense.
If you find yourself identifying with any of the above, Estate & Trust 
Administration For Dummies gives you the information you need to start at 
the beginning and work your way through to the end of any trust or estate.

Estate & Trust Administration For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
It really wasn’t difficult to organize this book because it naturally split itself 
into its component parts: defining a whole lot of terms and types of trusts 
you may not be familiar with, estate administration, trust administration, and 
finally transfer tax and income tax issues. The following outlines each part.
Part I: Discovering the World 
of Estates and Trusts
What we both discovered when we first landed in law offices and started 
administering estates and trusts was that lawyers, judges, and just about 
everyone else involved spoke in code. Not only did they use words like 
whereas and hereunder in general conversation, but they also threw around 
terms like administratrix, CRATs, CRUTs, GRITs, and QPeRTS like confetti 
at a wedding. In this part, not only do we give you the terminology that any 
executor or trustee worth his or her weight knows, but we also explain who 
all the players are in estates and trusts (and, in the case of trusts, exactly 
what games are being played).
Part II: Administering an Estate
Administering an estate is a multistep — sometimes simultaneous-step — 
operation that requires an eye for detail and sometimes a great deal of 
patience. In this part, we take you from soup to nuts: figuring out what the 
decedent owned (and owed), locating the necessary documents, figuring 
out who inherits, shepherding the estate through the probate process (if 
necessary), distributing what’s left after everyone who has a claim against 
the estate has been paid, and closing the estate for good. It may seem like a 
monumental task, but taking it one step at a time, even if those steps go in 
directions you’d rather not, leads you inevitably to the conclusion you want.
Part III: Operating a Revocable 
or Irrevocable Trust
Your duties as a trustee are different than the duties of an executor, and the 
scope of the work is generally less intense, though it takes longer. In this 
part, we acquaint you with what powers you have as trustee and what duties 
you’re expected to perform. We explore your relationship to the trust’s ben-
eficiaries and how to keep it cordial. Plus, we explain how to keep the neces-
sary records and how to terminate the trust after its job is done.

5
 Introduction
Part IV: Paying the Taxes
Because the IRS considers trusts and estates separate entities, you have the 
enviable task of making sure you file all necessary tax returns (and on time.) 
In this part, we walk you through preparation of a simple estate tax return 
(Form 706), and through the annual income tax returns for trusts and estates 
(Form 1041). We also explain what you need to know to prepare the dece-
dent’s final Form 1040. Finally, we show you how to report to beneficiaries 
any income you may have distributed to them so they in turn can declare 
that information on their Form 1040.
Part V: The Part of Tens
What would a For Dummies book be without the Part of Tens? In this part, we 
discuss ten mistakes that are easy to make but, with a little planning, even 
easier to avoid, and the ten different types of taxes a trust or estate may be 
liable for. And, in case that wasn’t enough, we’ve also included two appen-
dixes. The first is a glossary. The second is a state-by-state list of basic rules 
of intestacy (dying without a valid last will), plus current state estate tax rules 
(and where you can find more information and forms, if necessary). Just a 
quick note of caution: the intestacy rules are far more complex than what 
we were able to include in the appendix. If you’re administering an intestate 
estate, be sure to consult with the probate court or a qualified attorney as to 
the disposition of that particular estate.
Icons Used in This Book
The little pictures in the margins are icons. Here’s what they mean:
 
So much to remember, so little time: This icon alerts you to important infor-
mation you really don’t want to ignore.
 
Of course, you want to manage all the administration tasks yourself. But some 
you’re just not qualified for, and others — take our word for it — you really 
do want to have someone who knows cast a hairy eyeball over. When you see 
this icon, you’ve just come across an item we suggest you don’t attempt with-
out assistance. Remember, flying without a safety net is unnecessary and usu-
ally unwise.
 
Estate and trust administration can get pretty technical, if you let it (or if 
you want it to). Check out this icon for specific information regarding rules, 
regulations, and especially Internal Revenue Code references.

Estate & Trust Administration For Dummies 
 
We’ve both picked up lots of techniques through hard experience, and we’re 
happy to share them with you. This icon points out administration gems that 
will only make your life easier if you can use them. Remember, though, that 
not every trust or estate will need every tip that comes your way; make sure it 
applies to your situation before you use it.
 
In a nutshell, this icon tells you what to avoid when administering a trust or 
estate.
Where to Go from Here
This book isn’t intended as a must-read-cover-to-cover sort of tome, nor will 
you be able to pass a trusts and estates course in law school just because 
you read it. You may choose to read only what interests you, and ignore the 
rest. You can get in and get out wherever and whenever you choose. If impor-
tant information relating to a particular topic is located elsewhere, the text 
will send you there, so you never need to worry that you’re missing basic 
information because you skipped a portion of the book. Of course, you may 
discover that it’s just a page turner, and every topic fascinates you, in which 
case you may want to apply to law school posthaste (after you finish the 
book, of course).

Part I
Discovering the 
World of Estates 
and Trusts

In this part . . .
H
ave you just found out you’ve been appointed as an 
executor, administrator, trustee, or some other sort 
of fiduciary? Are you baffled by what this all means? 
Confused by language that everyone else seems comfort-
able using? We may not be able to explain quantum phys-
ics to you, but we’re ready, willing, and able to tell you 
everything you could possibly want to know about estates 
and trusts. We walk you through the terminology, alert 
you to who everyone is in relation to yourself, and explain 
what your responsibilities are. Finally, when you’re feeling 
a little out of your depth (and it happens to all of us, so 
don’t be dismayed), we map out the sources of help avail-
able to you.

Chapter 1
Functioning in a Fiduciary World
In This Chapter
▶ Becoming comfortable with the terminology surrounding estates and trusts
▶ Encapsulating estates
▶ Taking care of trusts
▶ Preparing and filing tax returns for trusts, estates, and decedents
You may have known for a while that someone close to you has named you 
as the executor of his or her will, as the trustee of a trust he or she’s cre-
ated, or even as both. That knowledge may make you feel extremely honored 
while that person’s alive and kicking and still able to look after his or her assets.
Those warm and fuzzy feelings may come crashing to a halt, though, the day 
you hear your friend has passed away, and you’re now in charge of the show. 
All eyes will be on you as you pick up the reins and try to keep this buggy 
called an estate or trust moving along at a steady clip, while keeping all the 
promises written down during your friend’s lifetime. The responsibility is 
huge, but so is your potential satisfaction, as you honor his wishes after he is 
no longer around to appreciate your actions.
This chapter is a jumping-off point for understanding what an estate adminis-
trator or trustee actually does: assume control of someone else’s affairs in a 
way that’s both sensitive to family dynamics and responsive to family needs. 
Mishandled, estate and/or trust administration can cause permanent family 
rifts; on the other hand, competent and careful management helps to keep 
family memories happy and purpose intact.
Getting a Handle on Who’s Involved
Administering a trust or estate isn’t rocket science, but it does have its own 
language. One of the biggest stumbling blocks you run across, especially as 
you’re beginning in your new role, is figuring out who all the players are and 
what roles they all play. This section points out some important basic lingo 
you need to know as you start your journey. Refer to the other chapters in 
Part I for more on your responsibilities as an administrator or trustee.

10
Part I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Identifying an estate’s fiduciaries
Several kinds of fiduciaries (people or corporations who hold and administer 
assets of one person, either living or deceased, for the benefit of another) 
may be involved in estate administration, depending upon whether a will 
exists and who the heirs are. You may not even be the only fiduciary; in that 
case, you and the other(s) must act in unison. And one person or group can 
fulfill multiple fiduciary roles, such as when one person is named both execu-
tor and trustee. The following are types of fiduciaries you may be named:
 
✓ Executor: The executor is the person named in the will to “execute” the 
will — to carry out the wishes of the person making the will, including 
disposing of the property according to the will. A female executor is 
sometimes referred to as an executrix, though we don’t make this dis-
tinction in this book. A named executor may decline to act, although we 
hope this book gives you the confidence to embrace the role.
 
✓ Administrator: The administrator is a person appointed by the probate 
court to administer the decedent’s estate when the decedent left no 
valid will. A female administrator may be referred to as an administratrix.
 
✓ Personal representative: The personal representative is a general term 
for both the executor and the administrator. In some states, this term is 
used in place of executor or administrator.
 
✓ Guardian: A guardian is the person appointed by the probate court to 
take care of the person and the property of another person who is con-
sidered incapable of taking care of his or her own affairs because of his 
or her age (usually a minor) or for other reasons such as mental illness, 
mental retardation, physical incapacity, or illness.
 
✓ Conservator: Similar to a guardian, but with less restrictive rules than 
those for a guardian. For example, the probate court may appoint a con-
servator for someone who can’t properly care for his or her property 
due to mental weakness or physical incapacity, for a person missing in 
action or a prisoner of war, or for a mentally retarded person.
 
 A probate court rarely appoints a conservator for an estate, especially if 
you’ve already been appointed as executor or administrator; however, 
you may find yourself dealing with an already-appointed conservator 
of an estate beneficiary. Remember, just because you’re all working 
with the same set of assets doesn’t mean you belong to the same team. 
As executor or administrator, you’re only responsible for the property 
owned by the decedent; a beneficiary’s conservator is responsible for 
the that beneficiary’s interest.

11
 Chapter 1: Functioning in a Fiduciary World
Knowing who the trustees are
A trust, just like an estate, must have a fiduciary heading up its team: in this 
case, a trustee. The trustee of a trust is charged with the task of investing the 
trust’s assets, and balancing the desires of the trust’s creator (the grantor, 
also referred to as the settlor) with the needs of the beneficiary (the person 
or organization entitled to receive the income earned by the trust’s assets) 
and the wants of the remainderman (the person or organization who receive 
what’s left of the trust’s assets after the trust period ends). It may sound 
daunting, but when done properly, everyone should go home happy.
 
Because balancing these competing interests can be complicated, many 
grantors choose two or more individuals and/or corporations to act together 
as co-trustees, jointly filling these roles, assigning general powers to all and 
sometimes specific additional powers to certain trustees. In order to differen-
tiate between the trustees, trustees often are designated as either independent 
or family. This section discusses these two types of trustees. Chapter 3 goes 
into more depth about the different types of trusts and how they operate.
All by themselves: Independent trustees
Independent trustees, or fiduciaries who aren’t named in the trust as either 
grantor, beneficiary, or remaindermen, can be an important cog in keeping 
the wheels of a trust running smoothly. Whether they’re trusted friends of the 
grantor or are banks, trust companies, lawyers (or law firms), or accountants 
(or accounting firms), independent trustees owe their primary allegiance to the 
grantor, who is relying on them to make decisions that best serve the interest 
of the trust, rather than that of any beneficiary or remainderman.
Frequently, grantors direct an independent trustee to make all decisions 
regarding discretionary distributions to beneficiaries, especially if one of the 
trust beneficiaries is also a trustee. And, in the case of testamentary trusts, the 
probate court often delegates the power to make discretionary distributions to 
the independent trustee alone so as to remove any semblance of self-serving 
from a trustee who also has a beneficial or remainder interest in the trust.
For example, one of us acts as trustee for a testamentary trust where the 
decedent’s widow (who is the income beneficiary) and two children (the 
remaindermen) are also trustees. Only the independent trustee may make 
decisions regarding distributions of principal to the widow or the children. 
Distributions to the children prior to their mother’s death require either the 
consent of the independent trustee or the probate judge.

12
Part I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
No independent trustee assumes the responsibilities lightly. As a result, 
expect to pay for their services, unless the independent trustee is a close 
friend of the grantor, who may be willing to perform this service out of long 
friendship and the goodness of her heart. Banks and trust companies most 
likely have pamphlets that list how they calculate their fees; because they 
probably have active custody of the trust assets, they usually collect their fees 
automatically from the trust. Non-institutional professional trustees such as 
attorneys and accountants bill you for their services. They may charge based 
on their normal hourly rates, but they’re more likely to calculate their fees 
based on a percentage of the market value of the assets of the trust as well as 
a percentage of income collected.
Trusts that mandate an independent trustee typically also include a line of 
succession so that if one trustee is no longer able to act, another is in line to 
take his or her place. If the trust requires an independent trustee, make sure 
that any vacancies are filled promptly, because it’s next to impossible for the 
trust to function efficiently without one in place.
All in the family: Family trustees
Trust grantors often feel that using only professional trustees (as efficient 
as they may be) may not account for special family circumstances. In these 
cases, the grantor may choose to also have a family trustee, or a trusted 
member of his or her family, who knows the players (the beneficiaries and 
the remaindermen) well and has no difficulty making decisions based on the 
grantor’s wishes.
Family trustees usually have most of the same powers as independent trustees 
(such as investment powers and the authority to prepare and sign income tax 
returns and to make scheduled distributions to income beneficiaries), except 
that their powers over discretionary distributions are often limited if they have 
any vested interest in the trust as a beneficiary or remainderman.
 
It’s possible for trusts to exist with only a family trustee, although the results 
are sometimes messy. Somehow, wherever money is concerned, perceptions 
of appropriate behavior on all sides tend to skew; in our opinion, you’re far 
better off to limit opportunities for self-serving during trust administration by 
never allowing a family trustee to serve alone. With the addition of an indepen-
dent trustee, everyone concerned — from the grantor  to the trust beneficiary 
to the trust remaindermen — can be confident that all the competing interests 
were considered throughout administration and that the trustees made appro-
priate and fair decisions.
 
Another bad idea: having family members be sole trustees of a trust estab-
lished for their benefit. Unless the trustee/beneficiary is only entitled to 
mandatory distributions of all the income annually (and principal distribu-
tions made under very limited circumstances), the assets of the trust can be 
included in the trustee/beneficiary’s taxable estate at the time of his or her 

13
 Chapter 1: Functioning in a Fiduciary World
death, even though the trust property would never be included in the probate 
estate. If there’s also an independent trustee, the grantor can give far more 
flexibility to that trustee to make distributions of income and principal to the 
beneficiary, and the trust assets still won’t be included in that beneficiary’s 
taxable estate upon his or her death.
And, even though the surviving spouse may be the sole trustee of a marital 
trust for his or her benefit (after all, the property in the marital trust at the 
time of the surviving spouse’s death will be included in his or her taxable 
estate anyway), in practice, we’ve seen few trusts where there isn’t also an 
independent trustee, if only for ease of administration. If the surviving spouse 
is the beneficiary of a trust other than the marital trust, an independent 
trustee can provide more flexibility in distributions to the surviving spouse 
without having the trust assets included in his or her estate.
Lining up your team
No matter whether you’ve just been named as the fiduciary, or you’re the 
fiduciary’s trusted advisor, you’ll probably have times when you really want 
someone else to explain your options to you or set out the potential pros and 
cons of a decision you must make. Creating a team of professional advisors 
before you need the advice is the best way to ensure that, when the time 
comes to make those decisions, you’re able to ask the advice and move for-
ward in a clear and measured manner. Chapter 4 lists the types of advisors 
you may want to employ and explains how they can help you administer a 
trust or estate without your surrendering all the fun to them.
Estate of Change: Delving into Estates
The day a person dies, you’re sure to have more on your mind than the fact 
that you’ve just assumed a new role — that of the person designated to wrap 
up the decedent’s affairs. And yet even while you’re wrestling with your per-
sonal feelings about the loss, you’re somehow supposed (and expected) to 
start tossing all the various balls in the air. You may find yourself planning 
a funeral at the same time that you’re creating the estate’s calendar, collect-
ing keys to the residence (if the decedent has no surviving spouse), buying 
the food for the after-funeral collation (light meal), and figuring out what the 
decedent owned and owed.
In this section, we walk you through all the steps of administering an estate. 
Just remember, when all the advice begins to leave you breathless, priori-
tizing can mean the difference between keeping your sanity and running 
screaming into the sunset. (Check out Part II for more info.)

Part I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Changing the status quo
Although losing a friend or loved one may be difficult, you need to realize 
that the person’s status is static. Your loved one is dead; your status, as 
administrator or executor has also been altered, but that alteration will con-
tinue to morph through the process. You’re now responsible for the estate 
and the decedent’s assets and liabilities.
Chapter 5 walks you through the first steps in your legal role. We help you to 
dive into the decedent’s affairs, as you try to gain a sense of what the dece-
dent owned, who he or she owed money to, and who inherits what’s left. You 
create a calendar with all the estate’s important deadlines listed prominently, 
and you discover the documents, both ones that were created before the 
decedent’s death and others that you obtain after death, that you need in 
order to start moving this estate forward.
Probating an estate
Probate, a word that strikes terror in many hearts, is a fairly straightforward pro-
cess of providing court supervision to your administration of an estate. Probate 
exists for your protection as executor as much as to protect the interests of the 
estate’s heirs and legatees. With the probate court judge standing between you 
and the heirs, you have the opportunity to do your job unmolested. And, as you 
do that job, the judge and the court staff check your steps and help you when 
you need it, making sure that you’re doing everything you should. As the execu-
tor of the estate, you’ll start the process by filing the decedent’s last will, if there 
is one, and applying for administration. You can’t finish until the court tells you 
that you can, when you file the final account, and it’s allowed.
In Chapter 6, you work your way through the probate process, including get-
ting appointed as executor, administrator or personal representative; filing 
the last will, if one exists; notifying heirs and creditors; and completing the 
legal documents you’re required to file with the court.
Collecting the estate’s assets
Most of the fun in administering an estate (at least, we think so), is digging 
for buried treasure. As the executor, you need to accurately assess all the 
estate’s assets so you can make a plan for the estate. Without knowing what’s 
there, you won’t know if you’ll be required to file an estate tax return, or what 
kind of probate administration you’ll need to do.
Chapter 7 tells you where and how to dig, including in some fairly unex-
pected places, and what to do with those assets after you find them. You also 

15
 Chapter 1: Functioning in a Fiduciary World
discover how to value property, including when you can do it yourself and 
when you’re better served to have an expert help you.
Paying expenses and making distributions
Just because the decedent isn’t living doesn’t mean he or she doesn’t still 
have expenses. After all, the electricity in the house wasn’t turned off at the 
moment of death, and any mortgage on the residence still needs paid. In addi-
tion, the new entity, the estate, begins accumulating its fair share of costs, 
whether for accounting and investment services, or lawn mowing. In fact, 
the estate expenses may end up looking similar to the decedent’s before his 
or her death. As the executor, you’re responsible for making sure that all 
the decedent’s and estate’s bills are paid. Chapter 8 takes you through the 
expenses you may run across, including the funeral arrangements, the first 
expense most people think about in relation to death.
After you pay all the estate’s bills, you’re free to pay off everyone the dece-
dent listed in his or her last will (or the heirs-at-law if he or she died without 
a valid last will). In Chapter 8, you also discover how to slice up what remains 
of the pie, in what order you make payments, how to transfer property other 
than cash, and how to mathematically make divisions of property when the 
dividing line isn’t entirely clear.
Tying up the estate’s loose ends
Even after you’ve paid everyone who needs to be paid, you still need to tidy 
some odds and ends before you can close the estate and move on. Chapter 9 
walks you step by step through all the final actions that will bring the estate 
to a close. You find out what you need to file with the probate court, the IRS, 
and the decedent’s resident state tax authority to obtain the letters releasing 
you from further responsibility. You also discover all the final flourishes that 
will bring the estate you’ve administered so well to its natural conclusion.
Managing a Trust
Unlike an estate, which only exists for a relatively short period of time (we 
hope), trusts can continue on for decades, or even longer, depending on the 
terms of the trust and the ages of all the participants. And because you’re 
involved for the long haul, the lists of what you need to do, in the short term 
and on an ongoing basis are different. This section highlights some of the 
main tasks you have to do as a trustee. Whether you’ve just been appointed 
as trustee or you’ve been one for a while but still have questions, you can 
check out Part III for complete answers.

16
Part I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Comprehending your duties as trustee
When you agree to act for someone as a trustee, more is involved than just 
signing on the dotted line, and then walking away. You’re now obligated to 
do your best for the grantor in carrying out his or her wishes, as set forth in 
the trust instrument. The trust instrument clarifies and specifies your duties. 
Chapter 10 discusses these types of duties. You grapple with the limits of 
fiduciary responsibility and discover what it means to honor the grantor’s 
intent. And you explore how to invest the trust assets so that you not only 
protect the trust principal but also produce the income that the income ben-
eficiary has a right to expect.
Putting assets into trust
If you’ve finally reached the stage where it’s time to transfer assets into a 
trust, either your own or someone else’s, you need to know and follow cer-
tain rules in order to make a smooth transition from individual ownership to 
trust ownership. Chapter 11 explains how to smoothly make those transfers, 
whether during the grantor’s lifetime or after his or her death.
Putting the trust to work
After you transfer the assets into the trust, you as trustee have to create an 
investment plan that balances income production and growth against risk. 
Remember, the money in the trust isn’t yours to play with, so you can’t make 
any ridiculous gambles with it. Still, taking a keep-it-safe-and-in-the-bank 
approach isn’t smart either because the income beneficiary has a right to 
(and will) expect income from the trust.
Chapter 12 gives you the pros and cons of a variety of investment options, as 
well as clueing you in to some current investment theories. It also shows you 
how to factor in beneficiary needs when determining how best to invest trust 
assets. Finally, it gives you a heads-up as to what sorts of fees the trust will 
incur — fees that you have to factor into your calculations when you deter-
mine how much, if anything, you can pay to the beneficiaries.
Discovering the point of the trust
A trust’s purpose, and your mission, is to balance income generation for the 
benefit of the current income beneficiary (and principal distributions, when 
permitted) with principal protection for the remainder interest. Chapter 13 
is where you unearth the extra information you may want to consider as 
you handle this balancing act, such as the beneficiary’s health, education, or 

17
 Chapter 1: Functioning in a Fiduciary World
other extraordinary circumstances. Figuring out which life events warrant 
additional distributions may be the trickiest part of trust administration. In 
Chapter 13, you also discover why many trustees are likened to kindly rela-
tives, as you attempt to uncover all that you can about the income, or cur-
rent beneficiary (without being accused of stalking).
Compiling and organizing trust records
You’ve done all the tricky stuff, but you still must track the activity correctly. 
Keeping records, though not difficult, isn’t particularly fun or exciting, so 
many people get sloppy about it. Our advice to you: Keep ’em neat! Staying 
on top of your recordkeeping means never finding yourself buried in an ava-
lanche of paper you’re not quite sure what to do with. Chapter 14 tells you 
how to maintain the trust’s records with a minimum of fuss and bother.
Bringing the trust to its conclusion
Trusts sometimes seem to go on forever, but the day (usually) eventually 
comes when all trusts must come to an end. When that day comes for the trust 
you’re administering, you need to know how to tie up all the loose ends neatly, 
like preparing and filing the final tax returns and accounts and making the final 
distributions of the remaining income and assets. You’ve done a great job up 
until now — it would be a shame to ruin your track record at this late date.
Chapter 15 explains how to terminate a trust with a minimum of fuss and 
bother. And call us crazy, but for us, life doesn’t get much better than when 
we’ve received the last assent to that final trust account, the one on which 
the ending balance is zero!
Paying Uncle Sam
Taxes in estates and trusts can be pretty involved. Why? Because you’re not 
only dealing with income taxes (and we know how much everyone loves to 
deal with income taxes), but you may also be responsible for preparing and 
filing Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) 
Tax Return. This section gives an overview on Form 706 and the estate and 
trust income tax return (Form 1041), as well as the decedent’s final Form 
1040. Check out Part IV for everything you ever wanted to know about estate 
and trust tax forms.

18
Part I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Compiling the estate tax return
Not every estate is required to file Form 706, but if you’re responsible for one 
that is, dive right into Chapter 16, which takes you on a stroll through the 
lengthy estate tax return. Although the blank return may seem formidable, 
you may find that with the help of this chapter and the Form 706 instructions 
you’re able to prepare all, or at least large chunks, of the return yourself. 
Chapter 17 goes into more depth and walks you through the many schedules 
associated with Form 706. Give yourself some credit and take a stab at Form 
706; you’ll probably be surprised by how far you get. Even if you do end up 
taking this return to a professional, you gain a much better handle on all the 
assets and expenses of the estate by first attempting it yourself.
Figuring out the income taxes
Whether you are administering a trust or are involved in an estate, you have 
to file annual income tax returns as long as either entity owns assets that 
are producing income. If you’re the executor of an estate, you may also be 
responsible for filing the decedent’s final income tax return (or maybe even 
his or her final two tax returns, depending on when he or she died). We have 
you covered.
Discover how fiduciary income taxes differ from personal income taxes in 
Chapter 18, and find out what quirks exist for the decedent’s final return(s). 
Armed with a Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, in 
one hand, and this chapter in the other, you can work your way through trust 
or estate return preparation on a line-by-line basis.
Whipping together Schedule K-1
Tax forms can be intimidating, especially unfamiliar ones. And Schedule K-1, 
Beneficiary’s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc., may seem over-
whelming. But it’s really not. In Chapter 19, see how the information from 
Form 1041 translates to Schedule K-1 when you’ve made distributions to a 
beneficiary from either a trust or estate. After you figure out how to make the 
calculations, it almost becomes fun (well, at least for us, but then we’re an 
accountant and an attorney.)

W
hen you’re named as executor or administrator of an estate for the first 
(or second or third) time, you may have some questions as to what, 
exactly, an estate is, and about the whole probate estate and estate tax pro-
cess in general. Before you can administer an estate, you need to have a firm 
grasp of what an estate is. Don’t worry, though — you don’t have to become an 
estate and trust attorney. We provide you with the ABCs of estates right here. 
Consider it your entry-level course to understanding the basics on estates.
This chapter defines many of the terms associated with estates, lays out the pro-
cess of determining who inherits, and explains the difference between the estate 
as it’s defined for probate purposes and for estate tax purposes. So read on, dip 
your toe in, or take the plunge — we think you’ll have a firmer grasp on estates.
Defining the Estate for Probate 
Administration Purposes
In order to administer an estate, you want to know what you’re administer-
ing. Although an estate may appear to be a confusing legal entity, you don’t 
need to be concerned about all the technicalities. All you need to know is 
that an estate is all the assets a person owns at his or her death that are subject 
to probate administration (proving to a probate court that the will is genuine). 
Chapter 6 walks you through the specific stages of the probate process.

20
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
So what types of assets comprise an estate? Check out the following:
 
✓ All assets held in the decedent’s (deceased person’s) name alone.
 
✓ All assets the decedent owned as a tenant in common with one or more 
other persons. A tenant in common holds property together with other 
tenants in common, but none of the tenants automatically inherit the 
shares of a tenant who dies. Each tenant holds an equal share of the 
property unless the property title specifies otherwise. Upon the dece-
dent’s death, his or her share becomes subject to probate, even though 
in some states actual title to real estate (if that is what they’re holding) 
passes to the heirs as of the decedent’s death.
 
✓ All assets payable to the estate either because the estate is the desig-
nated beneficiary or the asset has no designated beneficiary, such as life 
insurance on the deceased and employee benefits.
 
✓ Amounts owed to the decedent before death but paid after death, such 
as the decedent’s last paycheck, and other amounts due to the dece-
dent’s estate by reason of his or her death, such as an award from a 
wrongful death lawsuit.
 
✓ Household items, jewelry, and other items that don’t usually have title 
(unless the decedent has, in writing, declared them to belong to his or 
her revocable living trust during life; see Chapter 3 for more on revo-
cable living trusts).
Chapter 7 includes a complete list of assets to look for as executor or admin-
istrator, many of which end up in the probate estate for one of these reasons.
 
If an asset is in the decedent’s name alone for convenience only but really 
belongs to another individual (for instance, if he or she was holding it for a 
relative who is incapacitated), the person claiming ownership of the property 
must furnish proof that it actually belongs to him or her. The asset then goes 
to the actual owner (or his or her representative) instead of becoming part of 
the decedent’s estate for administration or estate tax purposes. For example, 
Mary is listed as the only signer on her disabled daughter Sue’s checking 
account, which is funded solely by Sue’s monthly disability payments. If Mary 
dies, Sue (or someone acting for her if she is unable to act for herself) must 
provide documentation that the account and the money in it actually belong 
to Sue and not Mary. This proof may be in the form of a letter between Sue and 
Mary mentioning the arrangement, check stubs from the disability payments, 
or even bank statements showing that all deposits into the account were for 
Sue, and all payments out were for Sue’s benefit. After that documentation is 
in order, you have the proof you need to exclude this particular bank account 
from Mary’s estate, both for probate and tax purposes.

21
 Chapter 2: Estates 101: Exploring the Ins and Outs of Estates
Most assets that are subject to probate administration come under the supervi-
sion of the probate (or equivalent) court in the place where the decedent lived 
at death. The one exception to this rule is real estate. You must probate real 
estate in the county and state in which it’s located. If the estate you’re respon-
sible for has real estate in another jurisdiction, including out-of-state real estate, 
you unfortunately need to have ancillary administration (separate probate of 
the property in the jurisdiction where it’s located), in addition to probate in the 
decedent’s state of residence. See Chapter 6 for more on determining domicile.
Will Power: Understanding How a Will 
(Or No Will) Affects an Estate
Whether or not the decedent left a will determines what form of probate 
you undertake, and this section gives you a look at the effect of (not) having 
a will. A will requires you to file a petition with the probate court to have 
it admitted to probate. The will probably names you as executor, so you 
don’t have to worry about applying for the job. If the decedent didn’t leave 
a will, you file a petition to administer the intestate estate, and other folks 
who feel they’re just as qualified may file a petition as well. If more than one 
person applies to be administrator, the court decides who gets the privilege. 
Whether the decedent left a will also determines whether the decedent’s 
wishes (with a will) or state laws in the decedent’s state of domicile (with no 
will) determine whom the assets will go to.
Domicile is the decedent’s legal home. It’s decided by a combination of fac-
tors, including where the decedent lived for more than half of the calendar 
year, was registered to vote and registered any cars, plus the address he 
or she used on income tax returns, and many other supporting factors. See 
Chapter 6 for a complete discussion of domicile.
Dying testate
A decedent dies testate if he or she leaves a valid will. The will then under-
goes probate according to the laws of the decedent’s domicile at the time of 
death. The purpose of probate is for the court to rule on the validity of the 
will and supervise the administration of the estate.
What determines the validity of a will? It’s based on individual state law. For 
instance, in most, if not all, states a will writer must be at least 18 years old 
and of sound mind (know as having testamentary capacity). The will must 
(usually) be in writing (typed or handwritten), and signed by the decedent or 
another at the decedent’s direction and in his or her presence. The following 
list gives you an overview of some common types of wills:

22
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
✓ Holographic: A holographic will is written in the decedent’s own hand-
writing, dated, and signed. It’s valid in most, if not all jurisdictions. 
However, people are more likely to challenge it, and if questions come 
up about the decedent’s intentions (which won’t be as clear as in a law-
yer-crafted document), the probate court interprets those intentions.
 
✓ Attested: An attested will is usually prepared and typed by an attorney’s 
office and signed by the decedent and two (or in some states three) wit-
nesses who receive no benefit under the will. This is the most typical 
kind of will.
 
✓ Oral: An oral will (also known as a nuncupative will) is a will spoken 
orally to another person and not written down. A few states recognize 
them in extreme circumstances, such as imminent death.
Other issues affecting validity are whether the testator was under undue 
influence from another in making the will, whether fraud was committed 
against the testator, whether he or she had knowledge of the contents of the 
will, and whether the will is a forgery. If you as executor are aware of any 
issues affecting the validity of the will, or have any doubts as to its validity, 
you should bring this to the attention of the probate court.
Dying intestate
A decedent dies intestate if he or she leaves no will. The laws of intestacy also 
apply if a will turns out to be invalid and the decedent had no prior valid will. 
(Reasons a will may be declared invalid include forged wills, wills not prop-
erly witnessed, a decedent who wasn’t of sound mind when he or she signed 
the will, and fraud or undue influence on the decedent during the writing of 
the will.) If the decedent died intestate, the laws of the decedent’s state of 
domicile govern both how the estate is administered and who inherits the 
estate. Check out the next section, “Eyeing Who Can Inherit,” for more info on 
how intestacy affects the estate.
We’ve both administered estates where the decedent died intestate and 
we’ve experienced challenges to the will. Intestacy can be an unfortunate sit-
uation because the laws of intestacy frequently don’t follow what would have 
been the decedent’s wishes. For example, depending on the decedent’s state 
of domicile, if one spouse dies without a will, the surviving spouse won’t 
inherit everything unless the decedent has no children and, in some cases, 
other blood relatives with claims to the estate. If minor children are involved, 
a court-appointed guardian must hold their shares, with the assets super-
vised by the court until the child reaches adulthood. Of course, often the 
only one that arrangement works out well for is the court-appointed guardian 
of the child’s assets, who may not have even known the decedent, but now 
is not only charged with looking after the care and feeding of the minor child 
but also gets paid (well) by the estate for the privilege.

23
 Chapter 2: Estates 101: Exploring the Ins and Outs of Estates
The court also decides who will be the guardian of the child’s person (who 
will raise the child) if both parents are deceased, or if the court considers the 
surviving parent to be unfit. Note that one person can be guardian of both 
the person and the property of a child, if the court deems that appropriate. 
Sometimes more than one family member (or family friend) feel strongly 
that they are the best person to raise the child, in which case things can get 
messy. Most parents would prefer to make that choice themselves and the 
court will honor their wishes if the court finds it’s in the child’s best interest, 
but we actually know several people who have delayed creating wills because 
they don’t want to face the guardianship question, either because they don’t 
want to offend family members or because they feel they have no good 
choices for guardians.
Eyeing Who Can Inherit
If you’re serving as executor or administrator of an estate, one of the first 
things you need to do is determine who inherits the estate’s assets. If the 
estate has a valid will, determining who gets what is usually straightforward 
because the will sets out who the assets go to. However, wills can be fuzzy 
if they’re not well drafted, and sometimes beneficiaries can be hard to track 
down. If the decedent left no valid will, you have to rely on the laws of intes-
tacy to figure out who gets what.
This section walks you through the people who can potentially inherit some-
thing from an estate.
Surviving spouse
If the decedent was married at the time of his or her death, his or her surviv-
ing spouse becomes a major player in the eventual disposition of the estate 
whether or not the decedent had a valid will. If the estate is will-less, the sur-
viving spouse is entitled to a share of the decedent’s estate as dictated by the 
intestacy laws of the decedent’s state of residence. When there is a valid will, 
the surviving spouse has a choice:
 
✓ He or she can choose to take any inheritance stated under the will.
 
✓ He or she can elect to take against the will — that is, to receive the 
share that he or she is entitled to by statute, known as the statutory 
share, rather than the amount he or she stands to inherit under the will. 
Generally, the spouse’s statutory share isn’t as generous as the spouse’s 
intestate share (the share he or she would receive if the decedent died 
without a will), and they are definitely two different animals

24
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
This section takes a closer look at these choices. Appendix B shows you the 
rules for intestate shares, state by state.
 
In certain instances, such as when the surviving spouse’s own estate is tax-
able without any additions from the decedent’s estate, it may not be in the 
surviving spouse’s best interest for estate tax purposes to accept any inheri-
tance from the decedent. In this case, the surviving spouse should disclaim, 
or refuse by a legal document, any part of either what the decedent left him or 
her under the will or the spousal portion of the estate determined by the intes-
tate statute. See Chapter 8 for details on disclaimers.
Inheriting under the will
In the most common scenario we see, the surviving spouse chooses to inherit 
whatever the will provides for him or her in accordance with the decedent’s 
wishes. Most spouses plan their estates together and execute their wills at 
the same time. They typically have a common purpose in mind: to take care 
of the survivor during his or her lifetime (along with any children if they’re 
minors). Their plans typically mirror each other’s. These sorts of wills are 
often referred to as reciprocal, where each will gives everything (except 
for bequests of specific personal property) to the other and only after the 
second death does the property pass out into the wider family.
Taking against the will
Each spouse has the right to leave his or her property by will to whomever 
he or she wants. To offset that right, the surviving spouse has the right to 
take an amount allowed by statute rather than the amount, if any, left to that 
spouse under the will. For a variety of reasons (such as a second marriage 
where the decedent wants to favor children from a first marriage in his or 
her will, or if the spouses aren’t amicable before the decedent’s death), the 
surviving spouse may get less under the will than he or she would receive 
by taking his or her statutory share. That’s when the surviving spouse may 
decide to take against the will. See Chapter 6 for a fuller discussion of the 
spouse’s decision of whether to take against the will. Don’t forget, this spou-
sal statutory share is not the same beast as the intestate statutory share. 
Though every state has a spousal statutory share, any prenuptial agreement 
(an agreement signed before marriage — think movie stars, billionaires, and 
second marriages) or postnuptial agreement (an agreement signed after mar-
riage) that the surviving spouse signed that set out or limited the amount he 
or she would inherit upon the decedent’s death, that agreement will govern 
(and it no doubt waives the statutory share).
Surviving spouse’s allowance
Most states have a provision for a very minimal surviving spouse’s allow-
ance. For instance, in Massachusetts the surviving spouse has the right to 
live in the home of the decedent for six months, plus an allowance (rarely 
more than $1,000) for necessities. If the decedent’s spouse is also dead, 
minor children may receive an even smaller amount (no more than $100 per 

25
 Chapter 2: Estates 101: Exploring the Ins and Outs of Estates
child in Massachusetts). These amounts are intended to help the surviv-
ing spouse or children through the estate administration period, but the 
amounts are so small that people rarely apply for them. See Chapter 6 for 
more on this provision.
Individuals omitted from 
the decedent’s will
Another group of individuals not included in a will may have a right to inherit 
some assets in an estate. These individuals, called pretermitted heirs, are usu-
ally children or issue of a deceased child (all persons who have descended 
from that child, like a grandchild of the decedent). If the will doesn’t include 
them, they may elect to take the share they would have received under intes-
tacy, unless the decedent provided for them during his or her lifetime or it’s 
shown that the omission was intentional. The purpose of this policy is to avoid 
the unintentional disinheritance of a child or other issue of the decedent.
For example, Robert Kennedy’s youngest child, daughter Rory, was born after 
his death. If in his will, he left bequests to all of his children by name, not 
naming Rory, she could argue that she was left out by mistake and thus was a 
pretermitted heir entitled to her intestate share. Of course, the Kennedys had 
good estate planners, so they would never have named specific children with-
out allowing for ones to be born later, and they used trusts for privacy, so this 
example is just a what if. See Chapter 6 for more on pretermitted heirs.
No such thing as a free ride: Goodbye, 
dower and curtesy
Although the surviving spouse’s statutory 
share has largely replaced the old concepts of 
dower and curtesy, they’re worth mentioning. 
Dower and curtesy (defined in the following 
paragraphs) have now been abolished in most 
states, or replaced by dower for both surviv-
ing spouses; under the old laws of dower and 
curtesy, the widower’s share was far greater 
than the widow’s.
The definition of dower may vary from state to 
state, but it’s typically a provision that gives a 
widow (now usually defined as any surviving 
spouse) a life estate ( the use of, for the rest 
of his or her life) in a portion of all real estate 
owned by the decedent at death. Dower has 
been abolished in many states and greatly 
altered in others.
Curtesy, on the other hand, is generally defined 
as the widower’s right to a life estate in all the 
real estate his deceased wife owned at death. 
Curtesy has been abolished or greatly altered 
in most states, and replaced in some by dower 
for both widow and widower. See Chapter 6 for 
information on dower and curtesy.

26
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Intentional omissions are generally fairly obvious because most competently 
prepared wills have a provision stating whether the person making the will 
(the testator) intended to provide for children born after the will was made 
or for any children or other issue not mentioned in the will. Typically, where 
there’s been a family falling out, you find language in the will stating that this 
or that child has been intentionally left out (or has been left $1). Sometimes a 
will contains language stating that a child was left out because he or she has 
been adequately provided for in his or her lifetime.
The other players: Devisees and legatees
Other people may have a claim to inheriting the assets in a decedent’s estate. 
The decedent may name anyone to inherit under his or her will, subject to 
the rights we discuss earlier in the chapter. The following are a few technical 
names for you to ponder while you figure out who all the players are in the 
estate you’re administering.
 
✓ Specific devisee: A person or entity named to receive specific real prop-
erty (real estate) under a will.
 
✓ Residuary devisee: A person or entity named to receive all the real 
property not specifically devised (left by will).
 
✓ Specific legatee: A person or entity named to receive a legacy (person-
alty, or personal property disposed of by will).
 
✓ Residuary legatee: A person or entity named to receive all the person-
alty not specifically disposed of under a will.
Heirs-at-law
Heirs-at-law are those persons who inherit a person’s estate under state stat-
utes of descent and distribution if he or she died intestate (without a will). 
For example, Massachusetts resident John Done dies without a will, survived 
only by his wife, Mariah (no children) and great aunt Ophelia, from whom 
he is estranged. Under the intestacy statute, his surviving wife inherits the 
first $200,000 of assets, and the rest are split 
1⁄2 to his wife and 
1⁄2 to Great Aunt 
Ophelia. If John had children, his estate would have gone as follows: the first 
$200,000 to his wife, and the rest split 
1⁄2 to his wife and 
1⁄2 to his children. 
Statutes may vary from state to state, but we lay out the results of all of them 
in Appendix B.

 Chapter 2: Estates 101: Exploring the Ins and Outs of Estates
Defining the Estate for Tax Purposes
The probate process is intended to ensure the smooth transfer of property 
from the decedent to a beneficiary where no other means of transferring the 
property is in place. However, federal and state tax authorities are much more 
concerned with how much of the decedent’s property they can tax and accord-
ingly allow for a much broader definition of what the decedent owned at the 
time of his or her death. Although the probate estate includes only property 
in the decedent’s name alone or payable to the estate, for estate tax purposes 
all property owned by the decedent in any form, including jointly or in a revo-
cable trust, and any property payable to any person or the probate estate as a 
result of the decedent’s death, is includible in the taxable estate. And, you may 
have to deal with more than one type of tax; each tax on the decedent’s estate 
also has a specific purpose. This section takes a closer look at the types of 
taxes an estate may need to pay. (Chapters 17 through 19 expand on the specif-
ics and what you need to do as an executor with these taxes.)
Transfer taxes
Transfer taxes are taxes on a person’s right to transfer property and are 
levied on the value of property as it passes from one person to another 
through gift or inheritance. Although these following taxes go by different 
names (gift tax, estate tax, and generation-skipping transfer tax), they’re all 
part of the same umbrella system of taxing the transfer of property.
Some transfers that are not considered taxable gifts include
 
✓ Annual exclusion gifts: Gifts that are limited to the annual exclusion 
amount (the amount which can be transferred per donee without incur-
ring gift tax per year). The annual exclusion amount in 2008 is $12,000 
per donee; that amount is reviewed annually, with periodic increases to 
deal with inflation. In addition, a husband and wife can split gifts from 
either of them, so together they can give away $24,000 per donee (or two 
times the annual exclusion amount) per year without using any of their 
lifetime exemption.
 
✓ Gifts to a spouse: You may give an unlimited amount to your spouse, 
provided your spouse is a U.S. citizen. If your spouse isn’t a citizen, the 
exclusion amount in 2008 is $125,000, adjusted periodically for inflation.
 
✓ Tuition and medical expenses paid for someone else: Just make sure 
that you write the checks directly to the school, the hospital, or the 
doctor. If you make a mistake and write the check to your deserving 
niece or nephew directly, even if he or she turns right around and pays 
tuition, that gift isn’t unlimited, and you may find you’ve just made a 
gift that requires a gift tax return (Form 709), or even worse, a gift tax 
return and a gift tax.

28
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
✓ Gifts to political organizations.
 
✓ Gifts to qualified charities: Qualified charities have obtained tax-exempt 
status from the IRS.
There is also a lifetime unified credit which can be applied against any gift tax 
in the amount of $345,800 for 2008 and 2009, which shelters $1,000,000 of life-
time taxable gifts. Any use of this unified credit during life reduces the use of 
the unified credit against the federal estate tax upon death.
Federal gift tax
The federal gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property from one person (the 
donor) to another (the donee) with no payment (or less than full payment) in 
return. Watch it, because the gift tax is triggered whether the person transfer-
ring the property intended to make a gift or not!
Federal estate tax
The federal estate tax (sometimes mistakenly referred to as the “death tax”) is 
a tax on the transfer of property at death. All property the decedent owns or 
has an interest in at death, in whatever form it’s held, is subject to the tax.
Only about 2 percent of estates are actually subject to the estate tax because 
of an exemption amount (based on the unified credit; see Chapter 16 for an 
explanation of how the unified credit is determined), which is $2 million for 
2008. This amount changes to $3.5 million in 2009. In 2010, the estate tax is 
abolished for that year only, but it reappears in 2011 with much higher tax 
rates and much lower limits on gross estates. But keep your eye on the ball, 
because Congress is still debating (with no actual action as of this writing) 
about what, if anything, may change in the tax that goes into effect in 2011. 
See Chapter 16 for more in-depth information about the federal estate tax and 
what you need to do as the executor.
Generation-skipping transfer tax
The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is a relatively new invention, intended 
to ensure that the federal government gets its slice of the pie each and every 
time assets move from one generation to the next. As a result of more and more 
people discovering they may be able to pay less overall transfer tax by bypass-
ing their children and giving property directly to grandchildren (or even better, 
great-grandchildren), Congress plugged this particular loophole so that the gift 
tax and estate tax can no longer be evaded at any generational level by skipping 
a generation on the transfer. And so now rules trigger the GST tax any time a 
transfer is made that skips a generation, with the exception of transfers made 
into irrevocable trusts (trusts that can’t be amended) created before September 
25, 1985, which are “grandfathered” from the GST.

29
 Chapter 2: Estates 101: Exploring the Ins and Outs of Estates
The GST tax doesn’t apply to gifts that aren’t subject to the gift tax as 
described above. Furthermore, there’s a $1,000,000 lifetime exemption from 
the GST tax, which can be applied to transfers by gift and at death.
Note: A transfer of property to a grandchild is normally considered a direct skip 
and is subject to the GST tax. However, if that grandchild’s parent has already 
died at the time of the transfer, the transfer is not subject to the GST tax.
If property is left in trust for life for a child, at the child’s death there will be 
one of the following
 
✓ An estate tax payable because the child had enough control over the 
trust that it is considered to be owned by him or her and is included in 
his or her taxable estate
 
✓ A GST tax payable, because the terms of the trust are restrictive enough 
that the property is not considered to be owned by the child, so the GST 
tax is triggered because a generation has been skipped.
The GST tax is also applied to transfers to or for an unrelated person who 
is 37
1⁄2 years or more younger than the transferor — what the IRS has deter-
mined to be the equivalent of skipping a generation.
As you can see, there’s just no getting around it — a transfer tax is going to 
be paid at every generation after you pass the million-dollar exemption.
State estate, inheritance and other transfer taxes
State transfer taxes are in a state of flux due to recent changes in federal 
estate tax law. Until 2005, there was a credit against estate tax due on the fed-
eral estate tax return for state death taxes paid, with the limit on the amount 
of the credit based on the size of the taxable estate. That credit was abol-
ished as of 2005.
Unfortunately, state death taxes paid may now be taken only as a deduction 
against the amount of the federal taxable estate, and deductions are never 
worth as much in your pocket as credits.
Many states had (or still have) an estate tax system which is variously known 
as a pick-up, sponge, or slack-tax system, because it is designed to collect tax 
only on the amount allowed as a state tax credit on the federal estate tax 
return. Of course, when the federal credit was eliminated, the state estate tax 
source was also eliminated for the states with this system, causing loss of sig-
nificant tax revenues. Understandably, a lot of states are unhappy right now, 
and many of them have, or are now in the process of, enacting new estate tax 
laws to make up for the disappearance of their estate tax and the resulting 
lost revenue. See Appendix B.

30
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
In the past, administering an estate where an estate tax was due at the state 
level but not at the federal level was rare. As state and federal estate tax 
laws continue to diverge, this scenario will become increasingly common, 
particularly for estates that may just slide under the baseline amount for 
federal purposes but won’t necessarily be tax free at the state level. Still, the 
http://en-us.www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/central/number of 
total estates affected by these divergent rules should remain small.
Some states have an inheritance tax, which taxes the amount inherited by 
a particular beneficiary, rather than the estate as a whole. The tax rate 
depends upon the relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent, and the tax 
is payable by the beneficiary, although some decedent’s wills may provide 
that the estate is to pay all inheritance taxes.
Other taxes
No, you’re not out of the tax woods yet, but at least these taxes should be 
somewhat more familiar to you from your personal tax life.
 
✓ Federal income tax for decedent and estate: You must prepare and file 
the decedent’s final federal income tax return, as well as an income tax 
return for the estate for every year it’s in existence. The estate income 
tax return does have some differences from the individual return, all of 
which are explained fully in Chapter 17.
 
✓ State income tax for decedent and estate: If the decedent was domi-
ciled (had his or her legal place of residence; see Chapter 6 for more on 
determining domicile) in a state that has an income tax, you must also 
prepare and file a final state income tax return for the decedent and an 
estate state income tax return for each year the estate is in existence. 
Try saying that three times fast!
 
✓ State intangibles tax: If your decedent was domiciled in a state which 
has an intangibles tax (a tax on certain intangible assets owned by the 
decedent, such as stocks and bonds), and if he or she had assets subject 
to the tax, you must prepare and file the final intangibles tax return for 
the decedent, as well as returns for the estate (if required). You may 
also find prior year returns for the decedent that were never filed (this is 
surprisingly common) and that must be filed in order to close the dece-
dent’s estate. You can check with your local probate (or equivalent) 
court to see whether this is a requirement in your jurisdiction.

rusts come in every size, shape, color, and variety. There are enough dif-
ferent types of trusts for every day of the week and every month of the 
year. Trusts can give money away, save money, pay only certain expenses, or 
buy the moon. Trusts can contain almost any type of property for almost any 
length of time, so long as it’s not forever (although almost forever certainly 
works). And one of the lynchpins of the entire transfer tax system is that 
every person is entitled to transfer a portion of his or her estate to another 
person or entity without paying any tax on the transfer.
In fact, the sheer amount of different types of trusts makes the possibilities 
for their use almost endless. Not to worry though. You don’t need to memo-
rize all this information. Just know that this chapter takes you on a tour of 
some of the more popular types of trusts and trustees and shows you how to 
determine what type of trust you’re holding.

Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Differentiating for Income Taxes: Grantor 
Versus Non-Grantor Trusts
You can slice and dice trusts in any number of ways, depending on the 
terms and provisions written into the trust. But however you choose to 
categorize them, all funded trusts (trusts that hold assets) are divided into 
two main types for income tax purposes: grantor and non-grantor. You must 
determine what manner of beast the trust you’re administering is in order to 
prepare and file the correct income tax returns in the correct way each year. 
Remember, funded trusts are taxable entities, and you must make the deci-
sion either to file a Form 1041 for the trust, or to declare all items of income 
and deduction on the grantor’s (the person who created the trust) Form 1040. 
And watch out! Although it’s not common, you may come across a third type 
of trust: the intentionally defective grantor trust, which contains elements of 
both grantor and non-grantor trusts.
All trusts have the following participants: grantors (sometimes also referred 
to as donors or settlors), trustees, beneficiaries, and remaindermen. (If you’re 
not sure who these folks are, we define them all in Chapter 1.) The determina-
tion of whether a trust is grantor or non-grantor depends on the relationship 
of the person playing each role to the grantor. This section spells out these 
types of trusts and helps you know how to differentiate between the two so 
you can be sure that you’re administering them correctly and reporting the 
income on the correct income tax return.
Grantor trusts
Grantor trusts allow the person who creates the trust to retain certain powers 
over the administration of the trust, including the power to revoke the trust 
and regain ownership of trust property while that person is living. For exam-
ple, if the grantor, or his or her spouse during the grantor’s lifetime, is also 
named as trustee, you’re looking at a grantor trust. Likewise, if the grantor or 
the grantor’s spouse is an income beneficiary, the trust is grantor. The key to 
identifying a true grantor trust doesn’t rest on the grantor’s power to revoke 
the trust but rather on the grantor’s keeping control, however tenuous, over 
the property inside the trust.
In a grantor trust, the grantor is typically not only grantor but also a trustee; 
he or she is usually beneficiary of not only the trust’s income but also as 
much of the principal (the property funding the trust) as he or she needs 
at any given time. (To understand the complete distinction between prin-
cipal and income, check out Chapter 12.) Generally, in a grantor trust, the 
existence of the trust is ignored for income tax purposes, and the grantor 
declares all items of income and deduction on his or her income tax return. 

33
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
In most cases, the trust doesn’t even have its own taxidentification number 
(TIN, the trust equivalent of a Social Security Number) because the trust 
doesn’t need to file its own tax return.
Non-grantor trusts
Non-grantor trusts are trusts over which the grantor has given up all right, 
title, and interest in the property funding the trust. Although the trust may 
be revocable ( can be dissolved), at least during the grantor’s lifetime, the 
grantor may not terminate the trust; only the trustee, who must be someone 
other than the grantor, may. In a non-grantor trust, the grantor (and the 
grantor’s spouse), in addition to not being a trustee, also may not be named 
as a beneficiary or as a remainderman (a person or entity who receives 
what’s left of the trust’s property when the trust terminates or ends).
 
Even though a trust, when it’s first established, may begin as a grantor trust 
or an intentionally defective grantor trust (see the next section), at the 
grantor’s death all trusts become non-grantor trusts. If you haven’t obtained 
a tax identification number for the trust prior to the grantor’s death, now 
would be a good time to take care of that. See Chapter 18 for how to obtain a 
TIN. Remember, come December 31 of the year of the grantor’s death, you’re 
responsible for filing a Form 1041 for the non-grantor trust that succeeds the 
grantor trust in existence up until date of death.
Intentionally defective grantor trusts
In an intentionally defective grantor trust (IDGT), the grantor creates a trust 
that looks like a non-grantor-type trust: The grantor makes an irrevocable gift 
of property into the trust, sets up the trust for the benefit of his or her chil-
dren or grandchildren, and names someone other than himself or herself as 
trustee. The difference is that the grantor retains the right to substitute other 
property of equal value for the property he or she initially funds the trust 
with, in order to intentionally create a defect, and the income tax treatment 
for this trust changes into something that’s not entirely a grantor trust but 
not really a non-grantor trust, either.
 
In fact, when you’re administering an IDGT, you must obtain a TIN and file 
a Form 1041 every year. On the face of the Form 1041, you get to write the 
following: “Under the terms of the trust instrument, this is a grantor trust. 
In accordance with Sections 671-678 IRC, 1986, all income is taxable to the 
Grantor. Statements of income, deduction, and credits are attached.” How’s 
that for lively prose? Before you file the Form 1041 make sure that you attach 
those required statements. The grantor then includes all those items on his or 
her personal return.

34
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
A defective grantor trust is frequently used to hold real estate and closely 
held businesses. Why on earth would anyone want a defective grantor trust? 
It’s an estate-planning strategy that, among other purposes, “freezes” the 
value of property transferred into the trust for estate tax purposes; having 
the grantor be liable for the income tax removes the income tax paid from 
the grantor’s estate for estate tax purposes. That’s because, unlike the 
grantor trust income tax rules that make the income includible on the grant-
or’s Form 1040, the property is effectively transferred out of the decedent’s 
estate for estate and gift tax purposes at the time it’s transferred to the trust. 
Gift tax, if any, is paid on the value of the property on the date it’s transferred 
into the trust. No estate tax is due when the grantor dies.
Creating Trusts during Lifetime 
and after Death
Grantors’ reasons for establishing trusts vary, from protecting certain pieces 
of property to providing an income stream for heirs to trying to establish a 
framework within which a messy family situation may become manageable. 
Whatever the reason, a grantor may set up a trust that begins functioning 
during his or her lifetime, or trusts may be created upon the grantor’s death.
By the time you start administering the trust, the distinction between a trust 
created during the grantor’s lifetime or after his or her death is probably 
moot. Still, you need to know whether the trust is inter vivos or testamentary. 
The following section explains the difference between these two options.
Trusts created during lifetime
As they craft their estate plans, many people want to retain the greatest 
amount of control possible over their estates during their lives and after their 
deaths. In order to do so, many create inter vivos trusts, which are trusts gov-
erned by a legal document other than their last wills. As their Latin names sug-
gest, these trusts are created “among the living” during the grantor’s lifetime. 
So basically because an inter vivos trust is governed by an instrument other 
than the will, its provisions remain private, unlike the will, which becomes 
public knowledge after it’s filed for probate administration. That’s why inter 
vivos trusts are important to families who have substantial assets or who are 
in the public eye and don’t want everyone knowing what they’re worth.

35
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
 
A grantor may fund inter vivos trusts either during his or her life or after his 
or her death. If funded during the grantor’s lifetime, you the trustee need to 
check the instrument carefully to see if the trust falls under the grantor trust 
rules explained earlier in the “Grantor trusts” section, or under the intention-
ally defective grantor trust rules to determine whether to report the income 
on the grantor’s Form 1040 or on a Form 1041 for the trust. Inter vivos trusts 
may be revocable (often referred to as living trusts) or irrevocable; after the 
grantor’s death, they’re all irrevocable.
 
A grantor often uses inter vivos trusts to remove property from his or her 
estate, at least for probate purposes (check out Chapter 6 for more on pro-
bate). For example, if the trust was treated as a non-grantor or intentionally 
defective grantor trust during lifetime (see the previous section), and if the 
property transfers into the trust happened early enough that they clearly were 
not made in anticipation of the grantor’s death, this property is excluded from 
estate tax calculations. If, however, the trust was treated as a grantor-type 
trust during the grantor’s lifetime, be sure to include all property inside the 
trust when making estate tax calculations.
Trusts created under a last will
Although the idea of a trust for which no probate court supervision is neces-
sary may seem attractive to you, having the court keeping its beady eyes on 
a rancorous family isn’t the worst idea. And, in our experience, nothing can 
turn a family situation uglier in a hurry than the death of a wealthy parent 
or grandparent. In cases where a grantor suspects that life may become 
unpleasant for his or her trustees after his or her death, choosing a testamen-
tary trust, or a trust that’s contained in the decedent’s last will, over an inter 
vivos trust can be a wise decision. Testamentary trusts are only funded after 
the grantor’s death and are therefore always non-grantor-type trusts.
Unlike inter vivos trusts, where accounting standards are sometimes lax, 
testamentary trusts must usually provide the probate court with an annual 
account, depending on what state you’re probating the estate in. Check with 
the probate court involved to be sure of it’s requirements, because trust-
ees who fail in their duty to prepare and file these annual accounts when 
required may be sanctioned by the probate court, usually with just a slap on 
the wrist but sometimes with a fine or in very rare circumstances a contempt-
of-court citation. Probate accounts are a matter of public record, and anyone 
with the time and energy to go looking for them, from trust beneficiaries, 
disinherited heirs, or even newspaper reporters nosing around for some 
dirt, may access them.

36
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Grasping Revocable Trusts
Like their names suggest, revocable trusts are ones that the grantor can 
revoke, or terminate, at any time prior to his or her death. Whether the 
grantor creates the trust to avoid probate (a so-called living trust) or to shel-
ter the true ownership of property behind an opaque curtain, the terms of 
the trust remain open to revision, reinterpretation, and outright dissolution 
by the grantor, up to the day he or she dies.
Revocable trusts of all flavors serve as estate planning tools, so you may 
run across them because you’ve set up one yourself, you’ve been named as 
a trustee on a living trust, or you’re administering an estate, and find one or 
more different types in the decedent’s estate. The following sections point 
out the most common revocable trusts that you may encounter.
Still breathing: Living trusts
Living trusts, or trusts created and funded during the grantor’s lifetime, are 
an estate-planning technique designed to remove assets from the grantor’s 
estate, either directly to his or her heirs upon the grantor’s death or into 
his or her trust without ever setting foot in a probate court. These probate-
avoidance trusts almost always begin their lives as revocable trusts and are 
usually treated as grantor trusts for income tax purposes. Most living trusts 
are clearly identifiable because the grantor fills all the roles: grantor, trustee, 
and beneficiary.
 
If you’ve created a living trust, your goal should be to transfer as many of your 
assets as you can into the trust during your lifetime. You may not be able to 
shift every asset, such as those items you hold jointly with someone. If the 
joint owner is your spouse, and you both really want that specific property to 
be held in trust, you may opt to transfer full ownership to one or the other of 
the owners, or split it into two separate pieces, with each of you retaining half. 
After ownership is vested in only one name, you may then proceed to transfer 
the property into the name of the trust.
 
Either the grantor or someone given the grantor’s power of attorney can trans-
fer assets into a living trust. Living trusts also have provisions that handle the 
incapacity of one trustee and the appointment of a predetermined successor, 
or a procedure for determining a successor. This means that in the case of the 
grantor’s mental or physical incapacity, provisions in a living trust instrument 
can enable a trusted friend, relative, or advisor whom the grantor has selected 
in advance to assume the trusteeship and take over control of the grantor’s 
assets’ without the probate court having to appoint a guardian or conservator 
(see Chapter 2 for more information on guardianship and conservatorship).

37
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
 
Many living trust instruments are written in such a way that, upon the grant-
or’s death, the trust instrument governing the trust remains the same, but 
new provisions regarding the trust’s administration come into force. A trust 
designed to continue beyond the grantor’s death, becomes irrevocable at 
death, and the provisions contained in the trust instrument can no longer be 
changed or revoked. This now-irrevocable trust will have new trustees and 
new beneficiaries (remember, while it was a living trust the grantor was prob-
ably also the trustee and the beneficiary), and it will require a new TIN.
Tackling Totten Trusts
Although it’s much simpler than a living trust (and involves much less docu-
mentation), a Totten Trust (some states call it a payable-upon-death account) is 
still an estate-planning technique designed to move assets from the grantor’s 
estate, either directly to his or her heirs upon his or her death, or into his or 
her trust without ever setting foot in a probate court, only this time there’s no 
trust instrument. Instead, with the Totten Trust, the grantor opens a specific 
bank or brokerage account by using specific, formulaic language, and filling 
out specific paperwork that the bank or brokerage firm provides. For exam-
ple, Sue Smith may have $10,000 she wants to give to her niece, Ellen Smith, 
at Sue’s death and not a moment sooner. To do this, she can put the $10,000 
into a bank account entitled “Sue Smith, in trust for Ellen Smith.” For as long 
as Sue Smith lives, she can add to this account, take money out of it, or even 
close it entirely. When she dies, any money still in the account now belongs 
to Ellen Smith.
With this type of trust, the income earned is taxed to the grantor, and these 
accounts use the grantor’s Social Security Number to report any earnings. No 
separate tax returns are necessary. Upon the grantor’s death, no probate is 
necessary for the assets contained in the account.
 
Because a Totten Trust doesn’t have a trust instrument, each Totten Trust 
account a grantor opens has its own paperwork.
 
Not all states recognize Totten Trusts, and many that do have restrictions 
and regulations for them. If you’re thinking of setting up one or more yourself, 
check with the bank or brokerage firm before you attempt to use one to make 
sure that your state honors the payable-upon-death designation and to see 
what restrictions, if any, apply to this type of account in your state. If your 
state doesn’t honor the payable-upon-death designation, the person you name 
as the successor will still inherit the property, but only after it passes through 
the probate court.

38
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Going incognito: Nominee trusts
One reason grantors use living trusts to transfer ownership of assets from 
themselves to their heirs is to maintain privacy and keep that transfer from 
becoming a matter of public record in the probate court. However, placing real 
estate into that same trust may negate that purpose. Many states require that 
property held in trust record not only the deed but also the trust instrument at 
the registry of deeds. If you live in one of those states, don’t fear! You may still 
own property in the name of a trust — you just need a different type of trust.
 
Nominee trusts are a type of trust designed to hold real estate and only real 
estate. The trustee for the trust has very limited powers; instead, the benefi-
ciaries actually control what happens in the trust (including whether to sell 
the property). To prevent the world from knowing who the beneficiaries are, 
a Schedule of Beneficial Interest, which lists the names and percentage own-
ership of each of the beneficiaries, is attached to the original nominee trust 
instrument but not to the copy recorded at the registry of deeds. That way, 
although the names of the nominee trust, its trustee, and the property that’s 
in trust are all matters of public record, the names of the people who actually 
control the property aren’t.
Because nominee trusts are disregarded entities for income tax purposes 
and don’t require separate tax returns, the beneficiaries actually claim any 
income or deductions that the real estate produces on their personal income 
tax returns. If the real estate in question is property that the transferor ide-
ally would have liked to place in his or her living trust, he or she can name 
the trustees of the living trust as the beneficiary of the nominee trust in 
states that recognize nominee trusts. In other states, a nominee partnership 
is used instead; the partners are typically the trustees of the living trust.
Understanding Irrevocable Trusts
The real meat and potatoes of trusts are the irrevocable trusts, or trusts that 
grantors have created to hold property where the trust instrument may not 
be revoked or changed. So what is an irrevocable trust?
 
✓ The grantor has given up all right, title, and interest to the assets held in an 
irrevocable trust, and has also given up any right to terminate the trust.
 
✓ The property held by the trust is used for the benefit of the named 
beneficiaries (or unascertained interests who are defined by the trust 
instrument).

39
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
 
✓ The remainder interests (those people or organizations who are entitled 
to receive what’s left of the trust property, if anything, when the trust 
terminates) in the trust property are clearly spelled out in the trust 
instrument.
That’s what all irrevocable trusts have in common. But because a person can 
draft trust instruments in many different ways and for many different circum-
stances, a wide variety of types of trusts fall into this category. The following 
sections highlight why grantors use irrevocable trusts and some of the most 
common types.
Making gifts to an irrevocable trust
When a grantor funds an irrevocable trust (a trust that the grantor can’t 
change or terminate) with property during his or her lifetime, and the grantor 
is neither a trustee or beneficiary of the trust, he or she is giving up all right, 
title, and interest to that property — the legal definition of a gift. Depending on 
the size of the gift, the grantor may have gift tax and/or generation-skipping 
transfer tax (see Chapter 17) consequences as a result of the transfer.
If the grantor is making a taxable transfer to an irrevocable trust (and by tax-
able, we mean any amounts over and above the amount of the annual exclu-
sion, which was $12,000 in 2008 and is adjusted annually for inflation), he or 
she will have to complete a Form 709, United States Gift (and Generation-
Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, giving the name and taxpayer ID number of 
the trust, and showing the size of the gift. Unless the transferred amounts 
are huge, the grantor probably won’t actually pay a tax on the transfer; this 
return, however, becomes part of his or her permanent tax records and, 
together with any other taxable transfers the grantor makes during his or her 
lifetime, is included as a part of the grantor’s taxable estate, which is, in turn, 
used to determine the total estate tax due upon the grantor’s death.
Married couples may opt to minimize gift tax consequences by so-called gift-
splitting, where the two spouses each show one-half of the gift on their 
Forms 709 (you’re not allowed to file a joint Form 709), even if they didn’t 
own the gifted property jointly. Splitting gifts between husbands and wives 
doubles the amount of annual exclusion gifts available to the grantor and 
reduces the amount of any taxable transfer. For instance, in 2008 the two 
spouses could transfer $24,000 (2 × the $12,000 exclusion amount), no matter 
whose assets actually were transferred.
If the transfer is to a trust for the benefit of a skip person (your grandchild, 
a more distant relative, or a nonrelated person who is more than 37
1⁄2 years 
younger than the grantor), you also have to complete the generation-skipping 
part of Form 709.

Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Property the grantor gifts irrevocably into a trust keeps the same basis, or 
acquisition cost, and acquisition date as it had in the grantor’s hands. Unless 
the asset has depreciated in value less than the grantor’s original basis, in 
those instances, the basis will be the lower of cost or market value at the time 
of transfer. This information is crucial in determining whether there’s a taxable 
gain or loss when the trustee disposes of the property. It’s best to give these 
records to the trustee at the time the gift is made, and then the trustee should 
be certain to maintain good and complete records going forward.
Getting the maximum tax benefit 
out of dying: Marital trusts
Leaving a trust (or more than one, in many cases) behind for your husband or 
wife after you die isn’t a sign that you don’t think he or she can handle your 
money; instead, it’s a crafty tax technique designed to minimize the taxes 
paid on your estate at your death and also those due and payable after your 
spouse’s death. Welcome to the world of marital trusts, where a funded trust 
means that the grantor has already died and his or her spouse is still alive.
 
No matter what type of marital trust you’re administering, the value of that 
trust on the surviving spouse’s date of death is included in his or her estate tax 
calculations after he or she dies. Even though you may have avoided paying 
estate taxes on it after the first spouse’s death, you probably won’t avoid 
paying taxes the second time if the surviving spouse’s estate is large enough.
All marriages aren’t alike; neither are all marital trusts. You may encounter a 
variety of options depending on a number of factors, like the size of the estate 
or whether the spouse surviving is from a second or subsequent marriage.
Giving the surviving spouse free reign: Unlimited marital trusts
In an unlimited marital trust, the surviving spouse is entitled not only to all 
the net income but also as much of the principal as he or she desires. Net 
income includes interest, dividends, rents, business income, income from 
other trusts or estates, and state tax refunds (to name several types), but 
excludes capital gains and the expenses paid from income for administering 
the trust (like the trustee’s and tax preparer’s fees).
 
Unlimited marital trusts, sometimes also referred to as power of appointment 
trusts, contain one of two power appointments:

41
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
 
✓ A general power of appointment: The trust beneficiary may name 
anyone he or she designates, including himself or herself, at any time 
during his or her lifetime or upon his or her death, as the recipient of 
the trust property.
 
✓ A limited power of appointment: The grantor designates a group of 
acceptable appointees (such as the couple’s children, grandchildren, or 
charities).
You typically find powers of appointment in the section of the trust instrument 
dealing with that specific trust. (A single trust instrument often contains the 
governing provisions for several different trusts). For example, the spouse’s 
power of appointment will be contained in the marital trust. The powers of 
appointment can be exercised in the will of the power holder (if it’s to be effec-
tive upon death) or in a separate document. This trust also contains provisions 
for distributing the assets if the trust beneficiary fails to exercise the power of 
appointment, so never fear, the assets don’t just sail off into the sunset if the 
surviving spouse forgets to exercise the power or otherwise ignores it.
Understanding the unified credit
The unified credit is the lynchpin of the com-
bined gift, generation-skipping transfer, and 
estate tax system. Although the amount isn’t the 
same for all three types of transfers, the theory 
behind this credit is.
Unlike deductions, which are subtracted from 
taxable amounts before you calculate the tax 
owed, credits are subtracted from the actual 
tax that’s been calculated. So, in the case of 
the unified credit, you first calculate the tax due 
on the transfer being made and then apply the 
credit to that tax. If the tax you calculate doesn’t 
use up the whole credit, the remaining credit 
carries forward to a subsequent year in the 
case of gift and generation-skipping transfer 
taxes. In the case of estates, if the tax doesn’t 
require the entire credit, the estate won’t owe 
any estate tax.
The unified credit is a cumulative credit. During 
lifetime, any amounts the decedent doesn’t use 
carry forward; after death, you subtract whatever 
amounts the decedent previously used from the 
total amount of the credit available to the estate. 
So if Maxine gave away taxable gifts that would 
have used $250,000 of her unified credit during 
life, at her death her executor or administra-
tor must subtract $250,000 from the total unified 
credit available to her estate. If she had an estate 
of $5 million (including her taxable gifts, which 
are added back for this calculation) when she 
died in 2009, the total tax on that amount would 
be $2,130,800, and the amount of unified credit 
available for all transfers in her year of death 
was $1,455,800 (or the equivalent of $3,500,000 
of assets in 2009). Because she gave gifts during 
lifetime that used up $250,000 of unified credit, her 
remaining credit would be $1,205,800 ($1,455,800 
total unified credit available – $250,000 amount of 
credit used), and her estate would pay $925,000 
($2,130,800 total tax – $1,205,800 remaining unified 
credit), not the $675,000 it would have paid if she 
hadn’t used any of her unified credit during her 
lifetime.

Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Keeping tighter control: Marital estate trust
The marital estate trust may be funded with almost all the deceased spouse’s 
(the grantor’s) estate, just like the unlimited marital trust. However, unlike 
the unlimited marital, the terms of a marital estate trust are typically less 
freewheeling. You as the trustee may have the discretion to distribute 
income as well as principal. And the surviving spouse, who is also the trust 
beneficiary, has absolutely no say over who will get the assets after his or her 
own death. Instead, the assets are paid directly into his or her estate, where 
they’re included for estate tax purposes.
Reining in the surviving spouse: Qualified 
terminable interest trust (QTIP)
This trust has nothing to do with cotton swabs. Instead, the qualified termi-
nable interest trust (QTIP) beneficiary (the surviving spouse) is entitled to all 
the net income (paid at least annually) but none of the principal, during his 
or her lifetime. And, unlike the unlimited marital trust, where the trust ben-
eficiary designates where the principal goes during his or her lifetime or after 
his or her death, the grantor of a QTIP trust makes that determination in the 
trust instrument.
Protecting the estate tax exemption: 
Credit shelter trusts
With the transfer tax system in the United States, every person can transfer part 
(or all, if the transfer is under a certain size) of his or her estate without paying 
any tax on that transfer. During life, you’re even allowed to make annual gifts 
(sometimes referred to as annual exclusion gifts) that are small enough that they 
fly under the transfer tax system radar without counting against this nontax-
able portion. (In 2008, the rules allowed someone to transfer $12,000 per person 
without any transfer tax consequences.) But as soon as someone dies, all of his 
or her assets are added up (including property transferred in excess of annual 
exclusion gifts) and the total subjected to estate taxes. At this point, whatever 
portion of that allowable tax-free transfer (also called the applicable exclusion 
amount) the decedent didn’t use during lifetime is subtracted from the total 
estate. This portion of the estate funds the credit shelter trust (sometimes referred 
to as the bypass trust), or the trust that holds the amount of assets equal to the 
remaining applicable exclusion amount. Not coincidentally, this is the same value 
of assets on which the corresponding tax would equal the amount of the unified 
credit available to the estate if those assets were to be taxed. (For a more in-
depth discussion of unified credit, see the nearby sidebar.)

43
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
 
In order to accurately fund the credit shelter trust, you must first obtain 
copies of the decedent’s most recent gift tax return, which should show how 
much, if any, of the unified credit the decedent has already used during his or 
her lifetime. If the decedent wasn’t obscenely generous during lifetime, you 
have the full amount, which translates to $2.5 million for decedents dying in 
2008, and $3.5 million in 2009. If the return does include taxable gifts, subtract 
the total gifts (not the credit assigned to the tax assessed on those gifts) from 
the total amount of the estate that’s exempt from taxation to arrive at the 
amount you can use to fund this trust.
Grandpa (Or Grandma) knows best: 
Grandchildren’s trusts
If you’re not sure whether your children are ready to handle large sums of 
money, chances are good you’re even more convinced that your grandchildren 
aren’t ready. Grandchildren’s trusts are like children’s trusts in almost every 
respect except one: Transfers made into trusts created for grandchildren are 
subject to the generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax. (Check out Chapter 17 
and the nearby sidebar, “Skipping generations,” for more on this tax.) Although 
this particular tax also has annual exclusion amounts (the same as the gift tax 
annual exclusions), the amount that you may transfer GST tax free is limited to 
a cumulative $1 million over your lifetime. Any GST tax you pay is in addition 
to any gift taxes or estate taxes also owed on the transfer.
Lower your estate tax (and make your kids and 
grandkids really happy)
Funding children’s and grandchildren’s trusts 
during lifetime with annual gifts equal to the 
current annual exclusion amount (gifts not sub-
ject to the gift tax — the amount was $12,000 
in 2008, and is adjusted for inflation in $1,000 
increments) is a great way for a grantors to 
remove assets from their estates, especially 
if they suspect their estates may be taxable at 
their deaths. We once shared a wealthy client 
who religiously gave all the annual exclusion 
gifts she could to each of her children’s and 
grandchildren’s trusts. She lived for a very long 
time, but when she died,all those $10,000 gifts 
(the amount of the annual exclusion at the time 
she made the transfers) had been invested 
for years, and the total value that was sitting 
pretty in these trusts far exceeded the size of 
her taxable estate (which was still huge). Had 
she waited to fund these trusts until after her 
death, the available pot of money would have 
been much smaller because her estate would 
have paid 55 percent in estate tax.

44
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Grantors often create these trusts to provide funds for a specific purpose, 
such as education or toward the purchase of a first home. But these trusts 
often also allow the trustee a great deal of discretion when choosing to make 
a distribution for another purpose. As with children’s trusts, they also some-
times create them with an end plan in place so that the principal is distrib-
uted to the beneficiary at specific ages.
Skipping generations
Probably the least likely answer to the question 
“What kind of tax do you think of when someone 
mentions taxes?” is the generation-skipping 
transfer (GST) tax. It is, as its name suggests, 
a tax based on the transfer of assets between 
generations that bypasses at least one genera-
tion along the way. Whenever a grandparent 
transfers property to a grandchild, for example, 
if the intervening child (that is, the donor’s child 
and grandchild’s parent) is still alive, a genera-
tion has just been skipped, and you need to pay 
attention to this tax. Likewise, if a person makes 
a gift to an unrelated friend and there’s more 
than a 37
1⁄2-year age gap between the two, the 
IRS considers that the transfer has skipped a 
generation.
The GST tax rules are complex, and you may 
wonder how anyone could devise such a 
Byzantine system. The reality is that the con-
cept of GST came about because some wealthy 
people were trying to avoid paying transfer 
taxes by transferring their wealth to grand-
children and great-grandchildren rather than 
their children. Instead of having their wealth 
pass step-wise (from generation to generation) 
with either a gift or estate tax being collected at 
every step along the way, these skip transfers 
had taxes (either gift or estate) collected only 
every second generation, or in families where 
Grandma and Grandpa lived into their 90s and 
beyond, sometimes every third. Like the big one 
that got away, Congress looked at the lost tax 
revenue and came up with a system to make 
sure it assessed tax on every available step on 
the generational staircase, even if the assets 
never came to rest on each of them in turn.
GST taxes are calculated and assessed in 
addition to gift and/or estate taxes on trans-
fers made to skip persons (the grandchildren 
or other recipients in the skip transfers). Unlike 
the annual gift tax exclusion, you can’t exclude 
a set amount each year from the tax; you are, 
however, allowed to exclude $1 million over the 
course of your lifetime and after your death. 
Small and moderate-size estates can pretty 
easily avoid the GST tax altogether, even if 
they make transfers to grandchildren and the 
like. In larger estates, it becomes a question of 
getting the most bang for your exclusion bucks. 
For example, large estates often apply GST tax 
exemptions to trusts funded with life insurance 
policies. The grantor applies the GST tax exemp-
tion against only the relatively small transfer of 
cash to pay the insurance premiums. When he 
or she dies and the face value of the policy is 
paid into the trust, the new value of the trust far 
exceeds the amount of GST tax exemption the 
grantor used to fund it, but all those proceeds 
are now GST tax exempt.

 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
Better safe than sorry: Insurance trusts
Many grantors own assets, such as a company they own or the family farm, 
that can’t readily go into a trust. But those items still have real value and are 
part of the total estate when calculating estate taxes. Of course, if that type 
of asset represents the bulk of the decedent’s estate, the estate may not have 
enough cash to pay the tax man when the time comes. Enter the insurance 
trust, a type of irrevocable trust funded during the grantor’s lifetime. An insur-
ance trust uses insurance policies (plus a small amount of cash) as the only 
type of asset. The trust owns the insurance policies on the life of the grantor, 
and the trust is the sole beneficiary. In fact, insurance trusts are a reasonably 
inexpensive way to make sure that adequate funds are available to pay the 
cash needs of a decedent’s estate that may be otherwise short of cash, without 
forcing a fire sale of other assets that may not be readily marketable.
When the grantor dies, the policies pay into the trust. Money is then available 
to pay the debts of the decedent and the estate, including any estate taxes 
due. But if the trust is structured correctly and the premiums have been paid 
by using the grantor’s annual exclusion from gift tax or some of his or her 
lifetime annual exclusion, the face value of the life insurance policies on the 
grantor’s death isn’t included in the grantor’s estate for estate tax purposes.
It’s only a name, not a description: 
Crummey Trusts
In a Crummey trust, creating the illusion that the beneficiaries have the right 
to use the gift at the time it’s given (a present interest) is the key. Without a 
present interest, the grantor can’t use the annual exclusion to eliminate any 
gift tax consequences.
 
Crummey trusts are named for Crummey v. Commissioner, a court case 
decided in the 9th Circuit in 1969. The case enabled a grantor to make a gift 
into trust of a present interest in property that wasn’t really a present interest 
gift, while claiming an annual gift exclusion for it at the same time.
 
Although a Crummey trust may sound complicated, it’s really not. Here’s how 
it works: In a Crummey trust, the grantor transfers money equal to or less 
than the annual exclusion amount into a trust set up for the benefit of his or 
her children and/or grandchildren. At the time the gift is made, the trustee 
sends a letter to all the named beneficiaries informing them of the gift and 
telling them that they have a right to withdraw some or all of that gift within a 
specified period of time, usually 30, 45, or 60 days. When the beneficiaries fail 
to take the money out of the trust during this period (and the grantor, trustee, 
and beneficiaries all understand that the beneficiaries won’t be asking for 
their money), their ability to do so lapses, and the money now remains inside 

46
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
the trust. This ability to withdraw the contributions at the time they’re made, 
even though no one ever exercises their right to do so, creates the present 
interest required for annual exclusion gifts and is called a Crummey power.
In a Crummey trust, the trustee is responsible for investing the cash, allow-
ing it to grow over time. At some date far in the future, distributions may be 
made to the beneficiaries, many times to pay for education or the purchase 
of a new home. In some cases, the trust terminates at a specific date or as the 
beneficiaries reach certain ages, with the principal being paid out to the ben-
eficiaries. In others, the trust may operate long after the contributions have 
been made to it, paying income and/or principal to the beneficiaries accord-
ing to their needs.
Many grandparents have paid for their grandchildren’s college educations by 
funding Crummey trusts for them. Although these trusts aren’t afforded any 
income tax breaks (unlike specifically designated college savings accounts 
such as Section 529 plans or Coverdell Education Savings Accounts), 
Crummey trusts may be far more flexible than either of those accounts. With 
a Crummey trust, the principal doesn’t have to be used to pay for education, 
and the distributions are discretionary. So the grandchild who may land a 
four-year free ride for whatever reason won’t have a mountain of unneces-
sary college savings, and the grandchild who may otherwise qualify for out-
right grant or scholarship money won’t be penalized because of money that 
has been explicitly set aside for his or her education.
Keeping a finger in the pie: Grantor-
retained interest trusts
Sometimes, grantors want to put specific property into trust but aren’t sure 
that they’re ready to lose the benefit from that property yet. Welcome to the 
world of grantor-retained interest trusts, where the grantor makes the gift of 
property into trust but holds back an interest, either in the income from the 
property or the use of the property (in the case of real estate), for a specified 
period of time.
Because the grantor hangs onto an interest in the property transferred 
for a period of time, you may be tempted to view these trusts as grantor 
trusts, discussed earlier in this chapter, so that no gift tax returns would be 
required because the grantor didn’t give up complete control of the property 
in question. Grantor-retained interest trusts are more of a hybrid, though — 
although the grantor does hang onto an interest, that interest is finite, and 
the transfer of property into one of these trusts does constitute a gift requir-
ing him or her to file Form 709. But the value of the taxable gift isn’t the same 
as the value the property had in the hands of the grantor. Instead, the gift tax 
value is the value of the property at the date of the gift, less the value of the 
grantor’s retained interest.

47
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
 
Why bother with grantor-retained interest trusts? In three words: to reduce 
taxes. You can substantially reduce the gift tax value of property by using one 
of these trusts, perhaps permitting the transfer of substantial property to sub-
sequent generations without triggering a gift, or later, an estate tax. In addi-
tion, transferring property today (as opposed to years down the road) almost 
always saves on taxes because taxes are based on the property’s value at the 
time of transfer, and values usually (but not always) go up and not down. And 
although you should never make any estate planning decision purely based 
on the tax consequences, we’ve both been involved with plenty of these 
trusts where large potential transfer tax bills were almost entirely eliminated 
because the grantor thought to create a grantor-retained interest trust.
Grantor-retained interest trusts come in many varieties. Among the most 
popular (and people really do refer to them by their acronyms, so don’t be 
shy) are the following:
 
✓ Grantor-retained Income Trusts (GRITs): The grantor transfers prop-
erty into this trust but holds onto the income earned by the trust for a 
period of years. At the end of the period, the property either distributes 
out to the beneficiaries, or remains in trust, but now the beneficiaries 
receive the income.
 
✓ Grantor-retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs): The grantor transfers prop-
erty into trust and receives a scheduled and fixed payment from it, based 
on a percentage of the initial value of the transfer, for a period of years.
 
✓ Grantor-retained Unitrusts (GRUTs): The grantor transfers property 
into trust, and like with a GRAT, retains the right to receive an annual 
payment from the trust for a period of years. Instead of a fixed annuity 
amount determined when the trust is initially funded, the unitrust pay-
ment changes annually, and is calculated based on an asset valuation 
done on a specific day each year. In most cases, that date is the second 
business day of the calendar year. (Don’t ask — we’re just responsible 
for telling you the rules, not for making them.)
 
✓ Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs): The grantor transfers his 
or her home into the trust, retaining the right to live there, rent free, for a 
period of years. After the specified period ends, the property now belongs 
to the named beneficiaries (usually the children but sometimes the grand-
children), and it’s up to those beneficiaries whether to allow the grantor 
to remain in the residence. It’s very important, though, that the grantor 
now pays the new owners market rent for that house if he or she contin-
ues to live in the home. Otherwise, the IRS may decide that the grantor 
never actually made the gift and therefore still owns the house.

48
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
The rules for structuring a grantor-retained interest trust, and for determining 
the gift tax value of the property transfers into the trust, aren’t for the weak of 
heart. This is tricky tax stuff that brings many experienced estate planners to 
their knees. What’s worse, if it isn’t done correctly, the IRS may come along at 
any time and disallow the gift. Unlike income tax returns, which have a specified 
statute of limitations beyond which time the IRS may not question the return 
unless they suspect fraud, gift tax returns remain open items with the IRS until 
the taxpayer’s death. The IRS can still question gifts made 30 years ago and 
change the valuations of gifts or disallow them entirely. If you’re thinking of set-
ting up one of these trusts for yourself, find an expert estate planner with plenty 
of experience to draft the necessary documents and prepare the gift tax returns. 
And if you’ve been named as trustee for one of these trusts, getting a second 
opinion and having a professional of your choosing review the trust instrument 
is always money well spent. That way, if the document is fine, and the valuations 
are dandy, you’re only out a relatively small fee, but if you do have a problem, 
your expert will, hopefully, find it and correct it before the IRS catches on.
Exploring Charitable Trusts
Whether you’ve been extraordinarily fortunate during your lifetime or you 
prefer that your assets go to charity rather than to your family (whom you 
may feel you’ve already given enough to), establishing and funding charitable 
trusts are increasingly popular elements of estate plans. The days when only 
the extremely wealthy created private foundations and other types of chari-
table trusts have disappeared — now, even people with more modest means 
are discovering that instead of gifting money directly from your personal 
account to a particular charity, you can be charitable and reduce your tax-
able estate at the same time.
 
Charitable trusts allow you to transfer assets out of your estate, with the goal 
of using all, or a substantial part of that property, and the income earned from 
it, to act charitably. What better feeling can you have than seeing your money 
be used for worthy causes?
Of course, because charitable gifts carry with them tax consequences, and 
because most people have come to rely on tax consequences when making 
major decisions, giving to charity is rarely as simple as dropping a few coins 
in a bucket or mailing a check to a worthy recipient. By funding a charitable 
trust, you not only enable yourself to give a current gift but also provide 
the means, from the same assets, to make future gifts. And you aren’t only 
entitled to remove these assets permanently from your estate, reducing your 
taxable estate, but you also get a healthy income tax deduction, upfront, for 
the transfer. In many ways, it’s a win-win situation.
The next sections discuss the two major types of charitable trusts that 
grantors may create.

49
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
Split-interest charitable trusts
Split-interest charitable trusts are trusts where the grantor retains an interest 
in the trust property. The grantor may create a trust enabling him or her to 
receive payments during his or her lifetime, or for a period of years, after 
which the remaining trust property is given to charity (so-called charitable 
remainder trusts). Or the trust may permit set payments to charity from the 
income and principal for a period of years (the charitable lead interest). After 
that period expires, the remaining trust principal is distributed to the remain-
dermen, or to the people entitled by the trust instrument to receive what-
ever’s left after the charitable lead interest expires (so-called charitable lead 
trusts). The four major types of split interest trusts are
 
✓ Charitable Remainder Unitrusts (CRUTs): The grantor receives pay-
ments for life that are fixed annually, based on a percentage of the value 
of the assets (which are usually valued on the second business day of 
each year).
 
✓ Charitable Remainder Annuity Trusts (CRATs): The grantor receives 
payments for life, based on a percentage of the value of the assets on the 
date the trust is funded.
The rule against perpetuities: Property 101
Every first-year law student must wrestle with 
the rule against perpetuities, and it won’t hurt 
for you to know about it too because we’re talk-
ing trusts. Simply put, the law historically didn’t 
like property to be tied up in trust forever, so 
the rule against perpetuities evolved, stating 
that an interest in property will be void unless 
it vests no later than 21 years after the death 
of a life in being when the interest was cre-
ated. Translation: In states that follow the tradi-
tional rule against perpetuities, a trust must be 
structured so that it terminates no later than 21 
years after the death of a specific living person 
or persons referenced by name or relationship 
in the trust document. For example, the docu-
ment may end the trust “no later than 21 years 
after the death of the last to die of the now-
living descendants of my grandparents and 
my spouse’s grandparents.” Note that those 
descendants needn’t be beneficiaries of the 
trust; referencing them merely gives the trust 
the possibility of a longer life. All well-crafted 
trusts in states where this rule still applies have 
a fail-safe provision, which provides that, what-
ever the other provisions of the trust, it won’t 
violate the rule against perpetuities. Phew! That 
wasn’t too painful, was it?
Nowadays, about half the states follow a uni-
form law that provides that an interest in a 
trust must vest within 90 years of when the 
trust was created or the trust will be reformed 
by the court to meet this requirement. Some 
states actually have or are repealing their rule-
against-perpetuities laws to take advantage 
of a tax loophole that was created regarding 
dynasty trusts. (These states hope to attract 
more trust business (or at least keep trust busi-
ness from going elsewhere) by eliminating the 
rule against perpetuities.

✓ Charitable Lead Unitrusts (CLUTs): Charity receives annual payments, 
calculated on a percentage of the assets (valued as of the second busi-
ness day of the year) for a fixed number of years.
 
✓ Charitable Lead Annuity Trusts (CLATs): Charity receives a fixed annual 
payment every year. These payments are calculated as a percentage of 
asset value as of the date the grantor gifts the property into the trust.
All CRUTs, CRATs, CLUTs, and CLATs must file annual income tax returns. 
What makes this an interesting exercise is that these forms aren’t typically 
fiduciary income tax returns like the ones described in Chapter 18. Instead, 
Form 5227, Split-Interest Trust Information Return is your form of choice. 
Note that Form 5227 is an information return only; no tax is ever due. If the 
trust you’re administering is a remainder trust, you have to give a Schedule K-1 
from the trust return to the income beneficiary, who will then be responsible 
for including all items of income and deduction shown on the K-1 on their per-
sonal Form 1040. We discuss how to complete Schedule K-1 in Chapter 19.
 
Don’t fail to file your tax returns, including any state returns that may be 
required. Just because you’re not paying any tax doesn’t mean the IRS doesn’t 
want to see what’s happened during the year. Failure to file the Form 5227 
carries a hefty filing penalty, calculated on the number of days it’s late, and 
maxing out at a whopping $50,000 per return, and the IRS very rarely abates 
it. It figures if you’re swift enough to figure out the positive estate and income 
tax consequences of setting up one of these trusts, you’re also swift enough to 
make sure that you file the tax returns on time. Although ignorance on other 
tax matters may sometimes earn you some IRS sympathy, it doesn’t here.
Non-operating charitable foundations
You may have heard of the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and 
(more recently) the Gates Foundation. These are non-operating charitable 
foundations (sometimes also referred to as family foundations), which are 
established by some very philanthropic folks in order to further their chari-
table goals. Although these foundations may be incorporated and be run by 
the full gamut of corporate officers and directors, they may also be governed 
by a trust instrument and trustees. For many smaller foundations, the trust 
route is the way to go because the tax reporting requirements are the same 
and they don’t have any corporate filing obligations.
Supercharging your charitable giving by setting up a foundation
Creating a charitable foundation gives new scope to charitable giving. 
Now, in exchange for the rather hefty charitable donation you can claim on 
your income tax return each time you transfer assets into the foundation, 

51
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
charitable giving is no longer optional for you. The knowledge that you’re 
required to give at least 5 percent of the average value of the assets in the 
foundation each and every year turns you, and other members of your family, 
into much more committed and inventive charitable givers.
There’s a cost to be paid, though, in making a large gift into a charitable foun-
dation you’ve established: establishing the foundation’s tax-exempt status 
and annual tax reporting. In order for you to take charitable deductions 
for gifts you make to the foundation, you must obtain an IRS determination 
letter, stating that your foundation is a qualified charity.
Filing for tax-exempt status
To do so, file Form 1023, Application for Recognition of Exemption under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Expect that your applica-
tion will be rejected at least once, but know that this is a situation of “if at 
first you don’t succeed, keep trying.” The IRS will give you explicit reasons 
why it has kicked back your application. Fix up those problematic sections 
and resend it. Obtaining tax exemption is a key element for your foundation; 
without it, you may as well not have one.
After you’ve filed your application, you also have to file an annual Form 990-
PF, Return of Private Foundation. Don’t wait until you’ve received your 
determination letter before you begin filing annual Form 990-PFs; instead, 
work on the assumption you’ll eventually receive your exemption. Form 990-
PF, although not an income tax return, is an excise tax return, and you’ll be 
required to pay either 1 or 2 percent of your net income as excise tax. Unlike 
most other types of trusts, family foundations are allowed to use a fiscal year-
end (ending the tax year on the last day of any month, not just December) for 
tax reporting purposes. If you choose a fiscal year-end for your foundation, 
Form 990-PF is due four and one-half months after the end of the fiscal year.
 
Filling out the Form 990-PF can charitably be called a nightmare. Chances are 
good that you won’t be able to even attempt preparing this return on your 
own, and neither will most accountants, attorneys, or enrolled agents. Not to 
fear — some professional preparers do prepare these returns, but you may 
have to do some homework to find one. Don’t just accept a preparer’s word 
that he or she can do this work; ask to see some evidence. Form 990-PF is 
open to public inspection, and you’re well within your rights to ask to see one 
he or she has prepared.

Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Owning Subchapter S Share in Trust
In a simple world, the only assets owned by trusts would be publicly traded 
stocks, bonds, and cash. But this isn’t a simple world, and many grantors 
have less traditional sorts of property that they want to transfer into their 
trusts. One of these assets is often shares the grantor owns in a small busi-
ness corporation, commonly known as a Subchapter S corporation.
In exchange for a significant tax break over larger C corporations, Subchapter 
S corporations are governed by somewhat constraining rules over how 
many shareholders each corporation may have (no more than 75), and who, 
exactly, may own shares. Trusts usually may not own shares, except for 
grantor trusts, where the grantor declares all trust income on his or her Form 
1040. However, if a trust instrument contains appropriate language and the 
IRS is notified in a timely manner, trusts may own S corporation shares. This 
section explains the options.
Qualified Subchapter S Trusts (QSSTs)
In a Subchapter S corporation, the shareholders (not the corporation) pay 
the income tax on income the corporation earns. The corporate income tax 
return (Form 1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation) shows 
all the income for the year, and then splits it among all the shareholders 
on Schedule K-1. Each shareholder than declares his or her portion of the 
income on Form 1040. Because trusts, in general, don’t fall under the list of 
approved shareholders, if a trust wants to become a qualified shareholder, it 
must be certain to pass all the income out to its income beneficiary. Welcome 
to the world of qualified Subchapter S Trusts, or QSSTs.
 
In order for a trust to be a qualified QSST, it must meet the following conditions:
 
✓ The Subchapter S income must be distributed 100 percent to the trust’s 
income beneficiary because that income must be declared on individual 
tax returns, not trust tax returns. So in order for a trust to own S shares, 
it must pay out all its income to its income beneficiary. Or, if the trust 
is a grantor trust and doesn’t have a separate tax return, the grantor 
declares all items of income on his or her Form 1040.
 
✓ The trust may only have one income beneficiary during the lifetime of 
that beneficiary. The beneficiary must also be a U.S. citizen or resident. 
If the trust beneficiary is a nonresident alien (a citizen of another country 
who doesn’t live in the U.S.) or a corporation, that trust can’t be a QSST.

53
 Chapter 3: The Lowdown on Trusts: Identifying the Different Types
One trust instrument may create multiple QSSTs. If a trust instrument creates 
these so-called separate shares, each of the shares may qualify as Subchapter 
S shareholders, provided, of course, that the mandatory income beneficiaries 
fulfill the other requirements for S shareholders.
 
If only it were as easy as knowing that the trust and the beneficiary are quali-
fied S shareholders. Unfortunately, you have to let someone else, namely the 
IRS, know. Seek advice sooner rather than later from a qualified professional 
(attorney, CPA or Enrolled Agent) to make sure that the QSST election is filed 
on time (typically 21⁄2 months after the S corporation’s year-end). Failure to 
file these elections jeopardizes not only the trust’s election but also the entire 
S corporation’s existence as an S corporation. Remember, an S corporation 
that has even one disqualified shareholder stands to lose its S designation, 
leaving it liable for double taxation, first on corporation income and then on 
the dividends paid to its shareholders.
Electing Small Business Trusts (ESBT)
Although QSSTs must have a mandatory income beneficiary who is a U.S. 
citizen or resident (see the preceding section), Electing Small Business Trusts 
(ESBT) are allowed to have multiple income beneficiaries, and the trust 
doesn’t have to distribute all income. Instead, in an ESBT, the following 
apply:
 
✓ All beneficiaries must be individuals, estates, or charitable organizations.
 
✓ The S stock may not be purchased by the trust.
 
✓ The trust may not be a QSST or a tax-exempt trust.
 
✓ Each potential income beneficiary counts towards the total allowable 
number of shareholders any S corporation may have.
In an ESBT, the trustee (not the beneficiary) makes the election, notifying the 
IRS where the corporation files its tax return of the name, address, and TIN 
for each trust beneficiary. Usually, you must file ESBT elections within 21/2 
months of the corporation’s year-end.
 
Like QSSTs, ESBTs are a tricky beast best not attempted on your own, at least 
while you’re getting going. Making a mistake here jeopardizes not only the 
status of the trust’s election but also of the corporation’s S election. And if you 
think messing up a trust tax return is bad, just wait until you have a bunch of 
angry former S shareholders hunting you down because they now have to pay 
more taxes due to your error.

Assembling Your Team Members 
and Knowing When to Use Them
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying what you can and can’t do yourself
▶ Locating an attorney
▶ Assessing accountants
▶ Finding other experts and assistants
T
he universe of trusts and estates is quite unlike any other and has its 
own sets of rules and conventions that may seem completely foreign. In 
the fiduciary (trust and estate) universe, accounting rules are different, and 
so are many of the tax laws.
Navigating these new waters by yourself isn’t impossible, but it’s also not 
uncommon to want expert advice and assistance along the way. In this chap-
ter, we tell you about different types of advisors you may want to consult, 
from attorneys and accountants to investment advisors, appraisers, and 
other assorted professionals.
Deciding to Go Alone or Ask for Help
We both know lots of people who have successfully maneuvered their way 
through the world of estate or trust administration unassisted. Many of these 
were folks whose professional lives touched on this area, so they had some 
idea of where to start and how to proceed. We also know plenty others whom 
we met midway through the administration process, after the executor, 
administrator, or trustee finally threw up his hands in defeat.
 
You can find a middle ground. Administering a trust or estate without profes-
sional help is entirely possible, but you shouldn’t assume that you’ll be able to 
do it without doing some homework. The fact that you’re reading this book is 
a great starting point, but we’d be remiss if we didn’t point you to some other 
resources as well. Among these resources are the following:

56
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
✓ IRS Publication 559, Survivors, Executors and Administrators: 
Although reading this publication may not be your idea of a good time, 
it’s a key resource and highlights important issues you need to be 
aware of. It not only gives you tax advice for the decedent’s (deceased 
person’s) final Form 1040, the estate’s (or trust’s) Form 1041, and the 
estate’s Form 706 (see Chapters 16 and 17), but it also gives general 
administration advice, comprehensive income tax return examples, and 
a valuable checklist of forms and due dates.
 
✓ Instructions for tax forms: We’d love to say that we never read the tax 
form instructions, but we’d be lying. They seem dense and intimidat-
ing, especially if you’re not sure where to look. Fortunately, most give 
instructions line by line, and very often terms and concepts are intro-
duced either at the beginning of the instructions or at the start of a 
particular chapter within the instructions. If you’re afraid of losing the 
information after you’ve located it, make a photocopy of the appropriate 
page, highlight the pertinent text, and keep it together with your copy of 
the return and any supporting documents.
 
✓ Your local probate court (or its equivalent in your state): In addition 
to being the best place to locate all the probate forms you need, most 
also have pamphlets available that explain the probate process in your 
locale. Making friends with clerks or assistant registrars at the probate 
court never hurts. Many of them have been there longer than the furni-
ture, and what they don’t know about probate isn’t worth knowing.
 
✓ Your state department of taxation or revenue: Every state has specific 
requirements for trusts and estates, and many have publications avail-
able to help guide you through the process. In addition, if you have 
questions, call the state tax department and ask to be transferred to 
the fiduciary (or trust and estate) section. Every state tax department 
has at least one person in that area. Make sure that you get her contact 
info and keep it handy. If you run into trouble down the road, having a 
person who is familiar with your situation is invaluable.
 
We don’t suggest you ever phone the IRS for fiduciary tax advice. The IRS 
doesn’t focus its training on fiduciary tax, and its telephone support is spotty, 
at best. What’s worse, you don’t know whether the person on the other end 
of the phone actually knows what she is talking about. If you can’t find the 
answer you’re looking for in writing, you may want to ask the question of a pri-
vate practice tax expert who specializes in trust and estate returns. She may 
be willing to answer your question for free if it’s a simple one, or at least point 
you in the right direction. See the section “Hiring a Tax Professional” later in 
this chapter.

 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Team Members and Knowing When to Use Them
Finding an Attorney
If the prospect of estate or trust administration leaves you cold, or you’ve 
already begun delving into the administration and realize that you’re in over 
your head, you may want to consider hiring an attorney to either shepherd 
the process from beginning to end or to help you with only certain aspects of 
administration. For example, you may want help with the probate process and 
with preparation of the estate and income tax returns, but you feel you should 
be the one to go through the house and figure out what the decedent owned. 
Even doing this much yourself can save you a pretty penny in fees, and the 
experts are usually happy to have you do as much fact gathering as possible.
 
Whatever the extent of the work you want an attorney to perform, finding one 
you can work with for a reasonable fee isn’t an impossibility. Before you start, 
though, make sure that you have some idea of the scope of work you want the 
attorney to undertake for you. A common pitfall in estate and trust administra-
tion is not having a grasp of who’s responsible for what. Although any attorney 
worth his weight will have a comprehensive things-to-do list that covers most 
scenarios, the only sure thing about estates and trusts is that no two estates or 
trusts are alike. When working with an attorney (or any professional, for that 
matter), make sure that everyone knows what they’re supposed to be doing 
and every job is covered. Nothing should ever fall through the cracks.
This section can help you not only locate an attorney but also choose one 
after careful investigation. After you hire an attorney, you also need to know 
how to pay him or her. This section helps you with payment options.
Where to look
When searching for an attorney to help you with your estate or trust, you 
may be wondering where the best place to find him or her is. Unfortunately, 
you can’t rub a magic lamp and ask for an attorney to appear, but you can do 
some investigative work on your own to uncover one that’s a good match for 
you. Check out the following resources when searching for an attorney:
 
✓ Phone directory: Your first thought may be to rush to your phone direc-
tory and start flipping through the listings. Chances are good you’ll see 
pages and pages of attorneys listed. You’ll probably notice multiple dis-
play ads touting this or that firm’s expertise with various types of law.
 
 Although we certainly don’t think you should ignore the phone book (or 
any other form of advertising) when finding an attorney to assist you, we 
don’t think you should rely on this information entirely. No one is check-
ing the validity of the claims being made in advertising, and anyone with 
a law degree can hang out a shingle stating that she concentrates in this 
area. Just because someone says they’re competent doesn’t mean that 
they are.

58
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
✓ Martindale-Hubbell: This database lists most lawyers in the United 
States as well as many of those in foreign countries; we’re not sure we’d 
consider using an attorney who wasn’t listed in Martindale-Hubbell. You 
can find attorneys all over the country by using their free Web site, www.
martindale.com. Not only can you search for attorneys and law firms 
by practice type (and the practice type you want is either Trusts and 
Estates or Wills and Probate) and location, but you can also check out the 
peer rankings (other attorneys’ opinions of this attorney’s expertise). (A 
rating of CV is very good, BV is even better, and AV means the attorney 
is one of the greats in that area.)
 
✓ Local, county, and state bar associations: Bar associations all have 
lawyer referral services, which match you with an attorney in your area 
whose law practices focus on the area you request. Referrals are free 
and made on a rotating basis. Your first half-hour appointment with the 
attorney is typically billed at a much reduced rate, often as little as $25.
 
✓ Personal references: You may already know someone who’s been in 
charge of someone’s estate or trust, but you’re just not aware of it. Ask 
people you trust where you work, within your family, or at your place of 
worship if they’ve personally worked with an attorney on estate or trust 
matters and whether they were satisfied with the service they received.
 
✓ Referrals from other professionals or within law firms: You may already 
be working with a tax pro or an investment advisor who may have the name 
of an attorney whom they know to be competent and reasonable. Or you 
may be the client of a large firm that practices in many areas, even if the 
attorney you usually employ doesn’t do trust and estate work. Generally, 
referrals from other professionals are good ones — after all, the profes-
sional reputation of the person who makes the referral is as much on the 
line as that of the person being recommended. Referring a nonqualified 
person doesn’t benefit anyone.
 
The law is a vast topic, and attorneys specialize. Although your cousin’s bril-
liant child may be a cutting edge corporate or real estate lawyer, she’s not 
going to be particularly helpful to you in probating an estate. Also, because a 
nonspecialist isn’t as experienced in these matters, every task will take longer, 
increasing the size of your eventual bill. As a result, make sure that you thor-
oughly investigate the attorneys’ credentials to ensure that they’re qualified to 
handle your estate or trust.
 
In order to double-check an attorney’s credentials, check out the following:
 
✓ His law firm’s Web site: Before you actually speak to him, visit the 
firm’s Web site. Often, Web sites include abbreviated resumes, lists of 
articles written, or professional and charitable organizations the attor-
ney is involved with. Because you may find yourself working closely 
with this person for a period of months or years, this relationship is an 
important one. The more info you can gather upfront, the happier you 
may be with your final selection.

59
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Team Members and Knowing When to Use Them
 
✓ Your state’s licensing and oversight agency for attorneys: Particularly 
if the attorney you select isn’t personally known to you or to someone 
you trust, you can check with a Board of Bar Overseers or the like to 
make sure that the attorney hasn’t had any complaints or malpractice 
suits filed against him — or at least none with any merit. (You can 
consider overlooking nuisance lawsuits, but you would want these 
explained away very thoroughly.)
Asking the right questions
Finding a competent attorney is only the first step in crafting an effective 
partnership between you (as the executor, administrator, or trustee) and 
your new attorney. Now you must establish lines of communication and 
determine whether you and this attorney are compatible.
 
Although working with an attorney isn’t really like a marriage, two people with 
completely different work styles and ethics will be sure to rub each other the 
wrong way. Before you get too involved in the whole administration process, you 
may want to interview the attorney to get a sense of whether you’ll be able to 
work efficiently with this person. Among the questions you may want to ask are
 
✓ How much experience do you have in administering trusts and estates?
 
✓ How often do you check in with your clients?
 
✓ How long does it typically take you to respond to requests from clients?
 
✓ Who actually performs the work — you or a paralegal, trust or estate 
administrator, or legal secretary? Of course, if a subordinate is actually 
preparing the work (with the advisor simply reviewing it and being ulti-
mately responsible for it), the arrangement can be very cost effective for 
you because the hourly rates for junior staff members are always lower 
than those for more senior attorneys.
 
✓ How do you prefer to communicate with clients — via phone, written 
correspondence, e-mail, or in person?
 
✓ What are your privacy policies?
 
Only after you have answers to these and whatever other questions you may 
come up with can you be fully prepared to decide whether to hire this attor-
ney or not. If you choose to, great! Your search is over. If you find the little 
hairs on the back of your neck at attention, though, you may want to continue 
looking. Remember, you probably kissed a lot of frogs before you met your life 
partner; this choice, although not the stuff dreams are made of, can turn into 
a nightmare if the attorney you hire is actually a toad. And remember, if you 
decide at a later date that the attorney you’ve chosen is no longer someone 
you’d want to bring home to meet your family, you can change. An estate or 
trust attorney works for you, the executor or trustee, and not for the estate or 
trust. If you’re not happy, keep searching until you find the right person.

60
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Discussing payment options
One of the biggest questions, and one that most attorneys are very happy to 
discuss, is the manner and size of the payment. Attorneys involved in estates 
may charge fees in one of three ways (plus they all charge for miscellaneous 
disbursements, which are almost always additional):
 
✓ Hourly fee: The most common type of fee arrangement, attorneys bill 
you for the number of hours (or partial hours) they spend on your 
estate or trust. They’ll tell you upfront how much they charge per hour. 
Don’t be shocked at some of the numbers you’ll hear. For example, we 
recently heard of an attorney in New York who just passed the $1,000 
per hour barrier. Although that example is extreme, high hourly rates 
don’t always equate to the best legal help money can buy.
 
 Large firms charge more because their overhead is greater, and single 
practitioners who hang out their shingles in the town square charge 
less. Keep in mind, though, that the overall fees charged by the large 
firm are often comparable to those of the single practitioner because 
the large firm has staff such as trust and estate administrators (who 
are experts in this area but who bill their time at a much lower rate) 
actually perform the work; the attorney in charge mostly supervises. 
Attorneys bill hourly fee arrangements periodically, sometimes as often 
as monthly.
 
✓ Flat fee: Usually calculated as a percentage of the value of the estate. If 
the attorney manages to efficiently administer the estate, you know in 
advance how much the fee is, and the attorney usually walks away very 
happy. Flat fees are normally paid on a schedule or in partial payments 
whenever the attorney bills you. This sort of fee arrangement is most 
common in small- to medium-size estates, rather than larger estates, 
because not only the probate court but also the IRS must approve the 
fees an estate attorney charges if an estate tax return is filed.
 
✓ Contingency fee: Although rare in the world of trusts and estates, in 
certain circumstances an attorney may accept an estate on a contingency 
fee basis, or a percentage of the amount collected by the estate. If a trust 
or estate is suing another party in a lawsuit and stands to potentially 
receive a substantial cash award in the future, a lawyer may agree to 
represent it (and you, as fiduciary) in exchange for the chance of receiv-
ing a hefty piece of that award.
 
✓ Miscellaneous disbursements: No discussion of attorneys’ fees is com-
plete without alerting you to the fact that all the attorney’s fee covers 
is his time. Everything else is extra. Expect an itemized breakdown on 
every invoice of things like postage, photocopying, delivery services, 
filing fees, and even the sandwich you ate when you met the attorney for 
a lunchtime conference.

61
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Team Members and Knowing When to Use Them
 
Fees aren’t typically negotiable. An attorney presents you with her terms 
before you decide to do business. You can usually ask an attorney who nor-
mally charges a flat fee to bill you on an hourly basis, but those who charge 
hourly or on a contingent basis probably won’t change, although you may 
convince one to give you some sort of discount (perhaps you’re friends with 
her great-aunt?) Even a discounted rate will cost you plenty if the attorney is 
doing everything. The best, and surest, way to keep fees low is to do as much 
of the work as you can yourself.
Finalizing your decision
Whether you meet with one attorney or with several, you’ll eventually 
find one that fits your personality and wallet. Remember, your choice isn’t 
irrevocable. You may change attorneys at any time and for any reason. 
Unhappiness with your choice, even without professional misconduct or 
shady dealings, is reason to try again.
In order to formalize the arrangement between client and attorney, the attor-
ney may require that you sign an engagement letter, outlining the scope of the 
work to be performed, and each of your responsibilities. For example, you 
may be responsible for providing the attorney with all relevant information, 
and she may undertake to provide necessary forms and documents to be 
filed. Generally, these letters are formulaic, but you should still take the time 
to read through them carefully. Anything you don’t agree with can be crossed 
out and additions can be manually inserted, provided that both you and the 
attorney initial the changes. Ask questions if anything in the letter is unclear. 
After all, it’s your decedent’s money.
Working with your attorney
Hiring an attorney (or other professional) you like is only the first step. Now 
you have to work with him or her, and the success or failure of your new rela-
tionship rests on how responsive each of you is to the other.
 
Good communication is the key. When you receive requests for info, you 
should try to respond within a reasonable length of time. If you’re not able 
to give him or her a complete answer reasonably quickly, you should make a 
phone call or send an e-mail outlining where you are in the process and how 
soon you anticipate having a complete answer.

62
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
Hiring a Tax Professional
In the process of administering the estate or trust, you may find that the tax 
and accounting requirements are beyond what you’re happy or comfortable 
doing. If this describes you, having a tax professional, like a Certified Public 
Accountant (CPA) or an Enrolled Agent (EA) on your team, can help ensure 
that the trust or estate is always in compliance with tax and accounting rules.
You’re not alone if you’re not sure of the difference between a CPA and an 
EA. CPAs are qualified in all areas of public accounting, including taxation 
and auditing. EAs, on the other hand, specialize only in taxation. Because 
public accounting rules don’t apply to trusts and estates, both EAs and CPAs, 
if experienced in this type of work, can competently perform any of the 
accounting functions required, such as account preparation or figuring out 
how much, and what, property will roll from the estate to the trust after the 
estate terminates and trusts assume ownership of the decedent’s assets.
Choosing where to look for a professional advisor
Strange as it may seem, looking in your home-
town for the advisors you need to assist you 
in administering a trust or estate may not be 
the best choice. Because the estate must go 
through probate in the county in which the 
decedent lived when he or she died, choos-
ing an attorney or Certified Public Accountant 
licensed in that state is usually best. That attor-
ney or accountant will be up-to-date on all the 
specific rules for that state and will be able to 
more efficiently help you through whatever pro-
bate and/or tax issues you may have than an 
attorney or accountant from a different state 
can. As a matter of fact, if the attorney will be 
appearing or filing documents in the probate 
court on your behalf, he or she must be licensed 
to practice law in that state.
On occasion, the decedent will have owned 
property in more than one state, and probate 
must be established in each state where he 
or she owned real estate. In that case, your 
attorney may encourage you to hire attorneys 
in the other jurisdictions. In fact, attorneys who 
specialize in estate and trust work often have 
reciprocal arrangements with attorneys in 
states, such as Florida and Arizona, where many 
people own second homes. If you’re happy with 
the work your attorney is doing, odds are you’ll 
also be happy with the services of someone he 
recommends.
The location of your advisor makes no differ-
ence when your major concern is investing, 
although you do want to make certain that the 
advisor is aware of the estate or trust’s state 
of residence. This knowledge often affects the 
investments the advisor suggests to you. When 
probating an estate, be sure any advisor you 
select is licensed to do business in the estate’s 
state of domicile.
Finally, if your expert of choice is an Enrolled 
Agent, or someone who is licensed by the U.S. 
Treasury specifically to deal with tax and tax-
related issues, you may comfortably hire one 
from any state in the country. Enrolled Agents 
are licensed by the federal government, so they 
may practice in any of the states, territories, 
possessions, or commonwealths of the United 
States.

 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Team Members and Knowing When to Use Them
Whether you choose a CPA or an EA, both are subject to rigorous regulation 
and are required to participate annually in continuing education. Provided 
the person you choose has experience with trusts and/or estates, either is 
well qualified to assist you. This section can help you make the right choice.
Where to look
Unlike looking for an attorney where you can search a database, no single 
place exists for finding CPAs or EAs. If you’re searching for a CPA, you can 
check with the state board of accountancy in the state where you want to hire 
one, or with that state’s CPA professional association. You can locate EAs 
through their national professional organization, the National Association of 
Enrolled Agents (NAEA), or through their state or regional organizations.
In addition to assessing state licensing boards and state and federal profes-
sional organizations, you may also request referrals from family, friends, and 
other professionals, such as attorneys or investment advisors, who may keep 
lists of CPAs and EAs with whom they’ve dealt with in the past.
It’s common practice for CPAs or EAs to have you sign an engagement letter 
when you hire them, which outlines the scope of the work to be done, who is 
responsible for obtaining necessary information, and the level of review they 
will use to determine the accuracy of that info.
 
Hiring an accounting pro who will provide you with the service you need is 
really no different from hiring an attorney — you need to know that your work 
styles complement each other and that you won’t drive each other nuts during 
administration. You should ask any CPA or EA you’re considering employing 
the same questions you ask the attorney (check out the “Asking the right 
questions” section earlier). Don’t hesitate to add any others you may think of.
Discussing payment options
CPAs and EAs typically charge for their services, based on the number of hours 
worked or the number and type of tax forms prepared. In the case of a trust 
or estate, most bill on an hourly basis. Costs such as photocopying, postage, 
and deliveries are often additional, although individual accountants may cover 
these incidental costs by charging slightly more per hour. Accountants’ hourly 
fees are usually less than attorneys’, but they’re still in the same ballpark. Be 
prepared — we don’t want you to suffer from sticker shock.
 
Be sure to establish not only the hourly rate but also what it includes prior 
to having a tax professional prepare any work for you. It’s awful, both for 
you and your accountant, to have an initially positive relationship sour upon 
receipt of that first bill, purely on the basis of a misunderstanding.

64
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
Accountants, like attorneys, often have subordinates perform many of the 
tasks you’ve assigned to them, with Mr. or Ms. Big supervising the project and 
retaining the responsibility for its timely and accurate completion. Remember, 
the employee who actually performs the work is probably quite expert. As an 
added bonus, because the person doing most of the project is charging you 
less per hour, this practice is much more economical for you.
Considering Help from Other Pros
Very often, executors, administrators, and trustees are thrust into situations 
for which they have no preparation and no experience. You may find your-
self in this category as you attempt, for example, to dispose of Auntie Bess’s 
doll collection, rent Uncle Sam’s house, or invest Cousin Mercy’s millions. 
Figuring out what you have, what its value is in the estate or trust, and main-
taining that value, is often a job for the experts. This section highlights a few 
other professionals you may need to help you fulfill your duties as head of 
the estate or trust.
Determining whether you need 
an investment advisor
Both of us are reasonably savvy investors with decades of experience in vari-
ous investment strategies; we both can easily tell you the difference between 
stocks, bonds, and options. Despite our comfort with handling large sums of 
other peoples’ money, we wouldn’t hesitate to hire an investment advisor to 
advise us on investing estate or trust funds.
 
The unfortunate reality is that, in a world where corporations and individuals 
alike are sued for seemingly frivolous reasons, an executor or trustee who fails 
to act prudently to preserve the value of the assets is fair game for a lawsuit. If 
you’re in charge of assets that require investing, you should protect yourself 
against charges that you acted improperly; hiring an investment advisor pro-
vides you with an insurance policy against such accusations.
Doing it yourself (At your own risk)
Perhaps you’re leaning toward investing the money yourself. Maybe you 
assume that no one will else want the bother of managing the small pot of 
money you have to invest. But how do you even know if you have enough 
assets to bother with the expense of an investment advisor? If you have 
$600,000 or less, you may choose to use a full-service broker. He can advise 
you for the cost of the commission he makes on each stock or bond purchase 
and sale, or you may opt to invest in mutual funds (which are invested by a 
professional money manager), bypassing the need for a separate investment 

65
 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Team Members and Knowing When to Use Them
advisor. For larger amounts, or if you want to invest only in individual securi-
ties, you may want to hire a reputable advisor whom you trust. In making this 
decision, keep in mind that, unlike the trust assets, which may be in there for 
the long haul, estate assets are held for a relatively short time.
Because your duty as executor is to preserve, not grow, the estate, your 
investment decisions may be quite simple if your duty is to distribute the 
estate outright to the beneficiaries upon its termination instead of continu-
ing it in trust. See Chapter 7 for more on making the decision whether to sell 
assets to protect against your liability.
Going with an investment advisor
If you want to go with a professional to help you invest the money, you have 
a few options. However, unlike an attorney, CPA, or EA, who must be cre-
dentialed either by a state or the federal government in order to practice, an 
investment advisor doesn’t have to have any specific credentials. Among the 
professionals who offer financial advice are the following:
 
✓ Certified Financial Planners: Licensed by the Certified Financial 
Planner Board of Standards, these individuals have completed extensive 
additional education in addition to their bachelor’s degree.
 
✓ Attorneys, CPAs, or EAs: Their training isn’t specifically in investments, 
but many of them have become quite expert in this area because of the 
nature of their practice. Don’t assume that every attorney or tax profes-
sional is qualified to also act as your investment advisor, but don’t rule 
out the possibility, either.
 
✓ Stockbrokers: Full-service brokers not only purchase and sell securities 
for you but also research the companies they recommend. Stockbrokers 
must have passed the Series 7 exam in order to qualify. Remember, an 
online or discount broker doesn’t provide investment advice; he merely 
places the trades upon your instructions.
 
Knowing where to turn isn’t always easy, because no one-size-fits-all. Be sure 
to ask questions, starting with those you asked when hiring an attorney or 
a tax advisor (refer to those two applicable earlier sections). And add this 
important one: Could anyone else (like the insurance company the advisor 
works for, for example) benefit from the advisor’s recommendations? If you 
don’t like the answers, or think the advisor is promising you the moon in 
order to win your business, move onto the next name on your list. Like speed-
dating, if there’s anything that makes you uneasy in the first few minutes of 
conversation, chances are good that this advisor isn’t a good fit for you.
 
Investment advisors expect to be paid for their expertise, but their fees some-
times seem excessive. When negotiating what you’re willing to pay for these 
services, watch for certain warning signs.

66
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
✓ Commissions: Stockbrokers earn commissions each time they buy or 
sell stocks on your behalf. When stockbrokers have complete control of 
an investment account, they may churn the account, placing trades fre-
quently with the sole intention of earning more commissions. This prac-
tice is strongly frowned on. If you think your broker is churning (look 
for frequent trades, especially in small numbers of shares), you should 
question the broker and advise his supervisor. Short-term investing in 
a trust or estate account to capture market fluctuations is a no-no, and 
you, as fiduciary, shouldn’t permit it. When administering an estate, one 
of us found the broker had been churning her account before the dece-
dent’s death, so keep this idea in mind as you review those pre-death 
brokerage statements, too.
 
✓ Fee for service: This method is the safest way to pay for advice because 
you pay only for the time the advisor works on your investments. Of 
course, sometimes the bill may seem high to you. If you suspect that 
your advisor is padding the number of hours he is billing you and you’re 
not already receiving an itemized statement (which you may have 
thought to ask for when you established this relationship), you should 
ask to see a breakdown of the charges. But if the advice you’re receiving 
is good, you may not want to sour the relationship with this advisor by 
questioning his charges.
 
✓ Percentage fees: You’re most likely to see these fees from advisors who 
actively invest for you. You give them control of the investments, based 
on a written understanding between you as to the type of investing you 
desire. The advisor charges quarterly fees based on two components — a 
percentage of the market value of the security portfolio and a percent-
age of income (interest and dividends) earned by that portfolio. You may 
negotiate the fees at the time you and the advisor are establishing the 
contract. If you feel the advisor’s percentages are too high based on the 
portfolio’s size and how much work you believe will be involved, you can 
always ask for a lower percentage. Remember, the advisor wants your 
business, and his fees aren’t set in stone.
 
No one standard regulatory board oversees all investment advisors (although 
the SEC regulates many of them), so monitoring of them can be spotty. 
Because they often have almost unfettered access to the trust or estate’s 
assets, the potential for abuse can be high. Make sure you obtain and check 
references before you hire an advisor, and don’t shirk your responsibility by 
assuming that the investments are in safe hands. Constantly review the advi-
sor’s work, asking questions when something doesn’t make sense to you. 
Remember, someone else placed great trust in you and your judgment when 
they named you as fiduciary; use that good judgment to figure out when some-
thing just doesn’t smell right.

 Chapter 4: Assembling Your Team Members and Knowing When to Use Them
Obtaining appraisers where necessary
In a perfect world, property would only enter trusts and estates as cash, as 
stocks and bonds, or as precious metals, the value of which is easy to deter-
mine and maintain. Unfortunately, trusts and estates rarely inhabit a simple 
world and often include other assets, like the house, the car, jewelry, rental 
real estate, early 20th century Japanese art, or a comic-book stash. You, as 
executor or trustee, need to know what it’s all worth. And although you may 
be able to rely on yard-sale values or online auction sale prices for general 
household goods, you need to find a reputable appraiser for larger items like 
jewelry, artwork, and real estate.
 
When searching for an appraiser, go first to the source. If you’re holding 
Aunt Bertha’s diamond ring, and it’s still in the jeweler’s box with the name 
stamped on the cover, try to find that jeweler. He may still have the original 
documentation and will be able to prepare an official estimate of value without 
too much additional work. Likewise, real estate agents often have certified 
appraisers in their offices (many both sell and appraise property). If you need 
to value a rare coin collection, go to the local rare coin dealer. In fact, people 
who sell specialized property are used to appraising, and it’s typically one of 
the services they offer.
Of course, some property is one-of-a-kind and appraisals for these items can 
be notoriously difficult to obtain. In the case of artwork by an artist who’s 
still living, the gallery that represents his work should be able to provide you 
with a written appraisal. Auctioneers from top-echelon auction houses can 
provide appraisals for artwork from deceased artists as well as for antique 
furnishings. Occasionally, you’ll run across singular pieces of art or furnish-
ings that may require you to inquire of art museum curators.
 
Appraisals are increasingly coming under IRS scrutiny. If you need to obtain 
an appraisal, make sure that the person appraising the property is an expert 
in that field. The appraiser will, as a rule, attach to the appraisal a resume or 
curriculum vita showing his qualifications. If it’s not attached to the official 
appraisal, ask for it. Should the IRS ever question the valuations you use on 
a Form 706 (see Chapter 16), appraisals jotted down on a piece of paper may 
not fly, but one that documents the value of the item in question and the quali-
fications of the appraiser most likely will.
Consulting with other miscellaneous pros
Every estate and trust requires different levels and sorts of advice. Some 
additional professionals you may want to consult include

68
Par t I: Discovering the World of Estates and Trusts 
 
✓ Business consultants: If an asset of the trust or estate is an operating 
business, don’t be shy about finding someone to help you run it.
 
✓ Charitable advisors: If you’re trustee of a charitable foundation, repu-
table advisors can assist you in developing the foundation’s charitable 
direction and show you how to identify charitable organizations you 
may want the foundation to contribute to.
 
✓ Doctors and other medical professionals: As a trustee, you’re often 
charged with providing resources to guard the health and general well-
being of trust beneficiaries. Sometimes, you need to do more than just 
foot the bill — you actually have to make arrangements with various 
medical professionals for necessary services.
 
✓ Litigators: Even though you, as fiduciary, presumably already have an 
attorney, you may find you need representation in a lawsuit involving 
the estate or trust. Remember, the trust or estate’s attorney isn’t always 
experienced in litigation and in courtroom situations, and will probably 
refer you to a competent litigator in your area if you find yourself in this 
situation. He definitely won’t be offended if you go elsewhere for repre-
sentation, and in fact, should applaud the move.

W
hether you know in advance that someone has 
named you as their executor or you find out at the 
funeral that you’re the one who’s been chosen to wrap up 
the decedent’s affairs, facing the task of shepherding an 
estate from the decedent’s death all the way through to 
its eventual close can seem daunting. It’s not typically a 
small task, but it can be broken into easily digestible 
parts. Here we take you through each phase of the estate, 
from figuring out what you have, to paying what’s owed, 
to making distributions to the heirs and devisees, and 
finally to closing the estate.
Read through this entire part before you do anything, and 
then begin to make your plan. Remember that not every-
thing happens in sequence; sometimes you need to be 
working on more than one aspect of the estate simultane-
ously Your eventual success depends on how well you 
plan out all the tasks.

T
he decedent has died and you’re now in charge of everything, whether 
that’s because you advised him or her during life, you were friends, or 
you’re the only sibling he or she ever trusted. You may know that you’ve 
been appointed as executor, or you may be the only one, in all the confusion 
of death, who suspects the decedent had a last will and begins the search 
to find it. Whatever your scenario, you may have many questions, including 
some you don’t yet know you have! Read on for the answers.
This chapter discusses the immediate issues arising after the decedent dies, 
everything from dealing with the decedent’s physical remains to how the sit-
uation regarding the decedent’s assets changes when he or she dies to what 
the estate planning documents are and how to locate them, how to identify 
heirs-at-law and beneficiaries, how to notify everyone who needs to be noti-
fied about the decedent’s death, and how to stay organized. Although we’re 
not the “estate whisperers,” we do help you tame that not-so-bad 
tiger — estate administration.

Part II: Administering an Estate 
Addressing the Immediate Concerns 
When Someone Dies
After someone dies, you may be grieving and in shock, which is very under-
standable. However, some immediate matters need to be addressed. Some 
may present themselves immediately; they may occur to you naturally, or 
you may just need to bear them in mind and watch out for them. You need to 
make sure that the following matters are taken care of. Some of them may not 
be relevant to your decedent, but others are a necessity.
Honoring anatomical gifts
As soon as someone dies, make sure that you check to see whether the dece-
dent had a notation on his or her driver’s license or a donor card, personal 
identification card, or other legally recognized document by which he or she 
indicated a desire to make an anatomical gift. Sometimes the decedent will 
have told loved ones of this decision as well. If the decedent’s wishes regard-
ing anatomical donation aren’t clear, and the possibility exists of using his 
or her organs for transplant, the doctors or other hospital staff will explain 
the available donation options to the family or next of kin. Donation depends 
upon the family or next of kin’s assent; if they agree to the donation made, 
the organs will be harvested and the body will then be available for a funeral 
and burial or cremation.
Even if organ or tissue donation isn’t made, the decedent may have donated 
his or her body to a medical school or other institution. The donation may 
even be contained in a letter of intent located with the estate plan documents. 
If the decedent donated his or her remains, contact the institution and they’ll 
make arrangements for, and cover all costs of, transportation and eventual cre-
mation. Most will return the cremated remains to the family, if desired.
Having an autopsy performed
Where the decedent’s death may have been the result of violence, foul play, 
or other unnatural causes, or for various reasons detailed in individual state 
laws, the state medical examiner can perform an autopsy, whether or not the 
family consents. In this case, the medical examiner’s office bears the cost of 
the autopsy. On the other hand, the family may choose to request an autopsy 
when it suspects the possibility of medical malpractice (or for other medi-
cal reasons). If the family wants to request an autopsy, it should inform the 
attending physician immediately. In the unlikely event the body has been 
transported to a funeral home, the family should immediately inform the 

73
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
funeral director (who normally won’t embalm the body without the consent 
of the family) so that embalming doesn’t occur. The family bears the autopsy 
cost if it requests the procedure for suspected medical malpractice. If the 
hospital itself is concerned about a possible medical error, it sometimes 
requests that the medical examiner’s office do an autopsy so that a disinter-
ested third party performs it.
Arranging the Funeral
As executor, you may be asked to arrange the decedent’s funeral. Be sure to 
consult with the decedent’s family, both as a possible source for the dece-
dent’s wishes and to honor those of close family members. Sometimes, the 
decedent has left written wishes as to his or her funeral. Look through the 
decedent’s personal papers, especially copies of his or her estate planning 
documents, to see if he or she left anything in writing with the other docu-
ments. Less frequently (but it does happen), a decedent has also written his 
or her own obituary. As helping hands go, you don’t get much better than 
that — after all, who knew more about what was important in the life just 
ended than the decedent himself?
 
Funerals, like weddings, are one of those life events where everyone’s nerves 
are on edge, and feuds ignite out of the slightest of miscues. Tread very care-
fully as you plan the funeral. Consult, consult, and consult again. Don’t rely 
on the say-so of just one family member; check in with several. Remember, 
any hard feelings that arise now will carry through the entire course of estate 
administration. Invest a little extra time to get it right. One of us remembers an 
aunt who was buried by the wrong (also known as “the other”) funeral direc-
tor in town. Who knows, the funeral may have been beautiful, but all anyone 
remembers is that it was held in an unfamiliar chapel among — gasp — strang-
ers who didn’t know us.
Making important decisions
From the time of the decedent’s death, you make sensitive decisions that can 
mean as much to the family as how you manage the estate.
Choosing a funeral director
Wherever the decedent died, unless they or their family donated organs or 
their cadaver, their body must go to a funeral home for cremation or prepara-
tion for burial. You don’t need to figure out how to do this; the funeral direc-
tor will make all arrangements for transportation of the body and complete 
all the necessary paperwork.

74
Part II: Administering an Estate 
The family may have a funeral director they always use, or the decedent’s 
church or temple, if the decedent had a connection to one, may typically use a 
particular funeral home. If the family or the decedent’s clergyperson is unable 
to guide you, make sure that any funeral director you consider is a member of 
a state funeral directors association and/or a national association. Check with 
the local Better Business Bureau to see if a director has any complaints.
Death notice or obituary
You may pay to put a small death notice in the newspaper in major cities. If 
the decedent was very well known, the newspaper may also publish an obitu-
ary, which contains more information about the decedent’s family and life. 
Frequently the funeral director will gather information from you or the family 
and submit it to the appropriate newspaper for write-up and publication You 
may even have a decedent who writes his or her own obituary in advance, as did 
one of our relatives. Many families now want a more personalized obituary and 
submit one already written. You may assist the family in this task, or you may 
write it yourself. Either way, it’s an important testament to the decedent’s life.
If your decedent lives in a suburb or smaller town, the local newspaper will no 
doubt publish a submitted obituary. In many small towns, the obituary section 
is the first thing readers turn to when they open their newspapers. Newspapers 
have figured this out, and now encourage the contribution of more information 
about the decedent than ever before for inclusion in the obituary.
Funeral or memorial service
Funerals occur anywhere from the day after death to a week or more after-
wards, depending on religious and local custom, and whether family must 
travel to attend. Some families hold a wake, also known as calling hours, at 
the funeral home during set hours (usually on the day before the funeral) or 
a shiva (usually for three or seven days after the funeral). A memorial service 
is held at a later time, sometimes so that family can plan to travel to it.
If close family is available, they most likely want to be very involved in plan-
ning all funeral and memorial observances. More and more commonly, family 
members want to prepare photo boards or albums of the decedent and the 
family and to display mementos like framed wedding photos and photos of 
family groups or other significant events. You want to be sure that flowers 
are ordered, if appropriate for the decedent’s funeral tradition, and ask the 
family to choose a charity to which memorial contributions can be made, or 
if the family prefers, to let donors choose their own charities.
You may need pallbearers, in which case the family may want to choose who 
has this honor. Usually, six sturdy men are necessary, but other older or 
frailer folks can be honorary pallbearers. Although the tradition is that men 
be the pallbearers, nothing but tradition says that a woman can’t be one. And 
of course, if the decedent left specific wishes, such as the desire to be buried 
in a blue velour tux (and it’s your grandmother, not grandfather), those 
wishes should be honored to the extent they’re legal.

75
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
 
On the day of the funeral or memorial service, arrange for someone to watch 
the house — burglars read the obituaries and death notices.
Assigning eulogies
If a clergyperson is presiding at the funeral, he or she will, of course, talk 
about the decedent. But in some cases the officiant didn’t actually know the 
decedent personally and has gathered information and memories from family 
members or close friends. A personal eulogy given by a family member or 
close friend can be a meaningful addition to the service. You can ask the 
family who may be appropriate or want to perform this honor. The family 
may also opt to allow a time in some services when any who want to are 
offered the opportunity to speak.
 
Consider vetting written eulogies before the words are spoken. In our experi-
ence, funerals can be opportunities to make enemies (often unintentionally). 
Although we don’t advocate censorship in the ordinary course, funerals are 
a time to bring families and friends together, and to remember the deceased 
fondly (and maybe even with some humor). It’s not the appropriate forum to 
air dirty laundry or attempt to redress past injustices.
Finding an appropriate clergyperson
The decedent may have had a close relationship with a clergyperson or may 
have rarely crossed the threshold of a place of worship. If the decedent didn’t 
even have a place of worship, the question may even arise as to what, if any, 
kind of service the decedent would have wanted to have. Any information left 
by the decedent is helpful here, but the immediate family’s wishes usually 
trump. The funeral home is always an appropriate setting for the funeral ser-
vice, and in some religious denominations, it’s the traditional setting.
Cremation versus interment
As cemeteries fill up and traditional burials become increasingly expensive, 
cremation is rapidly overtaking burial as the most popular way to deal with 
remains. If the decedent wanted to be cremated (with or without burial), he 
or she will typically have made his or her wishes known to his or her spouse 
or other family members or friends. The decedent’s spouse or other family 
members may also make the decision to use cremation. If no one close to the 
decedent is available, or wants to make this choice, it becomes yours; either 
is okay. Remember, even cremated remains may be buried in a cemetery, 
either in an actual plot or a columbarium, a wall with drawers for the ashes.
Choosing a cemetery
Several options are available when choosing a final resting place for the dece-
dent’s remains:

76
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
✓ If the decedent has prepurchased a plot (frequently several plots 
together, for themselves and additional family members), your problem 
is solved: You use the prepurchased plot.
 
✓ If no family plot exists, most active cemeteries still have lots available 
for sale, either through the cemetery, or the resale by private parties 
of unused lots previously purchased. Choose a cemetery in a place sig-
nificant to the decedent or one that you and other family members may 
easily visit, if you so choose.
 
✓ When the decedent has been cremated, family members frequently 
choose to scatter the remains in a meaningful location. In California, 
many services provide everything needed for a burial at sea, from the 
paperwork to the boat to biodegradable urns. One of us has a cousin 
who chose to scatter her mother’s ashes in the rapids of a river near our 
childhood home. And another family we know of divided their father’s 
remains among the children, with each to choose their own special 
location for their share of the remains.
Headstone or grave marker
Although you don’t need to order the grave marker immediately, it’s an 
important task to take care of. If your decedent has a predeceased spouse, 
the plot may already have a grave marker with room for the decedent’s 
memorial information, in which case you can simply have the appropriate 
information about the decedent added.
Special burial rights for veterans
If the decedent was an honorably discharged veteran, several benefits are 
available through the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The follow-
ing list gives a few of these benefits; check out the VA’s Web site (www.cem.
va.gov/cem/) for more info.
 
✓ United States flag: Veterans are entitled to a U.S. flag to place folded in 
the open casket, drape the casket, or accompany the urn. The funeral 
home typically arranges for this, or you can go to the VA’s Web site to 
obtain the flag yourself.
 
✓ Burial in a national cemetery: Veterans, their spouses, and their depen-
dents may be buried at any of the national cemeteries with available 
space (currently 125 with more in the works) for no charge, including 
grave opening and closing and perpetual care.
 
✓ Headstone or marker: Whether buried in a national cemetery or not, 
eligible veterans are entitled to a government headstone or marker, 
provided by the VA, for their unmarked grave. For eligible veterans who 
died after November 1, 1990, the headstone is available even if the site 
already has a private headstone, and as of spring 2009, those whose 
grave is already marked have the choice of applying for either a tradi-
tional headstone or marker or a new device which can be affixed to the 
private headstone.

77
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
 
✓ Presidential Memorial Certificate: The Presidential Memorial Certificate 
is an engraved paper certificate, signed by the current president, that’s 
intended to honor the memory of honorably discharged deceased veter-
ans. Loved ones and next of kin may apply for the certificate, and more 
than one may be issued. You can download the application on the VA’s 
Web site.
 
✓ Burial allowance: Deceased veterans may be entitled to a burial 
allowance. For further information, call 800-827-1000.
Providing a collation
In many American cultures, a collation, or light meal, is traditional after the 
funeral service. It can be held anywhere from the decedent’s home, with 
neighbors and church members (or a catering service) supplying the food, to 
a church hall or restaurant. When ordering food, be aware of local and reli-
gious custom. For example, one of us has the custom of greeting the mourn-
ers as they return from the cemetery (the spouse, children, and siblings of 
the deceased) with hard-boiled eggs, which symbolize the continuity of life. 
As always, if you’re not sure what to do, ask. Family members, a clergyper-
son, or even the funeral director may be able to give you guidance.
Paying for funeral costs
The estate may pay for all reasonable funeral costs, to the extent that funds 
are available. The key word is “reasonable.” A judge may disallow payment of 
funeral expenses found to be unreasonable. In many states, funeral expenses, 
expenses of last illness, and administration expenses take precedence over 
all other claims against the estate. But if your decedent’s estate may be short 
of funds, keep all funeral expenses to a modest amount. Of course, funds in a 
decedent’s funded revocable trust can be used to pay expenses, if necessary. 
If the decedent had a checking account joint with his or her surviving spouse, 
payment can come from that account, with the amount to be repaid from 
other funds if the spouse doesn’t ultimately receive the entire estate, minus 
expenses. Sometimes the funeral home will wait for payment until the execu-
tor or administrator is appointed, but it frequently adds interest to the bill 
after a set amount of time. You may even apply for temporary executorship 
to pay for the funeral.
Funeral trusts, where the decedent prepaid for his or her funeral, have 
become much more common as people are increasingly loathe to land a large 
funeral bill on the heads of their families. Be sure to check with the named 
funeral home if such a trust exists. If you suspect the decedent had a trust, 
but you’re not sure with which funeral home, make all the calls before the 
funeral; it would be a shame to have to pay for a funeral at one home when 
another home already received payment.

78
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
Don’t let the funeral director talk you into something that just doesn’t seem 
right to you. Although his or her ideas may be great, they may also be an 
attempt to sell you additional services that you don’t want or need. Making 
these decisions just hours after the decedent’s death is difficult, and after 
they’ve had a chance to reflect on a funeral just passed, some people would 
have done something different. Remember, the funeral director isn’t only 
helping you at a very stressful point but is also running a business and always 
keeping an eye on the financial bottom line.
Obtaining copies of the death certificate
You can’t even begin to tackle the tasks in front of you without proof that 
the decedent actually died. Be sure to get a number of certified copies of the 
death certificate to give to anyone that may need to know about this particu-
lar death. For example, you need copies for the probate court (if probate is 
necessary), for taxing authorities, for each life insurance company, and to 
collect other death benefits (just to name a few). You pay a small cost for 
each copy, but the convenience of having them on hand far outweighs that 
cost. Usually the funeral director obtains them for you. Otherwise, you can 
get them through the appropriate office in your state, which may be the 
county clerk’s office or the state department of vital statistics.
 
Although death certificates are a matter of public record, they’re also a mine-
field of information for identity thieves, who treat this information like a kid 
in a candy shop. You can’t prevent identity thieves from obtaining this infor-
mation directly from state authorities, but you don’t need to make their lives 
easier by handing it to them. Make sure that someone asking you for a death 
certificate has a valid reason for needing one before you hand it over.
Understanding How Death Changes 
Everything about the Decedent’s Assets
When someone dies, assets owned only by him or her in individual name are 
essentially frozen. Frozen assets are simply inaccessible (that is, neither you 
as future executor nor anyone else has access to them or can sell, transfer, 
or take any other action with regard to them); you don’t have to worry about 
them getting freezer burn like your favorite ice cream. Until you manage to 
unfreeze those assets by being appointed as executor, you can’t use them. 
A few types of jointly owned property do pass immediately to the surviving 
owner upon the other owner’s death:

79
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
 
✓ Anything held in joint names with right of survivorship (assets which 
automatically pass to the survivor or survivors on the first person’s 
death)
 
✓ Anything owned as tenants by the entireties (a form of joint ownership of 
real estate with rights of survivorship that’s only available to husband 
and wife)
 
✓ Assets (typically bank accounts) designated POD (payable on death) 
This section explains the impact death has on a decedent’s assets. They 
aren’t available until you’re appointed as executor, and that handy power 
of attorney that was so useful during the decedent’s life is now useless. For 
now, and until you’re appointed as the estate’s executor, you can’t manage 
the decedent’s assets and no funds are available.
Bank accounts and the need for funds
All assets in the decedent’s name alone have to go through the probate pro-
cess, either according to his or her will or the laws of intestacy (a fancy way 
of saying he or she left no will); bank accounts owned by the decedent alone 
are no different. Money in these accounts isn’t available to the family or the 
executor until the executor has been appointed. Only then can bank accounts 
be transferred into an account in the estate’s name.
 
You may open traditional bank checking and/or savings accounts for an 
estate, or you may opt to use fiduciary services available from commercial 
banks, investment houses, or in some states, law firm trust departments. As 
we discussed earlier in the chapter (regarding paying for funeral arrange-
ments), you can request appointment as temporary executor or special admin-
istrator if the estate has an urgent need for funds. Chapter 7 discusses how to 
track down the decedent’s bank accounts.
Powers of attorney
 
Powers of attorney (documents appointing others to act on the grantor’s behalf 
regarding any or all of his or her assets or financial matters) may only be used 
while the grantor of the power is alive; when the decedent dies, so does the 
power of attorney. Because the grantor’s death cancels the power, don’t try to 
act under its authority after his or her death. Any separate powers of attorney 
that the decedent may have executed regarding bank accounts also lose their 
effectiveness with the decedent’s death.

80
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Locating the Estate Planning Documents
When a person dies, one of your many important tasks is to locate the estate 
planning documents. Frequently, the decedent has photocopies of them in a 
file at home or in his or her safe-deposit box. If the surviving spouse hasn’t 
personally handed them to you, see whether you can find a home file and 
search the decedent’s papers accordingly. You can also check with the dece-
dent’s attorney or other advisors because they may well have the originals of 
the will and other estate plan documents in their will vault; at the very least, 
they hopefully have copies, even if the originals are elsewhere. This section 
highlights the important documents you need to find.
The last will and testament (The will)
The most important document to locate is the decedent’s last will and testa-
ment. The decedent may have placed his or her will on file with the probate 
court for safekeeping. This practice isn’t the same as filing the will for pro-
bate. If you find more than one will, the most recent will governs.
The decedent may also have made changes to his or her will, called codicils, 
which don’t revoke the will but expressly add to, change, or remove some-
thing from the will. A person can add an unlimited number of codicils to a 
will. However, because interpreting the many codicils is cumbersome, an 
entirely new will is usually written after a few codicils have been added. The 
original of a codicil is always kept with the original will (at least in theory).
Trust agreements and amendments
You also want to locate any trust agreements and amendments to them that 
the decedent may have had. Although only one copy of a will is signed, you 
usually have at least two signed copies of a trust because an original copy 
may be needed in the transfer of assets to the trust and for other administra-
tive purposes. At least one signed copy of the trust should be located with 
the original will, as should any amendments to the trust.
Even if the trust began its life as a revocable living trust, a trust designed to 
receive assets from the grantor (the trust’s creator) during his or her life-
time, it becomes irrevocable (unable to be changed) at the grantor’s death. 
Depending on what the will’s terms are, this trust may not only continue with 
assets placed in it during the grantor’s lifetime, but it may also stand ready to 
accept assets from the decedent’s estate.

81
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
Just as wills may be amended by codicil, trust instruments may also be 
changed during the grantor’s lifetime by amending the trust. An amendment 
must be agreed to by the trustee(s), because they signed on to administer 
the trust under its original terms only. But if the trustees don’t want to agree 
to the amendment, the creator of the trust can simply change the trustees.
Letters of intent
Sometimes you find a letter of intent written before the decedent’s death on a 
subject he or she didn’t want to put in his or her will (which becomes a public 
document when it’s filed for probate) or trust. The letter of intent can be 
about something such as who is to get which personal and household articles 
(although hopefully any instructions regarding an item of great value, such as 
a piece of jewelry or work of art, are specifically spelled out in the will, to avoid 
controversy among the heirs). Letters of intent can be valuable tools in helping 
you carry out the decedent’s wishes, because they’re often filled with the 
decedent’s own words rather than language that has been legally filtered.
Opening the safe-deposit box and locating the 
original will
If the safe-deposit box is in the decedent’s name 
alone, normally no one can access it until the 
decedent’s will has been admitted to probate. 
This can pose a problem if you can’t locate the 
original will (although some legal documents 
are executed in multiples, only one will is ever 
signed at a time), and you think the safe-deposit 
box may contain the will. (Note that, in certain 
circumstances, if the original will can’t be found, 
a copy can be admitted to probate.)
Some safe-deposit box contracts provide that, 
upon proof of the vault holder’s death (such as 
a death certificate), a search of the box can be 
made for the will by an officer of the bank at 
the request of an appropriate party (such as 
the surviving spouse or next of kin). If the safe-
deposit box is held by the decedent as a joint 
tenant, the surviving joint tenant(s) may access 
the box, but the surviving spouse or another 
representative of the estate may request to be 
present. As a matter of fact, the surviving joint 
tenant(s) would be wise to have a witness pres-
ent when they open the box, to witness (in writ-
ing) what’s contained in the box.
If the bank doesn’t allow entrance to the safe-
deposit box for a will search, some states allow 
you to file a petition for appointment of a spe-
cial administrator of the estate with the probate 
court so that the special administrator can open 
the box.
Most states no longer seal the safe-deposit 
box upon death, as was once common, but 
some states do still require the presence of a 
representative of the state taxing authority be 
present when the box is opened to make sure 
that no taxable assets disappear before they’re 
counted. Check with your state taxing authority 
to see whether it requires this practice.

82
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Other documents that dispose of property
Don’t forget to look for life insurance policies with beneficiary designations 
attached, copies of beneficiary designations as to the decedents retirement 
plans and individual retirement accounts, and any other assets with death 
benefits, all of which may be located neatly with the estate plan documents, 
or scattered throughout the decedent’s files, or in some cases, throughout the 
house. Chapter 7 gives details on how best to locate all the decedent’s assets.
Notifying Those Who Need to be Notified
As executor, you may feel that your job is primarily to write letters, because 
you need to notify seemingly everyone and their uncle of the decedent’s 
death. Some entities and individuals may be more important than others, but 
you should notify them all as soon as possible.
 
You can save yourself some time by creating your own version of a form letter 
that can be modified easily for each recipient. Keep it on your computer’s desk-
top and revise it as needed. You can keep saved electronic copies of each letter 
sent in a folder on your desktop so you can easily identify who you’ve sent let-
ters to. The bottom line: Make sure that you organize all this correspondence. 
(Check out “Setting up a filing system” later in this chapter for more info.)
 
Make sure that you contact the following entities and individuals to inform 
them of the decedent’s death:
 
✓ The decedent’s attorney, accountant, and so on: At your earliest con-
venience, contact the decedent’s attorney, accountant, investment advi-
sor, insurance agent, and any other professional you’re aware of Each 
may have valuable information that can save you hours of searching 
for the decedent’s estate plan documents, copies of tax returns, asset 
information, and personal information. The surviving spouse and other 
family members will likely be able to give you the names of these profes-
sionals. You also may meet them at the funeral or memorial service. And 
you may find their names in the decedent’s personal papers, so don’t 
forget to check the papers scattered across the decedent’s desk.
 
✓ Heirs-at-law and beneficiaries: You want to identify the heirs-at-law 
(persons who inherit if the decedent didn’t have a will) and the benefi-
ciaries (persons who inherit under the will) as soon as possible. If no 
will exists, you’re required to notify the heirs-at-law of your petition for 
probate; if a will does exist, notify both the heirs-at-law and the benefi-
ciaries. Be sure to get the beneficiaries’ addresses, telephone numbers, 
and Social Security Numbers, and the heirs-at-law’s addresses.
 
 The surviving spouse and/or other family members can provide family 
information to help you determine the heirs-at-law. After you find 

83
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
the last will, you can determine from it who the beneficiaries are. See 
Appendix B for a state-by-state listing of the laws of intestacy (dying 
without a will) to help you identify the heirs-at-law.
 
✓ Social Security Administration: Call the Social Security Administration 
(SSA) at 800-772-1213 or contact the local SSA office (the local office can 
sometimes be easier to deal with than the phone system) to report the 
decedent’s death. If the decedent was receiving his or her benefits by 
direct deposit, notify the bank of the decedent’s death and request that it 
return any funds it receives for the month of death and beyond to the SSA.
 
 Don’t close the bank account that’s receiving direct deposits before any 
Social Security checks have arrived and been returned to the SSA, or the 
checks may be in limbo! If the decedent was receiving his or her benefits 
by check, don’t cash any check for the month of the decedent’s death or 
later; return them to the SSA. The estate isn’t entitled to the payments 
made in the month of death because Social Security payments are actu-
ally made for the month ahead, and you don’t get partial payments for 
partial months. So, if the decedent died midway through the month, that 
month’s payment must be returned.
 
✓ Veterans’ Administration: If the decedent was receiving veterans’ bene-
fits, call 800-827-1000 to report his or her death. You should also inquire 
about burial entitlements and other benefits that may be available to a 
surviving spouse or minor children. See “Special burial rights for veter-
ans” earlier in this chapter, as well as Chapter 7, for a discussion.
 
✓ Pension and other retirement plans: Notify each of the retirement plans 
in which the decedent had an interest, whether the plan was sponsored 
by an employer or created by the decedent. See Chapter 7 for info on 
the different retirement plans the decedent may have.
 
✓ Employer and employees: If they aren’t already aware of the decedent’s 
death, notify the decedent’s employer and/or employees as applicable.
 
✓ United State Postal Service: If no surviving spouse is still living at the 
decedent’s residence, file a change of address form with the post office, 
indicating where the decedent’s mail should be sent and signing it as 
executor. If the decedent’s spouse survives, you needn’t notify the post 
office, but ask the spouse to send along pertinent mail to you, such as 
bills in the decedent’s name alone. The spouse may also choose to pay 
them and seek reimbursement from the estate, but should save copies 
of those paid bills for you.
 
✓ The decedent’s landlord, if any: Notify the landlord of the decedent’s 
death , and if the surviving spouse doesn’t want to continue the lease 
(or there is no surviving spouse), vacate the premises as soon as is con-
venient, after allowing time for proper disposition of the decedent’s per-
sonal and household articles as discussed in Chapter 7. In some cases, 
you may find that you need to keep that home for a while until you can 
make appropriate distribution. Be sure to review the lease; some leases 
may have a provision for termination upon death. In many cases, you 
can reach an agreement with the landlord for early termination.

84
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
✓ Creditors of the decedent, including credit card companies: Notifying 
them of the decedent’s death and the new address for statements makes 
them aware that you’re planning to pay the bills when allowed by the 
court (see Chapter 8). If any debts are in both spouses’ names and the 
surviving spouse has the funds to make the payments, he or she should 
make them so that his or her credit rating isn’t affected. You can pay the 
spouse back later from estate funds if it’s a debt of the decedent. Make 
sure any surviving spouse has credit cards in his or her own name.
 
✓ Utilities: Have them transferred to the surviving spouse’s name, if 
applicable; if the decedent has no surviving spouse, have the utility 
bills mailed to you until you’ve cleared out the decedent’s residence, at 
which time arrange for the utilities to be shut off.
 
✓ Membership organizations of which the decedent was a member: If the 
surviving spouse wants to continue a membership, arrange it.
Creating Calendars and Files
Administering an estate is a drawn-out process, one filled with a great deal of 
minutiae. Keeping organized and thorough records of all estate activity, from 
the decedent’s date of death onward, will prevent the terror of wondering 
whether you’ve missed one of those (we hate to say it) drop-dead deadlines. 
It also can save you hours of time as you prepare the estate inventory (see 
Chapter 7), estate accountings (see Chapter 10), income tax returns (see 
Chapter 18), federal estate tax return (see Chapters 16 and 17) and any state 
estate or inheritance tax returns (see Appendix B for applicable state laws). It 
also makes it easy to answer questions posed by probate court judges, estate 
beneficiaries, and tax auditors, to name a few. This section highlights the two 
types of calendars you need, as well as how to keep everything in order.
Eyeing what kind of calendar to create
The best way to stay organized is to create a calendar with all your estate’s 
important dates. Whether you choose to create the calendar on your com-
puter or on paper, make sure to insert all of your estate deadlines as soon 
as you become aware of them, and refer to your calendar daily to keep your 
administration on track.
 
When putting your calendar together, you can devise a system to remind you 
of deadlines or what task you need to attend to next, even if your system con-
sists of reviewing your calendar on a daily basis. You may refer to Chapters 
6–9 in creating your calendar, but, of course, your specific deadlines depend 
on your estate, whether it’s going through probate, and the decedent’s state of 
residence.

85
 Chapter 5: Taking the First Steps after Death
 
✓ For probate/non-probate administration: Lists all the tasks to be done 
with regard to both the probate and the non-probate estate in chrono-
logical order, based on your situation and the assets of your decedent. 
You don’t want to miss an important date; for instance, if you miss your 
deadline to prove to the probate court that you’ve notified all the benefi-
ciaries, you may have to redo the entire notice procedure to each benefi-
ciary, greatly increasing your time spent and delaying your appointment 
as executor. Refer to your calendar daily; make additions as you find 
out about new requirements, and bathe in the glow of your accomplish-
ments as you meet each deadline in a timely manner.
 
✓ Calendar for tax deadlines: Keeping track of the many tax deadlines is 
very important when you’re an executor of an estate. Missing a tax dead-
line can mean that the estate is charged penalties and interest on any 
tax due. And because filing tax returns and making payments on time is 
your duty as executor, the probate court can hold you liable (and benefi-
ciaries can sue you) if your oversight leads to a missed deadline.
 
 You may want to create separate calendars for each type of tax: federal 
estate tax, state estate or inheritance tax, estate income tax, and final 
year(s) income tax return of the decedent. Or you can integrate all of 
your types of taxes into one calendar. See Chapters 16–18 regarding 
taxes.
Setting up a filing system
An organized filing system for your estate and trust means the difference 
between order and chaos in your administration of the estate. You may 
choose to organize as much as you can electronically, but you still have to 
deal with plenty of paperwork in administering an estate. If you don’t have a 
file that locks, get one and keep the estate paperwork (which is, after all, con-
fidential) safely locked away when you’re not working with it.
You can create a file (legal length files sold at an office supply store are best) 
for the estate with separate file folders within the file for each topic. Some 
topics may require more file space than others. As a folder grows, you may 
find you want an entirely separate file for it. Folders within the estate file 
may start out with titles such as “Correspondence and memos,” which may 
contain all general correspondence and notes, in reverse date order, with the 
newest on top. You can pin all papers in the folder to keep things in order.
 
Always make a note of every phone call you make or receive and meeting you 
have relating to the estate and file it in the appropriate folder. Be sure to date 
the record and note the name of the person(s) you spoke with. You don’t need 
to craft a lovely memo. Just be sure to note every point that’s covered. This 
practice will prove invaluable when you’re following up on any estate matter.

86
Part II: Administering an Estate 
File folders for the estate administration file may include
 
✓ Correspondence and memos.
 
✓ Federal estate tax return (Form 706). This one can easily become an 
entirely separate file.
 
✓ State inheritance (or estate) tax.
 
✓ Probate pleadings (just a fancy way of labeling all the probate court 
paperwork).
 
✓ Life insurance.
 
✓ Retirement benefits.
 
✓ Decedent’s income tax returns.
 
✓ Estate income tax returns.
 
✓ Debts of the decedent and claims against the estate.
 
 However you choose to organize your records, keep a separate record 
of the decedent’s debts, your evidence of the debt, and an ongoing 
record of your payment of debts.
 
✓ Estate assets.
 
✓ Any other topics that arise in your estate.
We’re firm believers in to-do lists. They help keep you focused on both what 
you have to do today, including the best order in which to accomplish it, 
and what you need to accomplish long term. You may want to have multiple 
lists, one for daily, one for weekly, and one for monthly tasks. Create them on 
the computer or by hand, whatever works for you, and just wait for that feel-
good moment when you cross another item off the list.

Chapter 6
Navigating the Probate Process
In This Chapter
▶ Submitting the will to the court
▶ Deciding whether and what kind of probate is necessary
▶ Having the executor or administrator appointed
▶ Considering the surviving spouse’s necessary decisions
T
he decedent has been laid to rest and you’ve handled the immediate 
tasks after the death. (Refer to Chapter 5 for what you need to do after 
the decedent has died.) Now that you’ve had a moment to breath, you need 
to take the next steps in wrapping up the decedent’s affairs. Now’s the time 
(probably within a week after the decedent’s funeral) to decide whether you 
need probate court administration of any of the decedent’s assets, and if so, 
how to keep probate as simple as possible. Probate is the process whereby 
the decedent’s will, if any, is proved valid or invalid and the assets in the 
decedent’s name alone, or payable to the estate, are administered in the pro-
bate estate with probate court supervision.
This chapter explains how to get the decedent’s will (if any) recognized by 
the probate court, and how to get yourself appointed as executor(s) (the 
decedent may name more than one executor to act together). And we point 
out what happens if for whatever reason you’re the person charged with 
administering the decedent’s estate even though he or she didn’t leave a will. 
We also discuss how to create the probate inventory. And if the decedent has 
a surviving spouse, that person may have some decisions to make. Last, we 
discuss how a beneficiary or heir can disclaim property.
 
Throughout this chapter we make reference to state law and probate court 
rules. No two states’ laws are exactly the same, no two states’ probate court 
rules are the same, and as a matter of fact, probate court practices can differ 
from county to county. And not all courts that administer wills are called “pro-
bate courts.” So when we discuss the procedure for probating your decedent’s 
property, you can pretty much count on some quirk in how your decedent’s 
county and state handle probate administration that’s different from the 
quirkiness we describe here. We also refer, in general, to the executor. But 
if there’s no valid will, you’re the administrator. In some states you’re called 

88
Part II: Administering an Estate 
the personal representative or some other name, but we’re still referring to the 
person appointed to administer the estate. And the term fiduciary refers to all 
of the above. That’s the beauty of individual state law!
Filing the Last Will with the Probate 
(Or Equivalent) Court
In most states, the person who has possession of the will is required to 
deliver the will to the executor or file the will with the probate court within 
a certain period of time (for instance, 30 days) after the decedent’s death. If 
you’re in the delicate position of knowing who has the will but hasn’t filed 
it, you may notify the court so that the court can compel the filing. Then 
the probate process can begin. In practice, you file the will with the petition 
for probate if you decide probate is required, hopefully within that 30-day 
window. Most courts give you some leeway, but make sure that you know if 
your probate court will. If it turns out there are no assets requiring probate, 
simply take the will to the probate court and sign a statement to that effect.
 
If the decedent left a will but the estate doesn’t have any assets subject to 
probate, the law still requires you to file the will. Just inform the probate 
court that, to your knowledge, no assets are subject to probate. This situa-
tion can arise when
 
✓ The decedent has fully funded (that is, transferred all of his or her 
assets into) his or her revocable trust before death.
 
✓ The decedent held all of his or her assets jointly with rights of 
survivorship with the surviving spouse or other persons.
 
✓ The decedent may have died penniless (which makes your job much 
easier).
Figuring Out Whether Administration 
Is Necessary
Before you can decide whether probate court administration is neces-
sary, you first need to get an accurate picture of all the assets in the estate. 
Chapter 7 explains how to uncover every asset you possibly can. You need a 
good idea of both the size of the assets and how the title is held. Remember, 
anything held in the decedent’s name alone, payable to the decedent’s 
estate, or held jointly for convenience only (but where the decedent actually 
acquired the property by himself or herself) is subject to probate.

89
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
To help you make an accurate determination, this section takes you through 
the steps involved in determining whether and what kind of probate adminis-
tration is necessary.
 
Probating the decedent’s estate through the probate court system and taxing 
the decedent’s estate for federal estate tax and state estate or inheritance tax 
purposes are two entirely different animals. Just because you’re not dealing with 
a probate estate doesn’t mean it won’t owe estate or inheritance tax. Tax law 
isn’t based on how the property was held but rather on who actually owned the 
property at death, and in the case of state inheritance tax, who receives it. See 
Chapter 16 to determine whether your decedent’s estate is subject to estate tax.
Do you need a temporary executor?
As soon as you receive word of the decedent’s death, take a look at the estate 
plan documents and start compiling the asset information. If any assets 
subject to probate need immediate action (either to preserve them or their 
value or to manage them), you may need to apply for temporary executorship 
(can be done only if the will permits) or temporary administrator with will 
annexed (can be done at the discretion of the court) because your appoint-
ment as executor may take a few weeks — or sometimes more — to accom-
plish. Your appointment as temporary executor or temporary administrator 
can be accomplished much more quickly than your appointment as executor.
You typically accomplish temporary administration through a written motion to 
the court where you set out the reasons it’s being sought and the powers you’re 
requesting. Some courts may have a form of petition to present. In either case 
you need to present it in person to the court, along with a certified copy of the 
death certificate, the original will if it hasn’t already been filed, and any other 
documents required by the local court (check with an assistant probate regis-
ter). If your request is granted, your powers will be limited to those sought in the 
motion and approved by the court, except as set out by state law (typically to 
collect the personal property of the decedent and preserve it for the executor). 
Some instances in which you may want to apply for temporary administration:
 
✓ To preserve the value of stocks and bonds held by your decedent. 
Because of the nature of the stock market, you may want to sell these 
assets quickly to avoid a decrease in value. (See Chapter 18 for how to 
calculate any capital gain or loss, which should be minimal.)
 
 Your duty as executor is to preserve the estate assets for the beneficia-
ries, not to grow the estate. So, for example, you may want to sell all the 
volatile securities and convert the holdings into more stable assets to 
preserve the value of the estate for ultimate distribution to the benefi-
ciaries. Remember, any income tax consequences for the sale of these 
assets are small because the tax basis has stepped up to the value on 
the decedent’s date of death. And keep in mind that you don’t get credit

or thanks for any gains on assets during estate administration, but you 
can surely be held accountable for any losses! Check your local law on 
this issue with an attorney experienced in local probate.
 
✓ To continue your decedent’s business.
 
✓ To manage real property held by your decedent.
 
✓ To pay expenses of last illness, funeral expenses, and taxes.
 
✓ To gain access to the decedent’s safe deposit box to look for the 
decedent’s will, if your state doesn’t provide an alternative means of 
entering the box.
 
✓ To bury the decedent.
One of us had the experience of going to court to seek temporary administra-
tion in order to sell stocks and bonds to preserve the estate assets, and the 
judge she appeared before couldn’t imagine why she’d want to sell all the 
securities. He agreed to the temporary administration for this purpose only 
after his assistant found the section of the probate law regarding the duty 
of the executor to preserve assets and showed it to the judge. Don’t be too 
hard on the judge here. In many instances, you’re dealing with the probate 
and family court (with the emphasis on family). In that case the courts see 
an overwhelming amount of family law (divorce, guardianship) compared to 
their experience with probate, and many of the judges are former family law 
attorneys. Many more-experienced judges are expert in probate law.
You may need to file an executor’s bond (a written promise to faithfully carry 
out your duties as executor), and even the temporary administrator must 
file an inventory and an account. The temporary appointment ends when the 
executor under the will or administrator (no will) is appointed.
Do you need a special administrator?
A special administrator can be appointed whether or not there’s a will. A 
special administrator (or the equivalent) is a temporary fiduciary appointed 
by the court in many states to marshal and preserve the assets when a delay 
is foreseen in appointing a permanent fiduciary, perhaps due to a will contest 
or problems serving notice on interested parties.
When there’s a will
In the case of a will contest, a person having an interest in the estate can file 
a petition for special administration in the probate court, along with a certi-
fied copy of the death certificate. The petition must certify that the Division of 
Medical Assistance has been sent, by certified mail, copies of the petition and 
the death certificate. The petition should also name exactly what powers are 
being requested. Without specific court authority, the power of a special admin-
istrator is quite limited. If all interested parties assent to the petition, it can be 

91
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
allowed without having to publish a legal notice in a local newspaper. But, even 
without assents, the judge may allow the petition. Although the named executor 
sometimes files the petition, in the case of a will contest there may be objec-
tions, in which case a disinterested third party may be appointed. The period of 
appointment can be quite brief, up to 90 days, except in unusual circumstances, 
in which case the court may make an appointment for an indefinite period.
Check with your local court to see if special administration or its equivalent 
is available in your jurisdiction, and for the specific local requirements.
When there’s no will
If the decedent died intestate, special administration, or its equivalent, is 
the only form of temporary administration available. Temporary administra-
tion may be sought because of a delay in giving notice to all the interested 
parties, or because of a dispute over who is to be appointed as permanent 
administrator. Special administration may be asked for to administer assets, 
or to open a safe deposit box. All relevant information from the preceding 
section applies here also. Again, check with your local court to see what type 
of special administration is available to you.
Determining domicile
Knowing where the decedent’s domicile (where the decedent had his or her 
primary residence) was at date of death is key when figuring out where you 
must probate the assets and what state you must pay taxes to (although real 
estate is subject to state estate or inheritance tax, if any, in the state in which 
it’s located). All real estate in the decedent’s state of domicile and all other 
tangible and intangible assets located anywhere in the United States are sub-
ject to probate in the decedent’s state of domicile if all other requirements 
for probate are met. Only after you’ve made that determination can you begin 
primary probate in the correct court and ancillary administration in any 
other state where the decedent owned property. (Check out the next section 
for more on ancillary administration.)
It may seem odd to even question where the decedent lived at the time of death, 
but often the decedent’s official home may not have been where you thought it 
was and so much of estate administration rests on the decedent’s legal home.
 
In many instances, determining domicile is as easy as can be. Uncle Jim was 
born on the farm, worked on the farm, and you buried him from the farm (and 
maybe on the farm, as one of us can bear witness to) after he died. The farm 
was, without question, his domicile. But in many cases, people own real prop-
erty in more than one place, and even more than one state (or country), and 
they pay taxes in more than one state at any given time. If you’re responsible 
for administering an estate that owns real estate located in multiple places, 
how do you know where to initiate probate?

92
Part II: Administering an Estate 
The list of items used to determine domicile is long, and far from absolute. 
Certain items on the list may indicate one legal home, but others may show a 
different one. You have to make the final determination based on the weight of 
the evidence. Be prepared to back up your results to the state(s) that loses; for 
the states in question, large potential tax revenues may lie in the balance.
Evidence used to determine domicile includes the following:
 
✓ Address of residence where the decedent lived more than 50 percent 
of the time.
 
✓ IRS office where tax returns are filed: For example, if you live in Florida 
you file your tax returns with the Atlanta office; if you live in Vermont, 
you file in Andover, Massachusetts.
 
✓ Place of religious affiliations: Evidence of memberships in churches, 
synagogues, or mosques can be crucial.
 
✓ Car registration: People rarely register their cars in a state where they 
only live part time.
 
✓ Voter registration: You often have to show proof of residence in order 
to register to vote.
 
✓ Address shown on passport: Of course, passport addresses aren’t 
updated when you move, but if the address matches the domicile you 
want to establish, so much the better.
 
✓ Bank accounts established in local banks: Although with the rise of 
interstate banking, this isn’t as stellar a form of evidence as it once was.
Declarations of homestead are required in some states to protect your pri-
mary residence from creditors or to give you a lower tax rate, and if you find 
one attached to a tax return or stashed away in a file somewhere, it can go a 
long way toward supporting your argument that the decedent was domiciled 
in a particular state.
Accessing ancillary administration
If every decedent had only one residence or owned real estate in only one 
state, your life as executor would be much easier. But that’s often not the 
case. When you’re administering an estate with real estate located in a state 
other than the decedent’s state of domicile, you have to have ancillary (that 
is, not the primary) administration in that state, but only with regard to that 
real property. Ancillary administration is an additional probate procedure in a 
state other than that in which the decedent was domiciled.

93
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
 
You usually only need to have ancillary administration if the decedent held 
real estate that’s subject to probate (if held in decedent’s name alone or as 
tenant in common) in another state. In that state the will is referred to as a 
foreign will, and you’re a foreign executor. As such, you may need to appoint 
an agent who is a resident of that state for service of process (procedure used 
to give legal notice). You provide the foreign court with an authenticated (by 
the court) copy of your appointment as executor and of your bond, and follow 
that court’s procedures for distribution or sale, whichever you need to accom-
plish, of the real estate.
All other tangible and intangible assets, whether located in the state where 
the decedent resided most of the year, in another state (or even country) 
where the decedent lived part of the year, or even in a third, non-related 
state, are subject to probate in the decedent’s state of domicile.
So for example, if your decedent lived in Massachusetts but had bank 
accounts in Florida, the Florida bank would recognize your authority as exec-
utor appointed in Massachusetts, and deliver the contents of those accounts 
in accordance with your instructions.
Eyeing whether you need a guardian
In some cases the court appoints a guardian to 
take care of a person’s affairs. We’re focusing 
our discussion on the case where a guardian 
is needed because the decedent has died and 
the heir (usually a minor child or an otherwise 
legally incapacitated person) needs a guardian 
because he or she stands to inherit from the 
estate.
When the parent of a minor dies, if the parent 
had a will, typically he or she names the surviv-
ing spouse (or in the case of divorce, the child’s 
other parent) as guardian, or if there is none, 
some other person or persons (sometimes a 
husband and wife). Occasionally a parent will 
designate one person or couple as guardian(s) 
of the person of his or her minor child, and 
another person as guardian of the property. 
This is likely to happen if the decedent feels one 
person or couple is ideal to raise the children, 
but not the best person(s) to manage the child’s 
assets.
If no guardian is named in the will, or if there 
is no will, the court will choose the guardian, 
taking into account the best interests of the 
child. It is always best for all involved if the 
decedent names a guardian in a will, as the 
probate judge will try to honor the decedent’s 
wishes if at all possible. In many states, judges 
must follow the stated wishes in the will; in 
others, the judge makes the final determina-
tion based on a number of factors, of which the 
stated wishes of the decedent are only one.
If the decedent didn’t name a guardian and there 
is no surviving spouse (think common accident 
or natural disaster, so neither parent survives), 
it is quite common for several relatives to come 
forward requesting to be appointed guardian, all 
claiming that they are the best person to take 
care of the minor child or children. In that case, 
the judge will take input from all sides and make a 
decision based on the child’s best interests, and, 
if possible, taking into account the preference of 
the child.

94
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Deciding on Voluntary (Informal) 
Administration and/or Formal Probate
After you determine the estate includes probate assets, you have to decide 
whether you need to embark on the full administration process or if a special, 
informal form of administration is available to you in your decedent’s state of 
domicile (or any other state where administration is required). That decision 
is fairly straightforward and this section helps you make it.
Going the voluntary route
If your decedent’s probate estate (assets in his or her name alone, payable 
to the estate, or held jointly for convenience only) is of limited size, it may 
qualify for a special, streamlined form of administration whether or not your 
decedent left a will. This streamlined administration can save you time and 
the estate money. For instance, in Massachusetts you may seek voluntary 
(also referred to as informal) executorship if the decedent dies with a will 
and leaves only an automobile and personal property worth $15,000 or less.
 
To take the voluntary journey, you need to do the following tasks:
 
1. You, the named executor (or certain related persons, as administrator, 
if there is no will), file a voluntary statement with the probate court.
 
 Complete a form provided by the court regarding the decedent, his or 
her assets, heirs at law, devisees and legatees (if a will), and surviving 
joint owners of property.
 
2. You must certify that you sent the State Division of Medical Assistance 
copies of the statement and the death certificate by certified mail.
 
3. You must also file the original will (in the case of executorship) and a 
certified copy of the death certificate.
 
 If someone else doesn’t file a petition for formal probate of the will 
and all other requirements are met, the court may attest a copy of the 
statement and/or issue a certificate of appointment to you as executor/
administrator, and you may then act without further court involvement 
to pay the expenses and debts of the decedent and distribute any assets. 
(Note that a voluntary statement, or its equivalent, can’t be filed just to 
open a safe-deposit box; for that you need to go for temporary executor 
or special administrator, as we discuss earlier in this chapter.)
 
 These steps are minimal compared with formal probate proceedings. 
Check with the probate court of the jurisdiction where your decedent 
was domiciled to see if your decedent’s estate qualifies for this stream-
lined form of administration.

95
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
Voluntary administration can be quick and reasonably painless if you’re eligi-
ble to use it, and using it makes sense. One of us probated her grandmother’s 
last will from soup to nuts in one day by using voluntary administration. It 
was a marathon, running from attorney to court to family members for signa-
tures and back to court, but it was only one day. By comparison, had full pro-
bate been required, the entire probate process would have taken more than a 
year to complete.
 
Some states may have situations in which you want to proceed with formal 
probate for your decedent’s estate even if informal administration is avail-
able. For instance, if you want to start the clock running for any creditors of 
the decedent to file claims against the estate, use formal probate proceedings 
(see the next section), which involve publication of a notice to creditors of 
the deadline for filing claims against the estate (such as four months from the 
notice, depending on your state law). This notice protects the estate and you 
as the executor/administrator from any later creditor’s claim. With voluntary 
probate, no such notice is given, and thus the period for filing claims against 
the estate may never close. You may say, “Who cares, this estate doesn’t have 
enough assets to pay creditors anyway,” but some non-probate assets may 
be subject to the claims of creditors in your state, especially any assets held 
in the decedent’s revocable trust at death. Other states leave the burden on 
the creditor to be aware that the decedent has died; these states simply allow 
a period of time, such as one year after the date of death, for creditors to file 
claims with the probate court.
Treading the formal route
If the assets of your decedent’s estate are more than the minimal amount 
provided for under a special administration statute, you need full, formal pro-
bate — the whole shebang.
 
Don’t be intimidated. Your state statutes and probate (or equivalent) court 
rules spell out the steps needed to probate the decedent’s will in your state. 
But be warned that although the probate court registers and other court 
employees can be very helpful, if they feel you’re trying to use court staff to 
help you tackle a task that requires a probate attorney, their patience may 
wear thin. If you’re administering an extensive estate, make sure that you con-
sult an attorney who specializes in estates. Even if you use an attorney, you 
want to understand what’s going on in the probate process, so the following 
section lays out a typical probate process (although the process varies state 
by state).

96
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Petitioning for Probate of the Will
The probate process may be a stressful experience that sometimes makes 
you feel like you’re never going to close the estate. If the estate you’re admin-
istering needs formal probate, you want to follow your state’s statutes to 
guarantee that all your hard work will pass legal muster.
 
To start the probate process, the following outlines a straightforward peti-
tion for probate of a will. These guidelines can vary state by state; we use 
Massachusetts as an example here. Check with your local law and practice for 
what may be specific to your state and probate court.
 
1. File the decedent’s will and any codicils, as well as your appointment 
as executor, in the probate court in the county where your decedent 
was domiciled at the time of his or her death.
 
 Codicils are supplements or additions to the will. If you’re not a resident 
of the same state as the one where you’re initiating probate, you need to 
check with the court to see whether you’re allowed to act. Frequently, 
you’ll be allowed to do so if you appoint a resident agent in the state of 
domicile before you become executor. The purpose of the agent is to 
be an in-state presence to receive service of process on your behalf, if 
necessary (think disgruntled beneficiary suing executor; not that that 
would ever happen to you). By the way, even though we are addressing 
you as executor, keep in mind that federally chartered national banks, 
in-state banks, and in-state trust companies can also act as executors, as 
can foreign (out-of-state) banks or trust companies, under certain 
circumstances.
 
2. Sign a bond and submit it with your petition.
 
 The petition typically requests your appointment with a bond (your 
written pledge to guarantee your performance as executor); whether or 
not you need a surety (a company that the estate pays to guarantee your 
bond) on the bond will depend both on state practice and on whether 
your decedent requested in the will that no sureties be required.
 
3. Certify that you’ve sent copies of the petition and death certificate to 
the Division of Medical Assistance by certified mail.
 
4. Make sure you list the following interested parties on the petition:
 
• Heirs at law (those who inherit by statute in your state if the 
decedent left no will) and next of kin (nearest blood relatives, as 
defined by state law), but not beneficiaries under the will (they 
have no standing until the will is allowed).
 
• The state attorney general if there are no heirs at law or if there 
are any charitable bequests in the will.

97
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
 
• If the decedent’s surviving spouse is incompetent and isn’t repre-
sented by someone other than you as executor, a guardian ad litem 
(a special guardian appointed by the court) on his or her behalf 
needs to be a party to the petition.
 
• If a pretermitted heir — a child or descendants of a deceased child 
not provided for in the will (unless the omission was clearly inten-
tional) is under a disability, such as being a minor, a guardian ad 
litem is required.
 
 If an interested party is in the military, special provisions usually exist to 
ensure that that party is represented.
 
5. Provide a copy of the court notice of the petition for probate to all 
interested parties as well as all devisees and legatees.
 
 All the interested parties listed on the petition for probate, and, typi-
cally, all devisees and legatees under the will (even though they aren’t 
legally considered interested parties) get a copy of a court notice (some-
times called an order of notice or citation). The citation provides that 
any interested person who wants to object to the admission of the will 
to probate do so by a given date. Publication in a newspaper that pub-
lishes legal notices is also required. (Chapter 8 discusses in more depth 
publication in a newspaper.) Your court’s rules determine your method 
of delivery to all interested parties. In some jurisdictions, you must send 
the notice by ordinary mail to all interested parties. Some jurisdictions 
also require that the interested parties receive a form providing informa-
tion regarding their rights.
 
 Determining who receives notice under what circumstances is the stuff 
of which charts are made for probate attorneys, so don’t hesitate to 
turn to the court or your probate attorney to make sure that all receive 
notice who should. Should you give notice and inadvertently miss some-
one who was required to receive it, you may have to begin the entire 
notice procedure again.
 
6. Indicate that you’ve published and mailed the notice as directed by 
the court and filed the citation with the return of service section com-
pleted with the court.
 
 In some states the citation has a “return of service” section that makes 
this process easy. Otherwise, follow your court’s rules for showing that 
you’ve published and mailed the notice as your court requires. Act care-
fully, because if you don’t make return of service exactly in accordance 
with the citation’s (or your court’s) directions, you must apply again to 
the court for a new citation and return day.
 
7. Get the will proved.
 
 If no one has filed an objection to the allowance of the will, it may be 
proved (that is, allowed as the decedent’s last will and testament) in a 
number of ways, including the following:

98
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
• If the decedent’s surviving spouse (if applicable), heirs at law, 
next of kin, and any other interested parties have all agreed to the 
allowance of the will without testimony (a statement to this effect 
must appear on their assents), you may request that the petition 
be allowed without testimony.
 
• If one of the witnesses to the will signs an affidavit before the pro-
bate register or assistant register regarding the facts of the execu-
tion of the will.
 
• If one of the witnesses to the will gives oral testimony before a pro-
bate judge regarding the facts of the execution of the will.
 
• The easiest method of all: If you’re lucky enough to have a (physi-
cally attached) self-proving affidavit that was executed by the 
decedent and the witnesses when they signed the will, just file it 
with the court, and the will is proved! (This method is available in 
Massachusetts and a number of other states.)
 
 In some states, in certain circumstances, a holographic (handwritten) 
will is admissible. Be aware, though, that holographic wills may appear 
out of the blueafter death from an unanticipated source and are some-
times forgeries. One of us administered an estate that had a will con-
test that dragged on for years, with one of the wills in question being a 
holographic will that the decedent had never even signed. The fact that 
everyone involved suspected the will was fraudulent didn’t stop it from 
mucking up the works on what was already a complex situation.
Petitioning for Administration 
When You Don’t Have a Will
If your decedent died intestate (without a valid will), you have several options 
available, depending on your state. Informal administration is available in some 
small estates whether or not the decedent left a will. It’s a separate proceed-
ing from the one for voluntary executorships, which we discuss earlier in this 
chapter. Appendix B gives you an overview of intestacy laws state by state.
If someone dies without a will, you may wonder who can file a petition to 
serve as administrator. It varies some by state, but under Massachusetts law, 
which is fairly representative, the following persons (in this order) may act 
as administrator unless the court decides to appoint someone else:
 
✓ The decedent’s surviving spouse, if any.
 
✓ The decedent’s next of kin (those entitled to inherit under the statutory 
distribution laws for intestate estates) or their executors or administrators.

99
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
 
✓ If none of the above is competent, all renounce administration, or all neglect 
to take administration within 30 days after the decedent’s date of death, 
one or more of the decedent’s principal creditors (after public notice).
 
✓ If no spouse or next of kin, a public administrator may be appointed.
 
✓ In practice, most probate courts allow a petition for appointment of a 
person not listed here if the surviving spouse or at least one of the next 
of kin brings the petition or assents. Trust companies, national banks, 
and even some foreign banks may also act.
Various states have their own additional criteria. For example, in many 
states, anyone with an interest in the estate who isn’t under indictment for, 
and hasn’t been convicted of, killing or helping to kill the decedent may file 
the petition. We sincerely hope this isn’t an issue in your decedent’s estate! 
The commissioner of revenue may also file in certain circumstances. Check 
your local law for similarities and differences.
Be ready in case someone ever contests the will
Just because the decedent’s will names you 
executor doesn’t mean the court will appoint 
you to act. Any of the people you’ve given notice 
to or anyone else who feels the will isn’t valid 
can object to its allowance, although these will 
contests aren’t an everyday occurrence.
The bases on which a will may be deemed 
invalid include the following:
 ✓ If the decedent wasn’t mentally compe-
tent or of sound mind (having testamentary 
capacity, or the ability to know and under-
stand the will’s contents or that he or she 
was even making a will in the first place) 
during the signing of the will.
 ✓ The decedent made the will in accordance 
with another’s wishes rather than his or her 
own free wishes, officially known as acting 
under undue influence from another.
 ✓ The decedent’s signature is shown to be a 
forgery.
 ✓ Evidence of a later will replacing the will in 
question.
 ✓ The will wasn’t executed (signed and wit-
nessed) in accordance with state law.
If you’re the executor of a will that gets contested, 
consult an attorney with experience in will con-
tests. Sometimes the attorney who drafted the 
will is best suited to defend it because he or she 
was most familiar with the decedent’s wishes, 
state of mind, and the circumstances of its exe-
cution. In any event, let the attorney handle the 
will contest, keeping close tabs, of course, on its 
progress, and carry on with the estate adminis-
tration after it has been settled (assuming you’re 
still executor!). If there are pressing issues that 
can’t wait, such as the administration of estate 
assets and the filing of tax returns (a will contest 
can drag on a long time), be sure that the court 
has appointed a suitable person (it may not be 
you, because the will is being contested) as spe-
cial administrator.

100
Part II: Administering an Estate 
The procedure for allowance of a petition for administration carries with it 
all the same, or similar, requirements to the petition for probate of the will 
regarding interested parties (except with no named beneficiaries), notice, 
return of service, and presentation for allowance. Whether or not the bond 
has sureties and whether personal sureties are acceptable in place of corpo-
rate sureties depends on different factors such as the existence of a will and 
on each court’s discretion.
Eyeing Surviving Spouse Decisions
Surviving spouses may have some important decisions to make with regard 
to the will and the decedent’s estate. This section highlights a few important 
decisions the surviving husband or wife needs to make when the decedent 
has died and probate has begun. These decisions are all part of the probate 
process if the surviving spouse decides to act on them, but they bear no rela-
tion to whether the surviving spouse is executor. It is, however, your duty as 
executor to inform the surviving spouse of these rights as soon as possible 
after the death of the decedent.
Electing against the will
The surviving spouse has the right to elect to take against the will. In other 
words, instead of receiving what the decedent left to him or her as a ben-
eficiary under the will, he or she may choose to receive instead what that 
surviving spouse is entitled to under state law; his or her statutory share. 
The statutory share isn’t the same as the intestate share (what the surviving 
spouse would have received had the decedent left no will).
 
Because you, as executor, represent the estate and not the surviving spouse, 
you should not advise the spouse on whether to accept the will’s bequest 
and /or devise or to take the statutory share. However, be sure the surviving 
spouse is aware of this right.
In some jurisdictions, a spouse electing against the will just has to file a docu-
ment waiving his or her share under the will and claiming the statutory share 
within a set period after the allowance of the will. Electing to take against the 
will is an all-or-nothing proposition; the surviving spouse can’t cherry-pick, 
accepting some provisions, but not all. If the decedent and the surviving 
spouse prepared their estate plan documents together and were in agree-
ment on their plans, such an election is unlikely.

101
 Chapter 6: Navigating the Probate Process
 
Electing to take against the will has many consequences, some of which may 
not be readily apparent. For example, if the decedent exercised a power of 
appointment,(which we explain in Chapter 17) in the will over a trust in favor 
of the surviving spouse and the spouse elects against the will, the spouse also 
loses the property subject to the power of appointment. The estate tax conse-
quences of a waiver should also be kept in mind (the marital deduction will be 
affected), as should the fees and expenses involved in dealing with the waiver 
and its results.
Requesting a surviving spouse’s allowance
The surviving spouse may have the right to a surviving spouse’s allowance for 
the period of the administration of the estate. In our experience, the allow-
ance is minimal and usually isn’t considered worth applying for, but if your 
decedent left a surviving spouse, be sure to check your state’s laws to see 
what may be available to him or her. For instance, in Massachusetts, the 
allowance is limited to necessities and apparel plus the right to live in the 
decedent’s residence for six months after death, and the amount awarded 
can be as little as $100 and usually not more than $1,000. If no spouse sur-
vives but minor children do, the kids may receive up to $100 per child. The 
spouse makes the claim by petition to the probate court.
Claiming dower
Statutory dower (governed by legislated law) exists in many states to replace 
common law dower (governed by customary law) and curtesy. Dower is the 
right of a surviving spouse to an estate for life in a portion of the property 
owned by the decedent at death, subject to any encumbrances on the prop-
erty. Translation: The surviving spouse gets the use of, for instance, one-
third of the real estate for life. Depending on what the real estate is, that use 
could be, for instance, to live in one-third, or collect one-third of the rents, 
or receive one-third of the profits from the crops grown on it. Although 
dower originally only applied to widows, it now applies to widowers as well, 
because common law curtesy (the right of the widower to the use of all the 
wife’s real estate for life) has generally been abolished.
To claim dower, the surviving spouse files a claim in the probate court within 
a fixed period after death. If dower is claimed, the surviving spouse must also 
waive the will (if applicable) and take his or her statutory share. Few spouses 
actually find it beneficial to claim dower, because they’ve planned their wills 
together and don’t have a reason to take against the will, and dower is a 
clumsy means of inheritance. Someone may choose this option if his or her 
deceased spouse didn’t include them in his or her estate plan; if so, this is 
the only means by which the surviving spouse can receive an inheritance.

accounts, cars, houses, and the beautiful barometer on the wall all 
standing in an orderly line, just waiting for you to acknowledge and count 
them. As the executor of an estate, your first job is to marshal the assets — to 
determine what exactly the decedent owned on the day that he or she died. 
In this chapter, we discuss step by step the best ways to search for each 
type of asset. Your ease in finding all the assets depends, to some degree, on 
how well you knew the decedent (for the more obvious assets) and on the 
decedent’s state of mind at the time of death. Someone who suffered from 
Alzheimer’s disease or another form of dementia may well have done unusual 
things with his or her assets or asset records (including disposing of them).
As you figure out what the decedent owned, you also come across what the 
decedent owed. Debts of the decedent or claims against the estate come to 
light in several ways. You may find record of them in the decedent’s papers, 
receive bills in the decedent’s mail, or hear from a creditor as a result of 
notifying creditors as your local probate court requires (typically by publish-
ing such a notice in a local paper). You may even get a knock on the door or 
hear from a friend or relative from whom the decedent borrowed money. See 
Chapter 8 for details on paying creditors.

Understanding Why You Need to 
Determine What the Decedent Owned
Most decedents won’t have had the foresight to leave you an inventory, or 
list, of their assets with a helpful notation of where each asset is located. One 
of our aunts (who lived to be 101) made a hobby of it, but in our experience, 
she’s the exception. More common are decedents who not only didn’t plan but 
also couldn’t possibly have told you everything they owned. Still, in order for 
you to carry out their wishes and fulfill the requirements of the probate court, 
your job is to look under the sofa cushions, check under the floorboards, and 
behind not only Door One but also Doors Two and Three in order to find every-
thing owned by the decedent on the date of his or her death.
 
Whether you’re handed a helpful list or need to start excavating on your own, 
your starting point in organizing an estate and planning its administration is 
to locate and list all the decedent’s assets. From this inventory, you’re able to 
determine whether probate of the decedent’s estate is necessary (depending 
on whether or not the decedent owned property in his or her name alone). 
If the total value of the probate assets is small enough, you may be able to 
do a simplified version of the probate process. Otherwise, you’ll have to go 
through full probate. Not to worry though, the probate process itself isn’t 
really so bad. We guide you through the entire process in Chapter 6.
So if you’re wondering about what some of the items in this chapter are 
and why you need to include them in your list of estate assets, don’t worry. 
Although some of these items may be unfamiliar to you, we have you cov-
ered. They all appear on Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation-
Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, which we describe more completely in 
Chapters 16 and 17.
 
As you create your list, be sure to note the name in which each asset is held. 
For instance, an asset may be held in the individual name of the decedent, 
jointly with one or more other people, in trust, or in partnership. You need 
to know this to decide whether the asset must be probated (if in decedent’s 
name alone, held as a tenant in common, or jointly for convenience only). See 
“Preparing and Filing the Probate Inventory” for more info.
Observing the Obvious: Big-Ticket Items
When you list the assets, the big-ticket items are probably one of the easier 
places to begin. Some assets, such as the decedent’s home, are so obvious 
that they present themselves to you on a silver platter, so to speak. This 
section identifies these bigger items and tells you how to handle them.

105
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
The bricks and mortar: Real estate
When you think of an estate, the first picture that pops into your mind may 
be a home. However, regardless of whether the decedent owned a big home, 
a smaller condo, or a vacation home in Bora Bora, you need to locate all the 
real estate.
 
To find all real estate the decedent owned at death, look to where he or she 
was living. Look for deeds, tax bills, mortgage statements, and insurance poli-
cies that refer to the residence and show who exactly owned it — the dece-
dent alone, jointly (with a spouse, a child, or some other person), or in trust 
or nominee partnership. In each case, the deed is key because it shows who 
owned the real estate.
If the deed is in the decedent’s name alone, the property is part of the pro-
bate estate (even though in Massachusetts, at least, the title to the property 
vests in the heirs immediately upon the death of the decedent (subject to the 
claims of creditors, estate taxes, and the like).
Things that move: Cars, boats, and cycles
Cars, boats, motorcycles, and other vehicles may be sitting quietly in the 
decedent’s driveway or at the dock, making them easy to locate. In that case, 
locating the registration and insurance documents helps you determine 
whether the decedent owned them in whole or in part. In some states, title 
to the car passes automatically to any surviving spouse (unless the decedent 
disposed of the car otherwise in his or her will), thus avoiding the need to 
probate the vehicle and giving the surviving spouse quick access to a car he 
or she may need to use.
However, the car still needs to be reregistered in the surviving spouse’s name, 
and the automobile insurance must be changed to reflect the new owner. 
Check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, Registry of Motor 
Vehicles, or the equivalent agency to determine the procedure in your state.
Small (And closely held) businesses
If the decedent was the owner, in full or part, of a small business, your job 
as executor is not only to value the business as of the date of death but also 
to figure out whether to continue the business or sell it now that the owner 
has died. You need to know how the business is set up before you can decide 
what to do with it. Businesses may be set up in the following ways:

106
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
✓ Sole proprietorship: The most common form of small business owner-
ship, the sole proprietorship, is an unincorporated organization that 
is accounted for entirely on Schedule C of the decedent’s Form 1040. 
The company may do business under a name other than the taxpayer’s 
(sometimes referred to as a doing business as [D/B/A]), and it may even 
be organized as a Limited Liability Company (LLC). It may even have its 
own Employer Identification Number (see Chapter 18). If the decedent’s 
business is reported on Schedule C of the 1040, you’re dealing with a 
sole proprietorship or an LLC where the decedent owned the entire 
business, and you need to value it as such.
 
✓ Partnership: If the decedent held a partial interest in a business, the 
business may have been formed as a partnership. Once again, the best 
way to find exactly how the business was organized, and how it’s cur-
rently operating, is to locate the decedent’s tax returns and look for the 
partnership entry on Schedule E. A decedent’s tax return is the road 
map to determine what businesses the deceased had an ownership in. 
After you determine that the deceased had a partnership interest, you 
can then get a copy of the most recent partnership tax return (Form 
1065), which tells you not only what percentage of the partnership the 
decedent owned but also exactly how the decedent held title in that 
property. If the partners had a formal partnership agreement, it may 
include a provision for the surviving partner(s) to buy out the dece-
dent’s partnership interest, including a formula for setting the buyout 
price. Or they may have a separate buy-sell agreement. In the case of 
a sale, your job is to obtain the best price possible. This price sets the 
value for estate tax purposes if it reflects the fair market value of the 
partnership interest. The partnership may dissolve upon a partner’s 
death if the agreement doesn’t contain a provision to the contrary.
 
✓ Subchapter S corporation: These types of businesses are very popular 
because only the shareholders pay income taxes on profits instead of 
paying tax first at the corporate level and then again when the profits 
are paid out as dividends. Your decedent’s most recent income tax 
returns should tell you whether he or she was an S corporation share-
holder; you can make certain by reviewing the corporation’s income tax 
return (Form 1120S).
 
 Because you can transfer S corporation shares only to an individual or 
to a qualifying trust (see Chapter 3 for which trusts qualify), you need 
to tread carefully when dealing with these shares. Selling or otherwise 
transferring shares to a nonqualified shareholder can cause the cor-
poration to lose its S status. Because you can’t change the terms of 
any trusts created by the decedent to make them qualifying trusts, be 
alert for this pitfall. The shares of stock that the decedent owned in the 
Subchapter S corporation require valuation by an expert unless a buy-
sell agreement is in place that fixes the formula or purchase price of the 
decedent’s stock by the remaining stockholders on his or her death. For 
the estate’s purposes, that price or formula is fair market value.

107
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
 
✓ Closely held C corporation: If the decedent owned stock in a non-publicly 
traded company, and it’s not an S corporation, you’re looking at a closely 
held (or privately held) C corporation. With a C corporation, you don’t 
have any income tax concerns about who may inherit the stock. As with 
other privately held businesses, the corporation may have a buy-sell 
agreement that sets the price at which the other stockholders may buy 
the C corporation stock. This agreement sets the stock’s value for estate 
tax purposes, if the IRS considers the price fair market value.
Tracking Down All the Other Assets
You don’t need to be a detective to find all the decedent’s assets, but an 
inquisitive mind and a good imagination often help. Family knowledge or lore 
about what the decedent owned can be handy. For example, in one estate 
we’re familiar with, the family was well aware of the decedent’s collection 
of valuable jewelry. After she died, however, the jewelry was nowhere to be 
found — that is, until an estate administrator, on the second or third search 
of the home, touched a loose board in a wall and found it. Consider this sec-
tion your Sherlock Holmes 101, where we provide you some tips on sleuthing 
and uncovering all the assets.
Reading the mail
Despite everything your mother told you about how rude reading someone 
else’s mail is, this is one time when it’s not only permissible, it’s also admira-
ble. As you read the decedent’s mail, you may find references to many assets, 
including bank accounts (from bank statements), the safe-deposit box (from 
any rental bills), real estate (from real estate tax and insurance bills), stocks 
and bonds (from dividend and interest checks, brokerage statements, mutual 
fund statements, retirement account statements), and correspondence 
regarding other assets.
 
Checking the mail isn’t just a great way to figure out what the decedent 
owned; it also works well for eliminating items that may have been on your 
preliminary list (perhaps the decedent had told you about something years 
ago) but no longer exist. More than one administrator has been surprised to 
find that longtime family heirlooms now belong to someone else. The follow-
ing sections describe two types of mail you especially want to focus on.
Bank statements
Make no mistake about it: Bank statements contain a wealth of information. 
Not only do they give you account numbers and at least an idea of how much 
value the accounts contain, but they also let you know how the decedent 
held title to the accounts. He or she may have owned it outright (in his or her 

108
Part II: Administering an Estate 
name alone), with another person, or even through a trust. Although his or 
her recollections while alive may be a bit sketchy, your task is much easier 
after you have your hands on at least one statement from each account. 
Armed with a copy of your appointment by the probate court as executor 
(see Chapter 6), you have no difficulty in obtaining the most current state-
ments, as well as any prior statements you need.
 
If you manage to uncover the bank statements for the checking account, 
you’ve hit pay dirt! Our experience is that, especially as our clients and family 
age, their once-pristine check registers become, well, less pristine, and deter-
mining what their typical monthly bills look like is often difficult. With the 
checking account bank statements in hand, figuring out who’s been paid, for 
what period, and who’s still waiting (often very patiently!) is easier.
Banks issue statements periodically (usually monthly, but sometimes quar-
terly) and not always on the last day of a month. In your initial search for 
assets, you want to find the one dated most closely to the date of death to 
give you a general idea of the value in the account on the date of death. As 
soon as you know the asset exists, contact the bank directly in order to get 
an exact balance, including any accrued interest, as of the date of death (you 
need the balance with interest for both the probate inventory (see “Preparing 
and Filing the Probate Inventory” in this chapter) and the Form 706. And 
don’t forget the online bank accounts! (Check out the “Breaking into com-
puter files” section for more info.)
If you’re not sure whether you’ve found all the bank accounts, write a letter 
to each local bank (and each bank in any city where the decedent has a vaca-
tion home) inquiring whether it houses any accounts (or safe-deposit boxes) 
in which the decedent had an interest. You should get full cooperation if you 
include a copy of your appointment as executor.
Brokerage statements
As good as finding the bank statements feels, finding the brokerage state-
ments feels even better. In most estates that contain any valuable property 
outside of real estate, brokerage accounts are where you find most of it. 
Identifying where those accounts are, and in whose names they’re registered, 
takes you a long way toward compiling a complete list of what the decedent 
owned. Don’t forget the online brokerage accounts, either!
Brokerage statements typically give you the market value of the individual 
securities on the statement date. Because determining the general size of 
the entire estate relatively quickly is important (you need this information to 
figure out whether you have to do a full probate or not), find the statement 
closest to the date of death to get a general sense of what these assets were 
worth on that date. Chapter 17 tells you how to determine the actual value 
(down to the penny) of these assets as of the date of death.

109
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
Perusing other personal papers
Although you may feel like you’re invading the decedent’s privacy by rummag-
ing through his or her desk and computer, put those feelings aside. You need 
to uncover everything about the estate. As you dig, you may find such trea-
sures as safe-deposit box keys, jewelry appraisals, insurance policies (some-
times with riders cataloguing personal and household items of unusual value, 
in the case of homeowners’ policies), references to real estate, rented storage 
facilities, and even stock certificates and registered bonds that the decedent 
didn’t put away for safekeeping. Keep an open mind; as many estates as the 
two of us have been involved in, we’re still constantly amazed at what people 
stash. What may appear to you as a jumble of worthless paper may contain 
such gems as bearer bonds, savings bonds, and bags of unset diamonds. You 
never know until you dig; dig methodically and carefully. Never throw out any 
piece of paper (or bag of trash) without reviewing it for clues to estate assets.
 
We’d love to be able to tell you that no one ever tried to take advantage of 
Uncle Henry’s death to weasel out of money owed but, unfortunately, we can’t. 
In your search through the paperwork and records, you may find that Uncle 
Henry made loans to family members that he always intended to collect on. 
Any loans, notes, or other debts owed to the decedent are assets of the estate, 
and your duty as executor is to include them on the inventory, along with 
interest accrued through the date of death. You must then pursue the collec-
tion of the note or debt.
If you find documents for such a loan (a promissory note, perhaps, or even a 
mortgage), they remain in force even after Uncle Henry’s death unless there’s 
specific language in the documents or in his Last Will that forgives them 
upon death. If the documents exist and this language doesn’t, these loans are 
assets of the estate, and the estate administrator (that’s you) must enforce 
the terms. Not doing so leaves you open to accusations by Uncle Henry’s 
other relatives or heirs that you’ve failed in your duty as a fiduciary.
Finding the hiding places
People stash what they perceive as valuable in different ways and places; your 
job, as the executor, is to insert yourself into the thought processes of the dece-
dent and attempt to find all these hiding places. For example, one of us keeps 
her personal papers in the bottom drawer of a locked filing cabinet, in a locked 
fireproof safe, and scattered around her desk. Savings (such as they are) are 
littered on the floor in the form of loose change, and jewelry is spread here and 
there among no fewer than seven jewelry boxes and old tool chests. The other of 
us just has the locked filing cabinet. As the executor, you have to find everything 
applicable for the estate, and your search needs to include the following:

110
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
✓ House safes: Many houses have safes drawn into the plans, and some 
have safes built in later; most of the time, though, the house safe is a 
locked, fireproof box that’s stashed in some out-of-the-way place, with 
an eye to keeping certain documents and other valuables free from 
prying eyes and catastrophic acts of nature. Unfortunately, the location 
of the house safe isn’t usually at the forefront of the mind of someone 
about to die, and so after death, the search is on. Check closets, draw-
ers, under beds and dressers, and in the attic and the basement. Be sure 
to check the freezer (especially the freezer chest out in the garage that 
hasn’t worked for years). Don’t assume that because a place looks too 
dark and dingy to ever be considered as a hiding hole that it’s not.
 
 After you locate the safe, you need to have the lock professionally 
attended to if it’s locked and you don’t have a key or the combination. 
The locksmith will need a copy of your appointment as executor to open 
the box. You probably also want an additional witness with you so that 
you have an extra set of eyes to note what’s in the box and, more impor-
tant, what isn’t. Make an inventory of the contents of the box as soon as 
you open it, sign the inventory, and have the second person sign it as a 
witness to the contents.
 
✓ Other unusual spots: Don’t beat yourself up if you fail to find everything 
that the decedent stashed. Do, however, make sure that you’ve at least 
made a reasonable search for anything that may be either intentionally 
or unintentionally hidden. We’ve all heard tales about buried treasure 
located under the floorboards or the mattress. Well, the tales are often 
true, either because the decedent didn’t trust banks to keep money safe 
or through accidental circumstances, such as a piece of jewelry slipping 
off unnoticed and being found in the backyard or the back of a closet 
years later, when you’re really searching for estate treasure. One of us 
worked on an estate where more than $20,000 in cash was found stashed 
behind the kitchen stove, behind a loose brick in the fireplace, and liter-
ally under the floorboards. Although the decedent also had the requisite 
number of bank and brokerage accounts, the money discovered in the 
house represented more than loose change.
 
 One of our grandmothers had a habit of burying silverware she couldn’t 
adequately clean. Although we dug through all of her houseplants 
and the garden before she moved, we never recovered all the missing 
spoons. We did, however, find a gold chain she’d lost many years earlier, 
one which, when we had it appraised, was worth more than $5,000.
Emptying the safe-deposit box
Locating and emptying the decedent’s safe-deposit box (if he or she has one) 
is a key step in finding the valuables in the estate. The quickest way to find 
the box is, of course, to ask the question before death; if you forgot to have 
that conversation before it was too late, not to worry.

111
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
Most people choose to rent a safe-deposit box in the bank where they do 
the majority of their business, so check there first. You may find a record of 
the box, either in a notation somewhere or in a paid bill for the box rental, 
among the decedent’s papers. If you don’t find any record, you can approach 
the bank(s) directly and ask, after you’ve received your appointment as the 
estate’s executor. Provided that the bank can see you have the authority to 
receive this information, it’ll be happy to comply.
After you discover where the box is, you have to open it. If you don’t have 
the key or the combination, you can have the lock drilled for a fee. Again, as 
long as you’re armed with a copy of your appointment by the probate court, 
you’ll find the bank very helpful in accessing the contents.
 
Don’t open the box on your own. Take a witness with you and write down a 
list of everything inside. Even better, have the witness videotape you open-
ing the box and what you find. Remember, when you’re dealing with property 
that’s not yours, especially property that may have significant monetary or 
sentimental value, you can’t be too cautious.
You never know quite what you’ll find in the safe-deposit box. Often, you 
come across jewelry, deeds to real estate, stock certificates, bonds, and 
perhaps even the original Last Will of the decedent. Other times, you find 
items that have no intrinsic value, and you wonder at their sentimental value 
as well. Quite frequently, you find that the box is empty. Until you open it, 
though, you’ll never know.
Breaking into computer files
As computers become commonplace, they’re an increasingly important 
resource for sorting out what someone owned; you need to be able to access 
the information on the decedent’s computer. In most cases, the computer 
will probably give up its files fairly easily, but if the decedent was technically 
adept, you may have some difficulties in breaking through passwords and 
other safeguards. Far be it from us to advocate hiring a hacker, but you may 
find it helpful to use someone who is computer savvy in order to get to the 
information you need.
 
Before you begin digging for files, make a complete backup of the hard drive, 
and of any loose disks, flash drives, CD-ROMs, or DVD-ROMs you find lying 
about that contain data. You want to be cautious about losing data, and 
making backups ensures that you have the information that was most cur-
rent on the date of death. The best, quickest way to back up any computer is 
to purchase an external hard drive, plug it in, and then use the software that 
comes with it to start backing up all the files located on the computer’s hard 
drive. You can also copy the contents of floppy disks, CD or DVD-ROMs, and 
flash or thumb drives to the external hard drive to give you a complete copy 
of the decedent’s computer files. If you’re concerned about the cost of the 

112
Part II: Administering an Estate 
external hard drive, don’t worry — it’s a valid expense of the estate (including 
the cost of a technician if you really don’t want to do the backup yourself), 
and you should pay it from estate funds, not from your own funds.
You may find nothing of value on the computer, or you may find the 
decedent’s entire financial life. As more people computerize their financial 
records and replace paper statements and bills with virtual equivalents, 
the computer may contain the only records of those bank and brokerage 
accounts. On the computer, you can see evidence of sources of income as 
well as debts owed. You can probably even find copies of tax returns. In fact, 
you can often find everything that used to be kept in a well-organized filing 
cabinet on the computer if only you take the time to look.
Checking over prior tax returns
When looking for a snapshot of someone’s financial affairs, digging through 
the person’s tax returns provides you with a mountain of information — you 
not only find sources of income and deduction, but you’re also able to elimi-
nate many items you thought he or she owned but actually didn’t.
If you find paper copies of tax returns, you may be fortunate and find the sup-
porting documents to those returns in the same spot. Those official little slips of 
paper (Forms W-2, 1099, and 1098) can direct you to the decedent’s employer (if 
he or she was still employed at the date of death), as well as to all the interest-
bearing bank accounts and dividend-paying stocks he or she owned. You can 
find evidence of retirement income and mortgages owed. In fact, depending on 
the complexity of the tax return and the amount of underlying info, you can gain 
a fairly clear picture of the decedent’s financial life just from the tax return.
 
If you’re unable to locate prior tax returns, either on paper or buried some-
where on the computer hard drive, all isn’t lost. You can obtain copies of 
prior years’ tax returns, including copies of all W-2s, 1099s, and 1098s directly 
from the IRS by filing Form 4506, Request for Copy of Tax Return and send-
ing it, together with the fee of $39 for each year requested, to the IRS Service 
Center indicated on the form instructions. Remember to send a copy of your 
fiduciary appointment with the Form 4506; the IRS won’t give you information 
if you’re not authorized to receive it. If you don’t need to see an actual copy 
of the entire return but only want to know the information that’s on it, you 
can save the $39 per year fee by filing Form 4506-T, Request for Transcript 
of Tax Return instead.

 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
Listing Personal and Household Effects
The preceding section helps you establish at least a preliminary list of the 
decedent’s financial affairs. Now you need to consider all the stuff you find in 
the decedent’s residence(s). Everything the decedent owned outright on his 
or her date of death is now under your care as executor; you’re responsible 
for making sure that you account for this stuff and that it ends up where it’s 
supposed to. You need to prepare a detailed inventory of all the personal and 
household items (being sure not to include any that belonged solely to the 
surviving spouse). This inventory is necessary to put a value on the items for 
the probate inventory and the Form 706 (see Chapters 16 and 17).
 
If the decedent has a surviving spouse, the personal and household items may 
be staying in place after the decedent’s death, except items the decedent spe-
cifically bequeaths (leaves by will) to others. If the decedent has no surviving 
spouse and the house needs to be dismantled, you still need to list and docu-
ment everything and set aside anything of real value for later valuation.
 
Don’t allow relatives and friends to rummage through the house and remove 
items until you’ve listed them, and if valuable, valued them. Seriously consider 
collecting all outstanding house keys immediately after the death or, even 
better, changing the locks as soon as is humanly possible. And if you don’t 
get to the house until after Cousin Hester has emptied it with a moving van 
because she knew the decedent wanted her to have “a few special things,” 
you’ll need to try your best to either retrieve the items removed, or value 
what you remember and then charge that against Cousin Hester’s eventual 
share of the estate (if she has one).
Most often, going through the personal and household property is an exercise 
in clean up and clear out. For most people, these tangible items, though they 
have great sentimental value, rarely have a correspondingly large cash value. 
Clothes, for example, are usually given to a local charity, and household fur-
nishings that family and friends don’t latch onto either follow the same route 
or are disposed of in a yard sale or on Ebay or Craigslist. Surprisingly, some-
times items you thought you’d have difficulty giving away are extremely popu-
lar; one of us had a bidding war for her grandmother’s hats from the 1940s and 
1950s, but this situation is more the exception than the rule.
 
Of course, not all the personal and household effects are intrinsically value-
less, and your job is to separate out the wheat from the chaff. Just because 
something may not be your style doesn’t mean that it has no value; in fact, 
we’ve found that some of the most hideous pieces of furniture are among the 
most valuable! Regardless of your personal opinion, you need to carefully 
check the furniture, the knickknacks, the dishes, what’s hiding in the attic and 

114
Part II: Administering an Estate 
the cellar, and the garage. If you’re familiar with the contents of the house 
before inventorying what’s there, you may want to obtain a recent valuation 
guide to gain some idea of what you’re looking at and a rough idea of its value. 
If you know before you go into the house that it contains items of great value, 
you may also want to consider bringing an antique dealer or auctioneer with 
you to help sort out what has value from what doesn’t.
 
Make sure that you have witnesses with you when you inventory and dispose of 
the contents of the house. If you can, take huge numbers of pictures or videos 
of each room before you move anything, so that, should someone take it upon 
themselves to question what was there when you opened the door, you have 
visual proof as well as third-party confirmation.
Appraising the Property
After you discover where all the assets are hiding, you need to determine 
what they’re worth. Some are obvious (the unused postage stamps, for exam-
ple, or bank accounts that only hold cash), although others are more difficult 
to pin down; you may have to call in experts to help you out.
Some property doesn’t vary in price much from day to day or week to week, 
but the value of most property fluctuates. When appraising an estate, make 
sure to value the property as of the date of death, even if you’re having it 
appraised months afterwards. Be sure to let your property appraiser know 
this stipulation in advance — her appraisal needs to explicitly state that the 
value is as of the date of death. This section explains what you may need to 
have appraised and how to do so.
Tangibles
Tangible property refers to both real estate (which we discuss separately) 
and other stuff — furnishings, jewelry, fur coats, cars, boats, collectibles, and 
artwork. If you can hold or touch it, and it’s not securities or cash, you’re 
holding tangible property.
You can take several avenues in valuing tangible property, provided that, 
whichever one you use, it’s a reasonable approach. Some of the ways include
 
✓ Do it yourself. The Web has many resources to help you appraise a wide 
assortment of items. For example, if you want to reasonably appraise a 
collection of books, you can search for matching volumes in online auc-
tion sites and booksellers.

✓ Turn to experts. If you need experts to assist you in valuing the tangibles, 
make sure that you hire someone who is truly an expert in the type of 
property you need appraised. For example, if you tried to value some-
thing online and you can’t find an identical copy, say of the book (and 
identical matters — there’s a huge difference between first and second 
editions), you may choose to take that collection to a rare book dealer, 
who’ll be happy to appraise your collection in writing for a price.
 
 If you need some antique furniture valued, make sure that you ask an 
antique dealer who specializes in the same type of furniture you have. 
(Asking a dealer who specializes in Louis IV furniture to appraise your 
aunt’s collection of 19th century Japanese prints isn’t the best choice.) 
Finding the experts you need can be as simple as word of mouth; if 
you’re using an attorney for help with probating the estate, he or she 
may have a list of appraisers of various types of property that he or she 
has used in the past. You can also check in the local phone book under 
dealers or appraisers for the item in question and search the Internet 
for local appraisers. Asking that appraiser who specializes in Louis IV 
furniture for a recommendation of someone who specializes in Japanese 
prints can’t hurt, either. Contacting a museum that contains items or 
works of art similar to yours can also lead to a recommendation of an 
appraiser. See Chapter 4 for more discussion of appraisers.
 
In the world of appraising, documentation is king. Be sure to obtain written 
appraisals from any experts you use, even if you must pay a fee. Likewise, if 
you’re relying on other sources, such as online auctions, keep copies of your 
research in a file. That way, should someone question your valuation, you 
have proof of what the property was worth on the date of death.
Intangibles
Although valuing tangible property may give you scope for some creative 
research, calculating the value of an estate’s intangible property, those bank 
and brokerage accounts, and any stocks or bonds that the decedent physi-
cally held, should speak to your brain’s quest for absolute order. Provided 
that you have a complete list of the intangible property, figuring out what it 
was worth on the date of death should be a simple matter of math. So grab 
your calculator and get ready.

116
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Bank accounts
Figuring out how much was in each bank account on the date of death isn’t 
too difficult. Just send a letter to the bank explaining what you want, together 
with a copy of the death certificate and your appointment as executor. Be 
sure to request the balance at the date of death plus any interest that has 
accrued between the last payment date and the date of death.
Remember, the decedent may have written checks prior to death that hadn’t 
cleared the bank by the date of death. In this case, adjust for these withdraw-
als by subtracting them from the balance given to you by the bank. Of course, 
in the interest of showing all your work (make your former math teacher 
proud), list the bank’s balance and then the offsetting checks.
Securities
Valuing securities, such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds, isn’t quite as 
easy. When determining their value, you’re required to take an average of the 
high and low costs for the date of death and then multiply it by the size of the 
holding. For example, if your decedent held 50 shares of XYZ Corporation, 
and on the date of death, it traded at a high value of $50 and a low value of 
$40, the average cost per share would be $45. When multiplied by the 50 
shares owned, the total value of that holding on the date of death would be 
$2,250. If the decedent died on a weekend or holiday, you have to average the 
average cost on the last trading day before death and the first trading day 
after death in order to arrive at the date-of-death value.
If the decedent held securities in a brokerage account, you may be able to 
obtain a valuation from the broker as of the date of death, especially if you 
ask for it as soon after the death as possible. Be certain the broker under-
stands that this is a date-of death-valuation, though, because otherwise he 
or she will give you the closing price for that day, not an average of the high 
and low costs. Another source for the date-of-death high and low of a stock 
or bond is the Wall Street Journal issue from your decedent’s date of death, 
which is available at your local library if you don’t have a subscription. If you 
have access to the Internet, we also like Prudential-American Securities Inc. 
(www.securities-pricing.com), which can give you date-of-death values 
or alternate valuation for all stocks and bonds, including municipal bonds, 
for $4 per issue, with a minimum charge of $10. Remember, this fee doesn’t 
come out of your pocket; it’s paid for with estate funds.
Real estate
Assigning value to real estate may be the trickiest value to obtain because no 
two pieces of real estate are identical, and real estate is valued by looking at 
comparable sales. To value real estate, keep the following in mind:

117
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
 
✓ Sometimes, you can use the assessment as the value at the date of death. 
The assessed value is the value your local real estate tax assessor places 
on the property for real estate tax purposes. Compare the assessed value 
with similar properties sold around the date of death or for sale at that 
time in your locale to see whether the assessed value is in the ballpark. 
If the values are comparable and the estate is small enough that it won’t 
have an estate tax, using the assessed value works, because it clearly 
reflects the market value of the property at the date of death.
 
✓ If the assessed value in your area doesn’t reflect the market value of the 
real estate (if you’re unsure based on your market comparison, ask the 
local real estate tax assessor), have the real estate appraised, or use the 
following valuation methods to obtain a value for the probate inventory.
 
If a federal estate tax return (Form 706) is required, have the real estate 
appraised. As with all estate appraisals, hire a reputable appraiser who has 
experience in preparing estate appraisals. The appraiser typically refers to 
several comparable properties (that is, properties that have sold recently 
and are as similar to your property and as close in location as possible), in 
addition to other factors, in determining a value as of the date of death. The 
appraiser adds or subtracts value based upon the differences between your 
real estate and the comparable sales (for instance, an additional bathroom in 
your property increases the value; if your lot is smaller than the comparables, 
your value decreases) in arriving at a date-of-death value for your property.
 
Oftentimes, you have a buyer for the real estate before you have a chance to 
obtain an appraisal. Provided you sell it in an arm’s length transaction (a trans-
action between the executor and someone who has no relationship to the 
executor or the estate) soon after death, you use the sale value as the date-of-
death market value.
Contacting the Employer 
about Employee Benefits
Although the decedent’s employer hopefully already knows about the death, 
in order to collect employee benefits, you need to formally contact the 
employer. A letter to the employer (and to former employers) inquiring about 
any death benefits should meet with full cooperation if you include your 
appointment as executor. Most likely, you’ll find beneficiary designations on 
file with the employer that the decedent signed during his or her lifetime. For 
benefits where the decedent has named no beneficiary, the fallback provision 
under the employer’s plan or the insurance policy typically designates the 
surviving spouse or the executor of the estate as beneficiary. The employer 
will need at least one certified copy of the death certificate. Note that not all 

118
Part II: Administering an Estate 
employee benefits have a death benefit (for instance, the decedent may have 
been collecting pension benefits that ended upon death). The following out-
line some of the benefits that may apply:
 
✓ Death benefits: The decedent may have had term life insurance, acci-
dental death insurance, or other death benefits through the employer. 
Typically, the employer takes care of the paperwork to process those 
claims, but you often have to provide them with gentle reminders.
 
✓ COBRA benefits for surviving spouse and dependent children: The 
decedent may have had certain benefits through an employer, such 
as health, dental, and/or vision insurance that the surviving spouse or 
dependent children may be eligible to temporarily continue. Check with 
the employer to see what, if any, benefits qualify for continuation under 
COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986).
 
✓ Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs) and Health Savings Accounts 
(HSAs): Some employers provide their employees with a way to pay for 
out-of-pocket healthcare and/or dependent-care expenses using pretax 
dollars. Deductions from the employee’s salary fund these accounts, 
(sometimes known as Flexible Spending Accounts [FSAs]), so if the 
account has a balance at the date of death, that balance can be used to 
pay for either healthcare or dependent-care expenses incurred prior to 
death. Check with the employer. And don’t forget HSAs, savings/invest-
ment accounts for pretax dollars the decedent put aside to cover health-
care costs. These accounts, which let you save and invest the unspent 
money in them from year to year (unlike FSAs, which are use-it-or-lose-
it), can transfer to a surviving spouse on death, who can make withdraw-
als at any time, free of income tax, for healthcare costs.
 
✓ Retirement accounts: Check for any employer-sponsored retire-
ment accounts. The 401(k) is probably the most common, but you 
may also find a Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) 
(look for this plan if the decedent worked for a small company or was 
self-employed), a Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP), a Defined 
Contribution Profit Sharing Plan (not too common nowadays), and a 
Defined Contribution Pension Plan (also quite uncommon nowadays).
 
 Figuring out all the places the decedent worked during his or her lifetime 
isn’t easy, but finding and notifying former employers is often worth the 
effort. Frequently, retirement plans and other benefits are still in place 
with former employers, who won’t find out about the death unless some-
one (usually you) tells them. Although employers often automatically pay 
out retirement plans valued at less than $5,000 when employees leave, 
they’re under no obligation to do the same with larger sums, so finding 
plans in place with old employers that hold tens or even hundreds of 
thousands of dollars isn’t uncommon. To locate former employers, look at 
W-2s on prior tax returns to which you have access, ask family members 
of the decedent about any prior employers, and even ask the most recent 
employer, who may have information about prior employers on file on 
the decedent’s resume. You may also find references to prior employers 

119
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
in the decedent’s papers. If you’re fortunate enough to find a copy of a 
resume, you’ve just hit the mother lode!
 
✓ Unpaid salary, bonuses, vacation time, and/or comp time: Don’t forget 
to ask the employer about unpaid salary, bonuses, vacation time, comp 
time, and sick time. Some of these may be owed and payable upon 
death, depending upon the employer’s practice. And don’t forget reim-
bursable expenses! Ask if the employee or estate is entitled to anything 
else. Remember, just because the decedent wasn’t around to collect his 
or her last paycheck doesn’t mean that he or she isn’t entitled to that 
income; make sure you collect it!
Locating and Collecting 
Insurance Proceeds
Many people carry life insurance — your job is to find all the policies and col-
lect the proceeds. Your search of the decedent’s papers may have turned up 
some clues to any insurance on the decedent’s life. You may have found the 
policy itself, records of premiums paid or due, dividend information, or other 
papers pointing toward a policy.
 
To collect the policy’s proceeds, send a certified copy of the death certificate 
and a copy of your appointment as executor or administrator to the insurance 
company. If the company wants the policy itself, which it probably will, be 
sure that you send it certified mail, return receipt requested, or some other 
form of delivery service where you’ll receive proof that someone at the insur-
ance company received it.
Insurance may come in a couple different forms. Keep an eye open for the 
following:
 
✓ Traditional life insurance: Traditional life insurance owned by the 
insured can be whole life, term, or some other product. Regardless of 
type, if the policy was in force on the date of death (the policy hadn’t 
lapsed through nonpayment of premiums, for example), life insurance 
pays out an amount specified in the insurance contract to the benefi-
ciary designated by the insured, minus the value of any outstanding 
loans taken against the cash value in the policy. Note that insurance 
on the decedent’s life that is owned by another person or entity isn’t 
included in the decedent’s probate estate or taxable estate.
 
 When searching for life insurance policies, you often need to look in less-
than-obvious places. Many people have small policies as a courtesy from 
their banks or credit unions. Because you’re writing to request date-of-
death balances for all  the decedent’s bank accounts, inquire at the same 
time whether the decedent also had a life insurance policy in force.

120
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
✓ Mortgage, credit card, and other loan insurance: Insurance is available 
to cover the balance due on a mortgage, credit card, or other loans upon 
the death of the person. You want to keep your eyes peeled for any ref-
erence to such insurance in the decedent’s papers, and ask the holders 
of any mortgages, credit cards, or other loans if any exist.
Ascertaining Any Other Death Benefits
When mining the decedent’s personal papers, note any other death benefits 
you find and contact the appropriate authorities. Be sure to check with any 
professional, retirement, and union organizations. Start with the following 
places to determine whether any other death benefits exist:
 
✓ Social Security: If the decedent has a surviving spouse or minor children 
who meet certain requirements, the survivors may receive a one-time 
death benefit of $255 if the decedent worked long enough. To inquire 
about and collect the benefit, contact your local Social Security office or 
call their toll free number at 800-772-1213. Dealing with the local office, 
which is usually quite helpful, is sometimes easier than going through 
the maze of the telephone system.
 
 The surviving spouse and any dependents and/or dependent parents 
may be entitled to monthly survivors’ benefits. Apply for these benefits 
as soon as possible because, in some circumstances, the benefits begin 
from date of application, not of death.
 
✓ Veterans’ Administration: Eligible veterans, their spouses, and their 
children are entitled to burial in a national cemetery, a flag, and an 
inscribed grave marker. Other benefits may also be available. If the 
decedent was a veteran or the spouse or child of a veteran, you can call 
the Department of Veterans’ Affairs at 800-827-1000 or go to www.cem.
va.gov for help in determining whether any benefits apply (See Chapter 
5 for more details on burial benefits).
 
✓ Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Even though you probably 
won’t be cashing out any retirement accounts the decedent owned, you 
need to know what retirement accounts they had, their value on the 
date of death, and who the beneficiaries are. The decedent may have 
had IRAs, Roth IRAs, or other self-funded retirement arrangements. After 
you identify the accounts, a letter from you to the account’s trustee 
(the bank, brokerage, or mutual fund company that holds the assets), 
together with a copy of the death certificate and your appointment as 
administrator, executor, or personal representative, should be all you 
need to obtain that date-of-death value.

121
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
 
 Choosing how to pay out retirement plans such as IRAs can be a mine-
field, littered with serious tax consequences to the beneficiary. With 
traditional IRAs, give a great deal of thought to how the benefits will be 
paid out, because they may be fully taxable to the beneficiary for income 
tax purposes. If the beneficiary is a qualifying individual, payments can 
be spread out over the life of the beneficiary, thus tempering the income 
tax hit. So be sure you don’t inadvertently elect a lump-sum distribu-
tion! And if the beneficiary is the surviving spouse, he or she can treat 
the inherited IRA as their own. Check out the latest version of Taxes For 
Dummies, by Eric Tyson, Margaret Atkins Munro, and David Silverman 
(Wiley), which gives you all the info on what to do, and what not to do, 
with these IRAs.
 
 Contributions to Roth IRAs were taxed for income tax purposes at the 
time the decedent made the contributions, so provided that the account 
was open for at least five years, all withdrawals from it are income tax 
free. Be sure that you know which kind of IRA you’re dealing with, tra-
ditional or Roth. This would be a good time to consult with a tax expert 
with regard to withdrawals because a number of complex issues are at 
play here.
Suing from beyond the grave
If the decedent was involved in an ongoing law-
suit at the time of his or her death, or if a reason 
to sue arises due to the manner of death, it’s 
the duty of the executor or administrator to 
continue or pursue the lawsuit. One of us had 
a case where a surviving spouse didn’t want a 
lawsuit pursued against the driver who caused 
the death of his spouse. However, the execu-
tor was required to pursue the suit to protect 
the interests of the minor children in the lawsuit 
and in the estate. And unlike criminal actions, 
which expire when the defendant dies, civil 
suits can survive the death of the original par-
ties. One of our grandmothers, who was hit by 
a car and sued the driver five years before she 
died, didn’t finally collect her judgment until 
she’d been dead for three years.
Rights of action and claims in tort or in contract 
(lawsuits) are included on the inventory, and 
you must determine the status of the suit and 
pursue it if it survives the decedent’s death. The 
estate’s attorney can help the executor to deter-
mine whether the cause of action survives.

122
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Preparing and Filing the 
Probate Inventory
After you find every asset of the decedent (you hope!) and value it, prepare 
the inventory required by the probate court. Your local probate court has a 
form for you to use, and if all your probate assets don’t fit on it, just add addi-
tional sheets in the same format. Include all the assets subject to probate on 
the probate inventory including those assets in the decedent’s name alone, 
held as a tenant in common, joint for convenience only, or payable to the 
estate. Your court probably has a deadline by which the inventory is to be 
filed, but check to see whether, in practice, it’s a hard and fast deadline. You 
may need the extra time to collect and value the estate assets.
In some jurisdictions it’s actually likely to be close to the due date for filing 
the estate tax return (nine months after date of death), rather than an earlier 
inventory due date. In some states, the inventory must be filed before you’re 
allowed to sell real estate. Be sure to use the sales price on your inventory; if 
you’re selling for less than inventory value, you may have a problem receiv-
ing any necessary license from the probate court. The inventory limits your 
liability as executor to the values shown on the inventory, if you have used 
market values as of the decedent’s date of death. There is usually an inven-
tory filing fee, payable by the estate.
Liquidating Assets
As the executor or personal representative of an estate, one of your primary 
responsibilities after you take a complete inventory of the assets is to liq-
uidate, or distribute or sell, some or all of them. If the decedent specifically 
bequeaths or devises (leaves a piece of real estate by will) an asset, the exec-
utor or administrator can’t sell it unless it’s necessary to pay debts of the 
decedent and/or expenses of the estate (see Chapter 8). Among the reasons 
for liquidating assets before distribution of the residue (what’s left over after 
paying all debts, expenses, taxes, and specific bequests and devises) are the 
following:
 
✓ The necessity to raise cash for pecuniary (or monetary) bequests, and 
for debts of the decedent, expenses of estate administration, and taxes
 
✓ Ease of division and distribution of the residue
 
✓ Fairness (you may not be able to distribute the assets unless they’re 
held in an equitable manner)

123
 Chapter 7: Marshalling and Liquidating Assets
You as executor or personal representative decide what and when to 
liquidate.
 
Don’t forget that your duty as the executor or administrator is to preserve the 
assets, not to grow them. If the estate holds stocks and bonds that go down 
in value, the executor may be accused of not fulfilling his or her fiduciary 
duty to preserve the assets. And the executor doesn’t receive a bonus if the 
assets increase in value. It can be wise to have a special, or temporary, execu-
tor or administrator appointed before the executor is even appointed, for the 
express purpose of selling stocks and bonds. After assets are liquidated, they 
can be held in safe investment vehicles such as a bank account or accounts 
(so that each account is fully FDIC insured), money market funds, and other 
stable investment vehicles. The following sections discuss what you need to 
do to liquidate the securities and real estate.
Selling stocks, bonds, and other securities
Most people now hold stocks, bonds, and other securities in brokerage 
accounts, and gaining access to them so that you can sell them requires that 
you provide the brokerage with a copy of your appointment as executor, per-
sonal representative, or administrator. Check out the two scenarios:
 
✓ If the decedent held all securities in a brokerage firm account which 
you transferred to the estate’s name or if you placed them in a broker-
age account in the name of the estate: Call the broker to sell them.
 
✓ If your decedent still liked to hold onto his or her physical stock and 
bond certificates: Your job just became a bit tougher. In order to sell 
securities held in physical form — if they’re in the decedent’s name 
alone — you need the original stock certificates, a certified copy of your 
appointment as executor or administrator, and a stock assignment form, 
with your signature guaranteed by a commercial bank.
 
 If you can’t locate the original certificates, get ready for a shock to the 
wallet, because the cost can be up to $500 per certificate to replace each 
one lost. You must replace the certificates before you can transfer the 
stocks. We know of two estates which are still open because the dece-
dents, husband and wife, each had advanced Alzheimer’s disease. Their 
stock certificates are yet to be found, and at $500 per certificate, their 
executor isn’t rushing to replace them.

124
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Disposing of real estate
If you need (or want) to sell the real estate, the quickest way to assure a sale 
at the highest price is typically to have the property listed with a reputable 
broker. If you’re not familiar with the area, ask the decedent’s relatives or 
friends, attorney, accountant, or other professionals for recommendations of 
real estate brokers and then interview the brokers yourself at the property. 
You want to get a feel for the broker personally, and for his or her brokerage 
company. Don’t necessarily use brokers who offer to list the property for 
the highest price. They may be doing so just to get the listing, at which point 
they’ll find it necessary to drop the price to make a sale. Instead, go with the 
broker who has the comparable properties to back up the price he or she 
proposes and whom you’re most comfortable with. 
 
As with any real estate transaction, the executor or administrator must be 
able to give clear title when selling real estate out of the estate. Clear title 
means there’s no question as to the ownership of the real estate and it has no 
liens upon it.
If the decedent had a will, it may or may not require the executor to obtain 
the approval of the probate court prior to any sale; if the power to sell isn’t 
specifically stated in the will, you need to get approval of the probate court 
for the sale if the real estate is held solely in the name of the decedent. Of 
course, if the decedent had no will, or the powers granted under the will 
aren’t broad enough, the probate court will have to grant a license to sell real 
estate (or something similar) before the property can be sold and title pass 
to a new owner. The purchaser or the title insurance company (the company 
the purchaser pays to guarantee that the title to the property is clear) may 
also require probate court approval, such as a license to sell, for the sale to 
proceed. By granting the license to sell or other evidence of court approval 
(depending on the state the real estate is located in) the probate court is 
assuring title clear of claims of heirs, and of debts and claims of the estate.
 
You have a duty to get the highest price for the property; in some states, a 
license to sell from the court protects the fiduciary by conferring the pre-
sumption that the highest sale price was obtained. This step avoids the cum-
bersome task of putting the real estate at auction or worrying about getting 
a higher offer after you have agreed on a selling price with a buyer. Thus, as 
executor, you may want to get a license to sell or its equivalent even if you’re 
not absolutely required to.

Paying the Debts, Expenses, 
Bequests, and Devises from 
the Estate
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying the decedent’s debts and administration expenses
▶ Prioritizing and paying debts from estate assets
▶ Letting beneficiaries know about their right to disclaim
▶ Segregating and distributing named personal property
▶ Dividing other personal property equitably and dealing with the rest of the assets
A
fter you set up the estate and have some idea what all the assets are worth 
(refer to Chapter 7 if you’re not sure), you need to start identifying and 
paying the decedent’s debts, the estate’s administration expenses, and any 
claims against the estate. Only after you’re sure that you’ve discovered and paid 
them all, you can begin distributing the estate’s remaining assets to its heirs.
This chapter points out how to determine and pay the debts of the estate and 
administration expenses, to help a beneficiary to make an effective disclaimer 
of a bequest or devise, to effectively divide personal and household articles 
among the decedent’s heirs (often the trickiest area to negotiate among those 
heirs), and to divide and distribute the rest of the decedent’s assets.

126
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Determining and Paying Debts of the 
Decedent and Administration Expenses
As executor, you should have all the decedent’s bills (or be in the process of col-
lecting them; see Chapter 5 for tips on going about this). One of your first tasks 
is to pay all administration expenses and legitimate debts of the decedent before 
you make any distributions to beneficiaries. That is, if you have enough assets to 
do so. In this section, we explain how and when to make these payments.
How and when to pay claims
One of your first duties as executor (after the payment of administration 
expenses; see the next section) is to pay the debts incurred by the decedent 
during life. Some types of claims that frequently arise include
 
✓ A lease on the decedent’s residence: Be sure to review the lease, 
because some may have a provision for termination upon death. In 
many cases, you can reach an agreement with the landlord for early ter-
mination of the lease. In any event, payments under the lease are claims 
against the estate, but extensions of the lease by the executor while the 
estate is administered are administration expenses, as are all utility bills 
for periods of time after the decedent’s death.
 
✓ Child support and alimony: Agreements or court orders to pay alimony 
and child support are claims against the estate, and you must hold back 
sufficient funds for future payments.
 
Here are a few points to keep in mind when you’re paying off the decedent’s 
debts:
 
✓ A debt is only considered a claim against the estate if the debt was 
created before the decedent died. If it wasn’t created before death, it 
may still be enforceable against the estate as an administration expense; 
administration expenses are dealt with differently than debts of the 
decedent. Check out the “Prioritizing payment” section later in this 
chapter to see how they’re different.
 
✓ Before you pay any debts, verify the validity of each claim. Doing so 
is a simple matter for most debts, such as utility bills, but you may have 
to investigate others more thoroughly. For instance, if a relative, friend, 
or nurse provided care to the decedent with an oral understanding that 
they would be paid from the proceeds of the estate or left all or a portion 
of the estate, go directly to an attorney who is expert in probate law. 

127
 Chapter 8: Paying the Debts, Expenses, Bequests, and Devises from the Estate
Your state’s legal precedents can likely help determine whether the 
claim is valid and can be paid. If actual services were rendered (such as 
living with and caring for an elderly relative for an extended period of 
time), the claimant is probably entitled to something from the estate.
 
✓ Check to see whether any life insurance related to the debt (such as 
life insurance relating to a mortgage) is intended to pay it off upon 
death. Also make sure that no agreements are in place that make the 
indebtedness vanish upon the death of the decedent. An uncle of one 
of us, for example, bought a new car, complete with a new car payment, 
shortly before he died. Fortunately, he took the additional insurance 
offered, which paid off the car loan upon his death.
 
✓ Consider whether the debt is legally enforceable. Debts such as chari-
table pledges may only be considered moral obligations.
 
✓ Frequently, your decedent’s largest obligations don’t need to be paid 
in full. Many are secured obligations that stay with the property they’re 
attached to. Mortgages and auto loans, for instance, stay with the property, 
and whoever inherits the property inherits it with the debt attached.
 
Keep in mind your state’s statutory period within which a creditor must file 
claims (see Chapter 6 for more). Also, be aware, however, that each state has 
exceptions to this statute of limitations, including the following:
 
✓ Federal claims, including the federal estate tax
 
✓ State estate or inheritance tax
 
✓ Creditors’ liens on property
 
✓ Certain governmental and private claims for environmental damage
State statute may also provide that, after a specified time (unless you have 
notice of claims of a large enough amount for you to be concerned that the 
estate may not have sufficient funds to cover its debts), you may pay those 
claims that have been presented to you, and you won’t be held liable if funds 
are needed for later claims. Check with the probate court to see what the 
requirements are in the decedent’s state of domicile.
Prioritizing payment
When the estate doesn’t have enough money to pay all the claims against it, 
don’t start paying bills on the basis of the order received or who’s screaming 
loudest for the money. Every state sets its own order of priority; check with a 
competent attorney or with the probate court to determine in what order you 
must pay the claims.

128
Part II: Administering an Estate 
The following is a list of the types of claims that typically take priority:
 
✓ Reasonable administration expenses, including attorney and other pro-
fessional fees
 
✓ Funeral expenses and the expenses of last illness
 
✓ Federal and state taxes
 
✓ Medicaid claims
Generally, you can only pay all other claims after you’ve paid all these claims 
in full.
Declaring the estate insolvent
 
When you have more claims against the estate than assets to pay them, you 
must declare the estate insolvent. Before taking this step, consult with a pro-
bate attorney who has experience with insolvent estates in your jurisdiction. 
You’re going to need his or her guidance to know the procedure for declaring 
insolvency in your state and figure out what you’re allowed to pay.
Identifying conditional legacies and devises
The testator and the state can place condi-
tions (clauses or laws modifying bequests and 
devises) on bequests (gifts of personal property 
under a will) or devises (gifts of real property 
under a will). Be on the lookout for the follow-
ing, and remember, not all conditions created 
by a testator are recognized as valid, depending 
upon your state law:
 ✓ The testator: A decedent will sometimes 
leave a bequest (or devise with a condition 
attached). Depending on your state law, 
some conditions are recognized as valid, 
and some aren’t. For instance, in many 
states, the condition that the legatee not 
oppose the will if he or she wants to receive 
the bequest (known as an in terrorem 
clause) is valid. Conditions that are against 
public policy are usually found to be invalid. 
For instance, a bequest to the testator’s 
son, on the condition that he divorce his 
wife, would be found to be invalid because 
it’s against public policy, and the son could 
inherit without divorcing. Check with a 
competent attorney in the field of probate 
law if your testator placed conditions on 
any bequests or devises in the will.
 ✓ State law: Divorce doesn’t revoke a will but, 
in most states, a provision in the will for a 
spouse from whom the decedent is divorced 
at the time of his or her death lapses (fails 
to vest in the divorced spouse) unless the 
decedent has specifically provided in the 
will that it shall not lapse upon divorce.

129
 Chapter 8: Paying the Debts, Expenses, Bequests, and Devises from the Estate
If the decedent had a funded revocable living trust, you can usually (depending 
on what state he or she lived in) use it to satisfy creditor’s claims. Hopefully, 
a decedent who funded a living trust made provisions in it for the payment of 
debts and expenses of administration by the trustees; that way, an insolvent 
estate doesn’t have to go through the courts to access the trust fund.
Informing Potential Beneficiaries 
of Right to Consider Disclaimer
Under both transfer tax law, including estate, gift, and generation-skipping 
(see Chapter 17), and state probate law, a beneficiary may elect to disclaim, 
or refuse, an interest in property he or she doesn’t want to accept. Why on 
earth would anyone choose not to inherit, you ask, unless he or she has 
taken a vow of poverty? As with many decisions in a person’s financial life, 
the answer is “for tax reasons.” When someone effectively disclaims an inter-
est in property, he or she is refusing it before receiving it.
 
As the estate’s executor, it’s your responsibility to inform the beneficiaries 
that they have the option to disclaim any or all of their legacy. In practice, if 
you have a feel for any or all of the beneficiaries’ financial situations, you’ll 
know whom to approach with this information — that would be the beneficia-
ries who already may have taxable estates for federal estate tax purposes (see 
Chapter 16 for the current taxable estate levels). For purposes of inheritance 
(including federal and state gift and estate or inheritance tax purposes), a dis-
claiming beneficiary is treated as though he or she predeceased the decedent. 
The assets disclaimed then pass to whoever is next in line to receive them. 
You may know the respective beneficiaries’ financial situations (probably 
because they’re descendants of the decedent, who shared their financial situa-
tions with you during life); otherwise, you can just present this option to each 
appropriate beneficiary as a possibility.
Consult your state’s law for specifics, but generally speaking, to make an 
effective disclaimer (refuse the inheritance) the disclaimant must
 
✓ Refuse the property, in writing, within a reasonable time after becom-
ing aware of it. Check state statutes, but reasonable time is often nine 
months, which is the same as the deadline to file Form 706 without 
extensions.
 
✓ Accept no benefits from the property.
 
✓ Have no control over who receives the disclaimed property.

130
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Disclaimers can be very helpful in correcting overfunding or underfunding 
of marital deductions, or simply in not growing the disclaimant’s taxable 
estate unnecessarily if he or she is content with the new recipients of the dis-
claimed property.
So, for instance, if a beneficiary’s descendants stand to inherit the beneficiary’s 
share if he or she predeceases your decedent, an effective disclaimer will pass 
the assets to that next generation at no estate or inheritance tax cost to the 
disclaimant. Of course, the estate will have a transfer subject to generation-
skipping transfer (GST) tax in that illustration, which you as executor must 
keep in mind in preparing the United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping 
Transfer) Tax Return (Form 706). See Chapters 16 and 17, and consult a 
competent estate and GST tax expert.
Segregating and Distributing 
Specific Property
As the estate’s administrator, you’re responsible for securing all assets, 
including personal and household property. If a decedent bequeaths (leaves 
in his or her will) any specific items to a beneficiary or beneficiaries, you’re 
responsible for separating and segregating those items.
If you don’t take the necessary precautions (such as locking them away out of 
the reach of light-fingered relatives) to protect the assets, you’ll be in a pretty 
pickle if, when the time comes for distribution, you can’t come up with Aunt 
Hattie’s engagement ring or Cousin Minerva’s pearls. These are exactly the 
kinds of items that can come up missing when family and friends with a feeling 
of entitlement have unsupervised access to the residence of the decedent.
Knowing about pretermitted heirs
A child or issue of a deceased child who isn’t 
provided for in the decedent’s will, known as a 
pretermitted heir, is entitled to the share he or 
she would have received if the decedent had 
died without a will (intestate). However, the 
pretermitted heir isn’t entitled to anything if the 
decedent has
 ✓ Provided for that child or issue during life, or 
 ✓ Made it clear, usually in the will, that the 
omission was intentional.
Check the fine points of your state law if this 
situation arises.
Testators who really want to disinherit an heir 
are very canny about crossing their t’s and dot-
ting their i’s, and will likely have included a spe-
cific clause in their last will either saying that 
no provision has been made for that beneficiary 
under the will because he or she was provided 
for during lifetime or leaving that beneficiary 
some token amount, like $1 or $100.

131
 Chapter 8: Paying the Debts, Expenses, Bequests, and Devises from the Estate
This section takes a closer look at specific scenarios you may encounter 
when segregating and distributing the different types of property and what 
you must do to ensure that the beneficiaries receive what’s due to them.
Tread slowly before distributing
When securing the decedent’s assets before you actually distribute anything 
to beneficiaries, you want to ensure that you tread carefully. Take your time 
and carefully refer to the will and its instructions before making any distribu-
tions. Keep the following in mind before you release anything:
 
✓ If the property named in a specific bequest or devise is no longer owned 
by the decedent at death, that bequest or devise has no effect and is 
considered adeemed. The legatee receives nothing, unless state law 
provides otherwise. For instance, if the decedent left a particular bank 
account to a beneficiary under the will and the bank account no longer 
exists, the beneficiary receives nothing.
 
✓ If a named beneficiary of a specific bequest or devise died before the 
decedent and the will makes no provision that the beneficiary’s heirs 
or another person inherits, the bequest or devise fails or lapses, unless 
state law provides otherwise. Massachusetts law, for example, provides 
that if the named beneficiary who predeceased the decedent is a child 
or other relation of the decedent, that beneficiary’s issue, if any, inherit 
unless the will provides otherwise.
 
✓ If the decedent left a will, check to see whether it contains a clause 
saying that all debts, expenses and taxes are to be paid from the residue 
(the amount left after paying out all specific bequests and devises) of 
the estate. Be sure to also review any revocable living trust for similar 
language regarding paying expenses of the estate.
 
✓ If the decedent’s state of domicile has an inheritance tax, be sure that 
the tax isn’t attributed to the legatee or devisee and payable by them 
or from what they inherit from the estate. If the beneficiary is liable for 
the tax, you want to pay it from their share or have proof they’ve paid it 
before distributing their bequest or devise, unless the will provides that 
the estate pay such tax.
Making the distributions
 
As you distribute each asset, follow these important general steps:
 
1. Have the recipient date and sign a receipt for the property.
 
 Have a receipt already prepared, describing the property you’re distribut-
ing and, in the document, having the beneficiary acknowledge receipt of it.

132
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
2. If the distribution completely fulfills the bequest or devise to that 
beneficiary, obtain the beneficiary’s signature on an assent to the 
allowance of your accounts as executor.
 
 That way, when it’s time for you to have the probate accounts allowed, 
you don’t have to track down the beneficiary. The receipt and assent will 
be filed with the probate court when you have your estate account(s) 
allowed (and, of course, remember to keep copies for your estate 
records). See Chapter 9 for more on account allowance procedures.
The following sections focus on the specific types of property and any unique 
requirements you have to do when distributing them.
Consider tangible property
Tangible property is property you can touch or feel, such as a chair, a hand-
kerchief, or a piece of land. Tangible property can be divided into two clas-
sifications: tangible personal property and tangible real property. Knowing 
these two classifications is important because, in your role as executor, these 
terms come up frequently and it’s helpful to know what property the court 
(or whomever) may be referring to. Also, tangible real property (real estate) 
is always handled differently than other estate assets. How it’s handled 
depends on the law in your decedent’s state.
 
✓ Personal property (bequests — gifts under the will of personal prop-
erty): If the decedent left specific bequests of personal property, you 
may distribute those bequests only after you’ve been appointed as exec-
utor, the property has been appraised, the date for filing of claims has 
passed, you’ve made sure that you have adequate funds to pay all estate 
expenses, and you’ve checked the estate and income tax consequences 
described earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Real estate (devises — gifts under the will of real property): In some 
states, title to real estate passes automatically to the heirs upon the 
decedent’s death, subject to any mortgage or lien on the property and 
to payment of debts of the decedent (including any estate taxes owed). 
You need take no formal action. In many other states, real estate held 
in the decedent’s name alone appears on the estate inventory and must 
pass through probate in the same manner as any other probate prop-
erty. In some states, to distribute specifically devised real property, you 
specifically petition the court for approval of distribution of the real 
property and obtain a court order allowing the distribution and includ-
ing the property description. The resulting court order is then recorded 
with the register of deeds in the county where the property is located to 
show the chain of title passing to the beneficiary. Check with your local 
probate register to determine the method of transfer in your state.

133
 Chapter 8: Paying the Debts, Expenses, Bequests, and Devises from the Estate
Look at intangible property
Intangible property is property that has no value in and of itself but is the evi-
dence of value, such as a stock certificate or bond. You can distribute intan-
gibles at the same time and in the same manner as tangibles, except that, 
unless they’re bearer bonds (which aren’t held in any name), you may have to 
go through a process to reregister them in the beneficiary’s name.
To have stocks and bonds reregistered in a beneficiary’s name, either send 
or take the following for each such security either to the transfer agent 
directly for each security (the transfer agent will be shown on the face of the 
security), or take all securities to a bank or brokerage firm (each of whom 
will likely charge for this service):
 
✓ The bond or stock certificate.
 
✓ A form entitled “Assignment Separate from Certificate” with your signa-
ture guaranteed (you can obtain this form from the bank or brokerage 
house if necessary, and they can also guarantee your signature). If you 
have a bank or brokerage firm with which you have a friendly relation-
ship, one of their employees who is qualified to do so may be willing to 
guarantee your signature at no cost.
 
✓ A certified copy of your Letters of Authority as Executor (the certifica-
tion by the court needs to be less than 60 days old). You obtain this 
document from the court for a small fee.
 
✓ Depending on the transfer agent and your decedent’s state of domicile, 
you may also need an affidavit of domicile, a waiver of state taxes (from 
your state taxing authority), and certified copies of the decedent’s death 
certificate and will.
If you’re holding the security in an estate brokerage account, you distribute 
to the beneficiaries by instructing your broker, in writing, of the names in 
which the securities should now be registered. Of course, in establishing the 
estate brokerage account, you’ve gone through similar transfers for each 
security, although the broker will have handled the paperwork.
 
If you’re actually reregistering physical stock and bond certificates, the new 
certificates in the beneficiary’s name should be returned to you. Make every-
thing as easy as possible for the beneficiary to comply with. Send the new 
certificates to the beneficiary, certified mail, return receipt requested, along 
with a receipt for the beneficiary to sign and return in the postage paid return 
address envelope that you enclose.

134
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Bequest of specific dollar amount
To fulfill a bequest of a specific dollar amount called a pecuniary bequest, 
simply write a check on the estate’s checking account (making sure that you 
have transferred funds to the account for this purpose) at the appropriate 
time, which is the same as for tangible personal property and, of course, 
obtain the necessary receipt.
For example, if the decedent left a bequest to her nephew of $10,000, after the 
period for filing of claims against the estate has passed, if it’s clear there’s 
plenty of money to pay all taxes, debts, and expenses, you may write a check 
to the nephew from the estate’s checking account in the amount of $10,000, 
and mail it to him, certified mail, return receipt requested, along with a 
receipt for him to sign for the bequest and an assent by him to the accounts 
of the executor.
Dividing Other Personal 
Property Equitably
Divvying and dividing the personal and household articles is frequently one 
of the stickiest parts of estate administration. Whether the estate is large or 
small, we’ve both witnessed many times the passion heirs can feel toward 
the personal property of the decedent (and toward the other heir who gets 
something they wanted). Unfortunately, sometimes figuring out how to divide 
up the property isn’t so crystal clear. This situation arises under the follow-
ing conditions:
 
✓ The decedent leaves all personalty (person and household items) to a 
class of beneficiaries, such as “those of my children who survive me”
 
✓ The personalty falls into the residue (the assets left after payment of all 
debts, administration expenses, and bequests and devises) for lack of a 
specific bequest, and the residue goes to a class or group of people
 
✓ The decedent dies intestate (without a will) and a group, such as the 
decedent’s children and the issue of any deceased child, per stirpes (by 
right of representation, that is, the children of such deceased child, and 
if any of those children is deceased, that deceased child’s children, and 
so on) inherit
None of these three conditions are completely black and white. In each of 
them, no plan is available for distributing the personal articles. You can 
always hope the decedent at least left labels or stickers on the bottom of 
furniture, but stickers can dry up and fall off (or get switched; perish the 
thought). Following we discuss ways to deal with this unfortunate and messy 
situation.

135
 Chapter 8: Paying the Debts, Expenses, Bequests, and Devises from the Estate
Basing division on letter of intent
The best of all possible worlds is when the decedent has left a letter of intent 
written during his or her lifetime, where he or she listed which items of prop-
erty are to go to whom. This letter may even be referred to in the will. Such 
a letter takes the burden of division off you as executor and, although the 
beneficiaries may still harbor hard feelings, they have only the decedent to 
blame (not each other). Although this letter doesn’t have the legal standing 
of a will and shouldn’t be used in place of one, it’s very effective at silencing 
family bickering and beneficiaries’ claims that Mother always intended for 
them to have the family silver.
All you have to do is follow the decedent’s clear wishes in the letter of intent 
and distribute the respective assets to the designated persons. Remember: 
Don’t forget to get receipts listing each item received and assents to the 
accounts.
Creating a system for heirs to choose
If you’re left no guidance by the decedent, such as a letter of intent, you must 
create an equitable system for the beneficiaries to choose the items they 
want to have. So how do you do that, you’re wondering? One method is to 
draw the names from a hat (or whatever vessel you have handy) to establish 
the order in which they may choose. Each person then takes a turn choosing 
one item, perhaps applying color-coded stickers as they do so, until all items 
of interest are accounted for. Don’t be surprised if this process goes down to 
the last pie plate. Again, getting a receipt listing each item received by a par-
ticular beneficiary is crucial.
Disposing of unwanted personal property
As you’re distributing the personal property, you may come across some 
items that no beneficiary really wants. If that’s the case, you have several 
options. If you have enough items to attract an auctioneer, you can hold 
an auction, with the proceeds divided among the beneficiaries. Or you can 
donate the unwanted personal property to any charity that takes such prop-
erty. In fact, many charities make house calls if you have large items or spe-
cific items they’re interested in. Just be sure to get a receipt if you’re thinking 
of taking that tax deduction, if it’s allowed.
If the will directs you to give the personal property to charity, you can 
deduct the amount of the gift on Form 1041, Schedule A, which is located 
on the back of the form. Do an Internet search of the local area or check the 
phone book if you aren’t familiar with any such charities.

136
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Slicing Up the Residue
The residue of the estate represents all assets left in the estate after payment 
of all debts, administration expenses, and taxes and the distribution of all 
specific bequests and devises. Your job here is pretty clear cut: Either your 
decedent made provision for the disposition of the estate’s residue in his or 
her will or the state laws of intestacy provide for the manner of distribution. 
(See Appendix B for brief summaries of individual state laws.) If your dece-
dent left a will that leaves the residue to his or her revocable trust, the resi-
due simply pours over into that trust, and you merely bring about the transfer 
of the assets into the trustee or trustees’ names in whatever manner those 
trustees direct (for instance, into a brokerage account in their names).
 
To fulfill a bequest of a specific dollar amount, simply write a check on the 
estate’s checking account (after making sure that you’ve placed sufficient 
funds there to do so). You may pay the bequest after the period for filing of 
claims, as we discuss earlier in this chapter.
The following list briefly touches on the main two ways to handle the rest of 
the pie and distribute the residue:
 
✓ Dividing up the residue by percentage or fractional share: If the resi-
due is to go to more than one person or entity, the will may provide 
that the residue be divided by percentage or fractional share of the 
total assets. Each will have the same effect. For instance, it may say, “25 
percent to each of my four children who are then living, per stirpes,” or, 
“
1⁄4 to each of my four children who are then living, per stirpes.” In each 
case, one-quarter of each asset is distributed to the then-living children 
and the issue of each deceased child. (In this example, the will would 
hopefully make provision for the contingency of a child dying leaving no 
issue, typically that that share would be divided among the other chil-
dren’s shares).
 
✓ Dividing by per capita or per stirpes: If the residue is to be divided per 
capita, each person gets an equal share, no matter what the relationship 
to the decedent. If the residue is to be divided per stirpes or by right of 
representation, you divide it equally at each generational level, with any 
issue of a deceased person to take his or her share. For instance, the 
residue may go to all the decedent’s children living at the decedent’s 
death, with the issue of any deceased child to divide that child’s share 
equally per stirpes.

In This Chapter

▶ Taking care of the last administrative expenses
▶ Doling out the rest of the distributions
▶ Preparing and filing the final paperwork
A
dministering the estate has been a long haul, but the finish line is 
within easy reach now. If you’re ready to close the estate, you just need 
to make sure you wrap up all loose ends. Closing the estate may seem like 
a lot of work, but trust us: Compared to what you’ve already accomplished, 
this final step is a cakewalk.
In this chapter, you reach the culmination of your hard work, dedication, and 
attention to myriad details on behalf of your decedent. Here’s where you find 
everything you need to do as executor to wind up the estate and just how 
to do it: getting releases of lien for real estate, paying final administration 
costs, making final distributions to residuary beneficiaries, preparing probate 
accounts and getting them approved by the court, preparing final income 
tax returns, obtaining tax closing letters, and filing with the probate court all 
those receipts you collected from the beneficiaries.
Obtaining Tax Closing Letters
If you filed a Form 706 (United States Estate [and Generation-Skipping 
Transfer) Tax Return; see Chapters 16 and 17], and/or a state estate or inheri-
tance tax return, you need estate tax closing letters (letters saying the IRS and 
the state have accepted the returns, as filed or with adjustments) before you 
can close the estate. At this point, you pay any added taxes caused by adjust-
ments; if you’re lucky enough to avoid those, you may even get a refund 
(although that’s unlikely).

138
Part II: Administering an Estate 
The following are the two types of tax closing letters you’ll receive:
 
✓ From the IRS: The IRS issues an estate tax closing letter when it con-
cludes that the return is accepted as filed or that the required adjust-
ments are completed. You can then proceed to close the estate.
 
✓ From the individual state(s): After you’ve received your federal estate tax 
closing letter, file it with your state tax authority, including any informa-
tion on adjustments made to the estate tax return as filed. (You may have a 
deadline on this filing, so be aware). The state taxing authority then issues 
its closing letter, making any adjustments based on the federal return.
 
Don’t put the federal estate tax closing letter in the pile of things to get to when 
you have a chance. File it promptly in any states where you’ve also filed an 
estate or inheritance tax return or paid any estate taxes (check out Appendix 
B for a list of states that currently charge taxes on estates or inheritances). 
Remember, you can’t put this task of estate administration behind you until 
you finish all these seemingly minor — but actually fairly important — details.
Obtaining Releases of 
Lien for Real Estate
Whenever someone dies, the title to any real estate he or she owned 
(whether alone or with someone else) gains a little cloud, an estate (or inheri-
tance) tax lien, that prevents you from selling the property with a clear title 
until you (the executor) have taken care of it. Liens are how states and the 
federal government make sure they receive the taxes they feel are due, and 
you can only release the lien if you pay those taxes or prove to the taxing 
authority that no taxes are due. To obtain a federal estate tax release of lien, 
request that a Form 792, Certificate of Release of Lien, be issued when filing 
your Form 706 (see Chapter 16).
Check with your state’s department of taxation to see what steps you need 
to take to release the state’s lien. Liens should be released prior to the sale 
of the property, but that’s not always possible. Don’t fear if some taxes are 
due but you don’t have the money to pay them; the state sends someone 
to the closing to collect the taxes owed in exchange for a release of lien. If 
there’s some question whether or not taxes are due, the state often accepts 
an escrow payment, which it refunds after a final tax determination has been 
reached.
 
If there’s no taxable estate for federal estate tax purposes, you can’t get a 
release of lien, but that’s okay. Instead, have your real estate or estate attor-
ney prepare a recordable affidavit stating that no estate tax is due, and sign it 
in your capacity as executor, administrator, or trustee, whichever applies.

139
 Chapter 9: Closing the Estate
 
After you have the release of lien or affidavit in your hot little hands, run, 
don’t walk, to the Registry of Deeds in the county or town where the property 
is located to record that baby. The release of lien or affidavit becomes part 
of the title history attached to that property, and every time it’s sold or refi-
nanced, that lien and its subsequent release or the affidavit will be noted on 
the title examiner’s report. Check with your local probate court, register of 
deeds, or a local probate attorney to see which method is used in your state 
to obtain clear title on the real estate.
Paying Final Administration Expenses
When you’re close to finishing and closing an estate, making final distributions 
to residuary beneficiaries before you pay amounts still owed for administration 
can be tempting. Be patient and make sure that all administration expenses are 
paid first; otherwise, you may find yourself begging, usually unsuccessfully, for 
the residuary beneficiaries to give back some of what they’ve received so you 
can pay what’s still owed. The following are fees that are typically still owed as 
you come toward the end of the estate’s administration:
 
✓ Attorney’s and accountant’s fees: For preparation of Form 706 and Form 
1041, and for the probate accounting.
 
✓ Executor’s or administrator’s fee: Pay yourself your executor’s fee, 
which must be reasonable. You establish your fee in one of two ways: 
The decedent’s will determines the amount (or at least spells out how to 
calculate it), or state statute fixes the amount based on a fee schedule. 
In some jurisdictions, your fee as executor must be what would be con-
sidered reasonably necessary. Some of the factors that may be consid-
ered in determining your fee include
 
• The size of the estate
 
• The complexity of estate matters that you’re called upon to handle
 
• The amount of time you spent administering the estate
 
• How well you did your job
 
• Fees received by others for similar work
 
• The results of your efforts
 
 You’re also allowed reimbursement for reasonable expenses you 
incurred in administering the estate, from appraiser’s fees you paid out 
of pocket to the cost of envelopes and postage.
 
 Be sure to itemize all such expenses in your accounting so the court can 
see where the money has gone.

140
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
✓ Miscellaneous administration expenses: Pay any other unpaid expenses 
of administration, including to other professionals and the court, or set 
aside funds for their payment. Any funds set aside, which should be 
minimal at this point, should be kept in a non-interest bearing account 
to avoid having to recalculate the estate income tax for very small earn-
ings or file another year’s return to satisfy the IRS.
 
✓ Estate income taxes: Although owing any estate income taxes on the final 
returns is uncommon, make sure that you pay anything you do owe.
Here’s where your up-to-date checkbook and accounting records come in 
handy. Check them to see what fees are outstanding. Check out Chapter 8 for 
more info on paying these different expenses.
Making Final Distributions 
to Residuary Beneficiaries
Although you can make partial distributions of residuary (what’s left after 
payment of expenses, debts, taxes, and specific bequests and devises) shares 
after the period for filing claims has passed and you know the amount of 
the estate and inheritance taxes, such partial distribution is by no means 
required. However, in order to completely close the estate, you should make 
final distributions of residuary shares when you’ve settled all the affairs of 
the estate, including receiving the estate and inheritance tax closing letters, 
and prepared the final account (and, in some circumstances, not until after 
its allowance by the probate court). If you haven’t paid all the final expenses, 
keep a reserve to do so. (Refer to Chapter 8 for the lowdown on how to make 
distributions to residuary beneficiaries.)
Preparing and Filing Final 
Estate Income Tax Returns
After you distribute all the estate assets, you may now prepare the final estate 
income tax returns even if you haven’t reached the end of your tax year. 
Because no tax is due, you’re not in any danger of paying taxes before you have 
to; you’re only making sure that you don’t forget this important step. Write the 
dates of the tax year you’re using at the top of the form, and be sure to mark 
this return “Final” by not only checking the box but also writing the word Final

rific! Chapter 19 discusses specifically what happens to the estate income and 
deductions for tax purposes in the final year of the estate.

 Chapter 9: Closing the Estate
Check out Chapter 18 for a thorough discussion of how to prepare the estate 
income tax returns. You’ve no doubt been preparing and filing these right 
along on a yearly basis and in a timely fashion, even if you haven’t done 
much other accounting work until now, because Uncle Sam waits for no man, 
woman, or executor.
Preparing Accounts for Allowance 
by the Probate Court
You may feel that we’ve overemphasized the importance of keeping good 
records, but good records really come into play now when you’re closing the 
estate and preparing the estate accountings for allowance (approval by the 
probate court). Those records you’ve kept will pay off in spades.
 
The exact procedure and order of events for allowance of accounts and for 
closing your estate varies by your decedent’s state (and even county) of 
domicile (decedent’s legal residence). In some states, the final account is first 
presented for allowance, and after it’s allowed, the court enters an Order 
Assigning Residue. You distribute the assets to the beneficiaries and obtain 
receipts. The final step is to file the receipts with the probate court and pre-
pare and request that the court enter a Discharge and Order Closing Estate. 
Be sure to check with your local probate court for the proper procedure and 
order of these events; you’ve come so far, it would be a shame to mess up 
now. This section helps you prepare your accounts and petition for allow-
ance, distribute the balance of the estate (the residue) to the beneficiaries, and 
obtain your discharge as executor.
Use the appropriate form of accounting
Prepare your probate accountings based on the accounting form used in 
your local probate court. You may prepare your accountings on an annual 
basis as you do your estate income tax returns (and, in fact, some courts may 
require that you do so and file them annually with the probate court). Check 
to see what form of account applies in your jurisdiction and when they are 
required to be filed and allowed. Even if they’re required to be filed annually, 
you may not be required to seek their allowance until the final account is 
filed. The first (which is sometimes also the final) accounting starts with the 
assets you listed on the estate inventory.
Check with your court to see which one of the following forms of probate 
accounting you should use.

142
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Principal and income
Some states require an accounting that differentiates between income and 
principal, but most don’t for estates (but may for trusts under wills). Income 
is interest, dividends, rents, and the like; the earnings on the principal during 
the period of the accounting. Principal is the assets of the estate on which 
income is earned. Principal and income accounting basically means that the 
principal and any additions to or subtractions from principal are accounted 
for on their own schedule (or in a separate column depending on the form 
the court is using), and income to the estate is accounted for on its own 
schedule (or in its own column of the accounting). The income and principal 
are then reconciled at the end of the accounting or at the bottom of the col-
umns. Check out Chapter 12 for more on the differences between these two 
terms and a sample account.
Receipts and expenditures
In some states you have to report assets or income received (receipts) on 
one schedule, including as your first entries those assets on the probate 
inventory (for example, Schedule A), expenditures on another schedule 
(for example, Schedule B), and property on hand at the end of the account-
ing period on a third (for example, Schedule C). This form of accounting is 
called receipts and expenditures accounting. If your accounting balances (as 
it should), and this is your final account, your ending balance will be zero 
because you’ll have distributed all the assets of the estate before you file 
your final accounting.
Length of accounting period
Some courts may require that an annual accounting be filed, but others 
permit your accounting to run from the date of death through the closing of 
the estate, even if that period is several years. If you’re preparing an annual 
account, you may have two choices to bring your account to a full year after 
your decedent’s date of death:
 
✓ Using a calendar year-end (which coincides with those 1099’s you may 
be receiving)
 
✓ Using a fiscal year-end (any month end other than December)
If your court allows a choice, choose whatever works best for you. 
Remember, just because you may have chosen a fiscal year-end for income 
tax purposes doesn’t mean you’re required to choose the same year-end 
for your probate accounting. (Refer to Chapter 18 for more info on deciding 
which choice may be right for you.)

143
 Chapter 9: Closing the Estate
Obtain assents of beneficiaries
In the best of all worlds, you next obtain the assent (a form of written agree-
ment to the account) of each interested party to the probate account. The 
court then typically allows (approves) the account on the basis of those 
assents without notice (giving notice to each interested party in a manner set 
forth by the court, similar to the notice requirement for allowance of the will 
in Chapter 6), which saves you the time and expense of service of a citation 
(check out the following section).
When you obtain a receipt from a beneficiary for distribution (which we 
discuss in Chapter 8), you hopefully also obtained an assent to all of your 
accounts as executor if the distribution fully satisfied the interest of that ben-
eficiary under the will. For those assents you didn’t obtain, now’s the time to 
send to each beneficiary the following:
 
✓ A copy of the account(s).
 
✓ An assent form (which you can obtain from your probate court), some-
times called an Assent and Waiver of Notice, for the beneficiary to sign, 
indicating that he or she assents to the probate court’s allowance of 
your account(s) and requesting that the court allow the account(s) and 
(in certain instances) waive receipt of notice that the account is being 
presented to the court for allowance. (Translation: The beneficiary 
doesn’t want an official notification that the account is being presented.)
 
Be sure to include an extra copy of the assent form for the beneficiary to keep, 
and a self-addressed, stamped envelope, if you want a prompt reply from your 
beneficiary.
Get the probate court’s approval 
without all assents
Before you can close the estate, you need to jump through a series of hoops 
to have your accounts allowed (approved) by the probate court. Doing so may 
take time, but getting the probate court to approve your actions as executor 
is well worth it in the end, because you’re then generally relieved of liability 
(except in the case of fraud or manifest error). Check with your local probate 
court for the exact procedure for allowance of accounts. In the final stages 
before you can close the estate, there are some common requirements.

144
Part II: Administering an Estate 
Time for filing
Although some jurisdictions allow you to file accounts that cover more than one 
year, others require you to file an account annually with the court, whether or 
not you seek its allowance by the court. Often, you don’t file any of the accounts 
until the estate is closed and you seek their allowance by the court.
 
Be aware, though, that certain states put more emphasis on timely filed 
accounts than others, and you may be liable for late fees or even court sanc-
tions if you don’t produce the required accounts when they’re due. Even if 
you’re living in a state with a laissez-faire attitude toward most accounts, the 
more contentious your dealings with any or all of the interested parties, the 
more likely your probate court is to demand that you produce the accounts 
according to its deadline. Always check with your local probate court for its 
policy on the time for filing accounts and its enforcement of that policy.
Filing fees
Most if not all states have a filing fee, set by statute, that must accompany 
the filing of the account with the probate court. In order to file the account, 
you need to make that sure you pay these fees. The amount of the fee may 
be based on either the size of the estate or the length of account (so much 
per year, if you have a multiple-year accounting) and is intended to cover the 
cost of the probate court’s review of the account. Check with your local court 
before filing your accounts because the fees are subject to change.
Petition for allowance
Prepare and file a petition for allowance of the account, and also prepare 
a proposed order allowing the account. In the petition, you ask that the 
account(s) in question be allowed, your actions as executor be approved, 
and anything else pertinent to the particular account, such as your execu-
tor’s fee and distribution of the residuary estate, be allowed. File these and 
the account with the probate court along with the receipts of the beneficia-
ries (see the next section). At this time, request that a citation be issued, 
unless you have assents of all interested parties.
Receipts of specific and residuary beneficiaries
With the accounting, file all the receipts (forms where the beneficiaries 
acknowledged receiving their bequests or devises) from the specific (ben-
eficiaries of specific items or amounts) and residuary (beneficiaries who 
received the residue) beneficiaries with the court. See Chapter 8 for a discus-
sion of specific and residuary bequests.

145
 Chapter 9: Closing the Estate
Citation
During the process of closing the estate, you also need to deliver a citation, 
which may have another name and slightly different format in your dece-
dent’s jurisdiction; check with your local probate court. A citation is a notice 
sent to the interested parties in the manner specified by the court, either by 
publication or mailing. The citation includes a return date, typically four to 
six weeks later, set to allow time for the interested parties to have received 
the citation by regular mail and to respond to it if they so choose. The order 
of notice accompanying the citation indicates how far in advance of the 
return date you must mail or deliver a copy of the citation to the interested 
parties.
You obtain the order of notice from the probate court and pay a small fee. 
At the bottom of the citation, you complete the return of service, where you 
indicate what method of service you used, sign and date it, and return it to 
the court by the return day. You must carefully determine the interested par-
ties who must receive the citation. The following are the usual interested par-
ties, but check with your local probate court that you’ve correctly identified 
your interested parties:
 
✓ The beneficiaries, heirs-at-law, or their guardians (as applicable).
 
✓ If your residuary beneficiary is the trustee of the decedent’s revocable 
trust, as is common in estates including revocable trusts, the trustee 
(but not the trust beneficiaries) is an interested party.
 
✓ If one of the beneficiaries is a public charity, you must give notice to the 
Attorney General in the decedent’s state of residence.
 
✓ If a beneficiary is mentally retarded, you must give notice to the 
department of mental retardation in the beneficiary’s state of residence.
 
Check to see whether your state requires a specific type of mail. In 
Massachusetts, for example, the statute requires you to send the citation by 
registered mail, which has been further defined to include certified mail. Be 
sure to request a return receipt. Make notations in your file of the day you 
mailed the citation and attach your return receipts to this notation when you 
receive them.
You may also be required to publish the citation in a local newspaper accept-
able to the probate court unless all interested persons receive actual notice. 
Unless you’ve been able to hand deliver notices to all interested parties, you 
need to publish. The court can give you information on which newspapers 
meet the requirements necessary for legal notices. And, of course, the cost of 
publishing the citation is an estate expense.

146
Part II: Administering an Estate 
 
Be sure to retain copies of the newspaper pages where you’ve had the citation 
published. Because you’re paying for the legal notice, the newspaper will most 
likely provide you with one tear sheet showing the ad, the date it was pub-
lished, and the name of the publication. Don’t hesitate to ask for extras at the 
time you place the ad; the paper will be happy to provide you with them at the 
time the paper’s printed, but many of these papers don’t keep a large number 
of extra copies hanging about after the fact. If you ask a week or two after your 
legal notice has appeared, you may be out of luck.
Guardian ad litem
A guardian ad litem (GAL) must be appointed under certain circumstances to 
represent the interests of persons not yet born or ascertained (such as when 
the residuary beneficiary is a trust under the will for the decedent’s descen-
dants, and the executor is also the trustee), or legally incompetent (such as 
a minor with no legal guardian). Seek advice from an attorney experienced 
in probate law if you’re uncertain whether you need a guardian ad litem. If a 
GAL is required and appointed by the court, you give service of notice to the 
GAL and provide them with a copy of the account and ask that they assent to 
it. You then file a form from the GAL assenting to the account, along with the 
return of service on the citation and the military affidavit (see the next sec-
tion), with the probate court on the return day.
Military affidavit
In some states, before you can close the estate, you need to file a military 
affidavit stating whether any beneficiary is in the military service. You must 
file it whether or not a beneficiary is in the military. If so, an assent must 
be obtained from that person or a military attorney appointed to represent 
them. The same person can act as military attorney and guardian ad litem.
Entry of judgment allowing account
If all is in order when the account is filed and no one objects to its allowance, 
the court may enter a judgment allowing the account no earlier than the day 
after the return day. Some courts prepare the judgment, and some require 
that you prepare a proposed judgment for the court. Check with the court to 
see whether you’re preparing the judgment. If it wants you to do so, ask the 
court for a sample form of judgment if you haven’t prepared one in the past. 
Who prepares the judgment varies by not just state, but by county.
Surety
When the accounts have been allowed, notify the surety (the company guar-
anteeing the bond, to whom the estate has paid a fee, unless the bond was 
allowed with personal sureties, such as attorneys known to the court) on 
the bond (see Chapter 6) as applicable. The surety will then stop billing the 
estate for its services.

Operating a 
Revocable or 
Irrevocable Trust

In this part . . .
Y
ou may have dreamed about the day someone would 
hand you a large sum of money and tell you that you 
were now in charge. Well, that’s not exactly what happens 
when you become the trustee of a funded trust, but that 
situation has some similarities — and lots of differences. 
When you’re a trustee, you’re bound by lots of rules gov-
erning what you may and may not do with the property in 
the trust.
How do you know what you are and aren’t allowed to do 
with trust property? Whom can you make distributions to, 
and how much? How do you account for the property, and 
how should you invest it? You find all these answers in 
this part. We even tell you what records you need to keep 
and how to terminate the trust after it has run its course.

Chapter 10
Understanding the Trustee’s Duties
In This Chapter
▶ Making sure that you understand the trust instrument
▶ Using your discretion to fulfill the grantor’s wishes
▶ Keeping an eye on the assets and their best uses
▶ Staying on top of the paperwork
A
fter you’ve been named, and agreed to serve, as trustee (a person who 
holds property for the benefit of another) of a trust (a right of property 
that one person holds for the benefit of another; the conditions of the trust 
are usually spelled out in a trust instrument), you need to understand the 
trustee’s duties and powers as soon as possible. Your duties may vary based 
on the type of trustee you are (independent or family), but regardless, you 
now have fiduciary duties! Hopefully, the trust creator asked whether you 
were willing to serve before he or she named you as a trustee.
Whether or not you were asked beforehand, you don’t actually become 
a trustee until you accept the position; you can always decline to serve. 
Assuming you’ve agreed to serve, go over that trust instrument with a fine-
toothed comb and ask the grantor’s attorney (or one of your choosing) for 
the answers to any questions you have regarding the document itself or your 
role as trustee. This is no time to be shy; as with the rest of life, ignorance of 
the law is no excuse.
This chapter covers the role you’ve assumed, the duties you’ll be expected to 
carry out, and the expectations others will have for you. Read on, and enjoy 
the confidence the grantor has expressed in you!

150
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Reading the Trust Instrument
The trust instrument is your new bible, and reading and understanding its 
intentions is the first step in identifying your duties and powers as trustee. 
In the trust instrument the trust’s grantor (creator) includes all the powers 
he or she wants you to have and may specify some you can’t have! The laws 
of the state the grantor chooses to govern the trust address any issues you 
can’t find an answer for in the trust instrument; that state’s laws also trump 
the trust instrument if it goes against them. With respect to the validity of 
a trust, the grantor must choose a state’s laws with some connection to the 
trust. The grantor has the option of choosing either the domicile (residence) 
of the grantor, a trustee, a beneficiary, or even the location of trust assets; 
whichever state’s laws the grantor chooses govern all aspects of the trust. 
For real property held in the trust, the laws of the state in which the proper-
ty’s located govern that property. After you read the trust instrument, you’ll 
also know what the grantor’s plans are for the trust over time and for the 
people included in it as beneficiaries.
 
Of course, if you know about the trust before you actually assume any power 
over the property and are on close enough terms with the grantor, it’s always 
a good idea to talk with the grantor about his or her hopes and dreams for the 
property and exactly what benefit he or she wants the beneficiary to derive 
from the trust. Many trust instruments are couched in such nonspecific lan-
guage as to allow the trustee the widest possible latitude, but the grantor’s 
actual intent may be much more specific. One of us, for example, has been 
named trustee for a trust set up to look after the grantor’s sister and friend. 
Although the terms are intentionally vague, conversations with the grantor 
have made it clear what his intent is; now the job of the trustee is to carry that 
out to the best of her ability.
This section helps you take the trust instrument and develop a plan to exe-
cute it. Furthermore, we explain all the individuals who may play a role in a 
trust.
Creating a plan based on the trust’s terms
The terms of the trust govern what happens to the trust assets: who takes 
care of them (the trustee), who benefits from them (the beneficiaries), and 
how they will be invested. The terms of the trust instrument also dictate 
whether the property funding the trust remains in a single trust or is divided 
into multiple trusts governed by the same instrument. If the grantor wants 
multiple trusts, the instrument also directs when to divide the assets and 
when and how to make payments to beneficiaries. You as trustee make your 
plan for caring for the trust assets and beneficiaries based on what the trust 
instrument tells you to do and when to do it.

151
 Chapter 10: Understanding the Trustee’s Duties
For example, say you’re trustee of the Abigail Jones Trust, which is receiving 
assets from the Abigail Jones Estate. Under the terms of Abby’s trust, you 
divide the property you receive upon her death equally into three trusts, one 
for each of her children, with the trusts lasting for their lifetimes. As trustee, 
you have broad discretion under the trust instrument to pay or accumulate 
income and principal from each trust. Abby’s eldest child is a spendthrift; 
money runs through his hands like water. You know you’ll need to be par-
simonious in making distributions to him, so you place a fair amount of the 
assets in long-term growth investments. Abby’s middle child is a young 
schoolteacher. She’ll never make a large salary, but she lives within her 
means. However, she’ll have a hard time accumulating a down payment for 
a home, which you know was a priority of Abby’s. So you place a portion of 
the assets in her trust in a fairly liquid investment, for the time soon to come 
when that down payment is needed. Abby’s youngest child is still in high 
school and will be applying to college next year. You place four years’ worth 
of college costs in liquid investments staggered to mature at one-year inter-
vals. You pay out the money if she isn’t lucky enough to get a scholarship. 
The balance you invest in a mixture of assets that will provide income to the 
beneficiary, as well as increasing the value of the trust assets as you wait to 
see how this child develops.
Identifying the players
“All the world’s a stage, / And all the men and women merely players. . . .” 
—Shakespeare, As You Like It
The grantor of the trust may not have had Shakespeare’s words in mind 
when creating the trust, but he or she has indeed set the stage for his or her 
wishes to be played out under the trust instrument. As trustee, identifying 
the players is one of your important first steps because you need to know 
who the beneficiaries and remaindermen are (you presumably already know 
the grantor if he or she appointed you as trustee) and if there are any co-
trustees acting with you.
 
Here is a list of a typical “cast”:
 
✓ Grantor: Sometimes called the settlor, this person creates the trust.
 
✓ Trustee: The person or corporation charged with safeguarding and man-
aging the assets of the trust and making distributions to beneficiaries in 
accordance with the grantor’s stated wishes in the trust instrument. The 
trustee can be either independent or non-independent (usually a family 
member), and trusts may have either type of trustee or both.

152
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
• Independent trustee: An independent (or professional) trustee is 
one the IRS considers independent of the grantor and the benefi-
ciaries for estate tax purposes. That way, the principal of the trust 
isn’t included in the beneficiary’s taxable estate upon his or her 
own death. The independent trustee may be either.
 
• An individual independent trustee: An individual who is, hope-
fully, an expert in trust administration, such as an attorney, 
accountant, or enrolled agent.
 
• A corporate independent trustee: A bank or trust company whom 
the grantor appoints as trustee. This entity always qualifies as an 
independent trustee.
 
• Family or non-independent trustee: A family or non-independent 
trustee is one who is the grantor or a beneficiary (or is related to 
the grantor or a beneficiary in such a way that he or she wouldn’t 
be considered independent for estate tax purposes). Grantors 
frequently use family trustees with independent trustees so that a 
family member or another non-independent source can give input 
on trust matters that don’t affect the trust’s tax status. As long as 
the family trustee doesn’t have the power to make unrestricted 
distributions to himself or herself or to a dependent, he or she may 
participate in all other issues relating to managing the trust.
 
✓ Beneficiary(ies): Beneficiaries are those people or entities who/that 
have an interest in the trust, whether now (a present interest) or in the 
future (a future interest). An interest as a beneficiary can also be contin-
gent (relying upon an event in the future that may not happen) or vested 
(not subject to any contingencies). For instance, a person who could 
only become a beneficiary if the current beneficiary dies during the first 
person’s lifetime is a contingent beneficiary.
 
✓ Remaindermen: Remaindermen are those people or entities who will 
receive the trust property after an interest in it has expired. If, for 
instance, Uncle George leaves his property in trust for the lifetime of his 
wife, Aunt Rose, for her benefit, with the property to go outright to his 
nieces and nephews upon Aunt Rose’s death, the nieces and nephews 
are the remaindermen.
 
You, as trustee, are balancing the rights of the current and future beneficiaries 
and the remaindermen when you make your judgments as to distributions of 
principal and trust investments. If principal distributions are discretionary, 
assets left in the trust to accumulate benefit later beneficiaries and remain-
dermen, and your decisions as to what mix of income earning and growth 
investments to hold in the trust affects both the income beneficiary and the 
remaindermen (see Chapter 12).

153
 Chapter 10: Understanding the Trustee’s Duties
Empowering the Trustee
The powers the grantor gives you in the trust instrument are crucial. Not 
only can these powers determine what the beneficiary(ies) receive from the 
trust and when, but the administrative powers also ensure the smooth run-
ning of the trust. You have to strike a critical balance here. Hopefully the 
grantor gives you enough powers to run the trust with ease, economy, and 
diligence without giving you enough power to hang yourself (metaphorically, 
we hope!).
Buying and selling assets
You, as trustee, typically have the power under the trust instrument to buy 
and sell assets (except for any unusual asset the grantor wants retained in 
the trust). Aside from any other specific directions in the trust instrument or 
state law, you must follow the prudent man rule — that is, to act as a prudent 
person would in managing their own affairs. In addition, most states have 
a legal list of investments that are suitable for trusts. (Chapter 12 gives you 
more detailed info about buying and selling the assets in the trust.)
Determining distributions to beneficiaries
The grantor can determine the frequency and amount of the distributions 
to the beneficiaries in the terms of the trust, or he or she can leave it to 
your discretion as trustee. If the grantor leaves it to your discretion, your 
job includes observing any guidelines set forth by the grantor in the trust 
instrument, and adhering to the overall intent of the grantor. The following 
sections highlight some of the types of distributions you may need to make 
as a trustee. Chapter 13 provides more in-depth info about paying specific 
distributions.
Income distributions
Frequently, trust instruments direct that all income is to be distributed at least 
quarterly. Alternatively, income distributions may be made at other specified 
intervals, or at your discretion. Very often, the distribution schedule is based 
on the age of the beneficiary so that younger beneficiaries often only receive 
discretionary distributions (great for paying for college while still keeping 
financial aid options open), and older beneficiaries may become entitled to 
mandatory income distributions. No two trusts are the same, so you need to be 
sure to read the instrument upon your appointment and then reread it periodi-
cally to be certain that you’re still following the guidelines set out.

154
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Principal distributions
Distributions of principal, or corpus, are usually in the discretion of the 
trustee(s). The trust could also provide for no principal distributions, espe-
cially if the grantor wants to maintain the principal for a later generation of 
beneficiary.
 
Many trusts are set up with the intent of distributing the trust principal to the 
beneficiary over a period of time, usually between five and ten years, and at 
very specific ages (for example, a distribution of one-third of the trust princi-
pal at age 25, a half at age 30, and the remainder at age 35). Keep an eye out for 
this language as you make your plans for the administration of the trust and 
the investment of the assets, and mark those dates down in your calendar.
Trusts contain different standards for when principal distributions, if any, 
can be made to a beneficiary based on whether the trust has an independent 
trustee. The following are two reasons for different standards for principal 
distributions.
 
✓ With no independent trustee: If there isn’t an independent trustee (and 
the trust is for the benefit of someone other than the grantor), the IRS 
has identified certain “magic words” that restrict the distribution of 
principal and keep the trust from being included in the beneficiary’s 
estate for estate tax purposes. Although this structuring may seem 
incredibly technical, it’s an important point, especially for the benefi-
ciary and his or her heirs. The magic words that keep this trust out of 
the beneficiary’s estate are “health, education, maintenance, and sup-
port,” which constitute an ascertainable standard.
 
✓ With an independent trustee: Unfortunately, comfort isn’t one of the 
IRS’s magic words; using the word comfort makes a trust taxable in a 
surviving spouse’s estate. Because many grantors feel the ascertainable 
standard described previously is too limiting, especially in a trust for 
the surviving spouse, grantors frequently elect to have an independent 
trustee so that the grantor can bestow broader powers of principal dis-
tribution without causing adverse tax consequences to any party.
Hiring and firing advisors
The grantor and the person drafting the trust instrument understand that not 
every trustee will be a wizard at all aspects of trust administration, so trust 
instruments typically give the trustee the power to hire and fire advisors. Look 
for this power in your trust instrument. If you do decide to hire an advisor, check 
out Chapter 4 for more specific advice about finding out what’s a good fit.
After all, your grantor wants you to have any advice you need to run the trust 
and fulfill your fiduciary duty. And, if an advisor isn’t working out, including 
one whom the grantor has chosen, you need the power to let the advisor go — 

155
 Chapter 10: Understanding the Trustee’s Duties
whether for personal incompatibility with the trustee or a question of compe-
tence. If you feel you’ve given an advisor a fair chance to prove himself to you 
(and fair is defined by you as trustee, unless your trust instrument provides 
otherwise), then by all means fire him and hire another of your choice.
Coloring inside the Lines: Understanding 
Fiduciary Duty and Limitations
As a trustee, you have a fiduciary duty to the trust; that is, you must always 
act in accordance with the terms of the trust and in its best interests and 
the best interests of its beneficiaries and remaindermen. Your fiduciary duty 
is further spelled out in the governing state law and in court cases in that 
state over the years. Your attorney can advise you as to the law regarding 
your duties and limitations as any questions arise. Your failure to fulfill your 
fiduciary duty or overstepping your powers as trustee can lead to the ben-
eficiaries taking legal action against you. To avoid any potential lawsuits or 
problems, this section provides you with some important points you need to 
remember when administering a trust.
Exercising discretion
How much power you have to exercise discretion in your role as trustee 
depends on the language of the trust instrument, some of which is dictated 
by tax law if you’re a family trustee. The grantor, in choosing you, gave you a 
framework within which to work, but he or she also trusted you to make the 
best possible choices when circumstances dictate. In our experience, circum-
stance almost always dictates at some point or other.
Whether you have a great deal or only a tiny amount, some discretion is nec-
essary as trustee. You must be able to make and change investments in a way 
you feel benefits the trust; for example, even if you’re following the prudent 
man rule. And you must have some discretion in whether or not to make prin-
cipal distributions (if principal distributions are allowable).
As trustee, you’re often in the position of acting in place of the grantor, and 
somehow, you’re expected to do what he or she would have done in the same 
situation. Sound impossible? It is, but that doesn’t excuse you from trying 
your best. Obviously, the closer your personal relationship with the grantor, 
the more likely you’ll be to act in a way the grantor would have approved of. 
So, when you’re faced with the question of whether to pay that school tuition 
bill for one beneficiary, buy a car or a house for a second beneficiary, or 
bail a third beneficiary out of jail for the third time, applying what you know 
about the grantor to the question at hand may well provide you with the 
guidance you need to make these sometimes sticky decisions.

156
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
So, when faced with a decision, what do you do? Never make distributions 
willy-nilly, but document everything that you’re asked to distribute by the 
beneficiary. If you’re helping him or her to buy a house, make sure that you 
have copies of all the house purchase documents. If it’s school tuition that’s 
on the line, keep a copy of all the school bills you pay. And if you choose to 
bail someone out of jail, keep the receipt from the bail bondsman. Of course, if 
you opt to leave him or her there in timeout to think, write a memo to the file, 
laying out your reasoning for that decision, too.
Obtaining errors and omissions insurance
At one point in time, no one would have dreamed of suing a trustee. But in 
these litigious times, no one is immune to lawsuits, and that includes you in 
your role as trustee. So in order to protect yourself, don’t forget to obtain 
errors and omissions insurance. This insurance protects against claims by 
beneficiaries that you haven’t fulfilled your fiduciary duty in the management 
and administration of the trust. Contact your insurance broker about obtain-
ing this insurance, which is a deductible trust expense.
 
Without errors and omissions insurance, if you make a mistake in administer-
ing the trust, no matter how unintentional, a disgruntled beneficiary can go 
after you and your personal assets. If you have insurance coverage, the insur-
ance company will defend you against a questionable lawsuit, because it won’t 
want to pay out a claim unless it feels the claim is justified. Buying this insur-
ance is money well spent.
Protecting the Trust’s Assets
Among the myriad of duties you assume as trustee is a duty to protect the 
trust assets. In today’s financial world, protecting the assets most likely 
doesn’t mean hanging on to those assets with which the trust was funded — 
unless those assets consist of shares of a closely held business, a family-owned 
farm, or the like that the grantor specifically instructed be retained in the trust.
In that case, you fulfill your duty as trustee by retaining the asset and seeing 
that it’s managed as competently as possible. However, barring an instruc-
tion in the document to retain specific assets, as trustee you must constantly 
look at the assets to see whether they’re the most appropriate to serve the 
trust purposes. This section gives you the 4-1-1 on how to guard the assets.

157
 Chapter 10: Understanding the Trustee’s Duties
Diversifying the assets
“Don’t put all your eggs in one basket” doesn’t just apply on the farm. One 
of the cornerstones of today’s investment philosophy is to diversify assets 
into different classes, such as stocks and bonds, and into different industries, 
such as transportation, healthcare, consumer goods, energy stocks, and so 
on. That way, you spread the risk among several classes of investments and 
several industries, and the danger of overall loss lessens. This theory is that 
not all investments respond in the same way to all market conditions, so 
you’re better prepared for market changes in one class of asset or one indus-
try if you’re invested in several. Diversified mutual funds or mutual fund fami-
lies can be one answer to diversifying assets in a smaller trust.
Unlike investing your own money, where you’re allowed to invest in anything 
that’s legal, investing as a trustee requires that you exercise due diligence 
in researching investments and assume only moderate risk. Speculating, 
although not specifically prohibited, is strongly discouraged. Your goal 
shouldn’t be to scale great heights but rather to allow modest gains and pre-
vent drastic losses. Chapter 12 gives you more detailed info about investing 
the trust’s assets.
 
Failure to adequately diversify the assets held inside the trust (except those 
assets which the grantor specifically requires that you retain) can leave you 
open to accusations of incompetence (or worse) from the trust beneficiaries 
or remaindermen. If you choose an investment policy that runs counter to the 
standard wisdom, document your reasoning and be prepared to defend your 
choices — in court, if necessary.
Asking for help
 
Getting recommendations — by word of mouth, from other professionals, and even 
from advertisements — is great, but be sure to check them out thoroughly, including 
a call to the Better Business Bureau to see whether any complaints have been filed 
against them. The following are some professionals you may find useful:
 
✓ Investment advisors: An investment advisor is a person or company 
who advises the trustee as to what investments to make given the 
purpose of the trust, its size, and the needs of the beneficiaries. If you 
choose to use an investment advisor, always use one that charges a fee 
for services, not one who receives a percentage of sales!

158
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
✓ Trust companies, banks, and brokerages: Trust companies and banks 
that have trust departments can be useful for holding the assets of the 
trust. They can prepare periodic statements, annual accounts, and 
income tax returns and also invest the assets (all for a fee, of course). 
Trust assets may also be placed in a brokerage account or accounts, 
which provide you with periodic statements and investment advice. 
Generally, the fees involved in this option are for trades. Some broker-
ages prepare annual accounts and tax returns for an additional fee; 
others don’t. If you need this service, ask before you open the account.
 
✓ Lawyers, accountants, and enrolled agents: Lawyers who specialize in 
trust law can be useful to you in interpreting the trust document and 
guiding you as to state law and your role as trustee. Depending on indi-
vidual state laws, law firms may also have trust departments, where the 
assets of the trust can be invested and the trust can be administered. 
Accountants and enrolled agents (tax professionals licensed by the U.S. 
Treasury Department) who are familiar with trust administration can 
prepare accountings and income tax returns.
See Chapter 4 for choosing the appropriate professionals to help you.
Preparing and Filing Annual Income 
Tax Returns and Accounts
As trustee, you’re responsible for preparing annual accounts and income 
tax returns or having them prepared by the appropriate professional. Don’t 
forget that, whoever prepares them, you’re responsible for their contents, so 
review them carefully!
If the trust was created under a will rather than under a separate trust instru-
ment, you must file annual accounts with the probate court (or its equivalent 
in your jurisdiction) and have them allowed by the court. Trusts under wills 
are a rarity nowadays, precisely because they require court supervision. We 
don’t even attempt to go into detail here on the details of allowance of such 
accounts.
When you have the annual accounts ready, send copies to all current benefi-
ciaries along with a document by which he or she assents to the account. See 
Chapter 15 for more specific details regarding preparation of annual accounts 
and Chapter 18 for how to prepare the income tax returns.

Chapter 11
Funding the Trust
In This Chapter
▶ Moving assets into the trust while the grantor is alive
▶ Reregistering existing assets
▶ Funding a trust after the grantor’s death
T
he trust instrument has finally been signed. You’ve agreed to serve as 
trustee and have also had a chance to look over the provisions of the 
trust, so you probably have a good idea what you may and may not do as 
trustee. Now you have to identify the property that belongs in this trust and 
figure out how you’re going to move it from point A (the grantor’s posses-
sion), to point B (the trust).
This chapter explains how to transfer all sorts of property and what special 
considerations you need to make allowances for. We show you how to make 
sure the transfer process is smooth and alert you to possible gift tax conse-
quences for transfers made during the grantor’s lifetime.
Putting Assets in Trust during Life
If you’re the trustee of a trust whose grantor is still living, or if you’re both 
the trustee and the grantor of a trust that’s ready to start operations, you’re 
probably ready to start moving assets (items of value owned by any entity) 
into the trust. For example, the grantor may have designed the trust to 
avoid probating certain assets and/or to make everything accessible for the 
grantor’s benefit if he or she becomes incapacitated. (To verify the trust’s 
purpose, refer to Chapter 3.)
 
Whatever the reason for establishing a trust, now that it’s up and running you 
need to give it something to run on: assets. Before you begin to transfer assets 
into the trust, have the following documents handy:

160
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
✓ Certified copy of the trust instrument: Usually just a photocopy of the 
instrument, with the words, “A True Copy. Attested by” typed on the 
front page, and the trustee’s original signature. You may make multiple 
certified copies, but all must have original signatures on the front page.
 
✓ Federal Taxpayer Identification Number: If you haven’t already applied 
for one, you absolutely need one (unless the trust’s a revocable living 
trust [see Chapter 3] in which case you may use the grantor’s Social 
Security Number during the grantor’s lifetime) before you can open any 
accounts or transfer any assets. Check out Chapter 18 to find what you 
need to do in order to obtain this number.
 
✓ Proof of ownership: You must show documentation that proves the 
grantor owns the property before you can transfer it to the trust; for 
example, a deed to real estate, stock and/or bond certificates, or bank or 
broker account statements.
Depending on the type of property you’re transferring, you may also need 
new registration forms, signature cards, or other documents; the company 
where you’re transferring the property will provide the necessary forms.
Sign it Over: Giving the 
Trust Asset Ownership
When funding a trust during the grantor’s lifetime, you may be changing own-
ership of many types of property, from money, securities (stocks and bonds), 
and real estate to life insurance policies and all sorts of personal property. 
Basically, when you change the ownership of a piece of property to the trust, 
you’re transferring title from the grantor’s name to the name of the trustee. 
For instance, a bank account held in the name of James E. Jones is trans-
ferred to Martha A. Jones, Trustee of the James E. Jones Trust UTA (under 
trust agreement) dtd. 02/11/08.
No matter the type of property, you must document all transfers from the 
grantor to the trust. This section highlights the different types of property 
that can be transferred and how you can address each kind.
Cash and securities
Although all sorts of assets can be held in trust, cash and securities are two 
assets commonly used to initially fund the trust. And with the advent of tech-
nology, funding the trust with cash and securities is quick and easy.

161
 Chapter 11: Funding the Trust
Funding with cash and securities is as old as the hills; what’s changed is 
exactly how it’s done. The days of someone handing you a folder filled with 
stock certificates are largely gone, replaced by securities held in so-called 
street or nominee name, where your record of ownership is maintained either 
by the company who issued the shares or bonds, or by a brokerage firm 
or bank. And, even though cash (and checks) haven’t entirely gone by the 
wayside (one of us once had someone hand her a $10,000 cashier’s check to 
fund a trust), sending large sums over the Federal Reserve wires is far more 
common.
 
After the new custodian(s) for the property have assured you that they’ve 
received all the assets, double-check to make sure that all the assets have 
left the first custodian and arrived safe and sound at the second. The transfer 
often takes more than one try to get right. In fact, one of us was involved in a 
trust where one $500,000 bond took a three-year long detour into never-never 
land. Follow up on your transfers (on both ends) with phone calls, but always 
ask for an account statement or some other written evidence that the prop-
erty is where it should be and that it’s been correctly titled.
 
You may transfer cash and securities in the following ways, depending on how 
the assets are held to start with and where you want them to end up.
Transfers within the same financial institution
If the cash or securities being transferred are already in the hands of a finan-
cial institution in street name and you’re changing only the ownership regis-
tration, all you have to do is set up new accounts (to hold cash, securities, or 
both) in the name of the trust. The bank or brokerage will provide you with 
the necessary paperwork, such as account applications, signature cards, and 
Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification. 
After the paperwork is complete, the grantor can initiate the transfer of the 
property into the trust’s account.
Transfers from one financial institution to another
If you’re moving the cash or securities from one financial institution to 
another and need to change the ownership registration, you still need to 
complete the same documentation and account opening forms as with trans-
fers within the same bank or brokerage firm. However, the whole process just 
takes longer because in our experience the institution losing the property 
drags its feet because it doesn’t want to lose that business and the fee it gen-
erates. Make sure that the current institution gets the grantor’s letters direct-
ing the transfer (certified or registered mail is the way to go here), and then 
follow up with phone calls.

162
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
You can speed the process along if you obtain cash wire-transfer information 
from the receiving institution and pass it along to the sending one. And don’t 
forget to get the new custodian’s delivery instructions, or the specific rout-
ing and account numbers for the new custodian’s receiving account, for any 
stocks and bonds you’re having transferred. Just be sure that you carefully 
copy down what you’re told and review the instructions with the new custo-
dian for accuracy before you send them along to the old custodian.
Reregistering stock and bond certificates
Although we definitely don’t recommend it, sometimes you’re faced with no 
alternative but to hold physical certificates, which you’ll recognize by the 
heavy paper, fancy designs, and colored inks. The simplest way to change the 
registration on them is to reregister the securities from the grantor’s name 
into the name of the trust. The following are a couple of important points to 
keep in mind when reregistering certificates:
 
✓ The grantor must mail the physical certificates back to the issuing com-
pany with his or her written instructions.
 
✓ In a separate envelope, the grantor should mail stock powers, each of which 
includes the grantor’s name, the company name, the number of shares (or 
face value of the bond), and the new owner’s name. Stock powers must be 
signed by the grantor and typically also require a signature guarantee, or a 
stamp or seal from a commercial bank or stock brokerage.
The company will cancel the old certificates and issue new ones. If you have 
a lot of stock powers to prepare, you can get pads of blank powers from your 
local legal stationery store or get one blank form and make photocopies.
 
Although transferring securities from the grantor into the trust isn’t rocket 
science, it does require that you move carefully and methodically. Here are a 
few suggestions:
 
✓ Use registered mail when transferring physical securities. You want a 
record that you sent them, and an acknowledgment of receipt.
 
✓ Never sign a blank stock power. Put that together with a stock certifi-
cate registered to the power’s signer, and you’ve just put what is essen-
tially cash into an envelope; anyone can walk away with it.
 
✓ Never sign the stock power located on the back of the stock certifi-
cate. Always use a separate document, and make sure that you mail it 
(registered) in a different envelope than the stock certificate.
 
✓ Keep all stock and bond certificates locked safely away in a safe deposit 
box until you need them. These documents are sometimes extremely 
valuable (worth far more than the paper they’re printed on) and replacing 
lost, stolen, or destroyed certificates is costly and time consuming. If you 
need to reference what’s on these certificates, photocopy them and place 
the copies in a file, keeping the originals locked away.

163
 Chapter 11: Funding the Trust
If you’ve just finished reregistering physical securities, and are in possession 
of all the replacement certificates, you may want to move them into street 
name by opening a securities account with a bank or a brokerage. The bank 
or broker can help you fill out any forms to make that change. After the trans-
fer into street name is complete, your job becomes much simpler because 
interest and dividends are paid directly into your account, and you needn’t 
deposit a multitude of sometimes-miniscule checks.
Privately held stocks, promissory notes, 
and limited partnership interests
Many grantors set up trusts with the intention of funding them with non-
publicly traded securities, such as “S” corporation stocks, promissory notes, 
and limited partnership interests. Grantors do this to avoid probate issues 
and maintain privacy, in the case of revocable trusts (trusts the grantor cre-
ates and funds during lifetime to avoid probate, but not intended to remove 
the items from the grantor’s taxable estate; see Chapter 3), or to remove 
items that have the potential for vast increases in worth over time from their 
estates and estate tax returns.
 
Whatever the reason, moving these types of assets from personal ownership 
into a trust is a reasonably simple matter. What’s important is that you care-
fully document the transfer’s completion. That is, make sure that you have 
something in writing showing the stock certificate in the trustee’s name, or the 
assignment of the promissory note to the trustee, or the limited partnership 
interest in the trustee’s name. The typical way to hold title in trust name is 
as follows: X (and Y, if there are two trustees), Trustees of the JJD Trust, UTA 
dtd. 02/11/08. UTA stands for under trust agreement, and dtd. is the traditional 
abbreviation for dated in this context. Slight variations on this wording are 
acceptable.
 
Check out the following to determine what you need to do to change owner-
ship for these three types of property:
 
✓ Privately held stock: With this stock, such as stock in family corpora-
tions (including “S” corporations), follow the guidelines in the preced-
ing section for reregistering stock certificates. Complete separate stock 
powers, which are necessary even though signature guarantees typically 
aren’t. And remember, you can’t register privately held stock in street 
name, so the corporate clerk, secretary, or the corporation’s attorney 
must type up new stock certificates in the name of the trust.
 
✓ Promissory notes: A grantor may lend money to a third party and decide 
to place the promissory note into the trust. He or she may transfer the 
note to the trust by executing an assignment of the note to the trustees. 
It’s a simple document, but case specific. You can ask whoever drew up 
the note to draft the assignment. The grantor may transfer it to preserve 

164
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
privacy, to remove the note from the probate estate, or to make a non-
cash contribution. After all, the money has already been lent; even though 
the piece of paper showing the loan represents real value, the cash has 
already left the building. When the grantor assigns the note to the trust, 
the grantor must notify the borrower to make future payments of princi-
pal and interest directly.
 
✓ Non-publicly traded limited partnerships: These are a popular way of 
owning real estate with a group of like-minded investors. To transfer 
a limited partnership interest into a trust, the grantor must notify the 
general partner (the partner who’s running the partnership) of his or her 
intent, in writing. An assignment of partnership interest is a more formal 
way to accomplish the transfer, but a letter signed and dated by the 
owner of the interest should work. The general partner will then change 
the records of the partnership. Stay on top of this transaction. Keep 
after that general partner until he shows you that the records of the 
partnership have been changed to reflect your transfer to the trustee(s) 
of the trust.
Real estate
Depending on what state real property (real estate) is located in, transferring 
real estate into trust can be quite simple. The following should happen:
Step one: The grantor transfers the property’s title
The grantor transfers title in the property either directly to the trust, or in 
some states, to a nominee partnership. A nominee partnership is an entity 
that acts as owner of the property on behalf of the trustee (to avoid the 
necessity of recording the trust instrument in the registry of deeds and turn-
ing it into a public record).
By executing a new deed to the property and filing it with the appropriate 
government office, the grantor completes the transfer in most cases. This 
new deed is sometimes referred to as a grant deed, quitclaim deed, or war-
ranty deed, depending on what level of protections exist within the deed to 
safeguard the owner’s interest and on what state houses the real estate. The 
new deed usually goes to the local Registry of Deeds or its equivalent; in the 
case of registered land, which exists only in certain states, the deed goes to 
the local land court to complete the transfer.
 
In some states that limit property tax increases to an annual percentage, trans-
ferring real estate may force the property’s reappraisal and trigger large prop-
erty tax increases. Check the rules in your state prior to making the transfer. 
After the transfer is complete, you can’t change your mind.

165
 Chapter 11: Funding the Trust
Step two: You draft a new deed
If you have the original deed, drafting a new deed is easy. Simply copy the 
old one in all respects except for changing the names of the parties (and, 
depending on state law, using a quitclaim deed form rather than a warranty 
deed, because it’s a gift). For example, on the new deed, the name of the 
grantor replaces the name of the person the grantor originally acquired the 
property from, and the name(s) of the trust or trustee(s) replaces the name 
of the grantor on the old deed. Depending on state laws, you may need to 
specify the trustee capacity of the trustees; for instance, the new deed may 
name “James Doe, Trustee, and his successors, of the John Smith Irrevocable 
Trust.”
You must also check on what, if any, constitutes the standard consideration 
(money and/or other factors that induce the grantor to execute, or sign, the 
deed) in your state in the case of a gift. On the new deed, the consideration 
may be worded something like “for $1 and other good and valuable consider-
ation.” Even though the transfer is a gift, most states require that some con-
sideration be stated on the deed.
If you don’t have the original deed, go to the local register of deeds office 
where the real estate is located and ask how you can best locate the record 
of that deed. If you aren’t up to going through their dusty old books, or you 
aren’t nearby, you can hire someone to do a title search for you. You can 
likely get a name at the Registry of Deeds.
 
If an attorney didn’t prepare the deed, have one review the deed before sign-
ing; you don’t want to mess up the deed. A problem with the deed can affect 
clear title (no legal questions as to ownership) to the property.
Step three: The grantor signs the new deed
The grantor signs the new deed in the presence of a notary public, 
who affixes his or her official seal (and, in some states, two witnesses). 
Requirements regarding additional witnesses vary by state; the original deed 
that you copied from will show how many witnesses your state requires. 
Record the new deed with the Registry of Deeds or the land court to com-
plete the transfer. 
 
Some real estate is encumbered by a mortgage, and banks and mortgage 
companies don’t look kindly on you transferring property in which they 
hold a secured interest. Don’t attempt to transfer mortgaged property from 
the grantor into the trust without first obtaining the mortgage company’s 
approval, in writing. The mortgage company may well be congenial to the 
transfer, but it will require you, as trustee, to assume the grantor’s mortgage. 
It will undoubtedly have documents that you must complete, sign, have nota-
rized, and record along with the new deed.

166
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Step four: After the trust owns the real estate, you, as trustee, 
assume all responsibility for the property
After the trust officially becomes the owner of the real estate, you, the 
trustee, assume all the responsibilities for that property. Don’t forget to pay 
the mortgage, if you have one, or the real estate taxes. And absolutely don’t 
forget to insure it, and be sure that your name as trustee is on the insurance 
as an insured. If you have a mortgage on the property, the mortgage company 
will be certain to remind you, but when you own that property free and clear, 
it’s sometimes easy to let certain things slide. Of course, should the property 
be damaged, or should someone be injured on the trust’s property, you as 
trustee may well be held liable if you’ve failed to adequately insure it.
Life insurance policies
Life insurance policies come in many flavors, and they guarantee a reason-
ably large cash payout down the road for a relatively small investment now. 
A life insurance policy can fund a trust that eventually creates some available 
cash for future expenditures, such as anticipated estate taxes. No matter 
what type, life insurance policies may be acquired by a trust in two ways: The 
trustee may purchase a policy on the life of the grantor, or the grantor may 
transfer ownership of an existing policy into the trust.
Because life insurance trusts are generally not funded with large amounts of 
cash or securities, the grantor typically makes a large enough gift into the 
trust each year to pay the annual premium and any fees and expenses the 
trust may incur. The sole asset in the trust (other than small amounts of cash 
or money market funds) is the insurance owned by the trust on the grantor’s 
life. When the grantor dies, the face value of the policy pays into the trust, 
bypassing the grantor’s estate entirely.
The following sections outline the two ways a trust can acquire a life insur-
ance policy.
Policies purchased by the trustee
When you, the trustee, purchase life insurance on the life of the grantor, 
you’re responsible for contacting an insurance broker and negotiating the 
terms of the policy. You’ll typically only be doing this if the trust was set 
up as a vehicle to own life insurance (for instance, a Crummey Trust; see 
Chapter 3). Of course, if you’re not an expert on life insurance, you’ll want a 
third party looking over your shoulder. Some attorneys who work with life 
insurance trusts have become quite expert at analyzing the benefits of vari-
ous insurance policies. And you’ll want a highly recommended insurance 
broker. In addition to relying on friends’ and family’s recommendations, check 
with your state’s Secretary of State, who licenses insurance brokers, to make 
sure that the broker you choose has no black marks on his or her record.

167
 Chapter 11: Funding the Trust
As part of the underwriting process, the grantor may be required to take an 
insurance-company physical so that the insurance company can determine 
premiums based on the state of the grantor’s health.
Policies gifted into trust by the grantor
Sometimes, the grantor makes a gift of an existing insurance policy into the 
trust. It could be a policy on which premiums are still being paid or it could 
be a paid-up policy, where all the premiums have been paid and the policy 
remains in force until the grantor’s death. In either case, an existing policy 
is an excellent candidate for transfer to the trust because, should the policy 
remain in the grantor’s hands until death, its face value would be included in 
the gross estate (see Chapters 16 and 17), and a large percentage of the pro-
ceeds from the policy would go to pay estate taxes.
To transfer a life insurance policy into the trust, the grantor must complete 
and sign an assignment or transfer of policy. Be certain to obtain Form 712, 
Life Insurance Statement, from the insurance company at the time the 
grantor makes the transfer. The value on Form 712 is the value the grantor 
declares on his or her Form 709, United States Gift (and Generation-
Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, if any is required.
By gifting the policy to the trust, the grantor limits the includable value on 
his or her estate tax return to the value as of the date of the gift, not the pol-
icy’s face value. And because no policy prior to the insured’s death is worth 
much in comparison to its value after that death, making this transfer now 
saves tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in eventual taxes if the 
grantor has a taxable estate.
 
After the transfer, it’s up to you, as trustee, to make sure that the endorsements 
on the policy (that list information like whose life is being insured, who owns 
the policy, and who gets the money when the insured dies) are changed. You 
need to be certain that the trust is not only named as the owner but is also 
designated as the beneficiary. For instance, the new ownership and beneficiary 
designation should now read something like this: “John Q. Doe and Thomas H. 
Doe, Trustees, and their successors, of the John M. Smith Irrevocable Trust, 
under trust agreement dated 02/11/08.” And don’t forget to pay those annual 
premiums if the policy isn’t paid up. Be sure that you have cash in advance of 
the payment date every year (from the grantor) to pay the premiums. For a 
Crummey Trust, you need to send Crummey notice letters to the beneficiaries 
while the cash is in the trust and before the premium is paid (see Chapter 3).
 
Frequently, transfers into irrevocable life insurance trusts (whether cash for 
premiums or policies with cash value) trigger the need for the grantor to file 
Form 709, for each year that he or she makes transfers into the trust in excess 
of the annual exclusion ($12,000 in 2008). 

168
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Personal and household property in trust
If the grantor has established a revocable trust (see Chapter 3 for more info), 
he or she can transfer some or all of his or her personal and household items 
into the trust by means of a one page declaration, notarized and witnessed. 
Figure 11-1 shows a sample that’s been successful in avoiding probate.
Eyeing the types of life insurance available
All life insurance policies contain an element 
of term insurance, or pure insurance that pro-
vides coverage for a set period and builds no 
cash value. Failure to pay scheduled premiums 
causes the policy to lapse, usually 30 days after 
the due date of the missed premium. Besides 
term insurance, here are some other types of 
life insurance you may encounter:
 ✓ Whole life: Combining term life coverage 
with a modest investment motive. Generally, 
whole life remains the same, year after year, 
with a portion of the premium paying for 
term coverage. The remainder is invested 
by the insurance company, and provides 
the policy owner (that’s the trust) with a 
stated rate of return. Policies build cash 
value, so should you decide to terminate 
the policy prior to the death of the insured, 
you’re entitled to a return of any cash value 
accumulated within the policy. At the death 
of the insured, the policy pays the face 
value, but any cash value existing prior to 
death is erased. Should you fail to pay a 
premium, the cash value continues making 
premium payments until it’s exhausted. Only 
after cash value has been exhausted does 
the policy lapse.
 ✓ Variable universal life: Similar to whole 
life, except the cash value in the variable 
universal life policy may be invested by 
you in a variety of mutual funds offered by 
the insurance company. When the stock 
market does well, the policy’s cash value 
increases; when the stock market performs 
poorly, so does the policy’s cash value. Like 
the whole life policy, the face value of the 
policy is paid into the trust when the insured 
dies. Missed premium payments are made 
with the existing cash value until it’s gone, 
and then the policy lapses.
 ✓ Single premium life: The one-payment plan, 
single premium life lives up to its name. The 
insured purchases a policy with one giant 
premium payment, which the insurance 
company calculates based on the insured’s 
health and age. Be cautious of single pre-
mium life — although insurance companies 
market this plan as “one payment covers 
you forever,” they may run through the pool 
of available cash quicker than planned if 
they invest poorly, and come back to you 
years later looking for additional premiums, 
and if you don’t pony up, the policy lapses.

Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
If the grantor has funded an irrevocable trust (a trust that can’t be changed 
or revoked by the grantor; check out Chapter 3), he or she definitely doesn’t 
want to include household and personal property (except for, possibly, items 
that have the possibility of increasing in value greatly during the grantor’s 
lifetime, such as artwork by a well-known living artist who’s in poor health). 
Remember, transfers into an irrevocable trust mean the grantor is giving up all 
right, title, and interest in the property. If that property remains in the grant-
or’s house, and the grantor continues to use it, the IRS would be well within its 
rights to question the validity of the transfer and disallow the gift.
Rolling Property into Trust after Death
Often, trusts are created during the grantor’s lifetime, but they aren’t funded 
until after the grantor dies. If you’re a trustee of a trust where the grantor has 
died and you need to fund the trust, you have
 
✓ To assist the executor of the estate in making an orderly transfer of 
assets into the trust. Usually, when trusts are funded only after death, 
the majority of assets flow through the decedent’s estate. Probate assets 
must go through the probate process (see Chapter 6), all debts of the 
decedent and the estate must be paid (including all estate taxes), and 
all legacies and bequests must be honored prior to making distribution 
from the estate into the trust.
 
✓ To identify any assets that became payable to the trust directly upon 
the grantor’s death, such as insurance policies owned by the grantor 
with the trust named as beneficiary. Chapter 8 tells you what you need 
to know (and what to look for in the decedent’s Last Will) to determine 
whether this trust should be funded with specific assets, a specific 
dollar amount, or with a percentage of the assets. You may also find 
guidance as to whether to include or exclude certain property from the 
funding.
Be careful when funding a trust: Not all available property is eligible. You 
may not fund a trust with the decedent’s 401(k) plan, for example. Very often, 
the estate is clearly more than large enough to fund the trust even after 
all other obligations are met. In that case, you (together with the estate’s 
executor) may decide to partially fund the trust earlier than you have to so 
that trust beneficiaries who may be relying on trust income for their living 
expenses may begin receiving distributions. Early funding of the trust must 
be done with the absolute understanding between the trustee and the execu-
tor, in writing, that the trust will honor any financial obligations the estate 
can’t meet.

Investing the Trust’s Assets and 
Paying Its Expenses
In This Chapter
▶ Figuring out how to differentiate between income and principal
▶ Choosing investment advisors
▶ Understanding diversification
▶ Investing in a socially responsible way
▶ Using trust assets to adequately provide for beneficiaries’ needs
▶ Knowing which expenses you can and can’t pay from the trust
U
nlike an estate, a trust is an ongoing endeavor, and its lifetime may 
well be longer than yours. Your duty as trustee is to manage the trust’s 
assets to ensure that the trust’s beneficiaries will have adequate funds when 
they need (or are entitled to) money. Your goal is to see that the asset base 
grows, not to keep it the same or see that it shrinks.
In order to make your tenure as trustee a successful one, this chapter 
explains what you need to know about separating principal from income. It 
also shows some basic investment options, some of which you may decide 
to use to invest the trust assets and others of which you may think aren’t for 
you, at least not now. The beauty of being trustee, as opposed to executor, 
is that yours tends to be more of a long-term role, so you have the option of 
investing one way now and then changing it up later if it’s not working the 
way you want. Whichever you decide, remember that your goal isn’t just to 
preserve the assets but also to put them to work for the benefit of the benefi-
ciaries and the remaindermen.

Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Eyeing the Importance of Income and 
Principal in Trust Administration
Picture a trust as two boxes. In one box, you keep all the property that’s 
available to produce ordinary income like dividends, interest, or rents. When 
that income is earned, it goes into the second box. As you make payments, 
some may come out of either box depending on what you (the trustee) 
decides; others, such as beneficiary payments, come only from the income 
box, assuming it has income in it. Knowing how to differentiate what belongs 
in the principal box from what should be in the income box is one of the 
trickiest concepts to grasp in trust administration.
To help you get a firm grasp on principal and income, this section gives you 
a clear definition of each and explains why and how you can differentiate 
between the two to help you manage your trust.
 
Being able to allocate money to either the income or principal sides of a trust 
is a key element in successful trust administration because the people who 
are entitled to receive income may not be the same people entitled to receive 
the principal when the trust terminates. One of your many jobs as trustee is to 
make sure that you don’t favor the income interest over the principal interest, 
or vice versa. You must be fair and equitable to both.
Defining principal and income
Defining principal is quite easy. Principal, sometimes referred to as the corpus 
or body, of the trust, is the property that the trust owns. Principal may include 
cash, but it may also be stocks, bonds, real estate, business interests, country 
club memberships, or season tickets to the Met. In fact, anything that the trust 
can be said to own is principal. Although trust principal starts with the assets 
that originally fund the trust (see Chapter 11), it may increase or decrease when 
the sale of trust property creates capital gains or losses; when the grantor makes 
additional contributions to the trust; when the trust receives a settlement or 
judgment as a party in a lawsuit; or even when you transfer into principal any 
accumulated income that’s not required to go to an income beneficiary.
 
Principal in a trust can shape-shift without ceasing to be principal. A common 
misconception is that when you sell an asset, the cash proceeds that you 
receive become available to pay the income beneficiary. After all, if you sell 
something in your personal finances, you can use the cash you receive to pay 
any of your bills. But that’s not the case in a trust, where the cash received 
from the sale of any asset still remains a principal asset, albeit in a different 
form. So in the hands of the trust, stock worth $100 is the same as the $100 
cash it receives from the sale of that stock, which is the same as the $100 of 
different stock that the trust turned around and purchased with the cash.

173
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
As for income, the definition is extremely simple. Almost everything earned 
by the principal of the trust is income. So stock dividends, interest earned 
on bank accounts or bonds, rents from real estate owned by the trust, and 
earnings received from a business the trust owns all constitute income of the 
trust. In fact, if you receive a payment of any sort and you’re not sure where 
it belongs, you’re probably safe in depositing it to the income side of the 
trust, with a few exceptions we outline in the next section.
Understanding the distinction 
between the two
A great deal of your success as a trustee lies in your ability to determine 
what’s principal and what’s income. Your assignment of all receipts to either 
the income or principal side of the trust dictates how you calculate trust 
accounting income, an amount that determines how much money the income 
beneficiary is entitled to receive. By understanding the difference between 
the two sides of the trust and applying your knowledge, you can give the 
income beneficiary the amount he or she is due (or something close — much 
of the equation is based on your best judgment as trustee) and hopefully 
keep everyone happy.
So why does making the distinction between principal and income sometimes 
seem so difficult? Well, not every type of principal or receipt of income is 
straightforward, and sometimes figuring out what you have can be perplex-
ing. The largest exception to the income/principal distinction is how you 
classify capital gains and losses. Capital gains occur when you sell a piece 
of property for more than your acquisition cost (either because the trust 
purchased the property or because it received the property from the grantor 
or the grantor’s estate as a part of the trust’s initial funding). See Chapter 11 
for more info. Capital losses, on the other hand, are what you get when you 
sell property for less than your acquisition cost. Whether the trust generates 
gains (hopefully) or losses (not too often, but sometimes unavoidable), those 
gains and losses stay on the principal side of the trust.
 
You also need to be aware of two other tricky types of principal payments you 
may receive on account of trust assets. Those two types are
 
✓ Return of capital: When you receive a return of capital, the company 
that has issued this payment has essentially determined that some 
part of what you owned no longer exists, and so they issue payments 
that reduce your acquisition cost. To the extent that you still have an 
acquisition amount for that particular piece of property, you reduce 
that amount by the return of capital, record any cash you receive on the 
principal side of the trust, and don’t recognize income of any sort. For 
example, QZW Corp, which you purchased for $10 per share, later sells 
off one wicket-manufacturing plant. It sends you a check for $3 per share 

174
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
as the proceeds from the sale of the wicket-manufacturing plant as a 
return of capital. Your new acquisition cost in QZW Corp is now $7 per 
share ($10 original purchase price – $3 return of capital), and you have 
no capital gain or loss on the transaction.
 
✓ Special or extraordinary dividends: With a special or extraordinary 
dividend, on the other hand, the corporation has issued a larger than 
ordinary slice of the corporate profits. These extraordinary dividends 
are typically allocated to the principal side of the trust, because their 
payment almost always causes the share price of the stock to drop 
by at least the amount of the dividend. For example, in November 2004, 
Microsoft issued a $3.00 per share extraordinary dividend, as opposed 
to its quarterly $0.08 per share dividend. Not so coincidentally, Microsoft’s 
share price dropped that very day by almost exactly the same amount 
as the dividend. Unlike the return of capital, an extraordinary dividend 
doesn’t reduce the trust’s acquisition cost.
 
If you understand the distinction between income and principal, you should 
have no difficulty in correctly allocating payments such as returns of capital 
or extraordinary dividends; however, sometimes the company itself isn’t clear 
on how it should categorize these payments until long after it has actually 
made the payments. If the correspondence you receive from the company is 
confusing (and we’ve read more than our share that boggles the mind), you 
may want to check in with a tax professional who can help walk you through 
the correct application of the payment.
 
Most trust instruments include a provision that states that the final determina-
tion of what’s principal and what’s income rests with the trustee. Trust admin-
istration isn’t a precise practice, and the lines between principal and income 
sometimes blur. If you’re not sure what something is, you may want to seek 
professional advice from an accountant, enrolled agent, or attorney who spe-
cializes in trusts.
Using Investment Advisors Effectively
Investment advisors can make your life as trustee easier. They spend 100 
percent of their professional time researching companies and reading bal-
ance sheets and annual reports. Their job is to be on top of whatever type of 
investment they specialize in so that you don’t have to. Check out Chapter 4 
for some of the different types of advisors available to you and how to select 
one or more.
In fact, both of us would most definitely choose to use investment advisors 
for trusts we were responsible for. Although we’re both extremely compe-
tent in lots of areas of trust and estate administration, neither of us want to 
have the absolute decision of what to buy and sell (and when) resting on our 
heads.

175
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
 
Your job is to be very specific as to what your expectations are when hiring an 
investment advisor. When hiring an advisor, keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ Set boundaries. If you don’t give an advisor parameters, you’re giving 
too much responsibility to someone whose loyalty to you extends 
no farther than the size of the fee you’re paying. You can reasonably 
assume that the advisor probably doesn’t want to lose your business, 
but unless you show them otherwise, they’ll probably assume that you 
have no idea what they’re doing, won’t be able to read their reports, and 
won’t bother to ask questions.
 
✓ Make sure that you get the right kind of advisor for your trust. Not 
all advisors specialize in all types of investments. You can find advi-
sors for every type of investment and combination of types (balanced 
investments that produce income as well as capital gains, for example). 
If you’re looking for income production but aren’t too bothered if you 
don’t see huge capital gains in the account, you want an advisor who 
specializes in fixed income securities (bonds). Perhaps the trust doesn’t 
yet have an active income beneficiary, and all the income is accumulat-
ing in the trust. In that case, you may be more likely to want an advisor 
who specializes in growth companies, which usually pay a very small 
dividend (if they pay one at all) and concentrate on increasing the size 
and value of the company.
 
✓ Don’t limit yourself to one advisor. You may need only one advisor, 
or you may want more than one. If the trust is large, you may not want 
to put all your eggs in one basket with one advisor. And if you sense 
you’re not getting the service or results you require or want from any 
particular advisor, don’t hesitate to take the trust away from him or her. 
Remember, it’s not his or her money, so he or she has very little at stake 
(other than loss of fee income). You, on the other hand, have to answer 
to the income beneficiaries and the remaindermen (the people or organi-
zations who receive whatever’s left in the trust after the income benefi-
ciary’s interest ends).
 
✓ Remain in close communication with the advisor. Any investment advi-
sor worth his or her salt sends monthly or quarterly reports. Read them 
carefully. Although he or she works for you, money often leads people to 
behave badly, and these advisors have access to lots of it. If something 
doesn’t look quite right to you, such as fees that seem high or huge num-
bers of purchases and/or sales, often for very small numbers of shares 
of stock in the same companies, ask questions. If you’re not absolutely 
satisfied with the answers, ask for an opinion from a professional you 
trust (perhaps an attorney, an accountant, an enrolled agent, or even 
another investment person such as a stockbroker) and have him or her 
give the report the hairy eyeball. If anything is fishy there, any of these 
people should be able to smell it.

176
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Holding and Diversifying Assets
As trustee, you’re responsible for investing the trust property. Although you 
may have your hands tied by a trust instrument that dictates that you hold 
onto certain property the grantor has given to the trust, most trusts give the 
trustee investment control over at least some assets. Your job is to invest it 
conservatively but broadly, giving that principal a chance to grow. Depending 
on the powers given to you by the grantor under the terms of the trust instru-
ment, how you go about your task is up to you.
For example, one of us once administered a trust (but, thank goodness, 
wasn’t the trustee) that held a million or so shares of the family business. 
It just so happened that the family business was a very successful publicly 
traded corporation, and that those million shares produced a large enough 
dividend to keep the income beneficiary comfortable for his entire life. That 
said, though, by not selling those shares and investing in a broader way 
in the stock and bond markets, the trustee left himself open to all sorts of 
charges of malfeasance (trustee misconduct). Basically, the trustee hadn’t 
done his job, and the result for the trust, the income beneficiary, and the 
remaindermen could have been disastrous if that family corporation had 
fallen on hard times, or even gone bankrupt. Think of Enron and its pension 
plan members, who were only invested in Enron stock.
This section explains the different types of assets that you may be responsi-
ble for as a trustee and, where appropriate, what you must do to ensure that 
they’re diversified.
Stocks
Investing in the stock market is one of the most popular ways to get trust 
principal working for you and producing income for the trust’s income ben-
eficiaries. Stocks (sometimes referred to as equities), are ownership interests 
in corporations. As a partial owner in a corporation, the trust is entitled to a 
share in the corporate profits, which are paid as dividends (usually quarterly 
but sometimes as often as monthly or as infrequently as annually).
 
In order to diversify the trust’s stocks, the trust needs to invest in a broad 
range of companies, covering all the major areas of the stock market: from 
manufacturing to transportation to all forms of medical services and products 
to commodities such as oil and gas. And in this increasingly international age, 
you don’t want to focus only on U.S. companies; rather, consider casting your 
net worldwide. Some experts say that an adequately diverse portfolio should 
contain stocks in no fewer than 75 corporations; others raise that number 
to 140 or more. If you’re investing a relatively small amount of money, you can 

177
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
circumvent the necessity of buying tiny amounts of stocks in so many com-
panies by investing instead in one or more broad-based mutual funds, which 
themselves own shares in many, many corporations. Just be sure to read the 
prospectuses (the brochures that every fund has detailing the rules governing 
the fund and listing a sample investment portfolio in the fund) first, before you 
invest, so that you understand exactly what it is you’re buying. Head to the 
section entitled, “Mutual funds,” later in the chapter for more information.
You don’t necessarily need to buy stock in corporations that pay regular divi-
dends. Some very fine corporations never or only rarely pay any dividend. 
As trustee, you’re on safe ground investing in a non-dividend paying corpora-
tion, provided you can see the potential for growth in that company. As a cor-
poration’s value grows, the trust (as a partial owner of that entity) is entitled 
to a share of that growth. As long as the trust continues to own shares, the 
corporation’s increased value translates to an increased market value for the 
shares you own. When you sell those shares, the money you receive for them 
should exceed what you paid for them, giving you a capital gain.
Bonds
Bonds are pieces of loans, packaged by a corporation or a government as 
investment product. When you purchase a bond, you’re purchasing a piece 
of someone else’s debt. In exchange for the money you’re indirectly lending, 
that debtor agrees to pay you interest. Bonds are sometimes referred to as 
fixed-income securities, because the income that they generate for the trust is 
tied to the stated interest rate on the bond. You’ll receive no more interest 
than what’s stated, and hopefully, no less.
 
When investing in bonds, you’re typically looking to produce a steady stream 
of income for the income beneficiary. One of most effective ways to achieve 
that goal is by laddering the maturity dates of the bonds you buy so that 
bonds mature in sequence, rather than all at once. For example, you may buy 
one bond that matures in 2009, one in 2010, one in 2011, and so on. By ladder-
ing bond maturities, you cushion the income beneficiary from huge drops in 
his or her income at times when income rates plummet.
 
Different income beneficiaries have different needs. Some require as much 
income as you can squeeze out of the trust’s principal; others want whatever 
income they receive to be tax exempt. Still others are best served by a com-
bination of approaches. The most common types of bonds and what they can 
offer both the trust and the beneficiary are as follows:
 
✓ Corporate: Issued by corporations, these bonds generally carry some 
of the highest interest rates available. The interest earned is taxable at 
both the federal and state level.

178
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
✓ Foreign: Other countries borrow money, too, and foreign bonds can be 
very attractive to investors. If you feel so inclined, or your investment 
advisor thinks that foreign bonds are a good, safe place for some of the 
trust’s principal, you should consider sticking a toe in this water. What 
can complicate foreign bonds somewhat is that they’re typically sold 
in foreign currencies (and pay interest that way, too). Although your 
brokerage can handle all the currency exchange issues, your return on 
investment isn’t just dictated by the stated interest rate (which doesn’t 
change) but also by currency exchange rates (which do fluctuate). 
Interest on foreign bonds is taxable at both the federal and state levels.
 
✓ Municipal: Issued by states, cities, and towns, these bonds carry lower 
interest rates because they’re exempt from federal income tax, and 
depending on what state(s) the trust and trust beneficiary pay income 
tax to, they may also be state income tax free.
 
✓ U.S. Government: Not to be confused with U.S. Treasury obligations, 
U.S. Government bonds are the debts of U.S. governmental agencies, 
such as GNMA (U.S. Government National Mortgage Association, in case 
you were wondering). These bonds typically pay a slightly higher inter-
est rate than U.S. Treasury obligations, but interest from them is income 
taxable at both the federal and state levels.
 
✓ U.S. Treasury: The safest of all safe investments, these bonds are backed 
by the full faith and credit of the United States Treasury. We’re talking 
Fort Knox stuff here — if you can’t sleep at night because you’re worrying 
about how secure the trust’s principal is, you don’t get any safer than U.S. 
Treasury obligations. In exchange for lending money to the U.S. Treasury, 
it pays you interest and as an added bonus, the interest is tax exempt in 
every state (so you pay only federal income tax).
 
Just as you may not consider loaning money to your shifty Cousin Norman, 
you may not want to lend the trust’s money to some corporations or munici-
palities with reputations for mishandling money or being perpetually in debt. 
How can you tell? If it seems too good to be true, it probably is; be very wary 
of bonds that promise extraordinarily high interest rates. Face it, if the corpo-
ration, city, or town could borrow money and pay less interest, wouldn’t they 
do so? These very high interest rate bonds are sometimes referred to as junk 
bonds or high-yield bonds. If you’re in a position where you need to generate a 
large amount of income for your income beneficiary, you may want to venture 
into this arena, but go very carefully. These bonds carry not only a high inter-
est rate but also a high rate of default. Remember, if the bond issuer defaults 
on the loan, not only do you not get your interest payments, but you’ve also 
just lost your principal investment.

179
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
 
If you’re not sure about a bond you’re considering purchasing, you may want 
to check that particular bond’s rating, which is essentially a grade assigned 
to that bond by the rating agencies. The two major agencies, Standard & 
Poor (S&P) and Moody’s Investor Services, assign ratings when a bond is first 
issued and then periodically review their ratings based on how the borrower 
is doing financially. You can phone Moody’s rating desk at 212-553-0377, or 
you can access Standard & Poor’s ratings by going to www.standardand
poors.com and then clicking on “Ratings”. For both services, you need the 
bond’s identifying number, a nine-digit alphanumeric identifier called its CUSIP 
Number, in order to check a specific bond. Every publicly traded security has 
a CUSIP Number; it’s listed on the face of the bond. If the broker holds the 
trust’s securities, the CUSIP Number appears on the original purchase confir-
mation or on your monthly or quarterly statement.
Grasping basic bond terminology
Investing in bonds can be one of the safest and 
easiest ways to invest, yet many people shy 
away from these investments because they 
may not understand all the words used in their 
descriptions. How is it possible to know exactly 
what you’re buying? Here’s a short course in 
Bond Terminology 101.
All bond descriptions carry certain required 
information that can tell you a great deal about 
what you’re buying. They should all have a 
face amount, which is nothing more than the 
amount of money the bond issuer promises to 
repay you when the bond matures. It also gives 
an issue date, or the date the loan was created, 
and a maturity date, or the date the loan will be 
repaid, plus the interest rate.
Bonds actually come in three varieties, based 
on how long you hold them. Bills are issued for 
a period of one year or less. Notes are issued 
for periods of less than ten years. Bonds are 
issued for periods of ten years or greater. Both 
bonds and notes are issued at their face value 
(you pay $100 for a $100 note) and pay interest 
semiannually based on the date of maturity, not 
the date of issue. Bills, on the other hand, are 
purchased at a discount (you pay $95 for a $100 
bill), and only pay interest at maturity, when you 
receive the full face value of the bill.
Some bonds are prerefunded. Even though 
they’re issued with a stated maturity date, the 
issuing authority has the option of paying off 
the loan early, at specified dates (the prerefund 
dates). Other bonds are convertible, which 
means the corporation may exchange them 
for its common or preferred stock at its own 
instigation. When corporations convert their 
bonds, bondholders always have the option to 
take cash rather than stock. Corporate bonds 
may also be subordinate, causing this particular 
bond issue to stand behind other debts of the 
corporation. In other words, if the corporation 
goes belly up, the subordinated bondholders 
don’t get any of their money back until other 
corporate debts are paid first.

Mutual funds
If buying individual stocks and/or bonds isn’t your cup of tea, because you’re 
unsure about what (and how much of any particular security) to buy, then 
you may want to consider investing the trust’s money in a mutual fund. 
Diversification is the name of the game with mutual funds. A mutual fund is 
something like a buying club, where a bunch of like-minded investors (like 
you) pool their money, hire an advisor, and allow the advisor to invest the 
pooled cash in a way that’s been determined by the investors. In exchange 
for the cash, the individual investors receive shares in the fund, not shares in 
the individual investments that are purchased and sold by the fund.
In fact, by their very nature, mutual funds are diverse and specialized. You 
can buy funds made up entirely of stocks or ones that only invest in bonds. 
You can purchase international funds, municipal bond funds, socially respon-
sible and green funds, and funds that specialize in transportation companies. 
If you want, you can even buy a fund that only invests in so-called sin stocks 
like tobacco, alcohol, and weapons manufacturers.
 
When diversifying a trust’s assets, mutual funds can be a very savvy trust 
investment. In exchange for the fees that every shareholder, either directly 
or indirectly, pays the fund manager, you receive expert advice as well as the 
potential for great diversification. In fact, you may become so caught up in 
picking and choosing mutual funds that you lose sight of your goal of diversi-
fying the trust’s principal and investing in all sectors of the economy. Before 
you invest in any mutual fund, check its prospectus very carefully to make 
sure that you understand what you’re buying. We’ve both been involved with 
trusts that relied heavily on mutual fund investing, where the funds over-
lapped so significantly that the trustees hadn’t really diversified the trust’s 
assets at all, although they thought they had.
 
Just make sure that you’re careful about the fund’s fees when investing the 
trust’s money in mutual funds. Funds are allowed to charge a variety of fees, 
including sales charges (sometimes referred to as a load), redemption fees, 
exchange fees, account fees, purchase fees, management fees, and/or distri-
bution (sometimes called service) fees. You can reasonably expect to pay a 
fee for having someone invest your money for you, but you need to figure out 
upfront how much of a fee you’re willing to pay. So-called no-load funds, which 
have no upfront or deferred sales charges, sound like a good deal, but make 
no mistake: Even no-load funds charge fees — you just may not be able to see 
them.

 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
Cash needs
As much as you want to maximize the income being earned by the trust’s 
principal, you need to keep some cash on hand at all times to meet not 
only the trust’s expected needs, like scheduled income distributions and 
quarterly estimated tax payments, but also unexpected expenses, such as 
unanticipated medical expenses for a beneficiary or larger-than-expected 
taxes for the trust. For example you never want to sell an investment right 
before the April 15 tax deadline in order to pay a tax bill because everyone 
else who owes taxes is facing the same tax deadline. Sales tend to flood the 
stock market around April 15 of every year, causing prices to plunge. Instead 
of selling when everyone else is, keep enough of a cushion of cash on hand in 
the trust to pay those bills when they roll around. And after you’ve paid your 
bills, make sure to replenish your cash stash — you never want to be caught 
short.
 
Cash on hand doesn’t need to sit in an account earning nothing. Plenty of 
lower-risk money market accounts pay you something on your deposits, even 
though it’s usually not enough to write home about. The money in the account 
remains very liquid, and you can pull it out at any time without a penalty when 
you need it. Every bank offers money market accounts, as do all mutual fund 
companies and stock brokerage firms. You’ll have no difficulty opening one 
of these accounts wherever you keep your assets, although you may want to 
shop slightly farther afield. Some of the highest interest rates paid are offered 
by Internet banks, which have no local branches and very few employees, 
keeping their costs low.
Real estate
Real estate may not be a typical trust investment, but it’s more common than 
you may think. Often, the grantor’s residence may end up in the trust, either 
during lifetime or after the grantor’s death. Or, the grantor may have held 
interests in either residential or commercial real estate, either outright, or 
through partnerships.
Dealing with real estate inside of a trust is really no different than dealing 
with it on a personal level, whether the trust owns the property the grantor’s 
family is still living in or you’re dealing with a trust version of Donald Trump 
with hotels, casinos, apartment houses, and shopping malls. The trust must 
pay the taxes, the insurance bill, and any other costs involved with the main-
tenance of that property.

182
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
The expenses involved with maintaining the grantor’s home aren’t always 
clear cut. If the family residence remains in trust while the family is still in resi-
dence, part of your job is determining which expenses the trust should and 
shouldn’t pay for. Mortgage payments, taxes, and insurance on the house itself 
clearly belong to you. You can also make a good case for lawn/garden care 
and trash and snow removal. If the house’s contents are trust property, you 
need to pick up that insurance tab as well. But be cautious about many of the 
other costs associated with running a house, such as utility payments and the 
housecleaner. Discuss with the family precisely what items the trust is respon-
sible for. Take into consideration what you think the grantor’s purpose was in 
placing the house into trust, and act accordingly. Failing to have a stated plan 
in place may leave you in the unenviable position of rejecting reimbursement 
for food, medical care, or even bills to have the dog groomed. Believe it or not, 
one of us had a trust beneficiary who steadfastly maintained that because the 
trust undertook to pay the cleaners and the dog’s hair increased the amount 
of cleaning to be done, the grooming bills actually should be paid by the trust.
Although the rules for owning real estate, including buying and selling, are 
the same for trusts as they are for individuals, two exceptions exist. Although 
individuals are entitled to a $250,000 capital gains exclusion for the sale of a 
personal residence (provided they’ve owned the house for at least two years 
and used it as a personal residence for two out of the last five years), trusts 
aren’t. On the other hand, if that same residence is sold at a loss, the trust is 
allowed to claim the loss on Schedule D of the trust’s Form 1041 because the 
house isn’t the trust’s personal residence.
Small business stocks
Whether a trust receives small business stock (stock from a closely held or 
non-publicly traded corporation) during the grantor’s lifetime or as part of the 
decedent’s estate rolled into the trust after death, you may find yourself hold-
ing a substantial interest in a small business on behalf of the trust. The trust’s 
grantor has hopefully prepared you for the receipt of this stock. Perhaps the 
trust’s share of the stock is part of the greater plan to transfer ownership to 
the next generation. Or you may have instructions to sell the stock (presum-
ably, in this case, because the grantor has buyers lined up and waiting).
 
If you, as trustee, find yourself holding shares in a small business, you’re not 
only allowed to participate in the business, but you’re also somewhat required 
to. Even if you don’t want to be involved in the day-to-day running, don’t be shy 
about asking to see financial reports and any other information the other owners 
may have regarding the company. Remember, one of your duties as trustee is to 
protect and conserve the assets of the trust. Even if you’re not in a position to 
man the store, be an active player in what goes on behind the scenes. Otherwise, 
you’ll have a difficult time justifying your care of the trust assets to the beneficia-
ries and/or remaindermen should the company go belly up.

183
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
If the company in question is an S Corporation, be sure that the trust is eli-
gible to be an S Corporation shareholder. Check out Chapter 3 for descrip-
tions of which trusts qualify either as a qualifying S Corporation shareholder 
(QSST) or as an electing small business trust (ESBT). And if you’re not sure, 
seek advice. Making a mistake here may have disastrous consequences not 
only for the trust but also for the corporation.
Going Green in a Trust
As trustee, you have the choice of investments. Even though many individu-
als are satisfied with selecting investments based purely on the balance 
sheets and potential for income generation of the companies involved, many 
trustees are starting to match their investment strategy to their, the grant-
or’s, and, in some cases, the beneficiary’s, personal philosophy. The result, 
socially responsible investing, is becoming more and more prevalent across all 
sectors of the investment community, and an increasing number of options 
are available to you accordingly.
 
Although you’re allowed to do whatever you want with your own money, you 
must invest the trust’s principal with a profit motive in mind. Even though no 
one can ever guarantee that an investment will provide x amount of income 
or increase in price by y, investing always carries the presumption of making 
money. Remember, so long as a socially responsible corporation or mutual 
fund can show that it’s acting to produce a profit, you’re okay in putting trust 
money there. But if the company is merely concerned with doing good in the 
world and not with producing profits for its shareholders, you’re required 
to keep your trustee hands in your trustee pockets no matter how much you 
want to applaud its good work.
Socially responsible investing has been around for a long time in this coun-
try, but it’s really become popular only since the late 1980s. As a result of the 
increased interest, you can now invest in socially responsible mutual funds. 
Many major mutual fund companies offer them alongside all their other 
funds; a couple of companies offer only socially responsible funds. The fol-
lowing sections highlight ways you can invest the trust’s money in a socially 
conscious and politically aware way.
Socially conscious
Investing used to be so straightforward. In order to create a balanced port-
folio, you purchased blue-chip stocks (stocks in well-regarded, stable compa-
nies with good records of earnings and price stability) or all the stocks listed 
on the Standard and Poor’s index. Now, of course, it’s not enough to buy 
what everyone else has been buying for generations. Today, if you want to 
be socially responsible and conscious, you also need to look closely at each 

184
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
corporation’s hiring practices, treatment of their employees, environmental 
impact (and whether that’s improving), and kinds of goods produced. For 
example, is the company manufacturing more garbage for landfills, or are 
they using an environmentally sustainable model in production? In fact, in 
order to be a truly socially conscious investor, you need to study far more 
than the balance sheet — you need to check out the corporate philosophy 
and its implementation.
 
Socially conscious investing isn’t an easy matter. No corporation is going to 
come up trumps in every category you may be concerned with, and if you’re 
interested only in buying ones that do, your potential list of corporations 
is going to be very short indeed. Instead, in this oh-so-imperfect world you 
may want to create your own set of criteria, focusing on those areas of social 
responsibility you are and aren’t willing to compromise on. So you may find a 
company that promotes women at the same rate as men but hasn’t reached 
energy sustainability just yet. Or you may find the (almost) perfect corpora-
tion, and then discover buried in its annual report the fact that it invests its 
excess cash in the stock of a corporation you despise. Remember, no corpora-
tion is perfectly conscious — perfect consciousness is a Zen concept that just 
doesn’t translate very well to the corporate boardroom.
Politically aware
In addition to being socially conscious, many investors are also trying to 
push one political agenda over another in their choices of investments. 
There’s some proof that this strategy works — who can deny that South 
Africa is a very different place today because investors deserted South 
African companies as an attempt to force change in that country? At the 
same time, Cuba is very much the same place today despite sanctions, so the 
strategy isn’t foolproof.
No laws prohibit buying or boycotting companies based on the countries 
where they’re located or companies whose stated business purpose sup-
ports one political point of view. So long as you, as trustee, are sufficiently 
convinced that a company has a solid business plan and all the tools in place 
to turn a profit and add to the trust’s bottom line, that company represents 
a valid investment for the trust. The fact that you have the ability to further 
your own political agenda at the same time is kind of a nice side benefit.

 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
Looking to the Beneficiaries’ Needs
If all that were involved in investing trust principal were choosing the 
investments and then seeing how well they did, anyone could be a trustee. 
However, being a trustee requires much more. You’ve been chosen because 
the grantor trusted that you’d be able to determine exactly what the benefi-
ciaries need at any given time (and how best to make sure that they receive 
it), while at the same time balancing the desires of the remaindermen to have 
something at the end of the trust period.
Beneficiaries’ needs change over time, and trust investments need to change 
in relation to them. As the trustee, you have to determine what the trust must 
do in order to meet those needs. You need to know when to switch invest-
ments in order to produce more income, and when you should tailor them 
to produce less income. It’s sometimes a balancing act worthy of the Flying 
Wallendas — only now it’s you on the high wire.
Don’t worry though. You don’t have to do it all on your own. Remember, 
you may have quite a bit of guidance lurking in the trust instrument itself, 
with specific instructions as to when you should make certain distributions 
and other, less specific wording, regarding where your discretionary powers 
lie. And don’t forget your investment advisor (check out the earlier section 
“Using Investment Advisors Effectively”), who can help ensure that your 
investments meet the beneficiaries’ needs. You also need to keep the follow-
ing pieces of information in mind about the beneficiary.
Age
As trustee, you need to judge when beneficiary payments are useful, and when 
they’re unnecessary. Even if the trust has a mandatory income beneficiary, 
you can still limit the distributions to that beneficiary by limiting the amount of 
income earned by the trust. Many trusts are invested primarily in non-income-
bearing investments for that very reason. At the same time, you can select 
high-income-bearing investments to benefit a beneficiary who really needs 
the income from the trust to pay for living (or other) expenses. For example, 
a young child who is a trust beneficiary likely needs little from the trust, espe-
cially if his or her parents are still alive and are able to provide life’s necessi-
ties. As that same child begins college, he or she may look to the trust to pay 
for some or all higher educational expenses. Or a working adult may require 
little from the trust now, but those needs may increase after retirement.
Although we don’t advocate treating trust beneficiaries like you would your 
own children, it often feels like that with regard to money issues. The very 
items that concern you when your children are growing are the ones that 
factor into your decisions as trustee.

186
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Purpose of trust
Grantors often establish trusts for very specific reasons — to pay for college, 
to provide money to make that first home purchase, or to provide a safety 
net for someone the grantor isn’t sure can completely provide for himself or 
herself. If you’re a trustee of such a trust, you need to read the instrument 
very carefully to make certain that you know why the trust exists in the first 
place and then create a plan that answers that need. The following sections 
describe some common reasons grantors create trusts.
Trusts that distribute income currently
Very often, grantors create trusts to provide a steady stream of income to 
one or more beneficiaries, year in and year out. The beneficiaries who rely 
on this income look to you to make sure that they continue to have enough 
to live on, so you have to make sure that the trust generates not only enough 
income this year but also next year and ten years down the road. The only 
way you’re going to be able to keep pace with inflation is to make sure that 
the trust’s principal grows.
 
Adding difficulty to an already complex task is that trust beneficiaries often 
require more than just the income in order to live, and you may feel you need 
to make some principal distributions so someone you feel responsible for can 
pay the rent. All we can say is this: Before you make a principal distribution 
to the beneficiaries, consider all your options. Making principal distributions 
can be a slippery slope, and reducing the amount of available principal isn’t 
a smart way to increase the income for future years. However, depending on 
the terms of the trust instrument, you may have the discretion to do so, and 
sometimes principal distributions aren’t only appropriate but are also what 
the grantor would have wanted. Also keep in mind that income beneficiaries 
have a nasty habit of becoming used to higher payments. After they start 
receiving them, they expect them to continue. Income beneficiaries not only 
won’t understand your explanation of the difference between income and prin-
cipal, but they also won’t want to understand.
Trusts that are age-based
Many trusts are created to behave one way while the beneficiary is one age 
and completely differently as that beneficiary ages. If you’re trustee of such a 
trust, make a calendar of when your beneficiary hits those ages.
An age-based trust is known as an accumulation trust during the early stages 
because it doesn’t make distributions while the beneficiary is young and 
therefore accumulates income. You want to invest the trust that’s accu-
mulating income very differently than one where the beneficiary depends 
on regular income distributions (such as a currently distributing income 

187
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
trust, described in the preceding section). An accumulation trust is typi-
cally invested in a way that minimizes the trust’s income tax hit. Trusts, like 
individuals, pay a graduated income tax; however, a trust’s run through the 
various tax brackets happens a lot sooner than an individual’s, and a trust 
can be paying the top tax rate with just a little more than $10,000 of ordinary 
income. Ouch!
 
So if your trust is still in the accumulation stage, investing in stocks that pay 
small dividends is a popular strategy because it limits the amount of taxable 
income while still allowing the value of the trust to grow. However, the trade-
off you should expect from a stock that pays a small dividend, or even no 
dividend at all, is that the market price of that stock should grow substantially 
because the company is plowing its profits back into the business rather than 
paying them out to shareholders. If you fail to see growth over time, don’t 
hesitate to sell the stock, even if you sell it for less than you purchased it for. 
Everyone makes mistakes sometimes; better to realize that you’ve made one 
and get out than to hang on forever, waiting for the company to turn around. 
Check out Stock Investing For Dummies, 2nd Edition, by Paul Mladjenovic 
(Wiley), for the nuts and bolts of knowing when to get out of a bad investment.
As the beneficiary ages, and the trust begins to make distributions, you’re 
now free to shift the investments to ones that produce as much, or as little, 
income as you think it wise to give the beneficiary. After the beneficiary is 
receiving income from the trust, the tax liability for that income is paid by 
the beneficiary, not by the trust.
Spendthrift trusts
One of the most popular reasons a grantor creates a trust is because he or 
she doesn’t think that the beneficiary of that trust is able to handle large 
sums of money. A spendthrift trust is designed to deal with that situation, 
giving absolute control of the money to the trustee, who then must make the 
decisions about how much money to distribute and how often.
Spendthrift trusts are absolutely discretionary, in that the trustee has total 
control over the distributions; the only requirement is that you keep the best 
interest of the beneficiary front and center at all times. If you’re the trustee, 
you may distribute income or principal if in your best judgment it benefits 
the beneficiary, even if the payments aren’t made directly to the beneficiary. 
For example, if your beneficiary in spendthrift trusts has medical issues that 
require care, you may opt to pay the beneficiary’s health insurance premi-
ums, doctor and pharmacy bills, or even hospital and nursing home care bills 
directly to those organizations instead of giving the money to the beneficiary 
to do so.

188
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Paying the Trust’s Expenses
In addition to making payments to the beneficiaries, as trustee, you’re also 
responsible for paying the expenses you incur in administering the trust. The 
following sections outline the primary expenses you’ll have and what you 
need to remember when paying them.
Trustees’ fees
If you’re not a professional trustee (or acting for an institutional one), 
chances are good that you agreed to be trustee out of the goodness of your 
heart, and you’d really do this work for nothing. Still, even if you’re a family 
trustee closely related to the grantor and the beneficiaries, you’ve probably 
already figured out that administering a trust can sometimes be a time eater. 
You’re not unreasonable to want to get paid for that time. And that’s all a 
trustee’s fee is: the amount the trust pays to compensate the trustee for his or 
her time.
There is no set trustee’s fee. You can choose to base it on a small percentage 
of the market value of the assets plus a percentage of the income earned by 
the trust, or you may opt to calculate the number of hours you spend and bill 
by the hour. You may even charge a flat fee, which is more like an honorarium 
(basically, a professional thank-you gift). What you may not do is overcharge. 
How much is too much? Like the Supreme Court standard for pornography, 
people tend to know it when they see it. We prefer to think of it as the stink 
test. If either of us sees a fee and her nose starts to twitch, she’s going to be 
looking for an explanation of that fee pretty quickly.
Trustee fees are an income tax deduction for the trust but taxable income 
to you. You must declare these fees on your Form 1040, where you place 
them on line 21, Other Income. If you’re a professional trustee (an attorney, 
accountant, enrolled agent, or other financial professional), this income is 
also subject to Self-Employment Tax; otherwise, it’s income taxable only.
 
Trustee fees are typically paid both from principal and income so as not to 
burden either side unduly. After all, your job is to look after both of their inter-
ests; it’s only fair that both sides help to foot your bill.
Investment advice
 
Investment advice is deductible to the trust minus that pesky 2 percent 
haircut that miscellaneous itemized deductions are subject to. Chapter 18 
describes how to calculate the deduction in all its hairy details.

189
 Chapter 12: Investing the Trust’s Assets and Paying Its Expenses
Accounting fees
Unless you’re preparing Form 1041 by yourself, you also have to pay account-
ing or tax preparation fees. You may choose to pay these from income or 
principal, or a combination of the two. We usually pay them from income, 
but that’s just our habit. Accounting fees in a trust are usually charged on an 
hourly basis or on the complexity of the returns being prepared, and are fully 
deductible — no haircut here.
Taxes
State and local income taxes, real estate taxes, personal property taxes — 
these bills are all deductible if paid by the trust on trust obligations. So, if the 
trust owns real estate, it gets to deduct those taxes. If, on the other hand, the 
trust pays the real estate taxes on property owned by the income beneficiary, 
the trust has actually made a distribution to the beneficiary.
 
✓ If the trust is only paying a capital gains tax, you pay that from principal. 
(Remember, capital gains remain in the trust and aren’t distributed to 
the income beneficiary.)
 
✓ If the trust is accumulating income, you pay the entire tax from principal 
because the accumulated income is transferred to principal at the end of 
each year and becomes part of the principal.
 
✓ On occasion, when you don’t transfer accumulated income to principal, 
you pay taxes on the ordinary income of the trust from the income side, 
and the capital gains taxes from the principal side. For example, one of 
us works with a trust where the accumulated income is payable to the 
income beneficiary’s estate when he dies. In this case, paying the taxes 
owed on income that would be payable to the beneficiary (if he chose 
to take it) from the income side, and the taxes on the capital gains (to 
which the beneficiary isn’t entitled) from the principal side isn’t only 
advisable, it’s mandatory.
To the extent that income is available in the trust to pass out to a beneficiary 
(for an expense such as the real estate taxes mentioned earlier), that tax 
payment becomes an income distribution and the beneficiary will receive a 
Schedule K-1 from the trust in due course. Chapter 19 explains all you need 
to know about the K-1 and how items from the trust’s checkbook can eventu-
ally end up on the beneficiary’s tax return. It’s a pretty nifty trick.
 
Unlike individuals, who may deduct state sales taxes rather than state income 
taxes (handy in states with no income tax), state sales tax deductions aren’t 
available for trusts. After all, trusts don’t buy anything except for services, and 
those services typically aren’t subject to sales tax.

from them)
▶ Setting up the distribution schedule
▶ Ensuring that you make the proper distributions at the proper times
▶ Handling beneficiaries who ask for or need unscheduled distributions
I
f stashing money away in a trust fund is great, figuring out how to invest 
it so it makes money is even better. Still, going through all this trouble is 
basically pointless unless you do it to benefit someone else: the trust ben-
eficiary. The trust beneficiary is the person or institution who’s named in the 
trust instrument to receive income and/or principal from the trust.
In this chapter, we explain how, when, and why you make distributions over 
the lifetime of the trust to the trust beneficiary or beneficiaries. We give 
you the lowdown on the information you need from and about the benefi-
ciaries before you can write that first check, and how to determine whether 
you should ever pay more than the absolute minimum the trust instrument 
directs you to pay. And when it’s time to completely discharge your duty as 
trustee, we tell you what you need to know to make those final distributions.
Notifying Trust Beneficiaries
Even though some trust beneficiaries, such as wives or children, know well 
in advance of that first distribution that a trust has been established for 
their benefit, we’ve noticed that grantors (the person who establishes the 
trust) often fail to tell named beneficiaries that trusts exist for their benefit. 
Sometimes it’s because they want to encourage that person to strive and to 
achieve without the knowledge that there’s a safety net securely fastened 
beneath them; other times, the grantor doesn’t want to discuss his or her 
own mortality with a child or grandchild. Whatever the reason, it often falls 
to you, the trustee, to inform the beneficiaries of the existence of the trust 
and the fact that they’ll reap some benefit from it.

192
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
Notifying a beneficiary doesn’t have a formal steps to follow; basically it’s 
really up to you to figure out how best to notify him or her. If you know the 
person, a telephone call can accomplish the task with very little fuss and 
bother, and gives the beneficiary an immediate chance to ask questions. If 
you’re not acquainted with the beneficiary, a simple letter suffices, advising 
him or her of the existence of the trust, and that he or she is a named ben-
eficiary. Include all of your contact info (telephone, e-mail and snail mail), 
and urge the beneficiary to contact you at his or her earliest convenience. 
Remember, you won’t be able to begin making distributions until you’ve set 
up a reliable form of communication with the beneficiary. 
When you make contact with the beneficiaries, this section points out the 
necessary info you need to retrieve from them.
Obtaining addresses and Social 
Security Numbers
After you notify the beneficiary, you need to obtain his or her address and 
Social Security Number. Beneficiary payments may, and probably will, con-
tain elements of taxable income. Because he or she must pay the tax on that 
income, you shouldn’t make any payments without obtaining tax reporting 
information upfront.
 
Trust beneficiaries often plead poverty or extraordinary circumstances, espe-
cially when waiting for that first trust distribution. Resist the temptation — 
keep your hands on the cash and don’t make any payments until the beneficiary 
coughs up his or her address and Social Security Number. If you pay before you 
have the information you need, you may still be waiting for it when you sit down 
to prepare the trust’s tax returns many months later.
Of course, you can’t force a beneficiary to give you his or her Social Security 
Number, and you can’t withhold payments indefinitely. If you find yourself 
in a position where you made distributions without first receiving the ben-
eficiary’s Social Security Number, you may be forced to file a tax return for 
the trust (Form 1041) that’s missing this required piece of information. File 
the return anyway, making sure that you include as much information, such 
as the beneficiary’s address, as you can on Schedule K-1 (see Chapter 19). 
Provided you can show the IRS you made a concerted attempt to obtain the 
information, you should be off the hook for filing an incomplete return.
Verifying dates of birth
Knowing the beneficiary’s birth date is important, and not just so you can 
send a card every year. Many trusts are created with payout schedules based 
on ages; as trustee, you need to know when the beneficiary has reached a 

193
 Chapter 13: Paying Trust Beneficiaries
certain age and adjust the mandatory payments accordingly. Obtaining third-
party verification of a birth date isn’t necessary. Usually, beneficiaries are 
more than happy to provide you with their correct date of birth.
 
Knowing the trust beneficiary’s age is important because it helps you choose 
appropriate investments, allowing you to minimize certain types of income at 
a time when the beneficiary is in a higher tax bracket. If a beneficiary’s under 
the age of 19 (or 24, if a college student), he or she may be subject to the so-
called Kiddie Tax on investment income, which essentially charges tax on the 
child’s income at his or her parents’ highest applicable rate. Unfortunately, 
investment income is exactly what a trust produces, so all income received 
from a trust may be subject to this additional tax. After the beneficiary has left 
college and is earning, you can then change the investment mix to one that 
produces more income taxed at a lower rate.

sion of Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson, Margaret Atkins Munro, and David 
J. Silverman (Wiley).
Determining Scheduled Distributions
Although not every trust makes distributions to its beneficiaries on a con-
tinuing basis (either monthly, quarterly, or annually), all trusts are required 
to make distributions at some point in their existence, even if the only dis-
tribution made is the one that terminates the trust. As trustee, you have to 
figure out what that schedule should be and make sure that distribution 
dates are calendared somewhere. It doesn’t matter whether you write them 
on a chalkboard on the wall, enter them into your computer database, or 
arrange to have reminders telepathically sent on the appropriate dates. What 
does matter is that you have a plan in place to be certain that distributions 
required by the trust instrument are made when they’re due to be made. If 
you’re not sure where to begin when making distributions, this section helps 
ensure that you know how much to pay and when.
Figuring out how much to pay
When trying to determine how much to pay beneficiaries, you first want to 
look at the trust instrument for direction:
 
✓ Fixed amount distributions: Sometimes, the trust instrument instructs 
you to pay a set dollar amount on a certain date. One of us, for example, 
prepares the tax returns for a family of trusts a grandmother set up for 
her grandchildren. Although Grandma is long gone, each of her grand-
children still receives $1,000 each and every year as a birthday gift.

194
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
✓ 5/5 provision: Often, a trust for the benefit of a surviving spouse con-
tains a so-called 5/5 provision, where the surviving spouse may request 
a distribution of either 5 percent of the assets or $5,000 annually, which-
ever is greater.
 
✓ Trust accounting income: Far more usual than the fixed amount distri-
bution, though, is a distribution that’s based on the net income of the 
trust, or trust accounting income. The trust may require all income to be 
distributed annually, quarterly, or even monthly. If the instrument con-
tains this requirement, you need to be sure that the payments are made 
within a reasonable amount of time after the due date. You’re allowed to 
be a bit late — sometimes you can’t possibly calculate the actual income 
until after the actual date you should have sent out a check. But you 
really should try to make that distribution as soon as you possibly can. 
Remember, in accepting the role of trustee, you’ve agreed to abide by 
the terms of the trust; failure to do so may give the beneficiary grounds 
to try to have you removed.
 
✓ Discretionary distributions: Although it’s by far more frequent for a 
beneficiary to come to you, hat in hand, to ask for more money (see the 
section “When Beneficiaries Request More Money: Paying Out Extra 
Distributions” later in this chapter), sometimes you may see a need that 
the beneficiary doesn’t. He or she may be struggling financially but is 
too proud to ask help. Or the beneficiary may have some medical prob-
lems that an injection of cash can help alleviate. Most trusts provide 
you, the trustee, with the discretion to make additional, unscheduled 
distributions. Usually, the terms of the trust limit these discretions to 
issues of health or education. Sometimes, though, the trustee’s discre-
tionary powers are extremely broad, and the trust instrument contains 
language to the effect that the trustee may act as he or she sees fit. Read 
your instrument closely to see how much discretion you’re allowed. In 
the case of discretionary distributions, you’re not limited to distributing 
only income, but may also make principal distributions if you, in your 
estimation, feel that they’re warranted.
Calculating Trust Accounting Income
Trust Accounting Income, or TAI for short, is the formula that determines 
how much income is available to be distributed to the income beneficiary. 
You calculate it by adding together all items of income and then subtract-
ing all expenses attributable to income. Here’s an example. The Albatross 
Trust owns principal assets that include both taxable and tax-exempt bonds, 
dividend-paying stocks, and an interest in a shopping mall. In addition to the 
trustee fees the trustee pays herself, she also pays an investment advisor to 
assist her in investing in the stock and bond markets and an enrolled agent to 
prepare the trust’s income tax returns.
To arrive at TAI, the trustee of the Albatross Trust adds up all the interest, 
dividends, and rental income earned, even if some of that income may be tax 
exempt on the trust’s income tax return. Then she subtracts whatever share 

195
 Chapter 13: Paying Trust Beneficiaries
of trustee, investment advice, and accounting fees she actually pays from the 
income earned (she may, and probably does, pay a portion of all these fees 
from the principal side of the account). In addition, she also subtracts any 
income taxes paid from the income side of the trust and any miscellaneous 
expenses (even if they’re not tax deductible).
In Table 13-1, you see how the Albatross Trust’s trustee assigns items of 
income between the income and principal sides of the trust, and also how 
she allocates the fees charged to the trust. Remember, although the rules for 
allocating income are fairly rigid, the trustee may be much more flexible and 
use her judgment in allocating fees and expenses provided, however, that 
the allocation is a reasonable one and that it doesn’t unduly favor either the 
income beneficiaries or the principal remaindermen (the people who get the 
assets in the trust when the trust terminates).

Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
If you’re required to pass out all the income in the trust, calculating TAI gives 
you the exact number you need to pay to the beneficiary. If, on the other 
hand, you’re directed to pay out a set amount, nothing at all, or you only make 
distributions at your discretion, calculating TAI is something you need only do 
when preparing your annual Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates 
and Trusts; it doesn’t have any impact on the distributions you do make. 
Chapter 18 tells you how to complete this tax return.
 
We’re noticing that a lot more trusts are investing in foreign securities, and 
income earned from foreign securities often means paying foreign taxes. 
Although the U.S. has tax treaties with most of these countries that entitle 
you to claim a refund for these foreign taxes you’re paying, in most cases the 
amounts you’re chasing after don’t warrant the additional work required to 
collect the refunds. Instead, you may choose to claim a Foreign Tax Credit on 
Form 1116, which you then attach to your Form 1041. Foreign taxes paid are 
not income taxes chargeable to the trust. If you’re distributing the income 
from the trust, you’re probably also distributing the foreign tax credit to 
the trust’s beneficiary. If this is your situation, don’t subtract foreign taxes 
paid when calculating TAI. In fact, by passing the credit through to your ben-
eficiary, you’re actually making a distribution to him or her that should be 
included in TAI.
Making distributions after the end of the year (Section 663(b))
What’s left after adding together income and subtracting all the income-
related expenses is the trust’s TAI. If you’re administering a trust that 
requires all, or a percentage of, income to be paid out currently, you need to 
calculate TAI before you can make distributions. If you want to make distri-
butions more frequently than annually, you can make an educated guess for 
the first three quarters of every year. Then, in the fourth quarter, you have 
to calculate TAI for the entire year and adjust the fourth quarter distribution 
accordingly.
 
Of course, because the fourth quarter doesn’t end until December 31, it’s basi-
cally impossible to have all the information you need before the end of the cal-
endar year. The IRS understands (some of those agents have trusts, too), and 
accordingly gives you 65 days after the end of the calendar year to make your 
calculation and pay that final distribution. If you use this extra time to make 
a year end distribution, be sure to tick the box on question 6 at the bottom of 
page 2 of Form 1041. You’ve just made a Section 663(b) election for the trust.
Creating a payment schedule
 
How can you be certain that you’ll have cash in the account when you need 
it? Simple. Just develop a payment schedule that ensures that the trust will 
have enough money when you need it. Keep the following pointers in mind 
to help you:

197
 Chapter 13: Paying Trust Beneficiaries
 
✓ Project what your income and expenses will be throughout the year, 
and when you expect to be making payments for fees and expenses 
in the trust. If the income generated by the trust is uneven, so that you 
receive large amounts in one or two months but very little the rest of the 
year, be sure to schedule your fees and expenses payments after you’ve 
received the bulk of the trust’s income. Only after those payments have 
been made should you make payments to the income beneficiary. So, 
if you receive large payments in May and November but not much else 
for the rest of the year, for example, you should schedule your fee and 
expense payments for early June and December, and then you can safely 
pay whatever income is remaining to the beneficiary toward the end of 
June and December. You can create this schedule for your trust on a slip 
of paper or on a computer spreadsheet program.
 
✓ Make sure that you pay all other obligations before you ever write 
a check to the beneficiary. Income from interest and dividends posts 
most heavily into accounts around the 1st of each month, and most tax 
payments are due on the 15th. Service providers almost always bill you 
on or about the first of the month. After the trust pays these obligations, 
then you can arrange to make beneficiary payments, usually toward the 
very end of the month or quarter.
 
✓ Most important, don’t ever leave yourself short at tax time. Although 
accountants and attorneys may not be happy about having to wait for 
payment, and income beneficiaries may plead poverty endlessly in your 
ear, no one has the same ability to turn your life into a miserable waste-
land as the IRS and the state tax authorities have. In addition to tacking 
on penalties and interest for late payment or late filing, the IRS can also 
levy, or reach in and grab the taxes due directly from the trust’s bank or 
brokerage account. And good luck pleading hardship — this is a trust, 
after all, and as far as the IRS is concerned, anyone with the wherewithal 
to form a trust can’t be suffering financially that much!
Distributing When the Beneficiary 
Reaches a Specific Age
Trusts are often designed to keep large sums of money out of the hands of 
people who may not be able to handle them. Of course, people change over 
time, and most of us become more responsible the older we get. In recogni-
tion of this fact, many trusts contain provisions to distribute income and/or 
principal of the trust to the trust’s beneficiary at certain ages. The following 
are two of the most common scenarios:

198
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
✓ Income required: Trusts often don’t begin mandating distributions of 
income to the beneficiary until he or she reaches a certain age. On occa-
sion, distributions may begin as young as age 18. More frequently, they 
start at age 21 or even age 25. Rarely (although it does happen), the 
grantor may delay the start of mandatory income distributions as late 
as age 30.
 
✓ Principal distributions: Because (in most states) trusts aren’t allowed 
to exist forever, trusts usually have a termination scenario spelled out. 
In many cases, the trust terminates when the income beneficiary dies. 
In other cases, where money is held in trust for a beneficiary who the 
grantor may not feel is mature enough to handle large sums at the time 
the trust is created, the principal distributes to that beneficiary as he 
or she attains certain ages. Depending on the grantor’s wishes, distribu-
tion ages may start as early as age 21; however, age 25 or even age 30 is 
far more common as a starting point. Principal is commonly distributed 
in shares at five-year intervals, so that a beneficiary would receive, 
for example, one-third of the principal value at age 25, one-half of the 
remaining value at age 30, and the balance of the trust principal at 
age 35. These distributions come in two varieties:
 
• Cash: A cash distribution is by far the easiest type of distribution 
to make because all you need do is calculate the amount of the 
distribution required and then write a check. If you know when the 
distribution is due to be made (and you should know because you 
placed the date on your calendar when you began administering 
the trust), you may accumulate a war chest of cash and money-
market-type investments, if you’re not making a total distribution 
of the trust’s assets.
 
• Division of assets: If the trust has more than one beneficiary who 
is entitled to a share of the principal assets, you may have to 
distribute assets rather than cash, especially when the trust ter-
minates. In this case, be certain that each beneficiary entitled to a 
share gets a share of the fair market value on the date of termina-
tion. In the case of marketable securities, or those assets which 
can be bought and sold on the major stock, bond, or commodities 
exchanges, obtaining market values on that date is easy (check out 
Chapter 7 for a quick refresher on how to value assets) and divvy 
up the assets accordingly. With privately held assets, such as a 
business or real estate, you need to obtain independent appraisals 
before making distributions. Be sure that each beneficiary receives 
an equally valued share, even though each may receive substan-
tially different assets.

 Chapter 13: Paying Trust Beneficiaries
When Beneficiaries Request More Money: 
Paying Out Extra Distributions
The trust is now up and running. The principal is invested and generating 
income, you’ve figured out how to pay everyone who needs to be paid and 
still have money at the end of the month or quarter to give something to the 
income beneficiary, and all seems well in your world.
But wait! The phone rings — the beneficiary has just decided to return to 
school, buy a house, start a business, have that little medical procedure done 
that isn’t covered by insurance, or to invest in a foolproof way to turn straw 
into gold. As long as we’ve been in this business, you’d think we’d heard all 
the excuses for wanting more money. We’ve posted bail for clients and even 
paid for them to sue us, the trustees.
In fact, the only certainty in administering a trust is that, as much money as 
you manage to pay out to the income beneficiaries that’s mandated by the 
terms of the trust, they’ll always want more. How much more varies, as does 
the worthiness of the requests. If you do receive requests for extra distribu-
tions from the beneficiaries, your job as trustee is to shovel through the 
rationalizations before handing out any money. You must determine
 
✓ Does the request have merit? Not only are you not required to give 
in to each and every demand from the beneficiary, but you also really 
shouldn’t. Not every request deserves a positive response.
 
✓ Would the grantor have given the money for this purpose? You need 
to put yourself in the grantor’s shoes and make that determination. If, 
for example, the grantor wanted to encourage home ownership, and the 
beneficiary is asking for help with a down payment, your answer is clear. 
If, on the other hand, the beneficiary is asking for money to attend bar-
tending school and the donor was a fervent teetotaler, you may want to 
think twice.
 
✓ If you make this extra distribution, how will it affect the ongoing 
purpose of the trust? If the purpose of the trust is to provide a safety 
cushion for an income beneficiary who is relying on that income to live, 
and depleting the principal of the trust in order to make this discretion-
ary distribution would severely impact the trust’s ability to provide that 
ongoing financial cushion, you may want to think twice, or even three 
times, before writing that check. Be willing to ask for more informa-

200
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
tion regarding how the beneficiary plans to use this distribution. For 
example, if the distribution would enable the beneficiary to reduce living 
expenses (perhaps by purchasing a house for cash rather than requiring 
a mortgage), the loss of future income may be more than offset by the 
long-term reduction in the beneficiary’s expenses.
 
✓ Are you being asked to make a distribution to a spendthrift beneficiary? 
In our experience, a fair number of trust beneficiaries are only trust benefi-
ciaries because money runs through their fingers like water. When parents 
and grandparents place inheritances in trust for such heirs, it’s usually 
for the sole purpose of preventing them from frittering away the money. 
Unfortunately, because trusts for spendthrifts tend to restrict access to 
any of the money except at the trustee’s discretion, a beneficiary of one of 
these trusts can almost be guaranteed to live in your pocket, constantly 
asking for money for this, that, or the other. Weigh these requests care-
fully; some have merit, but many don’t. As we show in the section “Making 
the Decision to Distribute Discretionally: Eyeing the Trust’s Terms” you 
have to place yourself in the grantor’s shoes to make that determination. 
And, should you choose to make a distribution, be certain to obtain proof 
that the money is being used for the purpose intended. Depending on the 
beneficiary, you may want to pay the beneficiary’s bills directly instead 
of giving the money to the beneficiary and relying on him or her to make 
those payments.
 
If you’re the trustee of a spendthrift trust, you want to carefully document all 
your dealings with the beneficiary. If possible, all requests that come directly 
from the beneficiary should come in writing so that you can see, on paper, 
the scope of the request. And, if the beneficiary is requesting money to pay a 
specific bill or fund a project, don’t rely only on the beneficiary’s say-so, but 
request a copy of any third-party documentation, such as the bill that needs 
to be paid. Don’t hesitate to contact that third party directly for verification.
 
And, if you choose not to make the distribution, be sure to notify the benefi-
ciary, in writing, of your decision, referencing the part of the trust instrument 
that gives you the discretion to say no. In our experience, although many ben-
eficiaries of spendthrift trusts are absolutely wonderful individuals who are 
merely challenged by money, some are merely looking for an excuse to make 
your life miserable. By keeping a well-documented paper trail, you protect 
yourself from having your past decisions rebound on you.
Making the Decision to Distribute 
Discretionally: Eyeing the Trust’s Terms
Very often, trust instruments give you, the trustee, a great deal of guidance 
as to what sorts of discretionary distributions the grantor thought you may 
be asked to make. Some of these so-called discretionary powers are quite 

201
 Chapter 13: Paying Trust Beneficiaries
narrow, but others leave you with almost completely unfettered range, both 
with regard to requests you receive from the beneficiary as well as those 
needs of the beneficiary that you, yourself, identify. This section provides 
some guidance to help you make these decisions.
Ensuring health and well-being
Among the most popular of discretionary power standards is one that allows 
the trustee to make payments to ensure the health and well-being of the 
trust’s beneficiaries. Usually, this power extends the class of beneficiaries 
well beyond the stated income beneficiary: that person’s spouse, children, 
grandchildren, or other issue. And, unless explicitly stated in the trust instru-
ment, it’s not just to cover medical expenses. Instead, the health and well-
being standard can be used, if the trustee chooses to interpret it as such, to 
provide a wide variety of extras to the beneficiaries. In addition to paying 
doctors’ bills and providing health insurance for those who don’t have 
any, the trustee may also determine that vacations, ballet lessons, summer 
camps, and other such items add to the beneficiaries’ general health and 
well-being.
Of course, although the standard is broad, it’s not unlimited. Although most 
trustees would probably agree that replacing an aging, mold-infested resi-
dence with something that provided a cleaner environment meets the health 
and well-being standard, they probably would also agree that replacing one 
adequate residence with another, larger one doesn’t.
Paying for education
Saving money for education in a trust can be a very effective way to pay for 
college, and many people use trusts for this purpose. Saving for education 
inside a trust allows much greater flexibility when the time comes to pay for 
that education — and, should the child or grandchild named as beneficiary 
receive merit scholarships or choose not to go to college, the money can 
easily be used for other purposes at other times.
 
If the trust you’re administering allows you discretion to make distributions for 
education, you should be aware that education isn’t limited only to postsecond-
ary schools. You may also use trust monies to pay for private primary and sec-
ondary education, for supplemental educational programs, for summer camps 
that have some sort of educational focus (we know of several trust beneficiaries 
who’ve attended summer music camps thanks to discretionary trust distribu-
tions), for tutoring, or even to buy a computer. In fact, if you think the request is 
reasonable, and you can rationalize that it furthers the beneficiary’s education 
in some way, you’re most likely on safe ground in making that distribution.

202
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Buying a home
Very few trust instruments include any specific language allowing you to 
make a distribution to a beneficiary so that he or she can purchase a house. 
At the same time, very few trust instruments explicitly prohibit you from 
making distributions either for down payments or for the total purchase 
price of a house. This is one of those gray areas that you have to deal 
with and one of the places where you need to look not only at the trust’s 
resources but also at the beneficiary’s decision making.
 
When deciding whether or not to use trust assets to buy a home, be certain 
that the beneficiary will actually be able to afford to live there. He or she will 
now be responsible for the house’s ongoing expenses, maintenance (both 
major and minor repairs), and real estate taxes. If you’ve gone to the trouble of 
purchasing the house and distributing it outright to the beneficiary, you want 
to be certain that the beneficiary won’t turn around and try to drain it of cash. 
One of us worked on a trust that used almost all of its assets to buy the benefi-
ciary a house outright. A month after the closing, the beneficiary was already 
trying to raise a mortgage on the house; two years after the purchase, the city 
where the beneficiary lived foreclosed on his home for nonpayment of taxes.
 
If you think the beneficiary would be better off living in stable housing rather 
than going from rental to rental, but you’re not sure that he or she is likely to 
be able to afford the upkeep and taxes on a house, you always have the option 
of having the trust purchase, and own, the property. This way, you know that 
the necessary bills are being paid, and you can arrange regular inspections to 
determine what, if any, maintenance must be done. Although doing so is more 
work for you, at least you’ll rest assured that, whatever shortcomings the ben-
eficiary may have in his or her life and financial dealings, at least he or she will 
have a stable and comfortable place to sleep each night.
Starting a business
In most cases, stifling the earning capacity of the trust’s beneficiary isn’t the 
grantor’s goal; still, you the trustee face a tough decision when the benefi-
ciary comes looking to you for money with which to start a business or to 
additionally capitalize a business that may require a cash infusion in order to 
stay afloat.
Your decision to distribute trust funds for this purpose depends largely on 
your confidence in the abilities of the beneficiary and his or her business plan. 
Your job isn’t to be a nice guy; it’s to request and study a business plan and 
to make your judgment based on sound business principles, not pie-in-the-sky 
projections.

203
 Chapter 13: Paying Trust Beneficiaries
 
You may determine that you don’t want to deplete the trust’s assets in order 
to support the beneficiary’s business, but that the business plan has merit. 
If you feel that the beneficiary would be able to obtain a loan from a bank or 
other lender on the strength of the business plan, you may loan the money to 
the beneficiary, making sure to have the beneficiary sign a promissory note 
that requires repayment of the principal and payment of interest at market 
rates. If you’re not sure what interest rate to charge, the IRS issues Applicable 
Federal Rates every month, which tells you the minimum interest rate you can 
charge on a loan in order for it to be considered a fair market rate. You can 
find these rates at www.irs.gov under the Index of Applicable Federal Rate 
(AFR) Rulings.
Trustee’s discretion
The grantor, in creating the trust, may have thought he or she’d covered 
every possibility, but life has a funny way of presenting situations you 
thought were impossible. Welcome to the world of the trustee’s discretion, 
where truth is often stranger than fiction. If a beneficiary asks for a distribu-
tion and the trust instrument isn’t clear about that request, you, Mr. or Ms. 
Trustee, need to decide. Remember that the grantor trusted you with making 
these types of decisions.
Keep your wits about you. Ask the beneficiary lots of questions and review 
third-party documentation, when available. Most of all, take your time and 
deliberate carefully. Put yourself in the grantor’s shoes as you weigh your 
decision, taking what you know about the beneficiary into consideration. 
Even though many of the requests you receive from beneficiaries will be 
valid, others be a creative attempt to separate the trust’s assets from the 
trust. On the small end, we’ve received requests to pay veterinarian bills 
and buy new cars. On the larger side, we’ve helped buy major-league sports 
teams and financed movies. Sometimes the distributions have been made 
and other times they haven’t. Remember, you’re not required to dispense 
money just because a beneficiary requests it.

Trust Records

▶ Putting together a filing system

Y
ou probably know at least one person who never balances his check-
book, who keeps track of his money by rounding to the nearest dollar 
or ten, who thinks that he must have money in the account because he still 
has checks in the checkbook, and who shows up at his accountant’s office on 
April 14 with a shoe box of receipts. We’d love to be able to tell you that you 
can administer a trust this way — that the trust elves come in each night to 
do all the work of the trust — but we’d be lying. A competently managed trust 
is one where you keep, maintain, and update records on a regular basis. You 
have no room in trust management for approximation or procrastination;
every penny counts and must be counted. In this chapter, we explain the 
nuts and bolts of what records you should keep, the information you need to 
create them, and how long to retain them.
Creating a Filing System
Staying organized is important in many of life’s tasks and duties, and no 
more so than when you’re a trustee. The grantor has relied on you to handle 
the trust’s assets competently. When you’re organized, you know where the 
trust’s important documents and records are, which helps you to properly 
and efficiently administer the trust.
Organizational lapses can mean extra time spent searching for a crucial piece 
of correspondence or, more important, failure to make a required distribution 
or file and pay the trust’s taxes. Start off your administration in as organized 

206
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
a fashion as you possibly can, and as with most things in life, you’ll find that 
almost everything you do will be easier and take less time. This section helps 
you set up that initial organization.
Getting started: Organizing the right way
Beginning on the right foot when administering a trust is important. So where 
do you start? The day you discover you’re a trustee is the day you should 
begin organizing the trust’s administration. What do you do to begin? Head 
to your local office supply or stationery store for the following items to help 
you get organized:
 
✓ Paper supplies: Pick up manila files, file folders, labels, special account-
ing pads (if you’re not comfortable working with a computer spread-
sheet), legal pads (or whatever you prefer to make notes on), and 
anything else you think may be useful to you.
 
✓ Various ink stamps (and ink if necessary): If you’re going to be collect-
ing dividend and/or interest checks, you may want to purchase a “For 
Deposit Only” stamp for the back of your checks, or a date stamp to put 
on all trust correspondence you receive.
 
✓ A filing cabinet: You really want one that locks and is reasonably fire 
resistant.
 
✓ A computer, printer, and Internet connection (if you don’t already 
have them available to you): If the trust is large enough, complex 
enough, and will continue long enough to warrant the cost, these invest-
ments will be invaluable.
 
Most of the work you need to do for any trust can be done on a computer, and 
having one can save you a great deal of time and money over the course of the 
trust’s administration.
 
With your supplies in hand, create some file folders. Here are some you posi-
tively, definitely want to have, whether you have a manual or electronic filing 
system. Keep in mind that some of these files can be destroyed at a later date; 
others you may want to have bronzed. The following list shows you which 
files you want to keep permanently:
 
✓ Trust instrument
 
✓ Beginning inventory
 
✓ Annual accounts

207
 Chapter 14: Creating and Keeping Trust Records
You can destroy these files after you’re done with them. Remember, though, 
that the concept of temporary is relative. In many cases, you’re not going to 
want to toss these files onto the bonfire for many years:
 
✓ Bank statements and cancelled checks, filed by date: You can destroy 
them after you’ve prepared the annual accounts and after beneficiaries 
have assented to those accounts. If this is a probate trust, hang onto 
them until the probate account has been allowed.
 
✓ Brokerage statements and stock trade confirmations, filed by date: 
Hang onto them as long as you keep the bank statements and cancelled 
checks.
 
✓ Income tax returns, either filed sequentially by date in one folder or 
in separate folders for each year’s returns: Keep copies of all income 
tax returns for at least seven years after you file them.
 
✓ Correspondence, filed by date: Depending on the content of the letters, 
you may want to hold onto old correspondence until the trust termi-
nates and all accounts have been assented to. You can place the really 
old correspondence into storage, though.
 
✓ E-mails, plus memos and notes regarding phone conversations and 
meetings, filed by date: Hold onto them as long as you keep your cor-
respondence files. You’d be surprised how often you need to reference 
historical information.
 
✓ Billing: Yes, as trustee you bill the trust for your fees, unless you choose 
to forego a trustee fee because the trust is for a family member or for 
some other reason. You want to keep a record of what you bill and what 
you base your fee on. You can destroy them together with the bank and 
brokerage statements.
 
✓ Miscellaneous: This file is where you put anything you think is impor-
tant but doesn’t really fit into any of the other categories. If you’re plac-
ing old correspondence, e-mails, and memos into storage, you probably 
should put these old miscellaneous files there as well. After the trust 
terminates (see Chapter 15), you can destroy them.
 
 Of course, every trust is different, and you may find that your miscella-
neous file is the biggest one in the drawer. If that’s the case, see whether 
you can group that information into some additional file categories and 
shrink that miscellaneous file down to a manageable size. The more 
finely you’re able to slice and dice the information you’re keeping, the 
more easily you can find exactly what you’re looking for when you need 
it. If you’re administering multiple trusts, or if you just want to make 
your file folders more portable, file them in an expandable manila file 
and then in the locking filing cabinet.

208
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Keeping the trust instrument handy
You may have already read the trust instrument and be fairly certain you 
know what’s contained in it. But believe us when we tell you that reading 
a trust instrument isn’t like reading a novel; you can’t read, and compre-
hend, everything in it sequentially. We can guarantee that before you hit the 
bottom of page 2, your eyes will be glazed over, and you’ll wonder what you 
did to deserve this. By the time you actually reach the signature pages at the 
end, you won’t even remember the name of the trust, let alone recall what 
Article VII or Paragraph 3(B)(ii)(c) says.
 
Because a trust instrument can be quite confusing, you want to be able to 
refer to it whenever possible to clarify any questions you may have. That’s 
why you want to keep a copy of it close by so you can easily access it. You 
may want to scan a copy into your computer, where you can open it up at will 
whenever necessary. Or you may prefer to maintain a hard copy in a three-
ring binder or a manila folder. Whatever you do, and wherever you keep it, 
make sure that it’s fastened in and that all the pages are fully legible. If you 
choose to use any sort of binder, make sure to reinforce the punched holes. 
We can guarantee that you’ll read and reread this document so many times 
over the years that the paper will begin to shred over time. Make sure that the 
instrument is always fully legible; as pages begin to fade, you should recopy 
and replace them as necessary.
Compiling correspondence
A trust is an ongoing organism, and what happens today most certainly 
impacts tomorrow and next year. That’s why keeping careful records of all 
correspondence that you receive and send is essential. You may want to 
compile these in a folder in a manila file, as we discuss earlier in the chapter, 
or in a three-ring binder. As your correspondence grows, you may want to 
separate it out by subject or type, such as correspondence from the grantor, 
or correspondence with the IRS.
 
Sometimes the most important aspect of a particular piece of correspondence 
is that you sent it. When you mail anything that you’re required to mail, such 
as tax returns or certain correspondence to beneficiaries or courts, make sure 
to send it certified mail. When you need to know that something you’ve mailed 
has been received, send it certified mail, return receipt requested And because 
you’re paying extra to prove that you’ve mailed something or that someone’s 
actually received it, staple those receipts to the copies of the letters you sent 
so that you have the evidence handy should anyone need to see it.

209
 Chapter 14: Creating and Keeping Trust Records
 
The key to organizing nonpostal communication is keeping a paper (and/or 
electronic) trail. Remember to keep copies of all e-mails that you send and 
receive, and keep notes on all phone conversations, listing the date and time 
of the call, to whom you spoke, the subject matter, and whatever course of 
action or resolutions were decided. By keeping a pad of paper next to the 
phone where you conduct trust business, you’ll always be sure to have the 
tools necessary to keep accurate records. If you have meetings with the ben-
eficiary, an investment advisor, or for any other trust-related purpose, take 
and keep dated notes of all pertinent information from the meeting.
Filing financial records
As trustee, you also want to keep accurate records of the trust’s financial 
records you receive from banks, brokerages, or other sources. Keep all those 
brokerage and bank statements year by year in individual files. For a trust 
that maintains two bank accounts and a brokerage account, for example, you 
should have three files for each year, one for each of the bank accounts and 
one for the brokerage account. In each file, keep the monthly statements, as 
well as any cancelled checks, deposit slips, or purchase and sale confirma-
tions. Files should be kept in date order so that when you need to find a par-
ticular transaction, you can put your hands on it easily.
Preserving annual accounts
If you compare organizing financial information to making a big pot of soup, 
the financial records you receive from all sources are the ingredients, and the 
soup they create is the annual account. Annual accounts are those compila-
tions of all the trust’s activity for any 12-month period that you distill from all 
the information you receive. Check out “Assembling the desired information” 
later in the chapter for info on how to prepare one.
Not every trust instrument requires that you have annual accounts, but 
preparing them on a regular and timely basis is a really good idea whether 
they’re required or not. Your trust instrument should indicate clearly 
whether you’re required to prepare these accounts annually or only if a ben-
eficiary asks to see one. Either way, pulling together all of your financial data 
into one place allows you to see how the trust has done over the past year. 
You can see what investment mistakes you’ve made and how to avoid them 
in the future. And, should a beneficiary or court demand to see one, you 
won’t have to scurry around, trying to create one under pressure.

210
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
After you begin accumulating annual accounts, make sure that you have a file 
ready to hold the finished product. Like with financial statements, file them 
in date order so you can access them easily. It’s not at all uncommon to have 
to go back through years of annual accounts in order to mine certain types of 
information, such as unequal distributions to beneficiaries. By having these 
accounts prepared, in order, and easily found, culling the information you 
need is a simple task.
Referencing tax returns
Maintaining copies of the trust’s income tax returns for seven years seems 
fairly obvious; after all, that’s what you do with your individual returns, 
right? As trustee, you need to keep copies so you can easily reference past 
tax returns as needed. Depending on the size of the tax return, and the 
amount of underlying information that’s needed to prepare the returns, you 
can either choose to file all tax returns by date in one file, or open a new file 
for each tax year.
 
Very often, the initial assets inside a trust arrive via a decedent’s estate. When 
this happens, make sure to obtain a copy of the Form 706, United States 
Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return. In it, you’ll find the 
estate tax values (which will be the trust’s cost basis, as we discuss in Chapter 
18) of all the assets that have now rolled into the trust. Hang onto a copy of 
Form 706 for as long as the trust is in existence; although you’ll refer to it less 
and less as time goes on, you may need to find an estate tax value on some 
quirky little asset that landed in your trust many, many years after the grant-
or’s death.
If the trust owns business or partnership interests, consider hanging onto the 
trust’s income tax returns (including all supporting documentation) for the 
trust’s lifetime because the year-to-year activity in the partnership or busi-
ness may impact the trust’s cost in that business or partnership. When the 
entity dissolves, or the trust sells its share, having that information handy 
may be crucial in determining what tax, if any, is owed.
Preparing an Initial Inventory 
and Valuing the Assets
The starting point for any trust is the property funding it. This property is 
listed on the trust’s initial inventory (that is, a list you create of all the initial 
assets of the trust), where you show each asset’s cost basis (the acquisition 

211
 Chapter 14: Creating and Keeping Trust Records
cost it carries as it enters the trust, which may be the grantor’s purchase 
price, or the date-of-death value for assets that flow into the trust from a 
decedent’s estate).
Although preparing the initial inventory may seem like a daunting task, it’s 
really not. You already should have all the necessary information; it’s just 
scattered. This section shows you how to collect and sort the data into a 
nice, neat package. Remember, the beginning inventory is the starting point 
of the trust’s history, which you’ll eventually trace from inception to termina-
tion by creating accounts, which we explain later in this chapter, in the sec-
tion “Producing Annual Trust Accounts.”
Arriving directly from the donor
When putting together the list of assets, you need to value the decedent’s 
assets to ensure that your records are complete. Property placed in trust 
during the donor’s lifetime carries with it the donor’s adjusted basis and 
acquisition date. How can you calculate that basis? It’s usually as simple as 
the amount the donor paid to obtain the property. Thus, 50 shares of XYZ 
Corp that the donor purchased on April 15, 2000, for a total of $5,000, and 
then donated into his revocable trust on April 15, 2008, has a basis inside the 
trust of $5,000 and an acquisition date of April 15, 2000. If the trustee then 
sells these shares on April 16, 2008, for $10,000, the holding period is eight 
years, not one day, and the capital gain is long term.
The donor’s basis may be adjusted if, for example, he or she reinvests divi-
dends or if improvements are made to property (or a portion of the property 
is damaged due to a casualty loss). Also, if the trust is revocable before the 
donor’s death (refer to Chapter 3), the basis of assets the donor has placed 
inside the trust prior to death will change to the value on the donor’s date 
of death, or to the value six months after death, if the estate chooses to use 
alternate valuation. Check out Chapter 16 for more on how basis changes at 
death.
If a donor funds an irrevocable inter vivos trust prior to death (see Chapter 3), 
the assets in the trust retain the donor’s adjusted basis and acquisition date. 
There is no change in basis or acquisition date when the donor dies.
Coming from the donor’s estate
Property that funds a trust via the donor’s estate carries with it the donor’s 
date-of-death value (or alternate valuation, if the executor has elected to use 
that method of valuation in order to reduce estate taxes). Whether valued as 

212
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
of date of death or alternate valuation date, it’ll be considered as acquired on 
date of death. Any sales within the first year of acquisition are long term, for 
the purpose of calculating capital gains and losses.
Compiling Records of All Transactions
After you create an initial inventory, you can begin tracking the activity in 
the trust account. Just like maintaining a running balance in your own check-
book, tracking this basic information helps in any number of ways. With it, 
you can determine how much is available to distribute to the income ben-
eficiaries (Chapter 13), while at the same time keeping track of the trust’s 
ongoing tax situation (Chapter 18). By recording all the transactions, you’ll 
gain some insight into how much you should charge for your trustee’s fee. 
So, every time you buy or sell a security, receive interest or dividend pay-
ments, or make any payments (taxes, fees, beneficiary payments), you need 
to record that transaction. If there’s activity in the trust accounts, you need 
to capture it. If you miss something along the way, watch out! When it comes 
time to create your annual account, missing transactions will mean that your 
account won’t balance.
Knowing the difference between 
income and principal
As you keep track of these transactions, you need to understand the differ-
ence between income and principal. Unlike your personal accounts, where 
you probably lump all your funds together and then pay your bills from the 
pot of cash, trusts differentiate between principal, or the assets of the trust, 
and income¸ or the money earned by the assets. Distinguishing between 
income and principal can sometimes be confusing because certain types of 
income are actually considered principal (such as capital gains), and others 
remain segregated on the income side of the account. Chapter 12 discusses 
more fully how to make the distinction.
However just keeping track of the approximate records isn’t enough when 
administering a trust. Precision is the key to success, both for administra-
tion and for tax compliance, and no more so than when keeping track of 
basis information. (Basis is your carrying cost in any piece of property of 
whatever type. It may be the price you paid for the property, the price the 
donor paid for it, the estate tax value if you’ve received the property from 
an estate, or any combination.) You have to know what the trust’s cost is in 
an asset before you can make an informed decision as to what to do with it, 
and should you decide to sell it, you need to know the basis, down to the last 
dollar, in order to correctly calculate the capital gain or loss.

213
 Chapter 14: Creating and Keeping Trust Records
 
Don’t rely on brokerages or mutual fund companies to keep track of your cost 
basis in securities. Our experience is that they’re satisfied with approximate 
costs, so they do things like merge tax lots or fail to allocate basis to new 
companies spun off from a parent corporation. Why does it matter? Each time 
you buy a security, you create one tax lot; each time you sell, you may choose 
which lot or lots you’re selling. By designating which shares are sold, you can 
generate either a larger or smaller capital gain or loss, depending on what’s 
most advantageous to the trust. Keeping track of each specific tax lot allows 
you to keep all your options open.
 
Even if your broker supplies you with an informational schedule with its ver-
sion of gains and losses, you’re not obligated to use it, provided you have the 
supporting documentation necessary to back up yours.
Filing income tax returns annually
A trust is a taxable entity, and any income it earns must be reported annu-
ally, either on the grantor’s Form 1040, in the case of a revocable trust, or on 
Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts. Almost all trusts 
are required to file, using a calendar year (ending December 31), and the tax 
return is due on April 15 of the following year. If you’re unable to complete 
and file the return by the filing deadline, you may file Form 7004, Application 
for Automatic 6-Month Extension of Time To File Certain Business Income 
Tax, Information, and Other Returns instead. Remember, any taxes owed for 
the prior year must be paid by April 15; the extension of time to file isn’t an 
extension of time to pay. Chapter 18 tells you what you need to know in order 
to prepare Form 1041.
Producing Annual Trust Accounts
Trust administration is fairly similar to organizing your own finances. You 
have bank and brokerage accounts to manage, taxes to file, bills to pay. 
However, you do have to tangle with one major difference: Although your own 
finances probably toddle along quite nicely without you ever compiling the 
activity into one place, you need to create a trust account for every year of 
the trust’s existence. This account traces all the activity in the trust from the 
ending balances of last year’s account (or from the initial inventory, if this is 
the trust’s first year of operation) to the closing balances at this year’s end.
How do you know what to include and how to create a trust account? Don’t 
feel too overwhelmed. This section shows you what you need to do.

214
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Assembling the desired information
Trusts, unlike estates, account for their activity with a strict separation 
between principal and income. Although you can format them in a variety of 
ways, Figure 14-1 shows a sample account in a form commonly used by most 
trust accountants. Remember that the mathematical concepts here are very 
simple: Schedule A minus Schedule B must equal Schedule C, and Schedule D 
minus Schedule E must equal Schedule F.
 
If all your assets are in one basket, so to speak, held either by a bank, a bro-
kerage, or a law firm fiduciary (trust and estate) department, they should send 
you annual trust accounts. If you’ve scattered the trust’s assets among a vari-
ety of financial institutions, the responsibility of compiling all the information 
into one easy-to-read account becomes yours.
 
Although annual account preparation may seem like a lot of work for little ben-
efit, we strongly urge you to go through the steps to do it each and every year. 
Not only do you pick up any inconsistencies in your recordkeeping this way, 
but you also create a permanent record of set points in the trust’s timeline. 
Down the road, should anyone question your handling of the trust, you’ll have 
these accounts to support your arguments that the trust actually blossomed 
under your management.
Obtaining assents of beneficiaries
You’ve gone to the trouble of generating an annual account. Now you should 
sign it and then provide copies to all the beneficiaries for their assent, or 
agreement to what’s contained in the account. The best, and easiest, way to 
do this is by preparing a summary cover sheet (which then becomes part of 
the account) for the account you’ve prepared, signing it as trustee, attach-
ing it to the six schedules you’ve previously prepared, and providing a copy 
of the complete packet to the beneficiary, together with a photocopy of 
that cover sheet, which the beneficiaries then sign and return to you. These 
photocopies, after they have the beneficiary’s original signature on them, 
become the beneficiary’s assent to the account.
After obtaining assents from all the beneficiaries (and we do mean all the 
beneficiaries, including those people who aren’t currently receiving any dis-
tributions but may in the future), attach these signed documents to the front 
of your account, and keep the whole kit and caboodle together in permanent 
file (which you’re hopefully keeping in a fireproof safe). Figure 14-2 shows 
a sample cover page, with the assent line included, for the annual account 
shown in Figure 14-1.

Filing with the probate court
If your trust is governed by an instrument contained within the Last Will of 
the creator of the trust, you may file annual accounts with the probate court. 
In most cases, the annual account format shown in Figure 14-1 should be 
adequate, although you want to obtain the court’s specific guidelines prior to 
finalizing your account. Instead of using the cover sheet shown in Figure 14-2, 
you have to use the court’s cover, which you can obtain from the court by 
just showing up (one of the court officers will help you) or by requesting that 
they mail you a cover.

 Chapter 14: Creating and Keeping Trust Records
 
Despite the fact that the probate court is, in fact, a court, and despite the 
fact that annual accounts may be required for testamentary trusts, all the 
courts we’ve been involved with haven’t been exactly on top of us to get these 
accounts done and filed. Not getting pressure to file doesn’t waive the require-
ment to file, and much like teachers and late homework, when the court goes 
looking for an account that’s not there, they tend to get testy. If you must file 
accounts, prepare and file them in a timely fashion; finding all the financial 
records you need years after the fact is often difficult, and your memory of 
events may be spotty at best.

Chapter 15
Terminating the Trust
In This Chapter
▶ Making final income and principal distributions
▶ Planning for, and preparing, the final tax return
▶ Checking your crystal ball for future expenses
▶ Wrapping up the final account
A
ll good things must come to an end, and that includes trusts. A day 
will come when you’ve fulfilled all the terms of the trust and the need 
for it just goes away. This may happen when the income beneficiary dies 
or reaches a certain age, or all the principal has been spent. Whatever the 
reason, when the time comes for you to terminate the trust, you don’t just 
get to wash your hands and say, “I’m done.” Although the end scenario isn’t 
difficult, you do need to follow a few rules and perform a few rituals before 
you can walk away from your duties as trustee.
In this chapter, we tell you what needs doing and when you need to do it. We 
explain how to make those final distributions, prepare that last tax return, 
set aside something for those contingent expenses that always seem to crop 
up, and finally wrap a nice bow around the whole package with your final 
account, which should show zero balances in both income and principal on 
the last day.
Distributing All Assets According 
to the Trust Instrument
No matter what event triggers the termination of a trust, you need to find 
new homes for the remaining assets before you can wrap up its affairs. Of 
course, none of this division is left to your discretion; the trust instrument 
has the disposition of the remaining assets spelled out in neon. All you need 
to do is go back to the instrument and find those provisions.

220
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
The trust instrument spells out clearly who gets the principal when the 
income interest in that trust terminates. It may be the income beneficiary, 
who’s reached a certain age and becomes entitled to the principal. Or it may 
be some other person — perhaps the income beneficiary’s child, or some 
other descendant of the donor. The trust may even terminate in favor of 
one or more charities. These individuals are referred to as remaindermen. In 
fact, you may have any combination of events, with portions going in several 
directions. Your job, as trustee, is to determine how the remaining pie of 
assets gets split. This section spells out who receives the distributions.
 
Just because a trust is terminating as of a particular date doesn’t mean that 
you need to make all the final distributions on that date. Trusts can be compli-
cated, and doing the final wrap-up may take some time. Be patient, and move 
carefully. As long as you complete the business of the trust within a reason-
able length of time (and no one, as far as we know, has ever truly defined rea-
sonable), you’re on safe ground here.
Determining any final income distributions 
required for beneficiaries
Before you can distribute the principal to the remaindermen, you must be 
certain that all the income you’re required to distribute has, in fact, been col-
lected and distributed to the income beneficiary. Making this determination 
is easy if the income beneficiary and the remainderman are one and the same 
person because that individual will receive everything, no matter how it’s 
categorized. But if the principal is going to someone or someplace other than 
where you’ve been making income distributions, you have to pay any owed 
income before you can make distributions of principal.
 
How do you make the determination of how much you owe, if anything, to 
the income beneficiary? You do it all by dates. The income interest may end 
on the date the income beneficiary dies or turns a specific age, or after the 
trust has been in existence for a certain number of years. Read the instru-
ment and be sure that you’ve identified the correct date. After you know the 
date the trust officially terminates, you can then calculate the final payout. 
For example, if the income interest terminates on February 2, you need to 
pay out to the income beneficiary not only all the income still in the trust on 
that date but also all the income that the trust was entitled to receive by that 
date but that hadn’t yet been paid to the trust. So, if the trust owned QPWR 
Corporation stock, which said it would pay a dividend to its shareholders 
of record on February 1, but which wasn’t actually paying the dividend until 
February 10, you’d need to include that dividend in your final income cal-
culations, even though it wasn’t received by February 2. Any income that’s 

221
 Chapter 15: Terminating the Trust
accumulated in the trust prior to the termination date belongs to the income 
beneficiary. In addition, though, you’re going to make adjustments for the fol-
lowing items when terminating a trust:
 
✓ Accrued interest earned on any bonds held by the trust, or earned to 
the termination date in any bank accounts. Interest is earned on a daily 
basis, even though it’s paid only periodically.
 
✓ Stock dividends that are owed to the trust but haven’t yet been paid.
 
✓ Rents owed but not yet paid for the period from the end of the last 
rental period to the termination date.
 
✓ Partnership and business income from the date earned but not yet paid, 
through the termination date.
 
✓ State tax refunds attributable to income earned prior to the termination 
that are due but haven’t been received.
 
✓ Any other miscellaneous income earned but not yet received prior to 
the termination.
 
Although doing the research and making all these calculations yourself is pos-
sible if you’re only dealing with a few securities, save yourself the hassle and 
call your broker or a valuation service if the trust owns tens or even hundreds 
of securities. The amount you pay for the service is probably a pittance in 
comparison to the amount of time you spend doing the work yourself.
Holding back funds for 
final taxes and fees
Prior to fully terminating a trust, you need to ensure that you’ve put money 
aside to pay Uncle Sam and any other fees. Income needs to be reduced 
by any expenses accrued as of the termination date, such as trustee’s and 
investment advisor’s fees; state, local, and foreign taxes on income received 
and accrued; miscellaneous expenses; probate court costs (for filing annual 
accounts); and any other such fees attributable to the income earned in 
the trust as of that date. (Check out the later section, “Submitting the Final 
Income Tax Returns,” for more on submitting the final tax return.)
 
If you’ve collected all the income but haven’t yet paid all the expenses, you 
really don’t need to continue to keep all that income in the trust. Instead, 
determine how much you think you’ll need to pay the expenses and then pay 
out what remains to the income beneficiary. Be sure to estimate the expenses 
on the generous side; nothing is worse than having to ask the income benefi-
ciaries to repay money they’ve already spent. You can either hold the money 

222
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
you set aside for future expenses in a separate, non-interest-bearing, non-trust 
account (a popular choice of law firms) or you may keep one of the trust 
accounts open. Remember, though, that after you make this move, you don’t 
want to earn any additional income, especially after you’ve filed the final tax 
return. After you finish paying the expenses, the rest of that money should be 
promptly sent to the income beneficiary to close out the income side of the 
account.
Paying the remaindermen
When terminating a trust, you need to pay the remaindermen (the individual(s) 
or organization(s) named by the trust instrument to receive the remaining 
property after the trust’s income interest has ended) if there are still any 
assets left (securities, cash, real estate, or that all-important country club 
membership) after you’ve made final income distributions to the beneficiaries 
and paid all the necessary taxes and fees. To identify these individuals or 
entities, carefully study the trust instrument to determine who gets what and 
how much.
As trustee, you have to be certain that your allocation of trust assets among 
the remaindermen is equitable, but you’re not required to give each remain-
derman a proportionate piece of every asset. Typically, if trust principal is 
being divvied up into two or more pieces, the starting point for the division 
is the value of the assets on the trust’s termination date, or the date that the 
income beneficiary no longer is entitled to any more income. Thus, certain 
assets that are difficult to divide, such as real estate, or businesses, or even 
some stocks and bonds, don’t have to be sold in order to make sure that 
everyone is getting his or her exact proportionate share of every type of 
property. All that’s required is that the allocation of the total value of all the 
assets is exactly proportionate to the shares called for in the trust instrument 
(which may be unequal shares). So if Alvin is scheduled to receive 60 percent 
of the remainder, and his brother Calvin the remaining 40 percent, of a trust 
that’s worth $100,000 after the income interest ends, Alvin’s share is worth 
$60,000 and Calvin’s $40,000. It doesn’t matter what property you, as trustee, 
put into each of their shares to arrive at those final values. All that matters is 
that each receives property equal to his proportionate share.
 
Knowing how to make the calculations necessary to divide up the property is 
one thing; actually transferring those assets to the remaindermen is another. 
Although cash can be disposed of by writing a check, transferring many of the 
other assets held by the trust is slightly more complicated. Property may be 
transferred to the remaindermen in the following ways:

223
 Chapter 15: Terminating the Trust
 
✓ Stocks and bonds (publicly traded): Notify the broker holding the secu-
rities of the transfer by signing stock assignments to transfer ownership 
to the remaindermen. If you’re holding stock certificates in the name of 
the trust (and we sincerely hope you’re not), you have to deliver the cer-
tificates, either in person or by using registered mail together with stock 
assignments, to each of the companies, who then reregister the stock in 
the name of the remainderman.
 
✓ Stocks and bonds (privately held): Contact the companies directly. 
They’re most likely already aware of the transfer, and they’ll provide 
you with the necessary documents to effect the change.
 
✓ Real estate: Draft a new deed, transferring title from you (as trustee) to 
the remainderman receiving the property and then record the new deed 
with the county, city, or town where the property is located. You may 
want to consult an attorney to draft and record the new deed, to be cer-
tain that all the formalities of the real estate transfer are observed.
 
✓ Partnership interests: Contact the general partner of the partnership 
with the name and federal tax identification number or Social Security 
Number of the new partner. Be aware that many partnerships are run 
by professionals (in which case the transfer will likely happen almost 
seamlessly), but others are operated by scratching notes on the backs 
of envelopes. If you don’t receive confirmation that the transfer has hap-
pened, and you receive a Schedule K-1 from the partnership still in the 
name of the trust for a year following the transfer, make a nuisance of 
yourself. Sometimes the surest way to get results is to be the squeaky 
wheel.
 
✓ Royalty interests: If the trust has interests in natural resource leases, 
notify the manager of the change in ownership. Like with partnership 
interests, give them a reasonable amount of time to change their records 
and then feel free to become insistent. If the royalties in question derive 
from intellectual property, such as music or books, provide the pub-
lisher with the information he or she requires to change the ownership 
interest.
 
✓ Promissory notes or mortgages held by the trust: Often, the trust will 
have lent money to a beneficiary or remainderman and evidenced that 
loan with either a promissory note or a mortgage. If the promissory 
note in question has the trust as the lender and the remainder interest 
as the borrower, no transfer is required. Just subtract the outstanding 
loan amount from the total amount payable to that remainderman, and 
you’re in the clear. If, on the other hand, the loan was made to a third 
party, draft a new note and change the name of the lender, referencing 
the old note, and restating the terms. As with the real estate transfer, 
you may want to have an attorney assist you in making this change. And, 
if you’re dealing with a mortgage that’s been recorded, be sure that the 
attorney records the new mortgage and completes and files a mortgage 
discharge for the old.

224
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
We’ve said it before, but it’s worth saying again: Don’t guess at the worth 
of hard-to-value assets, such as real estate or business interests — obtain a 
professional appraisal as of the termination date. Of course, if you can simply 
give the hard-to-value asset proportionately to the remaindermen and they all 
agree, a formal appraisal isn’t necessary. For example, assume a trust owns an 
apartment building and has three remaindermen (children of the grantor). The 
remaindermen can agree to take a one-third interest in the apartment building 
and no appraisal is necessary. The remaindermen have been waiting a long 
time for their fair share of the trust’s principal; any inkling that one or more of 
them has been shortchanged, and things may get ugly for you in a hurry.
Submitting the Final Income Tax Returns
You can’t walk away from your duties as trustee until and unless you’ve 
filed a final Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts. 
Fortunately, you’re passing out all the tax liability to some or all of the 
income beneficiaries and remaindermen because you’re passing out all the 
income and assets to them. The final tax return for the trust is, typically, 
nothing more than an information return.
 
When preparing the final return, keep the following important points in mind:
 
✓ Make sure that you tick the Final Return box on the face of the return. 
And, in case you think the IRS may miss that little box, feel free to also 
write “Final Return” across the top of the first page in big red or black 
letters. We can’t begin to tell you the number of times we’ve received 
notices from the IRS looking for returns years after we filed the final one. 
Of course, just because it’s looking doesn’t mean you have to prepare 
and file one, but who wants to keep writing letters explaining why you’re 
no longer required to?
 
✓ Make sure that the return shows that the trust has reached zero tax-
able income and zero tax liability. No matter how you slice it, every 
final year return should reach the same conclusion: zero taxable income 
and zero tax liability. The zero taxable income is achieved in two 
ways — by passing out all items of income and deduction (including 
capital loss carryovers and net operating losses) to the beneficiaries 
and remaindermen on Schedule K-1, and by disallowing the exemption 
amount that would ordinarily be allowed on a non-final return. Zero tax 
liability then naturally results. So, if the return you’re preparing doesn’t 
meet those two criteria, you need to sit down and take another look.

225
 Chapter 15: Terminating the Trust
Chapter 18 explains how to complete Form 1041 in glorious detail. 
Remember to include all your deductions, even if you don’t have enough 
income to offset them; excess deductions on termination of a trust are appor-
tioned and distributed to all the recipients of Schedule K-1, and they can 
deduct them on Form 1040, Schedule A as a miscellaneous itemized deduc-
tion subject to the 2 percent adjusted gross income limitation. We explain 
how to prepare Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) in Chapter 19.
This section points out the final steps you may be required to take to ensure 
that the trust has met all its tax obligations. Not to worry, though — because 
you’ve been handling the trust’s taxes for a while already, all the information 
you need should be easy to access.
Determining any final tax liability
Just because the final Form 1041 shouldn’t have any income tax liability 
doesn’t mean that you may not still have some outstanding tax obligations, 
either from a prior year’s return or from a state or local government. You 
need to double-check and determine whether the trust has any final tax liabil-
ity, perhaps due to tax returns for prior years that haven’t yet been filed, 
an income tax audit that hasn’t been resolved, amended returns for prior 
year(s) that are still awaiting your attention, or even unpaid real estate taxes.
In order to make the determination, be sure that you have completed returns 
for each year of administration and that you have no knowledge of any open 
issues regarding any of them. Remember, if you’re receiving correspondence 
from the IRS or any state tax department, that’s a sure sign that you need 
to resolve a problem somewhere. Rough out any tax returns still to be com-
pleted or filed at the time the trust terminates its income interest so that 
you don’t receive any unpleasant surprises. Be sure to segregate any taxes 
you think you owe before making any payments to income beneficiaries or 
remaindermen. Remember, many trusts terminate in the first few months of 
a year, before you’ve finished the prior year’s tax returns. Even if the trust 
won’t owe any taxes on the final year return, the same can’t be said for the 
prior year’s return, the very return that may well be sitting, unfinished, on 
your desk.
Make payments of the taxes the trust owes before you begin making distribu-
tions to the remaindermen, even if you’re not absolutely certain of the final 
tax bill. If you only have a rough idea, generously estimate the payment, and 
send it in. If you know exactly how much the trust is on the line for, write that 
check and get it out of the way. Dealing with a tax refund is far easier than 
getting the remaindermen to cough up money to settle the trust’s tax liability.

226
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
Filing a short-year return
Trusts rarely terminate on December 31. Accordingly, the last year of the 
trust’s existence will most likely be a short year (less than 12 months), and 
you may want to file a short-year return. Using a short-year return allows you 
to conclude the trust’s business in a timely fashion instead of allowing prepa-
ration of that final return to hang over your head for months after you’ve 
completed all your other trust-related tasks. Short-year returns are prepared 
just like any other return, with two exceptions:
 
✓ You’re allowed to use the prior year’s tax form if the current year’s form 
isn’t yet available. If current year forms aren’t yet available, you may 
want to superimpose the correct year over the printed prior year.
 
✓ You must fill in the dates of the short year at the top of the return.
 
If you opt to use a short year for the final return, don’t forget that the return is 
still due three and one-half months after the end of the year you’ve chosen. So, 
if you elect to end the year on November 30, your short-year return is now due 
on March 15, not April 15.
Preparing Final Accounting and 
Obtaining Assent of All Remaindermen
You’ve distributed the final income amounts, paid all the last expenses, and filed 
the final tax returns. You’re almost done — but not quite. You’re not allowed to 
move your trusteeship into the completed column until you do one last thing: 
prepare a final account and obtain assents from all the remaindermen.
Finally finishing a non-probate trust
You prepare this final account just like all the others you’ve prepared up 
until now. You’ll know this is the final account because you’ll mark it Final 
on the cover page, and Schedules C and F will show zero balances. As you 
prepare this account and then obtain the signatures of the beneficiaries, keep 
the following in mind:

227
 Chapter 15: Terminating the Trust
 
1. Don’t discontinue preparing your annual accounts just because the 
income interest in the trust has ended.
 
 It may take years after the income interest has terminated before you 
actually get to prepare the final account. Sometimes, even though the 
trust is terminating, the assets remaining don’t transfer to the remain-
dermen for a very long time. So long as you’re responsible for any 
assets, you need to account for them. The good news (you knew it was 
coming) is that trusts that are in the process of terminating aren’t usu-
ally very active, so the annual accounts are much less involved than 
they were when you still had income beneficiaries to worry about.
 
2. After you prepare the final account and sign the cover page, give it to 
all the remaindermen to sign off on.
 
 You don’t need to have the income beneficiaries sign off on your 
accounts after the income interest has expired.
 
 You may want to have an attorney draft the final assent letter, one that 
the remaindermen sign, that releases your liability with acceptance of 
the distribution. Nothing is worse than when a trustee releases all the 
assets and fails to obtain assents, only to be sued later when the trust 
no longer has any assets.
 
 After you’ve obtained the necessary assents in the manner described in 
Chapter 14, you’re finally finished. Congratulations!
 
Be sure to provide copies of accounts to beneficiaries and remaindermen 
when you ask for their assent. And keep the originals of all the accounts, 
including this final one, and all the signed assents permanently. In a case of 
better-safe-than-sorry, you can never be certain when someone will raise a 
question regarding your period of trusteeship; with the accounts and signed 
assents in hand, you have proof not only that the beneficiaries or remainder-
men have prior knowledge of your acts as trustee but also that they assented 
to them at the time.
Polishing off a probate trust
Prepare the final probate account in the same manner as you would a non-
probate account, and attach the official probate court cover to it. Here are a 
few things to keep in mind:

228
Part III: Operating a Revocable or Irrevocable Trust 
 
✓ Be sure to mark the account not only by its number but also as Final 
(The Fifteenth and Final Account of Jane Smith, Trustee). Sign the cover 
page as trustee.
 
✓ Like the non-probate trust account, you need to obtain assents from all 
the remaindermen before you can officially close the trust. Usually, the 
probate court provides you with its official assent form to use for this 
purpose.
 
✓ Be sure, when mailing assents out to the remaindermen, that you send 
them either registered or certified mail, and that you request return 
receipts. Doing so ensures that if one or more remaindermen is balky in 
providing the requested signature, you have proof for the probate court 
that you sent the form and that the obstinate remainderman did receive it.
After you receive all the assents, you may choose to have your accounts 
allowed by the probate court. If you opt for allowance, the probate judge will 
review your administration from the filing of the probate inventory through 
all the annual accounts and ending with the final account. He or she will 
review the size of the fees that you took for your administration, as well as 
make sure that income was distributed as required and that the trust princi-
pal was distributed in accordance with the instrument. Allowance isn’t abso-
lutely required, but if you choose to go that route, it never hurts to know that 
the probate court, under whose auspices you administered this particular 
trust, approved your administration.
 
If, when you petition the probate court to have your accounts allowed, any 
of the income beneficiaries or remaindermen are minors or are otherwise 
incompetent to legally act for themselves, the court may require that you have 
a guardian ad litem (literally, a guardian for this matter only) appointed to 
protect his or her interest. In theory, having someone who’s otherwise uncon-
nected to the trust and the family protecting the minor’s interest isn’t a bad 
thing; in practice, the court typically appoints a lawyer as guardian — someone 
who asks lawyerly questions and charges lawyerly fees. Although you can’t 
always avoid the appointment of a guardian ad litem, try to steer clear of this 
step whenever you can by filing your accounts when they’re due but waiting 
until all the income beneficiaries and remainderman are of legal age and capac-
ity before you ask the court for allowance.

Part IV
Paying the Taxes

In this part . . .
O
ne of the inevitabilities of life — taxes — is nowhere 
more apparent than when dealing with estates and 
trusts. No matter what you do or how you do it, you need 
to examine the tax consequences of your decisions. You 
may have estate taxes that need to be paid after a dece-
dent dies, or income taxes owed by an estate, a trust, or 
even by the decedent him- or herself. In fact, so many 
types of taxes may be triggered by death or by funding a 
trust that you may not even be aware some of them 
existed before you assumed your role as fiduciary.
In this part, we clue you in — in plain English — on just 
how to complete some of the most common types of tax 
returns, including the estate tax return, and the income 
tax return for estates and trusts. We also show you how to 
report tax information to estate and trust beneficiaries, 
both when you’re required to file an income tax return for 
the estate or trust and when you’re not.

Chapter 16
Preparing the Estate 
Tax Return, Part 1
In This Chapter
▶ Determining whether your estate needs to file
▶ Filling out pages 1–3 of the estate tax return
▶ Deciding which elections to take
▶ Taking the final steps after you’ve filed the return
“N
othing’s certain in life apart from death and taxes.” Ben Franklin 
said it, and it’s generally true. Although death is unfortunately inev-
itable, the federal estate tax isn’t if the decedent’s estate (the property owned 
by the deceased person on his or her date of death) is small enough. For 
decedents passing away in 2008, the amount exempt from federal estate tax 
is $2 million and in 2009, that amount increases to $3.5 million. We discuss 
later in this chapter what is scheduled to happen after that, but who knows? 
Congress may rewrite the rules and change the exempt amounts.
The federal estate tax, sometimes mistakenly referred to as the death tax, is 
a tax on the value of all the decedent’s property at date of death, minus any 
amounts owed by the decedent but unpaid at that time, funeral costs, and 
costs of administering the estate. It’s not a tax on a share received by any 
particular beneficiary, and no beneficiary pays any gift or estate tax on what 
he or she receives. The executor or administrator pays any estate tax owed 
from estate assets nine months after the decedent’s date of death.
In this chapter, you find out how to decide whether you must file a Form 706, 
United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return for the 
estate, and whether any tax is due. With the information located here, you 
can prepare the opening pages of the 706, make the appropriate elections for 
the estate, compute the tax, and file the return.

232
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Figuring Out Which Estates Must File
The good news is that making the decision about which estates must file is 
easy. Uncle Sam already made the decision; most estates need not file an 
estate tax return at all. Read on to see whether you can dodge this particular 
bullet or need to start filling out the forms.
Who must file
The IRS estimates that only a small number of estates are required to file. So 
how do you figure out whether the estate you’re administering falls into that 
category? The answer depends on the size of the gross estate, or the total 
value of everything the decedent owned as of date of death, and the year in 
which he or she died. If, for example, you’re administering an estate for a 
decedent who died in 2008, you don’t need to worry unless the gross estate is 
worth more than $2 million. In 2009, that number rises to $3.5 million.
 
Of course, figuring out whether you must file is never quite that simple. In 
order to help you make an accurate determination whether you have to file a 
Form 706 for the estate, you need to also consider
 
✓ What the decedent gave away over his or her lifetime as gifts: The 
decedent’s most recent gift tax return (Form 709), if any, lists all gifts 
he or she made during lifetime that need to be added back. If you can’t 
locate the decedent’s most recent 709, you can request a copy from the 
IRS by using Form 4506. (Check out Chapter 7 for how to do so).
 
✓ Whether the decedent’s estate looks like it could be anywhere close 
to the exempt amount for the year in question: If so, you need to do 
all the valuation calculations we explain in this chapter and Chapter 17 
to be sure that you don’t need to file, including getting appraisals 
where necessary. Filling out drafts of the schedules is a helpful way 
to accomplish this.
 
At the time we’re writing this book, the estate tax is scheduled to disappear 
for one year in 2010, only to reappear in 2011 with much higher tax rates and 
much lower limits on gross estates. Of course, nothing is ever written in stone 
until you actually get there (and sometimes not even then). So, check care-
fully before you begin preparing a Form 706 to make sure that one is actually 
required. The easiest place to check is the IRS itself at www.irs.gov — nothing 
like the horse’s mouth. Look for Publication 950, Introduction to Estate and 
Gift Taxes, for the amounts applicable to the year in which your decedent died.

233
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Who actually files the 706 for the estate? As the executor, administrator, or 
personal representative of the decedent’s estate, you’re responsible for filing 
the706 if the gross estate is larger than the applicable exclusion amount for 
the year in question. If the estate has no appointed executor, administrator,
 or personal representative, and you’re a trustee in actual or constructive 
possession (you have control over the property even if it’s not held in the 
trustee’s name) of any of the decedent’s property, you’re responsible for any 
required Form 706.
The estate tax is due in full nine months after the decedent’s date of death 
unless you request and are granted an election under section 6166 of the 
IRS Code to pay in installments, or under section 6163 to pay the part of the 
tax attributable to a reversionary or remainder interest at a later time. (See 
“Electing to pay the tax in installments” and “Electing to postpone taxes” 
later in this chapter for more info on sections 6166 and 6163, respectively.)
 
If the tax you’re paying with the return differs from the amount that the return 
shows is due, attach a statement to the return explaining the difference. If 
you’ve already made payments to the IRS, attach a statement to the return to 
that effect.
When to file
If the estate must file an estate tax form, file the 706 and pay the estate tax 
and any generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax nine months after the dece-
dent’s date of death. However, you may file an extension of time to file Form 
4768 (discussed in “Extensions of time to file and pay tax” later in this chap-
ter) by the due date for filing the return. We discuss the GST tax in Schedule 
R in Chapter 17.
Reaching the applicable exclusion amount
Don’t worry, the applicable exclusion amount 
(the amount of the decedent’s assets you can 
actually exclude from estate tax) is a rather 
difficult concept. Lucky for you, you never 
have to make this computation. It’s all done for 
you on page one (the cover page) of the Form 
706 by means of a credit subtracted from the 
gross estate tax calculated. So for example, in 
2008, the applicable credit subtracts $780,800 
from the gross estate tax, which shelters the 
first $2 million of the taxable estate. In 2009, 
the applicable credit increases to $1,455,800, 
which shelters the first $3.5 million of the tax-
able estate. Unless Congress acts, the estate 
tax goes on vacation in 2010, and in 2011, the 
applicable credit applied to the estate tax drops 
back down to $292,000, which shelters the first 
$1 million of the taxable estate.

234
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Obtaining a Release from 
Personal Liability
Whether you filed the decedent’s 706 as executor or trustee, you always want 
to obtain a release from personal liability under code section 2204 (do the 
same for the decedent’s income and gift tax returns). That’s because, even if 
the estate or trust is later found to be liable for additional tax, perhaps due 
to assets discovered years later, for instance, if you’ve obtained the release 
from personal liability, you aren’t personally liable for the tax. Send a letter 
to the IRS in your capacity as executor or trustee and as the person charged 
with filing the Form 706, requesting that the IRS set the estate tax and dis-
charge you from personal liability.
After the IRS receives your request, it has nine months to act on it. As soon 
as you pay the tax the IRS assesses, you’re released from personal liability for 
any tax deficiency later discovered. You’re then free to pay other debts and 
expenses of the decedent — which come after the federal estate tax in prior-
ity of payment — and distribute the assets. Even if an asset appears later, 
you’re off the hook; if additional tax is later assessed after you’ve distributed 
the assets, the estate or the beneficiaries will be liable, not you.
Understanding Some of the Nitty-Gritty 
Rules for Filing the Form 706
You need to know some basic rules for how and where to file the Form 706, 
how to pay the tax, how to get an extension of time to file or pay tax, and 
what documents to file with the return. That’s what we give you here.
Where and how to file
You pay the appropriate estate tax nine months after the decedent’s date of 
death. Send the completed tax form to Department of the Treasury, Internal 
Revenue Service Center, Cincinnati, Ohio 45999. Use either certified mail or 
a private delivery service that can provide you with documentation. The IRS 
accepts the following delivery services:

235
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
 
✓ DHL Express (DHL): DHL Same Day Service, DHL Next Day 10:30 am, 
DHL Next Day 12PM, DHL Next Day 3:00 PM, and DHL Second Day 
Service.
 
✓ Federal Express (FedEx): Fed Ex Priority Overnight, FedEx Standard 
Overnight, FedEx 2 Day, FedEx International First
 
✓ United Parcel Service (UPS): UPS Next Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, 
UPS 2nd Day Air AM, UPS Worldwide Express Plus, and UPS Worldwide 
Express
 
Be sure to get written proof of the mailing date from the delivery service, 
because that day is considered the date of filing and of payment of the tax.
How to pay the tax
In order to pay the estate tax, you basically have two options:
 
✓ By check, bank draft, or money order: Make it payable to “United 
States Treasury.” Be sure to include on the check the decedent’s name, 
Social Security Number, and the words “Form 706,” which indicates to 
the IRS what tax you are paying and for whom.
 
✓ By credit card or debit card: Go to www.irs.gov and enter “pay taxes 
by credit card” in the search box. Clicking on the first search result 
gives you a list of all the service providers you may use, their fees, and 
their Web sites and telephone numbers.
 
 Be aware that their convenience fees can be substantial for credit cards 
(between 2.49 and 3.93 percent of the tax payment at the time of this 
writing). You may find it much more prudent to make sure that you have 
the funds available to write that check than to explain to the heirs or 
a judge reviewing your estate accounting why you incurred the conve-
nience fee.
Penalties for late filing, late payment, 
and understatement of valuation
Do all you can to file your 706 by the due date (as extended) and pay the tax 
on time, because you incur penalties for late filing and late payment unless 
you can show reasonable cause for the delay. If you’re filing the 706 after the 
due date and any extensions, be sure to attach an explanation to the return 

236
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
to try to show reasonable cause. In addition, you pay interest on the amount 
of tax due from the due date for filing until the tax is paid, unless you’ve 
applied for and received an extension of time to pay the tax as discussed 
below.
 
Absolutely nothing is worse than getting slammed with penalties because the 
IRS catches you undervaluing assets. Not only do you have to pay the addi-
tional tax, but valuation understatements that result in tax increases of more 
than $5,000 also cost you a whopping 20 percent penalty. The IRS defines a 
valuation understatement as reporting the property’s value as 65 percent or 
less of its actual value on the Form 706. The penalty jumps to 40 percent for 
property valued at 40 percent or less of actual market value. And if you think 
you like your chances of avoiding an audit, think again. In 2006, although audit 
rates on individual income tax returns hovered around 1 percent, the IRS 
examined almost 10 percent of all Forms 706. For estates reporting values of 
5 million dollars or more, that rate rose to more than 23 percent. Valuations 
aren’t places to cut corners or hope to get lucky, although you certainly want 
to use the lowest valuation supportable, in most cases.
 
When might a higher valuation be beneficial to the estate? When the estate 
doesn’t owe any estate tax anyway; the value at which the property is 
included on the 706 is its new “stepped-up” cost basis for income tax pur-
poses. See Chapter 18 for a discussion of the step-up in basis of a decedent’s 
property to the date-of-death value for purposes of computing capital gains.
Signature and verification
List all executors or administrators on the return if you’re dealing with more 
than one, because you’re all responsible for the return’s contents. You’re 
also all liable for any penalties for erroneous or false returns. However, only 
one of you, as coexecutor, is required to sign the return regardless of how 
many of you are on the team. We strongly recommend that all coexecutors 
sign the return if at all possible so that it’s clear to each of you that you’re all 
liable for the return as it’s filed. Relying on one coexecutor who is knowledge-
able in 706 preparation to prepare the return is fine, as long as everyone else 
thoroughly reviews the return, asking any and all questions they may have. 
Feel free to ask to see the backup information!
 
The executor who prepares the return must sign the declaration on page 1 
under penalty of perjury. If you rely on a paid preparer, such as an attorney, 
accountant, or enrolled agent, to prepare the return, they must also sign and 
complete the preparer info on page 1 of the return.

237
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Extensions of time to file and pay tax
Sometimes you may need a few extra months to get everything squared away 
with the estate before you can file the 706. If you need an extension, send 
your extension request to the Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue 
Service Center, Cincinnati, OH 45999, no later than the original due date for 
the return (nine months after date of death). File Form 4768, Extension of 
Time to File a Return and/or Pay U. S. Estate (and Generation- Skipping 
Transfer) Taxes to apply for extensions of both time to file and time to pay.
Extension of time to file
You receive a six-month automatic extension of time to file with regard to 
Forms 706, 706-A, 706-D, 706-NA, and 706-QDT as long as you file the exten-
sion request by the due date and include payment of the estimated amount of 
the estate tax (or generation-skipping transfer tax). Just check the applicable 
box in Part II of the form.
 
If you have multiple executors or administrators, only one of you needs to 
file, or you can have your authorized attorney, certified public accountant, 
enrolled agent, or agent holding power of attorney file for you.
You may apply for a discretionary additional extension of time to file the 706 
only if you are an executor and are out of the country. Attach a statement 
explaining why it’s impossible or impractical to file the 706 by the due date.
Amending Form 706
You often discover additional assets or expenses 
that you should have included on the Form 706 
long after you file it. If you come across assets 
or deductions after filing the Form 706 and 
within the assessment period (three years from 
the date of filing the 706, or six years if the addi-
tional assets represent more than a 25 percent 
increase over the gross estate as it was origi-
nally reported, except in two instances; if there 
is fraud committed in the filing of the 706 or no 
706 is filed, there is no statute of limitations), or 
if you need to make any other allowable change 
to the return, you can amend it as follows:
 1. Prepare and file another 706, typing 
“Supplemental Information” across the top 
of page 1 the form.
 2. Attach copies of pages 1, 2, and 2 of the 706 
as originally filed.
If the return is being audited, send the information 
directly to the IRS office conducting the audit. 

238
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
If you don’t file for an automatic extension of time to file by the due date of 
the return, all is not lost. You can still file for an extension of time to file if 
you can show good and sufficient cause (although there’s no definition given 
for this phrase used in the 706 instructions, be sure to attach a statement 
explaining why you weren’t able to apply for an automatic extension, why 
it was impossible or impractical to file by the due date, and why the exten-
sion should be granted), but the extension, if granted, is for no more than six 
months after the due date of the return.
Extension of time to pay
You may also use the Form 4768 to apply for an extension of time to pay the 
estate tax under section 6161 of the IRS Code (a discretionary extension of 
time to pay for reasonable cause), for a section 6163 election (reversionary 
or remainder interest), or for a section 6166 election (closely held business). 
We discuss sections 6163 and 6166 later.
Filing the IRS Power of Attorney and Declaration
of Representative (Form 2848)
You may find it valuable to file a Form 2848, 
Power of Attorney and Declaration of 
Representative, with the IRS as executor or 
administrator, appointing an attorney, certi-
fied public accountant, enrolled agent, family 
member, or someone else who prepared the 
tax return in question to act in your behalf with 
regard to some or all the decedent’s tax mat-
ters. Form 2848 may be filed at any time after 
your appointment as executor or administrator. 
If you file a Form 2848, be sure to attach a copy 
to Form 706 as an exhibit.
You may find it convenient to have someone 
available who can deal with the IRS in your 
behalf, and you can add powers not already 
listed on the Form 2848 or delete any you don’t 
want to bestow. You can also rescind the power 
of attorney at any time. If you have different tax 
preparers for different types of returns, you may 
want to have a separate Form 2848 for each.
Keep in mind that the Form 706 contains its own 
version of a power of attorney, specific to that 
return, in part 4 under General Information. 
However, you can name only one person (who 
must be an attorney, certified public accoun-
tant, or enrolled agent), and that person can’t 
enter into agreements with the IRS in your 
behalf regarding the Form 706, unlike a person 
appointed under the Form 2848, making the 
Form 2848 more useful to you in obtaining a 706 
closing letter.
Ongoing legislative discussion proposes to 
limit the appointees under a Form 2848 to attor-
neys, certified public accountants, and enrolled 
agents. If and when this happens, Form 2848 will 
be adapted to reflect those changes, so be sure 
you’re using the most current version of the 
form, which you can find at www.irs.gov 
under the “Forms and Publications” category.

239
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Supplemental documents
Completing the 706 may seem bad enough to you, but you probably have a 
pile of supporting documentation that you need to send with it. If you do, 
attach whichever of the following documents are applicable in your dece-
dent’s estate to the return when you file it. Consider preparing an index, 
or list, of exhibits. Attach the index directly behind the 706 and label each 
of the documents on its face as Exhibit A, Exhibit B, and so on. Using index 
tabs for each exhibit is also a terrific idea. Also, when referring to each of the 
attached documents in the 706, you can give them specific names (Exhibit A, 
Exhibit B, and so on) for clarity. The clearer you make things for the IRS, the 
happier it’ll be as it reviews your tax return (and the more comfortable it’ll 
be that you’re disclosing everything)!
Among the documents to attach to the return are
 
✓ A certified copy of the decedent’s death certificate (required in all 
cases). Chapter 5 explains how to obtain copies of the death certificate.
 
✓ A certified copy of the will, if the decedent died with a will. You obtain 
certified copies of the will from the court where the will was filed for 
probate. If you’re unable to get a certified copy, attach an uncertified 
copy and explain why it’s not certified.
 
✓ IRS Power of Attorney (Form 2848). See the sidebar, “Filing the IRS 
Power of Attorney and Declaration of Representative (Form 2848),” later 
in this chapter for more info.
 
✓ Receipt for payment of state inheritance or estate tax. See Chapter 2 and 
Appendix B regarding state estate and inheritance taxes.
 
✓ Appraisals of property. See Chapters 7 and 17 for more info.
 
✓ Life insurance statements (Forms 712). See Schedule D discussion in 
Chapter 17.
 
✓ Gift tax returns (Forms 709).
 
✓ Certificates of Payment of Foreign Death Tax (Forms 706-CE). See 
Chapter 17.
 
✓ Copies of trust instruments.
 
✓ For closely held businesses (see Chapter 7), earnings statements and 
balance sheets.

240
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Chapter 17 discusses when you need to attach these documents while using 
the individual schedules of the 706.
If the decedent was a U S citizen but not a resident, you need to attach the 
following additional documentation:
 
✓ A copy of the property inventory and schedule of liabilities, claims 
against the estate, and administration expenses as filed with the foreign 
court, certified by the appropriate official of the foreign court
 
✓ If the estate is subject to a foreign tax, a copy of the tax return filed 
under the foreign death tax act, whether estate, inheritance, succession, 
legacy, or otherwise
 
✓ A copy of the will, if the decedent died testate (with a valid will)
Completing the Form 706, Pages 1–3
If the estate you’re administering requires a 706 for any reason, you must 
complete the first three pages, together with all the other schedules needed to 
report your decedent’s assets, deductions, exclusions, and credits. This sec-
tion helps you determine which schedules apply to your decedent’s situation.
 
If a schedule doesn’t give you enough space (and it often doesn’t), attach a 
continuation schedule directly behind it. A continuation schedule is simply a 
blank schedule that you can use as an additional page for any other schedule 
in the return. One of us prepared a Form 706 with 17 pages filled with $50 U.S. 
Savings Bonds. A blank continuation schedule is contained as part of the 706. 
Make as many copies as you need.
Part 1: Decedent and Executor
On the face of the Form 706, fill in the decedent’s name, address, Social 
Security Number, year domicile (residence) was established in the decedent’s 
state of residence, date of birth, and date of death. On line 6a, list the execu-
tor you want to have contacted by the IRS; list any additional executors on 
an attached sheet as an exhibit and refer to it here. The rest of Part 1 is fairly 
self-explanatory.

241
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Part 2: Tax Computation
So far, so good. But now you get to start with some numbers, or so you may 
think. But wait — although this section is on the first page of the return, you 
really can’t do anything with it until you’ve completed everything else. So, if 
you’re just beginning, skip ahead to Part 3 (the next section). If you’ve com-
pleted all the other schedules and parts and are now ready to put this baby 
to bed, read on.
On lines 1–20, enter the figures indicated to arrive at the total transfer 
taxes due, if any. We highlight here anything we feel isn’t self-explanatory 
or included in the Instructions for Form 706 (Rev. September, 2007) (“the 
Instructions”).
 
✓ Line 3: The state death tax deduction referred to on line 3b is available 
if estate, inheritance, succession, or legacy taxes are paid to any state or 
the District of Columbia as a result of the decedent’s death.
 
✓ Line 4: Enter adjusted taxable gifts (total taxable gifts made by the decedent 
after December 31, 1976, other than gifts includible in decedent’s estate). 
If the gifts are includible in the decedent’s estate, you’ve included them 
in the number in line 1. Use the Line 4 Worksheet TG — Taxable Gifts 
Reconciliation on page 4 of the Instructions. You need the decedent’s 709s 
to complete the worksheet. Keep in mind that, besides any gifts reported 
on 709s, you must include any taxable gifts from prior years that you’re 
aware of that weren’t reported on 709s but should have been. To the 
extent that you come across gifts from earlier years in the decedent’s 
papers that weren’t reported, keep a tally year by year to see if they’re 
taxable. The annual exclusion amount (the amount that can be gifted 
without incurring any gift tax) has changed over the years, so you need 
to look on the instructions for that particular year’s 709; you can 
download it at www.irs.gov or call the IRS forms line at 800-829-3676.
 
✓ Line 7: Enter the total gift tax paid or payable by the decedent on gifts 
made by the decedent after December 31, 1976. Include gift taxes paid 
by the decedent’s spouse for that spouse’s share of split gifts (gifts made 
by one spouse that are divided 50/50 between both spouses on their gift 
tax returns) only if the decedent was the donor of the gifts and they are 
includible in the decedent’s gross estate. Use the Line 7 Worksheet — 
Gift Tax on Gifts Made After 1976 on page 5 of the Instructions. Page 6 of 
the Instructions discusses split gifts further.

242
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
✓ Line 10: Enter adjustments, if any, to the unified credit (applicable credit 
amount). You have adjustments only if the decedent (or the decedent’s 
spouse, in the case of split gifts) made gifts after September 8, 1976, and 
before January 1, 1977, for which he or she claimed a specific exemption. 
If so, the unified credit (applicable credit amount) on the estate tax return 
is reduced. Compute the reduction by entering 20 percent of the specific 
exemption that was claimed for these gifts.
 
✓ Line 13: Enter any credit for foreign death taxes from Schedule P and 
attach Form(s) 706-CE.
 
✓ Line 15: Add lines 13 and 14 to arrive at the total credit. In addition to 
using line 15 to report the totals of line 13, credit for foreign death taxes, 
and line 14, credit for tax on prior transfers, you may also use it to take 
a credit for pre-1977 federal gift taxes under a formula laid out on page 6 
of the Instructions. If you do so, be sure to identify the credit and make 
a note on the dotted line to the left of the entry, noting it as a “section 
2012 credit.” You may refer to the regulations under section 2012 for 
more information, but you may also want to see your tax advisor at this 
juncture! Also complete and attach Form 4808, Computation of Credit 
for Gift Tax.
 
 You may also use line 15 to claim the Canadian marital credit under 
the 1995 Canadian Protocol. When doing so, enter the credit on line 15 
and make a note on the dotted line to the left of the entry, noting it as a 
“Canadian marital credit.” Also attach a statement as an exhibit to the 
return referring to the treaty, waiving QDOT rights, and showing the 
computation of the credit. You can see the Canadian income tax treaty 
protocol for details on computing the credit, and by this point, you’re 
probably also visiting your tax advisor!
Congratulations! Assuming you’ve done all the math to arrive at line 20, 
you’ve now completed the 706, which is no small accomplishment!
Signature of executor(s)
We recommend that all executor(s) or administrator(s) sign and date the 
return at the bottom of page 1, although only one signature is required. If 
none exist, the person(s) holding assets who is/are filing the return, such as 
the trustee(s) of a trust, sign.

243
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Signature of preparer other 
than the executor
If someone other than the person or entity signing the return above prepares 
the return, he or she signs the return here and completes it in accordance 
with the Instructions.
Part 3: Elections by the Executor
Not every election requires a campaign. In Part 3, you must decide whether to 
make four important elections, if they apply to your decedent and would be of 
benefit to your estate. Each carries with it an IRS Code section reference — as 
you know, the IRS never runs out of numbers! Consider each thoroughly to see 
whether the facts fit your decedent’s estate.
Alternate valuation
Alternate valuation, which you elect on line 1, Part 3 of Form 706, is probably 
the most commonly used election. This election allows you to value the prop-
erty of the estate, in general, as of six months after the date of death rather 
than as of the date of death. Using it protects the estate from paying tax on 
the date-of-death value of the assets if the estate’s total value has dropped 
steeply six months after death, before the estate tax is even due. If elected, it 
applies to all assets; you can’t pick and choose which ones to apply it to. And 
you can elect it only on the return as originally filed, and only if it decreases 
both the gross estate and the total of the estate and GST taxes. After you 
make the election, you can’t revoke it. Finally, if you elect alternate valuation, 
you must still show every asset’s date-of-death value.
 
✓ Property distributed, sold, exchanged, or disposed of in any other 
way within six months after the date of death: Value it as of the date of 
distribution, sale, or other disposition.
 
✓ Property still in the decedent’s estate as of six months after the date of 
death: Value it as of that six month date. If no date in that sixth month 
corresponds to the decedent’s date of death, use the last day of the 
sixth month.
 
✓ Property that changes value due to the mere lapse of time: Value it as 
of the date of death or as of the date it’s distributed, sold, exchanged, or 
otherwise disposed of.

244
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
If you elect alternate valuation, don’t include increases or decreases from 
either the date-of-death value or the alternate value that are due entirely to 
the lapse of time. For example, at the date of death, a bond is worth not only 
the market value of the bond but also the value of accrued (accumulated but 
not yet paid) interest owed to the bondholder (the decedent) at that date. In 
the case of alternate valuation, only the market value of the bond changes to 
the value six months after death; the accrued interest on the bond remains 
the same as it was on the date of death. Similarly, rent accrued to the date 
of death on leased real or personal property of the estate goes in the gross 
estate, but rent accrued after the date of death does not. You include divi-
dends that were declared to shareholders of record on or before the date 
of death in your alternate valuation calculations, but you don’t include divi-
dends declared after the date of death.
The exception to this last example: When dividends declared after date of 
death affect the number of shares of stock so that they no longer reflect 
the same property as they did at the date of death, include their value at 
the alternate valuation date for alternate valuation purposes (unless these 
dividends are paid from earnings of the corporation after the date of death). 
Although this scenario may seem fairly arcane, it happens more frequently 
than you may think because corporations often dilute the number of shares 
with stock splits, and somewhat less frequently, spinoff baby companies from 
the parent or issue stock dividends.
Special use valuation
The special use valuation election allows you to value real estate at its actual 
use rather than its highest and best use under certain circumstances (think 
family farm versus land for a new subdivision of mansions); you may elect 
to value real property the decedent owned that the decedent or a family 
member used in the operation of a family farm or closely held business for 
a certain number of years prior to the decedent’s death at its farm or busi-
ness use value rather than at its presumably higher fair market value, under 
Section 2032A of the Internal Revenue Code.
 
And, you even have the option of electing both alternate valuation and special 
use valuation with regard to the property. Because you must meet a number 
of conditions in order for the real property to qualify for special use valua-
tion, you most likely want to discuss this election with a qualified tax preparer 
instead of tackling it on your own, both to see if your real estate qualifies and 
because not meeting any one condition can invalidate the election!
Electing to pay the tax in installments
 
If you elect installment payments, consult with a qualified tax preparer to 
ensure that you meet all the conditions.

245
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
 
In one of the quirks of the tax code, if the estate qualifies for installment pay-
ments under Section 6166, the interest payments are deductible on Form 1041, 
despite the prohibition against deducting personal interest on income tax 
returns. A major difference between income tax for estates and trusts and for 
individuals is that you’re allowed deductions on fiduciary income tax returns 
for expenses that you’ve paid solely because it’s an estate or trust, even if 
that same expense isn’t deductible on an individual return. So, even though 
Section 6166 interest is personal interest, similar to credit card interest, you’re 
paying it because you elected an option available only to estates; therefore, it’s 
deductible for income tax purposes.
Electing to postpone taxes
On line 4, Part 3 of Form 706, you may elect, under Section 6163 of the 
Internal Revenue Code, to postpone the tax on any future interests (rever-
sionary or remainder) until six months after the termination of the precedent 
interest (interest which comes before the reversionary or remainder inter-
est) in the property. And you can request a further extension of a reasonable 
period up to three years after the original extension for reasonable cause.
Reversionary and remainder interests are each a right to the future enjoy-
ment of property which is being used by another at present. (See Chapter 17 
for more info on these two interests on Schedule F.)
You should consider making this election if the estate will otherwise be left 
short of cash by paying the tax currently, and if the reversionary or remain-
der interest makes up a sizeable portion of the taxable estate. If you make the 
election, you must post a bond to the IRS for twice the amount of the tax and 
estimated interest.
Part 4: General Information
You only began telling the IRS about the decedent in Part 1. Now you really 
have a chance to fill out the picture in Part 4.
The first item under Part 4: General Information on Page 2 of the return is 
the authorization to receive confidential tax information, act as the estate’s 
representative before the IRS, and make written or oral presentations on 
behalf of the estate. If the return was prepared by an attorney, accountant, 
or enrolled agent, he or she signs it and fills out all the necessary informa-
tion. Remember, only one such person can be appointed here. If you want to 
appoint more than one, appoint someone other than an attorney, CPA, or EA; 
or appoint someone with the power to enter into closing agreements with the 
IRS regarding the estate and the 706, use Form 2848, Power of Attorney and 
Declaration of Representative, instead. (See the nearby sidebar for more 
information on filing this form.)

246
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
✓ Line 4: You must complete line 4, whether or not the decedent has a sur-
viving spouse. For no spouse, simply enter “none” in line 4a, and leave 
4b and 4c blank. Otherwise, in line 4c, “Amount received,” enter the 
amount the surviving spouse actually receives. If exact amounts aren’t 
available, as with future interests, a reasonable estimate (for instance, 
from actuarial tables) can be used.
 
✓ Line 5: Include all individuals (other than the surviving spouse), 
trusts, and estates who receive more than $5,000 in benefits from the 
estate either directly (as an heir, devisee, or legatee) or indirectly (for 
instance, as beneficiary of an insurance policy). Don’t include charities 
listed on Schedule O here (see Chapter 17 for more info). Include the fol-
lowing information about each entity:
 
• Name.
 
• Social Security or (in the case of a trust or estate) taxpayer identifi-
cation number (TIN) in the column headed “Identifying number.”
 
• Relationship to the decedent in the column by that name (for 
example, “daughter” or “decedent’s revocable trust”).
 
• Amount received in the column entitled “Amount.” Enter the 
amount each person or entity actually receives; if exact amounts 
aren’t available, use a reasonable estimate.
 
✓ If the space provided isn’t large enough to include all the beneficiaries, 
create your own schedule based on the one in line 5 and include it as 
Page 5a to the return, referencing it in the schedule on the return itself.
 
 Underneath the individual beneficiaries is a line where you include a 
total for all beneficiaries who received less than $5,000 apiece and for all 
unascertainable beneficiaries. The total of all these distributions should 
approximately equal the gross estate less funeral and administrative 
expenses, debts and mortgages, charitable bequests, and federal estate 
and GST taxes.
 
✓ Line 6: Check the appropriate “yes” or “no” box to indicate whether the 
estate includes any qualified terminable interest (QTIP) property from 
a prior gift or estate under section 2044. If it does, show the assets on 
Schedule F. If the decedent was a surviving spouse, he or she may have 
received QTIP property for which the marital deduction was taken on 
either a 706 or a 709 from the predeceased spouse. If the decedent still 
retained an interest in the QTIP property as of death, it’s included in his 
or her estate even though the interest terminated at his or her death. 
Chapter 17 explains how to show this info on the return.
 
✓ Line 7: On line 7a, indicate whether the decedent ever filed gift tax 
returns, and if so, attach copies as exhibits. On line 7b, list the periods 
covered by the returns and on line 7c, list the IRS offices where the gift 
tax returns were filed.

247
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Lines 8–16 are designed to remind you of other property that may be includible 
in the decedent’s estate. If you aren’t including it, the IRS wants an explanation.
 
✓ Line 8: If any insurance on the decedent’s life isn’t included on the return 
(because the insurance wasn’t owned by the decedent), answer “yes” 
on line 8a, complete Schedule D, and attach as an exhibit Form 712, Life 
Insurance Statement (we tell you how to obtain a completed Form 712 
from the insurance company in Chapter 17), together with an explana-
tion of why the policy isn’t includible in the estate. On line 8b, follow 
the line 8a process for any policy that the decedent owned on the life of 
another but isn’t being included in the estate.
 
✓ Line 9: If the decedent held property as a joint tenant with right of survi-
vorship, one of the joint tenants was someone other than the surviving 
spouse, and you’re including less than the full value of the property on 
the return, answer “yes” on line 9 and report it on Schedule E.
 
✓ Line 10: Line 10a asks whether the decedent owned an interest in a part-
nership or unincorporated business or stock in an inactive or closely 
held corporation. On line 10b, you need to disclose whether you dis-
counted the value of any of these interests for any reason. If you did take 
market discounts, check out the instructions for Schedule F.
 
 Although you’re certainly entitled to take a market discount, have all 
your backup information organized and your ducks in a row, and be pre-
pared for an audit. The IRS loves to audit these discounted valuations of 
closely held corporations.
 
✓ Line 11: Complete and attach Schedule G if the decedent made any 
transfers during life under Sections 2035 (adjustments for certain gifts 
made within three years of death), 2036 (transfers with a retained life 
estate), 2037 (transfers taking effect at death), and 2038 (revocable 
transfers). This line is a good place to check with your tax advisor.
 
✓ Line 12: On line 12a, answer “yes” if any decedent-created trusts existed 
at the decedent’s death. Attach a copy of the trust as an exhibit. For 
line 12b, answer “yes” if the decedent possessed any power (such as a 
power to appoint a beneficiary of the trust), beneficial interest (interest 
whereby the decedent derived any benefit form the trust, such as, as a 
beneficiary), or trusteeship (decedent was a trustee of a trust) under any 
trusts not created by him or her. Line 12c is trying to determine whether 
a GST taxable termination occurred on the death of the decedent. If so 
(and you can find out by asking the current trustees of any such trust), 
as line 12d says, obtain a copy of the trust and attach it as an exhibit 
along with the name, address, TIN, and phone number of the trustees of 
that trust. Also see Chapter 17 to determine whether there was a taxable 
termination.

248
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
 Another good place to check with your tax advisor! On line 12e, if the 
decedent transferred or sold an interest in a partnership, limited liabil-
ity company, or closely held corporation to a trust described in lines 
12a or 12b at any time during his or her lifetime, provide the Employer 
Identification Number (EIN) of that entity here.
 
✓ Line 13: If the decedent possessed, exercised, or released a general 
power of appointment, complete Schedule H. A general power of appoint-
ment is a power to appoint the assets of a trust in favor of anyone, 
including the holder of the power. Look for it if your decedent is a 
surviving spouse; many folks use it in marital trusts for the surviving 
spouse because it qualifies the trust for the marital deduction. Be care-
ful not to confuse a general power of appointment with a limited power 
of appointment, where you may only appoint in favor of certain specified 
people or entities, usually limited to your children, grandchildren, and 
other lineal heirs, and charitable organizations.
 
✓ Line 14: If the decedent owned, or had any interest in, a foreign bank or 
brokerage account, answer this question “yes.” Don’t be confused by 
foreign stock ownership — those shares of European and/or Asian com-
panies routinely showing up in stock portfolios aren’t what the IRS is 
asking about here.
 
✓ Line 15: If the decedent was receiving either an annuity described in the 
instructions from Schedule I or a private annuity, complete and attach 
Schedule I. An annuity is income paid in a series of payments.
 
✓ Line 16: If the decedent was ever the beneficiary of a trust created by a 
predeceased spouse for which the marital deduction was claimed, and 
the trust isn’t reported on this 706, answer “yes” here and attach an 
explanation as an exhibit (for instance, the funds in the trust may have 
all been spent for the spouse’s benefit).
Part 5: Recapitulation
Recapitulation is where you summarize the gross estate by carrying forward 
the asset totals from individual Schedules A through I and the deductions 
from Schedules J through U, all of which we discuss in detail in Chapter 17.
On line 17, enter the amount of allowable deductions, which is most likely the 
same amount as line 16. One exception: instances where the line 16 amount 
is greater than the value of the property subject to claims. In this case, enter 
whichever is greater: the value of the property subject to claims or the amount 
actually paid at the time you file the return. Unfortunately, you’re not allowed 
to take a deduction for an amount you’re not required to pay (because you 
don’t have enough property to pay it), unless you actually do pay that amount 
before filing the return. Remember this rule when planning your payments of 
claims. Be sure to pay all deductible amounts that you aren’t paying from prop-
erty subject to claims before you file the return so that you can deduct them.

249
 Chapter 16: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 1
Being Ready for and Handling an Audit
Given that only estates with a relatively high asset threshold have to file 
Form 706, you can understand that the IRS audits a higher percentage of 
these returns than any other type. Assume that yours will be one of the 
chosen, and prepare the return and all its exhibits with that in mind. You 
save yourself a lot of headache that way, instead of trying to re-create what 
you’ve done six months or a year after you’ve filed the forms.
 
Keep the following pointers in mind in case the IRS comes knocking:
 
✓ Get all the appraisals from reputable appraisers so that the results will 
stand up under audit. Each appraiser should know what the IRS expects 
in an appraisal and should attach his or her credentials to the appraisal 
for the IRS to see.
 
✓ If you take a valuation discount for closely held stock, have the calcu-
lations done by an expert in the field. Attach them to the 706.
 
✓ Keep a copy of every piece of paper that you use to determine an asset 
existed, whose name it was in, and its value. And keep those papers in 
an organized file (a file broken down by schedule is one good way to do 
it). That way, you can lay your hands on any given piece of paper that 
the IRS may require at audit. Doing so goes a long way with the IRS agent 
conducting the audit toward feeling that you’ve done a thorough job and 
have nothing to hide.
If your return is selected for audit, you receive a letter (and sometimes a 
phone call) from the IRS, requesting further information, such as the dece-
dent’s income tax returns for the past few years. If that’s the case, supply the 
information requested. Usually, the IRS accepts the additional documentation 
and concludes the audit. After all questions are satisfied, the IRS will issue its 
closing letter.
Using a probate inventory as an 
estate tax starting point
If you’re dealing with a larger estate, the pro-
bate inventory is a wonderful place to start 
compiling a list of the assets that need to be 
included on the 706. The inventory lists all the 
assets the decedent owned outright, including 
any real estate. Of course, the 706 also includes 
assets owned jointly, life insurance payments, 
and assets held in certain trusts, but the inven-
tory often includes smaller items, like house-
hold furnishings, that you may otherwise forget. 
Check out Chapter 7 where we explain how to 
put together a probate inventory.

250
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
If the IRS conducts a larger audit and any issues arise, we recommend you 
turn to your tax expert for assistance.
Getting an Estate Tax Closing Letter
If the IRS accepts your estate tax return as filed, or you and the IRS reach 
agreement as to any changes after a 706 audit, the IRS will issue Letter 627, 
Estate Tax Closing Letter. The closing letter, although not a formal agree-
ment, shows the IRS’s final determination of estate tax. The IRS isn’t likely to 
reopen the case, but it retains the option if evidence of fraud, malfeasance, 
collusion, concealment, or misrepresentation of a material fact surfaces. 
The IRS may also reopen a case if it discovers a clearly defined substantial 
error based on an established IRS position existing at the time of the previ-
ous examination (basically, if it realizes it missed something it clearly should 
have caught), or if other circumstances exist that indicate failure to reopen 
would be a serious administrative omission. An executor may reopen a case 
if the period for assessment (three year from the filing of the 706, and six years 
from filing if unreported assets constitute 25 percent or more of the gross 
estate stated in the return as filed) hasn’t expired. You want to do this if 
you subsequently discover assets of the decedent; we’ve certainly both had 
assets turn up after a closing letter was issued. You may also file a claim for 
refund.
Dealing with state estate and inheritance tax
As convoluted as the information in this chap-
ter may seem, we only cover federal rules. But 
wait, everyone who dies lives in a state, too, and 
many states have either an estate or inheritance 
tax as well. Check out Appendix B to determine 
whether your decedent’s state of residence has 
an estate tax (based on the decedent’s assets), 
an inheritance tax (based on what each benefi-
ciary receives), or a legacy or succession tax. 
Appendix B also contains addresses, telephone 
numbers, and Web sites for your use in contact-
ing state authorities to obtain forms and infor-
mation about any state tax.

Chapter 17
Preparing the Estate 
Tax Return, Part 2
In This Chapter
▶ Filling out the most common Form 706 schedules
▶ Seeking help for all the rest
F
or many, preparing the Form 706, United State Estate (and Generation-
Skipping Transfer) Tax Return, is the sterling achievement in the quest 
to competently administer an estate. After all, in most instances, the return is a 
fairly straightforward accounting of what the decedent owned and owed when 
he or she died. (Chapter 16 helps you with filling out the basics of Form 706.) 
However, if you’re not completely confident after we walk through the sched-
ules in this chapter, we suggest that you consult with either an attorney or an 
accountant who’s knowledgeable about estate tax matters for assistance.
In this chapter, we give you an in-depth look at the schedules you’re likely 
to take a crack at completing yourself and a heads-up on the schedules that 
tackle more complex areas of tax law.
Tackling the Most Common Schedules
Form 706 has a schedule for every occasion, but only rare estates have prop-
erty and/or expenses diverse enough to require you to prepare every sched-
ule. Basically, schedules are the places you list the individual assets, broken 
down by type of asset, such as Schedule A, Real Estate, and the different 
types of deductions, such as Schedule K, Debts of the Decedent. Still, every 
estate that’s required to file a Form 706 must complete at least some of them. 
In this section, we guide you through the most commonly prepared sched-
ules: the ones that show the types of property and the sorts of expenses you 
regularly find in even the smallest estates.

252
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Focusing on real estate: Schedule A
If the probate estate contains any real estate or interest in real estate, com-
plete and file Schedule A: Real Estate. Include all real estate the decedent 
owned in his or her individual name or as a tenant in common. When title is 
held as tenants in common, each tenant’s interest in the property is separate 
from the interests of the other tenants in common, and passes to his or her 
heirs upon death, as opposed to a joint tenancy with right of survivorship or a 
tenancy by the entirety, where title passes automatically to the surviving joint 
tenants.
For each piece of real estate, include the following information about the 
property on Schedule A:
 
✓ Land area.
 
✓ Any improvements such as house and lot.
 
✓ Street address.
 
✓ The legal description (the description on the deed).
 
✓ Any accrued rent (rent earned prior to the decedent’s death but not paid 
until after the date of death).
 
✓ The appraisal or other basis for valuing the property. Describe the 
appraisal on Schedule A and attach a copy as an exhibit at the end of the 
return. If the assessed value reflects the market value in the area, the IRS 
may accept the assessed value in lieu of an appraisal. Attach a copy of 
the tax assessment closest to the decedent’s date of death as an exhibit. 
If the property is sold shortly after the decedent’s death, the selling 
price may be used. The IRS doesn’t have to accept a sale price as the 
fair market value price, especially if the property was purchased by a 
related party or pursuant to an option to purchase. Attach copies of the 
sales contract and closing statement as exhibits.
If the decedent owned a fractional interest in real estate which you or your 
appraiser are discounting, attach as an exhibit a statement explaining the 
discount taken on the interest (due, for instance, to lack of control or lack of 
marketability), and be sure that the appraiser can defend the discount if the 
return is audited.
If the decedent was liable for a mortgage on the property (that is, if the mort-
gage wasn’t solely chargeable against this property), report the mortgage 
in the property description but include the full value of the property on this 
schedule and deduct the mortgage on Schedule K. If a mortgage is solely 
chargeable against the property, so that the decedent’s estate isn’t liable for 
it, deduct the mortgage from the amount reportable on this schedule.

253
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
 
Don’t forget to also include all such real estate the decedent had contracted 
to sell. If the contract is a purchase and sale agreement, you’ll hopefully have 
cancelled it and re-executed it as executor because of the decedent’s death (as 
we discuss in Chapter 20) so that you can report the real estate at its full value 
on this schedule and thus receive a step-up in cost basis before the sale. If you 
haven’t cancelled the contract entered into before the decedent’s death, don’t 
include the property on Schedule A. Instead, report the contract to sell on 
Schedule C. If the decedent was selling property under a land contract, report 
the property on Schedule A, and refer to the land contract. List all jointly held 
real estate on Schedule E (not on Schedule A). Real estate held as part of a 
sole proprietorship belongs on Schedule F (not on Schedule A)
Identifying stocks and bonds: Schedule B 
If the decedent owned any stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other securi-
ties in his or her name alone at the time of his or her death, report them on 
Schedule B: Stocks and Bonds, along with any accrued but unpaid dividends 
or interest.
If the decedent owned any securities subject to foreign death taxes and you 
paid any estate, inheritance, legacy, or succession tax to a foreign country 
on those securities, report them on this schedule, grouped together under a 
heading you add titled “Subjected to Foreign Death Taxes.” The following out-
lines what to include on this schedule.
Description
The description of each stock should include 
 
✓ The number of shares
 
✓ Whether it’s common or preferred stock
Going with special valuation: Schedule A-1
If you elect special use valuation under section 
2032A, valuing real estate used in the operation 
of a farm or closely held business at its farm or 
business use rather than its fair market value, as 
we discuss in Chapter 16, you get to complete 
Schedule A-1: Section 2032A Valuation in addi-
tion to Schedule A. Because this concept is so 
difficult, please consult a qualified professional 
to complete this schedule.

254
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
✓ Par value, where that’s necessary for identification: You can find the 
par value on the face of the certificate; it’s typically only necessary for 
preferred stock.
 
✓ The price per share: We show you how to arrive at the correct value in 
the section “Valuation procedure” later in this chapter.
 
✓ Corporation name
 
✓ Principal exchange on which the stock is sold, if any
 
✓ Nine-digit CUSIP number: Every publicly traded security has this alpha-
numeric identifier. If you can’t find it on the face of the certificate, get it 
from the stock’s transfer agent. If the stock is in an investment account, 
the investment advisor can supply you with the CUSIP number.
The description of each bond should include
 
✓ Quantity and denomination
 
✓ Name of the obligor
 
✓ Date of maturity
 
✓ Interest rate and interest due date
 
✓ Principal exchange on which the bond is sold, if any: If you have a 
stock or bond that’s not listed on an exchange, show the company’s 
principal business office.
 
✓ Nine-digit CUSIP number
Using the Employer Identification Number 
rather than a CUSIP number
Whenever the gross estate includes an interest 
in a trust, partnership, or closely held business, 
you need to include the Employer Identification 
Number (EIN) of that entity in the column titled 
“CUSIP number or EIN, where applicable.” 
That’s because these entities don’t have CUSIP 
numbers (nine-digit alphanumeric indicators) to 
identify them. This switch applies to whichever 
of the following schedules you’re completing 
at the time: Schedule B, E, F, G, M, or O. Also 
include the EIN of an estate, if it has one, on 
these schedules where applicable.

255
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
Valuation procedure
You report stocks and bonds on the 706 at their fair market value (FMV) 
as of date of death. If you’re using alternate valuation (check out Chapter 
16 for more specifics), you report their value as of the alternate valuation 
date, exactly six months after the date of death. The FMV of a stock or bond, 
whether it’s listed or unlisted, is the mean, or average, between the high and 
low selling prices on the decedent’s date of death.
If only closing prices are available, use the mean between the closing price on 
the date of death and the closing price on the day before the date of death. 
The mean is arrived at by adding the two valuation numbers together and 
dividing them by two. For example, the opening price of X Company’s stock 
is $20 per share and the closing price is $22 per share. The computation is 
($20 + $22) ÷ 2 = $21.
If the decedent died on a weekend, use the mean of the value on the Friday 
before and the mean of the value on the Monday after, and prorate the differ-
ence between the mean prices to the actual date of death, the Saturday or the 
Sunday. For example, assume the decedent died on Saturday. Y Company’s 
common stock was selling for a mean of $10 per share on Friday and a mean 
of $13 per share on Monday. The FMV of a share of Y Company stock on 
Saturday is $11, computed as follows: (2 days × $10) + (1 day × $13) ÷ 3 total 
days = $11.
You can apply the same principle when valuing stocks or bonds with no 
sales on the date of death. Find the trading dates closest in time prior to the 
decedent’s date of death and after the decedent’s date of death and apply the 
above computation, substituting the appropriate number of days and mean 
value per share. The trading days must be reasonably close to the date of 
death. If you can’t find sales reasonably close to the valuation date, use the 
mean between the bona fide bid (what a buyer says she’ll pay for a stock) 
and ask prices (the seller’s price to sell), if available. Stocks listed on the 
NASDAQ Stock Exchange are listed, and sold, by bid and asked prices rather 
than highs and lows for any given day, unlike those listed on the New York 
Stock Exchange, which lists highs and lows.
If you can obtain sales prices or bid and asked prices for before the date of 
death but not after, or vice versa, use the mean between high and low sale 
prices or the mean between the bid and asked prices on the date they’re 
available.

256
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Finding values for publicly traded stocks and bonds
To find the FMV of publicly traded stocks and bonds, here are a few different 
options you may use to find the mean values on the decedent’s date of death:
 
✓ The Wall Street Journal: You can find it at your local library if you 
don’t have a subscription or didn’t happen to save your copy from 
that date.
 
✓ Internet pricing service: If you don’t have easy access to a broker, and 
don’t want to go digging into old issues of The Wall Street Journal, you 
can, for a fee, access this information by using an Internet pricing ser-
vice. The largest of these companies is Prudential-American Securities 
Inc. (www.securities-pricing.com), which charges $4 to price each 
security, with a minimum $10 fee.
 
✓ Broker: If the securities were in a brokerage account at date of death, 
the broker may be able to give you a valuation as of the date of death. 
Be sure that the broker understands that this value is for estate tax 
purposes; otherwise, he or she will give you the closing price rather 
than the mean of the high and low selling prices for the date of death. 
If you use such a broker’s letter in valuing your securities, refer to it on 
Schedule B and attach it to your 706 as an exhibit.
Finding values for unmarketable stocks and bonds
 
Figuring out the value of unmarketable securities (securities not traded on any 
public exchange), including inactive stocks and stocks held in non-publicly 
traded corporations, is governed by rules contained in the IRS Code, as 
explained in section 2031 of the regulations. That statement, by itself, should 
be enough to send you to a qualified professional for expert assistance in pre-
paring this valuation. Attach all information used to determine the value to the 
return as exhibits, including balance sheets and statements of net earnings for 
each of the five years before the date of death.
Securities of no value
You may very well have a decedent who owned some securities that have 
lost most or all of their value. If you have one or more of these obsolete secu-
rities or securities of nominal or no value, report these last on Schedule B. 
Include the state and date of incorporation and the address of the company, 
if any, and attach as exhibits copies of correspondence or statements used to 
determine that the security is of no value.

257
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
Dividends and interest
On Schedule B don’t forget to include dividends and interest accrued!
 
✓ Cash dividends: Keep three dates in mind when determining whether a 
dividend is due (or accrued) on a particular stock as of the decedent’s 
date of death:
 
• The declaration date (date the dividend is declared)
 
• The record date (date used by the corporation to determine which 
shareholders receive the dividend)
 
• The payment date (date the dividend is paid to shareholders of 
record)
 
 Include the dividend on the return if the decedent died after the record 
date and before the payment date. You can get this information from 
Standard and Poor’s Weekly Dividend Record, or from the decedent’s 
broker.
 
✓ Stock selling ex dividend: Stock sells ex dividend (when you purchase 
the stock, you also get the dividend that has already been declared, so 
the stock price is slightly depressed) for a few days before the record 
date for a dividend. If an x appears in the Wall Street Journal before the 
number of shares of a stock traded, you know that stock is selling ex 
dividend. When a stock is selling ex dividend, its price is reduced by 
approximately the amount of the dividend. If you have a stock selling ex 
dividend in your decedent’s estate, add the value of the dividend to the 
value of the stock (the mean of the high and the low) instead of report-
ing the dividend separately.
 
✓ Accrued stock dividends: Sometimes a stock dividend (a dividend of 
shares of stock) is declared rather than a cash dividend. Report this div-
idend in the same manner you do a cash dividend. Commerce Clearing 
House’s Capital Changes Reporter is one place to find information on 
stock dividends. You can also check with a broker.
 
✓ Accrued interest: In calculating accrued interest on a bond through the 
date of death, divide the number of days since interest was last paid 
(from the date of death) by 365. Multiply that result by the annual inter-
est paid on the bond. The result is your accrued interest through the 
date of death; include this number on the 706. If a bond is selling flat 
(with no accrued interest) on the date of death, it will have an f after its 
name in the bond listings, and you don’t include any interest on the 706.

258
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Addressing mortgages, notes, 
and cash: Schedule C
 
Report mortgages, notes, and cash on Schedule C: Mortgages, Notes, and 
Cash as follows, and in the following order. You’re listing assets of the estate 
here, not debts, so any mortgages or notes listed here are amounts owed to 
the decedent, not owed by him or her.
 
✓ Mortgages and notes payable to the decedent, not by the decedent. In 
describing the mortgage, include the face value, unpaid balance, date of 
mortgage, name of maker, property mortgaged, date of maturity, interest 
rate, and interest date.
 
✓ Promissory notes. Report and describe them in the same manner as 
mortgages.
 
✓ Contracts by the decedent to sell land. Make sure that you include the 
following information:
 
• Name of the purchaser
 
• Contract date
 
• Property description
 
• Sales price
 
• Initial payment
 
• Amounts of the installment payments
 
• Unpaid balance of the principal
 
• Interest rate
 
✓ In reporting cash in the decedent’s possession, list it separately from 
cash in bank accounts. You can aggregate all the actual cash you find; 
it’s not necessary to list separately the cash in the bureau, the cash 
under the bed, and the cash hidden behind the fireplace.
 
✓ List cash in banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, and 
all other financial organizations as follows for each account:
 
• Name and address of the financial organization
 
• Amount in the account, including accrued interest
 
• Serial or account number
 
• Kind of account (checking, savings, certificate of deposit)

259
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
 
For checking accounts, be sure to report the amount in the account after you 
account for all those checks outstanding at the date of death. To obtain the 
date-of-death balances, including accrued interest, send a letter to each finan-
cial institution requesting that information (you can make up a form letter and 
send a variation of it to each institution), and retain the response from each in 
your files.
Considering life insurance: Schedule D
On Schedule D: Insurance on the Decedent’s Life, list all policies on the life 
of the decedent, whether or not any policies are includible in the gross estate 
for estate tax purposes. Insurance which the decedent owned on someone 
else’s life is includible on Schedule F.
Include the following insurance in the estate:
 
✓ The full amount of the proceeds of insurance on the decedent’s life 
receivable by the estate or usable for the benefit of the estate: If any 
legally enforceable obligation on the beneficiary to pay taxes, debts, or 
other charges of the estate stands, regardless of who the owner and ben-
eficiary of the policy are and who paid the premiums, it’s includible.
 
✓ Insurance on the decedent’s life not payable to the estate and not 
usable for its benefit: If the decedent held any incidents of ownership in 
the insurance, it goes in the taxable estate. Some examples the IRS gives 
of incidents of ownership are the following:
 
• The right to name and change the beneficiary
 
• The right to assign the policy to another or to revoke an assign-
ment
 
• The right to surrender or cancel the policy
 
• The right to pledge the policy as collateral for a loan or to obtain a 
loan against the surrender value from the insurance company
 
✓ A reversionary interest in the policy if the reversionary interest was 
more than 5 percent just before the death of the decedent. An interest 
is reversionary if the decedent gains or regains any of these listed rights 
(such as the right to name the beneficiary) if the beneficiary prede-
ceases the decedent or some other stated contingency occurs.
 
All the information you need to complete Schedule D is included on the IRS 
Form 712, Life Insurance Statement, which you must request from each 
life insurance company. Request Form 712 when you request the proceeds 
of the policy from the insurance company, as described in Chapter 7. In the 

260
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
description column, refer to the 712 as an exhibit and attach it to the return 
as such. If a policy on the decedent’s life isn’t includible, list it on this sched-
ule, including the same information as for any other policy, but don’t include 
a value in the value column, and do include in your description of the policy 
your reasons why the policy isn’t includible.
Eyeing jointly owned property: Schedule E
Schedules A through D all deal with property the decedent held in his or her 
name alone. All of this changes in Schedule E: Jointly Owned Property. If 
the decedent held any property of any kind (including real estate, personal 
property, and bank accounts) jointly at the time of his or her death, you must 
file Schedule E, whether or not any of the jointly held property is includible in 
the decedent’s taxable estate.
 
Describe the property on Schedule E in the same manner you do on its respec-
tive schedule. For instance, describe real estate as set forth in the discussion 
of Schedule A, bank accounts as set forth in the discussion of Schedule C, and 
so on. (See earlier sections in this chapter for the individual schedules.) The 
amount of the property includible in the taxable estate depends on the dece-
dent’s interest in the property, as we discuss in the following sections.
Part 1 of Schedule E
Part 1 of Schedule E deals with qualified joint interests held by the decedent 
and his or her spouse as the only joint tenants (section 2040 (b)(2)). Here you 
want to list all the property the decedent held with his or her surviving spouse 
either as joint tenants with right of survivorship (if they’re the only joint ten-
ants) or as tenants by the entirety. In either case, include the full value of the 
property at the date of death (and alternate valuation date, if applicable). 
These properties are qualified joint interests under section 2040(b)(2), which 
provides that, if property is held by the decedent and his or her spouse as joint 
tenants with right of survivorship (with no other joint tenants), or as tenants 
by the entireties, only one-half of the property is includible in the gross estate. 
(Note: Legally, only husband and wife can hold property as tenants by 
the entirety.)
 
You may only claim the special treatment under 2042(b)(2) and list the prop-
erty on Part 1 if the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen. Otherwise, include the 
property on Part 2.
Total the values of the properties on line 1a, and include one-half of the value 
of the properties on line 1b. The amount on line 1b is the amount includible 
in the gross estate.

261
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
Part 2 of Schedule E
Part 2 focuses on all other joint interests. Under 2a, list the names and 
addresses of all other surviving joint tenants. If you have more than three 
joint tenants, create a continuation sheet.
In completing Part 2, enter the letter corresponding to the surviving joint 
tenant’s name and address in the second column. In the third column enter 
the property description, and in the column entitled “Percentage includible,” 
enter 100 percent unless you can show that
 
✓ Part of the property originally belonged to the surviving tenant or ten-
ants and wasn’t acquired by gift from the decedent
 
✓ Part of the property was acquired with funds that came from the surviv-
ing joint tenant or tenants
 
✓ The property was acquired by the decedent and the other joint 
tenant(s) by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance.
If you can prove any of the above, you may exclude an amount proportionate 
to what the surviving joint tenant(s) have contributed to the property from 
the gross estate.
 
Giving up the right to dower, curtesy, or other marital rights (see Chapter 2) in 
the decedent’s estate doesn’t count as contributing toward the joint property 
in this instance.
 
If you aren’t including the full value of the joint property in the gross estate in 
Part 2, (which, of course, you’re usually trying not to do so as not to increase 
the decedent’s gross estate) be sure to attach as an exhibit proof of the extent, 
nature, and origin of the interests of the decedent and the other joint tenants 
for each such property.
Considering other property: Schedule F
Schedule F: Other Miscellaneous Property Not Reportable Under Any 
Other Schedule is that handy place to put everything that just doesn’t go on 
any other schedule. If the decedent owned it, here’s the place to put it.
Examples of items that are reported on Schedule F include
 
✓ Personal and household articles, including clothing and jewelry: If the 
decedent owned any works of art or collectible items worth more than 
$3,000 or any collections whose combined value exceeds $10,000, attach 
an appraisal by an expert in the field as an exhibit to the return. Your 
appraiser will need to attach a statement of his or her qualifications.

262
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
 You may ask, “How will I know if the value of the decedent’s collection 
of frog figurines is worth over $10,000, or if one of them is worth over 
$3,000?” If you have any suspicion that an item may have some value, 
have it appraised. We had a client whose frog collection was worth 
far more than $10,000. And one of us had a client whose highly touted 
stamp collection just didn’t get the, well, stamp of approval from the 
appraiser. So even we don’t always know what we have until we get an 
expert’s opinion. We discuss how to find an appraiser in Chapter 4.
 
 If the decedent transferred ownership of an item to his or her revocable 
living trust during life as part of his or her estate plan, you don’t need 
to include it on Schedule F. If that’s the case, you report the item on 
Schedule G.
 
✓ Automobiles and all other motor vehicles: Book value or a letter from 
an auto dealer (or whatever other type vehicle) is usually sufficient. If 
your decedent had a collectible car, get an expert appraisal.
 
✓ Debts (other than notes and mortgages reported on Schedule C), judg-
ments, claims, and refunds due the decedent: When the decedent and 
a surviving spouse receive a tax refund on a jointly filed return, the 
amount you include on the 706 as the decedent’s portion of the refund is 
the excess of the amount the decedent paid of the total tax paid over his 
or her actual tax liability (unless local law says the contrary, in which 
case you want to consult a local attorney or tax preparer who’s an 
expert in these matters).
 
✓ Checks payable to the decedent, whether received before or after 
death: These include final paychecks, dividend checks, and any other 
checks.
 
✓ Rights, royalties, and leaseholds: If the decedent held copyrights or 
other rights, received royalties, or had a leasehold (an extended right to 
lease property), obtain expert valuations and include them here.
 
✓ Farm products, growing crops, livestock, and farm machinery: If the 
decedent owned a farm, you’ll likely have some or all these items to 
report, all of which can be valued by a competent farm appraiser.
 
✓ Insurance on another person’s life: Be sure to obtain Form 712 for each 
policy from the insurance company and attach it as an exhibit to the 
return. The Form 712 gives you the value of the policy as of the dece-
dent’s date of death. See our discussion of Form 712 under Schedule D 
earlier in this chapter.
 
✓ Interests in partnerships, sole proprietorships, joint ventures, and 
other unincorporated businesses: Value these interests as described in 
the Instructions to Form 706 (Rev Sept 2007) (the Instructions). If you 
have a sole proprietorship that holds real estate, report the real estate 
here, as part of the sole proprietorship, rather than on Schedule A.

263
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
 
✓ Reversionary and remainder interests: You report both reversionary 
and remainder interests on Schedule F. As we discuss in Chapter 16, you 
may elect as the executor to postpone the tax on these future interests 
under Section 6163 until six months after the prior interest terminates, 
with a further extension of up to three years for reasonable cause.
 
• A reversionary interest is any future interest which can come back 
to the decedent where he or she was the original transferor of the 
interest. For instance, the decedent has retained a reversionary 
interest in the trust property if during lifetime he or she trans-
ferred property to a trust for the benefit of his or her mother for 
her lifetime under the condition that it revert back to the decedent 
upon the death of the mother.
 
• Meanwhile a remainder interest is any future interest that can come 
to the decedent after a prior interest terminates where the dece-
dent wasn’t the original transferor of the interest. For instance, if 
the decedent’s father created a trust with the decedent’s mother 
as the beneficiary during her lifetime, and the decedent or his or 
her estate is to receive the property upon the death of the mother, 
the decedent has a remainder interest in the trust.
 
✓ Qualified terminable interest property (QTIP). If your decedent was 
a surviving spouse, he or she may have qualified terminable interest 
property (QTIP) received from a predeceased spouse. The predeceased 
spouse received a marital deduction for the trust, either on his or her 
estate tax return or a gift tax return. If such an election was made, and 
the surviving spouse (your decedent) still retains an interest in the prop-
erty at his or her death, the full date-of-death (or alternate) value of the 
property shows up in his or her estate even though his or her interest 
terminates at death. If the QTIP property meets the other requirements 
for the marital or charitable deduction on the surviving spouse’s death, 
it qualifies for that deduction because it’s treated as having passed from 
the surviving spouse (your decedent). See Chapter 3 for an explanation 
of the QTIP trust.
 
Report the fact that the decedent had a safe-deposit box on Schedule F, 
Question 3. If any property in the safe-deposit box isn’t includible in the dece-
dent’s estate, you must explain fully why that’s the case.
Touching on funeral and administration 
expenses: Schedule J
All the Form 706 schedules up to Schedule J deal with the decedent’s assets. 
With Schedule J: Funeral Expenses and Expenses Incurred in Administering 
Property Subject to Claims, you’re finally beginning the portion of the tax 

264
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
return where you take every last deduction you can on behalf of the decedent 
(except those you may elect to take on the estate’s income tax return. Check 
out the sidebar “Options for where to take your deductions: No double dip-
ping” for more info.)
On Schedule J, you include funeral expenses and expenses incurred in admin-
istering property subject to claims. The phrase property subject to claims 
refers to property available to pay the decedent’s creditors. Your local 
(state) law will determine which property is subject to claims. Include on 
Schedule J each separate expense, itemizing each with the name and address 
of the person or entity to whom or to which the expense is payable, and the 
nature of the expense.
 
Keep in mind that, generally speaking, administrative expenses must be 
deductible under state law and be considered “reasonable and necessary” by 
the IRS for them to be deductible on the 706. What’s reasonable and neces-
sary? There’s no set standard; rather, it’s more a sense of knowing it when you 
see it. If the 706 you’ve prepared is audited, though, be prepared to substanti-
ate your expenses with receipts, and where necessary, with a scope of the 
work that’s been performed. The IRS loves nothing more than slicing off a por-
tion of the executor’s fee as being excessive.
Although the deduction is limited to the amount allowable under local law, 
it also can’t exceed the total of the value of property subject to claims in the 
gross estate and the amount of expenses paid out of property included in the 
gross estate but not subject to claims.
 
Don’t deduct expenses of property not subject to claims on this schedule! 
Those expenses are properly deducted on Schedule K. If you can’t determine 
the exact amount of certain expenses by the time the Form 706 is due, esti-
mate as accurately as you can.
Funeral expenses
Itemize all funeral expenses on line A, Schedule J. These expenses include all 
miscellaneous items billed by the funeral home (such as death certificates); 
flowers; a newspaper funeral announcement; a tombstone, monument, 
mausoleum, or burial plot for the decedent and his or her family (including 
perpetual care costs); and travel expenses for one person to accompany the 
body to the place of burial if traveling a distance.
 
Unless that amount is paid to the surviving spouse, reduce the funeral 
expense deduction by any amounts you receive from the Social Security 
Administration (currently, and for many years past, $255) or from the 
Veterans Administration (VA). Remember the fifth grade? Show your math 
right on Schedule J!

265
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
Options for where to take your deductions: 
No double dipping
Although many expenses of the estate are only 
deductible on Form 706, you actually have three 
options for taking some deductions. If you have 
the option of deducting an expense on differ-
ent tax returns, think about which deduction 
benefits the estate the most. Remember, with 
a couple of notable exceptions listed here, you 
can’t double dip — that is, take a deduction for 
the expense on both the 706 and an income tax 
return. The three options are as follows with 
some important relevant info about each one:
 ✓ Form 706
 ✓ The estate’s Form 1041
 ✓ The decedent’s final Form 1040
When deciding where to take the allowable 
deductions, compare the tax rates on the 706 
and the 1041. If you’re paying an estate tax, that 
rate is almost always higher than any trust or 
estate income tax rate, so you want to take the 
deduction on the estate tax return. But if you 
have to file a 706 due to the size of the estate 
and will owe no tax (perhaps due to an unlim-
ited marital deduction, discussed under the 
Schedule M section later in this chapter), you 
want to capture that otherwise-unused deduc-
tion on a 1041.
How do you decide where to deduct the 
expenses? The following list shows you some 
of your options:
 ✓ Expenses deductible only on Form 706: 
Funeral expenses and debts of the dece-
dent that wouldn’t have been deductible 
on a 1040 of the decedent if paid before 
death.
 ✓ Expenses deductible on both Form 706 
and either final 1040 of the decedent or 
the estate’s 1041 (a double dip, go for it!): 
Real estate taxes assessed before death 
but not paid, and other taxes deducible for 
income tax purposes, interest, and busi-
ness expenses accrued at the date of death 
(these are known as “deductions in respect 
of the decedent”) can be taken both on 
Schedule K and on the estate’s Form 1041 
or the decedent’s final Form 1040.
 ✓ Expenses deductible on only one or the 
other of the decedent’s final 1040 or the 
706: Medical expenses incurred at date of 
death but not yet paid may be deducted on 
either Form 706, Schedule K or Form 1040, 
Schedule A, but not on both. Remember, 
medical expenses are only useful as an 
income tax itemized deduction when they 
exceed 7.5 percent of the decedent’s 
adjusted gross income (AGI). If the dece-
dent is filing jointly with his or her surviving 
spouse, the 7.5 percent AGI calculation is 
based on their combined income, not just 
the decedent’s.
 ✓ Expenses deductible only on whichever of 
the 706 or the estate’s or trust’s 1041 paid 
the expense: Administration expenses and 
losses (including expenses of sale that will 
offset the sale price of property). Note that 
selling expenses are only deductible on the 
706 if the sale is necessary to pay debts of 
the decedent, administration expenses, or 
taxes; preserve the estate; or carry out dis-
tribution.

266
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
If your decedent was a veteran and the VA provides a burial marker, you 
don’t have that expense to deduct. Although deducting the cost of the funeral 
luncheon (also referred to as the collation) has been common practice, a tax 
court case recently disallowed such a deduction in Michigan. Whether this 
ruling will apply beyond the specific facts of that case remains to be seen, 
so you may want to hold off on deducting that post funeral feast until the tax 
court issues further rulings.
Administration expenses
On line B of Schedule J, list the administration expenses for your executor com-
missions, attorney fees, and accountant fees, indicating whether they’re amounts 
estimated, agreed upon, or paid. If you don’t have a probate estate, enter the 
amount of the trustees’ fees of the revocable (now irrevocable) living trust on 
line B1. If both executors’ and trustees’ fees are being charged, enter the trust-
ees’ fees as a miscellaneous expense under item B4. If the decedent arranged to 
pay the executor through a bequest or devise, you can’t deduct the payment.
 
We strongly recommend that you fill in, sign, and date Form 4421, Declaration 
of Executor’s Commissions and Attorney’s Fees (available on line at www.
irs.gov), reference it on line B1, and attach it to the 706 as an exhibit. This 
action expedites the audit process. Form 4421 contains a statement as to how 
much of the attorney fees and executor fees are being taken as a deduction on 
an income tax return.
Other expenses you may deduct on Schedule J include
 
✓ Appraisers’ fees
 
✓ Probate court filing fees
 
✓ Certified copy charges and the like
 
✓ Guardian ad litem fees (see Appendix A for a definition of this unusual 
species)
 
✓ Brokers’ and auctioneers’ fees (but only if the sale was necessary to pay 
taxes, debts, or expenses of administration, to preserve the estate, or to 
effect distribution of the property)
 
✓ Maintenance expenses of estate property (including insurance)
 
✓ Investment advisors’ fees
 
✓ Other miscellaneous expenses related to the estate such as telephone 
bills, mileage, and postage
Even interest expenses you incur as executor after the decedent’s death 
are deductible if they’re reasonable, necessary to the administration of the 
estate, and deductible under local law. But if you elect to pay the estate tax 
in installment under section 6166 as we discuss earlier, you can’t deduct any 
interest expenses incurred on the installments on the 706. Don’t forget about 
them, though — you can deduct them on the estate’s Form 1041.

267
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
Recording debts, mortgages, 
and liens: Schedule K
List your Schedule K items under the following two categories:
The decedent’s debts
Report all unsecured debts of the decedent that existed at the time of the 
decedent’s death, whether or not mature (currently due), and that relate to 
property not subject to claims of the decedent’s creditors. As we discuss for 
Schedule J in the previous section, your state law determines which items 
of property are subject to claims and therefore whether you deduct these 
expenses on Schedule J or K. For each item, include the name of the creditor, 
the nature of the claim, and the amount. If the claim is for services for a cer-
tain period of time, state that period of time.
Examples of some deductible debts are
 
✓ Household expenses, such as utility bills, accrued before death
 
✓ Property taxes accrued before the decedent’s death
 
✓ Federal taxes on income received before the decedent’s death (or the 
decedent’s portion [the amount for which the estate would be liable 
under local law], if it’s a joint liability with a surviving spouse)
 
✓ Unpaid gift taxes on gifts the decedent made
 
✓ Certain claims of a former spouse against the estate if they meet the 
requirements set out in the instructions to Form 706, Schedule K
 
✓ Professional fees, such as attorneys’ fees, accountants’ fees, and so on, 
for services rendered during life
 
✓ Amounts due on notes, judgments, and accrued interest through date of 
death
Mortgages and liens
On the bottom half of Schedule K, report only obligations:
 
✓ Secured by mortgages or other liens for which the decedent was person-
ally liable (and for which the estate is liable)
 
✓ On property you included in the gross estate at its full value, unreduced 
by the mortgage or lien
If the decedent and his or her estate aren’t liable for the mortgage or lien, 
include in the gross estate only the value of the property net of the debt. You 
don’t deduct any portion of such debt on this schedule.

268
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Listing net losses and such: Schedule L
Although you certainly try to avoid shipwrecks or other disasters during 
your term as executor, you may find comfort in the fact that you can at least 
deduct them if they occur during the settlement of the estate. Also deduct-
ible are losses from theft, fire, storm, and other casualties, except to the 
extent they’re reimbursed by insurance or in some other manner and the loss 
isn’t reflected in the alternate valuation of the property. You may not take the 
loss on the 706 if you elect to take it on the applicable income tax return, so 
take a look at your relative tax rates and make your best choice.
Deduct the expenses you incur in administering property included in the 
gross estate but not subject to claims on the bottom half of Schedule L: Net 
losses during administration and expenses incurred in administering prop-
erty not subject to claims. Here’s where you report the expenses relating to 
administering a decedent’s revocable trust (funded with assets before death, 
and, of course, irrevocable after death). You may only deduct those expenses 
paid within the period of limitations, typically three years after the 706 is 
filed. The expenses must relate to settling the decedent’s interest in the 
property or vesting good title in the beneficiaries. Any expenses deducted on 
an income tax return may not be deducted here. Report the expenses in the 
same fashion as those on Schedule J.
Covering bequests to surviving 
spouse: Schedule M
If your decedent left a surviving spouse, you may have a whopper of a deduc-
tion available to you, which you report on Schedule M: Bequests, etc. to sur-
viving spouse. All property that passes to the surviving spouse as a result of 
the decedent’s death qualifies for the unlimited marital deduction, provided 
that the surviving spouse is a U.S. citizen. Using the unlimited marital deduc-
tion causes no tax to be due on the death of the first spouse to die; when 
the second spouse dies, his or her estate pays whatever tax is due on the 
remaining assets of both spouses. Therefore, if your decedent left a surviving 
spouse, that spouse’s estate (not your decedent’s) will be responsible for the 
tax burden, and you can breathe a sigh of relief. The following sections high-
light which property does and doesn’t qualify for the marital deduction.
Property qualifying for the marital deduction
Property qualifying for the marital deduction includes assets held either 
solely in the decedent’s name or jointly with the surviving spouse. In addi-
tion, the following items also qualify:

269
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
 
✓ Trust qualifying for marital deduction: Property left in trust for a 
surviving spouse qualifies for the marital deduction if, under the trust 
agreement, the surviving spouse at a minimum is the sole beneficiary, is 
entitled to receive all the income for his or her life, can withdraw any or 
all of the principal at any time, and has a general power of appointment 
exercisable by will.
 
✓ Life insurance, endowments, and annuity contracts: Proceeds from 
these assets, if payable to the surviving spouse, qualify provided that 
they meet all the conditions laid out in the Form 706 instructions.
 
✓ Qualified terminable interest property (QTIPs): Check the will and any 
trusts carefully for a QTIP trust. If one exists, you may either elect to 
claim a marital deduction for qualified terminable interest property by 
listing the property on Schedule M and deducting it (that’s all it takes to 
elect it), or elect out of the QTIP, and thus not get a marital deduction. 
In either case, list the property on Schedule M. If you’re choosing not to 
use the QTIP election (to elect out), be sure to specifically identify the 
trust as being excluded from the election. Remember, any property for 
which the election is made will be included in the decedent’s spouse’s 
estate when he or she dies. When would you choose to elect out? When 
the surviving spouse’s estate is much larger than the decedent’s, and 
you don’t want to increase it further and take it to a higher tax bracket. 
Of course, when you elect out, even though the property is listed on 
Schedule M, you may not include it in the total and take it as a marital 
deduction.
 
 Consult your tax advisor to be sure you meet all the requirements for 
making a valid QTIP election!
 
✓ Joint and survivor annuities: If your decedent has a joint and survivor 
annuity with his or her surviving spouse, that spouse doesn’t have to 
specifically elect to take the marital deduction for that property. If the 
surviving spouse has the right to receive payments during his or her life-
time after the decedent’s death, that constitutes a QTIP election unless 
you, as executor, affirmatively opt out of the election on the 706, for the 
reasons described earlier.
 
✓ Charitable remainder trusts: If you have a surviving spouse who 
receives an interest in a charitable reminder trust, it isn’t treated as 
a nondeductible terminable interest if the interest passes from your 
decedent to his or her surviving spouse and that surviving spouse is 
the only beneficiary of the trust (other than charitable organizations). A 
charitable remainder trust is either a charitable remainder annuity trust 
or a charitable remainder unitrust — Chapter 3 tells you what you need to 
know about these trusts.
 
✓ Qualified domestic trusts (QDOTs): A surviving spouse who isn’t a U.S. 
citizen doesn’t automatically qualify for the unlimited marital deduction 
unless the property is put into a qualified domestic trust (QDOT) for the 
benefit of that spouse.

270
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
 The terms of the QDOT are quite specific, and you want to consult with 
a qualified tax advisor if you need to follow this route. If the decedent 
left a marital trust that doesn’t meet the requirements of a QDOT, you 
can ask the probate court to reform the trust so that it qualifies for 
the election. If your decedent left assets not in a trust to the surviving 
spouse, the spouse or you (as executor) may establish a QDOT trust. 
The surviving spouse can then transfer assets left outright to him or her 
into this trust.
As an alternative to attempting to meet the QDOT requirements, the surviv-
ing spouse may elect to become a U.S. citizen, although chances are he or 
she would have done so by now.
Property not qualifying for the marital deduction
A terminable interest is an interest that terminates or fails after the passage 
of time or upon the (non)occurrence of some contingency. In general, termi-
nable interest property received by a surviving spouse is normally nonde-
ductible. It makes sense, because the IRS isn’t able to collect estate tax on 
property when the surviving spouse dies if the interest terminates before-
hand. As usual, you have a couple of exceptions:
 
✓ Six-month survival period: If your decedent left a bequest, whether 
outright or in trust, to the surviving spouse on the condition that the 
spouse survives for a period not exceeding six months, it’s not consid-
ered a terminable interest, and so will qualify for the marital deduction. 
Many estate plans contain this condition.
 
✓ Deductions against the marital deduction: If you claim a deduction as 
executor on Schedules J through L against any property you take as a 
marital deduction, you must reduce the amount of the marital deduction 
by that J through L deduction amount. If the marital deduction property 
has a mortgage or other encumbrance, you may take only the net value 
of the property after you deduct that mortgage or encumbrance.
Recording charitable, public, and similar 
gifts and bequests: Schedule O 
Don’t worry, you haven’t missed anything here — Schedule N was eliminated 
years ago. So just proceed to Schedule O to claim a charitable deduction if 
your decedent left a bequest, legacy, devise, or transfer for a qualified chari-
table purpose to any qualified charitable organization. See the Instructions 
for Form 706 regarding Schedule O for the five general categories of qualified 
charitable organizations.

271
 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
 
You may take an estate tax charitable deduction for amounts transferred 
to charitable organizations as a result of a qualified disclaimer. A qualified 
disclaimer is a refusal to accept an interest in property under certain, very 
specific circumstances (see Chapter 8). Consult your tax expert to be sure you 
have crossed all your t’s and dotted all your i’s to qualify for this disclaimer. 
In addition to disclaimers, the instructions for Schedule O list other types of 
property which qualify for the charitable deduction.
 
If you have any questions about a charitable gift made by your decedent, or 
about how to report the gift, consult that estate tax expert we keep mentioning.
Knowing When to Ask for Help
Although a reasonably competent person can prepare most of Form 706 
without professional help, some of its schedules involve complex areas of tax 
law. In this section, we give you what you need to know in order to identify 
whether any of this property or these expenses are in your estate, but we 
strongly suggest that you not rely on your own common sense to work your 
way through reporting these items. Many technicalities here can turn these 
schedules into a minefield for the unwary.
Presuming survival with simultaneous death
If both your decedent and his or her spouse 
die in a common disaster (an occurrence we 
sincerely hope doesn’t arise) and the order of 
their deaths can’t be determined, review each 
spouse’s estate planning documents to see if 
they assume that the spouse with the smaller 
estate survived the other spouse. In both the 
husband’s and wife’s documents, the presump-
tion would be that the spouse with the smaller 
estate survived. Thus, the spouse with the 
smaller estate would inherit marital deduction 
property from the wealthier spouse, which the 
spouse with the smaller estate could then use 
his or her exemption amount against, making 
full use of both spouses’ exemption amounts. 
If no such presumption is made in the estate 
plan documents, or if you can’t find any such 
documents, state law governs. In at least some 
states, each decedent is presumed to have 
survived the other, thus leaving no marital 
deduction and perhaps no or less than full use 
of the exemption amount by the spouse with 
the smaller assets. (Refer to the discussion 
of exemption amounts at the beginning of this 
chapter.)

272
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Listing transfers during life: Schedule G
Welcome to Schedule G: Transfers during Life, the land of the look-back, 
the second glance, the “if only,” the “oops, I really wish the decedent hadn’t 
retained that power,” and, quite probably, the “I think I’d better check with 
my tax expert about this schedule. . . .”
 
If the decedent transferred property during his or her life for less than full 
payment, sometime it can be included in his or her taxable estate. Sometimes 
the decedent knew the property would be included in the estate (when, for 
instance, he or she funded a revocable trust during life — revocable trusts and 
the property held in them are always included in the decedent’s estate and 
are reported on Schedule G). Occasionally (we hope not often) a power over a 
transfer the decedent made during life is retained unintentionally, causing the 
property transferred to be includible in the decedent’s estate. In either case, 
or any other that may arise, Schedule G is here, courtesy of the IRS, for your 
convenience in reporting certain transfers made within three years of death, 
including gift taxes on gifts made within three years of death (even though the 
gifts may not be includible in the estate) and transfers with certain retained 
interests.
Exercising powers of appointment: 
Schedule H
A power of appointment over property, which can be either general or lim-
ited, is the power to decide who will be the ultimate owner (or have the 
enjoyment) of the property and when. It’s usually created by someone other 
than the decedent under that person’s will or trust, giving the decedent the 
authority to direct the use and dispersal of any property controlled by the 
power. For example, Abe X leaves a trust under his will to his wife, Ida X, and 
gives her a general power of appointment over all the property contained in 
the trust. When Ida X dies, her executor must include this power on Schedule 
H of Ida’s Form 706, listing all the property that was in Abe’s trust on the date 
of Ida’s death.
Only property controlled by a general power of appointment is included on 
Schedule H: Powers of Appointment. A general power can be exercised in 
favor of anyone, including the decedent, his or her estate, his or her credi-
tors, or the creditors of the estate. A limited power of appointment can only 
be exercised in favor of a limited class of people designated by the grantor 
(for instance, the grantor’s children and their lineal descendants), never 
including the power holder, his or her estate, his or her creditors, or the 
creditors of his or her estate.

 Chapter 17: Preparing the Estate Tax Return, Part 2
Considering annuities: Schedule I
The term annuity, for estate tax purposes, is an agreement to make periodic 
cash payments to one or more persons over a specific period of time. An 
annuity is subject to estate tax if payments (or a lump sum payment) con-
tinue after the decedent’s death. If the annuity ends with the decedent’s 
death, it’s not includible in the decedent’s estate. On Schedule I: Annuities, 
report the value of any annuity that meets the requirements set out in the 
Instructions.
Claiming a credit for foreign 
death taxes: Schedule P
You may claim a credit for foreign death taxes paid to a foreign country or 
any of its political subdivisions on Schedule P: Credit for Foreign Death 
Taxes if the decedent is a U.S. citizen or a resident alien, on property situated 
in the foreign country, and subject to estate tax on the 706. To obtain the 
credit, the foreign tax must be a tax on the transfer of the foreign property 
at death. You may also claim a credit for foreign death taxes under death 
tax treaties or conventions with many countries. Check the Instructions for 
Form 706-NA, United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax 
Return (Estate of nonresident not a citizen of the United States), for a cur-
rent list of treaties in effect.
Getting a credit for tax on prior 
transfers: Schedule Q
Whoever said the IRS didn’t have a heart was wrong. In Schedule Q: Credit 
for Tax on Prior Transfers, you’re allowed a credit for estate taxes paid by 
a prior estate on property included in this estate, provided the transfer from 
the first estate to your decedent happened no more than ten years prior to or 
two years after your decedent’s date of death. The property needn’t exist on 
your decedent’s date of death. Property qualifies for the credit if it was sub-
ject to estate tax on the prior decedent’s (the transferor’s) date of death. You 
may take the credit so long as your decedent was considered the beneficial 
owner of the property, even if that ownership ended with your decedent’s 
death, such as a general power of appointment (see Schedule H earlier in 
this chapter for a definition of a general power of appointment), annuity, life 
estate, term for years, and remainder interest (whether vested or contingent).

274
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax: 
Schedule R
The Generation Skipping Transfer (GST) tax assesses a tax on property at 
each generational level as if it had been owned by someone of that genera-
tion, even though ownership of the property skipped over one or more of 
those generations. Its purpose is to prevent grandparents from leaving prop-
erty to grandchildren, bypassing the children in between to bypass taxation 
in the children’s estates.
 
As executor, you want to know enough about the GST tax to recognize 
whether your decedent’s estate may be subject to it. If you’ve already made 
that determination, or if you’re fence sitting because you’re not sure, it’s time 
to call in the experts — be they estate attorneys, accountants, or EA’s — to 
prepare Schedules R and R-1 and to help you determine who are the skip 
beneficiaries, and what property, exactly, those beneficiaries are receiving. 
Remember, only assets that skip generations (even if the property lands in a 
trust for the benefit of a skip person) are subject to the GST tax.
Electing a Qualified Conservation 
Easement Exclusion: Schedule U
If your decedent’s gross estate includes land which is subject to a qualified 
conservation easement, you may make an election to exclude a portion of 
the land which is subject to the easement from the estate. For the purpose 
of Form 706, a qualified conservation easement is defined as an easement (an 
easement allows others to use your land for a specific purpose) of a qualified 
real property interest to a qualified organization exclusively for conservation 
purposes. After it’s made, the election can’t be revoked. An easement can 
also be granted after the decedent’s death.

▶ Calculating deductions
▶ Tackling Page 2 of Form 1041
L
ife would be great, or certainly comforting, if all income tax returns were 
alike, and for the most part, they are. There are differences between 
preparing (and filing) your own Form 1040 and the decedent’s, which you 
still must file in order to report income and deductions, up to and including 
the date of death. And those differences become even more pronounced after 
you move into income taxation of estates and trusts, where some concepts 
remain the same, but others change.
In this chapter, you discover what’s the same, and what’s different, with both 
the decedent’s final Form 1040 and the trust or estate’s Form 1041. We tell 
you how to stay in the clear with the IRS as you prepare the final year (or 
maybe two) of the decedent’s personal income tax returns (Form 1040), or 
you complete and file income tax returns for estates and trusts (Form 1041).
Before You Begin: What You Need to Do
Thinking about income taxes may not be high on your list of priorities as you 
begin administering an estate or trust, but it will soon become a main focus 
of your administration, whether you’re thrilled by the idea or not. Planning 
for those first income tax returns should begin right away, not at year-end 
when the first deadline for filing is fast approaching.

276
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
This section helps keep your tax reporting running as smoothly as possible. 
We discuss obtaining a federal tax ID number and choosing an appropriate tax 
year end. By the time you finish this section, you’ll be ready to jump right in.
Obtain a federal tax ID number
Before you get started on any tax return, you need to have a federal taxpayer 
identification number (or TIN). If you’re preparing the decedent’s final 
Form 1040, just use his or her Social Security Number (or SSN).
However, if you’re thinking ahead to filing that first return for the decedent’s 
estate or for a trust, you need a TIN before you can begin. Apply for the estate 
or trust’s TIN by using Form SS-4, Application for Employer Identification 
Number, which you can get from any IRS office, by phoning 800-829-4933, or 
online at www.irs.gov/businesses/index.html (click on “Employer ID 
Numbers” to go directly to the form). When applying by phone or online, you 
receive your number immediately; if you file a physical application by mail, it 
takes up to ten days to receive the form from the IRS, and up to an additional 
four more weeks to receive the number itself.
Every taxpayer needs a TIN. Although individuals use their SSN, estates and 
trusts must each have their own EIN in order to file any tax returns. You’re 
not allowed to use the decedent’s SSN to file an estate return, nor can you use 
the estate’s EIN to file a return for a trust that inherits the estate’s property. 
Still, obtaining a TIN only costs you a little time and no money, so don’t feel 
like you’re being wasteful because you’re not able to recycle ones that are 
no longer useful, like the decedent’s SSN. Be careful, though, and only apply 
for a TIN once for each taxpayer; nothing is worse than trying to sort out the 
confusion with the IRS and your banks, brokerages, and anyone else to whom 
you’ve given the information, when an estate or trust has more than one EIN. 
If you need to open even one bank or brokerage account for an estate, you 
have to apply for a TIN to do so. Applying alerts the IRS that a new trust or 
estate exists; it’s going to expect tax returns from that entity, even if there’s 
no obligation to file one. Not to worry — if you receive a notice asking for a 
tax return, send the IRS a letter explaining that the estate didn’t have enough 
income to file. Or, to avoid the notice altogether, you can prepare and file a 
return showing no income (which we show you how to do in this chapter).
Choose a tax year-end
Although Congress created a general rule in 1986 that all individuals, busi-
nesses, and most trusts had to use December 31 as their tax year-end, every 
rule has exceptions. An estate may choose the last day of any month as its 
tax year-end, provided the first year doesn’t include more than 12 months.

277
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
Why choose a date other than December 31 as a tax year-end? Depending on 
how much income the estate stands to receive (and when), using a different 
year-end can substantially reduce the total income tax bite, especially if the 
estate’s administration will take more than 12 months from start to finish. If 
you haven’t already, create a schedule of when and how much income you 
expect the estate to receive. Because estates and trusts reach the highest tax 
bracket very quickly, we recommend that you split the initial flow of income 
into two years, if possible. Whether the estate is paying the tax, or distribu-
tions to the beneficiaries means they’ll be responsible for the income tax bill, 
splitting income into two years can ease the overall income tax burden for 
both the estate and the heirs.
You’ll be asked to declare a year-end when applying for the trust or estate’s 
EIN, but your decision isn’t absolutely final until you file that first income tax 
return and put the year-end on the top of page 1. For example, the decedent 
died on April 15, and you initially chose a December 31 year-end because 
you didn’t know that you could choose differently. The estate paid large, 
tax-deductible expenses before December 31, but ended up receiving the 
majority of its income in January and March of the following year. If the tax 
year-end remains December 31, the first tax return has no tax due and misses 
out on large deductions (because it has no income to offset them), while the 
second year’s return will show lots of income, few deductions, and a large tax 
bill. By changing the year-end to January 31 (which is still less than twelve 
months after the decedent died), you can move some income back into the 
estate’s first tax year — hopefully enough to offset the deductions — and 
drastically reduce the amount of taxable income in the second tax year. 
You’ve reduced not only the income tax due on that return but also the total 
amount of income taxes paid by the estate over the course of administration.
If you choose a year-end other than December 31, you’re responsible for cor-
rectly accounting for all income received because the 1099s you receive from 
banks, brokerages, and others may not accurately reflect income for the tax 
year; only your good recordkeeping will produce an accurate tax return.
Calculating the Income
Whether you’re filing a Form 1040 or a Form 1041, your first task is to deter-
mine how much income the taxpayer (whether trust, estate or decedent) 
earned. In the case of an individual (filing Form 1040), you’re already likely 
familiar with the types of income you’ll see, like wages, retirement income, 
interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, and so on. Not surprisingly, 
types of income on Form 1041 are the same (although you see wages, pen-
sions and Social Security, railroad retirement, or veteran’s benefits rarely, 
because these payments tend to stop at death). All you need to do is identify 
the income, put it on the correct line, and add the total. This section walks 
you through the different types of income you need to know how to figure.

278
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Interest
Interest is income you receive because you’ve lent money. No matter where 
or to whom you lend money, either to banks, the U.S. Treasury, state and 
local governments (municipal bonds), corporations, foreign governments, or 
your nephew Fred, the income earned from that investment is interest.
With the exception of interest you earn when making personal loans, 
Form 1099-INT should tell you how much interest you’re dealing with. Just 
add up all the Form 1099-INTs to get the year’s total. For non-calendar-year 
filers, remember that using 1099 information may cause you to either over- 
or under-report income. Make sure you keep excellent records to make up for 
this discrepancy. You report total taxable interest on line 1 of Form 1041, or 
line 8a of Form 1040. You show exempt interest (interest not subject to federal 
income tax, like interest from municipal bonds) on the back of Form 1041, on 
Question 1 of “Other Information”; if you’re preparing the decedent’s final 1040, 
place his or her exempt interest on line 8b.
Dividends
Unlike interest, dividends represent profits from a company in which you own 
shares. You can earn dividends from publicly traded or closely held corpora-
tions and from U.S. or foreign companies. You may receive them from specific 
corporations or from shares owned in a mutual fund, which buys and sells the 
shares of many corporations, giving you tiny pieces of each individual dividend. 
Regardless of the source, every January you receive a Form 1099-DIV, showing 
how much you earned from dividends.
The most common types of dividend payments shown on Form 1099-DIV are 
the following:
 
✓ Total dividends: Total dividends are the total amount of ordinary divi-
dends you received. Add these numbers up from all Forms 1099-DIV and 
place the total on line 2a of Form 1041 or line 9a of Form 1040.
 
✓ Qualified dividends: As a portion of the total dividend, qualified divi-
dends are subject to lower income tax rates. If you’ve received more 
than one Form 1099-DIV, and each has an amount listed in box 1b, add 
all amounts shown in box 1b, and place the total on line 9b of Form 1040 
or split between lines 2b(1) and 2b(2) of Form 1041. Chapter 19 tells you 
how to make the allocation between the two lines.
 
✓ Capital gain dividends: Capital gain dividends are payments you received, 
primarily from mutual funds, that derive from the sale of assets within the 
fund and that are subject to a lower income tax rate. You typically place 

279
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
the amounts shown in box 2 of Form 1099-DIV on Schedule D (for either a 
Form 1040 or a Form 1041); however, if you’re preparing the decedent’s 
Form 1040 and he or she had no other capital gains or losses, check the 
box next to line 13 of Form 1040, and then fill in the amount.
Business income
Business income is income received from operating a business, one that the 
taxpayer owns either wholly or only in part, like a shareholder in a Subchapter 
S corporation. If the decedent operated a business as a sole proprietor (he or 
she was the owner of the company and declared his or her business income 
on Schedule C of Form 1040; check out Chapter 7 for more info), you probably 
have to prepare a Schedule C to file with both the final Form 1040 and with the 
estate’s Form 1041, at least while you’re wrapping up the affairs of the business. 
After you complete Schedule C, place the total on line 3 of Form 1041, or line 12 
of Form 1040. If income is received from a Subchapter S corporation or a partner-
ship, you receive a Schedule K-1 from that entity’s income tax return, reporting 
all the types of income you need to include on either the decedent’s Form 1040 
or the trust or estate’s Form 1041; only include on the business income lines of 
these tax returns amounts labeled as ordinary income on Schedule K-1.
Although paying self-employment tax after a person dies may sound strange, 
income earned from a sole proprietorship declared on Form 1040 is still sub-
ject to that additional tax. Don’t forget to prepare and include Schedule SE 
with the decedent’s final Form 1040. After the business is operating under the 
estate’s ownership, self-employment tax disappears. Evidently, someone got 
the memo that the estate would never collect Social Security or Medicare.
Capital gains and losses
We know you love definitions, so here are a few useful ones to help you calculate 
the capital gains and losses. Capital property is anything that is owned by an 
entity that is used to generate income, income that may be earned either during 
the course of ownership or when the property is sold. A capital gain is the profit 
earned when a piece of capital property is sold for more than its acquisition 
cost (otherwise known as basis), while a capital loss recognizes the difference 
between a low sales price and its higher basis. Although there’s a difference 
between property held for personal use and capital property in an individual’s 
life (which is why you don’t need to report the gains and losses you receive from 
your annual yard sale), trusts and estates don’t use hairdryers and tableware, 
so all property owned by a trust or estate is capital property, and all gains and 
losses realized on their sale must be accounted for on Schedule D of Form 1041.

280
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Whenever you sell property, the difference between your basis in the prop-
erty and the sale price determines the capital gain or loss. In order to figure 
out what number to use on line 4 of Form 1041 or line 13 of Form 1040, you 
need to know not only these numbers but also the acquisition dates and sale 
dates of all property sold. Proceeds from sales and sale dates will be easy to 
sort out, because you receive Form 1099-B for the sale of all securities and 
Form 1099-S for the sale of a house.
If the sale dates and proceeds are easy to find, figuring out what acquisi-
tion costs and dates and numbers to use can sometimes be confusing. And 
if that’s not bad enough, you also have to calculate the holding period, or 
the length of time the entity’s owned the property. Here, you have a choice 
between the following:
 
✓ Long-term gain or loss (property owned for more than one year)
 
✓ Short-term gain or loss (property owned for one year or less)
 
✓ Inherited property, which automatically is treated as long-term, even if 
the estate or trust has only owned it for a day or less
Table 18-1 shows which ones to use.

*Alternate valuation is determined 6 months after date of death, and must be elected on the 
decedent’s Form 706. See Chapter 16.
Just because the decedent’s estate isn’t large enough to warrant filing 
a Form 706 doesn’t mean that the value of his or her property doesn’t 
benefit from the so-called step-up or increase in basis. Unless the dece-
dent dies in 2010, the basis of the property the decedent owned at death 
changes to the date of death value, and the new acquisition date is the 
decedent’s date of death. For example, John Smith owns XYZ Corp stock 
he purchased for $50 per share in 2003. At his death in 2008, the stock was 
now worth $100 per share. Even though Mr. Smith doesn’t have a taxable 
estate, the acquisition cost for his XYZ Corp shares is now $100 per share. 
When his executor sells the shares for $100 each, no gain or loss is recog-
nized, because the sales price equals the stepped-up acquisition cost, so 
no capital gains tax is due on the sale.

282
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Income from rents, royalties, partnerships, 
and other estates and trusts
If the decedent, estate, or trust owned rental property, had an interest in 
any mining activities, published any works (or had an interest in published 
works), was a member of a partnership, or was a beneficiary of another 
estate or trust, you’re going to have to fill out Schedule E, Supplemental 
Income and Loss. The good news: Whether you’re preparing Form 1040 or 
Form 1041, Schedule E is the same.
Part I of Schedule E covers the income and/or loss from rental and roy-
alty income; Part II gives you space to show the same information from 
Partnerships and S Corporations; and Part III wants to know about any income 
from other estates or trusts that you may have to report on this return.
In addition to being the collection point for information on all these types 
of income, Schedule E is also the spot where you need to decide whether 
the income you received is active or passive. Basically, you need to deter-
mine whether the participant actively participated in the business or was 
merely an investor (not involved in the day-to-day activities of that busi-
ness). If you’re preparing a Form 1041, the answer to this question is fairly 
simple — trusts and estates are rarely active participants in partnerships 
and S corporations, and rental and royalty income is, by definition, passive, 
so the income and/or losses from these activities are almost always passive. 
If you’re filing a 1040 return for the decedent, the distinction isn’t always so 
clear-cut. Check out the most current version of Taxes For Dummies by Eric 
Tyson, Margaret Atkins Munro, and David Silverman (Wiley) to determine 
whether you’re dealing with active or passive income.
Whether you’re filing a Form 1040 or Form 1041, if you have passive losses 
you may deduct them only against passive income; passive losses that 
exceed passive income are suspended. Calculate your passive loss limita-
tions on Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations.
Farm income or loss
If the decedent owned a farm, the land doesn’t just disappear because he 
or she has died. The farm will continue operations, at least until you can 
find someone to buy or lease the property, and you’ll need to report any 
income or loss from it. Before you can fill in a number on line 6 of Form 1041 
or line 18 of Form 1040, you’re going to have to wend your way through 
Schedule F. Fortunately, Form 1041 doesn’t have a separate Schedule F, so 
after you figure out how to prepare one, you can easily transfer those skills 
from the decedent’s Form 1040 to the estate or trust’s Form 1041.

283
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
Ordinary gain or loss
If your decedent owned any sort of business property (from real estate 
owned as part of a business to office equipment, cars, or any other prop-
erty that had a business use), when you sell it you’re going to report that 
sale on Form 4797, Sale of Business Property. Use Part I to report sales 
of property held long term by the decedent, trust, or estate and Part II for 
short-term sales. Note: Property that an estate or trust acquires due to 
the decedent’s death constitutes an inheritance, uses the date-of-death 
value for its acquisition cost and date of death for its acquisition date, 
and qualifies as a long-term holding, even if the sale occurs the day after 
the decedent died.
Like Schedule D, Form 4797 needs a description of the property sold, acquisi-
tion and sale dates, and the taxpayer’s cost of acquisition. Table 18-1 earlier 
in this chapter explains how you determine the acquisition date and basis 
cost for property. In addition to this information, if the property depreciated 
over time (where the property’s value is recovered over its useful economic 
life), you must add the total amount of depreciation to the sale price in order 
to calculate the gain or loss. Look at the decedent’s prior years’ income tax 
return to see what property he or she was depreciating. If there’s no sole pro-
prietorship (Schedule C), rental property (Schedule E), or farm (Schedule F), 
you’re off the hook in regards to depreciable property. If any of those sched-
ules are attached to a prior return, you may want to consult a tax expert for 
assistance in determining how much, if any, of the depreciation taken must 
be recaptured. If it sounds something like caging a wild animal, well, you’re 
not too far off the mark.
After you complete Form 4797, carry the short-term gains or losses from 
line 17 of Form 4797 to Form 1041, line 7. If you’re filing the decedent’s 
Form 1040, follow the instructions for line 18a and b. Some of your losses 
may end up on Schedule A, Itemized Deductions; gains and other losses not 
reported on Schedule A end up on Form 1040, line 14. Long-term gains or 
losses take a detour through Schedule D (1041, line 10 or 1040, line 11) so 
that you can factor these long-term sales into your tax calculations.
On Form 4797, you also report casualty losses (which are losses from a 
theft, or a disaster, such as a fire, flood, or earthquake), and the gain or loss 
received on installment sales (where you receive the proceeds from the sale 
over a period of years, not all at once) and on like-kind exchanges (where 
you exchange one piece of property for another, similar piece of property). 
Casualty losses, installment sales, and like-kind exchanges are very technical 
transactions, and you may want to consult an attorney, an accountant, or an 
enrolled agent before either entering into one or attempting to report the one 
you’ve already participated in to the IRS.

284
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Dividing income and deductions between 
the decedent and the estate
One of the most perplexing questions facing 
an administrator or executor of an estate is 
how, exactly, to divide income and deductions 
between the decedent’s final Form 1040 and the 
estate’s Form 1041. Does the decedent continue 
to pay tax on investment income until the assets 
are reregistered in the name of the estate? 
Where do you deduct mortgage interest pay-
ments and real estate taxes? What about back 
wages paid after death?
Just because an employer, bank, brokerage 
firm, or other payer continues making payments 
to the decedent doesn’t necessarily mean that’s 
the tax return where they should go. You make 
the final determination of where these items 
rightfully belong, and you have the responsibil-
ity of reporting them correctly.
Because most taxpayers are cash basis (you 
report only items that you’ve actually received 
or paid out, not items that you owe or others 
owe to you), you should be able to determine 
pretty easily which tax return an item belongs 
on. If a check is dated after the date of death, it 
belongs to the estate, even if it’s payable to the 
decedent; checks dated up through the date of 
death belong to the decedent, even if the dece-
dent hadn’t yet cashed them. The same is true 
for amounts owed by the decedent. If the dece-
dent wrote and mailed the check, he or she gets 
the deduction; if you pay the bill after death, the 
deduction belongs to the estate, even if you 
paid the check out of the decedent’s checking 
account (which is a major no-no we discuss in 
Chapter 8).
As with any rules, exceptions exist. Property 
owned jointly with rights of survivorship (a form 
of joint ownership in which title passes auto-
matically to the surviving joint owner(s)), and 
property owned as tenants by the entireties (a 
form of ownership available only to spouses in 
which title passes automatically to the surviving 
spouse on the first spouse’s death) transfer at 
the time of death to the surviving owner(s), so 
income received after death belongs 100 per-
cent to the surviving joint owner(s) or surviv-
ing tenant by the entirety. Likewise, mortgage 
payments owed on property held jointly with 
rights of survivorship and as tenant by the 
entireties become the sole responsibility of 
the survivor(s). If property is owned jointly as 
tenants in common, the scenario changes. At 
death, the heirs of the deceased joint owner 
become additional joint owners of the property 
and are now automatically entitled to the dece-
dent’s share of the income (and the decedent’s 
share of the debts owed on that property stays 
with the decedent’s share of the property which 
goes to the heirs).
The estate often receives income for months — 
sometimes years — after the decedent’s death, 
with checks still payable to the decedent per-
sonally. Don’t hesitate to deposit these checks 
into the estate’s accounts — that’s where they 
belong, after all. You have to notify the IRS, 
however, that the estate is going to declare 
this income. You can do this by completing 
and filing a nominee Form 1099 with the IRS, 
showing the decedent (with his or her Social 
Security Number) as the Payer, and the estate 
(with its TIN) as the Recipient. Because these 
are optically scanned forms, you can’t use the 
samples on the IRS Web site, but they’re usually 
available for free from any IRS office during tax 
season. You can also get them by mail by call-
ing 800-829-3676 (IRS Forms), and you receive 
them within ten business days, or you can buy 
them in January or February from any stationery 
or office supply store if you’re willing to buy a 
large quantity. If you’ve failed to file nominee 
1099s, you can still let the IRS know where the 
income you’re reporting was originally reported 
to them. Merely place a notation on the estate’s 
tax return showing that the estate received the 

285
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
Other income
You’ve already figured out that you need to declare all income whether it 
falls into any of the categories already described in this section or not, 
and you need to pay any income taxes owed on it. Line 8 of Form 1041 
(Form 1041, line 21) is where you put those items that defy description, 
the ones that you can’t possibly squeeze into any of the categories already 
listed. While on Form 1040, popular “other income” items include fees and 
honoraria and jury duty pay, on Form 1041, the most common item will be 
taxable state income tax refunds. If the trust or estate is a party to a lawsuit 
(either its own, or as a successor to the decedent), place any taxable awards 
received here.
Finally, although most itemized deductions are equally deductible on a Form 
1040 or Form 1041, you may only deduct medical expenses on Form 1040, and 
not on Form 1041. If, in the course of administering the estate, you pay final 
medical bills for the decedent, you don’t need to lose those deductions. The 
IRS allows even cash-basis taxpayers to deduct medical expenses paid within 
a year after death on the decedent’s final Form 1040.
Deducing Deductions
Although the rules governing deductions are generally the same whether 
you’re filing a tax return for an estate or trust or one for the decedent, some 
differences do apply. After all, how interesting would the world be if all rules 
were absolute? This section gives you the lowdown on taking deductions on 
the two different tax forms.
For some inexplicable reason, itemized deductions for Form 1041 are included 
on the front of the form; for Form 1040, you have to go to Schedule A, Itemized 
Deductions. Check out the most recent version of Taxes For Dummies, by 
Tyson, Munro, and Silverman, for the current line on how to fill out Schedule A.
Interest
Whether you’re responsible for filing a Form 1040 or a Form 1041, the follow-
ing types of interest are deductible:
income in the name and Social Security Number 
of the decedent. Ideally, if you use this method, 
you should also file a dummy Form 1040 for the 
decedent, showing the receipt of the income, 
and then offsetting payments to the estate, 
making sure to include the estate’s TIN.

286
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
✓ Interest paid on a mortgage that is secured by real estate (including 
interest on home equity lines of credit)
 
✓ Interest that you pay for a stock margin account
Personal interest paid on such things as credit card debts, unsecured loans, 
or unpaid tax bills is never deductible.
But wait! This rule has an exception, too. If you elect to pay the estate tax 
under Section 6166 (that’s an election to spread out the payment of the 
estate taxes owed over a ten-year period), you get to deduct that interest on 
Form 1041, even though it’s interest on an unpaid tax bill. Why? Even though 
it’s so-called personal interest, it’s also an interest payment that arises only 
because you’re dealing with an estate (or a successor-in-interest trust, which 
receives the assets of the estate after estate administration is complete). You 
can deduct expenses the estate or trust incurs for being an estate or trust; 
the fact that only an estate or trust can pay Section 6166 interest overrides 
the rule that personal interest is nondeductible.
Taxes
Generally speaking, taxes in a trust or estate refer to real estate taxes and 
state and local income taxes. Although individuals also have the option of 
deducting state and local sales taxes instead of income taxes, that option 
doesn’t exist in the estate/trust environment. We think the IRS has figured 
out that estates and trusts aren’t out there buying consumer goods, but 
that’s only a guess on our part.
Just as you get to do on Schedule A, you can deduct the actual amounts you 
paid as taxes during the estate or trust’s tax year on line 11 of Form 1041. 
Remember, you get the deduction only for amounts you actually paid, so 
don’t include estimated taxes you paid in the first month of the following tax 
year. However, pick up your fourth quarter estimated tax payment from the 
prior tax year if you paid it in the current year. Also, if you applied an over-
payment from last year’s return to this year’s, pick up the overpayment not 
only as income (if you deducted it in the prior year) on line 8 of Form 1041 
but also as a deduction on line 11.
Fiduciary fees
If you’re doing all this work out of the goodness of your heart, you can skip 
right over line 12 of Form 1041. But if you’ve figured out that the amount of 
work involved in administering this trust or estate is so much that you really 
need to be paid, this point is where you deduct your fee for services, called 
fiduciary fees.

287
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
Fiduciary fees (the amounts executors, administrators, or trustees charge 
for their services) are generally fully deductible. But if some portion of the 
income for the estate or trust comes from municipal bonds or other tax-
exempt vehicles (tax-exempt money market funds, for example), you’re 
required to allocate fiduciary fees between taxable and tax-exempt income, 
and you get to deduct only the amount allocable to taxable income. To calcu-
late the allocation, subtotal the income shown on lines 1 through 8 of Form 
1041 and add the tax-exempt income from line 1 in “Other Information” on 
the back of the return to arrive at total income. Divide the total income by 
the total taxable income and multiply the results by the total fiduciary fees. 
You take the deductible fees on line 12 and subtract the balance from the 
total tax-exempt income to arrive at the adjusted tax-exempt income. Place 
that number on Schedule B, line 2.
For estates, you probably want to base the executor’s fee you charge on the 
number of hours you actually work on estate matters. Set a rate that you feel 
your time is worth, and keep careful track of your time. See Chapter 9 for a 
further discussion of how to arrive at an executor’s fee. For trusts, if you’re 
making the investment decisions, you may want to obtain a fee schedule from 
a trust company, which charges its trust clients a percentage of the market 
value of the assets it holds, plus a percentage of income collected, as its fee. 
Your fee shouldn’t exceed that of a bank or trust company, and it probably 
will be less, because your overhead is much less. If you’re paying an outside 
advisor for investment advice, you’ll most likely want to subtract his fee from 
the one the bank or trust company charges; after all, investment advice is 
already included in the fee he charges.
Charitable deductions
The rule concerning charitable deductions is fairly straightforward. You can’t 
give away money from an estate or trust to charity, no matter how good the 
cause, unless the decedent’s will (or the trust instrument) tells you to. Because 
this rule is absolute, you don’t often see charitable deductions on an estate 
or trust income tax return. You’re not even allowed to take a deduction for 
the contents of the house or the decedent’s clothes that you gave away to 
Goodwill unless the decedent directed you to do that under his or her will.
If the terms of the decedent’s will direct that you give a percentage of the 
estate (or, for particularly generous decedents, the whole shebang) to char-
ity, you calculate the charitable deduction on Schedule A, located on the back 
of Form 1041. Other times, charitable deductions can occur when the trust or 
estate owns a partnership or S corporation interest, and that entity gave to 
charity. Since the decision to give wasn’t yours, you may take the deduction.
Frequently, donors establish trusts with either whole or partial charitable 
interests, and fund them either by gifts made before death, or from their 
estates after death. These trusts may either be set up as private foundations, 

288
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
or as charitable lead (or remainder) annuity trusts, or Unitrusts. In most cases, 
these trusts don’t file a Form 1041, and the returns they do file (Forms 5227 
or 990-PF) aren’t for the faint of heart. If you’re named as trustee for one of 
these types of trusts, get an attorney, accountant, or enrolled agent experi-
enced with these returns who can assist you in tax preparation. Strangely 
enough, most tax professionals don’t prepare these sorts of returns, so 
be sure that you find someone who has the expertise you need. Check out 
Chapter 3 for a description of each of these types of trusts.
Attorney, accountant, and preparer fees
Although Schedule A of Form 1040 limits deductibility for attorney, accoun-
tant, and return-preparer fees, Form 1041 allows you to fully deduct these 
fees (which are miscellaneous itemized deductions limited to amounts more 
than 2 percent of adjusted gross income). If you have tax exempt income 
on question 1 of the “Other Information” section on the back of the 1041, 
you have to split the fees between taxable and tax-exempt income, and are 
only allowed to deduct the portion attributable to the taxable income. For 
details on how to allocate between taxable and tax-exempt income, look at 
“Fiduciary fees” earlier in this chapter. After you add your fees, and allocate 
when necessary, place your deduction on line 14 of Form 1041.
Miscellaneous itemized deductions
If you’ve run out of specific categories but still have some things you sus-
pect you can deduct, lines 15a and 15b of Form 1041 are where you need to 
be. Just like Schedule A of Form 1040, some of these miscellaneous itemized 
deductions (which include fees for investment advice, security fees that your 
broker may charge you, or safe deposit box fees) are subject to the so-called 
2 percenthaircut (you can only deduct amounts that are greater than 2 percent 
of adjusted gross income); others aren’t, such as the amount you spend on 
postage and making photocopies. Remember, the general rule that expenses 
that are incurred only because this is an estate or trust are fully deductible, 
while fees that anyone in the position of looking after investments would pay 
are subject to the 2 percent exclusion. The following sections outline the mis-
cellaneous itemized deductions you can make.
Deductions not subject to the 2 percent floor
More likely than not, many of the miscellaneous itemized deductions are sub-
ject to the 2 percent floor. So which ones aren’t subject? Because the estate 
isn’t likely to have gambling losses (at least it better not have — otherwise, you 
may be in trouble with more people than just your corner bookie), impairment-
related work expenses of a disabled person, or unrecovered investment in a 
pension, you may be wondering what, if anything, you can deduct on line 15a 
of Form 1041. The answer is simple.

289
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
Any expense the trust or estate has incurred only because of its trust or 
estate status is deductible here. So if you’re dealing with a law firm that 
charges for every copy and stamp it uses on your behalf, the deduction for 
miscellaneous costs goes here. So do filing fees for the probate court, pub-
lication costs for the newspaper ads ordered by the probate court, and the 
premium for surety bonds (a type of insurance policy indicating that you don’t 
intend to abscond with the funds).
Deductions subject to the 2 percent floor
Line 15b of Form 1041 is the place for all other miscellaneous deductions: 
Investment advice, safe deposit box rentals, service charges on dividend 
reinvestment plans (DRIPs), and travel expenses. Payments to obtain dupli-
cate stock certificates go here. So do costs to purchase your own supplies 
(stationery, stamps, and the like).
Unless the trust or estate didn’t make any distributions to beneficiaries 
during the year, determining the 2 percent you have to exclude is a tricky, 
circular calculation. Because you can’t find a computer tax-help program for 
Form 1041 preparation, you probably want to hire a tax professional to assist 
you if you have lots of deductions subject to the 2 percent floor. As a practi-
cal matter, if you only have minor deductions here and you feel otherwise 
equal to the task of preparing the Form 1041, leaving those deductions off 
may be easier; the tax benefit to the trust, estate, or income beneficiaries will 
be far less than the cost to have the return professionally prepared.
Avoid double-dipping deductions
Chapter 17 tells you that many of the deductions 
available on the Form 706 are the same as ones 
listed in this chapter, and you may be wonder-
ing if you can have it both ways, deducting them 
the first time on the 706 and then again on the 
1041. Well, you can’t. In fact, the IRS refers to 
this practice as double dipping and seriously 
frowns upon it.
So choose. When you have an estate that owes 
estate tax, compare the tax rates for the estate 
tax and the income tax (the estate tax is almost 
always higher), and take the deductions on the 
return that is paying a higher rate of tax. On the 
other hand, if you must file a 706 but won’t owe 
any estate taxes (perhaps because of a surviv-
ing spouse and an unlimited marital deduction), 
deduct only things like funeral expenses and 
debts of the decedent (which aren’t deduct-
ible on the 1041) on the 706. Include all estate 
administration costs on the 1041.
As with every rule, the double-dipping rules 
have a couple of exceptions. Real estate taxes 
that have been assessed but not paid as of the 
date of death are a valid debt of the decedent 
on Form 706, but as the estate pays them, they 
also become an income tax deduction available 
to the estate. And medical expenses billed after 
death are a debt of the estate on the 706, but you 
can include them on the decedent’s final Form 
1040 as a medical deduction. Just to let the IRS 
know that you haven’t double dipped, you must 
attach a signed statement that any deductions 
taken on the estate’s Form 1041 haven’t been 
taken on the estate’s Form 706.

290
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Calculating the Income Distribution 
Deduction (Schedule B)
Unique to the world of trusts and estates is the concept of the Income 
Distribution Deduction (Schedule B). When trusts and estates pass out pay-
ments of income to beneficiaries (as opposed to payments of specific property 
called for under the will or the trust instrument), those payments carry income 
tax consequences for the trust or estate and for the beneficiaries. The trust 
or estate receives a deduction, and the beneficiaries must include the amount 
deducted from the Form 1041 on their individual Form 1040. Form 1041, 
Schedule B synthesizes all the info you’ve compiled to this point into the 
all-important income distribution deduction.
Although Schedule B may look intimidating, it’s really not so bad. Just follow 
these steps (unless the trust or estate is in its final year):
 
1. Take the total from line 17 on the front of Form 1041 (line 1).
 
2. Add that total to the adjusted tax-exempt interest, which is nothing 
more than total tax-exempt interest less fiduciary and other fees allo-
cated to it (also known as the contents of line 2).
 
3. Enter the net capital gain (flip your tax return to its front, and place 
the number you see on line 4 onto Schedule B, line 6 on the back).
 
4. Subtract that number from your total of Schedule B, lines 1 and 2, to 
arrive at the distributable net income (DNI), or the total amount that 
could possibly be taxed to the beneficiary if the world were perfectly 
round and all the planets were aligned.
If you’re preparing the return for an estate or simple trust, you can ignore 
Schedule B, line 8. If yours is a complex trust, though, and you’re either not 
required to distribute all income or you distributed more than just income, 
you need to calculate trust accounting income (TAI). To calculate TAI, add 
lines 1 through 8 from the front of Form 1041 and the tax-exempt income 
from line 1 of “Other Information” on the back of Form 1041. Subtract capital 
gains or losses (line 4, Form 1041) and all fees and expenses that you charged 
against the income earned in the trust. Exclude fees and expenses charged 
against principal (including whatever fees you paid from the capital gains) 
when calculating TAI, and don’t allocate any of the income fees you’ve paid 
between taxable and tax-exempt income.
On Schedule B, line 11, you put the total amount of distributions made from 
the estate or trust to beneficiaries during the tax year. These amounts may 
be mandatory, such as in the case of a simple trust, where all income must be 
distributed in the tax year that you’re preparing the return for. In this case, 
one of three scenarios may apply: 

291
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
 
✓ If you’re required to distribute all, or any part, of the trust’s income, no 
ifs, ands, or buts, place the amount you’re required to pay to the benefi-
ciary (even if you didn’t actually pay it) on line 9.
 
✓ Any amounts of income you paid to the beneficiary at your discretion, 
but that weren’t mandated by the trust instrument, belong on line 10.
 
✓ The total of lines 9 and 10 belongs on line 11.
On line 12, calculate what portion of that total distribution came from tax-
exempt income. If you distributed 100 percent of the income, place the 
number you have on Schedule B, line 2. If you distributed less than 100 per-
cent, calculate the percentage of income you did distribute, and then mul-
tiply that percentage by the amount on Schedule B, line 2. Subtract line 12 
from line 11 to arrive at line 13, Schedule B.
The income distribution deduction is an either/or calculation, and now that 
you’ve calculated either (line 13), you need to also arrive at or (line 14). This 
part is much easier — just subtract line 2 of Schedule B from line 7 and place 
your answer on line 14. Compare lines 13 and 14. The smaller of the two is 
the income distribution deduction. Place your answer on line 15, Schedule B, 
and then carry the result to line 18 on page 1 of Form 1041.
Calculating the estate tax deduction
Very often, an estate has, as an asset, the right to receive items of income on 
which income tax has yet to be paid. If the estate is large enough to pay an estate 
tax, those income items (called Income in Respect of Decedent or IRD) are taxed 
twice — once on the transfer of property (estate tax), and the second time on 
the receipt of income (income tax). Of course, this double taxation on the part of 
Congress is grossly unfair and expensive and completely uncalled for. Congress, 
to its credit, has recognized this problem and instituted the estate tax deduction.
The types of IRD that most commonly trigger the estate tax deduction are 
pensions and IRAs, final wages, and the sale of property (either due to an 
ongoing installment sale or because the decedent dies after the purchase and 
sale agreement is signed, but prior to the actual property transfer).
If you’re administering a large estate and have paid an estate tax, you may 
be entitled to a deduction on the estate or trust’s income tax return (on 
Form 1041, line 19) for the portion of estate taxes paid on these IRD items. 
You determine this deduction by calculating the estate tax based on the 
value of the total estate, including IRD, and then calculating it a second time on 
the value without IRD. The difference in the two calculations is the amount of 
estate tax paid on that piece of income; this is the amount of your deduction. 
Chapter 16 walks you through the estate tax calculation. After you’ve done it 
twice (once with IRD, and once without), you’ll be a pro at it.

292
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Computing the taxes owed
No matter which tax return you’re preparing (the decedent’s personal 
return or one for an estate or trust), you have to calculate the tax after you 
figure out the income and the deductions. If you’re working on the dece-
dent’s return, you arrive at your tax liability exactly the same way as you 
would your own (check out the latest version of Taxes For Dummies, by 
Tyson, Munro, and Silverman, for current tax rate tables and information 
on Schedule D and the AMT). If you’re finishing up a Form 1041 and need to 
figure out Schedule G (on the back), read on. The following is a list of the dif-
ferent types of tax computations you may need to perform before you can 
put the finishing touches on the tax return you’re preparing.
Ordinary tax computation
You can find tax rate tables for estates and trusts, which change every 
year, in the Form 1041 instructions for that year, which you can locate at 
www.irs.gov under “Forms and Instructions.”
One reason why many executors, administrators, and trustees choose to make 
distributions to beneficiaries is that the government taxes estates and trusts 
very heavily on ordinary income. For example, in 2007, ordinary income for 
Paying estimated taxes
The income tax system is a pay-as-you-go 
endeavor. That’s why the government with-
holds income taxes from some people, and 
others make quarterly estimated payments. But 
you’ll find exceptions in the world of trusts and 
estates:
 ✓ After someone dies, he is no longer respon-
sible for making estimated tax payments 
on individual federal returns. If the dece-
dent’s final individual return is joint with 
his spouse, only pay estimated taxes on the 
spouse’s income, not on the decedent’s.
 ✓ Because of all the early confusion associ-
ated with a new estate (and because you 
can scarcely determine what the income 
will be in an estate that’s just beginning), 
the government doesn’t require you to file 
federal estimates for the first two years of 
an estate’s existence. If you’re dealing with 
a trust that’s essentially operating as the 
estate, the same two-year federal exemp-
tion applies.
For all other trusts, the pay-as-you-go plan 
is in place. If you fail to make your estimated 
tax payments, you’ll be charged a penalty for 
underpayment of estimated taxes. Although 
the sun still rises when this slip-up happens 
(and these things often fall through the cracks, 
especially at first), you never want to cough up 
extra dollars to the government when you don’t 
have to.
Finally, keep in mind that these are federal rules; 
state rules may be different. Check with the tax 
authority in the state where the estate or trust is 
resident to determine your state’s rules.

293
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
estates and trusts of more than $10,450 was taxed at 35 percent (the top rate), 
while an individual’s Form 1040 would have to show $349,700 of ordinary tax-
able income before paying tax at the 35 percent rate in that same year. By 
making distributions, you pass that taxable income to the beneficiaries, who 
are, most likely, in a lower tax bracket, reducing the total amount of tax paid.
Capital gains and qualified dividends computation
No matter whether you’re filing a tax return for an individual, a trust, or an 
estate, capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at special, fixed rates; 
you calculate these taxes on the worksheets attached to Schedule D. Even 
though the worksheet looks intimidating, all it does is strip out the various 
types of capital gains property and apply the correct tax rate to those gains. 
If you have any entries on Schedule D, or you have qualified dividends, taking 
a few minutes with this worksheet can save you big bucks because you pay 
far lower rates on most capital gains and qualified dividends than you do 
on other types of income. For example, a trust with $22,000 total income, of 
which $12,000 is ordinary income, and $10,000 is a long-term capital gain, 
would pay $6,743.50 in tax if there were no preferential capital gains tax rate, 
but will actually pay only $4,743.50 ($3,243.50 tax on ordinary income, 
and $1,500 tax on long-term capital gains), a $2,000 tax savings.
Whether you calculate your tax by using the worksheet on the back of 
Schedule D or the tax rate table, place the total tax on taxable income on 
line 1a of Schedule G, Form 1041.
Tax on lump-sum distributions
Sometimes, through no fault of your own, the estate you’re administering 
is saddled with the payout of the entire balance of an employer’s qualified 
retirement account (see Chapter 7), which shoots the estate’s income tax 
liability through the roof. If the decedent was born prior to January 2, 1936, 
his or her estate may be eligible to use ten-year averaging and/or 20 percent 
capital gains rules when calculating the taxes owed, which may result in sub-
stantially lower taxes than if you calculated the taxes in the ordinary way.
Prepare these special calculations on Form 4972, Tax on Lump-Sum 
Distributions. Instructions for this form are included with the form, which is 
available from www.irs.gov. Just look for it under “Forms and Instructions.” 
After you finish Form 4972, you place the taxes on lump sum distributions on 
line 1b of Schedule G, Form 1041.
Alternative minimum tax
Since 1986, every trust and estate has been required to do the alternative 
minimum tax (AMT) calculation, even if the trust or estate isn’t subject to the 
AMT. (The AMT is a flat tax designed to prevent certain high-income individu-
als, estates, and trusts from not paying any, or enough, income tax.) And, like 

294
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
the AMT calculations found on Form 6251 for individuals (see the current edi-
tion of Taxes For Dummies, by Tyson, Munro, and Silverman), the fiduciary 
calculation is also a bear.
You can find the AMT schedule (all 4 parts and 76 lines) for trusts and estates 
on pages 3 and 4 of Form 1041, under Schedule I. Using the following list, which 
gives you the basics about each part, you should be able to prepare this with a 
little patience. You can find the line-by-line directions in the Form 1041 instruc-
tions, available at www.irs.gov under “Forms and Instructions.”
Part I: Estate or Trust’s Share of Alternative Minimum Taxable Income
 
1. Take your adjusted total income from page 1, line 17 and add back 
any interest, taxes, or miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to 
the 2 percent (Form 1041, line 15a) you’ve previously deducted; sub-
tract any income tax refunds included as income on line 8.
 
 Among other frequent AMT add-back items are interest from private 
activity bonds, net operating losses, and AMT adjustments from other 
estates or trusts. Check the line-by-line instructions for a complete list.
 
2. Add the beginning adjusted total income to your adjustments. Put the 
total on line 25, adjusted alternative minimum taxable income.
 
3. Finally, subtract the income distribution deduction from Schedule I, 
Part II, line 44, and the estate tax deduction (Form 1041, line 19).
 
 If your total comes to less than the exemption amount (which you’ll find 
on line 29 of Schedule I), you’re finished! This estate isn’t subject to the 
AMT this year. If your total is more than the exemption, keep going.
Part II: Income Distribution Deduction on a Minimum Tax Basis:
If you made distributions to income beneficiaries during the year, you need to 
complete this part, whether or not the trust or estate is subject to the AMT.
 
1. Refer to the section “Calculating the Income Distribution Deduction 
(Schedule B)” earlier in this chapter to review this calculation. 
 
2. Redo the calculation, taking into consideration that your starting 
point is different and that you may have less tax-exempt interest, in 
which case your adjusted tax-exempt interest may be different.
 
 Remember, private activity bond interest is taxable for AMT purposes.
Part III: Alternative Minimum Tax:
Lines 45 through 56 are where you actually calculate the additional tax, if 
any, that the trust or estate has to pay due to the AMT. Go carefully through 
these lines; although the instructions for the calculation are clearly printed 
on Schedule I itself, you can easily make a mistake, especially if you’re pre-
paring the form manually.

295
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
Part IV: Line 52 Computation Using Maximum Capital Gains Rates:
Lines 57 through 76 mirror the calculations you already made on the back 
of Schedule D so that capital gains continue to receive preferential tax treat-
ment. Once again, the instructions are on the face of the return. Be careful 
not to mix up line numbers (one of us is famous for putting the right answer 
on the wrong line), as this is one form you don’t want to prepare twice.
If you’re unfortunate enough to have a number on line 56 of Schedule I, the 
trust or estate owes this additional tax. Copy the amount on line 56 onto 
line 1c of Schedule G, Form 1041.
Credits
After you put the sum of lines 1a through 1c on line 1d of Schedule G, you’re 
ready to see whether you can reduce your tax with tax credits. Tax credits 
are dollar-for-dollar amounts that you subtract from your tax liability; they’re 
much better than deductions. Estates and trusts aren’t eligible for most of 
the tax credits individuals can take, and no credit on Form 1041 can reduce 
the tax liability below zero.
However, on lines 2a through 2d of Schedule G, you have the opportunity to 
reduce the trust or estate’s tax liability with the following credits:
 
✓ Foreign tax credit: You’re entitled to take a credit for taxes you’ve paid to a 
foreign country with whom the U.S. has a tax treaty (which is almost every-
where, with a few exceptions like Iraq, Iran, and North Korea). If the amount 
of foreign taxes paid is $300 or less, you can just fill in the amount actually 
paid on line 2a. However, if the amount is greater than $300, you have to 
become acquainted with Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit. The IRS under-
stands that this form is evil (which is why they allow you to skip it for rela-
tively small amounts), and it estimates that it should take you about seven 
hours to complete. If you made income distributions to beneficiaries during 
the year, you should allocate the applicable portion of the foreign tax credit 
to the beneficiary as his or her percentage share of the total income. 
 
 Form 1116 has been known to bring even the most brilliant accountants 
to their knees. If you need to attach one of these forms to your return, 
you may want to consult a professional here.
 
✓ Other nonbusiness credits: You may not be able to take the child tax 
credit, but if the trust or estate purchases an alternative fuel car (we 
know, it’s a bit unlikely, but you never know), you’re in luck. Place the 
credit for your hybrid automobile here, on line 2b of Schedule G.
 
✓ General business credits: Enter the total of all the general business credits 
the trust or estate is entitled to on Form 3800, General Business Credit, 
on line 2c of Schedule G. If you made income distributions during the year, 
be careful not to include any credits on Form 1041 that are allocable to the 
income beneficiary. 

296
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
 
✓ Credit for prior year minimum tax: If the trust or estate paid AMT in a 
prior year, it may be eligible to reclaim some part of that tax on Schedule 
G, line 2d. Complete Form 8801, Credit for Prior Year Minimum Tax – 
Individuals, Estates and Trusts to see if this return qualifies.
Additional taxes
Even if you manage to reduce the estate, trust, or decedent’s income tax 
liability to zero with a combination of deductions and credits, you may still 
have taxes to pay. Lines 5 and 6 of Schedule G, Form 1041 are where you find 
these additional taxes. They’re not really income taxes, but they’re here on 
an income tax form for lack of any better place to put them.
Recapture taxes
Sometimes you receive a credit in a prior year, and then, in the current year, 
you find you’re no longer eligible for it. For example, say you purchased a 
hybrid car last year and then found out this year that you aren’t entitled to a 
credit for that car. Welcome to the world of recapture taxes, which recapture 
tax benefits that the IRS didn’t want to let slip away. Complete Form 4255, 
Recapture of Investment Credit or Form 8611, Recapture of Low-Income 
Housing Credit, and then fill in the total on line 5, Schedule G.
Recapture taxes are a fairly technical area. If you suspect you may be subject 
to them, you may want to check in with a qualified tax advisor for assistance.
Household employee taxes
When a trust pays for household help for a beneficiary, or an estate pays the 
final wages of the decedent’s household help, you may have to complete and 
file Schedule H (Form 1040), Household Employment Taxes. This form is 
fairly self-explanatory, but you can find a more complete explanation of it in 
the current version of Taxes For Dummies by Tyson, Munro, and Silverman. 
Put the total household taxes calculated on Form 1041, Schedule G, line 6.
Answering the Questions on the 
Back of Page 2 (Form 1041)
If you’re preparing Form 1041, you’re almost done. All that’s left is answering 
some questions at the bottom of page 2.
 
✓ Place the total tax-exempt income we talked about in the “Interest” section 
on the line underneath Question 1.

297
 Chapter 18: Filing Income Tax Returns for a Decedent, Estate, or Trust
 
✓ When the trust or estate reports earnings of any type that were earned 
by an individual, check the “Yes” box for Question 2.
 
✓ Question 3 wants to know about cash and securities held in foreign 
accounts. Refer to the list of assets you compiled in Chapter 7, and see 
if this estate or trust has any foreign accounts. If your trust or estate 
falls into this category, check the “Yes” box, and enter the name of the 
foreign country below question 3. Remember, if the trust or estate has 
no foreign accounts, but owns foreign securities in a U.S. based account, 
the answer to this question is “no”.
 
✓ Along the same lines, Question 4 needs to know about distributions from 
foreign sources, or whether or not your estate or trust funded a foreign 
trust. If you answer “yes” and the combined total of all foreign accounts 
is greater than $10,000, you may have to file Form TD F 90-22.1, Report 
of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts. You can find this form online at 
www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f90122-1.pdf.
 
✓ Question 5 asks whether the estate or trust is the holder of a residential 
mortgage and receives interest payments on that loan. Look back over 
your list of assets, and make sure there’s no promissory note or mort-
gage still generating payments buried at the bottom of the list.
 
✓ If the trust or the estate elects, it may choose to pay the beneficiaries’ 
income earned in the tax year in question as late as 65 days into the next 
tax year. If you want to make this election, perhaps because you don’t 
know until after December 31 how much income you should pass out to 
the beneficiaries, check the box next to Question 6. 
 
✓ If you are distributing property in kind (you actually passed the shares 
of stock out to the beneficiary, instead of selling them and giving him or 
her a check), you can elect to recognize the gain on that transaction at 
the trust or estate level. When you include this transaction on Schedule 
D to report the gain, and pay the tax, the beneficiary then receives the 
property with the higher, date-of-distribution basis. Check the box next 
to Question 7 to make this election (under Code Section 643(e)(3)).
 
✓ Question 8 assumes that most estates run their course within the first 
two years of the decedent’s date of death. If the estate you’re adminis-
tering stretches out longer than that, the IRS wants a brief explanation. 
Check the box and attach a brief statement.
 
✓ Question 9 is looking for information about skip beneficiaries so that the 
IRS can attempt to collect even more tax under the generation skipping 
transfer tax rules. Generally, a skip beneficiary is someone who is more 
than one generation below that of the transferor of the property. So, 
grandchildren may be skip beneficiaries of their grandparents’ estates. 
In the case of unrelated parties, a skip beneficiary is anyone who is more 
than 371/2 years younger than the transferor.

L
ooking for hard and fast rules for almost anything is human nature. You 
stop at red lights and go when they turn green, but yellow lights seem to 
confuse people. Figuring out who gets to pay the income tax on income earned 
in a trust or estate is something like a yellow light: Sometimes the trust or 
estate pays it, and other times the beneficiary does.
In this chapter, we continue where we left off in Chapter 18 regarding 
Form 1041, U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts, focusing on 
Schedule K-1, Beneficiary’s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. You 
see what’s included on it and what’s not. You also discover the formula 
necessary to calculate each of the numbers. Finally, you can find out how 
to report income to a beneficiary when you don’t have to file Form 1041.
Understanding the Schedule K-1
A trust or estate that makes distributions to beneficiaries receives an income 
tax deduction for the exact amount of taxable income that’s been distrib-
uted (and income always pays out to beneficiaries before principal). This 
is the so-called income distribution deduction, or IDD, which is calculated on 
Form 1041, Schedule B, on page 2 of Form 1041 (see Chapter 18). Although 
the IDD as determined by Schedule B is a lump-sum calculation, it may com-
prise many pieces: dividends, interest, capital gains, rents, state income tax 
refunds. In fact, a trust or estate may be passing out pieces of any number of 
types of income. And, when trusts and estates pass out income, that income 
retains its character. So dividends earned by a trust and then paid to a benefi-
ciary remain taxable as dividends, capital gains stay capital gains, tax-exempt 

300
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
income remains tax-exempt income, and so on. Thus, for example, interest 
and dividends originally earned by the ABC Trust appear on the beneficiary’s 
Form 1040 on Schedule B, rental income lands on Schedule E, and the foreign 
income earned and taxes paid by the trust but allocated to the beneficiary 
land on Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit.
Because the income (and deductions, if any) received by the beneficiaries 
retains its character, you have to tell the beneficiaries what that character 
consists of. Do this by completing Schedule K-1 (Form 1041). The Schedule 
K-1 gives the beneficiary the specific allocation between all items of income 
(and sometimes deductions and credits, too), allowing easy transfer of the 
information from the K-1 to the beneficiary’s Form 1040.
Your job is relatively simple when you’re dealing with only one income 
beneficiary. The total amount of the IDD (Form 1041, Schedule B, line 15) is 
shown on a single Schedule K-1, with allocations made only between the dif-
ferent types of income. When there are multiple beneficiaries, though, you’re 
required to prepare a separate K-1 for each, with the total IDD divided among 
the beneficiaries on their K-1s in the same proportion as the distributions 
were made. So, if the calculated IDD is $10,000, and one beneficiary received 
half of the total distributed, his or her Schedule K-1 will show a total of $5,000 
of income. This section walks you through the Schedule K-1.
General information
You can compare Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) to a giant, combined Form 1099 
and Form 1098. And, like both Form 1099 and 1098, it contains much of the 
same identifying information. Schedule K-1 allows your beneficiary to sepa-
rate his or her income distribution into all the sorts of income received by 
the trust or estate; Figure 19-1 shows how much you can cram onto it.
Schedule K-1 (Form 1041) is an attachment to Form 1041, and you must dis-
tribute a copy of it to the income beneficiaries no later than the due date for 
Form 1041, as extended. Don’t delay in sending these out. Remember, the 
beneficiaries can’t prepare their 1040s until they receive their K-1s from you.
Part I: Information About the Estate or Trust
In Part I, fill out the tax identification number (the TIN), the name of the 
estate or trust, and the fiduciary’s (trustee’s or executor’s) name and address. 
In Part I, you also have the opportunity to check a box to indicate whether 
and when you filed Form 1041-T, Allocation of Estimated Tax Payments to 
Beneficiaries (Under Code Section 643(g)).
By checking Part I, Box D of Schedule K-1, you tell the beneficiary that he 
or she now has credit for additional tax payments, even though the trustee 
originally paid them on behalf of the trust.

For calendar year 2007,
 
What’s Code Section 643(g)? It’s the section of the Internal Revenue Code 
that allows you to assign estimated taxes paid by the trust or estate to 
individual beneficiaries in the final year of the trust or estate. For example, 
Trust XYZ pays estimated taxes of $1,000 during the year, only to find out 

302
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
toward the end of the year that the trust is terminating at the end of the year. 
Because the trust won’t owe any tax in its final year, it doesn’t need the esti-
mated tax payments. Rather than have the IRS refund the $1,000 to the now-
defunct trust after it files its final 1041, the trustee may elect to assign that 
estimated tax to the trust’s beneficiaries by filing Form 1041-T.
In theory, Form 1041-T is a practical solution to reducing or eliminating 
underpayment penalties for beneficiaries who had no way to plan for the 
additional income that’s passing to them from the trust. In practice, it’s not 
so straightforward. The IRS doesn’t see too many Form 1041-Ts in the course 
of a year, and isn’t quite sure what it’s supposed to do with them when it 
does. It often applies the tax allocations incorrectly, if at all, leaving you to 
sort out a mess you didn’t make. Use your judgment before filing Form 1041-
T; if the amounts involved are small, it may just not be worth your while.
Form 1041-T may only be filed in the final year of the trust or estate, is irrevo-
cable, and must be made on or before the 65th day of the year following the 
end of the trust or estate’s tax year (for calendar year filers, that’s March 6, 
or March 5 during leap years). So, if you’ve made a Code Section 643(g) elec-
tion and allocated the estimated taxes, you have to check Box E to indicate 
it’s the final year of the trust or estate.
Part II: Information About the Beneficiary
Schedule K-1, Part II is about as simple as it gets. On line F, put in the benefi-
ciary’s TIN, and on line G, fill in the beneficiary’s name and address.
In Box H, choose between a domestic or foreign beneficiary, whichever 
applies. If the beneficiary lives in the U.S. (and that includes resident aliens 
who have legally established residence in the U.S.), no further information 
is necessary. If the beneficiary resides in a foreign country, you may want to 
consult with a competent tax advisor who can check the foreign tax treaties 
involved and make sure you’re not required to withhold U.S. income taxes on 
distributions to this beneficiary.
Income items
The best Schedule K-1 is the one that completely breaks down the information 
into its component parts. Don’t assume that just because the trust or estate’s 
tax returns don’t require certain information, the beneficiaries don’t either. As 
fiduciary, you want to make their lives as easy as possible.
Among the different types of income that may appear are
 
✓ Interest: Although the total taxable interest figure, including U.S. 
Treasury interest, belongs on line 1, show allocations of U.S. Treasury 
interest (included on line 1, but not taxable in any state) and tax-
exempt interest (not included on line 1) separately on line 14. 

303
 Chapter 19: Reporting Tax Info on Schedule K-1
 
✓ Dividends: Place the total of all dividends, from whatever source 
(including foreign) on line 2a. On line 2b, show the qualified dividends — 
those dividends subject to a lower income tax rate. If the trust or estate 
has income from foreign sources, include that allocation somewhere on 
Schedule K-1, either on line 14 or on a supplemental statement attached 
to the back of the form.
 
✓ Capital gains: As a general rule, trusts and estates pass out capital gain 
income to beneficiaries in the final year of the trust or estate only. In the 
final year, place short-term (from the sale of capital assets held one year 
or less) capital gains or losses on line 3, and long-term capital gains or 
losses on line 4a. If you sold any artwork or collectible items (your aunt’s 
baseball cards, for example), place that amount on line 4b. Show deprecia-
tion added back under Code Section 1250, recaptured when you sell busi-
ness property you previously depreciated, on line 4c. Section 1250 gains 
can be tricky; if the Form 1041 you’re preparing has this type of income, 
have a professional help you calculate it.
 
✓ Other portfolio and nonbusiness income: What ends up on line 5 is 
typically the portion of a taxable state income tax refund.
 
✓ Ordinary business income: On line 6, place any business income that 
the trust or estate may have distributed to the beneficiary.
 
✓ Net rental real estate income: If the trust or estate owns any rental real 
estate, or owns interests in rental real estate partnerships, the rental 
income component of any beneficiary distribution belongs on line 7.
Most of the time determining what types of income the trust or estate’s 
received won’t be difficult; however, on some occasions you may not be sure 
what you’re supposed to do with a particular piece of income. Don’t hesitate 
to contact a competent tax professional to advise you.
Deductions and credits
Schedule K-1, in addition to allowing you to split each income distribution 
into all its component parts, also gives the income beneficiary all the other 
tax attributes that can pass through the trust or estate to the beneficiary.
Deductions
Except for in the last year of an estate or trust, a Schedule K-1 rarely shows any 
deductions that the beneficiary can use on his or her tax return. Deductions are 
the payments the trust or estate makes that reduce its taxable income. Still, it 
can happen, so here are a few you may see:
 
✓ Directly apportioned deductions: If the trust or estate is passing out 
depreciation (a portion of an asset’s acquisition cost that you deduct 
annually over the period of its useful life), depletion (deducting the 
reduction in value of an asset as that asset is used up) or amortization 

304
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
(reducing the cost of an intangible asset over its projected life) deduc-
tions, you place these numbers on line 9. These calculations can be 
tricky, and you may want to seek a pro here.
 
✓ Estate tax deduction: If estate tax has already been paid on a portion of 
the income earned by the trust or estate, you’re entitled to an income 
tax deduction equal to the estate taxes paid on that income. Place each 
beneficiary’s share of an estate tax deduction on Schedule K-1, line 10.
 
 For example, say the Whipple Estate, which paid an estate tax at the top 
tax rate of 45 percent, included a retirement account, on which no income 
taxes had ever been paid. Every year, it receives $10,000 from that retire-
ment account that is subject to income tax. The estate tax on each distribu-
tion is $4,500 ($10,000 × 45 percent). Assuming the eventual recipient of the 
annual distributions is also taxed in a high bracket, the potential income 
tax on each distribution could be an additional $3,500, adding to $8,000 
total tax, or 80 percent. However, the estate receives an estate tax deduc-
tion of $4,500, which may be passed out to an income beneficiary. Even if 
the beneficiary is in a high bracket, the amount of that distribution subject 
to income tax reduces to $5,500 ($10,000 distribution – $4,500 estate tax 
deduction). A 35-percent-bracket taxpayer then only pays $1,925 in income 
tax on that distribution, or $6,425 in total tax, reducing the tax rate to a 
nominal 64.25 percent. It’s not huge, but it’s better than nothing.
 
✓ Final-year deductions: Often (and despite your best efforts), you wrap 
up an estate or trust in a flurry of activity accompanied by an avalanche 
of final fees without much in the way of income to offset them. If you 
have more fees (legal, accounting, state taxes, or anything else that’s a 
legitimate income tax deduction for the trust or estate) than income in 
the final year of a trust or estate, you may give them to the beneficiaries 
on line 11 of Schedule K-1. Short- or long-term capital loss carryovers 
also belong here, as well as net operating loss carryovers, calculated 
both for regular tax computations, and for the alternative minimum tax.
Credits
Credits, those dollar-for-dollar offsets against tax that are so valuable to 
taxpayers, don’t appear frequently on Schedule K-1. But that doesn’t mean 
they’re not available. The back of Schedule K-1 has a list of credits a trust or 
estate may pass through to its income beneficiaries — you may marvel at the 
number, even as you wonder how a trust could ever generate an orphan drug 
credit. Here are the two most common:
 
✓ Credit for estimated taxes: Earlier in this chapter, in “Part I: Information 
About the Estate or Trust,” we introduce you to Form 1041-T, and the 
election that a trust or estate may make to pass estimated taxes it’s 
paid out to its income beneficiaries. If you made the election (you know 
because you already checked Part I, Box D), place this beneficiary’s 
share of estimated taxes on line 13.

305
 Chapter 19: Reporting Tax Info on Schedule K-1
 
✓ Credit for backup withholding: A beneficiary sometimes gets into trouble 
with the IRS for failing to pay his or her taxes. If that happens, you’ll receive 
a letter from the IRS instructing you to withhold income taxes on any distri-
butions to that beneficiary. If the trust or estate must withhold on distribu-
tions, place the amount that you’ve withheld and sent to the IRS on line 13.
Alternative minimum Tax information
Pass through all the tax preference items to the income beneficiaries on 
Schedule K-1, line 12, along with their income distribution. Some of these 
preference items may carry through from other sources, such as accelerated 
depreciation on rental property owned by the trust or estate. Others derive 
solely from the trust or estate itself because of deductions not allowed in the 
AMT calculation, like state taxes or miscellaneous itemized deductions.
Calculate the most common alternative minimum tax (AMT) adjustment, the 
adjustment for minimum tax purposes, by subtracting the IDD (Form 1041, 
Schedule B, line 15) from the IDD on a minimum tax basis (Form 1041, 
Schedule I, Part II, line 44). With a single income beneficiary, the entire result 
goes on Schedule K-1, line 12, Code A; allocate the total adjustment between 
multiple beneficiaries based on the relative size of their distributions.
The days are gone when messing up AMT adjustments didn’t matter much 
because very few individual taxpayers were actually in the AMT; unfortu-
nately, these AMT adjustments only gain importance as more taxpayers are 
subject to the AMT.
Allocating Types of Income on the K-1
Income earned by a trust or estate that’s paid out to a beneficiary in the same 
year as it’s earned must be reported to that beneficiary on Schedule K-1, and 
that income maintains its character when it’s distributed. But how do you 
know what type of income you’re paying out, and do you, as the trustee or 
executor, have any discretion in what forms of income you distribute?
The simple answer is, you have almost no discretion. Income passes to the 
beneficiary in the same ratio as it’s earned by the trust or estate. So, if a trust 
earns 40 percent of its income as interest, 30 percent as dividends, and 30 
percent as rental, the numbers shown on Schedule K-1 will reflect those per-
centages: 40 percent interest, 30 percent dividends, and 30 percent rental.
The one exception to this rule concerns capital gains. Except in the last year 
of the trust or estate, capital gains remain trapped at the trust or estate level, 
which pays all the income taxes due on them. Of course, there’s also an 
exception to the exception. If you, as the fiduciary, determine to distribute to 

306
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
a beneficiary the value of certain property (which must be identified prior to 
the distribution, and prior to any sale), you may elect to have the beneficiary 
pay the tax on the capital gain generated by the sale of that property. So if 
Abe, the trustee of Moe’s trust, decides to distribute the value of 50 shares of 
IBM stock to Sam, the beneficiary, he can sell those identified shares and allo-
cate any capital gain to Sam even though it’s not the last year of the trust.
Exceptions aside, you arrive at each individual number by dividing the total 
for each type of income into the total for all types of income includable 
on Schedule K-1, and then multiplying the result by the amount of the IDD 
(Form 1041, Schedule B, line 15). Allocations are made across all classes of 
income, whether taxable (dividends, taxable interest, and rents, for example) 
or nontaxable (interest from municipal bonds and tax-free mutual funds). 
Table 19-1 shows a sample, using $10,000 of income, with $7,500 of allowable

 Chapter 19: Reporting Tax Info on Schedule K-1
Preparing Supplements to Schedule K-1
Schedule K-1 allows you to put a vast amount of information on the face of 
the form, but you often want to give your beneficiaries even more. Don’t let 
the lack of specifically labeled spaces stop you. The more information you 
manage to cram onto Schedule K-1, the better off the beneficiaries are.
Trustees and executors often pay personal expenses on behalf of a ben-
eficiary (just to be certain those expenses are being paid). If you’ve paid 
medical expenses, taxes, or some other form of deductible expenses on a 
beneficiary’s behalf, include that information (listing it by category, not by 
individual payments) somewhere on either the K-1 itself or on a separate 
sheet attached to it so the beneficiary will be sure to take the deductions to 
which he or she is entitled. This section explains other information Schedule 
K-1 can include.
Showing foreign tax allocations
Foreign stocks and bonds are increasingly common in trust and estate 
accounts; so, too, are foreign taxes paid on foreign income. Be sure to pass 
out not only foreign income to beneficiaries, but also the corresponding 
amount of foreign taxes paid. Show the foreign tax amount on Schedule K-1, 
line 14, using Code B. Label the foreign income, using Code H on the same 
line. Alternatively, attach a separate page to the back of the K-1, outlining 
both the foreign income earned, and foreign taxes paid.
Providing state tax information
Because most states have their own income tax, beneficiaries use their K-1 
information to calculate their state income tax. Be sure to provide them with 
any differences that may impact their state returns, including the amount of 
U.S. Treasury interest (don’t forget U.S. Treasury dividends earned by mutual 
funds that only invest in U.S. Treasury obligations) and in-state versus out-of-
state tax-exempt interest they’ve received in their distribution.
The beneficiary’s residence, not the trust’s, is what determines what’s in-
state against what’s out-of-state for beneficiaries. So, an Ohio trust with a 
Utah resident beneficiary will want to show the Utah tax-exempt interest on 
that beneficiary’s Schedule K-1, not the Ohio. 

308
Part IV: Paying the Taxes 
Creating nominee Form 1099s
Sometimes, even when the trust or estate doesn’t have to file Form 1041, you 
still receive tax information from other sources. When you won’t be prepar-
ing a 1041 (perhaps the trust or estate has terminated), there won’t be a 
Schedule K-1 either. Instead, pass along any tax information you receive via 
a Form 1099 for income earned by property formerly owned by the trust or 
estate to the property’s new owners by issuing them a nominee Form 1099.
To prepare this form, copy the 1099 you’ve received, replacing the payer’s 
name and TIN with the trust or estate’s name (adding the words as nominee 
next to the name) and TIN. Place the new owner’s name and TIN in the spaces 
reserved for the recipient. Nominee 1099s can be typed or handwritten on 
forms available through stationery stores ( available in large quantities only), 
or from the IRS. Be sure to give a copy to the new recipient, and file the top 
copy (it’s preprinted in red) with the IRS together with Form 1096, which is 
just a transmittal sheet; the filing address appears on Form 1096.

Chapter 20
Ten Pitfalls for the Unwary
In This Chapter
▶ Avoiding careless mistakes
▶ Sidestepping administration dangers
▶ Using your judgment well
S
o much of administering a trust or estate is similar to handling your 
personal finances. However, you can easily forget that you’re actually 
working in a fiduciary capacity, not an individual one, and that there are some 
major differences. In fact, one of the biggest issues we’ve run up against when 
assisting clients, family, and friends in their adventures in administration is in 
articulating where the differences lie. This chapter covers the lessons we’ve 
both discovered regarding what you should and definitely shouldn’t do when 
administering an estate or trust.
Failing to Terminate an Existing Real 
Estate Purchase and Sale Agreement
As far as costly mistakes go, not ending an existing real estate purchase and 
sale agreement when the decedent is the seller is huge! Not doing so can sub-
stantially increase the taxes you’ll owe on the sale, costing the estate, and the 
eventual heirs, big-time.
Real estate rarely changes hands on the day the buyer and seller agree to the 
purchase and sale; in fact, it often takes many weeks, if not months, between 
the handshake and the deed. In that period between the agreement and its 
final execution, that property’s in limbo. You’ve established a price for it that 
the courts will almost always accept as its fair market value. But you’ve also 
created an expectation of money being received, which it hasn’t yet been. So, 
in essence, because the agreement was reached before the decedent’s death, 
you now have two assets:

312
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ The property itself (reportable on Form 706)
 
✓ The cash that’s been promised (reportable on Form 1041)
You, as executor, are caught in a never-never land; you’ve lost the all-
valuable step-up-in-basis described in Chapter 18, and the estate’s also not 
eligible for the $250,000 per person exclusion of capital gain because the 
exclusion is per person, not per entity.
When a seller dies in mid-property transfer, canceling the old purchase and 
sale agreement and rewriting a new one, with the estate as the seller, allows 
you to take full advantage of the all valuable step-up-in-basis, as well as 
avoids any income tax on the sale. Remember, the only difference between 
the old agreement and the new is that the decedent’s estate is now the seller, 
not the decedent.
Taking a Lump Sum Distribution 
from a Pension Plan or IRA
When you’re trying to figure out exactly how much the estate owns, you may 
be tempted to liquidate everything into cash. Although this thinking may work 
on some assets, don’t do it with any sort of pension plan or IRA. As soon as 
you cash out that deferred income retirement plan, whether it’s a traditional 
IRA, a 401(k) plan (or its public and nonprofit sector equivalents 403(b)
and 457 plans), the estate now owes income taxes on every penny of it that 
the decedent hadn’t already paid tax on. In addition to the income tax bite, 
you also owe estate taxes on the value of the account as of the date of death 
(or alternate valuation date, if you make the election; see Chapter 16). Talk 
about double taxation. One of us had an estate that held a large IRA; between 
the income and estate taxes paid, the effective tax rate was almost 97 percent.
Far better than taking a lump sum distribution is figuring out which heirs 
you can roll the account over to. If the decedent has a surviving spouse or 
children, you have no problem. Using the rollover technique, no one owes 
any income taxes until the new beneficiaries begin to take distributions; 
additionally, you can spread those distributions out over a number of years, 
lessening the tax bracket each distribution is taxed at. Of course, if you have 
a taxable estate, the value of the account at the date of death is still included 
for estate tax purposes.
Seek competent tax advice as soon as you discover a large IRA, because 
there are time limits imposed on retitling it. If the asset in question is a pen-
sion, check the plan documents to determine what options are available to 
the beneficiary.

313
 Chapter 20: Ten Pitfalls for the Unwary
Creating a Feeding Frenzy When 
Splitting Personal Property
Nothing alienates family members like weddings and funerals, and nowhere 
is this more apparent than when you’re dividing up the decedent’s personal 
property among his or her heirs. If the decedent failed to leave instructions 
regarding who was to receive what property (such instructions are usually 
kept with the Last Will but are typically not part of it; see Chapter 8), your job 
as executor is to keep the situation under control.
Keep the following do’s and don’ts in mind:
 
✓ Don’t allow anyone into the decedent’s residence unsupervised. After 
carpets, trinkets, and furniture are loaded into the back of someone’s 
van, they’re almost impossible to recover.
 
✓ Do change the locks. Do it whether or not you suspect someone may 
make a casual visit in the middle of the night. It’s just a good idea.
The most equitable way both of us have found to distribute personal prop-
erty among the heirs is to use multicolored flea market stickers, easily pur-
chased at any discount or stationery store. Give each heir one color and have 
him or her take turns (oldest to youngest, youngest to oldest, or in an order 
determined by choosing random numbers) tagging one item at a time. By the 
time you finish, you’ll discover that you’re either surrounded by a rainbow of 
tags or that people mostly just want one or two remembrances; you can sell 
the rest or give it to charity.
Missing Court Deadlines
Courts hate to be ignored. Make sure you place all the probate court’s dead-
lines on your calendar, circled, underlined, and in neon (if necessary). Even 
if you haven’t been able to complete the task set by the court (preparing the 
probate inventory, for example), showing up to explain why you’re unable 
to comply usually buys you additional time. Fail to show up, and the courts 
often demand immediate compliance.
Don’t make the mistake of thinking that the probate court isn’t a real court 
or the judge not a real judge just because proceedings have been fairly low-
key to this point. These judges have full judicial authority, which includes 
removing you as executor or trustee, fining you, throwing you in the pokey 
for contempt of court, or any other such sanctions they deem necessary to 
make you comply.

314
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Forgetting Tax Filing Deadlines
You wouldn’t fail to file your own tax returns; don’t forget to file the trust’s or 
estate’s, either. Income tax returns (Form 1041) are due three and one half 
months after the estate or trust’s year end, and estate tax returns (Form 706) 
are due nine months after the date of death. Place these dates on your calen-
dar and begin preparation far in advance of the due date so you know about 
any problems or lack of information far in advance of the filing deadline. 
Don’t forget, extensions are available if you’re unable to file returns when 
due, and you may amend returns that turn out to be incorrect.
What do you do if you know you can’t possibly get all the information prior 
to the return’s due date, even if you extend that due date by the maximum 
six months allowed? If you know it’s just a matter of a few months, or a year, 
you’re probably safe in just amending the return after you have all the per-
tinent data. If what’s missing may take longer to acquire (such as litigation 
begun during the decedent’s lifetime, to which you’ve now become a party), 
you want to suspend the statute of limitations indefinitely until you resolve 
whatever’s outstanding. To file a protective claim, write “Protective Claim 
under Reg. Sec. 301.6402-2(2)” across your return in big black letters, and 
make sure you otherwise pay all taxes due. Be sure to file your return on time 
(as extended); protective claims work only if every other aspect of the return 
you’ve filed has its t’s crossed and its i’s dotted.
Failing to Communicate with 
the Heirs and Legatees
Being a trustee or executor isn’t cloak-and-dagger stuff, and the heirs, lega-
tees (individuals left specific property under the will), and beneficiaries on 
whose behalf you’re working aren’t enemy agents. Keep them in the loop 
as much as you can. By letting them know on a regular basis where you are 
in the process and when they can realistically expect a payment from the 
estate, you’re stopping most, if not all, of their complaints before they have a 
chance to even think of them.
You can’t please all the heirs all the time, especially those who are upset that 
they weren’t named executor. Be especially responsive to their concerns: 
Because the estate process is under the probate court’s supervision, an heir 
who complains to the judge only creates more work for you because you now 
have to respond to the judge’s questions as well.

315
 Chapter 20: Ten Pitfalls for the Unwary
Exercising Poor Fiduciary Judgment
The days are long gone when executors and trustees were only rarely 
called on the carpet for exercising poor fiduciary judgment. As more 
people have started investing personally, whether through their retire-
ment accounts or through Internet brokerages, they’ve become much more 
sophisticated and knowledgeable about the entire investment process. 
And they’ve also become much more likely to comment unfavorably on 
your handling of the trust or estate’s assets. As the executor and trustee, 
you must act prudently and deliberately, seeking advice when you need it, 
investing the assets wisely, and paying the bills and the beneficiaries when 
they’re due to be paid.
Remember that the decedent or the donor chose you to look after his or 
her property because of your good judgment, so don’t hesitate to employ a 
professional to help you in choosing investments for the estate or trust. If 
you do turn to professional help, make sure you check references and deter-
mine how much experience that person has in the investment of trust and 
estate assets (which should be fairly conservatively, but broadly, invested 
across all industries). If a trust is ongoing, for example, a general rule is that 
the trust should own pieces of between 140 and 175 different companies, in 
addition to whatever bonds or other savings accounts it owns. If yours is a 
smaller trust, and buying stock in all these companies would result in pur-
chases of only a few shares, you can easily meet this standard by investing in 
a few well-chosen mutual funds.
Underestimating the Devotion Required
People rarely understand the magnitude of the task in front of them when 
someone asks them to act as executor or trustee. Even if they did, the date 
when the job ceases to be theoretical and the action really begins is often so 
far in the future that they can’t even imagine such a time.
If you’ve accepted an appointment as an executor, administrator, or trustee, 
you’ve agreed to act reasonably and responsibly. This job isn’t a small favor 
you can discharge in an hour or two, or even in a day or two. It’s a major 
commitment on your part to carry out the stated wishes of the testator or 
grantor. Treat this commitment with all the care that you would lavish on a 
beloved relative or friend.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Taking Nonsanctioned Shortcuts
As you wend your way through the seemingly endless administration of an 
estate or trust, you may be tempted to look for ways to reduce your work-
load. After all, most people take shortcuts on their personal finances, and 
everything usually works out fine. Resist the temptation to find an easier 
route through the administration process.
No one will ever disagree that many of the steps you’re supposed to take seem 
pointless, but you must take them nonetheless. So if you’re supposed to pub-
lish a notice in a certain paper, make sure to do so. If you should have a piece 
of property appraised, don’t assign it a value and move on; hire an appropri-
ate appraiser, pay the fee, and get the appraisal in writing. Taking shortcuts 
through an estate or trust may save you some time upfront, but the cleanup 
costs on the other end, when the IRS wants to see the proof that you’ve valued 
something correctly or your accounts don’t balance, can be huge.
Whether you’re administering an estate or trust under the eagle-eye supervi-
sion of the probate court or you’re merely answerable to the beneficiaries, 
you’re responsible. Failure to follow through on those responsibilities may 
open you up to removal as fiduciary as well as potential lawsuits from any 
person having an interest.
Paying from the Wrong Pocket
Money may always seem like money to you, but within a trust, it belongs to 
either principal or income. And, although making a distinction between the 
two may seem silly when paying trust bills, you really must. Because dif-
ferent people may be entitled to receive money and property from either 
income or principal, making payments (whether expenses or distributions) 
from the correct side of the account is crucial. More than one trustee has 
been sued because they paid all trustee fees from principal (or income), for 
example. Remember, when you make all payments from one side, you favor 
the eventual owners of the property from the other side (because their share 
will grow faster). To avoid any hint of favoritism, allocate fees and expenses 
against the type of income that generated that cost. When you’re not sure 
(like with your trustee’s fee), create an equitable formula so that a certain 
portion of your fee is always paid from principal, and the rest from income.

Tax Returns You May Have to Prepare
You may have to prepare a seemingly endless array of tax returns when you’re administering an estate or 
trust. Check with your accountant or attorney if you have any questions. Here are some of the most popular.
Federal Tax Form 
Number and Name
When It’s Required
When It’s Due
Form 1040 U.S. 
Individual Income 
Tax Return
When the decedent had income prior to 
death that hasn’t been reported.
April 15 following the year of death; auto-matic 
6-month extension of time to file provided Form 
4868 is filed on or before April 15. Form 4868 
doesn’t need to be filed if no tax is due; the exten-
sion is automatic.
Form 1041 U.S. 
Income Tax 
Return for Estates 
and Trusts
When the estate or trust receives income 
earned.
31/2 months after the year-end of the estate or 
trust; most trusts are required to use a December 
31 year end, but estates may elect a fiscal year, 
provided the first fiscal year ends no later than 11 
full months after the date of death.
Form 706 United 
States Estate 
(and Generation-
Skipping Transfer) 
Tax Return
For estates with assets more than a certain 
amount. Even though not every estate with 
assets over that amount will have an estate 
tax, those estates are still required to file.

extended by 6 additional months for cause.
Form 709 United 
States Gift (and 
Generation 
Skipping Transfer) 
Tax Return
Generally, if the decedent gave gifts to some-
one (other than his or her spouse) totaling 
more than $12,000 in a calendar year, or if the 
decedent was splitting gifts with a surviving 
spouse who made the gifts, and the gifts 
haven’t yet been reported.
April 15 of the year following the year the gift was 
made.
Form 1310 
Statement of 
Person Claiming 
Refund Due a 
Deceased Person
If a tax refund is due a decedent on his or her 
Form 1040 (whether final or any prior year), 
but he or she has no surviving spouse or 
court-appointed representative, the person 
requesting the refund must complete and file 
Form 1310.
File together with the related tax return. If claiming 
a refund for a prior year for which a tax return has 
already been filed, send as soon as possible to 
the IRS Service Center where the original return 
was filed.
Form SS-4 
Application for 
Employer Identifi-
cation Number
For any trust or estate that will maintain bank 
or brokerage accounts, or to whom anyone 
who makes a payment may be required to 
issue either a Form 1099 or a Form W-2.
Immediate prior to opening any accounts for 
estate or trust. You can apply online at 
www.irs.gov.
Form 1099-MISC

neys, or of $600 or more to accountants, 
trustees, or any non-corporate entity to 
whom the estate or trust paid compensation.
Send copy to recipient no later than January 31 
of the year following the tax year involved. Copy 
should be filed with the IRS by February 28 (if filing 
on paper, and accompanied by Form 1096), or by

What to Do When Someone Dies
If you’re an executor, personal representative, or administrator of an estate, you need to start the process 
somewhere. The following are tasks you want to take care of in the first days and weeks after the decedent’s 
death.
  Determine the decedent’s wishes regarding arrangements such as funeral and burial.
  Obtain copies of the death certificate.
  Ascertain whether the decedent had a last will and other estate planning documents and then try to find them.
  Apply for a federal Taxpayer Identification Number for the estate, using form SS-4. This is like a Social 
Security Number for the estate.
  Figure out the decedent’s domicile (where he or she “lived” for probate and tax purposes) and where 
real property (real estate) is located, because the executor may have to probate the estate in multiple 
jurisdictions.
  Determine whether you need professional advisors such as an attorney, CPA, or enrolled agent.
  If the decedent has no surviving spouse
 
● 
Change the locks on the decedent’s residence immediately.
 
● 
Locate and take possession of decedent’s checkbook and credit cards and notify banks and credit  
 
card companies.
 
● 
Notify the decedent’s homeowner’s insurance company and automobile insurance company. Add 
 
executor, when appointed, as insured and determine if coverage, particularly on items of unusual  
 
value, is adequate.
  Cancel pending contracts (such as purchase and sale agreements on real estate) and rewrite as executor.
  Marshall and safeguard decedent’s assets:
 
● 
Locate safe-deposit box and inventory its contents.
 
● 
Collect information regarding type, value, and manner of holding for all the decedent’s assets.
  Determine heirs at law (those who would inherit if the decedent was will-less) and beneficiaries (those 
who inherit in the presence of a will) of the decedent’s estate.
  Decide if probate of the decedent’s will (or administration of the decedent’s estate) is necessary and file 
the decedent’s last will with the probate court.
  If probate is necessary
 
● 
Figure out whether ancillary, or supplemental, probate is also necessary (for real property in 
 
another state).
 
● 
Decide whether temporary administration of the estate is necessary for assets that must be dealt  
 
with immediately.

Chapter 21
Ten Types of Taxes You 
May Have to Pay
In This Chapter
▶ Making sense of the transfer-tax trio
▶ Figuring out the difference between taxes on income and taxes on owned items
W
e’d love to be able to be able to tell you that negotiating your way 
through the tax implications of estates and trusts is an easy matter. 
Unfortunately, it can get pretty complicated because one event can often lead 
to multiple taxes being owed. Don’t ask us why. We don’t make the rules, but 
we’re stuck with ’em the same as you.
In this chapter, we give you the top-ten list, in no particular order, of the 
taxes you may come across in the process of administering an estate or trust. 
Chances are good you won’t be responsible for paying all of them, but the 
odds are also good that you won’t avoid paying taxes altogether.
 
With the exception of federal income taxes and federal and state estate, gift, 
and inheritance taxes, all taxes you pay on behalf of the trust or estate are 
deductible on that entity’s income tax returns. Of course, you actually have to 
have paid the taxes in order to deduct. If the check is written but still sitting in 
the envelope waiting to be mailed on the last business day of any tax year, you 
can’t use that deduction until the next year.
Federal Estate Tax
The federal estate tax is the granddaddy of the transfer-tax system. Estates 
valued in excess of $2.5 million for people who died in 2008, $3.5 million 
in 2009, and currently $1 million in 2011 and beyond must fill out Form 706, 
United States Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return and pay 
whatever tax is due. If you’re lucky enough to be administering a qualifying 
estate, you’re entitled to all the fun of preparing Form 706. Don’t worry, we 
explain how to do just that in Chapter 17.

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
 
You may have noticed that we left the year 2010 out of the preceding para-
graph. That’s because in 2010, the federal estate tax will be repealed for one 
year only. In 2011, the old, pre-2002 rules (before Congress started tinkering 
with the estate tax) will return, dropping the amount that may pass tax free 
back to $1 million. What will actually happen in 2011 and beyond has been the 
subject of much debate in Congress, but nothing is likely to change the 2011 
scenario in the near future.
State Inheritance or Estate Tax
Just as many states impose an income tax (like the federal income tax), many 
also impose estate or inheritance taxes. Most states used to calculate these 
taxes based on a credit on the federal Form 706. In other words, if the fed-
eral government was going to allow a credit for state estate or inheritance 
taxes, most states said, hey, just give us that money instead. You didn’t end 
up paying any less tax, but the total tax you paid was split between the IRS 
and the state. However, as the credit for state estate taxes paid was whittled 
away on Form 706, most states stepped up to the plate and pegged their por-
tion of the tax to what it would’ve been based on a prior year’s calculation.
For example, Vermont calculates its estate tax based on federal estate tax 
rules in effect on January 1, 2001, whereas Kansas computes its tax by using 
federal laws that went into effect in 1997. See Appendix B for a complete list of 
what each state is doing with regard to inheritance or estate tax as of the date 
of publication. Remember: You need to check with your state’s tax depart-
ment to get the rules in effect at the time of your decedent’s (deceased per-
son’s) death. And, if you’re faced with an estate that owns property in more 
than one state, you may want to consult a competent tax professional because 
the estate may owe estate or inheritances taxes in each of those states.
Estate and Trust Income Taxes 
(Federal and State)
Like individuals, partnerships, and corporations, estates and trusts have the 
ability to earn income — which means that income is subject to income tax. 
If you have more than $600 of income for an estate, $300 for a simple trust 
(all income must be distributed currently), or $100 for a complex trust (every 
other type of trust), you need to complete and file Form 1041, U.S. Income 
Tax Return for Estates and Trusts.

319
 Chapter 21: Ten Types of Taxes You May Have to Pay
 
If the trust or estate has a tax home in a state with a state income tax, guess 
what? You get to file a state income tax return there. How do you know where 
the estate or trust’s tax home is? In the case of an estate, the tax home is the 
state where the decedent was domiciled at the time of his or her death. For 
a trust, the rules are slightly more complex. Basically, if the grantor (person 
who created the trust) resided in the same state as at least one of the trustees 
when he or she either set up the trust or died, the trust is deemed a resident 
of that state. If there’s no match between the grantor’s and the trustee’s domi-
ciles, then the trust is considered without a situs, or location, and no state 
income tax return is required.
State Intangibles Taxes
Some states have intangibles taxes rather than income taxes. Intangibles are 
those items of property that you can’t readily hold in your hand, such as 
stocks and bonds. With an intangibles tax, the market value of these items 
is tallied up once each year. Then the tax is calculated using a percentage of 
the market value. We tell you which states have intangibles taxes, and which 
don’t, in Appendix B.
Real Estate Taxes
If the trust or estate you’re administering owns real estate, you must pay the 
real estate taxes every year, either by paying the city or town directly or by 
making sure that you’re paying into an escrow account maintained by the 
bank that holds the mortgage on the property, if any. Real estate taxes, also 
called property taxes, are calculated based on a property’s assessed value. 
This value is subject to reassessment at various times, including whenever 
the property changes hands or when the city or town in which the property 
is located decides to update all of its property assessments.
 
Don’t accept your new assessment if you feel it’s unjust. You’re entitled to 
question it. If the new assessed value seems unfair, submit your grievance, 
in writing and within a very short period after you’re notified of the change, 
to either the city assessor or town clerk. (Who you send your grievance to 
depends on the rules of your city or town, which should be clearly spelled out 
and sent with the new assessment.) One of us recently underwent a citywide 
reassessment that was, at a later date, completely thrown out as unusable 
because the valuations for similar properties varied so widely and the asses-
sor couldn’t provide adequate documentation for her valuations. But the over-
all assessment was only questioned after the flood of grievances was received 
at city hall. In this case, it was possible to fight city hall and win.

Part V: The Part of Tens 
Excise Taxes (Personal Property)
Planes, boats, automobiles, and any other objects that move are often 
assessed an annual excise tax. If the trust or estate you’re administering owns 
property subject to excise taxes, you need to be certain they’re paid. Unpaid 
excise tax bills may lead to tickets and, in extreme cases, seizure by the 
taxing authority. Trust us, leaving your office for lunch to find a boot nailed 
to the axel of the estate’s car is pretty awful.
 
Excise taxes, although owed to the state, are usually paid to the city or town 
where the property is garaged.
Local Income Taxes
In the grand scheme of things, few cities, towns, or counties impose an 
income tax, but enough do so as to affect lots of people. If your estate or 
trust is resident in one of these locales, you must calculate not only the state 
income tax but also the local one. Fortunately, these local calculations are 
usually done right on the state income tax return (we know you’re delighted 
you probably don’t have to fill out yet another tax return), and they piggy-
back right onto the state calculation. Consequently, figuring out how much 
you owe isn’t tough, provided you’ve already successfully tackled the state 
income tax calculation.
Decedent’s Final State and 
Federal Income Taxes
Just because someone has died doesn’t mean he or she gets out of filing 
income tax returns for the year of his or her death. Well, the decedent 
doesn’t have to, but you do. So, in addition to preparing the returns for the 
estate and/or trust, you also have to prepare Form 1040, U.S. Individual 
Income Tax Return for the decedent. When preparing the form, make sure 
you write “Deceased” and the date of death next to the decedent’s name. You 
may also want to write “Deceased” and the date of death across the top of 
the return in bold letters or red pen. No one ever accused the IRS of reading 
everything that’s sent to it — sometimes you need to surround important 
information in neon lights to make sure you’re getting your point across.
 
Surviving spouses need not file a separate return in the year their husbands 
or wives died. Instead, a surviving spouse may file one last joint return. Both 
personal exemptions are available, as is the full joint standard deduction, and 

321
 Chapter 21: Ten Types of Taxes You May Have to Pay
the slightly lower married filing joint tax rates, even if the deceased spouse 
died early in the year. Check out Chapter 18 for more information on filing the 
decedent’s final Form 1040.
Gift Tax
Large transfers made during lifetime (what a way to say “a gift”) may be sub-
ject to the gift tax, one of the group of transfer taxes that also features the 
estate tax and the generation-skipping transfer tax. If transfers are made into 
a trust during the grantor’s lifetime, those transfers may be subject to the 
gift tax. Chapter 11 tells you what you need to know about the gift tax and 
filing Form 709, United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax 
Return.
Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax
The last, and least understood, of the transfer-tax trio, the generation-skipping 
transfer tax (GST) is assessed when property moves from one generation to 
another, skipping intermediate generations along the way. So property that 
goes from a grandparent (or grandparent’s estate) to a grandchild (or in trust 
for the benefit of a grandchild) is subject to this tax, provided that the grand-
child’s parent is still alive at the time the transfer is made. Property trans-
ferred between unrelated people who are more than 371/2 years apart in age is 
also subject to this tax.
 
Unlike the estate tax, which is only assessed after the decedent’s death, and 
the gift tax, which only comes into play while the donor is still alive, the gen-
eration-skipping transfer tax may be assessed either during the donor’s life-
time or after his or her death. This tax is assessed in addition to, not instead 
of, the estate or gift tax; it generally equals the amount of transfer tax that 
would’ve been generated had the property made all the generational steps, 
not just the skipping ones.
Depending on whether this tax is being assessed for a gift made during the 
donor’s lifetime or for a bequest or devise made after death, the GST is calculated 
either on Form 709, U.S. Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return or 
Form 706, U.S. Estate (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return.
If you suspect that you may be in the middle of a situation that involves a 
skip generation, look at Chapter 3 to find out what you need to know.

State-by-State Summary 
of Probate, Estate, or Inheritance 
Tax, and Rules of Intestacy
T
he laws of Intestacy (how a decedent’s estate is distributed when no valid last will 
exists) as well as the wording in state statues vary by state. We summarize a por-
tion of these laws to give you a taste of the similarities and differences between states. 
However, because these laws can be quite complex, consult with a competent attor-
ney who’s an expert in estate law before you make any intestate distributions. Keep in 
mind that although these are the laws in effect as this book is published, they’re sub-
ject to change. To look farther down the line of descent and distribution than what we 
provide here, refer to your individual state statute regarding Intestacy.
