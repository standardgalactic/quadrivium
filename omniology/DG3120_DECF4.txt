Edwin Barnhart, Ph.D.
Director 
Maya Exploration Center
P
rofessor Edwin Barnhart is Director of the 
Maya Exploration Center. He received his 
Ph.D. in Anthropology with a focus on 
Archaeology from The University of Texas at 
Austin in 2001; his dissertation was entitled The 
Palenque Mapping Project: Settlement Patterns 
and Urbanism in an Ancient Maya City. Professor Barnhart has more than 
20 years of experience as an archaeologist, explorer, and instructor in North, 
Central, and South America and has published more than a dozen papers and 
given presentations at eight international conferences. 
Professor Barnhart’s involvement in Maya studies began in 1990 as an 
archaeological intern in the ruins of Copán, Honduras. In January of 1996, 
he was invited to return to Copán and help a team from the University of 
Pennsylvania excavate the early acropolis and the tomb of the city’s lineage 
founder. From 1992 to 1995, Professor Barnhart studied New World art, 
iconography, and epigraphy (hieroglyphic translation) under the late Dr. 
Linda Schele at The University of Texas at Austin. During that time, he 
intensively studied the Andean culture, writing a number of papers about 
Moche shamanism as seen through art and iconography.
In 1994, Professor Barnhart began working as a surveyor and University 
of Texas field school instructor in the jungles of northwestern Belize. After 
finding numerous small villages, he discovered the ancient city of Maax 
Na (“Spider-Monkey House”), a major center of the Classic Maya period. 
Professor Barnhart mapped more than 600 structures at Maax Na between 
1995 and 1997 before moving his research focus to Chiapas, Mexico. He 
received his master’s degree in Latin American Studies in May of 1996 and 
began teaching anthropology classes at what is now Texas State University 
the following September. He taught archaeology and anthropology classes 
there until 1998, when he was invited by the Mexican government to direct 
i

iiii
the Palenque Mapping Project, a three-year effort to survey and map the 
unknown sections of Palenque’s ruins. More than 1,100 new structures were 
documented, bringing the site total to almost 1,500. The resultant map has 
been celebrated as one of the most detailed and accurate ever made of a 
Maya ruin. 
In 2003, Professor Barnhart became Director of the Maya Exploration 
Center, an institution dedicated to the study of ancient Maya civilization. He 
has led dozens of student groups on journeys through Mexico, Guatemala, 
Peru, and Bolivia.
Over the last 10 years, Professor Barnhart has appeared multiple times on 
the History Channel; the Discovery Channel; and NHK, a Japanese public 
television network. In addition, he is a Fellow of the Explorers Club and 
teaches University of Texas travel courses for college professors on ancient 
Andean and Mesoamerican astronomy, mathematics, and culture. ■

Lost Worlds of South America
Scope:
D
id you know that before the first pyramid in Egypt was constructed, 
thousands of people were already living in stone-built cities in Peru? 
If not, you’re not alone. Very few people realize not only how old 
but how sophisticated civilization was in ancient South America. This course 
will introduce you to thousands of years of South American history, much of 
which has come to light only recently.
The title of this course, Lost Worlds, might sound a bit melodramatic, but 
in the case of South America’s history, it’s fitting. Cities going back past 
3000 B.C. are still lost under the deep sands of the desert coast. Magnificent 
palaces, such as that at Machu Picchu, are hiding on the peaks and in the 
valleys of the cloud-covered Andes Mountains. The evidence of an ancient 
population of millions is being recovered but remains mostly lost under 
dense rainforest canopy. Much of South America truly is a lost world. In 
addition to the many aspects of history still to be found through archaeology, 
the world’s museum collections also represent the way in which South 
America’s history has been lost. Most of the vast exhibits of gold, silver, 
and other precious objects from South America come from looting and grave 
robbing. The original locations of those thousands of artifacts have been lost 
and, with them, important clues about their meanings and functions.
This course will lead you, more or less chronologically, through the many 
cultures that rose and fell during South America’s long pre-Columbian 
history. The pace of archaeological discoveries in what is generally called 
the “Andean region” has greatly accelerated in recent decades, in some 
cases, radically changing what is still being printed in textbooks. This course 
will discuss those new discoveries, bringing viewers up-to-date in a way that 
few other information sources can. One of the aspects of Andean history that 
has changed the most in recent times is our understanding of just how far it 
goes back in time. Peru’s coast is now known to be home to the oldest cities 
in the Americas and among the oldest in the world. South America is also 
the place in which the famous Monte Verde site represents the oldest known

human habitation in the Americas, baffling archaeologists who believe that 
the first Americans crossed the Bering Strait.
As you’ll learn, South America is home to many firsts. The earliest pottery in 
the Americas comes, surprisingly, from the Amazon. The New World’s first 
metallurgy, weaving, cultivated plants, and even astronomical observatories 
also come from South America. And guess where the world’s first mummies 
are found? Despite what you may think, the answer is not Egypt. 
South America was home to a wonderful patchwork of cultures, and in many 
respects, it remains so. Starting as communities of fishermen along the northern 
coast of Peru, cities, civilizations, and powerful kingdoms spread across the 
Andes. Sometimes, they clashed with one another and, other times, fell victim 
to massive natural disasters. Ultimately, they developed into a single empire of 
more than 10 million people—the Inca. Then, less than 100 years after the Inca 
Empire was established, Pizarro arrived with a few hundred soldiers and 12 
infectious diseases to change South America forever.
This course will discuss not only the various culture groups of South America 
but also the idea that underlying elements bind them all into a cultural 
continuum. The ancient people of South America—from the Chavín people 
of 1000 B.C. to the Chimú people of 1000 A.D.—shared a fundamental 
vision of the cosmos. Social organization patterns, subsistence strategies, 
construction techniques, and especially religion were things that all seem 
to have held in common. This course aims to explore both the amazing 
archaeological discoveries in South America and, more importantly, what 
those discoveries tell us about the lives of the world’s ancestors from a still 
poorly understood part of our planet—South America. ■

South America’s Lost Cradle of Civilization
Lecture 1
T
he ancient history of South America is both fascinating and deeply 
informative, but it has been sadly underrepresented in mainstream 
accounts of Western history. Few people know the significant 
scientific, agricultural, and social advancements achieved by ancient South 
American cultures, and many are unaware of the wide variety of civilizations 
that flourished across South America’s diverse terrain. In this course, we 
will consider why, despite their importance, these cultures have largely 
gone unnoticed. Through our examination of their technology, religion, and 
practices, we will discover not only what is known about them but also what 
remains unknown.
South America’s Undervalued Legacy
• 
Much of South America’s impressive history has gone unnoticed. 
Did you know that pyramids were being built in Peru hundreds of 
years before they were built in Egypt? That while Europe was still 
reeling from the effects of the Black Death, South America was 
enjoying a golden age and had eradicated hunger in their world? 
That South America developed a language written in knots—a 
language that remains one of the world’s last undeciphered scripts? 
These lectures will explore these and many other fascinating aspects 
of South America’s underappreciated legacy.
• 
South America deserves recognition as one of the cradles of 
civilization. There are only six places on earth where civilization 
spontaneously occurred, and South America is one of them. 
It is part of an elite group that includes China, the Indus Valley, 
Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Mesoamerica. 
• 
Why do we refer to ancient South America as a “lost world”? 
South America’s terrain has a unique way of hiding its ancient past. 
There are steep mountains, many of them more than 20,000 feet 
high. There are deserts; the entire coast of Peru and northern Chile 

4
Lecture 1: South America’s Lost Cradle of Civilization
is covered by one of the driest deserts in the world. There is also 
dense jungle; in fact, unknown cultures are still living in uncharted 
regions of the Amazon.
• 
Any South American archaeologist will tell you that we’ve barely 
scratched the surface of what’s been lost in South America.
• 
The evidence of early civilization in South America centers around 
the Andes Mountains. For that reason, scholars call the collective 
cultures there the Andean civilization. Peru is the epicenter of the 
Andean civilization, spreading into modern Bolivia, Chile, and 
Ecuador. But entirely different borders existed when the Incas ran 
the show. They called the Andean civilization Tawantinsuyu, “the 
land of four quarters.” 
• 
Why should we care about ancient South America? If we as a 
people don’t know where we came from, how do we know who we 
are, what mistakes to avoid, and where we should be headed? It is 
important in today’s world to consider our global heritage, and the 
More than 100 uncontacted tribes are known to exist in the Amazonian jungle.

ways in which South American history differs from other cultural 
history can provide us with invaluable self-knowledge.
Our Approach in These Lectures
• 
Most people believe that South American history was dominated by 
the Inca. The reality is that the Inca represent only the last 200 years 
of a 5,000-year history. This course will indeed teach you about the 
Inca but not before helping you to understand that they stood upon 
the shoulders of giants. The cultures that came before the Inca are 
a rich patchwork of people, ideas, and environmental adaptations. 
• 
We’ll talk about the birth of Andean civilization in the northern 
deserts of Peru. The Andean civilization produced incredible 
independent inventions—fundamental advancements in agriculture, 
architecture, textiles, and religion. This civilization gave the world 
the miracle of the potato, and advances in food production and 
preservation all but eliminated hunger in South America. 
• 
We’ll also talk about the fact that wide-scale civilization is now 
being found in the Amazon, an area once thought to be untamable 
by ancient man. It is increasingly apparent that this previously 
unknown Amazonian settlement was both complex and expansive. 
• 
South America’s many cultures are often discussed as separate, 
isolated groups. But as we look at the archaeology and follow 
the clues that it provides, we will discover overarching 
similarities. Though distinct, these cultures all shared fundamental 
characteristics, such as religion, ideas about community 
organization, and subsistence strategies. 
• 
Some scholars interpret the evidence of religion in ancient South 
American cultures as pointing to a polytheistic tradition. These 
lectures will present a counterargument: that South America was 
actually one of the few places on the planet where monotheism 
was practiced and that the origins of South American religion came 
from a surprising place: the Amazon. In fact, the very origins of 

6
Lecture 1: South America’s Lost Cradle of Civilization
Andean civilization can perhaps be traced not to the Andes but to 
somewhere deep inside the Amazon.
Sources of Knowledge
• 
Our knowledge of ancient South America generally comes from 
three sources: Spanish contact chronicles and reports, archaeology, 
and modern ethnography.
• 
Spanish contact reports were numerous but were often written to 
serve the authors’ agendas. Some of them were written by soldiers; 
these chronicles focused on the quest for gold and land. Other 
accounts were written by priests seeking to acquire converts and 
end paganism. Reports were also written by officials sent from the 
Crown of Spain. To serve the purposes of the Crown, these officials 
wrote about resources and labor groups. 
• 
As a result of these separate agendas, there were many questions 
that were never asked, and many of the chronicles conflict with one 
another. Amazingly, no Spaniard ever really saw the Inca build their 
incredible walls. No one ever asked them how they wrote in those 
knotted strings. No one ever asked what they knew about the stars 
and their methods for observing them. 
• 
Archaeology in South America began in response to the huge 
amount of gold and other beautiful artifacts being looted from South 
America, specifically from the coasts of Peru. It was an attempt to 
find these artifacts before they were all gone. Today, South American 
archaeology has evolved. Now, it’s a fast growing source of 
information and protection for these beautiful ancient sites. 
• 
Modern ethnography is also a good potential source for 
understanding the past. Modern descendants have important 
information to contribute—ideas about how their lives today might 
relate to the lives of their ancestors.

7
Highlights to Come
• 
The momentum of South American archaeology has been such over 
the last decades that the literature can’t keep up. Much of what is in 
standard textbooks is no longer true. New excavations have produced 
information that has overturned much of what we use to believe about 
South America. To explore these new discoveries, we will examine 
many of the regions and cultures of ancient South America. 
• 
We will talk about Peru’s coast, where culture rose and fell like 
a fireworks show. Though the desert coast of Peru looks like a 
barren wasteland from satellite images, it’s actually riddled with 
fertile river valleys. The cultures of the coast capitalized on those 
river valleys, seeking out a resource base through a combination 
of irrigation canals and marine farming. They made incredible 
leaps in technology, carved giant geoglyphs into the sand, and built 
pyramids that towered over the desert floor.
• 
We’ll discuss the highlands of the Andes, where the Inca originated. 
The advancements of the Inca were adaptations of techniques from 
people who had lived and learned in the same environment and had 
perfected ways of living in it for thousands of years before the Inca 
came into existence.
• 
We’ll also discuss the Amazon, where almost unbelievable things 
are being discovered. Once thought to be unfarmable, the Amazon 
has recently revealed evidence of wide-scale civilization. Deep, 
deep within Brazil’s forest, hunter and gatherer groups are being 
found that date back to 9000 B.C. It would seem that the myths of 
El Dorado and the lost city of Z might be true after all.

Discovering Peru’s Earliest Cities
Lecture 2
I
n this lecture, we look at the earliest cultures in South America—those 
along the coast and in the inland valleys. Archaeological evidence 
shows civilization developing there almost 5,000 years ago, making 
South America one of the “cradles of civilization.” A strong trade network 
developed among these cities, especially between the coastal cities with 
access to seafood and the inland cities that had developed irrigation-based 
agriculture. The absence of weapons and fortifications indicates that the 
network was peaceful and cooperative. Some evidence has been found 
suggesting the early development of religion and astronomy in these 
cultures, and some compelling artifacts even point to possible contact with 
the Amazon, but many questions remain unanswered.
South America as a Cradle of Civilization
• 
A little more than 5,000 years ago, cities built in stone began to 
appear in the coastal deserts and valleys of northern Peru. It would 
still be almost 500 years before Imhotep built the first step pyramid 
in Egypt. This settlement in Peru can rightly be considered a cradle 
of civilization.
• 
Though archaeological digs at Aspero in the early 20th century were 
abandoned because no gold or ceramics were found, archaeologist 
Michael Mosley returned there in the 1970s with the suspicion 
that the settlement might be older than previously thought. Mosley 
found weaved nets, baskets, and fishing equipment but no ceramics 
or crops. 
o	 Prior to the 1950s and the invention of carbon-14 dating, 
many of the preceramic cities were noted with textiles, basic 
agriculture, and large populations, but no one could determine 
just how old they were. 
o	 With the advent of carbon-14 dating, organic materials 
found at sites can be dated, although the process is neither as 

10
Lecture 2: Discovering Peru’s Earliest Cities
straightforward nor as accurate as you might think. The process 
relies on the known rate of decay of the isotope carbon 14 after 
the death of a living organism. 
o	 Carbon-14 dates are accurate to +/– 50 years. A site that has a 
very strong date will have hundreds of carbon-14 dates.
• 
Carbon-14 dating confirmed that Aspero dated to at least 2800 
B.C. This allowed Mosley to challenge the longstanding theory 
that urban communities could not develop without the advent of 
intensive agriculture. Aspero was a community that appeared to 
achieve a stable food supply and become a sedentary community 
because of fishing, not planting. Mosley called it the “maritime 
foundation” of Andean civilization.
• 
Mosley’s theory enjoyed wide acclaim for a while, until other 
contemporary cities in the valleys just off the coast were discovered, 
along with something that Aspero didn’t have: irrigation canals. 
Unlike the bone-dry desert along the coast, the four valleys of Norte 
Chico had rivers fed by Andean snowmelt from above. Those water 
sources made the valleys fertile and allowed the people to farm. 
Thus, it appears that Aspero and other coastal cities did have an 
agricultural culture—through trade.
Establishment of Trade
• 
One of the crops planted in abundance in the inland valleys was 
cotton. Cotton was essential for all the nets used on the coast, and 
inland people likely traded it for seafood with the people living on 
the coast. The coastal people used the cotton to develop a textile 
industry from scratch, with no apparent previous example.
• 
Coastal cities and inland valley cities created a trade network, each 
providing items desired by the other, such as food or nets. As time 
moved forward on the coast, in the Norte Chico region specifically, 
that pattern spread to other places, and the cities that were present 
grew in size. 

11
• 
Many sites from the final preceramic period between 3200 B.C. and 
1800 B.C. show similarities in architecture and social practices but 
important differences in diet. The highland sites of Kotosh and La 
Galgada mainly relied on hunting, but there is also evidence of food 
products from the Amazon 
and the coast, suggesting 
that the residents of these 
highland sites were traders. 
o	 At Kotosh, probably as 
many as 3,000 people 
lived around a center 
dominated by two large, 
terraced platforms. The 
Temple of the Crossed 
Hands 
at 
Kotosh 
may 
show 
the 
first 
evidence of religious 
iconography.
o	 Despite the large central 
architecture at Kotosh, 
there 
are 
no 
elite 
burials found and no 
defensive architecture.
• 
Very early sites along the 
coast continued to grow 
until their populations reached about 5,000 people per city. Mass 
production of maritime goods is evident, further suggesting the 
existence of trade networks.
o	 At Aspero, two large structures, one called the Huaca de los 
Sacrificios and the other one called the Huaca de los Idolos, 
both date to somewhere around 2800 B.C. (A huaca is basically 
an ancestral shrine.) These are major pyramid-like structures, 
topped by rooms and complexes of buildings. The Huaca de 
los Idolos stood about 10 meters tall and was made of stone, 
The fact that there seems to have 
been very little llama or alpaca in the 
diets of highland people suggests 
that these animals may have been 
domesticated in the preceramic 
period.

Lecture 2: Discovering Peru’s Earliest Cities
mortar, and smoothed-clay exteriors. There was no habitation 
evidence inside, and there were no elite burials found. 
o	 El Paraíso is a later preceramic site along the coast. It started 
about 2000 B.C. and was the largest of all the coastal cities, 
covering an area of 58 hectares. Here, two massive buildings 
faced each other across a wide plaza. The orientation of these 
buildings suggests that the inhabitants of the city may have had 
some knowledge of astronomy.
• 
Eventually, a shift away from the coast and into the inland valleys 
occurred. It seems that as the preceramic period came to an end, 
there was an increased reliance on crops. More people moved 
away from that coast and into the inland cities. As the populations 
dropped on the coast, they increased in the valleys. 
Development of the Inland Culture
• 
Of all the inland cities, Caral was the largest. In 2004, archaeologist 
Ruth Shady Solis announced that Caral could be reliably dated 
to 3200 B.C., making it the oldest city in the Americas—not just 
South America but the entire Americas. 
• 
There is no evidence of warfare or aggression in the inland culture. 
There are no fortifications. This suggests that the cities had 
developed a peaceful, cooperative relationship with one another. 
They were not competing for resources but, rather, sharing them.
• 
There is also no early evidence of art or religion in any of these 
cities. There is nothing to give us information about cosmology 
or what people thought about the sky, though there is one bit of 
evidence that perhaps they thought about astronomy. In general, 
however, we have very little understanding of what, if any, religion 
the people of the preceramic era practiced.
• 
A number of telling artifacts in Caral suggest that things were 
changing by the end of the preceramic period, right before 1800 
B.C. For example, there is a cache of flutes carved with little faces. 

13
These personified flutes were obviously used for some sort of 
music, perhaps in a ritual setting.
• 
A depiction of a monkey has also been found. This is interesting 
because these cultures were on the northern coast, where there were 
no monkeys. The closest monkey was a 12-day walk away in the 
Amazon. This suggests that the inland people were in contact not 
only with the coastal cultures but with the Amazon, as well.
• 
Most amazingly, archaeologists have found what appears to be a 
khipu in Caral, sealed and buried under a step. A khipu is a textile 
recording device that we know mostly from the Inca, but here it is 
at 3000 B.C. at the site of Caral. We will discuss the khipu more in 
later lectures, but if this artifact is indeed a khipu, it makes Peru one 
of the earliest places where a writing system was created. 
Evidence of Astronomy
• 
Located 25 miles inland in the Chillón Valley, Buena Vista is a site 
that was established late in the preceramic period. It was focused 
on farming and was one of the sites that shows evidence for the 
formation of a trade network. In 2006, a new discovery was made 
there that made Buena Vista important for another reason.
• 
Buena Vista had two temples that could function as astronomical 
observatories. One, oriented toward the winter solstice, was called 
the Temple of the Menacing Disk; the other, oriented toward the 
summer solstice, was called the Temple of the Fox.
• 
During the excavation of the Temple of the Menacing Disk, 
archaeologist Robert Benfer noted that the sculpture known as the 
Menacing Disk was oddly oriented and appeared to face a location 
outside of the temple and across the valley. 
o	 At this location on a far ridge, a platform was discovered. The 
alignment between the point on the disk and the platform on 
the ridge is exactly the point where the sun sets during the  
June solstice. 

14
Lecture 2: Discovering Peru’s Earliest Cities
o	 That means that on the shortest day of the year (winter solstice 
in the Southern Hemisphere), a person standing on the disk 
could see sunset over the platform on the far ridge. Similar 
alignments at the Temple of the Fox appear to be oriented for 
the summer solstice. 
o	 Offerings at the Temple of the Fox date to 2200 B.C., making 
Buena Vista the oldest observatory not just in South America 
but in the entire Americas.
• 
There are two possible explanations for these findings. One is that 
the people in Buena Vista were agriculturalists and had a newfound 
need to know the change of the seasons for planting and harvesting. 
The other idea is that these temples represent the first signs of 
developing religion. We know that later cultures in the Andes 
worshiped the sun, so perhaps these temples show a religious 
reverence for the sun.
New Theories about the Amazon
• 
The appearance of foodstuffs and images that seem to be Amazonian 
in nature in northern highland settlements, such as Kotosh and 
Caral, begs the question: Who were these cultures trading with? 
The short answer is: We really don’t know.
• 
Unfortunately, evidence regarding this trade is exceedingly hard to 
find, and archaeologists often do not agree about the meaning of 
what little evidence has been found.
• 
Recent and exciting discoveries in the Amazon suggest that there 
was a much larger population there than we originally believed, and 
that habitation began much earlier than previously known. 
• 
Another still-developing theory about the Amazon is that farming 
was taking place much earlier than previously thought, especially 
along the eastern edge of the Andes closest to the coastal cities.

15
• 
Archaeologists in the Amazon have been using soil samples and 
wide views of altered landscapes to try to understand its ancient 
history. What they have found are huge areas of black, human-
enriched soils and habitation mounds built up over the jungle floor. 
Who were the early north coast cities trading with? Archaeology is 
trying to figure out that right now.

his lecture explores the earliest evidence of human habitation in 
South America. The sites at Monte Verde and elsewhere indicate that 
humans settled in the region at least 14,900 years ago and perhaps 
even as early as 33,000 B.P. Artifacts collected at these sites portray a human 
community that had adapted efficiently to its surroundings and had become 
advanced enough to form small, semipermanent settlements. Cave art from 
the region shows evidence of the early domestication of animals, and sites 
along the coast indicate the first known practice of mummification in the 
world. Material collected from Huaca Prieta, a later settlement, even points 
to a trade network throughout the Andes and into the Amazon.
Earliest Human Habitation
• 
Before the first cities on Peru’s coast, we have evidence of human 
occupation history stretching back almost 10,000 years earlier, 
though much of it remains mysterious and controversial.
• 
To the amazement of most archaeologists, the oldest evidence 
of humans in the Americas came not from North America but  
from Chile. 
o	 In 1975, a traveler found a bone from a mastodon eroding out 
of a creek bed at a site now called Monte Verde. 
o	 Two years later, archaeologist Tom Dillehay investigated the 
site and found human habitation evidence connected to the 
mastodon. There were tools, fire pits, and even simple houses. 
The occupation went on for hundreds of years and began as far 
back as 14,900 B.P (before present).
• 
Before Monte Verde was discovered, human migration into the 
Americas was thought to have been by a land bridge formed across 
the Bering Strait during the last interglacial period. The theory 
contended that humans walked to the south as ice began to melt 

17
around 13,000 B.P. Now, an earlier coastal migration by canoe 
seems more plausible.
• 
There are many sites all around the Americas that are said to be 
of great age, although most of them are highly contested. Monte 
Verde, however, is almost unanimously accepted. 
o	 There is growing information that there may be sites other than 
Monte Verde that are older than our traditional understanding. 
These sites are called pre-Clovis because according to the first 
migration theory, humans came only after the ice receded at 
11,500 B.P., and the earliest evidence of these humans was 
from a mastodon kill site found near Clovis, New Mexico.
o	 However, more and more claims of sites earlier than Clovis 
were then made. Most were dismissed or debated, but Monte 
Verde’s acceptance has forced a reexamination of those sites. 
With recent advances in genetic studies, we now have a new 
set of data to consider, as well.
o	 According to recent DNA studies, by at least 30,000 B.P., 
people entered Beringia and stayed there isolated for more than 
15,000 years.
Human evidence associated with Mylodon skins has been found at the Cave of 
the Mylodons in Chile.

Lecture 3: South America’s First People
o	 Year by year, the list of pre-Clovis sites grows. The ones that 
date to around 15,000 B.P. are now more readily accepted, 
but the earlier ones, ranging from 20,000 to 60,000 B.P. are 
still contested and sometimes dismissed by archaeologists  
as impossible. 
The Monte Verde Site
• 
Monte Verde was not just a campsite but a semi-sedentary village 
of 20 to 30 people. There were 12 huts made of wooden posts and 
mastodon hides, two big hearths, and dozens of small hearths. The 
site is 36 miles from the ocean, which means that its inhabitants 
were not primarily fishermen.
• 
Each tent at Monte Verde was about 20 feet long and had a clay-
lined cooking pit inside; these were not, then, new or temporary 
constructions. Rather, they were large, permanent, and planned. DNA 
testing of the items that were cooked there confirmed the presence of 
mastodon meat, as well as 45 different species of edible plants.
• 
The fact that the inhabitants of Monte Verde knew how to eat 45 
different plants indicates that they were highly adapted. They knew 
their environment and had been there for a long time by the date of 
the settlement 15,000 years ago.
• 
The fact that we have found no other settlements that date to the 
same age as Monte Verde is troublesome because no pattern can be 
established to lend credence to the dates.
• 
Monte Verde remains mysterious and controversial. The widely 
accepted part of the site is called layer 2, and it dates to 14,900 
B.P. Monte Verde 1, underneath it, has human habitation evidence, 
too, also uncovered by Dillehay, with dates closer to 33,000 B.P., 
although Dillehay himself hesitates to believe those dates.
• 
Though none of it dates to as early as Monte Verde, evidence of early 
habitation in South America has been uncovered from one end of the 
Andes to the other. In Venezuela, there is a site called Taima-taima, 

19
dating from 13,000 B.P. On the other end of the Andes, in Chile, there 
is a cave called Cueva del Milodón that dates to about 5000 B.C. This 
is a long range, both chronologically and geographically.
South American Cave Art
• 
As humans spread out north and south on both sides of the Andes, a 
typical form of cave art emerged called quilcas. 
• 
Quilcas are red, white, and black wall paintings, usually depicting 
hunting scenes—humans with spears hunting camelids, such as 
llamas, alpacas, and guanacos. These paintings have been dated to 
as early as 12,000 B.P. and have even been found in the Amazon.
• 
About 6,000 years ago, there appears to have been a shift in the 
themes of the cave art from hunting themes to fertility scenes. We 
suddenly see pregnant camelids and unarmed people associated 
with them. It is plausible to say from this cave art that 6000 
B.P. marks the beginning of the domestication of llamas and the 
beginning of animal husbandry in South America.
The World’s Oldest Mummies
• 
Among the most amazing finds in archaic South America are the 
Chinchorro mummies. More than 1,500 mummies have been found 
in the Atacama Desert, dating back to 5000 B.C. These are by far 
the world’s oldest mummies, many of them 2,000 years older than 
Egypt’s oldest mummies.
• 
Associated with these bodies were whale bones, fishing tools, llama 
wool, and atlatls, short sticks used in ancient times by hunters to 
throw a shorter spear. These finds indicate that this was a culture of 
both fishermen and hunters. 
• 
There are no signs of social hierarchy among the mummies. They 
were buried with equal goods and in equal places. Unlike many 
other mummy sites, there are no obvious indications of a chief or 
other leader buried in a more elaborate manner.

20
Lecture 3: South America’s First People
• 
Tragically, recent studies have shown that these people died 
primarily of arsenic poisoning from the water they drank.
• 
It is astonishing that, at such an early time and with no evident 
previous example, these people were able to invent such a 
sophisticated and effective method of mummification. This is the 
first time we see mummification, not just in the Americas, but in  
the world.
• 
Ancestor mummies would become the core of religion in South 
America. The Inca society was deeply preoccupied with ancestral 
mummies, and it is safe to say that this tradition actually started in 
5000 B.C. in the Atacama Desert.
The Huaca Prieta Site
• 
Huaca Prieta, on the coast in the Chicama Valley, has been known 
for some time to be old, but recent excavations have suggested it 
may be much, much older than previously thought.
• 
Huaca Prieta was first excavated in the 1940s and then again in the 
1970s. Ceramics were found on the surface dating to around 900 
B.C., but buried preceramic occupation phases were discovered 
underneath the later phases.
• 
The site at Huaca Prieta comprises pit houses and a 14-meter-tall 
mound of dark, organic layers of trash. It may have started as a 
trash pit and later become a platform mound. The mound dates to 
about 2500 B.C., but it may be older. 
• 
Artifacts discovered at the site include shell middens, cotton nets, 
and fishhooks, as well as weaved clothes, belts, and hats. There 
were also a variety of edible plants, such as gourds, chili peppers, 
and peanuts. The fact that these plants were all of Amazonian 
origin, again suggests a connection of this early coastal culture with 
the Amazon.

21
New Evidence and Changing Theories
• 
Originally, Huaca Prieta was said to date to around 2500 B.C., 
but just a few years ago, a team led by Dillehay found evidence 
of cotton, peanuts, and squash in the area dating to much earlier—
around 4000 BC. Even more surprisingly, Dillehay found evidence 
of human cultivation of crops in the nearby Zaña Valley, dating to 
as early as 7200 B.C., long before the cultivation at Caral.
• 
From the Zaña Valley, Dillehay moved to Huaca Prieta in the 
Chicama Valley. The most important find of his excavations at 
Huaca Prieta was corn, discovered both at Huaca Prieta and at an 
adjacent site called Paredones. Dillehay’s team found corncobs, 
husks, and stalks deep in excavation levels. The dates came back 
at 4775 to 4500 B.C., much older than the site was originally 
thought to be.
• 
This find challenges the notion that major staple crops did not 
come into the area until the early ceramic period. The earliest corn 
domestication evidence is from central Mexico in 6700 B.C. We see 
it about 1,000 years later in Panama as well, and now we can trace 
its southward migration further.
• 
The early chili peppers and peanuts also point to a trade network 
and perhaps migration that went over the Andes and into the 
Amazon basin.
• 
The Huaca Prieta mound may also be older than originally thought. 
Dillehay’s findings in 2012 show that mound building began there 
about 5500 B.C.—considerably earlier than the original 2500 
B.C. If Dillehay is right, he may have found the origins of the 
platform mound at Huaca Prieta. His findings, however, are still 
considered controversial. 
• 
The location of Huaca Prieta near a much later Moche site may 
mean that people from the later site retained a memory of Huaca 
Prieta and, perhaps, shared some sort of history, the fullness of 
which we may never know.

Ceramics, Textiles, and Organized States
Lecture 4
T
his lecture examines a deep shift that took place in the inland valleys 
around 1800 B.C., concurrent with the introduction of ceramics to 
the area. The marine-based area around Norte Chico that we explored 
in our previous lectures was abandoned, and its population appears to 
have migrated north and south into the more arable sections of the valleys. 
This movement may have been prompted by politics but more likely by 
a devastating El Niño season along the coast. In these new communities, 
we see evidence of two distinct building styles: u-shaped complexes and 
circular sunken plazas. Later in this period, we also find evidence of religious 
imagery and the first evidence of violence and warfare.
The Introduction of Ceramics
• 
Around 1800 B.C., ceramic production finally began in Peru, 
simultaneously along the coast and in the highlands. These 
first ceramics were simple housewares, such as shallow bowls, 
necklaces, and cooking pots.
• 
Peru was oddly late in its production of ceramics. Ceramics were 
already being made for 1,000 years just north in Ecuador and 
Colombia and probably in the places with which these regions were 
trading in the Amazon. In fact, ceramics were being made much 
deeper in the Amazon thousands of years before that. 
• 
Between 1800 and 900 B.C., the people inhabiting the valleys of 
the north coast radically changed the way they were living. Right 
at 1800 B.C., just as ceramics were introduced, Caral and all the 
cities of Norte Chico were abandoned. The population moved to 
other valleys and started life anew with some important changes.
o	 A formalized building type was developed that was shared 
among cities.

24
Lecture 4: Ceramics, Textiles, and Organized States
o	 Inland sites dominated. There are very few coastal sites from 
this time period.
o	 As these populations moved away from the coast, crops 
became the primary food source.
o	 It is during this time that we see the beginnings of religious art.
o	 We also see the first depictions of organized violence 
and warfare.
• 
Almost all the sites around Norte Chico that we’ve talked about in 
earlier lectures were abandoned around 1800 B.C., and no ceramics 
have been found there. 
The Impact of El Niño
• 
Why were those preceramic sites and coastal cities abandoned? 
Perhaps it was politics, but perhaps it’s our first evidence of the 
powerful El Niño cycle driving coastal people from their homes.
• 
El Niño is a weather cycle that brings warm water sweeping across 
the Pacific and onto the western shores of the Americas. In North 
America, it can create droughts in some regions and floods in 
others, sometimes far inland.
• 
Along the western coast of South America, the cold Humboldt 
Current comes up from Antarctica, creating dry deserts and an 
extreme abundance of maritime life. This current is one of the 
reasons that people at such sites as Aspero were able to live almost 
completely off of fish.
• 
El Niño brings warm water down from the north once every decade 
or so. But every 25 to 40 years in South America, El Niño is more 
severe and can change the water temperature by as much as 6.6°. 
This change kills all the phytoplankton, and the fish that feed on it 
must leave for colder water or die. 

25
• 
Floods can occur along the coast, as well. During an El Niño, some 
areas can get more rain in two weeks than in the previous 30 years. 
If that happened to these early cities, their irrigation canals could 
have been wiped out in a matter of days.
• 
Every few hundred years, an even worse El Niño hits the coast, 
creating unimaginable damage. We know that this happened along 
the coast of Peru in prehistory multiple times. Both the Moche and 
the Chimú cultures experienced El Niños that destroyed their cities. 
• 
Did the same thing happen to the early preceramic cities of Norte 
Chico? The evidence points to yes, but the fieldwork is still  
in progress.
Architectural Evidence of Migration
• 
As the population from the abandoned cities moved north and south 
through the valleys, they settled into inland areas of valleys, where 
the land was fertile and productive and the rivers ran at great strength. 
Here, they built new, bigger, and stronger irrigation ditches.
• 
The cities in the southern valleys began building public architecture 
in forms that are now called “u-shaped complexes.” The cities in the 
northern valleys started building sunken circular plazas. Both forms 
had identifiable precedents in the preceramic cities around Caral. In 
fact, both forms can be traced back to the Norte Chico area.
• 
There are good reasons to believe that when populations started 
in the new valleys at the same time that such cities as Caral and 
El Paraíso were abandoned in the Norte Chico area, it was indeed 
the same population that moved from one place to the other, taking 
their ideas with them. 
• 
The fact that the u-shaped and sunken plaza building types became 
standard at multiple sites indicates that some sort of state identity 
was beginning to take hold, something beyond just independent 
cities trading with one another.

26
Lecture 4: Ceramics, Textiles, and Organized States
U-Shaped Complexes
• 
In the valleys to the south, there were more than 20 cities with 
u-shaped complexes. These complexes encompass basically three 
buildings set up in a complex arrangement. The central building 
was a truncated-platform pyramid. This pyramid was the largest 
building and was flanked by long, lower platform mounts. The 
three structures together created a u shape.
• 
All these u-shaped complexes are oriented to the northeast. They 
range anywhere from 13° to 64° off east, which brings to mind 
sunrise on the June solstice. 
• 
The earliest u-shaped complex dates to about 2000 B.C. at Huaca 
La Florida in the Rimac Valley just north of Lima. It is substantially 
bigger than any of the preceramic constructions.
• 
Many examples of ceramics have been found at Huaca La Florida. 
It appears to have been a large community, but as was the case with 
preceramic cities, there are no signs of elite housing or burials. 
Sadly, the growth and success of Lima also resulted in the destruction of many 
early cities before archaeologists had a chance to study them.

27
Garagay
• 
Another ceramic-period site with a u-shaped complex is Garagay, 
located right on the limits of Lima. It was not recognized to be one 
of these early cities until 1959. 
• 
Garagay dates somewhere between 1640 and 900 B.C. It is in a 
horrible state because it was mined for decades for construction 
fill. Similar modern destruction occurred in Lima during its 
20th-century development. 
• 
Garagay was identified as an early ceramic site through a 
concentrated mapping project. Even though much of the site was 
mined as construction fill, the mapping project revealed evidence of 
a u-shaped complex.
• 
When archaeologists excavated the main pyramid at Garagay, they 
found a rare fresco on the main walls of the pyramid showing the 
face of an odd figure that looked human but had fangs as its mouth. 
This fanged creature is also found throughout Chavín, and it becomes 
very important in the development of religion in South America.
Gold at Mina Perdida
• 
Just north of Lima, in the Lurín Valley, stands an important initial 
period site called Mina Perdida, or “Lost Mine.” It is about 18 
hectares across and has a number of u-shaped buildings. The central 
pyramid of the largest u-shaped building is 23 meters tall, larger 
than any of the buildings that had been constructed up until that 
point. Its dates to between 1800 and 900 B.C.
• 
Mina Perdida has the coast’s earliest evidence of metallurgy—a 
thin, pounded-foil sheet of gold and copper. Made before smelting, 
the sheet was cold-hammered. It could have been made as early as 
1400 B.C. but no later than 1000 B.C.
• 
Since the time that Mina Perdida was found, two earlier sites of 
metallurgy have been found in South America. The first was 

28
Lecture 4: Ceramics, Textiles, and Organized States
Waywaka in the highlands, a gold-working site where a gold-
working kit dating to about 1500 B.C. was found in a grave. 
• 
In 2008, an archaic village was found near Lake Titicaca. 
Discoveries there included a gold beaded necklace associated with 
a grave that has been dated to no earlier than 1930 B.C. This is 
significantly earlier than the work found at Mina Perdida.
Cardal—A City in Transition?
• 
One more major site of note from the southern valleys is Cardal, 
not far away from Mina Perdida. Cardal was built very late in this 
period, perhaps as late as 950 B.C.
• 
The central area of Cardal is a u-shaped complex surrounding 
circular sunken plazas.
• 
The presence of both types of architecture suggests that Cardal 
represents some type of transition or combination of the two 
distinct building types in earlier cities. Perhaps the city of Chavín 
was beginning to influence this area.
The Casma Valley
• 
Shifting our view to the north, we see a population explosion in the 
Casma Valley, just one valley north of the Norte Chico area that had 
been abandoned.
• 
Massive pyramids were built in the Casma Valley, as well as 
circular sunken plazas. The sunken plazas clearly come from the 
Supe Valley. We have a total of 36 examples of similar plazas in the 
Supe Valley alone; thus, it is certain that this form had precedents in 
the preceramic Norte Chico area.
• 
Three major sites in the Casma Valley represent the northern 
building style: Moxeke, Cerro Sechin, and Sechin Alto. These sites 
are oriented on cardinal directions rather than to the northeast, 
representing an essential difference between these cities and those 
in the south.

29
• 
The loom first comes into play here also around 1000 B.C., most 
likely a backstrap loom. Baskets and nets had been made in the 
preceramic times but always by hand, so the invention of the loom 
brings with it the first Andean weave textiles.
• 
The people of Sechin Alto built the largest, tallest structure South 
America had ever seen. It was a platform mound like many others, 
but this one stood 44 meters tall, and at its base, it spanned 250 
meters to 300 meters. It dates to 1720 B.C.
• 
Moxeke’s main temple is 33 meters tall and dates to sometime 
between 1800 and 1400 B.C. The overall site plan clearly shows 
two housing sectors. This might be our first evidence of the ayllu, 
a political structure that exists in Andean communities even today.
Earliest Evidence of Violence
• 
Cerro Sechin, dating back to 1500 B.C., was found by Peruvian 
archaeologist Julio Tello in 1937. The main mound is surrounded 
by a 4-meter-tall stone wall made of granite, and within it were 
mounted more than 400 stone sculptures.
• 
The images show fighting warriors with weapons in their hands, 
some holding severed heads. Other sections show victorious 
warriors with heads hanging from their belts. This is our first 
evidence of institutionalized violence in South America.
• 
Hard dates have been difficult to get, but archaeolgists believe 
this wall of warriors in Sechin Alto was perhaps installed around  
900 B.C.
• 
Not just Sechin, but virtually all the early ceramic cities were 
abandoned around 900 B.C. Something major happened, but 
exactly what is still under investigation.

    Questions to Consider
Lecture 4: Ceramics, Textiles, and Organized States

Chavín and the Rise of Religious Authority
Lecture 5
I
n this lecture, we explore what has been called the “mother culture” of 
South America—the site at Chavín de Huántar. Chavín was centrally 
located, with access to resources and extensive trade. The Old Temple 
and New Temple at Chavín are notable for their fascinating iconography 
of the Fanged Deity, a religious symbol that soon spread across the Andes 
and along the coast. The ancient cult of the Fanged Deity, with the oracle at 
Chavín at its center, appears to share many traits with modern Amazonian 
religion. Chavín is the earliest South American site where religion appears as 
the basis for political authority.
Chavín de Huántar: The Mother Culture
• 
In 1919, just a few years after the discovery of Machu Picchu, 
Julio Tello discovered Chavín de Huántar high up in the Andes. 
It was obviously much older than anything found before, and he 
proclaimed it South America’s “mother culture.”
• 
Today, we know that Chavín de Huántar is not the oldest city in 
Peru. With an origin date of no earlier than 1200 B.C., Chavín is 
younger than many of the cities we’ve already discussed. However, 
there is still good reason to view it as the “mother culture” of 
Andean civilization. A model of political authority through religion 
seems to have started there, and it became the pattern for all cultures 
that came after.
• 
Chavín was built high up in the Andes, at 3,150 meters, or just 
over 10,000 feet, above sea level. It is six days’ walk away from 
the Amazon basin and six days’ walk from the northern coast, 
sitting in the path of least resistance through the Andes between the  
two regions.
• 
Chavín is also located in a fertile area, with a high annual rainfall 
and the Mosna River running through the middle of the city. The 

32
Lecture 5: Chavín and the Rise of Religious Authority
access to water allowed for highland farming, and the weather and 
altitude made it an excellent place for camelid herding.
The Old Temple
• 
The city was built in two major phases, designated as the Old 
Temple and the New Temple.
• 
The Old Temple’s time period shows that the residential population 
was small at the time it was built, probably fewer than 500 
people. How was such a beautiful city built by such a seemingly  
small population?
• 
The Old Temple has a u-shaped complex, just like the cities of 
the south-central coast. Inside the u-shaped complex is a circular 
sunken plaza, just like the cities of the north coast. But the Old 
Temple also has architectural elements that are not seen on the 
coast at all.
o	 The structures of its u-shaped complex are bilevel in height and 
connected, unlike the u-shaped complexes seen elsewhere.
o	 The structures that comprise other u-shaped complexes are 
solid. But at Chavín, a group of labyrinths is located inside the 
bilevel structures. 
o	 There are also standing stone monuments at Chavín and carved 
panels along the circular sunken plaza.
o	 Around the Old Temple is a large back wall, with a four-story 
set of fanged tenon heads. These are pieces of stone that sit 
back into the wall, with only the faces poking out. They are 
made of beautiful white granite; the closest quarry for that kind 
of stone is 18 kilometers away.
El Lanzón, the Fanged Deity
• 
In the central passageway of the u-shaped building stands a 
beautiful statue called El Lanzón, 4.5 meters tall. 

33
• 
Some people say that El Lanzón 
was the oracle of the Old Temple, 
and modern ethnography supports 
that. Until this century, locals 
recognized that spot as an oracle.
• 
The way that El Lanzón pokes 
out of the roof and comes down 
into the earth invokes the idea of 
an axis mundi, or a “world axis.” 
We see this sort of iconography 
and symbolism in ancient sites 
around the world.
• 
Tello called the image of El 
Lanzón the principal deity. It has 
also been called the Feline Deity or the Fanged Deity. In form, it is 
essentially humanoid, but it has a fanged mouth, rounded eyes, and 
snakes protruding from its head and its belt. Its hands and feet are 
clawed, prompting the feline description.
• 
El Lanzón is at the end of one of the passageways under the temple, 
but there are a number of other passageways, as well. The others 
lead into chambers where mass offerings were found, perhaps gifts 
to the oracle. 
Religion in the Old Temple
• 
On the perimeter of the circular sunken plaza within the u-shaped 
complex are stone-carved art panels in two registers. The lower 
register shows a group of prowling jaguars. The upper register shows 
men who appear to be in the process of transforming into jaguars. 
These men are the key to understanding the function of this temple.
• 
The men are becoming the Fanged Deity. Their costumes have 
snakes at the head and waist, and they are holding San Pedro  
cacti in their hands. The San Pedro cactus is a source of the 
hallucinogen mescaline. 
The Fanged Deity is depicted  
as essentially humanoid but 
with a fanged mouth and 
rounded eyes.

34
• 
These images suggest a major turning point in South American 
history—the development of religion in earnest. 
o	 Modern religion in the Amazon focuses on the role of the 
shaman, whose hallucinogen-induced trances are considered a 
link to the spiritual world. 
o	 In the Amazon, ayahuasca is commonly used as the 
hallucinogen. On the coast, the San Pedro cactus is the 
hallucinogen of choice. 
o	 The use of hallucinogens always points to shamanism in the 
ancient Americas.
• 
Traditional archaeolgists talk about a pantheon of gods in South 
America, but these gods may also be seen as many spirits or 
supernaturals under a single creator deity. Julio Tello thought that 
El Lanzón was Viracocha, the Inca creator deity, and some modern 
archaeologists agree with him. The images on the art panels of the 
Old Temple may depict priests who are channeling the power of the 
Fanged Deity.
The New Temple
• 
Around 500 B.C., a new wing was built off the Old Temple, known 
as the New Temple, and much of it is like the Old Temple. There 
is a bilevel building with passageways beneath, with a flat top and 
staircases extending to its platforms. 
• 
In front of the New Temple is another sunken plaza, but this time, 
it is rectangular, not circular. Recall that the sunken circular plaza 
sites along the coast were abandoned by 900 B.C., so the absence of 
this structure at the New Temple is not surprising.
• 
The staircase leading up to the top of the platform has an archway 
over the bottom steps. This is referred to as the Black and White 
Portal, and it has become the most recognized symbol of all the art 
at Chavín.

Religion in the New Temple
• 
The sunken plaza of the New Temple, like the Old Temple, contains 
images of the Fanged Deity. The elements of his costume are the 
same: snakes on his head and on his waist, hands and feet, goggle 
eyes, and fanged teeth.
• 
The Raimondi Stone seems to be the main monument of the New 
Temple. It is a tall, flat stone, depicting, once again, a fanged figure 
with claws and snakes on its waist, but this time, it is holding a staff 
in each hand. It is commonly called the Staff God and considered 
something different than the figure of El Lanzón. It may be the 
same figure as the Fanged Deity but holding two staffs.
• 
The Patio Stone, another representation of the Fanged Deity in the 
New Temple, holds not staffs but marine shells, perhaps indicating 
a connection to coastal peoples. 
• 
Also in the rectangular court are the same kinds of stone tenon 
heads that are on the back wall of the Old Temple. The faces are in 
different states of jaguar transformation. 
• 
Another monument found outside the rectangular court is called 
the Tello Obelisk. Its main image is a giant cayman, obviously 
Amazonian because no caymans live at 10,000 feet above sea 
level. On its lower register are two flying figures that appear to be 
shamans in the process of transformation.
The Society at Chavín
• 
In conjunction with the construction of the New Temple, Chavín’s 
population grew to more than 3,000 people. Residences started 
closing in on the ceremonial center, and they eventually surrounded 
the temple itself and the Mosna River.
• 
Obsidian suddenly became the most common stone material at the 
site. It has even been found in common houses. The closest source of 
obsidian is 500 kilometers to the south. It would appear that Chavín 
had a strong and widely stretched trade network at this point.

36
• 
As we have seen in other ancient cities, there are no obvious 
indications of elite housing or burials in Chavín. 
• 
There are also no substantial defensive features; the population 
there seems to have been unconcerned about attack.
• 
No historical public art has been found, that is, nothing that seems 
to celebrate the city itself. The only thing that is celebrated in art is 
the Fanged Deity.
Chavín as a Religious Center
• 
Around 500 B.C. and a little after, Chavín’s iconography began to 
travel. The cult of the Feline Deity, as it has been called, expanded 
into other highland sites and along the coast.
• 
Scholars suggest that Chavín de Huántar was the epicenter of a cult, 
and that El Lanzón and, perhaps later, the Raimondi Stone were the 
oracle spots. It seems that Chavín might have been a pilgrimage 
destination, and perhaps its ideas diffused outward with all those 
that visited. Ethnography confirms that El Lanzón was an oracle for 
the modern people of the last century. 
• 
A site called Pacha Kamaq, just south of Lima, is also known as an 
oracle site. From Spanish chronicles, we know that a wide network of 
branch temples developed, centered around the main oracle at Pacha 
Kamaq. Perhaps this is the same way that the Chavín cult spread.
• 
Between 200 and 300 B.C., Chavín seems to have lost its importance 
as a pilgrimage center. The population remained at the site, but they 
filled in the Old Temple circular plaza and built houses on top of it. 
The village was almost continually occupied until the 1940s.

Cupisnique to Salinar—Elite Rulers and War
Lecture 6
T
his lecture investigates a deep shift that occurred around 500 B.C. 
with the birth of the Salinar culture. Around 900 B.C., the influence 
of Chavín de Huántar appears to have been at its peak. Evidence of 
its influence has been found in the prolific production of Cupisnique pottery 
across the valleys. However, as the Old Temple at Chavín was abandoned 
around 500 B.C., a new settlement pattern emerged, characterized by smaller 
defensive communities devoid of public and religious architecture. This 
culture, known as Salinar, shows the first signs of warfare and socioeconomic 
hierarchy in South America and set the stage for the warlike cultures to follow.
 Chavín’s Influence on the Coast
• 
As Chavín de Huántar grew in importance and size, the northern 
coastal valleys underwent a myriad of changes, with new 
migrations, new politics, new architecture, and for the first time 
ever in Peru, clear signs of warfare.
• 
About 900 B.C., all of the sites with the u-shaped complexes in the 
south and the circular sunken plazas in the north were abandoned. 
The u-shaped design was honored at Chavín by about 1200 B.C. 
The Old Temple’s form was clearly inspired by the early coast 
examples. But then, by 900 B.C., Chavín’s increased influence 
along the coast seems to have led to the demise, or at least the 
abandonment, of these cities.
• 
Chavín’s influence is clear in the coastal valleys from a long known 
form of pottery we call Cupisnique. The form of this pottery is a 
stirrup vessel; it has a bulbous bottom and a spout shaped like a 
stirrup. Many of these Cupisnique stirrup vessels depict the Fanged 
Deity or other Amazonian-inspired religious imagery. There are 
two particularly famous examples of this pottery.

39
o	 The first, which we might call the “transformer pot,” shows the 
split image of a human face transforming into the jaguar-like 
visage of the Fanged Deity. It is particularly fascinating in that 
it shows the moment at which a human is transforming into a 
supernatural being.
o	 The other example is the “jaguar cactus pot.” It depicts a field 
of hallucinogenic San Pedro cacti, and peeking from behind 
them is a jaguar. The image clearly connects those two sacred 
elements: the hallucinogens of the coast and the transformation 
of the Amazon.
Caballo Muerto
• 
Initially, the source of the Cupisnique pottery was a mystery, 
because most of it had appeared on the market as a result of looting. 
The 
mystery 
was 
solved in 1972 with 
the discovery of the 
Caballo Muerto site.

means “dead horse,”

as

cities 
of

abandoned. Its name

site’s discoverer.

40
in its lifespan, it started producing the kind of Chavín-inspired art 
that is called Cupisnique.
• 
The city had the telltale u-shaped complex, but it was in the north, 
not in the south, where those complexes normally are found. 
Perhaps this architectural honoring of the south is another indication 
of Chavín’s influence. 
• 
The largest building at Caballo Muerto is called Huaca de los Reyes, 
and this structure is clearly Chavín-inspired. There were 12 massive 
images of the Fanged Deity’s face on its façade. Keep in mind that 
the site is an eight days’ walk away from the nearest jaguar. For 
reasons still poorly understood, Amazonian animals were central to 
the ideas of the people of the north coast.
• 
Oddly, the diet of those living at Caballo Muerto consisted mostly 
of fish, despite the fact that it is located far from the coast, and 
other cities during this time had developed diets based largely on 
agriculture. Perhaps Caballo Muerto, with its clear similarities 
to Chavín de Huántar, was along a maritime trade route for the 
highlands. This would clearly explain why it has so much Chavín 
imagery as compared to the other early ceramic cities in the  
coastal valleys. 
• 
The excavations at Caballo Muerto and the nearby site at Purulen 
indicate that the Chavín-inspired Cupisnique culture originated 
there, in the upper Moche Valley.
• 
Whether the Moche Valley sites predate the site at Chavín is still 
debated by scholars. Whatever the case, these sites were abandoned 
around 900 B.C., along with the other sites along the coast. After 
900 B.C., there is a gap in the archaeology until 500 B.C.
500 B.C.: The Birth of a New Culture
• 
As Chavín de Huántar ceased to be a pilgrimage site around 
500 B.C. and houses were built on what was once ceremonial 
architecture, things in the northern coastal valleys were also 
Lecture 6: Cupisnique to Salinar—Elite Rulers and War

41
radically changing. The valleys of the Moche and the nearby Virú 
Valley started to be repopulated but with such different settlement 
patterns that archaeologists consider it a new culture altogether: the 
Salinar culture.
• 
The people of the Salinar culture lived in small towns built on 
defensible ridge tops with walls around them. Notably, there 
were no more pyramids or platform mounds. State-level public 
architecture does not appear to have been important to this culture.
• 
The biggest site in the Moche Valley is Cerro Arenas. There are 
more than 2,000 stone structures densely packed on a defensive 
hilltop, and they are less than 1 kilometer from the coast—much 
closer to the water than previous settlements.
o	 Mace heads were found in some of these houses, as well as 
ceramic effigies of mace heads. These finds prove that fighting 
took place.
o	 This site and similar ones show an important social shift. For 
the first time ever in South America, we can identify elite 
housing compounds. Some people were clearly wealthier than 
others in these communities.
• 
Some say that Salinar sites are South America’s first urban centers, 
with varying socioeconomic levels living together in a single 
community. We start to see what we think are divisions of labor. As 
agriculture and food stores stabilized, the local economies turned to 
artisan endeavors and the development of material wealth. This is 
what archaeologists mean when they label a community as “urban.”
• 
The Moche Valley was not the only place where this new pattern 
was emerging. It also took hold in the important Casma Valley just 
to the south, with fortified cities emerging around 500 B.C.
The Emergence of Violence and Warfare
• 
One of the sites in the Casma Valley, Las Aldas, appears to have 
fallen along with the others in the area around 900 B.C. But this 

42
site shows evidence that it fell quite suddenly. An unfinished temple 
remains, complete with the survey equipment still in place; it 
appears the workers just dropped their tools and walked away.
• 
Around 500 B.C., fishermen built on top of the unfinished temple 
at Las Aldas, constructing a defensive settlement with no regard for 
the previous ceremonial architecture. Similarly fortified settlements 
were built throughout the area and in the neighboring Nepeña and 
Santa valleys.
• 
In the Santa Valley, we have found not only fortified communities 
but also citadels whose sole purpose appears to have been defensive. 
These citadels have double and triple walls with small entries and 
few, if any, residential structures.
• 
Perhaps the best example is the fort at Chankillo, located in the 
Casma Valley. It comprises three sets of walls, built on a hilltop. 
These appear to be comparable to the European concept of “kill 
lanes,” areas between walls where an enemy could be trapped and 
killed from above.
o	 Chankillo dates to about 500 to 200 B.C., falling into the 
same time period as the Salinar culture. It is not identified as a 
Salinar site, however, because it is outside of the geographical 
bounds typically associated with Salinar.
o	 In 2007, a set of towers at Chankillo was discovered to be part 
of a sophisticated astronomical calendar. This astronomical 
complex appears to mirror the destroyed Inca complex at Cuzco, 
which had been extensively described by Spanish chroniclers. 
Chankillo, however, predates Cuzco by at least 1,600 years and 
may point to a longstanding legacy inherited by the Inca.
Hallmarks of the Salinar Culture
• 
The birth of the Salinar culture around 500 B.C. marks the end of 
nearly 2,700 years of peaceful cohabitation in South America. It can 
be seen as the forebearer of an important and particularly warlike 
culture to follow: the Moche.
Lecture 6: Cupisnique to Salinar—Elite Rulers and War

43
• 
The Salinar culture is marked by four essential elements that 
appeared all at once.
o	 The previous theocracy governing a seemingly egalitarian, 
cooperative population no longer existed along the north coast.
o	 Many small, independent communities emerged with the first 
evidence of social and economic hierarchy.
o	 These communities made defensive structures a priority. This 
indicates fighting and perhaps full warfare, with communities 
possibly competing for material goods or defending themselves 
against an enemy we have not yet identified.
o	 This pattern is repeated consistently throughout seemingly 
independent city-states, indicating a shared cultural identity. 
This identity expanded over a wider area and into more valleys 
at once than ever before.
• 
The fall of old religious paradigms in this culture had immediate 
implications for power structures. For the first time in the region’s 
history, average people had to be worried that they might get hit 
in the head with a mace. Without theocratic institutions to turn to, 
the people sought the protection of powerful leaders, whose wealth 
apparently increased along with their influence.
• 
What happened to the old religion? Its fall seems to have been 
precipitated by the encroachment of population and residential 
structures over the previously sacred Old Temple at Chavín. This 
movement dishonored the function and purpose of the Old Temple 
and likely sent shockwaves through Chavín’s sphere of influence.
• 
When religion was no longer a tool to control the people, it seems 
that the leaders turned to fear and violence as motivators. This, in 
turn might have been the trigger point for a new social hierarchy—
an hierarchy that would find full expression in the Moche culture  
to follow.

Paracas—Mummies, Shamans, and Severed Heads
Lecture 7
I
n this lecture, we examine the extraordinary mummies of the Paracas 
culture in Peru. These mummies were found in 1924 by Julio Tello, and 
the hundreds of textiles and artifacts with which they were interred give 
us valuable insight into the Paracas culture. The Paracas people lived in 
simple pit houses but produced sophisticated textiles portraying the Fanged 
Deity of the Chavín culture. They also portray headhunting, still in practice in 
the Amazon today, as well as fascinating images of spiritual transformation. 
The elongated heads of many of these mummies have given rise to myths 
about alien ancestry, but science has shown that these deformations were the 
result of skull manipulation during infancy.
Discovery of the Paracas Mummies
• 
In 1924, incredibly fine textiles began showing up for sale in local 
markets in Lima, Peru. Julio Tello inquired about them, and in 
1925, he made what many consider his most important discovery: 
hundreds of mummies in shaft tombs wrapped in these same textiles. 
• 
Tello dated these mummies from 1000 to 200 B.C., and he called 
the culture associated with them “Paracas.”
• 
Multiple cemetery locations were found in and around Cerro 
Colorado, on the Paracas Peninsula, where the desert meets the sea. 
Hundreds of mummies were interred in mass graves, wrapped in 
bundles with textiles, ceramics, gold, and jewelry.
The Paracas Culture
• 
The area where the Paracas culture developed is located where the 
desert meets the sea and the cold Humbolt Current moves along 
the coast. The guano from the many sea birds in this area makes 
a valuable fertilizer; perhaps that is why the Paracas culture chose 
this as a place of settlement.

46
Lecture 7: Paracas—Mummies, Shamans, and Severed Heads
• 
The people of the Paracas culture lived in simple pit houses, a 
strategy used by many living in hot, arid deserts. 
o	 A pit house is dug into the desert, with the dwelling part 
beneath the surface. This allows the dwelling to maintain a 
comfortable temperature on hot days and cold nights. 
o	 Though this technique is used around the world, the Paracas 
people had no precedent for it; they invented it on their own.
• 
The Paracas culture was widespread, and there are a few urban sites 
that remain, but most of what we know about this culture comes 
from the mummy tombs.
Two Phases of the Paracas Tombs
• 
On the Paracas Peninsula, we find evidence of two phases of tomb 
building in the Paracas culture, an early one and a late one.
• 
The earlier phase is called Paracas Cavernas. During this phase, 
piles of mummies were dropped into shaft tombs. The shafts of 
these tombs ended in bell-shaped bases in which the mummies 
were laid. The tombs from this phase are located on top of Cerro 
Colorado and date from 1000 to 500 B.C.
• 
The second, later phase is called the Paracas Necropolis. The shafts 
of these tombs were buried under the pit houses and held only a 
few mummies, after which the shaft was filled with rocks. The later 
tombs date from 500 to 200 B.C. 
Textiles in the Mummy Bundles
• 
On the outside, the mummies were wrapped in fairly plain textiles. 
But inside this outer covering, the bodies were wrapped in layers of 
more intricate textiles. 
• 
These textiles include things both made specifically for the bundles 
and preserved from use in practical life, such as shirts, wraps,  
and mantles.

47
• 
The mantles are generally only as wide as a person; the fact that 
they were made on back-strap looms naturally limited their width. 
Sometimes, two were stitched together to create a larger mantle.
• 
Gold, ceramic, and other special items were also often included in 
the mummy bundles.
The Practice of Mummification in South America
• 
Mummies are a core part of Andean society throughout its history. 
The Chinchurro mummies date to 5000 B.C., well before any of the 
cities that we’ve discussed in earlier lectures.
• 
The Wari culture, which we’ll discuss in an upcoming lecture, 
presents the first evidence we have of the veneration of mummies. 
The people of this culture dedicated rooms in their living structures 
for the storage and veneration of mummies, including them 
as participants in their everyday lives. Perhaps the Wari were 
influenced in their mummy traditions by the nearby Paracas culture.
• 
The later Inca culture took the veneration of mummies even further. 
Deceased royalty remained in court and were brought out for 
public ceremonies. These mummies were considered living and 
participating members of the community.
• 
Other world cultures often believe that spirits leave the physical 
world. But according to Andean beliefs, the spirits of the dead 
remain with the land and use their mummified bodies as touch 
points with the physical realm. 
Skull Deformation in the Paracas Culture
• 
Mummies in the Necropolis phase have distinctly elongated skulls 
that are larger than a normal skull would be. Hundreds of these 
deformed skulls have been found in the Necropolis tombs.
• 
Many theories claim that this deformation was the result of skull 
manipulation on small children. The presence of extra bone in the 
skulls indicates that the practice of skull manipulation began from 

48
infancy, when the skull was still malleable and producing new 
growth. It is thought that the skulls of newborns were shaped using 
boards and then wrapped to maintain the shape and promote the 
elongated growth. 
• 
The presence of skull deformation has also led to other theories 
not espoused by archaeology, especially the theory that the Paracas 
culture was established by aliens.
• 
Some of these skulls show clear signs of what appears to be brain 
surgery. Small circular or square holes were cut into the skulls 
and healed in such a way to indicate that the patient survived the 
surgery. It is unclear why these surgeries were performed, but they 
seem to have been successful.
• 
Some mummies show signs that their heads were removed in 
context and then replaced. Some of the bundles were found with 
nothing but heads inside. This puzzling discovery is most likely 
connected to the Amazonian practice of headhunting, which we’ll 
discuss in more detail in a later lecture.
Chavín Iconography in the Paracas Textiles
• 
The iconography present on the Paracas mummy textiles gives 
us insight into the religion of this culture in a way that no other 
evidence can match.
• 
These textiles are contemporaneous with the last phases of Chavín 
de Huántar. The worship of the Fanged Deity continued at the New 
Temple at Chavín, and we see the same god clearly present in the 
Paracas textiles. However, new elements in the Paracas textiles 
indicate a different kind of relationship with the deity. 
• 
There are many themes in the Paracas textiles; some of them are 
geometric and some have animal designs or bird designs. But the 
most common design is what scholars call “supernatural” human-
like figures.
Lecture 7: Paracas—Mummies, Shamans, and Severed Heads

49
o	 If we look at a typical figure in Paracas textiles and compare 
it to what we see at Chavín, the similarities are obvious. We 
see the fangs coming off the face, the clawed hands and feet, 
and the large circular eyes. The most diagnostic elements are 
the snakes coming off the belt and sometimes the hair. These 
elements would seem to confirm that the same deity is shown 
in both cultures.
o	 The textiles also have similarities to the Tello Obelisk in that 
they present flying figures. These figures are often flying in 
groups of 20 or 30—something not seen in the art from Chavín.
New Iconography in the Paracas Textiles
• 
The new elements of the Paracas textiles are particularly interesting 
in light of their influence on later cultures. These new elements 
include the presence of the jaguar headdress, the inclusion of feline 
whiskers on the faces, the distinct sacred objects held by the figures, 
and the portrayal of severed heads on the belts and in the hands of 
the figures.
• 
The jaguar headdress has extenuated 
whiskers and an abstracted face and often 
does not look like a jaguar, but there are a 
few telling examples, in which the face is 
replaced by an entire jaguar. The whiskers 
on these faces also indicate a reference to the 
jaguar. It is the first time that we see them in 
South American culture but not the last.
• 
The objects in the hands of the figures are 
very distinct. The Paracas culture doesn’t 
show us what these mysterious objects are, 
but later cultures do: They are Tumi knives, 
specifically used for decapitation. In Moche, 
we see these knives as the main tool of what 
literature calls the Decapitator Deity.
Some of the figures 
in the Paracas 
textiles hold Tumi 
knives, used for 
decapitation.

• 
The tradition of headhunting in ancient South American culture is 
fundamentally misunderstood. The heads seen in the art and found 
severed and lying in grave sites are usually called “trophy heads.” 
Indeed they are, but they are much more than just trophies.
o	 These heads were objects of power, used to control the spirits 
of the dead and the other world and make them do their 
owners’ bidding.
o	 Even today, decapitation takes place in the Amazon. The 
Jívaro are famous for headhunting. Supposedly, it was made 
illegal a few decades back, but according to recent reports, the 
practice persists.
o	 The Jívaro believe that when an enemy is killed, its spirit 
becomes a dangerous malevolent force, called a muisak, that 
will seek revenge if not subdued. The spirit is captured in the 
head, and that head becomes the servant of that person who 
killed it.
o	 To capture the spirit, the skull is removed and all the holes are 
sewed up; then, the skull is filled with hot sand, and ropes are 
fed through it so it can hang from a belt or in a shrine.
o	 Skulls in the Paracas period show similar treatment, especially 
in the stringing of heads from a belt.
• 
Why are the figures on Paracas textiles so frequently flying? This is 
the mode of transportation to the other world. Shamans and healers 
in the Amazon and other places around South America explain that 
when they journey to the spirit world, they do so by flying.
Theories of Transformation
• 
The supernatural figures in Paracas textiles seem to be human 
shamans in the process of transformation.
o	 These figures may be transforming into jaguars, similar to 
Amazonian shamans. The Warao of Venezuela have tobacco 
shamans whose skin turns yellow and whose pores excrete 
Lecture 7: Paracas—Mummies, Shamans, and Severed Heads

51
nicotine that smell to the local populace like jaguar feces. 
But in Paracas art, all sorts of animals also transform, not 
just humans.
o	 The supernatural figures may be impersonating the Fanged 
Deity with costumes, but there are no costumes evident in the 
artifact record.
o	 Finally, the figures may be channeling the Fanged Deity 
through rituals. A strong case can be made for this theory, in 
that the transformation process seems to be complete at the 
still-humanoid Fanged Deity form, not continuing on into a full 
jaguar standing on all fours.
• 
Much about the figures and the transformation process on these 
textiles remains unclear.

    Questions to Consider
1.	 How did clearly Amazonian iconography take such strong hold  
in Paracas? 
2.	 Why didn’t Paracas fall into the same kind of militarized fortress 
building as that seen from the same period north of Lima on the coast? 
3.	 How did the Paracas people learn to weave such complex patterns and 
dye fabric so well? Was there a precursor, or is this another “invention”?

The Nazca Lines and Underground Channels
Lecture 8
I
n this lecture, we turn to the Nazca culture, renowned for the famous 
geoglyphs carved into the high plains. But the Nazca are notable for much 
more than the geoglyphs: They were master farmers; produced beautiful 
polychrome pottery and impressive textiles; and appear to have practiced the 
skull deformation, headhunting, and Fanged Deity worship of the Paracas 
culture before them. The geoglyphs, however, are what has captured the 
imagination of people today, mainly because of the mystery surrounding 
them. Though theories about alien involvement persist, archaeology has 
shown that these lines were made relatively recently (400–650 A.D.), that 
they could easily be made using basic land surveying, and that they most 
likely served a religious purpose. 
The Nazca Culture and Agriculture
• 
The Nazca were an amazingly ingenious people who transformed 
the desert into arable farmland and created beautiful painted 
ceramics. Those achievements are often overshadowed by the 
massive geoglyphs they created out in the desert, known as the 
Nazca lines.
• 
For all intents and purposes, the Nazca are the same culture as the 
Paracas, evolving their arts and religion and moving deeper into the 
deserts to farm. As the Paracas areas were abandoned, the Nazca 
communities emerged.
• 
The Nazca were the best farmers those valleys have ever seen. There 
was little seafood in the diet of these people; instead, they ate corn, 
squash, sweet potatoes, and the Amazonian-originated manioc.
o	 Today, we know manioc as the main ingredient of tapioca, but 
it was originally a semi-poisonous plant.
o	 Manioc needs a swampy area in which to grow; the Nazca 
irrigation systems were strong enough to support this.
Lecture 8: The Nazca Lines and Underground Channels

53
o	 To process the poison out of the manioc, the Nazca hung it 
from nets so that the poison would drip out as it dried.
• 
In addition to food products, the Nazca also cultivated cotton, coca, 
and the hallucinogenic San Pedro cactus.
Sophisticated Irrigation
• 
The Nazca transformed the desert through a large-scale irrigation 
system. These systems could not have been constructed without a 
large organized labor force and expert engineers.
• 
The Nazca located access points to underground aquifers and 
excavated underground channels leading out of them into their 
croplands. Today, those channels are called puquios.
• 
The underground channels were accessed by a series of wells called 
ojos. The wells had spiral-shaped walking paths that allowed access 
to the puquios for maintenance and household supply.
• 
These wells still have water in them and are still in use by the 
people of the Nazca and Ica valleys, though the demand of the large 
population has largely depleted the aquifers.
Nazca Communities
• 
Nazca communities seem to have been small villages, consisting 
mainly of pit houses with perishable roofs. They may have also 
lived in the weaved-grass huts that are found in the area today, but 
these have not survived in the archaeological record.
• 
The major archaeolgical site in the Nazca area is Cahuachi, 
which has hundreds of mounds and a 70-foot-high main pyramid. 
Cahuachi was thought for a long time to be the Nazca capital city, 
but recent excavations have shown a distinct lack of homes there. 
More than 40 of the mounds are actually just carved hills, not stone 
structures. What originally looked like hundreds of mounds seems 
instead to be sculpted landscape.

54
• 
Cahuachi is now thought to be another pilgrimage site, specifically 
for the Nazca people. This is evidenced by the lack of dwellings 
and the copious amounts of pottery, textiles, food, and shells, which 
suggest the leaving of offerings.
Art and Artifacts of the Nazca Culture
• 
The beautiful art and the character of Nazca burials give us an 
insight into the social organization of these people, the technologies 
they developed, and their religious beliefs.
• 
Nazca pottery, known as “polychrome pottery,” is some of the most 
beautiful ever produced in South America. The forms were very 
intricate, and the paint is vibrant and beautiful.
o	 These beautiful, elaborate pieces are found even in simple 
houses. Once again, this indicates a certain egalitarian aspect 
to society; everyone seems to have had access to these fine, 
beautiful wares.
o	 In addition to creating vibrantly colored pottery, the Nazca 
created shapes and styles not seen elsewhere in South American 
culture. One example is the double stirrup vessel, reminiscent of 
the stirrup vessel we saw earlier but with two spouts. They also 
made effigy vessels with images of various animals and plants.
o	 The Nazca were the first to develop a pre-firing painting 
technique, which gives their pottery a vibrancy and luster not 
seen elsewhere.
o	 The most common subjects in the pottery, as with Paracas  
art before it, are the priests in the guise of jaguars and the 
Fanged Deity.
• 
The Nazca also produced fine textiles, just like their Paracas 
ancestors. Some of them display an incredibly tight weave, even 
more so than the Paracas textiles. Though images were weaved into 
the fabrics, the Nazca also had a technique of painting on the cloth.
Lecture 8: The Nazca Lines and Underground Channels

55
• 
In addition to images of the Fanged Deity, Nazca art also shows many 
instances of the severed heads we’ve seen in other cultures. Actual 
severed heads have been found in large quantity in Nazca burials.
Nazca Skull Deformation
• 
The Nazca, like the Paracas, practiced cranial deformation. Many 
heads have been found with deformation so extreme that one 
wonders if these people sustained brain damage.
• 
There is also evidence of cranial trepanation—the sort of brain 
surgery we saw in the Paracas culture. As was the case with the 
Paracas, we see indications that the patients survived the surgery 
and began to heal.
• 
Though the cranial trepanation could have been performed 
for medical reasons, it is more likely that it was practiced as a 
religious ritual—perhaps opening the skull so that harmful spirits  
could escape.
The Famous Nazca Lines
• 
The Nazca lines are huge geoglyphs that were carved into the desert 
in the Nazca area. 
They are so large 
and 
magnificent 
that people wonder 
how they could 
have been made, 
for what purpose, 
and why they can 
be seen only from 
the sky.
• 
The Nazca created 
massive geoglyphs 
on the high, flat 
plains between the 
Nazca and Palpa 
The Nazca lines represent elements also found 
on pottery, textiles, and other artifacts, such  
as geometric shapes, animal forms, and  
human forms.

56
valleys. Because the plains are out of reach of El Niño floods, many 
of these lines have been preserved.
• 
The question of why the lines stand out on the desert floor so clearly 
from above is fairly simple to answer. There are dark rocks and 
reddish soil covering the Nazca plains. When those rocks and the 
topsoil are brushed away, just underneath the surface is lighter, white 
sand. The topsoil is so thin that it is easily scraped away by foot.
• 
The forms of these giant Nazca lines vary greatly. There are 
geometric shapes, spirals, lines (some of which emanate out of a 
center point), and a variety of animal and human forms. Some of 
the lines extend for kilometers, all the way across the valley floor.
• 
The most famous of the forms are those representing animals. We 
can see a monkey, an orca, and a hummingbird that extends for 
more than two football fields.
• 
Some have suggested that there was a master plan to the Nazca lines, 
but when seen from above, the images are completely disorganized. 
In some instances, they even overlap or partially erase each other.
 Mysteries and Misconceptions of the Nazca Lines
• 
There is an air of mystery surrounding the Nazca lines, and along 
with it, many outlandish claims. People commonly say they could 
not have been made by human hands, that they are probably much 
older than the Nazca people themselves, and even that they might 
be ancient landing strips for aliens.
• 
The age questions are easily addressed. Ground surveys have found 
many Nazca pottery shards in and around the lines, most of them 
dating to about 400 to 650 A.D. More tellingly, we also have a set 
of wooden survey stakes that have been found in and around the 
lines, also dating to the period 400 to 650 A.D.
• 
How were the lines made? There have been some interesting and 
amusing attempts to answer this question.
Lecture 8: The Nazca Lines and Underground Channels

57
o	 An archaeolgical experiment was done to prove that Nazca 
textiles could have been used to build a hot air balloon to 
give the Nazca an aerial perspective. Although the experiment 
proved that a hot air balloon could be made from the textiles, 
it went hilariously wrong when strong winds snapped the 
balloon’s cords and sent two hapless investigators floating 100 
kilometers off course.
o	 Most scholars agree that the wooden stakes that were found 
were used to develop sight lines. Although this shows a 
good deal of intelligence on the part of the Nazca, it is not 
particularly special. Two men with stakes and a rope could 
make a Nazca line.
• 
Why were the lines made? That is a more difficult question to 
answer. There are several popular theories.
o	 One theory holds that the lines were alien spaceship landing 
pads. No one has yet excavated a spaceship on the Nazca 
plains, and it must be noted that the soft sand would make 
takeoff and landing difficult.
o	 According to another theory, the lines are some sort of 
astronomical calendar. Some sets of lines do indeed align 
themselves with solar, lunar, and sometimes planetary 
alignments. But there are hundreds of lines, so those few 
examples are statistically insignificant when we look at all of 
the geoglyphs.
o	 Yet another theory holds that the lines lead to underground 
water sources or aquifers. In the 1990s, David Johnson 
proposed that trapezoidal geoglyphs pointed to subsurface 
aquifers and informed the Nazca where to dig their wells. 
Intensive studies in 2000 to 2003 didn’t verify this theory; the 
trapezoids seemed to be statistically random, though a few do 
point to aquifers.

58
o	 Finally, the lines may have been pilgrimage paths. This theory 
points to individual groups, over time, making their own 
kinds of lines and disrespecting earlier lines as having already 
served their purpose. The pottery shards perhaps indicate 
offerings, though it is unclear to whom or for what purpose. 
Lines in the Palpa Valley show the Fanged Deity, which could 
support this theory.
• 
Nazca archaeology indicates that the Nazca people, like the Paracas 
people before them, were headhunting, manioc-eating jaguar 
imitators. But they were a walk of at least two weeks away from the 
Amazon. Those Amazonian origins seem more mysterious than the 
lines they scratched in the desert.

    Questions to Consider

59
The Moche—Pyramids, Gold, and Warriors 
Lecture 9
W
ith the emergence of the Moche culture along the coast, building, 
farming, religion, art, and war were amplified. The Moche are 
best known for the incredible corpus of art they left behind, but 
they were also Peru’s most prolific pyramid builders, superior fishermen, 
expert farmers, and ferocious warriors. Over the next several lectures, we 
will look at all of those aspects of Moche life, but in this lecture, we’ll start 
with the basics: Who were the Moche and how did they live?
Discovery of the Moche Culture
• 
Starting in the 1st century A.D., the Moche culture spread across the 
central and north valleys, from Lambayeque down to modern Lima. 
• 
German archaeologist Max Uhle ran the first excavations in 1899 
at Huaca de la Luna and found 21 tombs of elite individuals buried 
with gold and beautiful ceramics. He coined the term “Moche” for 
the culture, naming it after the nearby modern town of Moche and 
the valley surrounding it.
• 
A wealthy agriculturalist named Rafael Larco Hoyle deserves credit 
for saving tens of thousands of pieces of Moche ceramics from the 
black market, building a museum for them in Lima.
o	 Larco Hoyle collected more than 30,000 Moche artifacts, 
mostly pots, from the farms he controlled.
o	 The Larco Herrera Museum in Lima is named for his father. 
Today, it holds the most extensive collection of Moche pottery 
in the world.
o	 The museum has organized the pottery thematically. This 
system allows archaeologists and others to see in person the 
characteristics that define these themes, instead of relying on 
pictorial representations in books.

60
• 
Another large collection of Andean pottery has recently been 
discovered in a very unlikely place: underneath a gas station in 
Trujillo. This collection was amassed by José Cassinelli, another 
wealthy agriculturalist.
• 
These artifacts collected by Larco Hoyle, Cassinelli, and others can 
be traced back to the pyramids on the north coast of Peru.
The Moche Pyramids
• 
The coastal valleys are covered with gigantic pyramids made of 
adobe bricks. They were typically accessed not by stairs but by 
ramps covered in stucco. Weathering and looting have now eroded 
them to indistinct piles of sand, so they are not as popular or well-
known as pyramids from other cultures.
• 
The biggest complex is at Moche itself. It is a pyramid pair called 
the Huaca del Sol (“Shrine of the Sun”) and the Huaca de la Luna 
(“Shrine of the Moon”). Huaca del Sol was the largest structure in all 
of ancient South America until the Spanish looted and destroyed it.
• 
The discovery of the rich tombs in Sipán in 1987 brought attention 
to the previously dismissed coastal pyramids, and now dozens have 
been excavated.
• 
In the process of excavating the Moche pyramids, many wonderful 
murals have been revealed, painted in brilliant colors on carved 
stucco. The murals on top of the Huaca de la Luna are typical of 
these kinds of stuccos. They once again portray the Fanged Deity.
o	 Recall that in the time of the Salinar culture, in the same 
Moche Valley, pyramids and religious art were completely 
absent. With the Moche culture, they return, bigger and better 
than ever before.
o	 The Fanged Deity in the Moche culture is called Ai-Apaec. 
The Moche language died off two centuries ago, so no one is 
really sure now what the name originally meant. 
Lecture 9: The Moche—Pyramids, Gold, and Warriors 

61
o	 Some of the Huaca de la Luna murals show warriors and some 
show naked and bound captives. In addition to the Fanged 
Deity, upper registers show fantastic spiders with human faces 
or snakes.
A Unified Collection of City-States?
• 
The political structure of the Moche is still a question of debate 
among scholars. Was the Moche culture a unified empire, or did it 
consist of independent city-states? The city-state model seems to fit 
the Moche evidence best.
• 
The u-shaped complexes and sunken circular courts of 2,000 
years earlier were independent cities, but they shared certain 
characteristics. What the Moche sites have that those early sites did 
not are diverse urban populations surrounding them.
• 
The site at Huaca del Brujo along the coast has painted murals 
depicting exactly the same imagery as those at Huaca de la Luna. 
For that reason, it seems that these two cities, though independent, 
shared the same kind of cosmology.
Settlement Patterns among the Moche
• 
Just as people did in the Salinar culture, the Moche people lived 
in socioeconomically diverse communities, but in this culture, the 
settlements were arranged in temple groups.
• 
In Pampa Grande in the Lambayeque Valley, hundreds of residential 
units were excavated. Within these residential units were apartment 
compounds. Some of these compounds had more than 100 rooms, 
with kitchens, living spaces, storage areas, and workshops. Both rich 
and poor people seem to have lived together in the same compounds.
• 
Multiple Moche cities had populations of more than 10,000 people. 
They were supported by wide-scale irrigation systems, more than 
Peru had ever seen. We see evidence in the cities of the first instance 
of a staple crop: corn.

62
• 
Extensive road systems were built between communities, some 
running from valley to valley. These roads were dug and filled, 
curved or raised, and some of them were walled or topped with 
adobe. Though the Inca are famous for their road system, the 
Moche culture began formal road construction much earlier. Some 
of these roads head straight for the Amazon.
Advancements in Art
• 
The Moche made beautiful ceramics and textiles, though few 
are well preserved. Works of gold and silver really became their 
standout medium.
o	 The Moche made intricate metalwork using the lost-wax 
method more famously used in Europe and Asia. It important 
to note that the Moche had no contact with Europe or Asia, so 
they essentially invented the lost-wax method on their own.
o	 They also crafted detailed gold and silver artifacts by pounding 
thin sheets of the metals over hard-carved surfaces. Inlays of 
precious stone and shells were often added as final touches to 
the pieces.
• 
Ceramics were commonly mold made. While the contemporary 
Nazca were making colorful, pre-fire-painted pieces, the Moche 
were using fine lines of simple black or red to paint elaborate scenes 
on thousands of stirrup vessels. 
• 
On these ceramics, we see images of hunting and fishing, elaborate 
religious rituals, portrayals of pilgrimages, and scenes of warfare. 
But Moche pottery is most well-known for its sexual imagery.
• 
The Moche also had a magnificent tradition of ceramic portraiture, 
so lifelike that it was obviously based on real people, not abstract or 
idealized faces. Its realism rivaled the Roman stone-carved busts.
Warfare among the Moche
• 
Before the Moche, we had only hints of warfare in South America: 
severed heads and the occasional image of a weapon, but nothing 
Lecture 9: The Moche—Pyramids, Gold, and Warriors 

63
concrete. Not only did the Moche prominently feature war in 
their art, but with their culture, we can, for the first time, detect it 
archaeologically.
• 
Some ceramic pieces suggest that the Moche fielded sizable armies 
and took captives to be sacrificed. Some pieces show an entire 
landscape of two armies meeting in the hills.
• 
It is clear that the Moche had maces, spears, shields, armor, and 
helmets; these items were found both depicted in the art and as 
actual artifacts during excavations. There is evidence that weapons 
were used as architectural decorations, as well.
• 
Multiple ceramics show details of captives, beheadings, and 
mutilations. The evidence of these macabre sacrifices was limited 
to the images from pottery paintings until the 1990s, when Steve 
Bourget and John Verano found piles of sacrificed victims buried in 
a plaza next to the Huaca de la Luna—young men with evidence of 
war wounds and cut throats.
• 
Who were they fighting? Both sides in these battle scenes are 
typically dressed essentially the same, leading to the conclusion 
that the Moche were fighting amongst themselves.
Surrounding Cultures
• 
There is evidence of cultures near the Moche that archaeology 
views as distinct people. Three of the major ones are the Virú, the 
Lima, and the Recuay.
• 
The Virú culture was located in the Virú Valley, right in the middle 
of Moche territory. The Virú people seem to have started a little 
earlier than the Moche, perhaps as early as 200 B.C. 
o	 Huaca Gallinazo is the main complex identified as Virú.  
It consists of adobe brick pyramids surrounded by dense 
urban populations. 

64
o	 For all practical purposes, the Virú people are Moche. Their 
artifacts, construction techniques, and way of life are the same 
as those exhibited by the Moche, although the Virú are, for the 
moment, still considered a separate culture.
• 
The Recuay culture is also similar to the Moche but with some key 
differences.
o	 The Recuay settled high up in the Andes, at 11,000 feet above 
sea level.
o	 Like the Virú, they began earlier than the Moche, perhaps 
around 200 B.C. Some scholars see them as a bridge between 
the Chavín and the Moche.
o	 The city of Recuay itself survived until 650 A.D., which means 
that these people must have had relations with the Moche along 
the coast. Perhaps the Recuay were the people the Moche were 
fighting with.
• 
The Lima culture was located in the valleys that are now covered 
by the sprawling modern-day city of Lima.
o	 Huacas Pucllana and Huallamarca are Lima sites that have 
become tourist attractions in modern Lima. Huallamarca is a 
huge pyramid, 100 by 500 meters at its base and 22 meters tall. 
o	 The Lima people were contemporaneous with Moche but 
eventually were taken over by the Wari.
o	 Pachacamac is another site just south of Lima, known as an 
oracle site. Archaeolgy tells us it was built during Moche times, 
but it is considered part of the Lima culture. The god portrayed 
at this site bears a distinct resemblance to the Fanged Deity.
The Disappearance of the Moche
• 
Moche civilization ended abruptly, with the centers being 
abandoned en mass about 800 A.D. It would be at least 100 years 
Lecture 9: The Moche—Pyramids, Gold, and Warriors 

65
before the populations of the valleys got organized enough to start 
building pyramids again.
• 
The full reasons for the fall of the Moche civilization are still a 
mystery, but recent ancient climatic studies indicate that a series of 
El Niños may have been responsible. These weather patterns would 
have catastrophically affected water and food supplies.

The Moche—Richest Tombs in the New World
Lecture 10
I
n this lecture, we examine what may be the most important archaeological 
find in South America: the royal tombs of the Moche. These tombs were 
discovered by accident and were saved from looting only by the speed 
and determination of archaeologist Walter Alva and his team. They contained 
some of the most exquisite artifacts yet discovered—beautiful gold and 
silver work, intricate beading and molding, and a wealth of images and 
costume elements portraying the ritual practices of the Moche. One artifact 
in particular, the Presentation Ceremony pot, has been cited as evidence that 
the Moche royalty drank the blood of human sacrifices, but this evidence is 
not conclusive.
Discovery of the Royal Moche Tombs
• 
We have seen elite royalty depicted in Moche art, but where was the 
evidence for them? Looted objects were our only hint until 1987, 
when the first royal Moche tombs were found by accident.
• 
Our first glimpse of royal Moche tombs came with the discovery of 
the pyramid complex known as Sipán. The small town of Sipán in 
the Lambayeque Valley lent its name to the ancient pyramids that 
tower above it.
• 
In 1987, a local museum director, Walter Alva, was called to the 
police station to collect looted artifacts. These works of fine gold 
and silver were of a caliber that he had never before seen. The 
informants the police had captured told him that they came from the 
pyramids themselves.
• 
The looters had dug deeply into the top of the smallest of the 
pyramids and uncovered what was clearly a royal tomb. The 
townspeople found the site and claimed its contents for themselves. 
Alva led an emergency excavation, under the pressure of time and 
an angry mob of villagers. Sidney Kirkpatrick’s book Lords of 

68
Sipan is a great account of the perils faced by the archaeologists as 
they tried to guard the artifacts.
• 
Over the next year of excavations, Alva’s team found three 
incredible tombs.
Clues to the Burial Sites
• 
The key to the discovery of the tombs was noting that they had 
been dug into the pyramid and then filled with dirt and covered with 
adobe bricks. 
• 
Once 
this 
pattern 
was 
understood, 
archaeologists 
only had to look for spots 
that were covered but not 
filled with bricks in order to 
find a tomb.
• 
This marks an important 
difference between Moche 
and 
Egyptian 
pyramids. 
Egyptian 
pyramids 
were 
built specifically as royal 
tombs, whereas the Moche 
pyramids seem to have been 
built for some other purpose 
and then retrofitted as tombs.
Moche Tomb 1
• 
Tomb 1’s chamber was 5 
meters square, and it was 
located 7 meters under the 
surface. This depth most 
likely saved the tomb from 
earlier 
looting, 
because 
it was hard to reach just 
by digging.
Lecture 10: The Moche—Richest Tombs in the New World
The incredible tombs at Sipán were 
the first Moche royal tombs to be 
found before looters destroyed  
them and have yielded a steady 
stream of pottery, jewelry, textiles, 
and other objects.

• 
A central wooden coffin sat in the middle of this tomb surrounded 
by a wealth of objects. There were also bodies of eight other people, 
as well as two llamas and hundreds of ceramic vessels in the form 
of small people. The tomb was topped with a wooden beam roof.
o	 The bodies buried alongside the central coffin included two 
young men, perhaps guards; three teenage girls who showed 
signs of having died previously and been moved; a 10-year-
old boy with indications of malnourishment; a footless man 
in his 20s; and a seated man placed in a “watchman” position 
above the tomb.
o	 The presence of these bodies indicates that the Moche believed 
that an entourage could follow the dead into the afterlife.
• 
Though the tomb itself was impressive, it was really the objects found 
inside the wooden coffin itself that astounded Alva and his team.
o	 The man in his 30s who was buried inside the central tomb was 
covered in multiple layers of ritual costuming, jewelry, and 
objects of art.
o	 The ritual costuming was exactly like that featured in the 
Moche murals, confirming for the first time that the people and 
practices portrayed in the art also reflected Moche reality.
Art and Artifacts in Tomb 1
• 
A banner made of tiny gold plates weaved together with thin wire 
sat on top. We also see similar banners depicted in Moche pottery.
• 
There were also necklaces made of tiny beads, thousands of them, 
fashioned from shell and precious stone in a variety of colors. The 
cotton string that had held these beads together had long since 
disintegrated. Team members placed a resin-soaked cloth on top of 
the beads so that they were able to pick up the necklace intact and 
reconstruct it in the museum.
• 
Another necklace was made of half gold and half silver, pounded 
over detailed molds. Gold and silver in Moche culture indicated 

70
the same kind of duality as between man and woman or, more 
commonly, between the sun and the moon.
• 
There were also three sets of beautiful ear flares made of gold 
inlayed with turquoise and shell. An ear flare is a very large earring 
in the form of a disc, 2 or 3 inches in diameter, with a large pin on 
the back for attachment to the ear.
• 
The warrior ear flares are especially fascinating. All of the 
component pieces come apart, something like an action figure. 
The warrior on the flare has a nosepiece similar to the one that was 
found on the body, as well as decorative belt bells showing the 
Decapitator Deity.
o	 In Moche literature, the Decapitator Deity is often listed as a 
unique god. He gets his name from the knife he holds in one 
hand and the severed head in the other.
o	 However, the creature also has the fangs, goggle eyes, and claws 
of the Fanged Deity and may, in fact, be the Fanged Deity.
• 
Two Tumi knife effigies were also found in the tomb. One effigy 
was topped with the likeness of the Decapitator Deity, and the other 
has an ornate headdress topped with pink flamingo feathers.
• 
Oddly, there were no weapons found with the body—only two 
ritual objects that appeared to have functioned as scepters.
Art and Artifacts in Tomb 2
• 
Tomb 2 was similar in form to Tomb 1, with two young women in 
other coffins, a boy and a dog buried together in a coffin, and an 
adult male buried above the roof.
• 
Inside the main coffin was, once again, a man in his 30s layered 
above and below with costumes and jewelry. The individual was 
not as richly interred as Tomb 1, but the array was still impressive.
Lecture 10: The Moche—Richest Tombs in the New World

71
• 
This tomb contained one set of ear flares made with the lost-wax 
technique, as well as an intricate gold necklace portraying fanged 
human faces.
• 
Set against the back of the body at the waistline was another Tumi 
effigy, this one half gold and half silver. 
o	 The placement of the piece and the images of pieces like 
it in Moche ceramic art lead some scholars to believe that it 
functioned as a piece of back armor.
o	 Leo Welch has pointed out that this back armor would be 
especially effective at protecting the sacrum of the back from 
damage by a mace during battle.
• 
Perhaps the most beautiful piece in Tomb 2 was a gilded copper 
headdress in the form of an owl. Each of its feathers hung free by 
thin metal wires and its eyes were made of turquoise and white shell.
Art and Artifacts in Tomb 3
• 
Tomb 3 was different than the others. It dated about 100 years 
earlier and lacked the same kind of burial chamber. Its wealth, 
however, rivaled Tomb 1. 
• 
There was no wood coffin in this tomb. Instead, the body was 
wrapped in dozens of reed mats. As in Tomb 1, above and below the 
body were layers of beautiful objects, textiles, and precious metals.
• 
Tomb 3’s most finely made piece lay on top, a necklace of very 
thin wire disks, each one depicting a spider with a human face on 
its back.
• 
Two pieces of gold art were interred with the body, each depicting 
the Fanged Deity. One is the classic image with the fangs, claws, 
and protruding eyes. The other has the protruding eyes but no visible 
fangs. It is called the Crab Deity and some consider it a separate 
god, but again, it may be another version of the Fanged Deity.

72
• 
As in Tomb 1, Tomb 3 contained Decapitator belt bells, which 
means that this costume element continued for generations. These 
bells may have been part of a particular ritual costume.
• 
There was also a scepter with a clear image of a house that had 
severed heads hanging on the inside. This most likely indicates a 
Moche custom of displaying severed heads.
The Presentation Ceremony
• 
In the 1970s, UCLA professor Christopher Donnan named an 
image on a famous piece of pottery the “Presentation Ceremony,” 
theorizing that the individuals depicted were priests beheading 
captives and drinking their blood from the cups in their hands.
• 
Scholars have determined that the rituals depicted on the pottery 
were actually practiced on top of the pyramids at Sipán and  
other locations.
• 
On the lower register of the Presentation Ceremony pot, we see 
captives being led by ropes and beheaded with Tumi knives. On the 
upper register are four smaller figures in the same ceremonial garb 
as that found in the Moche royal tombs.
o	 Donnan has definitively tied, through costume elements and 
ritual objects, the four characters depicted on the pot to four 
bodies found in the Moche tombs.
o	 The figures appear to be in the process of drinking from 
ritual chalices. One of them holds the cup aloft and seems to  
be chanting. 
o	 Donnan and Alva agreed that the figures on the top register are 
drinking the blood of the captives on the bottom register. It is 
now widely accepted that this ritual was indeed practiced by 
the Moche royalty at the pyramids.
• 
Sacrifice was indeed a significant part of Moche life, but the 
Presentation Ceremony pot may be interpreted differently. In

the next lecture, we’ll see that the figures depicted may be in a 
shamanic trance. The purpose of that trance was to make contact 
with the supernatural world and connect with the Fanged Deity.

T
his lecture presents an idea that runs contrary to more accepted 
views of the Moche: that shamanic healing played a central role 
in Moche culture and that many elements of Moche art have been 
misinterpreted in the absence of the shamanic perspective. We will first look 
at the practice of shamanism as it has existed in modern South America 
up to the present. We find many practices—trances, chanting, pilgrimages, 
even ritual sex—that also appear in ancient Moche art. This suggests that 
the widely accepted theory that the Moche royalty drank the blood of their 
enemies is perhaps wrong. Instead, the art may be seen as depicting shamans 
engaging in healing or spiritual ceremonies.
Defining Shamanism
• 
Most published studies of Moche art assert that its primary themes 
are violence, warfare, sacrifice, and recreational sex. But some 
scholars disagree with this view, seeing instead shamanism and 
healing rituals. 
• 
Shamanism is essentially the ability to contact the supernatural 
world through trance and, in the process, affect our world. 
Shamanism existed in every pre-Columbian culture of the New 
World. In fact, it exists everywhere on the planet.
• 
In South America, six elements are common to all versions  
of shamanism:
o	 All sickness is a supernatural attack from the other world. 
Evil spirits act on their own or at the request of a shaman to  
sicken people. 
o	 Shamans have the power to both heal and harm, and that power 
comes from the same place. A brujo, or a witch, can be either 
good or evil. 

75
o	 Healing is a group endeavor. Assistants and family members 
may participate in healing rituals and ceremonies.
o	 Hallucinogenic drugs are ingested to allow the shaman to make 
contact with the other world. The shaman needs to interact with 
plants that have their own living spirits. The hallucinogens 
open up their minds, allowing contact with the other world.
o	 Spirit companions, guides, or guardians are consulted and are, 
at times, convinced to do a shaman’s bidding. In some healing 
ceremonies, shamans use good spirits to fight off attacking 
evil spirits.
o	 The “other world” where shamans contact spirits and the place 
of the afterlife are the same—the place of spirits. Ancestor 
spirits reside there, as do the spirits of the natural world.
Shamanism in Modern South America
• 
A good place to start in the study of Moche shamanism is with the 
current practice of shamanism in South America, although there is 
some debate among scholars about whether or not it is appropriate 
to look at ancient practices in light of current practices. 
• 
Three important ethnographic studies were made in Moche healing 
practices in the 1900s. Each one describes healers called curanderos 
or brujos contacting the other world during what are called “mesa 
ceremonies.” These ceremonies are specifically designed to divine 
the cause of illness.
• 
These rituals are called mesa ceremonies because they take place 
at a mesa de brujo, “table of the witch.” The table or tablecloth is 
covered in ritual objects, such as statues, cups, and jars of herbs. 
The area around the table is lined with knives and swords stuck into 
the ground.

76
• 
All participants in the ceremony imbibe a drink made from the San 
Pedro cactus, which allows them to interact with the spirit world. In 
some cases, weapons are used to fight the spirits.
• 
During the ceremony, the participants sing and chant, in the same 
way that we’ve seen on the ancient Moche pottery. Music, both 
sung and played, is an important characteristic of modern rituals in 
the Amazonian, Culina, Matsigenka, and Yanamamo cultures as a 
way of communicating with or calling forth the spirits.
• 
Many of the headdresses worn by the shamans in the rituals depict 
a jaguar head at the forehead. This brings to mind the abstracted 
jaguar heads of the Paracas.
o	 The Moche people who wear this particular headdress may 
be the shaman priests who worship the Fanged Deity, either 
impersonating the Fanged Deity or becoming the vessel 
through which he manifests on earth.
o	 The Desana of the Amazon in Colombia say that the other 
world is ruled by a single deity. His name is Viho-mahse, and 
the jaguar is his representative on earth. 
A hallucinogenic brew made from the San Pedro cactus is used during the 
mesa ceremonies.

Lecture 11: The Moche—Drugs, Sex, Music, and Puppies

77
o	 Characters with jaguar headdresses have appeared in ancient 
Moche battle depictions. They are weaponless and above them 
are small floating spirits.
Pilgrimage in Ancient and Modern South America
• 
Another common element of Andean religion is the tradition of 
pilgrimage. We saw it in Chavín, in Nazca at Cahuachi, and in 
Pachacamac, which was an oracle site that was in place for centuries.
• 
In modern Nazca, the brujos climb a sacred mountain, near the 
town of Puquio, where they pray for water.
• 
In modern Moche, the brujos make a pilgrimage to the community 
of Las Huaringas near a highland lake on the border of Bolivia and 
Peru. They go there to seek wisdom from shamans and to collect 
plants for healing ceremonies.
• 
Moche pottery has a theme known as “the runners,” in which 
people are shown running up or down a hill through landscapes of 
uprooted San Pedro cactus and another plant called misha that has 
also been identified as a hallucinogenic.
o	 These runners are often depicted either in a jaguar headdress or 
in the process of transforming into jaguars themselves.
o	 They may be shamans running uphill or down to make 
pilgrimages, just as the modern Moche and Nazca people do.
Shamanism and Madness
• 
One of the common illnesses cured by modern Moche brujos is 
madness, and one of the symptoms of this madness is the tendency 
to strip naked. Some of the ethnographies of the 20th century showed 
Moche families bringing their relatives to be cured of madness. 
These crazed family members are often naked, tied for their own 
security, and dragged by ropes to the healers for mesa ceremonies.
• 
Ancient Moche art has many scenes of tied, naked people being 
led to temples, but they are always interpreted as captives being 

78
brought to be killed. In some cases, that may be true, but in other 
cases, there may be a different interpretation.
o	 One piece of art shows, on its upper register, a series of roped 
individuals being led to a temple. Though tied, these people are 
carried in kitties and surrounded by bird spirits. They appear to 
be treated much more gently than one would expect for captives.
o	 The lower register again shows the naked captives, but now, 
they are being attended by anthropomorphized birds and fed 
something from a bowl. It’s possible that these people are 
being brought to the temple for exorcism.
o	 Another pot shows a captive being fed something by a jaguar. 
Again, it appears that this person is being healed, not condemned.
o	 In other pieces, there are captives accompanied by warriors 
with weapons, but even here, the captives are walking in front 
of the warriors, not being dragged. 
• 
In modern Amazonian tribes, birds are thought of as spirit guides 
and assistants for the shamans. One wonders whether the birds in 
the Moche pottery are serving the same purpose.
Violence or Healing?
• 
The mesa ceremonies of the early 20th century were performed at 
the shaman’s house, with the perimeter of the house surrounded 
by the knives and swords used in the rituals. These ceremonies 
are now illegal in modern Moche, which has led to the ceremonies 
becoming mobile and portable—the mesa de brujo.
• 
Moche pottery shows structures much like the shaman’s houses, with 
maces and other weapons lining the structures and perimeters. Inside 
these houses are people holding cups. It has been argued that these 
are war houses and the occupants are drinking blood, but they may 
be healing houses, much like the 20th-century shaman dwellings.
Lecture 11: The Moche—Drugs, Sex, Music, and Puppies

79
• 
It is clear that there was plenty of violence in the Moche culture, 
and it’s unlikely that all instances of violence in Moche art have 
been misinterpreted. The explicit beheadings are obviously related 
to warfare and not healing, though the Decapitator Deity associated 
with this practice does seem to be the same as the Fanged Deity 
worshiped across many of the ancient cultures.
• 
Even the tradition of severed heads has a connection to shamanism. 
The stirrup vessels of the Moche bear a resemblance to the strung 
severed heads that were worn on a belt or hung in a house.
Shamanic Sexual Imagery in Moche Art
• 
Moche art been called the most overtly sexual imagery in the 
ancient world, even surpassing the Kama-sutra. Most scholars 
believe that it depicts recreational sex. This may be true, but the 
sexual imagery may represent another aspect of shamanism that has 
been overlooked.
• 
Contact-period accounts on the coast of Peru witness healers having 
sex with people to cure them. According to modern-day Moche, 
evil brujos will force women to have sex with them, after which the 
women become their servants.
• 
Some strange things are depicted in Moche sexual art that indicate 
that the sex act may be more ritual than recreational.
o	 The man is often transforming into a jaguar or wearing a 
jaguar headdress.
o	 The sex is often performed in a house with weapons lining the 
top. This corresponds to the shaman rituals discussed earlier.
o	 There are often people chanting in the vicinity, as well as  
bird assistants. 
o	 The types of sex acts performed are often those that would not 
lead to pregnancy.

80
o	 Often, one of the participants is wearing a hat, perhaps to 
indicate some sort of power identity to the observer.
• 
One particularly odd theme in this art is the presence of a puppy, 
either scratching at the door or actively participating in the sex act. 
The puppy is associated with the Fanged Deity, though it is not 
clear what its presence designates.
An Alternative View of the Presentation Ceremony
• 
If one looks at the Presentation Ceremony pot with South American 
shamanism in mind, the explanation of bloodthirsty warriors is not 
as logical as it first appears.
• 
Small figures are floating around the royalty, who are in the process 
of drinking. These may be the spirits with which modern Moche 
shamans interact.
• 
It may also be more logical to assume that the cups hold San Pedro 
cactus, rather than blood. Although other images on the pot depict 
decapitations, no evidence of blood-drinking has ever been found in 
Moche artifacts.
• 
Some scholars assert that the priests are in a shamanic trance, 
calling spirits down. They’re either dressed as or channeling the 
Fanged Deity and his bird assistants are helping.
• 
It may be that the bodies found in the Moche tombs in Sipán were 
not royalty at all but shamans.

Lecture 12: Enigmatic Tiwanaku by Lake Titicaca
Enigmatic Tiwanaku by Lake Titicaca
Lecture 12
T
his lecture explores a site so impressive that it has spawned theories 
of supernatural involvement: Tiwanaku in the Lake Titicaca region. 
Tiwanaku is notable for its enormous megalithic structures, built and 
embellished with such precision that modern archaeology still cannot explain 
them. The area around Lake Titicaca was home to the Yaya-Mama culture, 
whose central settlement at Pukara shows many similarities with Chavín. The 
Kalasasaya courtyard at Tiwanaku also appears to share some themes with 
Chavín, though it is clear that the culture here was unique in many ways. 
One of its most impressive achievements was raised-field agriculture, which 
allowed for the development of a large, economically diverse population.
Lake Titicaca and Tiwanaku
• 
The region of Lake Titicaca and the lands surrounding it, referred to 
collectively as the altiplanos, “high plains,” was where one of South 
America’s most impressive cultures built its capital, Tiwanaku.
• 
The Inca referred to Lake Titicaca as their origin place, and an 
abandoned city on the south end of the lake fits into the Inca pre-
origin mythology almost perfectly. Its uniquely sophisticated 
architecture and huge sculptures have inspired claims of great 
antiquity, advanced technology, and even theories of alien contact.
• 
Lake Titicaca itself is an ecological wonder. At 12,500 feet above 
sea level, it spans the borders of Peru and Bolivia. It is the highest 
navigable lake in the world. There are a number of islands in the 
lake, but two of these, the islands of the sun and the moon, play 
heavily into Inca culture.
• 
Though the lake was once abundant with native fish, the 
introduction of trout and overfishing have largely depleted any wild 
fish. The lake is still home to large numbers of farmed fish.

83
• 
Jacques Cousteau dove the lake in 1973 to determine whether he 
could find submerged Inca ruins. He did not find the ruins, but he 
did find a previously unknown species of giant frog.
• 
Perhaps the most famous visitor to the lake in modern times was 
Thor Heyerdahl, the man who proved that a small boat could sail 
from South America into Oceania—that early man could have 
reached the Americas by sea.
The Birth of the Yaya-Mama Culture
• 
Around 800 B.C., people began to settle in larger communities 
around the lake. At about 200 B.C., there was a shared pattern in 
the region—similar architecture, similar ceramics, and a shared 
practice of erecting stone monoliths.
• 
The term for this culture became Yaya-Mama (“Father-Mother”), 
based on some of the monuments that appear to have male and 
female sides.
• 
The Yaya-Mama culture developed on the north end of the lake, and 
a site called Pukara became its largest center. Archaeologists from 
the region are careful to assert that developments in this area have 
nothing to do with cultural developments taking place in the north 
at Chavín at the same time, but there may be connections.
• 
Archaeologist Sergio Chavez notes four characteristic traits that 
separate the Yaya-Mama culture from other Andean cultures, but in 
each case, similarities can be found with Chavín and other cultures.
o	 The Yaya-Mama sites have rectangular sunken courts, much 
like the New Temple at Chavín de Huántar.
o	 Stone monoliths stand in the city centers. Although this was 
certainly unusual around Lake Titicaca, Chavín had its share of 
standing stones, including the Tello Obelisk.
o	 Ritual paraphernalia have been found in these sites, including a 
statuette of a figure with a severed head and axe, feline images 

84
in pottery, and offering caches of smashed pots and food. There 
are also dismembered bodies and skulls found in these caches 
in Pukara. These artifacts are similar to the ritual offerings 
found at Chavín and Nazca.
o	 There are unique themes and symbols present in Yaya-Mama 
iconography. But there are also jaguars, severed heads, snakes 
emerging from heads and waists, and we find some images 
with headdresses that have jaguars on them.
The Mystery of Tiwanaku
• 
Tiwanaku grew from a small village in the B.C. period to  
a massive urban city, with upwards of 40,000 people in the city 
itself and as many as half a million people in the valley as a  
whole. This growth was possible through the development of 
raised-field agriculture.
• 
This site is so magnificent that it inspires many questions. More 
than any other site, people try to connect Tiwanaku to the hands 
of aliens; the structures are so advanced that people struggle for 
explanations of how this construction was possible in such an 
isolated area.
• 
The site is also consistently thought to be much older than 
archaeolgy points to; some people say it is 15,000 years old.
• 
Tiwanaku is located on the wide, flat floor of the Tiwanaku Valley. 
The land is mainly grass and clay with hardly any trees. In fact, 
the Aymara culture that has developed there has a dislike and 
fear of trees, as opposed to their Amazonian counterparts, who  
worship trees.
• 
Tiwanaku is the highest ancient capital in the world. Its 
location makes it oddly protected from earthquakes, giving 
it a natural advantage over other settlements in the area. 
Lecture 12: Enigmatic Tiwanaku by Lake Titicaca

85
The Kalasasaya
• 
The Kalasasaya, with its sunken court in the middle, is one of the 
most frequently depicted parts of Tiwanaku. It was the first major 
construction that we know of at the site.
• 
Archaeolgists believe that it was probably started around 300 A.D., 
and it was built of hard ashlar blocks that came from at least 20 
kilometers away.
• 
The Kalasasaya itself is 120 meters on one side by 130 meters on 
another—just barely off square. However, this may have been the 
result of some horrible reconstruction that occurred before the 1960s.
• 
Early photos of the site show single standing monoliths leading up 
to an eastern gate. For unknown reasons, later reconstructionists 
filled the space between those monoliths with stone walls.
• 
The overall dimensions of the Kalasasaya remain intact. The 
orientation, with its astrological alignments, is also intact; its 
Like those at Chavín, the stone walls at Kalasasaya incorporate tenon heads.

86
corners mark the points of the summer and winter solstices, and the 
middle point marks the equinox.
Connections with Chavín de Huántar
• 
In the middle of the Kalasasaya is an important monument called the 
Ponce Monolith. It is the biggest monolith in all of South America, 
and it shares much of its imagery with the Patio Stone at Chavín.
• 
The sunken rectangular courtyard also bears a striking resemblance 
to Chavín. All along the interior walls are the same type of tenon 
heads that are seen at the courtyard at Chavín. Some archaeologists 
believe that these heads represent the valley’s lineage leaders, 
but they may represent, as we’ve seen before, various stages  
of transformation.
• 
The Sun Gate is the most compelling Chavín imagery connection at 
the site. It was moved to stand on one corner of the Kalasasaya, and 
above the doorway is a standing figure that some say is the sun god. 
o	 When you look closely at the “rays of sun” emanating from 
him, however, you can see that they much more closely 
represent the snakes we’ve seen previously on the Raimondi 
Stone at Chavín. 
o	 The winged figures around him bring to mind the bird imagery 
at the New Temple and on Moche pottery.
o	 The Sun Gate was actually moved to the Kalasasaya from the 
nearby site of Puma Punku.
• 
To be clear, Tiwanaku is not a carbon copy of Chavín. Tiwanaku 
clearly had a unique culture of its own, but the connections to 
Chavín are worth acknowledgment.
The Site of Puma Punku
• 
Puma Punku is well known for its large-scale megalithic 
construction. It has been identified as an elite residential complex.
Lecture 12: Enigmatic Tiwanaku by Lake Titicaca

87
• 
The stones in the architecture are not just perfectly fitted, but there 
is evidence that metal clasps held the stones together, keeping them 
very tight.
• 
Within the excavations at Puma Punku, rich ceramics and frequent 
evidence of feasting have been found. Feasting clearly played an 
important role in this settlement.
• 
The Andean Cross symbol is also carved into the stones all around 
Puma Punku. The Andean Cross has now become a symbol for the 
Quechua and Inca culture in general, but it actually comes from the 
Tiwanaku area.
• 
There are clear signs of economic diversity at Tiwanaku. These elite 
complexes, such as Puma Punku, are counterbalanced by small, 
simple houses all around the site.
Raised-Field Agriculture
• 
Raised fields are essentially parallel deep ditches with raised 
earthen mounds between them on which crops were sown.
• 
The mounds absorb heat during the day and emit it at night, 
mitigating the temperature extremes of the climate.
• 
The ditches were dug so deeply that the water within them 
sustained edible fish life. The fish enriched the water and the soil 
beneath the ditches, allowing the mounds to be replenished with 
nutrients seasonally.
• 
It is possible that these people used the same sort of technical 
knowledge that allowed for raised-field farming to manipulate Lake 
Titicaca from one enormous lake into two smaller ones connected 
by a narrow channel, though this has not been proven.
The Akapana Pyramid
• 
The Akapana Pyramid is the central and largest building at 
Tiwanaku. It was built late, probably about 500 A.D. It stands 35 

88
meters tall and had seven tiers of terraces, though they have largely 
been destroyed by looting.
• 
In 1549, Cieza de León wrote that the top plaza of the Akapana 
Pyramid had a sunken court that was not rectangular but in the 
Andean Cross shape.
• 
The sunken plaza is lined with large stone monoliths, some of them 
weighing 10 tons. A few of these monoliths are magnetized, but it is 
unclear whether this was significant in any way.
• 
Underneath the platform, caches were found containing  
severed heads.
• 
When Akapana was built, there was a population boom in and 
around the city, most likely a result of the development of raised-
field agriculture.

    Questions to Consider

The Amazon—Civilization Lost in the Jungle
Lecture 13
I
n this lecture, we learn about the recent and surprising discoveries that 
point to an Amazonian civilization much larger and much older than 
previously assumed. Because the Amazonian people built with perishable 
materials, the great stone artifacts found in other cultures are not found 
here. Instead, studies in landscape archaeology have revealed an extensive 
network of earthworks—mounds, causeways, fishing weirs, and even ringed 
ditches surrounding what were once moated cities. These finds suggest that 
a thriving civilization of between 10 and 20 million people flourished here, 
and the dating of pottery at early settlements indicates that this culture may 
in fact be the cradle of South American civilization.
Surprising New Knowledge
• 
Right now is an exciting and surprising time in Amazon studies. 
Things said not to exist are being found and things said to be 
impossible now seem quite plausible.
• 
The traditional view of the Amazon has been that it could not 
support large-scale civilization, only small-scale, seminomadic 
ways of life. But over the last decades, overwhelming evidence has 
surfaced proving the existence of mass ancient populations.
• 
Spanish contact chronicles told tales of dense populations, white 
shining cities, fortified towns, and extensive roads. These tales were 
once thought to be lies but are now being confirmed by archaeology.
• 
Flyovers by petroleum engineers first brought to light manmade 
mounds and causeways in the area. These were later verified by 
archaeologists.
 

90
Lecture 13: The Amazon—Civilization Lost in the Jungle
Landscape Archaeology Discoveries
• 
The first formal landscape survey was performed by Clark Erickson 
during the 1990s in the area of the Beni. Instead of trying to 
investigate the area through standard excavation, he employed 
landscape archaeology, a technique that enabled him to look at the 
bigger picture of human impact over the landscape.
• 
Through landscape archaeology methods, Erickson found raised-
field agriculture, zigzagging walls, major and minor mounds 
connected by major and minor causeways, and a number of canals 
that boats could travel on.
• 
Some of the settlements Erickson located were arranged in a radial 
pattern with large mounds in the middle and causeways radiating 
out to smaller mounds.
• 
He also found anthropogenic soil and ring ditches.
Raised-Field Agriculture
• 
Raised-field agriculture was practiced in the Beni region just 
as it was practiced at Tiwanaku, though it served as a particular 
advantage for the people of the Beni.
• 
The Beni is located in a savannah that is seasonally inundated. The 
raised mounds prevent the crops from flooding while capturing the 
water in the ditches.
• 
The use of this technique by two cultures active at the same time 
in a relatively close area suggests that there may have been a 
connection between them.
Zigzag Walls
• 
Zigzag walls were found near the mounds. In some places, they 
extend off the mounds 3 or 4 kilometers. They are paralleled by 
3-meter-wide channels that feed into small ponds.

91
• 
Erickson decided that these were probably fishing weirs, likely 
designed to trap fish and shellfish. As water began to flow in during 
the rainy season, the shells and small fish were caught in the nooks 
of the zigzag and could be easily retrieved.
• 
It appears as if the entire landscape became a giant fish farm during 
the rainy season.
Mounds, Causeways, and Canals
• 
Across the Beni, there are small and large groups of mounds made 
up of organic material, pieces of pottery, and other trash items. 
They seem to have been slowly built up over hundreds of years.
• 
One of these sites is called Ibataté. It has two large mounds 
connected by raised causeways. One of those mounds is 18 meters 
tall and shows evidence of wattle-and-daub houses sitting on top of 
it. In total, 500 to 1,000 inhabitants appear to have lived on those 
two mounds alone.
• 
The causeways number in the thousands. Major causeways were 
more than 7 kilometers long and very straight.
In the 1990s, archaeologists discovered that hundreds of square miles of the 
Beni region had been altered by human hands, in some areas as early as 800 A.D.

92
Lecture 13: The Amazon—Civilization Lost in the Jungle
• 
Erickson noticed minor causeways leading from the smaller mounds 
to the larger ones. He theorized that these were probably made 
by natural patterns of travel between loose social communities, 
perhaps extended families. Early north coast Peru had the same sort 
of independent but connected patterns.
• 
Running along the sides of these causeways were wide, deep canals, 
large enough for canoe travel and to hold fish. They were probably 
dug out as the large causeways were made.
• 
The Jesuits who served as missionaries in the area mentioned that 
they were irritated that these wonderful canals and causeways were 
often used by the locals to go to various parties.
Radial Settlements and Ring Ditches
• 
The Beni site has large mounds called “forest islands.” They are the 
epicenters of large causeways with smaller mounds connected by 
smaller causeways in a radial pattern. 
• 
These were probably chiefdoms, with populations radiating out from 
centers and one community connected to another by longer causeways.
• 
The counterparts to these mounds are “ring ditches,” which are 
essentially circular patterns dug into the earth. Seventeenth-century 
Jesuits reported that these were used as moats, with palisaded towns 
on the outside and the city protected within.
Anthropogenic Soil
• 
Some archaeologists, including Betty Meggers of the Smithsonian, 
do not believe that the Amazonian soil could support the intensive 
agriculture necessary to sustain large populations.
• 
Erickson and others have countered by saying that the soil in the 
Amazon is almost completely anthropogenic, that is, completely 
altered by humans. Thousands of years of human habitation has 
enriched the soil.

93
• 
In Erickson’s opinion, Meggers and others are underestimating 
human persistence and the abilities of a group of organized people 
to change the landscape.
Landscape Archaeology in Other Areas
• 
Hundreds of kilometers to the east of the Beni is the Xingu River 
basin in Brazil. Ring ditches, also called geoglyphs, have been 
found there by the thousands, as well as causeways and roads. 
The Xingu geoglyphs are clearly the same kind of palisaded 
communities as seen in Bolivia.
• 
Similar mounds, geoglyphs, causeways, and raised fields have also 
been found in Guyana, on the northern edge of the Amazon basin. 
The evidence spreads into Colombia and Venezuela, as well. These 
sites date anywhere from 200 to 1300 A.D.
• 
In the jungles around Iquitos in Peru’s Amazon, archaeologists have 
used the same idea of anthropogenic soils to look at the land. Once 
again, they have found wide areas of black, rich soil and within that 
soil, many pottery fragments. It is clear that this soil was enriched 
by humans.
Majaró Island
• 
On the mouth of the Amazon in Brazil is a series of islands, the 
largest of which is called Majaró Island. This island has a section 
of large mounds, some of them 20 meters tall. These were first 
discovered by Betty Meggers in the 1940s, but she dismissed them 
as the work of a short-lived community.
• 
Archaeologists led by Ann Roosevelt returned in the 1980s and 
found evidence of a long-term community on the island, dating 
from circa 300 A.D. all the way up to the point of Spanish contact.
• 
Extensive mounds and elaborate pottery have been found, though 
there is no evidence of intensive farming. This is most likely 
because the population lived primarily on fish.

94
Ancient Origins in the Amazon
• 
Today, scholars estimate that the population on the other side of the 
Andes when Pizarro landed was between 10 and 20 million people. 
This is a much larger population than previously thought, and it 
turns out to be much older, as well.
• 
In a place called Caverna da Pedra Pintada in Brazil, Anna Roosevelt 
found evidence of civilization in the form of buried pottery, dating 
to circa 6000 B.C. This was much older than other fragments found 
in the area; in fact, it was older than any other pottery found in the 
Americas in general. Roosevelt’s find was confirmed by pottery 
finds of the same age in six other caves in the area.
• 
South America’s next-oldest pottery comes from Guyana in the 
Amazon basin, from about 4000 B.C. The use of pottery seems to 
slowly spread to the west, to Colombia and Ecuador, reaching the 
coast about 2500 B.C. Pottery does not appear on even Peru’s coast 
until 1800 B.C. The oldest pottery in North America dates only to 
about 2000 B.C.
• 
Below the pottery at Pedra Pintada was a sterile layer of soil, and 
beneath that layer was a hunter-gatherer layer dating to 9200 B.C. 
This evidence rocks our understanding of New World migration 
patterns. It does not correspond to the Clovis point marked as the 
origin of human migration from north to south.
Difficulties in Amazonian Archaeology
• 
Why were we unaware of the age and breadth of ancient Amazonian 
civilization until recently? One reason is that South American 
archaeology was focused west of the Andes until after the 1950s.
• 
Additionally, it is both difficult and expensive to launch a project 
into such places as the Amazon, where there are no big cities to 
resupply expeditions.
Lecture 13: The Amazon—Civilization Lost in the Jungle

95
• 
It takes a rare archaeologist to invest the amount of time necessary 
to work in isolated wilderness surroundings. Erickson had what it 
takes, but not all archaeologists do.
• 
One stumbling block has been the preconceived notion that 
civilization is characterized by stone architecture. This notion is 
unfair to many civilizations around the world. It makes no sense 
that Amazonian civilization would have traveled far out of its way 
to acquire building materials that would have served no purpose in 
that environment.
The Amazon as the Cradle of South American Civilization
• 
For a long time, archaeologists assumed that Andean civilization 
predated Amazonian civilization and that the Amazon adapted 
technologies and cultures from the Andes. It now appears that the 
opposite may be true—that South American civilization originated 
in the Amazon and was adapted in the Andes.
• 
This idea makes sense when we consider other cradles of 
civilization. Egyptian civilization emerged along the Nile; 
Mesopotamian civilization emerged along the Tigris and Euphrates, 
and the great civilizations of India grew up around the Ganges. 
Nearly all early civilizations emerged at the largest rivers in their 
respective regions.
• 
As we learn more about the ancient Amazon, we may find that 
this civilization is also the origin of the famous Fanged Deity that 
appears across the continent.

97
The Wari—Foundations of the Inca Empire?
Lecture 14
I
n this lecture, we learn about an important precursor to the Inca 
civilization: the Wari culture of the Ayacucho Valley. The Wari culture 
most likely developed in 500 A.D. out of the smaller Huarpa culture 
that inhabited the valley from about 200 B.C. The Wari distinguished 
themselves through their extensive road systems; their heavy reliance on 
camelid herding for food, wool, and labor; and their sophisticated method 
of agricultural terracing. The terraces not only allowed them to adapt the 
highland for maximum agricultural production but also made them better 
able to withstand the droughts that weakened nearby cultures. Though the 
Wari culture eventually declined around 1000 A.D., many of its advances 
were used as a foundation for the mighty Inca civilization that followed. 
Who Were the Wari?
• 
The Wari started in the central Andes perhaps as early as 500 A.D. 
and faded away by about 1100 A.D. They were contemporaries of, 
and interacted with, the Tiwanaku, the Moche, and the Nazca. 
• 
They had a clear capital city in the Ayacucho Valley called Wari 
(earlier spelled “Huari”).
• 
The Wari did things differently than their contemporaries. They 
built walled cities, had stone-paved roads, and most importantly, 
developed agricultural terraces.
• 
The Wari most likely developed from the Huarpa culture that 
inhabited the Ayacucho Valley from as early as 200 B.C. until the 
appearance of the Wari in 500 A.D. 
o	 The Huarpa had a small city capital supported by a few 
satellite villages. They farmed on very simple terraces, perhaps 
prototypes of the Wari terraces but on a much smaller scale.

98
Lecture 14: The Wari—Foundations of the Inca Empire?
o	 How the Huarpa culture disappeared is still under investigation. It 
may have simply been transformed into the emergent Wari culture.
The City of Wari
• 
The capital city of the Wari was very different from the capital city 
of the Huarpa. It was large, was surrounded by clearly defensible 
thick walls, and was built on a hilltop location.
• 
The city was set up in a strict grid pattern, with all streets at right angles. 
There were sections of wide plaza that were probably ceremonial.
• 
Individual rooms were discovered, some in multistory buildings, 
with wear patterns that suggest that they were residences. These 
residences were surrounded by many workshops, indicating that the 
city had a diverse population of agricultural workers and artisans.
• 
The city was very large, with an area of 3 to 4 kilometers and a 
population of approximately 10,000. 
• 
Multigenerational tombs were found throughout the city and even in 
residences. Shrines were made within rooms of houses specifically 
for keeping mummies among the living. This suggests the same 
type of ancestral mummy worship that would later become the 
heart of spiritual culture for the Inca. 
• 
Art specimens found in the city indicate that the Wari worshiped 
the same Fanged Deity that we have seen in other Andean cultures.
Wari Road Systems
• 
Although the city of Wari is impressive, it is really the achievements 
of the Wari outside the city that set this culture apart, especially the 
extensive road system.
• 
Wide, formally built roads extended from the Ayacucho Valley, 
sometimes for hundreds of kilometers. These roads led directly to 
what we understand as Wari outposts.

99
• 
The Inca built over many of the Wari roads, making it difficult to 
distinguish roads that are specifically Wari.
• 
Given that the Wari did not use the wheel, it is most likely that these 
roads were used for moving large herds of camelids safely across 
the terrain. 
o	 There are four types of Andean camelids: llama, alpaca, vicuña, 
and huanaco. Llama and alpaca were domesticated and were 
important sources of food, fiber, and labor. Vicuña and huanaco 
were never domesticated and were hunted, the vicuña for meat 
and wool and the huanaco for meat alone.
o	 Llama and alpaca herding was clearly important to the Wari. 
Both the capital and the outposts had gigantic pens for the herds 
that were attached directly to the city, just outside the walls. 
These pens had the capacity to contain thousands of animals.
Agricultural Terraces
• 
The invention by the Wari of extensive agricultural terraces changed 
the Andean world, allowing the adaptation of the highlands to farming.
• 
There were terraces all around the settlements, as well as large 
terrace systems in remote areas far removed from the city. These 
appear to have been state-run farms, much like the Inca would set 
up later.
• 
The terraces were built to act as renewable garden beds. They were 
filled with drainage materials and topped with organic matter that 
could be replaced as the nutrients were exhausted.
• 
The crops planted in these terraces were mainly corn and potatoes. 
Corn was planted in abundance, but it was really the potato that 
took hold during Wari time.
o	 The potato originated in the Andes and has since become a 
staple throughout the world.

100
o	 Wild potatoes have been found as far back as the Monte Verde 
site 4,900 years ago. Eventually, they became domesticated 
and mass-produced, changing the fabric of the Andean diet and 
way of life.
o	 The Andean practice of maintaining diversity in the potato 
species has protected Andean cultures from the type of famine 
that occurred in Ireland in the 19th century and has made the 
potato an instrumental resource in fighting hunger in the region.
Wari Expansion
• 
About 650 A.D, the Wari way of life expanded into far-reaching 
locations in the Andes. Was this the result of territorial dominance 
or merely influence?
• 
Two Wari outposts have been identified as specifically administrative in 
purpose: Pikillacta in south Cuzco and Viracochapampa far to the north.
o	 Both of these cities are nearly carbon copies of the capital city 
of Wari. There are roads leading to them, though these have 
been obscured by the Inca road system.
o	 Although Pikillacta and Viracochapampa are set up nearly 
identically to Wari, with residences, plazas, and camelid pens, 
there is little evidence of domestic activity there.
• 
We find evidence of Wari expansion and influence in ceramics. The 
kero jar, a Wari vessel used for drinking beer, was used in Tiwanaku 
and eventually spread throughout the Andes.
• 
The famous shrine of Pachacamac, at the southern border of the 
powerful Moche, was one of many cities absorbed by the Wari. 
They kept it as an oracle and did little to change its architecture.
• 
Just as the Wari were expanding, around 700 A.D., the Nazca 
withered, and the Wari were probably the reason for that. Skull 
caches found in the city of Wari bear the telltale signs of deformation 
from the Nazca culture.
Lecture 14: The Wari—Foundations of the Inca Empire?

101
• 
At the end of the Lima culture, Lima architecture shows signs 
of having been influenced, perhaps designed, by the Wari. Gaps 
between the bricks in Lima platforms served an antiseismic 
purpose, a measure most likely introduced by the Wari, who lived 
in an earthquake-prone area.
State or Sphere of Influence?
• 
The Inca were clearly a state, imposing their way of life on the 
communities they took over and changing the architecture within 
those cities. But at the Wari-influenced sites, we do not really see 
that sort of imposition of culture.
• 
The administrative outposts of the Wari were new constructions, 
and the people inhabiting the sites they took over were not made to 
change their architecture or life ways.
• 
For this reason, it appears that the expansion of the Wari culture 
falls into the category of an expansion of a sphere of influence, 
rather than the conscious effort of a state to impose its will and 
dominance on others.
Pikillacta is almost a carbon copy of Wari, but there is little evidence of 
domestic use there.

102
Connection between the Wari and the Tiwanaku
• 
Older archaeolgy books identify objects at some sites as “Tiwanaku-
Wari culture.” Indeed, some of the ceramic styles are similar, and 
there was overlap in time periods and geography. But the ways of 
life of these two people were very different.
• 
This distinction is clear at the border between the Tiwanaku and 
Wari regions in the Moquegua Valley. Both cultures had settlements 
in that valley, and these settlements show obvious differences, 
especially in farming strategies.
o	 Tiwanaku villages were set up in the lower parts of the valley. 
The farmers there created river-fed irrigation systems to 
provide water for raised-field agriculture, just as they did in 
the capital.
o	 The Wari settled higher up and built terraces in the hillsides. 
They diverted water from the upper parts of the same river the 
Tiwanaku people used.
o	 This obviously led to a situation of water competition 
between the two cultures, though there is little evidence that 
it led to fighting.
• 
When droughts came in 1000 A.D., the Tiwanaku sites shrank 
in size and were eventually abandoned. This may have been a 
symptom of the fall of Tiwanaku itself around 1000 A.D., but it is 
also a demonstration of the superiority of terrace agriculture.
The Decline of the Wari
• 
The Wari capital was also in decline around 1000 A.D. The outposts 
were abandoned earlier, probably around 900 A.D. 
• 
By 1100 A.D., or perhaps before, the capital city of Wari had been 
abandoned entirely.
• 
The end of Wari civilization in the highlands ushered in another 
age of hiatus, much like we saw between the Chavín and Moche 
Lecture 14: The Wari—Foundations of the Inca Empire?

103
cultures. For a period of around 200 years, the highland culture 
consisted of small villages and simple farm terracing communities, 
with no clear overarching leadership or theocratic control.
Wari Influence on the Inca
• 
There are several characteristics of the Wari culture that most likely 
were used by the Inca as a foundation for their own culture.
• 
Roads with tambos (rest and storage houses) connecting far-
reaching outposts were perfected by the Inca but originated with 
the Wari.
• 
The Wari used state-run terrace agriculture in remote areas, 
administered through the Wari capital. The Inca would use the same 
technique in their empire.
• 
The rectilinear, grid-like urban design used by the Wari can also be 
seen in Inca cities.
• 
Government-controlled herding was an important element of 
control exerted by the Inca across their territories. This practice 
appears to have started with the Wari.
• 
The Inca were famous for expanding their territory in search of 
new resources. The Wari expansion likely occurred for this reason, 
as well. Viracochapampa especially was in one of the breadbasket 
areas of the Andes and was most likely built to provide access to 
those resources. 
• 
Perhaps the most important influence of the Wari on the Inca is 
ancestral mummy veneration and the housing of mummies within 
living spaces. Mummies were venerated in earlier cultures, but 
the Wari were the first culture to put them aboveground in the 
living spaces. This would become an important hallmark of Inca 
civilization, as well.

Lecture 14: The Wari—Foundations of the Inca Empire?

105
The Chimú—Empire of the Northern Coast 
Lecture 15
T
his lecture focuses on the first of two civilizations that arrived 
simultaneously along the northern coast as the Moche culture came to 
an end: the Kingdom of Chimor. The leaders of this kingdom arrived 
by boat and set up an empire that persisted for 700 years. The Chimú are 
famous for their ciudadelas, citadels built to house royal families. The capital 
of Chan Chan had nine of these citadels, as well as an extensive settlement 
of farmers and fishermen. A unique sunken-field method of agriculture 
and massive irrigation channels allowed the empire to thrive until an El 
Niño destroyed the system in 1000 A.D. The Chimú enjoyed a successful 
resurgence as conquerors until the Inca conquered them in 1470 A.D. 
New Kingdoms on the Coast
• 
Two major culture groups living along the northern coast were 
conquered by the Inca only decades before the arrival of the 
Spanish. They were the Kingdom of Chimor and the Sican culture 
of the Lambayeque Valley.
• 
These two new culture groups came to dominate Peru’s northern 
coast as the Moche culture faded around 800 A.D. They persisted 
for almost 700 years, until the Inca finally conquered the Chimú 
in 1470 A.D.
• 
According to Spanish chroniclers, both kingdoms began with 
strangers arriving by totora reed boats from far away with great 
leaders who were destined to rule. In Lambayeque, the leader was a 
character named Naymlap. In the Moche Valley, it was Taycanamu.
• 
For 500 years, the Sican people were independent. But in 1375 
A.D., the Chimú overtook them by force.

106
Lecture 15: The Chimú—Empire of the Northern Coast 
The Kingdom of Chimor
• 
The term “Chimú” is actually the title of the king and used as a 
name for the culture. The culture itself is called Chimor. The capital 
city of the Chimor Empire was Chan Chan.
• 
Taycanamu is said to have established Chan Chan as his capital, and 
his sons were sent out to establish more outposts in the Moche Valley.
• 
Archaeology finds the first evidence of the Chimú in the Moche 
Valley not with the new construction at Chan Chan but as a 
takeover of the late Moche city of Galindo. The Chimú people built 
their first ciudadela over Galindo around 900 A.D. A ciudadela is 
an enclosed compound.
• 
The giant city of Chan Chan was more than 6 square kilometers, with 
dense settlements. There were probably more than 30,000 people 
living there at its height. It was one of the largest cities that South 
America ever saw, and interestingly, it was right on the coastline.
The Architecture of Chan Chan
• 
Chan Chan had 9 to 11 ciudadelas or citadels. Each one was 
surrounded by a massive wall complex.
• 
The walls outside of the ciudadelas are more than 10 meters tall and 
3 meters wide at the base. They taper to about 1 meter at the top, 
probably to make them more structurally sound during an earthquake.
• 
All of the ciudadelas are oriented to the north and have only one 
opening, also to the north. However, to establish that astrology played 
a role in the constructions at Chan Chan, we would have to look at 
them as a group and do a detailed analysis of their positioning.
• 
The ciudadelas were most likely the palaces of the 9 to 11 rulers of 
the Chimú chronicled by the Spanish. The palaces of previous rulers 
were kept as shrines and as homes for the rulers’ extended families.

107
Inside the Ciudadelas
• 
Each ciudadela was almost a city unto itself, with living quarters 
for hundreds of people. Labyrinths of passageways led from one 
section to the next. There were workshops, mostly for precious 
metals, and large, open courtyards where public ceremonies were 
probably held.
• 
Inside the compounds was at least one, if not two, large platform 
mounds. These were characteristically u-shaped structures, as seen 
in the Moche culture.
• 
There were storage areas within the mounds and garden plots 
throughout the compounds. They seemed to be set up to be self-
sufficient for long periods of time if necessary.
• 
The ciudadelas also included sunken wells that allowed access to 
the high water table along the coast. The wells were wide, circular 
constructions with walk-in ramps for access, much like Nazca 
constructions. It is possible that the Chimú arrived by sea from the 
south, bringing Nazca ideas with them.
Audiencias: Signature Chimú Architecture
• 
Each ciudadela also contained many small u-shaped structures 
called audiencias. In Chan Chan alone, there are 178 of these 
audiencias. They are also found in all outposts of the Chimú culture 
along the coast.
• 
The audiencias vary in form and size, but generally, they are about 
4 by 6 meters wide. Along the interior walls are typically about 
six niches. Some of audiencias show evidence of wall paintings 
depicting lords sitting inside u-shaped structures on thrones.
• 
Chronicles record that Chimú lords held court in these audiencias. A 
lord would entertain guests there and probably receive tribute, storing 
it in the small rooms along the sides and back of the audiencias.

108
• 
The audiencias have subtle differences in the kind of carved stucco 
around them, usually an icon that is repeated. Some have birds, 
some have geometrical shapes, and some have squirrels. One icon 
is a squirrel holding a pet gecko—an image at odds with the fierce 
reputation of the Chimú.
• 
The u-shaped audiencias are reminiscent of the u-shaped religious 
complexes found on the north coast from 2,000 years earlier.
Burials in Chan Chan 
• 
Each ciudadela had a single large platform mound toward the back, 
away from the northern entrance. These are assumed to be the burial 
places for the rulers who lived there. All of them, unfortunately, 
were looted in antiquity, but enough evidence remained to confirm 
that they did indeed hold tombs.
• 
Although they have been looted of all contents, the burial chambers 
remain. The central tombs were buried deeply in the center of the 
mound. The top of the mound had several graves arranged in a 
grid pattern.
• 
Archaeologists have confirmed that the ciudadelas were used in 
sequence, each abandoned as its resident ruler died.
Common Life among the Chimú
• 
Just outside of the tall walls of these ciudadelas stand dense clusters 
of small compounds. These were places where mostly craftsman, 
artisans, and traders lived. They were adobe brick structures, 
housing perhaps 30 to 50 people.
• 
There were neighborhood cemeteries with rich burial goods. This 
shows that the people outside of the palaces got the chance to enjoy 
modest wealth and independence.
• 
Every compound had workshops, but metallurgy was the most 
common occupation of the city. Beautiful works were created from 
Lecture 15: The Chimú—Empire of the Northern Coast 

109
gold, silver, and tumbaga, which is a gold/copper combination. 
Both pounded-metal cups and masks have been found.
• 
Public art in Chan Chan is limited to rather abstract designs on the 
ciudadela walls. Artisan wares are our best hints at Chimú religion. 
According to chronicles, the Chimú worshiped the moon, but 
archaeology does not confirm that. 
o	 The most common image found in the art is a face with 
teardrop-shaped eyes. The Sican culture also portrays faces 
with teardrop eyes. 
o	 When these faces smile, they have fangs. They could be 
representations of another version of the Fanged Deity.
• 
Another ritual object found in Chan Chan is an abundance of 
spondylus shells. These shells are not normally found in the waters 
near Chan Chan; they were either imported en masse from the coast 
of Ecuador or were collected when an El Niño brought the warmer 
water closer.
The icons in the friezes at Chan Chan reveal subtle differences; some are birds 
or other animals, and some are geometrical shapes.

Chimú Agriculture
• 
On the outer edges of the city was a different kind of settlement 
of simple stick-and-grass houses or, perhaps, wattle and daub. The 
occupants of these huts were most likely the fishermen and farmers 
who supplied the artisans of the city with food.
• 
To the west and north of the city were the agricultural fields. 
Because they were so close to the coast, the Chimú developed a 
unique farming technique known as the sunken-field method. In 
this method, the farmers dug down through the sand to find the 
fertile soil underneath.
• 
The sunken locations made the fields easier to water and allowed 
them to retain water more efficiently. This method of farming is still 
in use in nearby rural areas.
• 
To water their sunken fields so close to the sea, the Chimú built 
longer and bigger irrigation channels than anyone had before.
o	 For the first time in the history of the Peru coast, there were 
inter-valley channels. They were dug from long distances 
and connected some of the drier valleys with water from 
neighboring valleys that had more water.
o	 In 1100 A.D., a terrible El Niño cycle ripped through the north 
coast, completely destroying the Chimú and all their irrigation 
canals. The channels were rebuilt, but they weren’t as effective 
because the course of the Moche River had changed. One 
attempt to rebuild was thwarted by a fault line.
The Chimú: Conquerors and Conquered
• 
It seems that these environmental failures and catastrophes were 
what led the Chimú to become conquerors. By 1200 A.D., they 
began taking what they needed from other valleys, both from the 
north and the south.
Lecture 15: The Chimú—Empire of the Northern Coast 

111
• 
Chronicles recount that a Chimú general named Pacatnamu went 
north, conquering the valley of Jequetepeque and establishing an 
administrative center for tribute collection.
• 
The Chimú conquered the Sican lands in 1375 A.D., transforming 
Chimor into the second largest empire in all of South American history.
• 
But the Chimú did not hold that title for long. Soon after the 
conquest of the Sican culture, the Inca began assaults on Chimor 
and staged a brutal takeover by 1470 A.D.
• 
According to Spanish chronicles, the last Chimú king, 
Minchancaman, was brought to Cuzco, the Inca capital, along with 
his artisans as servants. The Inca also brought the Chimú mummies 
to Cuzco so that the people who still lived in the valley knew that 
their heart—their ancestors—had moved. 
• 
Much of the rest of Chimor’s population was exiled to work in 
camps far at the edges of the empire, never to return to their homes.

Lecture 16
T
his lecture examines the other culture that developed around 800 
A.D.: the Sican culture of the Lambayeque Valley. The Lambayeque 
Valley is a fertile area that has been home to civilizations for more 
than 4,000 years, including the great Moche culture. In many ways, the Sican 
appear to have been direct inheritors of the Moche culture; there are striking 
similarities in architecture and burial practices. The Sican distinguished 
themselves, however, in their masterful advancements in metallurgy and 
ceramics. Their work with arsenical copper and precious metal alloys helped 
to usher in a South American Bronze Age and ensured a wealth of precious 
metal artifacts that now populate museums around the world. 
The Sican in the Lambayeque Valley
• 
As the Chimú Empire was expanding, to the north, the powerful 
Sican culture was thriving in the Lambayeque Valley. The Sican 
were very different from their Chimú neighbors but not from the 
Moche, who had inhabited the same valley at an earlier time.
• 
The name “Sican” was given to this culture by archaeologist Izumi 
Shimada in 1983 during his excavations at the site of Sican. The 
culture was formerly called Lambayeque by Rafael Larco, and 
before him, Max Uhle, the German archaeolgist, had named the 
culture “Eten.”
• 
The Sican culture thrived in the fertile Lambayeque Valley for 
almost 600 years, from about 800 A.D. to 1375 A.D., when the 
Chimú arrived and absorbed them into their imperial empire.
• 
The Lambayeque Valley was the home of the Moche culture from 
about 1 A.D. to 800 A.D. and was the site of other cultures for 2,000 
years before the rise of the Moche.

Lecture 16: The Sican—Goldsmiths of the Northern Coast
• 
Most of the South American gold that fills museums is Sican gold. 
Unfortunately, most of it comes from looting.
The Birth of the Sican Kingdom
• 
According to Spanish chronicles, a ruler named Naymlap came 
to the valley from the sea with a flotilla entourage. His entourage 
was extensive, with each individual assigned a special task in the 
service of the king.
• 
Naymlap came ashore at the Lambayeque Valley and is said to have 
established a capital named Chot. His 12 grandsons established 12 
more cities in the valley.
• 
The chronicles say that the 12 cities of the Sican people were a 
loose confederation of equal cities, with none of them serving as a 
central capital. This distinguishes them from their contemporaries, 
the Chimú.
• 
The archaeology seems to support the claims of the chronicles. In 
the area of the Lambayeque Valley, at least during this time period, 
there is no clear capital city and no clear evidence of defensive 
architecture. There seems to have been autonomy among the cities.
Legends of Naymlap
• 
When Naymlap died, the chronicles say that a large idol made of 
green stone was placed at Chot. This may have been an image of 
the leader or a power object that he brought with him.
• 
According to legend, the last ruler of the Sican, Fempellec, moved 
the idol. The entire community was immediately punished with 30 
days of rain, terrible floods, and famine. The trials did not stop until 
the idol was restored to its original location.
• 
Naymlap also is said to have ordered his vassals, upon his death, 
to tell the population that he sprouted wings and flew away, then to 
bury his body in a secret location.

115
• 
Naymlap’s secret grave and green stone idol have represented a sort 
of Holy Grail for South American archaeology.
Chotuna
• 
The mysteries of Naymlap prompted Christopher Donnan to begin 
excavating a site called Chotuna in the hopes that it could be 
identified as Naymlap’s city of Chot.
• 
Chotuna dates to about 700 A.D., earlier than other Sican sites, 
making it a good candidate for the civilization’s founding city.
• 
Chotuna was destroyed in 1100 A.D. by the same El Niño that 
destroyed Chan Chan and the Chimú. Chotuna was rebuilt, unlike 
other cities, the majority of which were burned. This suggests that it 
held a place of importance to the culture.
Sican Burials and Sacrifices
• 
In 2011, a 13th-century grave of an elite woman was found in 
Chotuna. It was very Moche-like in form. Inside a large tomb 
chamber, seven people were buried, along with a llama, offerings, 
and ceramic and gold art.
• 
It is not particularly notable that the leader buried in this tomb was 
female; other female leaders were found in Moche times. The tomb 
is notable, however, because it illustrates the Sican practice of mass 
sacrifice of young women.
o	 Sican temples are full of sacrificial victims, specifically young 
women. More than 60 of these sacrificed young women have 
been found in Chotuna. Some of them were teenagers, one of 
them was pregnant, and many had their heads removed.
o	 At the site of Sican, another 300 young women were found, 
each one placed under a column on top of a tall huaca.
o	 These sacrifices do not mean that women had no value in the 
culture. On the contrary, the sacrifices show that women were 

116
highly valued, given that many cultures offer only their most 
prized possessions to the gods.
o	 Though their art does not show it much, these mass sacrifices 
reveal that the Sican people were every bit as violent as the 
Chimú or their Moche predecessors.
Batán Grande and the Moche Legacy
• 
Of all the Sican cities, one called the Batán Grande in the La Leche 
Valley is by far the largest. In design, it is very much like the giant 
Moche city of Pampa Grande, located in the same valley.
• 
Each of these sites has a cluster of platform mounds in the center 
and was surrounded by dense populations.
• 
Pampa Grande was intentionally burned in about 800 A.D., and 
construction at Batán Grande seems to have begun at about the 
same time. It is possible that Batán Grande was founded by the 
people of Pampa Grande.
• 
Batán Grande was 4 square kilometers of civic core and surrounding 
population. There were dozens of adobe brick pyramids with access 
ramps, as in the Moche cities. There were thousands of graves 
across the site, most with rich offerings of gold, silver, fine pottery, 
and textiles. Sadly, almost all of these were looted.
• 
One odd element of Batán Grande is that its graves outnumbered 
its apparent living population. Perhaps it was a pilgrimage site for 
ritual burial.
• 
When the 1100 A.D. El Niño partially destroyed it, Batán Grande 
was stacked with massive amounts of wood and intentionally 
burned to the ground, just as Pampa Grande had been.
The Sican Site
• 
The site of Sican is the namesake of the culture and the location of 
almost two decades of excavations by Izumi Shimada.
Lecture 16: The Sican—Goldsmiths of the Northern Coast

117
• 
The site was populated 
only for a short amount 
of time, from about 
900 A.D. until the 
destructive El Niño in 
1100 A.D.
• 
Though 
most 
of 
its 
pyramids 
are 
small, there are two 
larger 
pyramids 
in  
Sican: Huaca de Loro 
and Huaca Rodillona. 
Signature emblems on the brickwork of these pyramids suggest that 
communities were laying the bricks as a labor tax. Evidence of the 
same practice was found in Moche.
• 
There were many hearths in the city and evidence of much feasting 
but not many workshops or residences. This indicates it may have 
been more of a pilgrimage site than a settlement.
Unique Characteristics of Sican Art
• 
Though in many ways the Sican culture resembles the Moche culture, 
it distinguishes itself in its art, especially in metallurgy and ceramics.
• 
The Sican mined copper locally and set up entire communities 
dedicated to metal workshops. They developed a new kind of 
copper, arsenical copper, by mixing arsenical elements to make 
the metal stronger, much like the process used to make bronze. In 
fact, this practice can be seen as the beginning of a kind of South 
American Bronze Age.
• 
Great quantities of gold were produced in hearths, heated to 
high enough temperatures to melt gold. This also allowed for the 
production of gold, silver, and copper alloys. Different ratios of 
metal would be used for different ornaments.
The Sican used different ratios of gold, 
silver, and copper to make different classes 
of objects, such as necklaces and masks.

• 
Sican ceramics were also markedly different than Moche ceramics. 
Moche ceramics were mostly white, with thin red and black painted 
lines. But the Sican wares were black with a fine polish on the 
outside, probably from reduction firing in kilns.
Sican Religion
• 
Spanish chronicles state that the Sican people worshiped the moon. 
The name “Sican” even means “temple of the moon” in the local 
language. However, none of the Sican archaeology has unearthed 
any iconography pointing to moon worship.
• 
Instead, there are repeated images of what we call the Sican Deity, a 
figure with a large headdress, ear flares and catlike eyes that narrow 
at the side.
• 
Many scholars believe this deity is an image of Naymlap, the 
culture hero and founder of the Sican people. Others say that it is 
the Supreme Deity with avian characteristics.
• 
The presence of the Sican Deity on Tumi knives brings to mind 
the Decapitator Deity from the Moche culture. In the few instances 
where the Sican Deity is portrayed with his mouth open, we can see 
that he has fangs.
• 
The prevalence of the jaguar headdress and the appearance of 
groups of this character suggest that it is not Naymlap or a Supreme 
Deity but, rather, a priesthood imitating the Fanged Deity, much as 
in the Moche culture.
The Fall of the Sican
• 
After the devastating year of 1100 A.D., the Sican rebuilt, but 
curiously, they no longer created any images of the Sican Deity. 
• 
In 1375, the Chimú finally pushed so far north that they overran 
the Sican people from fortresses in the Jequetepeque Valley to  
the south.
Lecture 16: The Sican—Goldsmiths of the Northern Coast

119
• 
Three generations later, the Sican fell, with the Chimú, under the 
conquest of the Inca. The lower classes were sent far away to work 
camps, while the artisans were brought to Cuzco to enrich their 
new masters.

Lecture 17: The Inca Origins—Mythology v. Archaeology
The Inca Origins—Mythology v. Archaeology
Lecture 17
T
his lecture examines the mythology of the Inca as it has been passed 
down through the Spanish chroniclers and a few firsthand sources. 
Inca-born Guaman Poma de Ayala wrote of the five “world ages” 
of the Inca worldview, each lasting 1,000 years. Archaeology largely 
confirms the timeline and characterization of these ages. The Inca creation 
stories center on the creator deity, Viracocha, and share with other world 
mythologies an account of a devastating flood and the reemergence of human 
society. The origin myths of the Inca recount the travels of eight brothers and 
sisters from a cave called Tambo Toco to the fertile valley of Cuzco. Once 
again, archaeology confirms that at least some parts of these myths are based 
on historical reality.
Sources of Inca History
• 
Archaeolgy gives us some knowledge of Inca history and 
mythology, but most of our knowledge comes from chronicles 
recorded at the contact period and a few decades afterwards. 
o	 The difficulty is that these chronicles sometimes do not match 
in their accounts. In part, these sources conflict because of the 
kind of information sought by chroniclers.
o	 Soldiers tended to ask questions about wealth, land, power, and 
military campaigns; priests asked about religion, family life, 
and communities; and bureaucrats asked about resources, labor 
systems, and politics.
• 
Not all accounts were written by the Spanish. A precious few were 
written by those with Inca heritage.
o	 Garcilaso de la Vega was an Inca prince with a conquistador 
father. He was raised in the royal court in Cuzco until the age 
of 18, when he moved to Spain. In his old age, he produced a 
book about Inca society.

121
o	 The Huarochiri Manuscript is by an anonymous Inca author. It 
was written in the Inca language, Quechua, and translated into 
Spanish. This text gives us some beautiful information about 
myths and religion that we get from nowhere else.
o	 Inca-born Christian convert Guaman Poma de Ayala was a 
great source for Incan mythology. His chronicle included more 
than 400 illustrations depicting all manner of Inca histories and 
life ways, though it is skewed by Christian bias.
Poma’s Five World Ages
• 
Guaman Poma wrote that the Inca saw time as cyclical and that 
there had already been five world ages, each lasting 1,000 years.
• 
The first of those ages was called Wari Wiracocharuna, which 
means Llama Viracocha People. These people used stone tools and 
had only leaves for clothing. They originally worshiped God but 
then they turned to the Andean gods.
• 
The second age was that of the Wari Runa, the Llama People. 
They wore animal skins, developed farming, and were generally 
peaceful. They worshiped Viracocha as their creator deity and were 
apparently wiped out by floods.
• 
The third age was that of the Purun Runa, the Wild People. These 
people had some wealth and started developing textiles. They were 
the first people to populate the Andes on a large scale. With the 
accumulation of wealth came the beginning of war.
• 
The fourth age was that of Auca Runa, the Warlike People. At 
this point, the Andes were divided into four parts and warfare 
spread everywhere. The population started living in hilltop forts. 
This period is also when the Inca decimal system of organization 
began, as well as advances in metallurgy, tools, weapons, and 
road systems.

122
• 
The fifth age was the Age of the Inca. The Inca sent order to 
society and war ended. They worshiped what Guaman Poma 
called the “demons of Cuzco.” This age officially ended when the  
Spanish arrived.
• 
Guaman Poma’s five ages somewhat mirror what archaeolgical 
history tells us about the Andean region.
Viracocha, the Creator Deity
• 
The Inca legends say that the first world was in primordial darkness 
and that a creator deity named Viracocha emerged out of Lake 
Titicaca. His name roughly translates as “sea foam.” Some accounts 
call him Kon Tiki Viracocha.
• 
The Inca was not the first Andean culture to suggest that there was 
a single creator deity.
o	 Coastal cultures worshiped a creator deity named Pachacamac, 
just like the oracle city near Lima.
o	 The Moche called the creator deity Ai-Apaec and carved his 
image all over their temples.
o	 The Chavín also had a single deity. We do not know their name 
for him, but Julio Tello called him the Principal Deity.
• 
Viracocha created the first humans—a race of giants. These giant 
humans did something to anger Viracocha, and he called a great 
flood to destroy them. 
• 
Viracocha then went to the Island of the Sun to call forth or, 
according to some accounts, create the sun, the moon, and the stars.
• 
Once the world had light, Viracocha molded a second race of 
humans from clay or soft rocks. He painted each one of them with 
different colors and gave them different clothing and languages. He 
sent them out across the earth to be the nations of the Andes.
Lecture 17: The Inca Origins—Mythology v. Archaeology

123
Another Flood Myth
• 
In Cristóbal de Molina’s version of the creation story, people 
were already on the earth when a massive flood covered even the 
mountains, and only a single couple survived in a mountaintop 
cave. The couple was washed out into Tiwanaku, where Viracocha 
commanded them to stay and work.
• 
Viracocha then formed people out of clay, and from them, he 
populated the other nations.
• 
These Inca mythologies share flood stories with other mythologies 
around the world. It has been theorized that these flood myths 
are so widespread and similar because each of these civilizations 
experienced the warm-up after the last ice age, when melting 
glaciers caused flooding. 
Viracocha’s Departure
• 
All of the chronicles say that after the creation of humans, Viracocha 
departed Lake Titicaca and headed northwest.
• 
Why northwest? Gary Urton has suggested it is because the Milky 
Way runs from the southeast to the northwest at dawn during the 
harvest season in the Andes.
• 
It is interesting to note that the Urubamba River also runs northwest, 
from near Lake Titicaca to nearby Cuzco and beyond. It was called, 
in ancient times, the Wilka Mayu—the Milky Way—by the Inca.
The Origins of the Inca
• 
The founding family of the Inca dynasty is said to have emerged 
from a cave just south of Cuzco in a place called Pacaritambo, or 
“dawn house.”
• 
The cave had three openings and was called Tambo Toco, or 
“window house.” It was said to have connected all the way back to 
Lake Titicaca by a long underground cave.

124
• 
The Inca came out of the middle cave, called the Capac Toco, or 
the “rich window.” Four brothers and four sisters emerged. The 
brothers’ names were Ayar Manco, Ayar Auca, Ayar Cachi, and 
Ayar Ukhu. The sisters’ names were Mama Ocllo, Mama Huaco, 
Mama Cura, and Mama Raua.
• 
They emerged from these caves with a destiny: to find a fertile valley 
and establish a new kingdom. They enlisted the local Tambo Indians 
as their army, promising land and titles in return for their service.
The Journey to Cuzco
• 
On their journey northwest to find their kingdom, the siblings 
became irritated with the rudeness of Ayar Cachi. They tricked him 
into returning to the cave and trapped him with a large boulder.
• 
As they traveled, they tested the fertility of the soil with a golden 
staff. They eventually climbed up a mountain called the Huanacauri, 
and from there, they first saw the Cuzco Valley. Manco threw the 
staff down into the valley and it sank to the top, marking the valley 
as their destination.
When the founding family of the Inca royal dynasty tested the fertility of the soil 
in the Cuzco Valley, they knew they had reached the kingdom that was destined 
to be theirs.

Lecture 17: The Inca Origins—Mythology v. Archaeology

125
• 
At that point, the youngest brother, Ayar Ukhu, became an eagle 
and flew to the sun to confirm that Cuzco was their destined 
kingdom. When he returned, he became a stone on top of  
the mountain.
• 
On their journey to Cuzco, Ayar Manco and Mama Ocllo had a 
son, Sinchi Roca. He was destined to be the second Sapa Inca, or 
Inca ruler. This is important because it establishes a pattern of royal 
incest to keep the bloodline pure.
o	 The term “Sapa Inca” is used to avoid confusion, because 
the specific term for “lord,” Inca, is also used to describe the 
people and the culture.
o	 Today, we call the Inca descendants and their language 
Quechua, a designation that stems from a mistranslation of 
Kesua Simi (“valley speak”) into Spanish.
• 
The remaining six siblings arrived at Cuzco. Mama Huaco killed 
a man with her sling in such an impressive way that it scared off 
the existing population in Cuzco and allowed the siblings to settle 
there. As the city was founded, the last brother was also turned into 
a stone monument.
• 
Ayar Manco was the last brother left. He became Manco Capac, 
the dynastic founder of the Inca. Mama Huaco is credited with 
planting the first corn in the valley. The Tambo became the 10 
ayllu of Cuzco.
• 
There are indications in the chronicles that Manco Capac lied about 
being the son of the sun in order to establish authority and inspire 
religious worship.
Inca Mythology from an Archaeological View
• 
Modern Quechua people still identify a cave as Tambo Toco.  
A set of ruins has been found nearby, including more than 
200 finely built houses with many gold and silver offerings  
underneath them. The complex looked like a royal palace,  

126
perhaps erected to honor the place of Pacaritambo. The site dates  
to the earliest days of the Inca culture.
• 
Archaeologists have also studied the Island of the Sun, where 
Viracocha is said to have called up the celestial bodies, and where 
the modern Aymara people still celebrate the solstice. Studies have 
confirmed that the Inca were there, and that there was a structure 
indicating the setting of the sun on the solstice. Claims that 
there was a spot where the Inca worshiped the sunrise have not 
been confirmed.
• 
Archaeology seems to confirm that the Inca myths were based, at 
least in part, on historical truth.

Lecture 18: Cuzco and the Tawantinsuyu Empire 
Cuzco and the Tawantinsuyu Empire 
Lecture 18
I
n this lecture, we explore the incredible structure of the most important 
city of the Inca Empire, Cuzco. Cuzco served as the center point of 
Tawantinsuyu, the four parts of the Inca Empire. Cuzco is most famous 
for its impressive architecture, with massive stone walls built with such 
precision that, even with no mortar, they have withstood Spanish onslaught 
and violent earthquakes. The Coricancha, the central temple of the city, was 
the sacred dwelling place of the royal mummies until the Spanish burned 
them, along with the thousands of other mummies housed in Cuzco. Despite 
the efforts of the Spanish, Cuzco remains an emblem of the strength of the 
Inca culture. 
The Four Parts of Tawantinsuyu
• 
Cuzco was the heart and soul of the Inca Empire. Its opulence 
and wealth were unparalleled in the ancient Andean world. To 
understand the function and success of the Inca Empire, one must 
understand Cuzco.
• 
The name Cuzco comes from a word that means “navel,” a 
reference to its role as the center point of Tawantinsuyu, the land 
of four parts. The four parts of Tawantinsuyu were Collasuyu, 
Cuntisuyu, Chinchasuyu, and Antisuyu.
o	 Collasuyu was to the south of Cuzco and contained the very 
important Lake Titicaca region, the Atacama Desert, most of 
modern-day Chile, and part of Argentina.
o	 Cuntisuyu was the smallest of the four quarters, located west 
of Cuzco and stretching down to the coast. It was tiny, but it 
encompassed the former Wari capital and the Nazca lands.
o	 Chinchasuyu was the empire’s hardest region to control. It 
included the northern coast, rich in precious metals, and the 

129
Chimú Empire. It also included Quito, the last acquisition 
before the Spanish arrived.
o	 Antisuyu was essentially the entire Amazonian region. With its 
boundary running all the way down the eastern slope of the 
Andes, it was a difficult area to define and to control for the 
Inca, but it was also very resource-rich.
• 
After conquest by the Inca, the inhabitants of each town within 
the boundaries of the four parts were forced to reconstruct their 
buildings and restructure themselves in a decimal (base-10) system 
of organization.
• 
Goods and labor were redistributed across the empire and 
administered from Cuzco. 
The Structure of Cuzco
• 
Cuzco itself was divided into two parts: upper and lower, or Hanan 
and Hurin Cuzco. This was a reflection of the ayllu system.
o	 The ayllu system is what anthropology calls a “moiety.” It is 
two kin-based groups living in separate parts of the same town 
or region but functioning as a single community.
o	 The kin groups were unified by marriage. Upon marriage, a 
wife would move to her husband’s community but would retain 
the ownership of the land in her community.
• 
The ancient city was set up loosely in a grid, like Wari cities and the 
city of Chan Chan before it. This may indicate a Wari influence on 
the Inca.
• 
According to the chronicles and modern-day locals, the city plan is 
laid out in the form of a puma. Its body was formed by the streets 
and its teeth were the zigzag walls of the Sacsahuamán fortress on 
top of the hill. Under the streets that made the puma’s body ran 
enclosed rivers.

130
• 
The city was full of residences, administrative offices, and 
storehouses called collca for storing the tribute that came from all 
corners of the empire.
• 
Much of the city was taken up by gigantic palaces, one for each 
of the Inca rulers. These individual palaces are reminiscent of the 
ciudadelas of Chan Chan.
Cuzco’s Architecture
• 
Most of the city’s walls were made of perfectly fitted stones, using 
no mortar whatsoever. The stones were fitted together so tightly that 
it is impossible to put a dime between them.
• 
Two kinds of walls dominated the city core: imperial and cyclopean.
o	 In the imperial style, the bricks were rectangular and of modest 
size—something that a single man could pick up and move 
himself. They were pillowed on the outside instead of flat. 
These bricks were often held together by bronze clasps similar 
to those used at Tiwanaku.
o	 Cyclopean architecture was made of huge stones, weighing 
many tons. These were oddly shaped, not rectangular, yet they 
still perfectly fit together. The best example of this in Cuzco is 
the palace of Inca Roca.
• 
The commonly accepted theory of how these huge stones were 
moved is by the use of logs and ropes. A good explanation for how 
they were fitted so perfectly together is harder to come by.
o	 Some archaeolgists believe that the stones were pecked into 
shape with hammer stones, but this theory seems difficult  
to believe.
o	 Some odd elements in modern Inca stories might provide 
other clues to the shaping of these stones. For example, the 
people of the area describe birds whose feces act like acid 
on the stones. Spanish chroniclers tell of a substance that 
Lecture 18: Cuzco and the Tawantinsuyu Empire 

131
could soften stone. One Viracocha myth says that the god 
created humans from soft stones.
• 
When one looks closely at the stone walls, the stones appear to 
be fused. It is possible, though not proven, that the stones were 
softened and fused together.
o	 The 
Incas 
were 
familiar 
with 
acid 
through 
their  
metallurgy techniques.
o	 There is evidence that the Inca interest in the Atacama Desert 
may have been linked to the acid beds found there.
o	 The crystals in andesite may be susceptible to softening with 
concentrated acid, and limestone is likely able to be softened. 
Further study may show that this was the method used by the 
Inca to fit the stones together.
Antiseismic Engineering
• 
Countless earthquakes have hit the Andes since the Spanish 
conquest, but not a single Inca construction has fallen in more than 
500 years.
• 
All Inca walls are trapezoidal, meaning that they taper from a wide 
bottom to a narrower top. This provides additional stability during 
an earthquake.
• 
Beneath some larger buildings are beds of smaller stones. This 
allows the foundation of the building to move slightly without 
harming the integrity of the walls.
• 
The Spanish tried to build over the Inca walls in an attempt to 
eradicate the culture, but their buildings were destroyed by one 
earthquake, leaving the Inca walls still standing.
The Coricancha
• 
The Coricancha is the central temple of the city; its name means 
“golden enclosure.” It was dedicated to the sun and originally 

132
covered in gold plates. Its architecture is perhaps the finest ever 
built by the Inca.
• 
The gold that once covered the exterior and interior walls of the 
palace was removed and melted down by the Spanish. 
• 
The Spanish chronicles spoke of a spectacular garden in front of 
the Coricancha. They said that this garden was full of gold-covered, 
life-sized statues of creatures, not just from the Andes but from all 
over the empire, as well as golden trees with silver leaves.
• 
On the interior of the Coricancha was a set of temples arranged 
around the central courtyard. There were individual temples to the 
sun, the moon, the stars, rainbows, and lightning.
• 
The most important function of the Coricancha was to house the 
ancestral mummies of the royal Inca dynasty.
The Destruction of the Mummies
• 
Ancestral mummies were the heart of religious life. The royal 
mummies were taken to the main plaza for festivals and even given 
food and chicha beer during the festivities.
• 
When the Spanish arrived in Cuzco, they burned all of the thousands 
of ancestral mummies that were housed there. 
o	 Cuzco was a pilgrimage site for mummy worship. People 
would bring their mummies to be interred at Cuzco and would 
visit them there.
o	 Most of these mummies were housed in hillside huacas, 
and the spirits of these mummies were thought to live in  
the mountains.
• 
Many of the huaca shrines were connected to the center of the city 
by what are now known as ceque lines. There were hundreds of 
lines that pilgrims would walk from a now-forgotten center point.
Lecture 18: Cuzco and the Tawantinsuyu Empire 

133
• 
The ceque lines were envisioned to lead far out to the extent of the 
empire. Some archaeologists, such as Tom Zuidema, believe that 
they were perhaps astronomical orientations. The Spanish tortured 
the Inca to reveal the locations of these lines and the mummy shrines.
Sacsahuamán
• 
At the top edge of the valley stand the ruins of Sacsahuamán. It is 
said to be a fortress, but it was probably more like an event center. 
• 
Sacsahuamán has three tiers of massive zigzagging walls facing 
along an open plaza. Some of the rocks in the wall weigh more than 
100 tons.
• 
The structure was called a fortress because a famous battle occurred 
in the plaza there in 1536, when the Inca were trying to retake the 
city from the Spanish.
• 
According to Spanish accounts, that the upper plateau above the 
walls was full of storage rooms holding equipment, possibly

military. The base of a tower still remains, most likely a water tower 
for the irrigation system.
The Solar Pillars of Cuzco
• 
Above the city of Cuzco to the northwest were said to be 4 towers 
used to mark the passing of the Inca lunar months and the solstice. 
Some say there were as many as 16 towers, but all of the chronicles 
agree that there were at least 4.
• 
The chronicles actually say that there were once 3 towers at 
Sacsahuamán. Because they were important to the Inca ritual cycle, 
they were destroyed by the Spanish.
• 
Archaeologists have found 13 towers at Chankillo on the Peruvian 
north coast. These function in the same way that the chronicles 
recount, marking the solstice and the equinox. But the Chankillo 
towers were created 1,600 years earlier than those at Cuzco.
• 
Once again, we see that the achievements of the Inca may well have 
begun in the cultures that came before them.

The Inca—From Raiders to Empire 
Lecture 19
I
n this lecture, we trace the rise of the Inca Empire under its dynamic—
and, perhaps, mythic—early rulers. After the establishment of Cuzco by 
the 1st Inca (the dynastic founder), the culture continued to strengthen, 
flourishing in agriculture and architecture. It was not until the 9th Inca, the 
famous Pachacuti, that the culture transformed into an empire through 
an inspired system of labor taxation. Pachacuti and his son, Tupac Inca, 
expanded the empire through conquest in all directions, a tradition carried on 
by the 11th Inca, Huayna Capac, until his death from smallpox. The bloody 
civil war that followed Huayna Capac’s death was compounded by disease 
from Europe and made the empire vulnerable at a dangerous time.
Early Rulers of the Inca
• 
Spanish chroniclers have left us a wealth of information on the Inca 
dynasties. Unfortunately, they do not all agree. This lecture presents 
the elements of the dynastic history that can be found in the 
majority of the accounts, pointing out when important alternative 
stories exist.
• 
All the chronicles agree that there were 12 fully legitimate Sapa 
Incas, or Great Incas. They also agree that it was during the reign of 
the 8th Inca that empire-building began in earnest.
• 
The 1st Inca, Manco Capac, established Cuzco, planting his staff 
deep in the fertile soil. He married his sister, who gave birth to the 
next ruler of the dynasty, Sinchi Roca. 
• 
Much like the legends of King Arthur, it is hard to separate fact 
from mythology when it comes to the early Inca kings.
The Building of Cuzco
• 
Manco Capac is credited not only with establishing Cuzco but 
with dividing it into two sections: upper and lower. He is also said 

137
to have established the 10 ayllus of Cuzco, made up of the loyal 
Tambo Indians who served as his army as he conquered the valley.
• 
Sinchi Roca is commonly credited with commanding the people to 
terrace the valley and to start planting corn and potatoes. Inca Roca, 
the 6th Inca, is said to have built a cyclopean palace that now serves 
as a tourist destination.
• 
Up until the reign of the 8th Inca, Viracocha Inca, chronicles agree 
that Cuzco was a small city, with a limited area of control and some 
fearsome enemies. That situation changed with the Inca’s son.
The Legend of Inca Yupanqui
• 
During the reign of Viracocha Inca, the powerful Chanka 
people, possibly the remnants of the Wari, attacked Cuzco with 
overwhelming force. Viracocha Inca fled with his heir, Inca Urqon.
• 
His younger son, Inca Yupanqui, stayed to fight with a small group 
of warriors. Legend has it that when all seemed lost, the rocks 
themselves rose up against the Chanka and helped to defeat them.
• 
When the king and his heir returned, Inca Yupanqui banished them 
and had Inca Urqon removed from the royal line. Yupanqui took the 
throne in 1438 with popular support and was proclaimed a hero. He 
became the 9th Inca.
• 
He took the name Pachacuti Inca Yupanqui and became the most 
famous king in Inca history. There are still statues in his honor 
throughout the Andes.
• 
Viracocha Inca was eventually allowed to return to the court but in 
shame. Pachacuti is said to have made him publicly drink chicha beer 
out of a dirty jar as Pachacuti and his court hurled insults at him.
The Vision of an Empire
• 
Under Pachacuti, the Inca went from mere raiders to an empire. 
This was achieved through the implementation of a community-

138
based labor taxation plan called m’ita, which gave Pachacuti a 
workforce of millions.
• 
His plan to unify the Andes under this labor system is said to have 
come to him in a vision, given to him either by the sun or the patron 
deity Viracocha.
• 
According to one myth, as Pachacuti was walking out in the lands of 
Cuzco, he found a crystal tablet in a spring, and that tablet showed 
Pachacuti a vision of a man in a royal headdress with snakes or 
lions emerging from it. This crystal tablet was apparently kept in 
the palace and was able to show Pachacuti the future.
• 
In one version, Pachacuti determined that the headdressed man 
was Viracocha, and that he should be placed above the sun in the 
Coricancha. In the layout of the Coricancha today, we find the 
Temple of Viracocha in a place of prominence.
• 
Other chronicles say that the sun gave Pachacuti the vision and that 
Cuzco became more solarized as a result.
• 
An interesting golden panel once hung in the Coricancha that 
depicts the sun and the moon with a shadowy oval above them. This 
may be Viracocha. 
• 
The symbol of Cuzco is a gruesome face with fangs. If this is 
Viracocha, he bears a striking resemblance to the Fanged Deity.
Pachacuti as Conqueror
• 
According to chronicles, Pachacuti’s first targets were the kingdoms 
around Lake Titicaca. He led a large army, many of them Chankas 
that he had conscripted into service after he had defeated them. He 
brought the leader of the defeated army back to Cuzco and is said to 
have beheaded him.
• 
Next, he turned north to conquer the best agricultural lands. He and 
his heir, named either Thupa Inca or Tupac Inca, led many of the 
Lecture 19: The Inca—From Raiders to Empire 

139
campaigns personally. They conquered the large town of Cajamarca, 
which was to be a major staging ground for future battles.
• 
It was also during Pachacuti’s reign that the great kingdom of 
Chimor was defeated and brought into the empire. The last Chimú 
lord, Minchancaman, was taken prisoner and brought to Cuzco, 
along with his best artisans.
• 
By the end of Pachacuti’s life, the core of the empire was under 
Inca control. From there, it fell to his heir, Tupac Inca Yupanqui, to 
consolidate control of those regions and expand further out to the 
north and south.
The Inca under Tupac Inca Yupanqui
• 
To keep his bloodline pure, Tupac started a tradition by marrying 
his full-blood sister, or perhaps he kept a tradition started by 
Manco Capac.
The layout of Coricancha includes a central courtyard with various temples, 
including the Temple of Viracocha in a place of prominence.

• 
Tupac Inca’s main campaigns reached south into Chile, through the 
Atacama Desert and as far as modern Santiago, almost doubling the 
size of the empire. Before these conquests, he spent much time and 
effort hunting the Amazonians deep into the jungle, claiming the 
eastern slope of the Andes.
• 
Great efforts were made to capture Quito, perhaps because of its 
relationship with the sun. Quito sits on the equator, where the zenith 
passage occurs on the equinox.
• 
One of Tupac’s most famous battles in Ecuador was a naval 
campaign in which he took an army of 20,000 balsa rafts to conquer 
islands in the Pacific. He took them by surprise after laying low for 
more than a year.
The Acllahuasi 
• 
Every year, Inca officials would search the empire for girls aged 8 to 
10, chosen for both beauty and talent. They became special servants 
of the Inca, educated at the capital, and kept as virgins locked away 
in temples. These women were trained to make textiles and chicha 
beer for the ruler.
• 
As they grew older, some of the women were given away as prize 
wives to nobles who had performed some service for the Inca. 
Others were sacrificed. The famous Inca mummy Juanita may have 
been one of these chosen women.
• 
These women lived in an acllahuasi, or “chosen women house.” 
Such houses were not only in Cuzco but in every major town in 
the empire. There were several thousand chosen women reported at 
Spanish contact.
The Reign of Huayna Capac
• 
By the reign of the 11th Inca, Huayna Capac, the empire had been 
well established. This leader spent much of his life inspecting his 
lands and consolidating Inca control by creating an administrative 
infrastructure; he died of smallpox in 1528.
Lecture 19: The Inca—From Raiders to Empire 

141
• 
Most of Huayna Capac’s early career was spent in the northern part 
of the empire, subduing the people of Chachapoyas on the eastern 
slopes of the Andes. 
• 
By this time, the Inca Empire had reached its height of perhaps 10 
million people. 
• 
Huayna Capac consolidated the borders by approaching villages 
of 5,000 or 10,000 people with his army of 200,000 and inviting 
them to be part of the empire. Not surprisingly, this invitation was  
often accepted.
The Arrival of Europeans and Disease
• 
In the either 1524 or 1525, an attack on the Inca southern outposts 
at the edge of Bolivia’s Amazon was reported. This was an attack 
by Guarani Indians from the Amazon, but they were led by Aleixo 
Garcia, a Portuguese explorer.
• 
The Guarani had told Garcia of the riches of the Inca, but they 
became outraged when Garcia launched a raiding party and stole 
Inca silver. They killed Garcia and his men but spared his son, who 
is thought to be the first mestizo in South America.
• 
As Garcia was leading his raid in Bolivia, airborne infectious 
diseases from Europe were sweeping like a storm down from 
Central America.
• 
Huayna Capac’s northern troops reported sick and dying people 
everywhere. Both Huayna Capac and his heir designate died of 
smallpox in 1528.
Chaos and Civil War
• 
The sudden death of Huayna Capac and his heir left the empire in 
chaos. The throne was claimed by two of Huayna Capac’s sons: 
Huáscar and Atahualpa.

142
• 
Atahualpa was descended from the female line of Pachacuti, and 
Huáscar, from Tupac Inca. Huáscar declared himself Inca from Cuzco, 
while Atahualpa installed himself as Inca in the newly conquered Quito.
• 
After four years of brutal civil war, Atahualpa captured Huáscar 
and brought him to Quito. He killed Huáscar’s family in front of 
him before killing the leader himself and burning the mummy of his 
ancestor, Tupac Inca.
• 
Though Atahualpa was now Inca, his empire was ravaged by war 
and disease, and a threat lay ahead that would claim his life only 
one year later.

The Inca—Gifts of the Empire 
Lecture 20
L
ife for the typical citizen of the Inca Empire was characterized by an 
impressively organized system of give and take. Invitations to join the 
empire were not subtle; a large army would appear and offer villagers 
the choice of joining or being escorted to the borders of the empire. Once a 
community became part of the empire, a well-organized, hierarchical system 
of labor taxation was implemented, with each individual assigned tasks 
tailored to his or her age and ability. In exchange for this labor, communities 
received security, terracing and irrigation, public buildings, sophisticated 
roads, and even monthly feasts. This complex but efficient system allowed 
the empire to become wealthy and productive.
A Village Joins an Empire
• 
Let us imagine the life of a married man in a small town called 
Wasi, about to become part of the Inca Empire. 
• 
This man is a farmer, tied closely to his family and neighbors by 
shared labor, resources, and close quarters on easily defended 
hilltops. The community labor is organized by the clan leader, and 
the clan leaders follow the direction of the town mayor, the karakas.
• 
One day, an army of 10,000 shows up and invites the inhabitants 
of the village to become members of the Inca Empire. If the village 
declines, the inhabitants are escorted days away to the borders of 
the empire.
• 
The karakas confers with the Inca and decides on behalf of the town 
to join the empire. The people can stay in their homes and live much 
as they always have. There will be new positions of leadership given 
out and a new system of community service: the m’ita.

144
Lecture 20: The Inca—Gifts of the Empire 
Establishment of the M’ita
• 
A group of assessors arrives from Cuzco and interviews the 
population to determine skill and ability for work assignments. This 
census is taken back to Cuzco.
• 
People in the Inca world were not categorized by their age but 
their work potential. In fact, Andean people did not know how old 
they were or celebrate their birthdays. Babies were not even given 
names until toddlerhood.
• 
No one was really an adult until he or she married. Expected 
marriage age was adolescence. Once married, a person was 
considered of peak working age.
• 
Even the very young and very old were given work assignments 
appropriate to their levels of ability.
• 
Women, children, and the elderly worked within the communities. 
Men were sometimes assigned to work in faraway places for as 
long as required to serve the needs of the empire. While they were 
gone, their neighbors helped with their local duties.
M’ita Management
• 
Though it already has a tradition of community labor, Wasi is 
reordered into a decimal system of work groups. 
o	 The labor of perhaps 100 people is organized by one foreman, 
who is a member of a 10-foremen team that reports to an Inca 
official stationed at the village to supervise the work.
o	 In one town, there may be 100 officials, each of whom 
reports back to Cuzco and organizes the distribution of the  
town’s contribution.
• 
Farming continues as usual, though now the product is divided into 
thirds: one-third to the community, one-third to the empire, and 
one-third for personal consumption.

145
• 
In addition to food, ceramics and textiles are also produced in the 
communities and sent to Cuzco. Each region supplies items as its 
resources allow—wood products and feathers from the Amazon, for 
instance, or precious metalwork from the coast.
• 
Though in general the villages are happy with the mutual 
arrangement, there is some discontent with the seizing of 
community herds by the empire.
Benefits of Joining the Empire
• 
From all accounts, membership in the empire had many benefits, 
including protection from enemies, increased wealth, monthly 
public feasts, and a steady stream of public building projects. In 
addition, there was an almost universal end to hunger.
• 
Further, work crews would arrive from various parts of the empire 
to construct storehouses, agricultural terraces, and roads, improving 
the quality of life for village inhabitants.
• 
From a management perspective, the Inca were wise to send the 
men great distances to complete their assignments. The lack of 
distraction from family and personal responsibilities likely allowed 
the workers to focus more on their work.
Maintaining Local Identity through Textiles
• 
Textiles and clothing were important elements of identity in the 
Andes, even more so during Inca times. 
• 
Each region had its style of clothing and design patterns, signaling 
the home of the wearer. 
• 
Some scholars have suggested that there was actual language 
encoded in the weaving of the regional clothing. Names of places 
and towns may have been encoded and readable in the designs  
and patterns.

146
A New Sense of Security
• 
Another significant benefit for Wasi and other towns like it was that 
the citizens no longer had to worry about enemy attacks.
• 
As a result, they could and did spread out into the valley floors, 
away from the hilltop fortifications. Archaeological excavations 
confirm this change in settlement patterns.
• 
Each couple was given land when they first married, carefully 
measured to support themselves and a growing family. This 
allocation was done analytically, with consideration given to the 
fertility of the land and the resources available.
Feasts and Festivals
• 
The Spanish chronicles recount that almost every month, huge 
parties were thrown in every Inca town, thanking the people for 
their work. Surplus food supplies were shared, gifts were given, and 
good workers were publicly recognized.
• 
Archaeology has found hundreds of serving vessels in the public 
structures of small towns. Those public buildings, and the serving 
vessels themselves, were gifts of the Inca Empire.
• 
These feasts continued the longstanding cultural traditions of 
cultures in Nazca, Pachacamac, and Chavín.
Terraces and Irrigation Systems
• 
One of the main tasks of the work crews was to build agricultural 
terraces into the hillsides. Thousands were built across the empire. 
Such villages as Wasi saw massive labor crews building terraces 
and irrigation systems in the hills around their communities. Corn 
and potatoes filled the landscape.
• 
The irrigation canals were massive works. Sometimes, there were 
dozens of kilometers of channels going up into the mountains to 
bring glacial runoff down for crops.
Lecture 20: The Inca—Gifts of the Empire 

147
• 
The empire also terraced uninhabited land if it was suitable for 
agriculture, creating vast tracts of terraced hillside. The methods 
used for this effort were so effective that many of these terraces still 
exist and are still in use today.
Storehouses and Food Storage
• 
Storehouses, called colcas, were built in every town. They were 
always built into hillsides and were massive structures, constructed 
to hold literally tons of surplus food.
• 
The location of the colcas in high hillsides was partly to impress 
the community but also to control access, because the exposure 
and range of sight was much greater on a hillside. There was the 
additional benefit of strong winds on the hills, which kept the stores 
dry and cool.
• 
The Inca developed the world’s first freeze-drying technique for 
long-term storage of potatoes. The potatoes were left out in the 
freezing air at night and in the daytime sun to evaporate their water. 
Road Systems
• 
One of the most incredible and enduring achievements of the Inca 
Empire was the road system. More than 5,500 kilometers of roads 
were constructed, stretching from Ecuador all the way down to 
Santiago, Chile.
• 
In building these roads, the Inca often relied on roadways already 
in place from previous cultures—yet another way in which the 
Inca can be viewed as the culmination of progress that started well 
before them.
• 
Though they may have relied on earlier road systems, the Inca 
brought these roads to a new height of sophistication and expanded 
their scope to reach into every community of the empire. Work 
crews even paved the roads between communities. 

148
• 
Some roads in the high mountains incorporated bridges, made of 
huge ropes, woven across deep ravines. Llamas were trained to 
cross them, but the Spanish horses would not. The rope bridge 
technique is still practiced in some South American communities.
• 
Along every major Inca road were built tambos (rest houses). 
Tambos had barracks for travelers and food supplies. They were 
also communication points for the system of runners the Inca used 
to relay messages.
• 
These roads and tambos were used primarily by the Inca armies to 
monitor and control the increasingly large territory of the empire. 
Easy and quick access to member communities was vital to 
maintain stability and control.
The Inca Military
• 
The Inca military was an army of farmers led by a few trained 
soldiers. The farmers were men fulfilling their m’ita labor 
obligations. The army could be 100,000 to 200,000 strong.
• 
The leaders of the army were usually relatives of the Inca. Depending 
on the campaign, the leader might even be the Inca himself. 
• 
The peasant soldiers were expected to bring their own weapons, 
armor, and uniforms. Often, soldiers in an Inca army were not all 
dressed the same. In fact, the variety of regional dress in the army 
may have served as a comforting sight to villages approached by 
the forces.
• 
Wives of the soldiers could travel with their husbands. Part of a 
woman’s m’ita service could be specifically to feed and clothe 
her husband. 
• 
Llamas and alpacas were essential to the army because they could 
be a food source, they could provide materials for clothing, and they 
could also serve as beasts of burden. Thousands of them traveled 
with the army.
Lecture 20: The Inca—Gifts of the Empire 

149
Palace Construction
• 
Another important m’ita activity was the construction of Inca 
palaces. Much of Cuzco’s cyclopean walls were built with m’ita 
labor, as were the walls at the Coricancha and Sacsahuamán. 
• 
These elaborate palace projects were assigned partly to keep the 
vast and growing labor force at work, because idle hands can soon 
become a threat.
• 
Machu Picchu was also built by m’ita labor forces. Machu Picchu 
has been called a city, but in reality, it was one of many royal 
residences built for Pachacuti Inca.
• 
These palaces were indeed special, with beautiful, sophisticated 
architecture. But they had very small permanent populations. Only 
servants lived there year-round, though there is no doubt that when 
the Inca came, he brought an enormous entourage with him.
Machu Picchu is often misunderstood as a sacred city, but it is almost certain that it 
was a summer palace for Pachacuti.

150
• 
The palaces also had temples to the sun where the king could 
worship. Although we might think that a temple would denote a 
city rather than a palace, these temples were usually built for the 
specific use of the Inca.
• 
There were also extensive terraces for food—far more than would be 
needed to supply the palace even at peak occupation. These were most 
likely for show, to underscore the wealth of the empire and the ruler.

The Khipu—Language Hidden in Knots
Lecture 21
I
n this lecture, we explore one of the technologies that made the 
complex but efficient Inca system function: the khipu, a knotted string 
device used to record information. Primary sources tell us that khipus 
were created and read by multitudes of scribes known as khipucamayuqs. 
Unfortunately, the practice of knotting khipus disappeared within 50 years 
of Spanish contact, but chroniclers and modern scholarship have allowed 
us to decode the decimal positioning system and knotting categories used 
for accounting. What remains unknown is whether khipus also constituted 
a written language. Several factors suggest that they did, but we have yet to 
find the information we need to decode this language.
The Khipu—Accounting or Writing?
• 
A khipu, from the Quechua word meaning “knot,” is a knotted 
string used by the ancient Inca to record a variety of information, 
such as accounting data, a population census, histories, poetry, 
sets of instructions, or anything else that could be recorded in a  
normal document. 
• 
The Egyptians had papyrus, Mesopotamians had clay tablets, and 
the Inca had khipus. But khipus are a writing medium so foreign 
to the Western world that many scholars hesitate to accept them as 
true writing.
• 
Some scholars believe that they are simply accounting devices, 
while others believe that they constitute a true writing system. It 
seems unlikely that an empire like that of the Inca could have been 
managed without some kind of writing system.
The Khipucamayuqs
• 
The people who knotted khipus were called khipucamayuqs, 
and they were important members of Inca society. They were 
chroniclers, scribes, accountants, and messengers.

152
Lecture 21: The Khipu—Language Hidden in Knots
• 
Each Inca-dominated community had multiple khipucamayuqs, 
sent there from Cuzco to maintain accounting records and 
census information. 
• 
Multiple khipucamayuqs in each community meant that records 
were more likely to be honestly reported. Any discrepancies led to 
an audit.
The Chaski
• 
The Chaski were runners who took khipus across the Inca world via 
the road system.
• 
The Chaski were based in the tambos, or rest houses, along the roads. 
They would run the wrapped khipus sometimes up to 20 kilometers 
to the next tambo, where another Chaski would take it further.
• 
This running system was so efficient that the Inca could order fresh 
fish in the morning and have it delivered to him from the coast  
by dinnertime.
Primary Accounts of Khipus
• 
We know about the khipu almost exclusively from Spanish 
chroniclers. The practice of knotting khipus was gone within 
50 years of Spanish contact, so the window of opportunity for a 
chronicler to have witnessed it was relatively fleeting.
• 
Our first account of a khipu was written in 1532 by Hernando 
Pizarro, the brother of Francisco Pizarro. He witnessed khipus 
being used as an accounting record of storehouse contents.
• 
In the 1540s, Cristóbal de Molina wrote of an extensive library of 
khipus in Cuzco that recorded more than 500 years of Inca history.
• 
In the 1550s, Pedro de Cieza de León and Garcilaso de la Vega both 
told of khipus being used as mnemonic devices, with rhymes being 
taught to small children to help them decode the numbers.

153
• 
In 1555, Agustín de Zárate, 
a 
Spanish 
accountant, 
discovered that the khipu 
used a decimal positioning 
system, with colors denoting 
different categories.
• 
In the 1570s, a priest 
named Francisco de Toledo 
gathered together all of the 
remaining khipucamayuqs 
and had them read all of the 
khipus he could find. He put 
together a detailed history 
of the Inca from the reading 
of these khipus, then had 
the khipus burned and the 
khipucamayuqs executed.
Rediscovering the Khipu Number System
• 
In 1923, a man named Leland Locke rediscovered the keys to 
reading the numbers and the mathematics of the khipu knot system. 
Locke simply read the accounts from the chronicles and followed 
their instructions.
• 
He found that the khipu used a base-10 positional system, with knots 
moving up the strings in positions denoting 1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, and 
so forth. This type of system is especially suited to mathematics.
• 
Loops in each position were knotted with the appropriate number 
of knots for that position. Zero was included as a blank spot; it was 
an important mathematical concept that had been rejected by the 
Europeans until the 1500s.
• 
The top cords of the khipu included the totals for the strings. This 
was an important piece of verification for Locke.
Today, there are about 600 known 
khipus, spread out in museum 
collections around the world, but what 
they mean is still largely unknown.

• 
No new studies occurred until the 1970s, and even today, there are 
very few studies about the khipu. Modern studies have taught us 
about khipu structure and the complexity of its many variables. 
Gary Urton of Harvard has been the driving force in khipu studies 
over the last two decades.
The Structure of the Khipus
• 
The base element of the khipu is called the primary cord. It is a 
thick cord from which all the other cords dangle.
• 
On either side of the primary cord is an end knot, with a dangle 
cord that would also have knots—perhaps designating a title. The 
khipu was meant to be read from left to right, and the end knots 
signaled the beginning and end of the document.
• 
The cords that hung down from the primary cord are called pendant 
cords, and the cord that looped them at the top is the top cord, which 
as Locke found, confirmed the totals of the pendant cords.
• 
The pendant cords sometimes had cords hanging from them, 
as well. These are called subsidiary cords. It was possible for 
subsidiary cords to have their own subsidiary cords.
• 
The knots were positioned so that each numerical position occupied 
a horizontal row across the length of the document. It took quite 
a bit of skill and forethought on the part of the khipucamayuq to 
create straight horizontal rows across many pendant cords.
Knots and Colors
• 
Specific knots were used for different kinds of numbers, including 
long knots, short knots, and figure-eight knots.
• 
The long knots were found only in rows that signified the 1s 
position. All numbers in this row were made with long knots except 
for the number 1, which was made with a figure-eight knot to 
distinguish it from the number 10. Short knots were used in the 10s 
row so that there was clear delineation between rows. 
Lecture 21: The Khipu—Language Hidden in Knots

155
• 
Both Garcilaso and Zárate indicated that colors stood for 
categories. Black cords stood for time; red cords, for warriors; 
white cords, for silver; and yellow cords, for gold. According 
to Garcilaso, a cord that was a combination of blue, white, and 
yellow, symbolized the sun god.
• 
Although we are not sure whether those categories are accurate, it is 
true that there are many colors in the khipus, and these colors would 
have been useful in denoting a variety of content divisions. One can 
tell just from a cursory glance that the colors were used to mark 
separate data sets, whatever the categories may be.
Spaces and Twists
• 
The spacing and the order of the pendant cords was also a useful 
tool to organize information, and we see a good bit of variety in the 
way that the cords were spaced along the primary cord.
• 
These spaces could have been data markers themselves or could 
have been used to separate groups of data.
• 
There were two possible ways for the cords to be twisted: S-ply or 
Z-ply, depending on whether the khipucamayuq knotted to the left 
or right. The pattern of these twists has suggested to Urton that the 
Inca may have used a binary code to organize information.
The Khipu Database Project
• 
The Khipu Database Project is run by Gary Urton at Harvard 
University. He has collected seven points of data for more than 400 
khipus in his database.
• 
The data points are variables, such as cord construction, material 
type, cord color, cord groupings, knot types, knot clusters, and 
numbers of pendants and subsidiary cords.
• 
The data points are run through a computer program to search 
for patterns and similarities. The database is kept online at http://
khipukamayuq.fas.harvard.edu/.

156
• 
One of Urton’s greatest successes so far has been the discovery of 
khipus at the site of the Chachapoyas. Based on Urton’s analysis, one 
specific long khipu may be a two-year census from the community.
• 
Urton notes that two-thirds of the corpus follow the rules of math, 
but one-third does not. What does this remaining third contain?
Argument for a Written Language
• 
Colors and numbers, as we know, can represent spoken words. We 
often use both in our current society to convey information.
• 
There are four main points to the argument that khipus represent a 
written language instead of a mnemonic device.
o	 Most of the information sent back to Spain about the Inca 
Empire was acquired through khipus. 
o	 Thousands of runners handed khipus off along the Inca 
roads, giving only the briefest verbal messages. The court’s 
khipucamayuq could then read those detailed messages. This 
system suggests a widely known standard of encoding.
o	 There were entire storehouses at Cuzco containing thousands 
of khipus, and they were kept by just a few caretakers, who 
could read them all. That goes beyond mere memory, even 
with mnemonic devices.
o	 Some chroniclers mention that songs or poems helped readers 
tease the data out of khipus. Perhaps there were standards of 
Inca grammar taught to small children, much like our ABCs.
• 
What is still missing is a device, something like a Rosetta Stone, to 
help us decode this language, and the possibility of such a device 
exists. In the 1540s, a friar had local khipucamayuqs encode rules 
and prayers into khipus and required villagers to carry them at all 
times. If one of these were found, it might provide the necessary 
information to decode the language.

157
How Old Is the Khipu?
• 
Many people assume that the khipu was an Inca invention, but that 
is not true. Khipus have been found in Chimú burials from 900 A.D. 
and in Wari excavations back to 650 A.D.
• 
In 2005, a khipu was found in Caral that is almost 5,000 years old. 
If khipus are writing, then Caral’s example makes it as old as the 
world’s oldest known form of writing.

Lecture 22: Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley
Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley
Lecture 22
T
his lecture focuses on one of the most well-known archaeological 
sites in South America, Machu Picchu. Its grandeur has given rise to 
the idea that this site was once a city, but it was more likely a summer 
palace of the ruler Pachacuti. The numerous astronomical features at the 
site suggest not only the typical Inca reverence for the sun but also worship 
of the moon and the Milky Way. A vast collection of objects excavated by 
Hiram Bingham in 1920 was kept in secret for decades at Yale but has since 
been returned to Peru as national treasures.
The Palace of Pachacuti 
• 
Machu Picchu was a royal estate, much like the palace at Versailles. 
Thousands of laborers shaved off a mountaintop and created an 
architectural complex that today, 600 years later, still captures  
our imaginations.
• 
Machu Picchu was built for Pachacuti in the mid-1400s. As the 
estate of the son of the sun, it was a sacred place, but no more so 
than any other place where the Sapa Inca dwelled.
• 
There are not nearly enough residences to qualify Machu Picchu as 
a city. No more than a few hundred people, most likely staff, could 
have lived there at one time.
• 
Looking at Machu Picchu from the perspective of the chronicles, the 
complex was most logically a summer home of sorts for Pachacuti.
Entering Machu Picchu
• 
To get to Machu Picchu today, most people take a train from Cuzco 
for four hours and then a bus up a hairpin, winding mountain road. 
It is possible, however, to run the road from Cuzco to Machu Picchu 
in about three and a half hours. The Inca Chaski could likely have 
done it in a shorter amount of time.

159
• 
The Sun Gate’s arch and the rooms that flank it have partially fallen 
over. Still, one can see from the height of the central doorway that it 
was tall enough for the Inca to have entered atop his litter, with 6 to 
10 servants carrying him.
• 
The first structure one arrives at is the guardhouse, given that 
name because of its commanding view of the complex. Next 
to the guardhouse is a wide, flat area, where Bingham found the 
majority of the burials that he uncovered during his three seasons 
of excavation.
o	 Of the 173 burials that Bingham found, he determined that 
more than 150 of them were women, leading to the conclusion 
that Machu Picchu was a cloister for the chosen women.
o	 Bingham’s analysis later proved to be wrong. The bones were 
of normal age and gender distribution.
• 
As you follow the royal causeway down to the rest of the architecture, 
you descend through the middle of wide terraces and a central gate. 
Once through this gate, you are properly in the complex.
• 
The rooms you walk through at first are of indeterminate function, 
perhaps storage rooms, barracks, or workshops. Bingham found this 
area very clean, as if the abandonment had taken everything with it.
The Quarry and Inca Stonework
• 
Off to the left is what is known as Machu Picchu’s quarry, a 
large area of natural outcrops and jumbles of stones. The quarry 
is in a seemingly odd place, right in the middle of the complex. 
Archaeologists interpret its presence as proof that Machu Picchu 
was still a work in progress when it was abandoned.
• 
There is a stone there that seems to be in the process of being split, 
with holes drilled in a line along its face. We believe that sticks were 
inserted into these holes and then wet down with water. As they 
expanded, the force of the sticks together would break the stone.

160
• 
There are also examples in the Machu Picchu quarry of how stones 
were shaped. They were broken out with hammer stones and shaped 
with thousands of percussion strikes against the surface.
• 
The current theories hold that log roller systems were placed 
underneath large stones and pulled by many men with ropes; 
however, this system may not have been used in a mountainside 
quarry, such as Machu Picchu.
Astronomical Features
• 
If a building has an astronomical alignment and we can detect it and 
determine it, then we can say, at least in part, what the purpose of that 
building was. There are a number of such features at Machu Picchu.
• 
The strongest example of an astronomically aligned building at 
Machu Picchu is the Torreón, or the Sun Temple. With its unique 
capital D shape and oddly unfinished floor, it’s clearly different 
from the other structures at the site.
o	 There is a huaca underneath this structure, so it is clearly 
connected to the ancestors. And we know that this is the place 
of the son of the sun, the Sun Temple.
o	 At dawn on June 21, the winter solstice, the light comes 
through one of the structure’s two windows to line up with a 
carved line on the rough bedrock floor. The Torreón had to be 
positioned perfectly for the effect to work.
o	 The second window in the Torreón seems to be facing toward 
the December solstice, although this has not been tested.
• 
At what many consider to be the heart of the site is a private 
courtyard surrounded by architecture built out of megalithic 
stones. On its eastern side facing the rising sun stands the Temple 
of Three Windows. 
o	 This structure, too, has been identified as a temple aligned with 
the June solstice, but it is not quite that.
Lecture 22: Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley

161
o	 Symbolically, it seems to be calling forth the image of Tambo 
Toco, the three caves from which the first ancestor Inca 
emerged just south of Cuzco. As a temple, it is connected with 
origins or, perhaps, birth and hereditary rights to rulership.
o	 The June solstice sun does not reach the proper alignment 
within the temple until about an hour after dawn. Its position at 
sunrise is about 5 degrees off. This corresponds more accurately 
with the major lunar standstill, which occurs every 18.6 years.
o	 It is possible that this is a temple to the moon, constructed to 
celebrate the wife of the sun and the mother of the son of the 
sun—the Inca queen.
• 
Another astronomical site is the Southern Cross Stone, so named 
because of its shape and the direction it points. It looks like a stone 
kite tilted up off the surface of the central plaza near the Temple of 
Three Windows.
Symbolically, the Temple of Three Windows seems to recall the three caves, just 
south of Cuzco, from which the first ancestor Inca had emerged.

162
o	 The tip of the Southern Cross Stone points generally in the 
direction of the constellation of the Southern Star. 
o	 Some sources assert that the stone points to the Southern Cross 
every May, but it is unlikely that this was the case during Inca 
times. The slow progression of the equinoxes means that the 
constellation was 8 degrees off of where it is today when 
Machu Picchu was built.
o	 An additional complication is the shift in the night sky 
throughout the night. It is impossible to tell at what time of 
night the Incas would have been referencing the sky.
• 
One final astronomical feature is the Intihuatana. It is called the 
Hitching Post of the Sun, after a similar object at the site of Pisac 
for which chroniclers had a name.
o	 The Intihuatana is a rectangular stone that sticks off of a flat, 
rectangular stone platform. The Inca said that it would hitch the 
sun at its farthest points on the solstice to keep it from flying 
off the horizon.
o	 There is little left of the structure around the Intihuatana to give 
us clues about how it was aligned. It may have been in shadow 
for all days except the summer and winter solstices.
Importance of the Milky Way
• 
In the Andes, the Milky Way is much brighter than it is in the 
United States. The Inca, uniquely in the ancient world, were able to 
see constellations in the Milky Way, which they called “dark cloud” 
constellations.
• 
The Milky Way was envisioned as a river running through the sky, 
a road connecting the earth to the heavens.
• 
In Quechua, the name for Milky Way is Wilka Mayu, the same 
name given to the Urubamba River. There was likely a symbolic 
relationship between the terrestrial and the celestial rivers.
Lecture 22: Machu Picchu and the Sacred Valley

163
• 
In June and December, the Milky Way forms a cross with the sunrise 
and sunset points of the solstices. This positioning is still important 
to the Quechua people, influencing their agricultural practices and 
the arrangement of their communities. It may also symbolize the 
quartering of the Tawantinsuyu Empire.
The Discovery of Machu Picchu
• 
Hiram Bingham was an American, born in Honolulu, and a 
professor of history at Yale University. While in Peru researching 
Simón Bolívar in 1909, he heard a legend about a lost city full of 
Inca gold.
• 
Bingham went back to the states and acquired funding for an 
expedition. He returned to Peru in 1910 to hunt for what he 
promoted as the “Lost City of the Inca.”
• 
After finding the disappointing ruins of Vilcabamba, Bingham 
followed a lead telling of a mountaintop city near Cuzco. A boy 
from a nearby farm led Bingham to Machu Picchu.
• 
It is now clear that Bingham was not the first Westerner to discover 
Machu Picchu. There were missionaries and even multiple 
European explorers who saw it much earlier. German businessman 
Augusto Berns has now been identified as the first, in 1867, 44 
years before Bingham showed up.
• 
Bingham returned the next year and conducted three seasons of 
excavations. According to shipping logs, he sent 74 boxes back 
from Peru to Yale, including almost 5,000 objects. Yale kept these 
objects hidden until 2010, when it finally published a detailed list 
and sent the items back to Peru, their rightful home.
• 
Regardless of how it was found, for many people the beautiful 
architecture 
at 
Machu 
Picchu 
represents 
the 
height 
of  
Inca civilization.

Spanish Contact—Pizarro Conquers the Inca
Lecture 23
T
his lecture traces the rise of Francisco Pizarro and the subsequent fall 
of the mighty Inca Empire at his hands. Pizarro was the uneducated 
son of a Spanish soldier, but he was a strong warrior and rose quickly 
through the ranks of the conquistadors. His discovery of riches along the 
coast allowed him to gain permission from the crown to conquer and convert 
the Inca. After a minimal attempt at conversion, Pizarro captured the Inca 
Atahualpa, holding him for ransom before executing him. Pizarro established 
control over the diseased-ravaged Inca population, maintaining it through 
the rebellion of Manco Inca. His betrayal of his partner Almagro led to his 
eventual assassination, but not before the Inca Empire was irretrievably lost.
The Rise of Pizarro
• 
In the year 1532, a group of 168 men conquered an empire of 10 
million people. Perhaps no event in world history changed the 
lives of so many so quickly and profoundly. But the process started 
much earlier.
• 
Vasco Núñez de Balboa fought his way through the Darien Gap 
in Panama in 1513, becoming the first conquistador to see the 
Pacific Ocean. Among Balboa’s men was a young soldier named 
Francisco Pizarro. 
• 
Balboa was accused of trying to seize power and was arrested by 
none other than Pizarro. He was convicted of treason and beheaded 
in 1519. As a reward for his service, Pizarro was appointed the mayor 
and magistrate of Panama City, remaining at that post until 1523.
• 
Pizarro was born the illegitimate son of a Spanish soldier in Trujillo, 
Spain, sometime around 1470. Despite his lack of education, he 
was a strong soldier and an inspiring leader of men.

166
Lecture 23: Spanish Contact—Pizarro Conquers the Inca
• 
Stories of the rich kingdoms to the south inspired Pizarro to launch 
his first major expedition with two partners in the year 1524. They 
launched multiple unsuccessful expeditions from 1524 to 1527.
Discovery of the Inca
• 
In 1528, one of these expeditions captured a raft off the coast of 
Ecuador carrying gold, silver, fine textiles, and pottery. The locals 
confirmed that there was much precious metal in the area, as well as 
many llamas. The llamas were an important find because they could 
be used as beasts of burden.
• 
This meeting netted Pizarro some important advantages: knowledge 
of the Inca civil war; interpreters, especially Felipillo and Martin, 
who would be his voices to Atahualpa; gold and silver as proof of 
his discovery; and a foothold from which to launch his next assault.
• 
Pizarro was denied permission to launch an assault on the Inca by 
the governor of Panama. However, he was granted permission by 
the Spanish queen of Charles I, Isabella.
• 
When Pizarro returned to the coast in 1531, he found the town of 
Tumbes in ruins, ransacked by its enemies. He moved further down 
the coast to establish a base camp.
Luring Atahualpa
• 
By the summer of 1532, Captain Hernando de Soto arrived with 
enough men for Pizarro to make his move. De Soto was sent 
on a reconnaissance mission of the area and returned with an 
envoy from Atahualpa himself, carrying gifts for Pizarro and an 
invitation to meet.
• 
Pizarro and his men set out into the Andes to meet the Inca at the 
town of Cajamarca. They arrived first, and Pizarro made a plan to 
ambush Atahualpa. He sent a party led by de Soto and his brother, 
Hernando Pizarro, to convince Atahualpa to come alone.

167
• 
Martin translated as de 
Soto offered a ring as 
a gift and invited the 
Inca to Cajamarca for a 
private meeting. Atahualpa 
ignored de Soto, but he 
acknowledged Hernando 
when he learned he was 
Pizarro’s brother.
• 
De Soto and his men made 
a 
short 
demonstration 
of trick horse riding, 
which pleased the Inca. 
They declined a dinner 
invitation and left, unable 
to 
lure Atahualpa 
to 
Cajamarca alone.
The Ravages of Disease
• 
The Inca Empire was in chaos at this time after the death from 
smallpox of Atahualpa’s father and his designated heir. 
• 
The first reports of native illness began in Mexico in 1519; disease 
then spread like wildfire. By the time Pizarro had launched his 
mission, the native population of Panama was so decimated that the 
Spanish were importing black slaves as labor.
• 
Medical historians estimate that two-thirds of the population died 
in the first 50 years of contact. Some estimates go as high as 90 
percent. By 1532, millions of people had died, including many of 
the nobles in Cuzco.
• 
To the people of the Americas, all illness was an attack from the 
supernatural world, not a physical condition. To have so many ill 
was seen as a sign that the gods were displeased.
Pizarro never went to school and spent 
his early life as a pig farmer but became 
a strong and inspiring leader.

168
o	 The wave of illness demoralized the people, who felt 
abandoned by their religion, and led to a willingness to be 
baptized into Christianity.
o	 Ironically, the contamination of baptismal water resulted in a 
faster and farther spread of disease. Because the germ theory of 
disease had not yet been discovered, the European priests had 
no idea that they were compounding the problem.
• 
Disease was not the only mass killer. Tens of thousands of Inca 
soldiers died in the clash that occurred when Huascar led his 
troops to Ecuador to subdue his brother, Atahualpa. Huascar was 
unsuccessful and was sent in chains back to Cuzco.
The Capture of Atahualpa
• 
Atahualpa’s victories over Huascar and other hostile parties gave 
him a strong sense of confidence as he was carried to meet the 
Spanish at Cajamarca on the morning on November 16, 1532.
• 
Knowing that there were fewer than 200 Spaniards there, he left the 
bulk of his 100,000-man army outside the city, entering with only 
a few thousand personal guards and some high-ranking nobles to 
witness his victory.
• 
He was met by a single Spanish friar with a Bible. The Crown had 
ordered Pizarro to convert the natives, not execute them, and this 
was Pizarro’s cursory gesture. 
o	 The Crown and the Catholic Church were closely tied in 
Europe, and they sought to maintain that shared power in the 
New World.
o	 A new population of millions of natives meant a new 
opportunity to grow (and enrich) the Catholic Church.
• 
Atahualpa threw the Bible to the ground, giving Pizarro all the 
excuse he needed. Spaniards appeared from corners and doors, and 
Lecture 23: Spanish Contact—Pizarro Conquers the Inca

169
a canon was fired into the Inca’s guard. Atahualpa was captured at 
knifepoint by Pizarro himself.
• 
According to chronicles, the Inca lost as many as 7,000 men trying 
to lay siege to the town and rescue their ruler, but the conquistadors 
were well dug in. On fear of execution, Atahualpa ordered an end 
to the attack.
• 
The Inca sent Chaskis to fulfill Pizarro’s ransom demand for a room 
full of gold and silver. Even when the ransom was paid, however, 
Atahualpa was not released. Pizarro kept him for eight months, 
using his protection to search the Andes for more wealth.
• 
In the winter of 1533, under protest of his men and brothers, Pizarro 
executed Atahualpa. He was to be burned at the stake, but at the last 
minute, he agreed to be baptized and, instead, was garroted.
The Establishment of Spanish Authority
• 
Pizarro installed Huascar’s younger brother, Thupa Wallpa, as the 
new Sapa Inca. With that false authority, his forces entered Cuzco 
unopposed on November 15, 1533.
• 
Pizarro’s men set about sacking the city. The Coricancha’s gold was 
melted down. Temples and palaces were torn down and the blocks 
were used to build Catholic cathedrals. Any vestiges of Inca culture 
were replaced by Spanish culture.
• 
Thupa Inca died of smallpox later that year, leaving the throne 
vacant and Pizarro without a puppet ruler. But another legitimate 
heir and son of Huayna Capac, Manco Inca, a boy of only 17, 
accepted the position.
The Rebellion of Manco Inca
• 
Manco Inca enjoyed the benefits of being the titular Sapa Inca for 
a few years, but then guilt, shame, and humiliation brought about 
a change of heart. He escaped Cuzco and became the leader of an 
Inca rebellion.

170
• 
In 1536, he launched a coordinated army of m’ita laborers to expel 
the Spanish from Cuzco. He defeated the Spanish in the Sacred 
Valley at the fortress of Ollantaytambo. The magnificent victory 
involved changing the course of a river.
• 
At Cuzco, an Inca force of more than 200,000 burned the city and 
killed Pizarro’s younger brother Juan in battle.
• 
Though Manco Inca’s forces were victorious throughout the territory, 
they had one crucial weakness: They were primarily farmers who 
had to stop fighting to plant their crops. This delay allowed the 
Spanish to regroup and changed the momentum of the fighting.
• 
Manco Inca was forced to retreat, but he never surrendered. He 
built a fortress, called Vilcabamba, 200 kilometers downstream 
on the Urubamba River, which he maintained as the independent 
capital of the empire.
• 
The empire resisted the Spanish for decades until the last named 
rebellion ruler, Tupac Amaru, was captured and Vilcabamba was 
brought to its knees. Tupac was brought back to Cuzco, where he 
was executed.
Pizarro’s Demise
• 
Pizarro’s troubles began with the betrayal of his partner Almagro. 
Betrayal was a tactic he had been using since he turned on  
Balboa in Panama.
• 
When Almagro joined Pizarro in Cuzco, he asked to claim a share 
of the plunder. Pizarro gave Almagro everything south of Cuzco, 
an area that proved to be worthless. Almagro demanded Cuzco, but 
Pizarro denied his claim.
• 
Pizarro established a new capital called Ciudad de Los Reyes, now 
the modern-day city of Lima. When Almagro tried to take it by 
force, the relatives of Pizarro defeated his army and executed him 
in the summer of 1538.

• 
Pizarro claimed Almagro’s lands for his own, leaving Almagro’s 
conquistador son without land and bankrupt. Pizarro avoided an 
assassination attempt by Almagro’s son but was eventually captured 
at his own dinner table and killed. Although Pizarro was 70 years 
old, it took repeated blows by several soldiers to kill him.
• 
Almagro’s son was quickly captured and executed. Pizarro’s 
severed head was placed in a box and buried under the main 
cathedral, where it was found by workmen in 1977. Pizarro’s skull 
showed clear evidence of his gruesome death.

Remnants of the Past—Andean Culture Today
Lecture 24
T
his final lecture explores the last resistance of the ancient Inca 
culture, then turns to the remarkable preservation of ancient traditions 
by indigenous people living in South America today. The Quechua of 
Peru still live much like their Inca ancestors, weaving textiles and planting 
crops on terraces. The Misminay rely heavily on astronomy in their practices, 
and the people of Tupicocha continue to use khipu in some ceremonies. 
The Aymara, the descendants of Tiwanaku, have achieved prominence in 
Brazil while respecting the traditions of their ancestors. The Amazonian 
tribes continue with shamanism and headhunting, and the many uncontacted 
tribes undoubtedly maintain traditions, as well. The future for ancient South 
American studies is hopeful, with much left to learn and discover about these 
fascinating civilizations.
The Final Inca Resistance
• 
Though the Inca Empire was effectively conquered by Pizarro, 
resistance continued for decades after his death.
• 
Manco Inca’s rebellion led to the establishment of a new Inca capital 
at Vilcabamba. The people there were able to resist the Spanish for 
almost 40 more years, until the first viceroy of Peru, Francisco de 
Toledo, put Vilcabamba under siege in 1572. 
• 
After the fall of Vilcabamba, the hope of a centralized Andean 
Empire was lost. Thus began a pattern of Spanish domination that 
would continue for more than 200 years.
Rise and Fall of Spanish Dominance
• 
To establish their dominance, the Spanish viceroyalty of Peru 
exerted control over the local leaders, called curacas, through gifts 
of land and wealth.

173
• 
The curacas used the existing m’ita system to extract gold and 
silver from the mines for Spain. The country was looted of its 
resources.
• 
In 1808, Napoleon invaded Spain and took the king, Ferdinand VII, 
hostage. The Spanish colonies, already tired of Spanish rule and 
working independently, took advantage of this moment and rebelled.
South American Independence
• 
The well-known liberator of South America was Simón Bolívar, 
who started in Venezuela and fought the Spanish out of many 
countries between the years 1812 and 1825.
• 
Peru was liberated by a lesser-known general from Argentina 
named José de San Martin.
• 
It was Bolívar’s dream to form a single nation, but when regional 
leaders could not agree, he proclaimed himself the dictator of South 
America in 1828. He ruled for a little more than two years and then 
stepped down before dying of tuberculosis in 1830.
• 
The countries of the Andean region have gone back and forth 
between dictators and democracies, with a few indigenous rebellion 
movements along the way. The traditional way of life has never 
returned on a large scale.
The Quechua
• 
The Inca Empire may be long gone, but some people in the region 
still live in much the same way as they did during the contact period. 
These people are called the Quechua after their native language.
• 
Today, there are somewhere in between 10 and 14 million Quechua 
speakers, as many as there were in the Inca Empire. This is an 
impressive resurgence after the devastation of disease. In 1975, 
Quechua was proclaimed the second official language of Peru.

174
• 
The Quechua still farm corn and potatoes, often on the terraces that 
their ancestors built.
• 
Drinking chicha beer out of flaring-mouthed jugs is still in style, 
and people still pour the first sip on the ground to the Pachamama, 
or Mother Earth.
• 
Villages across the Andes are still divided into ayllus, paired groups 
of kin, who help one another in a rotating communal labor system. 
Much of the population of Cuzco and its surroundings still live 
communally, helping one another as needed.
Ancient Ways in the Colca Valley
• 
In the middle of the main town of the Colca Valley stands a statue 
of the mummy Juanita. The Inca worship of ancestors as members 
of the living community clearly remains.
The Copper Scroll, found in Cave 3, describes enormous sums of gold and 
silver hidden in the desert. Whether or not the treasure belonged to the sect is a 
matter of debate.

Lecture 24: Remnants of the Past—Andean Culture Today

175
• 
Every year on the June solstice, a parade called the Inti Raymi is 
held in Cuzco. Tens of thousands of Quechua people, from Cuzco 
and the villages of the region, represent their communities as they 
march up the Avenida del Sol and into the main plaza.
o	 The people parade through the streets in groups ranging from 20 
to 200, representing their villages and the work groups of Cuzco. 
The work groups are especially reminiscent of the Inca m’ita.
o	 The parade goes on not for hours but for days. It culminates 
with the man currently proclaimed the Inca carried through the 
crowd and the sacrifice of a black llama.
o	 The original Inti Raymi festival was held annually by the 
ancient Inca, but Manco Capac was the last Sapa Inca to lead 
it in 1535. The parade started in the 1940s as a theatrical 
performance but has since been embraced by the Quechua as a 
true celebration of their culture.
The Study of Misminay
• 
Gary Urton, now a professor at Harvard, became interested in the 
people of Misminay during his dissertation research. These people 
were farming in traditional ways and organized in ayllus, but there 
were other aspects of ancient origin that piqued his interest.
• 
The village is divided into four quarters, like the old empire of 
Tawantinsuyu. The roads that divide these quarters are oriented 
toward the winter and summer solstice points.
• 
Their agricultural cycle is followed by watching the movements of 
the Milky Way, called the Wilka Mayu. They watch for the Milky 
Way just before dawn and wait for it to line up with the orientations 
of the roads.
• 
Urton also recorded a great knowledge of constellations, the same 
constellations recorded at Spanish contact. These included the dark 
constellations in the Milky Way.

176
o	 The Misminay are especially interested in the Pleiades, whose 
brightness signals for them the rainfall in the coming year.
o	 Climatologists have discovered that El Niño patterns do, 
in fact, affect the perceived brightness of stars; thus, the 
correlation seen by the Misminay is borne out by science.
The Khipus in Tupicocha
• 
In the 1990s, Frank Salomon discovered ancient khipus being kept 
by the tiny community of Tupicocha.
• 
Though no one in the town could read the khipus, they were used 
as sashes for the office of ayllu leaders and called quipocamayos. 
It was said that they contain the community’s laws and instructions 
for how the leaders should organize labor and inventory tools.
• 
The community knew what khipus were once for, and one particular 
boy in Tupicocha showed great insights into how they might have 
been read.
• 
No one in Tupicocha could tell Salomon how old the khipus 
are. Town records mention them at least as far back as 1890, but 
frequent repairs have made them difficult to date.
• 
Regardless of their antiquity, the khipus of Tupicocha, as well 
as more rudimentary knot techniques in other communities, 
demonstrate a clear effort on the part of a Quechua community to 
retain non-European cultural traditions.
The Aymara People
• 
The Aymara people live mainly around Lake Titicaca, though there 
are pocket communities all over the Andes. They are commonly 
thought to be the descendants of the people of the great city  
of Tiwanaku.
• 
The people have a long history of rebellion against oppressors, and 
in modern times, their population has thrived.
Lecture 24: Remnants of the Past—Andean Culture Today

177
• 
In 1959, an Aymara rebellion in Bolivia brought agrarian reform 
and freed many Aymara from servitude on corporate farms.
• 
In 2005, Bolivia elected its first Aymara president, Evo Morales. As 
of 2012, he remains in office.
• 
The Witches Market section of La Paz sells many traditional 
Aymara goods, including herbal remedies and llama fetuses, which 
are buried in the corners of houses for spiritual protection.
The Uros People
• 
The Uros are a very traditional group of indigenous people, living 
on the north end of Lake Titicaca, near the city of Puno.
• 
They live on floating islands, made of the lake’s totora reeds. They 
have been living on these floating islands since Inca times.
• 
The current communities live anchored near the shore, but the 
ancient community would float across the lake to avoid domination.
• 
After 2000, churches built on top of pontoons were floated out 
and attached to the Uros islands. The community is converting to 
Christianity and may quickly lose its traditions.
Pre-Columbian Traditions in the Amazon
• 
There are more uncontacted people in the Amazon than in all 
of the rest of the world put together. Brazil alone may have 67 
uncontacted tribes. Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia have several, as 
well, and Ecuador has a forbidden region where no one, not even 
researchers, is allowed to go.
• 
We know that shamanism exists among the Amazonian tribes. 
o	 We know that the shamans believe they can visit the spirit 
world and transform into jaguars. 

178
o	 We know that shamans are also healers who use hallucinogenic 
drugs to see the spirits that cause illness and speak to the spirits 
of the plants to prescribe medicines.
• 
We also know that warfare and headhunting still exist among the 
Jívaro and other tribes in Ecuador. Headhunting undoubtedly still 
takes place today in Ecuador’s forbidden zone.
• 
The Desana of Colombia explain that there is one creator deity, 
Viho-mahse, and he has many spirits that are his creations and 
helpers. Some of those spirits are benevolent, while others are 
rogue and dangerous. Like all the ancient cultures we’ve studied 
in this course, the Desana believe there is only one true deity in the 
land of the jaguar. 
Hopes for Ancient South American Research
• 
We should hope that the pace of discovery along the north coast 
continues as it has for the last decade. With the most recent research 
at Huaca Prieta suggesting that the main pyramid was begun 
as early as 5000 B.C., our assessment of Andean civilization is 
moving from being very old toward being the oldest city builders 
on the planet.
• 
We also have reason to be optimistic about khipu research. If we 
could break the khipu code, it would allow the Inca to come out 
of history and tell us in their own words who they were and what  
they thought.
• 
Finally, we should hope that archaeolgy in the Amazon continues. 
Now that we have found major habitation sites, excavations 
underneath may reveal much older levels of occupation. If they do, 
we may finally track the Fanged Deity back to his lair and learn 
why people along Peru’s desert coast worshiped a jaguar god.
