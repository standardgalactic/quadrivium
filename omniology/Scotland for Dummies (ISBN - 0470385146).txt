his guide is a departure from conventional travel guidebooks. Rather
than just throwing out dizzying reams of information for you to sift
through until you’re too tired to distinguish Edinburgh from Inverness,
Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition, separates the proverbial curds from
the whey.
This book takes you through the whole process of putting together your
trip to Scotland, from the ins and outs of a manageable itinerary to
advice on choosing the right places to stay or how much time to allot for
attractions and activities. My recommendations may not be perfect for
everyone. The goal here is to help you see what may interest you
(whether it’s castles, museums, pubs, or open countryside) and what
probably will not float your boat, as they say in Scotland. Your time is
valuable, so this book strives to get right to the point. Scotland For
Dummies, 5th Edition, is designed to give you a clear picture of what you
need to know and what your options are, so that you can make informed
decisions easily and efficiently about traveling in Scotland.
About This Book
Some parts of Scotland are bound to interest you more than others, so
don’t feel as if you have to read this book cover to cover. If you want to
focus on the metropolitan life, for example, then simply concentrate on
Part III’s chapters, devoted to Edinburgh and Glasgow. If the lore of the
Loch Ness monster or the lure of the Hebridean Islands intrigues you,
then you can find valuable information in Part VI. And if you’re drawn to
picturesque settings that are less touristy than the famous attractions,
then Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition, can point you in the right direc-
tion as well.
Although the information is laid out in the logical order of a step-by-step
manual, you don’t need to read the book in order from front to back.
You’re also not expected to remember everything you read — you can
just look up and revisit specific information as you need it. Each section
and chapter is as self-contained as possible, a feature that allows you to
concentrate on what’s important to you (and skip the rest).
Of course this guide has up-to-date information on the best hotels and
restaurants in Scotland’s major cities and regions. It also has informa-
tion on shopping and nightlife, attractions, walking tours, helpful histori-
cal asides, and details on what makes Scotland unique — whether that’s
golf courses or the tallest mountains and most pristine seas in the entire
United Kingdom.

Please be advised that travel information is subject to change at any
time, and this is especially true of prices. It never hurts to check the
Internet or write or call ahead for confirmation of the “current” situation
when making your travel plans. The author, editors, and publisher can’t
be held responsible for the experiences of readers while traveling. Your
safety is important to us, however, so we encourage you to stay alert
and be aware of your surroundings. Keep a close eye on cameras,
purses, and wallets, all favorite targets of thieves and pickpockets.
Conventions Used in This Book
The goal of Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition, is to be a quick read (in
whatever order you choose), so the listings for hotels, restaurants, and
sights are standardized throughout the chapters. Each listing offers you
an idea of what a place is like and then gives you details about specific
addresses, prices, and hours of operation.
Other conventions include:
 Abbreviations for commonly accepted credit cards used through-
out this book.
• AE: American Express
• DC: Diners Club
• MC: MasterCard
• V: Visa
 An alphabetical listing of hotels, restaurants, and attractions in
each chapter.
 Page references for maps, given whenever possible, to help you
locate hotels, restaurants, attractions, and the like. If a hotel,
restaurant, or attraction is in an out-of-the-way area, however, it
may not appear on a map. In chapters on the major cities, informa-
tion about bus routes, and, in Glasgow, subway stops, is given as
well.
 Prices listed in British pounds sterling (£), with the dollar equiva-
lent given in parentheses. The conversion rate (always changing in
the real world, of course) used to make these calculations is £1
equals $1.85.
Price is normally a factor when choosing hotels and restaurants, and
Scotland is not a cheap place to visit. The relative costs of accommoda-
tions and meals are indicated with dollar signs. Specific prices are given,
too, but the dollar signs are a quick way for you to see if a place is in
your budget. My scale for accommodations and restaurants ranges from
one dollar sign ($) to four ($$$$). Most hotel prices are per night for
double rooms (rather than per person per night). The cost of a meal 
Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition 
2

generally means dinner with at least two courses and a drink per person.
The following table helps you decipher what the dollar signs mean.
Cost
Hotel
Restaurant
$
Less than £55 ($102)
About £10 ($19)
$$
£55–£120 ($102–$222)
£10–£25 ($19–$46)
$$$
£121–£175 ($224–$324)
£26–£35 ($48–$65)
$$$$
More than £176 ($326)
More than £35 ($65)
The hotels in Chapters 11 and 12 are divided into two categories —
favorites and those that don’t quite make my preferred list, but still get
my seal of approval. Don’t hesitate to consider the “runner-up” hotels —
the amenities and the services they offer make them all reasonable
choices as you decide where to rest your head at night.
Foolish Assumptions
This book makes some assumptions about you and what your needs
may be as a traveler. Here’s what I’ve assumed might apply to you.
 You’re an experienced traveler who hasn’t had much time to
explore Scotland but wants expert advice when you finally do get a
chance to enjoy any part of the region.
 You’re an inexperienced traveler looking for guidance when deter-
mining whether to take a trip to Scotland and how to plan for it.
 You’re not looking for a book that provides all the information avail-
able about Scotland or that lists every hotel, restaurant, or attrac-
tion available to you. Instead, you want a book that focuses on the
places that will give you the best or most unique experience in
Scotland.
If you fit any of these criteria, then Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition, is
the book for you.
How This Book Is Organized
Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition, consists of five parts. The chapters
within each part cover specific components in detail.
Part I: Introducing Scotland
This part introduces you to the very best of Scotland and touches on
issues you need to consider before actually getting down to the nitty-
gritty of trip planning. It includes a brief history of Scotland as well as
recommended reading, when and where to go, and detailed itineraries to
consider.
Introduction 3

Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland
This part gets down to the nuts and bolts of travel planning, including
information on managing your money, how best to get to Scotland, get-
ting around the country, and reserving hotel rooms. It also addresses
special considerations for families, seniors, travelers with disabilities,
and students, as well as gay and lesbian travelers.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow
You may only have time to see the two major cities in Scotland, and so
I’ve devoted an entire chapter to each, with details on hotels, restau-
rants, top attractions, shopping, walking tours, and nightlife. Plus, you
can find information on how to get around, how much time you need to
see things, suggested itineraries, and recommended side trips.
Part IV: The Major Regions
This part contains chapters on Scotland’s major regions: from Southern
Scotland to the Highlands, from Ayrshire and Argyll to the Hebridean
Islands. Each chapter has suggestions on accommodations, places to
dine out, and attractions, not to mention some useful information on
shopping and nightlife. For a more thorough overview of Scotland,
including a brief description of these regions, flip to Chapter 3.
Part V: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has a Part of Tens. These more breezy chapters
have quick and handy lists that highlight the best golf courses, castles,
natural attractions, and more in Scotland.
In the back of this book, I’ve included an appendix — your Quick
Concierge — containing lots of handy information you may need when
traveling in Scotland, such as phone numbers and addresses of emer-
gency personnel or area hospitals and pharmacies, lists of local newspa-
pers and magazines, protocol for sending mail or finding taxis, and more.
Check out this appendix when you’re faced with the little questions that
may come up as you travel. The Quick Concierge is easy to find because
it’s printed on yellow paper.
Icons Used in This Book
You can’t miss the icons (little pictures) sprinkled throughout the mar-
gins of this book. Think of them as signposts that highlight special tips,
draw your attention to things you don’t want to miss, and give you a
heads-up on a variety of topics.
Scotland For Dummies, 5th Edition

Keep an eye out for the Bargain Alert icon as you seek out money-saving
tips and/or great deals.
Best of the Best icons highlight the best each destination has to offer in
all categories — hotels, restaurants, attractions, activities, shopping,
and nightlife.
Watch for the Heads Up icon to identify annoying or potentially danger-
ous situations such as tourist traps, unsafe neighborhoods, budgetary
rip-offs, and other things to beware.
This icon points to useful advice on things to do and ways to schedule
your time.
Look to the Kid Friendly icon for attractions, hotels, restaurants, and
activities that are particularly hospitable to children or people traveling
with kids.
This icon points out secret little finds or useful resources that are worth
the extra bit of effort to get to or find.
Where to Go from Here
As I’ve already mentioned, this travel guide isn’t designed to be read
from beginning to end (although you’re certainly welcome to do so).
Instead, it provides detailed and well-organized information on loads of
topics — from getting your passport to finding the best restaurants. So
choose your own adventure and look for the topics or destinations you
want to explore by using the Table of Contents or the Index.
As you start to prepare for your visit to Scotland, remember that plan-
ning is half the fun. Choosing your destinations and solidifying the
details shouldn’t be a chore. Make the homebound part of the process a
voyage of discovery, and you’ll end up with a vacation that’s much more
rewarding and enriching. See you in Scotland!

Part I
Introducing
Scotland

In this part . . . 
S
cotland, with its rich and evocative past, has much to
offer the traveler. But visitors don’t come here just for
the history: The country’s vibrant cities, natural beauty,
indigenous culture, and friendly people are all additional
draws.
This part brings you Scotland’s best, from hotels and restau-
rants to castles and art galleries. You’ll ﬁnd useful itineraries
to help you decide what to see if your time is limited. This
part also contains a condensed history, a glossary of the
Scots’ language, a list of suggested books and ﬁlms to help
get you in the mood, and lots more. When’s the best season
to visit? Are discounts available for seniors or children?
What, for heaven’s sake, is haggis? Look no further; the
answers are here.

Chapter 1
Discovering the 
Best of Scotland
In This Chapter
 Staying in the top hotels and dining in the best restaurants
 Discovering the best castles and museums
 Drinking in the best pubs and bars
T
o start things off, let’s begin with the highlights: some of the best
that Scotland has to offer travelers, from unforgettable experiences
and attractions to excellent hotels and top-rated restaurants; from first-
class castles and museums to a selection of world-renowned golf
courses, friendly pubs, and more. Entries in this chapter — as well as
listings later in the book — are ordered alphabetically, under each main
heading, not by preference. Keep your eyes open for the “Best of the
Best” icons throughout Scotland For Dummies.
The Best Travel Experiences
 Ardnamurchan Peninsula: One of the more easily reached but
seemingly remote areas of the Western Highlands, and isolated
enough to feel like an island, this neck of land stretching toward the
Inner Hebridean Islands is the most westerly point of the entire
British mainland. See Chapter 18.
 Edinburgh’s Old Town: This district of the capital is probably the
most visited location in all of Scotland — and not without good
reason. Running along the spine of a hill and extending from the
ancient castle to the history-filled Palace of Holyroodhouse,
Edinburgh’s Old Town is a delight to wander through. Make sure
you take time to explore the alleyways. See Chapter 11.
 Glasgow’s City Centre: The thriving heart of a modern European
city, the core of Glasgow — Scotland’s largest metropolis — offers
some of the finest examples of monumental Victorian architecture
in the world. The streets here follow a strict grid pattern, so you
don’t need to worry about getting lost. See Chapter 12.

 Glen Coe: Glen Coe is such a spectacular valley (Scotland’s
Yosemite) that it’s hard to reconcile its natural beauty with its
bloody history. The visitor center near Glencoe village is an award-
winner, with details on hiking, geology, and the clan battles that
occurred here. See Chapter 18.
 Loch Lomond: Located near Glasgow, this loch is the largest inland
body of water in all of Great Britain. It’s only about a 30- to 45-
minute drive or train ride from the Glasgow city limits. When you
reach the loch, you can hike, canoe, or just relax. See Chapter 16.
 Loch Ness: This loch is mysterious and legendary — if somewhat
overrated in my mind. In addition to looking out for Nessie, the elu-
sive and mythical monster, you should seek out other local attrac-
tions, such as Urquhart (pronounced ir-ket) Castle, and travel
around the surrounding countryside. See Chapter 18.
 Mull or Skye: These two islands of the Inner Hebrides are the easi-
est and most impressive ones to reach. However accessible, they
still provide some real scenery and a true taste of life on the many
isles that cover the western shores of Scotland. See Chapter 19.
 Outer Hebrides: From Lewis, with its standing stones and wind-
swept cliffs, to the tip of Harris (famous for wool tweed), and then
farther south to more stony hills and white sand beaches, and finally
to Barra, the Outer Hebrides (or Western Isles) are unequalled in
Scotland for a maritime and island experience. See Chapter 19.
 Sands of Morar: North of the quiet port of Arisaig in the Western
Highlands, the Sands of Morar offer beautiful bleached beaches set
against postcard-pretty seas. You can almost reach out and touch
the islands of Rhum and Eigg from here; or catch a ferry to moun-
tainous Skye from nearby Mallaig. See Chapter 18.
 Sandwood Bay: An environmentally protected area near Blairmore
in the Northwest Highlands has a beach that, by most accounts, is
the most beautiful and unsullied in all of Great Britain’s mainland
sandy shorelines. See Chapter 18.
The Best Accommodations in 
Edinburgh and Glasgow
Edinburgh
 Best Boutique Hotel: The Bonham. In an upscale, western New
Town neighborhood of the Scottish capital, the Bonham offers
some of the most alluring accommodations in a city filled with fine
hotels. See Chapter 11.
 Best Traditional Hotel: Balmoral Hotel. With a Michelin-star
restaurant, attentive doormen dressed in kilts, and a romantic pile
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
10

to rival any others, the Balmoral is legendary, and it’s located
smack in the heart of the capital. See Chapter 11.
 Best Rooms near the Castle: The Witchery by the Castle. As its list
of celebrity guests testifies, The Witchery offers opulence and indi-
viduality in a manner not seen anywhere else in Old Town. See
Chapter 11.
 Best Hotel in Leith: Malmaison. At the port of Leith, Malmaison is
about a 15-minute ride north of Edinburgh’s center. Named after
Joséphine’s mansion outside Paris, the hotel celebrates the Auld
Alliance of France and Scotland, and occupies a Victorian building
built in 1900. See Chapter 11.
 Best Hotel Health Spa: Sheraton Grand Hotel. Near the city’s con-
ference center, the Sheraton Grand has wonderful facilities in an
adjoining building. Especially noteworthy is the roof-top indoor/
outdoor pool. See Chapter 11.
Glasgow
 Best Boutique Hotel: Hotel du Vin at One Devonshire Gardens. In
a West End neighborhood filled with sandstone-fronted town
houses, this hotel at the well-known address stands out. It’s a re-
creation of a high-bourgeois, very proper Scottish home from the
early 1900s, boasting antique furnishings and discreetly concealed
modern comforts. See Chapter 12.
 Best Hip Hotel: Brunswick Hotel. With only 18 rooms, the
Brunswick exudes cool in the city’s hip Merchant City district of
the City Centre. The design is modern and minimalist, but is exe-
cuted with character and class. See Chapter 12.
 Best in the Commercial Centre: Malmaison. Linked to the hotel
with the same name in Edinburgh (see listing in previous section),
this Malmaison is in a building that dates from the 1800s. It wel-
comes visitors with Scottish hospitality and houses them with
quite a bit of style. See Chapter 12.
The Best Small and Country House Hotels
 An Lochan, Tighnabruaich, Argyll: Formerly the Royal, this hotel
dates to the mid–19th century, but today it’s fully modernized
inside, with plush rooms that overlook the sea and the hotel’s own
moorings. Great fish and seafood, too. See Chapter 15.
 Ardanaiseig Hotel, Kilchrenan, Argyll: This stone Scottish baronial
mansion, built in the 1830s, offers a good bit of luxury in an out-of-
the-way corner of Argyllshire, on the way toward the Western
Highlands. See Chapter 15.
 Argyll Hotel, Iona, the Hebrides: This charming, traditional hotel,
in the village of Iona, is comfortable and environmentally 
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 11

conscious, with its own organic vegetable garden and an ethos of
not disturbing the fragile island ecology. See Chapter 19.
 Ballachulish House, Ballachulish, the Highlands: This 17th-century
laird’s house includes a history said to be the inspiration for key
passages in Robert Louis Stevenson’s Kidnapped. See Chapter 18.
 Darroch Learg, Ballater, the Northeast: This hotel is one of the
more highly regarded inns in the Royal Deeside region, near the
Queen’s estate at Balmoral, several historic castles, and the
Speyside whisky trail. See Chapter 17.
 Glenapp Castle, Ballantrae, South Ayrshire: Glenapp is a beautifully
decorated pile close to Stranraer, with Victorian baronial splendor
and antiques, oil paintings, and elegant touches. See Chapter 14.
 Knockinaam Lodge, near Portpatrick, Dumfries, and Galloway:
With a Michelin-star restaurant, Knockinaam combines exquisite
meals with a secluded seaside setting on the Rhinns of Galloway.
See Chapter 14.
 Prestonfield, Edinburgh: Although it’s within the city, this hotel
rises from the meadows in Jacobean splendor, amid gardens, pas-
tures, and woodlands, below Arthur’s Seat on the south side of the
Scottish capital. See Chapter 11.
The Best Dining in Edinburgh and Glasgow
Edinburgh
 Best Cafe: Spoon. In the heart of Old Town, Spoon forks out some
of the best soups, salads, and sandwiches in Edinburgh — and the
freshly made cakes and other sweet stuff are perhaps even better.
See Chapter 11.
 Best Fine-Dining Restaurant: Restaurant Martin Wishart. With one
of the city’s precious Michelin stars and its most talented
chef/owner, Restaurant Martin Wishart is where the leading out-of-
town chefs dine when they visit Edinburgh. See Chapter 11.
 Best Italian Restaurant: Santini. Although many of the more estab-
lished Italian restaurants in town don’t like hearing it, Santini usually
gets the rave reviews and sets the highest standards. See Chapter 11.
 Best Modern Scottish Restaurant: Atrium. Owned by Andrew and
Lisa Radford, Atrium offers dishes prepared with flair and imagina-
tion, but not excessive amounts of fuss or over-fancy presentation.
See Chapter 11.
 Best Restaurant Views: Oloroso or Forth Floor Restaurant. This
category is a dead heat between Oloroso and Forth Floor at Harvey
Nichols department store. Both offer well-conceived preparations
of fresh Scottish produce to go with those scenic vistas. See
Chapter 11.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
12

Glasgow
 Best Bistro: Cafe Gandolfi. This landmark in the Merchant City dis-
trict offers straightforward and delicious dishes, whether you
choose a bowl of Cullen skink (smoked haddock chowder) or a sir-
loin steak sandwich. See Chapter 12.
 Best Seafood Restaurant: Gamba. This Commercial Centre base-
ment restaurant celebrated its tenth year in 2008. Over the preced-
ing decade, it proved to be the most consistent place for excellent
fish and shellfish meals. See Chapter 12.
 Best Indian Restaurants: The Dhabba or Mother India. Glasgow
loves its Indian cuisine, but these two restaurants offer something
better than the norm, favoring dishes that are more subtle, in sur-
roundings that are less clichéd than the typical curry houses. See
Chapter 12.
 Best Pub Food: Stravaigin Café Bar. With an award-winning restau-
rant in the basement, the ground-floor pub Stravaigin offers simi-
larly top-notch quality food — at a fraction of the restaurant price.
See Chapter 12.
 Best on a Budget: Wee Curry Shop. A brief stroll from the shop-
ping precincts of Sauchiehall Street, the Wee Curry Shop is a tiny
gem of a restaurant, serving freshly prepared Indian cuisine at bar-
gain prices. See Chapter 12.
The Best Rural Restaurants
 Applecross Inn, Applecross, the Western Highlands: The inn may
not be the easiest place in Scotland to reach, but many visitors
agree that the twists and turns of the road to Applecross are well
worth the journey for a meal here. See Chapter 18.
 Braidwoods, Dalry, North Ayrshire: One of the standout restau-
rants in Ayrshire and holder of a Michelin star and other accolades,
Braidwoods is expensive but worth the price. See Chapter 15.
 Creagan House, Strathyre, the Trossachs: Run by Cherry and
Gordon Gunn, the restaurant is part of an unassuming but charm-
ing inn in a 17th-century farmhouse. See Chapter 16.
 Mhor, near Balquhidder, the Trossachs: Just up the road a bit from
the Creagan, this loch-side restaurant is a perennial favorite of trav-
elers who love food and are passing through the Trossach moun-
tains. See Chapter 16.
 Restaurant Andrew Fairlie, Gleneagles Hotel, Auchterarder,
Perthshire: It may be the finest dining experience in the country,
and chef Fairlie is arguably the most talented cook in Scotland. See
Chapter 16.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 13

 Seafood Cabin, Skipness, Argyll: I love this place on a sunny summer
day, when you can nosh on fresh seafood and take in the view, from
picnic benches, of a castle and Isle of Arran. See Chapter 15.
 Three Chimneys Restaurant, Colbost, Isle of Skye: Probably the
most popular and most famous restaurant in the Hebridean Islands,
the Three Chimneys serves superb Scottish cuisine paired with
produce from Skye, its island home. See Chapter 19.
The Best Castles
 Blair Castle, Blair, Perthshire: Blair is chock-full o’ stuff: art, armor,
flags, stag horns, and more goodies not typically found on the stan-
dard furniture-and-portrait castle tour. See Chapter 17.
 Caerlaverock Castle, near Dumfries, Dumfries and Galloway: Once
a target of English armies, the impressive ruins of Caerlaverock
(pronounced ka-liver-ick) remain one of Scotland’s more classic
Medieval castles, and its magnificent moat is still intact. See
Chapter 14.
 Castle Tioram, Blain, Ardnamurchan: The ruins of this small
fortress sit along the picturesque shores of Loch Moidart. You can
enjoy some good hiking trails near the castle, too. See Chapter 18.
 Doune Castle, near Stirling: Fans of the film Monty Python and the
Holy Grail may recognize Doune. Thanks to its limited restoration,
visitors get a good idea of what living here in the 14th century was
like. See Chapter 16.
 Duart Castle, Craignure, Isle of Mull: Duart was abandoned in 1751,
but thanks to the efforts of Fitzroy Maclean, it was restored from
ruins in 1911. It’s worth making your way up the narrow, twisting
stairs, because you can walk outside on the parapet at the top of
the castle. See Chapter 19.
 Eilean Donan Castle, Dornie, the Highlands: This is probably the
most photographed stone pile in Scotland (after Edinburgh Castle,
that is). On an islet in Loch Duich, Eilean Donan is a quintessential
castle. See Chapter 18.
 Stirling Castle, Stirling: This castle was the residence of Mary
Queen of Scots, her son James VI of Scotland (and later James I of
England), and other Stuart monarchs. One section, the Great Hall,
stands out for miles thanks to the creamy, almost yellow exterior
that apparently replicates its original color. See Chapter 16.
 Threave Castle, near Castle Douglas, Dumfries and Galloway:
Threave is a massive 14th-century tower house on an island in 
the middle of Loch Ken (a boatman ferries visitors across). See
Chapter 14.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
14

The Best Cathedrals, Churches, and Abbeys
 Dunfermline Abbey and Palace, Dunfermline, Fife: This abbey is
on the site of a Celtic church and an 11th-century house of worship
dedicated to the Holy Trinity; traces of this history are visible
beneath gratings in the floor of the old nave. See Chapter 16.
 Glasgow Cathedral, Glasgow: This cathedral is also known as the
cathedral of St. Kentigern or St. Mungo’s, and it dates to the 13th
century. The edifice is mainland Scotland’s only complete medieval
cathedral. See Chapter 12.
 High Kirk of St. Giles, Edinburgh: Just a brief walk downhill from
Edinburgh Castle, this church, sometimes called St. Giles Cathedral —
and its steeple, in particular — is one of the most important architec-
tural landmarks along the Royal Mile. See Chapter 11.
 Iona Abbey and Nunnery, Iona, the Hebrides: This spiritual land-
mark is a significant shrine to the earliest days of Christianity in
Scotland. See Chapter 19.
 Jedburgh Abbey, Jedburgh, the Borders: This abbey is one of four
Borders abbeys commissioned by Scots King David I in the 12th
century. See Chapter 14.
 Melrose Abbey, Melrose, the Borders: The heart of Scots King
Robert the Bruce is rumored to be buried somewhere on the
grounds of this abbey, which sits amid somewhat spectacular
ruins. See Chapter 14.
 St. Vincent Street Church, Glasgow: This church offers limited
access to visitors, but it’s the most visible landmark attributed to the
city’s great architect, Alexander “Greek” Thomson. See Chapter 12.
The Best Art Galleries
 The Burrell Collection, Glasgow: This gallery houses the treasures
left to Glasgow by Sir William Burrell, a wealthy ship owner and
industrialist who had a lifelong passion for art. He started collect-
ing at age 14 and only ceased when he died, at the age of 96, in
1958. See Chapter 12.
 Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), Glasgow: This gallery is housed in
the former Royal Exchange. The permanent collection has works by
Stanley Spencer and John Bellany, as well as art from the “new
Glasgow boys.” See Chapter 12.
 Hunterian Art Gallery, Glasgow: The Hunterian holds the artistic
estate of James McNeill Whistler, with some 60 of his paintings as
well as some by the Scottish Colourists. It also boasts a collection of
Charles Rennie Mackintosh–designed furnishings. See Chapter 12.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 15

 Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, Glasgow: This is the
remarkable flagship of the city’s well-regarded municipal art collec-
tion, housed in the recently restored masterpiece of Victorian
architecture. See Chapter 12.
 Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery, Kirkcaldy, Fife: I have a partic-
ular soft spot for this modest provincial gallery and museum
because I think it has one of the single best collections of Scottish
Colourist paintings and other Scottish works from the 19th and
20th centuries. See Chapter 16.
 National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh: The National Gallery
offers a collection that has been chosen with great care and
expanded by bequests, gifts, loans, and purchases. See Chapter 11.
 Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh: This gallery
houses Scotland’s national collection of 20th-century art in a con-
verted 1828 school that’s set on 4.8 hectares (12 acres) of grounds.
See Chapter 11.
 Scottish National Portrait Gallery, Edinburgh: Designed by Rowand
Anderson, the gallery gives you a chance to stand before the faces
of many famous people from Scottish history. See Chapter 11.
The Best Museums and Historic Attractions
 Burns Cottage and Museum, Alloway, Ayrshire: This attraction may
be basic, but it remains a must-see for even casual fans of Scotland
greatest poet, Robert Burns. See Chapter 15.
 Calanais Standing Stones, Callanish, Isle of Lewis, the Hebrides:
This ancient circle and cross-shaped formation of large upright
stones is known as the “Scottish Stonehenge” and is one of the
most significant prehistoric sites in Scotland. See Chapter 19.
 Calton Hill, Edinburgh: This landmark mound of rock and earth
rises about 105m (350 ft.) above the city and is crowned with mon-
uments. It’s the main reason that Edinburgh is called the “Athens of
the North.” See Chapter 11.
 Culloden Moor Battlefield, near Inverness, the Highlands: This
boggy moorland in the Highlands is where the hopes of Bonnie
Prince Charlie’s Jacobite uprising of 1745 (begun at Glenfinnan)
ended in complete defeat in 1746. See Chapter 18.
 Gladstone’s Land, Edinburgh: This 17th-century merchant’s house,
looking suitably weathered and aged, is decorated in period-style
furnishings. It features colorful, if faded, paintings of flowers and
fruit on a sensitively restored timber ceiling. See Chapter 11.
 Glasgow School of Art, Glasgow: This building was designed by
Scotland’s great architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, whose global
reputation comes largely from this magnificent example on
Garnethill above Sauchiehall Street. See Chapter 12.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
16

 Glenfinnan Monument, Glenfinnan, the Highlands: This monument
marks the hopeful start of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion, led by
Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was trying to reclaim the English and
Scottish crowns for his Stuart family lineage. See Chapter 18.
 Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh: A most impressive modern sand-
stone building not far from the Royal Mile, the museum is home to
exhibits that follow the story of Scotland, including archaeology,
technology and science, the decorative arts, royalty, and geology.
See Chapter 11.
 The Palace and Abbey of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh: The palace
was first built in the 16th century adjacent to an Augustinian abbey
that David I established in the 12th century. Today, the royal family
stays here whenever they occasionally visit Edinburgh. When they’re
not in residence, the palace is open to visitors. See Chapter 11.
 Skara Brae, Orkney: This is the best-preserved prehistoric beach-
side village in northern Europe. For an idea of what you’ll see here,
think Pompeii-meets-the-Neolithic. See Chapter 20.
The Best Historic Houses and Gardens
 Abbotsford, near Galashiels, the Borders: Abbotsford is the man-
sion that Scotland’s best-known novelist, Sir Walter Scott, built and
lived in from 1817 until his death. You can visit extensive gardens
and grounds on the property, plus the private chapel added after
Scott’s death. See Chapter 14.
 Culzean Castle, South Ayrshire: This castle overlooking the Firth of
Clyde is a fine example of Robert Adam’s “castellated” style (built
with turrets and ramparts). It replaced an earlier castle kept as the
family seat of the powerful Kennedy clan. See Chapter 15.
 Hill House, Helensburgh, West Dumbartonshire: The design of this
house was inspired by Scottish Baronial style, but it’s still pure
Charles Rennie Mackintosh, from the asymmetrical juxtaposition of
windows and clean lines that blend sharp geometry and gentle
curves to the sumptuous but uncluttered interior. See Chapter 13.
 Holmwood House, Glasgow: This 1858 villa designed by Alexander
“Greek” Thomson is probably the best example of his innovative
style as applied to stately Victorian homes. See Chapter 12.
 Inverewe Garden, Poolewe: On the south-facing shores of Loch
Ewe, in the Northwest Highlands, Inverewe has an amazing collec-
tion of plants in this sprawling garden considering how far north
it’s situated. See Chapter 18.
 Little Sparta, Dunsyre: This garden was devised by one of
Scotland’s most intriguing artists of the 20th and 21st centuries, Ian
Hamilton Finlay. See Chapter 14.
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 17

 Logan Botanic Garden, Port Logan: This garden has palms, tree
ferns, and other exotic plants that you wouldn’t expect to see in
Scotland, such as towering flowering columns of echium pininanas,
native to the Canary Islands. See Chapter 14.
 Mount Stuart, Isle of Bute: This neo-Gothic red sandstone mansion
belongs to the Marquess of Bute’s family, but it’s open to the public
for much of the year. See Chapter 15.
 Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh: Royal Botanic, with its acres of
land to explore, is one of the grandest gardens in all of Great
Britain, which is certainly saying something. See Chapter 11.
 Traquair House, Innerleithen: This house dates to the 10th century
and is perhaps Scotland’s most romantic house, rich in its associa-
tion with Mary Queen of Scots and the Jacobite uprisings. See
Chapter 14.
The Best Small Towns
 Culross: Thanks largely to the National Trust for Scotland, Culross,
in Fife, shows what a Scottish village from the 16th to 18th cen-
turies was like, with its cobbled streets lined by stout cottages fea-
turing crow-stepped gables. See Chapter 16.
 Dirleton: Midway between North Berwick and Gullane, and east of
Edinburgh, Dirleton is cited by many as the prettiest village in
Scotland. It’s picture-postcard perfect, not like a real town at all,
but rather one that appears to have been created for a movie set.
See Chapter 13.
 Kirkcudbright: On the southern coast of the Scottish mainland,
near the Solway Firth, this quaint village of charming cottages,
many with colorful pastel paint jobs, was once a leading artists’
colony. See Chapter 14.
 Plockton: Located not far from Eilean Donan Castle, Plockton is
probably the prettiest village in the Highlands. It sits on the shores
of Loch Carron, and you’ll be amazed to find palm trees. See
Chapter 18.
 Tobermory: Made famous by a BBC children’s TV program (in
which it was called Balamory), this port on the Isle of Mull has a
crescent full of pastel painted buildings facing the popular West
Coast harbor. See Chapter 19.
 Ullapool: This town has the busiest fishing harbor in the northwest
of Scotland, and it’s also a popular resort — the last outpost before
the sparsely populated Northern Highlands. See Chapter 18.

The Best Distilleries
 Caol Ila Distillery, Port Askaig, Islay: I’ve not seen a distillery with
a more impressive view, in this case across a narrow sound to the
hilly Isle of Jura. See Chapter 15.
 Edradour Distillery, Pitlochry, Perthshire: Visitors get a good primer
on the whisky-making process at this minidistillery. See Chapter 17.
 Glenfiddich Distillery, Dufftown, the Northeast: In contrast to
Edradour, this is one of Scotland’s largest whisky factories, set
amid the rolling wooded hills of the famous Speyside region. See
Chapter 17.
 Laphroaig Distillery, Islay, Argyll: With more than a half-dozen dis-
tilleries, Islay (pronounced eye-la) is Scotland’s whisky island.
Laphroaig has a distinctive peaty flavor with a whiff of sea air
(some say they can even taste a little seaweed). See Chapter 15.
The Best Golf Courses
 Muirfield Golf Course, Gullane, East Lothian: Muirfield is ranked
among the world’s great golf courses. It’s the home course of the
Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers — the world’s oldest
club. See Chapter 13.
 Royal Troon Golf Club, South Ayrshire: The city and its environs
offer several sandy links courses, most prominently the Royal
Troon Golf Club. But try the municipal courses for a bargain round
as well. See Chapter 15.
 St. Andrews, Fife: Surely Scotland’s most famous golf mecca, St.
Andrews offers five 18-hole courses as well as one 9-hole course for
beginners and children, all owned by a trust and open to the
public. See Chapter 16.
 Turnberry Hotel Golf Courses, South Ayrshire: Like the Royal
Troon, Turnberry has been the scene of Open tournaments and
other professional golfing events over the years. Guests of the
Westin Turnberry hotel get priority here. See Chapter 15.
The Best Pubs and Bars
 Café Royal Circle Bar, Edinburgh: This New Town pub stands out
as a longtime favorite, boasting lots of atmosphere and Victorian
trappings. It attracts a sea of drinkers, locals as well as visitors. See
Chapter 11.
 Claichaig Inn, Glencoe, the Highlands: This hotel has a rustic pub
with a wood-burning stove, although it’s really the staff’s sunny
Chapter 1: Discovering the Best of Scotland 19

dispositions that warm the woody lounge and bar. Claichaig Inn is
especially popular with hikers. See Chapter 18.
 Drover’s Inn, Inverarnan, Loch Lomond: This hotel has an atmos-
pheric pub, with an open fire burning, barmen in kilts, and plenty of
foot and car travelers nursing their drinks at the north end of Loch
Lomond. See Chapter 16.
 The Horse Shoe, Glasgow: With its long, horseshoe-shaped bar and
central location, this pub is a throwback to the days of so-called
Palace Pubs in Scotland. See Chapter 12.
 Mishnish, Tobermory, Isle of Mull: This pub on the Isle of Mull is a
rather big quayside bar for such a diminutive town. See Chapter 19.
 The Pot Still, Glasgow: This pub gets the nod because of its selec-
tion of single malts, which easily numbers into the hundreds. See
Chapter 12.
 The Prince of Wales, Aberdeen: With the longest bar in town and a
convivial atmosphere, this pub is possibly the best place to grab a
pint in Aberdeen. See Chapter 17.
 The Shore, Edinburgh: This pub in Leith fits seamlessly into its sea-
side port surroundings without resorting to a lot of the usual decora-
tions of cork and netting. It has excellent food, too. See Chapter 11.

n this chapter, I give you a concise bit of history to elevate your
knowledge of a country whose national origins are among the oldest
in Europe. I also show you how to tackle the language. Yes, it’s English,
but probably not the same English that you’re used to. I also cover the
basics of Scottish food, which is often as misunderstood as the natives’
accents. Interested in the Scottish folk-music scene? You can find some
basic info in this chapter, plus check out my suggested list of must-see
films about — or at least set in — Scotland and books about the country
and its people.
Scotland 101: The Main Events
Geographically, Scotland is tiny compared with the United States or
Australia, and small by most European standards, too: The country
occupies the northern one-third or so of the United Kingdom, covering
about 78,725 sq. km (30,410 sq. miles). That makes it a bit bigger than
the combined size of Massachusetts, Vermont, and New Hampshire — or
not quite the size of Austria. It is about 440km (275 miles) long and
248km (154 miles) wide at its widest point. Few parts of Scotland are
more than about 64km (40 miles) from the sea, and Scotland has more
than 750 islands, although only about 10 percent of them are inhabited.
Scotland’s population has hovered around five million for the past 50
years; so while the country may be small, it is not very densely popu-
lated. A majority of its residents live in the Central Belt, in and around
Glasgow and Edinburgh, the country’s two largest cities. They have a
combined population of more than one million, and as many again live in
the suburbs, towns, and villages near to them.

The key to comprehending — and, in part, enjoying — Scotland is to
know at least a bit of the country’s long and sometimes complex history.
For much of its existence, Scotland had full (if disputed) autonomy from
England, its larger, more populous, and sometimes pushy neighbor to
the south. Although the Scottish and English crowns were joined (1603)
and the countries were unified into Great Britain (1707), they remain dis-
tinct nations.
Early history
Standing stones, burial chambers, and brochs (circular stone towers) are
the remaining signs of Scotland’s earliest residents, but little is known
about these first Neolithic tribes that were living in parts of the country
thousands of years before Romans arrived. When the Romans invaded in
about A.D. 82, much of the land was occupied by a people they called the
Picts (the Painted Ones). Despite some spectacular bloodletting, the
Romans never really conquered the indigenous people in Scotland, and
the building of Hadrian’s Wall (well south of the current border with
England) effectively marked the northern limits of Rome’s influence.
Sometime before A.D. 500, however, the Irish Celtic tribes, called (how-
ever confusingly) “Scots,” began to successfully colonize the land, begin-
ning with western coastal areas nearest Northern Ireland, creating the
kingdom Dalriada.
The Dark and Middle Ages
The Celtic Scots and the Picts were united around 843, while pressures
of invasion from the south and Scandinavia helped mold Scotland into a
relatively cohesive unit. Under Malcolm II (1005–1034), tribes who occu-
pied the southwest and southeast parts of the Scottish mainland were
merged with the Scots and the Picts.
However small, Scotland’s terrain is full of lochs (not lakes; see “Braving
the Burr: Scottish English” for more local terminology), hills, rivers, 
and mountains; and they divide the territory very effectively. It can take
a long time to cover a small distance by foot, on horseback, or even in a
Part I: Introducing Scotland

Is that a chip I spy?
Scots are often mistaken to be English by foreigners. Any visitors should avoid that faux
pas. Scotland’s union with England in 1707 effectively relegated Scotland to little more
than an administrative region within Great Britain. Even though Edinburgh — called the
Athens of the North — has long been an intellectual center and Glasgow was the
“Second City” of the British Empire, many written histories of “Britain” tend to ignore
developments in Scotland. Even worse, in some cases, Scotland is treated with conde-
scension, which, in part, explains why Scots sometimes act as if they have terrible chips
on their shoulders.

modern car. Extended families or clans dominated regions, and the coun-
try was often preoccupied with the territorial battles of clan allegiances.
Some of Scotland’s most legendary heroes lived in the late 13th century,
particularly William Wallace (1270–1305), who drove the English out of
Perth and Stirling. Later, Robert the Bruce (1274–1329), crowned at
Scone in 1306, decisively defeated Edward II of England in 1314 at the
battle of Bannockburn, near Stirling.
In 1320, after decades of war against English invaders and occupiers,
barons loyal to Scottish King Robert the Bruce put their names on a
letter to the Pope, the Declaration of Arbroath. The letter not only
clearly affirmed the nation’s independence but also addressed notions of
freedom and liberty — abstract ideals that most countries didn’t con-
template for hundreds of years. In the 15th and 16th centuries, the royal
Stuart line was established, providing a succession of kings (and one
notable queen).
The Reformation
The passions of the Protestant Reformation arrived on an already turbu-
lent Scottish scene in the 16th century. The main protagonist was
undoubtedly John Knox, a devout disciple of the Geneva firebrand John
Calvin. Knox had a particular mixture of piety, conservatism, strict
morality, stubbornness, and intellectual independence that some see as
a pronounced feature of the Scottish character today.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 23
A few famous Scots
 Robert Burns (1759–1796): Scotland’s plowman poet, known in many languages and
countries
 Sir Alexander Fleming (1881–1955): Nobel Prize winner who discovered penicillin
 David Hume (1711–1776): Laid the foundation for intellectual and philosophical pur-
suits using the concept of secular morality
 David Livingstone (1813–1873): Medical missionary and African explorer who named
Victoria Falls on the Zambezi River
 Flora MacDonald (1725–1790): Key person in rescuing Bonnie Prince Charlie from
British troops after his defeat at Culloden
 John Muir (1834–1914): Pioneering conservationist who discovered California’s
Yosemite Valley and founded the Sierra Club
 Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832): Romantic novelist and poet who occupies a position
of preeminence in English literature
 Adam Smith (1723–1790): Author of The Wealth of Nations, which underpins the
modern science of economics

Knox helped shape the democratic form of the Scottish Church: Primary
among his tenets were provisions for a self-governing congregation,
including schools and schooling. Thus, Knox effectively encouraged 
literacy.
Knox vehemently opposed the reign of one of Scotland’s most famous
(and tragic) monarchs: Mary Queen of Scots (1542–1587). A Roman
Catholic Scot of French upbringing, Mary attempted to govern a land
(about which she knew little) in the throes of the Reformation.
Following some disastrous political and romantic alliances, Mary fled
Scotland and went to England, where she was jailed and eventually exe-
cuted on orders of her cousin Elizabeth I. Ironically, Mary’s son — James
VI of Scotland — succeeded the childless Elizabeth and became king of
England (James I) in 1603, thus uniting the Scottish and English crowns
(Wales had long since been absorbed by England) and creating a United
Kingdom. Scotland continued to have a Parliament of earls, barons, and
the like.
Union and the Jacobites
In the 17th century, Scotland’s sovereignty diminished, as Scottish roy-
alty spent most of its time in London. In 1689, the final Stuart monarch,
the staunchly Catholic James VII (and II of England) fled to France,
ending the rule of Scottish kings. In 1707, Scotland had little choice but
to merge with England in a constitutionally united Great Britain. This
union abolished the Scottish Parliament, and anyone loyal to the Stuarts
(known as the “Jacobites,” from the Latin for James) could only vainly
attempt to restore the Stuart line of royalty. But despite defeat in 1715,
the Jacobites didn’t give up.
Thirty years later, Charles Edward Stuart (the Young Pretender), better
known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, picked up the gauntlet. He was the cen-
tral figure in a 1745 revolt that nearly worked. Initially successful, starting
from the Highlands, Stuart and his supporters easily reached Derby, only
about 200km (125 miles) from London. The British capital was reportedly
in a panic. But Charlie and the Jacobites made an ill-conceived tactical
retreat to Scotland, where they were eventually crushed at the Battle of
Culloden, near Inverness. Charlie went on an infamous run, avoiding cap-
ture and eventually returning to France. His followers left behind in
Scotland weren’t so lucky, and a brutal crackdown ensued.
The Scottish Enlightenment and economic growth
During the 18th century, rapid progress in the emerging industrial age
produced prominent Scots who made broad and sweeping contributions
to practically all fields. The Scottish Enlightenment brought forward
important philosophers such as David Hume and Adam Smith. Many
industrial inventions that altered the history of the developing world,
such as the steam engine, were either invented or perfected by Scottish
genius and industry.

Scotland’s union with England and Wales began to reap dividends, and
the Scottish economy underwent a radical transformation. As trade with
British overseas colonies increased, the port of Glasgow, in particular,
flourished. Its merchants grew rich on the tobacco trade with Virginia
and the Carolinas.
The infamous Highland Clearances (1750–1850) expelled small farmers, or
crofters, from their ancestral lands to make way for sheep grazing, which
benefited the landowning class. Similarly, people in the Scottish Lowlands
were forcibly moved off the land. Increased industrialization and migration
into urban centers changed the national demographic forever, while a mas-
sive wave of emigration created a global Scottish Diaspora.
Edinburgh’s New Town was begun in the mid-1700s and today is a World
Heritage site recognized by the United Nations. Later, Victorian builders
turned Glasgow into a showcase of 19th-century architecture.
The 20th and 21st centuries
By the 1960s and 1970s, Scotland found that its industrial plants couldn’t
compete with the emerging manufacturing powerhouses of Asia and else-
where. A glimmer of light appeared on the Scottish economic horizon in
the 1970s: The discovery of North Sea oil lifted the British economy con-
siderably and became a source of irritation for independence-minded
Scots who saw most of the profits going south into England.
In 1997, under a newly elected Labour government in London, the
Scottish electorate was given a chance to vote on devolution — a fancy
word for limited sovereignty. The referendum passed, allowing Scotland
to have its own government and legislature for the first time since the
1707 union with England. The new Scottish Parliament, based in
Edinburgh, has limited taxing powers and can enact laws regarding
health, education, transportation, and public housing — but it has no
authority over matters of finance, defense, immigration, and foreign
policy. In 2007, the Scottish National Party, which strongly backs inde-
pendence for the nation, won the general election and formed the gov-
ernment in Edinburgh — much to the dismay of partisan unionists.
Taste of Scotland: Not just Haggis or Haddock
For too many years, restaurants in Scotland were known for boiled
meats and watery, overcooked vegetables. But in the past 20 years or so,
independent restaurants have displayed significant improvements in
culinary Scotland, where the best ingredients that the country produces
have been married with other styles and influences.
Let’s begin with traditional Scottish cooking, which is hearty. Staples
include fish (such as haddock, a fish similar to cod, which is often
smoked); potatoes (called tatties); turnips (called neeps); oatcakes;

porridge oats; local game, such as grouse or venison; and haggis, which
remains Scotland’s national dish — though it’s perhaps more symbolic
than gustatory.
But modern Scottish cuisine is more diverse and innovative, borrowing
from French and even Far Eastern techniques and using local produce
such as scallops or lamb. One of Scotland’s best-known food exports is
Aberdeen Angus beef, but equally fine is free-range Scottish lamb,
known for its tender, tasty meat. Fish, in this land of seas, rivers, and
lochs, is a mainstay, from wild halibut to the herring that’s transformed
into the elegant kipper (see the “Culinary lingo” sidebar, above).
Scottish smoked salmon is, of course, a delicacy known around the
globe. Scottish shellfish is world-class, whether oysters and crabs or
lobsters and their smaller relative, langoustines. Ranging from pheasant
and grouse to rabbit and venison, game also has a key spot in the
Scottish natural larder.
Scottish raspberries are among the finest in the world. You definitely
need to try some of Scotland’s excellent cheeses as well. One of the best
is Criffel, from the south of the country: a creamy and rich semisoft
cheese made from the milk of Shorthorn cows that graze only in organic
pastures. Delicious.
At your hotel or B&B, one meal you’re sure to enjoy is a Scottish break-
fast, or the full fry-up, as the locals may call it. Expect most or all of the
following: eggs, bacon and sausage, black pudding or haggis, grilled
tomatoes and mushrooms, fried bread or potato scones, toast, mar-
malade or jam, juice, and coffee or tea. A feast this size can often keep
you going right through the afternoon.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 27
Culinary lingo
Here are a few foods that you’re likely to come across in Scotland.
 black pudding: savory sausage of oats, blood, and spices
 bridie: meat and potato pie
 cullen skink: creamy smoked haddock chowder
 haggis: plump sausage of finely diced sheep offal (heart, liver, lungs, and so on),
oatmeal, and spices
 kippers: smoked herrings
 neep: turnip
 tattie: potato
 toastie: toasted sandwich

These days, the word “eclectic” describes Scotland’s metropolitan
restaurant scene, particularly in Edinburgh and Glasgow. Indian restau-
rants abound, as do French, Italian, and Thai options. In the rural areas,
the selection can be hit or miss; stick to my recommendations and you
should do just fine. Scots today can eat better than ever before,
although much of the population still seems to subsist on take-out fish
and chips or, as the locals prefer to call them, fish suppers.
Braving the Burr: Scottish English
Yes, English is spoken in Scotland, but with the local expressions, heavy
accents, and thick burr (trilling of the letter “r”), it can occasionally
sound like a foreign language. Don’t worry; at times even Scots from one
region of the nation don’t know what someone from another area is
saying.
The standard joke about England and Scotland being “two countries
divided by a common language” applies. Signatures of Scottish English
include rolling of the letter “r” and “ch” taking a hard throaty sound (like
the Hebrew challah). Plus, there are a whole different set of phrases and
expressions.
Gaelic and Scots
In early history, the prevailing tongue across western and northern
Scotland was a Celtic language, Gaelic. In certain areas of the Highlands
and Islands, it is still quite common to hear conversations in Gaelic
(which rhymes with garlic, rather that the Irish gay-lick). Northumbrian
English was introduced from the south, and the language known as
Lowland Scottish, or Scots, then developed; Scots borrowed from Gaelic,
Scandinavian dialects, Dutch, and French.
After the royal court moved to England in 1603, Scottish people who
didn’t still speak Gaelic mostly used a vernacular English, the language
of their beloved Bible. Meanwhile, the Scots language was looked upon
as a rather awkward, coarse tongue. In the 18th century, English also
became the language of university instruction. By the end of the 20th
century, TV and radio had begun to dilute further the more pronounced
burrs and lilts of the Scottish accent. However, the dialect and speech
patterns of the people in Scotland remain rich.
Gaelic, while not widely spoken, is certainly far from dead — particularly
in such places as the Western Isles, where about 60 percent of the popu-
lation still speak it. Even public-affairs TV in Scotland airs a few pro-
grams in the language (with subtitles for those of us completely
befuddled by Gaelic).

In Glasgow, Glaswegians (which is what the residents are called) tend to
be very friendly toward tourists. There’s no need to feel intimidated by
their heavy accents and colorful local expressions. Be patient and ask
those you don’t understand to repeat themselves or to slow down. And
if someone says to you, “Hi, how ye dae’in?” Reply with, “I canna com-
plain.” You just may be mistaken for a local — for a minute, anyway.
To save you from having to maintain one of those polite but puzzled
smiles on your face while talking to locals, review this handy glossary of
some common words from both Gaelic and Scots as well as some stan-
dard British English substitutions for North American English.
Pub Life in Scotland
Much of the socializing in Scotland centers on the local pub. The pub’s
more than a watering hole. It can be the gathering place for an entire
community, the key place where the locals go to share news and
exchange gossip. At certain pubs, pickup sessions of traditional and folk
music are common.
Even if you’re not a big drinker, going out for a pint of lager, a dram of
whisky, or even just a bite to eat at a Scottish howff can be a memorable
part of your trip, as you’re almost guaranteed to meet real Scots.

Don’t tip the bar staff: You’ll immediately be identified as an outsider,
and your generosity won’t get you a free round of drinks, either. On the
issue of rounds, it’s quite common for individuals in groups to buy a
round for everyone at the table during any drinking session. It’s consid-
ered bad manners if you never take your turn to buy a round but get a
drink at every other round. Alternatively, you can beg out when anyone
asks if you want another drink before they order the round, drink at
your own pace, and buy only your own.
Join ’em for a pint of beer
The most widely available, mass-produced Scottish beers are Tennents
lager and McEwens ale, but from region to region, you may find a
number of local breweries, making anything from light-colored lagers to
dark ales. Among them, Deuchars IPA, Black Isle Organic Blonde, and
Orkney’s Dark Island are standouts. The most popular stout remains
Guinness, from neighboring Ireland, while the potent Stella Artois, from
the Continent, is the best-selling premium lager.
Traditionally, the strength of Scottish ale (as distinct from lager) is
labeled by shillings (for example, Belhaven 80/–). The higher the
number, the stronger the beer. Today, with cask-conditioned ales, the
bar can tell you the alcohol content, ABV: Four is standard, six is strong.
Remember, practically all beer in Scotland has higher alcohol content
than any sold in North America. And that even goes for familiar
American brands such as Budweiser. So, take it easy.
Whisky galore
If you’re in Scotland (or almost anywhere in Europe), you don’t need to
identify it as Scotch whisky. Most connoisseurs prefer varieties of single
malt whisky, the taste of which depends largely on where it’s distilled:
sweet Lowland, peaty Island, or smooth and balanced Highland. Single
malts are seen as sipping whiskies and should never be served with ice
or diluted with anything other than a few drops of tap water. If you want
a cocktail made with whisky, expect it to be a well-known blend, such as
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
30
A bit of whisky terminology
Scotland is home to a host of whisky experts, and, in case you meet some, here are a
few helpful terms to keep in mind.
 dram: A shot of spirits (usually whisky), roughly 35 milliliters or about an ounce
 neat: Whisky served without ice or water
 nip: A whisky chaser to a pint of beer
 usige beatha (ooshka bay): Water of life; the Gaelic for the word whisky

Famous Grouse or Bell’s, and not single malt, such as Glemorangie or
Laphroaig. If you want a North American bourbon, rye, or sour-mash
whiskey, you need to name the brand: for example, Jack Daniels or
Maker’s Mark.
If you’re ordering whisky, simply ask for a “wee dram” and the bar-
tender may think you’ve been drinking in Scotland your whole life.
Again, the established way to drink the spirit is neat — that is, nothing
added. But some say a few drops of tap water bring out the aroma and
flavor.
Other cocktail concoctions
If you order a mixed drink (such as a gin and tonic), don’t be surprised if
the barkeep hands you one glass with a little ice and the alcohol inside,
and, to the side, a small bottle of mixer. That’s just how it’s done. Also, note
that the expression “fresh orange” usually means bottled orange juice.
Tuning Your Ear to Scottish Music
Scottish music is considerably more than “Scotland the Brave” played
on bagpipes, although you may well hear that during your stay.
The Gaelic-influenced songs and sounds of the Hebridean Islands and
the Highlands have been around for centuries. The fiddle, accordion,
flute, and Celtic drum are all part of the musical tradition. The best
chance to hear the real deal is at a jam session in a pub or at a more
formal (but still fun) social dance, called a ceilidh (kay-lee). Bagpipes
and the rousing, indeed ear-shattering, sounds they can create are
entrenched in the national identity and culture of Scotland.
Every summer, Glasgow hosts an international piping competition that
draws thousands of pipers (many of whom also perform as part of
Edinburgh’s Military Tattoo, a show featuring music, marching, and mili-
tary exercises).
But a lone piper may pop up anytime, anywhere. Once on a misty late-
summer’s day at the Highland Monument to Bonnie Prince Charlie in
Glenfinnan, I saw one suddenly begin blowing on a nearby hillside. No
kidding.
Visiting Golf’s Hallowed Ground
Golf may have originated in mainland Europe (or China, according to
some accounts), but Scotland at least gets the full credit for developing
the sport and codifying its rules. Golf has been played here for more
than 500 years. In places such as eastern Fife or North Ayrshire, you’re
almost as likely to see someone knocking a golf ball around a park as
you are to see kids playing basketball in a Los Angeles playground.
Chapter 2: Digging Deeper into Scotland 31

If you need a caddy, don’t be surprised if he isn’t young — the average
age of a golf caddy here is about 50. Don’t expect courses to provide
motorized carts (although they’re popping up more and more). Finally,
please do not play a championship course if you’re a beginner or even an
intermediate.
Visitors (men and women) can play on all public and most private-
members courses (Chapter 21 lists ten of the best), but at the exclusive
clubs, members receive priority for tee times. Many courses have dress
codes, so play it safe and wear a shirt with a collar, long pants, and
proper golf shoes if you’re heading to the links.
Exploring Scotland’s Great Outdoors
Scotland has long had world-class fishing, while its sailing, hill-walking
and hiking are first rate, too. If you’re an angler, Scotland doesn’t require
a national license to fish. Instead, you buy permits locally at bait-and-
tackle shops and post offices, or request permission from landowners.
Areas for anglers are often marked and say where you can obtain a
license or permission. Local tourism offices can usually provide you
with more information.
The hiking in Scotland can take you through wooded glens, beach dunes,
or windswept mountains. Trail markings range from clear to non-
existent. It never hurts to have a detailed map and compass. If you’re
going someplace extreme, tell someone where you’ll be hiking and when
you expect to be back.
If you’re walking in the Highlands, you must take all the precautions that
you would if you were climbing in much higher Alpine conditions. The
weather can change dramatically in a short period of time.
As for the wildlife, in the right seasons, the marshes of Scotland teem
with migratory birds, the seas offer whale-watching, and the Highlands
boast eagle-nesting sites. This side of the tourism business is just begin-
ning to catch on, as is “Green Tourism.” The tourist board now gives out
recommendations for those hotels that it considers environmentally
friendly.

Movies and Books
If you’re looking to find out more about Scotland than just what’s in this
book, you have a variety of films and books at your disposal. The follow-
ing sections list some suggestions.

Films
The ten films listed below are among the best and/or most popular made
about Scotland and its people.
 Braveheart (1995): This movie — hardly historically accurate but
often moving nonetheless — probably did more to stir overseas
interest in Scotland than any promotional campaign ever cooked up
by the tourist board. Mel Gibson stars as the 13th-century patriot
William Wallace in this sweeping Academy Award–winning epic.
 Gregory’s Girl (1981): A simple comedy about an awkward high
school student (played by gawky John Gordon-Sinclair) in a
modern (and mostly hideous) 20th-century New Town near
Glasgow. Quirky but loveable.
 I Know Where I’m Going! (1945): This is a charming, funny WWII-
era black-and-white film from the great British team of Powell and
Pressburger. It takes a young English fiancée on a suspenseful,
romantic adventure to the Isle of Mull.
 Local Hero (1983): In this sweetly eclectic comedy, villagers on a
gorgeous stretch of Scottish coastline (mostly filmed near Mallaig)
expect to cash in big time because of Texan oil-industry interest.
But events conspire against greed.
 My Name is Joe (1998): Although not entirely lacking humor and
romance, this film paints a rather grim, if generally accurate, pic-
ture of Glaswegians struggling with their addictions and inner
demons.
 Orphans (1997): Actor Peter Mullan (star of My Name is Joe) wrote
and directed this outlandish and very, very dark comedy with lots
of foul language about the day the Flynn family in Glasgow tried to
bury their recently deceased mother.
 The 39 Steps (1935): Director Alfred Hitchcock and scriptwriter
Charles Bennett almost completely reset John Buchan’s tale of
spies and intrigue. Instead of sticking to the Borders, the film trans-
ports the hero to the Highlands. Good idea.
 Trainspotting (1996): Based one of the most popular contempo-
rary books by Scottish author Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting is the
gritty and often hilarious account of a group of unrepentant drug-
addled characters in Edinburgh in the 1980s.
 Whisky Galore (1949): Retitled Tight Little Island in America, this
classic movie is based on a true story. The residents of a small and
remote Scottish island get an intoxicating windfall when a ship car-
rying 50,000 cases of whisky crashes off their coast during WWII.
 The Wicker Man (1973): A cult classic of cinema about a strange
New Age community on a picturesque Scottish isle — and the
secrets they keep from a mainland constable of the law.
Occasionally silly but the climax is spectacular.

Books
There are too many books about Scotland to mention, so I’ve chosen to
highlight my favorites in three main categories: biography, fiction, and
history.
Biography
 Bonnie Prince Charlie (Canongate, 1989), by Fitzroy Maclean, tells
the tale of one of the most romantic royal characters in Scottish
history.
 The Life of Robert Burns (Canongate Classics, 1998), by Catherine
Carswell, is the groundbreaking look at the life of Scotland’s
national poet. First published in the 1930s, Carswell’s assessment
was so frank — particularly regarding the poet’s romantic and
sexual liaisons — that many took offense.
 Robert Louis Stevenson: A Biography (HarperCollins, 2005), by
Claire Harman, follows the trail of the frail adventurer and world-
famous author, from his Edinburgh birthplace to Europe and finally
to his last home in the South Pacific.
 The Sound of Sleat: A Painter’s Life (Picador, 1999), by Jon
Schueler, is a remarkable autobiography by American-born abstract
impressionist Schueler, who found his muse in the land and espe-
cially the sky of Scotland. He even made a second home near the
Western Highland port of Mallaig.
Fiction
 The Heart of Midlothian (Penguin Classics), by Sir Walter Scott,
was declared a masterpiece in 1818 and remains Scott’s seminal
piece of fiction, influencing the later works of such authors as
Balzac, Hawthorne, and Dickens.
 Kidnapped (Penguin Classics), by Robert Louis Stevenson, follows
the adventures of young David Balfour after he’s spirited out of
Edinburgh and ends up on the wrong side of the law in the Western
Highlands. The story is as entertaining today as it was upon publi-
cation in 1886.
 Lanark: A Life in Four Books (Pub Group West, 2003), by Alasdair
Gray, is perhaps the most important contemporary novel published
in Scotland in the last 100 years. Gray is an eccentric of the first
order, but this work of fiction (first published in 1981 and illus-
trated by the author, too), despite some fantastical detours, gets to
the core of urban Scotland.
 The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (Perennial Classics, 1999), by
Muriel Spark, and Trainspotting (W. W. Norton & Company, 1996),
by Irvine Welsh, are both better known for their cinematic adapta-
tions, but in their own very different ways, both novels manage to
capture elements of Edinburgh life.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
34

History
 Scotland: A New History (Pimlico, 1992), by Michael Lynch, is a
good take on Scottish history from ancient times up to the 1990s.
 The Scottish Enlightenment: The Scots’ Invention of the Modern
World (Crown, 2001), by American historian Arthur Herman, offers
a clear and extremely readable explanation of the impact that
Scottish thinkers had on the world.
 The Scottish Nation: 1700–2000 (Penguin, 2001), by academic
Tom Devine, is a good, recently published historical overview of
Scotland. Devine is one of the few historians to examine how
people were driven from the Scottish Lowlands, as well as more
famous and lamentable clearances from the Highlands.
 Stone Voices: The Search for Scotland (Hill & Wang, 2003), by
Neal Ascherson, is a quest for the national character of Scotland. In
a series of anecdotes and reflections, journalist Ascherson helps
readers understand the worthy sentiments behind Scottish inde-
pendence and begins to redress the imbalance of Scottish histories
so often written by the English.

Deciding Where 
and When to Go
In This Chapter
 Looking at Scotland’s terrain, main cities, and major regions
 Evaluating when to go, season by season
 Anticipating Scotland’s changeable weather
 Planning for festivals and events
T
he next time you meet people who’ve recently been to Scotland, ask
them what the place is like, and they may well give you a wistful, far-
away look. That’s because the country has the potential for magical
experiences. With the history and contemporary culture of Edinburgh
and Glasgow, the Highlands’ and Islands’ breathtakingly raw scenery,
and some of the friendliest English-speaking people in the world,
Scotland is bound to leave fond memories. From urban chic to ancient
castles, from misty glens to craggy coastlines, Scotland is a dream 
(as well as dreamy) destination.
But the success of a Scottish vacation can depend on where and when
you go. This chapter has my advice and insight on when to travel —
from an evaluation of the regions covered in this book to the skinny
about the seasons — so that you can more easily determine the best
way to spend your Scottish vacation.
Let’s start with a geographic breakdown of the country, in order to give
you a better idea of what the various regions have to offer and how long
you may want to stay in each — especially given your particular inter-
ests and travel budget. Then I’ll address the weather. Finally, check out
the calendar of events at the end of the chapter. Remember: Good plan-
ning should ensure that certain factors — whether short winter days 
or not giving yourself enough time to see the big attractions — don’t
prevent you from having a great experience.

Going Everywhere You Want to Be
The first thing to understand about Scotland is this: It may be a small
country, but it’s divided by mountains, rivers, and lochs, especially up
north. Most roads don’t travel in straight lines. So, although the mileage
may seem short, your travels across the country can — and possibly
will — take longer than expected. But slow down and enjoy the ride.
Scotland’s biggest topographical feature is the Highlands. Its boundary
runs roughly diagonally across the country, from the southwest to the
northeast. If you draw a straight line, west to east (say from the Isle of
Mull to the River Tay), you will go from rocky islands and distinctive
mountain terrain to gentle moorland and rolling hills of the upper
Lowlands.
Any division of Scotland into distinct regions is bound to be a bit arbi-
trary: There’s often no clean line to divide one area from another. I’ve
done my best to present the regions accurately and logically. But some-
times that means my geographic breakdown of the country doesn’t
match what you’ll get from, say, local governments or the Scottish
tourist board. For example, I group the Isle of Mull with the other 
islands of the Hebrides (Chapter 19). VisitScotland — the national
tourist board — lumps the Isle of Mull into a broad region stretching
well across the country (which I think is a mistake). I highlight places
where there are similar discrepancies and possible confusion.
For more information on the country’s cities and regions, check out Part
III, which discusses Scotland’s two major cities of Edinburgh and
Glasgow, and Part IV, which has the lowdown on major regions in the
country. The mainland areas are introduced from south to north, start-
ing with the Borders and southwest regions and finishing with the
Highlands. Finally, I finish with chapters on Scotland’s western and
northern islands.
Edinburgh and Glasgow
Let’s face it: Many, and possibly most, visitors to Scotland never get any
farther than the country’s two principal cities. And that’s okay. They’re
excellent destinations in their own right, and from them travelers can
take side trips to get at least a sampling of Scotland’s other charms (see
Chapter 13).
Although only a 50-minute train ride apart, Edinburgh (see Chapter 11)
and Glasgow (see Chapter 12) are notably different but equally fasci-
nating and culturally rich. Think of them as the McCartney and Lennon
of Scotland, making their own unique contributions and creating a
dynamic duo.
Edinburgh (eddin-burra, with a short “e” as in “Edward”) is the capital of
Scotland. It has a historic Old Town as well as a New Town — albeit one
whose beginnings are actually older than the founding of the United
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 37

States. As the second most popular tourist destination in the whole of
Great Britain (London is the first, of course), Edinburgh and its charms
are internationally recognized, as is the city’s annual summer arts festi-
vals. In addition, it boasts a striking cityscape — a castle on a hill being
just one of several noteworthy landmarks — as well as the royal Palace
of Holyroodhouse.
Glasgow (glazz-go) is older than Edinburgh but appears more modern
these days. Traditionally viewed as a working-class industrial metropo-
lis, Glasgow thrived as the “Second City” of the British Empire in the
18th and 19th centuries, and today it offers the best concentration of
Victorian architecture in the U.K. After an economic decline in the 20th
century and a reputation (deservedly or not) of crime, grime, and gang-
sters, Glasgow emerged in the 1980s and 1990s as the cultural hot spot
of Scotland, boasting leading artists and best-selling indie rock bands.
Southern Scotland
The southernmost regions of Scotland are the Borders, aptly named
because it borders Northumberland in northern England; and Dumfries
and Galloway, which stretch southwest along the Solway Firth (which
clearly divides England and Scotland) to the Irish Sea. These regions cer-
tainly have their own allure and attractions, whether Abbotsford, Sir
Walter Scott’s mansion, or the Logan Botanic Gardens, with its sub-
tropical plants. The town of Dumfries (dum-freece) was the final home of
the national poet Robert Burns (1759–96), and around the village of
Melrose, the ruins of ancient abbeys commissioned by King David I in
the 12th century can be found. If you have time for an extended stay,
both regions merit a few days of exploring. Alternatively, some of the
Southern Scotland highlights can be seen on side-trips from either
Edinburgh or Glasgow. (See Chapter 14 for more information on both the
Borders and Dumfries and Galloway.)
Ayrshire and Argyll
Ayrshire (air-shyer) is the long and primarily coastal region southwest
of Glasgow, best known for its associations with Robert Burns: The
region offers most of the landmarks and attractions associated with the
great plowman poet. But Ayrshire is also home to some of the best links-
style golf courses in Scotland, if not the world. Argyll (ar-guile) encom-
passes the central west coast of Scotland, its remote peninsulas, and the
southernmost islands, such as Gigha or Islay, where much of the coun-
try’s famous whisky is made. This is the heart of the ancient Kingdom of
Dalriada, where the first Celtic people settled in the 5th century and also
a region where Norse colonies were established until the 13th century.
If you have time, the scenic Kintyre Peninsula and the isle of Arran
(sometimes described as Scotland in miniature) can be worth including
on your itinerary, as well as the port of Oban (oh-bin), the gateway to
the Hebrides, and Inveraray, on the shores of Loch Fyne. But even if you
don’t have time to explore the region fully, you would be remiss to skip
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
38

such places as Culzean Castle, which is close enough to make a good
day trip from Glasgow. (See Chapter 15 for more information on both
Ayrshire and Argyll.)
Fife and the Trossachs
North of Edinburgh, across the Firth of Forth, is the ancient Kingdom of
Fife; moving west across the country takes in the historic city of Stirling
and the Trossach mountains — rather like the Highlands only smaller,
less dramatic, and more wooded. Fife is a reasonably compact area and
is perhaps best known for the town of St. Andrews. Golfers make the pil-
grimage here from all over the world, but it is also a pretty great little
east-coast college town, with Scotland’s first university (and the third
oldest in Great Britain after Oxford and Cambridge). Another golf mecca
lies inland: the famous Gleneagles resort, with its first-class hotel and
perhaps the best restaurant in Scotland, Restaurant Andrew Fairlie, at
Gleneagles.
History buffs will enjoy a visit to the town of Stirling, with its castle, Old
Town wall, and picturesque monument to William Wallace (of Braveheart
fame). The Trossachs are the old stamping grounds of the legendary Rob
Roy and provided the setting for Walter Scott’s romantic poetry. Like
some landmarks in Ayrshire, highlights of Fife, Stirling, and the
Trossachs — including the famously bonnie, bonnie banks of Loch
Lomond — can be covered in day trips from Edinburgh and Glasgow.
(All of this is discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.)

Glossary of place names
Picture this: You’re passing through a quaint Highland town with an even quainter name,
such as Altnacraig or Invercharan. Wonder what it means? Many towns incorporate
Gaelic words for geographical and topographical features. Use this glossary to mix and
match parts of names to get closer to their meanings.
 alt: stream
 ben: mountain
 brae: hill
 craig: rock
 drum: ridge
 dun: hill fort
 eilean: island
 firth: estuary or long narrow bay
 glen: valley
 inver: river mouth
 loch: fresh-water lake or large salt-
water inlet
 mor: great
 ness: cape

Tayside and Northeast Scotland
North of Fife and east of the Highlands are the River Tay and the city of
Dundee. A bit farther north, on the eastern side of Scotland, are the
Grampian Mountains, Royal Deeside (home of the monarchy’s retreat
at Balmoral castle), and the now oil-rich city of Aberdeen. I have put
them all together in my chapter on Tayside and the Northeast. The
region offers castles, whisky distilleries, and handsome countryside.
(For details on this area, flip to Chapter 17.)
The Highlands
The Scottish Highlands represent a huge and justifiable tourist draw.
For better or for worse, however, the area’s best-known attraction is still
a mythical creature swimming in the waters of Loch Ness. Yes, the loch
is a big, dark, and brooding body of water. But it’s not the best thing
about the Highlands. You’re not likely to see any monster and may feel
that the place has elements of a tourist trap, so see it if you must, but
then move on. The official capital of the Highlands is the small city of
Inverness. Although it’s not particularly exciting, it has some good
guesthouses and restaurants and an excellent theater/cinema complex
(Eden Court). Plus the city provides a good jumping-off spot for explor-
ing the Black Isle or other parts of the nearby Highlands.
But for my money, the craggy Western Highlands are the real attraction,
and perhaps even the proverbial soul of Scotland. Steeped in proud lore
and sad tragedy, from the Jacobite uprising to the massacre of Glen Coe,
the scenery is ultimately what will leave an indelible mark on your
memory. The mountains are ancient and rise from the sea with utter
majesty; the beach sands on the “Road to the Isles,” west of Fort
William, near Mallaig, are brilliantly white and unspoiled. Villages, such
as Plockton, look like picture postcards, set near the sea in the shadow
of nearby peaks. North of the port of Ullapool, the country is beautifully
desolate and sparsely populated, and Cape Wrath feels like the end of
the earth. (The Highlands are discussed at length in Chapter 18.)

Not quite ready for prime time
This book doesn’t cover every part of Scotland. The northernmost areas of the main-
land, and towns such as Tongue, Wick, and Scrabster, aren’t addressed at all. My apolo-
gies for that, especially to any surfers among the readership: The north coast is a mecca
for those seeking new breakers. Most of the Scottish islands are uninhabited, and only
60 are larger than about 8 sq. km (3 sq. miles). Unfortunately, I don’t have adequate space
for isles such as Jura or Tiree. Sorry. I’ve also kept the chapter on Shetland and Orkney
concise, and I don’t go into too many specifics about Aberdeenshire and Moray. I believe
these are destinations for long-term visitors — or for travelers with specific interests.
If you want to visit an uninhabited island or spend time in a location not adequately dealt
with in Scotland For Dummies, please visit a tourist information center.

The Hebridean Islands
If you have time to conquer part of the Highlands, you should also make
a point to visit at least one of the country’s many, many islands off the
west and northwest coastline of Scotland. The Hebrides (heb-rid-eez) is
a vast archipelago of some 600 islands, including large inhabited islands
and lots of small, uninhabited ones. Worth the ferry trip — and possibly
an overnight stay or two — are such islands as Mull and its little sister
Iona, an ancient landmark of Celtic Christianity in Scotland. North of
there, the Isle of Skye is the biggest island of the Inner Hebrides; it’s
the most accessible (thanks to a land bridge as well as ferry service),
and it’s arguably the most scenic (though you’ll get into arguments over
that claim).
If you’re feeling more adventurous, then head out to the wind-swept,
225km-long (140-mile) chain of islands known as the Outer Hebrides:
islands such as Lewis (my home), Harris, or the Uists. Here, at the most
northwesterly part of Europe, you’ll find desolate moors, rocky coast-
lines, amazing white-sand beaches with grassy dunes, impossibly blue
seas, and prehistoric standing stones — and a lot of the time you’ll have
them pretty much to yourself. Alternatively, the time-strapped traveler
can make a day trip to Eigg from the port village of Arisaig. (Turn to
Chapter 19 for more details on the Hebrides.)
Shetland and Orkney islands
The far northern island chains of Shetland and Orkney are remote and
rural. Unless you specifically have the time and inclination, they may not
be worth the trouble to visit. On the other hand, they feature some
nearly unparalleled archaeological sites, while their very remoteness
makes them a welcome reprieve from the more trodden tourist trail.
(They’re discussed briefly in Chapter 20.)
Scheduling Your Time
Many visitors are tempted to try and see everything — especially the
curious and ambitious ones. Good luck. Alas, in the frantic effort to “do
it all,” you can miss as much as you see. Plus, you’ll just be exhausted at
the end of it all.
This book covers most of the country and gives you itineraries that take
you from one side of Scotland to the other and back again. But if your
time is limited, you should consider simply staying in Edinburgh and
Glasgow, which have plenty to offer, and using them as bases for any
excursions. Chapter 13 and the first chapters of Part IV are full of attrac-
tions within striking distance of the region’s two biggest cities.
Of course, the Highlands and Islands are spectacular. But if you don’t
fancy the idea of sleeping in a different bed every night, find a location
that offers a variety of sights to see and things to do in the vicinity of
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 41

Part I: Introducing Scotland 
42
other places you want to visit. For example, from the pretty seaside vil-
lage of Arisaig, you can easily get to Skye, see Glenfinnan and Fort
William to the east, or go south to Movern and Ardnamurchan.
If you don’t see it all in one go, then you’ll just have to plan a return 
trip — or use this book to vicariously experience the bits you missed.
Mild (if damp) weather, thanks to the Gulf Stream
In contrast to continental Europe, Scotland is spared real extremes in
weather, largely thanks to the effects of the Gulf Stream (sometimes
known as the North Atlantic Drift), which sweeps up from the Caribbean.
No matter what time of year you choose to visit Scotland, however,
chances are slim that you’ll make it back home without some Scottish
raindrops falling on your head. Always have a waterproof coat handy.
While the weather is occasionally wet, temperatures rarely fall below
freezing (particularly in these days of climate change), except on moun-
tain tops.
Certain places in Scotland certainly get more rain than others. For exam-
ple, the Isle of Mull in the west is notoriously prone to precipitation,
while the Moray coast in the northeast is probably the most consistently
sunny spot. After living here more than ten years, I can assure you that
you never know: A recent summer was a washout in Glasgow and
Edinburgh, while on the Western Isles it was one of the driest in memory.
Scotland is reasonably cool year-round (see Table 3-1). However, global
warming is causing average temperatures to rise. While a few summer
weeks can see temperatures rise above 27°C (80°F), it is usually between
about 16°C and 21°C (60s°F). In the colder months, there is not much
risk of getting frostbite, except on mountaintops and during occasional
cold snaps.

Here comes the sun
The amount of daylight varies greatly in Scotland’s northern latitudes.
The price paid for long, languid days during the summer is long, dark
nights during winter. If you depend upon natural light to see the sights
that you’re most interested in, visiting from May through September
allows you to take advantage of the longer days.

Before you leave home, get up-to-date weather forecasts on the Internet.
The Web site www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/uk/st/st_forecast_
weather.html — run by the U.K. Meteorological Office — is a good
source for the latest information on current conditions and has reason-
ably accurate forecasts.
Revealing the Secrets of the Seasons
You’ve probably heard about Scottish weather. The Scots like to joke
about getting “four seasons in one day.” But weather isn’t the only con-
sideration to consider when planning your trip. The high season brings
crowds, and the low season carries the possibility of some attractions
and hotels being closed. Each season boasts certain advantages and
drawbacks, which I share in this section.
Summer
The most popular and possibly best time to tour Scotland is summer,
when the country is geared to receive tourists and the weather’s usually
(though not always) drier and warmer than at other times of the year.
For the unsure traveler, traveling in the summer is your best bet; you’ll
have lots of company and plenty of leads to follow.
The upside
In the summer, all attractions, hotels, and restaurants — no matter how
remote — are open. All tourist information centers are open, too —
some seven days a week, and a few don’t close until well into the
evening hours.
Summer’s the busiest tourist season, but crowds aren’t always a bad
thing. Streets teeming with people may actually enhance your trip.
Scotland’s a friendly place, so throwing a ton of visitors into the mix can
create a spirited atmosphere. Plus, the Edinburgh International Festival
and Edinburgh Festival Fringe combine to create one of the biggest
annual cultural events in Europe every August.
The days are long during this time of year. In fact, if you’re in the far
north, the sun never really appears to set. Even down in Edinburgh, sun-
light lasts well into the evening; and, on the west coast you can discern a
glimmer of fading light as late as 11:30 p.m. Of course, the sun rises
about 4:30 a.m., too.
The weather? Well, if you’ve got your heart set on fine and dry weather;
if you’re allergic (either physically or emotionally) to drizzle, fog, or rain;
or if it’s your tan that you want to work on, then don’t go to Scotland.
The place is rarely balmy. Instead, summer conditions can be comfort-
ably warm and breezy during the day and drop to light-sweater tempera-
ture at night. You will likely get caught in some rain, especially on the
islands, in June, July, or August.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 43

The downside
During the summer, tourists can overwhelm many popular attractions
and towns. The influx of visitors, especially in Edinburgh from late July
to early September, may mean that hotels don’t have any available
rooms for last-minute travelers. Plus, normally quiet villages, such as
Pitlochry or Plockton, start to resemble Fifth Avenue, with crowds pour-
ing off tour buses. If you’re craving a break from the masses, summer
may not be the time to come to Scotland, unless you plan to travel to the
country’s extremities.
Seasonal rates are another downside to visiting in the summer:
Accommodations can be more expensive than in other seasons. For
many travelers, the worst thing about summer in the Western Highlands
and Islands is the midges (mid-gees) — flying, blood-sucking no-see-um
bugs that can drive you to serious distraction and leave a plethora of
tiny but itchy bites. Make sure you have netting and some effective bug
spray if you’re coming to these parts in the summer.
Summers on the western islands can be quite rainy because they take
the brunt of the prevailing trade winds. The consistently best times to
visit this region are usually May or September, when dry periods are
more prevalent, although the temperature may be a tad cooler.
Fall
Fall, which Scots know only as autumn, is probably the most underrated
time to visit Scotland. The weather can be quite good, with a strong pos-
sibility of sunny, dry stretches. Even when it’s stormy, the weather
fronts often move through quickly. Mild days without too much rain, and
daylight extending to at least 8 p.m. (until the clocks go back), are great
for marathon sightseeing.
The upside
Beginning in mid-September, the high season has run its course and
prices begin to fall. Everything is less crowded. The pubs and restau-
rants belong to the locals again as they reclaim their turf from the
tourist hordes. In autumn, you’re more likely to find bars — especially in
Edinburgh — filled with locals rather than with tourists.
Days remain reasonably long, and if you’re traveling in the west, the
midges usually get knocked back by the first cool nights (what a relief).
In rural areas, trees may begin to change color toward the end of fall,
and with the sun lower in the sky, the natural light can be magical.
The downside
The more seasonal and far-flung attractions, as well as some tourist
offices, begin to shut down or at least restrict their hours in the fall.
Winterlike weather can set in quickly at the end of autumn.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
44

Autumn may mean fewer tourists, but plenty of people still travel this
time of year. Autumn nights in Scotland can start to be surprisingly cool;
and a few guesthouses don’t have great central heating, so you may end
up buried in blankets. In the Highlands, you may even experience a light
frost or snow flurry.
Winter
Conditions aren’t ideal, but Scottish winters are quite a bit less severe 
than you may assume. Anyone visiting from Idaho, Illinois, or Pennsylvania
will find them mild, in fact. From November through March, the main cities
function normally, and golf along the southwest coast remains a lure. Days
can be very short, however, and some tourist attractions, as well as inns 
in the countryside, may be closed until springtime.
The upside
Prices are at their lowest all across the country in the winter, and you’re
likely to find the cheapest airfares of the year. Because it’s the least pop-
ular time to travel, more special rates and package deals are offered.
Places like the Outer Hebrides offer a real escape from “civilization” and
people, if that’s what you’re after.
The exceptions to general winter travel bargains are the weeks of
Christmas and New Year’s, when accommodations rates equal those of
the high summer season.
If you dislike crowds, winter’s the best time for you to see Scotland. It’s
also a good time to visit museums, galleries, and year-round attractions.
And the landscape is almost as beautiful as during the full swing of
summer.
For snowboarding and skiing, a few resorts offer adequate facilities in
the Highlands. If golf is your bag, then head for the links courses in
Ayrshire. They’re sandy and drain well, allowing play through the
season.
The downside
The winter weather can be driech (Scottish slang for gloomy and wet).
It’s predictably cool, rainy, and windy from January through March. The
temperature rarely dips to extreme lows and snowfalls aren’t as heavy
as they used to be, but blizzards can still hit on occasion. The sun usu-
ally doesn’t rise until 9:30 a.m., and then it’s gone by 4 p.m.
Attractions can be shuttered every winter, and lots of places have
shorter hours during the winter months. Many rural hotels, B&Bs, and
restaurants close for the season as well. This reduced activity is all
because tourism slows to a crawl. You still can find plenty of things to
do, but you’ll have fewer tourist highlights than in the other seasons.
Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 45

Spring
Spring can start slowly in Scotland, and even in May, the weather can
still feel rather wintry at times. But the days quickly lengthen, and some
people consider this to be the ideal time to travel in Scotland.
The upside
Warming temperatures (however slowly) and longer days combine to
make for promising conditions for touring the countryside. The ground
is carpeted in spring greenery, and the plants are beginning their dis-
plays (the rhododendrons, in particular, are breathtaking Mar–May).
Rain showers are often isolated, and they may last only part of the day.
By the time spring rolls around, the tourist industry has had its break
and is ready to resume playing host. Country inns and travel information
offices reopen, but because the high season hasn’t hit yet, crowds are
manageable.
The downside
Scotland can remain pretty rainy from March through June, and a snow
flurry or two isn’t unusual in March or April. Nights remain cool even if
days are warming up, so packing for the weather can be a chore.
Easter traditionally marks the beginning of the high season, so prices
start to go up at that point. But these days, foreign visitors start flooding
in (especially to Edinburgh) before that magic date, so it looks as if the
tourist season is stretching beyond its normal boundaries.
Perusing a Calendar of Events
Scotland certainly has its share of annual festivals and special events
throughout the year, with the centerpiece being Edinburgh — which
holds several simultaneous festivals in August. Highland games are held
in most regions from summer to early autumn. Where possible, I include

Chapter 3: Deciding Where and When to Go 49

August
The cultural highlight of Edinburgh’s year comes every August during
what is collectively called the Edinburgh Festival. It is actually a few
concurrent festivals. Since it began in 1947, the flagship Edinburgh
International Festival has attracted artists and performance companies
of the highest caliber in classical music, opera, ballet, or theater.
Running simultaneously is the now much bigger Edinburgh Festival
Fringe, and it alone encompasses some 1,800 performances in a cultural
bonanza, drawing major talent — especially comics — from around the
world. Edinburgh also hosts the Edinburgh International Book Festival
and the Edinburgh Jazz & Blues Festival (see events listing for June), at
about the same time. For information on all the Edinburgh festivals, visit
www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk. Throughout August.
One of the season’s most popular traditional spectacles is the Edinburgh
Military Tattoo, featuring music, marching, and military exercises on the
floodlit esplanade of Edinburgh Castle every evening. Call % 0131-
225-1188, or visit www.edintattoo.co.uk. Throughout August.
Piping Live! brings bagpipe players and ensembles from around the
world to Glasgow. The weeklong festival culminates with the World Pipe
Championships, pitting some 200 pipe bands from around the world

festival.co.uk. Mid-August.
The largest of Scotland’s many Highland games — the Cowal Highland
Gathering — is not actually held in the Highlands but rather in the
Cowal peninsular town of Dunoon, west of Glasgow. The events usually
attract up to 3,000 or more competitors from as far away as British
Columbia and New Zealand. Call % 01369-703-206, or visit www.cowal
gathering.co.uk. End of August.
September
The Braemar Gathering is probably the best known of the annual
Highland Games, regularly attended by members of the Royal family,
whose Balmoral Castle is nearby. Spectators take in piping, dancing, and
strength competitions. Call % 01339-755-377, or visit www.braemar
gathering.org. First weekend in September.
For a couple of weekends every September, Doors Open Days ensures
that important buildings, typically closed to the public, are opened for vis-
itors. It’s a rare opportunity to see the interiors of historic and architec-
turally significant edifices all over Scotland. Visit www.doorsopendays.
org.uk. Throughout September.
The Taste of Mull & Iona Food Festival is a weeklong celebration of
local produce, from wild seafood to farmed oysters to homemade
cheeses. It includes farm tours, wildlife walks, boat trips, and special
feasts. Visit www.mi-food.co.uk. Early to mid-September.

gender culture to Glasgow, with club nights, music, and performance art.
Visit www.glasgay.com. October to early November.
Scotland’s largest celebration of the Gaelic language, Celtic heritage, and
traditional Highlands and Islands music, the Royal National Mod moves
from one place to the next every year. In 2009, for example, it will be in
Oban; in 2010, Caithness. If the Gaels’ culture interests you, check to see
whether the festival fits your itinerary. Call % 01463-709-705, or visit
www.the-mod.co.uk. Mid-October.
November
The capital gets an early start on the holiday season with Edinburgh’s
Christmas, featuring outdoor markets and fairground rides. Visit www.
edinburghschristmas.com. From late November to Christmas Eve.
St. Andrew’s Day celebrates Scotland’s patron saint, and events sur-
rounding November 30 include exhibits, concerts, and fireworks — 
particularly in St. Andrews, where there are weeklong celebrations, as
well as other locations. Some Scots would like to see St. Andrew’s Day 
be as big a celebration as the Irish St. Patrick’s Day. End of November.
December
In Scotland, New Year’s Eve is called Hogmanay, and events take place
across the country. But Edinburgh marks the holiday with a weeklong
extravaganza of events (many free), culminating with a December 31
street party, rock concert, and fireworks display (www.edinburghs
hogmanay.org). Glasgow has celebrations on Hogmanay that include
outdoor concerts (www.winterfestglasgow.com). Last week in
December.
If you’re in the country and looking for something different on New
Year’s Eve, perhaps the Stonehaven Fireball Festival is the ticket for
you. In this northeastern port town, locals parade down the main street
literally swinging huge fireballs to ward off darkness and welcome the
new year. Visit www.stonehavenfireballs.co.uk. December 31.

Chapter 4
Following an Itinerary: 
Five Fine Options
In This Chapter
 Following a one-week tour of Scotland’s principal cities
 Taking your time on a two-week tour of the country
 Finding places that should please the children
 Discovering Scotland’s great outdoors in the Highlands and Western Islands
H
owever willing we are to leave a few things to chance, most of us
want to have a bit of structure when we travel. With that in mind,
this chapter suggests some practical itineraries. The first two are appro-
priate if you have one or two weeks to explore Scotland. Then I suggest a
seven-day route designed particularly for traveling families. Finally, for
those who want to focus on the outdoors, I’ve put together a pair of one-
week itineraries, one that focuses on the wonderful Highlands, the other
on the singular Scottish islands. These are just some suggestions, and
alas they leave out a few areas, such as the Kintyre Peninsula or Outer
Hebrides, which you might decide deserve a visit.
In each itinerary, I direct you to the proper chapters to find in-depth
information on the sights and attractions listed. Alternatively, consult
the Index at the back of the book, which directs you to the appropriate
city and region chapters in Parts III and IV.
You may be planning to rent a car for your stay in Scotland. If you want
to see just Edinburgh and Glasgow, however, you’re probably better off
without one.
Some side trips are more difficult to make without an automobile, but
regions such as Fife and Ayrshire (and cities such as Stirling) can be vis-
ited by train or by bus. Even the shores of Loch Lomond can be reached
by train, so don’t feel obliged to use a smog-spewing gas guzzler unless
you need the utter freedom to explore and take all sorts of back roads.

Seeing Many Highlights in One Week
If you have seven days to explore, you’re not going to see everything
that Scotland has to offer. Worry not: With a bit of enterprise, you can
see quite a lot despite the time restrictions of your vacation.
I strongly suggest that you principally visit Edinburgh and Glasgow,
using them as bases for excursions into the countryside. The one-week
itinerary in this section offers the option of one overnight stay on the
fringes of the Highlands or south of the principal cities. You may prefer
to try and cover more of the country by staying in different places every
night. If that’s the case, then you may want to combine part of this sec-
tion with parts of the next section on a two-week trip to Scotland.
Day 1
Start in the capital, Edinburgh. In your first 24 hours, familiarize your-
self with the city by taking one of the hop-on, hop-off tour buses, which
are open-air. Then stick to the city’s Old Town and stroll the Royal Mile,
taking in the attractions, such as Edinburgh Castle, Gladstone’s Land,
St. Giles Cathedral, and the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Later pop into a
pub for a drink and dine at one of the city’s fine restaurants. You can
find complete information on Old Town and its major attractions, pubs,
and restaurants in Chapter 11.
Day 2
Your priority today is Edinburgh’s museums and galleries. If you’re a his-
tory buff, the Museum of Scotland should top your list. For art, hit as
many national galleries as possible, whether the main collection on the
Mound, more recent works at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern
Art, or luminaries depicted in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.
For details on all these (and more), see Chapter 11.
Day 3
Take your first day trip outside the city today. I offer three choices here,
not because I can’t make up my mind but because I want you to know
your options. Pick between the Kingdom of Fife, which is just across the
Forth River from Edinburgh (see Chapter 16); the ancient city and castle
of Stirling (see Chapter 16); or East Lothian and the Borders (see
Chapters 13 and 14). Each option provides a break from the city and
exposes you to the readily available countryside.
Day 4
It’s a travel day, but you’re only going some 72km (45 miles) west to
Scotland’s biggest city, Glasgow. As in Edinburgh, I advise one of the
hop-on, hop-off tour bus rides that leave frequently from George Square
in the heart of the city. Return to the commercial centre after your tour,
and explore some of the city’s free museums, visit the medieval
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Fine Options 53

Glasgow Cathedral, or follow my walking tour (in Chapter 12) to admire
the famous Victorian architecture or the work of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh. Flip to Chapter 12 for more information on Glasgow, includ-
ing hints on the city’s top pubs and restaurants.
Day 5
Return to explore the leafy environs of Glasgow’s most desirable district,
the West End, which is home to the city’s 500-plus-year-old university
and an excellent municipal art collection in the recently refurbished
Kelvingrove Art Museum and Gallery. Shop, drink, and dine on the
West End’s main street, Byres Road. Another of today’s art-influenced
priorities is the Burrell Collection, which requires a trip to the Pollok
Country Park on the city’s south side. You’ll find more information on all
Glasgow has to offer in Chapter 12, where you can also take note of my
suggested one-, two-, and three-day (or more) itineraries of the city.
Day 6
Time is running short, so why not make another day trip, with the
option of an overnight stay? Go west to Wemyss Bay and take the ferry
to the Isle of Bute to get a taste of island life. Or perhaps head toward
the Highlands, stopping along the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond. You
can make it back to Glasgow, but you may prefer to stay in the country
this evening. See Chapters 15 or 16 for details.
Day 7
Unbelievably, your time is almost up. You may want to go south of
Glasgow to Burns Country in Ayrshire, an excursion that can include
visits to the poet’s birthplace as well as stops at golfing hotspots, such
as Turnberry, and a tour of historic properties such as Culzean Castle,
with its magnificent seaside prospect, gardens, and parkland. (See
Chapter 15 for more information on these and other attractions in the
area.) If you passed on Stirling earlier in your visit, you can get there just
as easily from Glasgow. Chapter 16 has all the details.
Touring the Best of Scotland in Two Weeks
In two weeks, you can see all the major regions of Scotland and a fair
number of the major attractions, too.
Days 1, 2, and 3
Obviously, I don’t want to exclude Edinburgh and Glasgow from this itin-
erary, so you can spend your first two days in Edinburgh, following the
itinerary outlined in the previous section. But give the capital an extra
24 hours so that, on the third day, you can pick up some additional qual-
ity time in this fabulous city, or take an additional day trip as outlined
above. (After a detour south, this itinerary takes you to Glasgow, too, on
Days 6 and 7.)
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
54

Day 4
Now’s your chance to see some of Southern Scotland. Head for Melrose
and its historic abbey and see Abbotsford, the home of Sir Walter Scott.
Then journey west to Dumfries and Galloway. Dumfries is a pleasant
southern town, sometimes referred to as the “Queen of the South,” with
poet Robert Burns’s final home, which is now a museum. If you have the
inclination, head to the lovely harbor town of Portpatrick on the Rhinns
of Galloway, a picturesque coastal settlement boasting a natural harbor
with excellent seaside views. See Chapter 14.
Day 5
Travel north toward Glasgow, stopping to take in Culzean Castle and
Burns Country, which are outlined in Day 7 of “Seeing Many Highlights in
One Week.”
Days 6 and 7
These are your days to spend in Glasgow. Follow my earlier suggestions
for what to see and do in “Seeing Many Highlights in One Week,” outlined
above.
Day 8
Head north of the city toward the Highlands, via Loch Lomond. Depending
on your ambitions, this journey can include a detour to Loch Fyne and
Loch Awe, but it’s probably best to head for Oban (see Chapter 15) and
then on to Mull.
Day 9
Spend today touring the isle of Mull and the ancient Christian settlement
of Iona. To get to these places, catch the ferry from Oban or join a
guided tour. If you want to spend the night, you may wish to consider
the wee, historic Isle of Iona or some place in Tobermory. See Chapter
19 for more information on the islands.
Day 10
From the port of Tobermory you can take a ferry (in season) to the
remote peninsula of Ardnamurchan. Along the way, you can stop to take
in Castle Tioram, Arisaig, Sands of Morar, and Mallaig. From Mallaig,
another ferry departs to the Isle of Skye. The ferry will also take you to
the mainland where you can travel north and link up with the “Road to the
Isles.” See Chapters 18 and 19 for details on these areas and attractions.
Day 11
As you near the end of your tour, visit the Cuillin Hills of Skye and stop
at Portree before heading back to the mainland via the bridge at the
Kyle of Lochalsh. If you’re making good time, stop at Eilean Donan
castle and the picturesque town of Plockton before you start the lovely
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Fine Options 55

drive to Inverness and the northern shores of Loch Ness. For details on
the area, flip to Chapters 18 and 19.
Day 12
Here’s your chance to see Nessie, the Loch Ness Monster. Don’t spend
too much time at Loch Ness, however, because you need to get across
the mountains to Royal Deeside. Here, it’s worth your time to have a
gander at a few castles, such as Braemar or Blair Atholl, and perhaps
make a stop at a whisky distillery. See Chapter 17 for more on the area.
Day 13
As you head back toward the center of Scotland, take in Perth as well as
the golfing mecca and ancient settlement of St. Andrews (see Chapter 16).
Day 14
On the last day of your tour, visit Stirling if you haven’t already done so,
or alternatively, tour Fife on your way back to Edinburgh, where this itin-
erary began a fortnight ago.
Discovering Scotland with Kids
Touring history-heavy castles or art-laden museums with children in tow
doesn’t have to be a big headache or a battle of patience and wills. Plenty
of attractions appeal to all ages. If you’re traveling with little ones, follow-
ing the loose itinerary in this section can be the path of least resistance.
When you’re in Edinburgh and Glasgow, you don’t need a car; public
transportation and an occasional taxi should suffice. However, upon leav-
ing those two cities, a car becomes necessary to complete this tour.
As you follow the cross-references in this section and jump to other
chapters in this book, look for the Kid Friendly icon, which points out
the best attractions, restaurants, and so on to visit with children.
Begin in Edinburgh, and make sure to visit Edinburgh Castle. The self-
guided audio tour may confuse little kids, but the castle is interesting
and fun to explore even without any commentary. Nearby, the Camera
Obscura usually fascinates children. You can make a trip to the
Edinburgh Zoo to see the penguin parade, and while in town, visit the
toy-filled Museum of Childhood. See Chapter 11 for more information on
Edinburgh’s attractions.
Next it’s on to Glasgow, where you can break up your other sightseeing
with kiddie favorites such as the aforementioned Kelvingrove Art
Gallery and Museum or the Museum of Transport; interactive exhibits
at the Science Centre; and the fun, hands-on People’s Palace. For a
breath of fresh air (and to burn off any excess energy), take a romp
around Glasgow Green.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
56

A couple of side trips from Glasgow can take two entire days. You can
head south along the coast, where the kids can comb beaches, see the
cottage where poet Robert Burns was born, and romp about the adven-
ture playground at Culzean Castle. In the other direction is Stirling,
offering a bit of history and education at Bannockburn, good exploring
in Stirling Castle, and some entertainment (and frights) in the tour of
Stirling’s Old Town Jail.
From Glasgow, you may want to head north through spectacular Glen
Coe and perhaps spend a day exploring the area around Fort William,
hiking or mountain biking around Ben Nevis, the highest peak in Great
Britain. Next comes the Loch Ness region, which is generally a load of
fun for children. Check out one of the Loch Ness exhibitions and one of
the sonar-scoping monster-hunting cruises.
On the road back to Edinburgh, you can stop at J.M. Barrie’s Birthplace
in Kirriemuir (Barrie wrote Peter Pan) and visit Deep Sea World, just
north of Edinburgh in North Queensferry.
Touring Scotland’s Great Highlands
Scotland has no shortage of things to see, and most regions have their
own unique attractions. But among the best regions is the wild terrain of
the Highlands. Why not try to get all the way to the top of Scotland (and
the U.K., too, for that matter) and see some of the wide-open spaces? For
this seven-day itinerary (I don’t break it down into exact days, so you
can adjust the plans as you like), you can take the train from Glasgow,
Edinburgh, or even London up to Inverness and rent a car there. For
more details on Highlands attractions, and for lists of accommodations
and restaurants in this area, see Chapter 18.
From Inverness, head north across the Black Isle, through Tain, and
across the Dornoch Firth. Make a brief stop to see the cathedral in
Dornoch, and then head up through Lairg to the northern shore.
At Tongue, you may want to stop to see the Highland cattle that roam
the beaches here, and then go west to Durness, a settlement that John
Lennon visited as a child (which is why a small monument stands in his
memory). One natural curiosity is Smoo Cave, although what’s really
Chapter 4: Following an Itinerary: Five Fine Options 57
Beware of the midge
I love the western extremities of Scotland, but for many, the region is home to the nas-
tiest beast in the nation. The midge (mid-gee) is a tiny flying insect that leaves a terrifi-
cally itchy bite. If you can’t resist the call of the west, arm yourself with some effective
bug spray.

spectacular is the craggy shoreline, which leads to remote Cape Wrath.
For some excellent crafts, visit Balnakeil — an artists’ colony in an
abandoned military base that’s a throwback to the 1960s if there ever
was one.
From Durness, head south along more beautiful, unspoiled shoreline
toward Scourie. But before you get there, you really must detour out to
Blairmore, park the car, and hike into the most unspoiled beach in Great
Britain, at Sandwood Bay. You can also hike to Cape Wrath from
Sandwood, if you’re ambitious.
To appreciate just how wild, beautiful, and unpopulated the Western
Highlands region of Scotland truly is, detour at Kylesku to the peninsula
with the stone monument known as the Old Man of Stoer, or simply
carry on to the active fishing port of Ullapool. It’s hardly a big town, but
it seems like the height of civilization after you’ve spent time farther
north.
Inverewe Garden is the next highlight, although your drive south pro-
vides ample opportunities to stop and sightsee, like at Gruinard Bay,
where you may just spot some sea otters splashing in the surf.
The road south twists and turns past Gairloch, Loch Torridon, and the
road to Applecross (where the inn serves famously delicious meals)
before arriving in Plockton, perhaps the most picturesque village in the
Highlands. Kick back, relax, and toast your Highland excursion on your
final night of this tour.
Finally, drive to Loch Duich and see Eilean Donan Castle, the most 
photographed castle in the Highlands. Then hit the road through
Invermoriston to Loch Ness, where you can take a brief cruise and see if
Nessie raises her knurled head, before you return to Inverness.
Touring the Western Highlands and Islands
If you don’t want to cover the hundreds of miles necessary to get to
places such as Durness, Sandwood Bay, and Inverewe Garden, then the
itinerary in this section is the one for you. It’s less strenuous but still
brings you into the Highlands and includes a taste of the islands, too.
For more details on the places mentioned in this section, see Chapters
16, 18, and 19.
From Glasgow, where you should rent a car for this tour after you’ve
seen the city, head northwest along the bonnie banks of Loch Lomond,
stop for refreshment at the Drovers Inn, carry on to Crianlarich, and
enter the Highlands via the gorgeously desolate Rannoch Moor and ver-
dant Glen Coe.
Part I: Introducing Scotland 
58

The region south of Fort William is a good place to spend the night. You
can choose from inexpensive B&Bs as well as posher lodges, such as
Ballachulish House. In Fort William, satisfy your shopping urges, and
then get on the “Road to the Isles,” which takes you to the Glenfinnan
Monument at the tip of Loch Shiel.
Get off the beaten track and explore a bit of Moidart and Ardnamurchan,
which has the most westerly peninsula in the British mainland. Take time
to see Castle Tioram before backtracking to Lochailort and resuming the
trek north to Arisaig.
From Arisaig, with its pleasant little harbor, you can take a cruise to
Eigg, one of the small islands. The trip often includes some whale sight-
ings. Just past Arisaig, golfers may want to try the tricky (if short)
Traigh course, before everyone enjoys the lovely Sands of Morar.
Next on this tour are Mallaig and the ferry to Armadale on the Isle of
Skye, which is the largest island of the Hebrides. Just north of the ferry
terminal is the Clan Donald visitor center. You have time to visit the
center and drive up to Portree, Skye’s main port, before heading back to
the mainland via the bridge at the Kyle of Lochalsh.
From Skye, head back to the mainland, where area highlights include the
attractions of lovely Plockton on Loch Carron and Eilean Donan Castle.
Take the scenic drive to Invergarry, where you may want to spend the
night at the Glengarry Castle Hotel.
On your final day, head back to Fort William, where you may have time
to explore the Ben Nevis region before retracing your steps through
Glen Coe and Rannoch Moor. But this time around, stop at the touristy
shops in Tyndrum for some souvenirs before hitting the shores of Loch
Lomond and the busy highway back to Glasgow.
Planning Your Trip: Mileage Chart
Use Table 4-1 to help you plan your travel itinerary in Scotland, but
remember: Roads can be narrow and winding, so allot extra time to get
from point A to point B.
It’s important to be realistic about the amount of time you’ll spend in the
car or bus burning up precious daylight hours. If you try to hit Ullapool
and Inverness in one full (and tiring) day, then you spend most of your
day driving the distance between the two cities and see only a few big
sights. Try to get up and out early — that means breakfast at 8:30 a.m.
instead of 11 a.m. And don’t try to cram too much into each day. If
you’re constantly rushing from one place to the next, then you won’t
enjoy anything you see.

Part II
Planning Your Trip 
to Scotland

In this part . . . 
T
he chapters in Part II are designed to get down to the
nitty-gritty of planning your trip: I offer advice and guid-
ance on determining how much your trip to Scotland may
cost and how to make a sensible budget; ﬁnding out which
airlines go where (and ﬁnding the smartest value in airfares);
deciding the best ways to get around Scotland once you’re
there; ﬁguring out how to drive on Scotland’s roads; ﬁnding
the right accommodations for your needs; and managing
passports. And that’s not all.
In this part, you can ﬁnd advice on what to do if you get sick
in Scotland and whether you should invest in travel insur-
ance. If you’re a traveler with special needs and interests,
issues important to you are covered here, as well. In short,
the following pages are ﬁlled with all the info you need to plan
your trip to Scotland.

Chapter 5
Managing Your Money
In This Chapter
 Creating a realistic budget for your trip to Scotland
 Reviewing money-saving tips
 Understanding the local currency and how best to get it
 Carrying money conveniently and safely
A
n important consideration for any vacation is your budget, of
course. How much will the trip cost and where will the money be
best spent? You don’t want to waste good money, but you probably
don’t want to be tied down to a bare-bones budget that restricts you
from seeing the highlights of Scotland.
The smartest way to travel is to plan your spending in advance: In large
part, this means understanding ahead of time what things will cost. But
keep in mind that sometimes you get what you pay for.
This chapter covers what you can expect to pay for transportation,
accommodations, dining, and sightseeing while in Scotland. Plus, I
include some money-saving tips. As a hands-on bonus, the Dummies
budget worksheet (Table 5-2) will help you to plot out your expenses.
Keep in mind that exchange rates are constantly fluctuating. As I write,
the dollar has gained quite a lot of value against the pound, owing to
stresses in the financial markets. Because of the recent oscillation and
uncertainty about the economic situations to come, it is impossible for
me to give you a precise conversion when you read this. If you want to
play it safe and overestimate, essentially double all pound amounts and
that will give you an overly generous dollar equivalent: For example, a
£10 meal is virtually $20. Better yet, visit www.xe.com/ucc to see the
most current pound-to-dollar conversion rate. Throughout the book, I
have calculated £1 equal to $1.85 — or conversely $1 equal to 54p.
Alas, goods in Scotland often carry a similar numerical price in pounds
as they would in dollars back in the U.S. For example, a digital camera
that costs $250 in New York might be priced at, say, £230 in Edinburgh.
But, of course, that means it’s quite a bit more expensive in Scotland.

I suspect that you want to enjoy your stay and don’t want to be con-
stantly converting pounds to dollars before making every purchase. But
if your desire is to keep costs down, be wary and make sure you’re get-
ting a bargain or at least spending your money wisely.
By the way, all dollar references in this chapter are to the U.S. currency.
Planning Your Budget
As you have probably already guessed, Scotland is not the cheapest
European destination. But it’s not the most expensive place to visit,
either. Can you do Scotland on $10 a day? No, quite honestly — unless
you sleep at the roadside and mainly eat cans of baked beans. On $25 a
day? Possibly, if you don’t mind camping or bunking in a youth hostel
and eating very basic meals. Being realistic, however, you can bet on a
figure more like $125 to $200 per person per day — more if you factor in
full-time car rental and gasoline (petrol) costs. And that figure doesn’t
include the cost of actually getting to Scotland.
But sometimes you do get what you pay for. In this case, Scotland usu-
ally compensates for the proverbial price of admission.
Transportation
Car rental (or car hire as the locals say) isn’t especially exorbitant, but
visitors will likely find the cost of gasoline to be staggeringly high.
Remember, here it’s called petrol and is priced in liters, not gallons. It
costs about 3.5 times more than the average in the United States. On the
plus side, however, your rental car will probably get exceptional miles
per liter (which is how it’s measured here), and the driving distances
across Scotland are miniscule compared to cross-country travel in the
United States, Canada, or Australia. Usually the car rental rates include
unlimited mileage. Check with your auto insurance company to see if
you need to buy extra coverage for when you’re in Scotland. (I discuss
insurance coverage for travelers in Chapter 10.)
Although it may limit your mobility, using public transportation can help
cut your costs, particularly if you buy tickets in advance. If you’re only
planning to visit Edinburgh, Glasgow, and some side-trip destinations,
you don’t really need to rent a car.
Lodging
Hotel rooms in Scotland aren’t cheap. If, however, you do your home-
work and scour accommodations Web sites, you will find rates consider-
ably lower than the standard “tariff” that’s quoted by each hotel. If you
want luxury or a spectacular view, you will have to pay a premium. If you
just need a leak-proof roof over your head, a place to wash, and a clean
bed, then you can easily save money on your lodging.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
64

Generally speaking, a double room at a hotel runs about $150 to $250 per
night; double rooms at smaller, more modest guesthouses or B&Bs are
around $90 to $150. At the high end of the scale you can spend $300 or
quite a bit more. Self-catering cottages rented by the week ($450–$1,200
per week) and country B&Bs are almost always less expensive (a bit
under or around $50 per person). Rooms with their own bathrooms (en
suite) cost more than those without. Places that remain open year-round
often charge less during the low season, October through March.
Dining
American visitors with their calculators at the ready will find out that
most food is typically more expensive in Scotland than in most of the
U.S. But you can cut your dining expenses by not choosing the ritziest
restaurant in town every night. Keep an eye out for lunch specials and
early-bird or pre-theater menus — they offer considerable savings. On
the Web, investigate www.5pm.co.uk, which offers reductions on early-
evening dining options, particularly in Edinburgh and Glasgow. If you
stay in self-catering accommodations, you’ll spend less on food by cook-
ing at your rental cottage or apartment. Some groceries, particularly pre-
mium items, such as organic chicken, cost about the same as in the U.S.
metropolitan market.
A good per-person allowance for lunch is $18 to $20, and for dinner
between $28 and $60. Many hotels and lodges include a big cooked
breakfast in the room rate, so at least you often don’t have to figure that
meal into your daily food budget.
Sightseeing
The price of admission to many tourist attractions in Scotland is slightly
more modest than what you may expect to find in other Western
European countries. In Edinburgh, the permanent exhibitions of the
Scottish national galleries are priced just right: absolutely free. And simi-
larly, in Glasgow, the city-run museums don’t charge admission. All the
natural beauty of the countryside, from the Ayrshire coastline to the
Highlands, doesn’t cost you a thing and is indeed priceless. Historic
sites run by Historic Scotland and the National Trust for Scotland are a
bit pricey, but if you plan to see several, consider a membership or joint
entrance tickets.
Even if you see two or three attractions each day, a fair amount to
budget for sights is $20 per person per day.
Shopping
Jump back up to the introduction to this chapter and recall what I have
already said about consumer retail goods and their U.K. prices. A pair of
Calvin Kleins may have about the same sticker price as its counterpart
in the U.S., but they will actually cost a lot more, given the exchange
rate. Still, you can find “home-grown” commodities in Scotland that are
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 65

less expensive when purchased here: woolen goods or cashmere, local
crafts and arts, and more. Be selective in your purchases, and your bank
balance will be better off.
Nightlife
As with sightseeing, you may find that things are cheaper than you antic-
ipated, particularly the theater, dance, and even opera. In pubs and bars,
prices of alcohol are at the higher end but not ridiculously so. In general,
expect the equivalent of big city (Toronto, San Francisco, or Melbourne)
prices for nightlife in Scotland. A pint of lager or ale will cost between $4
and $6. A dram of whisky is sometimes as little as $3, but cocktails are at
least $6 and typically more.
In Table 5-1, I take the daily estimates laid out in this section and add
them up for a projection of how much it typically costs to accommodate
and entertain one person for one week in Scotland.

Better too much than not enough
Make sure you have access to emergency money in case you need it. If you golf, add
up greens fees and the price of renting clubs (assuming you’re not lugging your own
around the country). Do you plan to buy clothes, jewelry, crystal, and antiques, or just
pick up a few postcards, a snow globe, and a couple of cheap souvenirs? A modest
piece of crystal can set you back $80; a nice Edinburgh sweatshirt, about $50. So gauge
your impulse-buying tendencies and factor that into your budget as well.

Cutting Costs without Cutting the Fun
If worries about travel costs mean you’re hesitant to go to Scotland, you
have two options: Simply stay home and miss out — or get over it. Sure,
Scotland isn’t the cheapest European country to visit, but it can be made
more affordable. Make sensible decisions, look for those bargains that
don’t cheapen the experience, and you should be fine.
Some tourists demand to be pampered in five-star hotels, but those places
are exceptionally expensive in Scotland. If you’re flexible when it comes to
the pampering, you should seek out the smaller lodges and guesthouses
that are priced to fit tighter travel budgets. A nice perk of most Scottish
accommodations is that breakfast is included in the price of the room.
Sometimes it’s even hearty enough to keep you full until dinner.
Also, some visitor attractions are free. Even if you stick to seeing things
that cost nothing (although you shouldn’t skip the other sights just
because of the cost), you’ll still experience a vast amount of the country.
You can find plenty of ways, some little and some big, to cut down on
costs. Here are some smart ways to save on your trip to Scotland.
 Go midseason or in the off season. Traveling between mid-
September and mid-April should save you money on your airfare
and accommodations. The days leading up to and just after
Christmas, New Year’s Eve, and Easter are the exceptions, and
prices jump up during those periods. (See Chapter 3 for more info
on Scotland’s seasons.)
 Travel midweek. Most everybody wants to travel on the weekends,
but those willing to travel on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday can
usually find cheaper flights. When inquiring about airfares, ask if you
get a cheaper rate if you fly on a different day. Also remember that
staying over a Saturday night can occasionally cut airfares by half.
 Remember that group rates can save money. And you don’t neces-
sarily have to be one of a busload to get them. Sometimes a party
as small as three people qualifies for group rates.
 Get the Explorer Pass. Historic Scotland, which operates some 
75 historic attractions across Scotland, offers an Explorer Pass that
allows multiple entries to all of their sites, from Iona Abbey to St.
Andrews Cathedral to Edinburgh Castle. The pass is sold at most 
of the sites run by the organization. For more information, call 
% 0131-668-8831, or visit www.historic-scotland.gov.uk.
 Try a package deal. Many people believe that planning a trip
entirely on their own is less expensive, but they’re not necessarily
correct. Travel packages can save not only money but also time. 
A single phone call to a travel agent or package tour operator can
take care of your flight, accommodations, transportation within the
country, and sightseeing arrangements. Even if you’re not up for a
complete package — if you’d prefer to pay for your plane tickets with
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 67

frequent-flier miles, say, or if you don’t like some of the things the
package tour operators offer — you can book room-car deals (which
include a free rental car) or other combo packages directly through
many hotels. Chapter 6 contains more details on package deals.
 Always ask about discounts. Membership in AAA, frequent-flier
plans, trade unions, AARP, university alumni associations, or other
groups often qualifies you for discounted rates on plane tickets,
hotel rooms, and (mainly with U.S.-based companies) car rentals.
Some car-rental companies give discounts to employees of compa-
nies that have corporate accounts. With valid identification, stu-
dents, teachers, youths, and seniors may be entitled to discounts.
Many attractions have discounted family prices. Ask about every-
thing — you may be pleasantly surprised.
 Book your rental car at weekly rates, when possible. Weekly
rentals are most often offered at a discounted rate.
 Know where to buy petrol. The United Kingdom has some of the
highest gasoline prices in Europe, and parts of rural Scotland have
the highest prices in the U.K. One way to ease the burden of these
exorbitant rates is to fill your tank in cities and larger towns. For
the most part, the smaller the town, the higher the price of gas.
Also, you may find lower gas prices at petrol stations at large
supermarkets, such as Tesco or Asda.
 Don’t rent a gas guzzler. Renting a smaller car is cheaper, and you
save money on gas to boot. Unless you’re traveling with kids and
need lots of space, don’t go beyond the economy size. For more on
car rentals, see Chapter 7.
 Walk. All cities in the country are easy to explore on foot, even
Glasgow and Edinburgh. Hoofing it can save you a few extra pounds
(and even burn off a few from your waistline). As a bonus, you’ll get
to know your destination more intimately as you explore at a
slower pace.
 Skimp on souvenirs. As a general rule, souvenirs specially created
for the tourist market are poorly made and over-priced. If you’re
concerned about money, you can definitely do without the T-shirts,
key chains, and other trinkets.
 Use ATMs to get money. The exchange rate of most banks’ ATM
machines — or cash points — is surprisingly competitive. Yes, your
bank back home may charge a small fee, but it won’t charge a per-
centage commission on the money you withdraw. And yes, it comes
out in the local currency, not dollars.
 Use libraries for Internet access. Because of Western tourists’
growing use of the Internet, online access is popping up all over
Scotland. Most town libraries have access, and they usually don’t
charge or require you to be a member. This policy may change in
the coming years, but for now, libraries are a good, cheap option
for surfing the Web.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
68

 Pick up free, coupon-packed visitor pamphlets and magazines.
Detailed maps, feature articles, dining and shopping directories,
and discount and freebie coupons make these pocket-size give-
aways a smart pickup. You’ll find these types of materials in tourist
board offices and, perhaps, in the lobby of your hotel.
 Skip the fantabulous hotel-room views. Rooms with great views
are the most expensive in any hotel. Unless you’re planning to hang
out in your room all day, why hand over the extra dough?
 Get out of town. In many places, hotels located just outside popular
tourist areas may be a great bargain and require only a little more
driving — and they may even offer free parking. Sure, you may not
get all the fancy amenities, and you’ll probably have to carry your
own bags, but the rooms may be just as comfortable and a whole 
lot cheaper.
 Ask whether your children can stay in your room for free.
Although many accommodations in Scotland charge by the head,
some may allow your little ones to stay for free. Even if you have to
pay $10 or $15 for a rollaway bed, you’ll save hundreds by not
having to pay for two rooms.
 Avoid making phone calls from a hotel room. The inflated fees
that hotels charge for phone calls are scandalous. Walk to the near-
est coin- or card-operated phone to make calls within and out of
the country.
 Consider rooms that aren’t en suite. Rooms without a bathroom
are cheaper, although they’re increasingly hard to find. Sharing a
bathroom may be a small sacrifice when it comes to saving money,
and it doesn’t really detract from your trip. Group hostel rooms are
even cheaper if you’re willing to rough it a bit more.
 Check out accommodations with kitchens. By renting self-catering
apartments or cottages for a week or more, you can save money
overall on accommodations (especially if you’re traveling with a
group), and on food, because you can prepare your own meals in
the kitchen. By avoiding big-ticket restaurant meals, you’ll save a
heck of a lot of money.
 Have the same meal for less money. If you enjoy a late lunch (or
an early-evening meal) at a nice restaurant and settle for a snack
later, your wallet will thank you. Lunch and pre-theater menus often
offer the same food as dinner menus, but the prices are much less
expensive.
 Before you leave home, check prices on items you think you may
want to buy. This way, you’ll know whether you’re really getting a
bargain by buying items abroad. Spending a little time surfing the
Web is an easy way to find the information you need.
 Look before you tip. Some restaurants include a service fee or gra-
tuity on the bill, especially if you’re with a group. Study your bill:
You could be paying a double tip by mistake. And don’t tip bar-
tenders for drinks — they don’t expect it.

Handling Money
After you settle on a budget for your trip, you can start figuring out the
nuts and bolts of carrying money abroad. How much money do you want
to bring along? Do you want to carry cold, hard cash, credit cards, trav-
eler’s checks, or all three? How can you get more money after you’re in
Scotland? What’s the best way to exchange dollars for pounds? And how
can you ensure that your money will be safe and secure while you’re
vacationing?
You’re the best judge of how much cash you feel comfortable carrying or
what currency alternative is your favorite. That’s not going to change
much just because you’re on vacation. True, you’ll probably be moving
around more and incurring more expenses than you generally do (unless
you happen to eat out every meal when you’re at home), and you may
let your mind slip into vacation mode and not be as vigilant about your
safety as when you’re in work mode, but, those factors aside, the only
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland

type of payment that won’t be available to you away from home is your
personal checkbook (or, as it’s spelled in Scotland, chequebook). This
section offers nearly everything you need to know about money matters
in Scotland.

The currency in Scotland, British pence and pounds sterling, is quite simi-
lar to American cents and dollars. The denominations of your loose
change (though not the sizes) are almost the same: The few anomalies
include 2-pence coins, the 20-pence coin (there’s no equivalent to the
U.S. quarter), and the 1- and 2-pound coins. Pence are often just referred
to as “p,” such as in “Do you have 30p for the pay phone?” A pound is
also known colloquially as a quid. Some people may refer to a “bob” —
this is equivalent to 5p, which used to be known as a “shilling” before
the decimal system was imposed in 1971.
Although the U.K.’s official central bank, called the Bank of England, con-
trols monetary matters across Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a
couple of banks in Scotland, such as the Clydesdale Bank, have permis-
sion to print Scottish bills in 5-, 10-, and 20-pound denominations. They
feature Scottish historical figures such as Sir Walter Scott or William
Wallace (rather than the queen). There’s no value difference between
these pound notes and those printed in England, and both are accepted
throughout Scotland.
Be careful if you travel to England with Scottish bank notes: They’re
often not accepted by shops and restaurants, where employees are
unaccustomed to seeing Scottish bank names on the folding money. Err
on the side of caution and go to a bank and exchange any Scottish bills
for Bank of England notes before heading south of the border.
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 71
What’s up with the euro?
Europe’s common currency, the euro, isn’t used in Scotland. Why not? Well, a huge
debate once raged among U.K. politicians and people over giving up the pound for the
euro. After the Labour Party government was elected in 1997, it waffled politically and
only confused the issue by introducing some spurious economic hurdles. The
Conservatives, Labour’s main opposition, have opposed the euro for over 25 years.
Increasingly many people doubt that the euro will ever be used here officially. An inde-
pendent Scotland would probably accept the euro more quickly than the U.K. as a whole,
but nobody anticipates full Scottish autonomy anytime soon.
You may see euro equivalents calculated on some money transactions, but that’s only
designed to get consumers familiar with the new money. One pound is equal to about
1.26. A few euro-friendly businesses in Scotland do accept the euro — otherwise it’s
about as useful as a dollar.

As I’ve said throughout this chapter, goods and services are often more
expensive in Scotland than they would be in the U.S. or in other English-
speaking countries. Many items sold in Scotland are priced with the
same numerical amount as they would be in the U.S. — for instance, if a
soda costs a dollar in the U.S., it’s often priced at a pound (about $1.85)
in Scotland. This increase isn’t true of all items, but it gives you a gen-
eral idea of how far your new cash and weighty coins will go.
Remember, the exchange rate fluctuates minute by minute. The best
source for up-to-date currency exchange information is online at
www.xe.com/ucc. The average rates are shown in Table 5-3.

You can exchange money anywhere you see the Bureau de Change sign.
You will often see it at travel agencies, banks, post offices, and tourist
information offices. Generally, you’ll get the best rates at banks; the local
tourist office can tell you the location of the bank branch nearest you.
Using ATMs and carrying cash
The easiest and best way to get cash away from home is from an ATM
(automated teller machine), sometimes referred to as a “cash machine,”
or “cash point.” The Cirrus (% 800-424-7787; www.mastercard.com)
and PLUS (% 800-843-7587; www.visa.com) networks span the globe;
look at the back of your bank card to see which network you’re on, then
call or check online for ATM locations at your destination. For example,
the PLUS ATM locator (visa.via.infonow.net/locator/global/)
indicates that there are 100 machines in and around Edinburgh. Even up
north in Inverness, it lists 84.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
72

Be sure you know your personal identification number (PIN) before you
leave home. Also keep in mind that many banks impose a fee every time
your card is used at a different bank’s ATM, and that fee can be higher
for international transactions (up to $5 or more) than for domestic ones
(where they’re rarely more than $1.50). On top of this, the bank from
which you withdraw cash may charge its own fee. To compare banks’
ATM fees within the U.S., use www.bankrate.com. For international with-
drawal fees, ask your bank.
In many international destinations, ATMs offer the best exchange rates,
even taking into account the extra withdrawal fees you may be charged.
Avoid exchanging money at commercial exchange bureaus and hotels,
which often have the highest transaction fees.
Not all ATMs in Scotland are connected to the global banking networks.
This is especially true in rural areas and in small banks. It’s best to not
depend solely on ATMs for cash when you’re traveling. Also, the security
risks are the same here as at home. If someone steals your card and
knows your personal identification number (PIN), the crook will try to
drain your bank account. Recently, machines have been rigged to “swal-
low” cards, which are later extracted and used illegally. All this is rare in
Scotland, but, nevertheless, you should exercise caution and avoid using
ATMs late at night or in poorly lit urban areas.
Be sure to check your daily withdrawal limit with your bank before you
set off on your trip. Remember, if your limit is $250, you’ll be able to
withdraw only about £135.
If you lose your ATM card, contact your bank at home and report the
loss immediately. You don’t want your bank account depleted in the
event that the card (and, in a worst-case scenario, personal identifica-
tion number) falls into the wrong hands.
Charging ahead with credit cards
Credit cards are a safe way to carry money: They also provide a conven-
ient record of all your expenses, and they generally offer relatively good
exchange rates. You can also withdraw cash advances from your credit
cards at banks or ATMs, provided you know your PIN. If you’ve forgotten
yours, or didn’t even know you had one, call the number on the back of
your credit card and ask the bank to send it to you. It usually takes five
to seven business days, though some banks will provide the number
over the phone if you tell them your mother’s maiden name or some
other personal information.
Keep in mind that when you use your credit card abroad, many banks
now assess a 1 percent to 3 percent “transaction fee” on all charges you
incur abroad (whether you’re using the local currency or your native
currency). But credit cards still may be the smart way to go when you
factor in such things as exorbitant ATM fees and higher traveler’s check
exchange rates (and service fees).
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 73

Some credit card companies recommend that you notify them of any
upcoming trip abroad; that way they won’t become suspicious when the
card is used in a foreign destination (and they won’t block your
charges). Even if you don’t call your credit card company in advance,
you can always call the card’s toll-free emergency number if a charge is
refused — a good reason to carry the phone number with you. But per-
haps the most important lesson here is to carry more than one card with
you on your trip; a card might not work for any number of reasons, so
having a backup is the smart way to go.
Visa and MasterCard are both widely used in Scotland. American
Express is accepted by most major businesses, but Diners Club is less
frequently accepted.
All credit cards issued in Scotland have a computer chip in them and
users must know their PIN numbers in order to make purchases. No sig-
natures are required. Cards without chips can still be used, however.
Toting traveler’s checks
You can buy traveler’s checks at most banks. They are offered in denom-
inations of $20, $50, $100, $500, and sometimes $1,000. Generally, you’ll
pay a service charge ranging from 1 percent to 4 percent. The most 
popular traveler’s checks are offered by American Express (% 800-
807-6233, or % 800-221-7282 for cardholders — the latter number
accepts collect calls, offers service in several foreign languages, and
exempts Amex gold and platinum cardholders from the 1 percent fee.);
Visa (% 800-732-1322); and MasterCard (% 800-223-9920).
If you choose to carry traveler’s checks, be sure to keep a record of their
serial numbers separate from your checks, in the event that they are
stolen or lost. You’ll get a refund faster if you know the numbers.
American Express, Thomas Cook, Visa, and MasterCard offer foreign cur-
rency traveler’s checks, useful if you’re traveling to one country or to the
euro zone; they’re accepted at locations where dollar checks may not be.
Taking Taxes into Account
All goods and services in Scotland have a tax or tariff roughly similar to
the local sales taxes in the U.S., although it is always included in the
sticker price rather than later at the cash register. It’s called a value-
added tax (VAT) and is a rather whopping 17.5 percent. The good news
is that any tourists who live outside the European Union are entitled to
get a refund on any VAT paid for goods that they take out of the E.U. —
as long as they make those purchases at shops that are part of the Retail
Export Scheme (look for signs saying “Tax Free Shopping”). The tax-back
scheme is great for tourists who spend large sums of money on books,
jewelry, gifts, clothes — you name it (except, alas, for services such as
hotels, restaurants, or car rental).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
74

But many tourists come to Scotland, spend lots of money, and never find
out how to get their VAT back or don’t bother because they don’t fully
understand how it works. To ensure that you don’t make the same mis-
take, here’s your quick guide to the VAT.
When you make your purchase, show your passport and ask for a tax
refund form. Fill out the form and keep any receipts. When you leave the
U.K., submit the form to Customs for approval. Once Customs has
stamped it, there are a variety of ways to recover the tax. You can mail
the form back to the shop and arrange repayment by post. Some shops
are part of networks run by commercial refund companies, which you
later contact for a refund, although an administration fee may be
charged. Some London airport terminals may have refund booths where
immediate repayments can be received.
If you are traveling on to another E.U. country, you won’t be able to get
your VAT refund. Also, U.K. Customs advises that you should arrange the
method of tax reimbursement with the retailer when you purchase the
product. For more information, log on to www.visitbritain.com and
do a site search for “VAT refunds.” For more information on a commer-
cial refund company, try logging on to www.globalrefund.com or
www.premiertaxfree.com.
Remember not all VATs are refundable. Those added to services aren’t
refundable. Hotels, restaurants, and car rentals, for example, charge VAT
that you can’t get back.
Protecting Yourself and Your Money
Rest easy: You’re going to a safe country. The occurrence of violent
crime is reasonably low in Scotland, although it’s higher in some city dis-
tricts, of course. Handguns are banned across the entire U.K., and
Scotland has so few pistols on the streets that police, as a rule, don’t
even carry them. In 2006, a report found that cops in the entire country
had only shot firearms 34 times in seven years.
Theft is not a major problem — especially if you use common sense and
guard yourself against it. Pickpockets look for people who seem to have
the most money on them and know the least about where they are. Getting
money from an ATM late at night on a deserted street in Glasgow or
Edinburgh is not particularly wise. Also, don’t leave large sums of money
lying around your hotel in the city, unless it is one with good security.
Crime is a fact of modern city life. In many rural areas of Scotland, how-
ever, people don’t even bother locking their house doors at night.
Dealing with a lost or stolen wallet
If your wallet is lost or stolen, don’t panic. Be sure to tell all of your
credit card companies the minute you discover your wallet is missing,
Chapter 5: Managing Your Money 75

and file a report at the nearest police precinct. Contact the police by
going to a station, stopping a passing cop, or dialing % 999 on any tele-
phone. Your credit card company or insurer may require a police report
number or record of the loss. Most credit card companies have an emer-
gency toll-free number to call if your card is lost or stolen; they may be
able to wire you a cash advance immediately or deliver an emergency
credit card in a day or two. Visa’s U.S. emergency number is % 800-
847-2911 or 410-581-9994. American Express cardholders and traveler’s
check holders should call % 800-221-7282. MasterCard holders should
call % 800-307-7309 or 636-722-7111. For other credit cards, call the toll-
free-number directory at % 800-555-1212.
The phone numbers to report lost or stolen credit cards while you’re in
Scotland are:
 American Express (% 01273-696-933)
 Diners Club (% 0870-190-0011)
 MasterCard (% 0800-964-767)
 Visa (% 0800-891-725)
If you need emergency cash over the weekend, when all banks and
American Express offices are closed, you can have money wired to you
via Western Union (% 800-325-6000; www.westernunion.com).
Identity theft and fraud are potential complications of losing your wallet,
especially if you’ve lost your driver’s license along with your cash and
credit cards. Notify the major credit-reporting bureaus immediately;
placing a fraud alert on your records may protect you against liability
for criminal activity. The three major U.S. credit-reporting agencies are
Equifax (% 800-766-0008; www.equifax.com), Experian (% 888-
397-3742; www.experian.com), and TransUnion (% 800-680-7289;
www.transunion.com).
If you lose your passport, contact the U.S. consulate in Edinburgh by
calling % 0131-556-8315; you will need to travel to London and appear
in person at the U.S. Embassy to get a new passport. Finally, if you’ve
lost all forms of photo ID, call your airline and explain the situation; they
might allow you to board the plane if you have a copy of your passport
or birth certificate and a copy of the police report you’ve filed.

Getting to Scotland
In This Chapter
 Flying directly to Scotland with the best airfares
 Taking the train from England to Scotland
 Weighing the pros and cons of escorted or package tours
V
isiting castles, relaxing in local pubs, and exploring the Highlands
are the easy parts of traveling to Scotland. The more difficult issue
is making plans to get yourself there. Several resources, however, make
planning your travel to Scotland virtually painless. This chapter dis-
cusses how to find those resources in addition to helpful hints on things
from bargain airfares to the lowdown on love-’em-or-hate-’em package
tours.
Flying to Scotland
Unless you fancy a long boat ride, you’re most likely to fly into the
United Kingdom, arriving in Scotland directly or via England or some
other European hub, such as Dublin, Reykjavik, or Amsterdam.
Identifying your airline options
A few carriers fly to Scotland directly from the U.S. (namely from Atlanta,
greater New York, Orlando, and Philadelphia). But often the service is
seasonal (May–Sept), and it seems to change every year. For example, in
2006, American Airlines announced it was terminating its Chicago-to-
Glasgow service.
On the other hand, almost every airline in the world seems to fly into
one of London’s airports, so getting north from there to Scotland will
entail only a short flight (about one hour, unless you’re headed to the
Highlands) or a four- to five-hour train ride to get north across the
border.
If you’re traveling from down under, no airlines currently fly directly
from Australia or New Zealand to Scotland. All flights on international
airlines from these two countries go through London.

The major airlines listed below offer U.K. flights, including a few direct to
Scotland. Be sure to call more than one airline to compare prices.
 Air Canada (% 888-247-2262; www.aircanada.ca)
 American Airlines (% 800-433-7300; www.aa.com)
 British Airways (% 800-247-9297; www.britishairways.com)
 Continental Airlines (% 800-231-0856; www.continental.com)
 Delta Airlines (% 800-241-4141; www.delta.com)
 Northwest Airlines (% 800-447-4747; www.nwa.com)
 United Airlines (% 800-538-2929; www.united.com)
 US Airways (% 800-428-4322; www.usairways.com)
 Virgin Atlantic (% 800-862-8621; www.virgin-atlantic.com)
If you travel via London, you can opt for a short flight to Scotland.
British Airways (% 0844-493-0787; www.britishairways.com) has sev-
eral per day. Flybe (% 0871-700-2000, or 44-1392-268-500 from outside
the U.K.; www.flybe.com) is a discount airline that crisscrosses the
U.K., and recently took over routes to the Western Isles.
Regardless of whether you’re coming to Scotland directly or from a
transfer point, you most likely fly into Glasgow or Edinburgh. Both air-
ports are easy to get in and out of and offer easy transportation into the
cities. Because of the frequency of flights into these airports, you’re
more likely to find a cheap fare to them than to smaller Scottish cities,
such as Inverness, Aberdeen, or Dundee. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow
offer perfectly fine airports, and neither option outweighs the other in
terms of proximity to a city.
Glasgow International Airport (% 0870-040-0008; www.glasgow
airport.com) is at Abbotsinch, near Paisley, only about 16km (10 miles)
west of the city via M8. Edinburgh International Airport (% 0870-
040-0007; www.edinburghairport.com) is about 10km (6 miles) west of
the city center and has become a growing hub for flights both within the
British Isles and to and from Continental Europe. South of Glasgow is
Prestwick International Airport (% 0871-223-0700; www.gpia.co.uk),
which is favored by some of the low-budget airlines such as RyanAir
(% 0871-246-0000; www.ryanair.com). Prestwick is on the railway line
to Ayr, about a 45-minute ride from Glasgow’s Central Station. (For point-
ers on planning your itinerary, and help on deciding your arrival and
departure points, see Chapter 4; for details on getting to Edinburgh or
Glasgow, see Chapters 11 and 12.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
78

Getting the best deal on your airfare
Competition among the major U.S. airlines is unlike that of any other indus-
try. Every airline offers virtually the same product (basically, a coach seat
is a coach seat is a . . .), yet prices can vary by hundreds of dollars.
Business travelers who need the flexibility to buy their tickets at the last
minute and to change their itineraries at a moment’s notice — and who
want to get home before the weekend — pay (or at least their companies
pay) the premium rate, known as the full fare. But if you can book your
ticket far in advance, stay over Saturday night, and are willing to travel
midweek (Tues, Wed, or Thurs), you can qualify for the least-expensive
price — usually a fraction of the full fare. Obviously, planning ahead pays.
Search the Internet for cheap fares. The most popular online travel
agencies are Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), Expedia (www.
expedia.com), and Orbitz (www.orbitz.com). In the U.K., go to
Travelsupermarket (% 0845-345-5708; www.travelsupermarket.com),
a flight search engine that offers comparisons for the budget airlines
whose seats often end up in bucket-shop sales. Other Web sites for
booking airline tickets online include www.cheapflights.com,
www.smartertravel.com, www.priceline.com, and www.opodo.com.
Meta search sites (which find and then direct you to airline and hotel
Web sites for booking) include SideStep (www.sidestep.com) and
Kayak.com (www.kayak.com), the latter of which includes fares for
budget carriers as well as the major airlines. In addition, most airlines
offer online-only fares that even their phone agents know nothing about.
Watch local newspapers for promotional specials or fare wars, when
airlines lower prices on their most popular routes. Also keep an eye on
price fluctuations and deals at Web sites such as Airfarewatchdog
(www.airfarewatchdog.com) and Farecast (www.farecast.com).
Frequent-flier membership doesn’t cost a cent, but membership may
entitle you to better seats, faster response to phone inquiries, and
prompter service if your luggage is stolen or your flight is canceled or
delayed, or if you want to change your seat (especially once you’ve
racked up some miles). And you don’t have to fly to earn points; 
frequent-flier credit cards can earn you thousands of miles for doing
your everyday shopping. With more than 70 mileage awards programs
on the market, consumers have never had more options. Investigate 
the program details of your favorite airlines before you sink points into
any one. Consider which airlines have hubs in the airport nearest you,
and, of those carriers, which have the most advantageous alliances,
given your most common routes. To play the frequent-flier game to your
best advantage, consult the community bulletin boards on FlyerTalk
(www.flyertalk.com), or go to Randy Petersen’s Inside Flyer (www.
insideflyer.com). Petersen and friends review all the programs in
detail and post regular updates on changes in policies and trends.
Chapter 6: Getting to Scotland 79

Taking the Train
Well, not from the Americas (or Australia), obviously, but you can take a
train to Scotland from London or from other cities with airports in the
U.K., such as Manchester. It isn’t as fast as flying, but you get to admire
the countryside, arrive at your destination right in the heart of town,
and lessen the toll of your trip on the environment. The four-and-a-half
to five-and-a-half hours on the train to Edinburgh or Glasgow from
London take up precious time (when you could be sightseeing), so you
may want to inquire about red-eye trips that let you sleep on the train
(because you’re traveling during the night).
The trains that link London to Edinburgh (via Newcastle) on the East
Coast Main Line are reasonably fast, efficient, and generally relaxing,
with restaurant and bar service as well as air-conditioning. Trains depart
throughout the day from London’s King’s Cross Station (call National
Railway Enquiries at % 08457-48-49-50 for rail info; from outside the
U.K., call % 44-207-278-5240) and arrive in Edinburgh at Waverley
Station in the heart of the city. The trip generally takes four and a half
hours. Off-peak fares bought in advance can range widely, from around
£25 to £100 ($46–$185), and the government is examining whether they
should be less variable. Off-peak first-class tickets purchased in advance
also vary widely from about £30 to £100 ($56–$185), although the cheap-
est fares seem to be rarely available. A fully flexible “buy anytime, travel
anytime” standard, open single fare is upwards of £120 ($222). The
Caledonian Sleeper service for overnight travel can cost about £100
($185), but online bargains booked well in advance can mean the trip
may cost as little at £20 ($37). You can easily make taxi and bus connec-
tions at Waverley Station, which also serves Glasgow with a First
ScotRail (www.firstgroup.com/scotrail) shuttle service every 15
minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evenings until about
11:30 p.m.
Trains from London arrive in Glasgow at Central Station in the heart of
the city (call National Railway Enquiries at % 08457-48-49-50 for rail info;
from outside the U.K. call % 44-207-278-5240). The trains that directly
link London and Glasgow (via Preston and Carlisle from London’s Euston
Station) on the West Coast Main Line don’t have the reputation for effi-
ciency that those going to Edinburgh do. And they are generally little
quicker than taking the train to Glasgow via Edinburgh. The trains 
(operated by Virgin; % 08457-222-333; www.virgin.com/trains) on
the West Coast Main Line depart from London’s Euston Station every
hour or so, and the trip to Glasgow generally takes five and a half hours.
If you plan a trip on the West Coast Main Line, call and find out if any
major “track works” are scheduled during your journey. If so, you can
expect delays and the possibility of riding a bus for a portion of the trip.
Virgin prices, similar to all the United Kingdom’s train-operating compa-
nies, are diverse and complicated. In general, you might get a one-way
ticket for as little as £35 ($65), although the standard advance-purchase
ticket is more likely to be between £90 and £100 ($167–$185).
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
80

You may prefer to take a train from London’s Kings Cross up the East
Coast Main Line via Newcastle, Edinburgh, and across (via Motherwell)
to Glasgow. The time it takes is about the same as the West Coast Line.
Glasgow’s Central Station is also the terminus for trains arriving from
the southwest of Scotland, and a hub for numerous trains to city sub-
urbs in most directions. A ten-minute walk away (or via shuttle bus 398)
is Queen Street Station. From here, First ScotRail shuttle service (see
above) is available to and from Edinburgh.
Trains to and from points north of Edinburgh and Glasgow depart from
both cities about three to five times daily, although frequency is reduced
during the low season (from the end of Sept to about Easter).
Joining an Escorted Tour
You may be one of the many people who love escorted tours. The tour
company takes care of all the details and tells you what to expect on
each leg of your journey. You know your costs up front and, in the case
of the tame tours, you don’t get many surprises. A great thing about
escorted tours is that they can take you to the maximum number of
sights in the minimum amount of time with the least amount of hassle.
If you decide to go with an escorted tour, purchasing travel insurance is
strongly recommended, especially if the tour operator asks to you pay
your trip costs up front. But don’t buy insurance from the tour operator!
If the tour operator doesn’t fulfill its obligation to provide you with the
vacation you paid for, there’s no reason to think that it will fulfill its
insurance obligations, either. Get travel insurance through an independ-
ent agency. (You can find out more about the ins and outs of travel insur-
ance in Chapter 10.)
When choosing an escorted tour, along with finding out whether you
have to put down a deposit and when final payment is due, ask a few
simple questions before you buy:
 What is the cancellation policy? Can the operator cancel the trip if
it doesn’t get enough people? How late can you cancel if you’re
unable to go? Do you get a refund if you cancel? If the operator 
cancels?
 How jam-packed is the schedule? Does the tour schedule try to fit
25 hours worth of activity into a 24-hour day, or does it give you
ample time to relax by the pool or shop? If getting up at 7 a.m.
every day and not returning to your hotel until 6 or 7 p.m. sounds
like a grind, certain escorted tours may not be for you.
 How large is the group? The smaller the group, the less time you
spend waiting for people to get on and off the bus. Tour operators
may give you an evasive answer to this question because they may
not know the exact size of the group until everybody has made
Chapter 6: Getting to Scotland 81

reservations, but they should be able to give you a rough estimate.
Also, get an idea of the general age range of the group; whether the
tour’s geared to seniors, students, families, or some other demo-
graphic may affect your decision to sign up.
 Is there a minimum group size? Some tours have a minimum
group size and may cancel the tour if it doesn’t book enough
people. Find out if a quota exists and how close the operator is to
reaching it. Again, tour operators may be evasive in their answers,
but it may help you select a tour that’s sure to happen.
 What exactly is included? Don’t assume anything. You may have to
pay to get yourself to and from the airport. A box lunch may be
included in an excursion, but drinks may be extra. How much flexi-
bility do you have? Can you opt out of certain activities, or does
the bus leave once a day with no exceptions? Are all your meals
planned in advance? Can you choose your entree at dinner?
Depending on your recreational passions, one of the following escorted
tour companies may suit you:
 CIE Tours International (% 800-CIE-TOUR; www.cietours.com)
does tours of the United Kingdom and offers a five-day, four-night
escorted tour of Scotland, among other tours. The Web site fea-
tures a helpful tour index with package prices, descriptions, and
itineraries. Expect to pay around $700 (not counting airfare) per
person.
 Cosmos (% 800-276-1241; www.cosmosvacations.com) is the
budget arm of Globus (see below) and offers scaled down versions
of the Globus trips (although you don’t see a great price differ-
ence), with a tour guide and motorcoach on hand at all times.
Prices (including airfare) run from $1,400 to $1,900 per person.
 Globus (% 866-755-8581; www.globusandcosmos.com) is a first-
class, worldwide tour company. Globus has comprehensive 9- and
15-day tours of Scotland. You can book a whole package (including
airfare, meals, hotels, and so on) or find your own cheap plane
ticket (good for those travelers racking up frequent-flier miles) and
book only the bus-tour part with Globus. Prices (including airfare)
range from about $1,775 to $3,250 per person.
 Scottish Tours (% 0131-557-8008; www.scottishtours.co.uk)
offers six minitours in air-conditioned buses departing from
Edinburgh. The most elaborate is a three-day, two-night excursion
that goes from the Scottish capital to Inverness on day one and
then visits the northeastern tip of the country. Per person rates
start at around £10 ($19) for one-day trips and go up to £225 ($416)
for two nights (including breakfast and accommodations).

Choosing a Package Tour
For lots of destinations, package tours can be a smart way to go. In many
cases, a package tour that includes airfare, hotel, and transportation to
and from the airport costs less than the hotel alone on a tour you book
yourself. That’s because packages are sold in bulk to tour operators,
who then resell them to the public.
Package tours can vary widely. Some offer a better class of hotels than
others; some provide the same hotels for lower prices. Some book flights
on scheduled airlines; others sell charters. In certain packages, your
choice of accommodations and travel days may be limited. Some tours
let you choose between escorted vacations and independent vacations;
others allow you to add on just a few excursions or escorted day trips
(also at discounted prices) without booking an entirely escorted tour.
Depending on your interests, one of the following packaged tour compa-
nies may suit you.
 Brian Moore International Tours (% 800-982-2299; www.bmit.com)
offers “Air Inclusive” vacations to Edinburgh from around $500
during the low season.
 CIE Tours International (% 800-CIE-TOUR; www.cietours.com):
Details can be found in the section “Joining an Escorted Tour,” ear-
lier in this chapter.
 Thistle Golf (Scotland) Limited (% 0141-248-4554; www.thistle
golf.co.uk) offers various golfing tours, such as one that covers
both Ayrshire in the southwest and St. Andrews northeast of
Edinburgh. Prices depend on the touring region and the length of
your stay, so contact the company for details.

Getting Around Scotland
In This Chapter
 Renting cars and navigating one-lane highways in Scotland
 Catching the breathtaking views by train or bus
 Getting to the beautiful islands by ferry
You do have choices when it comes to getting around Scotland:
train, car, bus, ferry, bicycle, or on foot. Some visitors to Scotland
rent cars for the duration of their visits because automobiles provide a
sense of mobility that travelers appreciate — and are accustomed to.
Certainly, in remote areas such as the Highlands, some form of personal
transportation is almost essential because towns and villages are few
and far between; plus, public transportation can be limited.
Still, if your budget restraints, length of stay, or specific destinations
don’t make driving mandatory, a variety of public transportation options
can get you where you need to go. I have been from Glasgow to the isles
of Mull and Iona, and even farther afield to the Outer Hebrides, depend-
ing solely on trains, buses, and ferries (plus my own two feet and a
rented bicycle or taxi). It imposed some limitations, for sure, but it also
liberated me from the burden of driving, either in traffic or on bendy,
one-lane roads. If your trip is primarily to Edinburgh and/or Glasgow,
you don’t really need a car at all.
But I have also toured the very northern parts of the country in a rented
camper-van, taking my time, stopping frequently to have a better look at
the majestic scenery, and taking detours whenever I liked. Just remem-
ber, if you are traveling throughout Scotland by road, the country is a
virtual archipelago. Settlements are separated by deep valleys, ragged
mountains, and especially long lochs; you may have to travel 100 miles
to cover 50 miles as the proverbial crow would fly. Plus, remote areas
often have only single-lane roads, which will keep your speed down.
This all means that some journeys, which don’t seem far on the map,
may take longer than anticipated, as narrow roads wind up and over
mountains — or snake around the shores of lochs.

Getting Around by Car
For certain, seeing Scotland by car has its advantages, most notably the
lack of timetables to keep in mind and greater control over where you
want to go and when you want to go there. But you need to be aware of
some driving-related issues that you will encounter while exploring
Scotland by car.
To drive a car in Scotland for a limited period (up to 12 months), be cer-
tain that you have a valid driver’s license issued by local authorities
where you live permanently; you don’t need any special license.
Getting along with fewer road signs
One of the biggest complaints that tourists have about driving around
Scotland is the relative paucity of road signs. Most major attractions are
well marked, but the motorways around cities can be confusing, access
roads within the city are tricky to navigate, and country highways often
seem to lack the necessary signage. Having a good map close at hand (as
well as a navigator who can read it) to help track your progress is always
helpful. When in doubt, however, simply stop and ask for directions.
Keeping up with changing street names
You’re in a city, you’re driving along such-and-such road, then suddenly
it has a new name, and two minutes later it changes again. This curious
phenomenon may come up as you ply Scotland’s city streets. For exam-
ple, the famous Royal Mile in Edinburgh, between the castle and Palace
of Holyroodhouse, actually takes four different names along the way,
from Castlehill to Canongate. Now that’s royally confusing. Again, keep a
map handy and refer to it often.
Driving on the left, roundabouts, and other differences
If you’re used to driving on the right-hand side of the road, driving on
the left-hand side is a shock initially. Perhaps what feels the strangest is
the fact that the driver’s seat and wheel are on the right-hand side of the
car while the gearshift is on the left (although the relative positions of
the clutch, brake pedal, and accelerator are the same).
Like in the rest of Europe, most cars in Scotland have manual transmis-
sions and stick shifts. If you need an automatic, make sure to request
one specifically when reserving your rental car or van.
You merge to the right to get on highways, and you pass cars on the
right while slower traffic stays in the left lanes. Don’t pass cars (overtake
in local parlance) by using a left-hand lane designed for slower traffic. I
know you may use the slower traffic lanes all the time at home for pass-
ing cars, but it’s rarely seen here. Overtake slower traffic only by using
right-hand lanes meant for faster traffic. And after you’ve safely passed
someone, the courtesy to other drivers who may want to pass you is to
return to a center or left-hand lane.
Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 85

Roundabouts (traffic circles) can be slightly tricky, but you get the hang
of them. First, traffic moves in a clockwise direction through round-
abouts. As you near one, remember that any traffic approaching you
from the right, either in the roundabout or entering the roundabout, has
the right of way. You must always yield to traffic approaching from the
right, and only drive into the roundabout when traffic clears from the
right. Once in, use your left turn signal to indicate which exit you intend
to take from a roundabout. If you find yourself driving in a right-hand
lane toward the core of a roundabout and can’t get safely to your
desired exit (on the left), don’t barge across. Simply go around the circle
again and prepare to exit the next time you approach your exit.
Staying safe on “single-track” roads
When you’re driving through the rural countryside or in small villages,
it’s quite common to find only one lane, or single-track, roads carrying
two-way traffic. Don’t panic. These roads will always have passing
places, often marked with a sign. If you see a vehicle approaching in the
opposite direction, pull into the passing place, if it’s on your left, giving
the other person room to pass. You can confirm your intentions by put-
ting on your left turn signal (and you may find that some drivers will
flash their headlights in recognition).
If, however, the passing place is to the right on the single-track road, do
not pull into it. Stop where you are and just stay put (put on your left
turn signal if you like) and allow the oncoming vehicle to use the pull-
over space in order to slide by you.
In general, the driver who gets to a passing place first is meant to use it,
but don’t get involved in games of “chicken” to see who pulls off first. Play
it safe and be the one to give way. Also, on hills, the vehicle going uphill
has the right of way, as it is safer to reverse up a slope than down one.
It’s a simple courtesy to acknowledge the other driver (who’s passing
you or whom you’re passing) with a small wave, sometimes as simple as
a raised finger (not the middle one) from the steering wheel.
Planning your gasoline expenditures
Gas, called petrol in Scotland, is costly. Like everywhere, the cost of gaso-
line in Scotland has risen this decade. Remember that the prices posted
here are per liter, not per gallon. You may find yourself paying more than
$2 for a liter — and there are nearly four of them in a gallon. (Does public
transportation sound a bit more appealing now?) Obviously, to get the
best gas mileage, rent the smallest vehicle you can. A small car also helps
you more easily navigate narrow roads.
Laying down the law on parking
In cities and towns, you will find some parking garages and outdoor car
lots. Street parking is also fine, but don’t assume that the absence of
American-style meters means that parking on the street is free. Check
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
86

the signs. You may have to buy a ticket from a nearby machine that indi-
cates how long you can stay. Purchase a ticket and use the sticky back-
ing paper to affix it to your window. This system is used in some parking
lots, too. Some residential neighborhoods in the cities are very restric-
tive and allow only local residents to park in available places. Also, you
can never park where there is a double yellow line running along the
curb, nor where you see a zigzag white line.
Safety tips to know before you get behind the wheel
Here are some important traffic rules and laws to help you get around
safely and legally.
 At intersections marked with an inverted triangle (with the point
facing you) or at roundabouts, yield to traffic.
 You should not make left-hand turns (the equivalent of right-hand
turns in America) when the traffic light is red.
 The general speed limit on the open road is 60 mph (96kmph)
unless otherwise posted. Standard 60 mph (96kmph) signs bear
only a black circle with a slash mark through it. When the speed
limit is other than 60 mph (96kmph), you see a sign with a red
circle and the limit written inside in black. You often see these
signs when entering small towns, where you should reduce your
speed to 30 mph (48kmph), which is also the limit in cities, unless
otherwise marked. On motorways, the speed limit is generally 70
mph (113kmph), although plenty of drivers go faster.
 At zebra cross walks with a flashing yellow globe light, you yield to
pedestrian traffic but proceed with caution when clear.
 A sign with a red circle and a red X through the middle means no
stopping or parking during posted hours. A zigzag white line along
the curb also means no parking or stopping unless it’s due to traffic
signals or congestion.
 Drivers and front-seat passengers must wear seat belts. If your car
has back-seat belts, passengers seated there should wear them also.
Renting a Car
Rates for car rental (or car hire, as the Scots say) can vary. The price
depends on the size of the car, the length of time you keep it, where and
when you pick it up and drop it off, where you take it, and other factors.
Asking a few key questions may save you money.
 Companies add a drop-off charge if you don’t return the car to the
same rental location.
 Ask if the rate is cheaper if you pick up the car at a location in town
rather than at the airport (which sometimes add a tax).
Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 87

 Find out whether age is an issue. Some car-rental companies add a
fee for drivers under 25 — and some don’t rent to them at all.
 If you see an advertised price, be sure to ask for that specific rate;
otherwise you may be charged the standard (higher) rate. Don’t
forget to mention membership in AAA, AARP, trade unions, and
other associations, such as university alumni groups, when making
a reservation. These memberships may entitle you to discounts.
 Check your frequent-flier accounts for special deals.
 Weekend rates may be lower than weekday rates. If you’re keeping
the car five or more days, a weekly rate may be cheaper than the
daily rate. Ask if the rate is the same for pickup on Friday morning
as it is on Thursday night.
 As with other aspects of planning your trip, using the Internet can
make comparison shopping for a car rental much easier. You can
check rates at most of the major rental agencies’ Web sites. Plus, all
the major travel sites — Travelocity (www.travelocity.com),
Expedia (www.expedia.com), Orbitz (www.orbitz.com), and
SmarterTravel.com (www.smartertravel.com), for example —
have search engines that can dig up discounted car-rental rates.
Just enter the car size you want and the pickup and return dates
and locations, and the server returns a price. You can even make
the reservation through any of these sites.
In addition to the standard rental prices, some optional charges might
apply to car rentals (and some not-so-optional charges, such as taxes).
In Scotland, you can pay a bit more to reduce the amount you would be
obligated to shell out if you have an accident. For example, an additional
$8 per day for a weekly rental will reduce your deductible (or excess in
the U.K.) considerably. Regardless, the car is fully insured against
damage you incur to your vehicle or someone else’s.
Some companies have a habit of giving you a vehicle with a partially full
tank and you must return it with just that amount. If it is less, they will
charge you a premium to get it back to the right level. Make sure you are
clear how much is in the tank before you leave with your rental.
Because the driver’s side is on the right in Scotland, your left arm, not
your right, controls the stick shift. Rental companies have few vehicles
with automatic transmissions, so request one specifically if you don’t
know how to operate a manual transmission — or don’t think your left
arm is up to it. Minivans, or people movers, are more likely to offer the
option of automatic transmissions.
As for the class of car available, you can expect a variety of levels:
budget or small (generally two-door run-arounds), compact (small but
might have four doors), medium or midsize (four doors, more head
room, and larger trunk), and large or family (bigger still). Companies
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
88

often offer upgrades. You may think you want a larger vehicle, but keep
in mind that roads can be narrow. Get the smallest car you can, taking
into consideration your driving comfort, the comfort of your fellow trav-
elers, and the amount of luggage you’re carrying. Air-conditioning and
unlimited mileage are standard, but always confirm that there are no
mileage charges.
The following are a couple of issues you need to address when arranging
for your rental car.
 Where and when to pick up the car: If you fly into Edinburgh or
Glasgow and plan to stay in the city for two or more days, wait to
get the car until you’re just about to head out to the countryside. In
the city, you don’t need a car. Some companies have pickup loca-
tions in or near the city. If you’re planning to leave town immedi-
ately or early the next morning, however, getting the car upon
arrival is a good idea. You can set out according to plan, and you
save the time and hassle of having to go back to the airport or
locate the rental agency the next day.
 How to pay for the car: Some companies require a deposit, gener-
ally on a credit card, when you make your reservation. If you book
by phone, the clerk may ask for the card number then; otherwise,
you use your credit card at the rental desk.
If you’re not sure how long you need a car (if, maybe, you’re thinking
about coming back to Glasgow early to see more city sights), book your
rental for the shorter amount of time and extend it from the road with a
simple phone call rather than bringing the car back early. If you’ve
booked a car for a week but bring it back after only four days, the com-
pany will post the refund to your credit card.
Rental-car companies in Scotland
All the major rental agencies are represented at the country’s two pri-
mary airports. In addition, in Glasgow, you can find
 Arnold Clark: multiple locations (% 0845-607-4500; www.arnold
clarkrental.com)
 Avis: 70 Lancefield St. (% 0870-608-6339; www.avis.co.uk)

Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 89

Taking the Train
First ScotRail runs the trains in Scotland. It’s not a publicly owned com-
pany, but rather a state-subsidized private firm that has a contract to
operate the trains. To confuse matters, the railway lines are owned by a
different, pseudo-private company called Network Rail (formerly
Railtrack). Privatization of the railways has proved to be a poor decision
for most of Great Britain, which once led the way in the development of
the railroad.
The advantage of train travel is that you can generally sit back, relax,
and enjoy the scenery in a way that is often difficult when traveling by
road. With some exceptions, the trains in Scotland are reasonably effi-
cient and comfortable. On the downside, trains are more expensive than
in most European countries, and they travel to fewer destinations than
would be ideal. Curiously, some of the long-haul routes (for example,
Glasgow to Inverness) use carriages that don’t have sufficient space for
luggage. Nevertheless, when the trains run on time, railway travel is a
good way to get from one part of the country to another.
Edinburgh Waverley has trains going southeast toward Berwick, west to
Glasgow, northwest toward Stirling, and north through Fife, Tayside, and
the Northeast. Glasgow’s Central Station is the terminus for trains going
southwest through Ayrshire and west to Greenock. Glasgow’s Queen
Street Station offers service to the west (Helenburgh, for example),
northwest into Argyll and the Highlands, and north through Stirling and
on into Tayside and Northeast. For journey planning, contact Traveline
Scotland at % 0870-608-2608, or log on to

Does your boot go in your luggage 
or your luggage in your boot?
To spare you the confusion of car-related words and phrases in Scotland, here’s a list
of the most commonly used (and most commonly confused) terms you may come across.
 boot: trunk
 bonnet: hood
 motorways: freeways
 pavement: sidewalk
 petrol: gasoline
 roundabouts: traffic circles (or “rotaries” if you’re a New Englander); make sure
you go left and yield to the right

Generally speaking, you should have no problem buying tickets a half-
hour before departure. But to save money and ensure you have seats on
the longer trips, it never hurts to reserve in advance. For 24-hour rail
and fare information, call National Rail Enquiries % 08457-484-950, or
log on to www.firstscotrail.com. For general inquires, call First
ScotRail at % 0845-601-5929.
Seeing Scotland by Bus
Buses are an adequate way to see Scotland. They often make more stops
than the trains and are thus slower. But they cost less. The usual down-
sides apply to bus travel: Unlike when you have a rental car, you’re not
free to stop wherever and whenever you want — you’re stuck with the
same people for hours at a time, and there’s not much space to move.
Regardless, the seating is comfortable, and the bus is a good way to
meet people. For journey planning, contact Traveline Scotland at 
% 0870-608-2608, or log on to www.travelinescotland.com.
Scottish Citylink is Scotland’s largest cross-country bus company. It offers
services to 200 towns and cities across Scotland, including Glasgow,
Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen, Stirling, Perth, Inverness, Aviemore,
Thurso, Ullapool, Oban, Campbeltown, Lochgilphead, Fort William,
Portree, Glencoe, Dunfermline, and Dumfries. Information, prices, times,
and routes can be obtained by calling % 0870-550-5050 or by visiting
www.citylink.co.uk. Stagecoach is another major operator, running
buses to northeast Scotland, the Highlands, and through central and
southern areas. The company can be reached by calling % 01292-613-500
or by visiting www.stagecoachbus.com.
Sightseeing bus tours can give a taste of the often-stunning countryside
on one-, two-, and three-day excursions. If this is your kind of travel, con-
sider the following tour companies.
 Heart of Scotland Tours (% 0131-558-8855; www.heartof
scotlandtours.co.uk) offers one-day minibus tours that depart
from Edinburgh’s Waterloo Place near Calton Hill at 8 and 9 a.m.,
returning to Edinburgh between 6 and 8 p.m. Prices range from £26
to £32 ($48–$59).
 MacBackpackers (% 0131-558-9900; www.macbackpackers.com), a
company that runs youth hostels, offers tours of Scotland stopping
at places such as Pitlochry, Inverness, Skye, Fort William, Oban, and
Edinburgh. A five-day tour is about £125 ($231). Accommodations
are not included, but they are guaranteed at hostels, which can cost
upwards of £14 ($26) per night.
 Scottish Tours (% 0141-880-3399, or 800-890-7375 in the U.S.; www.
scottishtours.co.uk) offers one- to six-day sightseeing tours of
the country in air-conditioned buses. The most elaborate is the
“Highland Explorer” package, which departs from either Edinburgh
or Glasgow, taking passengers to Inverness, the jumping-off point 
Chapter 7: Getting Around Scotland 91

for minibus excursions with a local guide to the Isle of Skye, John
O’Groats, and more. Prices start at £10 to £31 ($19–$57) for one-day
trips and go up to £560 ($1,036) for a single tourist on the five-day
tour (including breakfast and hotel accommodations).
 Timberbush Tours (% 0131-226-6066; www.timberbush-tours.
co.uk) uses minibuses to take small groups to various locations,
from Edinburgh (from half-day to three-day) and Glasgow (one-day
only). One half-day tour is called “Kings, Queens & Heroes,” and
operates off season, stopping at Linlithgow, Bannockburn, and
Stirling. Prices for the three-day tour to Skye, the Highlands, and
Loch Ness range from £91 ($168) in low season to £112 ($207) at
the height of summer. Prices cover only transportation and guide.
By Plane
Internal Scottish flights may be the way to go if you need to get from
Glasgow or Edinburgh to Inverness, Stornoway, or Kirkwall in a hurry.
Services were recently transferred to a “discount” airline, Flybe
(% 0871-700-2000, or 44-1392-268-500 from outside the U.K.; www.
flybe.com), which now operates flights for LoganAir (% 0141-
848-7594; www.loganair.co.uk). No matter what the carrier, the 
flights are not cheap. You may pay up to $300 for a short trip. Go to 
the airport Web sites for latest details on flights, times, and carriers:
www.edinburghairport.com or www.glasgowairport.com.
Finally, by Ferry
The preferable way (if you ask me) to get to the Scottish islands or from
one island to the next in the Hebrides (see Chapter 19) is by ferry. Few
trips are more sublime than those that include a boat ride on Scotland’s
picturesque seas. One company, Caledonian MacBrayne, or CalMac for
short, runs the major routes between islands. You can take your car on
most of the ferries, but a few islands are vehicle-free and want to stay
that way. Remember to call the day before you hope to go out, because
heavy seas can cancel ferry travel.
If you plan to see more than one island, you might look into CalMac’s
“Island Hopscotch” fares, which offer island-hopping tickets to selected
destinations and are valid for one month. For example you can rove from
the mainland ferry terminal at Mallaig to Skye, Skye to Harris, Harris to
Uist, and Uist back to the mainland port of Oban.
 Caledonian MacBrayne (% 01475-650-100; www.calmac.co.uk),
or CalMac, as it’s more colloquially known, serves 22 islands and
four peninsulas over the western coast of Scotland.
 NorthLink Ferries (% 0845-600-0449; www.northlinkferries.
co.uk) sails to Shetland and Orkney.

Booking Your
Accommodations
In This Chapter
 Knowing what to expect in the way of accommodations
 Estimating how much you’ll pay to stay
 Determining your lodging needs
 Finding the best rates and reserving the best rooms
I
n this chapter, I provide an overview of the types of accommodations
available in Scotland, helping you choose what feels right in terms of
style, comfort, and budget. Individual accommodations listings appear
in each city and regional chapter later in this book (Part III and Part IV).
Getting to Know Your Options
The Scottish Tourist Board, or, as it prefers to be called, VisitScotland,
has instituted a grading system that ranks all types of accommodations
on the basis of their available amenities, as well as more subjective crite-
ria such as hospitality, ambience, food, and the condition of the property.
This ranking system can be useful, but it can also be misleading. The
ranking may be lower than the place actually deserves simply because a
room lacks a telephone or doesn’t include a television. Decide if certain
amenities, such as a minibar or trouser press in your room, are important
to you, and then find out what’s being offered by hotels or B&Bs.
Accommodations involved in the grading system display a blue plaque
or sticker (usually on or by the door) showing the number of stars
earned. If you don’t see the plaque and the lodging isn’t in the grading
system, it’s not necessarily a bad place to stay, but if you have a 
bad experience, the tourist board has no authority to reprimand the
establishment.
The tourist board’s grading system doesn’t rate the size, location, or
price of the place. And remember, it also only rates those establish-
ments that pay to join the tourist board and its scheme, which means
that some worthy accommodations are conspicuously absent.

Knowing What You’ll Pay
I’ve tried to include some options for the budget-minded, but you should
anticipate that accommodations eat up a good chunk of your traveling
expenses. In all my listings, the cost of a double room — one room for
you and a guest to stay in together — is given. I often give you a price
range for a double room, which might reflect different room sizes, rooms
with views compared to those with none, or the off-season rate com-
pared to the high-season rate. Most places offer a full breakfast — or at
least a light Continental breakfast — as part of the rate.
Each hotel listing is prefaced with a number of dollar signs, ranging from
one ($) to four ($$$$), corresponding to price. Use Table 8-1 as a pricing
scale for quick reference; it shows you what to expect for room size and
standard amenities in each of these price categories.

Determining Your Accommodations Needs
Unless you are going to focus exclusively on one region, you probably
won’t be staying in a rented castle or a cottage during your trip to
Scotland. Check the Internet or local tourism boards for just the right
mansion or quaint cottage amid the heather for you.
It’s much more likely that you’ll be staying in the more common choices
for accommodations in Scotland: hotels, B&Bs, and guesthouses.
Wherever you stay, you can expect generally friendly service, clean
rooms, and a decent breakfast. Smaller hotels with dining rooms, how-
ever, can be quite restrictive about when food is available.
The quality of food offered can vary from inn to inn. You may be frus-
trated to find that although you’re staying in a hotel at the edge of a
plentiful loch, the fish on the menu is frozen and deep-fried. If cuisine is
important to you, do a bit of homework before you decide where you’re
going to stay, especially if dinners are included in the room price.
Other accommodations options include self-catering properties, which
have kitchen facilities, and youth hostels.
You can find out much about the country’s different types of accommo-
dations and available package deals at the tourist board’s Web site,
www.visitscotland.com. The site lists a range of lodging choices,
including hotels, guesthouses, bed-and-breakfasts, caravan and camping
parks, and self-catering cottages.
Hotels
In most hotel rooms, you find tea- and instant-coffee-making equipment
(electric kettles and cups) in most rooms. Bellhops (porters) aren’t so
common, however, except in the posh places. And smaller hotels some-
times lock their front doors at certain (late) hours, so you may have to
ring the bell or knock to be let in after hours. Conversely, in the more
remote areas, they probably never lock the front door if staff is on the
premises. As a practice and courtesy, though, try to let a member of
hotel staff know if you plan to be out late.
Hotels are used to catering to tourists, and many will be helpful. You can
expect the furnishings to be comfortable, and many of the larger and
chain hotels have gyms, room service, and an in-house restaurant and
pub. Because you’re a resident, hotels are required to keep the bar open
until you retire for the night (but don’t abuse the privilege).
Hotel chains can be found in Scotland’s cities and larger towns. In some
cases, taverns or restaurants have overnight rooms, too. If you choose
to take a room in a pub, just be certain you’re not going to be troubled if
the Saturday night karaoke goes on until midnight.
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 95

Bed-and-breakfasts (B&Bs)
Many Scottish B&Bs and guesthouses take their hospitality seriously.
You usually get to know the owners (likely the same folks who cook and
serve your breakfast) — and you may come away feeling that you’ve
made a new friend or two. A guesthouse is, for the most part, the same
thing as a B&B, although generally a little larger.
Some B&Bs offer just a spare and comfortable bedroom (usually with a
bathroom attached) in someone’s home. Some B&B rooms, however, are
not en suite, meaning each room doesn’t have a private bathroom. If
you’re completely averse to sharing facilities with the folks down the
hall, make sure you ask for a room with its own bathroom (which may
cost a bit more).
Bed-and-breakfasts aren’t large — most are lucky to have four guest
rooms. The better-known B&Bs tend to fill up quickly during the high
season, so make your reservations as early as possible. Some B&Bs
don’t accept credit cards, so be prepared to pay in cash.
One advantage of choosing B&Bs over hotels is the price: They can be
much less expensive, but you don’t get the extra amenities of a hotel.
Self-catering cottages
Properties offered as self-catering run the gamut from modern apartments
to rooms within castles to country cottages. I list a few but not many.
Taking a self-catering cottage is similar to renting a condo. It’s a place to
settle into and do things like you might at home. At self-catering proper-
ties, you can cook your own meals and make your own beds (or not).
Be certain you know what is provided in a self-catering facility — for
example, the provision of towels and bed linens may cost extra.
With self-catering properties, the price isn’t calculated per person and is
generally set for the week (although some also rent by the weekend, for
two to three days). When you take into account the amount of money
you would pay for hotels and B&Bs, staying in a self-catering lodging can
cut costs considerably. Food costs also decrease when you’re buying
your own and cooking it yourself. If you’re budget-minded, self-catering
is an option worth checking out.
A good place to begin researching self-catering properties is the
Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterers (www.assc.co.uk), whose mem-
bers include owners and operators of a wide range of self-catering prop-
erties, from cottages to chalets to lodges to castles.
Hostels
Hostels have a reputation of being the accommodations of choice for
students and frugal travelers. If the image you have of hostels is a place
full of young, perky travelers who can go for long stretches without
showers or food, you’re partly correct (though only partly). Hostels are
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
96

for independent travelers who cherish flexibility and want to stick to a
frugal accommodations budget. And although these accommodations
are called “youth hostels,” they take guests of any age, even if most of
the people you encounter are in their 20s. They’re also usually really
great places to meet fellow travelers.
Hostels sometimes don’t allow guests to remain in the building during
the day. You may have to get out and about from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.,
whether you like it or not.
Quality and service vary from one hostel to the next throughout Scotland.
Some hostels offer communal kitchens for you to bring in and cook your
own food. Some even have private rooms with en-suite bathrooms.
Families can also stay in hostels, renting a room with four bunks. The
majority of hostels, though, are places where people sleep dorm-style —
anywhere from four to dozens of people to a room, usually in bunk beds.
Hostels provide a blanket and pillow and sometimes sheets, but to be
safe, you should bring your own sleeping bag or sleep sack (or expect to
rent sheets from the hostel).
As for the bathrooms: Think of high school gym restrooms or your col-
lege dorm — tiles, a row of sinks, toilet cubicles, and shower stalls,
sometimes spotlessly immaculate, sometimes appallingly grimy. You
may not love it, but it gets the job done.
You can usually get a hostel bed for £10 ($19) a night and you will rarely
pay more than £20 ($37).
Chapter 8: Booking Your Accommodations 97
Hello? Is this Scotland?
If you want to book your room over the phone, or if the place where you want to stay
doesn’t take Internet reservations, you need to know how to call Scotland. To call
Scotland from anywhere in the world, dial the international access code (for example,
011 from the U.S.), then the country code (44 for the U.K.), then the city or local code (for
example, Glasgow is 141), and then the number. (Note: When you’re calling from within
Great Britain, you need to add a zero before the city code.)
For example, if you’re in the States and you want to call a favorite watering hole in
Glasgow, the Babbity Bowster, just to make sure they’ll have enough wine ready when
you get there, you dial:
International
Country
City
Number
011
+
44
+
141
+
552-5055
Remember, Scotland is five hours ahead of Eastern Time in the U.S. (eight hours ahead
of the West Coast). If it’s 1 p.m. in Philadelphia, it’s 6 p.m. in Peterhead. If you’re trying
to call a business in Scotland, call before noon Eastern Time to be safe (before 9 a.m. in
San Francisco).

One general resource to check out is www.hostels.com. And if you
know you’ll be taking the backpacking route through Scotland, you may
want to contact the Scottish Youth Hostel Association (% 0870-
155-3255 for reservations, or 01786-891-400 for general inquiries;
www.syha.org.uk).
Security isn’t a major problem in Scotland’s hostels, but it’s something
to consider. Any time you’re sleeping in a room full of strangers, take
precautions to ensure the safety of yourself and your personal belong-
ings. If your hostel doesn’t provide lockers, lock your luggage, if it seems
appropriate, or make your bags as difficult to get into as possible. Also,
bring your wallet, passport, purse, and any other valuables into bed
with you, for safekeeping.
Finding the Best Room at the Best Rate
The rack rate is the maximum price a hotel charges for a room. It’s the
rate you get if you walk in off the street and ask for a room for the night.
You sometimes see these rates printed on the fire/emergency exit dia-
grams posted on the back of your door.
Hotels are happy to charge you the rack rate, but you can almost always
do better. Perhaps the best way to avoid paying the rack rate is quite
simple: Just ask for a cheaper or discounted rate. You may be pleasantly
surprised.
In all but the smallest accommodations, the rate you pay for a room
depends on many factors — chief among them being how you make your
reservation. A travel agent may be able to negotiate a better price with
certain hotels than you can get by yourself. (That’s because the hotel
often gives the agent a discount in exchange for steering his or her busi-
ness toward that hotel.)
Reserving a room through the hotel’s toll-free reservation number may
result in a lower rate than calling the hotel directly. On the other hand,
the central reservations number may not know about discount rates at
specific locations. For example, local franchises may offer a special
group rate for a wedding or family reunion, but they may neglect to tell
the central booking line. Your best bet is to call both the local number
and the toll-free number and see which one gives you a better deal.
Room rates (even rack rates) change with the season, as occupancy
rates rise and fall. But even within a given season, room prices are sub-
ject to change without notice, so the rates quoted in this book may be
different from the actual rate you receive when you make your reserva-
tion. Be sure to mention membership in AAA, AARP, frequent-flyer pro-
grams, any other corporate rewards programs you can think of — even
your Uncle Joe’s Elks lodge in which you’re an honorary inductee, for
that matter — when you call to book. You never know when the affilia-
tion may be worth a few dollars off your room rate.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
98

Remember, in Scotland, lodging rates fall from about the beginning of
October until Christmas and New Year’s (when they jump up to high-
season prices for a couple of weeks), and then they stay more affordable
until mid-March or Easter. Some of the nicer country-house hotels close
entirely in January. See Chapter 3 for a discussion of Scotland’s high- and
low-travel seasons. If you think you want a package tour that includes
accommodations, flip to Chapter 6.
Surfing the Web for hotel deals
Independent Internet hotel-booking agencies representing hotels and
guesthouses in Scotland have multiplied in mind-boggling numbers, and
they’re the best way to get a reduced price for a room. Shopping online
for hotels is generally done one of two ways: by booking through the
hotel’s own Web site or through an independent booking agency (or a
fare-service agency such as Priceline). Keep in mind that prices can vary
considerably from site to site, and be aware that hotels at the top of a
site’s listing may be there for no other reason than that they paid money
to get the placement.
In addition to the online travel booking sites Travelocity, Expedia,
Orbitz, Priceline, and Hotwire, you can book hotels through
Hotels.com, Quikbook (www.quikbook.com), and Travelaxe
(www.travelaxe.net).
HotelChatter.com is a daily webzine offering smart coverage and critiques
of hotels worldwide. Go to TripAdvisor.com or HotelShark.com for help-
ful independent consumer reviews of hotels and resort properties.
For online hotel-reservations services in Scotland, try www.visit
scotland.com or www.hotelreviewscotland.com. If you’re looking 
for something more unusual, you may want to consider a farm stay; you
can find information at www.scotfarmhols.co.uk.
It’s a good idea to get a confirmation number and make a printout of
any online booking transaction.
Reserving the Best Room
After you make your reservation, asking one or two more pointed ques-
tions can go a long way toward making sure you get the best room in the
house. Always ask for a corner room. They’re usually larger, quieter, and
have more windows and light than standard rooms, and they don’t
always cost more. Also ask if the hotel is renovating; if it is, request a
room away from the renovation work. Inquire, too, about the location of
the restaurants, bars, and discos in the hotel — all sources of annoying
noise. And if you aren’t happy with your room when you arrive, talk to
the front desk. If they have another room, they should be happy to
accommodate you, within reason.

Traveling with the Brood: Advice for Families
Scotland may not top the list of countries that ease the burden of traveling
with children, but it is getting better. Some posh country-house hotels actu-
ally discourage families with children and/or prohibit toddlers from the
dining room at night. Throughout this book, I flag (with the kid-friendly
icon) those spots that are particularly appealing prospects for families.
You can find good family-oriented vacation advice on the Internet at
 Family Travel Files (www.thefamilytravelfiles.com): A site
that offers an online magazine and a directory of off-the-beaten-
path tours and tour operators for families
 Family Travel Forum (www.familytravelforum.com): A compre-
hensive site that offers customized trip planning
 Family Travel Network (www.familytravelnetwork.com): An
award-winning site that offers travel features, deals, and tips
 Traveling Internationally with Your Kids (www.travelwith
yourkids.com): A comprehensive site that offers customized trip
planning

To help ensure a peaceful trip with children in tow, take care of a few
preliminaries before lift-off.
 Check what your children have packed. You want to make sure that
they have the clothes necessary for any changes in the weather
and make sure they haven’t over-packed.
 Bring a few toys for younger children, but nothing that can’t be
replaced if it’s lost along the way.
 Music and even books on tape or CD are great diversions. Small
games work well for those times when the scenery isn’t sufficiently
engaging. Having a deck of cards handy is a good idea for restau-
rant visits.
Getting to Scotland and exploring with kids
Remember, each child, regardless of age, is expected to have a passport.
Some airlines offer child-companion fares and have a children’s menu
upon request.
Car-rental companies in Scotland will provide necessary car seats, and
all vehicles have rear seatbelts. The law requires that children be buck-
led in regardless of whether they’re in the front or back seats.
Keep in mind that most attractions and some public-transportation
options offer reduced prices for children. And most attractions, even
places that don’t seem particularly family-oriented, offer family group
prices (usually for two adults and two or three children).
To locate accommodations, restaurants, and attractions that are particu-
larly kid-friendly, refer to the “Kids” icon throughout this guide.
Finding a family-friendly hotel
Contact your hotel, guesthouse, or B&B before you go to find out about
potential cost-cutting accommodations for families with children. Many
times, an extra cot for a child is just a small additional cost — a welcome
exception to the per-person pricing standard in Scotland. Also, some
places have a baby-sitter list, in case you opt for a grown-ups’ night out.
For a list of more family-friendly travel resources, visit www.frommers.

Making Age Work for You: Advice for Seniors
Most of the paid attractions in Scotland offer discounts (tickets called
concessions) to senior citizens (pensioners or OAPs — which stands for
old age pensioners — in local lingo). Most public transportation is less
costly for older people, too, although local service may require a special
ID that’s too much of a bother to obtain if you’re only in town for a day
Chapter 9: Catering to Special Travel Needs or Interests 101

or two. People older than age 60 usually qualify for reduced admission
to theaters, museums, and other attractions as well as discounted fares
on public transportation. Hotels may offer discounts for seniors.
Members of AARP (formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons), 601 E St. NW, Washington, DC 20049 (% 888-687-2277
or 202-434-2277; www.aarp.org), are eligible for discounts on hotels, 
airfares, and car rentals.
Elderhostel (% 877-426-8056; www.elderhostel.org) arranges study
programs in more than 80 countries around the world for those ages 55
and older (and a companion of any age). Most courses last for two to
four weeks abroad, and many include airfare, modest accommodations,
meals, and tuition.
Recommended publications offering travel resources and discounts for
seniors include: the quarterly magazine Travel 50 & Beyond (www.
travel50andbeyond.com); Travel Unlimited: Uncommon Adventures
for the Mature Traveler (Avalon); 101 Tips for Mature Travelers,
available from Grand Circle Travel (% 800-221-2610 or 617-350-7500;
www.gct.com); The 50+ Traveler’s Guidebook (St. Martin’s Press); 
and Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can’t Get Unless You’re Over 50, by Joann Rattner Heilman
(McGraw-Hill).
Many senior-targeted tours of Scotland are of the tour-bus variety, with
free trips thrown in for those who organize groups of 20 or more. If
you’re seeking more independent travel, you should probably consult a
regular travel agent to make your travel plans (see Chapter 6).

Accessing Scotland: Advice for 
Travelers with Disabilities
Most disabilities shouldn’t stop anyone from traveling. Scotland’s cities
are reasonably well equipped to accommodate those with disabilities.
However, not everything in Scotland will be easy. Many train stations are
decidedly inaccessible, and historical attractions, such as castles, by
their very nature, with cobblestone stairs, are difficult for even some
able-bodied visitors to navigate. Some B&Bs and small hotels with lots of
stairs and no elevators aren’t suitable, either. In the last few years,
Scotland has toughened its rules on access for those with disabilities, so
matters are improving.
Call ahead to attractions and B&Bs to check their facilities, but you can
feel fairly confident that newer restaurants and modern hotels will be
entirely accessible.
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
102

The “Information for Visitors with Disabilities” guide, published by the
National Trust of Scotland, is available at most tourist offices. It lists
attractions in Scotland and details the accessibility of each portion of
the attraction (for example, the castle may be accessible but the gardens
and toilets may not be). The publication even details access points and
views that are accessible from a wheelchair.
Travel agencies and organizations
Many travel agencies offer customized tours and itineraries for travelers
with disabilities.
 Access-Able Travel Source (% 303-232-2979; www.access-able.
com) offers extensive information on accessibility and advice for
traveling around the world with disabilities.
 Accessible Journeys (% 800-846-4537 or 610-521-0339; www.

mature travelers, slow walkers, wheelchair travelers, and their fam-
ilies and friends.
 Flying Wheels Travel (% 507-451-5005; www.flyingwheels
travel.com) offers escorted tours and cruises that emphasize
sports and private tours in minivans with lifts.
Organizations that offer assistance to travelers with disabilities include

Following the Rainbow: Advice 
for Gay and Lesbian Travelers
Although not considered the most liberally minded country in Europe,
Scotland is safe for gay and lesbian travelers. Glasgow and Edinburgh are
progressive cities that are home to substantial (though perhaps subdued,
depending on what you’re used to) gay populations. Smaller towns and
villages may be less tolerant, and open displays of affection may be
frowned upon. Hotels should not discriminate against same-sex couples.
For more information and support, contact the Gay and Lesbian
Switchboard (% 0141-847-0447) in Glasgow, which also operates the
LGBT Centre (% 0141-221-7203). The line offers health advice, work-
shops, and cultural events in the community. On the Web, visit
www.eusa.ed.ac.uk/societies/blogs, which is run by Edinburgh
University’s Bisexual, Lesbian, Gay, or Transgendered Society.
The International Gay and Lesbian Travel Association (IGLTA;

directory of gay- and lesbian-friendly travel businesses; on the organiza-
tion’s Web site, click “Members” for a detailed list.
Many agencies offer tours and travel itineraries developed specifically
for gay and lesbian travelers.
 Above and Beyond Tours (% 800-397-2681; www.abovebeyond

Uncovering Your Scottish Roots
If you have a surname beginning with Mac (which simply means “son
of”) or one of the common lowland Scottish monikers from Burns to
Armstrong, you’re probably a descendant of Scotland and may have ties
to a clan — a group of kinsmen with common ancestry.
Clans and clan societies maintain their own museums throughout
Scotland, and local tourist offices can give you details about where to
locate them. Bookstores here also sell clan histories and maps.
Genealogical records are kept at the General Register Office for
Scotland, New Register House, 3 W. Register St., Edinburgh (% 0131-
334-0380; www.gro-scotland.gov.uk), where you can search for a fee.
The system is strictly self-service, and the office gets very crowded in
summer.
The official government source for genealogical data has also been
added to the Web. Log on to www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk. A basic
search through the computerized archive costs £6 ($11). The Web site’s
census data go back more than 100 years.

efore heading off to Scotland, you need to take care of some impor-

help you get all your ducks in a row.
Getting a Passport
New regulations issued by the Department of Homeland Security now
require virtually every air traveler entering the U.S. to show a passport. As
of January 23, 2007, all persons, including U.S. citizens, traveling by air
between the United States and Canada, Mexico, Central and South
America, the Caribbean, and Bermuda are required to present a valid pass-
port. As of January 31, 2008, U.S. and Canadian citizens entering the U.S. at
land and sea ports of entry from within the Western Hemisphere will need
to present government-issued proof of citizenship, such as a birth certifi-
cate, along with a government issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license. A
passport is not required for U.S. or Canadian citizens entering by land or
sea, but it is highly encouraged that travelers carry one.
Applying for a U.S. passport
The Web sites listed provide downloadable passport applications as well
as the current fees for processing applications. For an up-to-date, country-
by-country listing of passport requirements around the world, go to the
“International Travel” tab of the U.S. State Department at http://travel.
state.gov. Note: Children are required to present a passport when enter-
ing the United States at airports. More information on obtaining a passport
for a minor can be found at the State Department Web site.

Allow plenty of time before your trip to apply for a passport; processing
normally takes four to six weeks (three weeks for expedited service), but
can take longer during busy periods (especially spring). And keep in mind
that if you need a passport in a hurry, you pay a higher processing fee.
Applying for other passports
The following list offers more information for citizens of Australia,
Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand.
 Australians can pick up an application from your local post office
or any branch of Passports Australia, but you must schedule an
interview at the passport office to present your application 
materials. Call the Australian Passport Information Service at 
% 131-232, or visit the government Web site at www.passports.
gov.au.
 Canadians can pick up applications at travel agencies throughout
Canada or from the central Passport Office, Department of Foreign
Affairs and International Trade, Ottawa, ON K1A 0G3 (% 800-
567-6868; www.ppt.gc.ca). Note: Canadian children who travel
must have their own passport. However, if you hold a valid
Canadian passport issued before December 11, 2001, that bears the
name of your child, the passport remains valid for you and your
child until it expires.
 Residents of Ireland can apply for a ten-year passport at the
Passport Office, Setanta Centre, Molesworth Street, Dublin 2 
(% 01-671-1633; www.irlgov.ie/iveagh). Those under age 18 or
over 65 must apply for a three-year passport. You can also apply at
1A South Mall, Cork (% 21-494-4700) or at most main post offices.
 New Zealanders can pick up a passport application at any 
New Zealand Passports Office or download it from their Web site
(% 0800-225-050 in New Zealand, or 04-474-8100; www.passports.

Playing It Safe with Travel 
and Medical Insurance
Three kinds of travel insurance are available to you: trip-cancellation
insurance, medical insurance, and lost-luggage insurance. The cost of
travel insurance varies widely depending on the cost and length of your
trip, your age and health, and the type of trip you’re taking, but expect
to pay between 5 percent and 8 percent of the cost of the vacation itself.
Trip-cancellation insurance
Trip-cancellation insurance will help retrieve your money if you have to
back out of a trip or depart early, or if your travel supplier goes bank-
rupt. Trip cancellation traditionally covers such events as sickness, 
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 107

natural disasters, and State Department advisories. The latest news in
trip-cancellation insurance is the availability of expanded hurricane
coverage and the “any-reason” cancellation coverage — which costs
more but covers cancellations made for any reason. You won’t get back
100 percent of your prepaid trip cost, but you’ll be refunded a substan-
tial portion. TravelSafe (% 888-885-7233; www.travelsafe.com) offers
both types of coverage. Expedia also offers any-reason cancellation cov-
erage for its air-hotel packages.
Other recommended insurers include AccessAmerica (% 866-807-3982;
www.accessamerica.com), Travel Guard (% 800-826-4919; www.
travelguard.com), Travel Insured International (% 800-243-3174;
www.travelinsured.com); and Travelex Insurance Services (% 888-
457-4602; www.travelex-insurance.com).
You can get estimates from various providers through the Web site
www.InsureMyTrip.com. Enter your trip cost and dates, your age, and
other information, for prices from more than a dozen companies.
Medical insurance
For travel overseas, you may want to look into medical insurance. Most
U.S. health plans (including Medicare and Medicaid) do not provide cov-
erage, and the ones that do often require you to pay for services up
front and reimburse you only after you return home.
If you require additional medical insurance, try MEDEX Assistance
(% 410-453-6300; www.medexassist.com) or Travel Assistance
International (% 800-821-2828; www.travelassistance.com; for gen-
eral information on services, call the company’s Worldwide Assistance
Services, Inc., at % 800-777-8710).
Canadians should check with their provincial health plan offices or call
Health Canada (% 866-225-0709; www.hc-sc.gc.ca) to find out the
extent of their coverage and what documentation and receipts they
must take home in case they are treated overseas.
Lost luggage insurance
On international flights (including U.S. portions of international trips),
baggage coverage is limited to approximately $9.07 per pound, up to
approximately $635 per checked bag. If you plan to check items more
valuable than what’s covered by the standard liability, see if your 
homeowner’s policy covers your valuables, get baggage insurance as
part of your comprehensive travel-insurance package, or buy Travel
Guard’s “BagTrak” product. I would not suggest buying insurance at 
the airport — it’s usually overpriced.
Be sure to take any valuables or irreplaceable items with you in your
carry-on luggage, because many valuables (including books, money, and
electronics) aren’t covered by airline policies.

If your luggage is lost, immediately file a lost-luggage claim at the air-
port, detailing the luggage contents. For most airlines, you must report
delayed, damaged, or lost baggage within four hours of arrival. Airlines
are required to deliver found luggage directly to your house or destina-
tion free of charge.
Staying Healthy When You Travel
You don’t need any special vaccinations or shots to travel in Scotland.
The threat of bird flu will continue to be debated, but any risks to you
from either live poultry or wild bird populations will be miniscule.
If you have a serious and/or chronic illness, talk to your doctor before
leaving on a trip. For conditions such as epilepsy, diabetes, or heart
problems, wear a MedicAlert identification tag (% 888-633-4298;
www.medicalert.org), which immediately alerts doctors to your condi-
tion and gives them access to your records through MedicAlert’s 24-
hour hotline. Contact the International Association for Medical
Assistance to Travelers (IAMAT; % 716-754-4883, or 416-652-0137 in
Canada; www.iamat.org) for tips on travel and health concerns in
Scotland and lists of local doctors. Also, the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (% 800-311-3435; www.cdc.gov) pro-
vides up-to-date information on health hazards by region or country and
offers tips on food safety. The Web site www.tripprep.com, sponsored
by a consortium of travel-medicine practitioners, may also offer helpful
advice on traveling abroad. You can find listings of reliable clinics over-
seas at the International Society of Travel Medicine (www.istm.org).
In Scotland, health care is nationalized and free. Hospital emergency
rooms will treat anyone, regardless of whether they’re local residents or
tourists.

Avoiding “economy-class syndrome”
Deep vein thrombosis, or as it’s know in the world of flying, “economy-class syndrome,”
is a blood clot that develops in a deep vein. It’s a potentially deadly condition that can
be caused by sitting in cramped conditions, such as an airplane cabin, for too long.
During a flight (especially a long-haul flight), get up, walk around, and stretch your legs
every 60 to 90 minutes to keep your blood flowing. Other preventative measures include
frequent flexing of the legs while sitting, drinking lots of water, and avoiding alcohol and
sleeping pills. If you have a history of deep vein thrombosis, heart disease, or other con-
dition that puts you at high risk, some experts recommend wearing compression stock-
ings or taking anticoagulants when you fly; always ask your physician about the best
course for you. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis include leg pain or swelling, or even
shortness of breath.

Staying Connected by Cellphone or E-mail
Staying in touch while traveling is easier than ever, thanks to cellphones
and the Internet. Of course, if what you’re interested in is an escape, you
may want to skip the section below. Otherwise, read on.
Using a cellphone outside the U.S.
First of all, they’re called “mobiles” (moe-biles) in Scotland. The three
letters that define much of the world’s wireless capabilities are GSM
(Global System for Mobiles), a big, seamless network that makes for
easy cross-border cellphone use throughout Europe and dozens of other
countries worldwide. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T Wireless, and Cingular
use this quasi-universal system; in Canada, Microcell, and some Rogers
customers are GSM, and all Europeans and most Australians use GSM.
If your cellphone is on a GSM system and you have a world-capable
multiband phone such as many Sony Ericsson, Motorola, or Samsung
models, you can make and receive calls across much of the globe, from
Andorra to Uganda. Just call your wireless operator and ask for interna-
tional roaming to be activated on your account. Unfortunately, per-
minute charges on the network can be high.
If you have an unlocked phone — one that allows you to install remov-
able computer memory phone chips (called SIM cards) — you can
switch over to a cheap, prepaid SIM card (found at a local retailer) in
Scotland. (Show your phone to the salesperson when you go to buy a
SIM card; not all phones work on all networks.) With the new card, you
get a local phone number and much, much lower calling rates. If your
phone is locked, you may be able to have it unlocked. Just call your cel-
lular operator and say you’ll be going abroad and want to use the phone
with a local provider.
If you don’t have a cellphone, or if your phone is locked, then renting a
phone is another possibility. Although you can rent a phone from any
number of overseas sites, including kiosks at airports and at car-rental
agencies, I suggest renting the phone before you leave home. That way
you can give loved ones and business associates your new number,
make sure the phone works, and take the phone wherever you go.
Getting the phone before you leave is especially helpful if you’re plan-
ning to visit Scotland and then go overseas through several other coun-
tries, where local phone-rental agencies often bill in local currency and
may not let you take the phone to another country.
Phone rental isn’t cheap. You usually pay $40 to $50 per week, plus 
airtime fees of at least $1 per minute. If you’re traveling to the U.K. or
Europe, though, local rental companies often offer free incoming calls
within their home country, which can save you big bucks. Shop around.

Two good wireless rental companies in the States are InTouch Global
(% 800-872-7626; www.intouchglobal.com) and RoadPost (% 888-
290-1606 or 905-272-5665; www.roadpost.com). Give the company your
itinerary, and someone will tell you what wireless products you need.
For no charge, InTouch also advises you on whether your existing phone
will work overseas; simply call % 703-222-7161 between 9 a.m. and 4
p.m. EST, or go to www.intouchglobal.com/travel.htm.
In the U.K., you can rent (or “hire”) phones from
 Adam Phones (% 0800-123-000 within the U.K., 44-20-8742-0101
outside the U.K., or % 1-866-GSM-HIRE within the U.S.; www.
adamphones.com)
 Cellhire UK (% 0800-610-610 within the U.K., 44-1904-610-610 
outside the U.K., or 1-866-246-6546 within the U.S.; www.cellhire.
co.uk)
Accessing the Internet
Travelers have any number of ways to check e-mail and access the
Internet on the road. Of course, using your own laptop — or even a PDA
(personal digital assistant) or electronic organizer with a modem — pro-
vides the most flexibility. But even if you don’t have a computer, you can
access e-mail and even your office computer from cybercafes.
It’s hard nowadays to find a city that doesn’t have a few cybercafes.
Although no definitive directory for cybercafes exists — these are inde-
pendent businesses, after all — two places to start looking are at
www.cybercaptive.com and www.cybercafe.com. In Scotland, cyber-
cafes pop up near universities more than anywhere else.
Aside from cybercafes, most youth hostels and an increasing number of
hotels and B&Bs have at least one computer you can use to access the
Internet. Many public libraries in Scotland offer Internet access free or
for a small charge. Most major airports have Internet kiosks scattered
throughout their terminals, too. These give you Web access for a per-
minute fee that’s usually higher than cybercafe prices. Avoid hotel busi-
ness centers unless you’re willing to pay exorbitant rates.
If you need to access files on your office computer while you’re away,
look into a service called GoToMyPC (www.gotomypc.com). The service
provides a Web-based interface for you to access and manipulate a dis-
tant PC from anywhere — even from a cybercafe — provided your
“target” PC is on and has an always-on connection to the Internet.
Using your own computer
If you’re bringing your own computer with you, more and more hotels,
cafes, and retailers are signing on as Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) “hotspots.”
Mac owners have their own networking technology: Apple AirPort.
Chapter 10: Taking Care of the Remaining Details 111

Boingo (www.boingo.com) and Wayport (www.wayport.com) have set
up networks in airports and high-class hotel lobbies. Users of iPass have
access to a few hundred wireless hotel lobby setups. To locate other
hotspots that provide free wireless networks in cities around the world,
go to www.personaltelco.net/index.cgi/WirelessCommunities.
For dial-up access, most business-class hotels throughout the world
offer dataports for laptop modems. In addition, major Internet Service
Providers (ISPs) have local access numbers around the world, allowing
you to go online by placing a local call. The iPass network also has 
dial-up numbers around the world. You have to sign up with an iPass
provider, who will then tell you how to set up your computer for your
destination(s). For a list of iPass providers, go to www.ipass.com, and
click on “Individuals Buy Now.” One solid provider is i2roam (% 866-
811-6209 or 920-235-0475; www.i2roam.com).
Scotland Unplugged: Getting 
Your Electric Stuff to Work
The plugs in Scotland are different than in the U.S. and Canada. You can
buy a cheap adapter, but it won’t address the problem of different volt-
ages. In the U.S. and Canada, the current is 120 volts. In Scotland, it’s offi-
cially 230 volts, although 240 volts are common. If you plug in your hair
dryer, even with an adapter, you’re likely to blow a fuse or burn out the
appliance. You can buy a voltage transformer (check out www.walk
abouttravelgear.com), but they can be expensive and not worth the
cost if you’re planning a short stay.
Some travel appliances, such as shavers and irons, have a nice feature
called dual voltage that adapts to the change, but unless your appliance
gives a voltage range (such as 110v–220v), don’t chance it. Bring a 
battery-operated alarm clock (for when you can’t get a wake-up call) and
shaver (if you’re averse to disposables) as well as a battery-powered
personal stereo (if you can’t bear to be without your tunes). And don’t
forget extra batteries.
Keeping Up with Airline Security Measures
With the federalization of airport security, security procedures at U.S.
airports are more stable and consistent than ever. Generally, you’ll be
fine if you arrive at the airport one hour before a domestic flight and
two hours before an international flight; if you show up late, tell an air-
line employee and she’ll probably whisk you to the front of the line.
Keep your passport (or other government-issued photo ID) at the ready
to show at check-in, the security checkpoint, and sometimes even the
gate. (Children under 18 do not need government-issued photo IDs for
domestic flights, but they do for international flights to most countries.)
Part II: Planning Your Trip to Scotland 
112

In 2003, the TSA phased out gate check-in at all U.S. airports. And e-tickets
have made paper tickets nearly obsolete. Passengers with e-tickets can
beat the ticket-counter lines by using airport electronic kiosks or even
online check-in from their home computer. Online check-in involves log-
ging on to your airline’s Web site, accessing your reservation, and print-
ing out your boarding pass — and the airline may even offer you bonus
miles to do so! If you’re using a kiosk at the airport, bring the credit card
you used to book the ticket or your frequent-flier card. Print out your
boarding pass from the kiosk and simply proceed to the security check-
point with your pass and a photo ID. Curbside check-in is also a good
way to avoid lines, although a few airlines still ban curbside check-in;
call before you go.
Speed up security by not wearing metal objects such as big belt buck-
les. If you’ve got metallic body parts, a note from your doctor can pre-
vent a long chat with the security screeners. Keep in mind that only
ticketed passengers are allowed past security, except for folks escorting
passengers with disabilities or children.
Federalization has stabilized what you can carry on and what you
can’t. Travelers in the U.S. are allowed one carry-on bag, plus a 
“personal item” such as a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag. Carry-on
hoarders can stuff all sorts of things into a laptop bag; as long as it has 
a laptop in it, it’s still considered a personal item. The Transportation
Security Administration (TSA) has issued a list of restricted items; check
its Web site (www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/prohibited/
permitted-prohibited-items.shtm) for details.
Airport screeners may decide that your checked luggage needs to be
searched by hand. You can now purchase luggage locks that allow screen-
ers to open and relock a checked bag if hand-searching is necessary. 
Look for Travel Sentry–certified locks at luggage or travel shops and
Brookstone stores (you can buy them online at www.brookstone.com).
For more information on the locks, visit www.travelsentry.org.

Part III
Edinburgh and
Glasgow

In this part . . . 
You ﬁnd out about the charms and attractions of Scotland’s
two major cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow, and there is 
also information about some of the sights that are within easy
striking distance of each or both of the cities. Though notice-
ably different from one another, each city is worth a visit, and
you’ll ﬁnd plenty of suggestions here of what to do and see.
Edinburgh, Scotland’s capital, is most famous for its castle and
picturesque setting, while Glasgow, once among the greatest
shipbuilding centers of the world, is a more modern and
bustling big city (though not too big).
The chapters in Part III offer everything from advice on get-
ting there to getting around — as well as hints on how to dis-
cover the best places to stay and dine. You also get the
lowdown on the cities’ ﬁnest sights and attractions, insider
tips on quintessential Scottish pubs and cafes, and a walking
tour in each city.

E
dinburgh has been called one of Europe’s fairest cities and the
“Athens of the North.” And what many experienced travelers to the
U.K. say is true: If you can visit only two cities in all of Great Britain, it
should be London first and Edinburgh second. Built on extinct volcanoes
near an inlet from the North Sea (the Firth of Forth) and enveloped by
rolling hills, lakes, and forests, the Scottish capital began as a small, for-
tified settlement on a craggy hill. Indeed, because of its defensive attrib-
utes, Edinburgh (remember “burgh” is always pronounced burra in
Scotland) became an important, protected place for the country’s rulers.
Somewhat ironically, the city today represents the virtual crossroads of
Scotland for many visitors: the spot that they are most likely to stop in
or pass through while in Scotland.
Edinburgh is filled with historic, intellectual, and literary associations.
Names such as Mary Queen of Scots and her nemesis, the Protestant
reformer John Knox; pioneer economist Adam Smith and philosopher
David Hume; authors Sir Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle; as well as inventor Alexander Graham Bell: They
are all part of Edinburgh’s past.
Today the city is famous for its annual world-class cultural event, the
Edinburgh Festival. It is actually several festivals at once: books,
comedy, drama, classical music, dance, and more. But this ancient seat
of Scottish royalty has year-round attractions. When the festival-goers
have returned home, the city’s pace is more relaxed, its accommoda-
tions prices are lower, and the inhabitants — though not celebrated 
for their bonhomie — are under less pressure and offer a hospitable 
welcome.
Edinburgh is a city that lends itself to walking. Its Old Town and New
Town are full of moody cobbled alleys, elegant streetscapes, handsome

squares, and placid parks. From several hilltops, panoramic views can
be enjoyed.
In addition to being Scotland’s political center, Edinburgh has also been
its cultural capital, even if that particular crown — especially in terms of
the contemporary arts — has perhaps been lost to Glasgow (see Chapter
12) over the last few decades. Nevertheless, the Scottish capital is still
lively. It is home to the country’s several national galleries. And its loca-
tion provides the perfect point for excursions. Notable nearby attractions
include Linlithgow, where Mary Queen of Scots was born, and attractive
seaside villages, such as North Berwick, east of Edinburgh. (Turn to
Chapter 13 for more information on day-trip options.) Any visitor to
Scotland should try to give Edinburgh at least two days — and, if you
have the time, you won’t regret staying longer.
Getting to Edinburgh
Although there are a few direct flights to Edinburgh from North America, a
stopover in London’s Heathrow airport (or some other European hub) is
probably more common. If you’re coming north from London, your
options include taking the train. If you’re coming from elsewhere in
Scotland, major bus and railway routes serve Edinburgh. Having a car
within the city of Edinburgh isn’t necessary (nor even preferable), but the
city is easily reached via freeways and highways, if you choose to drive.
By air
Edinburgh is only about an hour’s flying time from London, which is
633km (393 miles) south. Edinburgh International Airport (% 0131-
333-1000) is about 10km (6 miles) west of the city’s center, and has
become a growing hub for flights both within the British Isles and to 
and from Continental Europe.
Remember, however, that Glasgow International Airport is only about
90km (55 miles) away and shouldn’t be discounted if you’re coming to
Edinburgh, because it traditionally greets more long-haul flights, espe-
cially from North America. For information on arriving in Glasgow by air,
see Chapter 12.
Orienting yourself
Edinburgh’s airport terminal is compact, so there’s little possibility of
getting lost. Immigration control and customs agents are vigilant, but the
security scene is quite a bit more relaxed than at a giant air terminal
such as London’s Heathrow. Usually you find just one line (or queue, in
local parlance) at passport checks for visitors arriving from outside 
the European Union. Before heading into town, you may want to stop 
at the airport’s VisitScotland information and accommodations desk 
(% 0131-473-3600; www.visitscotland.org), which is generally open
Monday through Saturday from 6:15 a.m. to 7:45 p.m. and Sunday from 9
a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
118

Getting into town
From Edinburgh airport, the Airlink bus makes the trip to the city center
about every ten minutes during peak times, terminating at Waverley
Bridge near the central railway station. The fare is £3 ($5.55) one-way or
£5 ($9.25) round-trip. The trip from the airport into town takes about 25
minutes (sometimes longer during rush hour). Overnight service is pro-
vided by the Night Bus: N22. Visit www.flybybus.com for details of
Airlink bus service.
A taxi into the city costs at least £12 ($22) or more, depending on traffic,
and the ride takes about the same amount of time as the bus. Look for
the taxi stand when exiting the airport.
By train
The trains that link London to Edinburgh (via Newcastle) on the so-
called East Coast Main Line are reasonably fast, efficient, and generally
relaxing, with a restaurant and bar service as well as air-conditioning.
Trains depart every hour or so from London’s King’s Cross Station and
arrive in Edinburgh at Waverley Station in the heart of the city (contact
National Railway Enquiries, at % 0845-748-4950, for rail info; www.
nationalrail.co.uk). The trip generally takes 41⁄2 hours.
Off-peak fares bought in advance can range widely, from around £25 to
£100 ($46–$185), and the government is examining whether they should
be less variable. Off-peak first-class tickets purchased in advance also
range widely, from about £30 to £120 ($56–$222), although the cheapest
fares seem to be rarely available. A fully flexible “buy anytime, travel
anytime” standard open single fare is upwards of £150 ($277). The
Caledonian Sleeper service for overnight travel can cost about £100
($185), but online bargains booked well in advance can mean the trip
may cost as little at £19 ($35). Taxi and bus connections are easily made
at Waverley Station, which also serves Glasgow with a shuttle service
every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evening
until about 11:30 p.m.
By bus
National Express (% 0870-580-8080; www.nationalexpress.com) runs
buses daily (typically 9:30 a.m., noon, and 11 p.m. for direct service)
from London’s Victoria Coach Station to Edinburgh. Standard round-trip
fare is about £45 ($85). Without stopovers, the trip should take less than
10 hours. Edinburgh’s bus station is near St. Andrew Square (% 0870-
550-5050 for information).
By car
Edinburgh is 74km (46 miles) east of Glasgow and 169km (105 miles)
north of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in England. No express motorway links
London directly to Edinburgh. The M1 from London takes you most of
the way north, but you have to come into Edinburgh via secondary
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 119

roads — either the coastal A1 or inland A68. Alternatively, you can travel
the well-used motorways in the west of the U.K. From London, take the
M1 to the M6 (near Coventry), which links to the M74 at Carlisle. Then
travel to the M8 southeast of Glasgow, which takes you Edinburgh’s ring
road or beltway. Allow 8 hours or more for the drive north from London.
Orienting Yourself in Edinburgh
Central Edinburgh is divided into two distinct historic districts: the Old
Town and the larger New Town (note that the locals generally drop the
definite article “the” when referring to these two districts; henceforth so
shall I). Old Town is where the city began: Once called “Auld Reekie”
because of its smoky atmosphere, it is today chock-a-block with tourist
attractions and shops, its sidewalks often full of out-of-town visitors
from Easter until autumn. New Town is a product of a golden age of
enlightenment in Edinburgh, displaying mid–to-late-18th-century mod-
ernism in town planning.
The Royal Mile is the main thoroughfare in Old Town, running from
Edinburgh Castle in the west to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in the east.
Both British royalty and Scotland’s Parliament (revived in 1999) are
based in Old Town, as are municipal government and the country’s legal
elite. Another infamous area, at the southern base of the castle, is
Grassmarket, both a street and a district, where convicted criminals
were once hanged on the gallows. Today Grassmarket is home to restau-
rants, pubs, and hotels.
New Town is actually fairly old. North of Edinburgh’s original settle-
ment, across what is today the park called Princes Street Gardens, New
Town was first settled in the 18th century — about one decade before
the American declaration of independence was signed. By the beginning
of the 1800s, classic squares, streets, and town houses were complete,
and the original district was soon expanded with more Georgian designs.
Princes Street is the area’s primary shopping precinct, with broad side-
walks and Princes Street Gardens running its entire length — all with
panoramic views across the valley of Old Town and Edinburgh Castle.
North of, and running parallel to, Princes Street is New Town’s second
great boulevard, George Street. It begins at St. Andrew Square and runs
west to Charlotte Square. Directly north of George Street is another
impressive thoroughfare, Queen Street, which opens onto Queen Street
Gardens on its north side and features views of the Firth of Forth. You
may also hear a lot about Rose Street, between Princes Street and
George Street, and its many pubs, shops, and restaurants.
Edinburgh’s Southside and West End are primarily residential. The
Southside is home to both the well-regarded Edinburgh University
(which makes parts of the area quite lively) and a sprawling park known
as the Meadows. The West End includes the last of New Town develop-
ments, begun at the beginning of the 19th century. It has theaters, 
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
120

several small B&Bs, and swank boutique hotels as well as the city’s most
exclusive central neighborhoods.
Leith is north of the city center and is Edinburgh’s historic port where
the Water of Leith (a small river that meanders through the city) meets
the wide Firth of Forth. Leith briefly served as the Scottish capital in the
middle of the 16th century, and so strategic was its location that Oliver
Cromwell’s invading forces built a citadel there in the 17th century. Leith
remained an independent burgh until the 20th century. Fans of Irvine
Welsh (author of Trainspotting) probably know that the area has a rough-
and-tumble reputation. But today, most of its shipping and the sailors
have gone, and lots of luxury apartments are being built instead. Still,
Leith carries reminders of evocative maritime past and offers a good
selection of seafood restaurants and nautical-themed pubs. It’s also now
the home of the royal yacht Britannia.
Despite its steep hills, often linked by bridges, Edinburgh is a very 
walkable city. Many little alleys (wynds) and passageways (closes) are
accessible only by foot. So bring a pair of comfortable shoes and start
walking — you get a great feel for what the city has to offer.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Edinburgh has a host of districts, some of which appear to include only
a few streets and many that can be folded into the broader areas of Old
and New Towns.
Old Town
Old Town is where Edinburgh began. Its spine is the Royal Mile, a
medieval thoroughfare stretching for about 1.6km (1 mile) from
Edinburgh Castle downhill to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The Royal
Mile is one boulevard with four segments bearing different names:
Castlehill, Lawnmarket, High Street, and Canongate. English author
Daniel Defoe wrote of the Royal Mile: “This is perhaps the largest,
longest, and finest street for buildings and number of inhabitants in the
world.” Old Town also includes the areas of Grassmarket and Cowgate.
New Town
Lying predominantly north of Old Town, the first New Town bloomed
between 1766 and 1840 as one of the largest Georgian developments in
the world. It grew to encompass the northern half of the heart of the
city. New Town is the largest historic conservation area in Great Britain
and has at least 25,000 residents. It is made up of a network of squares,
streets, terraces, and circuses, reaching from Haymarket in the west to
Leith Walk in the east. The neighborhood also extends from Canonmills
in the north to Princes Street, its most famous artery, in the south.
Stockbridge
Today part of the New Town area, Stockbridge is a one-time village that
still feels rather like a small town because of its tight-knit community.
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 121

Northwest of the castle and straddling the Water of Leigh, it’s a good
place for visitors to the city to relax, especially in the friendly cafes,
pubs, restaurants, and shops.
Haymarket and Dalry
West of the city center by about 1.5km (1 mile), these two districts may
be off the beaten path for most visitors. Haymarket centers on the
Haymarket railway station (an alternative to Waverley for travelers to
and from Glasgow and the west or places much farther north). Just a bit
farther out of town is Murrayfield, the Scottish national rugby stadium.
Dalry is slowly opening some interesting, though largely neighborhood-
oriented, restaurants.
Tollcross and West End
Edinburgh’s theater district and Conference Center are in the area west
of the castle. The West End neighborhoods near Shandwick Place are
rather exclusive. Although the district of Tollcross appears a bit rough,
it’s rapidly changing and becoming more visitor-friendly.
Southside: Marchmont and Bruntsfield
About 1.5km (1 mile) south of High Street, Marchmont was constructed
between 1869 and 1914 to offer new housing to people who could no
longer afford to live in New Town. Its northern border is the Meadows.
Sometimes visitors go south to this neighborhood, seeking a more
affordable B&B in one of the little homes that receive guests.
Bruntsfield is west of the Meadows and is named for Bruntsfield Links (a
short-hole public golf course). Now a largely residential district, the area
was the ground on which James IV apparently gathered the Scottish
army that he marched to defeat at Flodden in 1513. You can find moder-
ately priced accommodations in this vicinity.
Calton
Encompassing Calton Hill with its Regent and Royal Terraces (streets),
this district borders the so-called Pink Triangle, Edinburgh’s version of a
gay-friendly district. Edinburgh has a lively LBGT population, which
focuses socially on an area from the top of Leith Walk to Broughton
Street. The area is not, however, a dedicated gay district, such as San
Francisco’s Castro or Christopher Street in Manhattan’s Greenwich
Village; it’s just part and parcel of lively Calton, with its bars, nightclubs,
and restaurants.
Leith Walk and the Port of Leith
Leith Walk isn’t technically a neighborhood but is instead the main
artery that connects Edinburgh’s city center to Leith. Off of it are Easter
Road (home of Hibernian football club) and the districts of Pilrig and
South Leith. A foray down Leith Walk presents you with a true cross-
section of Edinburgh.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
122

The Port of Leith lies only a few kilometers north of Princes Street and
is the city’s major harbor, opening onto the Firth of Forth. In terms of
maritime might, the port isn’t what it used to be; its glory days were
back when stevedores unloaded cargos by hand. The area is currently
experiencing urban renewal, however, and visitors come here for the
pubs and restaurants, many of which specialize in seafood.
Finding information after you arrive
Edinburgh Information Centre, atop the Princes Mall, near Waverley
Station (VisitScotland; % 0131-473-3600 or 0845-225-5121; fax: 0131-
473-3881; www.edinburgh.org; Bus: 3, 8, 22, 25, or 31), can give you
sightseeing information and also arrange lodgings. The center sells bus
tours, theater tickets, and souvenirs of Edinburgh. It also has racks and
racks of free brochures. It’s open year-round; typically the hours are
Monday through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m.
to 7 p.m., though it is open later during the Festival and closes earlier in
the winter months.
Getting Around Edinburgh
Because of its narrow lanes, wynds, and closes, you can only honestly
explore Old Town in any depth on foot. Edinburgh is fairly convenient
for the visitor who likes to walk (see the section “Taking a walking tour,”
later in this chapter), because most of the major attractions are located
along the Royal Mile, Princes Street, or one of the major streets of New
Town.
The city doesn’t have a subway or underground, although a tram system
began to be built in 2008. Initially, it will take passengers up or down
Princes Street and Leith Walk. Eventually, it will cross Leith into
Newhaven and Granton, circling back to Haymarket, with a spur running
west to the airport. None of this is expected to be operational until 2011,
and until then bus service on routes that use the streets where tram
track is being laid will be disrupted.
By bus
Because there is no underground or subway in Edinburgh, and only lim-
ited commuter-train service, the city’s rather numerous buses provide
the chief method of public transportation. There are lots of them, and
most seem to go down Princes Street as some point on their route.
Fares depend on the distance traveled, with the adult one-way (single)
minimum fare £1.10 ($2.05) covering the central Edinburgh districts. If
you plan multiple trips in one day, purchase a Dayticket that allows
unlimited travel on city buses for one day at a cost of £2.50 ($4.65)
adults. Children 5 to 15 years old are charged a flat rate of 60p ($1.10),
but kids ages 13 to 15 are expected to carry a teen card (available at the
Waverley Bridge Travelshop) as proof of age. Child Daytickets cost £2

($3.70). Bus drivers, by the way, will not make change, so carry the cor-
rect amount in coins, or expect to pay more. Children ages 4 and
younger ride free. At Travelshops, one-week RideaCard passes, which
allow unlimited travel on buses, can be purchased for £13 ($24) adults,
£11 ($20) students, and £9 ($17) children.
Also the tourist buses that terminate at Waverley Bridge offer hop-on,
hop-off service at any of their stops on the set circuit of primarily Old
and New Towns. Tickets — £10 ($19) for adults, £4 ($7.50) for children —
can be used for 24 hours (although the buses’ last journeys are made in
the early evening).
You can get advance tickets and further information in the city center at
the Waverley Bridge Travelshop, Waverley Bridge, open Monday to
Saturday 8:15 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Sunday 9:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.; or at 27
Hanover St. Travelshop, open Monday to Saturday 8:15 a.m. to 6 p.m. For
details on fares and timetables, call % 0131-555-6363, or log on to www.
lothianbuses.co.uk.
By taxi
One way to get around the city is to hail a taxi or pick one up at a taxi
stand. Meters begin at £2 ($3.70), and a typical trek across town costs
about £6 ($11). Taxi ranks (stands) are at High Street near South Bridge,
Waverley and Haymarket stations, Hanover Street, North St. Andrew
Street, and Lauriston Place. Fares are displayed on the front of the taxi,
and charges are posted, including extra fees for night drivers or destina-
tions outside the city limits. You can also call a taxi ahead of time. Try City
Cabs, at % 0131-228-1211, or Central Radio Taxis, at % 0131-229-2468.
By car
Unless you absolutely can’t avoid it, I would strongly advise that you
simply don’t drive in Edinburgh — it’s a tricky and frustrating business,
even for natives. Speed bumps, one-way streets, dedicated bus lanes,
and tram construction are all good reasons to forego the private auto-
mobile. Parking is expensive and also can be difficult to find. Metered
parking is available, but you need the right change and have to watch
out for traffic wardens who issue tickets. Some zones are marked PERMIT
HOLDERS ONLY — and they mean it. Your vehicle will likely be towed if you
don’t have a permit. A double yellow line along the curb indicates no
parking at any time. A single yellow line along the curb may allow you to
park; check for posted restrictions, or you may incur a ticket there as
well. Major parking lots (car parks) are at Castle Terrace (near
Edinburgh Castle), Waverley Station, and St. James Centre (close to the
east end of Princes Street).
You may want a rental car for touring the countryside or heading
onward. Many agencies grant discounts to those who reserve cars in
advance (see Chapter 7 for more information). Most rental agencies will
accept your foreign driver’s license, provided you’ve held it for more
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
126

than a year and are older than 21. Most of the major car-rental compa-
nies maintain offices at the Edinburgh airport, in case you want to rent a
car on the spot. In the city, try Avis on West Park Place (% 0870-153-
9103), Hertz on Picardy Place (% 0870-864-0013), or Thrifty on Hay-
market Terrace (% 0131-337-1319).
By bicycle
Bicycles are a more common mode of transportation in Edinburgh than
in Glasgow. Nevertheless, biking is probably a good idea only for visitors
in good shape, given that the city is set on a series of ridges and the
streets are often cobbled. If you’re determined to bike your way through
Edinburgh, try Rent-a-Bike Edinburgh, 29 Blackfriars St., near High
Street (% 0131-556-5560; www.cyclescotland.co.uk; Bus: 35).
Depending on the type of bike you rent, charges average around £15
($28) per day or £70 ($130) for the week, but partial-day rentals are also
possible. A credit card imprint will be taken as security. The same com-
pany that operates Rent-a-Bike Edinburgh also runs Scottish Cycle
Safaris, which organizes tours in the city and across Scotland. They can
equip you for excursions; and because they have branches in places
such as Oban, Inverness, and Skye, you can drop off your bike and
equipment there at the end of your trip, if it’s more convenient.
On foot
Walking Edinburgh is definitely the best way to see the city center and
most of the town. (But I also recommend using buses or taxis, if the dis-
tances seem too great.)
Staying in Style
Edinburgh offers many options for accommodations, from the super-
posh and fabulously pricey five-star hotels to down-and-dirty
bunkhouses and youth hostels. It is a city that anticipates bundles of
tourists and travelers, whether seasonal backpackers, school groups,
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 127
Famous Edinburghers
Famous Edinburgh residents include Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, who has become
one of the best-selling writers in history and wrote her first book in one of the city’s
coffee shops. David Hume lived at James Court in Old Town in the 18th century. James
Boswell, Robert Louis Stevenson, Sir Walter Scott, and Flora MacDonald also made
their homes here. One of the city’s most famous former residents, Sean Connery, grew
up in the Fenton Bridge tenements, and Queen Elizabeth knighted him in 2000 at the
Palace of Holyroodhouse. The actor, most widely known for his many James Bond films,
had previously dismissed the idea of knighthood as long as Scotland was denied inde-
pendent rule. (See Chapter 2 for more on the political history of Scotland.)

and families or professional types in the Scottish capital for commercial
and governmental matters.
Be warned, however, that during the month-long period of the Edinburgh
Festival every August, the hotels, guesthouses, and B&Bs fill up. If you’re
planning a visit at that time, be sure to reserve your accommodations as
far in advance as possible. Otherwise you may end up in a town or village
as many as 40km (55 miles) from the city center. And don’t be surprised if
the standard rates for accommodations in Edinburgh are higher — in
some cases twice as high — during August, particularly at smaller hotels.
The Edinburgh Information Centre is near Waverley Station, atop the
Princes Mall shopping center, at 3 Princes St. (% 0131-473-3800,
0845-225-5121, or 44-1506-832-121 from overseas; fax: 0131-473-3881;
www.edinburgh.org; Bus: 3, 8, 22, 25, or 31).
The Information Centre, in conjunction with the Scottish tourist board,
compiles a lengthy list of small hotels, guesthouses, and private homes
providing B&B-type lodging for as little as £25 ($46) per person. A £3
($5.55) booking fee is charged and a 10 percent deposit is expected if you
book through the center. For the best availability, make your reservation
about four weeks in advance, especially during summer. The center is
open year-round; typically the hours are Monday through Saturday from
9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m., although it’s open
later during the Festival and closes earlier in the winter months.
The Scottish tourist board also provides ratings of accommodations,
which are based largely on amenities. Due to the ratings system, the stars
can be limited for smaller operations that may not offer all the modern
conveniences but are still perfectly good places to stay. References to
stars in the information below are those bestowed by VisitScotland, and I
have more to say about what they mean in Chapter 8.
The Internet can be a treasure trove of discounted rates, if you have the
time and inclination to dig around a bit. In some cases, bargains are only
available when you use Web-based booking services. Some of these spe-
cial prices and promotions are noted below. See Chapter 8 for more
details on booking your hotel.
If you have an early flight out and need a hotel that’s convenient to the
airport, consider the 244-unit Edinburgh Marriott, 111 Glasgow Rd. 
(% 0131-334-9191), off A8 on Edinburgh’s western outskirts. It offers
doubles from about £150 ($278), including breakfast. Facilities include an
indoor pool, gym, sauna, and restaurant.
The top hotels
Here’s a list of my recommended places to stay in Edinburgh. Rack rates
are the standard full prices that a hotel charges for a room. You may not
have to pay the full amount of the published rates, however, except in
high season, and even then there may be reductions. Unless otherwise
indicated, the rates I give include breakfast.

Balmoral Hotel
$$$$
New Town
Almost directly above Waverley Rail Station, the Balmoral’s soaring clock
tower is a city landmark, famously set five minutes fast for the benefit of
those on the way to the train. The best accommodations — such as room
520, the Dee Suite — are sumptuously furnished, with an ample sitting
room and a huge, well-appointed bathroom, not to mention fabulous views
towards the castle. Dining options at the Balmoral include the elegant and
Michelin-star-earning Number One (p. 147). Kilted doormen supply the
Scottish atmosphere from the start, and afternoon tea is served in the
high-ceilinged Palm Court.

The Bonham
$$$$
New Town
One of Edinburgh’s most stylish hotels, the Bonham is actually three West
End town houses now linked internally. Perhaps the jewel in the crown of
the Townhouse group of hotels in Edinburgh (which also includes the

the Bonham’s rooms each have an individual theme and plush upholster-

Caledonian Hilton Edinburgh
$$$$
New Town
This hotel remains one of the city’s landmarks and offers commanding
views toward the nearby Edinburgh Castle and over Princes Street
Gardens. The public rooms are reminiscent of Edwardian splendor, and
the guest rooms (some exceptionally spacious and others quite small) are
rather conservatively styled with reproduction furniture. Bathrooms come
with tub/shower combinations. Fine-dining meals are served in the
Pompadour Restaurant. A traditional tea is featured in the high-ceilinged
lounge. On the Internet, advance booking means savings.

Channings
$$$
Near New Town
Five Edwardian terrace houses were combined to create this hotel, located
in a tranquil residential area near Stockbridge. Channings maintains the
atmosphere of a Scottish country house, with oak paneling, ornate fire-
places, molded ceilings, and antiques. The guest rooms are outfitted in a
modern style; the front units get the views, but the rear ones offer more
seclusion. Even if you’re not a guest, consider a meal here; Channings
Restaurant offers fine fare.

The Edinburgh Residence
$$$$
West End
Part of the Townhouse group (which includes the Bonham, Howard, and
Channings), this is one of the finest luxury hotels in Scotland, a series of
elegant suites installed in a trio of architecturally beautiful and sensitively
restored Georgian buildings in the West End. As you enter, grand staircases
and classic wood paneling greet you, but the units have all the modern
conveniences that befit five-star accommodations. The rooms are the ulti-
mate in comfort, with a trio of suites having their own private entrances.
All units are spacious. If you are traveling off season, it is worth checking
the Web site promotions that offer savings.

The Howard
$$$$
New Town
Dubbed one of the most exclusive five-star hotels in the city, this lovely
hotel is made up of a set of linked Georgian terraced houses in the north-
ern New Town, just down the hill from the Queen Street Gardens. Some of
the aura of a private home remains. Accommodations are midsize to spa-
cious; units are individually and rather elegantly decorated, with some of
the best bathrooms in town — featuring power and double showers and,
in some, Jacuzzis. The décor is traditional and modern, incorporating both
antiques and reproductions. Service is a hallmark of the Howard, with a
dedicated butler who tends to your individual needs — even unpacking
your luggage, should you so desire.

Malmaison
$$$
Leith
This is Leith’s stylish boutique hotel, located in the old harbor district,
only a few steps from the Water of Leith. Malmaison was converted from
an 1883 seamen’s mission/dorm and is capped by a stately stone clock
tower. Overall, it’s a hip, unpretentious place with a minimalist décor.
Rooms are average in size but well equipped. The leisure facilities are lim-
ited to an exercise room, but you find the brasserie and wine bar favored
by locals. Even during summertime, at least before the Festival begins,
Malmaison’s online reservations offer good discounts.

Prestonfield
$$$$
Southside
Prestonfield, rising in Jacobean splendor amid 5.3 hectares (13 acres) of
gardens, pastures, and woodlands below Arthur’s Seat, underwent a £3-mil-
lion ($5.5-million) refurbishment in 2003 and is now in the hands of James
Thomson, who owns The Witchery by the Castle (see listing later in this
section). The pile was built in the 17th century, serving first as the home of
the city’s Lord Provost (ceremonial mayor), and has entertained a varied
group of luminaries over the years, from David Hume and Benjamin Franklin
to pop stars and actors such as Sean Connery and Minnie Driver. Guests
appreciate the traditional atmosphere and 1680s architecture as well as the
peacocks and Highland cattle that strut and stroll across the grounds. The
spacious bedrooms (bestowed five-stars by the tourist board) hide all mod
conveniences (such as Bose sound systems, DVD players, and flat-screen
TVs) behind velvet-lined walls. The restaurant, Rhubarb, is as theatrical as
they come, with plush furnishings and décor to match the mansion.
Reduced midweek rates are sometimes available.

The Scotsman
$$$–$$$$
Old Town
Only minutes from the Royal Mile or Princes Street, this is one of the
brightest and most stylish hotels in Old Town. Its name honors the news-
paper that was published on these premises for nearly a century.
Traditional styling and cutting-edge design are wed in the 1904 baronial
limestone pile, a city landmark since it was first constructed. The 68 units,
from the Study Room to the Baron Suite, vary in size (from 28 sq. m [300
sq. ft.] to a whopping 103 sq. m [1,110 sq. ft.]) and aspect, such as views
of the castle or toward Calton Hill and Firth of Forth. They include state-
of-the-art bathrooms and such extras as two-way service closets, which
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 133

means someone may pick up your laundry virtually unnoticed. The two-
floor penthouse suite is in a category of its own, with a private elevator
and balcony with barbecue. The in-house dining option is the smart North
Bridge Brasserie (restored in 2008).

Sheraton Grand Hotel
$$$$
West End
On the grounds of a former railway siding near Edinburgh’s Usher Hall,
Traverse, and Royal Lyceum theaters, this six-story postmodern structure
houses a glamorous hotel and office complex. The Sheraton is elegant,
with soaring public rooms and rich carpeting. Boasting a state-of-the-art
spa and leisure facilities (including a roof-top indoor/outdoor pool), the
hotel pretty much has it all. The spacious, well-furnished units have
double-glazed windows; glamorous suites are available, as are rooms for
travelers with disabilities. The castle-view rooms on the top floors are best
(and most expensive). The main restaurant, with views of the Festival
Square, presents well-prepared meals and a lavish Sunday buffet, while an
annex houses the Italian restaurant Santini (p. 148) below the spa.

The Witchery by the Castle
$$$$
Old Town
Part of the famous Edinburgh restaurant (p. 150), the overnight accom-
modations in the Witchery offer romantic, sumptuous, and theatrically
decorated rooms with Gothic antiques and elaborate tapestries. Most of
the hype about the suites is true: “the perfect lust-den,” “Scotland’s most
romantic hotel,” or “a jewel-box setting.” Cosmopolitan and others have
hailed this place as one of the world’s “most wonderful” places to stay.
Each lavishly decorated suite (named the Library, Vestry, Armoury, and
the like) features splendid furnishings — “fit for a lord and his lady” — and
such extras as books, chocolates, a Bose sound system, and a compli-
mentary bottle of champagne. Each suite has its own individual character.
The latest is called Sempill, featuring an oak four-poster bed in a red-velvet-
lined bedroom. The buildings near the castle date to the 17th century,
filled with open fires, opulent beds, and luxurious sitting areas. The list of
celebrity guests includes Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones,
Simpsons creator Matt Groening, and Jack Nicholson.

This hotel offers better value than many of its competi-
tors in this busy part of the Royal Mile. From the 1920s to the 1990s, it was
a branch of the Bank of Scotland, and the past is still evident in its Greek-
influenced architecture. Inside you discover high ceilings, well-chosen fur-
nishings, and king-size beds. See map p. 128. 1 S. Bridge St. % 0131-622-6800.

style during the next 150 years or so before becoming the posh George

Among the top so-called “boutique” hotels of

Run since June 2008 by the former owners of the well-
regarded Aonach Mor, this handsome three-story sandstone guesthouse is
about 1.6km (1 mile) from the center of the city. Not all of the units are
large, but they tend toward the plush side. Family rooms have one double

Dining Out
Food in Scotland is perhaps the most misunderstood aspect of the coun-
try. Too many people think that cuisine here begins and ends with
haggis, the stuffed sheep’s stomach. Believe me, there’s a lot more to the
country’s cuisine.
Scotland’s reputation for excellent fresh produce is growing. Look out for
the following delights in season: shellfish such as oysters, mussels, scal-
lops, or langoustines (aka Dublin Bay prawns); locally landed finned fish
(such as wild salmon, halibut, or sea bass); and venison, Borders lamb or
Aberdeen Angus beef. Fresh fruits and vegetables include asparagus,
purple-sprouting broccoli, raspberries, and, of course, potatoes — some
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
136

claim that the spuds grown in Ayrshire’s sandy soils are unparalleled for
their fluffy texture and rich taste.
The city of Edinburgh boasts many of the best restaurants in Scotland,
indeed a few of the best in the U.K., and the choices the capital has to
offer are more diverse today than ever before. You will find an array of
contemporary Scottish and modern British restaurants as well as
French, fish, and brasserie-style eateries along with cuisines from
around the world, particularly Indian and Thai. Plus, several restaurants
exclusively cater to vegetarians.
The majority of restaurants close in the afternoon, so if you’re looking
for lunch, don’t leave it for too late in the day. The hours I provide in the
listings that follow reflect when food may be ordered, but bars on the
premises may keep longer hours. Many restaurants also close for busi-
ness on either Sunday or Monday — and sometimes both. But during the
annual Edinburgh Festival from late July to the end of August, many
restaurants also offer extended hours. Given the crowds during this
time, you should always reserve a table in advance.
For more ideas on dining options, buy The List magazine’s (www.list.
co.uk) annual Eating & Drinking Guide, a publication that reviews hun-
dreds of restaurants, bars, and cafes in Edinburgh (and Glasgow).
Scotland is getting better at welcoming families, but it’s still a far cry
from the family-friendliness of, say, Italy or France. That said, give the
local restaurants a try, and resist the temptation to resort to well-known
international chains or fast-food outlets.
Prices
Prices may well seem expensive if you convert the cost of meals into
dollars (depending, of course, on whether the British pound stays strong
against the dollar). Still, you can find a range of choices for most budg-
ets. The prices I list here already include the 17.5 percent VAT, so you
won’t see any hidden surprises when the bill comes. If you’re looking for
bargains, inquire about pre-theater special menus, which can sometimes
be almost half the price of the regular dinner menu — or at least two
courses for the price of the normal dinner entree. If you have Internet
access, log onto www.5pm.co.uk for a list of restaurants offering early-
evening dining discounts.
Lunch and pre-theater menus in Edinburgh often offer the same food as
the full dinner menus but at a much better price. If you’re trying to save
money on your food bills, have a big late lunch or early-evening meal.
Tipping
A 10 percent gratuity is standard for service, although you shouldn’t
hesitate to leave nothing if you were badly treated. On the other hand, if
you were truly impressed, consider leaving 15 percent to 20 percent.

MODERN SCOTTISH/INTERNATIONAL
Since 1993, this has been one of the most acclaimed and stylish restau-
rants in Edinburgh. Meals are prepared using lots of local and some
organic ingredients, displaying flair but not excessive amounts of fuss or
fancy presentation. Favorites include dishes such as a plate of roasted sea
bass served with Dauphinois potatoes, baby spinach, charcoal-grilled egg-
plant, and baby fennel. Yum. Or how about seared scallops served with
chilies and garlic on lemon linguini? The desserts are equally superb. The
wine list is excellent but not cheap, with most bottles costing in excess of
£20 ($37). Those on a tighter budget should try the cafe blue (p. 141), on
the same premises.

Old Town
SPANISH
Just off the Royal Mile (near the World’s End Close), with views north to
Calton Hill and the Royal High School, is this casual tapas bar, which I
prefer to its partner next door, the fine-food Spanish restaurant Iggs.
Relaxed and usually staffed by natives of Spanish-speaking countries,
Barioja is fun, friendly, and often lively. The kitchen’s tapas come in rea-
sonably substantial portions: whether deep-fried squid, garlicky king
prawns, or spicy chorizo sausages. Desserts are posted on the blackboard.

Open for over 30 years, the diner’s burgers are cooked to order with a vari-
ety of toppings (from cheese to garlic butter) and are served with fries,
salad, and a full array of condiments. The only drawback of Bell’s, aside from
its small space, is its limited hours of operation: It’s only open in the

often featured menu selections. The restaurant closes after lunch and
reopens for dinner, but the ground-level Café Royal Circle Bar is open
throughout the day. The menu there is more limited but also less pricey.

Calistoga

Southside
AMERICAN
Unique in Scotland (as far as I know, anyway), this restaurant attempts to
re-create “California cuisine” on the capital’s less touristy side of town. In
truth, Calistoga focuses on Pacific Rim–style recipes, which can mean
dishes as diverse as curried gazpacho, ginger-and-scallion-roasted monk-
fish, or a seven-peppered rib-eye steak. The wine list, however, is devoted
almost exclusively to California vintages, including Napa Valley chardon-
nays and Russian River pinot noirs. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed,
with a West Coast radio station playing in the background, thanks to the
Internet. It’s almost like being in L.A.

Picnic fare
The Edinburgh weather doesn’t always lend itself to outdoor dining on an expanse of
lawn, but there are certainly days when the sun shines warmly enough to enjoy a picnic
at Princes Street Gardens, the Meadows, Holyrood Park, or along the Water of Leith or
in the Botanic Gardens.
If you’re in the central area of town, the best place to pick up some deli goods is
undoubtedly Valvona & Crolla, 19 Elm Row (at the top of Leith Walk; % 0131-556-6066).
This Italian shop has an excellent reputation throughout the U.K. and offers a wonder-
ful range of cheeses, cured meats, and fresh fruit and vegetables, plus baked goods
from rolls to sourdough loaves, all the condiments you may need, and wine. Another
option in New Town is the food hall at the top of Harvey Nichols department store, 30–34
St. Andrew Sq. (% 0131-524-8388). Freshly prepared salads, lots of dried goods, and
fresh fruit and vegetables are all stocked here.
In Stockbridge, IJ Mellis Cheesemongers, on Bakers Place (% 0131-225-6566), sells
award-winning British and Irish cheeses. The Mellis staff really know their stuff; and
you can find the shop in Old Town, on Victoria Street, and south of the city center, on
Morningside Road.
If you’re on the south side of the city near the Meadows, Peckham’s, on Bruntsfield
Place (% 0131-229-7054), is a solid choice for filling a picnic basket. But if you like
Mexican food — Monterrey Jack cheese, real tortillas, and the like — visit Lupe Pintos
in Tollcross, at 24 Leven St. (near the King’s Theatre; % 0131-228-6241). The shop also
stocks some American goods, such as beef jerky, dill pickles, and peanut butter.
Heading toward the Botanic Gardens on the other side of town in Canonmills, at the
roundabout, is a nice Spanish deli called Dionika (% 0131-652-3993).

Chef David Bann has been at the forefront of meat-free cooking in
Edinburgh for more than a decade. He comes from the school of thought
that vegetarian meals must be tasty and healthy. The menu at his epony-

tic: Dishes have international influences, from Mexico to Thailand. The
dining room is as stylish as the cooking, and to top it off, the prices are
very reasonable.

Thanks to its restored Victorian-era Royal Bank of Scotland premises on
posh George Street, with Corinthian columns, intricate mosaic tile flooring,
marble-topped bar, potted palms, and towering flower arrangements — all
under an elaborate domed ceiling — it is only honest to say that most
people come here for the look of the Dome Grill Room and Bar. It oozes
class and elegance. Alas, the last time I visited, they rather ruined the
ambience with a loud, modern pop/R&B/dance soundtrack that belonged
at the All Bar One branch across the street. The selection of food includes
smoked salmon starters, bowls of mussels, or breast of duck. At the rear
of the building is the garden cafe, which backs onto Rose Street.

Miller family founded the restaurant in the early 1990s, and their chefs
offer such enticing dishes as fresh Loch Fyne oysters, acclaimed as among
Great Britain’s finest; mussels in white wine sauce; or breaded and crispy
fish cakes. Of course the fresh fish depends on what’s been landed: It might
be sea trout or turbot. If you can’t make it to Leith, you can also find a

No, that’s not a misspelling of the name: This restaurant at the top of the
Harvey Nichols boutique department store has excellent views of the Firth
of Forth from the fourth floor of the building. It combines excellent con-
temporary Scottish cooking with those commanding vistas. While you do
feel like you’re dining in a department store annex (despite the slick, min-
imalist décor), the food can be phenomenal, whether a succulent and
robust braised ox tail or a light salad with endive and seasonal truffles.
The produce used by the kitchen is notably fresh. The brasserie menu,
while less extensive than the restaurant’s selections, offers good value
with a fixed-price £14 ($26) lunch and serves an “afternoon menu” between
lunch and dinner. The bar mixes some wonderful cocktails.

Valvona & Crolla Caffe Bar (19 Elm Row; % 0131-556-6066): Also at the top of Leith Walk,
this place is best known as one of the U.K.’s finest Italian delis. But if you can get past

and innovative: For example, the menu might include dishes such as a
saddle of Scottish venison with a beet-root fondant or a medley of sea bass
and scallops, served with fennel, olives, and tomato. While the evening à

Town is probably the most convenient. The minichain’s motto is “fine food
without the faff” — and I might add “sold at reasonable prices” as well.
Typical dishes include pan-seared supreme of chicken, honey-cured
Scottish salmon, or gnocchi with fresh basil pesto. You can still bring your
own bottle, but the wine list at Howies is as reasonably priced as its menu.

The kebab is usually a late-night meal wolfed down by students standing
in the streets after they have danced their heads off in the club. And while
the late weekend hours of this simple diner means they do indeed attract
students, Kebab Mahal is much more. Drawing a cross-section of the city,
from dusty construction workers on a break to tweed-clad professors grad-
ing papers, this basic Indian restaurant — where you may have to share
your table with others — has become a landmark. Although the counter is
full of hot food, most of the main courses are prepared separately in a
kitchen to the rear. True to its Islamic owner’s faith, Kebab Mahal doesn’t
have a license to serve alcohol, and doesn’t allow diners to bring their
own, either. It also closes every Friday from 1 to 2 p.m. for prayers.

and almost naive paintings on the wall. The menu might feature a hearty
roast or cassoulet (stew) with beans and meat, as well as a more delicate
pan-fried filet of bream. The wines are from southern France, too. Often,
Chef Gauffre will come in the dining room to see how things are going and

as the vistas provide enough interest. The frequently changing menus include

lamb with fondant potatoes and braised cabbage. There is also a grill menu

in this now fashionable part of the Leith docklands. The décor is mini-
malist, featuring modern art. The menu, which changes frequently, is kept
short and sweet, taking advantage of the best of the season. For example:
John Dory with leeks, salsify, and mussel and almond gratin. If you’re not
on a budget, push the boat out — as the Scots say — and go for the tast-

Wannaburger

Old Town
AMERICAN
Previously called Relish, Wannaburger is a modern diner in the heart of
Old Town serving what it says on the label: burgers. They come with a vari-
ety of toppings, presented on thick sesame-seed buns that can make eating
them a challenge. Best of all, the chefs here don’t seem to be afraid to cook
them medium rare on the char-grill (whereas the norm at too many places
is to serve beef burgers well-done). The meat is advertised as 100 percent
Scottish, and there are chicken and veggie options. Decent shakes as well.
Good for a fast meal on the Royal Mile.

Burgers from £5.50 ($10). MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 9 p.m. (until 10 p.m. Fri–Sat).
Wedgwood the Restaurant
$$$
Old Town
SCOTTISH/MODERN BRITISH
New to the city in 2007, this restaurant is run by Chef Paul Wedgwood (no
connections with the famous bone china producers). The menus change
with the seasons, and recipes combine Scottish ingredients with some Asian
influences here and there. A popular signature dish is salmon done three
ways: poached, smoked and cured, each with different accompaniments.

The Witchery by the Castle
$$$–$$$$
Old Town
SCOTTISH
This restaurant, so named because of historical connections to medieval
executions nearby and lingering ghosts, serves classy Scottish food in
classy surroundings, with dishes that feature ingredients such as Angus
beef, Scottish lobster, or Loch Fyne oysters. Well-prepared, old-time British
favorites, such as an omelet Arnold Bennett (made with cream and smoked
fish), contrast with specials such as pan-roasted monkfish with a thyme
and lemon risotto. Atmospheric and good for special occasions, it is also
ideal for a sumptuous late meal. In addition to the dining room nearest the
street, there is also the “Secret Garden” farther down the narrow close.

Exploring Edinburgh
Edinburgh’s reputation is enormous, and the city essentially lives up to
all the hype. The second-most-popular destination after London for visi-
tors to Great Britain, the Scottish capital is one of the most picturesque
cities in Europe. Built on a set of hills, it’s unarguably dramatic.
Edinburgh’s Old Town is at the city’s heart, featuring the dramatic
Edinburgh Castle at the top end of the Royal Mile, a street that follows
the spine of a hill down to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. For many visi-
tors, this is Edinburgh, with its mews, closes, and alleyways.
But across the valley to the north, a valley now filled by the verdant
Princes Street Gardens, is the city’s New Town, which dates to the
1770s. Here you can find tidy streets and broad avenues, with shops,
squares, and attractions such as the National Portrait Gallery. New
Town reaches out to the villagelike setting of Stockbridge, from which
one can walk along the city’s narrow meandering river, the Water of
Leith, to Dean Village (another district that feels almost rural in nature),
home of the National Gallery of Modern Art and its sister art venue,
the Dean Gallery.
South of Old Town is the sprawling Meadows, with its acres of grass, the
precincts of Edinburgh University, and suburbs such as Marchmont. To
the north are the port of Leith and the Firth of Forth, which empties
into the North Sea.
The only problem with Edinburgh’s many attractions is deciding what
you have time to see. You would need at least a few days to visit every
place listed in this section, so you need to make some decisions depend-
ing on how long you’re planning to be in the city. If you have children in
tow, fewer galleries and more family attractions would probably be best;
if you like art, more museums and fewer wanders may be in store.
Edinburgh’s famous annual cultural celebration — the Edinburgh
Festival — brings in tourists and lovers of all forms of art from around
the world. But if you prefer a bit more space and smaller crowds, avoid
the month of August in Edinburgh.
During the Edinburgh Festival, many museums that are normally closed
on Sunday are open, and hours are generally extended. Some museums
that open only in summer are also open on public holidays.

Rising some 106m (350 ft.) above sea level, this bluff full of monuments is
partially responsible for Edinburgh’s being called the “Athens of the

also to enjoy the panoramic views of the Firth of Forth and the city. The
unfinished colonnades at the summit are part of the so-called National
Monument, which was meant to honor the Scottish soldiers killed during
the Napoleonic wars. However, money for the project ran out in 1829, and
the William H. Playfair–designed structure (once referred to as “Edinburgh
Disgrace”) was never finished.
The Nelson Monument, containing mementos of the hero of Trafalgar,
dates from 1815 and rises more than 30m (100 ft.) above the hill. A time ball
at the top of the monument falls at 1 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and
historically it helped sailors in Leith set their timepieces. From April
through September, the monument is open Monday 1 to 6 p.m. and Tuesday
through Saturday 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; from October through March, it’s open
Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is £3 ($5.55).
The old City Observatory along the western summit of Calton Hill was
designed in 1818 by Playfair, whose uncle happened to be the president of
the Astronomical Institute, for which is was built. Nearby, the circular
Dougal Stewart’s Monument of 1831 (by Playfair as well) is not dissimilar
to colonnades of the 1830 Burns Monument, designed by Thomas
Hamilton on the southern slopes of Calton Hill. It replicates the Choragic
Monument of Lysicrates in Athens, which was also the inspiration for his
earlier monument to honor the poet in Alloway (see Chapter 15).
Down the hill toward Princes Street, the Old Calton Burial Grounds offers
a curiosity of special interest to visitors from the United States. The
Emancipation Monument (Lincoln Monument), erected in 1893, was ded-
icated to soldiers of Scottish descent who lost their lives in America’s Civil
War. It has a statue of President Abraham Lincoln with a freed slave at his
feet. Some famous Scots are buried in this cemetery, too, with elaborate
tombs honoring their memory (notably the Robert Adam–designed tomb
for philosopher David Hume). Take at least one hour to explore Calton Hill.
See map p. 152. Walk up Calton Hill from the north end of Princes Street or from Leith
Street. You can also drive up and park. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round dawn to dusk.
Edinburgh Castle
Old Town
Few places in Scotland have lore that can equal Edinburgh Castle’s. The
very early history is somewhat vague, but in the 11th century, Malcolm III
and his Saxon queen, later venerated as St. Margaret, founded a castle on
this spot. There are only fragments of their original pile in St. Margaret’s
Chapel — in fact, the oldest structure in Edinburgh. Built in the Norman
style, the oblong structure dates principally to the 12th century. After hun-
dreds and hundreds of years of destruction, demolitions, and upheavals,
the buildings that stand today are basically those that resulted from the
castle’s role as a military garrison over the past 300 years or so. It still bar-
racks soldiers. And much of the displays are devoted to military history,
which might limit the place’s appeal for some. The castle vaults served as
prisons for foreign soldiers in the 18th century, and these great storerooms
housed hundreds of Napoleonic soldiers in the early 19th century. Some
prisoners made wall carvings still visible today. Among the batteries of
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
154

armaments that protected the castle is the medieval siege cannon, known
as Mons Meg, which weighs more than 5 tons.
However, Edinburgh Castle is not all about war, and visitors can see where
Mary Queen of Scots gave birth to James VI of Scotland (later James I of
England). Scottish Parliaments once convened in the Great Hall, while
another highlight is the Scottish Crown Jewels, used at the coronations,
along with the scepter and sword of state of Scotland and the infamous
Stone of Scone. Note that last entry is 45 minutes before closing. Allow
about two hours.

Gladstone’s Land
Old Town
Now run by the National Trust for Scotland, which rescued the property
from demolition in the 1930s, this 17th-century merchant’s house is deco-
rated in period-style furnishings. It’s not very large, though, and is perhaps
worth a visit if only to get an impression of the confined living conditions
some 400 years ago, even for the reasonably well-off. Note, too, how small
the doorways are — don’t bump your head. The merchant Gladstone (then
spelled Gledstane) expanded the original 16th-century structure he pur-
chased in 1617 both upward and toward the street. In the front room,
added to the second floor, you still can see the original facade with its
friezes of classical columns and arches. I particularly admire the sensi-
tively restored timber ceiling, suitably weathered and aged but with col-
orful paintings of flowers and fruit. Allow about one hour.

For fans of Mr. Hyde
Not far from Gladstone’s Land is Brodie’s Close, a stone-floored alley off the
Lawnmarket. It was named after the well-respected cabinet-making father of the noto-
rious William Brodie, who was a respectable councilor and deacon of trades by day —
but a notorious thief and ne’er-do-well by night. Brodie’s apparent split personality (actu-
ally he was simply calculating and devious) was likely the inspiration for Robert Louis
Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Brodie was finally caught and
hanged for his crimes in 1788. In a final irony, the mechanism used in the hangman’s
scaffold was perfected by none other than Brodie himself — and he tried to defy its
action by secretly wearing a steel collar under his shirt. It didn’t work. Across the street
from Brodie’s Close is one of the more famous pubs along the Royal Mile: Deacon
Brodie’s Tavern, 435 Lawnmarket (% 0131-225-6531).

Museum of Scotland
Old Town
Opened in 1998, this impressive, modern sandstone building not far from
the Royal Mile offers exhibits that follow the story of Scotland, including
archaeology, technology, science, the decorative arts, royalty, and geol-
ogy. Hundreds of millions of years of Scottish history are distilled on each
of the museum’s floors. There’s a total of some 12,000 items, ranging from
2.9-billion-year-old rocks found on the island of South Uist to a cute
Hillman Imp, one of the last of 500 automobiles manufactured in Scotland.
One gallery is devoted to Scotland’s centuries as an independent nation
before it merged with England and Wales to form Great Britain in the first
decade of the 18th century. Another gallery, devoted to industry and
empire from 1707 to 1914, includes exhibits on shipbuilding, whisky dis-
tilling, railways, and such textiles as the tartan and paisley. The roof
garden has excellent views, the Tower Restaurant offers superb lunches
(% 0131-225-3003), and adjacent to the Museum of Scotland is the Royal
Museum, with its well-preserved and airy Victorian-era Main Hall and
some 36 more galleries. Allow about two or three hours.
See map p. 152. Chambers Street. % 0131-247-4422. www.nms.ac.uk. Bus: 2, 7, 23,
31, 35, 41, or 42. Admission: Free. Open: Daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
National Gallery of Scotland
New Town
Although the fine art collection held by Scotland may seem small by the
standards of larger countries, it has been chosen with great care and
expanded by bequests, gifts, loans, and purchases. These rooms have only
enough space to display part of the entire body of work. One major recent
acquisition was Botticelli’s The Virgin Adoring the Sleeping Christ Child. The
gallery also has works by El Greco and Velázquez, and Dutch art by
Rembrandt and Van Dyck. Impressionism and post-Impressionism are rep-
resented by Cézanne, Degas, van Gogh, Monet, Renoir, Gauguin, and
Seurat. In the basement wing (opened in 1978), Scottish art is highlighted,
including late-19th-century work by the “Glasgow Boys,” represented by
artists such as Sir James Guthrie. Another favorite is the whimsical por-
trait of The Rev. Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, by (although
some dispute this) Sir Henry Raeburn, in the late 18th century.
Next door is the Royal Scottish Academy (% 0131-624-6200), connected
by the modern-designed Weston Link. The RSA was renovated and now
hosts blockbuster exhibitions, such as paintings by Monet or Titian. Allow
about 11⁄2 hours.
A convenient way to see the Scottish National Galleries is by catching
the courtesy gallery bus that stops at each branch.

The Palace of Holyroodhouse
Old Town
King James IV, at the beginning of the 16th century, established this palace
adjacent to an abbey that King David I had founded in 1128. What you see
today was mostly built for Charles II in the 1670s. The north tower is the
earliest piece of the palace that remains intact, and inside it is the most
interesting part of any visit. This wing was the scene of Holyroodhouse’s
most dramatic incident, when Mary Queen of Scots’ Italian secretary,
David Rizzio, was stabbed repeatedly by her jealous husband, Lord
Darnley and his accomplices in 1566. Among several diverting Stuart relics,
curios, and bits of history in Mary’s Outer Chamber, one of the more curi-
ous exhibits is a piece of needlework done by Mary depicting a cat-and-
mouse scene. (Her cousin, Queen Elizabeth I, is the cat.)
The palace suffered long periods of neglect, but it basked in brief glory
during a ball thrown by Bonnie Prince Charlie in the mid–18th century,
during the peak of his feverish (and doomed) rebellion to restore the Stuart
line to monarchy. Today the royal family stays here whenever they visit
Edinburgh. When they’re not in residence, the palace is open to visitors,
and you see the various reception rooms where the queen dines, enter-
tains, and meets Scottish government leaders. Some of the rich tapestries,
paneling, massive fireplaces, and antiques from the 1700s are still in place.
The Great Gallery boasts portraits of Scottish monarchs. More recently, the
modern Queen’s Gallery (additional admission) opened to display works
from the royal collection, whether Mughal art or Dutch paintings. All that
remains of the original Abbey is the nave, roofless and in ruins, but you
can imagine its grandeur and see a few tombstones and the vault where the
remains of King James V were kept. On the path behind the nave, remnants
of the foundations of other ecclesiastical buildings are apparent.
Behind Holyroodhouse is Holyrood Park, Edinburgh’s largest. With rocky
crags, a loch, sweeping meadows, and the ruins of a chapel, it’s a wee bit
of the Scottish countryside in the city, and a great place for a picnic. If
you’re fit and ambitious, climb up to the summit of 250m-high (823-ft.)
Arthur’s Seat, from which the panorama is breathtaking. The name 
doesn’t refer to King Arthur, as many people assume, but perhaps is a ref-
erence to Prince Arthur of Strathclyde or a corruption of Ard Thor, Gaelic
for “height of Thor.” Allow about two or three hours.

Princes Street Gardens
New Town
A drained loch to the north of Old Town is now filled by the Princes Street
Gardens, the most-used outdoor public park in the city. With Edinburgh
Castle above, this is one of the most picturesque outdoor public spaces
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 157

in Europe. If you want a little exercise, climb the 287 steps to the top of
the 60m (200-ft.) Scott Monument (admission charged) in the East Gardens
for a better view. Resembling a church spire on a continental European
cathedral, the Gothic-inspired monument is one of Edinburgh’s most rec-
ognizable landmarks. In the center of the tall spire is a large seated statue
of Sir Walter Scott and his dog, Maida, with Scott’s heroes carved as small
figures in the monument. Allow about one hour.

Oct–Mar Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–3 p.m. and Sun 10 a.m.–3 p.m.
Royal Botanic Garden
New Town
This is one of the grandest parks in all of Great Britain, which is certainly
saying something. Sprawling across 28 hectares (70 acres), it dates from
the late 17th century, when it was originally used for medical studies. In
spring, the various rhododendrons, from ground cover to gigantic shrubs,
are almost reason alone to visit, but the planting in various areas assures
year-round interest, whether in the rock garden or along the deep “herba-

Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art
New Town/West End
Scotland’s national collection of 20th-century art occupies a gallery con-
verted from an 1828 school set on 4.8 hectares (12 acres) of grounds, about
a 20-minute walk from the Haymarket railway station. The collection is
international in scope and high quality despite its modest size, with works

Hume in Nor’ Loch
When the area of Princes Street Gardens was still a bog, the distinguished philosopher
and renowned agnostic David Hume fell in, couldn’t get out, and called for help from a
passing woman. She recognized him, denounced his lack of faith, and refused to offer
her umbrella to pull him out of the mire until he recited the Lord’s Prayer. Presumably,
he obliged.

ranging from Matisse, Braque, Miró, and Picasso to Balthus, Lichtenstein,
and Hockney. Recently the grounds in front of the museum were dramati-
cally landscaped, with grassy terraces and a pond, into a piece of art itself
called Landform, by Baltimore-born Charles Jencks. A cafe sells light
refreshments and salads. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

Scottish National Portrait Gallery
New Town
Housed in a red-stone Victorian neo-Gothic pile — designed by Robert
Rowand Anderson — at the east end of Queen Street, the country’s por-
trait gallery gives you a chance to see many famous Scots. The portraits
by Rodin, Kokoschka, Ramsay, and Raeburn, among others, include every-
body from Mary Queen of Scots and Flora MacDonald to early golfers,
authors, and enlightenment thinkers. But it’s not all historical characters,
as modern portraits include Sean Connery and Billy Connolly. In addition
to paintings, sculptures, miniatures, and the National Photographic
Collection are also on display (although the latter is destined to have a
home of its own). Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

Scottish Parliament Building
Old Town
After much controversy over its cost — the better part of £500 million
(around $925 million) — and the time it took to construct, the new Scottish
Parliament finally opened in autumn of 2004. Designed by the late
Barcelona-based architect Enric Miralles, it’s a remarkable bit of modern
design and perhaps worth the expense and delays. The abstract motif
repeated on the facade was apparently inspired by Raeburn’s painting The
Rev. Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch, which hangs in the
National Gallery of Scotland (see listing earlier). The public can make a
free visit and get tickets to seats in the main debating chamber or take a
guided tour, which goes into the bowels of Scottish political life. Allow
about one hour.

Dean Gallery
New Town/West End
Opening in 1999 across the road from the Scottish Gallery of Modern Art,
the Dean Gallery provides a home for surrealist art and includes a replica
studio of Leith-born pop-art pioneer Eduardo Paolozzi. He gave an exten-
sive body of his private collection to the National Galleries of Scotland,
including prints, drawings, plaster maquettes, and molds. The artist’s
mammoth composition of the robotic Vulcan dominates the entrance hall.
Elsewhere works by Salvador Dalí, Max Ernst, and Joan Miró are displayed,
while the Dean also hosts traveling and special exhibitions of modern art.

Edinburgh Zoo
Corstorphine, west of Murrayfield
Scotland’s largest animal collection is 4.5km (3 miles) west of Edinburgh’s
city center on 32 hectares (80 acres) of hillside parkland, offering unrivaled
views from the Pentlands to the Firth of Forth. Run by the Royal Zoological
Society of Scotland, the zoo emphasizes its role in the conservation of
wildlife and contains more than 1,500 animals, including a few endangered
species: snow leopards, white rhinos, pygmy hippos, and others. The zoo
has the largest penguin colony in Europe, housed in the world’s largest
penguin enclosure. From April to September, a penguin parade is held daily
at 2:15 p.m. Allow at least two hours.

The Fruitmarket Gallery
New Town
Near Waverley Station, this is the city’s leading independent, contempo-
rary art gallery, housed in an old covered market that was dramatically
updated and modernized by architect Richard Murphy in the early 1990s.
It hosts exhibits of internationally renowned modern and conceptual
artists, including Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman, and Yoko Ono — and
local champions, such as Chad McCail and Nathan Coley. The
Fruitmarket’s bookshop and cafe are equally appealing. Across the street
is the less innovative but still worthy city-run Edinburgh City Art Centre

Georgian House
New Town
Charlotte Square, designed by the great Robert Adam, was the final piece
of the city’s first New Town development. The National Trust for Scotland
has two bits of property here: No. 28 on the south side of the square (its
headquarters with a small gallery) and, on the northern side, this town
house, which has been refurbished and opened to the public. The furni-
ture is mainly Hepplewhite, Chippendale, and Sheraton, all from the 18th
century. A sturdy old four-poster bed with an original 18th-century canopy
occupies a ground-floor bedroom. The nearby dining room has a table set
with fine Wedgwood china as well as the piss pot that was passed around
after the women folk had retired. Allow about one hour.

Greyfriars Kirk
Old Town
Although the churches of Scotland are not generally on the same scale as
the cathedrals of the Continent, they do have their own slightly austere
allure. Dedicated in 1620, this kirk was the first “reformed” church in
Edinburgh and became the center of a good bit of history. It was built amid
a cemetery that Queen Mary proposed in 1562 because there was no more
burial space at St. Giles Cathedral on the Royal Mile. In 1638, the National
Covenant, favoring Scottish Presbyterianism to the English Episcopacy, was
signed here and an original copy is displayed. Among the many restora-
tions, one in the 1930s brought in California redwood to create the current
ceiling. The kirkyard’s collection of 17th-century monuments and grave-
stones is impressive. The most celebrated grave, however, contains a 19th-
century policeman whose faithful dog, Bobby, reputedly stood watch for
years. The tenacious terrier’s first portrait (painted in 1867) hangs here,
while a statue of the wee dog — made famous by Hollywood — is nearby
at the top of Candlemaker Row, just outside the pub named in his honor.
Allow about one hour.

High Kirk of St. Giles (St. Giles Cathedral)
Old Town
A brief walk downhill from Edinburgh Castle, this church — and its steeple
in particular — is one of the most important architectural landmarks along
the Royal Mile. Here is where John Knox, Scotland’s Martin Luther,
preached his sermons on the Reformation. Often called St. Giles Cathedral,
the building combines a dark and brooding stone exterior (the result of a
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 161

Victorian-era restoration) with surprisingly graceful buttresses. Only the
tower represents the medieval era of the church. One of its outstanding
features is Thistle Chapel, housing beautiful stalls and notable heraldic
stained-glass windows. Allow about one hour.

John Knox House
Old Town
This is arguably the most picturesque building in Edinburgh’s Old Town.
John Knox is acknowledged as the father of the Presbyterian Church of
Scotland, the Protestant tenets of which he established in 1560. While
some regard him as a prototypical Puritan, he actually proposed progres-
sive changes in the ruling of the church and in education; he was also quite
renowned for sharp wit and sarcasm. Knox lived at a time of great religious
and political upheaval: He spent two years as a galley slave for agitating
against papal authority and later lived in exile in Geneva (ruled by Jean
Calvin). Upon his return, he became minister of St. Giles and worked to
ensure the Reformation’s success in Scotland.
Even if you’re not overly interested in the firebrand reformer (who may
have never lived here anyway), you might still want to visit this late-15th-
century house. It’s characteristic of the “lands” that used to flank the Royal
Mile, and the house is noteworthy for its painted ceiling. Before Knox
allegedly moved in, it was the home of James Mosman, goldsmith to the
Catholic Mary Queen of Scots (who obviously was no friend of Knox’s).
Following three years of renovations, the house reopened in 2006 and is
now integrated into the completely modernized Scottish Storytelling
Centre. Allow about one hour.

The Meadows
Southside
South of Old Town, this expansive public park separates the city center
from the suburbs and leafy neighborhoods that popped up in the 18th and
19th centuries. It dates to the 1700s, when a loch on the location was
drained. Tree-lined paths crisscross the soccer, rugby, and cricket fields,
and you can find plenty of space for having a picnic or flying a kite. At the
far western end of the Meadows is Bruntsfield Links, a short-hole course
that has a role in golf history as one of the places where the sport was first
played — and it still can be during the summer. Allow one to four hours.

Museum of Childhood
Old Town
Allegedly the world’s first museum devoted solely to the history of child-
hood, this popular and free museum is just past the intersection of High
and Blackfriars streets. The contents of its four floors range from antique
toys to games to exhibits on health, education, and costumes; plus there
are video presentations and an activity area. Not surprisingly, this is often
the noisiest museum in town, although some argue that adults enjoy it
more than kids do. Allow about one hour.

Our Dynamic Earth
Old Town
Under a futuristic tentlike canopy near the new Scottish Parliament, Our
Dynamic Earth celebrates the evolution and diversity of the planet, with
emphasis on the seismological and biological processes that led from the
Big Bang to the world we know today. The presentation has been called
“physical evolution as interpreted by Disney” — audio and video clips,
buttons you can push to simulate earthquakes, meteor showers, and views
of outer space. There is the slimy green primordial soup where life began
and a series of specialized aquariums, some with replicas of early life
forms, others with actual living sharks, dolphins, and coral. A simulated
tropical rain forest darkens skies at 15-minute intervals, offering torrents
of rainfall and creepy-crawlies underfoot. On the premises are a restau-
rant, a cafe, a children’s play area, and a gift shop. Last entry is 70 minutes
before closing. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

Outlook Tower and Camera Obscura
Old Town
The 150-year-old periscope-like lens at the top of the Outlook Tower
throws an image of nearby streets and buildings onto a circular table,
which can be almost magically magnified with just a bit of cardboard.
Guides reveal this trick and help to identify landmarks and discuss high-
lights of Edinburgh’s history. In addition, the observation deck offers free
telescopes, and there are several exhibits in the “World of Illusions” with
an optical theme that will keep some children occupied. What is disap-
pointing, however, is the dearth of information on the man responsible for
the Camera Obscura, Sir Patrick Geddes, a polymath who worked tirelessly
to improve the fortunes of the Old Town in the 19th and 20th centuries
and kept it from being torn down. The last camera presentation begins one
hour before closing. Allow about one hour.

The Real Mary King’s Close
Old Town
Beneath the municipal City Hall on the Royal Mile lies a warren of hidden
streets where people lived and worked for centuries. When the Royal
Exchange (now the City Chambers) was constructed in 1753, the top floors
of the existing buildings were torn down and the lower sections were left
standing to be used as the foundations. This left a number of dark, mys-
terious passages largely intact. These underground closes, originally very
narrow walkways with houses on either side, date back centuries. In 2003,
groups led by guides dressed up as characters from the past began to visit
these dwellings for the first time in perhaps 250 years. During the tours,
visitors return to the turbulent and plague-ridden days of the 17th century.
Dim lighting and an audio track are intended to add to the experience. The
tour takes about one hour.

Royal Yacht Britannia
Leith
The royal yacht Britannia launched on April 16, 1953, and traveled more
than one million miles before it was decommissioned in December 1997.
Several cities competed to permanently harbor the ship as a tourist attrac-
tion. The port of Leith won, and today the ship is moored next to the
Ocean Terminal shopping mall some 3km (2 miles) from Edinburgh’s
center. Once you’re aboard, a 90-minute audio tour will guide you about
the vessel. You can see where Prince Charles and Princess Diana strolled
the deck on their honeymoon; visit the drawing room and the Royal apart-
ments; and explore the engine room, galleys, and captain’s cabin. Allow
about 11⁄2 hours.

Burns (1759–96), Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832), and Robert Louis Stevenson
(1850–94). The Writers’ Museum is often a surprisingly uncrowded space.
The basement is perhaps best, with a good deal of items from the life of
Stevenson (including his fishing rod and riding boots), as well as a gallery
of black-and-white photographs taken when he lived in the South Pacific.
The main floor is devoted to Scott with his dining-room table from 39
Castle St., his pipe, chess set, and original manuscripts. Another set of
rooms gives details of Burns’s life (note his page-one death notice in a copy
of London’s Herald, dated 27 July, 1796) along with his writing desk, rare
manuscripts, portraits, and other items. The premises, Lady Stair’s House,
with its narrow passages and low clearances, were originally built in 1622
for Edinburgh merchant Sir William Gray. Allow about one hour.

Chapter 11: Edinburgh 165
The father of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
Robert Louis Stevenson (1850–94) was a restless character. Raised in Edinburgh, he
found the place unsuitable for his frail constitution. This, combined with his wanderlust,
meant that he spent much of his life traveling and living outside his native Scotland. The
author has been alternately hailed as Scotland’s greatest writer and dismissed as noth-
ing more than the creator of tall tales for children, though surely the former is more
accurate.
He was the son of Margaret and Thomas Stevenson, born into a family famed for its
Scottish civil-engineering projects, especially lighthouses. Robert was a sickly child
and, as a young adult, something of disappointment to his father. After he allowed his
son to bow out of engineering and the lucrative family business, Thomas made Robert
attend law school, vowing that “the devious and barren paths of literature” were not
suitable. Undaunted, Stevenson became a writer and a bit of a rogue. One of his favorite
bars still stands today: Rutherford’s, on Drummond Street near South Bridge Street.
Determined to roam (“I shall be a nomad”) and write, he went to France where he met
and later married an American, Fanny Osborne, with whom he traveled to California.
Following the success of The Sea-Cook (1881), which became the ever-popular Treasure
Island, Stevenson produced The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, an instant
bestseller and his most famous work — thanks in no small part to later Hollywood adap-
tations. That was quickly followed by the classic Kidnapped (1886), his most evocative
book. It reflects the troubled political times in Scotland after the failed 1745 rebellion of
Bonnie Prince Charlie and the book takes its 16-year-old hero on an adventure across
the Western Highlands.
Eventually Stevenson and Fanny settled in Samoa, hoping to find a climate that would
suit his scarred lungs. While there, Stevenson worked on the unfinished classic, Weir
of Hermiston (published posthumously in 1896). On December 3, 1894, only 43 years old,
he collapsed and died.

Guided tours
For an entertaining, one-hour overview and introduction to the principal
attractions of Edinburgh, consider the Edinburgh Bus Tours that leave
every 20 minutes or so from Waverley Bridge from April to late October.
You can see most of the major sights along the Royal Mile, the
Grassmarket, Princes Street, George Street, and more from the double-
decker open-top motor coaches. Three tours — Edinburgh Tour (green
buses), City Sightseeing (red buses), and Mac Tours (vintage buses) —
all cover roughly the same ground in Old Town and New Town. The
Majestic Tour buses, however, make short work of the city center as
they go down to Leith as well. Tickets are valid for 24 hours, and you can
hop on and hop off the bus at designated stops as you choose. The first
tour is at 9:30 a.m., and the last is usually around 5:40 p.m. (slightly later
from July through Sept). For more information on Edinburgh Bus Tours,
call % 0131-220-0770 (www.edinburghtour.com). Tickets are £13 ($24)
adults, £11 ($21) seniors or students, £5 ($9) children (free for children
under 5), and £31 ($58) for a family.
The Edinburgh Literary Pub Tour traces the footsteps of such literary
greats as Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Sir Walter Scott,
going into the city’s taverns and highlighting the tales of The Strange Case
of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or the erotic love poetry of Burns. They leave
nightly at 7:30 p.m. from the Beehive Inn, a popular pub on the
Grassmarket, from May to September; Thursday to Sunday in March,
April, and October; and only on Friday from November to March. For
more information, call % 0131-226-6665 (www.edinburghliterary
pubtour.co.uk). Reservations are recommended for groups during the
high season. You can purchase tickets at the Beehive; prices are £8 ($15).
Edinburgh’s history is filled with tales of ghosts, gore, and witchcraft,
and the Witchery Tours are enlivened by characters who leap out of
seemingly nowhere when you least expect it. Two tours — the 90-minute
“Ghost & Gore” and the 78-minute “Murder & Mystery” — overlap in
parts. Scenes of horrific torture, murder, and supernatural occurrence in
Old Town are visited under the cloak of darkness. The ghost tour (which
runs May–Aug) departs nightly at 7 and 7:30 p.m., with the Murder tour
(year-round) leaving at 9 and 9:30 p.m. All tours depart from outside the
Witchery Restaurant on Castlehill. For tickets — £7.50 ($14) adults, £5
($9) children — visit the tour office at 84 West Bow (% 0131-225-6745;
www.witcherytours.com). Reservations are required.
Mercat Tours is a well-established company that conducts popular walk-
ing tours of the city, covering a range of interests from “Secrets of the
Royal Mile” to “Ghosts & Ghouls,” which only takes place in the evening.
The tours leave from the Mercat Cross, outside St. Giles Cathedral, on
the Royal Mile. Contact Mercat Tours (% 0131-255-5443; www.mercat
tours.co.uk) for reservations. Tickets cost £7.50 ($14) adults, £4
($7.50) for children.

Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
You may just want to wander around Edinburgh, which is easy enough —
it’s a small place and many of the tourist attractions are within the cen-
tral part of the city. However, if your time in the capital is limited to a few
days, here are some suggested itineraries that highlight some of the very
best things to do and see.
If you have one day
If you’re unfortunate enough to only have one day in Edinburgh, I sug-
gest that you stick to the city’s famous Royal Mile and Old Town. It is
every bit a day’s worth of activity, with plenty of history and attractions
from Edinburgh Castle to the Palace of Holyroodhouse, shops, restau-
rants, and pubs. Wander down some of the alleys off the Royal Mile, too.
If you have two days
Follow my one-day itinerary for your first day, and on your second day take

good for 24 hours (although the buses stop running in the late afternoon/
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 167
Edinburgh’s big summer events
The cultural highlight of Edinburgh’s year comes every August during the Edinburgh
International Festival and Edinburgh Festival Fringe. Since 1947, the International
Festival has attracted artists and companies of the highest rank, whether in classical
music, opera, ballet, or theater. Running almost simultaneously is the Fringe, an oppor-
tunity for anybody — professionals or nonprofessionals, individuals, groups of friends,
or a whole company — to put on a show wherever they can find an empty stage or
street corner. For many people today, the Fringe is the festival, thanks to its late-night
revues, contemporary drama, university theater presentations, and even full-length
opera. Over the years, the Fringe has become increasingly established (and sponsored),
though hardly less experimental and unexpected.
As if the International Festival and the Fringe weren’t enough, Edinburgh also hosts, at
about the same time, a variety of other festivals. In Charlotte Square, the Book Festival
has become a huge annual event, drawing authors such as J.K. Rowling and Toni
Morrison. You may also stumble upon a Jazz Festival or Television Festival. One of the
season’s more popular spectacles is the Military Tattoo on the floodlit esplanade of
Edinburgh Castle. The show features precision marching of not only Scottish regiments
but also soldiers and performers (including bands, drill teams, and gymnasts) from
dozens of countries.
Ticket prices for festivals, the Fringe, and other shows or events vary from £1 ($1.85) to
£50 ($93). The headquarters for the International Festival is The Hub, Castle Hill 
(% 0131-473-2000). The Fringe is based at 180 High St. (% 0131-226-0000). General infor-
mation on festivals and most events can be found on the Web at www.edinburgh

Stevenson said were the best in the city. Amble down Princes Street for a
bit of shopping, and afterwards take a break in Princes Street Gardens.
Admire some art at one of the branches of the National Gallery.
If you have three days
Your first two days should be filled with the activities I suggest above.
On your third day, take in Leith, Edinburgh’s once rough-and-tumble
port. A seaside village that is now part of Edinburgh, Leith has a rich his-
tory of its own. Today it also offers some good restaurants and lively
pubs. On your way back into the city center, also worth a visit, is the
Botanic Gardens. It’s one of the best in Great Britain — and that’s saying
a lot. If you have any time to spare, visit Stockbridge or the Meadows,
which have an off-the-main-tourist-tracks feel to them.
If you (are lucky and) have four days or more
Start with my recommendations from the previous sections and then on
your fourth day climb Arthur’s Seat for views of the city and the sea, or
if you have children, take the family to the Edinburgh Zoo. Explore the
regions around the city, heading east to the coast near North Berwick or
west to nearby historic Linlithgow.
Taking a walking tour
Given that Edinburgh is a relatively compact city, walking is one of the
best ways to see it. This fact is especially true in Old Town, where pas-
sages and alleys — or closes (pronounced cloz-es) and vennels, as the
locals prefer to call them — run off both sides of the main street like ribs
from a spine. You really owe it to yourself to wander down a few of them
to appreciate the medieval core of the Scottish capital.
If you want to leave the tourist trail, however, I have devised the follow-
ing walk south of the Royal Mile, which will give you a notion of what
“real” Edinburgh is like — and it will also take you past some historical
and architectural highlights. The route is only about 1.2km (2 miles) long
and shouldn’t take you more than an hour or so to complete (if you
don’t go into buildings or get distracted, that is).

Hogmanay
Hogmanay is what the Scots call New Year’s Eve, and Edinburgh now hosts one of the
biggest New Year’s Eve parties on the planet. In Scotland, the festivities traditionally
don’t really even begin until the clock strikes midnight, and then they continue until day-
break or later. In 1993, the Edinburgh City Council began a three-day Hogmanay festival
featuring rock bands, street theater, and a lively procession. By 1997, the event had
become so big that participation is now reserved for ticket holders. For information, visit
www.edinburghshogmanay.org.

Start the walk at:
1. West Bow
Initially this street zigzagged right up the steep slope from the
Grassmarket to Castlehill. With the 19th-century addition of
Victoria Street, however, West Bow links more easily with the Royal
Mile via George IV Bridge. The combination of Victoria Street and
West Bow creates a charming and winding road of unpretentious
shops, bars, and restaurants. At the base of the street is the West
Bow Well, which was built in 1674. To the west is the Grassmarket.
Go southeast from Cowgate. Head up Candlemaker Row to:
2. Greyfriars Kirk
This isn’t the church you see while ascending Candlemaker Row, but
instead it lies to the right at the top. Greyfriars Kirk was completed
in 1620 (for some history, flip back to the church’s listing in the sec-
tion “More cool things to see and do,” earlier in this chapter).
Cross George IV Bridge to Chambers Street and the:
3. Museum of Scotland
Directly in front of you, as you leave Greyfriars, is the impressive
and modern Museum of Scotland. It was designed by architects
Benson and Forsyth and constructed mostly with sandstone from
the northeast of Scotland. (Next door on Chambers Street is the
Royal Museum, a bonus if you have free time.) Chambers Street is
named after a 19th-century lord provost (the equivalent of a
mayor) whose statue stands in front of the museum’s Victorian
Great Hall. Farther down off Chambers Street, on what is today
Guthrie Street, you can find Sir Walter Scott’s birthplace.
Continue east on Chambers Street to South Bridge, turning right
(south). At this corner is the:
4. Old College
The 1781 exteriors of the University of Edinburgh Old College have
been called the greatest public work of Robert Adam. The univer-
sity was established in 1583 by James VI (later James I of England),
and this “Old College” actually replaced an earlier campus. In the
southwest corner is the entrance to the Talbot Rice gallery (www.
trg.ed.ac.uk), which displays contemporary art. One of Robert
Louis Stevenson’s favorite saloons — Rutherford’s Bar — is on
nearby Drummond Street, and a plaque commemorating his admi-
ration for it is posted. The neighborhood also offers more recent lit-
erary history: A cafe here is reputedly where J.K. Rowling began
writing the Harry Potter series. The establishment has since
become a Chinese restaurant.
At Drummond Street, South Bridge becomes Nicolson Street.
Continue south on it to:
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 169

5. Nicolson Square
The impressive building you passed on the left (across from the
modern Festival Theatre) before arriving at this square was the
Surgeons’ Hall, designed by William Playfair in the 1830s. Nicolson
Square dates to 1756, and the buildings along its north fringe appar-
ently were the first to be built here. In the square’s park you can
see the Brassfounders’ Column, created by James Gowans in 1886.
Leave the square at the west on Marshall Street, turn left (south)
onto Potterrow, and turn right (west) at the parking lot entrance
and Crichton Street to:
6. George Square
Almost entirely redeveloped by the University of Edinburgh in the
20th century, George Square originally had uniform, if less than
startling, mid–18th-century town houses. The square predates the
city’s New Town developments, and some of the early buildings are
still standing on the western side of the square. The park provides
a quiet daytime retreat. Sir Walter Scott played in this park as a
child. (A little trivia: The square was named after the brother of the
designer James Brown, not a king.)
Exit the square at the southwest corner, turning right (west) into:
7. The Meadows
This sweeping park separates central Edinburgh from the southern
suburbs, such as Marchmont, which were largely developed in the
19th century. At the Western end is Bruntsfield Links, which some
speculate entertained golfers in the 17th century and still has a
short course with many holes available for play today.
Turn right a short distance later (at the black cycle network marker)
and follow the bike/pedestrian path, Meadow Walk, north to:
8. Teviot Place
The triangle of land formed by Teviot Place, Forrest Road, and
Bristo Place is a hotbed of university life today, with its cafes and
bars. To the right (east) is the Medical School. To the left (west) on
Lauriston Place is the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. George
Watson’s Hospital on the grounds dates to the 1740s, but Scots
baronial (a type of architecture) buildings superseded it in the 19th
century, adopting the open-plan dictates of Florence Nightingale.
Walk west on Lauriston Place to:
9. George Heriot’s School
Heriot was nicknamed “the Jinglin’ Geordie,” and as jeweler to
James VI, he exemplified the courtiers and royal hangers-on who
left Scotland and made their fortunes in London after the unifica-
tion of the crowns at the beginning of the 17th century. Heriot, at
least, decided to pay Edinburgh back by leaving more than £20,000
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
170

($37,000) to build a facility for disadvantaged boys. Of the 200-odd
windows in the Renaissance pile, only two are exactly alike. Today,
the building is a private school for boys and girls alike.
Continue on Lauriston Place to the edge of the campus and turn
right on Heriot Place. Continue down the steps and take the path,
called the Vennel, to the:
10. Grassmarket
Located just at the top of the steep steps of the Vennel is another
piece of the Flodden Wall, the southwest bastion, indicating how
the Grassmarket was enclosed in the city by the 16th century. Now
home to loads of bars and restaurants, the Grassmarket — in the
shadow of the castle — hosted a weekly market for more than 400
years. Until the 1780s, the Grassmarket also was the site of public
gallows and a place where zealous Protestants — known as the
Covenators — were hung, as was Maggie Dickson, who, according
to legend, came back to life. She at least has a pub named after her
today. At the nearby White Hart Inn, Burns and Wordsworth both
are said to have lodged.
Shopping in Edinburgh
Edinburgh may lack all of the shopping options available in Glasgow, but it
has a combination of newfangled boutiques, souvenir shops, and tradi-
tional department stores, such as the classic John Lewis. With the addition
a few years ago of the fashionista’s favorite, Harvey Nichols, Edinburgh is
certainly challenging the more style-conscious city to the west.
Goods are not inexpensive, however. Many items carry the same numeri-
cal price in pounds as they would in American dollars. So, a pair of
hiking shoes that cost $100 in New York might well be priced £100 ($185)
in Edinburgh, making them significantly more expensive.
Best shopping areas
New Town’s Princes Street is a primary shopping artery in the Scottish
capital; it’s home to leading department stores including the homegrown
Jenners and the British staple Marks & Spencer. But for the posher
shops, such as Cruise or Laura Ashley, George Street tops the lot. In
between is Rose Street, a narrow pedestrian lane that’s best known for
its pubs but is actually full of more shops.
For tourists on the hunt for more traditional souvenirs, the Royal Mile in
Old Town presents the Mother Lode, whether it’s tartan or trinkets you
seek. For small boutiques, try William Street in the West End.
Shopping hours in Edinburgh are generally only from 9 or 10 a.m. to 6
p.m., Monday through Wednesday and Friday and Saturday. Thursday is
the so-called late shopping day, with many shops opening at 9 or 10 a.m.
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 171

and remaining open to 7 or 8 p.m. Shops open Sunday from 11 a.m. or
noon and close at around 5 p.m., although smaller operations may
remain closed on Sunday.
Shopping complexes
In addition to the primary shopping districts in New Town and Old
Town, a few shopping malls with a concentration of shops are scattered
around. The newest is in Leith: Ocean Terminal (% 0131-555-8888;
www.oceanterminal.com). Debenhams, French Connection, Gap, and
other stores have set out their stalls in this retail cathedral, which gets a
lot of footfall from tourists because the royal yacht Britannia is moored
here as well.
Above Waverley train station and beneath the city’s main tourist infor-
mation center, Princes Mall (% 0131-557-3759; www.princesmall-
edinburgh.co.uk) appears to have something for everyone — except a
leading department store. About 80 shops sell fashions, accessories,
gifts, books, jewelry, and beauty products, and a food court offers the
typical fast-food outlets.
St James Centre (% 0131-557-0050; www.stjamesshopping.com) is
slightly more upscale than Princes Mall. At the top of Leith Walk near
Calton Hill, this shopping center is anchored by John Lewis’s depart-
ment store, giving the place a nice touch of respectability.
What to look for and where to find it
If your shopping intentions are less of the browsing variety, here are
some of Edinburgh’s specialized shopping options.
Antiques
 Carson Clark Gallery, a specialist in antique sea charts and maps,
is the place for a unique souvenir. One of my favorite prints is an
early-19th-century graphic depiction the origins, topography, and
length of Scotland’s major rivers. In addition to fascinating old
maps, there are also smart reproductions of historic etchings and
prints. 181 Canongate (% 0131-556-4710).
Books
 McNaughtan’s Bookshop is one of the city’s best antiquarian and
secondhand book purveyors. Consider it a must-stop for book
lovers. 3a–4a Haddington Place, at the top of Leith Walk, near
Gayfield Square (% 0131-556-5897; www.mcnaughtansbook
shop.com).
 Waterstone’s is a giant Barnes & Noble–like operation, with plenty
of stock and a lot of soft seats. It’s the most prominent book retailer
in the city center and has a good Scottish section on the ground
floor. Other branches in New Town are at the western end of Princes
Street and on George Street. 128 Princes St. (% 0131-226-2666).
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
172

Clothing/Fashion
 Arkangel is in the city’s affluent West End, which offers a host of
boutique shops. This one specializes in women’s designers and
sells brands that no other store in Scotland does. U.K. designer
duds sold here include Clara Collins and Ginka. 4 William St., 
West End (% 0131-226-4466).
 Corniche is one of the more sophisticated boutiques in Edinburgh;
if it’s the latest in Scottish fashion, expect to find it here. Offerings
have included “Anglomania kilts,” created by that controversial
lady of clothing design, Vivienne Westwood, as well as fashions by
Gautier, Katherine Hamnett, and Yamamoto. 2 Jeffrey St., near the
Royal Mile (% 0131-556-3707).
 Cruise is commonly associated with Glasgow, but this home-grown
fashion outlet began in Edinburgh’s Old Town — not generally con-
sidered fertile ground for the avant-garde. You can still find a shop
off the Royal Mile, but this New Town outlet is the focus for cou-
ture. 94 George St. (% 0131-226-3524).
 Walker Slater is a handsome shop full of well-made and contempo-
rary (if understated) men’s clothes, which are usually made of
cotton and dyed in rich, earthy hues. It also carries Mackintosh
overcoats and accessories for the smart gentleman about town. 
20 Victoria St. (% 0131-220-2636).
Crafts and jewelry
 Alistir Wood Tait is a jewelry store with a reputation for Scottish
gems and precious metals such as agates, Scottish gold, garnets,
and sapphires. Ask to see the artful depictions of Luckenbooths —
two entwined hearts capped by a royal crest, usually fashioned as
pendants. 116A Rose St. (% 0131-225-4105; www.alistirtait
gem.co.uk).
 Hamilton & Inches has sold gold and silver jewelry, porcelain and
silver, and gift items, including quaichs, since 1866. Folkloric
quaichs (drinking vessels now mostly used to give as gifts) origi-
nated in the West Highlands as whisky measures crafted from wood
or horn. They were later gentrified into something resembling
silver chafing dishes, each with a pair of lugs (ears) fashioned into
Celtic or thistle patterns. 87 George St. (% 0131-225-4898; www.
hamiltonandinches.com).
 Ness Scotland has two shops filled with whimsical accessories
scoured from around the country — from the Orkney Islands to the
Borders. Ness offers hand-loomed cardigans and tasteful scarves,
amid much more. 336 Lawnmarket. (% 0131-225-8155).
Department stores
 Harvey Nichols opened in 2002 with much celebration but was a
tad slow to catch on. Perhaps traditional shoppers were not quite
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 173

prepared for floors of expensive labels and designers such as
Jimmy Choo or Alexander McQueen. But they’re learning. 30–34 St.
Andrew Sq. (% 0131-524-8388; www.harveynichols.com).
 Jenners opened in 1838, and the shop’s neo-Gothic facade is
almost as much an Edinburgh landmark as the Scott Monument just
across Princes Street. Although controversially sold in 2005 to
House of Fraser, the store’s array of local and international mer-
chandise hasn’t changed much. It also has a food hall with a wide
array of gift-oriented Scottish products, including heather honey,
Dundee marmalade, and a vast selection of shortbreads. 48 Princes
St. (% 0870-607-2841).
 John Lewis is the largest department store in Scotland, and this
branch is many people’s first choice when it comes to shopping for
clothes, appliances, furniture, toys, and more. St. James Centre,
near Picardy Place, at the top of Leith Walk (% 0131-556-9121).
Edibles
See the sidebar “Picnic fare,” earlier in this chapter, for select food mar-
kets with Scottish specialties.
Gifts
 Geraldine’s of Edinburgh is also known as the “Doll Hospital.”
Each of the heirloom-quality dolls here requires days of labor to
create, and has a hand-painted porcelain head and sometimes an
elaborate coiffure. Also available are fully jointed, all-mohair teddy
bears. 133–135 Canongate (% 0131-556-4295).
 Tartan Gift Shops has a chart indicating the place of origin (in
Scotland) of family names, accompanied by a bewildering array of
hunt and dress tartans for men and women, all sold by the yard.
The shop also carries a line of lambswool and cashmere sweaters.
54 High St. (% 0131-558-3187).
Hats, knits, and woolens
 Bill Baber is a workshop/store that turns out artfully modernized
adaptations of traditional Scottish patterns for both men and
women. Expect to find traditional knits spiced up with strands of
Caribbean-inspired turquoise or aqua or rugged-looking blazers or
sweaters suitable for treks or bike rides through the moors. 66
Grassmarket (% 0131-225-3249; www.billbaber.com).
 Edinburgh Woollen Mill Shop is one of several in the capital, and of
about 280 outlet shops throughout the United Kingdom, that sell
practical Scottish woolens, knitwear, skirts, gifts, and travel rugs.
Note: Despite the name of the shop, most of the merchandise is made
in England. 139 Princes St. (% 0131-226-3840; www.ewm.co.uk).
 Fabhatrix has hundreds of handmade felt hats and caps, many practi-
cal as well as attractive and some downright frivolous but extremely
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
174

fun. Remember: Keep your head warm and your whole body stays
warm. 13 Cowgatehead, near Grassmarket (% 0131-225-9222).
 Ragamuffin sells what’s termed “wearable art,” created by some
150 designers from all over the U.K. The apparel here is one-of-a-
kind. Well, not exactly — Ragamuffin also has a shop way up north
on the Isle of Skye. 276 Canongate, Royal Mile (% 0131-557-6007;
www.ragamuffinonline.co.uk).
Music
 Avalanche usually has a bunch of harmless goth kids hanging out
in front of it. You can find this branch of the excellent CD shop
where the steep steps of the Fleshmarket close meet Cockburn
Street. It’s best for new releases of indie bands. Another Avalanche
shop is on West Nicolson Street. 60 Cockburn St., near the Royal
Mile (% 0131-225-3939).
 Fopp effectively went bust, but some of its branches were
reprieved and now sell, among other items, discount DVDs, 
books, and indie, rock, pop, jazz, and dance CDs. 7–15 Rose St. 
(% 0131-220-0310).
Tartans and kilts
 Anta sells some of the most stylish tartans. Woolen blankets with
hand-purled fringe are woven here on old-style looms. Crocket’s
Land, 91–93 West Bow (% 0131-225-4616).
 Geoffrey (Tailor) Kiltmakers has a list of customers that includes
Sean Connery, Dr. Ruth Westheimer, members of Scotland’s rugby
teams, and Mel Gibson. It stocks 200 of Scotland’s best-known
tartan patterns and is revolutionizing the kilt by establishing a sub-
sidiary called 21st-Century Kilts, which makes them in fabrics rang-
ing from denim to leather. 57–59 High St. (% 0131-557-0256).
 Hector Russell, a well-known kiltmakers shop on the Royal Mile,
creates bespoke — that’s made-to-order — clothes made from tar-
tans. Another branch is located on Princes Street. 137–141 High St.
(% 0131-558-1254).
 James Pringle Weavers produces a large variety of wool items,
including cashmere sweaters, tartan and tweed ties, travel rugs,
tweed hats, and tam o’ shanters. In addition, it boasts a clan ances-
try center with a database containing more than 50,000 family
names. 70–74 Bangor Rd., Leith (% 0131-553-5161).
Whisky
 Royal Mile Whiskies stock some 1,000 different whiskies from
Scotland and other nations. Prices range from around £20 to £900
($37–$1,665). Staff know their stuff, so tell them what you prefer
(for example, smoky, peaty, sweet, and so on) and they find a bottle
to please you. 379 High St. (% 0131-622-6255).
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 175

Living It Up after Dark
Every summer, Edinburgh becomes the cultural capital of Europe and
the envy of every other tourist board in the U.K. when it hosts the
International Festival, Festival Fringe, Book Festival, Film Festival, and
Jazz Festival. Together these festivals bring in thousands of visitors to
see hundreds of world-class acts — in drama, dance, music, comedy,
and more. In August, the Scottish capital becomes a proverbial “city that
never sleeps.”
Although the yearly festivals (www.edinburghfestivals.co.uk) are no
doubt the peak of Edinburgh’s social calendar, the city offers a pretty
good selection of entertainment choices throughout the year. Visitors
can busy themselves with the cinema, clubs, theater, opera, ballet, and
other diversions such as a night at the pub.
For a complete rundown of what’s happening in Edinburgh, pick up a
copy of The List, a biweekly magazine available at all major newsstands
and bookshops. It previews, reviews, and gives the full details of arts
events here — and in Glasgow.
The performing arts
The West End is the cradle of theater and music, home to the legendary
and innovative Traverse Theatre as well as the Royal Lyceum Theatre
and the classic Usher Hall for concerts.
 Edinburgh Festival Theatre reopened in 1994, after serious renova-
tions, in time for the Edinburgh Festival (hence the name). Located
on the south side of the city, about a ten-minute walk from the
Royal Mile and right near the University of Edinburgh’s Old
Campus, the 1,900-seat theater hosts the national opera and ballet,
touring companies, and orchestras. Tickets are £5 to £45 ($9.25–
$83). 13–29 Nicolson St. (% 0131-529-6000 box office; 0131-662-
1112 administration; www.eft.co.uk; Bus: 5, 7, 8, or 29).
 Edinburgh Playhouse is best known for hosting popular plays or
musicals and other mainstream acts when they come to town,
whether it’s Miss Saigon or Lord of the Dance. Formerly a cinema, 
the playhouse is the largest theater in Great Britain, with more than
3,000 seats. Tickets are £8 to £35 ($15–$65). 18–22 Greenside Place
(% 0131-524-3333; www.edinburgh-playhouse.co.uk; Bus: 5 
or 22).
 Kings Theatre is a 1,300-seat late-Victoria-era venue with a dome
ceiling and rather Glasgow-style stained-glass doors and red-stone
frontage. Located on the edge of Tollcross, southwest of the castle,
it offers a wide repertoire, especially traveling West End produc-
tions, productions of the Scottish National Theatre, and other 
classical entertainment, ballet, and opera. During December 
and January, it’s the premier theater for popular pantomime 
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
176

productions in Edinburgh. Tickets range from £5 to £20 ($9.25–$37).
2 Leven St. (% 0131-529-6000; www.eft.co.uk; Bus: 11, 15, or 17).
 Royal Lyceum Theatre (built in 1883) has a most enviable reputa-
tion, with presentations that range from the most famous works of
Shakespeare to new Scottish playwrights. It’s home to the leading
theater production company in the city, often hiring the best
Scottish actors, such as Brian Cox, Billy Boyd (Lord of the Rings), and
Siobhan Redmond — when they’re not preoccupied with Hollywood,
that is. Grindlay Street (% 0131-248-4848 box office; 0131-238-4800
general inquiries; www.lyceum.org; Bus: 1, 10, 15, or 34).
 Traverse Theatre is just around the corner from the Royal Lyceum
and is something of a local legend. Beginning in the 1960s as an
experimental theater company that doubled as a bohemian social
club, it still produces the height of contemporary drama in
Scotland. This custom-made subterranean complex actually con-
tains two theaters, seating 100 and 250, respectively, on the
benches. Upstairs, the Traverse Bar is where you find the hippest
dramatists, actors, and their courtiers. Tickets are £4 to £14
($7.40–$26). 10 Cambridge St. (% 0131-228-1404; www.traverse.
co.uk; Bus: 11 or 15).
 Usher Hall is unbeatable when it comes to concerts. Built in the
1890s, thanks to the bequest of distiller Andrew Usher, this Beaux
Arts building is Edinburgh’s equivalent of Carnegie Hall. During the
International Festival, it hosts such ensembles as the Cleveland or
London Philharmonic orchestras. But Usher Hall isn’t only a venue
for classical music: Top touring jazz, world music, and pop acts
play here throughout the year. Tickets are £8 to £50 ($15–$92).
Lothian Road (% 0131-228-1155; www.usherhall.co.uk; Bus: 1,
10, 15, or 34).
Comedy
Given the importance of the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where the
vaunted Perrier Award for comedy can launch a career, the stand-up
comedian is . . . err, taken very seriously in the Scottish capital.
 Jongleurs Comedy Club is a corporate-owned entity from down
south with more than a dozen venues across the U.K. Jongleurs
came to Scotland a few years back, dragging along its own cadre of
house funnymen (and funnywomen) as well as some touring come-
dians from overseas. Tickets are £4 to £15 ($7.40–$28). Omni
Centre, Greenside Place (% 0870-787-0707; www.jongleurs.com;
Bus: 7 or 22).
 The Stand, just down the hill from St. Andrew Square, is the premier
local comedy venue. Big acts are reserved for weekend nights, while
local talent try their jokes and tales during the week. On Sundays,
no admission is charged for brunch performances. Tickets range
from £1 to £8 ($1.85–$15). 5 York Place (% 0131-558-7272; www.
thestand.co.uk; Bus: 8 or 17).
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 177

Dance clubs
Clubbing isn’t quite as popular now as it was in the 1980s and 1990s, but
it probably still draws more people than the folk, jazz, and classical
music scenes combined. Below is just a sampling of clubs in Edinburgh.
 Bongo Club offers a varied music policy throughout the week —
funk, dub, and experimental. This venue has more reasonably
priced drinks than many others. The cover charge can be up to £8
($15). The club is open daily from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. Moray House,
37 Holyrood Rd. (% 0131-558-7604; www.thebongoclub.co.uk;
Bus: 35).
 Po Na Na is a branch of a successful chain of clubs in Great Britain.
The theme is a Moroccan Casbah with décor to match, thanks to
wall mosaics, brass lanterns, and artifacts shipped in from
Marrakech. The dance mix varies from hip hop and funk to disco
and sounds of the ’80s. The cover can be up to £5 ($9.25). Po Na Na
is open daily until 3 a.m. 43B Frederick St. (% 0131-226-2224;
www.ponana.co.uk; Bus: 80).
Folk music
Although touring folk acts — American performers like Gillian Welch are
pretty huge in Scotland — get booked into the larger music halls, the day-
to-day folk scene in Edinburgh takes place in unassuming public houses.
 The Royal Oak is where Old Town meets the Southside, just a few
minutes’ walk from the Royal Mile off South Bridge. The pub is the
home of live Scottish folk music. On Sundays from 8:30 p.m. on, 
various guests play at the “Wee Folk Club.” Tickets are £3 ($5.55).
The Royal Oak is open daily until 2 a.m. 1 Infirmary St. (% 0131-
557-2967; Bus: 3, 5, 8, or 29).
 Sandy Bell’s offers live folk or traditional music virtually every
night from about 9 p.m. and all day Saturday and Sunday. This small
pub near the Museum of Scotland is a landmark for Scottish and
Gaelic culture. Sandy Bell’s is open Monday through Saturday from
11:30 a.m. to 1 a.m. and Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. 25 Forrest Rd.
(% 0131-225-2751; Bus: 2 or 42).
Rock, pop, and jazz
Although it’s not listed here, the very big acts — whether Bob Dylan,
R.E.M., or the Rolling Stones, for example — are likely to play outdoors
at the national rugby facility, Murrayfield Stadium.
 Corn Exchange is a bit of a haul out of the city center. But this
venue was meant to compete with the likes of Glasgow’s infamous
Barrowland ballroom, where touring groups absolutely love to
appear. The comparison isn’t really fair, but the Corn Exchange isn’t
a bad medium-to-small-size hall (capacity 3,000) to see rock acts. 11
New Market Rd. (% 0131-477-3500; www.ece.uk.com; Bus: 4 or 28).

 The Liquid Room has space for fewer than 1,000 people. This is
Edinburgh’s best venue for catching the sweat off the brows of
groups; it’s also a busy dance club when not hosting such groups.
9c Victoria St. (% 0131-225-2564; www.liquidroom.com; Bus: 35).
Bars and pubs
The most active areas for pubs and clubs are the Cowgate and
Grassmarket in Old Town and Broughton Street in New Town, although
the university precincts on the Southside are lively, as are the pubs near
The Shore in the Port of Leith. Unless otherwise noted, the bars and
pubs listed below are generally open Sunday through Thursday from 11
a.m. or noon until 11 p.m. or midnight, often closing at 1 or 2 a.m. on
Friday and Saturday nights.
 The Abbotsford’s bartenders have been pouring pints since around
1900. (Not the same bartenders, mind you.) The gaslight era is still
alive here thanks to the preservation of the dark paneling and
ornate plaster ceiling. The ales on tap change about once a week,
and you can find a good selection of single-malt whiskies, too.
Platters of food are dispensed from the bar Monday through
Saturday from noon to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 10 p.m. 3 Rose St. 
(% 0131-225-5276; Bus: 3, 28, or 45).
 Black Bo’s is a stone’s throw from the Royal Mile. Many visitors
may find its dark walls and mix-and-match furniture downright
plain, but I think it has a rather unforced hipness. And due to its
proximity to the hostels of Blackfriars Street, Black Bo’s often hosts
chatty groups of young foreigners enjoying a pint or two. DJs play
from Wednesday to Saturday; downstairs is a pool room with a juke
box. The bar doesn’t serve food, but its mostly vegetarian restau-
rant next door does. 57 Blackfriars St. (% 0131-557-6136; Bus: 35).
 Bow Bar, located just below Edinburgh Castle, is a classic Edinburgh
pub that appears little changed by time or tampered with by foolish
trends. Surprise: It’s only a few more than a dozen years old. Never
mind that, though. The pub looks the part of a classic and features
some eight cask-conditioned ales, which change regularly. The
Scottish brewed options may include the dark and smooth Lia Fail
(Gaelic for “Stone of Destiny,” the rock on which Scottish kings were
enthroned), from the Perthshire-based Inveralmond Brewery. No
food is served. 80 West Bow (% 0131-226-7667; Bus: 2 or 35).
 Café Royal Circle Bar is a well-preserved Victorian-era pub.
Spacious booths, combined with plenty of room around the island
bar, create a comfortable and stylish place to drink. Above-average
food from the same kitchen as the neighboring oyster bar/restaurant
is served daily. 17 W. Register St. (% 0131-556-1884; Bus: 8 or 13).
 Opal Lounge, in New Town, is an excellent example of the so-called
modern-style bar. After opening in 2001, it became the haunt of
Prince William when the handsome heir to the British throne
Chapter 11: Edinburgh 179

attended St. Andrew’s University. Opal Lounge draws a predomi-
nantly young, well-dressed, and affluent crowd, combining a long list
of cocktails with a cavernous underground space. Drinks are served
daily from noon to 3 a.m.; food of an Asian-fusion nature is served
daily from noon to 10 p.m. 51a George St. (% 0131-226-2275; Bus:
24, 29, or 42).
 The Outhouse is one of the more contemporary outfits on or near
busy Broughton Street. The bar was renovated in 2003 with rich
brown hues. During good weather spells, a beer garden out back
offers an excellent open-air retreat, and some outdoor heaters help
take the chill off the night. 14 Broughton Street Lane (% 0131-
557-6688; Bus: 8 or 17).
 The Shore, down in Leith, fits seamlessly into the seaside port ambi-
ence without resorting to a lot of the usual decorations of cork and
netting. The place is small, but on nice days they put a few seats out
front to soak in the afternoon sun. On three nights of the week, you
can find live folk and jazz music. Food is served from noon to 2:30
p.m. and 6:30 to 10 p.m. 3–4 The Shore (% 0131-553-5080; Bus: 16 
or 36).
Going to the cinema
 The Filmhouse, the capital’s most important cinema, is the focus of
the Edinburgh Film Festival — one of the oldest annual film festi-
vals in the world. The movies shown here are foreign and art
house, classic and experimental, documentary and shorts. Plus, the
Filmhouse hosts discussions and lectures with directors during the
Festival and at other points throughout the year. The cafe/bar does
drinks, serves light meals, and remains open late. Consider this a
must-stop for any visiting film buffs. Tickets range from £1.50 to
£6.50 ($2.50–$12). 88 Lothian Rd. (% 0131-228-2688; www.film
housecinema.com; Bus: 10, 22, or 30).

Late-night eats
Okay, its Friday or Saturday night. You’ve been out to a play, pub, or a dance club, 
and now you’re utterly starving. But it’s sometime between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. (you’re
not exactly sure because your watch seems to be keeping Australian time at the
moment). Food will help you get back on track. If you’re in the West End, Lothian Road
is your best bet. Try Lazio, 95 Lothian Rd. (% 0131-229-7788), for a bit of pizza or pasta.
It’s open until midnight during the week and until 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights
(technically, that’s Sat and Sun mornings). For something a bit more modern and trendy,
Favorit is a NYC-style diner on Teviot Place (% 0131-220-6880) that stays open until 
3 a.m. daily.

 Vue Edinburgh is a big glass-fronted multiplex below Calton Hill, at
the roundabout near the top of Leith Walk. It offers first-run, big
commercial releases. Tickets are £6 ($11). Omni Centre, Greenside
Place (% 0871-224-0240; www.myvue.com; Bus: 7 or 22).

It’s open Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and
Friday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. On
Wednesday, the hours are 9:30 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. and on Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Business Hours
In Edinburgh, banks are usually open
Monday through Friday from 9 or 9:30 a.m.
to 4 or 5 p.m., with some branches some-
times shutting early one day a week and
opening late on another. Shops are gener-
ally open Monday through Saturday from 9

stores are open late, usually until about 8
p.m. Many shops are now open on Sunday
as well. In general, business hours are
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m., although some offices will close early
on Friday. Food supermarkets generally
keep later hours.
Currency Exchange
Many banks in Old Town and New Town
exchange currency. Post offices run
bureaux de change, as does the Edinburgh
Information Office (% 0131-473-3800).
Major hotels also exchange currency but
charge a premium for the service. ATMs in
the city center are linked to major banking
systems such as Cirrus and Plus, so you are
almost definitely able to draw money
directly from your bank account at home.
Dentists
If you have a dental emergency, go to the
Edinburgh Dental Institute, 39 Lauriston
Place (% 0131-536-4900; Bus: 35), open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
Alternatively, call the National Health
Service Helpline (% 0800-224-488).
Doctors
You can seek help from the Edinburgh Royal
Infirmary, 1 Lauriston Place (% 0131-
536-1000; Bus: 35). The emergency depart-
ment is open 24 hours.

terminals. You can get online here for as
little as 50p (95¢), although some shops
require £1 coins.

Laundry/Dry Cleaning
For your dry-cleaning needs, the most cen-
tral service is probably at Johnson’s

225-8095; Bus: 13, 19, or 42), which is open
Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5:30
p.m. and Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Luggage Storage/Lockers
Generally speaking, you can store luggage
in lockers at Waverley Station or with your
hotel.
Newspapers
Published since 1817, the Scotsman is a
quality daily newspaper with a national and
international perspective, while its sister
publication, the Evening News, concen-
trates more on local affairs. For compre-
hensive arts and entertainment listings and
reviews of local shows, buy The List maga-
zine, which is published every other
Thursday and weekly during the Festival.
Metro, a free daily (Mon–Fri) available on
buses and in train stations, also gives list-
ings of daily events.
Pharmacies
There are no 24-hour drugstores (called
chemists) in Edinburgh. The one with proba-
bly the longest hours is the branch of Boots
at 48 Shandwick Place, west of Princes
Street (% 0131-225-6757; Bus: 12 or 25). It’s
open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 8
p.m., Saturday from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and
Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Post Office
The Edinburgh Branch Post Office, St.
James Centre, is open Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. For gen-
eral postal information and customer serv-
ice, call % 0845-722-3344.
Restrooms
These are found at rail stations, terminals,
restaurants, hotels, pubs, and department
stores. A system of public toilets, often
marked WC, is in place at strategic corners
and squares throughout the city. They’re
safe and clean but likely to be closed late in
the evening.
Safety
Edinburgh is generally one of Europe’s
safest capitals. But that doesn’t mean
crimes, especially muggings, don’t occur.
They do, largely because of Edinburgh’s
problems with drug abuse.

G
lasgow is only about 74km (46 miles) west of Scotland’s capital,
Edinburgh, but there’s a noticeable contrast between the two
cities. Glasgow (pronounced glaaz-go by natives) doesn’t offer the fairy-
tale setting of the Scottish capital, but compensates with a lively culture,
big-city feel, and gregarious locals.
Glasgow’s origins are actually quite ancient, making Edinburgh seem
comparatively young. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence of
Roman settlements in the city. In the 6th century, some 500 years before
the first foundations of Edinburgh Castle were set, St. Kentigern (or St.
Mungo) is believed to have begun a monastery at the site of Glasgow
Cathedral, on a hillside along a burn (creek) that feeds into the River
Clyde. The site is a logical one for settlement because it allows conven-
ient access to ford the mighty River Clyde before it widens on its way to
the sea, some 32km (20 miles) away to the west.
However, aside from the Cathedral itself, practically none of this
medieval ecclesiastical center (which included a university) remains,
and much of Glasgow’s historical records (kept at the Cathedral) were
lost during the Protestant Reformation. The city became the country’s
economic powerhouse in the 18th century. Glasgow quickly grew into
Scotland’s largest city (it is the fourth most populous in the entire U.K.).
The boom began in earnest with the tobacco trade to the New World, in
which Glasgow outpaced rivals such as London and Bristol largely due
to faster sailing times to the New World.
The city then became famous worldwide for shipbuilding, with docks
that produced the Queen Mary, Queen Elizabeth, and other fabled 
ocean liners. It was, for a while, the Second City of the Empire. But 
post-industrial decline gave Glasgow a poor reputation as a city of
slums, particularly in contrast to the enduring charms of Edinburgh.

Internationally, the city may even now struggle to convince those who
saw Glasgow in the 1970s or early 80s that it’s become a safe, vibrant,
and cosmopolitan city.
Throughout the 1980s, Glasgow reversed its fortune by becoming
Scotland’s contemporary cultural capital, drawing talent from across 
the U.K., whether in visual art or rock ’n’ roll. Decades of grime were
sandblasted away from its monumental Victorian buildings and visitors
began to recognize that the city had one of Europe’s best municipally
owned collections of art in the Burrell Collection and Kelvingrove Art
Gallery. In 1990, the city was deemed the European Capital of Culture (a
prestigious honor awarded by the European Council of Ministers), thus
certifying the changes that had occurred.
Glasgow is not a city without flaws, however. Serious pockets of poverty
remain in its peripheral housing projects (called estates or schemes). A
major motorway cuts a scar through the center of town (and another
intrusive freeway is being built). Although the splendor of what architec-
tural critics have hailed as “the greatest surviving example of a Victorian
city” remains, Glasgow still seems to prefer knocking historic buildings
down and erecting new structures of dubious merit.
Glasgow is a good gateway for exploring Burns Country in Ayrshire to
the southwest. From the city, you can also tour Loch Lomond and see
some of the Highlands, and you’re less than an hour away from Stirling
and the Trossach mountains. Also on Glasgow’s doorstep is the scenic
estuary of the Firth of Clyde, with islands only a short ride and ferry sail-
ing away. For details on those regions within striking distance from
Glasgow, see the chapters in Part IV, “The Major Regions.”
Getting to Glasgow
Most flights into Glasgow International Airport from North America con-
nect via London, but some airlines offer direct service. If you’re traveling
up from London, you can easily take the cross-country train to Glasgow
or fly to the airport. If you’re coming from elsewhere in Scotland, high-
way, train, and bus routes arrive from all directions. The city’s two cen-
tral bus stations (Central and Queen Street) are a couple of blocks from
George Square, in the heart of the town, thus the two main train stations
are within walking distance of each other. Figuring out the best way to
come into Glasgow is easy — it all depends on the time you have and the
flexibility you desire.
By air
Glasgow International Airport (% 0870-040-0008 or 0141-887-1111;
www.glasgowairport.com) is located at Abbotsinch, near Paisley, only
about 16km (10 miles) west of Glasgow via M8. Monday through Friday,
British Airways runs an almost hourly shuttle service between London’s
Heathrow Airport and Glasgow. The first flight departs London at 7:15 a.m.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
184

and the last flight leaves at 9:15 p.m.; service is reduced on weekends,
depending on volume. For flight schedules and fares, call British Airways
in London at % 0870-551-1155, or log on to www.ba.com, which offers a
slight discount on ticket prices.
The schedule of direct flights from North America to Glasgow is subject
to change. In recent years, Continental (% 800-523-3273 in the U.S.;
www.continental.com) has offered direct service out of Newark
International, while US Airways (% 800-622-1015; www.usairways.
com) has operated flights between Glasgow and Philadelphia for at least
half of the year.
BMI (formerly British Midland; % 0870-607-0555; www.flybmi.com)
offers internal U.K. flights and flights to European hubs. Aer Lingus
(% 800-223-6537, or % 0845-084-4444 at Dublin Airport; www.aer
lingus.ie) flies daily from Dublin to Glasgow.
South of Glasgow is Prestwick International Airport (% 0871-223-
0700), which is favored by some of the low-budget airlines, such as
RyanAir (% 0871-246-0000; www.ryanair.com). Prestwick is on the
railway line to Ayr, about a 45-minute ride from Glasgow’s Central
Station. Remember also that Edinburgh International Airport is less
than 74km (46 miles) away.
Orienting yourself
Glasgow airport is fairly small and therefore presents scant opportuni-
ties for getting lost. Immigration control and customs agents are vigilant,
but the scene is quite a bit more relaxed than at giant air terminals such
as London’s Heathrow. Usually there is just one line (called a queue) for
visitors from outside the European Union. Arrivals with E.U. passports
can generally breeze right through.
Getting into town from the airport
Regular GlasgowFlyer bus service (route no. 500; www.glasgowflyer.
co.uk) runs frequently between the airport and the city center, termi-
nating at the Buchanan Street Bus Station. The ride takes only about 20
minutes (though it can be much longer during rush hour) and it costs
£4.25 ($8) for a one-way (single) ticket. A taxi to the city center costs
about £17 ($31).
By train
Trains from London arrive in Glasgow at Central Station in the heart of
the city (for rail and fare information, contact National Rail Enquiries;
% 08457-48-49-50; www.nationalrail.co.uk). The trains that directly
link London and Glasgow (via Preston and Carlisle) on the so-called West
Coast Main Line don’t have the same reputation for timeliness and effi-
ciency as those going to Edinburgh. However, the semiprivatized com-
pany responsible for railway maintenance, Network Rail, is spending
literally billions of pounds to upgrade the line and create a faster service.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 185

But work has been slow, and while it’s ongoing, travel is subject to delay
on occasion. The trains (operated by Virgin; % 08457-222-333; www.
virgin.com/trains) on the West Coast Main Line depart from London’s
Euston Station every hour or so and the trip to Glasgow generally takes
51⁄2 hours.
If you plan a trip on the West Coast Main Line, call and find out if any
major “track works” are scheduled during your journey. If so, you can
expect delays and the possibility of riding on a bus for a portion of 
the trip.
Virgin prices, similar to all the U.K.’s train-operating companies, are
varied and complicated. In general, you might get a one-way ticket for 
as little as £20 ($37), although the standard advance-purchase ticket is
more likely to be between £90 and £100 ($167–$185).
You may prefer trains from London’s Kings Cross station up the East
Coast Main Line via Newcastle to Edinburgh; then via Motherwell to
Glasgow. The trip takes about the same amount of time as one on the
West Coast Main Line. Glasgow’s Central Station is also the terminus for
trains from the southwest of Scotland and a hub for numerous trains to
city suburbs in most directions.
A ten-minute walk away (or via bus no. 398) is Queen Street Station.
From here, the ScotRail shuttle service to and from Edinburgh runs
every 15 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes in the evenings
until about 11:30 p.m. The round-trip fare during off-peak times (travel
from 9:15 a.m.–4:30 p.m. and after 6:30 p.m.) is about £9 ($17), and the
trip takes about 50 minutes.
Trains to the north (Stirling, Aberdeen, and such Highland destinations
as Oban, Inverness, and Fort William), as well as to Glasgow’s suburbs,
also run frequently through Queen Street Station. By the way, after
London, Glasgow has the biggest commuter rail network in Great Britain.
By bus
The journey from London to Glasgow by bus can take at least eight
hours. The operators of the buses seem to exchange routes every
couple of years, and so it can be confusing. As of this writing, a new serv-
ice run by Megabus (www.megabus.com) is offering the best deal, with
one-way fares as low as £12 ($22). Buses depart London’s Victoria Coach
Station to Glasgow’s Buchanan Street Bus Station (% 0870-608-2608),
about 2 blocks north of the Queen Street Station on North Hanover
Street. Scottish CityLink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk) also
has frequent bus service to and from Edinburgh.
By car
Glasgow is about 347km (216 miles) north of Manchester, and some
650km (405 miles) north of London. Motorways link London to Glasgow.
From England and the south, Glasgow is reached by the M1 or M5 to the
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
186

M6 in the Midlands, which becomes the M74 at Carlisle. The M74 runs
north to Glasgow.
Other routes into the city are the M8 from Edinburgh, the M77 (A77)
from Ayr and the A8 from the west (this becomes the M8 around the
town of Port Glasgow). The A82 comes into the city from the northwest
(the Western Highlands) on the north bank of the Clyde, and the A80
also goes into the city. (This route is the southwestern section of the
M80 and the M9 from Stirling.)
Orienting Yourself in Glasgow
Glasgow is a vibrant modern city with offices, shops, art galleries, thea-
ters, multiplex cinemas, and music halls — not to mention hundreds of
bars and restaurants. The monumental heart of Glasgow lies north of the
River Clyde. This central area is divided between the larger and mostly
Victorian Commercial Centre and the more compact district now desig-
nated the Merchant City (in honor of the tobacco and cotton “lords”
who lived and ran businesses there from the 1700s). The Merchant City
is (roughly) to Glasgow as SoHo is to Manhattan: full of warehouses con-
verted to condos, stylish bars, and trendy restaurants. The City Centre
offers loads of shopping opportunities on the predominantly pedestrian-
only stretches of Argyle, Buchanan, and Sauchiehall streets. If the river
creates a southern boundary for “downtown” Glasgow, then the M8
motorway creates both its western and northern limits. The eastern
boundary is set by High Street; while now on the fringes of the city
center, this boulevard was historically at the core of old Glasgow.
Virtually all evidence of Glasgow’s medieval existence was demolished by
the well-meaning — if history-destroying — urban-renewal schemes of
late Georgian and Victorian Glasgow. Practically nothing remains to give
any idea of how the city looked before the 18th-century boom, which is a
shame because, by some accounts, it was once one of Europe’s most
attractive medieval burghs. Still standing on the hill at the top of the High
Street, however, is Glasgow Cathedral, an excellent example of pre-
Reformation Gothic architecture that dates in part to the 12th century.
Across the square is Provand’s Lordship, the city’s oldest surviving
house, built in the 1470s. Down High Street you find the Tolbooth Steeple
(circa 1626) at Glasgow Cross, and nearer the River Clyde is Glasgow
Green, one of Britain’s first large-scale public parks. Glasgow reputedly
has more green space per resident than any other European city.
Across town, the city’s salubrious and leafy West End is home to the
University of Glasgow, Kelvingrove Park, and the terraces of Woodlands
Hill, rising to Park Circus, which afford excellent views. In the park is a
red sandstone palace, the city’s Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
(refurbished and re-opened to mass popular appeal in 2006). Nearby, the
tower of Glasgow University dominates Gilmorehill. The district’s main
street is Byres Road, the social and entertainment destination in the
West End, full of restaurants, cafes, bars, and shops.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 187

The city’s Southside sprawls from the River Clyde and is largely residen-
tial. A little more than 5km (3 miles) southwest of Glasgow’s center in
wooded Pollok Country Park is the vaunted Burrell Collection. This
museum of antiquity and art has become one of the city’s top tourist
attractions. The commercial heart of the Southside is Shawlands, which
offers an increasing number of good restaurants; nearby Queens Park is
a hilly classic of Victorian planning.
Glasgow’s East End is only slowly redeveloping after its industrial heyday
when tons and tons of steel were manufactured. It’s the least affluent dis-
trict in Glasgow and, according to surveys, is one of the poorest and least
healthy areas in all of Europe. But statistics don’t tell the entire story.
Visitors to the East End’s Gallowgate on the weekend should see the 
flea-market stalls of the Barras. And East End neighborhoods such as
Dennistoun are gradually drawing young, creative types who can no
longer afford apartments in the West End or the Southside — a renais-
sance is simmering.
Introducing the neighborhoods
Glasgow is composed of a variety of neighborhoods and districts, from
the compact urban area of the Merchant City to the inner-suburban and
University of Glasgow–dominated area called Hillhead.
City Centre
Cathedral (Townhead)
St. Mungo apparently arrived here in A.D. 543 and built his little church in
what’s now the northeastern part of the city’s center. Glasgow Cathedral
(aka St. Kentigern’s or St. Mungo’s) was at one time surrounded by a vari-
ety of buildings: prebendal manses and the long-destroyed Bishops Castle,
which stood between the cathedral’s west facade and the Provand’s
Lordship, which still exists in largely its original form. East of the
Cathedral is one of Britain’s largest Victorian cemeteries, Glasgow’s
Central Necropolis.
Merchant City
The city’s first New Town development lies southeast of the city’s
modern core. The so-called Merchant City extends from Trongate and
Argyle Street in the south to George Street in the north. Because the
medieval closes off the High Street were regarded as festering sores, the
affluent moved to newly developed areas to the west. Now, Merchant
City is one of few inner-city areas of Glasgow in which people reside.
Gallowgate
One of the streets that prosperous city businessmen once strolled, the
Gallowgate is today the beginning of the city’s East End. The Saracen’s
Head Inn stood here and took in such distinguished guests as Dr. Samuel
Johnson and James Boswell in 1774 after the duo’s famous tour of the
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
188

Hebrides. Today, the Gallowgate is best known for the Barras Market
and Barrowland, a one-time ballroom that’s now a popular live-music
venue.
Saltmarket
The first settlements in Glasgow were on the hill by the Cathedral, but
existing almost as early were dwellings in this area at the opposite end
of High Street, along the banks of the Clyde. The Saltmarket served as
the trading post where the river could be forded. The street named the
Bridgegate (brig-it) leads to the first crossing erected over the Clyde.
Today Victoria Bridge crosses the river at the same spot. Constructed in
the 1850s, it is the oldest bridge in Glasgow.
Commercial Centre
The biggest of the central districts of Glasgow, the city’s Commercial
Centre includes areas of 19th-century development, such as Blythswood
and Charing Cross (although the latter was severed from the city by the
M8 freeway). This area offers Victorian architecture at its finest. Luckily,
even though the city had a mind to tear it all to the ground in the mid- to
late 1960s, city leaders realized that it had something of real interna-
tional interest and preserved the area instead.
Broomielaw
It has been said that “the Clyde made Glasgow.” From docks here in
Broomielaw, Glasgow imported tobacco, cotton, and rum and shipped
its manufactured goods around the world. After becoming a rather lost
and neglected part of the city, Broomielaw today is targeted for renewal,
with luxury flats planned along the riverbank.
Garnethill
Up the steep slopes north of Sauchiehall Street, this neighborhood is
best known for the Charles Rennie Mackintosh–designed Glasgow
School of Art. Developed in the late 1800s, Garnethill offers good views
of the city and is also home to the first proper synagogue built in
Scotland.
West End
Woodlands
Centering on Park Circus at the crown of Woodlands Hill, this neighbor-
hood is the first one just west of the M8 freeway. It is a mix of residential
tenements and retail stretches, particularly on Woodland and Great
Western roads. South to the river lies the district of Finnieston, and its
most visible landmark is the old shipbuilding crane that stands like
some giant dinosaur. Along the Clyde is the Scottish Exhibition Centre.
West of Woodlands is Kelvingrove, with its art gallery, museum, and
impressive park.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 189

Hillhead
With the Gilmorehill campus of the University of Glasgow, Hillhead is
rather dominated by academia. Its main boulevard is Byres Road, which
is the High Street of the West End. In addition to the university, two
other major institutions reside in Hillhead: BBC Scotland, on Queen
Margaret Drive, and NHS Western Infirmary, next to the University.
Partick
The railway station at Partick is one of the few in the city to translate the
stop’s name into Gaelic: Partaig. Indeed, the neighborhood has a bit of
Highland pride, although there’s no particular evidence that Highland
people have settled here in great masses. Partick is one of the less pre-
tentious districts of the central West End. To the north are leafy and
affluent Hyndland and Dowanhill.
Southside
Gorbals
If one area seems to represent the slums of early-20th-century Glasgow,
it’s Gorbals. This neighborhood, just across the Clyde from the city’s
center, developed a rather notorious reputation for mean streets and
unsanitary tenements. As such, the city demolished Gorbals in the early
1960s and erected sets of modern, high apartment towers, which in turn
developed a reputation for unsavory and unpleasant conditions. I per-
sonally wish that some of the old Gorbals still stood. Today, the towers
are coming down and the New Gorbals has been developed on a more
human scale, although the fabric of the place still seems torn and frayed.
One good thing is that it’s home to the Citizens’ Theatre, one of the
most innovative and democratic in the U.K.
Govan
Govan was settled as early as the 10th century, making it another eccle-
siastical focal point along with the medieval cathedral north of the river.
Until 1912, it was an independent burgh and was one of the key ship-
building districts on the south banks of the Clyde. One of the first major
shipyards in the neighborhood, Mackie & Thomson, opened in 1840. But
with the demise of shipbuilding, the fortunes of Govan fell, too. Today,
the Science Centre and other developments in the area (such as a
planned new Transport Museum) are hoped to revive Govan’s fortunes.
Pollokshaws
Along with Pollokshields and Crosshill, these neighborhoods form the
heart of the city’s more modern Southside suburbs. Pollok Park and the
Burrell Collection are the key tourist attractions. Queens Park is per-
haps better and more verdant than Kelvingrove Park, even if it lacks the
monuments and statues of its West End counterpart.

Finding information after you arrive
The Greater Glasgow and Clyde Valley Tourist Board, 11 George Sq.
(% 0141-204-4400; www.seeglasgow.com; Underground: Buchanan St.),
is possibly the country’s most helpful office. In addition to piles of
brochures, you can find a small bookshop, a Bureau de Change, and a
hotel reservation service that charges a booking fee of £3 ($5.55) for
local accommodations. During peak season, the office is open Monday
through Saturday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Hours are more limited during winter months.
Information about travel can be a bit more frustrating. Start with
Traveline Scotland (% 0871-200-2233; www.travelinescotland.com),
which offers timetable information and advice on routes, but can’t quote
ticket prices. It will give out the telephone numbers of private bus com-
panies or rail operators, and you will then have to call them for informa-
tion on ticket prices.
Getting Around Glasgow
One of the best ways to explore Glasgow is on foot, but then I like walk-
ing. The center of town is laid out in a grid, which makes map reading
relatively easy. However, some of the city’s significant attractions, such
as the Burrell Collection, are in surrounding districts and to visit those
you need to rely on public transportation or a car.
By subway (underground)
The underground, which the city prefers to call U.S.-style “the subway,”
offers a basic 15-stop circular system linking the City Centre, West End,
and a bit of the near Southside. Generally, the wait for trains is no more
than five to eight minutes, but trains run at longer intervals on Sunday
and at night. The one-way fare is £1.10 ($2), or you can buy a 20-trip ticket
for £17 ($30). The underground runs Monday through Saturday from 
6:30 a.m. to about 11:30 p.m. and Sunday from 11 a.m. to about 6 p.m.
The Transcentre (local ticket sales only) at St. Enoch subway station, 
2 blocks from the Central Station, is generally open Monday through
Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., but it closes early on Wednesday.
On Sunday, the hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Glasgow and the surrounding region have the largest urban and com-
muter rail network in Great Britain, after London, and these trains are
useful for visitors. Like the subway, the system is managed by the
Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT), and service runs through
both Central and Queen Street stations. During the day, trains run as fre-
quently as every ten minutes or so to destinations in the West End and
on the Southside. Service is less frequent after the evening rush hour
and terminates around midnight. The trains aren’t cheap by European
standards: A typical round-trip (return) fare is £2.50 to £4 ($4.50–$7).

For families on an excursion, the Daytripper ticket can offer excellent
value. For about £16 ($30), two adults and up to four children (5–15 years
old) can travel anywhere in the system (including broad swaths of
Ayrshire) by train, the underground, most buses, and even a few ferries.
For one adult and two children the fare is £9 ($17).
For information on SPT tickets, call % 0141-332-6811 Monday through
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., or log on to www.spt.co.uk.
By bus
Glasgow has an extensive (though somewhat confusing) bus service run
primarily by the privately owned First Group company (www.first
group.com). Routes tend to go between east and west or north and
south points, with almost all buses coming through the center of
Glasgow. Service should be frequent during the day, although, irritat-
ingly, buses seem to arrive at the same time. After 11 p.m., service is cur-
tailed on most routes, but some (nos. 9, 12, 40, and 62) run all night (at
least on weekends). Typically, one-way (single) fares cost no more than
£1.40 ($2.75). The city bus station is the Buchanan Street Bus Station.
For about £3 ($5.55), you can buy a FirstDay ticket, good on First Group
bus lines all day (after 9:30 a.m.) with a few restrictions. A weeklong
ticket costs £13 ($24).
By taxi
Metered taxis are the same excellent ones found in Edinburgh or 
London — the so-called Fast Black, which you can hail or pick up at taxi
ranks in the central city. Alternatively, you can call TOA Taxis at % 0141-
429-7070. No matter the company, fares are displayed on a meter next to
the driver. When a taxi is available on the street, a sign on the roof is lit.
Most taxi trips within the city cost £5 to £15 ($9.25–$28). A surcharge is
imposed for late-night/early-morning runs. Private hire cars, run by vari-
ous companies, are also available, but they can’t be hailed. Call % 0141-
774-3000.
By car
You’re honestly better off not driving, but Glasgow goes a long way
toward accommodating car use by offering several multistory parking
lots. Metered street parking is available but expensive, and you need
plenty of coins to feed the meter, which issues a ticket that you must
then affix to your windshield. Some zones in residential areas are
marked PERMIT HOLDERS ONLY — your vehicle may be towed if you lack a
permit. A double yellow line along the curb indicates no parking at any
time. A single yellow line along the curb indicates restrictions, too, so be
sure to read the signs on what the limitations are for a particular area
before choosing a spot.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 193

If you want to rent a car, it’s best to arrange the rental in advance. If you
rent a car locally, most companies will accept your foreign driver’s
license. All the major rental agencies are represented at the airport. In
addition, in the city try Avis at 70 Lancefield St. (% 0870-608-6339),
Budget at 101 Waterloo St. (% 0800-212-636), or Arnold Clark at multi-
ple locations (% 0845-607-4500).
By bicycle
Although bikes aren’t as widely used in Glasgow as in Edinburgh, most
parts of the city are fine for biking. For what the Scots call “cycle hire,”
go to a well-recommended shop just off Byres Road: West End Cycles,
16–18 Chancellor St. (% 0141-357-1344; Underground: Hillhead or
Kelvinhall or Bus: 9 or 18). The shop is close to the National Cycle Trail
that leads to Loch Lomond, and it rents bikes well suited to the hilly ter-
rain of Glasgow and surrounding areas. Bikes cost about £15 ($28) per
day and a cash deposit or the imprint of a valid credit card will be neces-
sary as security. Closer to the city center, Alpine Bikes, in the TISO
Outdoor Centre, 50 Couper St. (% 0141-552-8575), near Buchanan Bus
Station, offers limited cycle rental. Prices start at £8 ($15).
On foot
I contend that walking is the best way to see the Glasgow city center and
most of the town (using trains, buses, or taxis if the distances seem too
great or the weather is really foul). Some boulevards (such as Buchanan
or Sauchiehall streets) have even been made into pedestrian malls.
But as in any bustling metropolis that’s now rather over-dependent on
the use of cars, pedestrians should always exercise caution at intersec-
tions and other crossing points. Glasgow drivers (including those
behind the wheels of city buses) can be a tad aggressive at times.
Remember: Cars drive on the left, so when you cross a street, make 
certain to look both ways.
Staying in Style
The tourist trade in Glasgow is less seasonal than in Edinburgh, with
fewer visitors in general coming to Scotland’s largest city. However,
Glasgow is a popular spot for business conferences, and the increase in
budget-airline flights from the European continent has clearly increased
the overall number of visitors. So if, for example, an international associ-
ation of dentists is in town, finding accommodations may be difficult.
Whenever you decide to visit, I recommend that you reserve a room in
advance. Some lodging is predictably expensive (though, of course, that
partially depends on the relative strength of the dollar to the pound),
but many business-oriented hotels offer bargains on weekends, and the
number of budget options is increasing. Plus, the Internet can be a real
treasure trove of reduced room rates. The Glasgow and Clyde Valley

Commercial Centre
Formerly the Arthouse hotel, this handsome Edwardian building, only a
few blocks from both Central and Queen Street train stations, was origi-
nally built to house school board offices. Today, it is a 65-room boutique
hotel smack in the heart of the city center. Dramatic colors and textures
blend in with the older structure, while commissioned art and period
pieces evoke some of the original splendor. The eponymous fine-dining
restaurant, Michael Caines @ Abode (p. 209), is under the overall direction
of a Michelin-starred chef from England, while a more casual cafe bistro is
located in the basement.

West End
This highly regarded small hotel faces Kelvingrove Park, the Art Gallery,

details (especially in the entrance hallway) are particularly impressive for
the price. Most of the 12 bedrooms share bathroom facilities. Breakfast is
buffet style.

Babbity Bowster
$–$$
Merchant City
Housed in a reconstructed late-18th-century house, the Babbity Bowster
is a small inn with fairly large character, due in part to the classic design
by brothers James and Robert Adam; the rest comes courtesy of the acer-
bic wit of owner Fraser Laurie (he with the eye patch). The units are well
appointed, if modest. But the Babbity Bowster is for travelers who don’t
spend much time in their rooms. The location is convenient to the many
local pubs and restaurants in the nightlife hotbed of the Merchant City,
and you only have a five- to ten-minute walk to the heart of central
Glasgow. The Babbity’s ground-level pub is convivial and notably civilized,

Brunswick Hotel
$$
Merchant City
In the Merchant City, the Brunswick Hotel is one of the hippest places to
stay in Glasgow. The modern, minimalist design — from the popular
cafe/bar Brutti Ma Buoni to the bedrooms with their sleek look — has aged
well since the Brunswick’s opening in the 1990s. Many of the 18 units may
be on the small side but are soothing and inviting, with neutral tones, com-
fortable mattresses, and adequate bathrooms (several with both tub and
shower). For all its trendiness, however, the Brunswick is far from preten-
tiously run. The owners are fun-loving cosmopolitans. Indeed, its cafe’s
name literally means “ugly but good,” which may accurately describe the
misshapen pizzas that the kitchen churns out but actually says more about
the place’s sense of humor. Breakfast is buffet style.
See map p. 196. 106–108 Brunswick St. % 0141-552-0001. Fax: 0141-552-1551. www.
brunswickhotel.co.uk. Underground: Buchanan St. Rack rates: £55–£100
($102–$185) double; £400 ($740) penthouse suite. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hilton Glasgow Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Commercial Centre
Glasgow’s first-class Hilton is centrally located but oddly situated over the
stretch of M8 freeway that slashes through the city of Glasgow. Perhaps
the caliber of guests ensures that they all take taxis or have private cars
because actually trying to get to and from the place on foot can be a bit of
a nightmare. Still, it is a dignified and modern hotel, one that has a good
deal of class and shine. The 20-story building’s numerous units — plush
and conservative — offer fine city views. Those staying on the executive
floors enjoy the enhanced facilities of a semiprivate club. Dining options
include a casual New York deli-style buffet called Minsky’s, as well as the
posh Camerons, with first-rate and expensive modern Scottish cuisine.

Rack rates: £140–£230 ($259–$425) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Hotel du Vin at One Devonshire Gardens
$$$$
West End
This hotel (which most locals and taxi drivers only know by its original
name, One Devonshire Gardens) is undoubtedly the most glamorous the
city has to offer: It’s the place where the rich and famous traditionally stay,
whether George Clooney or Michael Jackson. The original town houses
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
198

were built in 1880 and are possibly more elegant now than in their heyday.
Of the units, number 29, the so-called luxury town house, is the most
impressive. The suite — at least £500 ($916) per night — includes a sitting
room (with its own toilet); a separate dressing chamber; a master bedroom
with a four-poster bed; and a full bathroom with spa, separate shower with
computerized controls, and twin basins. The Bistro du Vin restaurant
offers stylish haute cuisine. Breakfast costs extra.

double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Kelvingrove Hotel
$$
West End
Three generations of women in the Somerville family have made a differ-
ence to this guesthouse since buying it in October 2002. They are welcom-
ing hoteliers with 30 years’ experience running small lodges in Edinburgh,
Inverness, and the Isle of Arran. Staff is helpful, orienting new arrivals,
answering questions, booking cabs, or just generally conversing with visi-
tors. The rooms are comfortable with mainly modern furnishings, set within
the converted flats on the ground and garden levels. Number 24 is a par-
ticularly bright and reasonably spacious family room with kitchenette.

Malmaison
$$$
Charing Cross
Commercial Centre
Today there are hip and sophisticated Malmaisons across the U.K., but it
all began in Scotland. This converted church, with its fine Greek-styled
exterior (though not Eastern Orthodox but rather Episcopal in origin),
offers only a few of the original details on the inside — the décor is sleek
and modern. In 1997, an annex designed to complement the architectural
character of the facade was added to provide additional guest rooms. The
70-plus units vary in size from quite cozy to average, but all are chic and
well appointed with special extras such as CD players, some specially com-
missioned art, and top-of-the-line toiletries. In the vaulted spaces below
reception is the popular brasserie and champagne bar.

Millennium Hotel Glasgow
$$$$
George Square
Commercial Centre
Following a $5-million upgrade at the turn of the millennium, this landmark
hotel (once called the Copthorne and erected at the beginning of the 19th
century) was modernized with all the amenities and services you’d expect
Chapter 12: Glasgow 199

of any highly rated hotel. Adjacent to Queen Street Station, the hotel faces
the city’s central plaza, George Square, and offers views of the opulent
Glasgow city chambers, with a conservatory space for dining and drinks.
The best units are at the front of the building; those in the rear offer no
views worth writing home about. The ground-floor restaurant, Brasserie
on George Square, offers an elegant, neo-colonial — but not stuffy —
dining experience, while the hotel’s Georgics Bar has an excellent selec-
tion of wines, many served by the glass.

Park Inn
$$–$$$
Commercial Centre
Formerly Langs, this modern hotel opposite the Glasgow Royal Concert
Hall and adjacent Buchanan Bus Station, is now in the hands of the Park
Inn chain of hotels. Bedrooms in various shapes, sizes, and configurations
are available, and each attempts to offer a certain flair. However, the Park
Inn is in a busy spot, and late-night noise can be a nuisance for some.

Radisson SAS
$$$
Commercial Centre
Still shiny and new since its November 2002 opening, the Radisson has set
architectural standards for hotels in Glasgow. Its dramatic and curving
facade is just a stone’s throw from Central Station, but it’s in a slightly iffy
location on the fringe of a portion of the City Centre that’s still being rede-
veloped. Contemporary units, with blonde-wood details and Scandinavian
cool, have all the modern conveniences. The 13,935-sq.-m (15,000-sq.-ft.)
club-and-fitness facility includes a 15m (49-ft.) pool and state-of-the-art
gym. Its restaurants, Collage and TaPaell’ya, offer two distinct dining
options.

Across from the Botanic Gardens, this small hotel/guest-
house in an early-20th-century Edwardian mansion overlooks the Kelvin
River. Each of the individually decorated and attractively furnished bed-
rooms has a bathroom with tub and/or shower. The hotel is well situated
for exploring the West End, with many good restaurants or brasseries

Argyll Hotel
$$
West End
The Argyll lives up to its Scottish name: It’s full of tartan
and kilts. You almost expect this traditional feel to be part of a Highland
lodge rather than an urban inn. The hotel has a clutch of spacious family
rooms, and one double has a firm four-poster bed and corner-filling bath-
tub. See map p. 196. 969–973 Sauchiehall St. % 0141-337-3313. Fax: 0141-337-3283.

City Inn
$$
West End
This smart hotel, with its waterside terrace, isn’t exactly
in the heart of the action — but neither is it very far away. Part of a small
chain with other hotels in London, Birmingham, Bristol, and Manchester,
the City Inn is modern and contemporary with good facilities. See map

Kirklee Hotel
$$
West End
A red-sandstone Edwardian terraced house, with elegant
bay windows near the West End’s diverse nightlife, the Kirklee is often rec-
ommended by locals. It’s graced with a rose garden that has won several
awards. Most of the high-ceilinged guest rooms are average size, but some
are large enough to accommodate families. See map p. 196. 11 Kensington Gate.

Premier Inn
$–$$
Merchant City
A branch of an inexpensively priced chain of
hotels, this hotel is functional, if not particularly full of character. A fair
amount of new construction is going on in the area, so the neighborhood
can be noisy during the day. Rooms that overlook the old kirkyard and
cemetery are preferable to those facing busy George Street and the
Strathclyde University parking lot across the road. See map p. 196. 187 George

This small boutique hotel has overnight rooms above
a popular and urbane pub on the ground level as well as a modern restau-
rant in the basement. The units have dark slate flooring in the bathrooms,
specially commissioned glass, photographic prints, and flat-screen televi-
sions. See map p. 196. 83 Hutcheson St. % 0141-572-0400. Fax: 0141-572-0402.

Chapter 12: Glasgow 201

Dining in Glasgow
Glasgow has welcomed a growing number of restaurants since the mid-
1990s, and choices are diverse. Although the city may not boast the
Michelin stars that a few of Edinburgh’s restaurants have earned,
Glasgow has some seriously stylish dining rooms, budget-minded
bistros, and a mix of cuisine from around the world.
Today, some of the best fresh Scottish produce is served up here,
whether it’s shellfish and seafood from the nearby West Coast sea lochs,
Ayrshire meat such as pork and lamb, or Aberdeen Angus steaks. You
can also find an ever-increasing number of ethnic restaurants. The immi-
grant groups who have most influenced Glasgow’s cuisine are Italians
and families from the Asian subcontinent, mainly the Punjab region.
There’s a surfeit of Italian and Indian restaurants, not to mention a
decent choice of Chinese and Greek restaurants.
A lot of restaurants close on Sunday or Monday (sometimes both), and
many lock up after lunch, reopening again for dinner at around 6 p.m.
The hours listed here are for when food is served; bars on the premises
may stay open longer.
For ideas on dining options, buy The List magazine’s annual Eating &
Drinking Guide, a comprehensive review of hundreds of eateries in
Glasgow (and Edinburgh).
Scotland is getting better at welcoming families, but it’s still a far cry
from the Continental approach of, say, Italy or France. That said, give 
the local restaurants a try, and resist the temptation to resort to well-
known international chains or fast-food outlets.
Prices
Prices in general could seem expensive if you’re the type to immediately
convert pounds back into dollars. Still, a range of restaurant choices is
available for most budgets. The prices listed here include the 17.5 per-
cent VAT (value-added tax), so you shouldn’t see any hidden surprises
when the bill comes. If you’re looking for bargains, inquire about pre-
theater special menus, which can be as much as half the price of regular
dinner menus.
Lunch menus in Glasgow often offer the same food as the full dinner
menus but at a much better price. If you’re trying to save money on your
food bills, have a big late lunch or early meal in the evening.
Log onto www.5pm.co.uk for a list of restaurants offering early dining
deals.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
202

Tipping
A gratuity of 10 percent is the norm for service, although leave nothing if
you were badly treated. On the other hand, if you were truly impressed
with the service you received, consider leaving 15 percent to 20 percent.
In a few restaurants, service is included in the bill automatically, but this
charge can be deleted if the service was dreadful.
Smoking
Generally speaking, when indoors, you can’t smoke. Smoking is prohib-
ited by law from all enclosed public spaces in Scotland, which includes
restaurants and bars. Some places, however, may provide outdoor seat-
ing where smoking is allowed.

Balbir’s
$$
West End
INDIAN
After a break from running restaurants in Glasgow, Balbir Singh Sumal
returned in 2005 to open this sprawling place, serving first-class curries
and other Indian specialties. Dishes are lighter than the norm, as his chefs
eschew ghee in favor of low-cholesterol rapeseed oil. The tandoori oven is
used to good effect with dishes, especially a starter of barbecued salmon,
served with fresh chutney.

FRENCH/SCOTTISH
Chef Brian Maule was born in Ayrshire, near Glasgow, but he trained with
some of the best chefs in France and became part of the team working with
the highly respected Roux brothers in London. After rising in rank to head
chef at their vaunted Michelin star–winning Gavroche restaurant, he
decided to go north and return to Scotland with his young family, opening
his own restaurant in Glasgow in 2001. His place is considered among the
finest in the city, with excellent ingredients and an ambience that’s classy
but not at all stuffy. Fresh fish and lamb dishes are recommended.

Chapter 12: Glasgow 205

MacInnes hails from a Hebridean family, so the black pudding comes down
from Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, while the haggis hails from Dingwall
in the Highlands. Particularly recommended is the black pudding,
Gandolfi’s creamy Cullen skink (smoked haddock chowder), or one of the
light pasta dishes. Although if you’re hungry, go for the steak sandwich.
The ground-floor room has original, organic, and comfortable wooden fur-
niture created by the Tim Stead workshop in Scotland. Upstairs above the
cafe/bistro is Bar Gandolfi, which is a bit livelier, while up the street a few
doors is Gandolfi Fish, the owner’s dedicated fish restaurant at 84 Albion
St. (% 0141-552-9475).
See map p. 204. 64 Albion St. % 0141-552-6813. www.cafegandolfi.com.
Reservations recommended. Underground: Buchanan St. Train: High St. Main courses:

Café Mao
$$
Merchant City
ASIAN
This restaurant is often a lively place for an evening meal in the Merchant
City district. With the big Andy Warhol–style portraits of Chairman Mao
prominently displayed in the window-filled corner location, you can’t
really miss the place. Part of a small chain of Asian eateries curiously
based in Ireland, Café Mao offers the casual setting of a spacious, modern,
and stylish bistro. The place can be quiet during lunchtime, but it’s almost
always hopping at night, with a buzz you would expect more at a popular
bar. Dishes include starters such as spring rolls stuffed with pumpkin and
main courses such as Indonesian nasi goreng (fried rice) and Vietnamese
beef and noodles, all prepared in the open kitchen where you can see
flames licking at the chefs’ bibs.
See map p. 204. 84 Brunswick St. % 0141-564-5161. www.cafemao.com. Reservations

The Dhabba
$$–$$$
Merchant City
INDIAN
Glaswegians love their Indian food, as visitors can tell from the sheer
number of Indian restaurants in the city. However, the Dhabba, which
opened in late 2002, isn’t your typical Glasgow curry house; it’s more
refined, expensive, and stylish than the norm. In an attempt to be authen-
tic, the restaurant specializes in north Indian dishes and foregoes the
bright food coloring that so many other restaurants use. In addition to
spicy dishes featuring lamb, chicken, and prawns, the menu also features
an excellent selection of vegetarian dishes, which are noticeably less
costly than the meat options. Up the street is Dhabba’s sister restaurant,
Dakhin (89 Candleriggs; % 0141-553-2585), which specializes in lighter
south Indian food and serves real rice flour dosas, too.
See map p. 204. 44 Candleriggs. % 0141-553-1249. www.thedhabba.com.
Reservations recommended. Underground: St Enoch. Main courses: £8–£18
($15–$33). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri noon to 2 p.m. and 5–11 p.m., Sat–Sun 2–11 p.m.

Dragon-i 
$$–$$$
Commercial Centre
CHINESE/FAR EAST
Although its location is convenient for the Theatre Royal, this contempo-
rary Chinese/Far Eastern restaurant would be a bigger hit if it was on a
slightly more central street. But as it’s only a few minutes’ walk from
Sauchiehall Street, it is hardly out of the way. Expect the unexpected at the
elegant Dragon-i, with cuisine that never falls into the bland or typical chow
mein or sweet-and-sour standards. Instead, the menu has dishes such as
tiger prawns with asparagus in a garlic chardonnay sauce or chicken with
sautéed apples and pineapples. The wine list is also excellent.
See map p. 204. 313 Hope St. % 0141-332-7728. www.dragon-i.co.uk. Under-
ground: Cowcaddens. Reservations recommended. Fixed-price lunch: £10 ($19). Main
courses: £11–£16 ($20–$30). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon to 2 p.m.; daily 5– 10 p.m.
Fratelli Sarti
$–$$
Commercial Centre
ITALIAN
This dual restaurant and cafe feels like a family-run cafe/bistro crossed
with a delicatessen. Indeed, you can still buy dried goods and wines here,
although they stopped carrying deli meats and cheeses a few years ago.
The pizzas are excellent, with thin, crispy crusts and modest amounts of
sauce, cheese, and toppings, which prevent them from becoming a sloppy
Chapter 12: Glasgow 207
Picnic fare
According to some translations, Glasgow, or glascau, means “dear green place.” And
this “dear green place” has no shortage of picnic spots, whether in sprawling Glasgow
Green along the Clyde near the city center; Kelvingrove Park; or the Botanic Gardens
in the West End — not to mention Pollok Country Park or Queens Park on the
Southside.
If you’re in the city center, gravitate toward Pekhams in the Merchant City near George
Square, 61 Glassford St. (% 0141-553-0666), which has a full delicatessen with fresh
bread and a wine shop.
In the West End, you are truly spoiled for choice: The options include the wonderful
Heart Buchanan Fine Food and Wine, 380 Byres Rd. (% 0141-334-7626); Delizique, 70
Hyndland St. (% 0141-339-2000); another branch of Pekhams, 124 Byres Rd. (% 0141-
357-1454); and Kember & Jones Fine Food Emporium, 134 Byres Rd. (% 0141-337-3851).
For some of the best cheese in the U.K., visit the IJ Mellis Cheesemonger branch in
Glasgow, at 492 Great Western Rd. (% 0141-339-8998). Nearby is the Glasgow branch
of Lupe Pintos, at 313 Great Western Rd. (% 0141-334-5444); it’s the perfect stop for
Mexican and American foodstuffs. On the Southside in the Shawlands district near
Queens Park, the 1901 Deli, at 11 Skirving St. (% 0141-632-1630), has a good supply
of goodies for any outdoor feast.

are filling. Come here even if you just want a real Italian espresso and
pastry. If you want a slightly more formal setting, try the Fratelli Sarti at 21
Renfield St. (% 0141-572-7000).

to 10:30 p.m.
Gamba
$$$$
Commercial Centre
FISH/SEAFOOD
For many (myself included) Gamba is Glasgow’s best bet on the strength
of its fresh fish and seafood dishes prepared by chef and co-owner Derek
Marshall — complemented by the professional and cordial staff. The base-
ment venture is modern and stylish without feeling excessively fancy.
Starters include Marshall’s signature fish soup or sashimi, with succulent
slices of salmon and scallops. Main courses may include whole lemon sole
in browned butter or delicate pan-seared sea bream. And desserts are not
an afterthought either, whether smooth panna cotta or ice cream infused
with Scotch whisky. If you’re on a tight budget, however, try the lunch or
pre-theater fixed-price menu.
See map p. 204. 225a W. George St. % 0141-572-0899. www.gamba.co.uk.
Reservations required. Underground: Buchanan St. Fixed-price lunch: £16 ($30). 
Main courses: £19–£26 ($35–$48). AE, MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon to 2:30 p.m. and

VEGETARIAN
Tied to the organic food shop located just around the corner on

rant. The feel is casual and relaxed, with sofas at the front of the dining
space and booths separated by gauzy curtains along one wall. A good

Family-friendly fare
Just like in Edinburgh, the all-you-can-eat, buffet-only Chinese restaurant has taken
Glasgow by storm. China Buffet King, 349 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-333-1788), is cen-
trally located, with a good variety of Chinese food and some European dishes, at dis-
count prices for children. Open daily from noon to 11 p.m.
A “Knickerbocker Glory” is an extremely elaborate ice-cream sundae (with fruit, jelly,
and more), and few places do it better than the University Café, 87 Byres Rd. 
(% 0141-339-5217). This Art Deco landmark has all its original features, from booths
to counter. Open Wednesday through Monday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. or so.

selection of nonalcoholic fruit drinks and organic bottled beers comple-

Broomielaw/Commercial Centre
CHINESE
One of the city’s fanciest Chinese restaurants, this classy establishment is
on a rather inauspicious block between the river and Argyle Street, just
southwest of Glasgow’s Central Station (near the Radisson SAS hotel; 
p. 200). The ambience is refined and even a bit romantic. There are usually
several duck dishes on the menu, along with a few types of fresh lobster,
plenty of fish options, and some sizzling platters as well. If you have trou-
ble deciding, the buffet makes life a bit easier.

La Parmigiana
$$$
West End
ITALIAN
This remains the favorite fine-dining Italian restaurant in Glasgow, provid-
ing a cosmopolitan and Continental atmosphere. A well-established, quar-
ter-of-a-century-old business of the Giovanazzi family, Parmigiana is often
recommended for its fish and meat dishes, whether grilled salmon with
honey roasted vegetables, pan-fried pork cutlet with caramelized apples,
or roast breast of guinea fowl stuffed with porcini mushrooms. A highlight
of the pasta options is lobster ravioli with basil cream sauce. Service by
waiters in smart black vests is usually impeccable.

Michael Caines @ ABode
$$$–$$$$
Commercial Centre
FRENCH/SCOTTISH
When it opened in 2005, this restaurant had ambitions to be the best in
the city. Chef/owner Michael Caines appears on British TV and has already
earned Michelin stars in England. It is hard to find fault with the cooking
and presentation of a dish such as seared red mullet with slivers of zuc-
chini, daubs of tomato sauce, and some eggplant purée rounded off with
a frothy fennel cream. The dining room is modern and stylish, as you
Chapter 12: Glasgow 209

would expect in a boutique hotel such as Abode (p. 195). In addition to
this fine-dining restaurant, there is a cafe/bar in the basement.
See map p. 204. 129 Bath St. % 0141-572-6011. www.abodehotels.co.uk.
Reservations recommended. Underground: Buchanan St. Fixed-price lunch: £15 ($28).

Mono
$
Saltmarket
VEGAN
In the Saltmarket district near the River Clyde, Mono does basic dairy-free
and meat-free meals in laid-back surroundings. Not only a cafe/restaurant
with a bar, Mono also houses a CD shop (see “Shopping,” later in this chap-
ter) with the latest in indie rock and non-mainstream music. Homemade
soups or veggie burgers with fries are typical. The owners also stock a
selection of organic wines. Live music, mostly but not exclusively of an
acoustic nature, is featured regularly, and the kitchen may close early on
gig nights. If this all sounds a tad too “politically correct,” relax: It’s a wel-
coming and casual place with a mixed and varied clientele.
See map p. 204. 12 Kings Court. % 0141-553-2400. Underground: St. Enoch. Main
courses: £5–£7 ($9.25–$13). AE, MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 9 p.m.
Mother India
$$–$$$
West End
INDIAN
After more than a decade in business, Mother India has established itself
as the most respected Indian restaurant in Glasgow: This is the place that
people in the know most often recommend. Unlike the norm for Indian
restaurants, the menu here isn’t overloaded with hundreds of different
dishes. Oven-baked fish, which comes wrapped in foil, is seasoned with
aromatic spices, while chicken and zucchini squash are served with a
sauce that includes pan-roasted cumin and cardamom. Whether seated on
the ground floor or in the dining room above, diners are likely to find the
staff courteous and attentive. A third dining space, the Cellar, has been
added to the premises.
Down the road toward the Kelvingrove Gallery, another branch of Mother
India with less expensive, small thali-style dishes is worth a stop if you’re
on a budget: Mother India’s Café (1355 Argyle St.; % 0141-339-9145).
See map p. 204. 28 Westminster Terrace (Sauchiehall at Kelvingrove Street). % 0141-

Commercial Centre
FISH/SEAFOOD
Sister restaurant to the original on Rose Street in Edinburgh, the Mussel
Inn has the distinction of being owned by shellfish farmers in the West of

210

Scotland. The kilo pot of mussels you eat here on any given evening may
have been harvested only 24 hours earlier. The feel at the Glasgow branch
is casual, with an open kitchen, light wood tables, and high ceilings, re-cre-
ating the feel you may find if it were located right at the seashore. In addi-
tion to the house specialty of steamed mussels served with a choice of
broths (from spicy to white wine with garlic), the queen scallop salad is

1901
$$
Southside
FRENCH/CONTINENTAL
Not too far from the Burrell Collection, 1901 is among the best choices for
a meal on the Southside. The owner once ran a French restaurant in the
city, and the décor of the dining room, which is back behind the traditional
pub, nods to this background with its use of blue, white, and red. The
menu offers a range of French-influenced and Continental food, almost all
served in large portions. Dishes include lamb shanks with garlic and
thyme, pasta with chicken, and the classic steak frites.

No. Sixteen
$$–$$$
West End
SCOTTISH
No. Sixteen has a neighborhood feel to it; the restaurant is small and
slightly cramped, with dining on the ground floor and a tiny mezzanine
above. But its appeal extends far beyond those who happen to live nearby.
The story’s been told of a couple visiting Glasgow, who came here on their
first night in town for dinner and returned every subsequent night because
they were so pleased with the food. Near the base of Byres Road, this
Scottish bistro offers inventive cooking of local ingredients: braised pig
cheek with purple endive or pan-fried filet of mackerel with olive-crushed
potatoes, for example, on daily changing menus. The pre-theater menu
offers excellent value.

Underground: Kelvinhall. Fixed-price lunch: £12 ($22). Main courses: £12–£20

Rogano
$$$–$$$$
Commercial Centre
FISH/SEAFOOD
A landmark dining establishment, Rogano boasts a well-preserved Art
Deco interior patterned after the Queen Mary ocean liner that dates back
Chapter 12: Glasgow 211

to the opening of an oyster bar here in 1935. Since then, the space has
expanded, and Rogano has hosted virtually every visiting celebrity to the
city. Service is attentive and informed. The menu emphasizes seafood,
such as halibut or lobster, often in traditional, if possibly old-fashioned,
recipes (and alas food doesn’t always live up to expectations). A less
expensive menu is offered downstairs in Cafe Rogano, which serves food
straight through the day and where the prices of main courses hover
around the £12 ($22) mark.

Stravaigin Café Bar
$$
West End
SCOTTISH/GLOBAL
The motto of Stravaigin (which roughly translates from the Scottish ver-
nacular to “wanderin’” in English) is “think global, eat local.” Although the
fine-dining restaurant in the basement has won awards, I tend to prefer the
less expensive but still memorable food served at the ground level
pub/cafe, which serves cuisine all day. Scottish produce gets international
twists: cheese and herb fritters with sweet chili sauce or roast lamb served
with coriander couscous. But you will also find staples such as hearty fish
and chips. The atmosphere is always cordial, and prices are lower still
during the busy pre-theater seating. In the downstairs restaurant, expect
concoctions such as Vietnamese-inspired marinated quail served on a
candy smoked eggplant concasse or mullet served on a bed of Thai noo-
dles with bits of mussels and mushrooms. If you like Stravaigin, you may
consider visiting its sister bistro near Byres Road, called, appropriately
enough, Stravaigin 2, Ruthven Lane (% 0141-334-7156).

Two Fat Ladies @ the Buttery
$$$
Commercial Centre/West End
FISH/SCOTTISH
One of the best-known and longest-established dining spaces in Glasgow,
though off the beaten track thanks to the manner in which the M8 freeway
slashes through the city, the Buttery exudes old-world charm — from its
rich, sumptuous bar and lounge to the wood-paneled dining room with
white linens. This restaurant and its Victorian tenement home have been
standing here since 1870 or so. But in 2007, a new franchise took over the
business: Two Fat Ladies, which is a Glasgow operation that best combines
moderate prices and excellent fish dishes. In addition to this site, there
are branches in the City Centre (118a Blythswood St.; % 0141-847-0088)
and the in West End (88 Dumbarton Rd.; % 0141-339-1944).

Ubiquitous Chip
$$$$
West End
SCOTTISH
Quite possibly no other restaurant has been more responsible for the culi-
nary renaissance in Scotland than the Ubiquitous Chip. Opening the Chip
in 1971, chef/owner Ronnie Clydesdale was ahead of the curve, bringing
the best Scottish ingredients into his kitchen — and then to the attention
of diners. To this day, the menus state the provenance of the produce, a
practice now commonplace in better restaurants. Inside the walls of a
former stable, the recently renovated dining room has a roomy interior
courtyard with a fountain and masses of climbing vines. The menu can fea-
ture free-range chicken, Aberdeen Angus beef, shellfish with crispy sea-
weed snaps, or wild rabbit. Upstairs are a small brasserie, which serves
similar quality fare at a fraction of the price, and a friendly pub.
See map p. 204. 12 Ashton Lane, off Byres Road. % 0141-334-5007. www.ubiquitous

fixed-price meals: Lunch £24 ($45); dinner £35 ($66). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Restaurant
daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30–11 p.m.; brasserie daily noon to 11 p.m.
Wee Curry Shop
$
Commercial Centre
INDIAN
This tiny place is hardly big enough to swing a cat in, but the aptly named
Wee Curry Shop offers the best low-cost Indian dishes in the city. Just about
five tables are crammed between the front door and the open kitchen,
where the chefs prepare everything to order. The menu is concise, with a
clutch of opening courses, such as fried pakora, and a half-dozen or so main
Chapter 12: Glasgow 213
Tea for two?
For tea and a snack, join the rest of the tourists in Glasgow and try to secure a table
at the landmark Willow Tea Rooms, 217 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-332-0521;
Underground: Cowcaddens). When the famed Mrs. Cranston opened the Willow Tea
Rooms in 1904, it was something of a sensation due to its unique Charles Rennie
Mackintosh design. The building’s white facade still stands out from the crowd more
than 100 years later. The dining room (one floor above street level) is open Monday to
Saturday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. A second branch on
Buchanan Street is similarly appointed, if less authentic.
For a more contemporary experience, in the West End overlooking the River Kelvin,
Tchai Ovna, 42 Otago St. (% 0141-357-4524), has a selection of some 80 teas served
in fairly eccentric and bohemian surroundings. In the evenings, you may find live
music, poetry, or comedy. Tchai Ovna is open daily from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.

courses, such as spicy chili garlic chicken. Despite the cheap prices, por-
tions are ample. Although it may feel off the beaten track, the Wee Curry
Shop is actually only a short walk from the shopping precincts of
Sauchiehall Street.

Reservations recommended. Underground: Cowcaddens. Fixed-price lunch: £5.25
($9.50). Main courses: £5–£7 ($9.25–$13). Open: Mon–Sat noon to 2 p.m. and 5:30–
10 p.m.; Sun 5–10 p.m.
Where the Monkey Sleeps
$
Commercial Centre
CAFE
Near Blythswood Square, this singular basement cafe-cum-gallery is one of
the best places for cappuccinos, soups, and sandwiches in the Commercial
Centre area of Glasgow. You know you’ve found it when you see all the
waiting messenger bikes, the riders of which seem to live here when
they’re not on the streets delivering special letters and business packages.
As the name indicates, Where the Monkey Sleeps is no ordinary cafe; it’s
owned and operated by artistic types (including two graduates from the
nearby Art School) who learned their barista skills at Starbucks but
wanted to be free of corporate constraints.
See map p. 204. 182 W. Regent St. % 0141-226-3406. www.monkeysleeps.com.

Mon–Fri 8 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.
Exploring Glasgow
Glasgow is a compact city that’s roughly the size of San Francisco. The
part that many visitors may describe as “downtown,” Glasgow’s city
center is laid out on a grid, so the commercial heart of the metropolis is
user-friendly. Most visits begin here, amid the rich Victorian architec-
ture: 19th-century banks (many of which have been converted to other
uses such as restaurants and bars), office buildings, warehouses, and
churches. Culturally, the choices in the heart of Glasgow include the
Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA), the Lighthouse (devoted to design and
architecture), and the Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA). These are
all within a fairly short walking distance of one another. Three main
boulevards — Argyle, Buchanan, and Sauchiehall streets — form a 
Z-shape and have been made into predominantly car-free pedestrian
zones that offer a wealth of shopping opportunities.
Adjacent to the Commercial Centre is the Merchant City, where loft con-
versions over the past 20 years have created a hip, happening quarter
with many lively bars and restaurants. This district skirts the historic
heart of Glasgow, but little if anything remains of the medieval city —
most of it has been knocked down over the years in various urban
renewal schemes. But at either end of the historic High Street, you can
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
214

see two of the city’s more ancient landmarks: Glasgow Cathedral, which
dates to the 13th century, and the Renaissance Tolbooth steeple.
The affluent and urbane West End has the city’s top university and
Kelvingrove Park, as well as some of the city’s best restaurants and
nightlife. Add in the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, which was
fabulously refurbished and reopened in 2006, and the West End is a
favorite place for many visitors to explore.
Of course, a river runs through Glasgow, but the city has yet to capital-
ize fully on the real potential of the Clyde. The shipbuilding that made
the river famous is long gone, yet there isn’t even an active, attractive
marina for leisure boats today. Concrete redevelopment of the water-
front, done toward the end of the 20th century, hasn’t aged particularly
well, although the riverbank, which has a national bicycle path, has a
certain run-down urban charm.
On the other side of the River Clyde, the Southside spreads out with
mostly residential neighborhoods. Some say this is the “real” Glasgow,
and it’s home to at least one major, arguably world-class attraction, the
Burrell Collection, as well as to several other destinations that merit
excursions south of the River Clyde.
At all of Glasgow’s city-run museums, from the Gallery of Modern Art to
the Burrell Collection, seeing the permanent exhibitions costs you
absolutely nothing.
You’d need at least a few days to visit every place listed in this section,
and you’d be more than exhausted by the end of your romp, so you have
to make some decisions. If you have children in tow, fewer galleries and
more family attractions would be best; if you like art, more museums
and fewer wanders may be right up your alley.
The top attractions
Botanic Gardens
West End
Glasgow’s Botanic Gardens aren’t as extensive or exemplary as the Royal
Botanic Gardens in Edinburgh. Nevertheless, they cover some 11 hectares
(28 acres). An extensive collection of tropical plants grow in Kibble Palace,
the Victorian cast-iron glass house that was recently restored. The plant
collection includes some rather acclaimed orchids and begonias. The
Botanic Gardens are a good place to unwind and wander, whether through
the working vegetable plot or along the banks of the River Kelvin. Allow
about one hour.

Hillhead. Bus: 20, 66, or 90. Open: Gardens daily dawn to dusk; greenhouses daily 
10 a.m.–4:45 p.m. (only until 4:15 p.m. in winter).

The Burrell Collection
Southside
This custom-built museum houses many of the 9,000 treasures left to
Glasgow by Sir William Burrell, a wealthy ship owner and industrialist who
had a lifelong passion for art and artifacts. He started collecting at age 14
and only stopped when he died at the age of 96 in 1958. His tastes were
eclectic: Chinese ceramics, French paintings from the 1800s, tapestries,
stained-glass windows from churches, even stone doorways from the
Middle Ages. Here you can see a vast aggregation of furniture, textiles,
ceramics, stained glass, silver, art objects, and pictures. Ancient artifacts,
Asian art, and European decorative arts and paintings are featured. It is
said that the collector “liked just about everything,” and landed one of the
very few original bronze casts of Rodin’s The Thinker. From Sir William’s
home, Hutton Castle at Berwick-upon-Tweed, the dining room, hall, and
drawing room have also been reconstructed and furnished here. A cafe is
on site, and you can roam through surrounding Pollok Country Park, some
5km (3 miles) south of the River Clyde.
Nearby Pollok House (% 0141-616-6521) dates to the 18th century. Now
run by the National Trust for Scotland, it features interiors as they were in
the Victorian/Edwardian era. Open daily with an admission charge of £8
($15) adults. Allow about two hours.

Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA)
Commercial Centre
The CCA is dedicated to the exhibition of cutting-edge art — usually of a
conceptual nature — by local artists and those with international reputa-
tions. The central and atriumlike space is actually given over to the CCA’s
popular cafe, but there are other exhibition rooms, plus a small theater,
where art-house and foreign films, coordinated by the Glasgow Film
Theatre, are screened. Housed in a restored building designed by
Alexander “Greek” Thomson, the CCA often hosts art by the nominees for
the Beck Futures Awards, which has become one of the leading judges of
young talent in Great Britain. Allow about one hour.

Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA)
Merchant City
GOMA, as it’s usually called, is housed in the former Royal Exchange in
Royal Exchange Square, where Ingram Street meets Queen Street. The
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
218

building — originally surrounded by farmland — was built as a mansion for
an 18th-century tobacco magnate. Later it was expanded by one of the
city’s busy 19th-century architects, David Hamilton, who added a dramatic
portico to the front. Now the pile and its square are at the heart of the city,
near George Square and Buchanan Street. The galleries on different floors
are somewhat pretentiously named after earth, fire, air, and water. The per-
manent collection has works by Stanley Spencer and John Bellany, as well
as art from the “new Glasgow Boys,” who emerged in the 1980s, such as
Peter Howson, Ken Currie, and Steven Campbell. Before controversially
becoming the museum in the mid-1990s, the pile was used as a public
library and recently the basement was converted to fulfill that function
again. Allow about one hour.

Glasgow Cathedral
Townhead
Also known as the cathedral of St. Kentigern or St. Mungo’s, this structure
dates to the 13th century (although its origins go back farther). The edi-
fice is mainland Scotland’s only complete medieval cathedral, making it
(along with St. Magnus on Orkney) the most important ecclesiastical build-
ing of that era in the entire country. Unlike other cathedrals on the main-
land, this one survived the Reformation practically intact, but 16th-century
zeal purged it of all monuments of idolatry. Later, misguided “restoration”
led to the demolition of its western towers, thus altering the cathedral’s
appearance.
The lower church is where Gothic design reigns, with an array of pointed
arches and piers. The Laigh Kirk (lower church), whose vaulted crypt is
said to be one of the finest in Europe, also holds St. Mungo’s tomb.
Mungo’s death in 612 was recorded, but the annals of his life date to the
12th century. Other highlights of the interior include the Blackadder aisle
and the 15th-century nave with a stone screen (unique in Scotland) show-
ing the seven deadly sins. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
For one of the best views of the cathedral — and the city, for that matter —
I urge you to cross over to the Central Necropolis, just east of the cathe-
dral grounds. Built on a proud hill and dominated by a statue of John Knox,
this graveyard (modeled in part on the famous Père Lachaise cemetery in
Paris) was opened in the 1830s. Coincidentally emblematic of the mixing of
ethnic groups in Glasgow, the first person to be buried here was Jewish, as
Jews were first to receive permission to use part of the hill as a burial
ground. Allow about one hour.

Glasgow School of Art
Garnethill/Commercial Centre
Architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s global reputation rests in large 
part — and deservedly so — on this magnificent building on Garnethill
above Sauchiehall Street, a highlight of the Mackintosh trail that legions of
his fans from across the world follow through the city. Completed in two
stages (1899 and 1909), the building offers a mix of ideas promoted by the
Arts and Crafts as well as the Art Nouveau movements. The building is
even more amazing because Mackintosh was not yet 30 when he designed
the place. It is still a working — and much respected — school whose grad-
uates continue to make their mark in the international art world. Guided
tours are the only way to see the entire building, and a highlight of the tour
is the library. If you just drop in, however, there’s a good gift shop near the
front doors, and the airy landing, one flight up, serves as the school’s exhi-
bition space, the Mackintosh Gallery. Allow about one hour.

Unappreciated genius: Alexander
“Greek” Thomson
Even though architect and designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh (1868–1928) is well
known and his worldwide popularity has spurred a cottage industry of “mock-intosh”
fakes from jewelry to stationery, a precursor of his was perhaps even more important
and innovative. Alexander “Greek” Thomson (1817–75) brought a vision to Victorian
Glasgow that was unrivaled by his contemporaries. Although the influence of classi-
cal Greek structures — the so-called Greek Revival — was nothing new in the 19th
century, Thomson didn’t so much replicate Grecian design as hone it to essentials and
then mix in Egyptian, Assyrian, and other Eastern-influenced motifs. Similar to
Mackintosh’s experiences later, Thomson increasingly found himself out of step with
the fashions of his day, which architecturally favored Gothic Revival.
An unforgivable number of structures created by the reasonably prolific and suc-
cessful Thomson have been lost to the wrecker’s ball, but some key works remain: ter-
raced houses such as Moray Place (where he lived) in the city’s Southside and Eton
Terrace in the West End; churches such as the derelict Caledonian Road Church and
the still-used St. Vincent Street Church; detached homes such as the Double Villa and
Holmwood House; and commercial structures such as the Grecian Buildings (which
today houses the CCA) and Egyptian Halls. Just as a Mackintosh trail has been cre-
ated so that fans can revisit his works, Thomson deserves no less and in time may
receive his full due.

Holmwood House
Southside
This stone villa, designed by Alexander “Greek” Thomson and built in 1858,
is probably the best example of his innovative style as applied to stately
Victorian homes. Holmwood House is magnificently original, and its
restoration (which is ongoing) has revealed that the architect was con-
cerned with almost every element of the house’s design, right down to the
wallpaper and painted friezes. Visitors have access to most parts of the
compact house and surrounding gardens. Most impressive is the overall
exterior design as well as the home’s parlor, with its circular bay window,
the cupola over the staircase, and the detailed cornicing throughout. Allow
about one hour.

center. % 0141-637-2129. www.nts.org.uk. Train: Cathcart. Bus: 44 or 66.

Hunterian Art Gallery
Hillhead/West End
The University of Glasgow inherited the artistic estate of James McNeill
Whistler, with some 60 of his paintings bestowed by his sister-in-law and
many hanging in this gallery. The main space exhibits 17th- and 18th-cen-
tury paintings (Rembrandt to Rubens) and 19th- and 20th-century Scottish
works, including some by the so-called Glasgow Boys and the Scottish
Colourists, such as Cadell, Hunter, and Fergusson. Temporary exhibits,
selected from Scotland’s largest collection of prints, are presented in the
print gallery. The Hunterian also boasts a collection of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh furnishings, and one wing of the building has a re-creation of
the architect’s Glasgow home from 1906 to 1914 — startling then and no
less so today. The Mackintosh House covers three levels, decorated in the
original style of the famed architect and his artist wife Margaret
Macdonald. All salvageable fittings and fixtures were recovered from the
original home before it was demolished in the mid-1960s. The re-creation
mimics the original house; the sequence of the rooms is identical. Allow
about 11⁄2 hours.

Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum
West End
Although the Burrell Collection (see earlier) may be the star, the refur-
bished Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum presents the stirring soul of
the city’s collection, one of the best amassed by a municipality in Europe.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 221

Reopened in 2006 after a three-year and several-million-pound refurbish-
ment, the Kelvingrove can boast that it is the most visited gallery and
museum in Scotland — indeed, it’s the most popular in the U.K. outside of
those in London. The space features French impressionists and 17th-cen-
tury Dutch and Flemish paintings. One painting of particular note is Christ
of St. John the Cross, by Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí. Purchased at great
expense by the city, it has been returned after a stint at the city’s St. Mungo
Museum (see below). Other highlights include paintings by the Scottish
Colourists and the Glasgow Boys, a wing devoted to Mackintosh, as well as
more recent art by Anne Redpath and Joan Eardley. But there is more than
art, with exhibits on Scottish and Glasgow history, armory and war, and
natural history and nature — often mixing all to good educational effect,
like showing how human armor copied the natural protection of some ani-
mals, such as the armadillo. There are plenty of interactive displays and
touches of humor, too, like the creature that supposedly is responsible for
the traditional dish, haggis. The building itself, built for the 1901 Glasgow
International Exhibition, is magnificent as well. In the semi-basement is a
new cafe/restaurant. Allow at least two hours, possibly three.

Ahead of his time: Charles Rennie
Mackintosh
Although he’s legendary today, architect, designer, and decorator Charles Rennie
Mackintosh (1868–1928) was largely forgotten in Scotland at the time of his death. His
approach, poised between the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau eras, had its fans,
however, and history has compensated for any slights he received during his lifetime.
Mackintosh used forms of nature, especially plants, in his interior design motifs, which
offered simplicity and harmony that was not the Victorian fashion. Nonetheless, in
1896, Mackintosh’s design for the Glasgow School of Art won a prestigious competi-
tion. Other Mackintosh landmark buildings in the city include the exterior of the old
Glasgow Herald building, now the Lighthouse, the Willow Tea Rooms on Sauchiehall
Street, and the Scotland Street School. His West End home from 1906 to 1914 (with
wife and collaborator Margaret Macdonald) was itself a work of art, eschewing the
fussy clutter of the age for clean, elegant lines. Its interiors have been re-created by
the University of Glasgow’s Hunterian Gallery (see listing). Forty kilometers (25 miles)
west of Glasgow, in Helensburgh, is perhaps his greatest singular achievement: Hill
House, designed for publisher Walter Blackie in 1902.
Later failures to win commissions locally led Mackintosh to move out of Glasgow, to
the southern coast of England and later to Port Vendres, France. In both places, how-
ever, his artistic talents were not wasted. He painted watercolors of flowers and land-
scapes that are as distinctive as his architectural and interior design work.

People’s Palace
East End
This museum covers the social history of Glasgow, with exhibits on how
“ordinary people” have lived in the city, especially since the industrial age.
It also attempts to explain the Glasgow vernacular — speech patterns and
expressions that even Scots from outside the city can have trouble deci-
phering. Further noteworthy are the murals painted by “new Glasgow Boy”
Ken Currie. In front of the museum is the recently restored Doulton
Fountain, which was moved here from another spot on Glasgow Green.
The spacious Winter Gardens, to the rear of the building (along with a
cafe), are in a restored Victorian glass house, which offers a nice retreat.
Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

St. Vincent Street-Milton Free Church
Commercial Centre
This should be a four-star, must-see attraction, but public access is lim-
ited by the evangelic reformed Free Church of Scotland congregation that
worships here. Nevertheless, the church remains the most visible land-
mark attributed to the city’s other great architect, Alexander “Greek”
Thomson. Built in 1859, the stone edifice offers two classic Greek porticos
facing north and south, aside which a clock tower rises, decorated in all
manner of exotic yet curiously sympathetic Egyptian, Assyrian, and even
Indian-looking motifs and designs. The interior is surprisingly colorful.

Charing Cross. Bus: 62. Sun services at 11 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. Interiors open only
during services.
Science Centre
Govan/Southside
The Science Centre has been called Great Britain’s most successful “mil-
lennium project,” but with so many stinkers (notably London’s Dome) con-
structed to commemorate the year 2000, that compliment can be read as
faint praise. Indeed, a millennium jinx has hit even here.
The center’s tall, slender tower topped by an observatory room was
designed to give breathtaking views. But it closed shortly after the Science
Centre opened in 2001, reopened later, closed again, and then reopened. I
offer no guarantees when you visit.
Still, on the banks of the River Clyde and opposite the Scottish Exhibition
and Conference Centre, this futuristic-looking museum is a focal point of
Glasgow’s drive to redevelop the run-down former dock lands. The over-
all theme of the exhibitions is to document 21st-century challenges as well
Chapter 12: Glasgow 223

as Glasgow’s contribution to science and technology in the past, present,
and future. Families should enjoy the hands-on and interactive activities,
whether taking a three-dimensional head scan or starring in their own dig-
ital video. The Science Centre also is home to a planetarium and the silver-
skinned IMAX Theater, which uses a film with a frame size some ten times
larger than the standard 35mm film. The planetarium and theater charge
separate admission. Allow about two hours.

Tenement House
Garnethill/Commercial Centre
Tenements (or apartment buildings) were what many Glaswegians lived
in from the middle of the 19th century. And many still do so today. Run by
the National Trust for Scotland, this “museum” is a typical home, pre-
served with all the fixtures and fittings from the early part of the 20th cen-
tury: coal fires, box bed in the kitchen, and gas lamps. Indeed, the resident,
Miss Agnes Toward, apparently never threw out anything from 1911 to
1965, so there are displays of all sorts of memorabilia, from tickets stubs
and letters to ration coupons and photographs from trips down the Clyde.
Allow about one hour.

More cool things to do and see
City Chambers
Merchant City
Located on George Square, Glasgow’s city hall is even more impressive on
the inside than on the outside. Even if you don’t take the free tour, at least
pop your head in to see the cruciform front hall (the only part open to visi-
tors who don’t take the tour). Ceiling-tile work and magnificent marble
columns appear throughout the building. In fact, the palatial interior has
been used in many films as a stand-in for both the Vatican and the Kremlin,
as well as for an interior shot in Dr. Zhivago. The office of the city’s Lord
Provost (the ceremonial mayor) is here as well. Outside, Yanks might note
a mini Statue of Liberty atop the facade, just below the flag. The tour takes
about 45 minutes.

Glasgow Green
East End
Glasgow Green is the city’s oldest park, probably dating from medieval
times. Running along the River Clyde southeast of the Commercial Centre
and Merchant City, this huge stretch of green had paths laid and shrubs
planted in the middle of the 18th century but didn’t formally become a
public park until some 100 years later. Its landmarks include the People’s
Palace (see listing earlier in this chapter) social history museum and
adjoining Winter Garden, the Doulton Fountain, and Nelson’s Monument.
At one end of the green, the influence of the Doges’ Palace in Venice can
be seen in the colorful facade of the old Templeton Carpet Factory. Near
here is a large children’s play area. The southern side of Glasgow Green
offers dulcet walks along the river. Allow one to four hours.

House for an Art Lover
Southside
This house, which opened in 1996, was simply based on — or rather
inspired by — an incomplete 1901 competition entry of Charles Rennie
Mackintosh. Therefore, the building, however elegant its interiors, is really
just a modern architect’s interpretation of what Mackintosh had in mind.
The tour includes the main hall, the dining room, with its gesso panels,
and the music room. Mackintosh devotees flock here, but to me it is not
the same as the real thing. On the plus side, however, there is the popular
Art Lover’s Cafe, as well as a gift shop, all surrounded by a parkland set-
ting adjacent to Victorian walled gardens. Allow about one hour.

Hunterian Museum
Hillhead/West End
First opened in 1807, this is Glasgow’s oldest museum. It’s named after
William Hunter, its early benefactor, who donated his private collections in
1783. The original home was a handsome Greek Revival building near High
Street, across town on the Old College campus, none of which survives
today. Now housed in the main Glasgow University buildings, the collec-
tion is wide-ranging: from dinosaur fossils to coins to relics of the Roman
occupation and plunder by the Vikings. The story of Captain Cook’s voy-
ages is pieced together in ethnographic material from the South Seas.
Allow about one hour.

The Lighthouse
Commercial Centre
The Lighthouse (Scotland’s Centre for Architecture, Design, and the City)
opened in 1999, a year when the city hosted an international celebration
of its architecture. It is housed in Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s first public
commission, home of the Glasgow Herald newspaper from 1895 until the
middle of the 20th century. The building is now a seven-story exhibition
space devoted to architecture and design. The Mackintosh Interpretation
Centre, on the third level, is the Lighthouse’s only permanent exhibition,
which provides an overview of Mackintosh’s art, design, and architecture.
Visitors can ride an elevator to a viewing platform that offers a unique

This museum contains a collection of all forms of transportation and
related technology. Displays include a simulated 1938 Glasgow street with
period shop-fronts, era-appropriate vehicles, and a reconstruction of one
of the original Glasgow Underground stations. The superb and varied ship
models in the Clyde Room reflect the significance of Glasgow and the River
Clyde as one of the world’s foremost areas of shipbuilding and engineer-
ing. By 2011, the museum should be in a new flashy building on the city’s

Pollok Country Park

On the Southside, this large, hilly expanse of open space is the home to
both the Burrell Collection and Pollok House but merits a visit for its own
attributes. Rhododendrons, Japanese maples, and azaleas are part of the
formal plantings created at the end of the 19th century by Sir John Stirling
Maxwell, whose family were longtime residents of Pollok House. However,
the park is best for its glens and pastures, which lend themselves to graz-
ing Highland cattle. Allow one to four hours.

among other spiritual leaders, saints, and historic figures are treated
equally. The grounds include a Zen garden of stone and gravel. Allow about
one hour.

Scotland Street School Museum
Southside
Another of Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s designs, this building, commis-
sioned by the local school board around the beginning of the 20th century,
celebrated its centenary in 2005. Given that it is surrounded by light-indus-
trial parks and faces the M8 motorway, it seems an odd location for a
school. But that’s only because all the surrounding apartment buildings
were torn down, which is why the school had only about 90 pupils when
it shut down in 1979. The museum that occupies this admittedly lesser
work from the great architect is devoted to the history of education in
Scotland, with reconstructed examples of classrooms from the Victorian,
World War II, and 1960s eras. It also has displays of Mackintosh’s design for
the building. Allow about one hour.

The Tall Ship at Glasgow Harbour
West End
Here you have a chance to board one of the last remaining Clydebuilt sail-
ing ships, the SV Glenlee. Built in 1896, it rounded Cape Horn 15 times.
Restored in 1999, the vessel is one of only five sailing ships built on the
River Clyde that remain afloat. You can explore the ship and take in exhi-
bitions detailing Glenlee’s cargo-trading history. An old captain’s log tells
the sorry story of a sailor who fell ill and never recovered. Check out the
frightening video showing what it was like on the deck of this type of ship
at stormy seas. Rough stuff. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

daily 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Guided tours
The City Sightseeing Glasgow tours circle the town in brightly colored,
open-topped buses, departing from George Square about every 15 to 
20 minutes between 9:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. You can hop on and off at some
22 designated stops such as Glasgow Green, Glasgow University, or the
Royal Concert Hall. Passes are good for two consecutive days. The live
commentary can be quite entertaining and informative, too. For more
information, contact the office at 153 Queen St. at George Square 
(% 0141-204-0444; www.scotguide.com.). Tickets are £9 ($17) adults,
£3 ($5.55) children, £20 ($37) family.
If you prefer to keep your feet on the ground and your focus is on the
more ghoulish aspects of Glasgow, the guides from Mercat Glasgow
walking tours are happy to oblige. In season (Easter–Oct), they depart
every evening from the Tourist Information Centre at George Square at
about 7:30 p.m. Guides re-create macabre Glasgow — a parade of goons
including hangmen, ghosts, murderers, and body snatchers. The tours
take about 11⁄2 hours. The company also does Historic Glasgow tours on

The “Old Firm”
Glasgow has Scotland’s two largest professional soccer teams — Celtic and Rangers —
and they are collectively called the “Old Firm.” These clubs are among the biggest in
Europe, and both have passionate, even fanatical followers. Alas, given the clubs’ his-
tories, fans are also drawn into sectarian (religious/political) disputes that have little
to do with modern politics or religion but can become violent. The best bet for visitors
is to politely avoid discussions regarding the Old Firm, unless extremely well versed.
A safe bet if pressed is to say you prefer Partick, Glasgow’s small West End club with
no sectarian ties.

request. For information, contact Mercat at 25 Forth Rd., Bearsden 
(% 0141-586-5378; www.greekthomsonchurch.com). Tickets are 
£8 ($15).
Waverley Excursions (% 0141-221-8152 or 0845-130-4647; www.
waverleyexcursions.co.uk) will take you out on the Waverley, consid-
ered the world’s last “seagoing” paddle steamship, built on the Clyde in
1947. During the summer and depending on weather conditions, it con-
tinues to ply the river, with one-day trips beginning at the Glasgow
Science Centre. The Waverley takes passengers “doon the watter” to his-
toric and scenic places along the Firth of Clyde, sometimes going as far
as the Isle of Arran. As you sail along, you can take in what were once
vast shipyards turning out more than half the earth’s tonnage of ocean-
going liners. Boat tours cost £9 to £30 ($17–$56).
Suggested one-, two-, and three-day itineraries
If you feel a bit overwhelmed by all the options of things to do and see in
Glasgow, you’re not alone. I’ve laid out a few itineraries in this section to
help you focus on your interests and use your time most efficiently, while
giving you a good sampling of what Glasgow has to offer. Remember,
these are just my ideas — feel free to tailor these itineraries to suit your
own schedule and taste.
If you have one day
From George Square (the city’s main plaza in front of Glasgow City
Chambers and the Queen Street Station), catch one of the open-topped
Glasgow tour buses. Depending on your guide, the trip can be as enter-
taining as it is informative. The buses circumnavigate the city from his-
toric Glasgow Cathedral and the sprawling riverside park, Glasgow
Green, in the east to Glasgow University and trendy Byres Road in the
west. These open tour buses are the best way for visitors to get oriented
and understand the city’s layout and topography. Tickets are valid for 24
hours, and you can get off and on as much as you desire. Visit at least
one of the city-run museums (remember, they’re free) and a bona-fide
Glasgow pub, such as the Horse Shoe.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 229
A festival all its own
There’s no doubt that if history could be rewritten, Glasgow would love to be the host
of the world-renowned annual festival and festival fringe that take place in Edinburgh.
However, the city to the west is not bereft of its own annual happenings. Celtic
Connections is the best-attended annual festival in Glasgow and the largest of its kind
(a folk festival plus more than that description implies) in the world. It kicks off the year
every January. The main venue for performances is the Royal Concert Hall, which pro-
duces the event. Guests include folk musicians, dancers, and contemporary artists.
For more information, contact % 0141-353-8000 or visit www.grch.com.

If you have two days
Spend your first day as I suggest in the one-day itinerary above. Then,
try to take in a bit of real Charles Rennie Mackintosh architecture by
way of an organized tour of the Art School on Garnethill, or an unguided
visit to the interiors of his family house, reconstructed at Glasgow
University’s Hunterian Art Gallery. Spend more time in the West End
and check out the renovated Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum. Or
go south and visit the vaunted Burrell Collection. Its art and artifacts,
from ancient to modern, are the pride of the city, housed in an attrac-
tive, contemporary building amid verdant Pollok Country Park.
If you have three days
Follow my one- and two-day itineraries earlier, and on your third day,
architecture buffs should discover more about Alexander “Greek”
Thomson, who preceded Mackintosh by two generations and was
equally innovative and important. Try Holmwood House on the city’s
Southside. After London, Glasgow is the second best city for shopping 
in the entire U.K. But don’t be content with the familiar department
stores (House of Fraser or John Lewis); seek out the designer labels in
Merchant City’s Italian Centre or some funky shops off Byres Road in
the West End. Don’t miss a visit to the Cathedral, and if the weather is
fine, hike around the nearby Central Necropolis. The city’s main grave-
yard occupies a hill, so the views are grand, and the area has also
become home to a family of deer.
If you (are lucky and) have four days or more
Having followed my earlier recommendations, those interested in social
history may, on their fourth day, want to visit the People’s Palace
museum in Glasgow Green, while visitors attuned to contemporary arts
have not only the CCA but also the Arches and Tramway to consider.
On the weekends, lovers of flea markets owe the Barras stalls a visit.
You can also take an excursion down the Clyde toward the sea or up the
road to Loch Lomond and the beginnings of the Highlands. In most
directions, it takes a drive of only about 15 to 25 minutes to find open
countryside outside Glasgow.
Walking tour: The West End
Because Glasgow is set on fairly gentle hills rising up from a basin cre-
ated by the River Clyde, the city is amenable to walking. Most perambula-
tions don’t involve the scaling of many steep streets, although in order 
to obtain good vistas, a climb is sometimes obligatory. This stroll takes
about two hours (without going inside any buildings) and gives you a
sense of Glasgow’s salubrious and trendy West End, while hitting some of
its landmarks as well. The stroll begins in Charing Cross on Sauchiehall
Street, but on the western side of the M8 motorway, which is set in a con-
crete canyon.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
230

Begin at:
1. Cameron Fountain
From the rusty red-stone fountain, built in 1896 and listing consid-
erably eastward, one can stroll a few blocks south on North Street,
which runs parallel to the freeway, to see the Mitchell Library, the
largest public reference library in Europe. At the back of the build-
ing is the Mitchell Theatre, inscribed with the names of Raphael,
Watt, Michelangelo, Newton, and more.
From the fountain, walk up Woodside Crescent (often abbreviated
as “Cres”) to:
2. Woodside Terrace
This late Georgian row of homes (designed by George Smith in the
1830s) began an exemplary New Town development. Here you find
Greek Doric porticos unlike any in the city. But most of the credit for
the overall elegance and charm of Woodlands Hill goes to Charles
Wilson, whose designs in the middle of the 19th century are mostly
responsible for the terraces up the hillside to Park Circus.
Continue on Woodside Terrace, turning right (north) on Lynedoch
Terrace to Lynedoch Street, and proceed left to:
3. Trinity College and Park Church Tower
The former Trinity College (now Trinity House) is a landmark
whose three towers are visible from many approaches to the city.
Designed by Charles Wilson, it was constructed in 1857 as the Free
Church College. Apparently most of the original interiors were lost
when the complex was converted to condos in the 1980s. Across
the broad triangular intersection is the cream-colored Park Church
Tower. Part of J.T. Rochead’s 1856 design, it is the other feature of
the neighborhood that is recognizable from some distance. Alas,
the church that went with the tower was razed in the late 1960s.
Only a steeple remains.
From here, go left (south) and follow the gentle curve (west) of
Woodlands Terrace, turning right (north) at Park Street South to:
4. Park Circus
This oval of handsome and uniform three-story buildings around 
a small central garden is the heart of Wilson’s plans, designed in
1855. No. 22 (now the registration office and site of civil cere-
monies) offers the most remarkable interiors, with Corinthian
columns and an Art Nouveau billiard room. Attendants are not
impressed when uninvited visitors just wander in, however. Luckily,
the external door is impressive enough. At the western end of Park
Circus is Park Gate, which leads to an entrance to Kelvingrove Park.
This promontory offers excellent views towards the University and
south to the Clyde.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 231

Enter:
5. Kelvingrove Park
Originally West End Park, the development of this hilly and lush
open space on the banks of the River Kelvin was commissioned to
Sir Joseph Paxton in 1854, although construction apparently began
a year before he produced his plans. At this elevated entrance is
the statue of Lord Roberts on his steed. Down the hill to the left,
the Gothic Stewart Memorial Fountain includes signs of the zodiac
and scenes that depict the source of the city’s main supply of
water: Loch Katrine. Crossing the river below Park Gate at the
Highland Light Infantry Memorial is the faded red sandstone Prince
of Wales Bridge. Across the bridge looking back at you is the head
of Thomas Carlyle emerging from the roughly hewn stone.
When facing the bridge at the infantry memorial, go right (north)
and follow one of the two paths that run along the river and exit the
park at:
6. Gibson Street
Leaving the park, turn left (west) and cross the short road bridge
that brings you into the Hillhead district, which includes the main
campus of the University of Glasgow on Gilmorehill and the Western
Infirmary. Gibson Street today offers several eating and drinking
options. If you’re hungry, stop now.
Continue west on Gibson Street to Bank Street, go right (north) 
1 block to Great George Street, then left (west) 1 block to Oakfield
Avenue and:
7. Eton Terrace
Here, on the corner across from Hillhead High School, the unmistak-
able work of architect Alexander Thomson is evident in an impres-
sive (if today poorly kept) terrace of eight houses completed in 1864
(following his similarly designed Moray Place). Two templelike
facades serve as bookends, both pushing slightly forward and rising
one floor higher than the rest, and have double porches apparently
fashioned after the Choragic Monument of Thrassylus in Athens.
Ironically, for all his admiration of Eastern design, Thomson never
traveled outside the U.K.
Return to the corner of Great George Street and follow Oakfield
Avenue south, crossing Gibson Street to University Avenue; then
turn right (west) up the hill to the:
8. University of Glasgow
Aficionados rightfully bemoan the loss of the original campus east
of High Street, which may have offered the best examples of 17th-
century architecture in Scotland. The university moved to its cur-
rent location in the 1860s, and the city could have done worse — a
lot worse. The setting high above Kelvingrove Park is befitting of a
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
232

center of learning. Englishman Sir George Gilbert Scott controver-
sially won the design commission and his Gothic Revival is punctu-
ated by a tower that rises from the double quadrangle — a virtual
beacon on the horizon of the West End. Fragments of the original
university can be seen, too, in the facade of Pearce Lodge as well as
the salvaged Lion and Unicorn Stair at the chapel.
Cross University Avenue north to Hillhead Street and the:
9. Hunterian Art Gallery
Built in the 1980s next to the university library, this gallery houses
the school’s permanent collection, which includes 18th- and 19th-
century Scottish art as well as many works by James McNeill
Whistler. Scots-Italian contemporary artist Eduardo Paolozzi
designed the chunky cast-aluminum internal doors to the main
exhibition space.
Incorporated into the building (past the gift shop) is:
10. Mackintosh House
Originally nearby and demolished by the university in the 1960s,
the West End home of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and his wife,
Margaret Macdonald, is replicated here with furniture and interiors
designed by the pair. Visitors enter from the side (the front door is
actually several feet above the level of the plaza outside), and see
the dining room, sitting room with study, and the couple’s bed-
room. At the top is a replication of a bedroom Mackintosh designed
for a house in England, his final commission.
Return to University Avenue, exit Mackintosh House, turning 
right to:
11. University Gardens
This street features a fine row of houses designed primarily by 
J.J. Burnet in the 1880s, but it’s worth a stop especially to admire
no. 12, done by J. Gaff Gillespie in 1900; that house exemplifies
Glasgow style and the influences of Mackintosh and Art Nouveau.
Continue down University Gardens, past Queen Margaret Union and
other university buildings, going left down the stairs just past the
Gregory Building. At the bottom of the stairs, follow the sidewalk
and turn right onto:
12. Ashton Lane
This cobbled mews is the heart of West End nightlife, although it
bustles right through the day, too, with a mix of University stu-
dents, instructors, and staff, as well as local residents. The host of
bars, cafes, and restaurants here include the venerable Ubiquitous
Chip, which can be credited for starting (in 1971) the ongoing ren-
aissance of excellent cooking of fresh Scottish produce.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 233

Go left past Ubiquitous Chip down the narrow lane to Byres Road.
Just to the right, you can catch the underground (Hillhead station)
back to the city center (Buchanan Street station). Or turn right on:
13. Byres Road
Ashton Lane’s primary entrance is midway along the proverbial
Main Street of this part of Glasgow: Byres Road, which is full of
bars, cafes, restaurants, and shops. Rarely less than buzzing, the
road exemplifies the West End for many people. If you aren’t in a
hurry, the streets running west from Byres Road, such as Athole 
or Huntly Gardens, merit a brief wander to see the proud town
houses.
Proceed north up Byres Road to:
14. Great Western Road
It took an act of Parliament in London in 1836 to create this street,
and then a new turnpike road into the city. Today, its four lanes
remain one of the main thoroughfares into and out of Glasgow. A
stroll west for 5 or 6 blocks from this intersection (Byres and Great
Western roads) reveals the opulent terraces (including one by
Thomson) along Great Western’s southern flank. Going in the oppo-
site direction takes you to more retail and commercial shops.
Cross Great Western Road to the:
15. Botanic Gardens
Neither as extensive nor as grand as the Royal Botanic Gardens in
Edinburgh, this hilly park is pleasant nonetheless. One main attrac-
tion, Kibble Palace, is a giant domed cast-iron-and-glass Victorian
conservatory with exotic plants. Other greenhouses contain orchid
collections, while the outdoor planting includes a working vege-
table plot, roses and rhododendrons, and beds with lots of flower-
ing perennials.
Shopping in Glasgow
After London, the capital of Great Britain and a city at least ten times its
size, Glasgow apparently has the second most retail space in all of the
U.K. It is a shopping mecca for everyone in the west of the country and
apparently a reason for people to visit from northern England, too, as it
is not as far away as the shops of London’s Soho.
Among the few retail goods that are high quality and priced competi-
tively are fine wool knits, particularly cashmere sweaters — or as the
Scots prefer, “jumpers” — and scarves. Anything produced within the
country (with the exception of whisky, which is taxed as heavily as all
alcoholic products) should be less expensive than at home: from
smoked salmon and shortbread to Caithness glass, used in those
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
234

beguiling paper weights with swirling, colorful designs. Finally, given the
number of artists in the country, getting an original piece of art to bring
home might represent the most value for money.
For visitors from abroad, prices in the U.K. aren’t a major selling point.
In recent years, the British currency (the pound sterling) has been trad-
ing strongly against other major currencies, such as the U.S. dollar and
the euro (which most of Great Britain’s partners in the European Union
use). The good news is that prices for most products in Scotland have
been stable since the mid-1990s, and in some cases (for example,
clothes) prices have come down in real terms. Nevertheless, many items
carry the same numerical price in pounds as they would in American
dollars. For example, a digital camera that costs $300 in New York may
well be priced £300 ($555) in Glasgow, making it considerably more
expensive in Scotland.
Best shopping areas
The main area for retail therapy is defined by the pedestrian malls of
Argyle Street, Buchanan Street, and Sauchiehall Street, which join
together and form a Z shape right in the heart of the city. But for more
unique shops and fashions, it pays to venture to the Merchant City and
the West End. And perhaps the city’s most unique shopping experience
is at the flea marketlike stalls at the weekend Barras market, in the East
End of Glasgow.
In general, shops in the city are open Monday to Wednesday, Friday, and
Saturday from 9 or 10 a.m. until 6 p.m. And be warned, they tend to close
sharply, regardless of the number of potential shoppers still out on the
sidewalks. But in 2006, the city considered later opening hours for city
center stores in order to compete with the shopping developments on
Glasgow’s periphery, which are open daily until 8 p.m. No action was
taken by the end of 2008, however. Only on Thursday do the shops “in
town” stay open late — until 8 p.m., at least. Most established stores are
now open in the afternoon on Sunday, too.
Shopping complexes
Of course, any shopping city worth its salt these days must offer indoor
malls. In Glasgow, Princes Square (Buchanan Street; % 0141-204-1685;
www.princessquare.co.uk) is the city’s most stylish and up-market
shopping center. Housed in a modernized and renovated Victorian build-
ing, the mall has many specialty stores, men’s and women’s fashion out-
lets, and restaurants, cafes, and bars.
Nearby, between Argyle Street and the River Clyde is the St. Enoch
Shopping Centre (% 0141-204-3900), whose merchandise is less expen-
sive and a lot less posh than what you find at Princes Square. St. Enoch’s
resembles a fairly conventional mall, with a couple of major department
stores and a food court at one end.
Chapter 12: Glasgow 235

If you’re after a fancy watch or gold ring, go to the Argyll Arcade, the
main entrance to which is at 30 Buchanan St. Even if the year of its con-
struction (1827) weren’t posted above the entrance, you’d still know
that this collection of shops beneath a curved glass ceiling is historic.
The L-shaped arcade contains one of the largest concentrations of retail
jewelers, both antique and modern, in all of Europe. Purchasing a wed-
ding band here is considered lucky.
The latest contribution to mall shopping in the city center is the
Buchanan Galleries (% 0141-333-9898; www.buchanangalleries.
co.uk), found at the top of Buchanan Street. Completed in 1999, this
mammoth development is hardly groundbreaking, but it does include
the rightfully respected John Lewis department store.
On the western outskirts of town, the Braehead Shopping Centre
(% 0141-885-1441; www.braehead.co.uk) opened most recently and
somewhat controversially because it appears to be taking people away
from the city center. Braehead’s major draw is a sprawling Ikea store.
What to look for and where to find it
If your shopping intentions are less of the browsing variety, here are
some of Glasgow’s specialized shopping options. Unless otherwise indi-
cated, the shops below are in the Commercial Centre of Glasgow and 
are within walking distance of the Buchanan Street or St. Enoch under-
ground stations.
Antiques
 Victorian Village offers a warren of shops and a pleasantly claus-
trophobic clutter of goods. Much of the merchandise isn’t particu-
larly noteworthy, but you can find some worthwhile pieces if you
know what you’re after and are willing to go hunting. 93 W. Regent
St. (% 0141-332-0808).
Art
 Compass Gallery was opened by Cyril Gerber (see next bullet) to
offer affordable pieces of contemporary art by local artists. You can
find something special for as little as £20 ($37) here, depending on
the show. The pre-Christmas sale is particularly good. 178 W.
Regent St. (% 0141-221-6370; www.compassgallery.co.uk).
 Cyril Gerber Fine Art is one of Glasgow’s best small galleries and
shops. It veers away from the avant-garde, specializing in British
painting of the 19th and 20th centuries. It has good Scottish land-
scapes and cityscapes, especially works by Colourists and the
Glasgow Boys. Gerber has been the city’s most respected art
authority for several decades, with lots of contacts in art circles
throughout Great Britain. 148 W. Regent St. (% 0141-221-3095;
www.gerberfineart.co.uk).
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
236

 Glasgow Print Studio includes a shop that sells limited-edition
etchings, wood blocks, aquatints, and screen prints by members 
of the prestigious collective as well as other notable artists. Prices
are good, and there’s a framing facility on the premises. 25 King St.
(% 0141-552-0704; www.gpsart.co.uk).
Books
 Borders offers a multistory shop at the back of Royal Exchange
Square. You find a gratifying emphasis on the culture of Scotland
and plenty of places to sit and read. Borders also has the best
selection of international periodicals in Scotland. 98 Buchanan St.
(% 0141-222-7700; www.borders.com).
 Caledonia Books is one of the few remaining secondhand and anti-
quarian shops in the city of Glasgow. Charming and well run, the
stock here tends to favor quality over quantity. 483 Great Western
Rd., West End (% 0141-334-9663; www.caledoniabooks.co.uk).
 Waterstones is a giant Barnes & Noble–like operation with plenty of
stock, a cafe, and a lot of soft seats. The ground floor features a
good Scottish section. 174 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-248-4814; www.
waterstones.co.uk).
Clothes
 Cruise has the best selection of designer togs in town — better bring
your credit cards! Labels include Prada, Armani, D&G, Vivienne
Westwood, and more. At the second branch nearby (223 Ingram St.),
the Oki-Ni shop within the shop offers limited-edition Adidas and
Levis. 180 Ingram St., Merchant City (% 0141-572-3232).
 Jigsaw was recently relocated under the glorious dome of the
Baroque-style former Savings Bank of Glasgow. This is the fashion-
able U.K. chain of clothes and accessories for women and juniors.
Using its own design team in Kew, West London, Jigsaw opened its
first shop in Hampstead some 30 years ago. 177 Ingram St., at
Glassford Street (% 0141-552-7639).
 Starry Starry Night shows just how tiny those Victorians and
Edwardians were — although they wore some pretty stunning
gowns. This shop (with a branch in the Barras market) normally has
a few items worth dusting off. It also stocks secondhand kilts and
matching attire. 19 Dowanside Lane, West End (% 0141-337-1837).
 Thomas Pink is perhaps the closest thing to that temple of preppy
sensibilities: Brooks Brothers. This is the place for the finest
button-down Oxford shirts that a man could possibly hope for —
and a silk tie to match. 1 Royal Bank (% 0141-248-9661).
Department stores
 Debenhams is a sturdy department store with midrange prices. 
St. Enoch Shopping Centre, 97 Argyle St. (% 0141-221-0088).
Chapter 12: Glasgow 237

 House of Fraser is Glasgow’s version of Harrods. A Victorian-era
glass arcade rises up four stories, and on the various levels you
find everything from clothing to Oriental rugs to crystal to hand-
made local artifacts of all kinds. 21–45 Buchanan St., at Argyle
Street (% 0141-221-3880; www.houseoffraser.co.uk).
 John Lewis is a close equivalent to Macy’s, with quality brand
names, assured service, and a no-questions-asked return policy 
on damaged or faulty goods. Buchanan Galleries, 220 Buchanan St.
(% 0141-353-6677).
 Marks & Spencer has had its share of problems with shareholders
and in board rooms, as anyone who reads international finance
pages will know. But the chain carries on with clothing and very
good food halls. The two branches in Glasgow are on Argyle and
Sauchiehall streets. 2–12 Argyle St. (% 0141-552-4546); 172
Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-332-6097).
Edibles
See the sidebar “Picnic fare,” earlier in this chapter, for a list of select
food markets with Scottish specialties.
Gifts and design
 Catherine Shaw is named after the long-deceased matriarch of the
family that still runs this place. It’s a somewhat cramped gift shop
that has cups, mugs, postcards, jewelry, and souvenirs — a good
place for easy-to-pack gifts. 24 Gordon St. (% 0141-204-4762). 
Look for another branch at 31 Argyll Arcade (% 0141-221-9038);
entrances to the arcade are on both Argyll and Buchanan streets.
 Felix & Oscar is a wacky and fun shop for offbeat cards and toys,
kitsch accessories, fuzzy bags, perfumes and toiletries, and a selec-
tion of T-shirts that you’re not likely to find anywhere else in
Glasgow. (In addition to the flagship, there is another on Cresswell
Lane.) 459 Great Western Rd., West End; Underground: Kelvinbridge
(% 0131-339-8585).
 Mackintosh Shop is a small gift shop in the Glasgow School of Art
that prides itself on a stock of books, cards, stationery, mugs, glass-
ware, and sterling-and-enamel jewelry created from or inspired by
the original designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Glasgow School
of Art, 167 Renfrew St. (% 0141-353-4500).
Kilts and tartan
 Geoffrey (Tailor) Kiltmakers and Weavers is both a retailer and a
manufacturer of tartans, which means they have all the clans and
have also created their own range of 21st-century-style kilts — for
better or for worse. 309 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-331-2388; www.
geoffreykilts.co.uk).
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
238

 Hector Russell was founded in 1881 and remains Scotland’s long-
established kiltmaker. Crystal and gift items are sold on street level,
but the real heart and soul of the place is below, where impeccably
crafted and reasonably priced tweed jackets, tartan-patterned
accessories, waistcoats, and sweaters of top-quality wool for men
and women are displayed. 110 Buchanan St. (% 0141-221-0217).
 James Pringle Weavers has been in business since 1780. This shop
is known for its traditional clothing that includes well-crafted, bulky
wool sweaters and a tasteful selection of ties, kilts, and tartans.
Some of the merchandise is unique to this shop. Ever slept in a
tartan nightshirt? 130 Buchanan St. (% 0141-221-3434).
Music
 Avalanche is the indie music CD store to beat all others. It’s small
and cramped (near Queen Street Station), but is the best for the
latest releases by everybody from the White Stripes to local stars
Belle & Sebastian and up-and-comers. 34 Dundas St. (% 0141-332-
2099).
 Fopp is Glasgow’s largest independent outlet. It offers one of the
best selections of CDs, ranging from classics to the hottest hits and
including music books and vinyl, too. Fopp also stocks a good
number of re-releases priced at only £5 ($9.25). 358 Byres Rd., West
End (% 0141-357-0774). In addition to the West End flagship, 
a larger, multistory branch is in the city center on Union Street 
(% 0141-222-2128).
 Monorail is located within the vegan restaurant and bar called
Mono. This is the most individual of independent CD and record
outlets in the city. Glasgow is full of young musicians, and this shop
specializes in new music from emerging local acts, as well as the
best of cutting-edge bands from elsewhere. 10 King St. (% 0141-
553-2400).
Living It Up after Dark
Today, some say that Glasgow — and not Edinburgh — is the center of
contemporary culture in Scotland. It’s an arguable, not to say locally
controversial, point of view. There’s no doubt that Glasgow has seen the
most progress since the middle of the 20th century, when the shipping
and industrial boom began to go bust, creating an image of profound
decline. It was reversed throughout the 1980s. Even during periods of
decline, however, Glasgow’s local arts scene was always alive.
But ultimately, the truth is this: Both cities contribute mightily — and
equally — to the cultural vibrancy of the nation. Their strength as a pair
of lively cities is considerably more significant than debating which has
the most to offer individually. With this idea in mind, the country would
do well to improve the public transportation links between the two
Chapter 12: Glasgow 239

cities, especially in the wee small hours. Nightlife in both Edinburgh and
Glasgow would benefit if officials made it easier to move between the
two city centers after dark.
Although the Scottish capital to the east is home to the country’s
national art galleries and museums, Glasgow is where the national opera
and ballet companies, as well as the Scottish National Orchestra, are
based. It’s also the city where young talent is nurtured at the Royal
Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Additionally, Glasgow is home
to several theaters, including two that rank highly across the U.K. for
staging groundbreaking drama: the Citizens and the Tron. Even more
experimental performance can be seen at the Arches and Tramway.
The performing arts
Although hardly competition for a drama giant like London, Glasgow’s
theater scene is the equal of Edinburgh’s. Young Scottish playwrights
often make their debuts here, and among the classics, you’re likely to
see anything from Beckett’s Waiting for Godot to The Marriage of Figaro.
 The Arches is located within the vaulted brick arches beneath the
railway lines in and out of Central Station. The venue, which marked
its 17th year in 2008, offers a range of inexpensive drama and 
performances — ranging from edgy new plays to Shakespeare — by
its own unit as well as visiting companies. But the Arches also has
space for a fairly full schedule of live music of all description, regu-
lar dance clubs, and visual art exhibits. The cafe/bar at the Arches
is, like the one at the Traverse in Edinburgh, a scene unto itself.
Tickets are £4 to £10 ($7.40–$19). 253 Argyle St. (% 0141-565-1023;
www.thearches.co.uk; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Citizens Theatre is perhaps the prime symbol of Glasgow’s verve
and democratic approach to theater. Located in Gorbals, just
across the River Clyde from the Commercial Centre area of
Glasgow, the “Citz” is home to a repertory company and has three
performance spaces: a main auditorium and two smaller theaters.
In 2004, artistic director Jeremy Raison made his debut. Ticket
prices are always reasonable: £5 to £15 ($9.25–$28). 119 Gorbals St.
(% 0141-429-0022; www.citz.co.uk; Bus: 5, 12, 20, or 66).
 Glasgow Royal Concert Hall is the home of the Royal Scottish
National Orchestra, which plays its yearly winter/spring series and
pops seasons in the main auditorium. Very little is subtle about this
modern music hall, which is the most prestigious performance space
in the city for everything from touring ballet companies to pop/rock
acts such as Elvis Costello or Jackson Browne. The hall also pro-
duces the city’s annual Celtic Connections festival every January.
Tickets are £10 to £35 ($19–$65). 2 Sauchiehall St. (% 0141-353-8000;
www.grch.com; Underground: Buchanan St.).
 The King’s Theatre celebrated its 100th birthday in 2004. This mag-
nificent, red-sandstone hall is the place where famous touring
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
240

Broadway and West End spectacles, such as Miss Saigon, are likely
to appear — as well as locally produced popular and light enter-
tainment, whether comedies, musicals, or family-oriented plays.
During December and January, the King’s is best noted for its 
over-the-top pantomime presentations, often starring well-known
Scottish actors. Tickets are £6 to £26 ($11–$48). 297 Bath St. 
(% 0141-240-111; www.theambassadors.com/kings; Train:
Charing Cross; Bus: 16 or 18).
 Pavilion Theatre is, compared to the King’s Theatre, an equally 
historic, if less architecturally distinguished, venue. It specializes 
in family entertainment, variety shows, light drama, tribute acts,
and bands, as well as comedy and occasional modern versions 
of vaudeville (which, as they assure you around here, is still 
alive). The Pavilion is a prime location for pantomime around
Christmastime. Tickets are £10 to £25 ($19–$46). 121 Renfield St.
(% 0141-332-1846; www.paviliontheatre.co.uk; Underground:
Buchanan St.; Bus: 21, 23, or 38).
 Theatre Royal is the home of the ambitious, well-respected (but
also financially beleaguered) Scottish Opera, as well as the increas-
ingly acclaimed Scottish Ballet. Called somewhat exaggeratedly by
the Daily Telegraph “the most beautiful opera theatre in the king-
dom,” the hall also hosts visiting companies from around the
world. Tickets range from £3.50 (standby) to £55 ($6.50–$102). 254
Hope St. (% 0141-332-9000; www.theatreroyalglasgow.com;
Underground: Cowcaddens; Bus: 20, 40, or 41).
 Tramway is a post-industrial, huge hangar of an arts venue and one
of the only places in Glasgow able to stage sprawling performance
art and modern theater, such as Peter Brook’s The Mahabharata,
which came here in the late 1980s. In 2004, however, the city, which
owns Tramway, was controversially considering the option of rent-
ing it to the national ballet company as rehearsal space. In addition
to drama, the former repair shop for the city’s trams houses art
exhibits. Tickets range from £4 to £12 ($7.40–$22). 25 Albert Dr.,
Pollokshields, Southside (% 0141-330-3050; www.tramway.org;
Bus: 38 or 45; Train: Pollokshields East).
 Tron Theatre is housed in a part of the former Tron Church, which
dates back to the 15th century. The venue offers one of Scotland’s
leading stages for new and sometimes experimental dramatic per-
formances. The stage is often the place where contemporary local
companies, such as Cryptic or Vanishing Point, debut works. In
addition to theater, the hall is used for music and dance. The 
Tron also has a modern bar/cafe as well as a beautifully restored
Victorian bar/restaurant serving lunch and dinner, including vege-
tarian dishes, as well as a fine selection of beer and wine. Tickets
are £3 to £20 ($5.55–$37). 63 Trongate (% 0141-552-4267; www.
tron.co.uk; Underground: St. Enoch).

For a complete rundown of what’s happening in the city, pick up a copy
of The List, a biweekly magazine available at all major newsstands and
book shops. The List reviews, previews, and gives the details of arts and
events in Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Comedy
 Jongleurs Comedy Club is a corporate-owned entity from down
south, with more than a dozen venues across the U.K. The cover
charge is £12 ($22). UGC Building, Renfield and Renfrew streets 
(% 0870-787-0707; Underground: Buchanan St.).
 The Stand opened a second venue in Glasgow after starting and
thriving in Edinburgh. Its presence has helped to establish an annual
International Comedy Festival every spring in the city. Usually
Tuesday night, called “Red Raw,” is reserved for amateurs. The cover
charge is £2 to £8 ($3.70–$15). 333 Woodlands Rd. (% 0870-600-
6055; www.thestand.co.uk; Underground: Kelvinbridge).
Folk music
 Oran Mor opened in the summer of 2004 as an ambitious center for
the performing arts, and includes bars and restaurants as well as
different spaces for live music. Byres and Great Western roads 
(% 0870-013-2652; Underground: Hillhead).
 St. Andrew’s in the Square is a sympathetically restored and con-
verted 18th-century church that is now dedicated to folk and tradi-
tional Scottish music. The program includes concerts and ceilidhs
(Scottish country dances) in the main hall upstairs. In the basement,
Café Source serves wholesome Scottish food and hosts regular 
sessions of jazz and Scottish music, which may be rather reveren-
tially enjoyed by the patrons. Tickets are £4 to £8 ($7.40–$15). 1 
St. Andrew’s Sq. (% 0141-548-6020; www.standrewsinthesquare.
com; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Scotia Bar is one pub that frequently offers live music that includes,
but is not solely, folk. The other place of this sort nearby is the
Clutha Vaults. No cover charge is required. 112 Stockwell St. 
(% 0141-552-8681).
Pop, rock, and jazz
 ABC is the newest venue for bands visiting Glasgow. The main hall
has room for about 1,250 people, making it an excellent place to get
a bit closer to the musicians. The building itself dates to 1896 and
reportedly screened the first film ever shown in Scotland, although
it also housed a permanent circus before reverting to a film house
in the 20th century. 300 Sauchiehall St. (% 0870-400-0818;
Underground: Cowcaddens.)
 Barrowland has no seats and may stink of beer, but this former
ballroom is the top place in the city to see visiting bands. The hall
rocks, and groups generally rank it among the best venues in the
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
242

U.K. With room for about 2,000 people, Barrowland isn’t exactly inti-
mate, but if you can withstand the mosh pit, you feel the sweat of
the performers. 244 Gallowgate (% 0141-552-4601; Underground:
St. Enoch; Bus: 40, 62, or 262).
 Carling Academy is a 2,500-capacity ex-Bingo hall that opened as 
a live music venue in 2003. It’s part of a chain that includes the 
legendary Brixton Academy in London, and thus has a booking
strength with touring bands. Pity its corporate sponsor has to be
so prominent in the name. 121 Eglinton Rd. (% 0141-418-3000;
Underground: Bridge St.).
 Grand Ole Opry, a sprawling sandstone building 2.5km (11⁄2 miles)
south of the city center, is the largest club in Europe devoted to
country and western music. (And they love their country and west-
ern music in Glasgow!) The Opry has a bar and dancing (Texas line-
style) on two levels and a chuck-wagon eatery that serves affordable
steaks and other such fare. Performers are usually from the U.K., but
a handful of artists from the States turn up, too. The cover charge is
£3 to £10 ($5.55–$19). 2–4 Govan Rd., Paisley Toll Road (% 0141-429-
5396; Bus: 9 or 54).
 King Tut’s Wah Wah Hut is a crowded rock bar that has been in
business for more than a decade. It’s a good place to check out the
Glasgow music and arts crowd as well as local bands and the occa-
sional international act. Successful Scottish acts such as Teenage
Fan Club got their starts here. The cover is usually about £5
($9.25). 272 St. Vincent St. (% 0141-221-5279; Bus: 9 or 62).
 Nice ’n’ Sleazy books live acts to perform in the dark basement
space. The cover is quite reasonable, but it can get more expensive
if you catch an established act, such as ex frontman for the
Lemonheads, Evan Dando. Holding some 200 patrons, it provides a
rare opportunity to catch such musicians in an intimate setting.
The cover charge is £5 to £20 ($9.25–$37). 421 Sauchiehall St. 
(% 0141-333-9637; Bus: 18 or 44; Train: Charing Cross).
 The Scottish Exhibition & Conference Centre, which incorporates
the slightly more intimate Clyde Auditorium (also called the
“Armadillo” because of its exterior design), may be somewhat
charmless, but it provides Scotland with the only indoor space
large enough to host major touring acts, from Ozzy Osbourne to
Justin Timberlake. Finnieston Quay (% 0141-275-6211; www.secc.
co.uk). Train: Exhibition Centre.
Dance clubs
 Bamboo is a stylish basement club with three distinct rooms, one
of which is a rather posh cocktail lounge. One room, the Disco
Badger club of house and R&B music, gets good notices. Bamboo 
is open daily from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. The cover charge is £5 to £8
($9.25–$15). 51 West Regent St. (% 0141-332-1067; Underground:
Buchanan St.).
Chapter 12: Glasgow 243

 Fury Murry’s draws a mostly younger crowd that’s looking for
nothing more complicated than a good, sometimes rowdy time 
listening to upbeat disco. It’s a short walk from the St. Enoch
Shopping Centre and is open Thursday through Sunday from 
10:30 p.m. to 3:30 a.m. The cover charge is £2 to £6 ($3.70–$11). 
96 Maxwell St. (% 0141-221-6511; Underground: St. Enoch).
Some top bars and pubs
Finally, you have the city’s many pubs and bars to consider. Most are
friendly places where the locals are likely to strike up a conversation
with you. A fine night out trawling the city’s many drinking holes is not
only entertaining, it can prove to be educational as well.
Pubs and bars are concentrated in the City Centre, Merchant City, and
the West End. Hours vary, but most stay open to 11 p.m. or midnight on
weeknights, and many have license to remain open until 1 a.m. on the
weekends.
 Babbity Bowster is a civilized place for a pint, with no pounding
soundtrack of mindless pop to distract you from conversation. The
wine selection is good, and the food is worth sampling as well.
Some outdoor seating (although it’s rarely in full sun) is also avail-
able. Every Saturday from about 4 p.m. on, folk musicians arrive for
spontaneous jamming. Drinks are served daily from noon to mid-
night, food until about 10 p.m. 16 Blackfriars St. (% 0141-552-5055;
Underground: Buchanan St.).
 Bar 10 is perhaps the granddaddy of the Glasgow-style bar, but since
opening it has mellowed into a comfortable place for drinking. The
groovy design is still apparent but more important are the good mix
of folk and the convenient City Centre location just opposite the
Lighthouse architecture center on tiny Mitchell Lane. Comfort food
is served from noon to about 5 p.m. Drinks are served Monday
through Saturday from noon to midnight and Sunday from 12:30 p.m.
to midnight. The place gets even livelier when DJs spin on the week-
ends. 10 Mitchell Lane (% 0141-572-1448; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Blackfriars has a decent selection of rotating beers, including some
from the Continent, even though real ales are less plentiful in
Glasgow than in Edinburgh. Jazz is featured in Blackfriars’ basement
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow

Late-night eats
Famished at four minutes past midnight? Several Indian restaurants are open until 1
a.m., but a couple trump the lot by staying open until 4 a.m. Charcoals is in the city
center (26 Renfield St.; % 0141-221-9251), while Spice Gardens is on the southern
bank of the River Clyde (Clyde Place near Bridge Street; % 0141-429-4422).

space on Saturdays and Sundays. Drinks are served Monday through
Saturday from noon to midnight and Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to mid-
night. 36 Bell St. (% 0141-552-5924; Underground: St. Enoch).
 Bon Accord is an amiable pub that’s the best in the city for hand-
pulled cask-conditioned real ale. The pub boasts an array of hand-
pumps — a dozen are devoted to real English and Scottish ales, and
the rest of the draft and bottled beers and stouts hail from the
Czech Republic, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and Holland. The pub
is likely to satisfy your taste in malt whisky as well, and offers
affordable pub food. Bon Accord is open Monday through Saturday
from noon to midnight and Sunday from noon to 11 p.m. 153 North
St. (% 0141-248-4427; Bus: 6, 8, or 16; Train: Charing Cross).
 Brel is possibly the best of the West End’s trendy Ashton Lane’s
many pubs and bars. Brel has a Belgian theme, with beers and cui-
sine favoring that country, but it’s not overplayed. The music
policy is eclectic, with DJs and live acts adding atmosphere to the
former stables. The bar is open daily from 10 a.m. to midnight.
Food is served Monday through Friday from noon to 3 p.m. and 5 
to 10:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday from noon to 10:30 p.m. 39–43
Ashton Lane (% 0141-342-4966; Underground: Hillhead).
 Heraghty’s Free House, on the city’s Southside, is the real McCoy
among Glasgow’s trendy Irish-themed pubs. It serves up perfect
pints of Guinness and Irish craic (banter) in almost equal portions.
No food, though. Heraghty’s is open Monday through Thursday from
11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday from 11 a.m. to midnight, and
Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. 708 Pollokshaws Rd. (% 0141-423-
0380; Bus: 38, 45, or 56).
 The Horse Shoe is the pub you should hit if you can only visit one
in Glasgow (and I’m hoping that’s not the case). It’s one of the last
remaining “Palace Pubs” that opened around the turn of the 20th
century. The circular, island bar is one of the longest in Europe.
Drinks are inexpensive and so is the food from the upstairs buffet.
Karaoke draws crowds to the second-floor lounge every night of the
week, but conversation and football on the televisions provide the
entertainment in the main bar. Drinks are served Monday through
Saturday from noon to midnight and Sunday from 12:30 p.m. to mid-
night. The buffet is open daily until 7:30 p.m., except on Sunday
when it closes down at 5 p.m. 17 Drury St. (% 0141-229-5711;
Underground: St. Enoch).
 Liquid Ship is a fairly recent addition to the West End scene. Owned
by the same people who run Stravaigin (p. 212), Liquid Ship is unpre-
tentious and smart but not precisely stylish, with the main bar up a
few steps and a lounge in the basement. Drinks are served Monday
through Thursday from noon to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday from
noon to midnight, and Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. Food, platters,
and tasty sandwiches on toasted Italian bread are served daily from
noon until about 8 p.m. 171 Great Western Rd. (% 0141-331-1901;
Underground: St. George’s Cross).
Chapter 12: Glasgow 245

 Lismore Bar in Partick is tastefully decorated in a modern manner
that still recognizes traditional Highland culture. The whisky selec-
tion is good, and at £1.50 ($2.80) for a dram, the malt of the month
is always a bargain. The lounge features live Scottish and Gaelic
music Tuesday and Thursday nights. The bar is open Sunday
through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. and Friday and Saturday
from 11 a.m. to midnight. No food is served. 206 Dumbarton Rd. 
(% 0141-576-0103; Underground: Kelvinhall).
 The Pot Still is the best place for sampling malt whiskies. You can
taste from a selection of hundreds and hundreds of them, in a variety
of styles (peaty or sweet), strengths, and maturities (that is, years
spent in casks). The Pot Still is open Monday through Thursday from
noon to 11 p.m., Friday and Saturday from noon to midnight, and
Sunday from 12:30 to 11 p.m. 154 Hope St. (% 0141-333-0980;
Underground: Buchanan St.).
 Vroni’s Wine Bar is for those who favor the grape over the grain,
Bordeaux to brown ale, Sancerre over cider. The feeling of this small
bar is Continental, with banquette seating and candlelit tables. It’s
open Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to midnight and Sunday
from 12:30 p.m. to midnight, and food is served Monday through
Thursday from noon to 7 p.m. and until 3 p.m. on Friday. 47 W. Nile
St. (% 0141-221-4677; Underground: Buchanan St.).
 WEST is both a brewery and a bar based on Munich beer halls. In
the basement they produce the best, freshest lager in Scotland, 
following strict German laws for purity and using chemical-free
processes. Food leans toward Bavarian dishes, with dumplings,
sauerkraut, and meaty mains, with some vegetarian options, too.
Drinks are served from noon to midnight; food until about 9 p.m.
Binnie Place, Glasgow Green. (% 0141-550-0135; Bus: 16, 43, or 64).

Gay and lesbian Glasgow
Glasgow and its environs are said to have the largest concentration of gays and les-
bians in the U.K. outside of London. But there’s no identifiable district in the city where
the gay and lesbian community is particularly concentrated, although part of the
Merchant City has been dubbed the “gay triangle.” The Polo Lounge, 84 Wilson St.,
offers a gay but hetero-friendly club often described as a cross between an urbane
gentleman’s club and a Highland country lodge. It’s open daily from 5 p.m. to 1 a.m.
(until 3 a.m. on Fri and Sat). A £5 ($9.25) cover is charged after 10 p.m. or so. Nearby,
Revolver Bar, on John Street, is gay-owned and -operated. The bar has always tried
to be a bit more grown-up and to dismiss some of the more cheesy and stereotypical
elements of the gay scene. But that doesn’t mean that it’s not fun or popular.
Conversation generally rules, but the jukebox is free. Drinks are served daily from noon
to midnight.

American Express
The city office has moved to 66 Gordon St.
(% 0141-225-2905). It is open Monday

Business Hours
Most offices are open Monday through

5 p.m., with some branches sometimes
closing early on one day a week and open-
ing late on another. Opening times can vary
slightly from bank to bank. Shops are gen-
erally open Monday through Sunday from

The tourist office at 11 George Sq. (% 0141-
204-4400) and the American Express office
(see listing earlier) exchange major foreign
currencies. Thomas Cook operates a 
currency exchange at Central Station (gen-
erally open until 6 p.m.). Many banks in the
city center operate a bureaux de change,
too, and nearly all banks cash traveler’s
checks if you have the proper ID. Most
ATMs in the city center can also draw
money directly from your bank account 
at home.
Dentists
In an emergency, go to the Accident and
Emergency Department of Glasgow Dental

to £6.80 ($8.35–$13). 7 Renfrew St. (% 0871-200-2000; www.ugc
cinemas.co.uk; Underground: Buchanan St.).
 Glasgow Film Theatre has two screens for a well-programmed
daily output of independent, foreign, repertory, and art-house films.
The building was originally the Cosmo, an Art Deco cinema built in
the late 1930s. Within the building, Café Cosmo is good for a pre- or
post-theater beverage. Tickets are £3 to £5 ($5.55–$9.25). 12 Rose
St. (% 0141-332-8128; www.gft.org.uk; Underground: Buchanan

Safety
While Glasgow may be the most dangerous
city in Scotland, it’s relatively safe when
compared to cities of its size in the United
States. Muggings do occur, and often
they’re related to Glasgow’s drug problem.
The famed razor gangs of Calton, Bridgeton,
and the Gorbals are no longer around to
earn the city a reputation for violence, but
you still should stay alert.

 Discovering highlights of East Lothian

 Seeing New Lanark’s groundbreaking workers’ village
 Visiting the quintessential Mackintosh-designed house
I
don’t think that you’ll get bored in either Edinburgh or Glasgow, but
there are other attractions, located near both cities, that are worth
your time, too.
First Edinburgh: Although it has a full complement of attractions and
plenty of activities to entertain visitors, you can find some other worth-
while destinations nearby, outside the city. The closest regions are West
and East Lothian, located on either side of the city. The highlights in
these areas include the impressive ruins of Linlithgow Palace, a favorite
of the Stuart dynasty, and the seaside town of North Berwick, with its
views of Bass Rock.
From Glasgow, day-trippers can easily reach Helensburgh on the Firth of
Clyde and visit one of architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh’s remarkable
achievements, Hill House. By going up river (that’s south, by the way)
into the Clyde Valley, day-trippers can also visit New Lanark.
In addition to the places I mention here, you can see a good deal of the
attractions in Chapters 14, 15, and 16 on day trips from Scotland’s two
major cities. So, if you’re staying in one of the cities, your options are
diverse.
East Lothian
As the largest town in the area, the royal burgh of North Berwick (the
“w” is silent) — where the Firth of Forth meets the North Sea — is a
good place to kick off a day trip. The town dates to the 14th century; in

Day Trips from Glasgow
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
252
the more modern Victorian and Edwardian times, it was rebuilt to serve
as an up-market holiday resort, drawing visitors to its beaches, harbor,
and golf courses.
Getting there
About 36km (21 miles) east of Edinburgh, North Berwick is on a direct
rail line from Edinburgh; the trip takes about 30 minutes. Standard one-
way fare is about £4.50 ($8.30). Bus service from Edinburgh takes a bit
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 

over an hour. An all-day ticket to North Berwick and the region around it
costs around £5.50 ($10). If you’re driving, take the coastal road east
from Leith, or use the A1 (marked THE SOUTH and DUNBAR), to the A198 (via
Gullane) to North Berwick.
Orienting yourself
At North Berwick’s tourist office on Quality Street (% 01620-892-197),
you can get information on boat trips to offshore islands, including Bass
Rock, a breeding ground inhabited by about 10,000 gannets (the second
largest colony in Scotland) as well as puffins and other birds. You can see
the rock from the harbor, but the viewing is even better at Berwick Law,
an eroded, once-volcanic lookout point that rises up behind the town.
Seeing the sights
Dirleton Castle and Garden
Dirleton
Run by Historic Scotland, Dirleton Castle dates to the 13th century. The
surrounding gardens — for some visitors, the main attraction — are appar-
ently just as ancient. The ruins are reputed to have been completely
sacked in 1650 by Cromwell, but another story holds that the building was
only partially destroyed by his army and was further torn down by a local
family. After building nearby Archerfield House in the 1660s, the Nisbit
family desired a romantic ruin on their land, and they secured the ruins of
the old castle. Highlights include the imposing gate house, vaulted
arcades, and a 16th-century dovecot that resembles a beehive. The
grounds include a herbaceous border that Guinness ranks as longest in
the world. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 251. On the A198, 5km (2 miles) west of North Berwick. % 01620-850-330.
www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £4.70 ($8.70) adults, £3.70 ($6.85)
seniors, £2.35 ($4.35) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.;
Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Chapter 13: Going Beyond Edinburgh and Glasgow: Day Trips 253
Dirleton: Prettiest village in Scotland?
Dirleton, midway between North Berwick and Gullane, is one of the prettiest villages
in Scotland. In fact, its quaintness and beauty make it seem almost surreal.
Undoubtedly high levels of home maintenance make each cottage here look as if it’s
waiting to be photographed. Because the main road bypasses the village, there’s very
little traffic. Even the railway station is closed — the last train ran through Dirleton in
the mid-1950s. The biggest event for Dirleton occurred in the 1940s, when President
Roosevelt and Sir Winston Churchill met here to plan D-Day landings.

Scottish Seabird Centre
North Berwick
From this popular attraction, situated on a craggy outcropping in North
Berwick, you can watch all the bird action out on Bass Rock, whether gan-
nets and puffins, as well as guillemots on the island of Fidra or colonies of
seals, thanks to live video links — or in modern parlance: “Big Brother”
cameras. The Seabird Centre also has a cafe/bistro and activities geared to
the family. Allow two hours.
See map p. 251. The Harbour, North Berwick. % 01620-890-202. www.seabird.
org. Admission: £7.95 ($15) adults, £5.95 ($11) seniors and students, £4.50 ($8.30) chil-
dren 4–15. Open: Apr–Sept daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.; Nov–Jan Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–4 p.m. and
Sat–Sun 10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Feb–Mar and Oct Mon–Fri 10 a.m.–5 p.m. and Sat–Sun 
10 a.m.–5:30 p.m.
Tantallon Castle
Tantallon
After its construction in the 14th century, on a bluff right above the sea,
this became the stronghold of the powerful and somewhat trouble-making
Douglas family — the Earls of Angus, who tended to side with England in
their wars and disputes with Scotland in the 15th and 16th centuries. Both
Stuart kings James IV and James V dispatched troops to Tantallon. Like
most castles in the region, it endured a fair number of sieges, but the
troops of Oliver Cromwell fully sacked it in the mid-1600s. Nevertheless,
the ruins remain formidable, with a square five-story central tower. Allow
one hour.
See map p. 251. On the A198, about 3.2km (2 miles) east of North Berwick. % 01620-
892-727. www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £4.70 ($8.70) adults, £3.70
($6.85) seniors, £2.35 ($4.35) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.;
Oct daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Nov–Mar Sat–Wed 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
254
Dunbar: Birthplace of John Muir
The man who put the Yosemite Valley of California on the map, founded the Sierra Club,
and single-handedly established the national park system in the United States was
born April 21, 1838, in the humble harbor town of Dunbar, about 15km (9 miles) south-
east of North Berwick. Scots have been rather slow to capitalize on John Muir’s inter-
national stature and to celebrate the life of the explorer, naturalist, and groundbreaking
conservationist. But a trust operating in his name is having an impact on preserving
natural habitats across Scotland today. In Dunbar, you can visit his birthplace (126
High St.; % 01368-865-899; www.jmbt.org.uk), which now houses a museum
about Muir, his travels, and his work. It is a modest, locally run museum, but if you’re
a fan of John Muir and appreciate the environmental movement, then a visit here is
merited.

Dining locally
La Potinière
$$$
Gullane
FRENCH
This rather legendary restaurant, which once had a Michelin star, closed
briefly but found new owners, chefs Keith Marley and Mary Runciman, in
2003. The set-price lunches and dinners offer dishes that are French-
inspired, using seasonal produce that is usually purchased locally, with
everything freshly made on the premises.
See map p. 251. Main Street, Gullane. % 01620-843-214. www.la-potiniere.co.
uk. Fixed-price meals: Lunch £19 ($35); dinner £40 ($74). MC, V. Open: Wed–Sun noon
to 1:30 p.m. and 7–8:30 p.m. Closed Mon–Tues and Sun nights Oct–May.
West Lothian
For tourists, the principal town of this region west of Edinburgh is
Linlithgow, where Mary Queen of Scots was born in 1542. Linlithgow’s
ancient palace is the main attraction. Falkirk is a central market town
farther west, while South Queensferry sits on the south banks of the
Forth River.
Chapter 13: Going Beyond Edinburgh and Glasgow: Day Trips 255
Gullane and Muirfield Golf Course
Situated about 8km (5 miles) west of North Berwick and some 28km (16 miles) east of
Edinburgh, Gullane (pronounced gill-in by many, gull-an by others) is another Scottish
resort town with a fine beach and a famous golf course. On the edge of the village,
Gullane Hill is a nature sanctuary where over 100 species of birds have been spotted.
You cross a small wood footbridge from the car park to enter the reserve. Gullane
doesn’t get any direct rail service; the nearest station is about 4km (21⁄2 miles) south in
Drem. Buses depart to Gullane from the Edinburgh bus terminal near St. Andrew’s
Square (% 0800-232-323 for information) and take about one hour.
Muirfield Golf Course (% 01620-842-123) is ranked among the world’s great golf
courses, and as such, it has hosted the Open Championship in Great Britain. Muirfield
is the home course of the Honorable Company of Edinburgh Golfers — the world’s
oldest golf club — which began at Leith Links in Edinburgh. Developed on a boggy
piece of low-lying land in 1891, Muirfield was originally a 16-hole course designed by
the legendary Old Tom Morris. Visitors with certified handicaps can play Muirfield on
Tuesdays and Thursdays. Greens fees are £145 ($268) for a single round and £180 ($333)
for the day. Peak times book quickly, but the course usually has availability from mid-
October to the end of March.

Getting there
Linlithgow is only about 26km (16 miles) west of Edinburgh. Trains
depart frequently from Edinburgh Waverley Station for the 20-minute
ride. A standard round-trip ticket costs about £6.50 ($12). If you’re driv-
ing from Edinburgh, follow the M8 toward Glasgow, take exit 2 onto the
M9, and follow the signs to Linlithgow.
Orienting yourself
The tourist information center is on the road that leads up to the palace.
It’s open daily from Easter through October.
Seeing the sights
Hopetoun House
Near South Queensferry
On the margins of South Queensferry, amid beautifully landscaped
grounds, Hopetoun House is one of Scotland’s best examples of 18th-cen-
tury palatial Georgian architecture, featuring design work by Sir William
Bruce — and by no less than three members of the architecturally inclined
Adam family. You can wander through splendid reception rooms filled with
period furniture, Renaissance paintings, statuary, and other artworks. The
views of the Firth of Forth are panoramic from the rooftop observation
deck. After touring the house, visitors should try to take in the grounds,
some 60 hectares (150 acres) of parkland with a walled garden, shorefront
trail, and deer park. Last entry is one hour before closing. Allow two hours.
See map p. 251. Off the A904, near South Queensferry, 3km (2 miles) from the Forth
Road Bridge. % 0131-331-2451. www.hopetounhouse.com. Admission: £8 ($15)
adults, £7 ($13) seniors and students, £4.25 ($7.85) children 5–16, £22 ($41) family.
Open: Apr–Sept daily 10:30 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Oct–Mar.

256
Rosslyn Chapel: The Da Vinci Code
connection
Thanks in no small part to Dan Brown’s blockbuster novel The Da Vinci Code, and the
Hollywood film by the same name, the elaborately carved Rosslyn Chapel, south of
Edinburgh, is firmly on the trail of those who seek to retrace the historic and mythical
path of the Knights Templar. Visitor numbers swelled because of the movie, part of
which was filmed here. Sir William St. Clair founded the chapel in 1446, and it has been
long noted for its architectural and design idiosyncrasies (though not all of those men-
tioned in Brown’s fictional tome). The attraction is easily reached from Edinburgh via
the A701, which runs south from Edinburgh. For more information, opening hours, and
ticket prices call % 0131-440-2159 or log on to www.rosslynchapel.org.uk.

Linlithgow Palace
Linlithgow
The birthplace of Mary Queen of Scots, this was a favorite residence of
Scottish royalty in the 15th and 16th centuries. It is now one of the Scotland’s
most poignant ruins, set on the shores of Linlithgow Loch. Enough of the
royal rooms are still intact so that visitors can get an idea of how grand the
palace once was. It is a landmark bit of architecture — the first building to
be called a palace in Scotland — and a romantic touchstone of Scottish his-
tory and lore. On this site, the English king Edward I occupied a tower house
in the 14th century, but Scots who had hidden in a load of hay retook it in
1313. Most of the palace was built by Scotland’s King James I from 1425 to
1437. In 1513, Queen Margaret (a Tudor by birth) waited in vain here for hus-
band James IV to return from the battle of Flodden. When their son, James
V, also born here, wed Mary of Guise, the palace fountain ran with wine. In
1746, fire gutted the building when government troops who routed Bonnie
Prince Charlie at Culloden were barracked in Linlithgow. Last admission 45
minutes before closing. Allow two hours.
See map p. 251. On A706, on the south shore Linlithgow Loch, Linlithgow. % 01506-
842-896. www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £5.20 ($9.60) adults,
£4.20 ($7.75) seniors and students, £2.60 ($4.80) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Sept daily
9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
St. Michael’s Parish Church
Linlithgow
Next to Linlithgow Palace stands the medieval kirk of St. Michael, site of
worship for many a Scottish monarch after its consecration in 1242. The
biggest pre-Reformation parish church in Scotland, it was mostly con-
structed in the 15th century. In St. Catherine’s Aisle, just before the battle
of Flodden, King James IV apparently saw an apparition warning him
against fighting the English. Perhaps he should have listened. Despite
being ravaged by the disciples of John Knox (who actually chided follow-
ers for their “excesses”) and transformed into a stable by Cromwell’s
forces, this remains one of Scotland’s best examples of a parish church.
While providing a dramatic focal point on the landscape, the aluminum
spears projecting from the tower were added in the 1960s. Allow one hour.

Champany Corner
SCOTTISH
You find some of the best steaks in Britain here. The restaurant also serves
oysters, salmon, and lobsters, but beef is the main reason people dine
here. Next to the main dining room is the Chop House, offering somewhat
less expensive cuts in a more casual atmosphere within the establishment.
The wine list — some 2,000 bottles long — has won an award for excel-
lence from Wine Spectator magazine.
See map p. 251. On the A904, 3km (2 miles) northeast of Linlithgow at Champany

courses: £18–£33 ($33–$61). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Mon–Fri 12:30–2 p.m. and 7–10 p.m.;
Sat 7–10 p.m. Main restaurant closed Sun (Chop House open noon to 10p.m.).
The Clyde Valley
From its headwaters well south of Glasgow, the River Clyde meanders
north toward the city and then west to the sea. The Clyde Valley south of
the city is best known locally for its garden nurseries and their sometimes-
quaint tea shops. Near the town of Lanark, however, you can find a bona
fide bit of history and an attraction that merits a day trip.
Getting there
You can take the train to Lanark from Central Station in Glasgow. 
Trains depart Glasgow twice an hour and the trip takes about one hour.
Standard same-day round-trip fare is about £8 ($15). Buses for Lanark
leave Buchanan Bus Station hourly and the journey takes about 75 min-
utes. The price of a round-trip ticket is about £5 ($9.25). By car, drive via
the M74 motorway, following the signs from exit 9.
Seeing the sights
New Lanark
Near Lanark
Founded first in 1784, New Lanark, by the early part of the 19th century,
was a progressive industrial mill and village under the guidance of Robert
Owen, who decided that a contented work force was most likely to be a
productive one. With that philosophy in mind, he set up free education for
all employees and their children, a day-care center and social club, and a
cooperative store along the banks of the River Clyde in the steep valley
Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
258

below the long-established market town of Lanark. Today, the New Lanark
Conservation Trust runs the place as a tourist attraction. (It’s also recog-
nized by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.) Admission includes an edu-
cational chair-lift ride that tells the story of what life here was once like,
as well as self-guided tours of the principle buildings, such as the factory
where cotton was spun and the old school house. A walk upstream brings
visitors to the three-tiered Falls of Clyde, worth the hike if you like water-
falls and walking. Allow two hours.
See map p. 252. Braxfield Road, outside Lanark. % 01555-661-345. www.new
lanark.org. Admission £5.95 ($11) adults, £4.95 ($9.15) children and seniors, £18
($33) family. Open: Daily 11 a.m.–5 p.m.
West of Glasgow
West of Glasgow, the Clyde widens as it empties into the sea. To get to
places west, take the train that runs almost every half-hour from Queen
Street Station or head out on the M8 motorway, crossing the river at
Erskine and following the northern shoreline. The area doesn’t boast a
lot of attractions, but the drive can be very pretty, and in Helensburgh,
the Mackintosh trail leads to the architect and designer’s wonderful Hill
House.
Glenarn Garden
Rhu (near Helensburgh)
Nestled in a protective hollow, Glenarn is a private garden, established by
the Gibson family in the early decades of the 20th century. The rhodo-
dendron collection is superb; in early spring, the flowering magnolias can
be absolutely stunning. A large rock garden has also been built around an
unused quarry. Allow one hour.

Hill House
Helensburgh
Designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh for publisher Walter Blackie, this
timeless house, set on the hill above the town of Helensburgh (about
48km/30 miles west of Glasgow), has been lovingly restored and opened to
the public by the National Trust for Scotland. Inspired by the Scottish
Baronial style, Hill House is still pure Mackintosh: from the asymmetrical
juxtaposition of windows and clean lines that blend sharp geometry and
gentle curves to the sumptuous but uncluttered interior, with custom-
made details (such as glass inlays, fireplace tiles, and decorative panels)
by both the architect and his artist wife, Margaret Macdonald. Practically
the entire house, built at the beginning of the 20th century, is open to the
public. The garden, overgrown when the National Trust took over the
Chapter 13: Going Beyond Edinburgh and Glasgow: Day Trips 259

property in the early 1980s, has been restored to its original state thanks
to photographs of the original garden taken in 1905 for a German design
magazine. Allow two hours.
See map p. 252. Upper Colquhoun Street, off the B832, Helensburgh. % 01436-673-

Newark Castle
Port Glasgow
One of the few castles still standing in this part of Scotland, Newark dates
to the 15th century. Its most prominent resident was Patrick Maxwell, who
made notable additions to the castle but went down in history as a bully
who murdered a couple of neighbors and regularly beat his wife. Nice chap,
eh? You can see a good deal of this well-preserved castle, from the tower
house, built in 1478, to a wood-paneled sleeping chamber and the high ceil-
ings of the main hall, in addition to the old gate house. Allow one hour.
See map p. 252. On the A8, Port Glasgow. % 01475-741-858. www.historic-

Part III: Edinburgh and Glasgow 
260

Part IV
The Major Regions

In this part . . . 
Some travelers just visit Edinburgh and Glasgow (dis-
cussed in Part III) and stop there. That’s okay, but if you
have more time, you really should get out and about and dis-
cover some of the rest of the “real” Scotland — whether the
medieval abbeys of southern Scotland, the picturesque ports
of Argyll and in the Hebrides, or the sweeping vistas and
rugged countryside of the Highlands and Hebridean islands.
Part IV focuses in on the major regions of Scotland. In the
chapters that follow, you can ﬁnd out about each region’s
best attributes — from harbor towns, whisky distilleries, and
world-class golf to ancient castles, loch cruises, and largely
unspoiled islands. Each chapter has invaluable suggestions
on how to get there and get around, which attractions to see,
and, of course, where to stay and dine.

Chapter 14
Southern Scotland
In This Chapter
 Finding the best places to stay and eat
 Discovering the home of Sir Walter Scott
 Seeing the famous Borders abbeys
 Visiting one of the most picturesque ports in Scotland
R
ichly historic southern Scotland is predominantly rural, with vast
open spaces used for grazing livestock such as the famous black-
face lamb. The area consists of two administrative districts: the Borders,
aptly named as it borders England, and the combined regions of
Dumfries (dum-freese) and Galloway in the southwest. Because most
tourists enter Scotland by plane or train, arriving in either Glasgow or
Edinburgh, many tend to travel through southern Scotland rather than
journey to the region. But there are good reasons to visit here.
Sure, the area isn’t as impressive as the Highlands (see Chapter 18)
when it comes to natural beauty. Still, the southern part of the country
offers attractions that make a trip here worthwhile: stately homes and
the ruins of 12th-century abbeys, quaint towns, meandering rivers, and a
ruggedly scenic peninsula that faces onto the Irish Sea.
Southern Scotland has no regional capital, per se, nor even a bona fide
city. The main towns include Melrose, Jedburgh, and Galashiels in the
Borders, southeast of Edinburgh; Dumfries and Stranraer are the main
hubs southcentral and southwest of Glasgow, respectively.
Ideally, you could take two or three days to cover southern Scotland. But
certain attractions are within striking distance for day trips from either
Edinburgh or Glasgow, depending on how long you allow your “day” to
be. For example, the drive from Glasgow to the town of Kirkcudbright
takes about two hours or so.
Getting There
Buses and (to a much lesser extent) trains run from Edinburgh to south-
ern Scotland. Cutbacks in the 1960s eliminated rail service that used to
penetrate the Borders interior, but one line is to be reopened. Until then,

however, train service to the Borders is limited to the east coast main
line that runs from the Scottish capital to Berwick on Tweed, just across
the boundary in England.
Buses and trains from Glasgow head south into Dumfries and Galloway,
with a western railway line terminating at the sea port Stranraer and the
more central route continuing through Dumfries out of Scotland to
Carlisle. To plan a trip by public transportation, call Traveline Scotland
at % 0871-200-2233 or use its Web site www.travelinescotland.com.
A car is probably the best mode of transportation to cover southern
Scotland.
 By car: From Edinburgh, take the A68 toward Jedburgh, the A1
along the east coast, or, farther west, the A701 to the M74. From
Glasgow, the M74 runs south to Moffat, where the A701 continues
to the town of Dumfries. You can also get to Dumfries by taking the
A76, via Cumnock. If your destination is Galloway, take the A77
south via Ayr and Girvan. If you want to experience the area from
England, the M1 to Newcastle links to the A1 or the A68 (via the
A69). Coming from northwest England and the Lake District, take
the M6 north to the M74 in Carlisle. Cross-country roads from
Stranraer to Galashiels are predominantly two-lane routes with a
good bit of twists and turns.
 By bus: Scotland towns are linked by various bus companies that
seem to trade routes every couple of years. National Express
(% 08705-808-080; www.nationalexpress.com) has buses that
run to Southern Scotland from England. Service from Edinburgh
south into the Borders is operated by First Edinburgh (% 08708-
727-271; www.firstgroup.com).
 By train: First ScotRail (% 08457-484-950; www.firstscotrail.
com) travels to towns in the region, including Berwick on Tweed,
Dumfries, and Stranraer. A typical one-way fare from Glasgow to
Stranraer is about £17 ($31).
 By ferry: Stena Line (% 0870-1129-374; www.stenaline.ferries.
org) runs ferry services between Stranraer harbor and Belfast port
in Northern Ireland.
Spending the Night
The selections I list below offer some of the best accommodations in the
region. All are moderate to expensive, which is typical for southern
Scotland, and the hotels offer dinner and full bars for a friendly pint or
nightcap. Some have earned star ratings from the tourist board (see
Chapter 8 for a description of the rating system). Rates include full
breakfast unless otherwise stated. And remember: You may well get a
better deal than the advertised “rack” rates.

Burts Hotel

Melrose
Within walking distance of Melrose Abbey, this family-run inn was built in
1722 to house a local dignitary. The traditional exterior offers a taste of
small-town Scotland, although much of the interior décor is modern, with
an airy and restful feel. All 20 guest rooms are well furnished and equipped
with shower-only bathrooms. The restaurant menu offers main courses
such as baked halibut with crab and pea risotto, and in addition to the
more formal dining room, Burt’s serves meals in the bistro/bar. Alternative
accommodations are offered across the street at the Townhouse Hotel,
with double rooms starting at £114 ($211).

Cairndale Hotel & Leisure Club

Dumfries
This early-20th-century resort hotel with a stone facade is a good place for
a little R&R. The rooms are comfortable, but the best features here are the
spa and heated indoor pool. The hotel has 91 units, with 22 suitable for
family accommodations. An added conference facility is designed to
appeal to a business clientele, but the Cairndale still knows how to treat
vacationing guests right.

Portpatrick
It doesn’t offer the poshest accommodations in this quaint port town, but
the popular and unpretentious Crown is right on the harbor, and the
rooms, some of which have big old-fashioned bathtubs, overlook the sea.
The hotel has a popular local pub, too, so you may prefer a room in the
back to avoid any noise from the bar below.

Kelso
The Ednam House Hotel occupies an impressive location overlooking the
River Tweed. The Georgian mansion, commissioned in 1761, has been
owned and operated by the same family since 1928. The rooms and suites
are decorated in a traditional manner, which maintains the historic feel of
the pile. The hotel also can organize activities and excursions, whether
golfing, fishing, hunting, or heritage tours.

Glenapp Castle
$$$$
Ballantrae
Get out your credit cards and be prepared to pay top dollar to stay at this
beautifully decorated pile near the cute coastal village of Ballantrae.
Glenapp offers guests the royal treatment amid Victorian baronial splen-
dor with antiques, oil paintings, and elegant touches at every turn. The
mansion was designed in the 1870s by David Bryce, a celebrated architect
of his day, and it overlooks the Irish Sea. Lounges and dining rooms are
elegant, and the spacious bedrooms and suites are individually furnished.
Tall windows let in the afternoon and long summer evening light, making
the rooms bright on many days. The hotel, open seasonally unless by spe-
cial arrangement, stands on 12 hectares (30 acres) of lovely, secluded
grounds that are home to many rare plants.

Portpatrick
This luxury hotel with well-manicured lawns and gardens, as well as its
own private pebble beach on a sheltered cove, is a few kilometers south
of Portpatrick. There are nine rooms; in the country manor house tradi-
tion, some of the units feature brass fittings on tubs and tiled fireplaces. In
this tranquil and remote setting, Churchill, Eisenhower, and their staff met
in World War II. They’re not cheap, but meals (included in the price) are
outstanding, the bar excels in its whisky selection, and the kitchen has
earned a Michelin star.

Moffat
This 18th-century mansion sits in the center of a garden in the heart of
Moffat. The handsome stone building is hard to miss, and lovely trees
grace the back garden. Each of the 21 bedrooms is well stocked with
amenities, and the restaurant serves fine Scottish cuisine. A literary foot-
note: It is believed that Poet James MacPherson (thought by some to be
the poet Ossian) wrote his disputed works here.

Peebles
Once a Victorian “hydropathic” hotel that claimed to cure whatever ailed
you with a hot spring and mineral waters, the Peeble’s main features today
remain hydrocentric: a pool for the kids and a whirlpool and sauna for the
adults. The hotel has some spacious family rooms and 12 hectares (30
acres) of grounds for young ones to explore. Of the more than 125 units,
25 are geared toward families. Other activities at this chateau-style hotel
include snooker, pitch-and-putt golf, and badminton.

The Station’s Victorian sandstone building lies near Dumfries’s railroad
station and the center of town. Part of the Best Western group, the com-

certain rustic charm. Don’t worry about being close to the rail lines; there
aren’t any late-night trains.

FISH/SEAFOOD
Facing the crescent-shaped harbor of Portpatrick, this family-run restaurant
is welcoming and relaxed, a favorite of mine during repeated visits to “the

rustic seaport with modernity. Fresh fish is the main reason to eat here, and
the dishes tend to be unfussy and straightforward in presentation.

Exploring Southern Scotland
Among the Borders’ primary attractions are its stately, historic homes and
ancient abbeys. The rolling hills and dense forests of Galloway are attrac-
tive but don’t quite offer the kind of natural splendor found in the
Highlands of Scotland, although the coastal areas are reasonably dramatic
Chapter 14: Southern Scotland 269

and picturesque. The government’s historic preservation society, Historic
Scotland, runs quite a few of the attractions in southern Scotland. I list
several below, but for more details, go to the agency’s Web site, www.
historic-scotland.gov.uk. Don’t feel as if you need to visit each 
and every abbey and castle in the area; pick some representative ones,
enjoy them, and move on.
The top attractions
Abbotsford
Roxburghshire
Abbottsford is the mansion that Sir Walter Scott built and lived in from
1817 until his death. Designed in the Scots baronial style, the house was
constructed on land he acquired in 1811. After his literary works, it is con-
sidered the author’s most enduring monument. Scott was a souvenir
hunter, scouring the land for artifacts associated with the historical char-
acters he rendered into fiction. Hence, Abbotsford contains many relics
and mementos — whether Rob Roy’s sporran or a purse made by Flora
MacDonald. One of his other proud possessions is a sword given to the
duke of Montrose by Charles I for his cooperation (some say collabora-
tion). The home itself has an entrance that mimics the porch at Linlithgow
Palace and a door from Edinburgh’s historic Tolbooth. Especially popular
is Scott’s small study, with writing desk and chair, where he penned some
of his most famous works. There are also extensive gardens and grounds
to visit, plus the private chapel, added after Scott’s death. Allow about two
hours.

Burns House
Dumfries
Most of the Robert Burns Heritage Trail is in Ayrshire (see Chapter 15),
but the poet Burns lived the last bit of his short life in this modest cottage,
where he died at age 37 in 1796. Burns House has been preserved to look
as it did when he resided there for the final few years, and it contains such
articles as Burns’s writing chair as well as some original manuscripts, let-
ters, and printed editions. A highlight is the author’s signature scratched
into a windowpane. Allow about one hour.

Caerlaverock Castle
Near Dumfries
A historic target of English armies in the Wars of Independence, the
uniquely triangular shaped Caerlaverock (ka-liver-ick) is one of Scotland’s
classic Medieval castles, complete with a water-filled moat and twin-
towered gatehouse, as well as some pretty serious battlements — all con-
structed in distinctive red sandstone. It lies in secured ruins today, but
you can still get the sense of what defending this castle may have been
like. A highlight is the interior Renaissance stone carvings of the Nithsdale
Lodging, dating to the 1630s. Walk a way into the nearby woods on the
nature trail to find where an earlier castle stood. Allow about two hours.

Dryburgh Abbey
Near St. Boswells
It’s little wonder that Sir Walter Scott chose to be buried here. The abbey
ruins, now run under the auspices of Historic Scotland, lie amid giant cedar
trees on the banks of the River Tweed. Of the four famed Borders abbeys,
Dryburgh was the largest, arguably the most beautiful, and possibly the
most attacked by English troops, although it’s reasonably well intact today.
Scott was interred in the side chapel in 1832. Allow about one hour.

£4.70 ($8.70) adults, £3.70 ($6.85) seniors and students, £2.35 ($4.35) children 5–15.
Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Floors Castle
Near Kelso
This mansion was built by William Adam for the first duke of Roxburghe in
1721, and it is today still home to the duke (the tenth) and duchess of
Roxburghe. More of a sprawling country house than a proper castle, it can
still claim to be one of the few fully intact and the largest inhabited cas-
tles in all of Scotland. After viewing the impressive art collection indoors
(including paintings by Matisse and Odilon Redon in the Needle Room),
venture out and walk one of the nature trails through the woods or along
the River Tweed. The walled garden also has an “adventure” playground
for the kids. Allow about three hours.

Jedburgh Abbey
Jedburgh
This famous ruined abbey, founded by David I in 1138, is one of Scotland’s
finest. Under the Augustinian canons from Beauvais, France, it achieved
abbey status in 1152 and went on to witness much royal pageantry, such
as the marriage of Alexander III to his second wife, Yolande de Dreux. In
1544 and 1545, the English sacked the abbey during the frequent wars of
the period. After 1560, few efforts were made to repair the abbey. For about
300 years, until 1875, a small section of it served as Jedburgh’s parish
church, when new premises were found for day-to-day worship. Teams of
architects then set to work restoring the abbey to its original medieval
design. The abbey is still roofless but otherwise fairly complete, with most
of its exterior stonework now in place.

Sir Walter Scott: Inventor 
of historic novels
Today it may be hard to imagine the fame that Walter Scott, poet and novelist, enjoyed
as the best-selling author of his day. His works are no longer so widely read, but Scott
(1771–1832) was thought to be a master storyteller and today is considered the inven-
tor of the historic novel. Before his Waverley series was published in 1814, no modern
English author had spun such tales from actual events, examining the lives of individ-
uals who played a role in history — large and small. He created lively characters and
realistic pictures of Scottish life in works such as The Heart of Midlothian.
Born into a Borders family who then settled in Edinburgh on August 14, 1771, Scott
was permanently disabled due to polio he contracted as a child. All his life he was
troubled by ill health and later by ailing finances as well. He spent his latter years writ-
ing to clear enormous debts incurred when his publishing house and printers collapsed
in bankruptcy.
Scott made his country and its scenery fashionable with the English, and he played a
key role in bringing George IV to visit Scotland. Although Scott became the most promi-
nent literary figure in Edinburgh, his heart remained in the Borders, where he built his
home. Starting with a modest farmhouse, he created Abbotsford, a mansion that
became a key tourist destination (p. 270).

on March 27, 2006. It is a surprisingly lush plot of land, given the harsh ter-
rain of the Pentland Hills all around it. Dotted throughout the garden are
stone sculptures (many with Finlay’s pithy sayings and poems) created in
collaboration with master stonemasons and other artists. Little Sparta has
been called the “only original garden” created in Great Britain since World
War II; in the wake of Finlay’s death, a trust has been established to ensure
its survival. Allow about one hour.

Logan Botanic Garden
Rhinns of Galloway
Run by the Royal Botanic Garden, responsible for the beautiful spread in
Edinburgh (see Chapter 11), the gardens on the old Logan estate have
charms of their very own. Because of its southwest exposure (which
brings mild Gulf Stream air flows) and some protective planting, the gar-
dens have a microclimate that allows the successful cultivation of palms,
tree ferns, and other exotic plants such as towering, flowering columns of
echium pininana, native to the Canary Islands. In addition to the more
formal walled garden, Logan also has wilder plantings such as the gunnera,
with its leaves larger than elephant’s ears. Hand-held audio wands can be
for used for self-guided tours, and there’s an interpretative center with
microscopes, too. Allow about two hours.

Melrose Abbey
Melrose
These lichen-covered ruins are all that’s left of an ecclesiastical commu-
nity established by Cistercian monks in the 12th century. While the soar-
ing walls you see follow the lines of the original abbey, they were largely
constructed in the 15th century. The Gothic design moved Sir Walter Scott
to write in the Lay of the Last Minstrel, “If thou would’st view fair Melrose
aright, go visit in the pale moonlight.” The author was also instrumental in
ensuring that the decayed remains were preserved in the 19th century.
You can still view its sandstone shell, filled with elongated windows and
carved capitals, and the finely decorated masonry. It is believed that the
heart of Robert the Bruce is interred in the abbey, per his wishes. Allow
about one and a half hours.

Sweetheart Abbey
New Abbey
The impressive remains of Sweetheart Abbey are worth the short jaunt
from Dumfries. An unusual story lies behind the red sandstone structure:
Lady Devorgilla of Galloway founded the abbey in 1273 in memory of her
husband. She carried his embalmed heart around with her for 22 years,
and when she was buried here, in front of the altar, the heart went with
her, thus the name Sweetheart Abbey. Allow about one hour.

Threave Castle
The River Dee
One of the best things about this massive 14th-century tower house (a
ruined proper castle) is how you get here. Ring a bell to call a boatman, who
ferries you to the island in the River Dee on which the castle sits. Archibald
the Grim, the third earl of Douglas, built Threave Castle. The castle was last
used in the 19th century as a prison for Napoleonic War soldiers. Bird-watch-
ers enjoy an opportunity to get up close and personal with the swallows
that nest in the ruins from April to September. Note: Leave your best shoes
at home; the path from the parking area to the boat pickup can get muddy
when it rains. And, unlike most Historic Scotland properties in southern
Scotland, Threave is closed over the winter. Allow about one hour.

Portpatrick
The site of a natural harbor that has been improved over the years, Portpatrick brought
traders from Northern Ireland from the 17th century to the mid–19th century. Although
a more sheltered port was established at Stranraer and ferries stopped coming here,
Portpatrick remains one of the most picturesque towns in southwest Scotland. Trails
lead away from the village, both up and down the coast. Just south of the town, the
path goes past the ruins of 15th-century Dunskey Castle, perched on the edge of a cliff
above the sea. In the small inlet below is a small beach that seems to capture no end
of golf balls hit astray from seaside courses somewhere along the coast. From
Portpatrick, the more than 320km-long (200-mile) Southern Upland Way, one of the
greatest long-distance footpaths in Scotland, heads northeast across Scotland from
coast to coast. Also worth visiting are the Dunskey Gardens on the eastern outskirts
of the town.

Traquair House
Innerleithen
Little changed since the beginning of the 18th century and dating in part
to the 12th century, this is perhaps Scotland’s most romantic house, rich
in associations with ancient kings, Mary Queen of Scots, and the Jacobite
uprisings. The Stuarts of Traquair still live in the great mansion, making
it, they say, the oldest continuously inhabited house in Scotland. One of
the most poignant exhibits is in the King’s Room: an ornately carved oak
cradle, in which Mary rocked her infant son, who was to become James VI
of Scotland and James I of England. Other treasures include embroideries,
silver, manuscripts, and paintings. Of particular interest is the brewery,
still in operation, producing very fine ales. On the grounds are craft work-
shops — such as wrought ironwork and woodturning — as well as a maze
and woodland walks. There are three rather sumptuous overnight rooms,
too, each going for £180 ($333) including full breakfast. Allow about two
hours.

is a good place hike for a few hours. The trail that circumnavigates
Loch Trool is moderate to easy. On the southern banks, the army 
of Robert the Bruce is believed to have defeated a much stronger
English force in 1307 and across the loch on a high point is Bruce’s
Stone, which commemorates the victory.

Kirkcudbright: The Artists’ Town
Kirkcudbright (kerr-coo-bree) became a thriving artists’ colony in the late 19th and
early 20th century, drawing many notable artists such as leading Glasgow Boy E.A.
Hornel, genius graphic artist Jessie M. King, and Scottish Colourist S.J. Peploe. The
appeal of this cute village remains, although the colony is more of a heritage spot these
days, with galleries keeping the artistic history alive. The center of town is full of small,
colorful cottages, many with charming, wee lanes. From April through September, you
can visit Hornel’s home, Broughton House, a Georgian-era mansion that the artist
adapted and expanded to include a studio. The garden is special, too. Call % 01557-
330-437, or log on to the National Trust for Scotland’s Web site: www.nts.org.uk.
Also of some interest is the city-run Stewartry Museum, which first opened in 1893
and has historical artifacts and art by Jessie King.

a trip to visit her betrothed, the Earl of Bothwell, and became ill
with fever. Now the building is a museum that tells the tragic story
of her life, and features fine tapestries, oil paintings, antique furni-
ture, coats of arms, armor, and some of the Queen’s possessions.
 Mull of Galloway Nature Reserve, southern tip of the Rhins of
Galloway, off the A716, is a keen bird-watcher’s paradise where 
the cliffs rise from the sea by about 85 meters (280 ft.). This is the
southerly most point in all of Scotland.
 The Old Bridge House Museum, Mill Road, Dumfries (% 01387-
256-904), is a museum that’s housed in the oldest building in
Dumfries, a 1660 sandstone structure built into the Devorgilla
Bridge. Today, the museum is devoted to Victorian life. A mid-19th
century kitchen and antique dental tools are among the items on
display.
 The Robert Burns Centre, Mill Road, Dumfries (% 01387-264-808),
displays items such as original documents and relics belonging to
Burns, a cast of his skull, and a scale model of 1790s Dumfries;
there’s a rather sentimental audiovisual presentation of the poet’s
life.
 The Trimontium Exhibition, Market Square, Melrose (% 01896-
822-651), is a small museum devoted to Trimontium, the legendary
three-peaked Roman hill fort near Melrose. Among the collection 
of 1st- and 2nd-century artifacts are a Roman skull and facemask,
tools, weapons, and pottery.
 Wigtown is Scotland’s official book town. Tucked down along the
wide estuary of Wigtown Bay (10km/6 miles south of Newton Stewart
on the A714), the village has virtually back-to-back used and anti-
quarian book shops, specializing often in Scottish titles. At Wigtown,
there is also an infamous Covenanters Monument where one of the
female followers of that 17th-century, diehard Presbyterian sect was
tied to a stake on the shoreline and made to drown in the rising tide.
Shopping for Local Treasures
The main street in places such as Dumfries or Peebles will usually have
small shops and clothing stores. Almost all the attractions listed in this
chapter have well-stocked gift shops.
The town of Kelso is the home of Pettigrews (% 01573-224-234; www.
pettigrews.com), which produces a range of Scottish chutney and
relish at its factory. In the town of Moffat, you can visit the Woollen Mill
(% 01683-220-134), which has weaving demonstrations and shops with
tartan, whisky, and more for sale, seven days a week. If you enjoy books,
set aside some time to visit Wigtown, of course, which is Scotland’s book
town. But if art is more your bag, the seaside village of Kirkcudbright has
developed into an artists community with galleries selling local works.

Here are a couple of other picks worth visiting.
 Broughton Gallery, Broughton Place, Broughton (% 01899-830-
234), in a village near Biggar, exhibits contemporary art — paintings,
glassware, and ceramics — by Scottish and other British artists.
Open during exhibits.
 Lighthouse Pottery, south pier, Portpatrick (% 01776-810-284), is
good place to pick up a gift or two, with a selection of jewelry, pot-
tery, and other handmade local crafts. Open 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.
daily.
Hitting the Local Pubs
Almost every town in southern Scotland has one or two taverns, and
whether unimpressive or not, they often can be a good place to meet the
locals. Ask your hotel concierge or guesthouse host to recommend the
nearest “local” to your accommodations — walking distance preferred.
Worth special note is the Globe Inn, 56 High St., Dumfries (% 01387-
252-335; www.globeinndumfries.co.uk). Established at the beginning
of the 17th century, the Globe was one of poet Robert Burns’s favorite
haunts. You can even sit in Burns’s favorite seat, just to the left of the
fireplace. Other good places for a pint and meal are the Crown in
Portpatrick and Burts in Melrose (see listing information for both in the
“Spending the Night” section, earlier in this chapter).

Ayrshire and Argyll
In This Chapter
 Getting to and getting to know Ayrshire and Argyll
 Seeking out the best places to stay and eat
 Discovering the Burns Heritage Trail, Culzean Castle, and more
 Hittin’ the links in Troon and Turnberry
 Exploring central Scotland’s picturesque western peninsulas and islands
T
he region of Ayshire stretches from the southern and western fringes
of Glasgow south to southwest along the Firth of Clyde, bordering
Galloway in the south. Argyll, one of my favorite parts of Scotland,
covers the western peninsulas of central Scotland and adjacent islands,
the heart of the ancient kingdom of Dalriada. While Ayrshire’s bound-
aries are fairly well marked, Argyll is a bit more amorphous, encompass-
ing a region that historically stretches into the Highlands and the inner
Hebridean islands.
One of Ayrshire’s primary attractions is “Burns Country,” because the
region was the poet Robert Burns’s birthplace as well as his predomi-
nant stomping grounds for most of his life. But Ayrshire also offers
golfers some of the best links courses in the world. If you take the train
from Glasgow to Ayr, the main town of Ayrshire, you can see one course
after another in the sandy dunes along the shoreline.
Argyll, which means the “coast of the Gaels,” encompasses islands such
as Bute and Gigha as well as the remote Kintyre Peninsula, which is iso-
lated enough that former Beatle Paul McCartney has long owned a ranch
there where he retreats from prying eyes. One of the principle cities in
northern Argyll is the port of Oban (oh-bin), gateway to the Hebrides.
Other interesting settlements include Inveraray, on the upper shores of
Loch Fyne, and Tarbert midway down the Kintyre Peninsula.
I have included Islay (eye-la) in this chapter. While it is one of the inner
Hebridean Islands, and might logically seem to belong in chapter 19, it is
reached primarily from ports in Argyll, a region to which is it historically
connected. Conversely, information on the Isle of Mull, which geographi-
cally could have been included here, is found in chapter 19 with the
other islands of the Hebrides.

If you don’t have the time or inclination to give Ayrshire and Argyll sev-
eral days, remember that visits to places such as the mansion and
grounds of Culzean Castle or the quiet roads and beaches on the Isle 
of Bute can be accomplished as day trips from Glasgow.
Getting There
Your options for getting in and out of the area include scheduled buses
and trains that run from Glasgow to a variety of towns, such as Ayr in
Ayrshire or Oban in Argyll. If you want to fully explore the Cowal or
Kintyre peninsulas or the Clyde coastline, a car is necessary. Of course,
ferry services provide the link to the islands (and even between the
peninsulas of Cowal and Kintyre). There are also flights to airports near
Cambeltown on the Kintyre peninsula and to the Isle of Islay.
 By car: From Glasgow, the main road to Ayrshire is the M77 (A77)
from the city’s Southside. It’s the fastest route to towns such as
Troon, Ayr, and points farther south, such as Culzean. You can also
drive west on the M8, along the Clyde to Greenock or Gourock, con-
necting to the A78, which goes south along the Firth of Clyde to
ports such as Wemyss Bay or Ardrossan. To get to Argyll, take the
A82 from the West End of Glasgow north toward Tarbet on the
shores of Loch Lomond. From Tarbet, you can take the A83 to
Inveraray and down the Kintyre Peninsula or from the A83 to the
A815 down to Cowal. The fastest route to Oban is by using the A82
from Tarbet: Go north along Loch Lomond to Crianlarich and
Tyndrum, where the A85 goes west to Oban.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscotrail.
com) service overlaps with the greater Glasgow rail service oper-
ated by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT; % 0141-333
3708; www.spt.co.uk). Between the two (and they’re largely inter-
changeable, unless you’re a dedicated trainspotter), you have rea-
sonably frequent service from Glasgow to Ayrshire and more
limited trains into Argyll. Remember, however, that trains going
southwest toward Ayr — or to Wemyss Bay — depart from Central
Station, while those going northwest toward Oban leave from
Queen Street Station. A one-way journey to Ayr (55 min.) costs
around £6 ($11), to Wemyss Bay (50 min.) £5 ($9.25), and to Oban
(3 hr.) £17 ($31).
 By bus: From Glasgow, Scottish Citylink (% 0141-332-9644 or
0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk) runs buses to western
Scotland, including towns such as Inveraray and Cambeltown. A
standard one-way ticket from Glasgow to Inverary is about £8 ($15)
and £15 ($28) to Campbeltown. The trip to Inveraray takes about
two hours and to Cambeltown about 41⁄2 hours. Stagecoach Express
(% 01292-613-500; www.stagecoachbus.com) also runs buses to
Ayr from Glasgow’s Buchanan Street bus terminal. The one-way fare

Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 281
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll

to Ayr is about £5 ($9.25) and the trip, using the limited stop X77
service, takes about one hour.
 By ferry: Caledonian MacBrayne (% 08705-650-000 or 01475-
650-100; www.calmac.co.uk) — or CalMac, as it’s more colloquially
known — serves 22 islands and four peninsulas over the West
Coast of Scotland. From Gourock, you can reach Dunoon on the
Cowel Peninsula (25-min. crossing). Ferries from Wemyss Bay go to
Rothesay on the Isle of Bute (35 min.). The boat for Brodick on Arran
departs from Ardrossan (1-hr. crossing). Connections between rail-
way terminals and ferry service are fairly well organized.
There is a five-minute-long crossing from northern Bute to
Colintrave on the Cowal peninsula, and in summer you can also go
from Lochranza on Arran to the Kintyre peninsula near Skipness. 
A ferry links the Cowal and Kintyre peninsulas from Portvadie to
Tarbert (25 min.). From the west coast of Kintyre, ferries to the Isle
of Gigha leave from Tayinloan (20-min. crossing), while those to
Islay depart from Kennacraig (2 hr., 20 min.).
On a trip across Argyll, you can take advantage of CalMac’s “Island
Hopscotch” ticket. For example, you may go from Wemyss Bay to
Rothesay on Bute, from Bute to the Cowal peninsula, and then from
Cowal to the pretty fishing village of Tarbert on Kintyre. Tickets are
around £7.50 ($14) per passenger and £35 ($65) for a car. It’s fun
and sidesteps the much longer, albeit scenic, road routes. Unless
you love driving, take the ferries.
CalMac has some competition from another company, Western
Ferry (% 01396-704-452; www.western-ferries.co.uk), which
runs a route to Hunter’s Quay in Dunoon from McInroy’s Point in
Gourock.
 By air: British Airways (% 0870-850-9850; www.britishairways.
com) coordinates direct flights from Glasgow airport to Cambeltown
and Islay, but there are only one or two per day, operated by BA’s
local partner, Loganair. Typically, they cost around £125 ($231), and
the travel time is 45 minutes.
Spending the Night
When it comes to overnight rooms, you have a variety of options, from
luxury country-house hotels to basic B&Bs and self-catering options.
Some have received star ratings from the tourist board (VisitScotland),
which I occasionally note (please see Chapter 8 for a description of the
rating system). In the listings below, room rates generally include full
breakfast, unless otherwise stated. And don’t forget: You may well get a
better deal than the standard “rack” rates that I quote.

Abbotsford Hotel
$$
Ayr
About 1km (1⁄2 mile) from the centre of Ayr, this small hotel with a popular,
civilized pub is curiously named after Sir Walter Scott’s mansion rather
than associating itself with local Ayrshire hero Robert Burns. It is located
in a quiet residential neighborhood, less than a ten-minute walk to the
shoreline and convenient to the local golf courses, too. Most of the units
are smart and comfortable, with flat-screen TVs and modern bathrooms.
Family-run and friendly, the Abbotsford offers sound, moderately priced
accommodations.
See map p. 281. 14 Corsehill Rd., Ayr, Ayrshire. % 01292-261-506. Fax: 01292-261-606.

An Lochan
$$$
Tighnabruaich
Formerly the Royal Hotel, this 11-bedroom, four-star inn overlooking the sea
in Tighnabruaich offers plenty of comforts and some luxurious rooms, but
not a hint of pretension or attitude from the McKie family owners or staff.
The “superior sea view” rooms fit the bill, additionally offering huge king-
size beds and ample bathrooms (with tubs and showers), comfy leather-
upholstered furnishings, and little goodies such as fresh fruit on arrival.
Meals in either of the two conservatory dining rooms (see entry later in
“Dining locally”) highlight fresh seafood and fish caught nearby (even the
names of the scallop divers are given). The menu also offers Argyll-shire
venison and beef. A treatment room offers facials and massages.
See map p. 283. Tighnabruaich, Argyll. % 01700-811-239. Fax: 01700-811-300 www.

Ardanaiseig Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Kilchrenan
This hotel is arguably the poshest and least accessible place listed in this
chapter, so if you seek a bit of luxury in an out-of-the-way corner, read on.
The Ardanaiseig (ard-na-sag) hotel is a stone Scottish baronial pile built in
the 1830s on the shores of Loch Awe; it sits at the end of a curvy single-
track road through the woods some 24km (15 miles) from Taynuilt (off the
main road to Oban). The gardens are especially colorful in spring when
the rhododendrons are in bloom, but they have plenty of year-round inter-
est as well. The public spaces include a large drawing room with views of
the hotel’s own wee island in the loch. Evening meals, supervised by head
chef Gary Goldie, are especially memorable, and every day brings a dif-
ferent four-course menu. The hotel, which prefers not to take small chil-
dren, has converted the loch-side boatshed into a luxury retreat.
See map p. 283. 5km (3 miles) north of Kilchrenan, off the B845 from Taynuilt, Argyll.
% 01866-833-333. Fax: 01866-833-222. www.ardanaiseig.com. Rack rates:

The Argyll Hotel
$$
Inveraray
Owned by the Best Western group, this waterfront hotel overlooks pic-
turesque Loch Fyne. The attractive and stately white building, designed
by Robert Adam, was built over 250 years ago as a coach house to accom-
modate guests of the third duke of Argyll at nearby Inveraray Castle.
Today, the hotel is still welcoming the castle’s many tourist visitors, as
well as other travelers in Argyll. If you can afford paying a bit more, book
a room with a sea view. Advance reservations offer discounts on rack
rates.
See map p. 283. Front Street, Argyll. % 01499-302-466. Fax: 01499-302-389. www.the-
argyll-hotel.co.uk. Rack rates: £104 ($192) standard double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Fairfield House Hotel
$$$
Ayr
On the seafront at the edge of Ayr’s Low Green, Fairfield House is a
Victorian mansion/country home that has been restored and converted
into a four-star hotel. The staff is attentive and, like at the Abbotsford (see
above), will help you arrange tee times at nearby golf courses. Rooms in
the main building are decorated in a country-house style, while a newer
wing offers more modern décor. The units are generally large and luxuri-
ous; some of the bathrooms have bidets. The hotel’s Martins Bar and Grill
was named best informal dining restaurant in 2006 by the Scottish hotel
awards.

DC, MC, V.
Gigha Hotel
$$
Isle of Gigha
There aren’t many options on this lovely, compact island just off the coast
of Kintyre; the Gigha Hotel offers the main accommodations, run by the
community trust that now owns the isle. Rooms are fairly basic but clean
and tidy. Up top, directly facing the sea, are room nos. 1 and 2, which share
a bathroom (and you might get a discount if requesting one of them).
Otherwise, all units have en-suite facilities. Room no. 7 is spacious, over-
looking the rear garden with a bit of sea view. In addition, the hotel oper-
ates some self-catering cabins around the island. The restaurant
specializes in local, fresh seafood dishes, while the pub is a popular gath-
ering spot for the islanders.

Greencourt Guest House
$$
Oban
Among the B&Bs in Oban, this four-star guesthouse stands out for the warm
reception from owners Joanie and Michael Garvin, as well as its westward
views over the town’s bowling green. The Greencourt is a short walk from
the center of town, offering six comfortable units with en-suite bathroom
facilities. Breakfasts feature local produce — such as free-range eggs from
the nearby Isle of Seil — and homemade preserves and marmalades.

Closed Dec to mid-Feb.
Harbour Inn
$$–$$$
Isle of Islay
Right at the heart of Islay’s main town, Bowmore, and on the shores of
Loch Indaal, the four-star Harbour Inn is your best bet for overnight
accommodations on the Isle of Islay. It is well positioned for excursions
south to Port Ellen and distilleries such as Laphroaig, or around the bay
to picturesque towns, such as Portnahaven. I found room no. 5 to be a par-
ticularly spacious, L-shaped unit with a big bathtub (though no shower).
The restaurant (see entry later, under “Dining locally”) offers assured
meals with plenty of local produce, such as scallops from Lagavulin Bay.
See map p. 283. The Square, foot of Main Street, Bowmore, Argyll. % 01496-810-330.
Fax: 1496-810-990. www.harbour-inn.com. Rack rates: £120 ($222) double. MC, V.
Hunters Quay Hotel
$$
Dunoon
Right on the water, north of the Dunoon town center, this up-to-date and
modernized Victorian mansion is very welcoming and comfortable. The
ten guest rooms are individually sized and decorated. I’d say this is prob-
ably your best option in the immediate vicinity, and they offer friendly and
good food, too.
See map p. 283. Hunters Quay, Marine Parade. % 01369-707-070. www.hunters
quayhotel.co.uk. Rack rates: £90–£100 ($167–$185) double. AE, MC, V.
Hunting Lodge Hotel
$$
Kintyre
While the name led me to expect a 17th-century inn, the Hunting Lodge’s
20th-century renovations have, alas, rather masked most of historic
charms of this hotel — at least from the outside. But forgive the design of
dormers and Mediterranean-style balcony railing and just enjoy the views,
especially the languid summer sunsets over the sea. Inside, the whisky bar
(with hundreds of single malts) offers the character that the hotel’s name
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 287

promises, and the meals (served daily from noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6:30–9
p.m.) usually feature plenty of local shellfish.
See map p. 283. Just south of Bellchantuy on the A83, Argyll. % 01583-421-323. Fax:
01583-421-343. www.thehuntinglodgehotel.com. Rack rates: £72–£92 ($133–$170)
double. MC, V.
Kilmichael Country House
$$$
Isle of Arran
This 300-year-old country house — the oldest on the island — offers some
of the most unique accommodations on Arran. The rooms are furnished
with antique furniture, fresh flowers, and pleasant pastel upholstery and
drapes; two suites have sitting rooms as well as bedrooms. The hotel has
pleasant gardens all round with a few exotic plants, while the cuisine in
the dining room leans toward Scottish flavors, with dishes such as roasted
chestnut soup or rack of lamb. The Kilmichael welcomes children 12 years
old and above.

($278–$352) double. MC, V.
Loch Fyne Hotel
$$$
Inveraray
Just north of town, this old stone house is perched on a lovely spot over

bedrooms aren’t fancy, but some have beautiful views of the water. Opt for
the “superior double” units if you need more space. The food in the restau-
rant is satisfying and decent value. Occasional staffing problems of late
seem to have led to some mixed reviews from recent guests.

Malin Court Hotel

Maidens
On one of the more scenic strips of Ayrshire coastline, this well-run hotel
fronts the Firth of Clyde. It is not a great country house, however, but
rather a serviceable, welcoming retreat offering a blend of informality and
comfort. The 18 bedrooms are mostly medium in size and overlook the
famous Turnberry golf course. Staff can arrange hunting, fishing, riding,
and sailing, as well as 18 holes on the links. The hotel offers a 20 percent

Ayrshire and Argyll are dominated by vast coastline, so some of the
finest food you’ll find in the region highlights locally landed fish and
seafood. Below are some of the best dining options in the region.
An Lochan

Tighnabruaich
FISH/SEAFOOD
At the former Royal Hotel there are two dining rooms, but in either you’re
always guaranteed a sea view and menus brimming with fresh fish,
seafood, and meat dishes, with all the primary ingredients sourced locally.
Heck, they even offer the names of the people who dive for the scallops
and secure the venison. If you’re up for it, there is a set-price evening
menu, but the habit here is not pretentious presentation but rather honest,
straightforward cooking, allowing the natural flavors to set the tone.

Dalry (Ayrshire)
FRENCH/SCOTTISH
One of the standout and exclusive fine-dining restaurants in Scotland,
Braidwoods is housed in a simple cottage (known as a “butt and ben”),
which has been converted into a small and not overly formal dining space
southwest of Glasgow. Keith and Nicola Braidwood share the cooking
chores and the place gets very busy on weekends. Holder of a Michelin
star and other accolades, Braidwoods is fairly expensive but worth the
price for dishes such as roast quail with black pudding or baked turbot on
a smoked salmon risotto.

Ee-usk

Oban
FISH/SEAFOOD
This modern restaurant’s name, the phonetic pronunciation of the Gaelic
for “fish,” sums up the place quite well. It serves a host of simple fish and
shellfish dishes, including the creamy delights of smoked haddock soup,
Cullen skink, and lightly breaded white fish or fresh shellfish platters.
Located at the recently renovated North Pier in Oban, the restaurant has
a bayside deck that’s perfect for nice days. Ee-usk has a good wine list and
some rare Scottish ales, too. No children under 10 allowed after 6 p.m.

Dining at this highly rated, five-room country house hotel, done in Art
Deco from the 1930s, can be a special treat. East of Ayr in the village of
Annbank, Enterkine’s menus emphasize local ingredients, whether sea-
sonal game or fish landed at nearby Troon. The fixed-price dinners are

Ayr
MODERN SCOTTISH
In the heart of Ayr, Fouters Restaurant occupies the cellar of an old bank,
retaining the original stone floor and a vaulted ceiling. The restaurant’s
name is derived from the Scottish expression “foutering about,” which is
equivalent to “fiddling around.” But no one’s goofing off here: Dishes fea-
ture imaginative touches and fresh local produce.

On the road to Inveraray near the head of Loch Fyne is the famous Loch
Fyne Oyster Bar. The company that owns it farms both oysters and mus-
sels in the clear cool waters of the loch. With a glass of dry white wine at
this casual (although almost often busy) restaurant, there are few things
finer than a platter of raw oysters or some cooked fish dishes. Be sure to

Isle of Bute
RUSSIAN/SEAFOOD
You’re not likely find another place like this during your travels in Scotland.
In the village of Port Bannatyne, just 3km (2 miles) north of Rothesay on
the Isle of Bute, the Port Royal is a family-run inn where the house special-
ties are Russian cuisine (for example, blinis, spicy sausage, and pavlova).
And not just that, but fresh fish and seafood are provided by a local fish-
erman, and there are some rarely found Scottish ales served from kegs atop
the bar in the small cafe/pub they call the Russian Tavern. Overnight
rooms, two with en-suite bathrooms, are basic rather than luxurious.

Open during the day from June to September, this operation south of
Tarbert (also called the Crab Shack) is worth a detour if you fancy seafood.
Food is cooked in a converted 1950s-style minitrailer next to a stone house
in the shadow of Skipness Castle, and the meals feature langoustines,
queen scallops, mussels, smoked salmon, and more. It is completely unas-
suming, with chickens and ducks freely wandering on the grass around the

This place has recently burst on to the radar screen. It’s owned and oper-

admission it can be feast or famine, depending on the day’s catch. The
menu is devised anew every afternoon and judging from the mostly rave
reviews, typically the haul is excellent. About 600m (1,970 ft.) from the pier,
where the longstanding seafood shack (run by the same people) is a well-

Exploring Ayrshire and Argyll
Just as Sir Walter Scott dominates Lothian and the Borders, the promi-
nence of Robert Burns is felt southwest of Glasgow in Ayrshire. The heart
of “Burns Country” is here, although it extends to Dumfries as well (see
Chapter 14). Down the Clyde Coast is another popular tourist attraction:
Culzean Castle. Pronounced “cul-lane,” it’s more of a mansion than a
castle and became a favorite of General Eisenhower, who has a section of
the building named after him. This region of Scotland is home to some of
the world’s great links golf courses, including world-famous Royal Troon
and Turnberry, with windswept coastal views and dunes.
At one time, the royal burgh of Ayr was the most popular resort on
Scotland’s West Coast. On the reasonably picturesque Firth of Clyde, it’s
only some 56km (35 miles) southwest of Glasgow — about an hour by
train or by car. For many years it was a busy market town with a more
important, and indeed larger, port than Glasgow’s until the 18th century.
Ayr offers visitors some 4km (21⁄2 miles) of beach.
Argyll is more remote and wilder, a land of peninsulas and islands with
lots of seas surrounding it. It is a region with several archaeological
sites, because this part of Scotland appears to be the spot where the
earliest humans inhabited the land. Although the heydays of resort
towns such as Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula or Rothesay on the Isle of
Bute are past, they are experiencing a minirevival and remain pleasant
places to visit. Argyll-shire landscape ranges from wooded glens to some
rather craggy peaks, with plenty of shoreline never far away.
The Isle of Arran is sometimes called “Scotland in miniature” because it
combines mountains with more pastoral landscapes. Bute and Gigha
offer smaller island respites, with quiet country lanes and uncrowded
beaches. Islay is Scotland’s whisky island, with several distilleries, but it
is also just a fine place to explore. Parts of Argyll and its towns, such as
Oban or Inveraray, can feel as if they have more in common with the
Highlands and Western Islands. If you can’t fully explore the open spaces
in northern Scotland, Argyll can provide a decent substitute.
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 293

If you want the freedom to hop around a bit from mainland to island and
from island to peninsulas west of Glasgow, then it may be worth buying an
“Island Hopscotch” ticket from the ferry operator Caledonian MacBrayne
(% 0870-565-0000; www.calmac.co.uk). For example, you can hop from
Wemyss Bay to the Isle of Bute, from there to Cowal peninsula, and then
onward to the Kintyre Peninsula. In summer, the cost for that excursion is
around £8 ($15) per passenger and £35 ($61) for a car.
The top attractions
Achamore Gardens
Gigha
Toward the southern end of the Isle of Gigha, stately trees begin to domi-
nate the landscape, creating a barrier from the harsher elements of the
Atlantic and providing key protection to this memorable garden.
Combining both walled and parkland plantings, it was started in 1944 by
Sir James Horlick, who then owned the entire island. The best time to visit
is spring and early summer to see the exceptional display of the many dif-
ferent species of azalea, camellia, rhododendron, and other subtropical
plants. But honestly, there is never a bad time to stroll the many paths.
Look out for the blue plumage of the resident peacocks. Allow about two
hours.

Open: Daily 9:30 a.m. to dusk.
Brodick Castle and Country Park
Isle of Arran
The oldest bit of the this proud mansion goes way back to the 13th century
but it has had several additions since then, most of them in the Victorian
era. The home and stronghold of the dukes of Hamilton for centuries, and
more recently a retreat for the duke and duchess of Montrose, the place is
full of furnishings and artifacts from both families. The stag heads in the
main hall are impressive enough. The immediate grounds offer lots of
trails, but from here you can hike (or mountain bike) around an extensive
Country Park, as well as follow the paths to Goat Fell and Glen Rosa. Allow
about two hours.

take a self-guided tour of the restored cottage, built by William Burnes (as
the family name was originally spelled), where the poet was born, in 1757.
An audio track explains the various uses for the rooms — one of which
held both the family and their livestock. The museum is a treasure trove
of Burns memorabilia, holding the best collection of the poet’s manu-
scripts. The initial room has display cases with first editions of his books,
signed in some instances, as well as many letters that Burns wrote and
received. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

Culzean Castle and Country Park
South Ayrshire
This is a fine example of architect Robert Adam’s “castellated” style (that
is, built with turrets and ramparts), which replaced in the late 1700s an
earlier castle keep as the family seat of the powerful Kennedy clan. After
World War II, the castle was given to the National Trust for Scotland.
Notwithstanding its architectural attributes — whether the celebrated
round drawing room or the outstanding oval staircase — the pile is of spe-
cial interest to many Americans because General Dwight D. Eisenhower
was given an apartment for life here. Today, tourists can rent the six-room
top-floor flat as vacation accommodations. Fans of the Scottish cult horror
film The Wicker Man should know that scenes at the home of the devilish

Burns: Humanitarian, poet, skirt-chaser
Robert Burns (1759–96) continues to hold a sentimental spot in the national con-
sciousness of Scotland. In recent years, Ayrshire has begun to host an annual music
and cultural festival, “Burns an’ a’ that” (www.burnsfestival.com), in the spring
to celebrate his life. Born in Alloway on a night so gusty that part of the cottage came
down, Burns was the son of a simple and pious gardener who encouraged the boy to
read and seek an education. Burns was, by trade, a hard-working, though largely
unsuccessful, farmer who switched to being a tax collector later in his life.
But the world knows him as the author of poetry, often set to song, such as Auld Lang
Syne, or narrative masterpieces, such as Tam O’Shanter. Other works, such as A Man’s
a Man for a’ That, show Burns’s humanitarian leanings. In his short life, he wrote hun-
dreds of poems and songs. Burns was also a prodigious pursuer of women who
fathered numerous children, legitimate and otherwise. Distinguished but destitute, he
died at age 37, of heart disease, in the southern town of Dumfries. Almost immediately,
however, contributions to his widow and family were made from across Scotland.
Burns was buried with some ceremony on the very day that his wife, Jean, delivered
their ninth child.

Arran: Scotland in miniature?
The Isle of Arran, in the Firth of Clyde off the coast of Ayrshire, is often called “Scotland
in miniature” because it combines pasture-filled lowlands with mountainous highland
scenery. Indeed, the so-called Highland Boundary Fault Line bisects the island diag-
onally, just as it does the Scottish mainland.
But increasingly locals involved in tourism (www.visitarran.com) prefer to call it
“Arran, the Island.” Whatever, it is a fine place to visit. There are some excellent food
producers including the Island Cheese Company, Isle of Arran Brewery, and Creelers,
which produces smoked Scottish seafood. There is also some great hiking up to the
top of craggy Goat Fell (874m/2,867 ft.), in the majestic valley of Glen Rosa, or along the
rugged southern coastline near Kildonan, where you’re almost certain to see seals
and perhaps even a dolphin or two.
For archery, kayaking, sailing, rock climbing, and more outdoors activities, Arran
Adventure (% 01770-302-244; www.arranadventure.com) will arrange the works
for you. It’s based at the Auchrannie Spa Resort in Brodick. If you fancy a unique golf-
ing challenge, then head west across the island from Brodick to Blackwaterfoot and
try your luck at the Shiskine course. It has only 12 holes, but between the driving winds
and diverting scenery, it has become a legendary challenge. A round costs about £18
($33). Contact the Shiskine Golf and Tennis Club (% 01770-860-226; www.shiskine
golf.com).
The primary ferry services (5–6 per day) depart from Ardrossan in Ayrshire to the prin-
cipal town of Brodick (50-min. crossing). A single passenger pays about £5.50 ($10)
and about £40 ($74) for a car. There’s a seasonal ferry from Claonaig near Skipness
(on the Kintyre Peninsula) to Arran’s northern port of Lochranza. For ferry information,

Bute: The unexplored isle
Officially, Bute considers itself Scotland’s unexplored isle but it is perhaps better
referred to as the country’s underappreciated island. One of the easiest to reach from
the mainland, Bute offers obvious attractions such as the Mount Stuart mansion and
its great gardens or Rothesay Castle, the circular stronghold at the heart of the island’s
main port. But explore a bit and you will find the reasonably substantial ruins of an
ancient Christian settlement at St. Blane’s Church near the southern tip of the island.
Walk out to the significantly more meager remains of a chapel dedicated to St. Ninian
at St. Ninian’s Point on the island’s west coast, and you’ll still be treated to the com-
pany of dozens of seabirds along the windswept shoreline. One thing you’ll not have
to worry about very much as you explore the rural roads, however, is the bother of
many other tourists.

museum also offers workshops and organizes guided walks to the various
local monuments. The museum cafe offers noteworthy food from local sup-
pliers. Allow about two hours.

don’t have to be a fan of Scotch to enjoy a tour of the distillery. To visit
and get a tour full of good anecdotes and information, you will need to

century. The interiors display certain eccentricities and interests of the
man, such as a ceiling in an upstairs room that is covered in stars and con-
stellations to accommodate his interest in astrology. The garden dates
back to early decades of the 18th century, when the second earl of Bute
moved the family here from the port town of Rothesay. The grounds have
a woodlands park, a huge walled area — the so-called wee garden — and
a working vegetable plot, too. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 283. A844 near Scoulag, 8km (5 miles) south of Rothesay. % 01700-
503-877. www.mountstuart.com. Admission: House and grounds £7.50 ($14)
adults, £3.50 ($6.50) children 5–16. Open: House May–Sept Sun–Fri 11 a.m.–5 p.m.,
Sat 10 a.m.–2:30 p.m.; gardens daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Rothesay Castle
Bute
Located in the heart of Rothesay, only a few minutes’ walk from the ferry
terminal and harbor, this castle is unusual in Scotland for its circular plan.
It dates to the beginning of the 13th century, with a large water-filled moat
(with resident water fowl) surrounding the ramparts. Interestingly, the
castle plays up the connections that this part of Scotland had with Norse
Part IV: The Major Regions

rulers, King Haakon IV in particular (see Chapter 20 for more Norse his-
tory on Orkney). It is worth watching a brief video on the Scandinavian
influences, battles with native Scots and the latter’s eventual victory over
the troops from Norway in the 13th century. Although mostly a restored
ruin, the castle has an impressive pigeon tower and chapel within the
grassy courtyard. If you dare (and you’re thin enough), you can descend
from the gatehouse into a small dungeon reserved for prisoners. Allow
about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 283. Rothesay, Isle of Bute. % 01700-502-691. www.historic-
scotland.gov.uk. Admission £4.20 ($7.80) adults, £3.20 ($5.90) seniors, £2.10
($3.90) children. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar Sept daily 
9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Scottish Sealife Sanctuary
Barcaldine
Formerly called the Oban Seal & Marine Centre, this place offers a hospi-
tal and rehab unit for stray, sick, and injured seals. But for human visitors,
the marine center has tanks and aquarium that replicate the natural habi-
tats of sea creatures, from crabs to sharks. Other highlights include daily
lectures and feedings, as well as a “stud farm” for seahorses as part of a
unique breeding program and a sea otter sanctuary. The setting, among
tall, shady pine trees by the water’s edge, is reminiscent of northern
California. Allow about two hours.
Admission here has essentially doubled in recent years. But you can buy
tickets online for discounts on the standard prices given below.
See map p. 283. A828, north of Oban, on the shores of Loch Creran. % 01631-720-386.

students, £9 ($17) children 3–14, £33 ($60) family. Open: Mar–Oct daily 10 a.m.–5 p.m.;
check with center for winter hours.
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 299
Gigha: The good isle
Pronouned gee-a with a hard “g” (as in gear), this small island off the Kintyre Peninsula
gets its name from the ancient Norse ruler King Haakon who once dominated this
region of Scotland. It’s derived from a Scandinavian word that means “the good isle.”
And good, indeed, it is. Small (only 10km/6 miles long and about 2km/11⁄4 mile wide) and
placid, Gigha is best known for its Achamore Gardens (see earlier), with their excep-
tional springtime display of rhododendrons and azaleas. But as a quiet place to escape
and relax, it is excellent as well. There are plenty of rural and coastal walks, such as
one up the central road. Past an ancient standing stone, it takes you to the Twin
Beaches on a narrow isthmus of dunes linking the island to Eilean Garbh, a bulbous
peninsula with views across to the isles of Islay and Jura. Gigha is also particularly
noteworthy because on March 15, 2002, the residents established a community trust
(www.gigha.org.uk) and assumed ownership of the isle.

Golfing heavens: Troon and Turnberry
For links-style golf, which emphasizes sandy dunes and rolling golf
courses, you can hardly do better than the Ayrshire coastline. While
there are a host of options for the avid golfer, the two best-known
courses are Troon and Turnberry.
Troon
The resort town of Troon, 11km (7 miles) north of Ayr and 50km (31
miles) southwest of Glasgow, looks out across the Firth of Clyde toward
the Isle of Arran. Troon takes its name from the curiously hook-shaped
promontory jutting out into the sea: the “trone,” or nose.
Troon and its environs offer several sandy links courses, most promi-
nently the Royal Troon Golf Club, Craigends Road, Troon, Ayrshire KA10
6EP (% 01292-311-555; www.royaltroon.co.uk). Royal Troon is a 7,150-
yard seaside course that hosts the prestigious Open Championship, which
was last played here in 2004. Hole 8, the famous “Postage Stamp,” may be
only 123 yards in distance, but depending upon the wind, pros sometimes
need a long iron or wedge to reach the green. A second course, the 6,289-
yard Portland is arguably even more challenging. Visitors, with certificate
of handicap (20 for men, 30 for women), can play the course from May
through October on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. The one-day fee to
play one round on the Old Course and one on Portland is about £225
($415), which includes morning coffee and a buffet lunch. Two rounds on
Portland are about half the cost.
A much less expensive but still gratifying alternative to Royal Troon is to
play one of the municipal courses run by the South Ayrshire Council,
such as Darnley or Lochgreen, which runs parallel to Royal Troon at
Part IV: The Major Regions

Islay: Scotland’s whisky island
Sometimes called the Queen of the Hebrides, Islay (eye-la) is truly Scotland’s whisky
island, with seven full-scale, world renowned distilleries, such as Ardbeg, Lagavulin,
or Bunnahabhain, and also one new boutique “farm distillery” at Kilchoman (www.
kilchomandistillery.com), which was established in 2005 — the first built on
the island in nearly 125 years.
But there is much more than Scotch to lure you to Islay. Beaches, like the one at
Machir Bay, are breathtaking. Villages such as Port Charlotte or Portnahaven are
charming and placid. You can take sea cruises and look for seals and whales, or shuck
oysters from the farm at Loch Gruinart. On the mull of Oa, the American monument
stands in tribute to the loss of more than 250 navel seamen torpedoed offshore in World
War I. Both Kilchoman and Kildalton offer masterpieces of medieval stone carving on
massive Celtic crosses, befitting the island historical significance at the center of the
ancient Gaelic kingdom of Dalriada.

spots. Fees during the weekend range from around £18 to £32 ($33–$59).
Another option is a six-round, seven-day golf pass from the council for
£88 ($163). Log onto www.golfsouthayrshire.com, or call the South
Ayrshire Golf hot line at % 01292-616-255.
Nongolfing visitors will find plenty of room to relax on Troon’s 3km 
(2 miles) of sandy beaches stretching along both sides of the harbor; the
broad sands and shallow waters make it a safe haven for beach bums.
From here you can take boat trips to Arran or the narrow strait north of
Bute known as the Kyles of Bute.
Trains from Glasgow’s Central Station arrive at the Troon station several
times daily (trip time is about 40 min.; cost: £10/$19 for a standard one-
day round-trip ticket).
Turnberry
The coastal settlement of Turnberry, 81km (50 miles) south of Glasgow
on the A77, was once part of the Culzean Estate. It began to flourish
early in the 20th century when rail service (since disbanded) was devel-
oped, and a recognized golfing center with a first-class resort hotel was
established. However, unlike Troon, which is a reasonably sized port
town/village, there isn’t much in Turnberry except for the luxury hotel
and golf course.
From the original pair of 13-hole golf courses, the complex has developed
into the two championship-level courses, Ailsa and Kintyre, known world-
wide as the Turnberry Hotel Golf Courses. Ailsa’s 18 holes have been the
scene of Open tournaments and other professional golfing events. Guests
of the Westin Turnberry hotel get priority access, especially on the Ailsa
course. The fees to play vary. Hotel residents pay between £45 and £125
($83–$231), depending on the course and the season. If you’re not staying
at Westin Turnberry, rates range from £75 to £200 ($139–$370). Log on to
www.turnberry.co.uk, or call % 01655-334-032 for details.
Other cool things to see and do
 Benmore Botanic Garden, 11km (7 miles) north of Dunoon on
Cowal (% 01396-706-261), is part of the national botanic gardens
across Scotland. Rather than formal arrangements and flower beds,
this one specializes in forest planting, including an impressive row
of Pacific redwoods and a cluster of towering monkey puzzle trees.
There is also a good selection of rhododendrons along the miles of
interlacing pathways. Open daily March through October.
 Burns Monument and Gardens, in Alloway about 1km (1⁄2 mile) from
the Burns Cottage, is a Grecian-classical monument, which was repli-
cated in Edinburgh on Calton Hill. It was erected here in 1823 in a
ceremony attended by the poet’s widow, Jean Armour. The gardens
overlook the River Doon and its famous arching bridge.
Chapter 15: Ayrshire and Argyll 301

 Caol Ila Distillery, near Port Askaig, Islay (% 01496-302-760), is
one of the most distinguished distilleries on Islay, though you may
not recognize the name (pronounced cull-ee-la). They produce not
only their own sublime brand but also the key component of the
Johnnie Walker blend. The setting along the narrow straight
between Islay and Jura is magical. Open April through October by
appointment.
 Kilchurn Castle, A85 east of Loch Awe (% 01838-200-440), offers
well-maintained ruins that date to the 16th century. They’re as
much fun to get to as they are to explore — you can either walk up
a steep path from the car park or hop on the steamboat ferry for
the short ride from the Loch Awe pier.
 McCaig’s Tower, between Duncraggan and Laurel roads in Oban,
was commissioned by a local banker around 1900 in order to
employ three stonemasons who were out of work. Though never
completed, the arches were intended to house statues of his family.
You’re free to walk through the monument and enjoy the best view
of the town.
 Museum of Islay Life, Port Charlotte, Islay (% 01496-850-358). This
little museum housed in an old church focuses on the history of the
island and life there, as well as the whisky-making process. It may
seem a bit thrown-together, but it can give context to your visit.
 Souter Johnnie’s Cottage, in Kirkoswald about 19km (13 miles)
south of Ayr, was the home of Burns’s pal, the cobbler (or souter)
named John Davidson. Davidson is name-checked in Burns’s tale of
Tam O’Shanter, who in real life was another friend named Douglas
Graham. The cottage, which dates to 1785, contains Burnsiana,
period furniture, and contemporary cobbler’s tools. In the nearby
kirkyard are the graves of Graham as well as Souter Johnnie and his
wife, Ann. Open April through September.
Shopping for Local Treasures
Ayr and Oban are historic market towns, while smaller villages, such as
Tarbert, have some good craft shops. Many of the attractions listed
above have gift shops. The Burns Museum in Alloway (p. 294) is particu-
larly good for souvenirs about the Scottish bard.
 The Celtic House, Shore St. Bowmore, Islay (% 01496-810-304), is
an excellent all-around shop with crafts, crystal, gifts, clothes, trin-
kets, and an excellent book selection, too. Open Monday through
Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Crafty Kitchen, Ardfern, midway between Oban and Lochgilphead
(% 01852-500-303), is part craft shop and part cafe. Crafty Kitchen
features works by Scottish artists and craftspeople. The shop is
open April through October, Tuesday through Sunday from 10 a.m.
to 5:30 p.m.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
302

 Earra Gale, the Weighbridge, Tarbert (% 01880-820-428), is a
small, harbor-side shop specializing in arts and crafts from all cor-
ners of Argyll, from handmade knitwear to pottery. Open April
through October, including Sunday in midsummer, from 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m.
 Islay Woolen Mill, Bridgeend, Islay (% 01496-810-563), is an arti-
sanal woolen mill, using fine yarn and making many items, with rich
and earthy colors, that are a departure from the usual tartans.
Open Monday through Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Mahailia Jewellery Design, 150 Barmore Rd., Tarbert (% 01880-
820-331), is a shop owned by Mahailia Scott, a young jewelry
designer with an eye for classy, timelessly modern gold and silver
rings, earrings, bracelets, and more. Her shop is right at the harbor
in Tarbert. Open Monday through Saturday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Millcroft Lavender, Millhouse near Tighnabruaich (% 01700-811-
110), almost manages to make lavender sexy (rather than the scent
preferred by your great-granny). This family cultivates some 1.6
hectares (4 acres) of this wonderful herb and turns it into culinary,
cosmetic, homeopathic, and other products. The craft shop is open
Tuesday to Sunday 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., April through December.
Doing the Pub Crawl
Typically, you’ll find no shortage of pubs, especially in the larger towns
of Ayrshire and Argyll. In some of the smaller settlements, the local inn
may be the only place to grab a dram of whisky or a pint. Several of the
hotels (and a couple of the dining options) listed earlier in this chapter
have public-house licenses and welcome nonresidents. In addition, con-
sider the following:
 Oban Inn, Stafford Street, Oban (% 01631-562-484). This classic
whitewashed pub, near the water just off the town’s main street,
has a warm, old-fashioned elegance. It was refurbished in 2008 but
not to the detriment of its traditional features. Open daily from 11
a.m. to 1 a.m.
 Rabbie’s Bar, Burns Statue Square, Ayr (% 01292-262-112). The
bar has walls covered with the pithy verses of Robert Burns and
his portrait. However, don’t come here expecting poetry readings
in a quiet corner. The crowd, if not particularly literary, is talkative.
Open Monday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.; on
Sunday, it’s open from noon to midnight.

Fife to the Trossachs

 Enjoying a pint at the best local pubs
T
he area of Central Scotland from Fife to the Trossachs teems with
attractions — and many are within easy reach of Edinburgh and
Glasgow. The region’s flagship settlements are the east coast port of St.
Andrews in Fife and the historic city of Stirling in the heart of central
Scotland. Other key settlements include Dunfermline, Dunblane, and
Callander.
The region of Fife, north of the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh, still likes
to call itself a “kingdom,” a distinction dating to Pictish prehistoric times
when Abernethy was Fife’s capital. Even today, the Kingdom of Fife
evokes romantic episodes and the pageantry of Scottish kings. Indeed,
some 14 of Scotland’s 66 royal burghs lay in this rather self-contained
shire on a broad eastern peninsula between the Forth and Tay rivers. If
you’re at all interested in golf, St. Andrews needs no introduction. Home
to one of the oldest courses in the world — as well as the association
that decides the rules for the sport — St. Andrews, also a college town
with cobblestone streets, is the golf mecca of the world. There are many
other attractive coastal towns in Fife south and east of St. Andrews in an
area known as East Neuk.
Stirling received royal burgh status from King David in 1124 and was for
a spell the de facto capital of Scotland. Its castle and palace, all largely
intact, became a favorite residence for Scottish royalty during the reign
of the Stuarts. Many people come to see the historic sites of the sur-
rounding area, which has seen its share of battles between Scottish and
the English forces. Both William Wallace, who has a towering monument
in Stirling, and King Robert the Bruce led their armies to decisive victo-
ries in and around Stirling.
Other things to see and do include visiting Dunfermline Abbey in Fife,
where early Scottish royalty is buried, and the well-preserved ruins of
Doune Castle (which Monty Python used in the film The Holy Grail) near

Dunblane. For natural beauty, the Trossach Mountains begin to
approach the majesty of the Highlands, the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park
has plenty of wooded glens, and the banks of Loch Lomond are famously
bonnie in both song and reality.
Getting to Fife and the Trossachs
You don’t necessarily need a car if you’re just going to visit St. Andrews
or Stirling, because both places are navigable by foot. If your visit is a
day trip from Edinburgh or Glasgow, for example, consider taking a train
or the bus. Even if you want to see an attraction that lies outside the
towns, additional trains and buses are available for short jaunts.
 By car: To get to St. Andrews from Edinburgh, cross the Forth
Bridge and catch the A92 to the A91. From Glasgow to St. Andrews,
take the M80 north toward Stirling, then take the A91. The A91 con-
nects Stirling and St. Andrews. To get to Stirling from Edinburgh,
take the M9; from Glasgow, take the M80. To get to Callander and
Trossachs, catch the A84 from Stirling. To get to Loch Lomond,
follow the A82 out of Glasgow or the A811 from Stirling.
 By train: To get to Fife from Edinburgh, take the Fife loop, operated
by First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscotrail.com)
from Haymarket Station. There is no direct train service to St.
Andrews, but there’s a stop some 13km (8 miles) away at the town
of Leuchars. The trip from Edinburgh Haymarket takes about one
hour and costs between £14 and £25 ($26–$46). After you arrive at
Leuchars, you can take a bus to St. Andrews.
To get to Stirling, trains depart from Edinburgh Waverley and
Glasgow Queen Street stations. There are no railway lines into the
Trossachs, per se, but you can take the train to Balloch, near Loch
Lomond, from Glasgow.
 By bus: For bus timetables, call % 0871-200-2233 or log onto
www.travelinescotland.com. The bus ride from Edinburgh to St.
Andrews takes about two hours. The ride from Glasgow to Stirling
takes about 45 minutes.
Spending the Night
Before you pick your accommodations, it’s a good idea to decide what
you want to see and in what order so you don’t find yourself criss-
crossing the area needlessly. For more accommodations choices than
those listed below, such as smaller B&Bs, contact the tourism board
(% 0845-22-55-121; www.visitscotland.com).

If you don’t like what you see below, a few of my “Dining Locally” 
recommendations — Creagan House and Mhor, for example — also
have overnight rooms. Some of the hotels and inns I list have earned
star ratings from the tourist board (see Chapter 8 for a description of
the rating system). Rates below include full breakfast, unless other-
wise stated. And remember: You may well get a better deal than the
advertised “rack” rates.
The Craw’s Nest Hotel
$$–$$$
Anstruther
Once a minister’s house (or manse), the Nest traded holiness for hospi-
tality when the building became a hotel. Part of a relatively new company
called Symphony Hotels since 2006, this inn has six suites and two double
rooms with four-poster beds amid its 50 units. If you want nice views, ask
for a room in the wing overlooking the sea and the Isle of May.

Cromlix House

Kinbuck
This four-star small hotel is a sportsman’s dream, traditionally drawing
fishermen and hunters with its 1,200 hectares (2,000 acres) of woodlands
that stretch to the Allan Water. But Cromlix House is very romantic as well.
The restored three-story Victorian pile captures the elegance of affluence
in the 19th century; the sitting rooms and guest rooms are decorated with
fine art and period furniture, and common areas such as the library and

De Vere Cameron House
$$$$
Luss
Posh, plush, and perched on the shores of Loch Lomond, the five-star
Cameron House hotel offers premier lodgings. The midrange deluxe rooms
face the water, while the luxury suites are part of the original house and
allow guests to have their meals in the sitting rooms. Dining options
include the fine haute cuisine of Lomonds, as well as the more casual
Cameron Grill with plenty of Scottish produce featured on the menu.

Drover’s Inn
$$
Inverarnan
The stuffed, snarling, and slightly worn animals near the entrance give a
pretty good hint about the nature of this rustic tavern with restaurant and
overnight rooms. The atmospheric pub usually has an open fire going,
barmen in kilts, and plenty of travelers nursing their drinks. There are 10
overnight units in the original house, built in 1705, and another 16 rooms
have been added in a new building.

Gleneagles
$$$$
Auchterarder
Arguably Scotland’s most famous hotel-and-golf resort, Gleneagles was
built as a swanky inn in 1924 in the style of a French chateau. Who needs
Versailles, when you can have a “Riviera in the Highlands,” as the initial
acclaim raved? There are more than 250 rooms, the best of which are the
specially decorated suites. The Whisky Suites, for example, have separate
sitting rooms with dining spaces for sipping single malts or having a
relaxed breakfast in your robe. The hotel has its own restaurant, but better
still is the one on the premises run by chef Andrew Fairlie (see “Dining
Locally,” later in this chapter).

The Inn at Lathones
$$$
Near Largoward
The Inn at Lathones is set in a picturesque spot just 8km (5 miles) from St.
Andrews. It may be 400 years old, but the inn’s overnight rooms are thor-
oughly modern, equipped with Italian furniture, stereos and roomy bath-
rooms. Recent renovations added six more luxury units. The main house,
with a restaurant, offers comfortable public areas with fireplaces and sit-
ting rooms. The bar normally stocks a good selection of Scottish ales and
whiskies.

Old Course Hotel
$$$$
St. Andrews
This hotel overlooks the 17th fairway — the infamous “Road Hole” — of its
namesake, St. Andrews Old Course (to which the hotel has no formal con-
nection). It is a world-class operation, with price tags to match. The hotel
boasts full spa facilities. The eating and drinking options encompass the
contemporary Sands seafood bar and restaurant, and fine dining at the
Road Hole Grill, where gentlemen are encouraged to wear jackets to
dinner, or the Jigger Inn, a whitewashed traditional pub that serves as the
unofficial 19th hole for the adjacent golf course. Children younger than 12
can stay in parent’s rooms at no extra charge.

The Portcullis
$$
Stirling
This little hotel sits in the shadow of Stirling Castle. The rooms are com-
fortable but unpretentious, and the staff members are generally friendly.
The Portcullis has been around for hundreds of years and has the rustic
feel of an old coach inn and tavern. The downstairs bar is a plus or a
minus, depending on your point of view — it’s perfect for a nightcap, not
so perfect if you want to be in bed before 10 p.m. An added touch is the
flowers that grow in the lovely walled-in beer garden.

Roman Camp
$$$
Callander
This country-house hotel near Roman ruins is one of the more interesting
places to stay in the area. Built in 1625 as a hunting lodge, it became a hotel
in the 1930s, retaining charming low ceilings, creaking corridors, and snug
furniture. The drawing room and conservatory have lovely period furni-
ture and antiques. The River Teith runs along the hotel’s beautiful 8
hectares (20 acres) of grounds.

The Stirling Highland is housed in a converted Victorian high school. In
the city’s Old Town, this luxury four-star hotel is in easy hoofing distance

Dining Locally
Your dining needs may be satisfied by your hotel, between a full break-
fast in the morning and a meal in the dining room at night. But if you
decide to step outside your hostelry for a bite, this section guides you
toward some of the best options — including some of the top dining in
all of Scotland. Remember that a few places listed below have overnight
rooms, too.
Barnton Bar & Bistro
$–$$
Stirling
PUB FOOD
The city of Stirling isn’t exactly rich in dining options, but this casual place
is welcoming enough for a coffee, lunch, or an early-evening meal. While
there’s nothing particularly outstanding on the menu, the Barnton is a
friendly and relatively inexpensive place in the middle of Stirling and near
the railway station. The premises are a converted pharmacy with a games
room to the rear, usually populated with university students.
See map p. 319. 3 Barnton St. % 01786-461-698. www.thebistro.co.uk. Main
courses: £5–£10 ($9.25–$19). MC, V. Open: Restaurant daily 10:30 a.m.–7:30 p.m.; bar
Sun–Thurs noon to midnight, Fri–Sat noon to 1 a.m.
The Cellar
$$$
Anstruther
SEAFOOD/SCOTTISH
The Cellar is among the best restaurants in the region. Located in an
ancient fishing village and next door to a fisheries museum, the restaurant
is a hot spot for delicacies from the sea. In addition to staples such as crab,
scallops, and lobster, the mostly seafood menu includes Scottish beef and
dishes such as crayfish-and-mussel bisque and monkfish with herb and
garlic sauce. The stone basement dining room is unassuming and com-
fortable, with candlelight and fireplaces.
See map p. 307. 24 East Green, off the courtyard behind the Fisheries Museum.

Clive Ramsay Cafe and Restaurant
$$
Bridge of Allan
CAFE/BRASSERIE
Bridge of Allan is a pretty village (and wealthy suburban enclave) just out-
side of Stirling. This modern cafe and restaurant tends to be where the
more discerning local diners go for lunch and dinner. Adjacent to its sister
deli and specializing in quality Scottish produce, Clive Ramsay Cafe and
Restaurant offers anything from a simple tea and scone to main courses
such as a beef pot-roast or top-notch fish and chips. If you’re planning a
picnic, the deli is the place to fill your hamper.
See map p. 317. 28 Henderson St. % 01786-833-903. www.cliveramsay.com.
Main courses: £6–£10 ($11–$19). MC, V. Open: Daily 8 a.m.–9 p.m.
Creagan House
$$$
Strathyre
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
Cherry and Gordon Gunn run this charming inn, well situated for country
walks, in a 17th-century farmhouse with a few overnight rooms. In the
evenings, Gordon repairs to the kitchen where he cooks some sumptuous
French-influenced meals using mostly local ingredients. Especially wel-
come are the vegetables, often grown just up the road, which he prepares
to accompany the main courses; these veggies are far from an after-
thought. Don’t be fooled by the baronial-style splendor of the dining room,
however. It’s a much, much more recent addition to the historic house. If
you’re spending the night, the units, including one with a four-poster bed,
start at £120 ($222), including full breakfast.
See map p. 317. A84, north of Strathyre. % 01877-384-638. www.creagan

Hermann’s
$$– $$$
Stirling
AUSTRIAN/SCOTTISH
This simply decorated restaurant — named after Tyrolean owner Hermann
Aschaber — has a unique menu influenced by both Austria and Scotland.
So, will it be jägerschnitzel or roast Barbary duck breast? The aproned
staff is excellent and helpful in decoding the menu. And don’t even think
about skipping the wonderful Austrian desserts. You can’t beat the loca-
tion here, just down the road from Stirling Castle.
See map p. 319. 58 Broad St. % 01786-450-632. Reservations recommended. Main
courses: £16–£20 ($30–$37). AE, DC, MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6–10 p.m.
The Inn at Kippen
$$
Kippen
SCOTTISH
About a 15-minute drive west of Stirling on the A811, Kippen is a typical
country village in the rolling hills north of Glasgow. The Inn at Kippen is a
modern version of the country pub and restaurant, which specializes in

6–9 p.m.
Mhor
$$$
Balquhidder
MODERN SCOTTISH
Just up the highway from Creagan House, here is another gem in the heart
of the Trossachs serving lunch and dinner at an 18th-century farmhouse
that overlooks Loch Voil near the village of Balquhidder. The sunroom
dining space is modern and so is the cooking, specializing in seasonal
goods. Roast chicken topped with foie gras, belly of pork served with sage
and onion jus, or seared fish on a bed of shredded celeriac are just some
examples. Dinner is expensive (albeit worth it), though lunches are less
costly. The adjoining Monachyle Mhor hotel has 14 attractive rooms start-
ing at £105 ($194), which includes breakfast. And in the town of Callander,
the same people have an outstanding fish and chips restaurant, Mhor Fish.
See map p. 317. Off the A84 near Balquhidder (9.5km/6 miles west of turnoff).

Ostlers Close
$$–$$$
Cupar
MODERN SCOTTISH
Fife has a host of good restaurants, and this charming one in a 17th-cen-
tury building is among the best. Located in the town of Cupar, west of St.
Andrews, Ostlers Close emphasizes fresh and local produce. The daily
changing menus can feature dishes such as seared Isle of Mull scallops,
roast saddle of venison, or roast fillet of Pittenweem cod. It’s open only for
lunch on Saturday.
See map p. 307. 25 Bonnygate, Cupar (11km/7 miles west of St. Andrews).

12:15–2 p.m.
Peat Inn
$$$
Near Cupar
MODERN SCOTTISH/FRENCH
The Peat Inn has long had a great reputation but came under new owner-
ship in 2006. Luckily, it was taken over by chef Geoffrey Smeddle, who
brought his own awards and accolades. The main white-washed building
dates to 1760, with eight overnight suites in the adjacent “Residence” (dou-
bles are £175/$324). Meals highlight local, seasonal ingredients in dishes
such as seared scallops with fennel puree, roast filet of beef with
chanterelle mushrooms, or tayberry and elderflower tart.

Restaurant Andrew Fairlie 
$$$$
Auchterarder
FRENCH
Andrew Fairlie is probably the most talented chef in Scotland: He not only
has prowess in the kitchen but also knows how to bring together a talented
team. Dinners here are seamless but not particularly stuffy affairs. If you
have the money, go for the six-course tasting, or dégustation, menu. The
chef’s signature dish is smoked lobster, but other highlights may include
foie gras terrine with apricot and grapefruit chutney or “twice-cooked”
Gressingham duck with oriental watercress salad. In 2006, Fairlie received
two Michelin stars — joining an elite group in the U.K.

The Seafood Restaurant

St. Andrews
FISH/SEAFOOD
This St. Andrews restaurant is a second branch for owner Tim Butler and
his business partner, chef Craig Millar, who began their Seafood Restaurant
farther down the coast in St. Monans. Here, the location on the seafront is
spectacular, and given that the dining room is essentially housed in a glass
box, there is no missing the views. Dishes range from crab risotto to pan-
seared scallops, with plenty of fancy accompaniments on the side.
See map p. 315. The Scores, St. Andrews. % 01334-479-475. www.thesea

Exploring Fife to the Trossachs
There is a lot to cover in this region, which stretches across the country.
The highlight of Fife for golfers is undoubtedly St. Andrews, which many
consider the most sacred spot of the sport. But the town itself, named
after the country’s patron saint, is also of ecclesiastical and scholarly
importance. Closer to Edinburgh, Dunfermline was once the capital of
Scotland; its abbey witnessed the births of royalty and contains the
burial grounds of several royals as well.
Northeast of Glasgow is historic Stirling, with Stirling Castle set dramati-
cally on the hill above the town. During the reign of the Stuart family
monarchs in the 16th century, royalty preferred Stirling to Edinburgh, so
it became the de facto capital of the country. The coronation of Mary
Queen of Scots, only a child at the time, took place in Stirling. High on

another hill outside city center stands the prominent Wallace Monument.
Nearby, Stirling Bridge is believed to be the crucial site of a 13th-century
battle between English invaders and the rag-tag band of Scots led by
William Wallace (forever immortalized — if fictionalized, as well — in the
movie Braveheart). On the southern outskirts of the city is another, more
famous battleground: Bannockburn. Somewhere around here in 1314, a
well-armed English-led force was routed by Scottish troops headed by
King Robert the Bruce.
More of a ruin than Stirling Castle, but arguably more evocative, is Doune
Castle near the town of Dunblane, which has its own attractive and his-
toric cathedral. Farther west-northwest of Stirling are the Trossachs, a
mountain range distinct from the Highlands but appealing for its forests
and lochs. One key attraction here is Loch Katrine, popularized by Sir
Walter Scott’s poem The Lady of the Lake. Two villages that provide gate-
ways to the more mountainous northern regions are Callander and
Aberfoyle. They’re often overrun by the bus tours in the high season
because they offer places to rest, eat, and shop during the day.
Want to save a buck or two? At some attractions, you can pay a single
discounted price for admission to more than one site: St. Andrews Castle
and St. Andrews Cathedral, for example.

Andrew Carnegie Birthplace Museum
Dunfermline
In 1835, future U.S. industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie was
born just down the hill from Dunfermline Abbey. This museum is com-
posed of the 18th-century cottage where he lived as a child and a memo-
rial hall funded by his widow, Louise. Displays tell the story of this
weaver’s son, who immigrated to America and became one of the richest
men in the world. Though a union-busting industrialist, Carnegie gave
away hundreds of millions of dollars before his death in 1919. Dunfermline
received the first of some 2,810 lending libraries he provided throughout
Great Britain and America, and the town was also bequeathed Pittencrieff
Park. A statue in the park honors Carnegie, who once worked as a bobbin
boy in a cotton factory. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 307. Moodie Street, Dunfermline. % 01383-723-638. www.carnegie

Near Loch Lomond
Maintained by the Forestry Commission, the Argyll Forest Park offers some
24,000 hectares (60,000 acres) to explore from forest trails to the “Arrochar

scramble to a rocky perch, try your chances by climbing the Cobbler, whose

craggy peak is hard to miss. The trail begins at the head of Loch Long just
north of the village of Arrochar on the A83. On a clear day, the view from
the summit takes in a good portion of the west coast of Scotland. The area
is home to acres of wildflowers, birds, and even seals in the sea lochs. For
park information and trail maps, visit the Ardgartan Visitor Center (A83,
Loch Long; % 01301-702-432) or log on to www.forestry.gov.uk. Allow
two to five hours.

Argyll’s Lodging
Stirling
Sir William Alexander, the founder of Nova Scotia (or “New Scotland”),
built this 17th-century town house, one of Scotland’s finest surviving
Renaissance homes. After being used as a youth hostel in the 20th cen-
tury, the house is today decorated as it would have been in 1680, when the
ninth earl of Argyll lived here, with accurate historic ornaments and period
furniture, plus tapestries, paintings, and even clothing from the era. Allow
about one hour for tour.

9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Bannockburn Heritage Centre
Near Stirling
The once boggy land along a stream called the Bannock Burn near Stirling
was the scene of King Robert the Bruce’s victory over the troops of English
King Edward II in 1314. The decisive win helped to ensure that Scotland
kept its independence from England. The Bannockburn Heritage Centre,
run by the National Trust for Scotland, has various exhibits (and gives visi-
tors an opportunity to don some chain mail armor) and also shows an
audiovisual presentation re-creating the battle and telling Bruce’s story. A
short walk through a grassy park (open year round) takes you to an
impressive statue of the Bruce on his steed. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 317. Glasgow Road, off the M80. % 01786-812-664. www.nts.org.uk.
Admission: £5 ($9.25) adults, £4 ($7.40) seniors and children, £14 ($26) family. Open:

Deep Sea World
North Queensferry
In the early 1990s, a group of entrepreneurs sealed the edges of an aban-
doned rock quarry under the Forth Rail Bridge, filled it with sea water, and
positioned a 112m (370-ft.) acrylic tunnel on the bottom. Stocked with a
menagerie of sea creatures, it is Scotland’s most comprehensive aquarium.
Now, compared to what you find in cities such as Orlando, this may seem
amateurish. But, from the submerged tunnel, you view kelp forests; sandy

Hitting the links in St. Andrews
The medieval royal burgh of St. Andrews, about 80km (50 miles) from Edinburgh, was
once filled with monasteries and ancient buildings, but only a few ruins of its early his-
tory survive. Once a revered place of Christian pilgrimage, today the historic town by
the sea is best known for golf. It has been played here at least as long ago as the 1600s,
though some believe much earlier. The rules of the sport are reviewed, revised, and
clarified in St. Andrews by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, while its Old Course is per-
haps the most famous 18 holes in the world. Golfers consider this town to be hallowed
ground.
St. Andrews has five 18-hole courses (www.standrews.org.uk) and one course
with only 9 holes for beginners and children, all owned by a trust and open to the public.
They are:
 Old Course: Where the Open is frequently played; the course possibly dates to the
15th century
 New Course: Designed by Old Tom Morris in 1895
 Jubilee Course: Opened in 1897 in honor of Queen Victoria
 Eden Course: Opened in 1914
 Strathtyrum Course: The least difficult 18 holes, designed for those with high or no
handicaps
 Balgove: The 9-hole course designed for beginners and hackers; turn up and play
For the 18-hole courses, except the Old Course, you should try to reserve your tee time
at least one month in advance. You might get onto Jubilee, Eden, or Strathtyrum with
only 24-hour notice if you’re lucky. The reservation office is at % 01334-466-666. Online
bookings for the New Course, Jubilee, Eden, and Strathtyrum can be made by logging
on to www.linksnet.co.uk.
The Old Course, which frequently hosts the Open (it returns in 2010), is a different kettle
of fish: First you need a handicap of 24 for men and 36 for women. You apply in writing
one year in advance and, even then, there are no guarantees. There is a daily ballot or
lottery, which gives out about 50 percent of the tee times for the following day’s play.
Apply in person or by telephone before 2 p.m. on the day before play. By post, send appli-
cations to Reservations Office, Pilmour House, St. Andrews KY16 9SF, Scotland. Single
golfers wishing to play the Old Course should contact the reservations department at
reservations@standrews.org.uk.
Greens fees vary from course to course and depending on the time of year. Generally
speaking, for the 18-hole courses, expect to pay between £16 ($30; Strathtyrum in Mar)
and £125 ($231; Old Course in summer). From November to March, it costs £70 ($130) to
play the Old Course, using mats that protect the fairways, and between £12 and £32
($22–$59) for the other 18-hole courses.

flats that shelter bottom-dwelling schools of stingray, turbot, and sole; and
murky caves favored by conger eels and small sharks. Curiously, the cur-
vature of the tunnel’s thick clear plastic makes everything seem about 30
percent smaller than it really is. However, for £155 ($287), you can arrange
a “shark dive” and see everything full size. Allow about two hours.

Doune Castle
Doune
Fans of the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail may recognize the exterior
of Doune Castle, seeing as it served as a location for several scenes in the
movie. The castle’s restoration by Historic Scotland has been mostly limi-
ted to making certain the stone structure doesn’t fall down, so visitors
(especially those with good imaginations) actually get a better idea of what
living here in the 14th century may have been like. The castle’s low doors,
narrow spiral stairs, and overall feeling of damp really drive home the
experience of medieval life. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 317. Off the A84 (6.5km/10 miles northwest of Stirling). % 01786-841-742.
www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £4.20 ($7.80) adults, £3.20 ($5.90)
seniors, £2.10 ($3.90) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.;
Oct–Mar daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. (closed Thurs–Fri Nov–Mar).
Dunfermline Abbey and Palace
Dunfermline
The ancient town of Dunfermline, 23km (14 miles) northwest of Edinburgh,
was a place of royal residence as early as the 11th century. The last British
monarch born in Scotland, Charles I, came into the world at Dunfermline.
Its abbey was constructed on the site of a Celtic church and a priory
church built under the auspices of Queen Margaret around 1070. Some 50
years later work began on a new priory, which can be visited as the
Romanesque “Medieval Nave” today. Abbey status was bestowed in 1150,
and thereafter a string of royalty, beginning with David I, was buried at the
Chapter 16: Fife to the Trossachs 321
Facilities for golfers in St. Andrews are legion. Virtually every hotel in town provides
assistance to golfers. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club, founded in 1754, remains more
or less rigidly closed as a private-membership men’s club, however. It does traditionally
open the doors to the public on St. Andrews Day to view the trophy room. This usually
falls on November 30.
If you’re looking for more golf-related information, try the tourist office in St. Andrews
at 70 Market St. (% 01334-472-021). It’s open year-round Monday through Saturday and
on Sunday, too, during the high season. Call for hours.

abbey, including Robert the Bruce. The newer sections of the abbey
church were built in 1818, and the pulpit was placed over the tomb and
memorial to the Bruce. The remains of the royal palace are adjacent to the
abbey. Only the southwest wall remains of this once-regal edifice. Allow
about two hours.
See map p. 307. St. Margaret’s Street, off the M90. % 01383-739-026. www.
historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £3.50 ($6.50) adults, £3 ($5.55) seniors,

Falkland Palace and Garden
Falkland
A rather expensive National Trust attraction to visit, Falkland Palace in Fife
was a royal hunting lodge and country home, constructed for the Stuart
monarchs between 1450 and 1541. Among the rulers who resided in this
impressive specimen of Renaissance architecture were a young Mary
Queen of Scots and her father, James V. The highlights of the palace are the
ornate Chapel Royal, King’s Bedchamber, and Queen’s Room. The gardens
were devised after World War II. Also on the grounds is the royal tennis
court, only one of two to survive since the 1500s. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 307. High Street, just off the M90, at Junction 8. % 01337-857-397.
www.nts.org.uk. Admission: £10 ($19) adults; £7 ($13) seniors, students, and chil-
dren; £25 ($46) family. Open: Mar–Oct Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Sun 1–5 p.m. Closed
Nov–Mar.
Church of the Holy Rude
Stirling
Among the many interesting aspects of this medieval church — Stirling’s
second oldest building after the nearby castle — are bullet holes made by
Cromwell’s troops in the 17th century. Dating in parts to the middle of the
1400s, the Church of the Holy Rude (or Holy Cross) is where Protestant
firebrand John Knox preached at the crowning of the one-year-old James
VI in 1567. The churchyard and cemetery are worth a walk about for the
views and monuments, including a pyramid-shaped one in memory of the
Covenanters, who defended the Presbyterian faith. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 319. St. John Street. % 01786-475-275. www.holyrude.org.
Admission: Donation requested. Open: Easter to Sept daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m. Closed Oct
to day before Easter.
Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery
Kirkcaldy
This place, while modest, is a real find. The artwork in the second-floor
galleries is among the best collections by Scottish artists. An entire room
is devoted to the brightly hued still-life paintings and landscapes by
Scottish Colourist S.J. Peploe. There is more work by Hornel, Hunter, and
Fergusson. Another highlight of the collection is a range of paintings by
Part IV: The Major Regions 
322

William McTaggart. In addition, you can compare the abstract pure beauty
of, say, Joan Eardley’s Breaking Wave to a recent portrait by Scotland’s
best-selling, if critically panned, contemporary painter, Jack Vettriano. No
comparison. This unassuming and humble attraction is arguably the best
small provincial art gallery in Scotland. What’s more, all they request are
donations from visitors. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park
West Dumbartonshire
Loch Lomond, the largest inland body of water in all of Great Britain, is
about a 45-minute drive or train ride from the Glasgow city limits. At the
loch’s southern edge, near the otherwise unremarkable if pleasant town
of Balloch, the Lomond Shores development (www.lochlomond
shores.com) was opened in 2002. The complex includes a shopping mall,
aquarium, and the National Park Gateway Centre, which offers information
on the adjacent national park — Scotland’s first — that extends up the
eastern shores of the loch, comprising some 1,865 sq. km (720 sq. miles).
If you’re hiking, the trails up the eastern shoreline are preferable. This is
the route that the West Highland Way follows (see sidebar, “Hiking the
West Highland Way”). If you are a canoeing or kayaking enthusiast, the
Lomond Shores’ visitor center has rentals (% 01389-602-576; www.
canyouexperience.com) for £15 ($28) per hour. Up the western shores,
before the notoriously winding road at Tarbet, where the train from
Glasgow to Oban stops, visitors can take loch cruises. Golfers will likely
be attracted to the Loch Lomond country club, which hosts the annual
Scottish Open professional golf championship, near the pleasant resort
village of Luss. Allow anywhere from two hours to a full day, depending on
your interest.

Queen Elizabeth Forest Park
Stirlingshire
East of Loch Lomond, the Queen Elizabeth Forest Park has thousands of
acres of unspoiled nature. Many trails wind through the woods and hills of
the region, managed by the Forestry Commission. The visitor center (with
information and maps), at the David Marshall Lodge near Aberfoyle, is a
good base for hiking excursions. If nature walks aren’t your thing, how-
ever, there are good picnic spots — or you can motor through a part of
the park on the scenic Achray Forest Drive (A821). Allow two to four hours.
See map p. 317. David Marshall Lodge, off the A821. % 01877-382-258.

center daily 11 a.m.–4 p.m.

St. Andrews Cathedral
St. Andrews
Near the Celtic Church of Blessed Mary on the Rock, and by the sea at the
east end of town, is St. Andrews Cathedral. Once the largest church in
Scotland, it was founded in 1161. The cathedral certified the town as the
ecclesiastical capital of the country, but the ruins can only suggest its
former beauty and importance. There’s a collection of early Christian and
medieval monuments, as well as artifacts discovered on the cathedral site.
Admission allows entry to nearby St. Andrews Castle, where the medieval
clergy lived. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 315. A91, off Pends Road. % 01334-472-563. www.historic-

iors, £3.50 ($6.50) children 5–15. Open: Apr–Sept daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar
daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
SS Sir Walter Scott Steamship
Loch Katrine
For more than 100 years, this old-fashioned ship has taken passengers out
on Loch Katrine to marvel at the beauty of the Trossachs. A bit of floating
history, the ship is the last screw-driven steamship regularly sailing with
passengers in Scotland (and perhaps age is showing as the number of trips
it makes has been reduced in recent years). It runs between the Trossachs
Pier and Stronachlachar and passes an eyeful of stunning views along the
way. The ship is named after the renowned author who made Loch Katrine
famous in his poem The Lady of the Lake. Be warned, however: This popu-
lar trip can get overcrowded in the summer, so if you can, go on a week-
day. Allow about four hours.

Hiking the West Highland Way
One of Scotland’s best-known long-distance footpaths is the West Highland Way, estab-
lished in the 1980s. The trail begins, rather uneventfully, northwest of Glasgow in the
affluent suburb of Milngavie (mill-guy). But as the trail winds some 153km (95 miles)
north along the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, through the desolate and almost pre-
historic-looking Rannoch Moor, along the breathtaking and historic Glen Coe, and ending
finally in Fort William, it just gets better and better. At the northern terminus, you’re at
the foot of Ben Nevis, Scotland’s highest mountain.
Trains run frequently throughout the day from the Queens Street Station in central
Glasgow to Milngavie, the starting point of the walk. The 25-minute trip costs about £3
($5.55) one-way. In Fort William, you can catch the First ScotRail train back to Glasgow.
Hikers can backpack and camp along the way or stay at inns conveniently dotted along
the trail. Tour companies are available to haul your luggage from stop to stop, too. 
For details on the West Highland Way, contact the National Park Gateway Centre at 
% 01389-722-199 or log onto www.west-highland-way.co.uk.

ings Oct–May.
Stirling Castle
Stirling
Once the residence of Scotland’s royalty, this striking Renaissance castle
was used by Kings James IV and James V, as well as by Mary Queen of Scots
(James V’s daughter) and her son, James VI. A natural fortress, the castle
on a hill was the region’s strategic military point throughout much of the
13th and 14th centuries. Holding it was a key element leading to the battle
of Bannockburn, for example. Various renovations are restoring the castle
buildings to a historically accurate state (this, after many years as a 20th-
century military barracks). Even if you don’t bother taking a tour of the
impressive castle (though you probably should), the ramparts and land
surrounding the well-fortified landmark are worth a stroll — particularly
the cemetery and the “Back Walk” along a wall that protected the Old Town
from attack. In the castle grounds proper, you can see both a palace, built
by James V, and the Chapel Royal, which was remodeled by his grandson,
James VI. Recently restored, the castle’s Great Hall is visible for kilometers,
thanks to the creamy, almost yellow exterior that replicates its original
color. Last entry is 45 minutes before closing. Allow about three hours.

For some of the tours, guides don historic garb to take groups through the
paces of penal life here, while others role-play as wardens and inmates to
help enact the history of the jail. This building is a Victorian replacement

Culross: Stepping back in time
Thanks largely to the National Trust for Scotland, this village rather shows what a
Scottish settlement from the 16th to the 18th century looked like. With its cobbled streets
lined by stout cottages featuring crow-stepped gables, Culross may also have been the
birthplace of St. Mungo, who went on to establish the Glasgow Cathedral. James IV
made this port on the Firth of Forth a royal burgh in 1588. The National Trust runs a visi-
tor center (% 01383-880-359; www.nts.org.uk), open daily noon to 5 p.m. from Good
Friday to the end of September, which provides access to the town’s palace and other
sites. Adult admission is £8 ($15).

for the less humane cells in the old tolbooth across the street. Still, when
you see the crank that inmates were made to turn as punishment, one won-
ders if prison existence had improved all that much. On the top of the
building, an observation deck offers good views of the surrounding Old
Town. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.

University of St Andrews
St. Andrews
This is the oldest university in Scotland and the third oldest in Great
Britain, after Oxford and Cambridge. Of its famous students, the most
recent graduate was Prince William, heir to the throne after Charles, Prince
of Wales (or in Scotland, officially Duke of Rothesay). During terms, you
can see packs of students in their characteristic red gowns. The univer-
sity spreads throughout the town today, but the original site was centered
in the districts just west of the Cathedral. The gate tower of St. Salvador
College, on North Street, dates to the 15th century. Allow one hour.
See map p. 315. www.st-andrews.ac.uk.
More cool things to see and do
 British Golf Museum, Bruce Embankment, St. Andrews (% 01334-
478-880; www.britishgolfmuseum.co.uk), is devoted to the history
and popularity of the game. Exhibits reveal the evolution of equip-
ment and rules and remarkable facts and feats of the last 500 years.
 Byre Theatre, Abbey Street, St. Andrews (% 01334-475-000;
www.byretheatre.com), is the cultural center of St. Andrews; it
features dramatic performances ranging from Shakespeare to musi-
cal comedies.
 Holy Trinity Church, off South Street, St. Andrews (% 01334-
474-494), is a medieval church, re-created at the beginning of the
20th century around the impressive tower, which does actually
date to the 1400s. In the original church, John Knox advised the
congregation in June 1559 to cleanse the temple and remove all the
Catholic monuments to idolatry. In that single day, apparently, the
reformation took root in this parish.
 The National Wallace Monument, Alloa Road, Abbey Craig, Stirling
(% 01786-47-2140; www.nationalwallacemonument.com), is a
66m (220-ft.) tower set on top of a hill overlooking the surrounding
terrain; you’re likely to see it if you travel anywhere near Stirling.
Built in the 1860s, the monument’s popularity soared after the
release of Braveheart, Mel Gibson’s hit 1995 movie depicting
William Wallace’s life. A shuttle bus runs between a visitor center
and the monument.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
326

 Rob Roy and the Trossachs Visitor Centre, Callander (% 01877-
330-342; www.robroyvisitorcentre.com), is a museum in the
Trossachs region, home of the Clan MacGregor, which offers two
versions of Rob Roy MacGregor: the tartan Robin Hood and leg-
endary figure of Sir Walter Scott’s novel; and the cattle thief and
blackmailer. Whatever the specifics, Rob Roy was certainly a hero
to his people and an outlaw in defiance of the English.
 Secret Bunker, Troywood, south of St. Andrews (% 01333-310-301;
www.secretbunker.co.uk), is the former underground nuclear
command center where U.K. leaders would have found refuge in the
event of a nuclear war. Kept from public knowledge for decades,
the facility was declassified in the 1990s, and you can now see this
Cold War relic.
Shopping for Local Treasures
Shopping in Stirling and St. Andrews is typical of provincial towns and
cities around Scotland, with the former offering the dubious bonus of a
shopping mall called the Thistle Centre (near the train station). This
area also introduces tourists to another debatable consumer-oriented
attraction in Scotland: Highland gateway towns. Both Aberfoyle and
Callander fit this bill — one-street burghs cluttered with lots of tartan
and woolen shops that attract coach tours, causing the sidewalks to
occasionally overflow with tourists on summer days. The road that runs
along Loch Lomond, the A82, has a few galleries with art. Remember, as I
say in previous chapters, most attractions have decent shops for gifts,
souvenirs, and even local crafts, on occasion. Below are a few sugges-
tions for shops that are a cut above.
 The Fotheringham Gallery, 78 Henderson St., Bridge of Allan 
(% 01786-832-861; www.fotheringham-gallery.co.uk), is a con-
temporary art gallery and shop with handmade designer jewelry,
glass works, sculpture, and paintings — all by contemporary
Scottish artists and craftsmen. Open Monday through Saturday 10
a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
 The Green Gallery, Ballmenoch, Buchlyvie (% 01360-850-180;
www.greengallery.com), was once a standout in the Highland
gateway town of Aberfoyle. Its eclectic collection of contemporary
arts and crafts is now in this neighboring village. Daily except
Thursday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Jim Farmer Golf Shop, 1 St. Mary’s Place, Market Street, 
St. Andrews (% 01334-476-796), should take care of golfers and
maybe even help trim a stroke or two off your handicap (though
Jim himself sold the place to new owners in 2007). Shirts, hats, 
T-shirts, shoes, and more are on hand. Call for hours.

 The Scottish Wool Centre, off Main Street, Aberfoyle (% 01877-
382-850), is an attraction as well as a shop; this is one store where
the kids shouldn’t get bored. Besides exhibits that show everything
you want to know about Scottish wool and more, the Spinner’s
Cottage gives you a chance to make your own wool. There are sheep-
dog demonstrations and a children’s farm (admission charged).
Open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Doing the Pub Crawl
If you’re staying in St. Andrews, check out the watering hole below,
which is a notch or two above the norm. Otherwise, practically every
village and town in the region has a pub, or stick to the local hotels and
inns.
 Central Bar, 77 Market St. (at College Street), St. Andrews (% 01334-
478-296). If you’re looking for a quintessential pub, this is a fine one,
popular with students and offering a good selection of draft beers,
including “guest” ales. Open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to
11:45 p.m., and Sunday from 12:30 p.m.

Chapter 17
Tayside and the Northeast
In This Chapter
 Finding the right place to stay and dine
 Touring a castle or two
 Enjoying a dram of whisky at a Speyside distillery
T
his chapter covers a fairly large chunk of east and northeastern
Scotland: from Dundee and Perth on the River Tay up to the oil-
boom city of Aberdeen, and the eastern Moray (pronounced like the
name Murray) coast. Here you will find several castles on the eastern
fringes of the Grampian Mountains — including Balmoral (the official
royal family retreat) — and a host of whisky distilleries. Yes, the ride up
the highway (A93) to Braemar can be pretty spectacular. But compared
to the Highlands (see Chapter 18), which encroaches on this region from
the west, I just can’t get as excited about the countryside stretching
from Tayside to the Northeast and port towns such as Fraserburgh or
Peterhead.
I’ve kept this chapter succinct, and I suggest that if you head in this
direction, you should concentrate briefly on a couple of towns, such as
Perth and Pitlochry; or quaint coastal harbors such as Stonehaven and
Pennan (the latter made famous by the film Local Hero). You should visit
a few castles, trek through Royal Deeside, and, finally, hit a distillery or
two near the River Spey.
There are two bona fide cities in this region: Dundee and Aberdeen. The
latter is known as the Granite City, because many of the city center
buildings are made from the same sturdy (if somewhat dull) gray stone.
Aberdeen is also Scotland’s natural-gas capital, the place where the oil
industry, tapping petroleum reserves way out in the North Sea, has its
mainland operations. The city has plenty of bars and restaurants but is
rather short on attractions, if you ask me.
Perth is a rather attractive town situated on the River Tay between two
large parks, North and South Inch. A royal burgh since the 1200s, Perth
has a couple of fine restaurants and lies near one of Scotland’s most his-
toric attractions: Scone Palace. Pitlochry is one of the most visited
inland resort towns in Scotland, mainly because it’s just off a main
artery (the A9 highway) leading up to Inverness and the Highlands.

Getting There
Getting to and around this part of Scotland isn’t quite as easy as it is in
other parts of the country. Trains run to Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen,
but the branch system isn’t well developed. Bus service to the larger
towns is reasonable, but in the end, you’re likely to want a car to see the
main attractions.
 By car: From Edinburgh, take the M90 north to Perth, where you
have the option of using the A90 along the east coast to Aberdeen,
the A9 inland through Pitlochry, or the narrower A93 via Braemar.
From Glasgow, use the M80 (A80) to the M9 (A9), which takes you
to Perth.
 The scenic route is A93, which goes past Braemar, Ballater, and
Banchory on its way to Aberdeen.
 By bus: Scottish Citylink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.
co.uk) routes cover the two cities and major towns. A typical round-
trip bus fare from Edinburgh to Aberdeen is about £30 ($56) and the
journey takes about four hours. A trip from Glasgow to Perth costs
around £12 ($22) and takes approximately 11⁄2 hours.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 08457-48-49-50; www.firstscotrail.
com) travels to cities and major towns in the region, including
Perth, Pitlochry, Dundee, Arbroath, and Aberdeen. You then have
to rely on buses or local taxis to venture farther after you arrive in
these towns. ScotRail service dovetails with long-distance trains
from England. You can also call National Railway Enquiries at the
First ScotRail phone number above for details. Just to give you an
idea of prices: A one-way (single) ticket from Glasgow to Aberdeen
costs between £10 and £60 ($19–$110), depending upon how early
you buy it and whether you opt for a “fully flexible” ticket. The trip
takes just over 21⁄2 hours.
 By ferry: NorthLink Orkney & Shetland Ferries Ltd. (% 01855-
851-144) runs services between Aberdeen and Lerwick.
 By plane: The Aberdeen Airport (% 01224-722-331; www.
aberdeenairport.com) is 9.5km (6 miles) north of town. Planes
connect Aberdeen to London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and Dundee, as
well as the Shetland and Orkney islands. A typical flight from
London Heathrow to Aberdeen might cost about £80 ($150). Use
the airport Web site for latest timetables and prices. The Dundee
Airport (% 01382-643-242) is on Riverside Drive; it has service to
Aberdeen and Edinburgh.

Tayside and the Northeast
Chapter 17: Tayside and the Northeast 331

Spending the Night
Because Tayside and the Northeast form a fairly large area, you should try
to choose accommodations nearest to the key attractions you want to see.
Some of the hotels and guesthouses listed here have earned star ratings
from the tourist board; see Chapter 8 for a description of VisitScotland’s
rating system. Rates include full breakfast unless otherwise stated. And
remember: You may well get a better deal than the advertised “rack” rates.
Braemar Lodge Hotel
$$
Braemar
This homey, granite-built country house — a renovated Victorian hunting
lodge — offers unpretentious, comfortable accommodations. If the hotel
is small, the rooms are reasonably spacious and most have views of the
mountains. At the oak-paneled bar, guests can sip a whisky nightcap in
front of a log fire. If the Victorian shooting lodge isn’t down-home enough
for you, log cabins with kitchens are also available for rent by the week
and there is also a “bunkhouse” hostel on the grounds.
See map p. 331. 6 Glenshee Rd. % 01339-741-627. www.braemarlodge.co.uk.
Rack rates: About £70 ($130) double (without breakfast). MC, V.
Craigellachie Hotel
$$$
Speyside
Close to a clutch of whisky distilleries, including Glenfiddich, this charm-
ing and hospitable hotel is perhaps best known for its Quaich Bar, a vir-
tual library of single-malt whiskies, with some 550 bottles lining the
shelves around the entire room. Find the one you prefer and the bartender
will pour you a dram. Since 1893, the hotel has served as a welcome retreat
in the heart of rural Speyside; although its corporate owner went belly up,
new proprietors are trying to maintain its reputation. By the way, the
hotel’s name is pronounced, roughly, kray-gell-ah-key.
See map p. 331. Off the A93, Craigellachie, Speyside. (3km/2 miles northwest of
Dufftown). % 01340-881-204. Fax: 01340-881-253. www.oxfordhotelsand
inns.com. Rack rate: About £135 ($250). AE, DC, MC, V.
Darroch Learg
$$$
Ballater
Set on a wooded hillside overlooking the road and the River Dee beyond,
this is one of the more highly regarded hotels in the entire region. Stately
but friendly, with a reputation for good food, Darroch Learg is my choice
to spend a night near the royal spread in Balmoral. A dozen overnight
rooms in the main lodge are complemented with five more in a nearby
annex. All are well appointed and comfortable.
See map p. 331. Braemar Road (off the A93), on the west side of town. % 01339-
755-443. Fax: 01339-755-252. www.darrochlearg.co.uk. Rack rates: £110–£200
($204–$370) double. AE, DC, MC, V. Closed Jan.

Fasganeoin Country House
$$
Pitlochry
Just off the main drag, this three-star guesthouse is a few minutes’ walk
from Pitlochry’s town center, or a riverside stroll to the Festival Theatre.
The rooms (not all en suite) are generally comfy and cute, featuring flower
and antique motifs. The peaceful grounds offer a lovely respite. Fasganeoin
(faze-gan-non) means “place for the birds” in Gaelic.

Macdonald’s Restaurant & Guest House
$
Pitlochry 
This popular inn and dining room on the main drag through Pitlochry has
a loyal following. And why not? The rooms are nicely decorated and the
hospitality is generous. But more importantly, you would be very hard-
pressed to beat the price these days. In addition to the restaurant, the
premises also have a well-regarded fish and chips cafe.

The Marcliffe Hotel and Spa
$$$–$$$$
Aberdeen
This hotel, once known as Marcliffe at Pitfodels, is probably the best place
to stay in Aberdeen. It’s certainly often recommended, probably because
it combines high-class five-star accommodations with intimate attention.
The three-story hotel sits among trees and has a country feel despite its
proximity to the city. All of the 35 individually decorated rooms (plus 7
suites) are comfortable and spacious, the beds huge, and the antique fur-
niture done in good taste. Spa treatments include aromatherapy.
See map p. 331. North Deeside Road, off the A92 (3 miles from Aberdeen city centre).
% 01224-861-000. Fax: 01224-868-860. www.marcliffe.com. Rack rates: £215
($398) double. AE, DC, MC, V.
Parklands Hotel
$$–$$$
Perth
This four-star small hotel occupies a stylish Georgian town house once
owned by Perth’s lord provost (similar to an honorary mayor).
Overlooking the woods of South Inch Park and near the railroad station,
the Parklands is a peaceful oasis in a bustling little town. The 14 rooms are
nicely decorated with flat-screen TVs. There are two restaurants, the
Acanthus and the less formal No. 1 the Bank.
See map p. 331. 2 St. Leonard’s Bank. % 01738-622-451. Fax: 01738-622-046. www.the

Chapter 17: Tayside and the Northeast 333

Salutation Hotel
$$
Perth
It’s right on the main street of Perth, so the 84-bed Salutation benefits from
a central location. After you’ve walked all over town and had your dinner,
relax with a nightcap in the huge overstuffed couches by the fire in the
lobby. It’s no wonder the staff has its act together — a hotel at this site
has been welcoming guests since 1699.
See map p. 331. 34 South St., near the River Tay. % 01738-630-066. www.strathmore
hotels.com. Rack rates: £80–£150 ($148–$280) double. AE, MC, V.
Dining Locally
Your best option in the area could be right in your own hotel, but here
are a few other places to consider.
Jute Cafe Bar
$–$$
Dundee
INTERNATIONAL
This pleasant, airy cafe/bar is part of the Dundee Contemporary Arts com-
plex in the so-called cultural quarter of the city, and it’s one of Dundee’s
highlights. After the kitchen closes for the night (normally around 9:30
p.m.), it’s a lively bar and one of the places to be seen in Dundee.
See map p. 331. 152 Nethergate. % 01382-909-246. www.dca.org.uk. Main
courses: £8–£15 ($15–$28). MC, V. Open: Daily 10:30 a.m. to midnight (from noon on
Sun).
Deans @ Let’s Eat
$$–$$$
Perth
SCOTTISH/FRENCH
In 2005, chef Willie Deans and his wife, Margo, took over ownership of this
well-regarded restaurant and put their stamp on the place, formerly known
as Let’s Eat (refurbished in 2007). Deans is a member of the Master Chefs
of Great Britain, and his cooking usually has its share of flourishes. A typ-
ical menu will have dishes such as seared scallops with Stornoway black
pudding, apple salad, and spiced cider vinaigrette.
See map p. 331. 77–79 Kinnoull St. % 01738-643-377. www.letseatperth.co.uk.

SCOTTISH/SEAFOOD
In the early 2000s, this place captured the attention of the Michelin Guide
inspectors, who bestowed their award for good food at reasonable prices.
Since then, however, the proprietors have sold and moved on; meanwhile

the reputation of the restaurant has diminished — though the setting near
the River Tummel remains very nice indeed.

noon to 9 p.m.
Silver Darling
$$$–$$$$
Aberdeen
SEAFOOD
Getting to this restaurant at the water’s edge is a wee bit of an odyssey,
but it’s worth it. In the dining room, overlooking the entrance to the
harbor, you find succulent French-influenced dishes using local produce,
such as pan-fried halibut with crab gnocchi, ratatouille, and salad. The
menu is pricey, but from the sea views to some of the highest-quality food
in the area, Silver Darling is generally worth the extra dough.
See map p. 331. Pocra Quay, North Pier. Follow the road from Aberdeen harbor along
the water until you reach the beach, and then turn right. % 01224-576-229.

Perth
MODERN SCOTTISH
This restaurant is run by a local Perthshire boy, chef Graeme Pallister,
who, like his town rival at Deans @ Let’s Eat (see above), is a Master Chef
of Great Britain. The contemporary dining space overlooks the River Tay,

Exploring Tayside and the Northeast
The territory covered in this chapter offers a host of scenic drives, his-
torical castles, and whisky distilleries — as well as forested glens and
mountains. Tayside, carved out of the old counties of Perth and Angus,
is named for its major river, the 192km-long (119-mile) Tay. The river’s
waters offer some of Europe’s best salmon and trout fishing, although
many say it’s not as good as it used to be. As you journey into Scotland’s
Northeast, you pass moorland and peaty lochs, wooded valleys and
rushing rivers, granite-stone villages and ancient edifices.
A “Scotland’s Treasures” ticket (about £18/$33 for one adult) offers
admission to Blair Castle, Scone Palace, Glamis Castle, and more. Tickets
are sold at Blair, Glamis, and Scone visitor centers.

The top attractions
Balmoral
Ballater
Welcome to one of the vacation homes for the royal family Windsor.
Because Balmoral Castle and Estate is a working residence for them, visi-
tor access is limited to the ballroom, garden, and grounds. On display are
pictures of rooms as well as clothing and gifts belonging to royalty. You’re
free to walk the extensive grounds and gardens. Because the castle is
closed to tourists when the Queen is in town, it’s a good idea to call in
advance of your visit. In addition to the general opening times, guided
tours are sometime offered one day a week in November and December.
Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 331. Balmoral, Ballater, off the A93 (13km/8 miles from Banchory). 
% 01339-742-334. www.balmoralcastle.com. Admission: £7 ($13) adults, £6
($11) seniors and students, £3 ($5.55) children younger than 16. Open: Apr–July daily
10 a.m.–5 p.m. Closed Aug–Apr.
Blair Castle
Blair Atholl
This fine, fairy-tale-white castle up the road from Pitlochry has much to
see. It’s chock-full o’ stuff: art, armor, flags, stag horns, and more items not
typically found on the standard furniture-and-portrait castle tour. Between
the 30 rooms and the grounds (including a walled garden), the castle has
something (such as pony rides) for just about everyone. The most
common theme in the Duke of Atholl’s decoration scheme is hunting. Deer
antlers decorate the long hallway and ballroom, and the weaponry col-
lection spans hundreds of years. Blair Castle’s long history includes a
couple of Jacobite sieges and a sleepover by Queen Victoria. But while the
castle is the ancient seat of the dukes and earls of Atholl, and although
Duncan Atholl was the king murdered in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, the real
Duncan didn’t live here. Allow about 2 hours.
See map p. 331. Blair Atholl, off the A9 (10km/6 miles west of Pitlochry). 
% 01796-481-207. www.blair-castle.co.uk. Admission: £8 ($15) adults, £7
($13) seniors, £5 ($9.25) children younger than 16, £21 ($39) family. Open: Apr–Oct
daily 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Nov–Mar Tues and Sat 9:30 a.m.–12:30 p.m.
Drum Castle and Gardens
Banchory
The family seat of the Irwins of Drum since the times of Robert the Bruce,
this is the oldest intact building in the care of the National Trust for
Scotland. Built at different times, it has a medieval tower, Jacobean man-
sion, and Victorian additions. Nothing in particular in the Irvine family col-
lection is remarkable, but you’re likely to enjoy the walk through the
house, which includes an impressive vaulted library in the oldest section
of the castle. Don’t miss the grounds and gardens, a highlight of which is
a collection of historic roses. Allow about 2 hours.

students, and children younger than 16; £20 ($37) family. Open: Easter–Sept daily noon
to 5 p.m. (closed Tues and Fri Apr–June and Sept and Oct to the day before Easter).
Edradour Distillery
Pitlochry
You get a good primer on the whisky-making process at this distillery, one
of Scotland’s smallest, which produces only 12 casks of whisky a week that
are matured for ten years before bottling. It’s a cute site, too, with little
white-washed buildings with red doors and friendly staff using the smallest
spirit stills that the law allows. Of course, it’s quality, not quantity, that
counts. The tours and a wee dram of whisky are free. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 331. Off the A924, just outside Pitlochry. %01796-472-095. www.edradour.

5 p.m.; Nov–Feb Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m., Sun noon to 4 p.m.
Glenfiddich Distillery
Near Dufftown
In contrast to Edradour, Glenfiddich is one of the largest distilleries in
Scotland, owned by William Grant & Sons, a family who has been making
the national spirit since 1887. The tour starts with a video explaining the
ins and outs of whisky making; then you see the mash-tuns and huge 5m-
tall (17-ft.) wash-backs made of Douglas fir, the expansive bonded ware-
houses, and finally the bottling factory. In addition to the standard tour,
the “Connoisseur’s Tour” is a 21⁄2-hour exploration of the distillery that con-
cludes with a tutored nosing and tasting session (£20/$37; must be 18 or
older). The shop sells a host of popular and extremely rare vintage single
malts. Allow an hour and a half (more for the longer tour).
See map p. 331. Off the A941 (88km/55miles northeast of Aberdeen). % 01340-
820-373. www.glenfiddich.com. Admission: Free tours. Open: Mon–Sat 9:30
a.m.–4:30 p.m.; Sun noon to 4:30 p.m. (closed Sat–Sun late Oct to mid-Dec).
If you are truly keen on whisky, you can follow Scotland’s Malt Whisky
Trail throughout this region, visiting several distilleries, just as you
might tour the chateaux of Bordeaux or wineries in the Napa Valley. For
more information on itineraries, log on to www.maltwhiskytrail.com.

Braemar Highland gathering
The average population of the village of Braemar is around 500 people. But when the vil-
lage holds the Braemar Highland Games, every September, the population jumps by
20,000 or more, and that usually includes Queen Elizabeth. This purely Scottish experi-
ence includes feats of strength and traditional dance.

Pitlochry Festival Theatre
Pitlochry
This arts center on the south side of the River Tummel is the jewel of
Pitlochry. People come here from throughout the region for a bit of cul-
ture. In addition to new and classic dramatic performances and exhibitions
at the center’s art gallery, the venue also offers a busy schedule of folk
concerts, literary talks, and even culinary events. It’s best to book tickets
in advance.
See map p. 331. Port-Na-Craig (across the river from Main Street). % 01796-484-626.
www.pitlochry.org.uk. Theater tickets: £15–£22 ($28–$41).
Scone Palace
Near Perth
Scone (pronounced scoon) was the first established capital of a unified
Scotland, the hallowed ground where most of the country’s early kings
were enthroned and latter ones, up to Charles II, were crowned. For years
it held the infamous Stone of Destiny, or Stone of Scone (see “The Stone of
Scone: A long strange trip”). The castellated palace you will find today,
however, dates only to the early 1800s, though parts of earlier buildings
have been incorporated. Home to the earls of Mansfield, it is full of fine
furniture, ivories, clocks, and needlework, and of particular note is the
renowned porcelain collection. There is also a hall dedicated to the coro-
nation of kings. The grounds are also quite nice. A replica Stone of Scone
marks the location of its historical spot on Moot Hill, by a little chapel.
Allow two hours.
See map p. 331. Braemar Road, on the A93. % 01738-552-300. www.scone-
palace.net. Admission: Palace and grounds £8 ($15) adults, £7 ($13) seniors and
students, £5 ($9.25) children younger than 16, £24 ($45) family. Open: Mid-Mar to Oct
daily 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m. (Sat until 4:30 p.m.). Closed Nov to mid-Mar.

The Stone of Scone: A long strange trip
Until the late 13th century, Scone Palace was the home of the Stone of Destiny, aka the
Stone of Scone, on which important early rulers such as David I, Macbeth, and Robert
the Bruce were enthroned. According to myth, the hunk of sandstone dates to Biblical
times, serving as Jacob’s pillow. It reputedly traveled through Egypt, Spain, and Italy
before coming to Scotland with Celtic pilgrims in the 9th century. It was then deployed
for the enthronement of Dalriadic kings in Argyll before being used by Scottish royalty
at Scone. So powerful was the lure of the stone that in 1296 English King Edward I stole
and then lodged it in Westminster Abbey, where English kings and queens hoped to get
some of its magic during coronations. On Christmas Day, 1950, the stone was purloined
by Scottish nationalists, who put it in Arbroath Abbey, where the 1320 Scottish decla-
ration of sovereignty was signed. However, it was soon returned to London. In 1996, it
was finally returned officially to Scotland with plenty of manufactured fanfare and is
now on display in Edinburgh Castle. Presumably, this is where it stays.

Other cool things to see and do
 Auchingarrich Wildlife Centre, on the B827 near Comrie (% 01764-
679-469; www.auchingarrich.co.uk), offers a host of wild and
domesticated animals (from lambs to emus), a wild-bird hatchery,
and hiking trails. Younger children can burn off some steam at the
facilities’ “adventure” playground.
 Discovery Point, Discovery Quay, Dundee (% 01382-309-060;
www.rrsdiscovery.com), is home to the famous RRS Discovery,
the ship sailed by Captain Robert Scott to Antarctica. You can tour
the vessel and get all the details of Scott’s historic trip. By the way,
RRS stands for “royal research ship.”
 Dunnottar Castle, near Stonehaven (% 01569-762-173; www.
dunnottarcastle.co.uk), is best known for its breathtaking
views. Much of the red sandstone ruins, pitched above the cliffs
and the North Sea, stand tall. Often the object of sieges, in the 
17th century it was used as a prison for nearly 200 recalcitrant
Presbyterian Covenanters, and visitors can see the cellar where
they were held.
 Glamis Castle, near Forfar (% 01307-840-393; www.glamis-castle.
co.uk), is notable for being the family home of the late Queen
Mother, born Elizabeth Bowes Lyon, wife of King George VI and
mother of Queen Elizabeth. A royal residence since 1372, it’s also
famous for being the (historically inaccurate) setting for
Shakespeare’s Macbeth.
If you want to visit more castles than I have given details for, then
follow the official Castle Trail linking about a dozen historic piles in
the Northeast. Log on to the Aberdeen and Grampian tourist board
Web site (www.aberdeen-grampian.com) for more information.
 J.M. Barrie’s Birthplace, Brechin Road, Kirriemuir (% 01575-
572-646; www.nts.org.uk), is devoted to the creator of Peter Pan,
who was born here in 1860. Watch for the little fast-moving light
that represents everyone’s favorite fairy, Tinkerbell. The displays
contain manuscripts and artifacts from the writer’s life.
 Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Kinnaird Head, Fraserburgh 
(% 01346-511-022; www.lighthousemuseum.org.uk), is a must-
see for lighthouse buffs and is recommended if you have any inter-
est in the towers of all shapes and sizes that have kept sailors safe
at sea for more than 200 years.
Shopping for Local Treasures
With its cluster of tartan and woolens shops, such as Macnaughtons,
Pitlochry offers the classic Highland gateway shopping experience,
where you may just find the perfect wooly jumper to keep you warm.
Both Dundee and Aberdeen offer a full range of shops these days, with
many of the stores you would expect to find in provincial cities. As ever,
Chapter 17: Tayside and the Northeast 339

tourist attractions invariably have visitor centers with gifts and sou-
venirs. Also consider visiting the shops below.
 Baxter’s Highland Village, Fochabers (% 01343-820-666; www.
baxters.com), is headquarters and retail outlet for Baxter’s food
products, which are primarily jams and soups. Besides the food
shop, you can also stop in the store Coat & Swagger for clothing
and gifts. Call to confirm seasonal opening hours.
 Le Chocolatier, 29 Scott St., Perth (% 01738-620-039), is a heav-
enly shop that offers lots of tasty handmade sweets, from butter
fudges to chocolates for diabetics. Open Monday through Saturday
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 McEwan Gallery, on A939, near Ballater (% 01339-755429; www.
mcewangallery.com), is a trove of 19th- and 20th-century Scottish
artworks. They are nice high-end souvenirs. Call to confirm sea-
sonal hours.
Doing the Pub Crawl
While you might happily settle for your hotel’s bar — especially if you’re
at the Craigellachie or Darroch Learg (p. 332 and 332) — or for one of
the many rural taverns dotted about the region, for a serious crawl
Aberdeen has a range of classic pubs, stylish bars, and nightlife options.
Here are a couple of the better traditional options.
 Old Blackfriars, 52 Castle St. (% 01224-581-922), features cask-
conditioned real Scottish ales and a host of honest pub grub served
all day until about 7:30 p.m. Open Monday through Saturday from
11 a.m. to midnight and Sunday 12:30 to 11 p.m.
 The Prince of Wales, 7 St. Nicholas Lane (% 01224-640-597), 
dates back to 1850, and is possibly the best place to grab a pint in
Aberdeen. The Prince of Wales is an old-fashioned pub with cozy
booths and an excellent spectrum of ales. The only problem is 
that it can get crowded, but that’s the price of popularity. Open
Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to midnight, and Sunday noon 
to midnight.

The Highlands
In This Chapter
 Finding a bed for the night, both on and off the beaten path
 Hunting (briefly) for the Loch Ness Monster
 Exploring the highest mountains and deepest lochs in the country
 Seeing the best of the rugged West Coast and its pristine beaches
A
fter Edinburgh and Glasgow, the Highlands region is the most popu-
lar draw for visitors to Scotland — and for good reason. The tourist
trail through the Highlands can include breathtaking Glen Coe and the
beautifully desolate Rannoch Moor; the scenic “Road to the Isles” west
of Fort William into Lochaber, where mountains meet the sea; isolated
western peninsulas such as Morvern, Ardnamurchan, or Knoydart; the
Great Glen and, of course, the most famous body of water in Scotland,
Loch Ness. But, honestly, that’s only the beginning.
It’s easy to be overwhelmed when you’re trying to visit an area this
remote, divided by lochs and mountain ranges, connected only by the
sea, winding highways, and one-lane roads. Use a map to plot your
course and mark off the things you want to see. Then figure out the best
order in which to see them, whether coming or going.
The capital of the Highlands is Inverness and it is the region’s only bona
fide city. The River Ness runs through the town center, which has plenty
of shops, a few excellent restaurants, transportation links to the south,
and accommodations (as well as a nice castle and museum, but few
other attractions). I suggest that Inverness is best as a one-day stop or a
comfortable base from which to explore parts of the Highlands.
Southwest of Inverness, Fort William lies at the foot of Ben Nevis (the
highest mountain in Great Britain), near the head of Loch Linnhe. This
location, on the roads leading north through the Great Glen to Loch
Ness and going west toward Glenfinnan, means that tourists regularly
pass through Fort William, which has shops and restaurants to accom-
modate visitors.
I don’t really consider either Inverness or Fort William as highlights.
West Coast villages and towns worth trying to see include Arisaig,

Mallaig, Plockton, and Ullapool. In the east sit Tain and Dornoch, while
Durness is in the far north. Durness features a small memorial in
memory of the late Beatle John Lennon, who often went there on 
vacations. If you’re looking for truly wild and sparsely populated 
territory, I would suggest traveling north of the fishing port Ullapool,
into the Assynt and Sutherland regions of the northwest Highlands.
Getting There
Inverness is well served by buses and trains. If you’re making the big
leap north from Glasgow or Edinburgh, you may want to consider taking
public transportation to reach the capital of the Highlands. Then, after
you arrive, you can rent a car. You can also take the train from Glasgow
to Fort William and transfer there for another train up to Mallaig — 
possibly the most scenic train ride in the entire U.K. Local bus services
crisscross the Highlands, but, for optimal mobility, a car is quite useful.
 By car: The A82 runs through a good portion of the Highlands from
Loch Lomond and Crianlarich north to Fort William and then into
Inverness. From the east, the A9 from Perth heads north to
Inverness and then on to Tain as well. Other key roads in the region
include the A830 (the so-called Road to the Isles) from Fort William
to Mallaig; the A87 from Invergarry to the Kyle of Lochalsh; the
A835 from Inverness to Ullapool; and the A836 from Tain to Tongue
and the far north coast.
 By bus: Scottish Citylink (% 0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk)
routes hit all the major Highlands towns. Contact Traveline Scotland
% 0871-200-2233; www.travelinescotland.com) for schedules
and more information.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscotrail.
com) travels to major towns in the region, including Fort William and
Mallaig, on the West Highland Lines, as well as Inverness, Tain, Kyle of
Lochalsh, and even Thurso. You have to rely on buses or local taxis
after you arrive by train, however. ScotRail service to Inverness 
dovetails with long-distance trains from England. Contact Traveline
Scotland % 0871-200-2233; www.travelinescotland.com) for
schedules and more information.
 By plane: Inverness/Dalcross Airport (% 01463-23-2471; www.
hial.co.uk) is at Dalcross, 13km (8 miles) east of Inverness. The
airport handles flights to and from Glasgow and Edinburgh.
 By ferry: Caledonian MacBrayne (% 01475-650-100; www.calmac.
co.uk) — or CalMac, as it’s more colloquially known — serves 22
islands and four peninsulas over the West Coast of Scotland. In the
Highlands, this includes service from Mallaig to Skye and Ullapool to
the Outer Hebrides.
Chapter 18: The Highlands 343

Spending the Night
You may want to stay in tourist-friendly Inverness or Fort William, but
the rest of the Highlands towns and villages have some real treats, too.
Some accommodations have earned star ratings from the tourist board;
see Chapter 8 for a description of the rating system and information on
self-catering accommodations, of which there are quite a few in the
Highlands. Rates listed here include full breakfast, unless otherwise
stated. You may well get a better deal than the advertised “rack” rates.
Some of the hotels and guesthouses listed here may shut for part of the
winter (a good time to make repairs). Reserve ahead to ensure you have
a room waiting for you.
In addition to the options listed below, be sure to read through the
“Dining Locally” section that follows. I highlight a few of the restaurants
listed there that also have limited overnight accommodations.
The Anderson
$$
The Black Isle
Formerly known as the Royal Hotel, and located in the handsome seaside
village of Fortrose, the Anderson prides itself as a gastronomic oasis in the
Highlands. Scottish ingredients get the international treatment, whether
it’s a bowl Shetland mussels steamed in a red curry and coconut broth or
a plate of wild Scotch venison goulash. The pub is no slouch either, boast-
ing 160 single malt whiskies, real ales from Scotland and England, and
some 60 Belgian beers. The nine overnight rooms combine antiques with
modern conveniences in this historic building, while the welcome from
owners Jim and Anne Anderson is always warm and accommodating.
See map p. 345. Union Street, Fortrose. % 01381-620-236. www.theanderson.
co.uk. Rack rates: £80 ($148) double. MC, V.
Arisaig Hotel
$$–$$$
Arisaig
In addition to views of the lovely bay at Arisaig, its small harbor, and the
isles beyond, this hotel has two dedicated family rooms. The units are tidy
and well appointed, if not exceptionally large. The best ones face onto the
sea. A restaurant and popular local pub (renovated in early 2007), as well
as a playroom for children, are on the premises.

exterior is unassuming, the bedrooms — all done in handsome, sumptuous
earthy hues — are quite plush with leather easy chairs, plump pillows,
quality linens, and MP3 docking stations. The owners are sprucing up the
en-suite bathrooms, as well the guest lounge (which were both fine before
but should be even better now). This is a great spot for couples.

Ballachulish House
$$$–$$$$
Ballachulish
This five-star small hotel between Glen Coe and Fort William is renowned
for its meals, which earned recognition from the persnickety Michelin
guide. That accolade slipped away in 2007, but dinner remains a treat, with
meals that use local produce such as smoked duck or lobster in season.
The eight bedrooms are generally roomy and well appointed, while the
hotel’s public spaces include a drawing room, library, and walled garden.
There is a 9-hole golf course adjacent to the hotel.
See map p. 345. Off A82, on A825. % 01855-811-266. Fax: 01855-811-498. Rack rates:

Ballifeary House Hotel
$$
Inverness
In the same neighborhood as the Avalon (see above), this four-star B&B is
in a quiet residential area along the River Ness and within easy walking
distance of the Inverness city center. The Edwardian villa has lovely sit-
ting rooms and six well-kept overnight units that exude comfort with en-
suite bathrooms. Families take note, however: The minimum age for guests
is 15.

The Ceilidh Place
$$–$$$
Ullapool
How many hotels organize their rooms on the basis of the mini-library that
each unit contains? Fair to say, not many. But here at the Ceilidh Place,
which has its own acclaimed bookshop on the premises, each overnight
room features a set of books selected by a Scottish writer or luminary. This
charming, if rather idiosyncratic, hotel often hosts live traditional and folk
music performances, as well as other cultural events.

Corriechoille Lodge
$$
Near Spean Bridge
The sitting room of this stone guesthouse offers views of the nearby Nevis
Range Mountains. An 18th-century stone fishing lodge, about 19km 
(12 miles) northeast of Fort William, was converted into this luxurious
hideaway with all the trimmings. No children younger than 7 are permit-
ted, and the lodge is closed Monday and Tuesday nights. In addition to the
guesthouse, there are two one-bedroom log cabins on the property.
See map p. 345. Just off the A82 (3km/2 miles east of Spean Bridge).

Dunain Park Hotel
$$$–$$$$
Dunain near Inverness
In a tourist-strategic position between Loch Ness and Inverness, the Dunain
is a wonderful, old Georgian country-house hotel (recently refurbished)
that’s surrounded by gardens, with woods beyond. Some of the well-
dressed bedrooms and suites in the main house have four-poster beds,
while more chic accommodations are found in separate quaint cottages.
See map p. 345. Fort William Road, on the A82 (3km/2 miles south of Inverness).

Glengarry Castle Hotel
$$–$$$
Invergarry
You’d be hard pressed to find a prettier spot for such highly regarded
country-inn lodgings. This 26-room Victorian mansion is on extensive
wooded grounds with its own castle ruins (the real Glengarry Castle) and
nice views of Loch Oich. Some of the warmly decorated rooms have four-
poster beds and exposed ceiling beams; there are two family-size units.
The four-star hotel also has rowboats for guest use, while afternoon high
tea is served for those in the mood for less robust activities.
See map p. 345. Off the A82 (1.5km/1 mile south of the intersection with the A87 in
Invergarry). % 01809-501-254. Fax: 01809-501-207. www.glengarry.net. Rack
rates: £90 ($167) standard double. MC, V. Closed mid-Nov to mid-Mar.
Glen Mhor Hotel
$$–$$$
Inverness
This 50-bedroom Victorian hotel (recently remodeled) overlooks the east
banks of the River Ness, not far from the bluff with Inverness Castle. The lob-
bies and dining spaces, including Nico’s (p. 351), are quite lovely with over-
stuffed chairs and oak paneling. The bedrooms tend to be large and prices
vary widely depending on the season and whether or not you get a river view.
See map p. 353. 9–12 Ness Bank. % 01463-234-308. Fax: 01463-713-170. www.glen-

Chapter 18: The Highlands 347

Inverlochy Castle
$$$$
Fort William
Offering Fort William’s most highly rated accommodations, Inverlochy
Castle hotel is beautifully situated in the foothills of Ben Nevis. Staying
here can be literally an experience fit for royalty: Queen Victoria visited
for a week in 1873 and wrote in her diary, “I never saw a lovelier or more
romantic spot.” That sentiment still rings true today. The sitting rooms
and dining area are flawlessly decorated and illuminated by chandeliers.
The attention to fine detail and maximum comfort extends to the guest
rooms as well, which have great views. The food is gourmet (and Michelin-
starred), and after you’ve had your fill of rich food and posh interiors, you
can tour the 200-hectare (500-acre) grounds.
See map p. 345. Torlundy (5km/3 miles north of Fort William on the A82).

Lodge on the Loch
$$$–$$$$
Onich
The Lodge on the Loch hotel offers some of the finest vistas in the
Highlands: The serene family-run retreat overlooks Loch Linnhe, 8km (5
miles) or so west of Glencoe. The house was built in 1870 as a country
home and today the modern rooms — which may need a bit of upkeep —
are individually decorated with their own monikers, such as Lady
McPherson’s Suite or Nova Scotia. No children younger than 16.

The Moorings Hotel
$$–$$$
Near Fort William
On a quiet residential stretch outside Fort William’s town center, this
labyrinthine hotel is bigger than it looks. The large, comfortable rooms
stretch back to the Caledonian Canal; some units have views of the locks
(aka Neptune’s Staircase) and the boats going through. The more costly
superior rooms have better views, living areas, and king-size beds.
See map p. 345. Banavie, just off the A830 toward Mallaig, next to Caledonian Canal.

Moyness House
$$
Inverness
Moyness House may be the finest guesthouse in Inverness. This quaint,
white-washed Victorian villa was once home to 20th-century author Neil
Gunn and the names of the six homey bedrooms are inspired by him, such
Part IV: The Major Regions 
348

as Silver Darlings or Lost Glen. Each unit is individually decorated and
comfortably furnished, with modern en-suite bathrooms. Discounts
offered on stays over three nights.

The Newton Hotel
$$$
Nairn
Just before you enter the coastal town of Nairn from the west, you should
spot this castlelike hotel and conference center. It could be just the thing
you need after a busy day of sightseeing. In addition to the usual room
facilities, nice touches include heated bathroom floors.

Plockton Hotel
$$
Plockton
The village of Plockton (see “The top attractions,” below) is one of the
prettiest you find in the Highlands and this is the only hotel on the water-
front, looking onto a sheltered bay in Loch Carron. The 11 overnight
accommodations include two that work as family rooms, and there’s a
four-bedroom cottage annex nearby. All the units have en-suite bathrooms,
and a half-dozen offer sea views. The hotel’s dining room and award-gar-
nering pub are well known for fresh fish and seafood dishes.

Polmaily House Hotel
$$–$$$
Near Drumnadrochit
Polmaily knows how to provide family-friendly accommodations during
the high season. The 14-room hotel features a heated indoor pool, video
games, tennis courts, mountain bikes, and fishing. In the summer, parents
will appreciate the supervised fun room, organized children’s activities,
outdoor play areas, and large suites.

Scourie Hotel
$$
Scourie
This one-time coaching inn way up north in Sutherland is one those hotels
that believes guests have better things to do than sit in their rooms and
watch television. (There are no TVs here, although they provide you with
Chapter 18: The Highlands 349

a radio if asked.) Rooms are quite homey and spacious. Some of them over-
look Scourie Bay, while others have vistas toward the inland mountains,
such as Ben Stack. It’s a top spot for fishing enthusiasts, too, with hotel
boats available.
See map p. 345. Scourie is about 69km (43 miles) north of Ullapool on the A894. 
% 01971-502-396. Fax: 01971-502-423. www.scourie-hotel.co.uk. Rack rates:
£70–£90 ($130–$167) double. MC, V.
Dining Locally
Your hotel (though not your B&B) is likely to have a restaurant, and
most of those listed above also will serve meals to nonresidents who
reserve a table in advance. But there are more options in the Highlands,
and I list some of the better ones below.
Applecross Inn
$$
Applecross
FISH/SEAFOOD
This may not be the easiest place to reach, but many visitors feel the twists
and turns of the road to Applecross are well worth the meal at the inn
(which also has overnight rooms from £50/$93 per person). This one-time
fisherman’s cottage sits right on the shores of the Inner Sound of Raasay,
looking out toward the mountains on the Isle of Skye. Naturally, seafood
dishes make up the majority of the menu, but you can expect local veni-
son or sausages, too. The Applecross, with an excellent selection of real
ale, is also rated one of Scotland’s best country pubs.
See map p. 345. From the village of Lochcarron, take the A896 west, turning left on
the country road to Applecross. % 01520-744-262. Fax: 01520-744-440. www.apple

Café 1
$$–$$$
Inverness
INTERNATIONAL
The small, well-chosen menu may include items such as Angus rump steak,
sticky pork belly, or halibut filet. It always has something for vegetarians,
as well. The décor behind the stone exterior is simple and modern, and
you find the service polite and professional.
See map p. 353. 75 Castle St. % 01463-226-200. www.cafe1.net. Reservations rec-
ommended. Main courses: £8–£15 ($15–$28). MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon to 2 p.m.
and 5:30–9:30 p.m.
Crannog
$$$
Fort William
FISH/SEAFOOD
Offering fine views, this restaurant sits on stilts out over the waters of Loch
Linnhe — a location that led to severe storm damage a few years back.
After repairs, the restaurant returned to its town pier location. The owners
Part IV: The Major Regions 
350

deploy their own fleet of boats (and run a smokehouse, too), so expect the
freshest of fish. A plate of langoustines with hot garlic butter is highly
touted. By the way, crannog is the Gaelic word for an artificial island on
the banks of a loch — how appropriate.
See map p. 345. The Pier. % 01397-705-589. www.oceanandoak.co.uk.
Reservations recommended for dinner. Main courses: £12–£16 ($22–$30). MC, V.
Open: Daily noon to 2:30 p.m. and 6–9:30 p.m.
The Fishmarket Restaurant
$$
Mallaig
FISH/SEAFOOD
Situated right on the harbor and serving dishes that incorporate freshly
caught fish, this restaurant is a casual place for a meal. Main courses might
include poached haddock with mussels, roasted whole sea bass with
fennel and ginger, or traditional fish and chips. Prawns (shrimp) come in
by the ton here at Mallaig and are thus one of the restaurant’s specialties.
See map p. 345. Station Road. % 01687-462-299. Fax: 01687-460-040. Reservations
recommended. Main courses: £10–£15 ($19–$28). MC, V. Open: Daily noon to 3 p.m.
and 6–9 p.m.
The Kitchen
$$
Inverness
MODERN SCOTTISH
One of the more exciting additions to the city of Inverness, the Kitchen
occupies a purpose-built, multifloor glass-fronted edifice on the left bank
of the River Ness. The setting is impressive while the cooking is modern
and fresh. Similar cuisine, in slightly less stirring surroundings, is offered
by a sister restaurant across the river, the Mustard Seed (16 Fraser St., 
% 01463-220-220).
See map p. 353. 15 Huntly St. % 01463-259-119. www.kitchenrestaurant.

Nico’s Bistro
$$–$$$
Inverness
SCOTTISH
This upscale diner in the Glen Mhor hotel offers a relaxed place to dine.
You can’t really go wrong with a catch of the day, such as sea scallops or
langoustines. The lounge is perfect for a pre-dinner beer or an after-dinner
cocktail, and outdoor seating is available.
See map p. 353. 9–12 Ness Bank. % 01463-234-308. Main courses: £14–£23 ($26–$43).

Old Library Lodge
$$$
Arisaig
MODERN SCOTTISH
Located in a 200-year-old stone building (formerly a library, hence the
name) down the street from the Arisaig Hotel (p. 344), this restaurant
Chapter 18: The Highlands 351

(which also has six overnight rooms) garners three stars from the Scottish
tourist board. The evening menu might include pan-fried scallops with lime
and dill, double loin lamb chops, or monkfish with tarragon and Pernod.
See map p. 345. % 01687-450-651. Fax: 01687-450-219. www.oldlibrary.co.uk.

Riva

Inverness
ITALIAN
This bistro can be a lively spot for a meal, with fine wine, inventive Italian
cuisine, and a location on the River Ness. The subtly flavored dishes can
include braised loin of pork with cannellini beans or mixed seafood and
shellfish tossed with linguini.
See map p. 353. 4–6 Ness Walk, by the Ness Bridge. % 01463-237-377. www.

The River Café and Restaurant
$$
Inverness
SCOTTISH
This small, simple venture by the water is a favorite among locals because
of its good eats at even better prices. During the day, it acts very much
like a cafe with croissant sandwiches or stuffed baked potatoes. In the
evening, the candles come out and the cuisine is more formal with spe-
cialties such as filet of Scottish salmon or duck breast.
See map p. 353. 10 Bank St. % 01463-714-884. www.rivercafeandrestaurant.

Rocpool
$$$
Inverness
MODERN SCOTTISH
Rocpool probably remains the most ambitious modern restaurant in the
city of Inverness. The menu may range from crispy polenta cake topped
with fresh crab to pistachio-crusted goat-cheese soufflé. A pre-theater
menu offers good value. In addition to this centrally located restaurant,
Rocpool Reserve, a small distance across town, is a boutique hotel.
See map p. 353. 1 Ness Walk. % 01463-717-274. www.rocpoolrestaurant.com.
Main courses: £12–£20 ($22–$37). MC, V. Open: Mon–Sat noon to 10:30 p.m. (also Sun
6–10 p.m. in summer).
Exploring the Highlands
You can find plenty of tourist attractions between Inverness and Fort
William, but please don’t confine yourself to the well-known Loch Ness
hot spots. In addition to those heavily touristed sites, you have a wide
choice of things to see throughout the Highlands: ancient monuments,

lovely lochs, picturesque villages, natural areas for hiking, sandy and
unspoiled beaches, and a good number of excellent castles.
Guided tours
The Highlands lends itself to smartly operated theme tours, whether
relating to the area’s rich historic heritage or unique natural history.
Refer to my suggestions in “Seeing Scotland by Bus,” in Chapter 7, for a
list of reputable guided tours setting off from Edinburgh or Glasgow.
Here are a couple of the more interesting specialized tours to take, too.

 Ecoventure (% 01381-600-323; www.ecoventures.co.uk): This
company takes you to see a resident colony of bottlenose dolphins
living in the Moray Firth. As many as 130 live in one area, and
they’re generally friendly and unafraid to approach the boat. The
tour also covers other sea life such as seals, porpoises, and even
the occasional minke whale. Tours depart from Cromarty Harbor at
the tip of the Black Isle, off the A832 at the junction of Bank Street
and High Street in Cromarty. Reservations are highly recom-
mended. Tickets cost £22 ($41) per person, £16 ($30) for children 5
to 12 years old. The tour lasts about two hours.
 Jacobite Cruises (% 01463-233-999; www.jacobite.co.uk):
Jacobite Cruises, which take visitors out on Loch Ness, are perhaps
the most efficient and best organized tours of the loch. You can
choose from a number of different excursions, such as the
“Passion” cruise and tour, a six-plus hour trip by boat and bus
down the loch, through the Caledonian Canal, stopping at Urquhart
(irk-ett) Castle and the Corrimony Cairns. Alternatively, the
“Inspiration” cruise takes only one hour on the loch. The company
runs minibuses to the launch site from the Inverness Tourist
Information Centre on Bridge Street. Or you can drive to the
Clansman Harbour, 13km (8 miles) southwest of the city outskirts,
off the A82. Tours operate year round, and fares start at £10 ($19).
The top attractions
Ardnamurchan Peninsula
One of the more seemingly remote areas of the Highlands, the Ardnamurchan
Peninsula is the most westerly point in the entire British mainland. One high-
light is the ruins of Castle Tioram (see the listing later in this section), but
the peninsula also has pretty beaches (such as the one at Sanna Bay), tide
pools, natural history, a nature visitor center near Glenbeg, and lots of hiking
trails. The lighthouse at the craggy Point of Ardnamurchan can feel like the
end of the earth on a windy day. From Kilchoan on the peninsula, you can
take a ferry to and from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull in the summer. Allow
one day.
See map p. 345. West of Fort William. Take the A861 from the Road to the Isles (A830)
at Lochailort, or use the small ferry service to Corran a few kilometers north of
Ballachulish (A82). www.ardnamurchan.com. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round.
Balnakeil Craft Village
Near Durness
This artist community, on the outskirts of Durness near Cape Wrath, has
plenty of galleries selling local artwork. The craft village is housed in a
former military communications installation with lots of flat-roofed insti-
tutional-looking buildings. Still the place is friendly, communal, and, yes,
vaguely hippy-esque. The cafe serves tasty natural foods, and the book-
shop is well stocked with local titles. If you’ve come this far, you may as

354

well carry on to the end of the road to see the old ruins of a 17th-century
church and the lovely Balnakeil beach. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 345. Off the A838 (1km/ 1⁄2 mile west of Durness; 108km/67 miles north of
Ullapool). www.durness.org. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round.
Ben Nevis
Near Fort William
At 1,344m (4,410 ft.), Ben Nevis is the tallest mountain in the United
Kingdom, although it’s difficult to see just how tall it is from the usual van-
tage points around Fort William. The round-trip hike to the summit is
about 16km (10 miles) and can take around seven hours (4 up and 3 down).
You will need to wear good boots and have both warm- and cold-weather
gear, because the temperature and weather can fluctuate unpredictably at
certain heights. Don’t attempt to transverse the summit without a proper
map and compass, and also don’t start your ascent of Ben Nevis too late
in the day. The tourist office in Fort William has trail maps if you’re plan-
ning to make the big climb. Allow about seven hours.
See map p. 345. Path leaves from Glen Nevis Road, just outside Fort William. 
% 01397-703-781. www.visit-fortwilliam.co.uk. Admission: Free. Open:
Year-round.
Castle Tioram
Near Blain on Loch Moidart
The impressive ruins of this classic medieval fortress (pronounced,
roughly, cheer-rum) sit on a rocky spit of land extending into the pictur-
esque waters of Loch Moidart. A key outpost for clan MacDonald for hun-
dreds of years, Castle Tioram is one of my favorite ruined castles: a
romantic site that is best accessed at low tide. Like so many castles in
Scotland, Tioram was sacked and burned during Jacobite uprisings — in
this instance apparently by its own owners in order to keep it from falling
into the hands of forces loyal to the Hanovers in London. There are good
hiking trails near the castle, too. Allow one to two hours.
See map p. 345. Off the A861 from Blain. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round.
Cawdor Castle
Near Nairn
Cawdor, with its dramatic drawbridge and medieval tower, is full of treas-
ures, and particularly tapestries, from around the world. The gardens are
pretty wonderful, too, with wildflowers, fountains, and a maze of holly
bushes. Legend has it that the Thane of Cawdor (then spelled Calder)
determined the location of the castle by giving instructions to build wher-
ever his donkey decided to rest (as he had dreamed). The animal stopped
in the shade of a mature holly, and deep within the castle, its stump
(carbon dated to about 1370) still stands today. Although Macbeth was
Shakespeare’s Thane of Cawdor, neither he nor his good lady could have
resided here: The castle wasn’t built yet. Allow about two hours.

Clava Cairns
Culloden
If you’re visiting the nearby Culloden Moor Battlefield (see the next list-
ing), Clava Cairns — also known as the Balnuaran of Clava — is worth a
brief visit. Basically a 4,000-year-old graveyard, the cairns are part of best-
preserved Bronze Age cemetery in Scotland. The large circular pits of rock
and rubble, two of which are aligned on the winter solstice, are slightly
eerie. Nearby are standing stones in a grove of trees and ruins of an ancient
chapel. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 345. Off the B9091, just east of Culloden Battlefield. www.historic-
scotland.gov.uk. % 01667-460-232. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round.
Culloden
Culloden Moor
This marshy field is where the hopes of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s Jacobite
uprising of 1745 (begun at Glenfinnan; see “Glenfinnan Monument,” later in
this section) ended in complete defeat on April 16, 1746. The bloody battle
(the last significant one fought on the British mainland) was over in about
an hour, and Charlie was among the few Jacobites who escaped unharmed.
After their defeat, Highland life was censored and restricted by a London
administration tired of rebellion. An impressive new visitor center pro-
vides all the background and key details about the events. Take the time
to walk through the battlefield, which has clan stones and cairns in
memory of those who lost their lives. The terrain is kept the same as 260
years ago, when boggy conditions contributed to the Jacobites’ defeat.
Allow about 21⁄2 hours.

Eilean Donan Castle
Dornie
Grab your camera: Eilean Donan Castle could be the most photographed
stone pile in the Highlands. On an islet in Loch Duich, this quintessential
castle (which lay in utter ruins for two centuries) is accessible by an
arched bridge. Originally built in the early 1200s by Alexander II to deter
Viking invaders, the castle was demolished at the hands of Hanoverian
Part IV: The Major Regions 
356

troops during the Jacobite uprising of 1719. In the early decades of the
20th century, it was essentially rebuilt. Highlights include the ramparts,
the banqueting hall, and the billeting room, as well as Jacobite relics. B-
movie fans will be excited by the fact that Highlander was filmed here.
Allow about two hours.
See map p. 345. Dornie, Kyle of Lochalsh, on the A87. % 01599-555-202. www.eilean

children; £11 ($20) family. Open: Apr to mid-Nov daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m. (from 9 a.m.
July–Aug). Closed Dec–Mar.
Glen Coe
Glencoe
It’s hard to believe that such an unspeakably beautiful valley was the site
of such a dreadfully bloody event. Glen Coe is where a historic massacre
took place on February 6, 1692. On that fateful day, the Campbell Earl of
Argyle’s regiment — on orders approved by the king, William of Orange —
slaughtered about 40 members of clan MacDonald, including some women
and children. What makes their killings truly distressing is the fact that
Campbell’s troops had been staying as guests, albeit not especially wel-
comed ones. Thus, Glen Coe is right up there with Culloden when it comes
to tragic bloodshed at the hands of troops loyal to the central government
in England. Regardless of the area’s grim history, this spectacular valley
extends about 16km (10 miles) from the king’s house in the east to the
shores of Loch Leven and the village of Glencoe in the west. The National
Trust for Scotland’s eco-friendly visitor center has area trail maps and
audiovisual presentations of local geography. Ranger-led walks take place
throughout the summer. Allow about three hours.

Chapter 18: The Highlands 357
Plockton: The prettiest Highland village?
Not far from Eilean Donan, Plockton (www.plockton.com) is arguably the prettiest
village in the Highlands. The crescent-shaped, harborside main street, on the shores of
Loch Carron, is lined with cute cottages, while the sidewalks are punctuated with palm
trees that defy the northern latitudes. Plockton gained fame in the U.K. as the location
for a BBC TV series, Hamish Macbeth, starring a then little-known Robert Carlyle as a
laid-back, pot-smoking policeman. Today, Plockton features some good pub grub at the
Plockton Inn on Innes Street and the Plockton Hotel (see “Spending the Night,” above).
Plockton is about 10km (6 miles) northeast of Kyle of Lochalsh, off the A87.

Glenfinnan Monument
Glenfinnan
This monument marks the hopeful start of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion led
by Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was trying to reclaim the English and
Scottish crowns for his Stuart family lineage. Be sure to take your camera;
this monument (and now slightly sacred historical ground) amid Highland
scenery is a great spot for pictures, especially if you’re lucky enough to
see the steam train (see below) cross the arched viaduct behind the visi-
tor center. (Fans of the Harry Potter films will recognize the setting.) The
Jacobites allegedly left from this spot to successfully push all the way to
Derby in England before turning back and being crushed at Culloden (see
listing earlier in this section). The Jacobite cause has captured the Scots’
collective imagination, and the small National Trust of Scotland visitor
center provides a good primer on the Jacobites and Prince Charlie. The
monument can be vaguely magical — on one of my visits a lone piper
broke the silence of twilight with mournful playing from a heather-filled
hillside. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 345. On A830, next to Loch Shiel (29km/18 miles west of Fort William).

Inverewe Garden
Near Poolewe
The most impressive garden in the Highlands is on the south-facing shores
of Loch Ewe, about 10km (6 miles) northeast of the village of Gairloch.
Because the North Atlantic drift carries warmer waters up from the
Caribbean, the climate here is surprisingly temperate. The plants are a tes-
tament to the ideal growing conditions. In late summer, you can see cab-
bages the size of basketballs in the large vegetable patch within the walled
garden. The sprawling 20-hectare (50-acre) garden, however, encompasses
much more than just vegetables, and includes rhododendron and pine
walks, a “bambooselem,” two ponds, and a rock garden. Diverse planting
means something is in bloom all year round, from azaleas in spring to
Kaffir lilies in the autumn. Allow two hours.

The Jacobite Steam Train
Fort William and Mallaig railway stations
The 68km (42-mile) train ride between Fort William and the port town of
Mallaig is one of the most picturesque rail journeys in Europe. As you chug
along past mountains, skirting lochs and glens, you pass the Glenfinnan
Monument and kilometers and kilometers of dramatic, unspoiled scenery.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
358

It’s hard to believe that the rail line wasn’t built for the delight of visitors;
rather, it was created to bring catches of fish inland. At the Glenfinnan sta-
tion, a small train museum is worth a look, and you can take a break in the
cafe located in an old train car. If you take the round-trip, the schedule
allows you to have 21⁄2 hours in Mallaig. Not every train on this route is the
historic steam train, so confirm schedules if you want to ride the real thing.
Allow about 51⁄2 hours round-trip.
See map p. 345. Fort William and Mallaig railway stations. % 01524-737-751.
www.westcoastrailway.co.uk. Tickets: about £30 ($56) standard adult round-
trip or £25 ($46) one-way. Open: Late May to mid-Oct one round-trip Mon–Fri depart-
ing from Fort William at 10:20 a.m., returning from Mallaig at 2:10 p.m.; mid-summer
also departs Sat–Sun. No steam trains mid-Oct to late May.
Loch Garten/Abernethy Forest
Boat of Garten
Some 10km (6 miles) northeast of Aviemore in the Cairngorm Mountains,
this aviary reserve on the shores of Loch Garten is operated by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB). It offers an observation center
to spy on the osprey, once thought to be extinct in Scotland. They still,
horribly, remain targets of assorted idiots, but since the mid-1950s, the
ospreys have returned from Africa to nest here in the spring. The obser-
vation center deploys telescopes and video cameras to help visitors see
the young birds of prey. Allow about two hours.

Admission: £3 ($5.55) adults, £2 ($3.70) seniors and children under 16, £6 ($11) family.
Open: Apr–Aug daily 10 a.m.–6 p.m.
Loch Ness
Okay, this is it: The dark and deep (274m/900-ft.), mysterious, and leg-
endary Loch Ness. In addition to looking for the elusive monster, you
should seek out other local attractions, such as Urquhart Castle (see
below) or the cairn of John Cobb, who died on the loch attempting to set
Chapter 18: The Highlands 359
Ullapool: Happenings at the harbor
Ullapool, on the shores of Loch Broom, is the busiest fishing port on the northwest coast
of Scotland. Established reasonably recently, in 1788, as a planned village by the British
Fisheries Society, the town has become a popular resort in its own right — the last out-
post before the sparsely populated northwest. If you need to stock up at a supermarket,
stop in Ullapool. It also has some good casual restaurants that feature freshly landed fish
and seafood, like crabs, while the Ceilidh Place (see “Spending the Night,” above) is a
hub of cultural activity with frequent music and dance events through the summer
season. The Ullapool Museum, West Argyle Street (% 01854-612-987; www.
ullapoolmuseum.co.uk), is open year-round; call for times.

a water speed record. Although the drive along the shore is good, the best
way to experience the loch is by boat (see the listing under “Guided tours,”
earlier in this chapter). As for the monster, little is known for certain.
Although no one can confirm that it exists, it’s apparently against the law
to kill it. Is it out there? I say no, but keep an eye out, just in case. Allow
anywhere from one to four hours, depending on your interest level.
See map p. 345. On the A82 or the B852 on the eastern shore. Admission: Free. Open:

Loch Ness Exhibition Centre
Drumnadrochit
Visiting this attraction is rather like reading Loch Ness For Dummies (if
there were such a book). In other words, it covers the bases without bury-
ing you in details. Focusing mainly on monster myths and the technology
of scientific monster-hunting, Loch Ness Exhibition Centre offers a rea-
sonably entertaining exhibit using laser lights and digital projection dis-
plays. And while the kids may marvel at the smoke and mirrors, you
actually learn a couple of things about the long history of sightings,
research, and theories on the monster. Allow about one hour.

Snow in the Highlands
Alas, it seems climate change has currently made snowfall increasingly rare in the
Highlands, and some resorts have tottered on closure. In addition to the Nevis Range
Gondola and Skiing (see “Other cool things to see and do”), the Highlands offers other
legitimate ski resorts. Glencoe has moderately challenging slopes and some great
views. The Glencoe Mountain Resort is near Kingshouse, off the A82 (% 0871-871-9929;
www.glencoemountain.com). The Cairngorms offers unpredictable weather, but
when the snow base is good, the whole family can enjoy skiing or snowboarding, as
well as other non-ski activities. Cairngorm Mountain resort (% 01479-861-261;
www.cairngormmountain.com) is located 14km (9 miles) from the town of
Aviemore and operates a controversial funicular railway to get you up the mountain.

has an interesting history, as well as on the monster. A film covers the his-
tory of Nessie sightings and explains how many are actually sightings of
something else, such as sea otters. The exhibition is full of pictures, includ-
ing other freaks of beast lore. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 345. On the A82. % 01456-450-342. www.lochness-centre.com.

Sands of Morar
Near Mallaig
Bonnie Prince Charlie apparently roamed these beautiful bleached
beaches 250 years ago while fleeing his pursuers. Set against postcard-
pretty seas, looking across at the islands Rhum and Eigg, Morar has been
used by filmmakers intent on capturing the quintessential Scottish back-
drop. Highlander and, to much better effect, Local Hero were filmed here.
Unfortunately, the sands can get rather crowded — at least by local stan-
dards — with sun-seeking locals and tourists in the summer. Allow about
one hour.
See map p. 345. Just off the A830, about 1.5km (1 mile) south of Morar. Admission:
Free. Open: year-round.
Sandwood Bay and Estate
Near Blairmore
Purchased in the early 1990s by the John Muir Trust, the Sandwood Estate
has the beach that is, by most accounts, the most beautiful and unsullied
on the entire mainland of Great Britain. Yes, getting there and back from
the nearest road requires a 14km (9-mile) hike on a peat-and-stone trail.
But then why do you think the dunes at Sandwood Bay are so pristine?
The entire estate covers many thousands of acres and encompasses crofts
and peat bogs as well as dunes and craggy coastline. From here, the ambi-
tious can also hike to Cape Wrath. Allow about three hours.
See map p. 345. Take the B801 from the A838 to Blairmore (about 96km/60 miles north
of Ullapool, via the A894). www.jmt.org. Admission: Free. Open: year-round.
Urquhart Castle
Loch Ness
Despite the impressive ruins, this large and significant castle (pronounced
irk-ett) has no strong clan association. Because its location on Loch Ness
was important for trade routes through the Highlands, the castle changed
hands many times since the 13th century. One of the last groups to occupy
it (before the tourists invaded) was Cromwell’s army in the 1650s; later it
was blown up to prevent Jacobite occupation. A recent addition to the visi-
tor center is an audiovisual display of views and history that plays before
you see the real thing. Allow about two hours.

Other cool things to see and do
 Brodie Castle, off the A96, about 11km (7 miles) east of Nairn 
(% 01309-641-371; www.nts.org.uk), may look a bit austere, but
this 16th-century tower house is a particularly good stop for art
fans; the collection of paintings includes 17th-century Dutch works,
as well as the Scottish Colourists.
 Dornoch Cathedral, on the main square of Dornoch, 13km (8 miles)
south of Tain (% 01862-810-296), dates to 1224 and was the site of
one of the last witch burnings in the 18th century. But another
reason you might wish to visit is because this is where Madonna
married Guy Ritchie.
 Eden Court Theatre, Bishop’s Road, Inverness (% 01463-234-234;
www.eden-court.co.uk), is much more than a place to see a play:
It is a full-blown contemporary arts center with a range of drama,
ballet, concerts, and art-house cinema. Redesigned and reopened
in November 2007, it is the best thing in this vein for hundreds of
kilometers.
 Glenmore Forest Park, off the B972 about 10km (6 miles) east of
Aviemore (% 01479-861-220; www.forestry.gov.uk), isn’t simply
a place of fine scenery. The attractions include Loch Morlich and
its sandy beach as well as a grove of ancient Caledonian Pinewood,
one of the few remaining in Scotland.
 Highland Folk Museum, Duke Street, on the A86, Kingussie 
(% 01540-673-551; www.highlandfolk.com), describes 400 years
of Highland life with collections of everyday objects, furniture,
machines, and more. In addition to this site, with its re-created his-
toric Blackhouse, in Newtonmore, the Folk Museum offers a recon-
structed 18th-century township and 1940s working farm.
 Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, Castle Wynd, off Bridge Street,
Inverness (% 01463-237-114; www.invernessmuseum.com),
reopened, with much improvement after renovations, in 2007. The
permanent collection includes the story of the Highlands’ geology,
prehistory, traditional music, culture, and various inhabitants.
There is space for contemporary art exhibitions and a section
devoted to local wildlife, too.
 John Cobb Cairn, between Drumnadrochit and Invermoriston, is a
place of pilgrimage for many wanting to honor Cobb, who lost his
life on Loch Ness in 1952, while making a second attempt at the
world water-speed record.
Part IV: The Major Regions 
362

 Nevis Range Mountain Experience, 10km (6 miles) north of Fort
William (% 01397-705-825; www.nevisrange.co.uk), has a gon-
dola that takes you up Aonach Mor Mountain, offering panoramic
views. In summer, you can hike paths around the area. In winter,
you can ski or snowboard if snow conditions are good.
Shopping in the Highlands
The major shopping center in the Highlands is the Eastgate Shopping
Centre, 11 Eastgate, off High Street, in Inverness (www.eastgate-
centre.co.uk). This American-style mall doesn’t cater specifically to
tourists, but it has major department stores. Eastgate is open from 9
a.m. until 5:30 p.m. most days, closing at 7 p.m. on Thursday and 5 p.m.
on Sunday. Balnakeil Craft Village (see “The top attractions,” earlier in
this chapter) is a good place to find unique gifts, while Ullapool (see the
sidebar “Ullapool: Happenings at the harbor”) has some interesting
small craft shops. Also consider
 Edinburgh Woollen Mill, 13 High St., Fort William (% 01397-
703-064), and 60 High St., at Monzie Square, Fort William (% 01397-
704-737), offering plenty of variety in finely crafted woolen and
tweed apparel at its sister stores. The best part is their excellent
bargains. Call for hours.

Doing the Pub Crawl
The Highlands have a good number of atmospheric, quintessentially
Scottish pubs where you can relax and enjoy a bit of pub grub. Some of
my favorites at country inns include the Arisaig, Plockton, and Scourie
hotels. Listed below are a couple additional pubs to consider.
 Claichaig Inn, Glencoe, follow the sign from the A82 or walk across
the footbridge from the visitor center (% 01855-811-252), has a
pub with a rustic wood-burning stove that warms the lounge and
bar. Climbers, tourists, and locals come here for a wee rest stop
and excellent ales on tap. Open Sunday through Thursday from 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Friday from 11 a.m. to midnight, and Saturday
from 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m.
 Hootananny, 61 Church St., Inverness (% 01463-233-651; www.
hootananny.co.uk), is a solid pub in the center of town with
Scottish real ales from the excellent Black Isle brewery, live tradi-
tional and folk music at weekends, and some pretty popular Thai
food, too. Open noon to midnight (to 1 a.m. Fri–Sat).

Hebridean Islands
In This Chapter
 Using ferries to hop from island to island
 Finding the best sandy beaches and most picturesque ports
 Discovering historic standing stones, churches, and castles
 Getting to some of the smaller isles for just a day
T
he allure of the Hebridean (Heb-ri-dee-an) Islands isn’t difficult 
to understand: The history and culture of the Scottish isles — 
combined with the beauty of the seascape — are utterly captivating.
Getting to the islands is half the fun, and when you arrive, you can be
almost guaranteed to have a peaceful retreat from the mainland, particu-
larly at places such as Iona or Eigg. If I had to pick my personal favorite
region of Scotland — a hard choice, indeed — it would probably be the
Hebrides.
Here are a few things you should know before you set out for these
islands.
Similar to other remote regions of Scotland, on the islands, many busi-
nesses — including hotels, restaurants, and attractions — close in the
off season. I have done my best to indicate when things are open, but if
you’re traveling between mid-October and mid-April, please check in
advance.
Also, due to rather devout Protestant beliefs, some towns and villages
become virtual ghost towns on Sunday, particularly in parts of the Outer
Hebrides. The Western Islands, home to the majority of Gaelic-speaking
people in Scotland, may have road signs posted only in Gaelic. Finally, the
Hebridean Islands get some of the most dramatic weather in Scotland —
in summer, sunshine can be followed by rain falling horizontally.
But none of that is any reason not to include at least a short stay on one
of the many islands that you can visit, whether Skye and Mull, which
hug the mainland coastline, or Harris or Uist, which are more far-flung.
There are no cities, per se, on any of the Herbridean Islands. The larger
ports are Portree on Skye, Tobermory on Mull, and Stornoway on Lewis.
These towns all have banks, shops, grocery stores, and other helpful
amenities.

Although the Hebrides chain is made up of several islands, many of
which are largely uninhabited, this chapter concentrates on the more
notable ones. Also, remember that the southernmost Hebridean island
of Islay is included in Chapter 15, “Ayrshire and Argyll.”
As long as you enjoy sailing on ferries, island hopping through the
Hebrides can be a real blast, even if the trips are time-consuming.
Alternatively, you can take one-day excursions from the mainland to
isles close to the coast for a taste of island life.
Getting to the Islands
One of the best things about any visit to the islands is the ferry ride.
Indeed, unless you charter a boat yourself or fly in, there is no other way
(with the exception of Skye) to get to the Hebrides. A network of boats
links the Outer and Inner Hebrides to the mainland and, in some cases,
to one another. You probably want a car to explore the islands, but you
can get around without one, by bus or bike.
 By ferry: The principal provider of ferry services is Caledonian
MacBrayne, or CalMac (% 08705-650-000 or 01475-650-100; www.
calmac.co.uk). Travel times vary. The ferry from Mallaig to
Armadale, Skye, takes only about 30 minutes. From Oban to
Craignure on Mull means about 45 minutes on the ferry. The trip
from Ullapool to Stornoway, Lewis, clocks in at slightly more than
21⁄2 hours. The larger ferries all have cafes and bars with lounges.
In late 2008, the prices of ferry trips from the mainland were
reduced significantly thanks to the Scottish Government and a trial
scheme called the Road Equivalent Tariff.
For additional savings on a trip through the Hebrides, you can take
advantage of CalMac’s “Island Hopscotch” tickets. For example, you
may jump between Skye, Uist, Harris, and Lewis, using the mainland
ports of Mallaig and Ullapool. Tickets for that hopscotch can be as
low as £20 ($37) per passenger and around £90 ($170) for a car.
CalMac offices in the region include Armadale, Skye (% 01471-
844-248); Craignure, Mull (% 01680-812-343); and Stornoway,
Lewis (% 01851-702-361). You can find contact information for
other local offices on the Web site.
You are not allowed to take a vehicle onto some of the smaller
islands, such as Iona, for example.
 By train: First ScotRail (% 0845-748-4950; www.firstscot
rail.com) runs trains to the Kyle of Lochalsh (terminating near
the Skye Bridge), Mallaig, and Oban. From the latter two, you can
get connecting ferries to the islands. Regular passenger trains don’t
run on the islands. On Mull, however, a narrow gauge train runs the
short trip from Craignure to Torosay Castle (% 01680-812-494;
www.mullrail.co.uk).

Hebridean Islands
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 367

 By bus: From Glasgow, Scottish Citylink (% 0141-332-9644 or
0870-550-5050; www.citylink.co.uk) runs buses to ferry ports such
as Oban and Ullapool. After you reach the islands, buses are con-
trolled by local authorities and by private companies. The service is
not as good as it perhaps should be, but pick up a local timetable
and you get by just fine by leaving the driving to someone else.
 By car: You can drive onto Skye over the bridge at the Kyle of
Lochalsh, on the A87, which is also the main road on the Isle of
Skye. On Mull, the main road is the A849, which links Tobermory to
Fionnophort via the ferry port at Craignure. Otherwise, it is mostly
one-lane (single-track) roads, many of which are twisting and turn-
ing. Take your time and exercise caution, especially as the locals will
know the roads like their proverbial palms and will travel at speeds
that you should not consider imitating. The smallest of the islands
don’t allow tourists in cars at all, making them all the more tranquil.
 By plane: The main airport is on Lewis (% 01851-702-256; www.
hial.co.uk), about 6.4km (4 miles) east of Stornoway. You can
arrange to fly there from Inverness, Edinburgh, or Glasgow. A non-
stop flight from Glasgow typically is about one hour long. There are
some inter-island flight services connecting Barra, Benbecula (part
of North Uist), and Stornoway — but it’s not necessary to fly.
Taking a ferry is part of the enjoyment of travel on the Hebrides.
Spending the Night
Because the islands have limited dining and drinking options, the accom-
modations listed in this section are also places to grab some food and
drink. The larger islands offer more accommodations options; you should
contact local tourist offices if you want to spend the night on a smaller
island. Breakfast is included except where otherwise noted. See Chapter 8
for an explanation of the star ratings given by VisitScotland.com — also
known as the Scottish Tourist Board — and for suggestions on renting
self-catering cottages, which is a possible option on any island tour.
Remember that hotels, large and small, may open seasonally on the
Hebrides, so always phone in advance if you’re traveling between
October and Easter. Better to confirm that they take you in rather than
showing up unannounced.
Finally, have a look at “Dining locally,” where I have highlighted which
restaurants also have overnight rooms.

but the bar lounge is surprisingly modern. Dining at Ardhasaig is often a
treat; the menu changes pretty much daily, emphasizing what is fresh and
locally available, such as pan-fried Harris scallops or fillet of venison. The
five overnight rooms are comfortably if basically furnished (no TVs), and
some include antique furniture, while all have views either of the hills or
of the sea. In 2004, the old stone barn was converted into a self-contained
suite with a king-size sleigh bed and sheepskin rugs.

Ardvasar Hotel
$$–$$$
Ardvasar
This lovely hotel (one of the oldest on Skye) is a good bet for a stay in the
southern part of the island. Near the Armadale ferry terminal (sailings
to/from Mallaig), the lodge, pub, and restaurant sit on the edge of the
Sound of Sleat. Ten comfortable bedrooms (three are spacious “superior”
class) have lovely views of the water or the rugged landscape of the
island’s interior. The food is about as good as it gets in the area, and the
pub bustles with grinning locals: It has been described as the hub of the
local community.

dinner. MC, V.
Argyll Hotel
$$–$$$
Iona
This environmentally conscientious hotel, dedicated to minimizing its
impact on the fragile small island ecology, was originally built in 1868 as
the village inn. The outstanding and obliging hospitality more than com-
pensates for some smallish overnight units. But why hang out in your bed-
room when you can spend time exploring Iona or relaxing in the Argyll’s
lounges, which face the water? The package that includes dinner is rec-
ommended — not least because the ingredients in your meal are actually
grown in the hotel’s own organic garden. Bargain hunters can opt for a
small double room with no en-suite bathroom. For green tourists, the
Argyll is a must, but even non–ecologically minded visitors will enjoy a
stay here. A two-night stay here is required.

Cabarfeidh Hotel
$$$
Stornoway
On Lewis, this modern hotel (built in the 1970s) is located in the middle of
a 3.2-hectare (8-acre) garden just outside of Stornoway’s town center.
Despite its recent vintage, there have been several refurbs to the
Cabarfeidh, the latest in spring 2007. The rooms are large and well uphol-
stered, and the service usually comes up trumps, too. The hotel’s Solas
Restaurant specializes in local seafood.

Just outside Portree, this 19th-century hunting lodge features excellent
views of the bay below and Cuillin crags in the distance. The four-star hotel
has about two-dozen rooms and is equally popular with hikers, birders,
and sportsmen. The conservatory is the place to relax, while the rooms
are full of quality furniture and generally have large bathrooms. The hotel’s
restaurant earns praise for its seafood and Highland game dishes.

Broadford
The Dunollie sits on the old harbor wall in Broadford, with views across
the Inner Sound of Raasay toward the Applecross hills of mainland
Scotland. The 84-unit hotel, all en suite with TVs, serves as a good holiday
base from which to explore the Isle of Skye. It’s popular with organized bus
tours, too, which may affect your decision.

Tarbert
This 24-room hotel is just up the hill from the ferry terminal in the quaint
harbor town of Tarbert. The pretty, white-washed building, built in 1865,
has modern décor, a comfortable selection of accommodations (including
a pair of family rooms), a large garden, and a spacious resident’s lounge.
One guest, Peter Pan author J.M. Barrie, mischievously etched his initials
in a dining room window.

Hotel Eilean Iarmain
$$$
Isleornsay
The Eilean Iarmain combines island hospitality with tranquillity and beau-
tiful surroundings. Many of the century-old building’s original antiques
remain in place, and the 12 rooms in the main building contain period fur-
niture. The views of the Sound of Sleat and the mainland beyond from the

Langass Lodge
$$–$$$
Locheport
Up a glen off the main road traversing the Isle of North Uist, the Langass
is a traditional hunting lodge with a few modern additions such as the
bright lounge off the bar, new dining room, and a wing of contemporary
overnight units: the “Hillside Rooms,” which are larger than those in the
main building. There is a small garden and walking trails to the nearby loch
and a prehistoric standing-stone circle. Meals can be quite tasty, with
dishes favoring local ingredients, such as clams or venison.

The Rosedale

Portree
This set of former fishermen’s houses near the water’s edge in Skye’s
largest harbor is warmly decorated, giving the place a snug B&B feel. An
eccentric layout of stairs and corridors connects lounges to the bar and
restaurant. The main building has cozy rooms that are simply decorated,
while those in another wing are more individually decorated. Most of the
units in either wing, however, overlook the harbor. Dinners normally
reflect seasonal produce.

Portree
If only I had a £5 note for every hotel named “The Royal” in Scotland. This
one occupies an enviable spot just up the road from the Portree pier. The
21 overnight rooms — recently upgraded — are comfortable. Many over-

Argyll
Although it doesn’t have the character of the Argyll (see above), St.
Columba’s setting near Iona Abbey (p. 380) never leaves you at a loss for
pretty views of the sea. A converted and expanded church manse dating
from 1846, the community-owned hotel has some large and well-furnished
rooms, including four for families (and, unusually, nine singles). Like the
Argyll, it too has a vegetable and herb garden following organic standards.

Sligachan
This 22-room hotel was built in the 1830s and retains much of its original
stonework, a classic look that complements the impressive location near

Tobermory
All the buildings at the harbor in Tobermory are brightly painted in pastel
colors, and the soft pink Tobermory Hotel is no exception. These con-
verted fishermen’s cottages on the waterfront contain 15 overnight rooms
(all en suite) and one double room with a separate bathroom. The hotel’s
“superior” double rooms overlook Tobermory Bay and feature king-size
beds. Its Water’s Edge restaurant is gaining a reputation for highlighting
excellent local produce, whether Isle of Mull cheese made just outside
town (see “Shopping,” later in this chapter), Glengorm lamb, or shellfish
landed at the pier.

Tobermory, Mull
Fans of the great black-and-white movie I Know Where I’m Going! (see
“Recommended movies,” in Chapter 2) should recognize this hotel on the
hill above Tobermory. A Victorian stone-front building overlooking the bay,
it offers old-world charm — and after a few years of mixed reviews from
guests, new owners appear to be giving the place the upgrading that it
needed. The hotel occupies a desirable spot, and several rooms have
vistas of the harbor below, though the best views are from the conserva-

Dining Locally
Few restaurants on the Hebridean Islands can thrive independently of a
hotel (there often are not enough locals to keep them in business), so
most of your dining options are likely to come from the previous section,
such as at the Argyll Hotel on Iona or the Water’s Edge in the Tobermory
Hotel. However, a few other restaurants stand out — and I have also
noted where they have overnight accommodations, too.
Although it isn’t listed below, you might try the fish-and-chips van at
Tobermory Harbour — it produces possibly the best “fish suppers” in 
all of Scotland.
The Chandlery Restaurant
$$$
Portree
FISH/MODERN SCOTTISH/FRENCH
One-time Scottish restaurant of the year, the Chandlery (in the Bosville
Hotel, with overnight rooms) specializes in seafood and game dishes. It
has been described as reason enough to make the journey to Skye.
Occupying a lovely spot overlooking Portree Harbour, the place has an
airy feel. Service is efficient and professional, serving up treats from Chef
John Kelly such as hand-dived scallops from Loch Silgachan or fresh lan-
goustines landed at the harbor. Signature dishes include a smoked ham
hock and Mallaig monkfish terrine or seared loin of Highland lamb.

ishly did. Dishes, such as pan-fried scallop of venison or prawn tails in

Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 375

Exploring the Hebrides
From the spiritual mecca of Iona to the sandy beaches of Harris, not to
mention the many ancient and royal attractions in between, the
Hebridean Islands offer quite a lot, with no shortage of natural beauty.
Indeed, the islands are attractions in themselves, but you find plenty to
see besides the scenery.
The biggest island of the Inner Hebrides is the Isle of Skye. Thanks to a
controversial bridge (well, the toll was controversial at least), visitors
can drive onto it at Kyle of Lochalsh. Your other option is to take a ferry
from the mainland harbor of Mallaig. Eighty-one kilometers (50 miles)
long and 37km (23 miles) wide, Skye offers memorable landscapes, his-
toric attractions, and a good deal of accommodations and dining
options. Portree is the main town on Skye.
Closer to central Scotland, and thus perhaps more accessible, is the Isle
of Mull, home to the picturesque port of Tobermory, a few castles,
plenty of scenery, and the added value of little sister island Iona. Mull
has a reputation for being the rainiest of the Hebridean Islands, but on
my visits, I have not found it noticeably wetter. After you arrive in
Craignure (which has little to offer other than the nearby castles of
Duart and Torosay), you can head north to Tobermory or west toward
Fionnphort to catch a ferry to the Isle of Iona. Give yourself an hour no
matter which way you decide to go — the highway turns into a single-
lane road in either direction. Tobermory, the largest town on Mull, is
worth a visit. Brightly painted houses and storefronts in pastel shades of
blue, red, and yellow give Tobermory the look of a little Copenhagen and
the feel of an Italian fishing village.
To see Mull and Iona in a single (if long) day, Bowman’s Tours (ferry and
coach) run from Oban from April through October. Fares are around £30
($56). Call % 01631-566-809, or log on to www.bowmanstours.co.uk for
more information. From Ullapool, the MV Summer Queen offers two- to
four-hour cruises around some of the Summer Isles just off the north-
west coastline (% 01851-612-472; www.summerqueen.co.uk).
Beyond Skye are the connected islands of Lewis and Harris (the latter
being famous for its tweed), forming the largest island in the Outer
Hebrides. You likely arrive either at the ferry terminals in Tarbert (a
common name in western Scotland that essentially means isthmus) or
farther north in Stornoway, the administrative capital of the Western
Isles. The southern coastal drive on Harris is an attraction in itself — a
rocky and barren landscape transforms into a Gulf Stream miracle of
bleached beaches and blue waters.
Some of the other islands — Barra, Coll, Eigg, Rhum, and North and
South Uist — are smaller and sparsely populated, though a few can pro-
vide visitors with easy day-trip opportunities for a wee taste of island
life.

The top attractions
Armadale Castle Gardens & Museum of the Isles
Armadale
The Armadale estate, on the sound of Sleat in southern Skye, covers more
than 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres). It traditionally belonged to the clan
Donald or Macdonald, known as the Lords of Isles, but now held in trust.
The old castle is in ruins but it still occupies a magnificent spot with 19th-
century woodland gardens, nature trails, and sea views. It isn’t difficult to
understand the allure of this place. The museum, opened in 2002, is full of
information about the historically significant clan, at one time as powerful
as Scottish royalty. The castle grounds are home to a large variety of dif-
ferent trees and plants, all flourishing thanks to the Gulf Stream’s warm-
ing effects. Allow about two hours.

Nov–Mar, except gift shop 11a.m.–3 p.m.
The Black House
Arnol
A Historic Scotland property, this attraction steps back a hundred years or
so to depict traditional island living. Built in 1885 and occupied (remark-
ably) until 1964, this “black house” is a traditional Hebridean stone, turf,
and thatched-roof structure, which served as both home and byre. In the
middle of the main room, an open peat fire glows and smolders on the dirt
floor with the smoke drifting up through the thatch roof. Visitors are free
to poke around and the information center gives more background on a
lost way of life; the displays don’t paint a particularly pretty picture of
what was rather rough living. Across the road is the “white house,” the
more modern cottage built of stone and proper mortar which replaced
black houses across Lewis and the Hebrides.
The peat fire has been known in the past to sometimes fill the black house
with smoke, but that’s the cost of authenticity. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 367. Off the A858, on the west side of Lewis. % 01851-710-395. www.

6:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m.
Butt of Lewis
Ness
High cliffs overlooking the ocean are the principal reward for making it to
the northern tip of Lewis. You should see seabirds, seals, and spectacular
windblown waves crashing against the rocks. The proud lighthouse, con-
structed by the Stevenson family, adds to the scenery. Look for the large
hole in the ground near the parking area; legend has it that the Vikings dug
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 377

the hole in an attempt to drag the island back to Norway with them. Allow
about one hour.
See map p. 367. Follow the A857 to the end of the line, Lewis.
Calanais Standing Stones
Callanish
Sometimes known as the “Scottish Stonehenge,” this ancient circle- and
cross-shaped formation of large standing stones is the most significant
archaeological find of its kind in the region. There’s no charge to see the
impressive and ragged stones, which were erected sometime around
3000–2500 B.C. and were — until the mid-1800s — buried much deeper in
the bog on top the hill. In fact, they are much taller than they appear today
but are still quite deep in peat. If you’re here during the summer solstice,
you may find tents pitched near the monoliths — Calanais has become a
popular spot for New Agers to celebrate the longest day of the year. Allow
about one hour.
See map p. 367. Off the A858 (19km/12 miles west of Stornoway), Lewis. % 01851-

round; visitor center Apr–Sept Mon–Sat 10 a.m.–6 p.m., Oct–Mar Wed–Sat 10 a.m.–4 p.m.
Cuillin Hills
Near Broadford
These dark and massive hills — craggy enough to pass for mountains —
are a point of pride for the residents of Skye. Considered some of the best
climbing and hiking in Scotland, the 900m (3,000-ft.) peaks rise in the
center of the island.
You might consider spending an afternoon walking amid the spectacular
scenery, but if you’re inexperienced, inquire about professional guides
at the tourist office in Portree. A private company called Walkabout
Scotland organizes multiday guided hiking tours (call % 0845-686-1344
or log on to www.walkaboutscotland.com). Allow three to six hours.
See map p. 369. South of the A87, between Broadford and Sligachan, Skye. Trails
from Glen Brittle, south of Merkadale off the A863.
Doune Broch (Dun Carloway)
Carloway
Up the road from the Calanais Standing Stones (see above), this intriguing
Iron Age stone ruin (a “broch” was a tower used for defensive purposes
and/or as a home) is in remarkably sound condition — good enough for
you to walk into, at least. Properly called Dun Carloway, the broch pro-
vides some insight into prehistory. It wasn’t all bad back then, either:
Regardless of the weather outside, stepping into the broch provides sur-
prisingly effective protection from the elements. Allow about one hour.

Duart Castle
Near Craignure
Fans of the entertaining 1945 film I Know Where I’m Going! (see
“Recommended movies,” in Chapter 2) should recognize the drawing room
in this fine castle. With a commanding position overlooking the Sound of
Mull and clearly seen from the Oban ferry, Duart was abandoned in 1751.
Thanks to the efforts of Fitzroy Maclean, it was completely restored from
ruins in 1911. When you’re inside, make your way up the narrow, twisting
stairs and you can walk outside on the parapet at the top of the castle. As
the ancestral home of the clan Maclean, one floor is devoted to clan his-
tory, with various references to the 17th-century battle cry: “Another for
Hector!” Today, Duart Castle remains the home for the clan chief. There
are no special gardens to tour, but visiting the grounds is free. Allow about
one and a half hours.

Oct daily 10:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Apr Sun–Thurs. Closed mid-Oct to Mar.
Dunvegan Castle
Dunvegan, Skye
The seat of the Macleod chiefs, this is said to be Scotland’s oldest castle,
continually owned and occupied by the same family, going on 800 years now.
In addition to antiques, oil paintings, rare books, and clan heirlooms — some
dating to the Middle Ages — have a look at the legendary Fairy Flag, a relic
thought to bring “miraculous powers” to the clan. Also displayed are per-
sonal items belonging to Bonnie Prince Charlie, plus there’s a reasonably
creepy dungeon. Allow two hours.

10 a.m.–5 p.m.; Nov–Mar 11 a.m.–4 p.m.
Eigg
The Isle of Eigg lies not far off the west coast of Scotland and can be
reached from either Mallaig or Arisaig. The latter offers summer cruises
(on the Sheerwater), which often have the bonus of whale-sightings on the
hour-long ride. In 1997, the inhabitants made history and set up a trust to
buy the island. Visitors can take a variety of walks on the island, including
the slightly strenuous hike up An Sgurr (the notch), the largest exposed
piece of pitchstone in the U.K. The hike takes about two hours. An easier
trek is to see chapel ruins on Kildonan Bay. A small tea room and place to
rent bicycles are located at the small pier. Eigg is close enough to Arisaig
that you can easily make a day trip of it and get a small dose of island life.
For information on sailings from Arisaig, log on to www.arisaig.co.uk or

Gearrannan Blackhouse Village
Carloway, Lewis
This set of stone houses dates to about 1800, although Gearrannan was
probably first settled around the time that Christ was born. The focus of
the attraction is the working blackhouse, which provides an interesting
contrast with the Arnol Blackhouse (see above). It shows what happened
once electricity was introduced. There are a proper fireplace, wood floors,
tongue-and-groove wall paneling, more windows, and electric lamps. But
the home is still at a tremendous tilt due to the slope of the hill. In the byre,
there is a working loom and someone on duty to show how it operates.
The other blackhouses have been turned into vacation accommodations
and a youth hostel. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 367. Off the A858 (40km/25 miles west of Stornoway). % 01851-643-416.

Iona Abbey
Iona
This spiritual landmark is a significant shrine to the early days of
Christianity in Scotland. The settlement (of both historic and sacred value)
was first established by St. Columba, a Celtic pilgrim from Ireland.
Columba almost single-handedly brought religion to a pagan land in the
sixth century. The large abbey standing here today is in very good shape,
having undergone several restorations since the 13th century. Crosses laid
into the abbey floor mark the graves of several monks, while there are
impressive medieval crosses on the grounds. The cemetery has graves of
early Scottish royals and chiefs. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
You can see Iona in one day, although overnight stays are quite relaxing
on this tiny island.

North and South Uist
Although no single attraction on North and South Uist (pronounced yewst)
necessarily stands out, these two islands (connected by causeways and the
isle of Benbecula) are worth a visit. Certainly consider it if you’re on Lewis
and Harris or even in northwest Skye (from where the ferry crossing out of
Uig takes just under two hours). Devote at least a full day to cross the rural
landscape and take in the scenery, landmarks, and fresh air. Be sure to get
off the main road, too, at least occasionally, to explore the rural lanes that
get closer to the sea. At the Balranald Nature Reserve, you can spot many
types of wading birds and other sea life. It is only about 82km (51 miles)
from Lochmaddy south to Lochboisdale. Allow at least eight hours.

St. Clement’s Church
Rodel, Harris
Is it worth traveling to the southern tip of Harris to see this far-flung attrac-
tion? Aye, it pretty much is. At the end of an amazing coastal route full of
white beaches and aqua-blue waters, you arrive at this small but well-pre-
served early-16th-century pre-Reformation church. It is certainly the best
of its type in the Western Isles, following a cruciform plan with a square
tower at one end. The most impressive feature, aside from the intact stone
edifice itself, is the carved tomb of Alexander Macleod of Dunvegan (aka
Alasdair Crotach), who had it done well before he died in the late 1540s.
Protected from the elements and literally built into the church, it is a
remarkably well-preserved bit of medieval craftsmanship. There are other
startling details elsewhere, including a carving of St. Clement and, curi-
ously, a naked woman. Allow one hour.
See map p. 367. On the A859, Rodel. Admission: Free. Open: Daily dawn to dusk.
Skye Museum of Island Life and Flora MacDonald’s Grave
Kilmuir, Skye
The place where Flora MacDonald was born is marked on South Uist. On
Skye, if you follow a path from the Museum of Island Life to Kilmuir
Cemetery, you can see the Victorian-era memorial marking the grave of
the legendary Flora. She is credited with saving Bonnie Prince Charlie in
1746. The Young Pretender hid on Skye with her help after the battle of
Culloden and escaped disguised as MacDonald’s maid. Poor Flora was
later arrested as an accessory and held in the Tower of London. Later, she
moved to North Carolina and finally back to Skye before she died. The
locally run “museum” actually consists of a set of thatched croft (small-
holding) houses, showing how people lived on Skye a century or more ago.
The re-created crofts contain antique domestic items, agricultural tools,

Staffa and Fingal’s Cave
Just a short boat trip from Mull, the uninhabited Isle of Staffa is an attrac-
tion worth seeing if you’re spending some time in the Mull-Iona area.
Visitors enjoy watching the sea crash against the dramatic, vertical rock
formations, especially the cathedral-like columns of Fingal’s Cave. The
cave is one of the natural wonders of the world and is famous for being
the inspiration for Mendelssohn’s Hebridean Overture. Birders, take note:
Staffa is home to a large puffin colony. Unfortunately, in the midseason,
some of the boats won’t sail if they don’t get enough reservations. Allow
two to four hours.

Torosay Castle and Gardens
Near Craignure, Mull
Compared to nearby Duart Castle, Torosay is a relatively modern house,
built in the Victorian era. Access to the interiors here is more limited, too,
because most of the building is still used as a private home. But whatever
the restrictions indoors, the surrounding gardens are the real attraction
for many visitors. The 4.8 hectares (12 acres) of well-manicured grounds
abound with fine and unique flora, Romanesque statues, and ivy-covered
walls. You’re welcome to explore the greenhouse and are encouraged to
stop and smell the roses; this stop is a treat for anyone with a green thumb.
Kids usually enjoy the small-scale train (£4.50/$8.35 adults, £3/$5.55 chil-
dren) that runs to Torosay from Craignure. Allow 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 367. Off the A849 (about 1.5km/1 mile south of Craignure ferry terminal).
% 01680-812-421. www.torosay.com. Admission: Castle and gardens £6 ($11)
adults, £5 ($9.25) seniors, £3.50 ($6.50) children, £16 ($30) family. Open: Daily Apr–Oct

Western Isles Museum (Museum nan Eilean)
Stornoway, Lewis

paintings. The temporary shows, sometimes borrowed from other muse-
ums and collections around the islands and from the Scottish mainland,

Cruising the Inner Hebrides
The MV Glen Tarsan is a converted 26m (85-ft.) fishing boat that can take groups
(Apr–Oct) to explore the Inner Hebrides. From Oban, typical cruises dot about the isles,
such as Mull or Staffa, as well as sailing into West Coast inlets, looking for dolphins or
eagles, fishing for lobster, mooring to allow onshore hikes, and sheltering at night in pic-
turesque bays, when hearty meals are shared in the deck saloon. Cabins are spartan (as
you would expect for a vessel) but comfortable, with en-suite heads and showers. A
six-night cruise costs about £1,400 ($2,590) per person, including meals and house wines
with dinner. Only drinks from the bar are charged extra. Call the Majestic Line at 
% 0131-623-5012, or log onto www.themajesticline.co.uk.

can be excellent. If you’re in Stornoway, this museum is worth a visit — and
you can’t beat the price. Allow one hour.

Other cool things to see and do
 An Lanntair, Kenneth St., Stornoway (% 01851-703-307; www.
lanntair.com), is an excellent arts and culture center, with exhibi-
tion space for art and an auditorium for drama, music, and films.
The gift shop is good and so is the cafe/bar/bistro upstairs. Open
Monday to Saturday from 10 a.m.
 Ardalanish Farm & Isle of Mull Weavers, off the A849 near
Bunessan, Mull (% 01681-700-265; www.isleofmullweavers.
co.uk), is an organic farm on the Ross of Mull that doesn’t mind 
visitors. In fact, you’re welcome to see how a demonstration organic
farm works. In addition to self-guided walks, the weavers offer bun-
dled yarn and tweed by the yard.
 Aros (the Home of Culture and Hospitality), just south of Portree
on the A87 (% 01478-613-649; www.aros.co.uk), is a cultural
center on the Isle of Skye that has an art gallery, shops, and cafe,
and is a venue for music, drama, and films.
 Aros Castle, off the A848 (about 3km/2 miles north of Salen), Isle of
Mull, is a monumental pile of rocks in the shape of a ruined tower
house, on a hill overlooking Salen Bay. But it was once a stronghold
of the MacDougalls and the Lords of the Isles. The ruins, at least
during my last visit, were not fenced off.
 Mull Theatre, Tobermory, Mull (% 01688-302-828; www.mull
theatre.com), is home to a surprisingly accomplished dramatic
company that tours Scotland. This new facility opened in early 2007
outside Tobermory.
 Skye Serpentarium, on the A850 near Broadford, Skye (% 01471-
822-209; www.skyeserpentarium.org.uk), is crazy about its col-
lection of reptiles and amphibians, many of which were seized
(while being smuggled into the country) by customs officials and
sent to this serpentarium for the good life.
 Talisker Distillery, off the A863, Carbost, Skye (% 01478-614-308),
offers a tour that’s among the best. Enthusiastic guides expound on
the virtues of their single-malt whisky (the only one produced on
Skye) and its production process.
 Tobermory Distillery, Tobermory, Mull (% 01688-302-645), the
only distillery on Mull, produces five different single malts with
unpeated malted barley (not typical of island whisky). A visitor
center is located on the premises.
Chapter 19: Hebridean Islands 383

 Ulva is the small isle located just across a narrow straight from the
settlement of Ulva Ferry (off the B8073) in west-central Mull. During
the Clearances, from about 1840 to 1882, when thousands of Scots
were evicted from their homes, Ulva’s population went from about
850 to less than 60 — and the remaining residents were forced to
live in one small corner near the ferry slip called Desolation Point.
A cafe, serving fresh oysters, is almost reason enough for you to
hop the ferry to Ulva, but the isle is excellent for walking, too.
Shopping the Hebridean Islands
Despite their remoteness, the Hebridean Islands are home to a fair
number of excellent craft and specialty shops. Some of the best gifts can
be found at shops within the various attractions listed earlier in this
chapter. In the Outer Hebrides, Harris Tweed is sold at a lot of stores, as
well as at small home shops where the product is woven on site.
 Edinbane Pottery, off the A850, between Portree and Dunvegan,
Skye (% 01470-582-234; www.edinbane-pottery.co.uk), is a
workshop and gallery that produces some unique and mostly hand-
thrown salt-glazed ceramics. Open April to October daily from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m.
 Isle of Mull Cheese, Sgriob-Ruadh Farm, near Tobermory, Mull 
(% 01688-302-235; www.isleofmullcheese.co.uk), is a farm pro-
ducing award-winning, artisan cheeses using only cow’s and ewe’s
milk from the premises. Delicious. Open May to September daily
from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
 Isle of Mull Silver & Goldsmiths, Main Street, Tobermory, Mull 
(% 01688-302-345; www.mullsilver.co.uk), is part manufacturer,
part retail shop. They make pieces in-house and have an impres-
sive selection from across Scotland. The shop is open Monday
through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2 to 5 p.m. Hours
may be extended in the summer.
 Over the Rainbow, Portree, Skye (% 01478-612-555; www.skye
knitwear.com), is stocked with colorful knits of first-rate quality,
whether sweaters, scarves, or blankets. The shop also sells designer
jewelry and accessories. Open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m.
 Tobermory Handmade Chocolate, Main Street, Tobermory, Mull
(% 01688-302-526; www.tobchoc.co.uk), makes unique hand-
made confections locally, whether 71 percent pure dark-chocolate
treats (such as a rum truffle) or after-dinner mints. Open March to
October Monday through Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. in July and August.

Doing the Pub Crawl
Many of the inns and restaurants listed at the beginning of this chapter
offer pub life, too. Below are a few more to consider. Call for the latest
opening and closing times.
 Isles Inn, Somerled Square, Portree, Skye (% 01478-612-129), is a
cozy, friendly pub (with overnight rooms) in the center of Portree.
It’s a popular joint featuring traditional music most nights, espe-
cially in the summer.
 Martyr’s Bay, near the pier, Iona (% 01681-700-382), is a bar (and
restaurant) with sea views, and is named for the nearby inlet where
some 68 monks were killed by Vikings in the 9th century.
 Mishnish, Main Street, Tobermory, Mull (% 01688-302-009), is a
quayside pub (with overnight rooms) that’s rather big for such a
diminutive town. There are two main areas, with a warming fire-
place, as well as “snugs” (small rooms) for a little more privacy.

Chapter 20
Orkney and Shetland
Islands
In This Chapter
 Uncovering accommodations and restaurants on the islands
 Discovering prehistoric sites and settlements
M
aking the trip to the northern island groups of Orkney and
Shetland can be rewarding, but if you do plan to visit either archi-
pelago, you should know that getting there does take extra effort.
If you reach these islands, you will discover that they abound with grand
views, old ruins, and a heritage unlike the rest of Scotland. Given the
long ribbon of history, they arguably have as much in common with
Scandinavia as with Scotland. The location is so far north that midsum-
mer nights get no darker than twilight. As for weather, these islands can
feel chilly with a steady breeze often blowing. Yet given how far north
they are, these nearly flat isles should be a lot colder. Winter offers scant
sunlight and often brings snow.
Visitors will find that accommodations, dining, shopping, and drinking
options are more limited in such northern latitudes. In the off season,
the quiet gets even quieter. Keep in mind that although the Orkney and
Shetland islands offer an escape from the crowds, in many ways you’re
escaping conveniences, too.
Kirkwall is the main town in Orkney, where the ferries from Aberdeen
arrive. To the west is Stromness, another key port village, where ferries
arrive from the northern Scottish mainland city of Scrabster near
Thurso. In Shetland, Lerwick is the administrative capital and largest
port town, receiving ferries from Aberdeen, Kirkwall, and in summer
from Bergen, Norway, too. Shetland is also today a major terminus for
pipelines from the North Sea oil platforms.
Given the limited tourist offerings on the islands, I keep this chapter
short and succinct, combing the accommodations and dining options
into one section. For greater details, contact the local tourist informa-
tion centers. For Orkney, call the Kirkwall center (% 01856-872-856) or

log on to www.visitorkney.com. For Shetland, call the Lerwick center
(% 08701-999-440), or go to the Web site, www.visitshetland.com.
Getting There
For many travelers, the simplest way to see the islands is to join a tour
that covers the major sights in the area. If you’re not on a tour, you can
get to both Orkney and Shetland by ferry or by airplane. The major
islands of the groups have ferry services that connect them to one
another.
 By ferry: NorthLink Ferries (% 0845-600-0449; www.northlink
ferries.co.uk) operates services from the mainland to Orkney
and Shetland, either from Scrabster to Stromness, Orkney;
Aberdeen to Kirkwall, Orkney; or Aberdeen to Lerwick, Shetland.
Typical fares range from around £13 to £33 ($24–$61) per adult
(plus vehicle fee), depending on the route and the time of year. The
trip from Scrabster to Stromness takes about 90 minutes; the
overnight journey from Aberdeen to Lerwick takes 121⁄2 hours.
Smaller companies also run boats to Orkney. Summer passenger-
only ferries, run by John O’Groats Ferries (% 01955-611-353;
www.jogferry.co.uk), go from John O’Groats to Burwick
(May–Sept, 40 min.). Pentland Ferries (% 01856-831-226; www.
pentlandferries.co.uk) travel from Gills Bay to St. Margaret’s
Hope (1 hr.).
 By car: If you’ve rented a car for your time in Scotland, you can
take it with you when you visit Orkney by booking passage on one
of the NorthLink Ferries (see above). You can make arrangements
with many car-rental agencies for free vehicle pickup and delivery
at ferry landings and airports in Scotland.
 By plane: Kirkwall Airport (% 01856-886-210) is about 5km 
(3 miles) from the center of Kirkwall, Orkney. Sumburgh Airport
(% 01950-461-000) is 40km (25 miles) south of Lerwick on
Shetland. Both airports are operated by Highlands and Islands
Airports (% 01667-462-445; www.hial.co.uk). There is regular, if
not necessarily frequent, nonstop service to Aberdeen, Glasgow,
Edinburgh, and Inverness. For example, a flight from Inverness to
Sumburgh takes about one hour and 45 minutes and costs around
£150 ($278).
Spending the Night and Dining Locally
Your choices of accommodations and restaurants are more limited on
Orkney and Shetland. I’ve tried to give you some of the better options in
this section. Hotel-room prices include full breakfast unless otherwise
stated. You may well get a better deal than the advertised “rack” rates.
Chapter 20: Orkney and Shetland Islands 387

I have also tried to indicate when ventures are closed throughout or
during a part of the off season, but call in advance to confirm. Also,
expect higher costs on the northern islands, despite some of the more
established inns having a reputation for outdated accommodations.
Ayre Hotel
$$
Kirkwall
A renovated 18th-century hotel, the Ayre overlooks Kirkwall harbor — 
perhaps its strongest point. Rooms are simply decorated, but they do have
en-suite bathrooms, TVs, and coffeemakers. The white-washed building is
conveniently located near the town center and by the water. Rooms with
a sea view cost more.

Burrastow House
$$–$$$$
Near Walls
SCOTTISH
Talk about getting away from it all. Still, if you’re planning to spend some
time on Shetland, a weekend dinner reservation at Burrastow House might
be in order. The menus feature local fish, lamb, beef, and pork — even the
cucumbers and tomatoes in your salad are likely to be grown locally. While
sheep graze on the grass outside, you graze on mussel stew, monkfish, and
homemade soups. If you’re looking to spend the night, Burrastow is a four-
star guesthouse with five en-suite rooms.

The Creel

South Ronaldsay
FISH/SEAFOOD
This restaurant with rooms in St. Margaret’s Hope is run by chef/owner
Alan Craigie, who was named Scottish Restaurant Chef of the Year in 2006
by the country’s Independent Chef’s Association. For over 21 years, he and
his staff have treated guests to dishes made almost exclusively with locally
landed fish and shellfish — including some lesser-seen varieties such as
megrim and torsk. There is also grass-fed Ornkey beef and lamb, which
itself dines on seaweed. There are three overnight rooms, all with sea
views.
See map p. 391. Off the A961, Front Road, St. Margaret’s Hope (21km/13 miles south
of Kirkwall), Orkney. % 01856-831-311. www.thecreel.co.uk. Reservations rec-
ommended. Main courses: £17 ($30). Open: Daily Apr–Oct; some weekends in winter
(call first). Rack rates: £105 ($194) double. MC. V.

Overlooking the waters of Scapa Flow, this popular and highly regarded
small three-star hotel is just a short trip from Kirkwall. Most rooms have
sea views. If you decide to eat in-house, you should get a fine Scottish meal
with locally grown produce, Orkney beef and lamb, fresh seafood, and
excellent desserts.

Exploring Orkney and Shetland
Attraction for attraction, Orkney, given its ancient landmarks with World
Heritage Site status, has more going for it than Shetland. It’s been said
that no other northern European location can equal Orkney’s concentra-
tion of visible prehistoric monuments. The top sights are on the largest
island in the group: What locals — or Orcadians — call the Mainland.
Orkney also offers spectacular seascapes and plenty of unspoiled

nature. The quaint town of Stromness has been a natural harbor since
Viking times, and Kirkwall is the lovely capital of the island chain.
To see some of the smaller islands of Orkney, such as Hoy or Shapinsay,
Orkney Ferries (% 01856-872-044; www.orkneyferries.co.uk) offers
sailings and minicruises.
Of the more than 100 islands that make up the Shetlands, only about 15
are inhabited. Similar to Orkney, the main island is called the Mainland.
The Norse gave the island chain to Scotland through a marriage dowry
in 1469, but the legacy of its Scandinavian origins shows in the faces of
the locals, the names of villages, and the architecture of the main town,
Lerwick. Nature abounds in the beautiful scenery, from Shetland ponies
that roam freely to seals and porpoises that live along the coasts. Like
the people of Orkney, Shetland residents’ identities are probably more
strongly tied to their islands than to Scotland.
Be sure to stop at the tourist offices in Kirkwell (Orkney) and Lerwick
(Shetland) and pick up the handy maps showing both large and small
attractions.
Joining a guided tour
A guided tour can be a smart, convenient way to get around and see spe-
cific sights. Here are two to consider.
 Wildabout Orkney Tours (% 01856-851-011; www.wildabout
orkney.com) offers excursions covering the island’s prehistoric
highlights, with guides also discussing the history, archaeology,
and ecology of Orkney.
 Shetland Wildlife (% 01950-422-483; www.shetlandwildlife.
co.uk) specializes in guided tours that show off Shetland’s diverse
wildlife. It offers a selection of multiday tours, such as the “Shetland
experience,” which combines sea cruises and overland journeys in
search of puffins, whales, otters, and more.

Bishop’s and Earl’s Palaces
Kirkwall
The impressive ruins of the Bishop’s Palace date to the 12th century,
although most of what’s standing today — the Earl’s Palace — was con-
structed in the 1600s. History says that King Haakon of Norway returned
here to die after losing the battle of Largs (southwest of Glasgow) in 1263.
The despotic Earl Patrick Stuart built the Earl’s Palace next door in about
1606. Stuart, son of a bastard step-brother to Mary Queen of Scots, treated
the local subjects rottenly, though he was ultimately executed for treason.

In its day, his palace (completed after his death) was among the finest exam-
ples of French Renaissance architecture in Scotland. Allow about two hours.

Jarlshof
Near Sumburgh
This prehistoric and Norse settlement was discovered after a particularly
violent storm, in 1897, washed away the sand that had covered it for mil-
lennia. Subsequent archaeological digs have further revealed settlements
and remarkable artifacts from different civilizations, from the Stone Age
to the Viking era. Highlights include an oval Bronze Age house, an Iron Age
broch (stone house and fortification), wheelhouses, a medieval farmstead,
and the relatively modern 16th-century laird’s house. As for the
Scandinavian-sounding name meaning “earl’s house,” it comes from Sir
Walter Scott’s novel The Pirate. The correct name for the site is Sumburgh,
derived from the Old Norse borg, or “fort.” Allow about two hours.
See map p. 389. Off the A97, at Sumburgh Head (35km/22 miles south of Lerwick),

Maes Howe
West Mainland
This strange turf-covered mound dates to about 3000 B.C., and contains a
burial cairn that is probably the finest bit of Neolithic construction in
northern Europe. By some estimates, as a prehistoric feat of engineering,
it is only surpassed by the far more famous Stonehenge in England. You
find a stone-built passage, a burial chamber, and smaller cells. Look for the
inscriptions along the walls written by Vikings who pillaged the tomb’s
treasures in the 12th century: A bit of ancient Norse graffiti, if you like.
During the shortest days of the year, in December and early January, the
sun shines precisely down the entrance passage and illuminates the rear
of the central chamber. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 391. Off the A965 (14km/9 miles west of Kirkwall), Orkney. % 01856-

dren 5–15. Open: Daily Apr–Sept 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar 9:30 a.m.–4 p.m.
Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness
West Mainland
Not far from Maes Howe, these two sets of standing stones are certainly
impressive: The tallest stone of the Stenness henge is about 6m (19 ft.)
high, a bit more imposing than those in the Brodgar group, which is saying
Chapter 20: Orkney and Shetland Islands 393

something. The circles, part of the Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site,
are within walking distance of each other. Thirty-six of the 60 original
stones in the Ring of Brodgar (probably erected between 2500–2000 B.C.)
remain standing, while only 4 of 12 at Stenness (maybe as old as 3400 B.C.)
are still upright. When the fog rolls in, the rings are quite a sight, but on any
day most visitors are moved by these monuments. Allow about 11⁄2 hours.
See map p. 391. Off the A965 (18km/11 miles west of Kirkwall), Orkney. % 01856-
841-815. Admission: Free. Open: Year-round.
St. Magnus Cathedral
Kirkwall
Dominating the town of Kirkwall, this sandstone cathedral honors Magnus,
a Norse earl killed in the 12th century by cousin Haakon, who then went
on to become king. After Magnus was buried in Birsay, however, miracles
began occurring and he was made a saint in 1135. Magnus’s nephew, Earl
Rognvald, after a bit of crusading (and perhaps some slave-trading, too)
then initiated construction of this cathedral in 1137. Along with Glasgow’s
St. Mungo’s, it is Scotland’s only pre-Reformation cathedral that remains
substantially intact. It retains grand features, from huge sandstone
columns to beautiful stained glass. Allow one hour.
See map p. 391. Broad Street, Orkney. % 01856-874-894. Admission: Free. Open:
Apr–Sept Mon–Sat 9 a.m.–5 p.m., Sun 2–6 p.m.; Oct–Mar Mon–Fri 9 a.m.–5 p.m.
(closed for lunch 1–2 p.m.).
Scalloway Castle
Scalloway
These ruins date back to the time of Earl Patrick Stuart — not a popular
figure in these parts thanks to his corruption and brutality — who built
this castellated mansion in 1600. In fact, he used forced labor to do it. After
he was executed, the building fell into disrepair, but it still makes for good
photographs. To gain access Monday to Saturday from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
get the key from Shetland Woolen Company next door. On Sunday, get it
from the nearby hotel. Allow about one hour.
See map p. 389. Off the A970 (about 10km/6 miles west of Lerwick), Shetland. 
% 01856-841-815. www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: Free.
Skara Brae
West Mainland
Along with Maes Howe and the standing stones detailed above, the turf-
covered stone walls of this prehistoric beachside village — the best of its
type in northern Europe — completes the Stone Age extravaganza of
Orkney. It was exposed to modern humans only after a storm in 1850.
Stone passages connect about a half-dozen now roofless rooms, where you
can see beds, fireplaces, dressers, seats, and boxes for possessions, all
Part IV: The Major Regions 
394

carved of stone. A replica adjacent to the site re-creates what life may have
been like when Skara Brae was inhabited (about 5,000 years ago), while
nearby Skaill House (closed in winter) offers a 17th century version of
bourgeois island accommodations. Allow about two hours.
See map p. 391. B9056 off the A967 (about 31km/19 miles northwest of Kirkwall),
Orkney. % 01856-841-815. www.historic-scotland.gov.uk. Admission: £6.70
($12) adults, £5.20 ($9.60) seniors and students, £3.35 ($6.20) children 5–15. Open: Daily
Apr–Sept 9:30 a.m.–5:30 p.m.; Oct–Mar 9:30 a.m.–4:30 p.m. (except Skaill House).
Other Cool Things to See and Do
 Clickimin Broch, near Lerwick, Stornoway, was first inhabited 
from perhaps 700 to 500 B.C. This stone settlement includes the
2nd-century oval house, as well as the ruins of earlier prehistoric
buildings and walls, which would have enclosed livestock.
 Italian Chapel, off the A961, Isle of Lambholm, Orkney, is where
World War II Italian prisoners of war were brought. On this tiny
island between East Mainland and Burray, they converted one of
the corrugated steel Quonset (or Nissen) huts into a place of wor-
ship with an elaborately painted interior. Today it is one of the
most visited landmarks in Orkney.
 The Longship, 7–15 Broad St., Kirkwall, Orkney (% 01856-888-
790), is a wine shop, founded over 150 years ago, that also sells the
jewelry designs of Ola Gorie, as well as showing off the talents of
other Orcadian craftspeople, whether with fashion accessories,
clothing, or food.
 Mousa Broch, Mousa Island, Shetland, is considered the best sur-
viving Iron Age broch, a tower of stone standing at over 13m (40 ft.)
tall. Once there were some 120 of these dotted about Shetland. To
get there, boats (% 01950 431-367) leave from Sandwick on the
A970, about 22km (14 miles) south of Lerwick.
 The Old Man of Hoy, Hoy, Orkney, is a 137m-tall (450-ft.) stack of
sandstone that rises amid the cliffs along the western shores of
Hoy. It’s a real challenge to rock climbers; my advice is to see it
from the cliff tops, from a touring cruise ship, or possibly from the
ferry to Stromness.
 Orkney Museum, Tankerness House, Broad Street, Kirkwall, Orkney
(% 01856-873-535), covers aspects of Orcadian life during the last
5,000 years. The building dates to 1574, when it was a residence for
church officials. Admission is free.
 Stromness Museum, 52 Alfred St., Stromness, Orkney (% 01856-
850-025), focuses on maritime history, including details about the
World War I German fleet that roamed the Scapa Flow before being
scuttled, and the ships of the Hudson Bay Company, which took
Orcadians to Canada.

Ten Outstanding 
Golf Courses
In This Chapter
 Rubbing shoulders with the golf elite at St. Andrews
 Hitting the links on the wind-swept West Coast
I
t would be unfair to say definitively that the golf courses listed in this
chapter are the ten best in Scotland. The country just has too many
great courses. You would need to golf every day for nearly a year to hit
all the courses. Each one in this chapter has its own special attraction.
Some are more famous than others; some are more difficult than others.
Remember, to play the championship courses, you need a bona fide and
acceptable handicap. So here we go, in alphabetical order.
For every course, call ahead for information about tee times and require-
ments to play (if any exist).
Carnoustie
Although golfers have been playing here since 1560, somehow Carnoustie
has remained one of Scotland’s lesser-known championship courses. It’s
increasingly popular, in part because it has been the site of recent British
Open tournaments (which people here just call the “Open”). The course
has one of the toughest and longest finishes in the country.
Carnoustie, east of Dundee. Par 72. % 01241-853-789. www.carnoustie
golflinks.co.uk.
Gairloch Golf Club
It may be only 9 holes, but this course is still very much a tricky one.
Combine that challenge to your driving and putting skills with a location
along a golden beach and overlooking Skye and the Hebrides and you
have a great course.
Gairloch. Par 35. % 01445-712-407. www.gairlochgolfclub.com.

Muirfield
Muirfield is the best championship course near Edinburgh, and it’s regu-
larly a location for qualifying play before the Open. If you’re not an
expert, you’ll be more comfortable playing on one of the other courses
near Gullane.
Muirfield. Par 71. % 01620-842-123. www.muirfield.org.uk.
Prestwick
The original home of the Open, this course remains a monument to the
early days of golf. It has bumpy fairways, deep bunkers, and many blind
shots, but this old-school course is well worth the time and the challenge.
Prestwick. Par 71. % 01292-477-404. www.prestwickgc.co.uk.
Royal Dornoch Course
This course’s only downside is its location in the far north. You have
plenty of room off the tee, but placing your drive depends greatly upon
the winds. The course is challenging but accessible to nearly everyone.
Dornoch. Par 70. % 01862-810-219. www.royaldornoch.com.
Royal Troon
Despite popular belief, nonmembers (and women) aren’t prohibited
from playing this famous and fabulous course in Ayrshire on the Clyde
Coast. The course has frequently hosted the Open, and each hole pro-
vides a challenge. The 8th hole, or “postage stamp,” is the shortest in
Open history. If you don’t have the chops for Royal Troon, go to one of
the excellent municipal courses nearby.
Troon. Par 71. % 01292-311-555. www.royaltroon.co.uk.
St. Andrews
The Old Course at St. Andrews is arguably the most famous golf course
in the world. All the “greats” of the sport have played here, apparently
even Mary Queen of Scots. This always-challenging seaside links golf
course is the one in Scotland that most frequently hosts the Open. It’s
definitely the mecca of golf, if ever there was one.
St. Andrews. Par 72. % 01334-466-666. www.standrews.org.uk.
Part V: The Part of Tens 
400

Traigh
This is perhaps the most picturesque 9-hole course in Scotland, and pos-
sibly in all of Europe. Just 3.2km (2 miles) up the road from Arisaig on
the old highway, and set right along the country’s most attractive shore-
line, Traigh offers not only challenging golf (for a short course) but bril-
liant views, too.
Arisaig. Par 34. % 01687-450-337. www.traighgolf.co.uk.
Turnberry
The Ailsa Course at Turnberry is home to a fair amount of Open drama;
golf heroes such as Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson, and Greg Norman 
have all competed for the top prize here. The links-style course that
runs along the Ayrshire seashore, against the backdrop of the grand
Turnberry hotel (the Westin Turnberry Resort), is one of the most pic-
turesque in Scotland. Book a room at the hotel to be guaranteed a tee
time.
Turnberry. Par 72. % 01655-331-000. www.turnberry.co.uk.
Western Gailes
With its greens often tucked away in hollows, the course here requires
finesse, accuracy, and precision. This natural links-style course (another
qualifying venue for the Open) hugs the coastline less than an hour’s
drive from Glasgow and can be played practically all year round,
because its sandy fairways and windswept greens drain quickly and the
weather is generally moderate (if typically breezy).

 Visiting the most impressive ancient monuments and medieval abbeys
 Discovering the most fascinating castles and historic ruins
I
n a country with hundreds of ancient castles and ruins, choosing just
ten of the best is certainly difficult. If you’re a history buff or get a
special charge out of walking in the footsteps of some of history’s giants,
put the attractions and locations in this chapter on your must-see list.
But for each of these, you may prefer two others; remember, these are
simply my own favorites.
Calanais Standing Stones
The “Stonehenge of Scotland” is one of the most significant archaeologi-
cal finds of its kind in the entire U.K. (see Chapter 19). Much mystery
surrounds the purpose and origin of these craggy stones (whose
arrangement dates back to perhaps 3000 B.C.), but unlike their English
cousins, here you can walk right up and touch them.
Callanish, Isle of Lewis, Outer Hebrides. % 01851-621-422. www.
historic-scotland.gov.uk.
Castle Tioram
The ruins of this ancient castle (pronounced cheer-rum) on Loch Moidart
(see Chapter 18) have one of the most romantic — and remote — settings 
in the Western Highlands. Although access is limited, you can scale the
small hill upon which the castle sits and let your imagination do the rest.
Near Blain, Ardnamurchan Peninsula, Highlands.

Culloden Moor Battlefield
British forces loyal to the Hanoverian king in London defeated Bonnie
Prince Charlie’s Jacobite rebellion here in 1746, ending a valiant but ulti-
mately unsuccessful movement for restoration of the Stuart crown. An
impressive new visitor center with museum provides the complete his-
tory of the battle and its consequences. Flip to Chapter 18 for more on
this historical site.
Near Inverness, Highlands. % 01463-790-607. www.nts.org.uk.
Culzean Castle
A mansion more than a castle, Culzean remains a classic example of the
work of Robert Adam, Scotland’s preeminent architect in the Georgian
era. In addition to the castle, Culzean offers lots of parkland and gardens
to explore. You can find details on Culzean and its surroundings in
Chapter 15.
South of Ayr, South Ayrshire. % 01655-884-455. www.culzean
experience.org.
Doune Castle
Made famous thanks to the film Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Doune
Castle is one of the best because it has been modestly restored, giving
visitors a feel for what life in a medieval castle truly was like during the
heyday of this classic keep. See Chapter 16 for more details on Doune.
Doune, near Stirling. % 01786-841-742. www.historic-scotland.

Eilean Donan Castle
After Edinburgh Castle, Eilean Donan is probably the most photographed 
castle in Scotland. It has been restored and offers some interesting
exhibits as well as a good bit of history, including defense of the area
from Vikings and serving as a Jacobite stronghold. See Chapter 18 for
more information on this castle.

Glasgow Cathedral
Glasgow Cathedral is the oldest pre-Reformation cathedral still standing
soundly on the Scottish mainland. (The northern island of Orkney has
another from the same era.) It marks the place where the earliest settle-
ments of this industrial powerhouse were established. Flip to Chapter 12
for details.
Townhead, Glasgow. % 0141-552-6891. www.historic-scotland.

Melrose Abbey
Of all the historic abbeys in the Borders region (see Chapter 14), the 
one in Melrose may be the most interesting. Built in the 12th century, it
inspired Sir Walter Scott (who made sure it was secured), and it’s also
the place where the heart of King Robert the Bruce was buried.
Melrose, the Borders. % 01896-822-562. www.historic-scotland.

Skara Brae
This prehistoric beachside village in West Mainland, Orkney, is the best
of its type in northern Europe. Stone passages link several rooms, all 
furnished in stone, from the beds (upon which its Stone Age residents
would lay straw) to fireplaces and even storage boxes. Go to Chapter 20
for details.

Stirling Castle
In the central belt, Edinburgh Castle gets most of the attention, but the
castle at Stirling is a better one to visit. There is a lot of work going on to
restore all the various bits of this ancient seat of Royalty — historically
essentially as important as any castle in Scotland. Go to Chapter 16 for

Ten Distinctive Distilleries
In This Chapter
 “Nosing” about for the good stuff
 Taking tours of distilleries large and small
W
hisky is undoubtedly Scotland’s best-known export; a good deal
of the distilleries across the country are open to the public, many
with tours of their facilities that explain exactly how whisky is made
(and how it’s different from American or Canadian whiskeys) and that
teach visitors how to “nose” Scotch properly. This chapter lists some of
the best to visit.
Caol Ila
On Scotland’s so-called Whisky Island, Islay (eye-la), Caol Ila (cull-ee-la)
has to have one of the best settings for a distillery, nestled at the base 
of a hill at the shore just across from the isle of Jura. While it produces
single malts, it also distills spirits for Johnnie Walker’s premium blends.
Near Pork Askaig, Isle of Islay, Argyll. % 01496-302-760.
Dalwhinnie
Originally called Strathspey distillery, Dalwhinnie has the distinction of
being Scotland’s highest distillery, in elevation, at about 326m (1,073 ft.)
above sea level. The tour of this distillery is good, too, but perhaps not
on par with either the dramatic setting, where you may see snow on sur-
rounding hills in early summer, or the sparkling white buildings with
their pagoda-type roofs.
Dalwhinnie, South of Inverness, Highlands. % 01540-672-219.
Edradour
Edradour is among the smallest distilleries in Scotland, putting out only
12 casks a week, and one of the last remaining so-called farm distilleries

that used to be commonplace in Perthshire. Edradour is produced by a
small staff, using traditional methods and seemingly antique equipment.
Near Pitlochry, Perthshire. % 01796-472-095.
Glenfiddich
Readers who haven’t heard of Glenfiddich probably have little interest in
this chapter. Glenfiddich is one of the three biggest selling whiskies in
the world, which explains why some 125,000 visitors come here annu-
ally. It was the first distillery to recognize the potential of tourism and
open a visitor center, and it’s a good choice for those who want a well-
organized tour of a large, modern distillery.
Near Dufftown, Speyside, Northeast. % 01340-820-373.
Glen Grant
Beautiful gardens are a highlight of a visit to this fine Morayshire distill-
ery. After the tour, take your dram of whisky (apparently a favorite of
Italians) outside and taste it cut with a drop or two of water from the
burbling Glen Grant burn.
Rothes, near Elgin, Speyside, Northeast. % 01542-783-318.
Glenlivet
The Glenlivet is among the most popular single malts sold. The tours
here have a reputation for being the most entertaining and informative
of any in Scotland. Thus, if you’re in the area and can visit only one dis-
tillery, you may want to make it Glenlivet.
Near Tomintoul, Northeast. % 01542-783-220.
The Glenturret
By most accounts, this is the oldest distillery in Scotland. Illegal 
distilling at this site began as early as 1717. Because visitors can quite
easily get here and back in an afternoon drive from either Glasgow or
Edinburgh, Glenturret is very popular, but the staff manages to handle
the crowds adeptly.
Near Crieff, Tayside. % 01764-656-565.

406

Laphroaig
For fans of peaty flavors, Laphroaig from the isle of Islay — Scotland’s
whisky island — is often a preference and is perhaps the best known of
all island single malts. The taste of this whisky carries hints not only of
the local peat but of the sea air as well.
Near Port Ellen, Islay, Argyll. % 01496-302-418.
Strathisla
This fine single malt is better known for being the main ingredient in
Chivas Regal, one of the most popular blends in the world. The distillery
tour here usually ends with an informative and unique “nosing” of differ-
ent whiskies from the various regions of Scotland.
Keith, Speyside, Northeast. % 01542-783-044.
Talisker
The only distillery on the rather large island of Skye, the Talisker tour is
among the best in the country. Talisker produces whisky with the peaty
flavor of the island. In addition to producing its own distinctive brand,
Talisker produces whisky used in popular blends such as Johnnie Walker.

just hunt for perfect photographic backdrops, take in as many of these
top nature spots as you can.
Ardnamurchan Peninsula
Isolated but reasonably easy to reach (in contrast to Knoydart, farther
north), this picturesque western Highland peninsula forms the most
westerly region of the entire British mainland. There are wind-swept
bays and beaches with plenty of opportunities for hiking. Go to Chapter
18 for details.
West of Fort William, Highlands.
Arthur’s Seat and Holyrood Park
It’s rare to find a hike of such natural beauty in any city. But Edinburgh 
is no ordinary metropolis. You can walk to the top of Arthur’s Seat or
cheat and drive to the park — either way, you find plenty to take in,
especially the views. Chapter 11 contains more information on this
Edinburgh landmark.
At the foot of the Royal Mile, Edinburgh.

Cuillin Hills
These dark, brooding hills make a stunning backdrop on the Isle of Skye.
However, you might want to also get out and hike around in a bit of the
region, too. Some of the trails are easy, but don’t attempt to climb the
peaks unless you’re an experienced hiker. You can find details on this
area in Chapter 19.
Isle of Skye, the Hebrides.
Glen Coe
This lovely Highland valley runs some 16km (10 miles) and is fairly
breathtaking every bit of the way — even though it’s best known as the
site of a 17th-century massacre. You can climb Ossian’s Ladder, a trail up
the hillside, or other equally strenuous paths on your own — or opt for a
more moderate ranger-led hike. See Chapter 18 for additional informa-
tion on the valley.
Between King’s House and Ballchulish, Highlands.
Inverewe Garden
I’m cheating a bit with this recommendation, because Scotland’s many
marvelous gardens aren’t exactly natural attractions so much as man-
made wonders. But no matter how it came to be, Inverewe Garden is one
of the loveliest gardens in the country, showing off some glories of
nature: towering trees, flowering shrubs, and almost-tropical species
that survive thanks to the warming North Atlantic flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. For a more complete description of this garden and for visitor
information, check out Chapter 18.
Near Poolewe, Wester Ross, Highlands.
Loch Lomond
I list it largely because it is so accessible. Only a 45-minute drive north
from Glasgow puts you at this excellent body of fresh water. The pretty
scenery is best seen by a boat tour, but plenty of spots along its shores
make for good picnic stops, as well. Coming here allows you to get a
taste of the Highlands without straying too far from the big city. Flip to
Chapter 16 for details.
Northwest of Glasgow, West Dumbartonshire.
Chapter 24: Ten Stunning Natural Attractions 409

Loch Ness
Monster hunting aside, this huge loch in the middle of Scotland is a
lovely natural wonder. Deep, dark, and brooding, it’s little wonder that
people believe Loch Ness hides a legendary beast. The best way to see it
is by boat. Find out more about it in Chapter 18.
Between Fort George and Inverness, Highlands.
Sands of Morar
Between Arisaig and Mallaig on Scotland’s beautiful West Coast, the
beaches of Morar are so spectacular that they’ve been used in several
movies, most notably Bill Forsyth’s Local Hero. The light is magical in
the evenings, especially during summer when the sun slowly sets in 
the northwestern skies. Find out more about the Sands of Morar in
Chapter 18.
Near Mallaig, Road to the Isles, Highlands.
Sandwood Bay
Within the nature conservation area of the Sandwood Estate, this beach
is the most pristine on the Scottish mainland. In part that’s because you
need to walk for about 90 minutes from the nearest road to reach it. See
Chapter 18 for more details.
Near Blairmore, Sutherland, Highlands.
Staffa and Fingal’s Cave
Near Mull, the rock formations and cathedral-like columns of Fingal’s
Cave on the Isle of Staffa were enough to inspire Mendelssohn’s
Hebridean Overture. In addition to the geological beauty, the puffin
colony here is a bonus. Go to Chapter 19 for details on boat tours of
Fingal’s Cave.
Staffa, the Hebrides.

Fast Facts
American Express
The Edinburgh office is at 69 George St., at
Frederick Street (% 0131-718-2505). It’s
open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to
5:30 p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
In Glasgow, the American Express Travel
Service office is at 66 Gordon St. (% 0141-
225-2905). It’s open Monday through Friday
from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday 
9 a.m. to noon. 
ATMs
In Scotland, ATMs (automated teller
machines) are called cash points or cash
machines. In the cities, as well as in many
of the larger towns, ATMs now often con-
nect to international systems such as
Cirrus or PLUS. Many will give cash
advances on major credit cards as well.
Business Hours
Most businesses are open Monday
through Saturday from 9 or 9:30 a.m. to 5 or
5:30 p.m., with some exceptions. Many
businesses and shops are closed Sunday,
although many shops in the cities open on
Sunday afternoons. Most cities also have
extended shopping hours on Thursday until
8 p.m. Outside of Edinburgh and Glasgow,
businesses may close for lunch, generally
from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.
Banks are normally open from 9 a.m. or 
10 a.m. until about 5 p.m. on weekdays.
Banks are good places to exchange cur-
rency and get credit card cash advances.
Restaurants and pubs have different
restrictions on hours of operation depend-
ing upon their licensing, which is con-
trolled by local councils. Although some
bars may not open until late afternoon,
most serve drinks from noon to midnight
and maybe later on weekends. Some pubs
in residential and rural areas, however,
close at 11 p.m. Many restaurants stop
serving food at 2:30 p.m. and resume at
5:30 or 6 p.m. Nightclubs in cities and
larger towns have late-night hours, staying
open until between 1 and 3 a.m. — but
doors may not open until 10 p.m.
Cameras and Film
Most pharmacies sell photo supplies and
many have photo-developing services, as
well. One-hour film processing is available
in larger cities. These services and prod-
ucts are more expensive abroad than in
the U.S. If you have to buy photo supplies
or film while you’re in Scotland, go to a
camera shop or department store. Never
buy film from a souvenir stand near a
tourist attraction, where the markup is high.
Credit Cards
The toll-free emergency numbers for major
credit cards are: Visa % 0800-891-725;
MasterCard % 0800-964-767; American

Express % 0800-700-700; and Diner’s Club
% 702-797-5532 (members can call collect).
Currency Exchange
You can change money at any place with
the sign BUREAU DE CHANGE. You find these
signs at banks, which give you the best
rates; major post office branches; and
many hotels and travel agencies. (See
Chapter 5 for more information on dealing
with money in Scotland.)
Customs
U.K. Customs restricts the value of goods
you can bring into Scotland to about £150
($277). U.S. citizens returning to Scotland
after an absence of at least 48 hours are
allowed to bring back, once every 30 days,
$800 worth of merchandise duty-free.
Driving
In Scotland, cars travel on the left side of
the road. (See Chapter 7 for more details
on driving in Scotland.)
Drugstores
Drugstores are called pharmacies or
chemists in Scotland. The regulations for
over-the-counter and prescription drugs
differ from those in the U.S., so you may
not find commercial pharmaceuticals or
your preferred medicine. Consider bringing
your own products from the U.S.
Electricity
The electric current in Scotland is 240 volts
AC, which is different than the U.S. cur-
rent, so most small appliances brought
from the U.S., such as hair dryers and
razors, don’t work (and the current could
damage the appliance). If you’re consider-
ing bringing your laptop or iron from home,
check the voltage first to see if it has a
range between 110v and 240v. If the volt-
age doesn’t have a range, the only option
is to purchase an expensive converter. If
the voltage does have a higher range, then
you still need to buy an outlet adapter
because your prongs won’t fit in the
Scottish sockets. You can buy an adapter
for about $10 at an appliance store or even
at the airport.
Embassies and Consulates
Embassies are located in London, the 
capital of Great Britain. Edinburgh has
consulates for Australia (69 George St.; 
% 0131-624-3700), Canada (30 Lothian Rd.;
% 0131-245-6013), and the United States
(3 Regents Terrace; % 0131-556-8315).
Emergencies
For any emergency, contact the police or
an ambulance by calling % 999 from any
phone. You can also call the National
Health Service Helpline, % 0800-22-4488,
which offers health-related advice and
assistance from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.
(See Chapter 9 for details on accessing
health care in Scotland.) Every city and
regional chapter lists local hospitals. For
emergencies, treatment is free, although
you will be billed for long stays.
Internet Access
Many hotels offer Internet access (though
it’s usually rather expensive), and Internet
cafes are popular, especially near central
railway stations. See the major city and
regional chapters for more information.
Language
English is the principal language spoken in
Scotland, although heavy accents and
local vernacular (especially words used by
lowland Scots) can make it difficult to
comprehend. Ask the natives to speak
more slowly if you can’t understand them.
Gaelic is spoken in the Highlands and
islands, where signs are frequently in both
Gaelic and English.

Liquor Laws
The minimum drinking age in Scotland is
18. Liquor stores, called off-licenses (or
off-sales) sell spirits, beer, and wine and
generally operate from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Maps
Decent street maps and city plans are sold
at most tourist information centers and
major newsstands. For detailed ordinance
survey maps, try the major booksellers
such as Waterstone’s or Borders.
Police
For emergencies, dial % 999.
Post Office
Most branches of the post office are open
Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. and Saturday from 9 a.m. to noon.
Smaller, rural branches may be open
weekdays from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 2:15 to
5:30 p.m., as well as Saturday from 9 a.m.
to 1 p.m. Many post offices close early on
one day of the week, but how early and
what day depends on the office.
For information on mail services in
Scotland and the U.K., call % 08457-
740-740 or visit www.royalmail.com.
See the major city and regional chapters
for more post office information.
Safety
Violent-crime rates are low in Scotland.
There are few guns in the country, and
most police officers don’t carry them,
either. As a tourist, the most important
thing you can do is guard yourself against
theft. Pickpockets look for people who
seem to have the most money on them and
who appear to know the least about where
they are. Be extra careful on crowded
trains in the big cities and when taking
money from ATMs.
Smoking
In April 2006, a ban on smoking in all
enclosed public spaces, including 
business offices, restaurants, and pubs,
went into effect. Smoking was already pro-
hibited on all trains and buses.
Taxes
A consumption tax of 17.5 percent is put on
pretty much all goods and services. It’s
called VAT (value-added tax), and it works
like local sales taxes do in the United
States. But tourists are entitled to a partial
refund (see Chapter 5 for more informa-
tion). VAT is nonrefundable for services
such as hotels, meals, and car rentals.
Telephones
The country code for Scotland is 44. To
make international calls from Scotland,
dial 00 and then the country code, local
code, and telephone number. The U.S. and
Canadian country code is 1, Australia is 61,
and New Zealand is 63. If you can’t find a
number, a directory is available by dialing
a variety of numbers (thanks to privatiza-
tion of the service), including % 118-811
or % 118-800 for domestic numbers and
% 118-505 for international numbers.
Scotland has pay phones that accept 
coins and credit cards, although the use 
of cellphones (called mobiles) means 
you see fewer pay phones. If you’re inter-
ested in renting a cellphone to use during
your visit, check out Chapter 10 for more
information.
Time Zone
Scotland follows Greenwich Mean Time,
which is five hours ahead of Eastern
Standard Time in the United States (eight
hours ahead of Pacific Standard Time). So,
when it’s noon in New York, it’s 5 p.m. in
Glasgow. The clocks are set forward by
Appendix: Quick Concierge 413

one hour for British summer time in late
March, which expires at the end of
October. The high latitude blesses the
country with long days in the summer, with
sunset as late as 10 or even 11 p.m. But the
opposite is true in winter, when the sun
sets as early as 3:30 or 4 p.m.
Weather Updates
For weather forecasts of the day and 24
hours in advance, and for severe road-
condition warnings, call the Met Office at
% 0870-900-0100. An advisor offers fore-
casts for the entire region and beyond at
your request.

Where to Get More Information
If you’re looking for more information on Scotland, do not go to the
tourist board for Great Britain. Start with the Scottish Tourist Board or,
as it prefers to be called these days, VisitScotland (% 0845–225-5121;
www.visitscotland.com). The Web site has information on accommo-
dations, attractions, and general topics, and you can get details on spe-
cial offers and promotions. You can also find recommended attractions
as well as listings for hotels, guesthouses, B&Bs, self-catering lodging,
caravan and camping sites, serviced apartments, and hostels. Keep in
mind, though, that hotels, restaurants, and attractions generally pay to
be included in these listings.
Plenty of Web sites offer helpful and interesting information on Scotland;
listed below are a few of the better ones. (Remember that things can

change quickly in cyberspace, so a site may have been transformed by
the time you read this.)
 www.geo.ed.ac.uk/scotgaz/scotland.html: A one-stop shop
for info on Scotland’s shopping, recreation, attractions, weather,
tours, and more. This site also has good interactive maps.
 www.scotland.org.uk: An all-purpose site for travel in Scotland.
 www.geo.ed.ac.uk/home/scotland/scotland.html: A great
place to get Scottish history, maps, and demographics. You can
also search the encyclopedic reference guide on this Web site.
Warning: Turn the sound off (or at least turn the volume down) on
your computer before opening this site — a headache-inducing
soundtrack of Scottish Muzak plays nonstop while the site is open.
 www.frommers.com/destinations/scotland: Offers complete
and up-to-date information on Scotland as well as message boards
and more.
